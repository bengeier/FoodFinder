{"text":"Fish Market was one of my favorites places for sushi, and I was glad to see it didn't lose the things I loved when Bluewater Grill took over. The sushi is fresh, flavorful, and reasonably priced (especially during happy hour), and the atmosphere is friendly and casual. The service is hit or miss, but it's worth it.  And there's something about the hot sourdough that makes it hard to resist!"}
{"text":"I searched for a restaurant that served Halibut and found Blue Water Grill. I made reservations for a Birthday dinner and noted the special occasion. When we arrived I was very disappointed. The ambiance was similar to Red Lobster and we were seated by the kitchen. When we placed our order we were told they ran out of Halibut and the alternative choice was a disappointment. In all it was a very disappointing meal. The food was ok but this is not a special occasion restaurant."}
{"text":"Someone took me here for Vday since pappadeux was PACKED. I never go out on that day but wanted to do something. I tried oysters which I will never tried again at least raw, I like oysters in the can (lol). So much better than raw. I did try the grab leg and it was decent but not for the price. My sides where unseasoned as well. The sushi looked amazing, happened to snap photos of other people's food (was seating at sushi bar)."}
{"text":"Second time here and enjoyed it again. Great place for happy hour! Fun to watch chef prepare your favorites. Ben is great and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great service and beer battered cod. Oh, and we got the last lobster for that day!  Get the key lime pie!"}
{"text":"Great date night for seafood and sushi. I could taste the freshness and clean preparation of the food. It seamed that everything was placed on the plate with care and guest perception. Loved this place. Blows the socks off red lobster, joes crab shack and pappadeux or however it is spelled ha although those establishments are reasonably priced and good, blue water grill is the aces. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time there in many years. It was an ok experience.  Slow service but it was Friday evening.    Fish was good but sides were almost cold.   But it was good enough to try again on a less busy night"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING food: fresh, delicious... Scallops were simply melting in my mouth. I went there with a group of friends and everyone loved their dishes, which doesn't happened often in my crowd :) Next time I am planning to bring my bf there for some romantic dinner with oysters :P Good service as well."}
{"text":"The staff was awesome they alone deserve 5 stars, very polite and friendly. I ordered the Seafood Louie Salad combo, and well to be quite honest I've had much better. For  the price of it I expected so much more.  It was put together very sloppy and the crab meat and shrimp were VERY fishy and salty. I've never had crab meat so fishy both smell and taste. I couldn't even finish it....What little I did eat came right back out....   I was very disappointed :-("}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for some time since I bought my Toyota next door. Great experience and atmosphere, the food is superb as well!"}
{"text":"The service was great, the food was outstanding, and we had a wonderful time. Our waiter, Sean, was knowledgeable and attentive. We had the Restaurant Week menu and every course was delicious."}
{"text":"Always amazing food here.  I went with my boyfriend for the first time last spring during restaurant week and the food was so good we went back for my birthday and again last week.    The food has been good every time we've been.  Favorites include the New England Clam Chowder, Lobster Roll, Prawn Cocktail, Swordfish with Risotto..... All super delicious - fresh and perfectly cooked.  We also love the bread.    Besides the food, the atmosphere and the service are on point.  We will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"in the last year we have probably gone 6 to 8 more times for lunch and dinner and i have to upmy star count from 4 to 5 stars.  the food is always great and perfectly prepared.  and the service is always on point. and if you compare prices to comparable seafood places its on par. quality fresh seafood."}
{"text":"I have to admit I didn't expect much from a seafood restaurant in the middle of the desert.  However, I was pleasantly surprised as the food was outstanding.  I ordered the fire grilled Australian Barrundi with coconut jasmine rice and it was terrific.  The fish was perfectly prepared without a hint of oilyness.  The crab and baby arugula topping complimented it well.    For our appetizers we ordered calamari which was good, if unremarkable, however the steamed clams were delicious.  We were greeted with plates of sourdough bread that were hot and tasty and were kept filled throughout the meal.   As good as the food was, the service was really outstanding.  We were a party of 14, which is a challenge anytime, however our waiter Josh took great care of us.  He was on top of keeping our water and drinks filled, handled our special requests quickly and pleasantly, and got all 14 orders out correctly and at the same time.  He did a terrific job taking care of every need with a great sense of humor and professionalism.    I'd definitely recommend them to others and will be back the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food was very good; crab was not entirely split. Service was terrific!"}
{"text":"I knew about this place for a long time and finally get to try it.  i went with friend for happy hour during week day. I was surprised how packed they were. Our waitress, who also happen to be the bar tender, was extremely nice and friendly.   Their dark and stormy and moscow mule was tasty and refreshing.  We ordered oyster on half shell and decided next time it can be skipped.  Their $5 fish taco was totally worth the buck.  Ahi slider was way too small for the price even as a slider. The fries on the side was prefect though. (I am a fries addict.) It was fried with great temperature, crispy and not greasy. Flavor was just right and not too salty.  My friend and I disagreed on the calamari. I think their batter for the calamari was perfect. It was crispy (not the scrapping your mouth kind) yet soft  with perfect flavoring. He thinks the calamari is missing a little texture.   Will go back for some more for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Great seafood fresh and made to order! Because of dietary restrictions, I struggle to find restaurants that can accommodate me, so finding one that accommodates me and is delicious is a real treat. Not only were my prawns and scallops wonderful, but the chef made sides (jasmine rice and garlic sautéed spinach) that were perfect. My husband greatly enjoyed his cioppino, and our friend (a local) had never been here before and was delighted with his meal and will come back. Our server (Chevy?) was very cheerful and attentive, and was very careful to be sure we were all pleased. One extra touch: we were trying to decide on a wine and she brought us samples of the ones she recommended for us to try. Her suggestions were great, but we all liked one very much, and were grateful for the tasting so that we had wine we all enjoyed,"}
{"text":"Had halibut. Was well overpriced and over cooked and chewy. Won't go back. Paid over 60$ for mediocre quality."}
{"text":"I have to say, I've been here a few times, but this last trip was really good!  Had the soft shell crab roll which although was fair to high in price....was worth every cent!  Also tried the baked mussels which was very good.  The fried calamari was actually the best I had in years.  Also had the osysters rockafeller.  Have to say they were really good.  The only dine side was that you got more of them when it was Fish Market.  BTW, I shared all this food with a friend and we ate every peice of food it was that good.   I will be pack with other friends in near future"}
{"text":"Excellent place if you are in the mood for seafood. The clam chowder was delicious and I could see myself coming back solely for a cup if I'm in the neighborhood.   For the entree, I had the current special of red fish, which was perfectly prepared and delivered rich Cajun flavor. I wasn't quite as impressed with the rice and beans that the fish was topped on, but eating vicariously through other plates in the room, it looks as though they have much better options available.   All in all, the food was great. Not quite a \"knock your socks off amazing\" good, but it's not just about the food. The service was exquisite and the ambience was very warming and made it the complete package that I would gladly recommend."}
{"text":"Food and service was amazing ... Be sure to ask for Lisa to be your server. Clam chowder like it came from Cape Cod ... Sushi menu extended ... Something for everyone. What a great time visiting with friends. If it's a holiday weekend or you want to be sure not to have to wait. Use the reservations option."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and service is always great! It's the perfect place to relax over a nice dinner during an evening out. The last time we dined there, we ended up staying for over two hours just enjoying the atmosphere, food and conversation. We go often and I love their sushi. I wanted it last night so we called to get carry-out because I'm on crutches and it's hard to get around. The manager, Jose, was super accommodating and offered to rush our order when he found out we were sitting in the car outside. Love this place -- the atmosphere, service & their delicious food! :)"}
{"text":"The food was great, the SERVICE WAS NOT ! We felt rushed to place an order. We had oysters and as soon as I finished the last oyster the main course was being placed on the table. While eating (mouth full ) the waitress approaches the table and begins to ask questions, oblivious to the fact that I'm chewing food and can't answer without spewing food every where. We ordered coffee and desert , the waitress brought the coffee, no cream, no sugar. A good wait staff would have asked if we take sugar/cream when the order was placed. I then had to ask for spoons for the desert and coffee, didn't feel like sticking my finger in the cup or picking up my desert with my fingers. When the waitress brought the spoons to the table she had her palm wrapped around the spoon portion with the handle facing out , very very unsanitary ! She had been handling other customers plates , checks and moving chairs around. For the price you would think they would train their staff on proper sanitation practices as well as proper timing of meal presentation!"}
{"text":"I'm in town for an hour saw this place on line before we left Angel Fire.  Chef John Murphy is outstanding not only regarding the meal but in regards to excellent customer service as well. Enjoyed it immensity and will be back later this week. Thanks John! !!!"}
{"text":"It's like an older Red Lobster restaurant. Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly but after dessert she vanished. Leaving us waiting for boxes to go and melting desserts. The food was not great, just OK. Overpriced for the location, ambiance, and quality. One item to write home about was their New England Chowder that was great!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with their service and quality of food. A group of 20 of us had reservations and so we were shown to a room just for us, for privacy. There were several things that impressed me about the service: 1) we were given separate bills, which I know is a hassle for the server but so much easier for us to determine payments, 2) the sushi orders and entree orders (which come from 2 completely different kitchens) were coordinated such that we all received our meals at the same time (which I thought was extraordinary), and 3) prompt adjustment to the AC (too cold) was made when we requested.  I ordered 2 specialty rolls, the Bluewater Special Roll and the Seniorita roll. EX-CELL-ENT. Delicious and alot of food. The prices were just what I'd expect to pay for such high quality sushi ($14 each). I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous restaurant! Had my traditional seafood birthday dinner here this year, and they did not disappoint! They were running a Maine lobster boil special. The lobster was the best I have had in a very long time...sweet meat and perfectly cooked. Our waiter was fantastic and friendly, even despite the fact that we were dressed in our regular street clothes. Will definitely come here again, and again!"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for our anniversary and it was delicious! We ordered the calamari appetizer which was great and cooked perfectly!! I had the king crab legs and it was well worth the price!! The waitress was great as well!! Great customer service from her and the manager of the restaurant even came and introduced himself which I thought was nice! Everyone is really friendly and attentive!! This is the best seafood restaurant in town!!! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"We both enjoyed our experience at Bluewater Grill.  We really appreciate seafood for itself, not dressed exotically with heavy or unusual sauces.  The oysters on the half shell were wonderful as was the gumbo and the very fresh Ipswitch clams.  Our server was very attentive and efficient.  We hope to return as soon as possible for more of the \"real thing\"."}
{"text":"Expected better.  The grilled tuna was average at best.  From our party of 4 none were in the \"Wow\" category for any of their food.  Service was OK but again not anything exceptional.  Pretty average results with above average prices."}
{"text":"Tried sopporo in Scottsdale tonight for the first time.  The decibel level with the bombastic stuff they call music still has my ears ringing.  We cut our visit short just to escape the racket.    Blue  Water  Grill is the place for us.  Nice quiet ambience, great food, nice people, extensive menu (even my picky grand daughter can find something to enjoy)."}
{"text":"This place has good food, but the portions are very small for the high prices they charge."}
{"text":"I had a good experience last March when I visited the sushi bar during happy hour. So, I went back for dinner recently. I was seated in the diningroom area and ordered dinner. I wanted to order a sushi appetizer, but was informed that in order to get the 'happy hour' pricing I would have to move to the bar area. I asked the manager why the pricing was different for the same product in the dining room and was told that they wanted to maintain a \"different energy\" in the sushi bar area. Well, my 'energy'  and wallet cannot support that explanation. Prices should be honored for all patrons equally."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend on a busy Saturday night, and we were just unimpressed with the service. We had high hopes for the food due to its Yelp rating, but we were left with the bland dishes we ordered. They also need to work on their food presentation. We won't be coming back, unfortunately."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! The service was great as well.  I didn't realize there is an affiliation to the fish market in San Diego.  I absolutely love the fish market so this place was just as good.  We had the clams and mussels which were delicious.  I also had the sea scallops which were soooo awesome.  The service was great and our server did a great job of explaining everything.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Second time I've been and the second time still wasn't that great. Wanted Sushi and obviously the sushi chef wasn't there so I only had a choice between Spicy Tuna and Cali Roll-got both and both were falling apart-Taste ok nothing to rave about. I also got the calamari (which I love) but confused on why they give it with a side of cocktail sauce-Danny was the server he was AWESOME-very tentative and knew all the answers to the question's I asked about the menu-On the other hand the manager Jeff I felt ignored our table-As a manager how do you pick and chose which customer's to talk to? Well he spoke to the table directly in front and behind he was loud and clear when saying hello, good bye, thank you but all I got was a look. I wasn't asking for a conversation but a \"thank you for coming\" would have been nice-Oh well 5 stars for Danny (the server), 3 stars for the food, 1 star for Jeff (the manager. Will I be going to Bluewater Grill again NO."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. Thanks Scott! Nice touch with the candle lit flour less chocolate cake/ice cream and candle for our anniversary! Had scallops and barrumundi (jalapeño was not spicy. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Best seafood I've had in Arizona. Great atmosphere.  Great service. Katherine, our server's recommendations were spot on! I recommend the Surf and Turf. The creme brûlée is great too and comes with fresh house made whipped cream. Try sitting outside on the patio."}
{"text":"Those who liked the Fish Market won't be dissappointed here, and those who didn't like Fish Market may or may not be impressed enough with the slight upgrades to like Bluewater.  We went with friends after the opera, and we started at the bar with oysters and clams.  Despite a quickly-remedied miscommunication with the server (who I think couldn't believe we ordered THAT many oysters), the oysters and clams were excellent.  The new stools were oddly high and interspersed with tall chairs at normal heights.  On a stool I towered over my friend in the tall chair, and did not ahve enough room to get my knees under the bar.  The bartender said the too-tall stools were going to be shortened. Until then, avoid the stools.  Not much else has changed since Fish MArket.  Some new lighting, a stand-up bar separating the oyster bar and lobby area, a bit less junk on the walls (still fishing pictures and stuffed fish), a new fish counter for buying fish to go... and that's about it.    The menu is also familiar.  The appetizers looked the same, Ducket's Bucket included (thank goodness).  Similar entree selections; various fish in various ways.  I ordered the halibut in sweet chili sauce, and asked for the sauce on the side.  It came on the fish, not on the side, and was to sticky, yucky sweet.  I wasn't all that hungry, so I dug into the non-sauced interior and the halibut itself was pretty good.  My friend ordered the same thing but did not notice the \"sweet\" mention on the menu, and she absolutely hates sweet entrees.  She told the waiter she made a wrong choice, said it was clearly her fault, and wanted to order something else.  He was extremely gracious (I think he took it off their tab) and brought a crab and arugula salad that she insisted I taste....and I'm glad for that because it was fab - lots of hunky crab in a very light slightly mayo sauce, atop fresh greens.  i'll go back for that.  My husband had more oysters, and I already commented on those. Yummy.  After the meal, they brought out complementary bananas Foster, which was ok if it's in front of me, but I wouldn't order it.  The sauce was too overly cinnamon and sticky syrupy.  Service throughout the whole meal was nice, and despite us shutting down the place they made no move to hurry us out."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place does not advertise what an good sushi bar they have! We ate at the sushi bar because we heard about it from a friend. The place doesn't have a sushi bar atmosphere more of fresh seafood market. The sushi chefs were very nice and made awesome rolls! We got the blue water house roll and the senorita roll both very delicious. Both fresh and tasty! I will defintely be back to take advantage of the happy hour! Only four stars because I feel the prices were a little over priced and service was a little slow. But I will be back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"The blue point oysters were wonderful and served on a bed of ice, the seared Tuna wasn't as good as the first visit.  It wasn't cooked or presented the same and it tasted very bland. (Nothing like the photo below).  I requested more sauce.  The Walleye Pike was cooked to perfection, however, the couscous was tasteless, and the other sides were average.  It was a Birthday celebration and the waiter asked me what kind of dessert would I like.  I selected the Mud Pie.  When we received the bill, the mud pie was added to our bill in the tune of $8.00. Why? I assumed it was on the house.  Our total bill with tip for two people was over $100. We had ordered two bottled beers with our meal. Very disappointing..."}
{"text":"Extremely efficient bartender/waiter that served me is John and he did a wonderful job. The grassy bar oyster were amazing to my surprise. I also was lucky enough to have some fanny bays as well even when it's not on the menu. Wash all that down with a draft wheat beer and you got yourself a great Friday night... Even if you're by yourself!  I couldn't stop ordering more oysters. Dinner will be finally be.... Wild prawn linguine! Of course! Oh yeah forgot that I also had an arugula salad with crab meat in between the oysters. The salad was also good with a bit of avocado in there, light and sweet! Wow horseradish are graded fresh!!!!!"}
{"text":"Unimpressive.   The waitress was syrupy sweet to the point of annoyance.   We started with the wedge salad and new England calm chowder.  The salad was swimming in dressing.  I ordered a bowl of the chowder, but only received a cup, thankfully, as it was as tasteless as canned cream of potato soup with a can of clams thrown in.  In fact, I suspect that is exactly how it was prepared.  For entrees, we ordered the scallops and the crab legs.  There was more mushy spinach flavors than anything else in the scallop dish and the five small scallops were very overdone.  The king crab was done well, but frankly heating up frozen crab takes little culinary mastery.  The side of fries was cooked petfectly, crispy outside, flaky inside.  If only they had been served hot....  The good value on the bottle of Meomi pinot noir was the lone highlight of the meal.  We have driven past this place for years - we will continue to drive past Bluewater for years to come.  Stopping there yesterday was a mistake."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. I ordered seared tuna  and it was still almost frozen in the middle !  I've had seared Tuna in many other restaurants and this is the first bad experience I've ever had. I hardly ever send a meal back to the kitchen, however I did send this one back. It was much better the 2nd time, but I don't think I will be back.  I give the staff 5 stars, but the food only earned 2."}
{"text":"Superb delicacy of seafood! Great presentation and tastes fresh from the ocean! Loved it!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the workers were so kind and friendly! Highly recommend :)1"}
{"text":"From my first look at the menu to my last bite of food, this place was amazing.  The service was spectacular too.  This is my new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for Christmas Eve two weeks in advance. I asked them to confirm that they would be open and the young man asked his manager. The manager confirmed they would be open for their regular hours and my reservation for six people at 8pm was gladly accepted. So when we arrived on time and found the restaurant dark and empty, we had to scramble to find anything else open. I'm used to Chinese food on Christmas Day but it was a poor substitute for the usually fine seafood and service my family has enjoyed at Bluewater, formerly Fish Market, for over twenty years. No phone call. No warning. No notice. Just a big helping of disappointment. Bah humbug."}
{"text":"It is very rare for me to take my precious time out and write anything. The food was amazing and our serving manager Lisa was outstanding. She went above and beyond to make my parents 60th anniversary something to remember. I hope the owner reads this and give her a raise. She is one of the special employees that any business would be lucky to have."}
{"text":"I am spoiled by good seafood in California. This restaurant meets the standards! Great service and nice ambiance. I didn't care for my food too much as I prefer more spices, but I think it was the dish I ordered. The quality of the food seemed good! The mashed potatoes are a must!"}
{"text":"Lunch by myself isn't usually my idea of a good time, but a Seafood Jasmine Rice Bowl and some stellar service provided by Lisa made thus a lovely lunch instead of lonely.  The coconut jasmine rice was moist without being sticky, and the slight orange flavor to the sauce perfectly complimented the seafood and green beans.  Thanks for a very nice experience!"}
{"text":"This place is the BEST for seafood in the valley! I took my son there and we had fresh oysters and crab rolls for an entree and the food was great and the service superb. Will return."}
{"text":"We went here about a month ago and had a great meal.... I had Barramundi and they modified what went with it for me.... the place was great.... and our waitress was very good!  We ordered Keoke coffee afterward and they were super....We will definitely go again!!"}
{"text":"After seeing it so many times from driving on the 51, I finally stopped by during happy hour. The place had a relaxed atmosphere, with the offerings of fish sure to please everyone. I had a chance to try a few items while I waited for my car and had an awesome experience. The Bluewater roll was excellent, as well as the mashed potatoes. The calamari, while tasty,was slightly salty (it could have easily been me though). The best part was the key lime pie at the end--tasted fresh and worth the trip. The staff is super friendly and the bartender Rachael was amazing! She made sure I was taken care of and made my first experience a great one."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fresh fish in the valley, this is the place to go. We ordered salmon and Phoenix roll and both were super delicious. Ambience is great but the service... Not too thrilled. That's why I'm giving them a four. Our server was somewhat rude and a bit odd! He also screwed up the bill twice and said that it's because of their antiquated computer. I will still come back though and hope that we won't get him next time!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT THE SHELLFISH. I ordered the bucket of mussels and clams, while my boyfriend ordered the swordfish. As soon as I tried the first mussel, it tasted literally like feces. Then I tried eating the clams instead, and after 4 of them I had gotten a mouth full of sand and felt sick. Now I'm dealing with shellfish poisoning and I just want to warn everyone not to even try it!! After reading a couple other reviews, I see that other people have gotten sick as well. Will never return here."}
{"text":"Well..I found my Manhattan Clam Chowder and this place does it right.  Out of my area but will certainly be coming back for more. I also had the Fried clams and they were fantastic. These clams were freshly breaded and not frozen. Very good. I also had the Senorita roll from the Sushi bar and loved it. Very nice experience."}
{"text":"We had crab and arugala salad and mahi mahi with cilanto lime slaw.   The food was good apart from the Mahi Mahi being a little overcooked for my taste."}
{"text":"Not great.  No, maybe moderately bad.  I just moved my office to the 16th Street Corridor or Squaw Peak Corridor (or Piestawa Peak Corridor, if you are new to PHX), and for the most part the food in the area is great.  Bluewater is not worth a second chance with so many good options.  I went for lunch, perhaps not Bluewater's strong suit.  I was alone and sat up at the bar immediately in the front door.  Realizing that I had sat at the Oyster Bar, I wanted to ask the Chef-Dressed gentleman behind the counter if I could order regular (non-oyster) lunch.  I waited patiently until the Chef-Guy and a customer finished their conversation about '80s Japanese sports cars (a minute or more to be acknowledged) which I did not mind because, heck, I like cars, so I could ask my question.  I was told \"I could get anything I want.\"  I love that statement.  Maybe I want a vineyard, but it's probably not on the list of specials.  I was handed a paper menu that already had a half a dozen mayo stains on it.  I hope it was mayo.  To my surprise, the lunch fare included 10 or so dishes ranging from $10 to $15.  I was surprised because I thought it would be cheaper judging from how Bluewater did no remodeling save the signs and flags from when The Fish Company served mediocre fare here.  I blew the bank on the $15 Crab Club.  I asked Chef-Guy what was on it, and he not so appetizingly said bacon, avocado, mayo (the last guy must have got it too) tomatoes and yes, crab.  Simple, right?  I went for it and got a Manhattan (red) clam chowder and coleslaw.  I received a large amount of free bread for one person without asking.  I didn't want it.  I got a sandwich after all, and I'm not carb-loading for today's workout.  Around this time, a nice older woman from Hawaii, she told me, sat next to me and she ordered ice tea.  She didn't get it.  She told Chef-Guy that she did not want bread.  She got it anyways.  She ordered a glass of wine.  She did not get that.  Another chap at the bar proclaimed , \"He always does that.  He gets so distracted.\"  Seven people are at the bar...  Chowder arrives.  It's ok.  It's my fault.  I don't think I have ever had memorable Manhattan Chowder.  If you are from New England and want to tell me how Phoenix food is horrible and how the only good chowder is back east, i.e: bagels, pizza, deli, etc., save your fingers.  I just don't care.  Go back east and take your pushy Trader Joe's Behavior with you.  Sandwich arrives much later.  I didn't mind. The British Open was on the TV.  The poor crab was getting a second chance at swimming.  The mayo sauce was running out on to the plate.  The chef should be fined for making a 600 calorie meal into a 1200 calorie meal.  I could not for the life of me taste crab.  I could have ordered Styrofoam Club, I would not have known the difference.  Coleslaw sucked.     I paid my $21 lunch with water tab and bounced.  On the good side, it was relatively clean, there was no real fish smell and I didn't get in an accident in the parking lot.  Back in the office now, the displeasure continues in my abdomen.             UPDATE        Jeff, the GM, contacted me via email and said that he discussed the review with staff.  He invited me back for another try.  That's pretty solid.  We'll see."}
{"text":"Out n about near biltmore so my hunny and i agreed on stopping at the blue water grill. We had steamed clams caterpillar roll and a bowl of the new England clam chowder. We sat at bar where cook prepares appetizer dishes, he recommended his honey badger drink, I never heard of it but tried it any way, ended up having 2. Over all as far as the section we sat in, we enjoyed our meal and drinks and had a good over all experience."}
{"text":"I sort of hate leaving a bad review, because I love/d this place...I hope this experience was a 1 time thing for us.  My partner and I arrived around dinner time and were seated in the bar area.  We received our bread and butter... I joked because we got four pieces of bread, and three pieces of butter (and I wish that had been the end of it).   We then ordered appetizers, a mahi-mahi and the king crab legs, as well as some adult beverages.  We waited FOREVER (probably 30 minutes) and our entree's came out...  The appetizers were totally skipped.  The waitress apologized and asked if we wanted them...which seemed pointless.  So we dug into our entrees... Super disappointing.  The mahi-mahi was over cooked.  The risotto was like wall paper paste.   The king crab legs were literally barely above freezing in some areas.   When we asked about the quality of the food we were told the head chef was out that night, and I'm hoping that's true....because they really only have 1 more chance or I wont be back.     They DID comp the drinks, and we didn't end up paying for the appetizers since they never even got ordered apparently, so the bill only ended up being about $60... and we didn't bother with dessert.  They easily lost out on what could have been a $170 ticket.    We were both starving still so we went across the street and got a burger..."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner. Outstanding service and the food was on point!"}
{"text":"Yes. You can get good seafood in the middle of the desert!  I chose this restaurant for our departure meal from the great southwest based strictly on my hankering for seafood and based on yelp reviews. Once again, fellow  yelpers didn't let us down.   First off the sour dough bread was fresh and very good. I started with a half dozen oysters, 3 blue point and 3 grassy bar;  the latter I had never had before. I may as well have been on the coast at a shack watching my shellfish being shucked.  I followed with the fire grilled salmon served on a bed of cashews, avocado, cucumber, couscous and king crab salad with achiote creme. Yeah, it's as good as it sounds.  She had the seared sea scallops. Perfectly seat and seasoned served with a nice combination of spinach, shallots, mushrooms and white citrus soy sauce.  A really nice sendoff after our tour de AZ et UT."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant experiences I've had in a long time! The service was impeccable, food was delicious, and ambiance was just right . (Aside from the fact that I heard too many Dave Matthews songs... although the volume was at a perfect decibel lol.) John (\"Murph\") was serving us behind the sushi bar and was an absolute pleasure. He was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. He even warned me about ingredients that weren't listed in the descriptions of menu items. Thank you! It was very refreshing to see that he was happy to be there and enjoyed our patronage as well. Dinner was excellent; we had soup, salad and sushi. Kudos on the caterpillar roll! I definitely look forward to my next meal at the Bluewater Grill!"}
{"text":"They just can't live up to the quality and flavor of the previous owners \" The Fish Company \" .  Sorry but the transition was a fail :(   I miss my go to place.  Their prices went up , understandable, but the portions got smaller and some of the food didn't seem as fresh , almost premade the prepared and plated. My honey and I used to treat ourselves to the Top Of The Market where upstairs they had a more formal dining experience. Maybe I'm being too judgmental based on a belief that if one place takes over another and serves the same food they should be equal in every way. The service is good , the place is clean and the food is ok. Got $$ to blow ? Then you won't mind it here. Personally I have to save up to indulge in an evening at a seafood restaurant and when I do I want the quality to be more than red lobster ( which any ethical seafood lover won't go to ) so I will be on the search for a new place to spend my very hard earned money."}
{"text":"On 2/22/2015 my family and I went to eat at this location since it's one of my grandfather's favorite places to go on a special occasion,  the food was great . Our server Ericka on the other hand was absolutely the worst I've ever experienced . She never even told us her name until the third time she came and we had to ask. My Father said \"hey there\" to ericka and she didnt even smile and responded with \"hi\". She didn't ask how any of us were doing , she left us waiting for our water and soda refills for atleast 10mins and she never brought the straw I asked her for. When we were ordering and asking questions about the menu she said \"it says it right there on the menu\" .I would hope that the server would be a little more informative or atleast polite . She would walk away before we were even finished speaking to her.  We asked her to bring two sodas and she came back with one and my father asked her if she could bring out another and she responded \"I did bring out another soda?\"with the dirtiest look on her face. We were in shock that we went to spend good money on seafood and our server didn't even smile. I honestly won't even go there again I get better service at Dennys if you ask me ."}
{"text":"Had a excellent dinner last week. Oysters Rockefeller as good as it gets. Fried belly clams delicious. Lisa, our waitress was great, very attentive without being overbearing . The only reason it didn't get 4 stars ad nothing to do with the food or service: the patio had no view . We will definitely return even though we live as far north in Scottsdale as you can go"}
{"text":"I'm always wary of seafood in land-locked states, but Bluewater Grill is classy and delicious.  This would be a great place to take your lover, or your family, or just get together as a bunch of friends and enjoy the food and some drinks!  The clam chowder is very respectable (I think they have both kinds, but I had the New England) and the fish and chips is nothing to scoff at either.  My lover had the scallops and they were done to perfection."}
{"text":"Pros:  Excellent weekend happy hour, great sushi and sushi chef, attentive service, conveniently next to Total Wine.  Cons: None.  Bluewater is part of our weekend routine.  Sushi deals on happy hour are pretty good, and they have a few drinks for around $5.  Honestly the highest quality, least expensive sushi in the area."}
{"text":"The Atmosphere was great. Madelyn, our waitress was wonderful. The food could have been better. My wife's and my Mahi- Mahi was over cooked and a bit rubbery, although the Sushi that I ordered (yellow Tail) was the best part of my meal. Our other guests at the table told me that they food was a little high priced for what the received. We will give Blue Water Grill one more chance because they may have just had an off night."}
{"text":"Went here today to take my wife out for mothers day because we love seafood and we have been here once before and had a great experience the last time.   our waitress was AWESOME and the customer service from the other employees was also great! She took the time to give us her favorite dishes and explained a few that we were interested in.   We ordered crab cakes, oysters and clam chowder for starters. They were all great, especially the crab cakes. We ordered miso salmon and scallops for our entrees and they were also both great. The green beans that came with the salmon were a little aldente but still good.   If that wasn't enough food to order, we also had creme brulé for dessert to finish off a FANTASTIC meal!!   Let's just say....WE WILL BE BACK!!! P.S. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND SOME OF YOU WITH BAD REVIEWS...WHAT ELSE COULD YOU ASK FOR!!"}
{"text":"First time at this Bluewater Grill. Used to go to the one in Newport Beach all the time. Was great to find that the service here was even better than we had experienced in California. Our server was Cliff and he really knows the menu well; can make great suggestions if you are on the fence, like I was. I ended up with the clam chowder and two appetizers: the edamame and the seared scallops with pancetta and a wasabi aioli. My husband also had the clam chowder and the fish and chips. The seared scallops were the best we have ever tasted and the wasabi aioli was the perfect compliment. My husband loved his fish and chips and was surprised with how good the cole slaw tasted as well! Cliff provided excellent service and together with the great food, he made sure we will be returning to the Bluewater Grill soon! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance, love the food but our waitress, Chevy, leaves a lot to be desired. Sitting on the outside deck she took our order and we never saw her again until after our food arrived. I can only imagine she was so so busy waiting on the two other tables that had customers that she totally forgot we were waiting for addition service such as more bread and drinks."}
{"text":"Although I do not eat fish, my husband does, and we went there for his birthday early January.  The atmosphere and decor very nice indeed and our waitress was most friendly and helpful in putting together a vegetarian option for me, which was delicious.  Service fast.   As we were there on a Tuesday lunchtime, it was quiet.    Thank you."}
{"text":"We are from New England. Boston area. Living in Goodyear, AZ for almost 20 yrs. Have not been back East for about 3 yrs. It was my wife's birthday and she craved Maine lobster. We searched internet and came up with Bluewater.  She got her lobster. I was happy to find Ipswich clams. Also had clam chowder.  This was a great experience all around. Food and service was above and beyond what we expected. We thought price for our meals was reasonable ($35 Lobster, 24 clams.) All in all meals and drinks and for free birthday cake came to $98. Thank you for a pleasant experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"Love love love this place I go here often for happy hour it's the best Happy Hour in the valley rocking sushi and Moscow mules yum!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here with my wife for years. This place is really special to us. We always sit outside. The oysters are what we come here for. They are fresh as can be. The staff is super friendly and know us by name. The decor is okay, but for the price you pay for a meal, it could be better. We sit outside because its nicer. As far as price, we spend about 70 bucks between the two of us. If you want seafood, this is where you want to get it. Fresh, fresh, fresh!"}
{"text":"We visited on Father's Day, this review is late...I know.  We made reservations, which we really did not need, they were not too busy.  We had oysters to start, this was my first time trying them, they were delish!!!  The order came out with different types of oysters, that gave me the opportunity to see the different textures and flavors.  Our entrees were delish too!  I had the paella, my hubby and mom had the Mahi Mahi.  Both were very good as well, with a rich and creamy risotto.  Must try the bloody mary if you are a fan of them... this one came with a giant shrimp and all of the fixings."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to the Grill for lunch today and we won't be rushing back!  My trout did not taste or smell fresh!  It was probably not fresh in the first place or had been cooked and then reheated.  I absolutely should have sent it back but I didn't due to a time constraint."}
{"text":"Who knew you could get such delicious fresh seafood in downtown Phoenix??? Loved it! I had a really yummy seafood pasta. My husband had the fresh Barramundi. He said it was one of the best he's had. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's OK. The clam chowder was not really flavorful like other clam chowders that we tried, the roll with seared tuna was edible, and the key lime pie was just wrong. So, nothing to write home about.  Will not re visit this place ever."}
{"text":"We just had the best happy hour experience with Ben (I hope that's his name). He was our server and chef; attentive, personal and friendly! We had two glasses of house Sauvignon Blanc wine, a yellowtail nigiri roll, baked mussels, clams casino, steamed clams, oyster rockefeller, and calamari friti, all made to order while you watch for 52$! We tipped him 15$ and it was worthy every penny! This is our new every Monday spot!"}
{"text":"Seafood in Phoenix, Arizona? We've been going to Bluewater since moving here from California. We love sitting at the oyster bar and watching everything be prepared. Never been disappointed in the great service, fresh food and great atmosphere....on our wish list is that they open in Scottsdale, where we live."}
{"text":"They've got the best! Jeff is an awesome mgr that we've known for almost 10 yrs. Wade is our fav server/bartender and is why we keep coming back.  He never gets our order wrong and always makes us laugh!  We are treated like royalty! Food is fresh and service is excellent!  Just ate there today with out of town family and they thought that the service rocked!  Thx guys!!!"}
{"text":"Great seafood! I had the calamari for appetizer and Barramundi as an entree, both were very good. I liked that they had more variations to offer, other than the typical salmon, mahi mahi, etc that you usually see in the desert. Average prices for seafood and this is a restaurant I will come back to often!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend their seared jumbo scallops with spinach and mushrooms. It's very rich and sumptuous. It doesn't come with very many scallops, but, I still have trouble finishing it all."}
{"text":"We picked up an order of bacon wrapped scallops to go on one evening. They were delicious. I was impressed by the atmosphere when picking up the order, and the quality of the food, so we decided to return the following day for dinner. It was happy hour, so we tried several items off of the happy hour menu. The sushi was excellent. We also ordered some salads that were very good. The waitress was friendly and helpful. We will return when we are in the area again."}
{"text":"I just wanted to add to my review because the staff and management at Bluewater Grill were so amazing when helping my fiance plan his prosal to me at their restaurant! We have also loved Bluewater Grill for our go-to date place when we crave seafood, and we have always been curious about the upstairs area. A few months ago we found out they were renivating the upstairs area for events, rehearsals, etc., and we had joked about having our rehearsal dinner there in the future. Well, to my surprise my fiance and his friend partnered with the manager about setting up the proposal upstairs alone, then having a party for me with my close family and friends in the bar afterwards. They even had our favorite service come in and serve us. They were so amazing!   Thanks Bluewater grill and thanks to Rachel our fav server!"}
{"text":"The seafood is fresh and delicious. I ordered the fish and chips and they were cooked excellent. The tartar sauce and coleslaw is house made and great. Reasonable prices drink menu is good."}
{"text":"My wife of 40 years came here last Friday night to celebrate our first meeting on November 10, 1974. And it was a blind date!  My wife had hot crab sandwich and I had the salmon , plus a bowl of New England Clam Chowder. Our service and our food was first rate, and they made our evening extra special.  Steve"}
{"text":"Food was good but have a bad experience with the waitress,  eather she was new or she was hitting the wine. I  fell that I should say l have been here many times before and have alway has attentive wait staff. And a very good experience eating at the Blue water Grill."}
{"text":"Blue Water Grill in my opinion services the finest Sea Food in the Valley!  I've lived in Paradise Valley for over 40 years and eaten at most of the better Sea Food and other Restaurants in the Valley.  I've also traveled extensively, including the West coast and my mother's family (and many generations before her) lived in a little town south of Boston were I spent a lot of time growing up and visiting as often as I can so I know and love good Sea Food, particularly east coaster lobster, lobster rolls, Ipswich fried clams, scollops, clam chowder and fish from that area. Blue Water Grill also have periodic specials including bake stuffed lobster and starting July 12th (and for the remainder of the month of July) a traditional New England Lobster Clambake which I very much enjoyed on the evening of July 12th.  Simply put, it was as good as any I have had over a lot of years in Boston and in the New England area!  All Blue Water Grill's Sea Food is great but if you like New England Sea Food, there just is not a restaurant in the Valley that can even begin to compete with Blue Water Grill.  Another favorite of mine in their San Francisco Cioppino.  You'd have to go to San Francisco to find any as good.  I think their secret is that they don't try to compete with steak houses and other fancy restaurants that try to have a menus to pleases everyone. They just serve Sea Food and darn good Sea Food at that! Bill P"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience here! Our server, I believe her name was Lisa, went above and beyond to make our night perfect  the food was excellent - my husband had the mahi mahi with risotto and I had the cioppino with linguine. Huge portions and cooked perfectly. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Ate here one time before and the food was great so decided to go again.  Again the food was very good quality.  I had shrimp and scallops this time. The sides were also delicious. The waitress was very nice and prompt. The lower rating is because of the meager portion size and the price both this time and last time I ate here."}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey and its not really the place for a quick meal but the food and environment is awesome. I'm not a big sushi or fish fan but I'm in love with the dynamite california rolls! I also tried the mauhi mauhi (spelling?) And it was very good, not fishy at all. I ordered the only steak on the menu and it was also good. A little to cuisine for me but when in Rome :). The sourdough bread was amazing. I had the spiked cherry limeade which was yummy but for $8 a drink I'll order a martini next time.  Overall, very yummy! Id love to try it out for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Bluewater grill since it was the fish market. I take my grandson for the crab legs that are expensive but truly amazing. They cost less than the so called fish restaurant Red Lobster who tried to give him snow crab legs because he was only 10, under the guise of being king crab legs. Food always good and fresh , I expect to pay a little more because of the freshness. Never been disappointed in food or the service. Going there at the weekend!"}
{"text":"My alumni group holds regular meetings here.  Last night, we hosted 60 people(spouses included) in the upstairs and it was awesome.  The upstairs has it's own bar, and food service area so it's great for large groups.  We had a violinist and the acoustics were great for that as well.  We got great reviews from all the attendees regarding the food and we'll definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite seafood restaurant in the valley! Good special occasion restaurant.. I have been here three times for birthday celebrations. The blue point oysters on the half shell are awesome! We have had the king crab and the full Lobster both are meaty and tasty. Plus you get a birthday dessert.. go you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Visiting from San Diego and wanted some good sea food. Found Bluewater on line and what as great place. Our Server Cat was fantastic, she made the dining experience one I will not soon forget. Her knowledge of and enthusiasm in explaining the menu was phenomenal. The food was exceptional Sashimi, Crab Legs, Steak, Trout, Oysters, and Flourless Cake finished us off. We will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Blue water grill (Fish market) has alwys been a favorite sushi spot of mine. Fabulous staff and you cannot beat the sushi happy hour deals!!"}
{"text":"We have driven past this place a million times and finally tried it. The service was great. Food was even better. Dessert could need some help though. Overall I would eat at this place again. Price was very reasonable for the quality"}
{"text":"We do enjoy Bluewater !! Everything is fresh: fish, oysters Rockefeller!, even the sushi.  We've had dinner a number of times over the last few years, as well as a few happy hours and even a small birthday cocktail party.   Drinks are often custom made for my peccadilloes!   Now for my big but... if memory serves, i'd rate it 2.5 dollar signs for how much our check always turns out... tho I did see $$ is up to $30, but it seems like it hurts for at least 2.5 !!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Bluewater Grill...and it was amazing...Starting with our sweet, attentive and very knowledgeable server, Maddie.  First off, great cocktails, amazing classic oysters Rockefeller, the Barramundi was cooked to perfection, the sides were perfect as well...the highlight was the scallop dinner...just...WOW!  We finished off dinner with the key lime pie... All the while being so taken care of by the amazing Maddie...5 star service for sure.  Thankyou Maddie for being so sweet, and for making us feel at home.  It was a very enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"The San Francisco Cioppino is an incredible dish,  I rarely get anything else when I go to Bluewater.  Wait staff is always on point.  I recently ordered a steak that came out over done, and the manager came back with a perfect cooked steak and took it off my bill, total class.  I wasn't even upset but he took care of me.  I love this place."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying that the entry into the restaurant are wood planks that are unsteady and need repair.  Make sure you assist any elderly walking up to the entrance.  For appetizers we had fried calamari, which were a bit over cooked but good flavor.  The bucket of steamed mussels and clams were excellent as were the crab cakes.  The bad was that we did not get any of the delicious sour dough bread until after we were done with our appetizers.  Not the fault of our server.  The kitchen was behind and did not have enough available.   I had the sand dabs which had some of the skin still on and gave them a sour taste.  My son had the Cajun Swordfish, which was outstanding.  My daughter had the Mahi Mahi over risotto which she loved and my folks shared the fresh Halibut, which they thought was great also.  For dessert, everyone had the crepe brûlée, which was excellent.  The service was slow to start but improved once our server realized we were downing iced tea and water rapidly.  As far as the iced tea, it was $3.75, which I think is ridiculous.  Other than that, pricing is about what you would expect.  Overall, the food was good and we will definitely go back, but will not bring back mom and dad until they repair or replace the wooden walkway."}
{"text":"When my husband and I moved to Arizona two years ago, we were skeptical that we would find good sea food. I certainly didn't expect one of my favorite restaurants here to serve sea food, but how wrong I was!  We've been here numerous times since finding the Bluewater Grill this past winter. We also make a point to take all of our out of town visitors here; it's by far one of our favorite places to eat in the valley. The staff is friendly and also very knowledgable about their dishes. They are always happy to provide recommendations when asked and to date haven't been wrong.   My husband and I have had tried a variety of things on the menu and don't have a disparaging word to say about a single dish. Their clam chowders, both the New England and Manhattan are superb. The Oysters Rockefeller is one of our favorites and the oysters on the half shell have always been very fresh and tasty. My husband typically gets the lobster, while my current favorite is their Barramundi dish. It is cooked to a delicate perfection, although every fish dish I've tried has been cooked well and very good.  We haven't tried the sushi, but the fish market selection always looks great and I haven't heard anything but good things about it from fellow patrons. We prefer to sit at the bar and have always heard good feed back from fellow customers. On that note, they have solid bar and cocktail menu as well. Would definitely recommend it. We drive from the west valley regularly to feast!"}
{"text":"My go to place for fish. No matter what seafood I eat it's great. I take out of town guests here and they love it too"}
{"text":"The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful in the decision making process - there were many options that looked good and I always have trouble deciding on what to eat at a new restaurant.   I shared the Baked Crab & Artichoke Dip and the Phoenix Roll with my party and they were both delicious. I especially liked the different types of chips used to serve the dip. The portions for the roll were also very large, so sharing with someone else was not a problem."}
{"text":"The meal was excellent especially the raw oysters.  The service was outstanding as well.  Robb S."}
{"text":"Clam Chowder is to die for! the food and the service couldn't be better. i will definitely be coming again. i made a reservation and arrived 10 minutes before and the table was ready."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! Oysters and sushi are so delicious. Great customer service and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yet again, service and food was on point!! Graciously greeted by the manager opening the front doors for us, as napkins covered the hot handles. Smiles on all the staff which really sets the tone for a great night. We were greeted promptly by our server I think Clinton.. He was great!!!  He didn't miss a beat!! My mom got the clam chowder (she says the best in AZ) and the fisherman's platter and I got oysters and the Halibut. All were wonderful. This is honestly- the best seafood you will find in Arizona. So good in fact that we plan on coming back next week with the whole family"}
{"text":"I have not been here since they changed the name. I always liked it before and i think it is even better now. The fish was wonderful i got Mahi Mahi and my date got scallops and shrimp skewers.. All wonderful! We had lump crab appetizer. Wonderful wine, Liberty School Cabernet i really recommend it! Everything smelled good. Even the bread was fresh from the oven.  The only off thing was we were at a nice quiet table and they sat a group of 4 middle age men next to our table. Men when they are out together are very loud. Don't put a couple next to a loud group. Other than that fab!"}
{"text":"Decent place to eat for a nice lunch. I didn't find it to be anything super out of the ordinary but the service was good and the grilled artichoke is a dish worth mentioning."}
{"text":"Outstanding.   We just made the 8 hour drive from Angel Fire, NM to Phoenix, and we were dying for some great food.  Great atmosphere, and to top it off John (Murphy) at the oyster bar took care of us. Great, fast service with wonderful food quality.   Doesn't matter of you want appetizers,  entrees,  or the  sushi bar...everything is good."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for some delicious seafood, this is the place for you. I've become a fan of Bluewater Grill and love exploring their dietician-recommended healthy options. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very pleasant and versatile. I've come here for both date night out on the town, as on a normal weekday dinner during a hot summers day in a t-shirt and shorts.   My favorite entrees are the Roasted Salmon with King Crab Salad ($26), Alaskan King Crab 1¼ LB ($55) and my favorite sushi roll, the Señorita Roll ($15) and Oysters. The lobster comes in its full shell form and glory, so be prepared to put on the bib and get your hands dirty. If you can't get enough of sushi, you absolutely have to try their Señorita Roll. It's simply amazing, and order it every time. It is pricey for a sushi roll, $15, but it's worth every penny.   If you enjoy a good cocktail like I do, you're in luck here. I have not had one drink that I did not love! Feeling like a margarita? Try the Serrano Margarita and the Pilikia Margarita. The Cucumber Mojito is great during the summer, obviously. My partner loves drinks with St. Germain Elderflower liqueur, so he always orders the 'Violetta (Vodka, fresh lime, and pineapple juice, St. Germain Elderflower, Crème de Violette, Luxardo Maraschino liqueur). The waiters have always been so attentive and do not disappoint. Will continue to keep coming here."}
{"text":"Went to blue water grill last night for date night. I wish the ambiance was as cool as the blue sign you see from hwy 51. Was kind of cafeteria-ish, so we sat in the bar like we usually do. Server was nice enough, no complaints, no praise. Sherry's barramundi was very moist and tender with good flavor. Calamari was tender as well as the clams in my chowder. If your looking for a place with lots of tv's and red lobster style cuisine with a little bigger price tag, this could be your spot. My favorite part was the real mounted great white on the wall."}
{"text":"The service is great!  The menu selection excellent! The food presentation and quality wonderful!"}
{"text":"First time at Blue Water Grill. Definitely will be back. Ben at the oyster bar took care of us and he made our night awesome. Thanks Ben! The cioppino, oysters, chowder and lobster were great and the service was even better !!"}
{"text":"Food is great drinks where good. Prices are steep But I enjoyed my time and our server was good"}
{"text":"Went there with a couple of friends. Went on the recommendation of a local and we were very pleased. Had some sushi I can't remember the name of but I think senorita and las vegas were in there. One of the friends had calamari. All the food was above average and we were pleased. I would easily go again.  But what really made the meal was the waitress. She was helpful, friendly, there when we needed her but not overbearing. Her recommendations on sushi were spot on. So above average food and a great waitress made for an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"this place was just OK the rock fish really had no flavor the seemed vegtbles were over cook but tasted good service was OK he was training someone I will go back to try something else maybe"}
{"text":"Not bad, though I expected more for the prices they're charging.  Great warm sourdough bread that went well with the creamy New England clam chowder ($5.95).  Water was kept filled.  Waitress was knowledgable and friendly, though a little overbearing.  I ordered the tilapia ($15.95) and it was just fine.  It tasted a little muddy, but not nearly as bad as (for example) catfish I've had in the past, and it definitely was better than Olive Garden's.  I didn't try it with its sauce since I don't care for lemon (or capers).  The accompanying French fries were hot and crisp, and much better than the cold (not even lukewarm) cheddar mashed potatoes (hopefully those will be better as leftovers).  The manager was very pleasant, and I admire that he was out working on the floor.  Considering their high price point, I don't know if I'll be back.  Maybe for lunch one day?  Or if someone really wants to buy me crab or lobster?  Parking was plentiful but the spaces are striped a little close together, and it got a little congested when multiple people were trying to get in and out at the same time."}
{"text":"Great food always fresh. I take clients at least twice a week. We love sitting at the bar because of Christi. She always remembers our names and her service is wonderful."}
{"text":"We started off with a half dozen Oysters on a Half Shell and they were delicious.  They were so good that we contemplated getting six more but didn't because we wanted to try their Clam Chowder.  I am not sure which one it was but it was the cream kind.  This was my first time ever having clam chowder and I loved it.  For dinner I had the Fire Grilled Mahi Mahi which was in a creamy herb, leek and ramano risotto, white wine rapini, olive oil poached shallots, garlic heirloom cherry tomatoes and balsamic syrup.  The dish in a whole worked very well togeather but my fish was a little over cooked.  My husband got the Pan Seared Pacific Rockfish which had a roasted red bell pepper polenta, golden tomatoed and Tuscan kale, and was finished with a citrus burre blanc and pancetta lardons. Suffice to say there was not much left on his plate when he was done.  This was not the first time we were here and it will not be the last!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the best seafood restaurant! I ordered the sea scallop, cioppino, barramundi, and wild prawn linguine. All of them are above par!! These are the must tries here. I would especially recommend the barramundi and cioppino with traditional white wine sauce. Their white English clam chowder is super amazing!! Our server, Cat, was super attentive, helpful and friendly. She is the best!!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. Not once and I've been many times. Love the mediterranean ahi salad, cedar plank salmon. There was a stupendous scallop entree on the menu a year or so ago that was a-mazing. Prices aren't really cheap but it's seafood so kinda expected and an excellent option if that's what your after."}
{"text":"Great selections of fresh raw oysters here.  We ordered pretty much every raw oyster dish on the menu, and the best one is Washington's Chef Creek oyster.  Their stuffs are definitely fresh and the only thing that I have an issue with is their raw cherrystone clams, which is not purged completely so we got a bit of sands in the meat.  I would be more than happy to give a 5 star rating if the cherrystones were prepared professionally."}
{"text":"Excellent casual dining experience for my hubby's birthday. He loved the cippino and the salmon was awesome too. Tasty little chocolate cookie topped with ice cream for birthday."}
{"text":"We met our son for New Years and had a FANTASTIC meal in most part thanks to Sam...the most attentive, helpful and personable waitress I have had in forever!  She welcomed us as if we were family, she served us ensuring we were satisfied with every aspect of our meal and followed up ensuring the fact.  Although we have been here before we felt as we were welcomed back with open arms and Sam was a major part of it....her smile was illuminating and welcoming.  I know the next time I waltz thru the door the first words out my mouth is please show me to Sam's section"}
{"text":"I gotta give this place another try .. Only been once!    I ordered fa few oysters during happy hour and a lunch special.  Nothing special about either of the two.  The 4 star rating makes me feel like I should give it another try"}
{"text":"This fish restaurant ( I think they may have some meat- check I've never eaten anything but fish here) fish monger establishment is great, informal ( unless you call to eat upstairs) great, Lobster, sand dabs, salmon, tuna, scallops, oysters, crabs, steamers, etc. The food is stellar! They even have special events going on, we went to a New. England Clambake $50 ( Maine lobster, clams, corn, potato, and coleslaw) for the meal including a glass of wine. It's always busy, so you know the fish is fresh.  If you care to you can buy fish from the market area in the front of the restaurant across from the bar.  The bar has happy hour specials , that's drinks and seafoods!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this took me so long to review, I first dined here back in May and was instantly in love! When I moved to Phoenix I was really sad that I would probably be missing fresh seafood more than anything, but Bluewater Grill has it, and it is on point! I've had mahi mani, snapper, and a couple other fishes, all fantastic. The mahi special with risotto is my personal favorite. I've also dined at the sushi bar a few times (happy hour every day 3-6) and would say they have the best sushi I've personally had, and the chef is very nice. Oysters on the half shell, delicious as well. You also have the option to purchase market fresh fish from the restaurant, which I keep forgetting but is definitely on my list. If you're someone who fishing and fresh seafood are important to you, and found yourself somehow in the desert, you won't be disappointed by this restaurant. It's also my go to place to bring visitors from out of state."}
{"text":"Great cocktails! Showed up right before close and still received amazing service. Love this place!"}
{"text":"So so so so awesome....words can not describe, you must go and try for yourself.  Start off with the chowder and it keeps getting better with each item every item. If you want to save $ check out their Happy Hour menu.  WooHoo"}
{"text":"Have been here now about 5 times and every time the food and service has been great. Having a Raw bar, Sushi bar and Dining room gives you great options plus the regular bar too. They always heve happy hour specials and make good drinks."}
{"text":"The Bluewater Grill is one of those strange places I should go to more often as it's right in my hood, but no one I hang with ever mentions it. Is that because it's solid, but not shout out loud great?  Maybe so.  One disclaimer: on this trip I wasn't my usual starved self, which can make a big difference on how good food tastes..so you never know, it could have been a 4 if I was hungrier.   We got the oysters, which aren't my fav thing, but my lovely lady liked them a lot. A LOT. Next was some crab cakes which were pretty tasty I must say. The baked mussels were ok, but far from the best ehhh-va. A bit too garlicky for me. By now I'm getting pretty full, but  still had the Sunshine sushi roll beaming it's way into my future. It was not bad, but not great either. The taste was a bit bland but the texture was somehow an interesting mix of soft and crunchy.   Side note. This place plays GREAT MUSIC and does have decent decor.  Surprised how current and cool the music was with stuff from Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, Gregory Alan Isokov among others.   Definitely worth checking out, but the jury is still out if it's worthy of being in the regular rotation."}
{"text":"Wanted to have some seafood so I decided that this place would be a good option.  The food was good but nothing special for the price. This restaurant has been in the valley for awhile and I expected it to be a little better. The food was fresh however I wouldn't make this my next seafood choice."}
{"text":"Pros- We rsvp thru Yelp app and even though we arrived early we were seated immediately.  Very nice drink menu. Food tasted fresh.  Con- decor seemed outdated. It's a seafood only restaurant, and the menu strictly adheres to that making for limited choices. Service was a little slow."}
{"text":"Just had a Father's Day lunch here with my daughter.  The food was great and the service was impeccable.    Clifton was a fantastic waiter."}
{"text":"Great restaurant sit at the bar when you walk in the door, great service and food was amazing. Ben is awesome and very talented chief. He is at the bar when you walk in the door."}
{"text":"I recently went there again because I want to use their birthday certificate, $10 value off for everything on your bill including alcohol.  You must spend at least $10 before you can apply that $10 credit to your bill.  Make sure you join their E-Crew mailing list.  I ordered Burger Slider because I want to find out how good their fries are, and I must say, the fries was very delicious.  It's very crispy and in big chunks.  Ketchup was the only sauce available to go with this dish; Next dish was the Fish Tacos.  It used to be $5 for two, now it's $6 for two, I think it's a big jump, but it was very tasty and good.  I don't mind paying for more, but I like the size to be a little bit bigger, I finished my taco in less than 3 bites each; Last dish was the fried calamari.  I lope the two special sauces, one of them was the Thai Chili sauce.  The texture of the calamari was improved, but the serving size is still not enough.  I washed everything down by ordering a Blue Moon draft, the glass was iced cold and the beer was refreshing.  My server was Kelly and her attitude was great and service was excellent.  It wasn't very busy as Happy Hour was just started before I got there.  If you want freshness and great service, you have to go to Bluewater Grill.  And make sure you sign-up for the mailing list for your $10 coupon on my birthday month."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous lunch  last Saturday!! The mahi mahi risotto and the jasmine rice bowl were delicious but the grilled octopus takes the prize!!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been back here for almost 20 years and was afraid it was closed as I couldn't find the old name, \" The Fish Market\". I drove over for happy hour and it was the same excellent seafood and the service was spot on."}
{"text":"I'll  start by saying that I don't like seafood.   However the brick chicken is tasty!  We also like the happy hour and ambience.  My husband does like fish..and enjoyed his food."}
{"text":"I love this place, plus the server Sean was so amazing and dealt with multiple complaints like a champion and his manager also dealt with us like a trooper! Thank you so much bluewater grill, I know you were having a rough night and thank you for being so accommodating with our group it means a lot. Every time I've been here problems were dealt with so reasonably and I can't thank you enough! I only order sushi and I've been nothing but impressed, their sushi is Amazing!!  I recommend this place in every way. Xoxo"}
{"text":"I stopped by here yesterday to have lunch with a vendor.  I will start out by saying this place is really good.  I ordered a pasta dish with pesto sauce, scallops and shrimp.  I must say that dish was really tasty and I loved it a lot.  The bread was good too.  I wish the butter was a tad bit warmer making it a bit easier to spread, but that is splitting hairs.  The butter and bread was a good combo with the almost Italian like dish.  I wanted to order a appetizer but did not want to make the vendor spend a lot of money for lunch.  We will be back for sure.  I want to try their fish and chips too and that will be next."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for some fish yesterday so I decided to give Bluewater a shot.  The food was tasty, though nothing really blew me away.  The dining area of Bluewater is perfect for a mid-range seafood restaurant.  It's clean, the fresh fish display is a nice touch and the bar area is well put together.  This place definitely doesn't have the faint scent of despair and broken dreams that always seems to be present at Red Lobster.  The staff was attentive and polite.  Our server had a great grasp of the menu and was able to answer any questions we had.  Food was delivered at the perfect pace, with nothing feeling rushed.  I bet that the appetizers here really shine.  I got the Prawn cocktail, which was very tasty.  The prawns were fresh and the cocktail sauce had just a hint of kick to it.  For an entree I got Ahi Tuna, nice and rare.  The fish was tasty, though the tuna steak was much thinner than I'm used to.  I enjoyed the sides as well.  Sauteed spinach doesn't get much better than this.  My only gripe, and it's a minor one, are the prices.  The food was good, but it just didn't feel... right to pay as much as I did.  It was good, but it didn't seem to be THAT good.  Maybe it's just me, but there seemed to be a slight disconnect between the price and the product.  I will definitely give Bluewater another shot, most likely during either happy hour or for the clambake."}
{"text":"I ordered a to-go order of the scallop appetizer and the wedge salad Both items were packed nicely in separate containers and traveled well. The price was right and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, but the bar tender sucked!!!! He's Caucasian and I'm African-American. I noticed he greeted, talked to and interacted with all other customers, accept me. He didn't even speak, just handed me my menu and asked for my drink order. Usually I'd leave a crappy tip, but you don't fight ignorance with ignorance. Next time I come, I'm going to get a table instead of sitting at the bar"}
{"text":"Had dinner here to celebrate my new job. Waiter Christopher, knew the menu extremely well. My date is from Seattle and is therefore leery of seafood here. She got the steak and it was amazing. I had the mahi mahi and it was delicious as well. Wine also did not disappoint. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday, no wait time for 7 of us to get seated. The Main Lobster Roll is a must since I find myself craving it often. Casual atmosphere, although parking can be a little bit of a challenge depending on the day. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I went for Valentines Day dinner. We were seated in the back room that was almost empty with zero ambience. I felt like I was sitting at the kids table. In hindsight I should've requested to move. We've only been here a couple of times and now I remember why we've only been here a couple of times. Nothing to write home about, a doz. oysters on the half shell, two fish entrees and a bottle of San Pelegrino water and was just a hair under a hundy! With being landlocked here in Phoenix, I guess I was expecting more. Their restaurant in Newport is much better in terms of food quality and ambience."}
{"text":"We had a disappointing experience the first time we ate at Bluewater Grill and it was primarily with the staff.  We decided to try it again and were very glad we did.  The staff was very professional and accommodating.  The food, as with our first visit, was very good.  It was a perfect evening from start to finish and we look forward to returning again soon."}
{"text":"My family and I used to come here many years ago when I was a kid. I recently just came back for Arizona restaurant week and everything was so great!!   Our server was really nice and tended to our needs. The food was absolutely amazing! I got the oysters, grilled scallops, creme brûlée & key lime pie. Seriously delicious."}
{"text":"The food here is incredibly delicious! I ordered the Salmon and I was very impressed! I will mention that this restaurant is on the pricier side, but I think it's worth it for the quality of the food served!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner there and was fairly satisfied.  The service is good but the meal was just okay.  I thought we were in time for Happy Hour, so we ordered a wine and a cocktail only to find out the Happy Hour is only in the bar, not in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Decided to treat my wife and I to dinner, so we walked into the restaurant and stopped at the hostess stand She said she could seat us at a booth or we could sit anywhere in the bar area which had a few people there well..... after 15 minutes of waiting and multiple bar employees walking past us without stopping to ask if we have been helped. So we decided to leave but stopped at the hostess stand to talk with the manager who didn't seem to care. I wouldn't even give this place one star I hope anyone who goes there has better luck that I did"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!!! Such wonderful food and service. I loved it so much that I planned a dinner at the one in Newport shortly after. Best salmon I've ever had and the sides were DELICIOUS! Definitely craving the polenta weeks later!"}
{"text":"I've had seafood better from a food truck. Horribly overpriced for bad quality plates."}
{"text":"It was a nice surprise to find a good fish house in Phoenix. The ambiance was typical fish house as though you walked in from the beach. Nothing special, but the food and the service absolutely fantastic. An overall excellent experience. The only thing that was missing was the ocean and sand!  Loved it !"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday celebration. The value of the meal for the price was very poor. I've eaten here quite a few times, but it has been about 7 months. Thank goodness the clam chowder was the same but the $8 small water glass drink - not worth it, the $13, 5 shrimp cocktail appetizer - not worth it and my 4/shrimp/2/scallop skewer with fried polenta and green beans for $23 - not worth it or my son's San Francisco Cioppino for $25 - definitely not worth it. The birthday dessert was a brownie with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce drizzled on it which was fine. But the waitress didn't even bring it, someone from the kitchen brought, stuck a candle in it, lit it and left. We just sat there looking at each other.  Another table had a birthday and their waitress actually brought them their dessert and sang! By far the worst meal and experience we've ever had here."}
{"text":"Good food but a little on the expensive side.  If you like sushi and jalapenos, get the JJ's Peppers."}
{"text":"We decided to give Bluewater Grill another try (our very first visit to this restaurant was kinda disappointing on 6/12/16).  We had dinner at Bluewater Grill last night (9/24/16).  This time, the food was outstanding!  The mussels, swordfish and barramundi tasted amazing!  The bread pudding dessert was also delicious.  Great food, great service (Kelly is fantastic).  Thank you Jeff for inviting us back.  We will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley for years. Had a beautiful dinner last Sunday celebrating my Fathers 79 Birthday. Only one problem, they forgot it was his birthday even though i meet with staff and hostess prior to Dad getting there. And with the small crowd it was even more surprising. In closing I would recommend them again, just wished my Fathers birthday could have been a little more special.           Greg Olea"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great staff, great food. Their happy hour is great and the sourdough bread is the best. I love sitting at the oyster bar, especially when Mark is working. Try the señorita roll or the crab Louie salad. Can't go wrong! Pictured is the Bluewater Roll. Perfection."}
{"text":"Great offerings. This place used to be the Fish Market. Same store owners, same California parent owners.  Fish is fresh, and there is still a market in the front. Protip, get the moscow mule, it's served in a copper mug, the proper way. And get the fish.  Bring lots of money when going to Bluewater Grill. While they try to portray themselves as casual, the reality is that a dinner for two easily surpasses $100."}
{"text":"Excellent! Best seafood in Phoenix. We were seated right away. Couldn't have had better service between the waitress, manager and hostesses. The food was fresh, fast and perfect. Check in deal  for $1 drink"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, great fresh sea food and good drinks. Service is great and kid friendly. I have been to this one and San Diego's and by far they are both great with the same menu. The fish i learned is caught off the same boat and shipped daily to both restaurants. I wish I owned this place!"}
{"text":"Our server Kat was amazing. ..the attention to detail was wonderful.  I  found the whole staff provided excellent service and worked not only together but as a complete team. All the customers around us and on the patio received the same excellent service. We will definitely be back. The Beatles were a nice touch!"}
{"text":"I vote this the BEST Seafood place in AZ..Jeff Martineau,Mgr.is always very accomodating..The staff is awesome and the food is superb. thanks Jeff,Mike and Myke P.S. ask for Nick at the bar"}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner and service ( Cliff) had the crab salad Yummy  and my Husband tried tthe Fish and Chips (loved)  Key lime pie topped it off.  All in all, a great Mother's Day dinner.  Thanks"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that Suzanne alone earned 5 stars, Bluewater is fortunate to have someone that obviously has passion for what she does. Her service to us was excellent and it made our first time at BWG one to remember. Me and my girlfriend came in with the intention of having some oysters but after looking at the menu we also decided to share a lobster roll. The oysters were awesome, we actually ended up getting a 2nd round and will definitely be back when we get the cravings. The lobster roll was honestly ok, nothing too exciting so I don't see us ordering it again."}
{"text":"We visited on Mother's day and had a great time. The clam chowder soup was great and so did all our seafood dinners, we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food was great. I had the sea bass(blackened) with  the coconut jasmine rice and it was amazing !!  There service can be a little better. My server was a little cold, and with this being my first time here as an out of towner, I would've loved someone a little friendly. Still will come back in my next visit!"}
{"text":"Very nice interior. I Love the bar with oyster shooters and the deli and lobster tank!  I'm aware of what fish have the highest mercury, which are substituted and which are lying low on the overfished list. I know what water areas are most polluted and which are not.   I WANT to know the country of origin my fish is from and whether it is wild caught, sustainable or farmed. When I'm paying for something with my own money I make informative decisions and want to know exactly what I'm getting.     They serve the EXACT fish that they have on the menu--NO Substitutes. I think that the majority of consumers aren't aware that restaurants AND grocery stores can serve fill-ins or substitutes for the actual fish and essentially lie about what they are serving. Yeah thanks to our lazy and corrupt USDA.   Excellent service from our male waiter--the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"The bread was really good to start the meal but my crab cakes were just okay.  I was really happy for the drink special from Yelp because that helped ease the pain.  Service was just okay as well.  It took a really long time and the restaurant was really empty."}
{"text":"Thank you Bradley for the attentive service.  I enjoy it when the staff spends time at the table giving us information.  He recommended the wine, and told me what to expect.  Seven Heavenly was the choice.  It was just as wonderful as he predicted.  We went to Bev Mo, next door, after dinner to score a bottle to share with friends.  The mahi mahi was exceptional the saffron rice actually had visible grains of saffron.  Isn't it a great meal when the fresh veggies on the side are also a hit!  We will return!"}
{"text":"We love coming to Bluewater Grill. It's our go-to for fish in the desert. SEAN is a terrific waiter and remembers us and our order week to week."}
{"text":"We love Bluewater Grill. Often we go for happy hour. The food is fantastic, prices are reasonable but Mark (chef in the raw bar) is the star. He is personable, knowledgeable and provides a great customer experience.  This restaurant is also our favorite for entertaining friends. Menu is extensive with many healthy options. Fish is always cooked to order. And the New England clam chowder is the best!!"}
{"text":"I went here for my first time on a Friday at 6pm. We got seated immediately. It wasn't busy at all and business didn't seem to pick up much as the night progressed. That's sad for a Friday night :( our server was nice but lacked enthusiasm for her job. I don't remember her name though.   We were a party of seven and we ordered grilled artichoke, two Mahi Mahi fish plates, two grilled trout plates, one breaded trout plate, one snapper plate, and one kids fish and chips.  Stuff I tried and my opinion: -The bread: the sourdough bread was good. Just the perfect amount of crunch on the outside and soft on the inside.  -The grilled artichoke was okay. It was bland and boring.  -Mahi Mahi plate: it was decent. The fish just needed some salt and more flavor. I was not a fan of the vegetables. There were barely of any of them and they didn't taste good. They were too sour. It was on top of a creamy risotto which was very different for me considering the fact that it was my first time trying it. It was good though! -The breaded trout had some type of almond breading. That was different but I liked it! The mixed vegetables were crunchy and fresh. The cheesy mashed potatoes were BOMB! I could eat a full plate of that!   For all these 7 plates, 1 appetizer, 1 beer, and five beverages, it costed over $215.   I have mixed feelings about this place. I don't know if I'll ever come back or not."}
{"text":"My wife and I had Valentines dinner here. We were seated at a back room with few people and with zero ambience. I felt like I was sitting at the kids table. In hindsight I wish I had asked to be moved. The food and service were nothing to write home about. A dozen oysters on the half shell, two fish entrees and a bottle of San Peligrino  water set us back $90! So many other restaurants in the valley that are far much better for the $. We had only been here once before and now I remember why."}
{"text":"The tuna sushi rolls were great and the Australian fish that started with a b was good too. The service was amazing'"}
{"text":"My wife and I were craving some really fresh fish and didn't feel like driving 6 hours to California. We decided to give this place a try and were not disappointed. The best part is that the drive from our house was only about 10-15 minutes and there is a TW&M next door. Yes!  This location used to be The Fish Market many moons ago and and the upstairs was a separate restaurant. We always enjoyed eating here in the past and forgot all about this place until now. The upstairs is no longer a restaurant and it is used specifically for big parties and larger groups. Downstairs is relatively the same with the their fresh Fish for sale up in the front and several different seating areas to enjoy your meal.  The first thing we did was to check out the fish case. My wife really wanted Walleye and yours truly was wanting try something different. We both went with the pick a fish and two sides from the menu since we were not wanting anything fried. The rest of the menu offers several items that would please just about any restaurateur.  We started with an appetizer and picked the Seared Scallops served with a tamari glazed bacon, kaiware sprouts and wasabi aioli. It was so good we could not stop sopping up the drizzles on the plate with their complimentary sour dough bread. I'm going try making that dish at home.  My wife next ordered the Canadian Walleye that was lightly floured and cooked on the griddle. She picked the Herb and Goat Cheese Polenta and the Red Quinoa Salad for her sides. I went with the grilled Australian Barramundi which is a type of Sea Bass with the Herb and Goat Cheese Polenta and some Sautéed Summer Squash and Kale. Both plates were thoroughly delicious and we couldn't stop talking about how good and fresh they tasted.  Service was EXCELLENT and very friendly. We were seated next to the kitchen and could see the chefs cooking the fish and other dishes. Our server went out of her way and did a fine job answering our many questions as well as making sure we were enjoying our meals. She even said we could sneak upstairs and take a quick look if we curious on how it looked today. Cool!  Going to step out on a limb and say this was some of the best fish we have had in the PHX area and the prices were very reasonable as well. San Diego would have been our first choice but who has the time and money for that on a Saturday. Definitely coming back here again for a meal and would also like to try grilling some of their fresh fish at home. YUMTASTIC!  4.75 STARS"}
{"text":"3.5* I've been to Bluewater a couple times now, and I've had some great food and some that's been so-so.  Our first visit I had the pan seared scallops and my buddy had the miso salmon.  We both really enjoyed our meals, not to mention killer oysters rockefeller and sourdough bread! Our last visit (in addition to the aforementioned oysters and sourdough of course) I tried the prawn and scallop skewer and my buddy tried the chinook.  Now, to me anyway, prawn=BIG shrimp U-15 like. But alas, these were more akin to 21-25.  The food was not hot when I got it which definitely detracted from the dish.  The chinook was average. So, in closing I'd say oysters, chowder and bread will probably be my next meal at Bluewater, never been disappointed in those."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service was fantastic. We all ordered crab legs and I may be bias since crab is my favorite but I loved it. Everything was great about the place. Definitely will be back in the future."}
{"text":"We have been here quite a few times, and have NEVER been disappointed! I love this place! The best seafood place I've been to so far in Arizona.  The fish is flown in daily and is fresh. You can take advantage of their fish market-so many delicious options. (All the fish they serve, you can buy) Aside from the food-the waiters/waitresses are all wonderful! Today, we had the best waitress! Kat (or Cat) is so knowledgable, patient, and listens to exactly what you want. She knows her stuff and is detailed oriented! We never had to ask for anything-she was right on top of it all! Thank you for making our night great! And we will be seeing the Bluewater Grill again! :)"}
{"text":"Was a wonderful dinner. Our server was spectacular and the food was cooked perfectly! The reservation option I used in Yelp app was so perfect. You have really made this the only go to destination app for me."}
{"text":"trés bon poisson bien cuisiné..cela change des burgers..déco \"bateau\" sympa , service souriant"}
{"text":"I love this place. I come for lobster at-least once a week and always leave feeling happy and satisfied! I'm from New England, so this is basically the only place in AZ I would go for seafood.  The service is exceptional- Ben took care of me today and I ordered the clambake and some oysters. He made me a special that was his own creation--a grilled oyster with onions, garlic, and Parmesan cheese. It was phenomenal. The chef also came out and gave us a tasting of this delicious albacore. It was phenomenal!   The best cooked oysters and albacore tuna I've ever had. Ben recommended some great wine pairings as well, and honestly u can't get a better food and dining experience than the Bluewater Grill."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with co-workers. We ordered calamari and various sushi rolls (5 total). A few simple rolls, and 2 or 3 special rolls. The calamari was wonderful, along with the dipping sauces. However, it took an incredibly long time to receive the sushi rolls. The only reason I mention this is because we arrived soon after the restaurant opened, so there were not many people to wait on. We had to make a meeting so we were rushing at the end to get the checks and pay. I would still recommend this place, despite the service."}
{"text":"The food is great.  The warm bread at the beginning rocks.  The cocktail offerings are interesting and well executed.  The fish served is clearly of fantastic quality.  My lobster roll was delicious (and I was worried about it because lobster rolls are often utilized to get rid of the crap parts) as was my cocktail.  I tasted a friend's sushi and it was fantastic - again, unique combinations and well executed.    Here's where it falls down for me: the decor and complete lack of ambiance.  I was here when it was The Fish Market and I swear they haven't changed much, if anything.  It feels like you're in a low rent Red Lobster.  The old wood grain everywhere, the fish on the walls... it all just smacks of the cheesy pirate seafood restaurants depicted in 80's movies.    Location-wise, it's adjacent to the Esplanade area and it was half-empty at 7 p.m. on a Friday night.  I think they're missing out on a lot of business because the food just doesn't match the experience of dining there.  I think if they renovated the inside with a sleeker, sexier less-feeling-like-a-pirate-might-jump-out-at-you, this could really be something special."}
{"text":"Passionate about seafood and fish?  You have found a new home.  Family owned and managed buy PEOPLE (not a large corporation or investment fund); Bluewater Grill is PASSIONATE about your food.   Bluewater knows where your food comes from, do you, do other restaurants know where their food comes from other than just a large freezer in some warehouse?   Jeff the Manager of Bluewater Grill knows where the food comes from, he and his owners know the people, boats and processes to deliver you a world class fishy experience.  Every possibility has been has been investigated and questioned to make sure the food that they serve to you has been thoroughly prepared with care, love and perfection.    I could go into the most succulent fresh natural tuna I have ever experienced & swordfish captured alive so that it doesn't end up fighting for its life stressed, tough and dry on your plate.  Yes people that is why your normal swordfish experiences ends up tough, dry and bitter.  This is not normal and you should avoid anywhere that serves a dry, tough and bitter swordfish.   Go somewhere where the staff and owners want you experience perfection.   However, I would expect you to do some research, read the rest of the reviews, reserve a table and experience seafood in a whole new wonderful taste explosion.    I have never been so intimate with my fish!   I have never had such a wonderful experience as you will when you are served by people who are passionate about bringing you the best seafood.  I am already planning 2 more trips this month. Don't forget this is not just a sit down restaurant, they provide take home service and a FRESH FISH MARKET STORE inside as well.    For larger parties they have 2 private areas downstairs or a huge 100 seater private function room upstairs complete with summer room with view of the mountains, open air balcony, bar and private kitchen for you and your guests to see how everything is prepared."}
{"text":"I love the food there , it's reasonably priced and fresh!! also i love the servers who work on the patio especially because they took great care of our dog and even had a doggie menu ! It's was nice to be able to go out to eat with my fur baby since alot of places don't allow animals. But Bluewater grill is definitely the place to go on a nice date or if you wanna bring your four legged friends!"}
{"text":"Once again, NO disappointments ! Wife had the Surf & Turf which can be 'iffy' in most places here in Phoenix,,,,as in one or the other will be ok, but rarely both. She cleaned her plate ! Actually had a good 8oz tail instead of those little, petite, pre frozen things at most places. Service was perfect. The place was busy, but not packed & noisy I had my whole-belly clams and was not disappointed. This is our go-to seafood place.  I think it's a bit pricey, but I am used to little seafood joints back in the Northeast and can't expect them to match those considering shipping cost to get fresh seafood out to this place.....LOL. I really don't think you will find better seafood anywhere else in town."}
{"text":"CHRISTY provided, hands down, the best service at a restaurant I have ever experienced. She went out of her way to make sure we had the best experience possible at each opportunity and was completely genuine. Food was absolutely prefect and I will be stopping by much more often!! Much appreciated Christy!"}
{"text":"I am from San Francisco Bay Area and have been missing a  fresh seafood place to have a lobster roll or crab sandwich. We placed a order to go for the seafood plater & it taste like it was frozen or cooked the day before. 2 shrimp 2 small pieces of cod & dry flavorless scallops. The french fries was the highlight of the platter. It was over priced. Not good. We also ordered The Lobster Roll & crab sandwich. The lobster roll was good but had more spongy lobster claw meat & not enough lobster tail meat. The crab sandwich was good & I love bacon but I wouldn't have it on that sandwich. The sides we had I only liked the Kayle & zucchini. The mashed potatoes had a dirt grit to them like the potatoes wasn't cleaned before cooking. The coleslaw was flavorless very bland. Not good. For 65$ & a 27min drive I will  not eat there again. I gave them 2 stars because the Lobster roll & crab sandwiches was just ok. And if made with a little more love & I dined in to have it made better they would have been AWESOME. If anyone has any other suggestions for FRESH seafood places in AZ please let me know."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for the sushi bar. I've eaten many times in the regular dining area and its always good However, the sushi bar warrants special attention because it's often overlooked. We come here because the sushi is absolutely the freshest in town. The salmon melts in your mouth and the tuna has never had that weird \"metallic\" fishy taste that I've experienced at other, well-known sushi spots. The food here certainly is not cheap, but I think that there is real value knowing that you are getting fresh fish that is priced comparably or lower than most of the other sushi joints around town."}
{"text":"We have always had good food & good service here. My husband loves the red clam chowder & we both love the trout. Our friends enjoyed the blackened salmon & the scallops.  The food is delicious and not overpriced like many others in the valley."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fantastic service, hands down one of the best mid-range restaurants in the Valley."}
{"text":"Excellent! Best seafood in Arizona. We were there Saturday for lunch. The king crab melted in my mouth. Perfectly prepared. We also enjoyed fresh clams and oysters. ( and more)You have to try the blue point oysters. The service was flawless. Thank you to the entire staff.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"I love the Bluewater Grill!  The seafood is very fresh and they have an amazing oyster bar. I love their Manhatten Clam Chowder and calamari.  If you are in the mood for sushi, the Bluewater Grill has an extensive assortment of rolls that are creative and delicious.  It is a great place for Happy Hour - they also run specials throughout the week like half price bottles of wine and half price lobster.  The staff is very friendly and the service is good."}
{"text":"As you can read I don't give any restaurant a 5STAR review; but I really wanted to give Bluewater Grill one...2 Recent visits - one, after dental surgery; got the lunch special; cup of soup & seafood salad...Delish!!! 2nd visit; dinner time; got the choppino; so full of seafood; could only eat 1/4 of the portion...friend got the \"black cod\" on recommendation.  He is very fussy person when it comes to fish.  Definately will be going back; based alone on that fish with Panko breading!!! - YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"This is our first visit to Bluewater Grill, Great food.   My husband had catfish with blackened seasoning and I had to try out the trout rainbow trout. Both of them were delicious, worthwhile coming here to eat. AJ Was our server, she was very attentive and gave us super service. We will come back when we are in town."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for our anniversary.  Walking in a got a little nervous as we immediately got a whiff  a heavy fishy smell.  We then realized that they had a small market in the front of the restaurant.  They sat us toward the back and the place was not very busy.  The restaurant decor kind of reminds you of a Mcgraths.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect at this point.  Our server came over and everything was excellent from that point on.  The service was perfect.  Drinks were tasty, my wife had something with a strawberry mash in it that was great.  A small, but nice selection of craft beer on tap.  Then our dinner came out and it was delicious!  I had the fire grilled mahi mahi and she had the fire grilled barramundi.  I would highly recommend both!  I had them leave off the balsamic syrup on my mahi, which I would recommend to anyone to do the same."}
{"text":"When my friend and I felt like having seafood  one evening, a yelp search led us to this restaurant. We ordered popular staples and everything was very good - a shrimp cocktail with plump prawns and a zesty house cocktail sauce, lobster with the requisite butter dip, fisherman's platter featuring batter-fried scallops, shrimp, and fish. For dessert, we had a decadent creme brulee and an amazing flourless chocolate cake. Our vivacious server did a great job helping us make our choices by providing suggestions and detailed descriptions of various items. And seeing the tempting dishes the other servers were bringing to the other tables made me decide to do a return visit in the near future."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!! The food is fantastic and the staff is the best must be from great management!! Happy hour is so much fun!!  The food has such a East Coast taste to it and one of our favorite places to go!!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem.  Decor: New England style, very nice.  Service: excellent, just the right attention from D'Lynn, no rush or waiting.  Menu:  a wide variety of fresh fish flown in daily.; difficult to decide.  Wine list: good variety of domestic and import wine.    Finally, the food:  OUTSTANDING!!!!  Nice size  swordfish steak perfectly grilled.  Lemon butter with capers and homemade tartar sauce on the side.  Perfectly steamed spinach.  Gooey good smashed potato cheese.  Desert?  The very best key lime pie, we'll never eat it anywhere else.  Plenty of parking, easy to find right next to Total Wine.  This is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar, enjoyed some happy hour bourbon, bunch of delicious inexpensive oysters, sushi, and flash deep fried yellowtail head. Everything was amazingly fresh (we're picky) delicious and an incredible value for what you get. We'll be back. Lesley was a 5 star waitress for us - ask for her if you want to be professionally pampered dining on amazing seafood."}
{"text":"Like most people, I see the sign for Bluewater grill on the 51 and said \"I need to check that place out someday\".  I regret not eating here sooner!  Excellent service and my group had great meals and tasty sides.  We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"My folks get fresh fish from here. Always very excellent tasting. I would recommend this spot to any seafood lovers."}
{"text":"We thought we were meeting at the Fish Market...only to find that the Fish Market had closed...and decided to try Bluewater Grill instead. What the heck!  Bluewater is definitely worth going to for the fish. My mahi-mahi was devine and there were several other choices that had been flown in fresh that day. But really, my favorite part of the meal was the spinach. Call me crazy, but I would go back again just for a vegetable. Sauteed to perfection...not overdone. Even my vegetable-hating friend liked it. Next time we go, I'm going to try and get him to try the grilled artichokes...they looked fabulous!  For dessert, we tried the key lime pie. Wow. Sugar shock. Glad we decided to share a piece. Our server told us it is not usually so sweet...but it does vary since they make it in-house everyday.  Bluewater definitely attracts an older, quieter, more reserved kind of crowd. And my friend, who had just come from the Phoenix Open wearing golf attire, said he felt a little underdressed...wished he had worn slacks and a nicer collared shirt."}
{"text":"The Maine lobster clambake tasting was excellent. Everything was cooked to perfection - lobster, steamed clams, corn on the cob, potato, sour dough bread and of course beverages. Our server Nelsey took good care of us.  Looking forward to going back. Just miss a water view!"}
{"text":"Seafood in Arizona.... you can only expect so much, especially since I come from the East Coast. Given that we are in the middle of a desert, Bluewater Grill met my expectations. Food was fresh, and I was impressed with the variety of fish they have on the menu. However, there was only one lobster left at 5pm on Sunday... bummer. The sourdough bread is REAL sourdough bread, and therefore delicious! Crabcake appetizer was very good, but each crabcake was a bit on the small side. Scallops were good, but they needed a bit more seasoning and/or sear on them. Hubby had the Barramundi... also good. It was very nice of the staff to offer a complimentary, celebratory (wedding anniversary) dessert."}
{"text":"This place was great! Our waiter Nick was very attentive. The scallops, lobster and sushi were excellent. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I received nothing free in order to write this. Paid for great food and exceptional service. This was the Fish Market and is now Bluewater Grill. Great happy hour too!"}
{"text":"Love fresh seafood? This is your spot!   I honestly can say that this is one of the best places for fresh seafood in the Valley. They have a wide variety that changes according to what is fresh/in season and it literally tastes like it is right out of the ocean! Their cocktails are fab as well, they make a MEAN Moscow Mule!   My fiance and I like to sit at the Oyster Bar (shoutout to Mark, he's the best!). Mark always whips up an amazing seared jumbo scallop marinara for me (it isn't on the menu but he is just that much of a rockstar). I honestly crave it! The scallops are like butter, they melt in your mouth. My fiance always gets oysters and by his facial expressions and sounds, it seems that he is in heaven when eating them! Did I mentioned their warm, crunchy sourdough bread? OH MY GAWDDDD, I would come here just for the bread alone! It is SO yum.   They also have a wonderful sushi bar -- LOVE the Phoenix roll! The General Manager, Jeff is so friendly and makes you feel right at home. When we were leaving, the bartender even opened the door for us and told us to have a great rest of the night! It doesn't get much better than that! We will absolutely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Bluewater Grill was Awesome...  Sushi was outstanding, try the Bluewater Roll, Ahi, and JJ Peppers were the best.  Service was excellent ant out waitress Alyssa was great...  Definitely will be back or go to one of there other locations."}
{"text":"Excellent seafood restaurant. Very long list of hand cut fresh fish everyday. We were surprised to see Canadian Walleye on the menu. The calamari was lightly breaded and tender and served with two nice sauces.  The sides were not spectacular - we had cheddar mashed potatoes...kind of dry and tasteless. The green bean almandine was worse."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I drive all the way from surprise to come and eat here as much as we can. We have been coming here for about two years now and we are always greeted immediately, they remember us, and we always have the best service! Katherine has incredible customer service skills! She is extremely professional, and is always so kind. The environment is always welcoming and everyone is always smiling! I tell everyone I know to come here because no matter where you go; the staff, the food, and the atmosphere will never be as extraordinary as the blue water grill! Thank you so much for giving us such an amazing experience every time we come in! :)"}
{"text":"I came here late on a Wednesday while on a business trip to Phoenix.  I sat at the bar since I came alone and even though it was a bit late, the bartender was very pleasant and gave great service.  I had a cup of clam chowder which was okay but lacked a good new england clam chowder flavor.  I also ordered fried scallops which are one of my very favorite dishes and they came quickly and were delicious.  Very large, fresh and cooked in a light crunchy batter.  My only complaint is that I only had 4 or 5 which seemed too few for the price of the entree.  Good beer selection and it came in a nice mug which was ice cold.  Pricey meal but an overall great experience here and I would recommend it for a nice seafood dinner destination!"}
{"text":"My experience at Bluewater Grill was one of the best. To preface the story, my boyfriend and I were planning on going to San Diego, California for our anniversary. Unable to make the trip due to extenuating circumstances, we were unable to celebrate our anniversary. Fast forward one week and he surprises me with a trip to Bluewater Grill, which is a good 25 minutes from home.   Upon entering, I was absolutely flabbergasted. I was immediately transported to San Diego, California's the Fish Market. A place that we went with his parents during one of our many trips. Never have I had a bad plate. Everything was the same, but to be honest, it was even better!   I truly had the best service I've ever experienced. I can assure you that we will only ever go when Kat (cat?) is working. She went above and beyond to provide the best service, practically reading our minds. She happily offered things one would normally be reluctant to ask for. Not only was she sweet, nice, polite, smart, but she was witty as well. Very seldom would I write a letter to a manager regarding spectacular service and this is one of those times (I hope the manager sees this review).   So since the service received 5/5 starts, I would give the food 5/5 stars as well. Although it was a bit on the pricey end, we received the following for $70 (before tip):   1 Spinach Artichoke Dip  2 Specialty Fish Entrees  2 Beers (One was super hoppy and delicious).  1 plate of San Fransisco style sourdough bread (oh.my.god).   We asked for a little sample of the clam chowder and it was perfectly thin with tons of crab meat.   I got the mahi mahi with fennel, spinach, and tomatoes in a beet vinegrette over cheesy risotto. Holy cow! One of the best meals I've ever eaten. Next time I'm going for the miso salmon and artichoke appetizer.   I expected to walk outside and be able to walk over to Seaport village in California.   AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Where to begin, well let's start with the Crab cakes and fried Calamari! Both were excellent choices.  Fresh and oh so good. I loved this place as Fish market. It was one of my favorite places to go. So now as Bluewater Grill they have made it even better.  The appetizers were really good. The fish was firm and fresh, always a good sign. The fish tacos were blackend and really tasty.  T got the Clam Chowder never a good thing for me. But, she thought it was great! The Oysters were really great as well. Great service, nice clean bathrooms.  They were not taking any coupons from some special they had recently. But, we did not have any anyway. Plus there is a Birthday club you can sign up for on line. I have not done that yet. But, I will."}
{"text":"IMHO, the best Seafood in the Valley.  And if it's not on the menu, Tell them what you want and they'll make it for you.  We've been eating there for close to five years now and have never been disappointed.  The food is fantastic, the service is tops and the staff is friendly and they go out of their way to please."}
{"text":"Thank you Jeff for rectifying the incident and making good on your offer. Looking forward to those fried clams"}
{"text":"I have been trying to find a good seafood house that serves good seafood in Arizona since last summer. I have read good reviews and heard good comments regarding this restaurant . However I will have to say that I was greatly disappointment .  coming from An area near the ocean and fresh seafood daily , i didn't find it very good at all. Scallops were way over cooked and fish was just ok. Not enough flavor .our waitress was pleasant and sweet. So I would have to say that the service was the best part of the meal. This is not a restaurant I will be returning to."}
{"text":"Classy place. Go for Happy Hour, (it's all week). Enjoyed the calamari and oysters=YUM. Will try again on a date night."}
{"text":"Wow!  Been wanting to try this place for a long time - what a great experience!  Went at 3 on a Saturday...happy hour special and ate off the lunch menu for those watching their pocketbook.  We started with the lobster dip and I shared the admirals bake and we added a skewer of shrimp.  Absolutely delicious!  The potatoes they serve are little orbs of gold!!!  It's perfect if you don't want to leave overly full.  We cannot wait to head back.  Very very soon!"}
{"text":"I am a little shocked right now. Not only have I not reviewed Bluewater, I somehow even missed posting a review back when the building housed Fish Market! That strikes me as very, very wrong!  I've been coming to this building for fishy meals for a lot of years. And I am sure those memories play into how highly I regard this place.  From the most recent visits -  I can eat my weight in fresh, crusty sourdough bread! The bucket of mussels and clams (which we tend to ask for all clams) is always super tasty (and provides a great broth for soaking into the bread!) Happy hour from 12-5 on Sundays - $4.00 well, wine, draft and several well priced appetizers makes for a fantastic way to day drink, eat yourself stupid and spend a fantastic afternoon without breaking the bank. The raw bar generally has a nice selection, the sushi bar is a-ok. The New England Clam Chowder is the stuff comfort food is all about.  It may not be the swankiest fish house in town. None of the recipes will make you re-think what seafood can be. But it's always fresh, always consistent. Service has always been friendly and the one bad experience I have had here reflects on my own insane family - not the staff, the food or the place. And even the bad experience makes me laugh now.  And writing this review is making me crave the clam bucket and sourdough bread right now!!"}
{"text":"Co-worker brought me to eat some blue point oysters they were by far amazing! Also had clam chowder which was not awful when you've had it fresh from the sea. Def enjoyed the service & ambience. Prices were ridicules thought, however it was worth it."}
{"text":"You'd probably laugh if any Phoenician claimed to have eaten fresh seafood at a local restaurant in town.  And you'd be justified in doing so.  We're 6 hours from the nearest major body of water and the fish we catch in rivers and lakes here in AZ is outsourced or \"farmed\".  So let me put to rest any pretenses of fresh from the water seafood.  I can't make that claim about Bluewater, nor would I try.  But if you're looking for the closest equivalent in the Phoenix metro, this is probably it.  This place actually used to be known as The Fish Market back in the day before they remade it into a restaurant that also retains a seafood market.  There's actually three parts to this place.  There's the market area where you can shop for, weigh, and purchase seafood on display in back.  There's also an oyster bar where you can come by for a drink and have a freshly shucked oyster or two (pretty cool idea for happy hour).  And most prominently, there's the sit down restaurant that has the feel of a more upscale version of Chuy's.  I brought my Mom here for dinner.  She'd been here before, I hadn't.  The mark of a good seafood restaurant is always a good bowl of clam chowder so we started with that.  Good chowder.  Not the best I've had in my life, but probably among the best I've had in the Phoenix area.  For dinner I got the Cioppino with crab, mussels, shrimp,  scallops, and clams in marinara sauce.  The sauce was a little heavy, but the mix of seafood made for a rich broth that helped flavor all of the seafood.  I was stuffed to the gills after both dishes so I skipped dessert.  Prices for this place aren't cheap.  The chowder, cioppino, glass of anchor steam beer, tax, and tip came to about $50.  Pretty much all of the seafood entrees range from $20-$40.  I probably wouldn't eat dinner here very often other than for special occasions.  Though happy hour at the oyster bar would probably be something cool to try.  So bottom-line, if you're a fresh seafood snob and want it straight from the ocean, drive 6 hours west to the California coastline.  But if you're okay with the next best thing here in the desert, Bluewater will probably get the job done."}
{"text":"I love the selection of oysters which are always good.   The clam chowder is delicious.  I had the mahi mahi and it was cooked to perfection.   Great wine list.  Great service."}
{"text":"Cliff was our waiter for the entire evening. We came for happy hour at an early bird hour of 3:30pm. My friends knew the waiters...this is a place where staff turnover is at a minimum and people know you; a good thing. Cliff is knowledgeable and helped us with menu selections. We order wine and he is attentive. The seafood soup is excellent . We order prawns and they're delicious. There are two sauces and we each ate two...they come 5 to an order but we requested an extra. We get oysters that are fried and Battered and I really enjoyed them. I am not a raw oyster fan. If you crave seafood in this land bound city, I highly recommend this place. And Cliff and the wait staff are attentive and know their regular customers. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Best service I've had in awhile.  We were seated quickly, and orders taken. Everyone on staff was so friendly.  Even the chef came out when we were leaving to wish us a Happy new year.  The food is over the top awesome. We had the swordfish and crab crusted cobia, and crab dip. All very good."}
{"text":"First time here, I was underwhelmed by the food. Crabcakes were pretty tasty, but the tilapia and veggies were not good at all. Our server was wonderful, he did a great job. The food was just not worth the price."}
{"text":"I have to say that I love this place. I go during peak times and off peak times as I find myself craving their quality. I am from the Northeast (Boston) so I know seafood. This place has delivered some of the best seafood and a menu to match with a reasonable price point that I can not find anywhere. The management is top notch, servers all know their fish and on top of it, I usually end up buying some fish from their martket to take home as I can't get over their freshness.   If you are looking for a great dining experience that wont break the bank while offering a wide variety of seafood and sushi (and non seafood) options, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants. We have visited a few of their locations and we have never left disappointed. The wine list is good and the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Ok first off I am ok with spending money on food IF ITS GOOD. I ordered the Mahi-mahi... Dry, no flavor, cold & the side it came with was so bitter and tasted sour. They did not do a thing"}
{"text":"Great seafood in Phx? Yes! I took the wife and teen kids here for Mother's Day. My wife and I hadn't been back for 18 years-not because we didn't love it then, but kids do take a lot of your time and we live 30 miles away. We always talked about going back, remembered the great food we had when it was called the Fish Market. Besides the name, it was as wonderful as we remembered. I had rainbow trout - excellent, they even breaded it special for me. Wife had blackened mahi ( she always orders it whenever we go for seafood so she is an expert) - she said it was the best.  Son had crab legs (as usual when I am paying) and he was heads down on it until he finished. Daughter loves California rolls and her bestie who came as well had salmon and a fancy sushi roll. I think it's cool that can get pretty much any kind of sushi and a full menu of seafood entrées. Additionally, you can get fresh seafood to take home. This place is just as fantastic as it always has been. Great service, they redid the inside a little bit and added a wonderful little patio. If you're looking for a snooty eatery this isn't it, But it is not a dive either. Right down the middle, with great food. We vowed to not wait 18 years to go back. I can't wait for Father's Day!"}
{"text":"After some minor surgery I'm very limited on what I can and how much I can eat.  I can, however, have seafood so my friend an I were looking for a place that served simple seafood dishes without a lot of pasta and/or cream sauces.  Bluewater Grill was the perfect place.  It was fairly quiet and nearly empty but it was early on a Thursday evening so that might be way.  Our waitress was very nice although she did mix up my order.  No worries though because I ended up with a better option anyway.  We had the Grilled Artichoke appetizer which was amazing!  I'm going to have to try that at home!  I'd definitely go again especially when I can finally have bread and pasta again because I'd very much like to try the Salmon Crostino!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my networking group and the food here is both fresh and delicious.  I had salmon and it was cooked perfectly, not dry and just the right amount of pink.  YUM!  The mashed potatoes were equally delicious.  Wade at the bar was very welcoming and took really good care of me.  Jeff Martineau, the General Manager, made sure we all had an amazing experience.  I cannot wait to try this place for dinner.  If you want fresh seafood here in the desert, you need to look no further than here,"}
{"text":"We went here because my boyfriend really loves fresh seafood. I was surprised to find a place with such great reviews that wasn't located on the coast. This place did not disappoint. My boyfriend had the halibut which he loved and I had the fish and chips which are guilty pleasure for me. Both of our dishes were delicious! I would have given it five stars except the Keylime pie, for $8, could have been better."}
{"text":"I always have a good time eating at Bluewater Grill. They have good sushi and appetizers (I especially love their calamari) and I've never had a complaint about their food. In addition, service has always been exceptional. I always eat at the sushi bar and the bartenders are awesome. They pretty much do everything! They make the drinks, take your order, shuck the oysters and have time to have a good conversation with you. With that being said, I've had better seafood in other places in the valley, with better prices. They have happy hour, but the prices are still pretty pricey. I'd love to come back and try their other dishes and maybe I could give this place a higher rating!"}
{"text":"I think yelp needs to rethink its $$ on this place. We had a $90 lunch for four, two of the people being children who had $8 kids meals. We didn't order any drinks, so the food is definitely not cheap. That being said, the food was SO delicious!! There is nothing better than FRESH fish! Kudos to Bluewater Grill for having great product--which makes it well worth the price! Our service was on point; Samantha was incredibly knowledgeable regarding the menu and attentive in all the right capacities. We cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"Had Nicole as a server and she is the bomb. (Great customer service). My girlfriend and I had a lunch date here and got sushi and some clams. All the seafood was very fresh and delicious. Spoke with the manager that greeted us when we walked in and he was very generous. They are opening one in Coronado, which is in San Diego. Can't wait to visit when we take our vacations there."}
{"text":"We ate lunch here yesterday, after I had a doctor's appointment in Phoenix. We aren't from the area, and had a few hours worth of road travel to get here.   I chose this restaurant based on yelp reviews, and by the \"best seafood in Phoenix\" award. I also wanted to try oysters for the first time. Bucket list item. Being that this is the desert, I wanted to make sure what I had was fresh! And with the claim of freshness, I thought this was a good choice.  Upon arriving at lunch time, the restaurant was not too busy for a weekday. Decor was decent. We were seated quickly. The waitress came to take our order and I told her it was our first time there. She asked for our drink order. I told her about the yelp well drink offer and brought up the offer on my phone. She looked at it and seemed annoyed. I ordered a mojito and was curtly told that would not count as a well drink. In house beer, wine, basic only. We chose another drink and ordered our other drinks, as well. The waitress left.  We then received our bread. I it was barely warm, stale (not crusty, stale) and the butter was solid. A bad mixture. We ate part of it and were disappointed with it.  The drinks arrived. The offered well drink was quite watered down and not good. Only drank about 1/2 of it.   We ordered our food. I explained that i wanted to try the oysters on the half shell for the first time and was nervous, and what to expect. I asked what choices there were. She told me of two choices. I asked the difference and she told me the difference between the two. I ordered the blue point, a lobster roll with cole slaw and a bowl of chowder.  My other guest ordered chowder, and we split our food.  The chowder was decent. I have had much better. A lot of sand in the clams which was unpleasant and not good for the teeth. I should have said something about it, as it bothered me a lot.  The oysters were fun to try and really good. I could tell they were fresh, and that pleased me. By far the best part of the meal. The lobster roll was ok. The lobster wasn't that fresh and a bit chewy. I have had a lot of lobster in my life, so I know how it should be when it is really good. The bread on the sandwich was a little over grilled. The cole slaw was ok but rather plain. We didn't eat much of it.  Overall a pretty big disappointment, other than the oysters. Service was sorely lacking for such few customers. The lunch came to over $50, which was definitely over priced.   Next time we are in town, I will choose a different restaurant as our food was not worth the cost and we weren't impressed with the service."}
{"text":"Not bad but not great either. Our waiter was amazing,  but the food was just a step up from red lobster in terms of taste and quality. I would return but only if I was being treated.  P.s- the scallops were good"}
{"text":"Blue water sushi roll is delicious and a big portion. Service was just ok. The place is very old and in desperate need of maintenance."}
{"text":"Having lunch again in our favorite seafood restaurant in Arizona and we're very lucky to have the opportunity be served by the ever awesome Cliff. He always provides the best service and a very memorable experience."}
{"text":"Ate here with some coworkers. It was not that busy on a Monday night. We sat in the bar and watched the game whilst we caught up with each other. I had the Seared Eastern Scallops.  Deliciouso! We did not order any apps. The beer was cold and the service was excellent. I had no complaints. One of my buds said his was awesome and he wanted to go back next time he is in town.  Another said his fish (Mahi Mahi Daily Special) was a little dry. I told him to send it back, but he was content despite the fact. I figure if I am paying for a sit down meal with prices higher than a typical chain restaurant that it better be cooked to my liking.  I deducted 1 star because of his comment.  Just an entree and iced tea was over $32+tip.  Lots of TVs in the bar."}
{"text":"This place gets a three because service was great.   Food needs work.  My shrimp was over cooked thus rubbery.   My husband's halibut was dry    Will look for other seafood places"}
{"text":"I make a large to go order once a month for a private party. Every month when I arrive, my order is accurate, ready to go. The manager is very kind and always makes sure I have everything I need. I serve the food at a work function and everyone always wants to know where we order the Sushi and apps. We run out of food every time!  I've been ordering for over a year now and I plan on continuing."}
{"text":"Made a Yelp reservation several days in advance. Received an e-mail confirmation when made the reservation as well as the day of  reservation. Also received 2 text message confirmations day of the reservation. Restaurant, however, had no record of the reservation when we got there & did not honor the reservation when I showed them the above confirmations on my phone."}
{"text":"Being from New England its haaaarrrd to rave about seafood in the southwest.  However we had our first dinner here and found it to be pretty good overall.  Great service, friendly staff, good food quality, and we did like the happy hour until 7pm."}
{"text":"The food here was great, but the reason this place gets 5 stars is all because of Nicole S.!! She was on top of everything and was so accommodating. She had us laughing like no tomorrow. Definitely request her when you go in!   Side note - the American Mules are out of this world!"}
{"text":"We finally found a place in AZ that serves Walleye, it was very good. The thing I was disappointed about was the choice of sides, I was unable to get a small side salad which would have been nice. It was also nice to see that we can purchase Walleye fillets and prepare them at home. Our server was very good. We will return."}
{"text":"They get A for effort, C+ for execution.  They're a solid place with decent seafood.  But the prawn linguine was drowning in butter and tasted like nothing else.  The scallops and mahi mahi had a nice crust and was cooked well.  But the polenta/risotto cake was also heavily buttered.  I would stick with just seafood in the simplest possible way.  The prices are decent, not overpriced and the service is great."}
{"text":"I loved BWG! What a delightful surprise! Chef Mark took care of us at the bar. He was so attentive, shared the most amazing oysters with us AND a taste of killer Pinot Blanc. Nice to see a chef out front taking care of the clientele. As a foodie, I am Super  impressed!"}
{"text":"Skeptical is a good way to describe my initial feelings when we arrived at the Bluewater Grill. The decor is very reminiscent of 80s Red Lobster so my expectations were low despite the location of this restaurant.  Boy was I in for a surprise though. Fish was DELICIOUS. Fresh, perfectly cooked, exactly as ordered. Husband had fish and chips and they were not breaded to death pieces of unknown fish. They were just right pieces of fresh cod. I had the scallop and shrimp skewers and they were perfect. It's so easy to over do scallops but these were on the money. Our server was a delight and even hurried things along when we told her we were heading to a show.   I am very much looking forward to a return trip to dive into the menu a bit more thoroughly!   Thanks Bluewater Grill for exceeding my expectations!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic Monday night dining experience! Our server was Roland and since it was our first time here we asked him for his recommendations. He did not steer us wrong! My husband and I started with a combo plate of Blue Point and Midnight Bay raw oysters. They were served with mignonette and also cocktail sauce with fresh shredded horseradish. Delicious! Next we had another appetizer of Ponzu Sashimi Scallops. These are described on the menu as being served with pickled ginger, wasabi aioli, wakame and masago. Roland sad they were addictive. Yes. They are. For our entrees, we chose Barramundi, Roland's favorite, and the Halibut which was in season. Both of these fish were grilled to perfection. We mixed up the sides so that we could try more. The coconut jasmine rice certainly did not disappoint. We also had the herb and goat cheese polenta (which was pretty ok), the Yukon Gold Skin on Cheddar Mashed and the Sautéed Summer Squash with Kale. There were many interesting drinks on the menu, but we stuck with a wine that we always love. We ended our meal with one of the best creme brûlées we've ever had, Cherry Creme Brûlée. I would love to go back to this restaurant and try other menu items! Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"Charming restaurant with delicious fresh seafood. Not the best scallops or prawns I've ever had, but their unique fish like the rockfish was incredible. Although, serving sizes were very generous and my dish came with nearly 10 medium scallops! Delicious clam chowder. Welcoming staff. Great deals for restaurant week!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a night of food and drink at Bluewater Grill this past Wednesday. This was my third visit and I am happy to say that I was just as satisfied as my previous visits. Along with some friends, my wife and I took part in one of the restaurants monthly tastings. They prepared three enjoyable courses, each perfectly paired with a complimentary wine. Our experience was not only a treat for or taste buds, but the extensive knowledge of the chef and bar manager/wine pro made it an educational experience. I highly recommend stopping by Bluewater Grill for one of their tastings or just for your favorite seafood dish.....they have great sushi too."}
{"text":"Just OK...our salads were good and the service was acceptable.  Nothing spectacular about this place that makes me want to rush back."}
{"text":"This was our first seafood stop in phoenix.   The staff was very friendly and pompt considering it was a sat. Night at prime time. The appies were spot on and the sushi was perfect. We will be returning to try more of there menu."}
{"text":"The service and food were really good. Our server suggested mixing both kinds of clam chowder together and Katy said it was great. Make sure to ask for Suzanne and get the 1$ drink for your first check in."}
{"text":"5 stars for happy hour. I live on 16th and Missouri and their is no better place for hh. Moscow Mule, Bluepoint oysters, fish tacos, and sushi fish. Bomb!"}
{"text":"The cioppino is absolutely delicious! I had it twice in the two weeks I was in Phoenix. The amount of seafood in the soup is fabulous: fresh crab meat is mounded on top of the soup (so you can eat that alone, free of the soup, if you wish), and there is a scallop, shrimp, mussels, clams, and pieces of some other fish within the not-too-spicy tomato base. Have is served over linguine - it does NOT disappoint! Our servers during both visits were very attentive and helpful with menu selections. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with my meal, but that could have been bad choices on my part. I often go with suggestions from the waiter/waitress and should not have gone with the plank crumbs on the trout. It was way too much breading, not just a little dusting. My summer squash and kale side was all squash and little kale, but later noticed the person next to me had much better proportions. The herb and goat cheese polenta could have been a potato cake. The rest of the table seemed to like their meals and the Yukon gold skin on cheddar mash was a hit."}
{"text":"This is hard to write because of how long I've been coming to this restaurant.  And I don't want anyone to think I'm one of those people who is unhappy because it's not the Fish Market anymore.  Yes change must happen... and they've made many good changes.  I think it's a good formula for success... but I will not be back.  I've been coming to this restaurant since 1990.  back in the day, I was a fan because of the great seafood.  and that hasn't changed... they still bring fresh fish into town from their own fishing fleet like they always have.  this is a rare treat folks... especially in Phoenix where fresh fish is only available at a few elite places.  but about 5 years ago, I began coming here for their excellent sushi bar.  and that's the part that I'm unhappy about.  yes they still do good sushi... but they have dumbed down the menu... many of the best items aren't even on the menu anymore.  I could live with that until they eliminated the baked green mussels.  it was the best thing.  best thing!  and it's simply not there anymore.    why get rid of something so sublime and delicious?  this was the one thing I always ordered, and even brought out of town friends here to show them.  but sadly, it's no longer available.  and if I can't get that, there's no reason to return to this place.  so, sorry guys... sorry Wade and Tim who I've been happy to work with for over ten years... I've paid my last visit.  UPDATE:  The manager of BG contacted me via Yelp to let me know that the green mussels will be back... if so, I will too."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place going down the 51 and never stopped until today. Very cool that you can actually buy fresh fish by the pound at the fish counter to take home and cook. But I sat at the bar and had a cup of New England Clam Chowder which was the best clam chowder I've ever tasted. Went from there to the Maryland Style crab cakes. Nothing but crab meat and no fillers. Awesome crab cakes, I just wish they were larger. But still awesome. Almost ordered the grilled walleye but decided to return on another day to try that one. The service was great and the bartender, Briana, was sweet and charming. Definitely a place to put on your favorites list in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great seafood! Fresh and prepared very very well! Service was excellent and our waitress was awesome with her NJ accent!!! Loved her! Atmosphere was nostalgic! Loved the place! Will be a repeat on our next trip to Arizona!!!"}
{"text":"Had such a great meal here! We were having a serious craving for king crab legs and I decided to surprise him and take him here for dinner. From the drinks to dessert- the food was absolutely amazing. Best crab legs I've had and the best crab legs he's had in Arizona. Had Creme brûlée for dessert! Totes amazing!! We will definitely be coming back here very soon!"}
{"text":"We travel a lot and rarely go back to the same place on one visit to a town.  But the meal and customer service here was so good, we went twice.  We split the trout almandine and the portions were very big.  Who would have thought you could get such fresh seafood in Phoenix!  The chopped salad and the shrimp cocktail were outstanding.  The shrimp were big and very full of flavor.  The place  has a lot of seating options and an extensive wine and drink list.  The waitstaff especially Melody or Melanie was excellent.  We will definitely be back next time we are in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. The service was atrocious. Don't go on a holiday weekend as they are not equipped, staffed, or prepared to handle any sort of a crowd. I made reservations, confirmed the reservation earlier in the day, and showed up on time. I was then told that it didn't matter if I had a reservation, there was a 45 minute wait. Since going anywhere else without a reservation would result in the same wait, we said okay and my name was added to the bottom of the list behind any walk-ins. Once we were sat, we were told Cliff would be with us shortly. A few minutes later, a woman who I assume was not \"Cliff\" brought us water and bread. About 5 minutes after that she asked if we wanted any drinks besides water. Finally, after sitting for 20 minutes, she asks if we have any questions. At this point, we have been sitting patiently, menus down (universal sign for ready to order), for 20 minutes assuming that she was just taking up some of the slack because \"Cliff\" was swamped. We placed our order and then waited an hour for the food to arrive. My Miso Glazed Swordfish was pretty okay, and the wife's King crab legs (2 for $50) were decent. Her grilled polenta, on the other hand, looked (and tasted) like some frozen patty someone slapped on the grill for char marks. I'll admit, being put at the bottom of the wait list even though I had a reservation soured my mood this evening, but my wife and I were amused that the most enjoyable moment we had was when we realized we could finally leave after paying the check. All said, I won't be returning to this establishment until there is a big banner stating \"Under New Management\"."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back. Best oysters in a while. Best calamari. Drinks were great. Happy hour was great."}
{"text":"Everyone liked their appetizer, entree and dessert with one exception.  My fish was overcooked and dry."}
{"text":"Seriously!!! This place is a saving grace by bringing good seafood to the middle of the desert. I decided to try this place out for Restaurant Week. The menu has a large variety of seafood from all over.   As someone who personally grew up on the East Coast, I know and love seafood!! The clam chowder here brought a tear to my eye because it reminded me of home. All of the food was fresh and perfection! Even the risotto was spot on! Plus they give bread and butter with your meal.   At the front, they sell seafood for you to take home. I bought some chowder for the road and I found out they can special order Haddock for me anytime!! Nobody offers haddock here!   Anyways, I found my seafood haven and I couldn't be happier!!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!! We're definitely coming back. Rockfish with polenta and clam chowder are  fantastic. The service was good. The ambience is so nice. We had such a lovely dinner. Thank you Bluewater!"}
{"text":"Just visited Bluewater Grill last night - they had the best Oysters I've had in the Phoenix area and the lobster roll is INCREDIBLE. We also had a couple great cocktails and the flame grilled salmon. Everything was very tasty and the service was excellent as well. We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"What great food and service. Three of the four of us had seafood and we all enjoyed it. The lobster roll was fantastic, the trout very tasty and the snapper was great also. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and suggested our friend get his lobster roll with the mayonnaise which he did and was very happy with it."}
{"text":"There are many places in the valley that purport to be seafood-only places that are absolutely dreadful in the execution of their meals, and/or their service.   However, neither was our experience while dining at this restaurant during this special occasion wherein we all found ourselves available to dine together for Sunday Brunch.  Right off the bat, our server Nelsy impressed us with her efficiency and her patience. We all arrived at separate times over the course of 40 minutes. And yet, she patiently and courteously waited on us over that course of time.  Once we had all arrived, we then spent even more time catching up before we even began to order. Our decision making abilities were hampered by the plethora of deliciously sounding options. It truly was a challenge to make our individual minds up. Therefore, we opted to just choose varying dishes and just shared them.  I will say their seafood dishes are superlative. There were none of those ersatz frozen dishes that had obviously been sitting in the freezer for way too long during transport. All our dishes were wonderfully prepared, and tasted quite fresh.  The clams, scallops, crabs, salmon steak, and the one chicken dish that we ordered were truly a delight on our senses.   And we finished it off with having some desserts. My creme brulee was both sweet, but not too sweet. Just how I like it.  Overall, it was a wonderful Sunday brunch experience worthy of the this establishment's reputation. The only thing missing was the ambiance of a body of water greater than an aquarium!  However, the company of my beloved wife and daughters certainly supplanted that atmospheric absence by a factor of a million! Along with the marvelous service, this place was a big hit with us."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and I am not real impressed. The fish was not very flavorful and one of the friends with us actually had really undercooked halibut. He didnt even want to order anything else as the first bite was enough for him to be turned off. I was hoping for more the second trip, but left disappointed as i did the first trip."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this establishment several times in the last five years. Most recently, as Bluewater Grill, the seafood is plentiful, fresh, fairly priced for inland restaurants offering such fair. I especially like to eat at the oyster bar where warm sourdough bread is served with your meal. Recently, a colleague and I ate oysters before fresh glazed salmon, perfect mahi mahi, cold beer, and good company. We were able to watch a ball game while dining and chatting with the server and bartender. Inside the restaurant is a wonderful sushi bar that is the rave of PHX. The ambiance is getting a little old but still has charm like an old seaside fish restaurant. A little updating will be needed soon. But the food is great, the fish fresh that day, and the prices modestly expensive but worth it. I plan to eat here every time I am in town."}
{"text":"Rachel is the best! She took great care of me and my daughters. Amazing seafood! Solid happy hour. Lobster roll is a must try. Clam chowder was on point as always. The staff were friendly and accommodating. Can't wait for next time!"}
{"text":"Service was a 5, Sammy was excellent! She was efficient , knowledgeable and fun.  The menu was bland, nothing that said \"wow or yum - I can't wait to try that! \"  I was disappointed there were no specials for New Years Eve...  the  food quality and taste was good...decent portion size and enjoyed the bread. it just seemed to be lacking in ambiance for the price and occasion. Great lunch type atmosphere so might be okay for that but nothing that stands out for date night or a special occasion.  We had a party of four with two birthdays which when they seated us they addressed the fact that we were celebrating birthdays but they never mentioned it again. Overall I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Myself and several friends, meet at the Bluewater Grill every Tuesday night for dinner. This place is just as good as it gets. It's nice to be greeted by the staff when we walk in. All the staff is great, the food is great, affordably priced and always fresh."}
{"text":"Disappointing.    I've eaten here about 5 times over the last couple years.  This review is for the last two times, over the last 1 year.    First, service has been bad on both occasions.  Seems like they either have assigned twice as many tables to each waiter as they should, or the waiters just are rude, but I have experienced unacceptable waits for each stage of the dining on both occasions, with two separate servers, so there is a real problem.  With that said, servers were nice and professional when they were there... just took too long.  Second, atmosphere is just okay.  You're typical mid-market seafood joint.    Third, the food is just okay.  I mean it's maybe a 3 out of 5 stars, depending on what you order.  Portions are on the smaller side.  I've tried the Mahi Mahi (crispy fried in olive oil on outside with what tasted like a Montreal Steak Seasoning), as well as their Scallops.  The scallops were by far the best.  The fresh sourdough bread is outstanding... I could eat several baskets if I let myself!  But for my fourth point, and the most important, the VALUE is NOT there.  It's too expensive for what you get.  I feel like every entree, if it was $3-4 cheaper, would be fair price.  Maybe.  But for just \"average to good\" food, it's not worth the prices.    I told myself after eating there last night I won't be back.  Perhaps I'll forget that pledge, but I hope not.  Go elsewhere (such as McCormick & Schmick's just up the road in Esplanade)."}
{"text":"So I've been coming to this place when it was the \"fish market\" for over 20 years. Now that blue water grille has taken over they have taken a step back in quality. The so called French sourdough bread that used to be at the fish market is nothing more than white bread with crust, so when one wants to order the garlic cheesy bread and it's made on this cheap white bread its deplorable \"cost cutting measures\" no less, yes it's warm like it's made in house but it'll never be the same and for that reason alone I'll never darken there doorway.  The New England clam chowder that used to be soon great is garbage now. Why would you change something that was perfect."}
{"text":"Had the halibut and goat cheese polenta cake with spinach. Along with 2 dirty Martinis with blue cheese olives. Service was good enough, minus a couple of hiccups with the food orders and the wait for the corrections to come back to our table.   The food: goat cheese polenta cake and spinach were amazing. Definitely recommend trying this. The halibut was fresh but it was a tad dry. The highlight of the meal for me was the perfectly made, dirty belvedere martini. I would come back for the martini alone. It's so hard to find a bartender who makes a good martini in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I'll be honest. Totally thought this was a knock-off Red Lobster. Super skeptical the wife convinced me to grab dinner here.  I'm glad I did. It's definitely a step up from Red Lobster and a step down from high end sea food restaurants. It's at a good price point. Tuesday decor is totally hokey but the service was great. The shrimp cocktail was very good and done in a unique twist.  Wife got the trout with spinach and I got scallop kabobs with a side of vegetables. It was very good. And the sides were great!"}
{"text":"Great service and fresh raw offerings.  Our waiter was also very helpful.  Can't really say anything bad.  Good oysters, great salmon and tuna sashimi.  The raw clams were the money, and I expect to be back here every 3 months or so.  I could order some of the cheaper dishes and come back more often, but for me being from Hawaii, where raw fish is pretty much a birthright, I'll save this place for the times I'm truly craving the good stuff.  Don't forget, oysters really go well with a nice vodka martini!"}
{"text":"It's difficult to find any type of decent seafood in the Valley, and I have to say Bluewater is always on top of their game.  I find their options to be a bit more expansive than the previous Fish Market.  And you can't beat a Happy Hour on the weekend.  The Soft Shell Crab roll is a must!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have never had a bad experience here ever! Tonight was amazing and by far the best experience we've had.   We set a reservation for 5 pm but went in early for some cocktails during their happy hour. My husband got a Moscow Mule and I got a Dark and Stormy. The bartender was terrific and very helpful.  For our meal we ordered oysters on a half shell and crab cakes for an appetizer. Both were exceptional but the crab cakes were so delicious my hubby and I almost fought over the last bite. We both ordered the surf and turf and it was spectacular as well. The ribeye melted in your mouth, the lobster casserole was not what I expected and pleasantly surprised. Then the mashed potatoes are not to be ignored either.  But a special shout out goes to our waiter Cliff. Definitely THE best waitor we've EVER had. perfect amount of attention and tolerated my off the wall humor."}
{"text":"We love going for happy hour drinks and sushi. Our server John was awsome and helped us celebrate a birthday while there. Prices are reasonable and quality was very good."}
{"text":"I'll really only come back for the Speak Easy Lounge upstairs in the back. I think Bluewater is overpriced, especially the sushi. $7-12 a roll.  Came on a Thur about 1/2 an hour before closing. Had 2 drinks downstairs before the back opened @ 10. Don't order hard alcohol downstairs. Whomever was making drinks skimps on the liquor. They have beer on tap downstairs but was told there are bottles upstairs. They do bring you a glass for your beer.  Everyone that works there we talked to was extremely friendly & attentive! Managers actually shook my hand & asked my name.  Ok, so upstairs... The Lounge has become one of my fave places in the valley. The decor is SOOO mellow. There are tables & chairs, couches, or the bar of course. They keep the lights down LOW with tons of white candles lit all over. It's very intimate. There's an outdoor patio w/ glass tables & big chairs for smokers. Was told they're debating putting porch swings in the indoor patio area. Right now there are tables & chairs & lots of candles along the windows.  The drinks were finally stiff & very tasty! A lot of people order Moscow Mules. They do have a full bar. There were 2 cute bartenders & 1 pretty waitress. Again, they weren't very busy. Maybe 40-45 people at the busiest.  There's LIVE music. We were listening to a guy sing & a girl play the cello. Before the live music the bartender had some great music playing. I recognized Tegan & Sara, Metric, etc... My only complaint is the music was too loud. It didn't jive with the setting. 1 of the bartenders kept messing with the volume & you could tell they've previously blown out the speakers already. I shouldn't have to yell to be heard.  I was told there was a unisex bathroom & instantly cringed. My concern was unfounded though. The bathroom was perfectly fine throughout the night. It's actually very nice. Turn the lock & it'll tell others it's \"occupied\". The door is HEAVY though. Shove on it.  So, how do you get to the Speak Easy? Pull around to the back. There'll be an unmarked door on the left. It's up a few stairs. There might be a guy working there who stands in front of the door. I hear he's the 1 that cards (I wouldn't know. Came up through the downstairs since my friend knew someone working there). You'll walk into a kitchen. There are stairs to the right or an elevator to the left. Stairs are fine for when you arrive, but they're a little dark. Be careful! If you've been drinking, take the elevator when you leave. Trust me!"}
{"text":"BEST happy hour sushi in Phoenix!  Nick and the rest of the bar staff welcome us by name every time we come for a visit. We love it here!  I highly recommend the happy hour mushrooms... getting hungry just thinking of them now."}
{"text":"Had an awesome girls' night with my aunts and cousins here - Great place to gather!  Good food, nothing special.  Crab cakes and scallops started the night out right.  I had the lobster bisque, but it was rather bland.  I sampled a few fish dishes and all were well cooked.  Next time I'd like to try the sushi bar, since it sounds popular.  Service was great.  Would love to see more soul in a quality chain like this.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"With 254 existing reviews and a standing 4 out of 5 star rating I always forgot to post my review on this place, till now. I always patron this restaurant in a large group and order up $100's in food. Only had been dissapointed once with Barramundi, a bit too bitter but I am not a Barrumundi expert as I've never had it before. We normally get oysters, Ribeye's, calamari, cioppini, shrimp cocktail and King Crab legs. This place never seems to dissapoint us. I don't know if their norm is to say Goodnight to all their customers, or just the ones who spend big money. We always get thank you's and have a great days from everyone in the place and Love it! Will keep returning back here and recommend this place to those who love High quality sea food. Even if you show up in sweats looking like you just got rolled over by muggers, they still treat you like you are royalty. Love that businesses now realize that even wealthy people do wear flip flops and dress down occasionally (totally exaggerating our clothes)...ha ha."}
{"text":"One of my favorite seafood places in Phoenix area. In my option, i believe they have the best seafood in the valley. We have been there few times and every time the food is great and always taste fresh! For Seafood the price is about right."}
{"text":"\"The freshest oysters in all of Arizona\" may sound like an oxymoron, but it's what Bluewater Grill boasts. They proudly showcase two types of oysters a day, one west coast and one east coast. That may not seem like a lot but hey, we're in the middle of the desert -- what do you expect?  East coast oysters are brinier and saltier. They sometimes have a funk that comes from the merroir (like terroir but for the sea). West coast oysters are sweeter and have more fruit flavors like cucumber or melon. Pick your style or try them all!  Happy hour prices are pretty good. On weekdays they're 3:30 - 6:30 and you get discounts on some food and drinks (including oysters!).  I also tried the King crab, which was delicious but very expensive. If you are sociable and make friends with the bartenders, they may be able to cut you a deal (half order of king crab, for instance)."}
{"text":"Happy hour value is exquisite! $5 Moscow mules that were amazing! Great sushi rolls and the baked mussels were fantastic. Overall 5 stars for the food and drinks. Wish I could give ten stars for service... Christy is knowledgeable, friendly, and very attentive. We couldn't ask for a better experience!"}
{"text":"The Bluewater Grill is a family of Seafood Restaurants that are located in Resort Communities. This restaurant serves Sustainable Seafood and Harpooned Swordfish from their own harpoon boats.  The building is very large and looks very old fashioned. As you enter you walk past a small fish market where you can purchase some hard to come by fish like walleye. Many family photos of fishing trips grace the walls. Most of the chairs have fish motifs on them. It sure doesn't feel like Phoenix here.  Our server was very friendly and also very welcoming. She truly seemed very sincere that she was happy we were dining here. After we ordered we get a very large loaf of sour dough bread that is extra sour just like they serve in San Francisco.  I soon receive my Walleye Pike. I give them credit for removing the skin. (most places don't bother) ........But I think we had someone new cooking there because my fish arrived in many pieces. Usually Walleye is very meaty but not all but most pieces of my fish were thin and almost didn't seem like meaty walleye. The fish was ok.....it wasn't undercooked.....maybe a tad overdone..my fish didn't flake at all. The Sautéed Spinach was really great. It was very fresh, sautéed nice and was very buttery. The Red Quinoa was a little weird. It had beets in it and slivered almonds. It also had these black leaves in it that were bitter tasting.....it was weird to me.  My husband asked for the Cioppino....he wasn't asked what size he wanted so the waitress ordered the large for him and suggested to also get the linguini with it. He received very thick marinara sauce, over done clams, ok mussels, good crab, excellent shrimp, VERY OVER DONE Scallops and good fish.   We found that the food on our visit was hit and miss. You might get luckier and visit them when a better cook is on.  3 stars means OK but I have some reservations"}
{"text":"7/15/17 Lobster roll with potatoes so yummy and the dessert OMG that chocolate lava cake!!! The restaurant is clean and the ambiance is nice. The waitress was friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back.  8/19/17 So, my 2nd time wasn't as good as the first time. Let's start with the good. This time we started with a cup of New England clam chowder, which was very flavorful and I would definitely order again. I ordered the lobster roll hot with butter and I definitely prefer it over the cold with mayo. This time, I feel like they skimped on the mashed potatoes portion. The chocolate lava cake was not as good as the first time either. And our service was definitely NOT 5 or even 4 Stars for that matter. When my water glass is almost empty and I'm waiting and waiting for water that's a PROBLEM.   We will give this place one more chance because I do want to try the fisherman's platter.  9/9/17 Cassandra was our waitress and can I just say she is amazing. I ordered the fisherman's platter. The fries were on the cold side, I only ate a few.  The scallops were delicious, perfectly cooked and sweet. I am not even a fan of cole slaw and let me just say I ate all of it. Now time for dessert...of course I ordered the chocolate lava cake and this time it was DELICIOUS like the first time that I had it!"}
{"text":"Truly the best Fish N Chips in the Valley! Fabulous Clam Chowder! Fresh Sushi. Great Happy Hour! Fabulous Fresh Fish! Great Oyster Bar! Love this place. Lets all support this so its is here to stay. We do not have any another place like this since McCormick and Shmicks closed down! PLEASE LETS KEEP THIS PLACE ALIVE AND BUSY! Very reasonable priced! All the way around. Cocktails and food. Great ambiance. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Went here for Happy Hour Sushi and drinks again.  It's conveniently located off of the 51 and has an attractive bar area.  I have eaten in the main restaurant and found it to be fine, but not a place I would pick as one of  my favorites.  The sushi is different, though.  We always order off of the Happy Hour Menu and it's all delicious.  They have the typical type of rolls, but also types I have never heard of that have more complex ingredients and flavors.  I highly recommend it.  The Happy Hour prices for food are not as low as I would like, but the sushi rolls are much larger than other places, so don't order many or you will be taking them home.  Happy Hour drink prices are good.  The service was excellent.  We basically had two waiters and the sushi chef stopped by to see if we had enjoyed our meal.  Even if you have been unhappy in the regular dining room, try going for sushi.  You'll be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. After a slow start (very busy place on Friday evening) our waitress 'Lisa' was attentive, gave great suggestions about the menu, and had a nice sence of humor. Would suggest this to anyone looking for good seafood in Phoenix at a nice price."}
{"text":"You have to be kidding me with the noise in here and the disappearing waiter.... For the money the atmosphere is not worth it. Seated by the soup station listening to the banging of the hotel pans really made having any kind of conversation impossible. And special thanks to jerks at next table with a million kids they are not paying attention too. Wish management would have asked them to stop with the shouting game of patty cake."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The menu makes a lot of bold choices that aren't backed up by the kitchen. \"Seared Eastern Sea Scallops\" over spinach were small, overcooked, and smelled and tasted of cooking gas. I'd challenge anyone in that kitchen to sit down and actually eat that dish.   Sushi was warm and sad. Cioppino was completely flavorless. Only the Oysters Rockefeller shined, but that's a tough thing to screw up. I really have to wonder if management ever tastes their own food here."}
{"text":"Our server Ben was outstanding. He was so friendly and helpful with suggestions for sushi etc. Mark was also a fun guy. We had so much fun and everything we ordered was delicious. Oyster shooters were a real adventure. We can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been fortunate to dine in the raw bar and sushi area several times and have been particularly impressed with Mark the sous chef/bartender/jack of all trades. He is one of the reasons we have continually returned but the fresh oysters, clams, bread, soup and various entrees and/or sushi items always please. Happy hour daily to include weekends is a plus too with several happy hour specials to choose from. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it a higher rating, but I can't.  The food wasn't bad.  I enjoyed the octopus salad.  I would order it again or order some of the sushi on the menu.  I just thought that the service was very slow.  It was quite some time before we were able to order.  And it's not like it was very busy.  My coworkers also enjoyed their food.  It just seemed to take quiet some time for us to get the check.  And once we did get it, it was the wrong one.  When you go to lunch during the week, I think servers should assume or ask if we are on a schedule.  We did have to go back to work."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour after church last Sunday.  It was our first time at the Bluewater Grill and we will definitely be back. The oysters were huge and delicious as were our entered (crab salad and trout). Looking forward to the oysters and trying their sushi bar next.  Nice atmosphere and friendly, informed staff.  Update: We went for New Years Eve dinner and it was even better than before.  The oysters, again, were outstanding. Our waiter was very friendly and very attentive.   Only slight issue (that was really a non-issue since we came in at 5pm so we could be at the symphony by 7pm) was that they didn't have our reservation.  I heard my husband call earlier that afternoon to double check and it was there but not when we arrived?  Regardless, we didn't have to wait because we were so early. No matter, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First off this place deserves 5 stars for sure.  The Ponzu Scallops were to die for (I'll be going back just for these) the ambiance is great, the staff is extremely friendly, and the oyster bar is one of a kind. For the camelback corridor area this place is a must go.   Clam chowder is the best I've had in the Valley.  Cioppino is outstanding, zesty and texturally perfect.  Buillabaisse is luscious, and really shines with white wine and butter notes.  Drinks at the bar were wonderful and unique, we had a cucumber mojito that was to die for.   We will be coming back without a doubt. Great date night spot."}
{"text":"Not sure why I haven't written this sooner but I love bluewater. Having lived in coastal states my entire life before coming to Arizona I have a solid appreciation for seafood in all forms. After originally coming here as part of a yelp event where they wowed us with some great food I knew I had to come back (this review only pertains to non-event visits).  I have come back several times including for restaurant week (spring), my girlfriends birthday (Samantha S.), restaurant week (fall) and to celebrate Sam buying a house. I think it's safe to say we love this place.  I happen to love how fresh everything is and that the preparations are always perfect. My favorite thing so far is probably that I switched out the mahi mahi in risotto with the fresh swordfish and it was amazing. I love the creamy risotto with the acidic tang of the balsamic and tomato. I also have to say there clam chowder is authentic to the New England style and is a must to start any meal. The sourdough bread they give you is also fantastic, not too much of that sour twang but just enough and served hot from the over.  One of the best parts about Bluewater is that it is really relaxed environment, most seafood restaurants with this level of fish quality are more formal, here it's relaxed and comfortable. For those from New England this is more the local seafood restaurant in gloucester than the trendy place in Boston. The prices are also very reasonable and the service is great. I have not had anybody on the waitstaff who hasn't been great."}
{"text":"Very good. I dropped in for a quick lunch and had the fish tacos. Very fresh and very tasty. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend because of the lobster promotion special they were having. We were served by a lovely and pleasant older lady (I think her name was Lizzie or Lettie? Or Lizzy). She was very accomodating! What a pleasure it was to be served by her. The clam chowder was yummy, served with little saltine crackers. The main dish was delicious baked lobster with herbs and crispy anko breadcrumbs with melted butter for dipping! Simply a delight in my mouth! I enjoyed every mouthful. It was a large lobster so I couldn't manage to finish it.The grilled squash and zucchini was also very lightly salted and tasteful. I didn't really enjoy the mashed potatoes, however. They tasted somewhat instant and didn't have the usual homey-mashed-potatoes taste that homemade potatoes have. It was kind of a thick and dense gluey texture. The rice tasted good as well. I liked the sweet wine that I chose--I do believe it was a dessert wine that my server recommended. All-in-all, I enjoyed the service and food I received here. The space seemed like it could accomodate a lot of people too, which is cool if I ever want to have a dinner party of sorts here with my friends in future. The atmosphere was very laid-back and pleasant. I would definitely return to try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  First our server was wonderful.  I think her name was A.J.  She was always there when we needed something and not there when we didn't.  We shared a bowl of steamed clams that were perfect and followed that up with the Linguine and Prawns.  Fantastic flavor..........only the prawns were really large shrimp.  But that didn't deter from the taste.  It was early Sunday evening and it was not crowded, in fact it was practically empty and made me wonder why.  I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I went there thinking / hoping this place had some resemblance of its predecessor; The Fish Market. Boy was I mistaken. First, there was nothing that resembled a typical lunch menu. Everything on the  menu was $$, including the 1/2 sandwich and fries for 9.95, which I'm sorry I ordered. The sandwich was remarkably small, with 1 small piece of lettuce, slice of tomato and what looked liked a small scoop of tuna. The bread looked like it may have been right out of a loaf of Roman Meal bread. The fries seemed like a normal small portion. When served, I recall how astonished I was at how small the entire combination was and how I knew I would be hungry afterward since I don't eat fries, however, the substitutions came at an extra charge. Which meant I just got a tiny half sandwich for 10 bucks or a tiny sandwich with cole slaw for even more $.  This was a lunch experience that made me angry with each passing moment i sat there fuming, primarily due to the lackluster portion, the price, and the mediocre service.  I really dont like to score a place one star, but in this case, if Bluewater has the stones to sell a small, ordinary 1/2 sandwich for 10 bucks, I feel the need to tell anyone interested how this place offers absolutely no value for the $$.  I will never go back to this place. Once bitten, twice shy as the saying goes."}
{"text":"The only restaurant in the Phoenix area that I am aware of that serves Walleye! (Flaky, white fresh water fish from Canada)."}
{"text":"Everything starts with a complimentary loaf of sourdough.   This restaurant is mostly about ambience. You are transported to a cute little wharf. Pictures of the ocean and stuffed fish decorate the walls. There's a huge ship-in-a-bottle on display.   But when it comes to the food, like everybody else is saying, the portions are small for the price. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos. The fish is dipped in hot spices but it's not terribly hot because the cabbage and avocado on top mellow it out. They were good but not worth the $13.50.   I picked couscous for the side. Their couscous is not what I expected. I'm spoiled by the cracked wheat/vegetables on top variety. Their couscous is composed of large pearl seeds topped with yellow peppers and sliced almonds. It was very bland. It'd be worth the price if you could pick two sides.  Our waiter, Roland, was really chill and personable. However, I can't recommend the Bluewater Grill. Skip this place and head to Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Went down there today for the first time and the service was great and so was the food. We will be going back there again. Try the Rockefeller oyster if you go."}
{"text":"Came to Blue water for our anniversary and loved it. Waiter was timely and treated us to a dessert The crab was so good! So glad we chose this restaurant to celebrate"}
{"text":"Went there for restaurant week. I was originally excited. Ordered oysters (not on the restaurant week menu but I'm from New Orleans and needed them). I would've thrown them back, not even oysters.. Far too small. The restaurant week menus consists of a three course meal.. First, we had to ask for a restaurant week menu... Come on! They originally sat us in an odd corner at a 2 person table (yes there were only 2 of us, but we didn't want to sit there! ) so we moved to the bar. Service was slow. We ordered appetizers. The crab cakes were pretty good.. Not the best but good. The seared Ahi came with a ton of food, but way under seasoned and therefore they didn't taste that great. We each ordered the mahi mahi entree... This was fantastic. The only good thing ordered. Must have if you go. Took desert to go.   Overall, the mahi was nice. But that's it. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to dinner tonight at this location for the first time.  It was one of the best dining experiences we've ever had. The restaurant has an open area and then a more cozy candlelit dining area where we sat. We ordered the Crab cocktail, the charbroiled Edamame and the Cioppino. The seafood tasted like it had just been caught, really it did  - in Arizona no less....they are doing something very right at this restaurant. The waiter was attentive and courteous making sure we had what we needed without interrupting us. My family has been in the restaurant business for many years, and I could tell this staff was professionally trained. They all were very concerned that we have a great experience and they succeeded. We'll be back and will tell our friends as well."}
{"text":"I was disappointed.  Heard some great comments about this place and since my wife was coming into town at the airport, this was a perfect time for a trial.  The New England Chowder was way too heavy with flour.  Too many restaurants use way too much flour to thicken the chowder - and Bluewater leads the parade.  My wife had sand dabs - nice fish, but the sauce was lacking something - the flavor she expected just wasn't there.  My scallops were.....okay.  Nice waitress, friendly and timely service.  But since we live on the far west side, probably not a place we'll return to."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we had a fabulous experience.  The food was awesome and the wine list is tops!  The service was attentive and very friendly!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time with my family.  The food was really good and the staff was great too.  The lobster was delicious as was the lobster bisque.  The cioppino was good, but not as brothy as would have hoped.  Kid-friendly and the kids enjoyed their food.  Seafood is fresh and cooked very well.  The Manhattan Chowder was also great.  Was disappointed with the creme brule and would not order again.  All-in-all a place worth eating at and visiting again.  We will return."}
{"text":"Will not eat here again!  Last night was our first and final visit to Bluewater Grill.  The waiter was nice but the food was awful. I ordered the blackened sea bass and then the waiter came back and said they ran out. So, I changed my order to the Ahi tuna. I ordered it rare but it was a bit overcooked.  The vegetable that came with it was a broccoli/cauliflower mix. I ordered the red potatoes, which I thought were going to be red new potatoes....but they were basically small steak fries.  The ahi tuna was the biggest disappointment. It had a bad taste. It wasn't cooked with any type of seasoning and it tasted a bit metallic. I shared some with my family just to let them see how bad it was. My fiancé had rainbow trout and his was overcooked but at least it looked like it was seasoned with something! Mine was just a patty of white blah!  My son had fish and chips. He complained that it was dry so I tasted it and it was!! It did not have a good taste at all. It was probably the breading that gave it a bad taste. And then the fish itself was dry.  Oh, I forgot about the two good things:  1.) The clam chowder was great. 2.) I got a $1 drink coupon for checking in with Yelp.  Again, I won't rush back to this place; but if I ever find myself here, I'm sticking strictly to the clam chowder!"}
{"text":"There is nothing bad you can say about this place. The same ladies have been serving me delicious food since I was in high school! Always amazingly friendly. The food is always outstanding!"}
{"text":"Came here with my GF the other night she had never been here and she was craving seafood and I didn't feel like cooking salmon so I said lets go out to eat...I just want to say if you plan on dining here...make sure you come with no less then $60 in your wallet this place is not for the cheap, for 2 people our tab was close to $80 without any alcoholic drinks.   So to start we ordered the Crab Dip for our appetizer, it is very very good and they give you a pretty good portion, we ran out of dipping bread before we ran out of dip.   Now from the way it was described to me I thought the salads were included with our entree, but apparently it is a separate item. I didn't realize this till I got the check... I got the dinner salad almost $6... so not worth it, my gf got he Tuscan Caesar almost $8...not worth it...even thou these things are ginormous I could get a full salad bar somewhere for this price. The salads were good and big, but not worth the $14 I spent on them.   My gf ended up with the Mahi special and I went with the chicken special. These were both pretty well prepared. My gf thoroughly enjoyed her plate and we kept trying each others dishes. Both of these items together were over $40 They were good, but they didn't stick out as being great. Just kind of OK.   All in all this place is ok, the service was slow, I had to ask two different passing by servers for drink refills, and for more bread and I think its a bit overpriced. This place may have gotten 4 stars if the service would have been a bit better and the staff would have explained that the salads were additional and spent more time tending to us.    I have been to better places, I would be willing to give this place another shot."}
{"text":"I first went to the Bluewater Grill years ago when they first opened and was not a fan.  The service was sketchy and food portions small and bland.  I did not venture back for quite some time but was enticed back because of their happy hour.  They have a fantastic happy hour filled with all kinds of great food including Sushi.  They make a Rainbow Roll that is fantastic.  It is indeed the largest rainbow roll that I have ever had.  Another great thing about their happy hour is that they offer it on the weekends from  noon to 5pm, 3:30 to 6:30 during the week.  If you are a clam chowder fan, you will like theirs.  Lots of clams and served with little oyster crackers.  The staff is always super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner last evening.  The food was amazing, fresh and delicious.  The service was excellent.  The oysters on the half shell were fresh and plump.  The Clam chowder was excellent.  The seafood platter had amazing scallops.  Our friends enjoyed the blackened salmon and it was great!  We indulged a bit on the desert which was great!  The chocolate lava cake was great!  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is such a great deal. Blue point oysters are so awesome. Also had calamari, chicken wings, fisherman's platter, sushi, and lobster roll. Everything is top notch, superb quality, so fresh. Had a dark and stormy, and margarita from the bar, delish!!  Creme brulee was perfect too. Love this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some seafood after getting off the plane. Swordfish w rice and cheddar mashed potatoes. Good meal. Great atmosphere for a reasonable price.   Bartender/Server was a good guy. I think his nickname was Scoop or something. He kept up w the customers and the food arrived quickly.  A solid 7.5/8 out of 10. I will return if I am in Phoniex again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try out this restaurant because we love seafood. First let me say it is a really nice place.  The waiter was really nice and helpful. We started with the crab, spinach and artichoke dip. It was ok. I ordered the walleye and some vegetables along with New England clam chowder and he had prawn linguine and lobster bisque. The clam chowder tasted like flour and the lobster bisque was thick and flavorless. The walleye simply tasted like fish without any seasoning whatsoever. Everything was just room temperature like it sat a while before being brought to us. We were not pleased with the lack of flavor of the food. One thing I can say is you will never know if you like a place until you try it. Well, we tried this place and can cross it off our list. This is just what we thought so you may want to try for yourself because you never know until you try for yourself. If you decide to try it I hope you enjoy it more than we did."}
{"text":"father in town and we wanted a great place to showcase seafood for him out here in the desert.   we were seated quite fast and accosted for drinks. with Yelp check-in, your first alcoholic beverage is only a buck! the house red was pretty good.  our server was very friendly and informative. it always makes me nervous when they don't write down what i ordered, but it all came out just as stated.  i had a bowl of NE clam chowdah and it was probably one of the best i've had...both in and out of NE. my father ordered a calamari app and it was just the right amnt of crunch and chewy. their 2 dipping sauces were equally great.   for my entree, i had the baramundi with steamed veggies and spinach. the baramundi was rich and flavorful, not too heavy on the butter. the outside was seared to a light crisp.   our total for 3 entrees, 3 drinks, and 2 apps came to just over 100.oo bucks. not too shabby for a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Service was great Provided by Kat Food was excellent  the lobster roll fantastic recommend this restaurant highly"}
{"text":"Dinner for two for our anniversary. Not nearly as upscale a location as I was expecting. Dinner was okay at best. My husbands mahi mahi was actually tough. My salmon was good. Sides were terrible and rather bland. I expected a lot more for the hefty price tag. Definitely disappointed and won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff and fun atmosphere! Strongly suggest making a reservation."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Did not enjoy the paella as the rice was undercooked in my experience. They traded it out for another entre with no problem. Wait staff was great. Super IPA at the bar."}
{"text":"The Maryland crab cakes were quite delicious! My girlfriend ordered the Halibut. It looked really good. She said it was pretty tasty. I ordered the Cod and it wasn't bad. It wasn't the best Cod I've had but it was good.The service was great."}
{"text":"When this place used to be the Fish Market, it was great. I hadn't been since the change to Blue Water Grill, so thought we'd try it out for a family lunch.   The server told us they had award winning clam chowder...we all laughed after we tried it, as not sure who gave them the award...it tasted like it was out of a can. The fish tacos had dry tortillas and was very small.   The only thing we enjoyed was the kale/artichoke dip.  Definitely wouldn't go again and wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the food is exceptional. Recently, I went for their happy hour which is decent. Their crab dip is phenomenal. It is not too crabby tasting and it has a little kick to it. Also, I had one of their sushi rolls which was delicious. I personally have never had anything here that wasn't amazing."}
{"text":"This used to be the The Fish Market. It looks similar to the old restaurant but with a fresher look. I'm glad they kept the Fish Market employees because our waitress was very friendly and attentive. We came for the Happy Hour /Small Plate Menu. I love the small plate concept because I like to try a little bit of everything. The shrimp ceviche lettuce wraps were zesty, fresh and had big chunks of avocados. My favorite was the salt and pepper shrimp. They were so crunchy and delicious that I didn't even care they had eyes. My fiance really liked the burger slider with Gruyere cheese and french fries. It was a great value we each had a cocktail and split 4 small plates for $30! We will be back to try the calamari slider. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is, I frequently like to preview the online menu before going to a restaurant and some of the advertised prices and entrees were different on the online menu then at the restaurant."}
{"text":"WOW, what a great seafood restaurant.  I have lived in Arizona for 2 years and just heard about this place and thank goodness I did.  We had the most amazing server Kelly.  She made our evening.  I recommend anything on the menu.  It was fantastic."}
{"text":"Went here last night and was thoroughly unimpressed. I ordered the crab cakes to start. They were okay. Not the best I've ever had, not the worst. They came swimming in roumalade. Yuck.   I then ordered the shrimp and scallop skewers with sauteed spinach and couscous. One scallop was still somewhat raw in the middle (and cold) and the shrimp tasted like they were fished out of a swimming pool (shrimp shouldn't taste like chlorine). Both were underseasoned... actually, maybe not seasoned at all. The couscous was cold and gummy (eww) and typically, I love couscous! The only redeeming quality of my entree was the spinach. Sad.   My server was awesome - quick, attentive, kept my glass full. She asked how my meal was, I said \"meh. It was okay, I guess.\" She seemed concerned and said in the future, if I wasn't happy, I should let them know right away so I can swap things out. I thought it fair to give it a shot though. Big mistake. I got home a short time after and was so sick!!!!!   I won't be going back. I should have kept true to my \"no seafood in land locked states\" rule."}
{"text":"I had a lovely evening at Bluewater Grill. Robert was our sushi chef, service was outstanding! The food absolutely exceptional. The manager came by to check on us made sure we were well taking care of. I highly recommend this restaurant. Perfect to bring your family , friends and loved one!"}
{"text":"Took my client there after we celebrated her selling her house.  We shared the pan seared scallop appetizer; she had the mahi mahi special and I had the prawn linguine.    The scallops were good, nice and plump and not over-cooked and seasoned just perfect.  She said her mahi mahi was delish.   Cooked to perfection.   I don't know what it came with, but she gobbled up the whole thing.   No, sorry, I didn't taste it.   She offered, but I don't know why I declined.   My linguine was el perfecto!!   It had a distinct garlic taste, that is for sure.    Good thing I didn't have any appointments that afternoon.   I love garlic, and the linguine was cooked and flavored just the way I like.   If it isn't anything worse is over-cooked pasta.   UGHH!!   When it says 'prawns,' it means 'prawns.'   Very large shrimp, quite a number of them, also flavored to perfection.   We each had a glass of wine.   Yes, I know, it's happy hour somewhere.   Since we were celebrating her house selling, and her moving on to the next phase of her life, hey, why not.  It was a major step and decision for her.  Should have had a couple!   I will definitely go back.   I had been there quite sometime ago with a former BF, and for some reason, I was not mesmerized with that visit.   Maybe it's cause of the person I was with.   Dunno."}
{"text":"We spontaneously stopped by and we're seated near the bar for happy hour. The food was good, we ordered the New England Clam Chowder, crab cakes, crab blt and the shrimp cocktail The French fries are awesome, the cocktail sauce is good and the clam chowder is good, we ordered more to go. They got 4 stars today instead of five because the service was a bit subpar We kept having to flag him down to order and he never asked what sides we wanted so fries apparently is what we chose though we would have liked to try something more original sounding from the menu.  My drink also came out wrong.  A few more moments conferring with the client would go a long way in providing a better experience, we will be back to try it again when we are in the area."}
{"text":"The meal itself was fine.  If you are in the mood for decent seafood but a really expensive bill, go here."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but I couldn't find anything special or different about this restaurant to separate it from a Red Lobster. The portions are small. The price for the portion is offensive. I had the lunch Fisherman's Platter for $16.95. For a $16.95 lunch I was expecting more than 1 scallop, 2 shrimp, and 1 small piece of fish. I should have paid more attention to the menu, but again the description is a little vague too. It states Panko Prawns (not how many). Panko Scallop (notice no plural s at the end of scallop). Beer Battered Alaskan Cod (does not state you get 1 very small piece). Next time I crave seafood I will drive over to King's Fish House at Tempe Market Place. Prices are the same but the quality of seafood and fish is much better."}
{"text":"Great find!  My husband and I are natives, I can't believe I have never come here before.  The clam chowder was great and the Snapper w Cajun seasoning and cheddar mashed potatoes w zucchini was fantastic!  This will definitely be a new date night restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great service and our server Rachelle was wonderful. She suggested the Senorita Roll and it was perfect. Ordered the fisherman's platter for my lover and I had the Ahi with grilled palenta and coconut rice. Will be back and hope to have her as our server again."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have been coming here for years. Great service and a great menu. The seafood is great and you can't beat the price. This is always a great place to bring the family when they are in town."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying I only eat lobster, no other seafood or fish. We joined good friends at this restaurant tonight. There are no dishes that I would eat so I guess I was forced to order the $34 lobster dinner. I might suggest one non fish item be added to the menu. Anyway I was happy with my meal. The whole Maine lobster was cracked and was very easy to remove from the shell, the meat was very sweet, I had the scalloped potato which was a huge portion, creamy and delicious and broccoli which was cooked just right. The service was excellent.  All in all this was a good experience. Good location, right off the 51. This restaurant is not cheap but worth the money."}
{"text":"Overall LOVELY service and good food. If you haven't tried this place you must try it at least once. The Caesar salad did have a tad bit too much dressing on it but very tasty with one solid crouton on top.  If you're not a seafood eater (I know this is mainly a seafood place) it's very hard for those who don't eat seafood to find a non-seafood dish. But great staff and worth a try.  Going to give the Oreo cheesecake a try (doggie bag take home) Will leave a tip later on how the cheesecake was."}
{"text":"Always love visiting Bluewater Grill.  Fresh fish, cooked perfectly, best sushi, friendliest and most efficient staff.  However, this review is for the monthly wine dinner offerings , in particular the Paul Johnson Wine Dinner on July 25, 2017.  The evening's experience was top notch in every way.  The wine was delicious and pours generous, the vintner was present and did his best to visit with everyone to discuss his wines and winery.  The chef created and carried out an imaginative, mouth-watering menu that was a perfect pairing with the wine choices.  My compliments to Jonny and the rest of the wonderful staff, Jeff the manager, an amazing chef, everyone involved.  If it sounds like I'm gushing, I am."}
{"text":"Mark is the man! New to the area, and this is our favorite spot. Great food and service."}
{"text":"This place is very nostalgic for me, my first job in Phoenix 25 years ago when this place was the Phoenix Fishmarket. The Bluewater Grill is based in Southern California and I'm quite familiar with their location in Newport Beach. We usually are seated at the sushi bar or oyster bar. The sushi bar serves one of my favorites Hamachi Kama (yellowtail collar) Some of my other favorites are the fried oysters the prawns with pasta and garlic and the sushi selection is quite good."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant today for lunch. I had the BLT with crab and it was fantastic. Living near the coast, I am used to fresh sea food and this place seems like it was transplanted directly from the edge of the ocean. They have tanks and everything so it truly is fresh. The food was great but, what impressed me most was the staff. Everyone said hello to me when they walked by, my waitress was so kind and I saw regular customers greeted by name as they walked in. I will be back and I will bring my friends!"}
{"text":"Exceptionally great  Favorite restaurant in Arizona  Nice, professional, friendly Manager, Hard working waitress  I love Bluewater Grill"}
{"text":"Tried the yelp reservation app and it work great including the staff actually reading the instructions so thumbs up to the staff and yelp for that since it allowed a very nice birthday celebration without me trying to make those arrangements after getting there.   This was our first time here and we wanted to try everything.  Finally we settled on the halibut and the red snapper.    Before that we had soup and salad.  The New England clam chowder (the waitress actually tried to convince me of the Manhattan... nope!) was so good that my foodie 11 year old actually ordered a bowl after tasting mine and she has never been a chowder girl.  It was just great, think, full of clams and very flavorful... and absolutely no grit.    Next the seared halibut was delicious.  A generous portion (7-8oz) over a couple of goat cheese polenta wedges and seared greens.  I could have used more aioli sauce.  It was really flavorful.   I can see why this place has received \"Best Seafood in the Valley\" as we are seafood people and used to the abundance of seafood on the east coast as well as in Chicago believe it or not.   The snapper was not quite as good.  We are used to Atlantic red snapper and this was California snapper.  Not sure if it make a big difference but the taste just did not resonate as much.  The Sautéed Summer Squash and Kale as well as the seared spinach were tasty sides so that makes at leas three fantastic sides.  It seemed the snapper was seared and possibly even lightly breaded but it wasn't committed in my opinion.  I would rather have fried, seared or escoviche but what we got was sort of okay and okay means a two to three stars.  Everything else including the chowder and halibut, deserts and service were fives.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday celebration based on yelp reviews. The reviews were right! The atmosphere is welcoming as you enter and has an amazing display of fresh seafood that immediatley makes you hungry. I had the manhattan clam chowder which was excellent followed by the shrimp and scallop skewers which also had fresh grilled pepper, mushroom and red onion. This was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The meal came with a side of cheddar mashed potatoes and brocollini which were both great too.i wrapped everything up with a slice of one of the best key lime pies ever. It was a great meal, in a great setting served by an amazing waiter. Will be sure to return!"}
{"text":"Not great, not bad. Good and average. This place looks like it belongs on the coast somewhere. The food was overpriced IMO- especially the drinks. My husband ordered catfish. It arrived looking like a very small portion with bland, boring sides accompanying the fish. I ordered the cioppino which they made white without the red sauce at my request. Again, average. Tasty sourdough bread served complimentary with meal. The New England calm chowder was was supposedly award winning but I also found it to be average. I know what good seafood is, and while this is markedly better than something like Red Lobster..... it is not anything to write home about. Our waiter was friendly but inattentive. He checked on us once at the very end of our meal. Our bill was over $100 for 2 people. Glad I went, probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Have visited three times now. . My husband loves the clam chowder soup. Says it's the best in town.   We had the Cabo's shrimp tacos and the po boy shrimp sandwich and the clam chowder soup. Everything was perfect from the service to the meal.   I love everything that I ordered . Very good food and service."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi spot in Phoenix. Also great clam chowder and oysters!! You honestly cant go wrong with anything on the menu. It's very neat to watch Mark fire up the grill in front of you. It gives you a great preview of different items on the menu.  Mark and the crew always take great care of us."}
{"text":"We were in town for spring training and saw their sign off the expressway. We made reservations on a Tuesday night since I love a good seafood place. The food was incredible, but the server Lisa, made the experience even better. She was the sweetest server we've ever had. My eight year old so son even commented on how nice she was to us. The atmosphere was great and food was delicious! I'd definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Sushi is top notch....especially the senorita roll.  Stick to the grilled fish and you'll never go wrong. The shrimp tacos are new and awesome. Jeff is the best restaurant manager in town and has never failed to take care of us for small dinners or large business lunches."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our 24th anniversary tonight and enjoyed a fine dinner.  After starting out with a couple Happy Hour drinks we ordered the crab and artichoke dip appetizer that was a little spicy - perfect!  I had to try a cup of New England Clam Chowder and it didn't disappoint. We both ordered the prawn and scallop kabob.  The were prepared well and really hit the spot.  A little disappointed we only received two scallops.  Since it was a special occasion we each ordered a dessert. My wife ordered a crem brûlée and I ordered a raspberry sorbet.  I've never seen so much sorbet served following a meal - easily 6 -  7 oz.  Unfortunately I couldn't even finish half of it and it's not something you can take home in Phoenix during June.  My wife finished 3/4 of hers and was more than satisfied.   From N. Glendale it's a bit of a drive but looking forward to trying it again."}
{"text":"Formerly The Fish Market..looks like the exact same place pretty much..add a few booths and take out a wall. Decided to try the 5 entree choices for $5 deal that they had going. The Sourdough bread is AMAZING!!! My friend and I tried the Fish & Chips.. It was good no doubt, and many will enjoy. But it just wasn't unique enough or amazing for me. There are too many restaurants in Az that DO fit that bill.. to return to \"decent\". The fish is good, it's fresh but it's just that, nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the drinks were excellent, the service was fantastic, everything was perfect. Absolutely love this place. You will like it, and you will return."}
{"text":"Hubby and I just LOVE Lobster Rolls so when we heard that this place was having a special of a Lobster Roll and a cup of Clam Chowder for $20 we just knew we had to check it out! We arrived about 7:00 or so and was seated at a high top in the bar area. Our waiter came right over with a couple of waters and said he would be back to see if we wanted any other drinks. After a while we began to wonder if he was going to reappear when we noticed that he was actually the bartender. So that explained why he hadn't come right back. We waited awhile longer and eventually he came and got our order for a couple of iced teas and the Baked Clams Casino for an appetizer. Neither of us had ever had Baked Clams Casino style so I was anxious to try them. When they arrived there were six on the plate and they were piping hot and looked delicious with little pieces of crispy bacon sprinkled on them! I had to wait a little bit for them to cool down but once they did - man, they were good! I felt that the ratio of clam to bacon to breadcrumbs was spot on. However Hubby felt that the bacon overpowered the taste a bit. On a couple of them I did taste a little grit but not enough to stop eating them! We were almost done with them when we realized that the waiter (bartender) had not returned to take our food order yet. Luckily he came over right as we were going to get up and walk over there and he took our orders. We both opted to go with the special of a Lobster Roll with a cup of Clam Chowder. He asked us what side we wanted with them and after hearing our choices we both decided on the Red Quinoa Salad. Our cup of soups were brought over quickly by him but then we realized that he had not given us any crackers. We waited for him to return but after a while we decided to ask a busboy that was clearing a table next to us. He said he would go get some for us but never returned with any. Finally our waiter came back around to see how things were tasting and we told him that we were waiting on crackers for the soup. He apologized and quickly brought some. The soup was okay - not bad but not spectacular. Our Lobster Rolls arrived and we were both excited to dig in. The Lobster Rolls were pretty good - plenty of meat, not too heavy on the mayonnaise, and a crunchy, buttered bun just as I like them.  The temperature of the meat seemed off a little bit however. I prefer my lobster roll meat a little more on the chilled side (when made with mayonnaise) and this was room temperature. Also Hubby did find a little shell in his and commented that it appeared as if all the meat wasn't from the same lobster as some pieces were cooked better than other pieces.  The Red Quinoa Salad on the other hand was horrid! It had sounded like it would be a sweet and crunchy salad with red beets and almonds but whatever it was tasted just awful. Both of us took just one bite and looked at each other perplexed.  We couldn't believe that this is what it was supposed to taste like!  We were getting full by this time however and so we decided to just let it go. So all in all the meal was pretty good (except for that atrocious Quinoa!) but service was subpar.  It seemed as if we were there a lot longer than what was needed due to always waiting on our waiter/bartender and when he finally did clear the table and saw our untouched sides he never even inquired about them.  Oh well!"}
{"text":"Always excellent service and warm welcome, love having oyster appetizer in a shell excellent taste and any cut of fresh fish is cooked to your liking, would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here since it was the fish market many years ago. This is our go place for oysters, Asian style. .. That's with flying fish roe chopped green onions and ponzu sauce. I will usually call ahead maybe 20-30 minutes before and Order about 3 dozen and they will be ready by the time we get there and sit down. Incredible."}
{"text":"This is the go to place for seafood in Phoenix, Arizona. The people are friendly and help in assisting with your food selection if needed."}
{"text":"Good service and great walleye fish dinner, just right. My husband got a craft beer, 4 peaks, very good. Service was great, friendly."}
{"text":"My wife and I just like the oyster bar, we get the chowder, some oysters and the garlic prawns. Try to order items cooked right there, sets the mood and experience, its cozy, good date spot. Its pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"First time at Bluewater Grill! Very good. I had the swordfish with sautéed spinach and potatoes. My hubby had the Chicken under a brick, every thing is great. The Mai tai is a great drink. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service and great prices. Food was delish. Tons of parking. Good comfortable dinning area. Patio is inviting. I ordered the seasonal Bouillabaisse and it was very good."}
{"text":"Blue water Grill is the only place that I know of in town that you can get a crab Louie salad. I like the San Francisco sourdough bread they used to serve and almost stopped going because they stop serving it. They did find a fairly good substitute. I recommend Bluewater Grill it has a nice ambience good service and good Fresh fish."}
{"text":"We tried the Bluewater Grill in Phoenix recently for dinner. While we had driven by this restaurant several times, we just had not stopped in to give it a try. This time we did ... and we are glad we did.  Large establishment with a variety of seating options. We opted for a booth on the edge of the bar area. Overall, service was good but a little slow on the uptake (slow with respect to menus, waters & drink orders / otherwise just fine). We shared everything and ended up ordering more than we needed .... but enjoyed what we could finished.  Our meal started with wine and sparkling water. For me a Cabernet, Stonestreet - Alexander Valley, CA and for my lady a Chardonnay, Trefethen, from Napa. We also started with a Blue Water Roll along with a Beet & Spinach Salad. The sushi consisted of seared ahi, tempura shrimp, krab mix and avocado which was pretty good in my opinion. My partner liked the beet salad which included oranges, pistachios, pickled fennel and smoked goat cheese.  I don't appreciate beets therefore my opinion does not count. We finished with Grilled Halibut and the Maryland Style Crab cakes. The Pan-seared halibut was served with a parmesan polenta cake, oyster mushrooms, spinach and oven dried tomato vinaigrette - truly marvelous.   This was a solid dining experience. Give this place a try"}
{"text":"Great food. A little pricy however its a great date night place."}
{"text":"Five stars incredible!  I love this place.  Our oysters were meaty and great flavor with an accompanying red wine vinegar sauce and a cocktail sauce with fresh shaved horseradish.  The crab and artichoke dip was incredible.  My wife had the seared scallops and I had the cioppino.  Both were equally excellent."}
{"text":"Last night was my first experience at Bluewater Grill - and I was very impressed.  One of the Managers is a real wine connoisseur and spent a great deal of time going over the whole wine menu with my husband and me.  He has great pride for the wines - as he has personally selected every one and has a number of \"exclusives\".  He helped us select a fabulous Italian red that was great for our meal!  To start we had the oysters on the half-shell, which were FABULOUS with fresh grated horseradish shaved on top of the cocktail sauce, which we blended in (I suppose some people may scrape it off, but I LOVE HORSERADISH).  I enjoyed the King Crab Legs, which were plentiful and delicious.  My only complaint is that there wasn't enough lemon, which I should have asked for more when I ordered them, since I know I use quite a bit.  The ONLY thing I didn't like was that there was no hot cloth to wash my hands with before or after the crab, and not even a wet wipe.  My husband had the scallops, which were served with a delicious spinach and mushroom sauce.  I didn't try them, but he raved about them.  We each opted for our own dessert.  I was hesitant because it was a list of all the typical desserts that are often pre-bought and just served.  But to my surprise, they make all of their desserts on premises.  I had the Key Lime Pie which was tart and scrumptious and my husband had the Chocolate Volcano.  David, the Manager who was so helpful, told us that on Sunday, Mondays, and Tuesdays they have 1/2 off bottles of wine - so I think we will be back on one of those days to try some of the ones he recommended that we weren't ready to \"invest\" in."}
{"text":"We discovered this place during restaurant week and it has quickly become my absolute favorite place to dine in Phoenix!   The staff are always very friendly and courteous,  the food is always wonderful!  I have had everything from their Lobster to their Barramundi along with their Crab Louie Salad and I am never disappointed!  I am and will always be a frequent diner of this place!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a quiet Thursday. The server was very friendly and service was good.   We had the spicy edamame to start, which was good but we added salt as there was none. It also is not very spicy, which is fine but good to know if you like spice.   For lunch, I got a combo of one shrimp taco with a cup of chowder soup. The soup and taco were both very good and the taco had great flavor, once I added the lime that was on the side. I got a side of broccoli, which had literally no flavor or seasoning at all.  They should add at least salt to the broccoli. I am usually someone who thinks things have too much salt so when I add it,  it is under seasoned.   Overall, good meal, the chowder is very good."}
{"text":"We have been to Bluewater Grill before and always enjoy the food and excellent service."}
{"text":"I didn't like this place at all. It had the campy atmosphere of a Red Lobster with much higher prices. Our waitress was very professional, but I'd skip this one and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is a must! We used to live a lot closer to it and didn't really go until a few months before we moved (big mistake). Now its been five years and we make the trip out at least once a month. We've been to just about every seafood spot this town has to offer, minus the more suspect spots and we just can't find the level of service and quality of food you'll find at the Bluewater. Sit at the oyster bar, chat with the chef and order some oysters and steamed mussels prepped right in front of you. Great for date nights and best part is the prices are reasonable. We've only ever had one item we didn't enjoy a couple years back and a manager came over and took care of us right away. Highly recommend this seafood place over any other in Arizona. I've worked at some nice resorts and these guys know what they're doing."}
{"text":"I ate here after the dinner rush on a Wednesday. I was able to get a table in the bar area right away. However, it gets busy during dinner so reservations are recommended. I started with the shrimp cocktail and New England clam chowder. I had the San Francisco Cioppino for my entree. Everything was great. Service was good. If you're looking for a good seafood restaurant with reasonable prices, give them a try."}
{"text":"Delicious! The clam chowder is one of the best! And the oyster bar is excellent! Ben at the oyster bar is a fantastic person, very attentive, a refreshing personality! The Moscow Mule also deserves a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Reserved a room for a lunchtime work event. Great service. I'm not much of a fish person but the food was quite good and there were a lot of choices for all of our guests.  Our waitress Lisa went above and beyond for our room full of people. Impeccable service."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE WAY YOU RUN A RESTAURANT!  My husband and I went here for dinner last night..We both started out with soup..He - New England Clam Chowder...Me - Manhattan Clam Chowder. Both were very good. I was even happier as you will be hard pressed to find anyone in the valley who serves the Manhattan style chowder.  He ordered the farfelle with shrimp and scallops which he thought was excellent. I ordered the linguini and shrimp which was very tasty.  The service was excellent. In fact, they thought our food took too long to come out (we  didn't seem to think so), so the waitress apologized profusely and wanted us to know that the management was buying us dessert for our wait. We were blown away by this, since the wait didn't seem long.  Actually, the manager himself came by also to apologize.  The dessert was the banana's foster tower....OMG....it was awesome...  All in all, it was a very pleasant dining experience and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"First and foremost the service was awesome. We sat outside on the patio which was nice and quiet a bit more romantic as the inside is a bit more what you would expect in a upper end fish house. We had the crab cakes for an appetizers which were delicious more crab than we usually see and one entree was the scallops, which were amazing! We also had the Haddock which was okay. It was a seasonal fish that was just about out of season so I chose it but maybe should have started with what's most popular first as there wasn't a lot of flavor unfortunately, a little bland. We do plan to go back though and try one of the Chef Favorites. (FYI: The scallops were ; - )"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, the fish and chips are phenomenal! The clam chowder is amazing.  Fresh hot bread is brought to the table along with your drink order. The coffee is amazing too!  The restaurant is a bit pricy but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Hubby made reservations and surprised me coming here. I was extremely impressed by everything including our server Kelly. Great service and mouthwatering food, will definately be back for another date night."}
{"text":"My second visit. Sat at the oyster bar. Staff is very friendly. The blacken fish tacos were very good. The non happy hour oysters were delicious. The blue points were ok.  This is one of my favorite places for seafood in phx."}
{"text":"Driving home we wanted dinner but didn't want the usual fast-food items that we always get. So I noticed the sign from the loop and decided to go into the Blue Water Grill. When you walk in you see the lobsters in the tank and they have a bar with television sets so that you can catch a game if you want to. On the other side there's also a dining area. Our waitress was really nice and she gave his recommendations because it was the first times we had been there. We both ordered from the Fresh Fish section and I got a skewer no actually two skewers of jumbo shrimp with a side of cheddar mashed potatoes and a cup of Fruit. My husband ordered the grilled salmon with Cajun seasoning mashed potatoes and french fries. The food was cooked to Perfection It Was Juicy and Delicious and it didn't take too long to arrive at our table. The prices are really reasonable for what you get and the service is outstanding. It was the best place to go celebrate my early birthday. I really recommend this place for everyone who's looking for something different than the usual."}
{"text":"I wanted to have crab while I visited my parents in Arizona. I know, crazy right?! So we ventured out to find a seafood restaurant. I ordered half a dozen of oysters (half from maryland and the other from washington) to start and my dad ordered the crispy calamari fritti. Both were delicious. The calamari wasn't too chewy and the batter was very light so you didn't get that usual \"sick\" feeling when you eat a lot of fried food. For our main course, I had the alaskan king crab with a side of polenta and sautéed squash. My dad had the shrimp and scallop skewers with sautéed squash and cheddar mash. I LOVED the polenta! However, I was a little disappointed about how the crab turned out. The ends were cooked too long, so they had a very bland, dry taste to them. The inside was better. We were in a rush to go to the airport, so I made do with the meal. But, I need to remind myself, it is crab in the southwest..."}
{"text":"Came here with famimy for dinner and catching up, fab food! Clam chowder New England style...to die for. The food is great the atmosphere is good. Loud but nice. I would  highly recommend this place for good eats!"}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to check out Bluewater Grill (probably for dinner) since it was still the Fish Market- I finally found myself here today with friends for Happy Hour. After this visit, i'll definitely be back again to try dinner!  Happy Hour runs from 12-5pm on the weekends, which is great for meeting up with people. There are enough choices on the menu that you can expect to fill up on food, all at Happy Hour prices.  I had our waiter ramble off the list of beers (a good amount which I hadn't heard of, intriguing!) but as soon as I hear the word \"Hefeweizen\", I know what i'm getting. I cannot remember whose it is, but it was tasty. Beer and well drinks are $4 at happy hour- I really wish they'd add some of their cocktails to the specials, they sound so good!  There were 5 of us, so I was able to try quite an assortment of food. (Note: Not everything we ate shows up on their menus online, I noticed the same is true with the beer.) The highlight of the appetizers were fried shitaake mushrooms stuffed with spicy tuna (same as in the rolls). They were wonderful- our server suggested coming back and asking for \"Jared's version\", which substitutes a crab mixture.   From the happy hour sushi menu, I ordered a soft-shell crab roll and a fried salmon skin roll for a total of about $15. After taking a few bites, I decided this was well worth the price, probably even normal prices. The crab was perfectly done (crispy legs but not burnt!) and the salmon skin roll, although it took awhile, was delicious. If you're a fan of California rolls, the one here is excellent and the crab tastes very fresh!  We also nibbled on crab artichoke dip, garlic fries, garlic cheese bread, and fish tacos. Overall, there was nothing we didn't like. At $4-5 per app, 2 (maybe 3 if you're going for a full meal) per person should suffice.   The service was good but nothing special (probably a little less than i'd expect if I were there paying dinner prices). It was the middle of the afternoon and not busy, but our server always seemed in a hurry to get somewhere else. He came by frequently, but I only had enough time to ask him for one thing (water, chopsticks, wasabi, etc.) before he was off around the corner. I suspect all his tables were getting served quickly at least! As we were wrapping up, we mentioned how wonderful the stuffed mushrooms were, and that's when he told us about the \"special\" version in full detail. This restaurant seems to have a lot of favorites and specials and history, despite its recent changes. Can't wait to go back, whether it's for happy hour or a meal!"}
{"text":"As transplanted New Yorkers we continue searching for an excellent seafood experience in the desert, and especially one that features fresh steamed lobster, not just lobster tails.  We found it, and it's right alongside AZ51 at Bluewater Grill. My swordfish was blackened to perfection. My wife celebrated her birthday with the Lobster ClamBake that is just not to be missed. Even the desserts were spectacular.  I'm a very demanding hard-sell when it comes to restaurants, and Bluewater Grill won me over instantly.  Great ambiance, wonderful waitstaff, can't say enough good about it.  We will return again and again every time the sea calls to us."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great service, wonderful seafood and a casual relaxed atmosphere. Plus you first glass of wine is $1.00 from their YELP special offer."}
{"text":"Not much of a selection on the menu & cost is high.  Waitress (Valerie); visit the table to frequently. She made it hard to enjoy (start to finish) our appetizer\ meal. Instead of have a nice dining experience.  We felt that we were getting rushed-  order, eat, pay & get out!!!! The Hot Bread (5 pieces); was served with only 3 pats of butter. Continuously & none stop- saw 4+ restaurant workers; huddling on oneside of the restaurant.  Customer #1: Main dish- Sushi Rolls were placed far in from the table edge. Reaching across the customer; instead of it being placed in front of them. Then placed the Side Salad in front of the customer instead. Customer #2: Arugula/Crab Salad- had many very wilted leaves. Which were pulled out & placed on a separate plate on the table.  Valerie did keep the glass filled. Though- didn't realize the wilted leaves on the plate. As she was clearing the table off. It was our anniversary & the first time there. Unfortunately-not memorable in any positive way to return again..."}
{"text":"Wife and I quite often find our selves here when we are sans kids. Not because it's our  \"date night\" choice but simply because when it come to \"Manhattan Chowder\" they seem to be the only game in town. Of course other choices are also very good. But for us, it's all about the Chowder!"}
{"text":"I come here after a long day to unwind, enjoy some good food and cold beverages.  They have yet to fail my expectations ad I have enjoyed several different menu items, libations, and happy hour as well.  Bartender is knowledgeable and friendly.  I think he's been there for quite a long time.  I'll be back again soon"}
{"text":"Great chowder. Both kinds. And fresh bread which is awesome. The menu includes fresh seafood and veggies. The sushi is reliably consistent in quality and flavor."}
{"text":"Atmosphere good wont go back. After eating there had extreme stomach problems, bad fish"}
{"text":"I will not be going back to Bluewater Grill.  This is my second visit.  The first time wasn't so great, so I decided not to write a review until I had given it a second chance.I went through the photos of food and made some decisions in advance.  I hoped to avoid disappointment by picking things that I had seen and I knew looked delicious. My food was not delicious.  It was soggy and did not taste fresh.  The spongey watery texture and flavor tasted like it had been frozen.  In every photo, one dish was served with a fresh cilantro sauce atop a salad of cucumber and cabbage slaw.  Mine was supposed to come with watercress and peppers in a burre blanc sauce.  No sauce, no watercress, just a few strips of pepper.  in addition, the dish had been created using a less desirable parts.  I would expect that of a lesser establishment, but not from a place that charges upward of $25 per entree."}
{"text":"Great place! The crab cocktail was incredible!  Lump crab and some of the best cocktail sauce I have ever had! Clam chowder and the grilled prawns and scallops where great.  It's a sushi bar on the other side.  Bartender and staff were very friendly. Clam chowder is not overly thick-just right."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the waitress was awesome. I would go back again and I've already told people about it."}
{"text":"The Bluewater Grill is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix! The cioppino is so delicious and the bread is just outstanding. The service is impeccable and the ambience of the place is great. Will always come back for great seafood."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years even back when it was The Fish Market. Top notch place, great staff always courteous and attentive. The food is always great quality and the sushi is awesome."}
{"text":"The main purpose of my visit was cocktails but we decided to have sushi also.  Everything was good and the staff was very accommodating and attentive."}
{"text":"Amazing date night place!  Food was superb, we had the Maryland crab cakes for appetizer, fire grilled salmon and Canadian walleye (panko coated) for dinner, and it was all beyond excellent! Our waitress, whose name I can't remember, was very excited about her job and knew the menu like the back of her hand. She had great recommendations and suggestions.  We will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Celebrated Fathers Day here!  My mom ordered a grilled rainbow trout with jasmine rice and asparagus. I ordered rainbow trout crusted in panko and almonds with Brussels and cheesy potatos. The rainbow trout was fantastic! Thin and flavorful and crispy. I ate it all, and would have kept eating! You can tell the high quality of this fish.   We also ordered grilled artichokes- which is always a must when we visit. And we celebrated with dessert- chocolate lava cake!   Everything about this meal was perfect- flavor & presentation. Our server was very helpful and stayed on top of refills the entire time."}
{"text":"Went to the Bluewater Wednesday 11-9-16.  .  I ordered the $50 king crab dinner.  Supposed to be 1 1/2 lbs crab which consisted of 2 legs, neither had the big claw.  Yukon mash potatoes I swear were instant potatoes.  Cole slaw was tasteless.   Other meal was swordfish  good tasting but small portion, with the same watery Yukon mashed potatoes.  Also fresh saute spinach which was so Sandy and gritty I doubt it was washed.   Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"The beginning of one of the best nights out ever. I keep going back again and again. The service was amazing as more and more people arrived they added tables. The food was incredible and the happy hour exceptional. I love that you can buy the best swordfish I have had in my life home uncooked from thier fish market to enjoy at home as well. The pricing per pound of fish was less than AJs when I last bought fish too."}
{"text":"Facts  Food taste: yummy.  Ordered the grilled veggie salad with the Samick the dressingthe Samick the dressing which is vegan certified. Service: excellent  Portions: excellent Time to receive good: awesome  Other people at the table trout with coconut jasmine rice and squash with kale squash with kale. Price: ok Resturant: clean. Nice ambiance Parking: lots of places available"}
{"text":"Fresh seafood and great lunch service. A great after meeting place for lunch. 2 kinds of chowder for die hard chowder lovers. Mahi  tacos are fantastic and the sour dough bread is the real deal. Sushi is available and the swordfish was so fresh it seems they caught it right before we ordered.  The interior of the building is looking a little worn and could use some freshening but go for the outstanding fresh food"}
{"text":"We were so impressed with the Bluewater Grill on our last visit that we went there first on our return to Phoenix.  We enjoy the talented chef, Scooby aka Mark who works the raw bar at the front of the restaurant.  On our first visit we shared the Cioppino with a cream sauce that he customized for us starting with the best Oysters Rockefeller we ever had.  On our second visit, we split the special Baked stuffed Lobster served with a choice or red or white chowder, we opted for the white.  The special also included 2 sides & a glass of Pinot Grigio.  And once more we started with two appetizers, Oysters Rockefeller & the HH Spicy charred Edamame.  Service was excellent as was our dinner.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and enjoyed myself on both occasions. The food is fresh (Like Newport Beach fresh) and prepared by knowledgeable chefs. I had the Halibut and was impressed with the portion and taste. The restaurant is noisy, staff is awesome and it is as casual as you want to make it. flip flops and shorts works for both lunch and dinner. Fair prices for fresh seafood is always a plus. Just make sure you drive your small sports car and leave the SUV or Cadillac at home because parking spaces are really narrow and the lot is crowded!!"}
{"text":"We received a very gracious response from Jeff Martineau, the General Manager. Thank you, Jeff.  We'll see you on Saturday 7/1"}
{"text":"Hurts me to give only 3 stars because I love this place but tonight was just okay and not the usual great.  Service was slow; we got free desserts due to it but the desserts took almost 10 min. to arrive.  I had walleye pan seared and it was only warm and dry.  I should have sent it back but was already very hungry.  My spouse had grilled salmon with crabmeat salad and really enjoyed it.  Am sure things will be better next visit."}
{"text":"This is our favorite seafood restaurant in the Phoenix area. Steamed clams & sourdough bread are wonderful to start with - have had this many, many times and the bread is always warm & yummy, clams fresh - seasoned perfectly.  Have had many dishes here and they have always been good. One of my favorites is the chopped shrimp salad - the shrimp has always been fresh - with the firm, sweet taste of fresh shrimp. The clam chowder is great too!  The fish dishes are fresh - we have had many of them& sides very good as well - the plates displayed well.  We have never had a bad experience with the Service here either, always cheerful & accommodating.  My only complaint is that the last time we went there the clams were served in a bowl in lieu of the pot they used to serve them in - otherwise would have given it a 5th star."}
{"text":"I'm inbetween giving this a 3 or a 4 star.   Came here with the family, so we had a lot of different plates to try. No complaints on the meat, or the cook on anything. Everything was exactly to order. Oysters were good, but the meat was small. Scallops are good here. I recommend getting anything with scallops. All in all, it got 3 stars because it wasn't amazing, it doesn't leave me with the sense of, I need to have more. Definitely a decent place for seafood in Phoenix. ~I would not do the sushi here, just so you know. ~  Also its pricey, i guess you are getting it imported from another state."}
{"text":"Was in the area and since I once worked at the Fish Market, many moons ago, thought it would be a great change of pace to have dinner there.   Worked out to be a good option.   I had Manhatten Clam Chowder with a glass of Sonoma Cutrer and my son went with the Fish & Chips.   Sourdough bread was warm, soft on inside and crispy exterior.  Doesn't seem to have changed much if at all. Our server was courteous and efficient, but then we were a tad preoccupied with our phones too.   Restaurant didn't seem especially busy but it was sorta late.  It's not quite the Fish Market quality but the food is good."}
{"text":"First time over at Bluewater Grill the other day for the wife's b-day. A friend of hers recommended it. It didn't disappoint. Our server was 5 stars, Cliff. Food, prices, and ambiance were a solid 4. We sat right next to the counter where the food was ready to be taken to the tables. Everything on the menu looked good and everything that actually came out of the kitchen looked great.  It's worth noting that my wife and I both came to the same conclusion over dinner that there was something odd about the place. Nothing crazy, but it hit us. There were some aspects that were upscale and some were casual. As we were sitting there eating and taking it in you really get the sense that it is a peculiar cross between an upscale and a casual restaurant. I've actually not experienced that before. Is it a nice restaurant striving to be upscale? Or an exceptional restaurant trying to be relaxed. It was an interesting vibe nonetheless.   Would definitely recommend. Food was great and that's not always the case for seafood in the middle of a desert. And if you can get Cliff, you certainly won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best seafood and service. The bartender Wade remembered me..and I haven't been here in 5 years! I will become a regular again. Ordered clams kilpatrick which was not even on the menu. Clams, herb butter and bacon. How could anything taste better?"}
{"text":"Don't make a reservation. You will be waiting longer than the walk ins. Reservations are not honored. No one should have to stand for 25 minutes waiting to for their reservation and then be offered only outside seating."}
{"text":"What an awesome experience. Good customer service was not missed for this business. From the moment of walking in the door until we left, we felt welcome and appreciated for visiting the establishment. I would recommend this restaurant to any who live in the area or just visiting, like me. The staff is totally the best. I can't wait until my next visit to Phoenix to dine here."}
{"text":"What a great spot!!  Food and service was fantastic and plan on coming back!  In town to visit family and was in search for a place with fresh seafood.  I was not disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed The Bluewater Grill in Carlsbad. They referred us to the Phoenix location. We enjoyed dinner with family. Lisa was very accommodating. Brought samples of wine before we decided on a bottle. The manager, Jeff, took very good care of us. Wish there was a site in Denver. We will come back whenever we are in Phoenix. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Came here on a work lunch with an associate and was pleasantly surprised with the seafood found at Bluewater. I was recommended the mahi mahi tacos so of course I had to order that. I absolutely loved the tacos and the red quinoa salad was just as awesome! From what I saw it looks like you can also order fresh seafood market-style to take and cook at home! I will be back for sure next time I have a seafood craving."}
{"text":"Server was good and the food ended up being good after an hour waiting for our entree.  The ambiance and atmosphere did not coincide with the prices that were a little high.  Maybe if I had an ocean view our lake view it would warrant those high prices. Sushi prices were outrageous  didn't even try it."}
{"text":"My husband and I have frequented Bluewater Grill even before they were The Fish Market. I, however, prefer the Bluewater Grill. I recommended this to my sister-in-law for a group dinner for my brothers birthday. There were 15 of us. Every single person complimented the food, the private room, and our FABULOUS server Kelly. This was by far one of the best group dinner gatherings I've been to and I just want to thank Jeff and his staff for EXCEPTIONAL food and service. I'm sure you've gained some fans."}
{"text":"I wrote a pretty tough review on March 27.  Since then I have been nothing but impressed.  First you should know that I run an internet marketing company so when I see a business using the internet to interact with their customers, I get pretty exited.  Within hours of me posting my negative review, Larry Macias Managing Partner of Bluewater Grill responded.  He invited me to call him on his cell or at the restaurant - which I did.  He apologized for the bad experience and invited me back as his guest.  I accepted the offer to return but did not want any free meals.  (My previous review was really a knock on the staff, not on the atmosphere or food.)  Long story short, we decided to try it again, but on a big scale. We invited 24 people to my wife's birthday party.  Larry took care of everything and I can now say we are fans of Bluewater Grill.  Our guests had an outstanding experience.  The food was excellent.  The staff was very attentive and professional. And the night became a memorable one.  So kudos to Larry and the Bluewater Grill, for reaching out to us, turning a bad experience into a positive one and demonstrating how interacting with your customers online can turn into a great use of the business owners time.  Remember, he got me to bring 24 people back to his restaurant!"}
{"text":"Landmark downtown fish house, now under a corporate name. It's about the seafood, and there's lots to choose from. Don't miss the fruits de mer!  --upstairs dining was closed, though not sure if this is permanently --subtle changes downplay the former red lobster feel, but still feels local --menu printed daily; I'll have to return to see if it actually changes --quick visual shop of the sushi bar shows the same displayed dullys as usual. don't bother. --fruits de mer stackable platter (see photo) is a fantastic sampler --oysters mostly excellent. so good, i had to order more. --scallops served sashimi style with sweet kelp --crab leg and shrimps good eats! --cedar-plank salmon oily, but nice flavor --fish 'n chips great for every boy and girl in us, but again, oily!  Make no mistake: We don't do NO tableside service! --server must've been forced against his will to prepare tableside in a former job. he SHORE LET ME KNOW he wouldn't do it when I asked about the bananas foster. --instead of the gooey mess which arrived, bananas foster prepared with flair (tableside) would have earned another star.  Service pet peeves: don't take my request (drink order, request for more lemon, etc.) then go 'round your section checking on other tables and taking more requests. Go get what I asked for! THIS IS NOT DINER DASH! You don't get points for how many tables' drinks you can fit on one tray!"}
{"text":"My wife and I and good friends had the pleasure of loving an amazing dinner at Bluewater Grill last night. The place was packed and they kept coming in during our 2 hour experience. Everything was perfect from the moment we arrived. The front staff was expecting us and had our table cleaned and ready. The server, Sean was exceptional, friendly, proficient and thorough. He left nothing to chance and was super attentive throughout the evening. We started out with sharing 2 bowls of New England Clam Chowder and the crab cakes. We`ve had really good chowders on the West Coast in Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz, but this was as amazing as those. The crab cakes were delectable, moist and prepared perfectly with a great and flavorful dipping sauce. Gregg and I ordered the San Francisco Cioppino and it was large, full of delicious shellfish and fish on a perfect bed of linguine. The girls ordered the Fire Grilled Salmon and said that it was the best platter that they had enjoyed in years...No Kidding! We can`t wait to go back again very soon. We highly recommend this dining experience to all!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: JUNE 10 2015: I stand corrected..Great food, tonight...great staff. great menu. Great individual who made my last business trip to PHX a memorable one. This is for you Meow."}
{"text":"Kelly was very attentive and a true professional Tom beginning to end. Food was very good and a great value for the money. Will be back!"}
{"text":"First time I trying this place ... Came during Happy Hour they offer a good range of selections on the happy hour menu. Had the Seniorita Roll delicious! Also tried the wild prawn cocktail it was awesome. Best part is using the Yelp check in feature and getting a well drink for $1 ! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite seafood place in Phoenix. Service is pretty standard but the food is just phenomenal. The fish is fresh and beautifully plated. I'm always sad when I finish a meal here because I don't want them to end! The music playing is always fun and and they serve the best bread while you wait for you food. They also have good happy hours and offer a Yelp check-in offer (as of May 2015).  Bonus: they're next to the Total Wine store."}
{"text":"AJ was the best! came in with the team last night for happy hour and dinner, and this place was perfect! also super close to the hotel im at this week.  happy hour prices in phoenix are the BEST - cocktails here were $5-6 and delicious! i had the margarita, my team did wine and moscow mule. noms!  we kinda went to town on the happy hour menu - got 3 rolls (the vegas roll was my favorite), stuffed mushrooms, crab dip (so good!), and the thai chili wings (my colleagues crushed this!)  dinner and drinks for 4 was around $100 before tax. amazing. i would come back here for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a trip through Phoenix. Similar to a Red Lobster but with fresher fish. A little pricey for the portions. $14 for a scallop appetizer with 5 small Scallops. The service was good."}
{"text":"Loved the food and ambiance in the hot dry desert  I ordered the Phoenix sushi  and the tuna tartare in addition to their classic Caesar salad with salmon just fresh delicious juicy food. They have an extensive selection of beers on draft drinks and many other seafood oriented items on the menu. Plenty of flat screen TVs, clean restrooms"}
{"text":"Our server was exceptional!   Very pretty Gilmarie was so helpful to myself and my husband.   We are on a diet and she went out of her way to make sure we got exactly what we needed to stay within our caloric guidelines.   Food was wonderful, the chef was very creative.  I cannot recommend a restaurant any higher.  Go there,  you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious seafood! We went here last night for happy hour. Blackened fish tacos- DELICIOUS! Senorita Roll- DELICIOUS! Ahi tuna appetizer- DELICIOUS! The calamari was also decent, but was definitely outshined by how delicious the rest of the food was. Other reviewers didn't seem to love the service, but we sat in the bar area and our waitress was fantastic! It is definitely a little pricey, even during happy hour, and the drinks we had were nothing to write home about, but we will be back (during happy hour) for the food! Plus if you sign up in advance for their emails you can get a $10 coupon towards an appetizer or cocktail (it took a few weeks after signing up until the coupon came)."}
{"text":"Went there last night ! It was the best experience, Chef Mark was amazing! Best oysters & clams ever! The chowdas are out of this world!"}
{"text":"Was a great lunch the fish tacos were fresh and the extra avocados are perfect. The wait staff was nice and made sure we were happy."}
{"text":"This was one of the best dining experiences we have had in Phoenix  The service was wonderful thanks Scott and the food was equally wonderful  We will go back for sure I had the Surf and Turf great steak and the Lobster casserole was amazing"}
{"text":"Really good from start to finish!  The service here was excellent and attentive, with any questions answered promptly.  Our table started with oysters that were reportedly some of the best my family has had (I don't eat them).  The cocktails were also well prepared and flavorful.  As for the  main dishes, we had a variety and sampled each others as well.  The various fish dishes we ordered were all very deliciously prepared and came with nice sides.  The rolls that I ordered and shared were also excellent and even my mostly gluten free daughter broke down and had part of one.  The scallops my daughters split were probably the best I've ever tasted, and they agreed.  They also got mussels that they said were excellent (don't eat those either).  We didn't save room for dessert, but were full and very satisfied with the food and service.  We ate out on the patio -- nice area there as well.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have never heard about this place until my office took me here for my first day of work. How excited was this East coast girl to walk in to find fresh sea food! They have a counter where you can buy the good, or you can belly up to the bar for their food.   It has been a bit since I have had a legit cup of chowder. We had some shooters at our wedding last year and it was amazing of course, but to sit with oyster crackers and REALLY enjoy a cup...I would say its been about 2-3 years! This was really good New England style chowder. I had the half tuna sandwich and the cup of soup. The sandwich was good. I was hesitant to get anything bigger because even the half was a bit portion for me. I will have to take the hubby back so we can share a couple things because everything that came out, including the lobster roll, looked and smelled amazing.  Hubs is a huge seafood fan and I would love to take my parents there, because like me, its hard to find the good stuff in AZ, but this place has it!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an overpriced Red Lobster you've found it. Their fish was trash, their mojitos  were trash, their water was even trash. The place smelled like fish and all they had was seafood. Puras fallas aquí"}
{"text":"Always consistent, very good seafood for Phoenix, great service and a nice \"fish market\" atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hubby and I chose Bluewater Grill for a rare date night opportunity and were glad we did. Overall, the experience was very nice. Our service was friendly and prompt. The big reason for dropping to four stars is that some menu items were grossly mispriced. In lieu of an appetizer, my husband ordered a cup of the Manhattan clam chowder and I ordered a side salad. He enjoyed his chowder, but thought the price was a bit excessive for the couple ounces of soup in the cup. My salad was largely iceberg lettuce with a few tomatoes and cucumber pieces and was marked $7.50. The dressing was bland and needed a good dose of salt and pepper. I expected a little more. Other than that, our food was good. The blackened halibut was delicious. The sides, however, were nothing special. Mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach are fairly standard fare. My husband enjoyed his barramundi, but admitted that the halibut was better. I will say that the key lime pie was definitely worth ordering. We would definitely return - just make some different decisions."}
{"text":"I had been in once before for a Chamber of Commerce events and was impressed with the spread so I was really looking forward to coming in for my birthday. We sat in the bar for happy hour (only in bar area but goes until 6:30) and were greeted by our waitress AJ. We ordered a spicy tuna ($7) and spicy yellow tail ($6) to start and were very impressed by the size and freshness of the rolls. I had some questions about the combined chowder option and because it was my first time in AJ brought me a sample of each chowder and the combined one, it was awesome! I prefer the New England to the Manhattan but the combo was divine. My husband ordered the Asian wings and slider. The wings were okay, nothing special and the slider was really pretty plain. That is what you get ordering something besides seafood in a seafood restaurant I guess! I ordered the claim appetizer and it came in a light buttery garlic sauce, yum! We were given a basket of bread for the table which was also very tasty. The drinks were discounted for happy hour and very reasonable. I was surprised when the bill came, next time I won't wait for a special occasion to come back and try the lobster roll I have my eye on!"}
{"text":"Had the fried clams. They were fantastic! A bit pricey, but then again your having clams in AZ."}
{"text":"We're slowly trying the restaurants near our new home in Phoenix, and tonight we had dinner at Bluewater Grill. I wish we'd tried it sooner. Although the idea of fresh seafood in Phoenix might seem a bit of a stretch, the seafood here is excellent. Sean took care of us, and was a delight He did a great job explaining different parts of and favorites on the menu. We started with roasted edamame, which was really good - a bit smoky. Be careful with the salads - they are delicious but big. My husband had the 'Wee' Wedge salad which, as Sean jokingly noted might be a 'Wee bit too big.' We both had Baromundi  - I had the special and Ric had the simple grilled. Both were great - perfectly grilled fish. We ended by sharing a slice of Key Lime Pie, which was very light and loaded with flavor. We'll definitely be going back - it's now our neighborhood seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"walking distance to most hotels in the the Biltmore area; service was great, seafood was fresh, and the sides were exceptional-all for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Great Place! Finally a great seafood place in the Valley. Went here for lunch Monday as my wife was shopping up the street at Last Chance (which I call the Crazy Lady Store). Nice ambiance and atmosphere.   Rock Star service from bartender Heather. She went above the call of duty in her service. I really admire and make note of when a server goes the extra mile. She brought out samples of BOTH of their chowders for us to taste as they were trying new recipes. The New England Chowder was creamy goodness and out of this world. At the end of the meal she offered without prompting to put our drinks in plastic cups to go. Nice extra effort Heather.   Food:   Sourdough bread had great flavor - bit hard on the end caps though.   I had Mahi-Mahi Sliders and they were awesome! Fish seasoned and cooked perfectly. It came with a roasted 1/2 roma (?) tomato that really added flavor to the bite sandwich. Only issue is I bit into it and the friggin' tomato squirted on my shirt. Oh, the bun was also above par buttery and fluffy.   Wife ordered a burger, yes a burger in a fish house - blasphemy I say! Oh well, to each their own. Usually the last thing you want to order in a fish house; however, BWG serves a good a$$ burger. I was pleasantly surprised as my wife gave me a few bites. Bonus for ye ol' land-lovers.   Need to go back for dinner and hit that raw bar.   Double thumbs up for BWG!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had a wonderful dining experience at this restaurant. I had the sand dabs which were perfect! They were served with your choice of 2 sides. I had the mashed potatoes and fresh veggies. Everything was prepared well and very tasty. Others at my table ordered the fish and chips, the trout and the shrimp and scallop kabob (I'll get this next time).  All of us were pleased with our selections and enjoyed dinner a great deal except that the trout portion was a little small for the price.  Our server was friendly and attentive. The manager also stopped at our table and asked if everything was all right and did we need anything else. We wanted more lemon and it was brought to us within 2 minutes.  The best part however, was the mudd pie. I get this everywhere I go and this one was a 10 . A generous portion served on a long white platter with whipped cream, fudge and caramel sauce. The 4 of us shared and it was yummy!  The only thing that would make this restaurant even better is if they would continue to participate in the restaurant.con certificates. They used to and then stopped."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Sit at the raw bar when Mark is cooking there. It's like having your own private chef!  Excellent shellfish. Very good sushi and freshly prepared seafood in a wide variety of cooking styles.   Service is excellent. The fresh sourdough is just yum. Had the scallops last night and it was fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Everything was super fresh and they have the best calamari there is! My 2yr old boys eat 90% of the calamari before my husband and I ever get to it. Fantastic Clam Chowder, one of the best we've had since moving west. It's hard to find great, fresh seafood, cooked correctly but this definitely hit the spot.  Sean is the best server we've had just about anywhere! We will request him going forward! He was super attentive, really understanding with how small kids can be a handful and always made sure they had some sort of food to keep hunger at bay. If he made a mistake he acknowledged it and took responsibility. That's hard to find, usually an excuse will be offered up. Not with him. He apologized and corrected. (Side note he didn't make many mistakes, and the ones he made were minimal, at best. It was just refreshing not to hear excuses).  Seriously you will not regret going here. Made our reservation through Yelp and our table was ready with highchairs when we got there."}
{"text":"Went here for my Dad's birthday it deserves it rating as \"best fish in the valley\". Started with the soup, half Manhattan clam chowder and half new England chowder. It is really good and worth a try. Then I had the Duckett's bucket., which is a huge pail of probably 1t clams and 15 Mussels in a white wine Garlic sauce. Most places give you less seafood and charge more. I though it was definitely worth the $19 price. Dipping the sourdough bread in the broth was a transcendental experience. Service was very professional and friendly. My mom had the chicken under a brick, it was very herbaceous and moist. A good choice if you take a non fish lover in your party.  For sure going back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"We walked frequently to the original South Coast Plaza location of Bluewater Grill, and were very pleasantly surprised to find one right here, on Camelback, in the middle of this Midwestern winter paradise.  All our favorites FRESH (a miracle in PHX) and mostly unchanged from the Santa Ana and Newport Beach offerings: superb fillets and steaks, the seared ahi tuna, and the battered fish and chips (the fish so light and batter so grease-free--amazing and deceptive).  Since sushi is not a feature of the OC menu, I'm not surprised to read that it has been phased out.  What remains, including the hot, fresh-baked Sourdough Bread, is what has made the restaurant a favorite at home.  Friendly (though not overly trained) staffers, a lovely heated patio (ignored by Phoenicians), ample portions (share a Caesar salad, share a fried calamari and a seared ahi appetizer, share a main dish, share a dessert).  Try not to fill up on bread (and yummy butter).  Walk on over, bring the dog, and enjoy the fine spring or fall night air on the candlelit patio you'll have to yourselves.  It's not Durants; it doesn't want to be."}
{"text":"First time here was a not so good experience. Left a yelp review and immediately heard back from the general manager, Jeff. Not only did he sincerely apologize, he personally sent us a hand written letter and gift certificates for our next visit so they could \"earn back our business\"!   I was amazed. It is very rare that you find that level of customer service nowadays!!   On our next visit, it was a completely different experience. Service was very helpful and attentive, thanks to Sean our waiter, and he also made a killer recommendation for the Mahi Mahi.  Our appetizers (scallops, crab cakes) were quite tasty. And then the Mahi Mahi! Wow! Came with a deliciously perfect risotto and the balsamic syrup made the entire dish. The flavors were amazing together and I can honestly say it's one of the best dishes I've had all year!  A big thanks to Jeff for taking care of us so professionally and getting us to come back. I am very glad we did and we will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"Yes, Virginia, there is a decent seafood house in Arizona. In the seven+ years we've lived in Arizona, Bluewater Grill has been our favorite destination for good fish.   It has the feel of an east coast fish house, with wood floors, a weathered deck leading to the entry, and even a small fish market just inside the front door. Keep going. Either head to the sushi bar or the dining room, where you'll find at least a dozen fresh fish options. On our most recent visit, we chose from: Halibut Mahi Barramundi Sand dabs Walleye Trout Rockfish Scallops Shrimp King salmon Ahi tuna Snapper Cioppino bursting with shellfish of every type  Not to mention there are burgers, a steak and chicken for those who can't tolerate good seafood.   Every piece of fish I've devoured here has been perfectly cooked, a generous portion, and accompanied by two sides. Try the cheddar mash or polenta, or just about anything green. At my last visit, the Brussels sprouts were a tiny bit rare and hard, but my walleye was so light and perfect, I was not about to whine.   Dinners are served with sourdough bread and butter. Salads and soups are available at an extra cost. The chowders are especially good. They offer both Manhattan and New England chowders...and both are superb, loaded with fresh clams and veggies. I have often dreamed of having one for a starter and the other as my main entree. Yeah, that good.   Coming from the east coast, where Legal Seafoods claimed to have the best clam chowder, I can safely say this is better. Don't believe me? Ask for a sample.   Service is always warm and friendly. The manager is always on site and is actively involved in making things run smoothly.   Bluewater Grill has a full bar with creative cocktails, and they offer a small selection of desserts. I tend to go for the key lime pie. It's tart while still perfectly indulgent.   Dinner prices start in the high teens, with most in the mid $20 range. For fresh fish, this is perfectly reasonable. Sure, there are a few high end steak and seafood houses in Phoenix that might offer more options, but at double the price.   I'd much rather dine here and spend the extra on chowder."}
{"text":"Had another wonderful dinner at Bluewater Grill the other night. You can't go wrong with a great meal, wonderful employees and fantastic managers.  They recommended a really tasty bottle of wine called Juxtapoz, a red blend that was outstanding.  The Oyster Bar with the \"Dream Team\" is where the action is....check it out!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting tonight. Easy reservation. Ordered Atlantic salmon. Well seasoned but slightly undercooked for our tastes. Excellent choices of sides. Yukon cheese mashed potatoes were yummy as was the summer squash. Son enjoyed his cod fish and chips. Definitely must return especially for the glorious clam chowder. Will request that fish be cooked just a little more next time. Service excellent although no mention was made by anyone of our 35th anniversary we were celebrating that I had noted on our reservation."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood and spotted Bluewater Grill. I've had this place on my list to try. We came here in a Sunday afternoon, just in time for Happy Hour. The raw bar was filled, so we grabbed some seats at the Sushi Bar.  We took advantage of the Happy Hour menu/beer options and started with a large Sapporo while perusing the menu. My dining partner opted to order the Salmon, Yellowtail, Tuna HH Nigiri and the Spicy Tuna Roll. We also shared a dozen Blue Points for $20 (great deal). I ordered the Steam Clams and also a bowl of Manhattan Clam Chowder.  The Oysters were excellent, very fresh, they came with 2 Sauces and freshly grated Horseradish. The Steam Clams in the broth were also excellent along with the bowl of Manhattan Clam Chowder chock-full of veggies and clams. We did find that the sushi was disappointing. Fish was OK, way too much rice. The Spicy Tuna Roll, though huge was OK. I know that next time we come we will stick with the non sushi menu.  Great Happy Hour Deals, will be back again, but not for the Sushi."}
{"text":"I so lucked out with the Bluewater Grill.   Was driving by and decided to stop.  Wonderful Happy Hour...'til 6:30pm.  I had the Senorita and the Spicy Avalon rolls.  Delicious!  Next time Ill go for the traditional Nigiri.   Service excellent.  In fact, looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Feels like a chain restaurant.  Smells like fish, and not in a good way.  Very few tap beers, nothing really special.    HH menu is NOT what it shows online.  It's almost all fried/unhealthy, not really seafood-based.  Between me and my guest, we literally couldn't find something good to eat and went to The Parlor instead, which was a great move."}
{"text":"Sadly, I have to give this restaurant 2 stars. My boyfriend and I came here the other night and we were really excited and hungry for seafood. Although we do not live off the coast we live in Arizona we were still optimistic for delicious seafood. Our service was wonderful ! It is what made our entire night . He was prompt,polite,accurate. Everything you hope for in a server. But then the food... Very expensive food for mediocre taste. Very disappointing . If you're going to charge almost $30 a plate, please make sure the risotto isn't bland. Or there is only ONE scallop in my dish. My bread was so crunchy I couldn't eat it. I won't be coming back here due to the prices . Just not good enough for the value of the meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant expecting to get some really good seafood, based on the reviews. He ordered the lobster, which was rubbery and dry and I ordered the swordfish, which was like chewing on cotton. To top it off, my swordfish had absolutely no seasoning on it and the side dish of spinach was not seasoned either. Some of the worst seafood we've ever had. Perhaps it's the fact that we come from the Gulf Coast and are used to terrific seafood but this place stinks, literally. I would not recommend this as a choice if you're looking for good seafood. I'm not a big fan of Red Lobster but their seafood is even better than this place. I wish we hadn't wasted our money here. It was far too expensive for what we got."}
{"text":"Much to my delight I visited again on a Monday and was told it was  1/2 off all bottles of wine. Whoohoo! I sat at the bar and started with the Ducketts Bucket, it was a generous serving of clams and oysters in a light wine, lemon butter broth. I had the Mahi Mahi special for my main served with a side of leeks. It was all pretty delicious.   The food seems to get better every time I come here. I need to remember what a great happy hour they have."}
{"text":"Best chowder! Rachel in the bar is our favorite server. Great drinks, sushi, and best service in town."}
{"text":"We ate at the Oyster Bar and was served by Mark who also cooked our food in front of us. If you want awesome service, Mark rocks! The food was superb. I had the oysters rockafeller, arugula and crab salad and the miso swordfish. The hubby had the mahi mahi. My plate was better. Enjoyed every bite. THANKS Mark for your fantastic service!!!"}
{"text":"I have had several meals here and the service has always been professional and attentive.  Food is good, they know their fish.  Try the scallops if your in the mood!  worth every penny."}
{"text":"The food tasted OK and the service was above average. The value at their price point however, is not. My wife ordered the halibut and I had the scallops & shrimp skewers. There were 2 scallops and 4 shrimp for $26.95??? Halibut \"market price\" was $32 and change?? We probably will not return."}
{"text":"Came for a birthday dinner and had an amazing time. Got a cozy table big enough for our group and had an excellent waiter. Love the coastal vibe you get when you walk in with the wood planks outside that make you feel like you are on a pier and all of the sea decor inside. We had calamari to start which was delicious and a very large portion as well. The swordfish steak was amazing! My dad recommended it and I'm so happy I tried it for the first time here. Definitely a must try. Had a great birthday experience here with my family and would definitely return back in the future :)   (Btw they also offer free soup for military veterans as well)"}
{"text":"You don't expect to come to the desert and find the freshest, most perfectly prepared seafood we have ever experienced!!  And I mean any where!!  The service was as incredible as the food.  From oysters, to shrimp, to Mahi Mahi, to the Barumundi..  All I can say is AWESOME.  A must stop for foodies.  The decor is of an old fish market...  Really works!!"}
{"text":"We asked for a table by the ocean or on the water, but the restaurant is actually by the 51. Our waiter made up for the lack of location, or water view, though. He was thorough when explaining the menu, found us some bread (that wasn't a day old), and was that perfect attentiveness.  We started with the calamari fritters, which were non-chewy (translation: cooked perfectly). The mustard-looking sauce is worth dipping into.   I love catfish, but not this catfish, which was bland. Green beans were OK, but the coleslaw was great. After a bite of my daughter's trout, I'd definitely recommend it over the catfish.  The Key Lime pie was creamy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Best seafood in Phoenix.  We live in Chandler and always struggle to find a good seafood restaurant in the east valley.  Unfortunately, there aren't any.  Bluewater Grill is worth the ride.  The seafood is fresh and perfectly cooked.  I ordered Mahi-Mahi with sides of broccoli and asparagus.  The fish was perfectly cooked and the sides were generous and delicious.The service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very attentive and helpful.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This review is for the fish market portion of the business.  I have not dined in but have purchased halibut and salmon to prepare at home and highly recommend buying your fish here.  Far more fresh than any local grocer including whole foods.  It's a bit more expensive but worth it.  I have returned fish to many of the regular groceries around here after getting it home and taking a close look at it...so I'm so pleased to have found Bluewater, this is the only place I will buy fish from now on."}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming to Bluewater. It is well managed! The food is amazing! Sushi is the best in town. And they have a market to buy fresh fish!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love our sushi we got.  Senorita roll.  Definitely check them out so yummy"}
{"text":"Fantastic seafood dinner with the family celebrating Father's Day. My husband couldn't have been happier. Fresh oysters on the half shell, mussels and clams in wine and butter broth, whole lobster, Alaskan King crab, and Cioppino!! It was hard to decide, the fresh fish selection was amazing!! I would recommend this restaurant to everyone!!"}
{"text":"oysters are always fresh and flavorful here!  the fish and chips are under 10 dollars and are enough for two full meals!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge foodie and I've eaten at some pretty great restaurants and have high expectations. I came here based on the reviews and decided to try it. I had the jasmine seafood bowl and the arugula crab salad. Both were very disappointing. I am scratching my head as to why so many great reviews. Perhaps a bad day when I came in?? Either way, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Valentines dinner...  Place was packed and the food was amazing.  We sat near the kitchen window and I was impressed with the sanitation and the quality of food that appeared to be being cooked and coming out."}
{"text":"We come here a lot, I still say they have the BEST CLAM CHOWDER-truly the best in the city. The servers have always been top notch. My husband says regularly that I throw around compliments like man hole covers-so with that in mind when I yelp I take food and service into consideration.  This is the third time this week we've been here to eat... Tonight was different, tonight we had to sit and listen to waiters discuss amongst themselves their Austrian heritage- their bloodline- and their Irish descent which quite frankly I don't care about.   What I do care about is their sushi which Ive  never ordered before.  I asked the server (the rudest and slowest one we've ever had) whether the rainbow roll was made with \"real crab\" as indicated in the menu. She asked the sushi chef and I was told it was.  When it was served it was obviously NOT real crab.  When I complained it was taken away and replaced with an order made with real crab.  Then the unpleasant female server along with a ponytailed white/grey haired male employee proceeded to talk loudly at the resister beside us and the fact we returned the \"FAKE\" crab in the rainbow roll. Yes we will return, but we suggest when ordering sushi that's advertised with real crab that you check it, because their fake was a pretty good imitation."}
{"text":"Greeting- yes Vibe- gothic energy Price- moderate  Service- very good Parking- garage Bathroom- fail. Bathroom attendant. It cost me $10 I tips! Food Shrimp dumplings were good but restaurants should let Chinatown keep them. Paying ten times the cost uptown is ridiculous  Blue cheese topped filet mignon was horrible. Probably The worst filet I ever ate. It was stringy. Accompany fries were ok. Desserts Chocolate molten cake. You know how I feel about these. Enough with this once game changing dessert and now a tired artifact.  Creme brûlée was very good as was the biscotti it comes with.   WIGB? No"}
{"text":"Not the best place for a Saturday evening out. Noisy, crowded, and cramped. The best part of the evening was our server Maddie, she was delightful. My husband's meal had to be returned, looked like bland fish sticks, and it was supposed to be grouper. My scallops over spinach were drenched in olive oil, and that is all I could taste. Bread is generous and tasty. Not planning to ever visit this restaurant again, for the price there are plenty of other places to have a much better meal."}
{"text":"Came here in January 2015 for the first time. Great food and great service. So we made reservations for Valentines dinner. The food was still good but not the service this evening.   There was an issue getting my wife seated. They had seated me and when my wife came she was told that I was not seated, and she waited 10 minutes or so before they remembered they had already seated me.  We ordered chowder and expected it prior to the main course.  We waited a long time (eat all the bread) then came the main course - no chowder. When I asked about the chowder they offered to bring it then. Not what I wanted. They offered to package it for takeout. Also not what I had wanted. I canceled the chowder.  The main course was good.  The bread we ate waiting for the chowder was good. Wish we had been offered more."}
{"text":"What a difference, from the previous time we were here. This time I ordered the Cioppino with pasta and it was very good. Our server Erica was excellent and very attentive she did a wonderful job and we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We always like to eat our big meals at lunch.  We had a groupon to this place so I wasn't expecting much.  The food was really good.  I had the Ono and it was cooked perfectly.  The staff was very knowledgable about their offerings and they do have daily specials.  We went on a Saturday afternoon and there was a nice diverse crowd.  Sat outside - awesome.  The ultimate recommendation - I would go back...and have."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Best Place in Phoenix for seafood without a doubt. Our waiter Scott was awesome."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a recent Tuesday night around 7:30 PM...I was amazed that the restaurant and bar were pretty full, which is a very good sign for a relatively new restaurant on a weeknight. The decor and ambiance was nice.  It had a good feel and the customers and staff were very friendly. We didn't have to wait and got a nice booth right near the bar...the service was a little slow because the server assigned to our table was also the bartender and she kept needing to go back behind the bar.  She was very friendly and we were not in a big hurry, so it wasn't a big deal for us.  The food was pretty good. We both had some sushi for an appetizer - the Senorita roll is very good! This is our new favorite roll.  My husband got the swordfish and I got the seared Ahi tuna.  I was a little disappointed in the thickness of the tuna cut.  It was a very thin cut, which was fine since I was pretty full from the sushi.   It was seared medium rare, and the menu said rare, I should of asked for their definition of rare because to me, rare means most of the tuna is still red...it was about 1/2 cooked, it was still fine for me.  The price was a little high for how thin the cut was.  My husband loved his swordfish, he asked for it broiled which is different than the menu description, it was not a problem for the chef and it was done very well.  We will be back, its a good seafood place for the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I have been traveling to Phoenix for the last five years and a good authentic seafood place with an oyster bar is hard to come by- I think I have found my favorite restaurant here- the food is great the ambiance is awesome Ben at the oyster bar is a great guy and cook! The only thing is the sushi portions are a tad bit on the small side-BUT the quality is great! I will definitely return and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have dined at this restaurant several times and never been disappointed! Great sushi, too, and the clam chowder/sourdough bread makes a spectacular meal to bring home on a cold winter's evening.  Wonderful place to get fresh fish, this is my favorite seafood restaurant in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"You CAN get fantastic seafood in the desert! No really! Like, fresh, awesome, delicious seafood! The staff is top notch, the prices are right, and the seafood is absolutely stellar considering we are nowhere near an ocean. Bravo. Will absolutely continue going back to this place.   Seriously, after 5 years in New England, both the Mrs. and I were blown away by Bluewater. It reminded us of our local haunts back in Boston and was an all around incredible dining experience."}
{"text":"Not very pleased. Made a reservation over a week ago for a romantic dinner. Apparently, it was lost. But we were seated at a table for 5 surrounded by kids. Then reseated in the bar. 15 minutes later our server arrived. Got our first cocktail by 715, which was mostly simply syrup. Our server said this was a consistent issue with the cocktails. OK. Maybe tell us first? Asked for no bread or dairy on my salad...so it comes with cheese and toasted bread.  Good thing that came before 815pm, which is when dinner arrived. As usual, it was \"We are so busy\". Really? The bar was half empty after 645. We had no one around us. Maybe the wait staff just wasn't paying attention. I will not be back. Don't go unless you have plenty of time to wait for 2 drinks and dinner. It took almost 2 hours!"}
{"text":"Love this spot. Situated just above the 51, I'm shocked at how lovely the patio is in the winter. Awesome selection of fresh seafood. Lobster rolls are one of the most memorable items. Happy hour is a good option in the bar."}
{"text":"I went here at the suggestion of a client.  When he suggested a seafood restaurant in AZ, I replied with a joke (isn't AZ land locked).  WOW, was I surprised.  I had the Pacific Snapper special.  It was fantastic.  The crab cakes appetizer was really just average.  I liked the beer choices.  The service was outstanding.  My guests were really happy with their meals and the service, as well."}
{"text":"Ordinary, not good enough for what you are paying. I ordered steamed mussels, and they had hardly any flavor at all. I had to send them back with instructions on how to create flavor with a bit of fresh garlic and white wine, and fresh lemon I added. Others in my party had mediocre dishes as well by their report. I do cook and have experienced great restaurants, but food can be wonderful at any level. Come on folks our money is real and good, food should be as well. I remember having decent food here when it was Fish Market, what happened?"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my friend for lunch. Good food and nice atmosphere. However the bartender during the day is really not the best. She has rarely come by and after the third time she gave us her name. She was friendly but not the best. Explains why she works during the day. We won't be back for awhile."}
{"text":"This place is never really that busy on the weekends. I don't know why because it is very good! Just went there last Saturday for a birthday celebration. We had the ribeye and trout. Very good and good service!"}
{"text":"Food was ok - service was super slow!!!  Our waiter was nice, but there was a long backup in the kitchen.  It also took about 20+ minutes for our bar drinks to be served, and even longer between water refills.  The issue we had with this was that the place was pretty dead, so there wasn't really an excuse for it.  We enjoyed the fried clam belly, the mud pie was to die for, the oysters were good and the cioppino was pretty good, the lobster roll was just ok.   Overall, ok place, a bit on the expensive side for what they provided."}
{"text":"Husband enjoyed oysters and a rainbow trout. The sides were great and dessert was ok. Wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Their New England Clam Chowder is the best clam chowder I've ever had! Well, I've only had that and Campbell's so..... Seriously though, my husband said it's really good. :)  The Casino clam was pretty good too. Can't go wrong with clams topped with bacon!!  I had the fish n chips (standard) while he had the Mahi mahi (the \"best\" fish in the world according to our world traveler friend) and he said it was excellent.   Service was great. We'll probably come back to try some of the other stuff. :)"}
{"text":"I really loved the food here. Salmon was fresh and delicious. The Phoenix roll was good too. I wouldn't recommend it though if you don't like sweet tasting entrees. Also, if you're mostly wanting sushi rolls, I probably wouldn't recommend this place as there is only 5 rolls to choose from on their menu. If you're looking for fresh fish entrees, give this place a try! A bit pricey, but definitely worth the cost."}
{"text":"I love coming here with my family. They have great prices on oysters for happy hour. My kids love the kids menu and the \"dirt with worms\"dessert. My favorite dish is the cioppino, you have to try it! They make the best and I've tried a lot of other places and nothing compares. We love coming here!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night with my mom, sister, brother-in-law and nephew. We called when we were on our way at about 6pm. They person who answered the phone was very friendly and made sure our table was set-up when we arrived.  Our waitress was superb! She recommended the barramundi-it was absolutely excellent! The coconut rice mixed wonderfully with the jalenpeno sauce and the arugula with crab. The fish was cooked perfectly and the presentation was great.  My mom had the Pablo covered prawns-she liked them, I thought they were ok and should have been meatier. The calamari was very good and the clam chowder was ok. The bread is also phenomenal.   We loved out service and our meal. Everyone was super pleasant and it is a place we will definitely be back to in the future!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and for the most part pretty decent service. The decor seems a little dated but i would definitely be back especially for the San Francisco Cioppinno. Others had the swordfish, halibut and mahi mahi and everyone loved their food. Great place for fresh fish and seafood."}
{"text":"My wife and I started at the new location in Newport Beach when it first opened. We have since relocated to Chandler AZ and are now fans of the Phoenix Location. It is a great addition to the Phoenix area and we enjoy it very much.  Our favorite is to have our meals at the bar area.  We love the Oysters  Rockefellers and the Seafood stew. Help is very friendly and try to always make our visits a wonderful time.  Thank you for all the pleasant times. Looking forward to 2018."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and went on a total hangover-driven seafood binge: fresh shrimp, crab, oysters, clam chowder, and scallops. They all tasted better than we expected. The bartender/cook was engaging and I also downed a better-than-average bloody mary. At this price-point these guys have the best seafood experience in town. (oysters were only $1.25 ea)"}
{"text":"I love seafood! So I was really looking forward to coming here. The crab dip was really quite good, but no one taste or saw any crab...just artichoke. But like I said, it was really good and we wound up ordering a second one (there was 6 of us) Entree portions were of good size, prices were kinda big, taste was average (except with what my mom had, I think it was the tri tip? WONDERFUL!), server was uninterested/uninteresting (service itself was good. Prompt.), nothing to write home about.  It's a more expensive, less tasty Red Lobster. But still good enough to be 2 stars. I would give it another chance. Maybe I just ordered the wrong item."}
{"text":"This was seriously one of the best places we'd been to in awhile. We don't eat out that often but when we do we try and make sure we're getting the most for our money. This place didn't disappoint. We'd seen most places that had lobster tail for 29$, my husband got a whole lobster for 35$ along with 2 sides! Even though I went with the lunch option the coconut rice was amazing and the mixed fish bowl was so fresh and tender! Totally recommend that if you're able go here!! We'll be sure to bring family here whenever we travel towards the Phoenix area. Not to mention the staff was super kind and accommodating to us."}
{"text":"The only reason I am not giving them ONE star is because our waiter provided excellent service. The place has an unpleasant fish aroma... the swordfish was good compared to the over cooked and bland Ono fish I ordered.   our tuna appetizer took 20 minutes to finally get to our table but at least our waiter offered us bread while we waited.   The best thing about this restaurant was the YELP offer ( $1 for your first drink if you check in on Yelp)"}
{"text":"I ordered the crab cakes and grilled fish tacos and was satisfied. My girl ordered sushi and she also like was satisfied. Our waiter was helpful and friendly, and did a nice job overall. The restaurant looks great inside and out."}
{"text":"I don't give out 5 stars too often, but when I do, you bet it's well deserved!   SERVICE: Our server's name was Kat, or Cat, I can't remember but she said its Cat \"like meow\".  First, I could go on and on about how GREAT her service was. It was mine, my sister-in-law's, and our friend Mary's first time there, and we had now idea where to start, it was such a large menu. They are a seafood/steakhouse but there were SO MANY combinations. She made recommendations for us based on what we were looking for and we all left so satisfied. Mary and I had the Fire Grilled Mahi Mahi with Risotto and Arugula Salad, Kat recommended we add the Cajun flavoring, and I think that made it all the better. My sister-in-law had the Miso Glazed Swordfish and I had a taste of it as well, it was OH SO BUTTERY! We also had fried calamari as an appetizer, and creme brûlée, also recommended by Kat as a dessert, and very much recommended by me now. As busy as it was, she was on top of things and oh so friendly. Best waitress I've had, EVER.   PRICING: $$$  Pricey, but worth it. I could see myself coming here, maybe every few months, maybe for an occasion or a special date night. For the 3 dishes we ordered on spot, 1 to go, fried calamari, and the vanilla bean blackberry creme brûlée our total came out to $147 before tip. Each plate came out to about, $25-$30 each.   ATMOSPHERE: We ate outside on the patio and it felt like it was something straight out of a Nicholas Sparks Movie, fairy light strings, soft music, wood deck, and lots of greenery.   OVERALL: I'd take Nicholas Sparks on a hot date here if I were 20 years older. Only kidding, but you get the point!"}
{"text":"Go visit Mark! He's the man! Menu knowledge is on point. Great with guest. Super easy to talk to. He's located in the front raw bar."}
{"text":"Our waitress, Kelly, gave up on asking us how our food was because she already knew after the appetizer. The spinach, crab, and artichoke dip wasn't as bad as our faces may have shown, but it was different and lacked flavor of the crab and there wasn't any cheese flavor at all either. It, much like the rest of the meal was very bland. The scallops had a gritty texture as if they were drug through the sand and then thrown on the grill. The cod for the fish and chips had a light and fluffy batter, but the cod lacked any flavor whatsoever. The lemon wedge served with the cod couldn't really save the poor fish.  The golden cheddar mash though...delicious."}
{"text":"We meet here every week for our networking group. They have an awesome hosting loft area with its own private kitchen and bar. This place is great. Food is always amazing and staff is friendly. With the variety of menu that they offer you can bring any mix of company here and be confident they will be able to find a delicious dish. For the seafood fan this place is your go to for seafood in Arizona."}
{"text":"The clam chowder was amazing. I wish I would have dine on this amazing chowder for my dinner selection, however I ventured out and chose the prawn and scallops skewers,  was not a good choice for me. Very bland, however my boyfriend chose the prawn linguine pasta, it was fantastic.  I Will come again."}
{"text":"really good seafood selections.  tough to do in Arizona!  our waitress was knowledgeable and pleasant.  will definitely return next time I'm in Arizona for spring training baseball."}
{"text":"This place has really slipped.    I think I've made my last visit.    Service was spotty, food was so so."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, delicate flavor, delicious  food! Nice relaxing ambience, nice and friendly staff, I was expecting a different kind of cuisine Thought."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the sushi, steak or seafood as I don't eat meat, but wow! The service was one of the best experiences we've had in a long time. Came here tonight for my fiances bday and the bartender/server was one of the most attentive, nicest and most polite people ever. And it sucks that I can't remember his name but hopefully the owners will look at the schedule and give him a nod.  The only thing that made me give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is the fact that when the SO asked if they had any vegetarian options for me (since I was taking him out for dinner at a place he chose but id still like to eat a little bit more than free bread), they gave us, what looked like, a half ass made vegetarian option menu that was printed off center and upside down.   Would probably go here for his next birthday, though."}
{"text":"Another Smart Shopper deal opportunity to try Bluewater Grill. The deal was for $5.00 California roll, Spicy tuna, Philadelphia, the Caterpillar and Bluewater roll. Normally, it would be $7.95 up to $14.  As I looked around, I recall the memories of having lunch/dinner here when it was the The Fish Market.  I thought the place was larger before. Anyhow, going back to food, sushi was just ok.  Their famous roll was the Bluewater roll, normally $14, definitely not worth it.   If it wasn't for the $5.00 Smart Shopper deal, I don't think I would order any of the rolls at regular price.  This is certainly not a place for sushi lovers.   However, I do like the normal HH cook foods.  The cheesy garlic bread was delicious.  It was very cheesy!  Calamari Fritti with Cocktail Sauce was crunchy and tasty.  I find it interesting that their website HH menu has the Burger Slider with Fries & Melted Gruyere & Blue Cheese for $3.00, but on their HH menu at the restaurant it's $4.00.  Keep this mind when you order.   http://bluewatergrill.com/menus/index/articles40.htm Service was good when it wasn't too busy."}
{"text":"Best sushi and seafood evva! Service is a 10 sushi is honestly on a different  (higher) level then any other place I've been to. I'm personally allergic to shellfish, but I love sushi so it's really a gamble when I goto restaurants serving it. I asked the staff if they could substitute fish for any shellfish and they did beautifully  (other places just take it out). I'll be back very soon and very hungry!"}
{"text":"Having been born and raised in Hawaii and spending nearly my entire youth fishing and eating what we caught, I believe I know good seafood. This place has excellent seafood! The fish was fresh, well prepared and well portioned. The atmosphere was pleasant and homey. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a special night out or an impromptu date night!"}
{"text":"First visit to this restaurant. Great service. Nice environment. Casual to dressy. Love the menu. The San Francisco Cioppino was excellent.  They have it 3 ways I went with the marinara they also offer a white wine sauce."}
{"text":"I don't love fish, but even if I did, I wouldn't love it here.  This restaurant has been here for years.  My first memory of it was when I met a lady from a Cat Rescue program, when I adopted my beloved kitty Fluffy.  Fluffy died recently at the age of 15, but she was an awesome cat.  That memory is the best thing I can say about Bluewater Grill.  As for the restaurant itself, the food is blah.  I admit the food looks beautiful when served, but the taste is just meh.  My fish and chips were average, but the Cole slaw tasted weird.  My husband said his blackened mahi mahi was pretty good, but it was a bit off putting that they charged an extra $1 to blacken it.  Really?  Isn't seafood expensive enough without nickel and diming, people?  The Restaurant.com coupon made the price a little more tolerable though.    The wait staff was friendly and the service was good.  They even gave me a black napkin when I was seated because I was wearing black pants.  I always consider that a mark of an upscale restaurant.  However, Bluewater Grill isn't upscale.  The location overhangs a freeway and the booths and tables are more reminiscent of a TGIF.  The restaurant does have a fish market with a variety of raw fish available for purchase.  While we were dining, quite a few people came in and bought the fish to prepare at home.  Maybe that's a better idea than dining in here.  IMPORTANT UPDATE  After reading my review, the owner / manager of Bluewater Grill sent me a private Yelp message and expressed his concerns over my negative comments.  I am very impressed that he took the time to read the Yelp reviews in the first place and then reach out to communicate with me.  He's obviously very serious about making his restaurant a better place.  Kudos to him.  :)   And for that, I'm upgrading my original 2 star rating to a 3 star."}
{"text":"Great place for seafood in Phoenix. Fish is fresh and the price is reasonable. They also have happy hour specials if you come at certain times during the day."}
{"text":"Wow! Ambiance was right on for an east coast seafood joint. A+ The clam bucket is amazing; order 2. Crab cakes were true to form and chunky, flavorful and rich. The beet salad exceeded expectations. They custom made sushi for the kid, she was thrilled and felt important. So A+ customer service. I loved being able to get reservations here on Yelp, it saved us 15 minutes :) A+ We will be back to try everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"First time coming here with my best friend for our 5 year frienniversary    I ordered off the \"restaurant week\" menu.  I got oysters as my appetizer, grilled scallops for my entree, creme Brûlée & key lime pie for dessert.  All were delicious !   Our server was very friendly and catered to everything we needed!"}
{"text":"Best seafood in town. Clam chowder that you will always look forward to.  Have never had better fish!!! If you have never been to Bluewater Grill and you like seafood, your missing out."}
{"text":"I am now a HUGE FAN if the FRESH Oysters. They were fantastic. We visited from Northern AZ and I was stunned to find a place like this in the middle of this dessert!!! - Although we found the place fine with GPS, the sign was quite big but the access via the mall parking lot is kind of tricky. Also there was a very pungent odor of seafood in the lace, a bit overwhelming, but the ambiance was delightful and perfect for my husband and I to celebrate our anniversary. We had the Maryland fresh catch of the day oyster platter and WOW!!! Not a fan of the Sushi we ordered, but I must say that the service was fast and friendly. We will definitely come back for the Oysters ;-)"}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten here in several years.  Last time was shortly after the changeover from the previous concept and felt the quality just wasn't there anymore so was a little skeptical this time around.  This time around I was pleasantly surprised.  The fish was fresh and the waitstaff timely and professional.  I can now recommend Bluewater without reservation!  Reservation as in hesitation - can't speak to having a physical reservation since we dined early and didn't need one :)"}
{"text":"Coming from the West Coast, I've been cautious about eating seafood in a land where even the cactus look dehydrated. When I saw the Tuna Takeover Tasting event though, I knew it was time to adventure beyond the occasional poke restaurant. It was a gamble that paid off for sure!  Food: We had a group of four, and we were all doing the tuna tasting. Each tasting was $25 and came with your choice of a giant Sapporo (Not erm... Sephora, Mark H.) and sake, or a glass of Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc. The tasting was a plate of Soba noodles (made from buckwheat) and about 6 pieces of fresh tuna. There were 3 types of tuna: bluefin, Big Eye, and Ahi. The noodles were lightly seasoned with probably a ponzu dressing and topped with these delightfully spicy sprouts.  I was a little worried about whether there would be enough food at this tasting to satisfy all our appetites, but with the complementary bread and butter, it was sufficient.   Service: Our waitress was excellent. Madi made us feel like old friends and took great care of us during the entire evening. I would come back again because of her.   Room for improvement: The reason this restaurant/event didn't get my 5 stars was because I expected more from the tasting. I was expecting more of an 'event' where, like the online descriptions reported, we'd get to learn more about fish and sustainability. It would have been better if there were a few smaller dishes, rather than just one dish with the different types of tuna interspersed.    I'll be back to this restaurant - the table beside us got some amazing smelling chowder and I must try it."}
{"text":"While tempted to give 4 stars, I know it is a solid 3.  It may not be the coolest or hippest place for happy hour or to grab some seafood but it is still one of my favorites. I am convinced they have the best sourdough bread in the Valley. Their happy hour menu offers drink and sushi discounts, and other favorites like sliders (burger or calamari), salt n pepper shrimp, calamari, cheesy garlic bread...all priced fairly. They have more stuff on the happy hour menu, I can't recall everything.   My last visit I had a Stella Artois, the Oysters Rockefeller (not on the happy hour menu but my favorite here) and an order of Garlic Fries (off the happy hour menu). The fries were just as good as some of my favorites from Gordon Biersch, crisp garlic goodness. The Oysters Rockefeller (4 to an order) filled nicely with creamy spinach and topped with cheese...and served with sauteed spinach. Mmmmm....  I find myself continually going back. Mostly during happy hour of course, and sitting at the bar. Enjoying each time I go."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi I've ever had!! The chef made the most amazing looking sushi and it also tasted so good! I am definitely coming back for more! My waiter was fast with water and food coming out. If your looking for a place with quality food and fast service blue water grill is the place to go!! I recommend this to all my family and friends."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and very friendly staff. I highly recommend this place! Try the senorita roll"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday at about 4pm. The place itself is kind of split in two. The happy hour is only in the bar area so that's where I went. The waitresses I had, Cat and Brianna were both very nice and helpful. They let me sample a white and red wine to decide which I wanted. Decided on the red. Yelp saved me $5.75 with the $1 first drink. I ordered fish tacos $6 during happy hour and from the sushi bar $6 Philly and $8 Vegas both happy hour prices. Overall the food was about average but the service but I give it an extra star for service. Yet take one for the prices. May be back but only happy hour"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a great meal here last night with a date! Since it was my first visit, I asked our server DLYNN for a recommendation on a cocktail. I asked about the 'Strawberry Smash', and she said it was great. Unfortunately, the drink was very bland(my date agreed). I let it sit until after the calamari was served. At that time I did mention it to our server, and ordered a Bloody Mary which was so 'Smashing', my date ordered one, too! My first drink was compted by the manager. Shared the fried Calamari-very moist and tender, fried and seasoned perfectly. It was a generous serving that filled the plate. Asked our server what the two sauces served on the side were, and I think I caught her completely off guard...luckily, I still had the menu at the table. And was able to share with her what they were! The table next to us had already been served their entrees, and I happened to glance over and saw an amazing dish that one of the diners had. It was the Seared Scallops surrounding a bed of spinach with mushrooms-totally delicious! Since I am a transplant from Seattle, I really miss seafood that hits the mark. This place was busy, so obviously, the food is worth the money spent. Note: I did try to  order Oysters Rockefeller, but they were already out of oysters, and this was before 7pm! Be sure to ask what they are out of before ordering...  For my second visit, I will try Happy Hour and see how it compares!  Rita C."}
{"text":"Yeah I know it's a chain, but the fish is fresh and the atmosphere is nice. We had the grilled trout with jasmine rice.  The cioppino was bountiful with, crab, shrimp, clams, mussels, scallop, and fish, the grilled bread was great to soak up everything."}
{"text":"Great Seafood and plenty of choices.  I was there on a Sunday evening and they were offering half off on bottles of wine!  YaHoo!    The food was perfect if a little pricey.  The wine, and the presentation, was excellent.  Service was great and I'd go again.  The sourdough bread is to die for.  If you love seafood, cooked the way you like it, then this is a place for you."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. Need to get over any images one may have from the days of Nick's , which I know I had (busy fish house in late 1990s). The place has aged, but the food was decent and service not bad. Visited on a week night so things were slow (though it is the holiday season). My guess is it's getting trumped by all the \"hot new\" in Central PHX these days. Go if you really want seafood but it might feel a little like Red Lobster."}
{"text":"It was our first visit and it was great. The atmosphere was like being at the ocean. The fresh fish display as you enter the cheerful smile from the hostesses.   So glad I brought my Jeanie here for her birthday dinner.  She was craving steamed clams.                                            And our waiter , Rolland (sorry if the spelling is wrong)  was great ,  cheerful, helpful and really enjoyed  him going over the menu and choices . His Mustache was a eye catcher too :)  .                                                                                                                                         Again, for our very fist visit to the Bluewater Grill we are looking forward to coming back and is now one of our favorite places to eat. Thank you for a great evening.                                                                  Tom and Jeanie"}
{"text":"Omg!!! Horrible experience dining here. My boyfriend and I made reservation last night for our anniversary dinner date. It did not go well. The only positive about this was our appetizer which was crab and spinach artichoke dip. That I enjoyed at least. After that, I ordered a 10 ounce steak medium well and my bf ordered salad. I waited at least 20 mins for my steak and I was super hungry. The steak was really salty like they put the whole bottle of salt. I complained and told them I didn't like it. I ordered sushi instead and didn't enjoy that either. I waited long for the waitress to come back to my table and refill my water. She took so long. I felt like she forgot about our table and assisted other guests. I won't be back here, I didn't enjoy my anniversary dinner nor service. This restaurant did poor on everything."}
{"text":"Man, growing up in the northeast we would always have clam chowder when visiting Boston. This place is just as good in my opinion. If I ever crave clam chowder or want a nice dinner, I'll be sure to come back. The prices are expected and the staff is great and attentive. Honestly I could stop by and just have some chowder for a quick meal for a good price. It's phenomenal."}
{"text":"Perfect. We were in the mood for a beer and seafood and this place came up via yelp. We had the lobster roll, grilled artichoke, and a dozen oysters.  Service was top notch and so was the food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Been here several times over the years, really enjoyed it when it was (The Fish  Market) Stopped in there a week or so ago on a rainy cool evening craving some clam chowder, it tasted soupy and bland, then ordered one of my old favorites Ducket's bucket, I remember this being served in a large brass pot with ample clams and mussels, this time there was barely enough for a couple decent bites got served a small piece of burnt bread to go along, what makes this so disappointing is that the place wasn't very busy. In conclusion left the place 40 bucks lighter with a bowl of chowder,a small serving of clams and a bud, I might go back after the snowbirds have cleared out but it will definetly be a while."}
{"text":"We seen the sign from the highway a few times so thought let's try it We had 11 of us and everything from the fish and chips to the Ahi tuna was perfect"}
{"text":"We eat here a lot because it's in the hood.  I must say I liked it better under its previous ownership as The Fish Market, but they retained many of the same dishes as before (they kept it in the family, evidently).  The sushi is good and in general the fish is very solid.  Prices are a little on the high side but tolerable.  When available, I enjoy the fried Ipswich clams, but wish they had them steamed.  Pasta dishes are good and they have the best sourdough bread in town."}
{"text":"Great food. Service was good. We were there for happy hour so we sit in the bar area . The menu items were very good and large servings. Fish tacos and crab dip were tasty!    Clean, plenty of seating and several TVs to enjoy sports!  The main restaurant looked nice as well."}
{"text":"I've never sat in the actual restaurant. We always come and sit at the oyster bar. Let me tell you it's delicious. The boys there are so nice and friendly. They know exactly what I want to drink and they keep it coming.   The steamed clams are perfect. The prawn cocktail is so fresh.   What really makes me coming back is how well we are taken care of. Tonight the oyster bar was full and I could have taken a seat at an actual table. Instead I decided to wait for seats to open up. Meanwhile one of the gentleman brought us drinks for our wait.   I highly recommend blue water grill to everyone I know in the area. Thanks for the great food and service."}
{"text":"Wouldnt want my review of the entire bluewater restaurant to be about my server. Let's start out with the table next to me had a intentive, knowledgeable waitress & The bar tender knows her drinks! (: I will return to Bluewater!!!"}
{"text":"I am going to give this place 5 stars first our server Kat (hope I spelled this right) was a top notch A #1 server. Let me say the slaw here was amazing I ordered the seafood platter and all of the food was seasoned to perfection. I will make this a regular spot as good seafood is hard to find here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We ate in the sushi bar and had a fantastic lunch.  The service was top notch, the food was fresh creative, and made to our tastes.  Sushi chef Lorry was amazing!  She was attentive and very creative.  Her service was stellar, and her rolls were delicious.  Judging by other people that came in and  told Lorry to \"make me something wonderful\" solidified that she is a sushi master.  Will definitely make this a go to place for high quality sushi and great service."}
{"text":"First time here because the  restaurant week menu seamed to pull me in! I was not disappointed! AJ was also a great server the entire experience was exceptional. This is my new favorite seafood crave"}
{"text":"Great Maine Lobster Roll (h/t - I lived in Portland, ME for 8 years), and I've eaten many of them in the Northeast.  Thank you so much for giving me a taste from my past.  I'm might have to get a whole lobster for my 6th visit! My dining partners similarly enjoyed their fish dishes.  The sides are tasty, and the prices aren't outlandish.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Above and beyond kind! Best crab legs ever! Made our late night Anniversary dinner amazing. Thank you thank you"}
{"text":"Bluewater Grill:  The successor of The Fish Market!  I had the pleasure of dining here with some of the ladies on the second day of their grand opening!  While the prices and portions are about the same as the Fish Market, the food was pretty decent!  The four of us shared a Baked Dungeness Crab & Artichoke Dip, a Mahi Mahi entree, a seafood [I forgot what it was but it had two types of seafood] ravioli entree, and two Homemade Creme Brulee!  Out of everything we had, I think the Baked Dungeness Crab & Artichoke Dip was the best.  The Mahi Mahi was a bit dry, the ravioli itself was a tad bland although the sauce was incredibly flavorful, and the creme brulee was amazing!  My boyfriend's sister actually works here.  Since she wasn't working, I couldn't get her to serve us but we had the most delightful waiter:  Joe!  He was very patient with us [four early-20 girls = not easy to handle] and was very amusing [Enunciate the \"Creeeeeeeeeeeme Brulee\"]!  A word of advice:  The entrees are a bit small so definitely stick with an entree each person!"}
{"text":"We came here last night for the Tuna Tasting event and had a blast!  Our waitress, Maddie, was very sweet and attentive and had a great sense of humor (at least, she was willing to put up with our rambunctious table).  For $25, we had either beer and sake to pair with the three different types of tuna or, for the non-beer-drinkers, a nice glass of Sauv Blanc wine.  Each tuna was served two different ways, one raw and one seared, and they were served on a plate of soy-sauce noodles with sprouts.  Most entrees at this restaurant fall in the $17-25 range, so when you look at it, $25 is a good deal for an entree and a drink.  We also devoured a basket of delicious fresh-baked bread.  I was a little bit disappointed, though, that we didn't get to hear from the chefs and sommeliers; the advertisement stated that we would learn recipes and pairing secrets at the tasting event, but this didn't seem to end up being part of it.  When you come here, don't forget to check in on Yelp!  They've got an awesome check in deal."}
{"text":"Stopped by after many years and had a fabulous happy hour with Chef Mark!  The oysters he grilled and served with a beurre blanc sauce were beyond words delicious.  I'm stopping now to enjoy the mouth 'gasm. Ahhhhh"}
{"text":"We have been going to the Blue Water Grill since it changed over because it's just a great place to gather. Tonight we sat at the bar and Ben took such wonderful care of us. Although he is not classically trained (he taught himself) his blendings of-tastes is incredible. I had Serrano chilies in my clams and pasta which was delicious. Ben is talented, charismatic and nice. Wow what a great combination."}
{"text":"This is a very good spot for seafood in Phoenix, AZ!  Great selection on the menu and the atmosphere is fantastic.  Highly recommended to anyone who likes seafood."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a great seafood restaurant for several years in the Phoenix area. We found it!  The fish was fresh and perfectly done.  Nothing ruins good fish than even the slightest over cooking, they get it perfect at Bluewater Grill!  The New England clam chowder was great, large chunks of tender clams in a not too thick or thin cream base.  We had blue point oysters and grilled Spanish octopus for appetizers, both were wonderful. I had blackened redfish and my husband had blackened swordfish served on a bed of dirty rice, topped with a corn and avocado salsa. The menu had several specials and a wide assortment of fabulous choices. We'll have to go back often to try them all. Nicole, our server was very friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. We enjoyed her.  The atmosphere is perfect, along with the paintings on the wall!"}
{"text":"5 Star seafood! Very delicious! (See photo for my silly face attacking the food. Except I used an actual chopstick not fork for my sushi. HAHA!) Additionally, their service is also fast and efficient. I had a great time here. The price is good and affordable as well. The vibrance feels so nice! Menu has a lot of food option. Totally recommending this place!  Oh and this is where my boyfriend and I went out for our first early dinner date! so this place is pretty special! :)"}
{"text":"On vacation....waitresses was nice and keep drinks full.  We order clam chowder, mussels and clams, seafood bolenase and seafood ciapinao. All the seafood was fresh.  My wife enjoyed the mussels and clams. My favorite was the new England clam chowder. One of the best I've had in a while.  The chowder had lots of meat and a great base. I will try and post the pics"}
{"text":"The special was Chippino. Very good. Large amount of seafood. Nice sauce. Over pasta. Wife had the swordfish, said it was well seasoned and a nice portion.  Good beer."}
{"text":"Manager contacted me directly when I had a not so great experience my first time there.  I went again with friends, and ordered something different and it was perfect!  Will return again, especially with that management PR!"}
{"text":"IN LOVE WITH THEIR KING CRAB LEGS!!!  Best I have EVER had in my entire life.  Food is UNBELIEVABLE, bread is so hot and fresh, and service is unlike anywhere else in town.  It's a bit pricy, but you get everything you're looking for and THEN SOME!!  Steak and lobster go good together, try the duckets bucket for starters and then dive into the crab legs or lobster.. You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Always delicious, fresh food. I haven't tried anything less than amazing. Oysters are delish. Their crab cakes are great and the grilled octopus was phenomenal. I could eat that every day. Tried the trout dinner last night and it was so good, large portion, too. We made reservations online and in the comment box, I noted that it was our son's birthday. At the end of our meal, our wonderful server made mention of that along with a piece of chocolate cake for my boy- even better that he was low key about it and didn't bring a group to sing happy birthday, which is always so annoying. Thank you, Bluewater for always giving us such great dining experiences, every time."}
{"text":"The food was good, but for the price, I was a little disappointed.  The staff was very friendly and our waitress was great."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Scott was a great server. Made excellent suggestions. . And wasn't wrong about any of them. The spinach crab dip was perfect. Best clam chowder in AZ. All sea food is delivered daily. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I love the consistency of all the dishes here. I have been ordering food for take out for the last few times, and the food were amazingly fresh and delicious. The folks here bake their own sourdough bread, and man oh man, it's to die for. Highly recommended for family or friend get together. The lobster clambake was AMAZING ."}
{"text":"Oysters were amazing .... the sea salt oysters  ( I call them) were salty and delicious!! They were huge and delicious!!!! I ate 14 oysters!! Also had bread and butter, hello that was amazing !!! Great place ... Ben at the oysters bar is such a nice man and can read your mind when helping pick a dish!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some clam chowder and brews after getting rained out at a spring training game today.  Our server was friendly and attentive, the chowder was delicious (manhattan and new England both!). I had the tenderloin appetizer which was in a chimichurri sauce with peppers and onions- tender and yummy with quite a kick!  This location has a sushi bar too.  Make sure to check for Yelp checkin specials- mine was honored happily ($1 draft beer, wine, or well drink!).  They have beer- and wine-paired special dinners here from time to time, which sound awesome. If I lived here (I'm from CA) I'd definitely be back to check those out."}
{"text":"Great seafood and service! Happy hour oysters are wonderful.  My son had the fisherman platter and was thrilled with the size and assortment of yummy seafood.   My husband and I split the seafood pasta and added a cream sauce rather then tomato and it was very good.   Our server exceeded our expectations by splitting our meal for us and guiding us through the menu."}
{"text":"The restaurant was excellent. Much better than the Fish Market which I found to be no better than a glorified Red Lobster. Service was amazing, and the quality of the fish and seafood was excellent.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. I had scallops that were very fresh and tender. The keylime tart was also excellent as was our server, Roland."}
{"text":"Made a reservation on a Saturday evening to celebrate our anniversary. Arrived to find out we really didn't need one for the place was half empty at 6:45. Hostess sat us in the bar area next to where they prepare the sushi. Our waitress Chevy was at our table within minutes to take our drink order and ask if we had any questions regarding the menu.   Bread and drinks arrived. Bread was hot and fresh, but we had no utensils, only chopsticks were on the table. When my husband asked for table wear she made a funny and bought it right away.  We ordered. King crab for him with rice and mashed yukons. I ordered a bowl of New England clam chowder and appetizer order of scallops and fennel salad.  We waited, and we waited, while our drinks had run dry. The 2 ladies that were seated behind us after we were received not only their appetizer but their entrees while we waited, and waited.  Finally, our food arrived.   The chowder, the best I have ever had. Full of large clams and small diced potatoes. The scallops presentation was spot on, but they had sprinkled black pepper over them which over powered the delicate sweetness of the meat. The fennel salad was good but not sure if I would eat with scallops. My husbands 2 crab legs were huge and split for easy eating. My husband said the 1st leg was wonderful but the 2nd had that iodine taste some seafood has. He didn't touch the sides. The potatoes looked like a pile of paste on the plate. I thought the rice looked good but he didn't want to eat it. He said he wasn't t sure his plate was worth the $50 price tag.  Overall, the experience was pleasant enough, but a little expensive. I would go back for the chowder and bread if I was looking for lunch on a cold rainy day.  Restroom was clean but the trash was overflowing with used paper towels."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Cheesy bread best ever. Las Vegas roll.  Pasta with garlic prawns were best I ever had. Servers so nice.   Manager Jose Figueroa very kind to customers and employees.  Highly recommend. Great happy hour menu!!!"}
{"text":"This has some of the best oyster and fresh seafood. We had the blue tip oysters they where Devine. We got the lobster roll with drawn butter. The lobster was sweet and soft and perfectly cooked. The bread was toasted giving it and extra oomph. When also shared the bluewater roll, the Cajun seared tuna was an amazing touch to the roll.  Our water was attentive and made sure we had all that we needed.  The ambience of the patio was romantic with the soft lights and the soft warning cool breeze blowing off and on.  I recommend this place highly"}
{"text":"We had a few different fish dishes, sides all were good. The only negative is the key lime pie. It isn't traditional Florida. It is more of a cheesecake. The filling tastes ok, the crust was hard as a rock, obviously the batter was over worked turning it into stone. We mentioned it to the waiter, he didnt offer any solution so we just ate around the crust. PASS on the key lime.  Service was good,not great. Pricey for the portion size of fish, 8oz is $18-32 depending on what you order."}
