{"text":"The food was very good. I saw it once and decided to try them out. I must admit it was a good choice. The price reasonable and the selection is great. I will be stopping by again, that's for sure."}
{"text":"This is a true New york style chinese place.   Its located in an old quiznos and they didnt really remodel so dont expect to come here and sit down and eat.   Tons of vegetarian/Vegan options. Check it out"}
{"text":"Ya know, I've realized that I am quicker to give a restaurant a bad review because when you get a bad meal, you want to let others know immediately.  However, when I get a good one, it doesn't always dawn on me to tell others immediately.  I've been ordering from Tsing Tao for over a year, and I just want to say how pleased I am with their excellent food. I constantly order one of their chefs specials. The walnut shrimp is simply amazing . I always get that dish, then add one, plus appetizers. Chinese food is always very easy to reheat the next day. All their food holds up. I've lived in asia, and also lived in the sf bay area for many years. There are no bad Chinese restaurants in that area. The population simply doesn't stand for it.  This restaurant could compete there. So, looking for very good Chinese food around the mesa, tempe, chandler area. Give this restaurant a shot. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Was craving some Chinese food but didn't want to brave the hell outside today. So I just ordered delivery from this Chinese restaurant I had never tried before. The ratings and prices are very good. It claimed to have free delivery on orders over $20. So I went and placed my order thinking I'd I've have some leftovers for tonight. Will there's a catch with the free delivery.....it has to be within 3 miles. I know I'm so far out of their way have to go a whole 3.09 miles so naturally the extra 400 get equates to charging me the delivery fee. I would have much rather, which I still will, give the extra to the delivery driver for dealing with the 120 degree heart on father's day. I can say I will never eat at this establishment again. Hopefully the food lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Food tasted very cheap. Couldn't eat it, went to subway instead. I recommend cleaning the walls."}
{"text":"For what it is, it's definitely 5 star worthy.  Food is fresh and cooked like they know what they're doing.  If you order delivery, seems like as soon as they finish cooking it, it's on its way to your door.  They always say 45 mins but its NEVER that long!  I've been inside once to order and the owners and staff are very nice and hustle to get your order done.  Not sure if they state that they are MSG free, however, I know they are.  How do I know? Because places that use MSG give me what I call the \"Chinese food burps.\"  Meaning that, for hours after I've finished my food, I'm still burping with a Chinese food flavor."}
{"text":"The Chinese food here is 1st rate. The seasoning is fantastic and great portion size. The food is high quality and extremely fresh. The Orange Chicken was the best I've tasted around town. Everyone should try the fried wontons. They put a good portion of cream cheese mixture in the center and the flaky crust is nice and paper thin with the emphasis on the cream cheese. They also let customers choose from fried rice or steamed rice. Prices are great. This place is going to be a \"regular\" for me."}
{"text":"The food is very good tasting  fresh, not too greasy,not too saltyx the vegetables are  fresh and crunchy The price is reasonable ..delivery is generally  fast ...all in all a pretty good delivery Chinese food  for Mesa. . The orange chicken is my favorite.  it really is not too heavy the sauce comes on the side so you can control how much extra sweet goes into it... my husband likes the broccoli and chicken or broccoli and beef ...the egg rolls are okay nothing to write home about.. I do wish they had plain brown rice as a side I think they used to and don't anymore at least I don't see it on the menu"}
{"text":"Kung Pao chicken is horrible. From the watery bland sauce to the raw peanuts. 2nd time I have been suckered into eating here. Never again."}
{"text":"Looks like I got a free add on here.... Killed EVERYTING for me! Oh but I was offered half back... Yea.... GREAT service. Save yourselves! Don't do it!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, this was perhaps the WORST Chinese I have ever had. I am not sure if I just had a bad cook, or if something else was going on.   The fried rice I received was orange (never had it that color before) and it had a fishy after taste to it. Wasn't my kind of thing. Hoping that was all that was wrong, I went ahead and tried the egg roll with my meal.  Not only was I welcomed to a squirt of grease coming from it, but it tasted horrible. The casing was soggy and it really wasn't worth the money.  Disheartened, I knew I probably throw in the towel. But I went ahead and gave the sweet and sour \"pork\" a try. They breading was mushy and inedible. The meat, probably wasn't pork. Honestly, it didn't even appear to be chicken.  My friend was eating the beef lo mein. He chocked down about 3 bites and we threw in the towel. We ended up going somewhere else for lunch.   Be cautious when/if you go here."}
{"text":"I had this delivered to me and it was fast and hot. The food was great. I read some of the reviews on here and it sounded like some people were just being too damn upity about it. Chill out people!  I ordered the fried dumplings, orange chicken, pepper steak, and pepper and onion shrimp. The fried dumplings(potstickers) were great! They actually use a lot of real ingredients inside! Very good. The orange chicken was great. I usually never get orange chicken from places because it tends to be too sweet, but this was just right. The pepper and onion shrimp was fried, and still kinda crispy when it got to me, I can only imagine how amazing it would be if I ate at the restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Just had our first order from here, and we had great food and service. We accidentally ordered chow mein when what we wanted was lo mein (we're from CA) and they called us soon after we placed our order to confirm and we switched to lo mein. When the food arrived it was VERY good and they actually gave us a free order of egg rolls. Our kids loved it too. This is definitely our Chinese delivery place now"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery through Grub Hub and they quoted 45 minutes but it was here in 20 which was awesome! I only wish they did not have a delivery minimum. I ordered the spicy orange chicken with white rice. It was perfect will fresh orange flavor and just a little kick. My friend and I shared the Egg Drop Soup which was nothing special but we needed to hit the minimum. I loved the Rangoon while my friend enjoyed the Egg Rolls. This will be our new Chinese delivery spot!"}
{"text":"The food from this place always tastes fresh.  I have only ever ordered delivery and yet the food still arrives hot and steamy.  It's amazing!  Their portions are almost TOO large (one order will give me 2-3 meals) but the price is still extremely affordable.   If I have any complaint is that on more than one occasion they've messed up my order. Today I ordered the Subgum pan fried noodles and ended up with some kind of chicken w/peanuts and vegetables in a spicy brown sauce. Fortunately I'm adventurous  and don't like to complain so I figured I'd just try something new today.  I was not disappointed (though I think the dish could have been better without the peanuts... but since I don't know what they sent me, maybe the peanuts are essential).    Honestly, any time they do mess up my order I've never felt the need to have it corrected because whatever else gets sent is still delicious.  Also, delivery is super fast compared to a lot of local restaurants."}
{"text":"Great customer service, great ambiance, great food! Would recommended any day of the week!!! And their delivery service is top notch."}
{"text":"We decided to try \"Tsing Tao Chinese Cuisine\" for dinner last night. Prior to ordering our food, my wife called the restaurant directly to ask if they use MSG, and also, to clarify how certain dishes are prepared. The person who answered the phone was more than helpful, and fielded all of our questions in a polite and understanding manner. Not long after we placed the order online, our meals were delivered promptly, and courteously. The whole family was impressed by the generous portions, and the overall quality of the food. Not to mention, the food was still hot when it arrived. I definitely recommend \"Tsing Tao Chinese Cuisine\" and I will be ordering from them in the near future."}
{"text":"I am so happy to finally have a decent Chinese delivery around us!  We got a flyer on our door so decided to try it last night.  The food is AMAZING!  We ordered (2) sesame chicken, pork fried rice and moo shu pork.  The portions are huge and the food is fantastic.  Delivery was super fast.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because I specifically asked for hot mustard and sweet and sour.  They sent 3 packs of hot sauce.  Well done, Tsing Tao, well done!"}
{"text":"I can''t get over the process it took to get my food ordered.  It seems as if no one there actually listens.  The guy on the phone did more talking than listening and was just spitting stuff out.  He asked me for my address and I started with \"1031\" and he'd interrupt along about the \"30\" part and say \"1069\"? So I had to go \"1\" pause for 5 seconds, 0, pause for 5 seconds because it was clear that he was a moron and didn't want to hear me to begin with.  THAN, the driver calls me and says he can't find me the address was wrong.  THEY PUT FLYERS ON MY DOOR!!  The food was \"okay\" but I think from now on I will go with Chopsticks Express, better food and not all the hassle."}
{"text":"Always cooked to order, super fresh and will make it anyway you like it. Not to mention the great customer service and the positive attitudes of all the employees."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would.  Ordered food at 6:45 pm.  No delivery at 7:45 so I called.  They acted confused and first person who answered didn't speak English. Finally they say order us ready they are waiting for driver.  To return   Call again at 8:05 still no food delivered.  They say driver us three minutes away. We live three minutes away from the place.  No discount offered nothing. Food arrives at 8:20. Order inaccurate.  The be if us died by get to eat.   Call then back. They just say sorry. Horrible place. Never again. Don't waste your time.  I will go back to my usual place even if I have to pick it up"}
{"text":"Really, really good Cantonese cuisine... Hot, fresh and DELISH...great dumplings, fried items were nice and light, not greasy... Shrimp was plump,succulent and perfectly cooked. Chicken was all breast meat and the sauces were great... First time I've ordered, I'll definitely be back!! Great job, keep up the good work!!     Just got dinner here again and realized why I LOVE this place so much.... reminds me of home/college...I'm from NYC... and yes... I get thats a 7996 mile distance from Canton...but it tastes just like home... in fact, I actually worked at a joint... sorry, .... establishment, w/the same name taking orders... before I left for a bookie joint...... settle down, it was college and it payed better.... probably because it wasn't strictly legit.... I digress... the food is quintessential, PERFECT Cantonese... I know because the folks I previously worked for were FROM Canton and this is the closest thing I've had since then. Tip of the hat to them, and the folks that own THIS Tsing Tao.... if it wasn't for those lovely folks... I'd have STARVED, and been broke through college... so thank them, for an engineering degree... sort of, and thank THESE lovely folks for dinner and the memory..."}
{"text":"I love this place! I go for lunch maybe 2-3 times a month and everything is piping hot fresh and taste is great! Pricing is awesome for the amount of food you get and the quality!"}
{"text":"No"}
{"text":"I guess I've been spoiled by the place I normally go to, but after moving downtown I was excited to try some Chinese delivery. It definitely isn't bad food in the least, and for the price you actually get a good bit to eat. The sweet and sour pork was great, orange chicken was good too. Fried rice was alright and the lo mein was tasty. Not a huge fan of the egg drop soup though. IDK it was yellow, I've never seen yellow egg drop soup before, it was different.  Over all, I would order here again. It was decent food for a good price :)"}
{"text":"I've only ever had their delivery, it is always prompt under 20 minutes even though they always quote 45, lol. The food is definitely great for the price, really good portions, we are big eaters and always have leftovers. Don't forget to ask for utensils chopsticks or plates if you need them, they never freely include them but will gladly package them if you ask. Based on the amount of your order they always throw in a freebie"}
{"text":"This is our go to for Chinese. Not really a dine in type of place but no matter. Great quality, very consistent. Love their hot and sour soup. Everyone is always very friendly when I come to get my order. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food great service and they have an awesome lunch specials for only $5.99 schweeeeet! !!!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food.  We had the delivery and tried quite a few things.  The food came quickly and was well packed. The coconut shrimp is scrumptious;lightly puff battered pink;pearly shrimp with a well balanced coconut flavored dipping sauce.  The shrimp egg foo young was superb with a flavorful Brown gravy with a hint of ginger.  The fried dumplings are also a treat as well as the boneless spare ribs.  Try the House Special Fried Rice this was also good with nice sized pieces of meat."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are on point. Lots of food for 5 bucks. Comes out hot and fast. I have only been here for lunch so not much more information. But if you call it in, your are good to go. They are the best example of Chinese fast food."}
{"text":"I'd given this place a five star originally. The food quality has changed for the worse. We ordered food, and it was generic and bland. We thought it was a fluke so we tried them again. Same thing, food was generic and processed tasting, very bland. SAD: they started off so good."}
{"text":"I've come for take out multiple times and I'm always happy!  Dinning in today I had the orange chicken lunch special which was served with fried rice and steamed broccoli and wonton soup.  The soup was hot and flavorful, the fried rice was cooked well and seasoned perfectly and the orange chicken was delicious. I also ordered the Chinese donuts which were scrumptious.  I love the atmosphere of this little restaurant.  Delicious food and great service!"}
{"text":"Friendly owners.  Good fresh food  always willing to customize your orders.  They deliver too. Come here every two weeks."}
{"text":"I have a love hate with Tsing Tao. I love that it's decent Chinese food and they deliver, my kids like it, but it's Uber bland. This was the first time we stopped at this incredibly small restaurant to take out our food. I like spicy, and when I say spicy, I like Thai spicy. I want to sweat a bit, or maybe for a second question my decision on making it spicy. As I placed my order I always over embellish my order, \"Make it SPICY SPICY SPICY SPICY PLEASE.\"  We got our food home and me and my girl could tell who's food was who's. We ordered 2 different meals, and both looked identical. On a positive note, we walked out with 2 dinner specials for 6.95, our Saturday night dinner was under $15. Take the good with the bad I guess."}
{"text":"It was okay but I did love their service. I remember asking for shrimp in one dish and chicken in the other but both dishes seem to have chicken ham and shrimp? I don't know if the order was mixed up or something but I was hungry so I ate it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for takeout Chinese food! It tastes like I remember Chinese food tasting in Chinatowns of Vancouver and San Francisco! The family that runs Tsing Tao are very friendly yet focused on get your order out correctly. They are always happy to see me but just as happy to work on the next orders. The food is delicious."}
{"text":"I don't know how they manage to take the flavor out of the food, but they do it better than any Chinese food restaurant I've ever been to. We ordered Seafood Soup, which literally tasted like chunks of imitation crab and assorted vegetables in water rather than broth. I don't even remember what I had as the entree, it was that forgettable. This place is set up for take out and they have a wide assortment of sauce packets that you pick right out of the boxes they were shipped in. I guess you're supposed to add your own flavor by grabbing handfuls of those. I suggest you use both fists. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Guy who works in front is quick with a good attitude. I came in today at a busy lunch rush. They all still kept it together while people still were coming in. Theres not many places to sit in the place either.   I ordered the lunch special orange chicken. I really liked it. Its not the greatest ive had but for the amount of food and the lunch special price it was really worth it.   I also tried the beef and broccli which was good. The potstickers were different then any I have had before  I will go in again the price is right and its close to me."}
{"text":"They don't give you a choice of 2-3 things to choose for your takeout plate and the plates are small so you get a small plate of one choice with a little rice box, but the food ain't too bad, just expected a little more"}
{"text":"Had the General Tao chicken and was pleased.  It was fin watching them whip up the dishes in the back.  Busy take out business.  Dish was fresh and hot.  Hard to get hot food in most places anymore. I will be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"My Brother swears by this place but having just moved here from Texas I was looking for a new favorite place to order from on weekends or no cook nights. We got the coconut shrimp and it was beyond sinfully devine. That sauce with it was good enough to eat on everything. Kung Pao shrimp was very good. We tried the dumplings which I have never in my entire life liked but the rave reviews convinced me to try them and I fell in love. Best flavor!  Everything was just really really good!"}
{"text":"I ordered sweet and sour chicken. It was suppose to have pineapple and some other veggies, but it didn't. It was just the chicken and sauce. My husband got Kung pao shrimp and he loved it. It was full of veggies and shrimp. His looked bountiful. I'll try it again but order something different."}
{"text":"The delivery speed is awesome , came in 30 minutes and were expecting an hour. The food is just really salty and not as crispy as I'd like, it was extremely hot though for delivery food!"}
{"text":"Everything was real good, with the exception of the steamed dumplings.., I have no idea what meat it was, I usually get pork but the website didn't give me an option to choose the meat (nor tell me what it is). I would order again but not the dumplings!"}
{"text":"LOOK OVER HERE FOLKS !  Its very simple!  Tsing tao slings chinese food at crazy affordable prices. DO NOT GO THERE TO EAT IN......TRUST ME.   Call for a delivery or pick up.    Pro's- 7.00 dinner combo's include a small eggroll and rice..killer deal They have duck sauce, plastic cutlery, soy sauce, sticks right next to the counter. Food was good Dinner combo comes in a plastic snap lid container.....no need  to transfer leftovers. They deliver.....why i dont know? Their prices are great!!   CONS....the place is small, faces west and was baking hot when we were there. All of the tables turn into a waiting area for pick up customers There really is little space to eat there. We grabbed ours to go Their fried rice is orange.....bright orange......its ok. ....but real fried rice is dark brown. Just saying....  In the end.....where the heck are you going to get 2 combo orders WITH EGGROLLS for 14.50 ? Eggrolls and fried rice are huge upcharges at most places. Last fried rice we ordered was 7.00 !!  Places like this are a N.Y. Tradition!!  :)"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. We enjoy the shrimp with snow peas-- always extra spicey. They prepare the food quickly and expertly. A real gem to have in the community!"}
{"text":"Everything was properly cooked and delicious.  The Walnut Shrimp, which I only had at Panda Express before here, gets a ten out of ten."}
{"text":"I ordered sweet and sour pork, pork fried rice, and egg rolls. My compatriot ordered Kung Pao chicken.  We just wanted some descent chinese food delivered to us.  We began with the egg rolls.  They were amazing. Not overly fried and soggy, where you can only taste the grease, like most places.  These were crisp and full of flavor.    My sweet and sour pork came delivered naked (sauce on the side).  Which was nice,  i hate it when the meat is soggy.  The rice was different than i expected.  It was light and a little less flavorful than I was hoping.  It was still good, but not compared to the amazing sweet and sour pork.  The sweet and sour sauce was thick and tangy.  Not just bland red syrup.  I put a little on the rice to liven in up a bit.  (Worked)  My compatriots only complaint with his Kung Pao Chicken was that is was not spicy enough.  I think that they could probably make it spicier next time if requested.  Amazing food, prompt delivery,  will be eating here again."}
{"text":"Damned fine. Damned fine, indeed. I'm on a mission to evaluate the various Chinese delivery joints in my area, and this is the latest in my scope. I might actually bump this spot up to 5* once I finish my mission, but until then I'm still figuring out my evaluation system.  Ordered my usual:  one eggroll, Singapire mei-fun, walnut shrimp, Kung-pao chicken, and Mongolian beef. The eggroll was very nice- oily enough to feel decadent, but not to oily as to feel gross. Plus, they threw in two extra, which was nice. I'd requested spicy mustard with my eggroll, and they threw in three packets which was really nice. I also purchased a \"side\" of spicy mustard and they gave me a small container of \"That Good Stuff\"- ie the stuff that makes the back of your throat tingle like a Christmas tree getting burned on February 2nd. It was great! The Kung-pao chicken was fine- it was pretty much what you'd expect from a joint like this- tender sliced breastmeat with babycorn, water chestnut, carrot and celery. No real spice to it, but that's pretty much to be expected, since white people have tender bootyholes and tend to complain a lot when something makes them tingle. The Mongolian beef was fine- definitely not my favorite, but not the worst I've ever had. There were no crispy seifun noodles, and there really wasn't any spice, but the flavor of the beef was fine... just fine. The walnut shrimp was tasty and I really appreciated that they served the sauce in a separate container so that the nice fried shrimp and walnuts didn't get gooey in transit. The Singapore mei-fun was actually delightful- just the right amount of spice and ingredients mixed together to give that delightful noodley mouth-feel while delivering bite after bit of meaty goodness. I think that, so far, this has been my favorite Singapore mei-fun.  All in all, this was a solid offering, and it definitely in the running for my \"go-to Chinese delivery\" joint. I love that they threw in a few free eggrolls, and overall I'm extremely pleased with the quality of the food!"}
{"text":"The prices are really good. The food is fast, and the quality isn't bad either. But the RICE.  What.. is.. this stuff? Boo. Horrible rice. Totally kills it. 4 stars otherwise.. maybe go for something noodley :)"}
{"text":"Moved to Gilbert last year and have been unable to find that WOW place for Asian food; especially that delivers.  Found this place on YELP and after wading through the mixed reviews gave it a shot.  Jen and I were very impressed, so much that SHE insisted I write a review.  The delivery was quick.  The food was piping hot.  We had egg rolls and dumplings for apps and although the egg rolls were good, and the sweet and sour sauce good as well, the dumplings were better and the sauce that accompanied was the icing on the cake.  Wonton soup was just like my favorite place back home and I loved it.  Jen said the Hot and Sour soup was just ok as we have been spoiled in the past by Zushi on Power Rd which simply has set the bar for Hot and Sour soup.  We had the chicken on a stick which was also very good and the portion left me dumbfounded as to how they made any money on it.  We ordered chicken chow mein, Mongolian beef, and I if I remember right, Happy Family.  Normally leftovers go in the trash after a couple days at our house but there was literally nothing left for Jen or I after about 12 hours.  As miserably full as I was, I felt it was my duty to finish what I could off so I had it fresh.  I'm normally not impressed with the beef dishes but, again, the sauce they used on the Mongolian was really really good, and the beef was tender and not the usual sinewy that is typical is most Asian restaurants I've tried.    Yelp reviews you have to take with a grain of salt sometimes, but if you are in the mood for Chinese and don't feel like going anywhere, you definitely need to try Tsing Tao.  And I almost forgot to mention the price; very very affordable.  You could make a meal out of appetizers for less than $10 bucks and still have leftovers for tomorrow."}
{"text":"Good food good service and made it at the exact time they said it would. And the delivery driver Derek was really nice! I recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I've always ordered delivery from here. It is a little away from my house but delivery is always on time out even earlier than quoted. The food is good. It's always hot when it arrives."}
{"text":"This place was so good. I was skeptical because I learned of this place by a flyer on my door, but the food looked amazing in the pictures so I decided to give it a try. Best choice ever! The sweet and sour Chicken was so good. White meat chicken with no gross pieces like you sometimes get. The general tso's was good too. Just the right amount of spice. We also got egg roles, vegetable lo mein and fried rice. There was so much food, we got to enjoy it again for lunch the next day!  So good!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. They don't have descriptions on their products and have unlisted ingredients. I ordered the cheese wontons, veggie spring rolls, and veggie chow mein. The cheese puffs aren't actually cheese puffs they are crab puffs. I am a vegetarian. I ordered cheese puffs, not crab puffs for this reason, so I could't eat them. Next is the veggie spring rolls, which have beef in them, again another item I couldn't eat. Lastly the chow mein, I have been eating chinese food my entire life and every time I have ever ordered chow mein it has been a stir fry noodle dish but here of course it is a little bag of fried wonton noodle things. And if all of that wasn't enough the fortune cookie tasted very strange almost like dirt. DO NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"I haven't physically been in to Tsing Tao and that's why I was only able to give them four stars, but if the location is anything like the food I've had delivered to my home over and over again, then they are 5 star all the way! I've never had a bad experience with their food. They package their deliveries neat, compact, and tidy. They deliver their Lemon Chicken already with the Lemon Sauce on the side so you don't have to specially ask, and they give you a VERY generous portion of sweet and sour sauce when ordering wontons or egg rolls. Their phone ordering is quick and they are helpful to answer questions. Even the delivery guys are polite. This is all aside from the food being fantastic, and authentic. So far from everything I've seen, Tsing Tao does it all the right way!"}
{"text":"Man.. Tsing Tao is garbage. You people are so quick to throw 4 or 5 stars around. I just bought a home in the area, and needed something quick and easy to grub on while I unpacked. Not in the mood for pizza, so I grabbed a flyer from my door and dialed Tsing Tao.  I ordered 2 types of Chow Mein, Tangerine Chicken, Rice, and Egg Rolls. My order came out to 30 bones. The delivery was on time, but whoever packed my order did not include chopsticks, forks, or napkins!! I called back, and mentioned to the owner that the reason for ordering out was because I hadn't unpacked any kitchen stuff.. and had no clue where the box with silverware was. He told me that to save money, Tsing Tao assumed that all houses had their own utensils!! What the fuck!!!? Chopsticks and napkins cost almost nothing you cheap bastard. I have never had my Chinese orders come without these simple things.  We ate our food with fucking steak knives until my chick came home from work (I asked her to grab some plastic forks on the way)  The food was downright terrible. No flavor.. All the meats were overcooked. MSG city.. Egg Rolls were raw inside. All 3 of us agreed that Tsing Tao was some of the worst Chinese we had ever experienced. I dunno if it was because I had just eaten really good Chinese the day before (Desert Jade) or what.. but fucking yuk! I will never give these cheap bastards my business again. All you fuckers on here need to explore a little bit more, because nothing that I tasted was worth 2 stars. For realz mane.. try Desert Jade, then go back and tell me Tsing Tao is worth more than 2 stars-  PS.. the fortunes in their cookies were garbage too."}
{"text":"i was a little disappointed considering the good reviews. They do deliver and they are very prompt and they did get our order completely right. The food was just not as good as i was expecting. We got some spring rolls, sesame chicken, pork fried rice and vegetable lo mien. Everything was just o.k. The fried rice was definitely my least favorite. I eat a lot of Chinese, Asian and Thai and this just did not do a thing for my taste buds.   They are fairly priced and for home delivery i cannot be that upset i just expected more.  Meh, it was edible."}
{"text":"This is our second time ordering for delivery. The food is really good and it came within the time frame."}
{"text":"Delicious. We had the hunan egg rolls, spring rolls, cream cheese wontons, egg drop soup, low mein, and the . Everything we had was good and hot. We had ours delivered by Grubb Hub. I'm embarrassed that this order was for just my husband and I... but in defense we do have leftovers..  (not a lot but they're there) The only thing I would change is that I would dine in so that the fried items would have been more crispy..."}
{"text":"I was very surprised how good the food was and how fast they delivered. I had the salt & pepper shrimp, with pork won ton and house fried rice. All were served warm and very tasty."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Found five hairs in my egg roll. Called the restaurant and the best they would do is half off my order. I guess that's fair they did give us half of their cooks beard.  Amendment we actually have now found a sixth hair in the entree. Apparently it was not just the egg rolls."}
