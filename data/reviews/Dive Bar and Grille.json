{"text":"New place dahn in the sahth sahd. 

Great been selection and excellent \"bar\" type food. 

Just opened so it doesn't seem very busy"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have always enjoyed it. The prices are great, especially for happy hour! The food is also really really good. I would definitely recommend this place to all ages also."}
{"text":"Great drinks. Great food. Great service. I've been here multiple times, each time ordering something different, and every meal was delicious. I also enjoyed their cocktail options...possibly too much lol."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour. Maybe the best deal I've found in Pittsburgh so far. Select items are HALF OFF like wings and some bomb quesadillas. Servers here were super cool and the beer list was good too with a lot of local brews. I had an order of wings which were tasty, my date had shrimp and grits, and we also split a quesadilla that had pulled pork and Mac and cheese in it. Each of us got a drink and my bill was only 24 bucks. Unheard of. Will be back very soon to try more happy hour items!"}
{"text":"Great experience and will definitely repeat. Food and service were both top notch - special thanks to Josie!

I ordered from the sides menu because I didn't want the hashbrowns and toast. Kitchen did an excellent job preparing the eggs (over hard, crispy on the edges and yolks in tact for easy removal) and the bacon was cooked to perfection. We also ordered the chicken and funnel cake. Also excellent, but I'd advise you to specify how well you want the chicken done. 

Overall one of the best breakfast experiences in the area."}
{"text":"I got the southern comfort (BBQ pork/Mac n cheese/other good stuff) I just wish there was more filling and less tortilla lol. It was tasty though. Good beer selection. Music isn't too loud, comfortable setting. I'd come back"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time last night.  Good service, great food, and a really nice atmosphere!  We'll return for sure."}
{"text":"Had the calamari and it was amazing!! Really nice place would definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Thursday with my cousin who had never been here and I think I converted him to a Fan.  

I ordered the Hangover which was Prosciutto, bacon, provolone, lettuce, tomato, pesto aioli and a fried egg on top.  It came out on toasted, thin cut bread and looked delicious.  It was a tad hard to eat as the bread didn't hold up well once the sandwich was fully assembled but the taste was delicious.  The home made potato chips were a perfect side.  

My cousin ordered the Alabama Slammer burger which had a brown sugar glaze, bacon, cheddar, provolone topped with onion straws.  He ordered the fries and a side of slaw.  Judging from the fact that he didn't say a single word till that burger was fully engulfed in his digestive cavity, I would say he loved it.  

This is my 5th or 6th visit to this location and everything we have ever ordered has been delicious.  Skip the busy section of Carson St and find this gem for Happy Hour- the specials are awesome!"}
{"text":"Giving Dive Bar & Grille (SS Location) 3 stars for now. I will definitely go back and check it out again to update my review.I know this business just recently opened, so I think with some time they will work their way up to a higher review. There was simply nothing that stood out at Dive Bar & Grille. 

We went early Saturday evening (around 4-5 PM) for apps & drinks. The atmosphere inside is really nice & clean and it looks like they did a great job at renovating from what was there before (I believe it used to be Coppertops). There is also an upstairs but we sat downstairs by the window. There was only 1 other party eating there and a handful of people sitting at the bar while we were there. It was kind of a weird time, but hopefully they get busier throughout the night!

Chris and I both ordered beers from the draft list. If you like beer, they had a lot of good options! I went with my first Summer Shandy of the year, which you can never go wrong with. Chris explained to the waiter what he was looking to drink and he helped with picking one. Their menu is huge and has something for everyone! We ended up ordering just appetizers and split them between the 2 of us. We got the hummus plate, zucchini fries, and kalua pork sliders. Everything was good but nothing amazing. I look forward to going back and trying one of their entrees, everything sounded good!"}
{"text":"Super yummy my friends and I went here a few months ago super cute and nice atmosphere !!!!lits of different options for food which is fun !!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! My boyfriend and I always love to see and try new restaurants as they come in and out of our South Side neighborhood.  It's no secret that restaurants turn over pretty frequently, especially in this mid-section of Carson St.  Dive is in the old Coppertops space but they have completely remodeled with a great new atmosphere.

The service is great and the food is even better.  We've eaten here twice now and have not been disappointed either time.  This last visit I had the Shrimp Po Boy but subbed out the shrimp for crab cakes and made it a wrap instead of sandwich - it was incredible!! They've got something good going here..

I checked out their menu from their other locations online and I cannot WAIT until they begin serving Brunch at this location; the Brunch menu items sound phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for brunch yesterday before the Steelers game and loved the place. The food and service were excellent. I had the Chicken and Funnel Cake with a Bloody Mary on side - highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The food is great and the restaurant is classy.. different than I expected. Also Dillan was our server, and he was awesome!! Super attentive and quick great service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Dive Bar was an unexpected finding for us. I ordered the Greek salad and my husband had a burger with sweet potato tots. I thought the sweet potato tots were delicious dipped into the cinnamon sugar icing. We also tried the nachos and fried pickles. Normally, I love every type of fried pickle. This time, I wasn't as impressed- the breading was delicious, but slid right off so I was eating the pickles separate from the breading. The queso sauce on the nachos was DELICIOUS. I could have eaten another serving of the nachos, rather than the pickles. I wish they would have had more vegetarian options and maybe a choice for soup. Aside from these few things, the service was wonderful, vibe was cool, and food was good. This is a great place to stop for a drink or quick lunch- I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I'm almost hesitant to leave this review, because I want to keep this Dive location all to myself... but people need to know about it! I've actually never been to the other locations, but the service, food, and atmosphere of the Southside location are spot on. 

My boyfriend lives right around the corner and this has become a go-to spot for us. The drink menu is extensive (really solid list of drafts, bottles, wines, and craft cocktails) and they have a good happy hour as well. The bartenders are always very friendly and every drink I've tried here has been delicious!

I've been in for brunch and dinner and I am honestly shocked at how huge their menu is. There is literally something for everyone. Pages and pages of apps, sandwiches, large plates, wraps, salads, bowls... you name it. Everything that we've tried has ranged to pretty good to excellent - we've never had a bad meal. We've even brought my parents here and my stepdad is quite the picky eater. He loved it!

The atmosphere is really great as well. With the place being fairly new it's never been packed anytime we've gone in. I could see it getting busier as the location becomes more popular! I am really glad that Dive has chosen to open a location in the Southside and will continue to go back."}
{"text":"This was a great find! We stopped through here for lunch one day and it was perfect! I ordered the Buffalo Mac & Cheese and it was amazing! I was with a few other people and they all enjoyed their meals as well. The service was good as well. If we are ever in the area we would probably come back. Definitely a gem!"}
{"text":"A surprising find on E Carson that I will return to again and again.  Excellent happy hour choices from food to drafts to cocktails.  Sandwiches were generous in portion size and everyone in our party agreed on freshness and taste.   Ambiance was a fresh look for south side, sound level allowed for conversation among 5 adults. Fun place!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place and found out that their Southside location just opened recently. The place is really hip and cozy and the staff is awesome! I came during happy hour and found their specials to be amazing - half off all appetizers and many drink specials as well. I ordered 4 different appetizers and every single one was delicious. I would definitely come back for happy hour and try some drinks as well!"}
{"text":"A new(er) southside spot is a nice addition. There is a great selection on the menu and the happy hour prices are amazing! There are a variety of apps on the menu, and they are half priced during their happy hour to compliment a drink of the day and reduced wine / beer prices.

The staff has been very friendly each time I've been there and very knowledgeable about the menu. I'm always happy when I ask about the beer selection and they offer a sample if it's something new - certainly helped me find a good one!

The chicken wings are pently for a full meal for me. I had the regular ones with all different sauces for dipping, because I couldn't choose just one. The spicier the better for me, so I went with the sriracha / spicy / garlic flavored ones. Delish!"}
{"text":"LET me tell you something about this place.... they have good food. 

They had half off appetizers when I  arrived so I decided to take advantage of them.... I MEAN their special.....  and order 3 items. They were all DELICIOUS. This was some of the best made food I've had yet. Everything was spot on.

I had the ahi tuna, best I've had yet.
I had the Grilled Bella mushrooms on garlic bread... delicious 
I had the pretzel sticks with cinnamon butter. Yummy.

Definitely want to come back for dinner and their weekend brunch. A must try."}
{"text":"Very yummy food and great craft beer and cocktail options! I brunched here for the first time yesterday and they did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"This spot has great specials a great happy hour and great service. 3 musts means you should experience dive yourself."}
{"text":"Just went here for the Father's Day brunch and it was delicious. Everyone got something different and everything looked great and everyone was happy! I got the farmers market omelette and it was so yummy! The veggies were all really fresh and it was stuffed with them! No skimping here! My boyfriend got the chorizo and hash bowl which was very large and looked great. The breakfast burritos and breakfast burgers my boyfriend dad and sisters got also looked yummy. The waitress was really friendly and attentive and brought us over a complimentary funnel cake for Father's Day! She gave us the options of chocolate chips, bananas, or berries. It was huge, enough for all of us to share! Will definitely be back to try more menu items at some point!"}
{"text":"You had me at \"Saturday Brunch\"

I had full intentions on getting tacos down the road, but the only thing better than tacos is brunch. Dive has a Saturday brunch til 3. I peaked at the menu on the window and decided to head on in.

I ordered a bloody Mary. It was a homemade mix. It was delicious. A little too peppery for me but overall not bad.

I waa stuck between western burrito (peppers onion eggs hashbrowns) or a breakfast cheese steak (shaved steak onions eggs peppers) i went with burrito and decided on French fries since burrito already has hash browns in it. Sadly I got hash browns instead of fries on the side but o well.

Overall great menu and cool vibe. Sat & Sunday happy hour 9-11. Kitchen open til midnight daily. Kids brunch menu (including deep fried pb&j)"}
{"text":"Half off entire menu Sundays, 8 till midnight, need I say more? Cool space, really clean and the food was very good. We ordered Rueben rolls, an all American burger and fancy turkey sandwich and enjoyed everything along with a few beers. Service was good even though our server was really busy. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This has quickly become one of my favorite happy hour spots!!! 1/2 price appetizers and discounts on all specialty drinks!!! And there is A LOT to chose from. If you happen to miss happy hour, no worries, there is always a daily special!! I have been to both locations and they are consistent between both! I would recommend the Camburger! It's quite messy but so good and different!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game. Wonderful local atmosphere. Steeler Nation is in full effect."}
{"text":"A really welcome addition to the neighborhood. My girlfriend and I have been here 10+ times since they have opened. We usually like to mix it up, but this place continues to impress. 

Restaurants that have very diverse menus often fail becuase it is difficult to produce quality and quantity. Dive certainly bucks this trend. Almost everything on the menu is excellent. The only bad expierience I had was the wings (little soggy), but I am going to give them another chance. Everything else has been consistently great. 

The drink selection here is optimal- plenty of draft options, and a large cocktail menu. Something for everyone. The ambiance is nice too- defintley something southside has been lacking.

Last but certainly not least- their happy hour specials are outrageous here. So worth it. Check this place out if you haven't yet, you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing and the prices were very fair. We came for brunch because they were open from 10am-3pm and we had a late start to our day. We went to the one in Southside, but there is a Lawrenceville and Wexford location as well. We ordered the donut holes as an appetizer, and it was only five dollars for probably 15 or 20 donut holes and 3 different sauces to choose from (cinnamon butter, chocolate, and strawberry sauce). I think we paid an extra 50¢ to try all three. The donut holes were warm and delicious. Then I had the morning cheesesteak made with a wrap instead of on bread. It was delicious, but there were too many fatty, chewy pieces of meat. However, it was still really good. It came with a choice of hash browns, fresh cut fries, or sweet potato tots. I chose sweet potato tots with no regret, but I do wish they were crunchy on the outside. The service was a bit slow even though it wasn't busy, but our waitress was kind. Overall, I had a great experience!"}
{"text":"The environment was very welcoming and there was good music throughout our visit. We ordered the potato croquets as an appetizer and they were delicious. They were the best part of the meal. It took the staff 10 minutes to greet us at our table and deliver the food menu even though it wasn't crowded at the time. I ordered the Caesar wrap and my friend ordered the Camburger. Unfortunately, the waitress brought me out the wrong entrée and a side dish that did not order. I ended up returning the side dish and the entire. The kitchen staff proceeded to make me a Caesar wrap like I ordered. In the end, I was still charged accidentally for the side dish that I didn't order but that was corrected on my bill. The restaurant was a bit colder which made it a bit uncomfortable. Also, my friend was not given the correct change for her bill. Overall, the food is fine and the service was below average."}
{"text":"Great happy hour 5 to 7. Good list of brews and unique food. Good serve on top of that."}
{"text":"I have now been here twice. One for lunch/regular menu - so many food options! and once for brunch - so many food options! 

Both times my service and food were exceptional. Will definitely be returning to test out the happy hour waters. :)"}
{"text":"Definitely worth a stop by if you are in Pittsburgh. The burger was pretty good and while they don't have a large beer selection it's good for its size."}
{"text":"Parking can be found on the street or in lots. I think the meters run til 6pm.

We went for happy hour and it was delicious. I got the dirty martinis which were $2 off and they were so delightfully dirty and delicious. They came with bleu cheese stuffed olives.

We split some apps since all of the Small Bites section was half off. Everything came out fairly quickly considering it was happy hour and getting busy.

The Southern Comfort quesadilla was so good! It was filled with smoked Gouda, house mac n cheese and pulled pork. The fried crimini mushrooms came out in a giant basket filled to the brim. They were lightly coated in flour and fried. The side of horseradish sauce for dipping was key. The fried pickles were giant pickle spears again lightly floured and fried and paired with their homemade ranch.

Can't wait to go back and try some more of the amazing sounding food!"}
{"text":"I went here again yesterday with my friend and got the camburger it was so good! I also got the pineapple beer that's brewed by river town I believe. The service was great once again but unfortunately I forgot my leftovers. I definitely want to come back and try other things on their menu since they have such diverse choices hopefully I won't forget my left overs next time!"}
{"text":"Nice relaxing place.  Friendly staff.  My Greek salad was very fresh.  The daily special was half off sandwiches, I did not get one, they looked really good on other people's plates."}
{"text":"Came in for an after dinner drink following mallorca just up the street. The old coppertops had 2 other patrons in the whole establishment, which the bartender said had now been dive bar for 6 months.. it wasn't hard to see why by the attitude and demeanor of the staff. The male bartender had a great personality and even agreed the other two employees were \"admittedly having rough days\".. the tall blondes awful attitude only paled in comparison to the glasses wearing brunette that flaunted her misery. When you work in the highest concentration of bars per
 capita in the entire US, you have to stand out somehow. If it isn't by concept, it better be by service. Unfortunately this will be our last stop in."}
{"text":"Love love love Dive Bar! I've been here plenty of times and I love their food! They have a great menu with many options. I'm so glad they came to South Side! This is one of the better restaurants to eat at in the area. Great portions and reasonable prices. I love their menu because it's not traditional bar food. The ahi tuna wrap is amazing, one of my favs. I also love the chopped chicken salad, it's my go to. The buffalo egg rolls...I mean how can one not love creamy buffalo chicken fried in a crispy wrap! I've also been for brunch and love the build your own bowls. My boyfriend says their burgers are great. I've had private parties upstairs for work and they always do a fantastic job with the catering. The service is always good too. I've honestly never had a bad experience here. They have great happy hour specials and also daily specials. The $5 tacos on Thursdays are delicious and filling. Sunday's is their best special yet...from 8-11 the whole menu is half off!! You can't go wrong with Dive Bar! This place is doing everything right."}
{"text":"came in here by chance because I wanted to hit the Thai restaurant down the street but it was closed. 

What a stroke of luck because this place was great! I had the pretzel bread sticks with beer cheese as an appetizer. The pretzels were soft, warm, salty and the beer cheese was amazing. 

I also had the thai beef salad and it had great flavor. 

They had a great selection of local beers which I am always on the hunt for as an out of towner. 

If I am in the area again, I will be back."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh on business. Wanted something different & delicious. The menu had a wide variety to satisfy me with diet restrictions & my associate who did not. I had the ahi which I ordered rare. It was fabulous! Best i've ever had hands down. My associate's burger looked awesome.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great bar, food really good. Just a nice place to sit and enjoy the beers,food and service. Classy exception to the fly by night bars on the Southside!!!'"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and an unfriendly bartender that doesnt get what a return customer is..a real yinzer meathead"}
{"text":"Cheap prices, great food. Win win. Decent size portions and friendly staff. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a must go on Tuesdays in particular. Half price sandwiches and $5 margs. I got the Turkey Gouda Melt sandwich as a wrap. I'm telling you this wrap with a margarita is the best combo. Great service, great draft list, great atmosphere, great food, all at an amazing price! Can't get enough of this place. See you there next Tuesday"}
