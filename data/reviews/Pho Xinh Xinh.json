{"text":"I work near here, and the pho is plentiful and fits the bill. A no nonsense, good place for reasonably priced Vietnamese. The lunch special is also a great deal, and the staff are attentive and friendly. Good spot if you can grab a booth to have a quick meeting as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Vietnamese places! Good mix of menu choices and the family run restaurant is always friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"The food here is acceptable as it tastes good, but the portions are small for the price."}
{"text":"Awful. Avoid this restaurant. The phone was tasteless and they ran out of bean sprouts!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! I ate there monday night and got the worst food poisoning of my life! Granted, I ordered the chicken curry, which is probably not a popular menu item, but there is no excuse! I was wrapped around the toilet for the next 15 hours and thought I was going to have to go to the hospital for dehydration. Its been two days and I still can't eat solid foods. Avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"The servers are always nice, fresh food (no old bean sprouts, my pet peeve from not so good places), they DO answer their phone, run by mostly ladies - a regular spot for me! Great spring rolls"}
{"text":"I really like the food here but they never pick up the phone for take out orders, I've called multiple times a day on multiple occasions and still to no avail. I work a couple blocks away and I don't have time on my lunch break to go in order and wait. I have no issue paying the additional charge for take out orders but you guys really need to pick up your phones!"}
{"text":"I love the Bun bo Hue (Spicy Hue atyle beef noodle soup) the portion was great! The food came out fast and clean! 
They have so much on the menu, I also love their house special! With rice wraps, vermicelli, different types of herbs, and many types of charbroiled meat! 

The service here is fast, nice, clean, and wonderful food!!!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal here tonight after feeling like some fabulous Vietnamese! 

Ordered 1/2 order of fried spring rolls and a vermicelli #25. Also ordered a jackfruit shake by my server asked if I'd like to try an avocado shake! Wow, never tried avocado! The food came out quickly and was fresh, plentiful and downright delish! The avocado shake was awesome! Very reasonably priced and awesome Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Was recommended by a couple of people to try here.
The place is clean.
Service is good.
Food is clean (what do I mean? well, the carrots, cucumbers, bean spouts, mint leaves, lime  were all fresh and clean with no brown areas or spots!)
The dry vermicelli noodle portion was a bit on the smaller side.
The Satay beef pho was yummy.

Tucked away across from Holiday Inn, If you're coming off of Macleod trail be sure to turn on your first right otherwise you will by pass the building!!!

From Macleod it's before the train tracks, from Blackfoot it's after the train tracks."}
