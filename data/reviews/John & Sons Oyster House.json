{"text":"Great Oyster House and a much improved menu over the last few years. Always a nice selection of beers and wine.  Great staff and a really nice bar setting.  If I had to say anything negative its a bit expensive but on the other hand, you pay for quality."}
{"text":"The two of us ate an early dinner here in March. It was one of the tastiest meals we've had in a long, long while.   The service pretty attentive, though not perfect. (She forgot the soup I'd ordered. That would have been a fairly major mess-up, had I not been so pleased with everything else...!)  The oyster selection and quality was great. But it was the mains that really had us over the moon - the scallops for me and the daily special (snapper) for her. The seafood was great - very fresh. And everything else in the plates was delicious too - curried cauliflower purée, bacon jam, Brussels sprout leaves with chestnuts, etc.   A few good glasses of wine and fresh donuts for dessert.   Excellent. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The spirit of maritime life is brought to Toronto through the decor and design of the restaurant. Wood or boards or vinyl were the main material used to give a homey simple sensation. Meanwhile, a lot of lighthouse figurines and buoys or boat equipment were used as decor, possibly to recognize the life of a fisherman. I liked how the restaurant appeared down to earth.  Ceviche ($16) was made with market fish and seasoned with thai spices.  The fish was poached, preserving the natural moisture and texture of the fish.  TINY PORTIONS!  Felt like there was only 1 tablespoon of fish. Also, there was not much surprise to the appetizer. Flavour was bland and i think the lettuce washed out some of the spices too. The only thing I enjoyed was the thinly sliced lotus root chips.  Trio of Tuna Tartare ($18) Jalapeño and ginger (bottom), shitake mushroom (middle) and spicy red chili (top), all paired with a miso vinaigrette. The spicy red chili tasted somewhat like salsa, a sweet and tangy flavour. The shitake mushroom was starting to taste a little bit more saltier. While, jalapeno and ginger was spicy, it was our favourite of the three choices because it was a good mixture of the past two. This appetizer had a lot of depth, in terms of flavour and different levels of enjoyment to it. My complaint is there is really too little tuna that I can justify the mixture of sauces with it or how the sauces can compliment the tuna.  Raw Oysters ($2 - $4 each, depends on harvest location), plate of 12, 6 different types of oysters.  These oysters were amazingly fresh. I would love to have more! It is amusing how different regions or locations produce different flavours, sizes and appearance of oysters. The ocean water allowed the oysters to have a natural salty taste. Different environments allowed some oysters to have more meat and larger size, along with a sweet and creamy taste to it.  Yellow Thai Curry Mussels ($16) steamed in a Thai curry and topped with onion frites.  This is by far my favourite dish of the evening.  Not only was there a lot of mussels served, it was extremely fresh. The mussels were juicy and with the Thai curry sauce, it brought out the fresh sweet taste of the mussels. They were simmered to perfect texture.  We do not have to go to the Maritimes or the West coast to have fresh oysters or seafood. It can be experienced in Toronto too! Ofcourse, the selection is not as wide in Central Canada, but it definately was worthit."}
{"text":"Great little find downtown. Came in for lunch. Oysters were on the money. Great presentation w fresh horseradish and nice champagne shallot mignonette - one was a but funky as oysters will be sometimes and the server happily gave me another without me asking. Had the black cod which was nicely presented and tasty. Hip atmosphere and good service. Recommended."}
{"text":"I went for lunch here with a few colleagues for my birthday and it was delicious!  We shared a spectrum of  oysters to start.  They came with all the fixings. I particularly liked the cilantro glaze. We had a great bottle of Grayson Cellars Chardonnay, and there is something just delightful about oysters and white wine that can't be topped. I ordered the Tuna BLT for my main.  It is a seared yellow fin, maple-miso glazed pancetta, panko fried tomato, with wasabi creme fresh.  My friends had the scallops in the butternut squash risotto, and they thought it was fantastic.  The waitress brought me a chocolate brownie and ice-cream, which was on the house, to celebrate my birthday.  I was overjoyed and stuffed by the time the meal was over. Overall a great experience.  It is a bit loud in there, so it would be tough to have a business lunch with more than two people there."}
{"text":"Went here on a random friday night. Overall experience was good. Our server was great even though the hostess was not. Prices does tend to run a bit high compared to other \"Oyster Bars\" in the city but their variety and freshness is solid.   The notables of the night - Fish and Chips, probably one of the better ones of the city on par with the legendary Old Yorke Fish and Chips. Steak Frites, I would not recommend this. The steak was quite small at probably around 4-5oz and it was a bit tough. The compound butter on top added nothing and had an odd mix of spice in it. The chipotle aioli for the fries was too strong. I guess this is why you dont order steak at a seafood place. Crab Poppers, basically this was a jalapeno pepper stuffed to the max with crab meat. The crust on this was very hard which i actually prefer over the usual soggy pepper.    We also had oysters(very fresh!) and drinks but they were your usual fare. One of the selections of the night for oysters was called \"Four Inches of Pleasures\". So obviously the waiter and us made quite a few jokes throughout regarding it.   Next time I think I would just stop by next door at their fish/chips location for a bite and come here for a drink and oysters."}
{"text":"We had an amazing time at the restaurant. Its tucked away quietly in the middle of downtown. Food and service were both excellent. Tried their lobster poutine!! Very nice and a tad heavy though, but thats poutine. I had lamb sliders and they were amazing!! Definitely a must try. Seafood tagine was good too. For drinks, i had a Toronto, not the best drink i've ever gad but still pretty good. Will go again!'"}
{"text":"the noise,  the noise,  the noise ! i'm not an old person, ( well maybe at 61) but noise usually doesn't bother me .    i couldn't hear or talk on a thurs . night at 7 pm. i live  down the street so please fix that and i will come back for brunch ."}
{"text":"I didn't have oysters, but the beet salad and fish and chips were excellent. Disappointed that they did not have any non-alcohol beer (like so many Canadian restaurants) so I had tap water."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the night of April 7th, and the place was relatively empty - though likely mostly due to the rain.  The service was fine, though it could have been better attended to, due to the fact that there were so few patrons at the location.  The oyster menu was confusing, as they provided a list, but then proceeded to indicate that the oysters available for the day were not actually on the list.   The food was very good. I had an excellent portion size of fish and chips, and we also had a Lobster Poutine, which was rich a creamy, and definitely met the standards of this East Coaster.   Not sure if I will be back often, but I was happy to have tried it and would recommend to others, though maybe aim for an afternoon meal on the weekend instead."}
{"text":"Fantastic menu - Highly recommend the BLT! The space itself offers a warm, intimate setting. A hidden gem along the Bay Street corridor."}
{"text":"Went during summerlicious. Even though their summerlicious menu was online, when we showed up we were presented with a shorter version of the online menu, and when we asked was told my the server \"we don't do summerlicious, this is our prefixe menu\". The first course was fine, I had steak for second course, and I ordered my steak medium, because the seafood stew that I had originally wanted from the online menu is not there. when it came it was unevenly cooked, the end pieces were cooked completely through, only the centre piece was a little pink, and tasted dry. I notified the server, who was extremely condescending and told me that \"really? You think it's over cooked? Medium is supposed to be a tinge of pink\", and very reluctantly took it back. It took another 15-20 min before they recooked it to a medium rare consistency, rather than medium. Overall would not recommend, and would not go back."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, atmosphere was really good too. Was really busy, I had the scallops on risotto with a chowder to start. Also shared a dozen oysters  - they were awesome. Would definitely go back and have more!"}
{"text":"Very good oyster house; always fresh.  Other seafood items on the menu are also usually excellent.  Rotating specials.  Very intimate, small, comfortable place; never seems to get too noisy.  Adequate wine list and a few microbrews on tap.  Decent, friendly service."}
{"text":"I was very excited that this restaurant was on the summerlicious roster and it didn't disappoint. I loved the atmosphere, the service was friendly and great, the food was really good. I had the oysters as the appetizer...you're crazy not to at an oyster place and they didn't disappoint. I'm in love with the fix'ins that they bring, primarily the scotch bonnet sauce. My friend had the fish and chips which looked yummy and I had the seafood stew. The stew was excellent though not very filling. My friend had the brownie for dessert and I had the lemon and blueberry dessert. Both were great.  I'm definitely coming back for their oyster happy hour after summerlicious is over and I can't wait to try their downtown location. I see this as the start of a beautiful friendship :)"}
{"text":"Good crowd and very cozy atmosphere... definitely a great place for a date. Food relative to pricing, however, was only so-so. We had oysters which were yummy, but the other dishes were a bit on the oily side, and nothing spectacular... OK place to try"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the oysters are great. However, I was quite disappointed by my experience. I have celiac meaning I cannot under any circumstances eat gluten. It's not a dietary choice, it's an autoimmune disease and my intestinal lining is destroyed when I eat gluten. I don't go out to eat often but when I do I never never ever go to a restaurant without calling and checking that they are able to accommodate me... upon calling in the afternoon yesterday I was told by a very friendly lady who answered the phone that they can absolutely accommodate me and that there were several dishes on the menu that were gluten-free or could be made as such... she even put me on hold to go and check with the kitchen. Well too bad she wasn't working last night....I made a reservation and when I got there the waitress had no idea what gluten even was --she was trying to be helpful but really wasn't. There was a guy working at the bar and I could see her continuing to go over to him to try to get my questions about the different dishes answered and he kind of barked at her \"we can't guarantee anything we are a small kitchen\". Well, this is a completely different answer than what I got when I called to see if they could accommodate me ...I was quite nervous about eating there after hearing the exchange between the staff. They were quite unapologetic. I never want to feel like I am inconveniencing a place and that is why I always go out of my way to double check before going... nothing bothers me more than when I do the legwork and the restaurant isn't ready for me and hasn't communicated my dietary needs to the staff working. All and all, pretty unimpressed...I would NEVER eat there again given the limited knowledge on the part of the staff regarding dietary restrictions and I probably won't return for drinks / oysters ...  Ps they brought my ceviche out with crackers on the plate...REALLY?!?!?? Who in the restaurant industry doesn't know what gluten is in 2015"}
{"text":"Thought the oysters were delicious. Had 2 dozen and then had to order another 12 of our favourites. I then had the lobster poutine and it was a little over the top for my taste. Not much lobster and in the end the cheese and gravy made it taste pretty much like regular (but very good) poutine. We also tried the Kale Salad and it was amazing! I am not a big fan of kale but with this salad you sort of forgot you were eating something very healthy.  Last up were the mussels in white wine sauce and my other 2 eating companions said they were very good (I had too much going on to try them)"}
{"text":"Small oyster bar with a good variety of food options. Eaten here a couple times, and the food has been good (fish and chips, fish special). The fried oysters were bad, I'd stay away. Cozy atmosphere tucked away on this side street. Feels a little pricey, but par for the area."}
{"text":"oysters were good! but other food werent impressed at all, and pricy. Won't come again!!"}
{"text":"This was the first time visiting an oyster bar; extremely fun. You have to pay a premium for the experience, bit in my opinion it was well worth it.  We started off with an assortment of oysters followed by a lobster roll. It was very interesting that there could be so much flavour difference between oysters from different locations. We had the opportunity to try oysters from Maine, PEI (2 locations), and Washington State. Our favorite were the ones from Washington. A little bit of horse reddish and one of their sauces topped it off.  As far as the lobster roll; we found that the bread tasted like it was burnt, or they used old oil to toast it. The lobster that was on top was very tasty; though it is deceptive as to how much there is...They put a large lettuce leaf between the bun and the lobster giving the appearance of a heaping amount of meat; however, if you remove the leaf, there is barely enough to fill the bun.  With all that said. The oyster experience was awesome, and I would not hesitate to go back when I visit Toronto again.  Five stars for the experience and the oysters."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this new restaurant and left extremely disappointed.  We were not provided with bread or water (other tables were), the server was not attentive or capable, the portions were tiny, the bill was $200 and I left hungry.  On top of all of that the restaurant was uncomfortably hot and we were jammed so close to the table next to us, I felt obliged to offer them an oyster.  I live in the neighbourhood, love oysters and will NOT return."}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious and ordered the calamari, fish and chips and ice cream. Also ordered some kushi oysters. All very good! The oysters were fresh and sweet. The grilled calamari was cooked perfectly and so tender. The fish and chips were also very good, one of the best I've had. The only complaint i had was the food took way too long. We waited 30 mins just for the calamari then 10 more mins for the fish and chips. I will definitely be back although i'd make sure i have extra time to spare."}
{"text":"This was my third time going for lunch at the downtown location of John & Sons in the past month or so, so I obviously like the place!  The oysters are fresh and there is a good selection on a daily basis, and the varieties have changed for each of my visits, except for a couple of staples. Today however was a bit of a let down. The supplier ran into delivery issues and the usual variety was not  available for the lunch rush. The Kusshi and Kumamoto's that were available were good.  I started with the clam chowder because it was very cold and windy today. It had a healthy serving of clams in it and was not overly salty.  My buddy and I shared a few appetizers, including the grilled shrimp, the crab cake and the grilled octopus. Each dish was well put together and were flavourful, however for the price I found the portions to be small.  The staff were very friendly ."}
{"text":"They seem to have better looking items in their website.  The tacos on the website came with salsa and lime.  If you look at the pictures I posted, we never received any.  For $21 and lots of taco competition at much lower price points, I would definitely not order this again.  My main dish was a tuna blt at $29, the flavours were excellent!  Definitely small portioned item.  I loved the tuna and fried tomato.  Service was 2/5.  Had to chase for the bill at their counter."}
{"text":"Excellent seafood - their lobster roll and fish & chips are very good and I highly recommend them both!  Though the service was a bit slow during the weekday lunch and we had to wait quite a long time to get our bill."}
{"text":"My friend and I went for dinner one night mainly because we were in the area and craving some oysters. The oysters were beautifully shucked and the sauces (homemade) were excellent. We particularly enjoyed the secret recipe hot sauce - it had a tint of sweetness... Maybe pear? in it.  We ordered the banh-mi chicken and lobster poutine to share for our mains. The banh-mi chicken was amazing. My friend and I fought for the last piece (we really did haha). However, the lobster poutine was not as great... The sauce that they used was not enjoyable at all... The both of us could not eat it so we ended up picking at the lobster and leaving the rest untouched... I definitely don't recommend getting the lobster poutine.   We were still hungry so for dessert, we ordered the donuts which were okay but a little on the doughy side. We both agreed that we've had better donuts for dessert.  Overall, we enjoyed the service and atmosphere - the restaurant has an east coast feel to it with lots of wood. The food was okay nothing crazy spectacular."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a drink before our dinner at Richmond Station. We were kind of regretting going there just for a drink, all the food looked great. The cocktails were decent (their Old Fashioned was great!), but the ambiance was A+. It was the type of place that you typically go to at Dundas and Ossington, but in the middle of the Financial District. We need more safe havens in the city core like John & Sons. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had to sit on this review for awhile before actually posting it here.  And by \"awhile\", I mean at least 6 months. Why the hesitation, you may ask?   Well, it's not the food.  My go-to are the crispy, fried smelts with addictive curry salts and the blistered shishito peppers which are like a game of a spice-level Russian roulette.  The rest of the cooked items were alright, though the star, of course, is the oyster.   With at least 8 or so different varieties available on ice at any given time; each oyster is pristinely shucked or promptly chucked if it doesn't pass the freshness sniff test.  The housemade sauces like cocktail, mignonette, hot pepper, or champagne shallot mignonette are thankfully on the house with your oyster platter.  Might sound like an odd thing to comment on, but apparently sauces are not necessarily served without an extra cost at some other oyster places in the city.  Met the namesake John once - such a nice guy and made me feel welcome as a lone diner (I have friends! I swear!).  I think it basically boils down to the fact that I'm not the target clientele.  Attentive service seems to focus on a certain type of crowd.  I guess it's just not quite the kind of place for me."}
{"text":"Food: We ordered a dozen Thatch Island Oysters, Shrimp Cocktail, and a Lobster Poutine. It definitely took a long while for the food to come even though it was not that busy. The oysters were delicious and tasted fresh. They have a variety of sauces that range from minimal to very hot. The shrimp cocktail came with 6 shrimps and to be honest, I could have made more with the price I paid. And the Lobster Poutine was good and very cheesy.   Service: When walking on, even though we had made reservations and firmed it too, they originally had us sitting at the bar area. Luckily, a party did not show up so a table was available even though there were at least 4 tables available. Our waitress who was also the host, took a while to get to us each gap we had between getting us water, getting the order, needing more time for the order, and then finally, the food and check. Wasn't the biggest fan of the wait and the lack of description of the foods."}
{"text":"John needs to have more of his sons working for him on a Saturday night, because they certainly seemed understaffed. Service was slow & disorganized from the get go and that theme continued throughout the meal. No complaints about the food though, which was very good - particularly the Lobster Poutine as other's have said as well."}
{"text":"Great spot mid town for oysters and all things seafood related. The staff is friendly and awesome and great at hospitality. Great selection of local oysters and tasty desserts too which catch you by surprise.   My only wish would be that they had some more local wine to match the local oysters. Other than that I'm a big fan and love meeting people here in this weird midtown zone where there aren't many good restaurants. This is definitely one of them though!"}
{"text":"To begin, most of the menu items they have on this year's Winterlicious is on the regular menu. It's just that the portions are smaller.   I had the chowder, mussels and doughnuts for this year's Winterlicious (lunch). The chowder was just a little thin/runny. I asked the server and he told us that each batch is different and that's likely the reason. The mussels were cooked well (nearly all mussels were plump). I wish we didn't eat all the bread at the beginning! The broth was asking for some bread!   The highlights of the meal were surprisingly the desserts. The maple butter glaze on the doughnuts definitely stood out for me. The pecans gave it some crunch. My friend's ice cream parfait was very unique. Citrus olive oil ice cream -- wow! Give me a tub of that!"}
{"text":"Mmmm came here for appetizers with my company on a Thursday night. Given its fairly steep price point, I would be unlikely to come to this place and order alone. However, since we were a fairly large group, we were able to order a bunch of different small plates to share!  I had to leave early, so there was only a limited amount that I was able to sample. I tried the following:  Grilled Octopus Salad: This perfectly charred octopus came beautifully presented on a bed of kale, with some sort of tangy red dressing and chickpeas. The combination worked very well! The kale was very flavourful, albeit difficult to eat due to its larger size. My main complaint is that the octopus was a very small portion for its price point of $19.  Soft Shell Crab: This was their special of the night, where an entire fried soft shell crab came on some lettuce. To be honest, the soft shell crab wasn't the most amazing that I've had, but it was quite flavourful and delicious. I would have preferred it crispier; the skin was a little too soft, limp, and wet.   We also ordered other dishes such as the fried smelts, shrimp sliders, and KFC ssam, but alas... I had to leave before I could taste it all!  I'd give this place a slightly higher rating, but I did find the service to be lacking. They're not great for large groups, as it took the server a long while to take care of us. For instance, it took them quite a long time to get an extra set of utensils, place our drink orders, etc. Come here if you're a smaller group, as the setting is quite intimate!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now.  The service at the tables is a bit inconsistent (inexperienced?) but the shucking staff at the bar is great; very friendly and knowledgeable.  Liked the oysters on the half shell, the fish & chips and the chowder is really good too.  I thought the lobster cake was dry and tasteless, and the lobster poutine was just ok -- I expected more.  Wine pours are also very stingy.  Overall though, I the place is ok, and I hope they can work out some of the service/staff issues.  The place is new so you have to expect a few glitches."}
{"text":"My expectations going in were tempered because I know its hard to find great seafood in the city but my experience here was still a let down.  The menu is NOT a real seafood menu as there were hardly any fresh fish options!  Anyone with experience dining at real seafood restaurants will need to adjust their expectations.  In terms of fresh fish, I could only find one item on the menu so I ordered it.   It was a cod which turned out to be a mediocre dish that didn't even fill me up...especially for nearly $30.  I've also tried the scallops and I found them to be just ok as well.  The oysters were a bit pricey and the same as anywhere else in the city.  I've also tried the Fish n Chips for lunch and this was actually pretty good compared to my experience with the dinner options but it's less challenging to screw up something fried.    I do like the decor of the restaurant but I've been disappointed with the menu options and food quality a couple of times now so I can't really recommend this place.  I'd give it 3 stars but have to give it 2 based on the prices they charge.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"Liked the atmosphere, layout, etc and would have given a glowing review but within 2 hours my husband and I got food poisoning from the oysters Rockefeller. Which is really disappointing since I'm crazy for oysters and it was close to home. Can't say we will risk another visit."}
{"text":"My roommate and I were pleased to have an oyster place just down the street. We headed to John & Sons on Friday night for our first visit. To start we had a dozen raspberry point oysters, which were delicious, but expensive at almost $3.00 a piece.   My roommate had the lobster poutine, which I think she enjoyed (how could lobster poutine be anything less than delicious!)  but couldn't help but have the 'do I need to be eating this' feeling.   I had the cioppino, which was really delicious. A bit heavy on the fennel but otherwise I have no complaints. The saffron rouille was garlicky and fragrant, the perfect touch. The cioppino stayed hot until I was finished which was nice.  I also had a lovely wedge salad with a fantastic dressing (again rather garlicky).   All in all the meal was very nice but a bit on the expensive side. Worth going to for some oysters and a cocktail but if you're going for a full dinner be prepared to shell out some dough."}
{"text":"I've been here before when it was Rodney's and I recently came here for an early supper with some colleagues but found that I wasn't as impressed with the food this time around.   The place always seems to have a friendly, unpretentious vibe and the service was great. The wait staff were very friendly, always checking to make sure we were happy with the food, to see if we were good for drinks, explaining our dishes and all the different accoutrements.  We ordered a bit of everything so I'll keep the food portion of this review short and to the point:  1. Lobster Roll (Hand pulled warm lobster, lobster bisque,tatsoi green) - Small, but chunky lobster meat seemed to have gotten muddied by the lobster bisque which I found to be rather bland and you couldn't really taste the lobster. 2/5  2. Lobster Poutine (Claw and tail meat, lobster bechamel, Yukon gold frites, Bromont white cheddar cheese curd). - The little lobster meat was cut very small and there was a scare amount, the bechamel had no depth of flavor (couldn't even tell it was made from lobster stock), the cheese curds were unproportionally added to the amount fries, and the fries themselves were rather oily. 2/5.  3. Calamari (Grilled calamari, montanini olives, tomato and garlic cont, rapini) - cooked and seasoned really well, and very tender. 4/5  4. Black Bass Ceviche - fish was very fresh but lacked brightness, and acidity. 3/5  5. Oysters Rockefeller - I think I'm going to skip eating baked oysters from now on. Maybe it's just me but I find that baking them changes the texture and flavor in a bad way. 3/5  6. Half shell Oysters (Low tide local, acadian gold, green cable, glacier bay, pemiquid, kumomoto, wellfleet) - The oysters were fantastic, fresh, served at a good temperature, and highlighted nicely by the condiments. 5/5  Overall, food wasn't spectacular for the price and I don't think I would order any of their hot food if I were to revisit."}
{"text":"Went there for 2015 summerlicious dinner ($35 meal)  Location/environment: Midtown area - a little difficult to find parking (so do please carpool).  The restaurant has 2 entrance cause they took over two units.  Very relaxing modern interior.  There were a lot of people coming in for summerlicious (do book in advance) - but they require the entire party to show up first before getting a table (a little frustrating, especially when you might be late due to traffic/parking)  Service: Waitress was very nice and also friendly staff.  Since it was for summerlicious, they weren't willing to add a little flexibility in the menu.  One of my friend wanted to switch fries for a salad, but they couldn't let her.  Food: Appetizers were oysters (3 in total), which was based on what's available for the day.  I had kusshi, which was never a disappointment - very fresh and they provided a wide selection of sauces to fit each person's needs. Main dish was fish and chips.  The batter was well made and not too oily. The meat inside was also soft - particularly not dry (cause I hate it being dry).  I really liked their fries and the tartar sauce. Dessert was a lemon semi-fredo.  It was very sour - good for cleaning down the fatty food I had.  Also it had a blueberry sauce and poppy seeds, which can divert the sourness away.  Overall not bad for a first try, would consider coming again to try more of their oysters and other dishes."}
{"text":"I gave this place 5/5 because I want to be consistent with my other Yelp ratings. This is relative to other places I've rated. If i were to be hard on every restaurant, most places would get twos and threes. That aside, this was an amazing restaurant.   I thought everything was delicious... the seafood was tender yet flavourful. To be honest, this is as good as it gets with restaurants. Personally, I like to cook my own food but this is one of the best places I've eaten at. Even though I have a heavier tastebud (I like spicy food), their food did not lack any flavour and it had great great texture. Service was good and the inside looked great. We came here because of the Summerlicious event and we chose this place among the other places.   I will describe the dishes in detail. Note: I ate mostly my food but I tried a little bit of my friends' food so I'll only describe what i ate in detail  Three Shucker's Choice Oysters- raw oysters served with lemon and radish/diakon shreds. The oysters were placed on top of a plate of ice so it is kept cold. The oysters felt fresh and soft. According to a guy, it is locally caught or something... I am not a huge fan of oysters but this was more than tolerable for me. The texture was good but there is still that unpleasant fishy taste. I squeezed a lot of lemon juice to offset this natural oyster taste. The waitress also gave us some tabasco sauce and other stuff... they were all bottled sauces you can find at the grocery store that i didn't use. I'm not a fan of tabasco....  Grilled Ocean-Wise Atlantic Salmon - The salmon strip had no bones in it (so it was a plus) but a crispy layer of skin that was perfectly grilled. The inside of the salmon was very soft and velvety and it melted in my mouth. Near the exterior, the salmon was not hard but firm and cooked... not dry at all. There is a creamy sauce that drizzled on the salmon and around it as well... it was nice and slightly thick and perfect for dipping the salmon in. It was not a greasy or heavy sauce but the perfect viscosity. There was also a little bit of aioli drizzled more on the vegetables than on the salmon... it had a slight horseradish taste (it reminds me of a lighter, creamier wasabi). There wasn't a lot aioli added so i couldn't get a full taste of everything they used to make it... The creamy sauce and the aioli complimented one another very well because the aioli added a bit of a kick of it. There was a little bit of vegetables as well... there was asparagus, leafy green, peas, baby potatoes and fresh cherry tomatoes. I want to emphasize how fresh the vegetables were and how perfectly cooked the greens were. They were cooked just right and they were crispy and had a nice bite to it. The potato was cooked thoroughly and the inside was soft and smooth.   Pecan Chocolate Brownie, Cherry Compote- The brownie was soft and it crumbled around the edges. There were large pecans inside which was nice because it gave a nice contrast of textures with the brownie being soft and the pecan being hard. There was a bit of plain yogurt around the brownie which added a bit of creaminess and acidity to it. I'm happy that they did not over add sugar to this dish because a lot of places add sugar with more sugar and it is disgusting. This one was perfect and there were fresh cherries used as garnish... which i appreciated because I enjoyed the freshness it added to the dish. Lastly, it was nicely presented with a mint leaf and a light dust of icing sugar.     I don't think I should review what my friends had because I don't think my reviews would be thorough enough but the other dishes they got were decent/good that includes: the Barcelona style shellfish stew, the smoked paprika grilled chicken scallopini, ontario farmed strawberries and the lemon semi-fredo.   The interior was beautiful and everything. You can check out the pictures i took and the ones other people took to decide for yourself. I personally think flavor and cleanliness of a restaurant is the most important thing. Everything looked clean and nice and the dishes were all perfectly washed. I am slightly obsessed with sanitation so i am pointing this out so that people like me can feel at ease."}
{"text":"I feel as though I could prop myself up at the bar everyday and be a happy camper.   This might be the bay street world but walking into John & Sons is like walking into your home. Everyone is friendly and inviting. There is never that pretentious air about this place.   I like to sit at the bar and watch the Oysters to be shucked.. They always have a variety of options (duh they are an oyster house after all) and I am a big fan of pairing a platter of Oysters with their fries and mayo.   As for the mention of it being over priced, I feel that it's the rates for food and drinks are competitive with the neighbourhood. This place is a well oiled, well managed venue that is worth a visit to next time your in the financial district."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 dozen oysters (e.g., kusshi) and 2 special appetizers (Ahi tuna and steak tartare) which were all delicious. The oysters went beautifully with their sweeter vinegar + shallots salsa and scotch bonnet sauce. Our waiter was also nice enough to give us aperitifs on the house.  We had a lovely time and look forward to coming back when we are in Toronto next."}
{"text":"I agree with many of the other diners who have said that the food here is overpriced and the portions are small. I have been here twice and both times they have failed to impress. They try so hard to make their menu sound so sophisticated but the quality of the dishes just does not deliver. I question whether or not it is cooked by a trained chef or just the average home cook. I do have to give them some credit for the seafood being fresh. The oysters were delicious but that's no merit of theirs since they just pluck them out of the water and shuck them."}
{"text":"Food was so tasty!  Small menu and well executed. Ambience is comfortable and classy.  Staff could have been more inviting however."}
{"text":"My first foray into Oysterdom was a rousing success! I never thought I'd enjoy the slimy little things but after a little liquid courage I jumped in and I'll never look back. Apologies to the lovely staff that had to clean up the big spill I had when I slipped and knocked over a couple of glasses at the bar :/."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar after work on a Tuesday.  No one else was in the joint.  Bartender/server wouldnt give us a menu although we asked twice.  I asked what sort of cocktails they had, and he said, \"The usual kinds that places have.\"  Oyster sauces were good (the Asian pear one was nice).  Ambiance was basically identical to the Terroni that used to be there.  He brought us only the jars of sauces, didn't give us the Tabasco that I saw on the tables.  Didn't give us glasses of water, which would have been nice.  For $90, we got 12 oysters and two drinks.  I don't get it."}
{"text":"We had our Xmas staff party here and it was awesome. Drinks were flowing and of excellent quality. Little fish and chip boxes were delicious and uber cute. Oysters were plentiful and fresh and the service was amazing. Although it's small, the vibe is really good and I wouldn't hesitate to come back here for some after work drinks and oysters."}
{"text":"Dropped in by myself after a super-long day and sat at the bar. Super lucky find. Friendly staff, amazing oysters. The scallops and pork belly blew my mind. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"For five stars, you gotta be pretty darn good! John and Sons delivers! This is our second time here - the first was a few years back. From our first experience we have raved about how good the oysters were in comparison to the many oyster houses we have visited all over the world.  We don't order food here, the portion sizes are small and the oysters are superb! It it a great starting off point for a night out!  They always have a good selection of east and west coast and all are distinct in flavor. We spoke with the manager John, who schooled us on their selection process and care of the oysters, it does make a difference.  Great place and great bar conversion! We look forward to coming again when visiting Toronto!"}
{"text":"Went with girlfriend for summerlicious lunch. The patio seats are comfortable. The waiters are super nice with awesome personalities. I asked one of the guys to present the gift I brought to my girlfriend, he's totally a great performer and I was impressed. The fishpie and fish and chips we ordered are great, oysters are fresh , totally a must visit midtown restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing oysters. We were craving oysters after work - where else would we go but to John & Sons! As with all eateries in the Financial District, it's pretty busy during the weekday lunch hours. We got a table immediately on a Friday evening though at the bar. Service was quick. Oysters were fresh. The company was great."}
{"text":"Cute little hidden gem off a side street. The night we went there were a lot of business men and it was very loud but the atmosphere was still okay. We had the lobster poutine which was awesome! Salty, but awesome! And I had the Tagine which was really great! It's fun to watch the bar maid shucking oysters for hours."}
{"text":"The Rosedale area needed an oyster place and John & Sons certainly delivers. It has a great vibe, very relaxed. The service is awesome. And once when they made a mistake and made up a platter of 20 oysters instead of the 12 we ordered, they happily served them to us anyway instead of taking 8 back - the mistake was caught in the kitchen. The selection of oysters is very good, and the accompanying sauces are great. Aside from oysters the other food I have eaten there is good - the clam chowder delicious! But we definitely go for the oysters. Why one less than 5 stars? The wine selection could be more robust."}
{"text":"Location: 1 Balmoral Avenue, Toronto, ON M4V 1J5 (Yonge & St. Clair W)  Price: $$$ Service: Awesome   This is such an amazing place to have seafood!!! Love love love. I went to John & Sons Oyster House for summerlicious and I was in food heaven! To be honest a lot of the summerlicious restaurant are overrated and overly priced. But I have nothing bad to say about this place. I usually take pictures of the food, but I was too distracted by the amazing food. This is the first summerlicious restaurant that I loved from A to Z. I shall share why...  Everything from the appetizer to dessert was on point. I had the oysters along with three of their choice of sauce. The main course was the salmon and it was to die for!!! It was cooked right; buttery, crispy, tender, and flavourful. The dessert was good as well.   If you go during a time where the patio is open take the advantage and sit out there. The setting of the restaurant makes it feel as if you're near a body of water and it makes the whole experience so much better. The patio area is super cute and there's so many pillows!! It was comfortable and I definitely went into a food coma after I was done.  The best thing about the restaurant are the people. The servers were super friendly, quirky, and lively. I am definitely coming back for more food.   Verdict: in LOVE"}
{"text":"We come here for oysters and they are delicious. I really like the decor here, too."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  There are a number of gluten-free items on the menu that are clearly marked with a GF next to them. There are items in each category except for the dessert section, but they obliged to my request for a bowl of salted caramel ice cream. I started off with the ceviche, which was served with fried corn tortillas. It was good but the portion was tiny so it may not be enough to share with more than one other person. For my main I had the fish tacos, which are breaded with a cornmeal batter and is gluten-free. They also have duck tacos that are also gluten-free.  The only reason I gave it one star less  is because the service was ok. The wait staff were fine but they weren't that friendly. Also halfway through our meal they started playing music on the sound system REALLY loudly to the point where we were yelling across the table and still couldn't hear each other. We wrapped up quickly after that and left.   Note: I am gluten intolerant and don't have celiac's disease. My reactions range from mild to moderate depending on how much gluten I consume. I don't know what the likelihood of cross-contamination is here but the staff seemed to know what gluten during my ordering discussion with them.    TL;DR several GF options, music is too loud"}
{"text":"Our group came in for a weeknight dinner.  For appetizers we had had the crab cake, beet salad, the cheese spread, and of course, oysters.  Our entrees were the 1.5 lb lobster, the mussels, and the chicken (we had a non-seafood-eater).    There was a good selection on the oysters, and the shucking was clean.  The prices were high, but on par with the quality.  Overall, we found the food excellent.  (Except the chicken.  But honestly no one expects the meat entrees to be good at a seafood restaurant anyway, so we'll let that slide.)  I was not happy with the portion sizes, however.  We spent more than $60 before tip per person, and somehow I walked away not quite full.  I feel like the appetizers should have been bigger, or maybe the lobster should have come with more sides.  The appetizers are sized for one person, not for sharing.    The food also took a really long time to come.    Our server was really good.  He didn't rush me when I was indecisive, and he didn't seem upset when we wanted to modify our orders after he'd already given it to the kitchen.    I liked the atmosphere as well.  It was small and clean, and it felt upscale without seeming snobby.    I don't know if I'll come back though - the whole not feeling full thing at the end is kind of a mood killer.  I like the atmosphere, the service, and the quality of the food.  But after it's all been served to me, I'm left unsatisfied, like, \"Hey, that's it?\"  I guess my problem can always be solved by shelling out more dough next time."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious. Small location (more of a drinks place? Limited seating and most of it is around the marble bar table) but food was good. Got the mussels, tagine, and lemon torte. All of it was delicious. My friend got the fish and chips and it was also really tasty (great batter coating... Kinda wished that i got the fish and chips rather than the tagine but both were nice)."}
{"text":"Visited this Yonge & St.Claire spot mid week for lunch. Service was good, food was pretty average. A decent spot for lunch if you're in to seafood."}
{"text":"Had lunch here last week. Fortunately we had a reservation because the place became quickly full. Service was quick and friendly. In our group we had the smelts, daily catch, lobster roll, and Pacific cod. All dishes were very good. No complaints from anyone at the table. A little pricey for lunch perhaps and the room is quite noisy.  Btw, they do offer a burger for those who prefer to stay on land. I really liked the look of that lobster roll and will try that myself next time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the oysters were very fresh! Loved the multiple sauces they offer!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I came here for summerlicious with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday. This little restaurant is tucked away in a small street so may be hard to find.   Anyways, I was pretty excited judging from the menu but overall it was alright. For starters, I chose the salmon poke, the Arctic char as main and mini doughnuts as the dessert.  This was my first time having salmon poke so I'm not sure how good it's supposed to be but I thought this was meh overall. The Arctic char though was delicious...just the fish only. I didn't quite like their vegetables and it was really oily. And lastly, their mini doughnuts were nothing special, it came with a dollop of vanilla ice cream. But other then that, I'd pass.   The reason I gave it half stars is because we also ordered a dozen oysters which were a selection of what they had. And you can never go wrong with them, so those were great!"}
{"text":"I came here on a rainy day with my friend who came for a visit from Japan as she likes oysters. We came here for the summerlicious and I ordered the oysters, soft shell crab. The soft shell crab was cooked just right! Not too oily and no batter, I hate battered soft shell crab and very flavourful. You get the full crab. Good portion. I haven't had soft shell crab cooked this nicely for a long time. It was worth getting soaked walking over.   The oyster was ok. Small and not sweet enough. Nothing to write home about. The chocolate cake was like any chocolate cake. Again doesn't stand out.  But I will definitely come back for the the soft shell crab. I loved it!"}
{"text":"Friendly and efficient service,  fresh oysters and great environment with prices that don't break the bank.    This is a great venue."}
{"text":"This is where Rodney's was but now the John's & sons oyster house has a location downtown!   Here's the high level: 1) only 2 items on the menu don't have seafood 2) it's expensive  3) if you have a cholesterol problem, this isn't the restaurant for you...  My rating: Calamari - grilled and slightly spicy. Not a winner for me. It was chewy and the rapini was chewy too, not sure how that happened but neither myself nor my bestie could actually cut through. The rapini.  Crab cake - the taste was fantastic. It is a singular crab cake on a bed of salad with one giant crab leg on ice. Again, it was well made, I loved the home made sauce and it was almost seared/baked on. The top and bottom but the sides were nice and moist. It was just a really tiny portion  Baked Rockefeller oysters - pass... The shells and plate was scalding, the oysters, cold... Maybe it's supposed to be Ike that but I didn't find the hollandaise sauce with the bread crumbs and spinach all that exciting. No taste, high calories.  Lobster pouting - winner. And everyone should order this, rich, tender and large pieces of lobster in a creamy, cheesy sauce. The friends were freshly fried and crisp.  Salmon Indian candy - salad, smoked salmon (not the traditional pink stuff... It's big pieces of slightly dried salmon) on a berry compote and shallots... The biscuits are what made this dish but it was nothing to write home about but tasty nonetheless.  Finally the raw oysters. Based on my Rodney's post, I like pacific and generally smaller oysters. I find that their flavours are less fishy and more authentic, maybe I'm making it up but I feel like they taste more salt water-ish. I had the kushi from bc, the Glacier bay from New Brunswick and the kumarato from Washington. All were really great. They do come with a tray of hot sauces. Really hot was decently hot but the best was this hot and sour pear and garlic sauce.  Finished with the brownie - apparently a secret recipe by an old polish lady. Well, whatever that recipe is, you have to try it. It's warm and crisp on the outside and gooey with nuts in the center. It also comes with this great ice cream that also has perfectly toasted pecans crumbled and whole on top.  All in all, fabulous. I would go again and try a main next time but today was a fishy appetizer day."}
{"text":"Was there for a private event.  Service and food was very good. Great little spot!  I would recommend and look forward to the next time."}
{"text":"I discovered John's Oyster House about a week ago while working on a mural in the area - after my first visit later in the evening, it ended up becoming my go-to stop not only due to its vicinity to my workspace, but because the people that work here are genuinely kind, ideal-next-door-neighbour helpful, and an absolute pleasure to be around. You have to understand, this establishment is in the middle of the financial district, so you would expect suits galore and the type of snubbed nosed judgement that often comes from restaurants in this area. NOT SO. Each time I had come right from painting a wall, covered in dust, sweat, and spray paint, completely famished and (likely) looking a little disheveled and crazy. HOWEVER. That did not stop the wonderful people here from welcoming me to their table each time, pouring a damn fine Negroni, giving me on point recommendations on the menu (every one on point and I recommend the octopus, steak, and a selection of oysters) as well as a sample of a few of their personal favourites because we shared a smile.   Outside of the great food, good company and lovely atmosphere - what did it for me was when their kitchen had just closed and the two people heading up the bar (Ryan and Nicole) basically took the time to CALL a few restaurants in the area to make sure that I could find a late night meal after painting all day. They didn't have to. They did so out of the kindness of their damn hearts. Mark of a damn fine place - when the character of each person matches the caliber of the food. Keep on keepin' on, John & Son's - you are doing it all right."}
{"text":"The oysters and lobster poutine were good.   The ceviche, however, was not. At all. It was an extremely overpriced thimble of fish with way too much celery-- probably 2/3 celery and lettuce. Rip off.   The deep fried smelts were average.   Definitely pass on the lobster dumplings. Overpriced too for the 4 you get and the flavour is disappointing. If you had told me the dumplings were vegetarian I would have believed you.   Service was a mixed bag--it was friendly enough but distracted even though the restaurant wasn't busy. Food was also slow. Drinks were solid, though.   Overall: I wouldn't come here for dinner, but would swing by for oysters and drinks."}
{"text":"Disappointing...  I had the fish tacos - bland.  Also, the menu says \"banh mi\" style which is why I was expecting it to be be a baguette bread.  However, the tacos came in cold, limp and tasteless tortilla style shells."}
{"text":"So here's the thing about John and Sons - Great ambiance, wonderful atmosphere...however the service left a bit to be desired along with the fact that the waiter oversold each entree that was offered.  The portions that came out were small, similar to what you would get from Captain Highliner at the grocery store, the chips portion was almost non-existent...in fact i'm still trying to figure out exactly what was paid for...  Meal portions aside, the tatar sauce was incredible, very rich, light and creamy (always a personal preference) and paired well with the Haddock.   Overall i've had better for the same price elsewhere...But for Mid-town I suppose this is what passes for 'value'"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on line we decided to go as our Valentine's dinner. We got there around 4:30pm for the happy hour oyster special for $1.15 each which is great price. The size was a bit small for some of them so we didn't feel it was worth the price. Our server was nice. We placed the ordered and it took awhile before the food showed up on our table and the restaurant wasn't even busy....strange. We ordered the winter salad to share (Prosciutto wrapped, bleu bénédictine, fig, balsamic crema, arugula, candied pecans) and it tasted like it was missing something (but I can't pinpoint what it is). The shaved cheese was too strong so I didn't really like that. The smell wasn't very pleasant either. For the entree we ordered the scallops with risotto and Halibut (with moroccan spiced heirloom carrots, beets, broad beans, carrot mascarpone purée, cider butter, parsnip curls). The Halibut was dry and almost look like it was a fake piece fish. It didn't have much taste to it and you can tell it's definitely not a fresh piece of fish. Not sure how long it's been in the freezer and then de-frosted. The veggies were a bit too crunchy to eat. Almost feels like you're going to chip a tooth if you bite too hard. The scallops looked over done and the risotto was too salty. We didn't bother eating dessert because we weren't very impressed with the meal overall.  This isn't an oyster bar that is worth coming back for. There are other gems in the city...."}
{"text":"Great location and decent food and vibe however one star review due to appallingly rude service.  Skip it unless you enjoy verbal abuse.  Was here earlier tonight with three girlfriends for dinner and drinks.  Service was aggressive and unfriendly from the get go however really crossed the line into rude at the end of the night.  We asked if we could have separate bills and we were informed it was not possible 'because the system was 15 years old.'  One of the girls in our group asked for clarification, wondering how it could be impossible to take the time to split a bill in a nearly empty restaurant at 1040pm.  The female server was full of attitude: 'If it was THAT important to you, you should have mentioned it at the start.'  She was rude and shockingly unprofessional throughout this interaction.  We ended up doing the math (I've attached a screenshot of how crazy this bill got), tipping as little as possible, and leaving.  A disappointing end to an otherwise nice evening.  Location is good (just north of First Canadian Place), didn't like the oysters (better at Chase and with better presentation), dessert was good, wine average, and service terrible.  Prices aren't really worth it either ... food is nothing to write home about.  Not bad but certainly overpriced ... $24 for shrimp tacos for example.    Chain restaurant food at Daniel Boulud prices in a gulag service setting.  Skip it, so many better places to go in financial district."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here today!  I would recommend making reservations as it gets quite busy during the lunch hour. My sister and I arrived at around noon; without reservations, we were seated in an awkward area along the bar. Luckily, a table opened up and we were able to relocate. On Temperance, it's tucked in so you might have trouble finding it. I love the decor here; it's homey and cozy. I especially like the open concept where you can see oysters being shucked.   As for the food, my sister and I were happy with what we ordered. The shrimp tacos are so simple yet delicious. It comes with three tacos so it's a perfect portion for sharing. The fish and chips were also great; it wasn't too heavy and it wasn't overpowered by breading of the fish. We also ordered the lobster roll (w/ salad); this was another winner. Full of lobster chunks, this sandwich was a hearty one.  Lastly, I wanted to mention the service. It was excellent; staff came often to fill up our glasses and see how we were doing. Can't wait to return !  Good for: seafood, drinks, lunch/dinner"}
{"text":"Excellent oysters and loved the atmosphere! The staff was attentive and kind, especially to our young daughter."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch. We were greeted by a smiling and friendly hostess. We had the Oysters and clam chowder to start. Oysters were delicious, clam chowder was average. For our mains, I had haddock fish and chips and my husband had moules & frites. Both were delicious! Frites were really good. We finished off our meals with pecan pie with maple ice cream. A little sweet for my liking but my husband really enjoyed it.   Although my main course got mixed up (I think the waitress misheard my order) the service was prompt and the staff were quick to apologize.  Will definitely be coming back here again. Thanks for a great beginning to the weekend!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really cozy and relax. Even though the seat does not have any privacy. We still really enjoy the time there.  The oysters are absolutely fresh and yummy! The fish and chips are really good, normally I do not like to eat fried stuff but I can not stop eating the fish and chips they made! And for the steak, it was amazing! It's comes with modicum rare, and it's really tender and juicy!   Overall it is so impressive!  We defiantly will come back again!!"}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious lunch. Ordered: apps: 3 oysters and clam chowder.  Oysters were okay the waitress never explained to me which ones they were. Clam chowder was the best I've had in toronto. Mains: fish and chips and shrimp tacos. Fish was rly well battered but fries were not great. Tartar sauce is rly yummy. The shrimp tacos had too much sauce in them so it all dripped out onto the other waiting tacos and it just got so messy.  There was no spicy to them. Dessert: donuts and brownie. Donuts were too dense and doughy. Not enough sweetness, was just very lackluster. The brownie wasn't anything special as well. A mini ice cream scoop would've perked it up nicely."}
{"text":"Horrible!  I have gone to John & Sons Oyster House - twice.  I was so excited that an oyster house was opening up in the neighbourhood and so wanted to like it.  I had what they called Cioppino it was like canned tomato soup with some seafood thrown in.    The service is okay and I believe dinner was around $100 and one should really walk away feeling satisfied after spending that amount. It was honestly one of the worst meals I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and was really happy I did! The atmosphere was great as soon as I walked in. Our server was very helpful with us as we had a lot of questions regarding oysters (it was our first time!). Lobster poutine was great and I felt adventurous getting the Tuna BLT which was amazing! Light but not too filling. I would love to come back some day."}
{"text":"Most memorable feature: Big portions  The summerlicious portions were huuuuuge.  Wait staff were wonderfully attentive and friendly.  Although we had to wait a bit longer than expected (despite having a reservation), it was understandable since seating was very very limited.  The fish and chips are delicious and the tuna carpaccio was very fresh, as expected from a seafood restaurant.  The tagine was not as good as I envisioned it to be and the taste profile was a little bit disorientating but the meal recovered during dessert.  We left feeling satisfied and full nonetheless.  Dishes ordered: tuna carpaccio, mussels, fish and chips, tagine, brownie, torta caprese al limoncello"}
{"text":"Reserved a table for two for a Friday evening online, simple process.  Shared the following dishes: CALAMARI ($17): Tasty, but the rings were not separated and trying to separate them ourselves resulted in most of the batter being ripped off. The calamari was accompanied by \"crispy kale\" which was surprisingly good. FISH TACOS ($19 + $6 for an extra one): Nothing special. Veggie toppings tasted fresh but the fish was bland. LOBSTER POUTINE ($18): Delicious, would order again. Gravy was creamy and there were decent chunks of lobster meat. BROWNIE W/ICE CREAM ($9): Brownie was very rich (fudge-like) and ice cream came to our table 50% melted... our dish may have been forgotten in the bank?  Altogether a decent experience, deserving of a 3.5 maybe but given the many other options available in DT Toronto, I'm rounding down this time."}
{"text":"Great little spot with no frills but great service, fresh oysters and cold beer on tap."}
{"text":"This is A-Ok.  the prices are not low, but not particularly high.  The sound level is, however, loud indeed.  The lobster poutine is not great, but, not many places make it!  so, it was interesting.  the doughnut for desert was nice.  The oyster presentation was nice.  everyone liked every dish, and they have some local food, which, is, ahem, nice given the circumstances we always find ourselves in.   some gripes are that they don't erase their specials and oysters when they run out, and it is indeed quite loud.   I could see eating there again, but I would like to know about the places that are better that are mentioned without giving names!"}
{"text":"So I work nearby for years now, and have never been here till recently for summerlicious. Man oh man, have I missed out all these years! Everything they had was on point for our dinner. The apps were a good tease size, but loaded with flavours. Tuna tartar was very fresh, though I wouldn't mind if the portion was a tad greater. The gazpacho was light, refreshing, yet hits you with a bang of spice at the end of each spoon. The entrees' portions made up for the apps, with even bigger flavours, yet at the same time, the stars of the dish shined on the plate. Fish and chips were so lightly battered yet very crispy, with fish texture being next to perfect. The seafood chowder came with devouringly slurpable tomato sauce and bits. The dish was filled with a generous mix of soft mussels, clams, jumbo shrimps, and scallop. As if 2 courses couldn't make our table any happier, the desserts were deservingly inhalable. Hands down, probably one of the best brownies ever tasted in a long time. Lemon semi-fredo - tangy, yet fab finish. Looking forward to go again - see you there; cheers!"}
{"text":"Still finding their feet - I have every expectation they will get over the opening jitters.  First weird thing was the way the sat five parties right on top of each other on a single bench, while half of the tables sat empty...They may want to invest in 'reserved' signs to explain why they are walking people in to the busiest corner making for awkward crowded dining.   Let's see - fun, busy neighbourhood crowd...a bit too bright, and less sexy than Cappo or Quanto - wouldn't rate it for a date spot.  More of a group of friends kind of place.  Great Cesar, good diverse wine list - the space looks fresh after the Terroni to Divo non transformation.      Our server was fumbling, distracted and in near tears because of a frustrated patron who had been made to wait 45 min for his starter.  It took us a LONG TIME to get our drinks and the manger kept coming over, but not bringing the wine.   We ordered oysters...two varieties were sold out, but the ones we landed on were fabulous and fresh.  Went with a friend - we shared a bunch of things.  Everything was well flavoured and well presented - perhaps a slight amount of over thinking on the BLT, which was really a tower.  I love Rodney's on Bay, and know that this place will iron out the service kinks and become a huge success, so will go back..."}
{"text":"This place is all about the oysters - super fresh and nice selection.  Knowledgeable waitstaff make it a fun time.  Sauces with the oysters are great - really liked the sweet vinegar.  Atmosphere is nice and casual as well.  It's kind of tucked away but make the walk over, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Nothing was good  The oysters were just alright, the service was also extremly slow. Main course I had the scallops without the pork and it was pretty bland. Wine & desert was the only good stuff there. Won't be coming back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Came for oysters, and poutine. But also grabbed an old fashioned.  Old fashioned: this was the ugliest, saddest, old fashioned I ever had. I could make one at home nicer than this. It was def not pic worthy and tasted okay. But probably one of the worst I ever had.  Oysters: had a mix of oysters and really enjoyed the freshness.  Lobster poutine: amazing. Love the chunks of lobster and the very nicely crafted fries.  Chocolate brownie: pretty good. I'm a huge brownie lover so I usually enjoy brownies.  Overall, a good experience but the old fashioned was terrible."}
{"text":"Oysters were okay, though to be fair we didn't ask them to recommend their favourites of the day...if you go, you should do that. We chose oysters based on ones we knew we liked and, as I said, they were okay. They had almost no liquid left in them, which is probably why I didn't love them.  Wedge salad was good, 2/3 of the tuna sashimi trio was good (1/3 was ugh), chowder was okay, shrimp/corn fritters were good but heavy on the deep fry. Donuts were very tasty but cold...they didn't blow my mind. Nothing was terribly fabulous about the meal but it's a nice spot and I might go back one day to try the lobster poutine or the fish n chips, both of which I hear are great. Service was friendly but very unattentive....I know we were walk-ins (no rezzies) but that's no excuse."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Quiet. Great service. Awesome oysters with custom made sauces. Beet salad rocks- warn cheese on yellow beets!"}
{"text":"My favorite fish place in Toronto.  Oysters are fresh food is great and servers are friendly and attentive.  A bit pricey but worth it once in a while."}
{"text":"Had an impromput brunch.  Caesar could be more spicy. When i did request for a bit more heat, they were very friendly receptive to that. Generous portion. I rather have a smaller one with a bit more alochol in it.   Had the lobster grilled chese. I couldnt' finish it. I had half packed up for me and I had it for dinner at home. It was delicious. It smelled great. The cheese was just right. I wish there was a small slaw that came it with along with the two grilled / roasted peppers.  I made room for the doughnuts. The first one had minimal filling i took a small bite and then I was disappointed seeing it was only dough. Always nice to have warm doughnuts. The filling was too sweet, it was just right, but needed more of it in there please!  At the time I arrived it was rather quiet but by the time I left they were maybe at 1/2 or 3/4 capacity and they were already short staffed when there were queues of oysters to be shucked. I can see how they can be slow at times with service, but there were really friendly staff and try to be proactive when they can be.  Overall a good exeperience!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a birthday dinner.  Fresh, fresh seafood.  Had oysters on the half-shell from the East and West coasts - Canada and US.  Yum.  Partner had black cod and I the scallops.  Fresh and great presentation.  S'mores for dessert - Homemade marshmallows and chocolate sauce.  Fresh and warm.  Reservations required after 6pm.  A nice addition the the neighborhood.  Limited wines by the glass.  Busy and fun.  Nice chat with the GM.  Also have beef and chicken for non-seafood fans.  Plan to go back."}
{"text":"Lovely space for a seafood restaurant, very warm and cozy inside, dim lights, romantic atmosphere, white cupboards, tealight candles...  The food here is pretty good, fresh oysters though quite pricey, loved the kushi and the french kiss which were served with horseradish, lemon slices, on a bed of ice and four kinds of sauces ranging from mild to hot. The hot really is hot. Add with caution.   We also got the moule et frites and the scallop on risotto. My mussels came in a huge bowl, really good portion for the price, lots of flavourful broth underneath, I used all the complimentary bread to soak up the white wine infused broth. Delicious. The fries were really short which was annoying but had wonderful flavour and were crispy but not overly so. My friend had the risotto which was nice but he said the scallops were a bit over done."}
{"text":"This place is great for serious oyster fans. They have the highest quality oysters, knows how to prep them, and have more sauces to go with them than your batch of a dozen. But be ready to pay $$$ for them during prime time. Let's just say if you think you want to drop $10 for a round of friendly slurps, you better then head for the 7-Eleven.  Smelts are great, service friendly, and ambiance nicely nautical."}
{"text":"We came here for Summerlicious as John & Sons had a delicious looking menu. The only time my friend was able to get on short notice was a 9pm Friday night. We were worried about our hunger so we tried to come in early to see if they could get us a table. Sadly they couldn't so we killed time having drinks elsewhere.   John & Sons is very cozy and cute. It's a small restaurant so I can see why they couldn't seat us. It was quite busy when we came around 7. I feel they are tucked in away compared to the other restaurants on Temperance St. We got seated in a corner booth which was nice. Our group started out with an assortment of oysters - tasted so fresh. We then went on with the Summerlicious meals. I tried both the octopus and salmon poke appetizer as friends and I wanted to try both. They were both very good apps to start. We all ordered the Arctic char. It was done nicely, not dry and the skin was nice and crispy. I do have to comment that most of us thought the vegetables were quite salty. For the dessert I had the sorbet - nothing special. The brownie and donuts I was told were mediocre as well.   I would probably come back to John and Sons when I'm craving for seafood. Overall, i felt the quality of the food was good."}
{"text":"I went to their Fish and Chip place, next door and it is mighty good. Their fries were perfectly seasoned... mmmm. My mouth waters just thinking about them. The fish was delicious, the right amount of batter & better than what I've had at another place in TO, which had mostly batter and oil, hardly any fish in their fish n' chips....ugh.  The service was great. Water to start, which comes refreshingly in a glass bottle and poured into, slightly-larger than-shot-, glasses. I ordered a salad, their regular fish and chips (haddock fillets) and a boylan's root beer. Very satisfying.   It's a small space, but it is meant to be a place you come in, eat at, and then leave, designed not to linger for too long. They have great knick-knacks that are used as decor. Makes one feel close to the sea and that for me is not at all a bad thing."}
{"text":"food was delicious! but for the price, not worth it when there are better out there. ordered oyster po boy app and chef special.  the oyster po boy was delicious, but the bun was untoasted and i think oyster boy in st lawrence market is way better then this.  chef special was a seafood stew made perfectly. but wish it had more then just calamari and squid.  made the dish quite flat in variety. shrug. didn't find this place at its finest."}
{"text":"A true hidden gem in Toronto, the location itself is also pretty hidden. I've been here couple times, ordering differt things on the menu, but have always been consistently getting their oysters.  Ask for an oyster platter if you don't have a favourite. They will put together a dozen or 2 oysters with as many different oysters as they can. They have all been fresh, cold, and served to us in a fair amount of time.  On the other hand, I have always had to wait for my main dishes for more than I'd want to. The wait time when the restaurant is packed versus when the restaurant is almost empty was the same. Food here is amazing, highly recommend the Tuna. But if I were to take the wait time into consideration, it would not be worth the wait if I were hungry.   Service here is delightful. Give yourself at least 1.5-2 hours here, even for a \"quick\" dinner."}
{"text":"The food is great here. My friend and I just had a dinner of oysters, unfortunately we didn't come during the Happy Hour so it was pretty damn expensive especially with the bottle of prosecco we ordered. But the oysters were lovely. If you have the chance, try the Wellfleet.   The location is a little tucked away, about a 5 minute walk from Osgoode Station. The decor is nice and warm, tiny bit of hipster pirate. There's only one bathroom for each gender, so you'll have to wait in line if it gets busy.   However, I wish I could give the place a 3.5 rating instead of 4. We went on a Saturday at 5pm, so the place wasn't packed. The waiters, while they got our orders right, were not very attentive or particularly friendly, and with one order, it took over 30 minutes to get our food and drinks.   But I will go back for the oysters, preferably at Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Finally found a good restaurant in Toronto! Being from LA and NYC I have always been so disappointed in the restaurant choices. Well this place does not disappoint! It is everything fabulous. Full of flavor and love! The service was amazing, the atmosphere was amazing and the food was just as good. After 10 years of eating my way through Toronto, I've finally found a place that meets  my standards! Get the muscles  and the Moscow mules."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here, especially the oysters. Great selection of fresh oysters. Seafood dishes are generally good. Johns falls down on service and it is reliably sloooow. The staff works hard but numbers are thin. My group would have ordered another bottle of wine and another dozen oysters but it was just taking too long so we moved on. John leaves a lot of money on the table by not having enough servers. Prices are ok for the area, staff is friendly and it's a pleasant place. Great if you have lots of time."}
{"text":"Came in with a few friends on a Friday night - decor/vibe of the restaurant is great, nice staff, intimate setting.  - We ordered a dozen oysters which were absolutely delicious and came with a variety of flavours/sauces to top it with, which I honestly wish I ordered more of! Great quality although a bit pricey but you're paying for quality.  - Shared the lobster poutine with a friend and it was probably the best poutine I've had in a while - lobster was fresh and the appetizer itself was heavy and could probably be a meal for one. Highly recommended. - Ordered the fish tacos and this is the only reason I didn't give this place five stars - the pita was flaky, dry, and overall super hard to chew. It was gross and turned me off ALTHOUGH the fish was so delicious I ended up eating that on its own. I did however, complain to the staff about it, and she agreed to take off the cost of the tacos we didn't eat. This is the only reason I'm a bit turned off of this place although it was delicious otherwise, I probably wont go back unless it's for oysters and I'm looking for somewhere convenient in terms of location."}
{"text":"Went here for the last day of winterlicious without a reservation and although they were busy, they were very accommodating. The atmosphere was great, classy but welcoming. Our server was friendly and quick. We had oysters for our first course and they were fresh and came with delicious homemade sauces and horseradish. For the main I had Arctic char with a root vegetable medley and it was spot on, while my date had the fish and chips which was also on point. The desert we had didn't really blow me away, I had the brownie and she had the donuts, but it was fine. All in all the experience was delightful, from the moment we walked in to our exit we felt very welcomed and the food was great. We're for sure going back."}
{"text":"great buck a shuck oysters! they're actually $1.15 but the extra 15 cents is worth it! much tastier than other places. their fries and garlic aioli are also delicious. i haven't eaten anything else yet, though.    it's a nice, cozy restaurant that you wouldn't expect to be in the hustle and bustle of bay street. the staff are also very nice and personable."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Only:  Hidden away just off Bay St, this unassuming place is a pretty popular place for Happy Hour throughout the week (3:00-6:00pm). With $1.00ish /Oyster, and some damn good old fashioned's, it's a not a bad way to get rid of your Monday blues!   It's not a very large space, so tables are limited. If there's just a few of you, grab a seat at the bar. It's almost a guarantee you'll get quicker service, and keep them oysters coming! Loved the variety of sauces, and definitely fresh. I did look at the menu, but decided to pass. After a few drinks, greasy Chinese food became my destiny."}
{"text":"Had a good meal at John's tonight.   Made a reservation for 8pm. Was greeted by a friendly hostess and was sat immediately. He waitress promptly came over and we ordered cocktails. I had a cosmopolitan. A little bit light in the alcohol, which I wasn't surprised about given the previous reviews.  My BF and I ordered -the crab cake and the oyster po' boy sliders for appetizers. The crab cake was good, came on top of a bed of arugula. I thought it was a small portion though.  There were 3 sliders for the po' boys. They were great. -had the black cod, tuna blt, and lobster pouting for dinner. Everything was good but the bechemel sauce was a bit runny.   All in all, a good meal. I will return."}
{"text":"My experience was based on recent visit of Summerlicious.  Service - not very friendly to us; server never came back to re-fill the water. She checked on us only once. She didn't explain the different sauces for the oyster. I overheard she explained the oyster to our next table.  We waited quite a long time in between courses.  The server just left all the dessert spoons on the table; she even mis-counted the number of people on the table. I was left without a fork for my donuts.  Food - overall taste is good, but the portion is very small. I especially enjoy the desserts.  Would I come back for regular meals? Em... maybe not."}
{"text":"Hands down the ONLY oyster house I go to in Toronto.  I love the atmosphere--lively and jovial.  The oysters are absolutely amazing.  The staff is friendly.  I think they are going to have to expand the menu a bit over time and it can be a little pricey  but I am so glad to have these guys in the neighborhood!  Stay tuned for an update!"}
{"text":"As a huge seafood lover, how is that I did not know about this place before?  I know this place is tucked away on Temperance Street but am I ever glad I found it.    We ordered oysters, the smelts and the grilled octopus as apps.  All were delicious but the standout for me was the octopus.  It was melt-in-your-mouth tender and incredibly well seasoned and very flavourful.  I would have that dish as an entree if I could!  Amazing!    I ordered the scallops as an entree.  Three plump scallops were served on a bed of creamy mushroom risotto.  Again, the scallops were perfectly seasoned and cooked and melted in my mouth.  The risotto was also delicious.  My dining companions had the special of the day (sea bass) and the halibut.  Both were excellent.    We ordered the chocolate brownie for dessert to share.  It was served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  A very decadent finish to an amazing lunch.  No dinner for me tonight!   The risotto and brownie made this a splurge meal but it was so worth it."}
{"text":"love this place!!   love the atmosphere, oysters + lobster poutine!!"}
{"text":"A perfectly lovely and intimate place hidden away. Great oysters! Full menu of good stuff but lacking anything green which is the only downer. Good wine list as well with decent variety."}
{"text":"Expensive but lovely.  This is favourite place tucked away to grab a drink downtown.  Super elegant and cool. Nice tiling, great cocktails,  sparkling wine, oysters"}
{"text":"Great spot. Great scene. Oysters are a little smaller than what you might expect from another great spot 'Rodney's' on King, but more manageable and delicious.  At both you get the array of delicious dressings ranging from a delicious scotch bonnet sauce to an exciting vinegar drizzle.  On point!"}
{"text":"This was a cozy place with a bar area and a handful of small tables, with the diners ranging from casual to dressy-ish.  We ordered the oysters, fish & chips and scallops. I would say everything was pretty tasty- the oysters were very fresh! (beware the hot sauce because a little bit really goes a long way...)  May return in the future to try the rest of their menu because I do like me some seafood :)"}
{"text":"My parents, fiancé and I came to celebrate my dad's birthday! We started with oysters, baked oysters, and the lobster poutine. All were delicious. My mom and I both had the halibut, fiancé got the scallop risotto, and my dad had the sea bass special. We all left satisfied. Only complaint was that they were a little understaffed and service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"The owner emailed me to express his apologies, pay for my dry cleaning and invite us back. I am impressed by how much he cares. I am bumping the review up two stars due to this and because the service before was great and the food is consistently amazing."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience. We made a reservation for 9:00PM and never actually got a table. The restaurant is tiny and the staff do not know how to seat people to account for time. When we arrived we were not greeted. After prompting a response from the hostess she informed us that no table was available although our name was on the list . She then proceeded to walk away after suggesting we sit at the dirty bar. For the price of the food (21 CAD) for simple fish and chips this place had really terrible, inconsiderate staff. I would stay away if you want to have a nice dining experience."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant since it opened and loved it. I work in the area and always recommended it to clients and co-workers. Went recently and I was surprised that the quality and service had gone down hill. Never to return."}
{"text":"I recommend making reservations even for lunch.  We stopped here while visiting Toronto and we love it.  Great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Oysters were great!  We'd come back just for oysters. Ryan knows his oysters. Explained all to a detail.  Love fresh horseradish and a variety of different spices.  -* somewhat limited menu.   Oysters don't show pricing.    -* service is slow and non-attentive.  Sitting in front of you at the bar.  You should engage.  Offer a water at very least."}
{"text":"Great oysters, very fresh.  Had Malpeque, Raspberry Point and Faxbury. Beet salad was a great combo with watermelon and goat cheese. Loved the choco brownie for dessert. Cozy atmosphere and decent service.  Would recommend!"}
{"text":"A hidden little oyster bar on Temperance and Bay, it's across from Sweet Lulu. Easily missed, but beautiful people manage to find it and eat here.  Beautiful people as in.. customers were nicely dressed.  We came at around 5:30, and there were lots of tables to pick. My gal and I knew we were staying here for a drink + long talks, but the restaurant never got 100% full. There would often be 2-3 tables empty, so we didn't feel so bad staying there until 8.  Oysters range from $3 to $3.75 in price per. Their list of fresh oysters that day was only 5 items long. You order as many as you want, there are no half-dozen or dozen specials. We opt for the kushi's and the kunamoto's. They offer 5 condiments: from vinegar, to cocktail, to very spicy cocktail.   Also we had the Moules et Frites $16: steamed mussels in a creamy white wine soup (with shallot, bacon, fennel). The fries were quite salty but very generous in quantity.   We enjoyed our mojito and the service was fantastic. $27 (with tax, tips) per person for this dinner.   I love that it's a quiet location with lots of people but it's not overly crowded (unlike King Street patio bars on a hot summer day. Wow!! 1h wait!!?)."}
{"text":"Came in for the Summerlicious menu... and it was fantastic!  This location is great, at the corner of Yonge and Balmoral.  We asked the hostess if we could sit on the patio even though it was packed, and she got us out there.  Patio is recommended, it is covered, with high walls... so, it is almost like you are inside... but with massive airy windows.  you can see in the picture below, the patio is right under the sign.  I opted for the Clam Chowder which was superb... and was told that I should get the fish and chips since they are best in the city.  I wasn't sure if I wanted to do that since I had come down from Aurora specifically for some finer dining... but those be some amazing fish and chips... maybe the best I had ever had.  Service was good... food was great, patio was awesome.    OH.. and we did sample some oysters, which were yummy.  Recommended!"}
