{"text":"Great place to watch a game.  On Sundays they have a make-your-own Bloody Mary bar which is outstanding.  They are also cheap-- $4 (I think) and also have a Mimosa special.  

I have not eaten a meal here.  I have had the pimento cheese dip (which was an awful consistency-- think not-all-the-way melted Velveeta), I have seen the wings, and had a various assortment of fried bar food.  It was all fine.  My friends thought the burger was delicious-- both were suffering from the liquor flu so I am not trusting their judgment 100%.

The service here has never been good.  

The location works.  The back patio is fun (has its own bar) and the Bloody Mary bar is fun.  This is a place to go and drink, not go to eat.  And don't be surprised if you have to get your own drink from the bar because your server is no where to be found.

Maybe I am just disgruntled.  I miss the Press box being here..."}
{"text":"Good service. Top notch wingz. Great afternoon weather. Mimosas were good but they basically shanked my pants to my ankles by not offering the whole carafe and letting me pay 2 hard earned dollar bills for one of the baby sized mimosas. Other than that all around helluva time!"}
{"text":"absolutely loved this place! Not only was the pimento cheese burger out of this world, but the service I received here was one of the best I have ever had! 

Heaven was my server & she was very informative, quick to take care of us, and she kept a smile on her face the whole entire time! Will definitely be back! Thank you guys!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was very enjoyable our waitress was fantastic. Julie who just came down from Rhode Island is very personable had great suggestions and what a sweet personality. Enjoyed the experience. Will definitely be back and recommend to friends and colleagues."}
{"text":"Wings were awesome!  Bartender (Kelsey) was super cool, we had a great time chatting with her. Definitely heading back."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday lunch with awesome weather, as you could imagine finding parking would be a challenge.  We used the lot of GoodFood since they don't open till 5:30.
We were quickly being seated at the patio, however the table was not stable, we then later moved to the table behind us, and the second table was worse than the first, it was so wobble that I constantly worried drinks would tip over and spill anytime.  We ended up moving back to the first table.
It took a while for the food to come out, none of our two burger orders were made the way we desired, both came out well done when we asked otherwise.  Wings were good, plus half off special.
It seems to be a decent sport bar overall, but I don't know if I would go back again, especially when I think about the unstable patio tables.  It takes away somewhat a relaxing Sunday brunch experience since you always have to focus on the drinks of the table."}
{"text":"Go here for amateur night for sure!  You might as well be hanging out at a chain bar with drunken frat boys and mini-skirts crooning to Top 40.  I guess Bar Charlotte is back....only on Montford.  I'd have a better time at Applebee's Bar & Grill."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to go on Montford. The patio is great and to be honest... I've never sat inside. Service is always good here and the food is impressive for thinking this is a bar with \"pub grub\". Fun place to hang out and they always have a great music mix playing outside."}
{"text":"Good place to go watch sports and just hang out with your friends. Food is pretty standard bar food and has good service.  Mixed crowd on Saturday night. I enjoyed my experience."}
{"text":"This is a fair spot. Solid patio experience, but pretty loud inside - you're gonna get DJ'ed on Friday for sure. It was slammed when I went, with the usual suspects in Charlotte (a lot of attractive ladies around on the Friday I went, with the requisite number of button-up shirted dudes in tow). My friends mentioned that the Montford area was filling up because Uptown (as people in Charlotte call downtown) was becoming less attractive. So, apparently it's always like that. Service wasn't necessarily slow, but we were in a booth and no one served us. If you don't mind a crowd and mostly standing, not a bad place - particularly if you live in the South Park area."}
{"text":"Kelsey recommended the wings with a combination dry rub and sauce. They were awesome. This bar is the best hangout in Charlotte. And Kelsey is one hell of a bartender. Great food and great drinks and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was in town for the week and stopped in for a quick bite to eat. They had me at, \"Hello.\" Brazwells is ME: from the decor to the energy; food offerings to the actual taste; cleanliness to the en pointe service. I loved it. 

Our bartender Kelsey was so helpful in deciding what eat/drink. She was very informative and so much fun! We had such a lovely experience that we had to go back one more time before we left NC!! 

Will definitely be back on my next visit!"}
{"text":"I have been back a few times since my last review. I want to love this place, and I do find myself coming back. However, the service has been pretty bad lately. Recently, my friends and I came by for a beer, but decided to eat in. We let the hostess know this and she brought us menus. Then, we waited. 
Over the course of 35 minutes, we tried flagging down a few waitresses, but they were ignoring us. One waitress in particular was spending all her time and one table. That table sat down when we did and had their appetizers and full meals out before we ever even got a drink order in! 
I finally went to the bar and asked if we could possibly get a server. The girl who eventually helped us did a decent job, but we waited so long to order that only one of my friends ate. Everyone was pissed, and I really can't blame them. Overall, we were there almost an hour and a half just to get our meals and everything. I like the casual vibe and it is a decent spot to watch a game, but it's definitely not the place for decent customer service. My advice? Just come for the beer and order at the bar."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite neighborhood spots.  It is a fun bar with a great outdoor space and the food is definitely a cut above bar food with a variety of choices.  For example, try the salmon salad. This salad is really big and very filling.  If you are really hungry and like it a little spicy, try the buffalo chicken sandwich - it is huge and very tasty.  Don't forget to try to fried pickles too!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, especially on Iowa Hawkeye nights. Alyssa was a great server, and entertaining during the game. Definitely recommend this place and ask for Alyssa!"}
{"text":"Great location, ok service when you sit outside, horrible food. Good for outside seating and beer..."}
{"text":"Another great chill place to hang. Depending on the time of day the vibe can change but the food is great, awesome drinks, lots of servers and bartenders, (most of them very attractive and friendly) and just a comfortable place to hang. Try the Sunday brunch and have the pico chicken, the wings are good, most sandwiches are great, and it's just a very comfortable place. Out back is a great deck to chill or inside with lots of TV's for sporting events.  Montford is the hottest spot in the city these days and Brazwell's started the boom. And I saw an average review of a burger but apparently the writer didn't have the southern burger with cole slaw and chili. YUMMY.  I hope to go back this weekend."}
{"text":"Love the outdoor space and the live music was GREAT but the service could be improved. Our waitress appeared to be the only one running around working. Took about 20 minutes to get our check. Food was decent, yummy chicken & french fries. Disappointing artichoke dip, was very green & almost artificial looking."}
{"text":"I'm been going to Brazwells for a couple of years now and always get good service by the staff.  The food is surprisingly good for a pub.  I love the outdoor patio area when the weather is nice.  Great place to watch sports."}
{"text":"One of my fav hangouts after work. Half price apps are great. Lots to choose. Great service and beautiful people. Definitely Premo bar ! Craft beer but mostly in bottle. Few popular drafts. Outside area in back is awesome in rain or shine and they have heaters when it's cool out. Check it out !"}
{"text":"Since my last review they have cleaned house of the rude waitresses and the staff is great now. However, management quit offering a side salad and now only offer a giant size. Managers! Please bring back the smaller side salad. It is costing you business cause now we don't order any salad. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Great place for Happy Hour! We typically go here either to start or end the night, and it can get pretty packed. Cornhole on the deck is clutch, and this place is the best for watching NFL games. They have a bloody mary bar on Sundays and tons of TV's. Never a problem watching the games here."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great place for weekend fun. Awesome Bloody Mary bar on the weekends. Great patio when it's warm outside. I go here a lot and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Popular bar on Montford with a great back deck.  I was there on a Fri night and it got pretty packed with a young, 20 something crowd.  There isn't much special about the place beyond the deck.  Beers are typical, service is average, people in abundance."}
{"text":"Excellent bar/restaurant!  The menu items are always tasty, and the waitstaff is not hard on the eyes!  My buddies and I like it for lunch.  

The only negative was a month or so ago, I went with my son and 6 of his friends for a bachelor dinner the week before his wedding.  We sat there for probably 2+ hours and ate and drank to the tune of $200+ ..... then the hostess asked us to give up our table!  She was nice about it, but if I hadn't been 'well lubricated' by that time, I'm sure it would have pissed me off.  

That's the only negative I'd have for a truly great establishment."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a burger and fries, but if you get the seared tuna wrap, don't expect for it to be seared. With the wrap, expect a fully cooked piece of tuna."}
{"text":"Staff is incredibly friendly and the wings are delicious. This is my go to spot to watch NFL games on Sunday. They also have one of the best patios on Montford."}
{"text":"After writing a review at Brazwells Restaurant in uptown Charlotte, NC I was contacted by a manager to reach out to him with his contact information provided. I emailed him right away! Got no response at all. I was then verbally abused by worker at the establishment via Facebook! She was threatening me that things would happen if I didn't take the post down!!!!! Out of control! Contacting the counties health services dept first thing Monday morning!!!!!"}
{"text":"So the wait staff is full of nacho ninja's (i.e. we had a few lone chips sitting on the once bountiful nacho plate and they kept trying to take our plate away even though we were still working on them). A bit of a turn off if you ask me. Another turn off is when I am thirsty and can't get a drink in a timely manner and when our server takes our cards to pay the tab and doesn't come back for a good 15 minutes letting us think that she skated off to South Park mall to go on a shopping spree.

Nice patio though, it was bumping for a random 70 degree weekend day in Charlotte but the crowd sure enough changed to the trite early 20's crowd with too many popped pastel colored collars for my liking. Food was decent--as stated before we started off with the nachos which were surprisingly delicious and I had the buffalo shrimp appetizer. They had wallet friendly drink specials, lots of room in the back and a great selection of food but I think if I were to come back, it would be for the day drinking aspect alone."}
{"text":"Great summer time bar! This is an awesome spot to stop for a few or 10 cocktails on a summery day. The crowd looks to be made up of a good mix of locals. This looks like the type of place you drink beer, cheap beer. They had $2 champagne of beers and $1.50 PBR. 

This will be a stop on my way by every time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go in Charlotte. Montford and brazzwells are tops in my book. Kelsey is by far the best bartender in Charlotte period. Easy going, friendly and a pleasure to be around. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. Awesome location though! We sat outside and I love their patio section. The set up is neat and they allow dogs! We were pretty low maintenance on this visit but our service was still really good. 
My boyfriend had the cheeseburger & fries, which he said was delicious. I didn't try his burger but the fries were veryyy good. I ordered the chicken nachos on this particular visit. The nachos were overall, meh. I love a good plate of nachos so I was somewhat disappointed. They do have a great drink selection, which was a plus. If half stars were an option I would say overall 3.5 rating. We'll definitely go back, but I'll be trying something else for my meal."}
{"text":"The back patio is nice. Lots of tv's, tables, and corn hole.
Sandwiches were good, decent portion size.
Friendly staff. 
Beer specials.
Will probably go back when back up in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Worst food I have had in a very long time. Ordered chicken sandwich and chicken was either cooked in a microwave or prepped day before and cooked again in microwave. I couldn't bite through it. When I took my first bite of cole slaw I didn't even chew since it was so spoiled. Waitress saw me spit it out and immediately cleared and got the manager. 

Wait staff and Manager were great and I advised them to get a new job since there was no wait at 7pm on a Saturday. Go to cow fish and wait two hours. 

Brazzwells kicked me while I was in town on a layover after driving home 16 hrs after a great vacation. Stay away!"}
{"text":"I go to Brazwells a lot on Montford, for lunch pick ups or after work happy hours but today experienced unusually poor service. I ordered food online, got there to pick it up and joined the 3 other people waiting at the bar for to go orders. The lady behind the bar, Tammy I believe her name is, is never friendly but this time came across more rude than normal. I usually don't mind when the bar is full, but since there were only 3 people sitting there, I'm not sure why it took her 3 or 4 minutes to even come over and acknowledge I was there, just have a snotty reply when I told her I was there to pick up food. The to go is usually slow, so I know to wait before I drive over, but today I waiting 35 minutes for wings. That SO slow, especially considering there were only 2 table inside. There was no addressing the fact I'd be standing there for 15 minutes when she finally did come out, just a \"here\" and a bag shoved at me. A \"sorry it took so long\" with a smile wouldn't have killed her. On top of that, I watched the other staff sitting in the back eating food in the doorway for 5 minutes before mine was brought out. If I hadn't have paid online already, I would have walked out. I worked in food service for 5 years and am well aware that some kitchens are slower than others, however, with no one in there today there was really no excuse. The customer service from this bartender every time I'm there is always poor and has really made me dread having to go in and pick up orders even though I love Brazwells food! Thinking lunches there might be over for me, you can't be slow AND rude!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Hands down best place in Charlotte. Great food, great atmosphere and the staff is the best! John the manager is the nicest guy in the world! I will be back every day for the rest of my life!"}
{"text":"Honestly the most rude place I have ever ate. We decided to sit here and eat after a long wait and Good Food. Our server was a ghost and was extremely rude when bothered to get something we constantly had to ask for. Also they literally cleaned our stuff off the table while our personal belongings were still on it to clear it for the night and when we said we still were eating the bouncer said well it sure didn't look like. I will never step foot in this place again."}
{"text":"Great environment and amazing food! My waitress Kellen was very nice and respectful and was always checking on my table, pleasant experience!!"}
{"text":"Brazwells is simply a great time. I love going there in the summer and hanging out on the back deck. They have good drinks and pretty good bar food. No matter what the night there is always a good amount of people in there. They also have good sports trivia there as well."}
{"text":"Ok Brazwells, you little devil...you suckered me in with your Monday special: 

 Half Price Wings

The setup is pretty cool, a few booths, tables and chairs and tons of tvs behind the bar.  The location is small and like the previous reviews have mentioned parking is a bit of a challenge.

You order wings by the pound which I think is awesome! I was pleased that they had such a good variety of flavors outside of just the usual Hot and Mild. They also had  Lemon Pepper, Garlic Parmesan, Spicy Teriyaki, Buffalo Cajun Ranch and Sriracha just to name a few. I went with the Lemon Pepper and Spicy Teriyaki. My favorite hands down were the Lemon Pepper. They were hot and juicy with just the right amount of flavor and kick. 

My main issue is the service. It's spotty at best. We spent a good amount of time waiting for our waitress or looking for her (which I hate). But the wings will bring me back. Let's just hope I can score a good parking space and booth!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a work lunch with some coworkers.  Food is typical bar/pub style food with some Southern influences.  They have daily specials for lunch and drinks specials for after work.  Food quality here was decent and everything was pretty tasty.  Our server was pretty friendly but everyone else there was not too friendly -- seemed like they were being forced to work there, really killed the experience.

Will look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Finally, wow! The Pressbox got a much needed facelift!  Brazwell's is a clean and modern looking pub.  It was packed on Saturday night both inside and out on the patio with a very fun crowd.  The new food menu looks great with plenty of things to try.  

We went back for lunch and I had a bbq chicken sandwich that was just so-so.  But their fish sandwich was great, lightly battered and cooked perfectly.  I hear they have a fish and chips dinner special on Fridays. So I'll definitely be back for that."}
{"text":"This is the spot for watching games or chillin on the patio with friends. Alex is the best server!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Australia when I stumbled upon Brazwells and have to say I am glad I did. A wonderful experience, both dining and from a hospitality perspective. Started with the fried pickles (a totally foreign and new concept to me) and have to say pleasantly surprised. Continued with the buffalo chicken salad, which was very tasty and filling and of course topped it off with a few beers. The waitress (Gina) was outstanding - efficient, ultra-friendly, sociable and overall pleasant to be around. No request was too hard or not done in a timely manner. A real asset to your establishment. Sat on the big patio out back which really topped the day off. I will definitely be back next time I am in the US."}
{"text":"Meh- just your very underwhelming hangout in Charlotte. I give them props for the patio and the $4 Bloody Mary bar, as well as decent mimosa prices. The food is very underwhelming and a little high price for what you actually get. What really got me was the service... we waited ten minutes to be greeted, while we were standing right behind an employee with her back to us on her phone the whole time. Just don't really care to give businesses to places where the servers don't care. Nothing horrible at all and I may return solely for the Bloody Mary bar, but otherwise, just plenty of other places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Just stopped here for a drink on a Saturday evening. Sat on the back patio and listened to the sounds of a football game on TV mixing with the birds in the trees above. Kinda strange but fun for me! 

I tasted a cucumber vanilla martini which was pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly based on the one time I have been to Brazwells and considering it was a bachelorette party you may totally disagree with me and that well I can understand.  This bar was a great place to bring 10 heavily intoxicated girls - the weather was beautiful the back patio was awesome - and with the amount of men around drinks were plentiful.  I look forward to coming back at another time to really check this place out!"}
{"text":"Three words: Bloody Mary bar. They literally don't skimp on the liquor and have the best options to make the best Bloody Mary. It is a bit cramped and I wish they had more seating but food is always worth the claustrophobia"}
{"text":"Love coming here!  Always great service and food!  We usually come here during the week.  The buffalo chicken salad is amazing as well as the buffalo chicken wrap.  Sundays are 1/2 price wings too!"}
{"text":"Although it is a bar setting, the burger I got with Pimento cheese was amazing. The fries were good and the ranch (if I remember correctly) is thin and so yummy. The service was okay, our server looked lost most of the time and walked away before we could finish asking her for everything we felt we needed, such as extra napkins, refills, etc which made her look like she was running around. Over all, this place is a solid three stars."}
{"text":"Brazwell's and there staff there were really cool.  Nice big patio out back, lots off beers on tap, staff always there to check up on ya.

And a must in any decent bar in NC, AIR CONDITIONED!!!!  Ahhhhhh!

Tasty snacks - the manager found out we were from out of town and brought us a sampler of the local favorite - fried pickles.  Thanks man, but I'll stick with your awesome nachos and New Belgium beers on tap."}
{"text":"Horrible. 5 in our party. Waitress wouldn't take all of our orders at the same time and disappeared after taking each individual order. Went to the front to get a drink, waitress with glasses was very rude. I asked for manager and she laughed and said she had no idea where he was. Never again!"}
{"text":"I went to Braswell's today for lunch had the best service ever from the bartender Tammy she is a sweetheart! I definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Great food and excellent service. I just had their watermelon salad w/ arugula - truly delicious, fresh, and filling.  EXCELLENT"}
{"text":"Since I work right beside Montford this is in my weekly rotation of lunch spots. The food is great, service is friendly, and the back patio is awesome.

Always end up ordering a beer and the Western Burger. Never disappointed! 

Haven't been here for dinner, but I hear it gets quite busy."}
{"text":"I never had the food here, but usually stop by for a few drinks. In the summer this place is always packed.   During the winter its a lot slower with a mix of people from young to over 50.  Sometimes the place makes you feel like you should have dressed up, but other times I feel like crusty sweatpants and stained wife beater is acceptable attire.  This is the reason I have given this place 3 stars as opposed to 4.   It seems a little lack luster in the inside and its not really defined what type of bar this is."}
{"text":"This is my wife's account: I went here with her because she said it was a popular spot. A girl came in trying to terry tate me because I was in her path. I didn't jump out of the way so she pushed me into a bouncer. 

Unintentionally, I step on his foot. Another bouncer joined him to start something. I get it, they deal with a lot unruly drunk people,  but I tried to apologize to the guy. He continued to carry on to save his ego. I left, and will never go back."}
{"text":"What the is the point of having a phone number if nobody answers it??   I called on my way here twice, and called while I was sitting at the bar and I dont hear a ringer. 

I just wanted to call in a late night food order so I didn't have to wait for it."}
{"text":"Okay, let's get real and to point.  The service is not amazing at Brazwells and the food is your typical bar food, nothing more; however, the outdoor patio is your numero uno reason to hit up Brazwells.  Your could be eating a turkey sandwich on stale bread and manage to have an enjoyable evening from that patio.  

Here's my advice when you go to Brazwells: lower your expectations for timeliness and service.  Our waitress was nice, but beyond ditzy and I could see other waitresses just standing around, which led me to believe this is the norm.  That being said, the food is not bad.  Go outside, order a beer, watch the game on one of their many TV's and just enjoy the evening."}
{"text":"I have only come here at night so I only know how the nightlife is, no idea what the food is like. 

The back patio is really nice on summer nights, it does get packed so if you want to get a table I suggest coming early. They have the usual drinks and there are a few bars in the restaurant. One side and 2 outside so it is pretty easy to get drinks. They play great music and they have TVs outside so you can catch any game you want. 

The service has been great both times I went. 

I would definitely suggest this place to come when you want a simi-chill night with friends!"}
{"text":"I had some pretty terrible experiences here in the past for the night life scene. However it's a great place to watch football on Sunday with the Bloody Mary bar! Food is pretty typical for bar food but the atmosphere is fun and the back porch is always fun!"}
{"text":"It's a bar. There are tons of TVs to watch games and bar food to fill your belly. Service and prices are both on par. Nothing to rave about in either way."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, a little loud for my preference, but no louder than any other venue on the street. We had tuna app, buffalo chicken wrap, and Cobb salad. All were delicious and served in a timely manner. I would go back, for both a bar scene and dinner."}
{"text":"Pretty good chill out spot on Montford. Never had the food, but the bartenders are usually pretty good, moderately priced drinks, inside can get crowded at times, especially on the weekends. Only thing I don't like is the DJ, THE DJ HERE IS TERRIBLE, please for the love of god do not play 'the thong song' its dead let it die. The music is turned up way too loud for a bar like that and he just plays your stereotypical early 2000s party mix. I know people don't come here for the music, but please at least try and provide our ears with something decent."}
{"text":"It take a lot for me to really go off on a place.  A LOT.  But Brazewells has earned my displeasure.  

Let me start with at least one positive.  Kelly, behind the bar, is awesome.  She's friendly and knows her stuff.  And that, my fellow yelpers, is where the redeeming qualities end.

Rarely have I been where the waitstaff was so clueless and uncaring.  \"May I see a wine list?\".. \"Oh, uhh.. well, we don't really have one right now... sorry.\"  *crickets*  Are you kidding me?  if I had been here once and heard this, I probably wouldn't mention it, but over a 3-4 month period, I heard this more than once.  My other major complaint is that many of the servers are just rude.  I'll grant, however, that if I had to put up with the usual crowd they draw, I may be, too.  

After visiting this place on a Saturday night, I knew it'd be my last visit.  The back patio was WAY overcrowded and packed with self-absorbed douches.  Rudeness gets elevated almost to an art form back there.  Beware, they also allow smoking back there.  Just.. eww!  As we were trying to leave, I had people actually refuse to move so that I could step down off the patio.  Seriously??  Why are there bouncers here?  All they did was watch as I struggled to navigate the insanity.

Skip this drunk and douche infested place and walk across the street to Ten Park Lanes, instead.  You deserve better."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. Not to mention I was able to get it with a side of yummy brussel sprouts. Happened to come on a Tuesday and got to enjoy trivia night. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere! Service is good, would definitely recommend. Plenty of specials every day of the week. My roommate and I went on a Monday and really enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Don't hate me, but I'd say 3.5, if possible.  However, if I'm on Montford on any given weekend, I stop by so I rounded to 4!  Brazwells offers both liquor and food, as well as an indoor and outdoor venue.  The menu is pretty much your standard bar fare, but can do the trick in a pinch.  The scene on Friday and Saturday nights is pretty packed.  In fact, if you're a lady, be prepared to wait for one of two (female, unisex) individual bathrooms.  I like that Brazwells offers a DJ on the weekends but the dancing space is quite limited - you need to be prepared to bring your own party but it is manageable!  What I love about Brazwells is the outside patio.  It has it's own bar, and plenty of flat screen TV's.  Also, in the colder weather there are fire pits that help to warm you up!  The biggest downside is the wait time for drinks on the weekends.  I've had to wait as long as 25 minutes to be served - standing right at the bar.  Again, it is a give and take - good crowd but not always the most efficient bar.  

I'll be back in the future, and I suggest you try it out for yourself.  Most people love it or hate it - roll the dice :)"}
{"text":"Seriously the slowest service you could ever have. ...  If you enjoy waiting 25 minutes for 4 beers and 45 minutes for a couple of wings on a slow afternoon; this place is perfect.  The food and specials are great BUT the attitude and personality of the waitresses brings the place down sooo much. If I could do a half star I would \"/."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a buddy. I ordered their version of a Chicken Philly - pretty standard - it was sub par along with the steamed broccoli (raw). If you don't know how to steam broccoli or prepare a chicken Philly acceptably - why are you in the food business? We waited approx 20 minutes for a burger (buddy ordered burger and green beans side) and I, a chicken Philly. Not only did we wait too long, the food was barely edible, AND there is a dollar up-charge to get something other than fries - so my broccoli and my buddy's green beans - a dollar extra for barely prepared sides. You soooooo deserve this rating Braswell's. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years. Always a good time and great atmosphere. Just got the best waitress Kayle! She steps it up! Awesome service, good food, good music, and good people."}
{"text":"My friend recommended me this place and we went after dinner for a few drinks. It was a Tuesday night so it was slow, low key and actually perfect for us.

We sat down and ordered some beers and our server was nice but every time she came to the table to ask if we were ok it seemed she changed her mood... happy, mad, happy, sad.... it was weird but she was easy to find most of the time to get more drinks.

A few of our other friends stopped by and we had a good time and ordered some shots. They were great and we got them right away. There's TVs everywhere and the atmosphere is really nice. I will say that I did not care for the fact that they have single stall bathrooms so when there's a crowd you'll have to wait forever for the bathroom.

Overall its a really cool place and I hear they have great specials."}
{"text":"I'm just gonna make it short this time and say love drinking here, do not love eating here. Great outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"Loved the $5 hamburger special on Monday night, unfortunately I asked for medium-rare and got well-done. Other times the food was good, casual atmosphere. Meets our expectations."}
{"text":"By far the best Bloody Mary bar, I have been to in Charlotte!!!! A group of girls and I try a different place once a month for brunch. Only one of us got\" brunch food\", but she loved it. The others got wings, for football. The bloody mary bar made everything worth well....."}
{"text":"Came here with my mother during one of my trips to Charlotte, and to say the least, was extremely pleased.  We came in for a late lunch so it wasn't very crowded.  Probably due to it being Saint Patrick's Day weekend.  We both ordered the Pimento Cheese Burger; it was phenomenal.

The wait staff was super friendly and attentive.  I will definitely be returning on the future.

I do wish the bathrooms were a bit bigger though... Parking is a hassle.  The parking lot is super small and you can't park across the street at the bowling alley or your car will get towed.

 That's why only four stars."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and outdoor patio seating!  Great drink specials!  Try the pimento cheese burger, it rocks!!  Parking can be an issue."}
{"text":"Tends to be overcrowded on the weekends and the use of space is horrible. Trying to move from inside to outside is more intimate than it should be.
Once the DJ starts cranking at night, you can't hear the person next you inside.
It is a great spot if you can get a table on the deck but other than it being on Montford, there is nothing really appealing about this place over any other bar outside of Uptown.
I've never had the food, drink prices seem to be average.
Can sometimes make for some interesting people watching with the various crowds it attracts."}
{"text":"Every time I turn around, Charlotte surprises me with another gem; this place is cool!!  Def a bar atmosphere, but they have a really awesome patio.  Great food & even better beer selection; I love how they list their top-shelf booze!"}
{"text":"Came by right at opening for Saturday brunch. Our party of 4 was seated on the patio. Our waitress was friendly but as the patio quickly filled up she seemed a little flustered trying to take care of most of the tables. Which was odd as when I walked through the restaurant to go to the restroom I saw a couple groups of employees lounging and hanging out. The slow service was fine as I like to take my time during brunch. The brunch drink specials are out of this world. $4 Bloody Mary bar and $2 mimosas, I ordered one of each and both were great. My husband ordered the french toast with grits and I ordered the salmon BLT. My sandwich was great, the salmon was well cooked and I loved the arugula and aioli, it was very tasty. Hub's grits were out of this world, maybe the best I've ever had. The other couple we were with got an omelette and the chicken and waffles and they both loved the food. 5 stars on the food and 3 for the staff. Will definitely be back for another lovely morning on the patio."}
{"text":"This bar/restaurant is located on popular Montford Drive so be aware that it can be crowded and parking can be difficult.  It's not far if you have to park across the street but some people have a problem with that so be aware.  I've been here a few times and sat inside and outside.  When the weather is nice, the back patio is the way to go.  The service has been hit or miss for me.  The food is really nothing special but it's not bad.  They have daily drink specials and a Bloody Mary bar on the weekends where you build your own drink. The wait staff is very friendly and helpful even though our waitress did disappear for a long time this past weekend.  I've tried something different every time I've been here and nothing has really been that wonderful.  We had the chicken pita with pub chips and the salmon BLT with pub chips.  Chicken pita was dry and the chicken seemed chewy/over cooked.  The pub chips with some ranch dressing were delicious.  Be advised that they charge you for a side of ranch dressing.  I'm never a fan of places that do that. It should at least be disclosed to you. The salmon BLT came out with out the bacon but they quickly corrected it when it was brought to their attention. 
I would say it's a decent place but it's not special. I will continue to come here to try food and to enjoy the beautiful patio. They have large TVs on the patio so it would be a great place to catch a game."}
{"text":"They only get one star and that's for the staff. Everything was awful. It took about 20 mins to get our food and when we did it was barely warm, the fries were cold and soggy and they charged extra for a side of honey mustard. Like pretty much place on Montford, the parking sucks."}
{"text":"Time went: 10:30am-ish

Crowd: Bar people ready to drink and dance at the mini-dance floor

Music: mix of house, 80's/90's, and more current hip-hop (thank god!)

Seating area preferred: Outside front patio by the cool looking obelisk silver heater!

Overall feel: Love it! Good drinks, nice hang out place with friends, great music to listen to, I finally found a place that is close by, don't have to go to the Epicentre, and plays hip-hop. I miss dancing, and this place is a great place the get your groove on.

If I get tired of the place, or need a change of scenery, head over to Andrew Blair's for more dancing.. Or Angry Ales for more drinks and relax :)"}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place. There ahi tuna is amazing and so are there salads and burgers. This has become my husband and my fall back bar. They were nice enough to change one of the t.v.'s for us so we could watch our mac conference team play. 

There chicken wings are also amazing but beware of the chicken fingers. They suck. Over all it's a great atmosphere during the week it's nice and chill. The weekends it get crowded."}
{"text":"Last night was an off night with time however the place is so consistent it did not bother us. Just wanted to point out when the food is always good and the service is always good a bad night keeps loyal customers coming back. Overall highly recommend this place. Great food, great prices and great specials. If you have had a bad experience there it's rare give it another try!

Well can't take up for them anymore just keeps getting worse 4-24-16"}
{"text":"Brazwell's is hard to beat for an everyday occasion for hanging out with friends or acquaintances.  Their patio is GINORMOUS and it's a hot spot for young 20- and 30-somethings as well as a neighborhood watering hole for some of the older crowd.  The crowd reflects the staff--cool and laid back which is a welcome breath of fresh air from spots around town that try to be something they're not.  

Brazwells is the kind of place you could meet up with anybody from a first date to your roommate's crazy Uncle Ed visiting the big city for the first time.  Some call it the Whiskey Warehouse of Montford (same owners).

Sandwiches, salads and meatloaf aren't supposed to be this good at a sports bar.  The prime rib sandwich and sweet salmon salad are excellent.  The wings are average, but still good.  The atmosphere is the best part about this place, the more I go the more I enjoy it.  

There's a lot of variety from during the week (don't be surprised if it's packed on a random Tuesday or Wednesday), during the day on the weekend and on Thu/Fri/Sat nights when it's typically standing room only.  

Oh, and don't forget half priced wine bottle Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"The place looks like a nicer level of sports bar. The service and food were good. The noise level was high as there was a game one the many televisions and a lot of chatter."}
{"text":"Moldy air with beer that tastes like the tubing has not been changed in a while. After not getting service at a table, one of the bartenders was nice tho."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome atmosphere! My girlfriends and I came here for the first time on a Friday. We ordered the spinach dip which was delicious and $3 Sangrias! They do not cut corners on their sangrias - we were wine drunk by the end of the night lol. Each of us ordered something different. I ordered the Smokehouse burger with sweet potato fries. Aaah! So damn good! The fries have a brown sugar/cinnamon sprinkle on it which gives it a wonderful sweet taste. The burger was over cooked than what I originally asked (well done vs. medium well) but it was still good and juicy."}
{"text":"Great service at brazwells today. Bartender Tammy was wonderful. She serviced our whole party better than anyone ever has. Be sure to try Jaunita's special bean dip! 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Staff was rude, only had 2 beers then decided to go somewhere else and heard the Bartender talking loudly to her other coworker about the \"big 2 dollar tip\" she was going to get from us. Food menu looked decent and wasn't that packed for a football Sunday which is a plus. One thing that stuck with me even after the bartender with the attitude was that we didn't get a warm welcome when you walk through the door."}
{"text":"One Of My Favorite Bars.  Great Drink Specials And Good Food!  Definitley A Great Value For Your Dollar.  Staff Is Friendly And Usually A Pretty Good Crowd Dor Socializing."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last week.  Great patio.  As far as food, only had nachos.  Wow I cant believe restaurants use cheese wiz.  Come on lets use some real cheese please !"}
{"text":"Met some friends there on a Sunday during football playoff season. Since we weren't there to watch the games, the place was too loud for my taste. The lady at the table next to me, who screamed profanity every time a play happened during the game, leads me to believe this may not be the place to bring children. However, I was impressed with all their screens and would consider going back during college football season to enjoy a game there. I'd also like to try hanging out on their patio during the warmer months.

Our server was pretty good, despite being very busy.

Wine prices seemed high for this type of pub, so I opted for a sangria, since I wasn't in the mood for a beer.

The chicken dumpling soup was good, and my fellow diner raved it reminded him of his grandmother's soup.

However, I was extremely disappointed in my pear salad. The menu said it was served on mixed greens, but all I got was some tasteless iceberg lettuce. I should have spoken up at the time and questioned my order, but I didn't, so in Brazwell's defense, I didn't give them the opportunity to correct this blatant error.

I will give them another shot, and look forward to providing an updated review at that time."}
{"text":"Since my usual watering hole is closed on Mondays, I was looking for something new and someone recommended Brazwell's.  

The first problem with any business on Montford is the parking situation but I lucked out here and found the last space in their lot.  

Inside, I wasn't really greeted.  There were two girls standing at the hostess booth chatting away.  Finally they just looked at me like \"How dare you interrupt us\" and I mentioned I'd just go to the bar.

This place reminds me of a Cheers-type place with lots of dark woods, some brick and then TV's galore around the inside.  Unlike my experience at the front door, my experience at the bar was quite different.  The bartender was friendly and helpful with the menu and the beer selection.  My usual disappointment came with craft beer.....OMB is the only local beer represented here but I branched out of my comfort zone a little with other craft beer options.

The bartender also pointed out that before 6pm is 1/.2 price appetizers and wings.  Wings are by the pound with 8 wings per pound.  I went with 2 lbs of wings with a Buffalo cajun ranch sauce and something called Barbalo which is a barbecue/buffalo mixture.  

The wings were big and juicy and lightly covered is sauce, just the way I like them.  Unfortunately, they missed the mark on spice level.  But there's plenty of other menu options to explore on this menu.  

Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the bartender.  I would give the place another shot."}
{"text":"Me and my friend came here on st. Patrick's day. I have serious issues with the waiter service at this place. We ordered drinks and two appetizers. Mozzarella sticks and nachos, both were $8.99. There were only like 6 mozzarella sticks for my order but the nachos came in a huge plate? I feel like I was getting a pretty good deal for the nachos(but after all they are just chips and some shredded cheese and diced tomato, shouldn't cost much to begin with). While on the other hand, I was paying like $1.50 per moz stick, wow those are some expensive cheese sucks I tell you. Neither of the appetizers were super wow amazing, I can give my moz sticks a 4/5 and the nachos 3.5/5. 
It was a Saturday so we both also ordered mimosas, mimosas are one of the Saturday special drinks, only $2 each!! That's pretty darn cheap, though it comes in a tiny tiny narrow champagne glass. The mimosas are ok, 3.5/5. 
My biggest problem is that when we walked in to the bar, no one approached us, we had to fetch for our own table, eventually we couldn't find a table so we sat at the bar. When we wanted to order our drinks, there were waiters standing around and we definitely looked like we were ready to order but no one approached is still. By then I was pretty pissed and was ready to leave but I decided to give it one last try, I approached one of the girls and finally placed my order. When I asked to have a cup of water on top of my order she looked irritated and went back scooped the ice and just handed me my water. When we were day to pay no one approached us still, the whole time we were just left there, I almost did not leave a tip."}
{"text":"I'd never been here before and my sweetie & I decided to try it for lunch.  I  was really glad we did.

I didn't see the inside of Brazwell's as we went straight to the patio.  It's lovely, quietly populated (during Memorial Day Monday lunch) & well-shaded!  

They have a great outdoor bar area & lots of seating.  Lots of good TV's on patio which is nice for various sporting shows.

The menu was varied and was much better than standard bar fare.  We tried the wings (a lb is about 8 wings) which were ok.  I like others better, but these weren't bad.  I had the salmon salad which was really good.  Not necessarily the freshest, but cooked really well and tasty.

The chicken sandwich was very juicy & tasty.  Skins on fries aren't my favorite.  They're saved a bit by being skinny ones.  They could save them a bit more if they crisped them up a bit more.

All in all...above average food for a good sports bar.  Servers were experienced, which is a plus.

I'd go again."}
{"text":"I usually stop in here to watch part of a game or grab a drink with friends.  I've never had any of there food but what I have seen come out of the kitchen always looked pretty good.

They have lots of TVs and a bar out back and a huge deck that's great in the summer.  They also have daily drink specials and the Miller High Lifes are always $2....woo hoo!"}
{"text":"Service always seems slow when we are here to eat. Usually on Saturdays they offer $2 mimosas. Wings are good and huge. My fiancé loves the Bloody Mary bar on Sunday's. One time me and my fiancé came with 2 of his friends. I'm Asian and he's white. One of his friends is white and the other was Asian. We sat at a high top table at the bar. I was sitting next to my fiancé and his white friend with his Asian friend across from me. The female bartender asked if we were ready for the checks but didn't ask how they were split. I guess since she assumed I was Asian, I was with the Asian guy even though I wasn't sitting next to him. She put our checks together and my fiancé and his friend separate. Really? That's pretty rude and ignorant. When my fiancé told her we were on one check she just said \"oh\" without apologizing."}
{"text":"Was invited to Brazwells to watch a match of the World Cup.  The atmosphere is really great.  if you're looking for an intimate (as in smaller and can get loud) place to watch sports, this is the place.  Lot's of screens, seats are comfortable for an hour+ of seating, and the food is pretty good.  I didn't have anything to drink because of the hour but I did have the nachos which were incredible.  It was enough to hold three of us over for lunch.  

Yeah, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Well, heard good things but the female staff are in 'leggings as pants' which any woman knows are not pants...tacky and cheap. Decided not to order food...Wine list is for those who don't know wine. Popular Malbec from a few years ago...figured that was their best option. Will go next door to eat. And yes my wine glass was not clean... Ewww. Cheap and nasty."}
{"text":"Anywhere with a bloody mary bar wins in my book. 

It's never a destination spot when someone asks where should we do lunch/dinner. But if someone says where should we watch the game/day drink/Sunday funday, this always comes up in the mix. I end up here the most during football season. My best friend is an Iowa fan, so when his game and my Huskers don't conflict, I end up here at the Hawkeye bar on Saturdays. 

The menu pretty much covers it all. Different blue plate specials each week day. They do a special pork tenderloin type sandwich for Iowa game days. It's what I always get. Other than that, I don't really have a go to here. Zucchini fries, burgers, wings- it's all perfectly fine. 

There are different specials every day. Of note: Tuesdays- Kids Eat Free & Half priced Wine Night (I mean, you'll probably need a glass or four to deal with the kids, right? JK, JK), Wednesdays- $3.50 drafts, Saturdays and Sundays- $2 Mimosas and $4 Bloody Mary Bar.

Fantastic patio and TVs galore. It's Montford, so you can expect it to get pretty fratty. Parking is not great in this entire area. Do yourself a favor and call an Uber if you're partaking in adult bevvies."}
{"text":"I love coming here.. The food is always good and the beer is always cold but... I have to agree with Lyn B.. The wait staff is horrible. The girls look irritated when they wait on you and it takes them forever to come over to take your drink order and food order. I used to be a waitress and there is no excuse for bad service."}
{"text":"This is a very cool, hip place to grab a bite or drink. People are friendly and wait staff was great. 
Parking lot is small so that was a pain. 
Prices are reasonable. 

I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and it was bad. That's the only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars. It was mostly bun and lettuce and the chicken itself wasn't that great. The French fries were awesome though. 

And the scenery was amazing..."}
{"text":"Love Brazwells Sunday brunch! We come here every week we are in town for the great food and drink specials. Emma is a wonderful waitress who is always very helpful and accommodating! Highly recommend Brazwells on Sunday's."}
{"text":"What a great location to watch soccer or hang out with friends on their patio.
It is a smoke-friendly patio, drinks are good and the staff is friendly. Their restrooms are clean and the location has plenty of seats. I hear they also have live music on the weekend. I have not been there for that but I will have to try it out soon.
The location is def. amazing and sitting out on the patio on the weekend is super relaxing."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place and a staple when you're going for drinks on Montford.  Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Lots of young 20-something's hanging out there on a Wednesday night so if you are in hat age bracket, the. You should have a good time.  Looked like there were a lot of Affliction-wearing dudes but not sure. Definitely gave that vibe. 

Awkward because birthday girl wanted Stella and they had it but had to go to the bar to get it, wouldn't serve it up which is meh.  If you want Stella and want to sit outside, I wouldnt come here.  Other than that, solid.

dmo out"}
{"text":"This is my football destination on Sunday's. Awesome Bloody Mary bar and drink specials daily. Great bar food that adds brunch items for the weekend and daily specials that are awesome. Hands down the best and hottest staff in Charlotte. A must for any sports fan. Multiple bars and plenty of outside seating as well."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but the service was subpar. We had a group of 18 people and it took over an hour to get our food orders. Then when we were ready to leave it took over 40 minutes to get our checks. The checks came out wrong and the MOD was full of excuses. The waitress was great but she needed some help. Her manager wasn't great at backing her up. Because we took so long to get serviced another groups time was pushed back."}
{"text":"The food at Brazwells is always good and extremely consistent. The service on the other hand is spotty. The girls are always chatting with one another or busy flirting with the patrons. I do love coming and sitting outside for brunch on the weekends but just be ready to wait 10-15 before someone comes and brings you water and takes your drink order. I will be back (probably this weekend) but this is one of those restaurants where patience is a virtue but worth it for the food, drink specials and patio atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is an ok stop for a quick drink while waiting for a table at Good Food.  It's a bar...bar bar. So the atmosphere is that of a bar.  Haha! If that makes sense.  They have drink specials on different days, which is nice to see.  Weekend mimosa and Bloody Mary specials are definitely worth checking out!

The staff is overall friendly, can sometimes be a hit or miss.  The place does get really busy at times. 

Food is very bar-like, nothing really out of the ordinary.  Never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for happy hours. Good price and good portion.  The service might be a hit or miss."}
{"text":"Great place...was here Saturday evening(9/10), outside bartender was awesome. Service was the best I've ever had. Definitely going to go back!"}
{"text":"Brazwells is a great bar.  I am not sure how the food is as I have never eaten here.  Maybe I will never eat here as I do not want to ruin my great pub-ish experience.  

Atmosphere - Good mix of 20, 30, and 40 somethings, a college kid to business man crowd, clean, restaurant-y inside, nice deck area in back, pub-ish

Drinks - I never really noticed that they mix a decent drink here (in the main bar area) until recently someone with me mentioned that the Capt & Cokes here are mixed well.  The quality of their mixologist became more noticeable after we left and went to Angry Ale's and then Andrew Blairs (well, Adrew's more for pricing)  You would think that as the night progressed it would become less noticeable as to how the drinks tasted, which means the other places must serve some really lousy drinks.   

Price - Cap & Coke...tall...not a double...$6

Overall - I always have a good time here and the atmosphere, while crowded is good.  Plus the drinks are in nice glasses of well (no pun intenede) mixed goodness."}
{"text":"I have heard this is a good place to go drink at night on the weekends.... Well keep it that way!!
Me and some girlfriends went out there to get a quick lunch and we had the worst experience. The waitress was the worst! It was pretty slow and It took forever for us to get menus, took 30min before she took our order, she gave us an open half empty bottle of wine and the list goes on.... Hopefully it was just the bad waitress our visit was so unpleasant."}
{"text":"I went here for a Friday lunch break from work and was pleasantly surprised.  We sat out of the back porch that was conveniently placed under two huge oak trees that keeps you cool and in the shade.  They have a huge patio area with a section for cornhole.  The service was a little slow but the food was worth the wait.  I got the blackened grill chicken sandwich and it was excellent.  I swear the fries were stolen from Five Guys and they were delicious.  Inside was a little touristy but had a solid comfy feeling.  I wonder what the night life atmosphere is like..  Enjoy!

{"text":"I have to admit this is a pretty chill place. We came here not really knowing what to expect but it's really hipster and reminds me of other places we like to go. It was a cloudy day and it started to rain outside, people who were eating kind of just got stuck out there, I'm sure that sucked. We ordered a round of shots and it came in little plastic cups, I guess it's more efficient, just seemed a little off putting. I can see this place getting crowded fast. But, I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Salmon BLT is on point. Patio is great. Service is something to be desired, so don't go if you're in a hurry. Sunday brunch is a good place to start. Can be filled with the hipster-millennial types but that's what Montford has turned in to. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Got to experience this place as we decided to come here for a drink while we waited on our table at Good Food. I'm less than pleased with the service. Our waitress was fine at first but when the rest of our party arrived it was a sudden attitude change. We opted to sit on the patio since we were just going to stay for drinks. When we decided to stay for dinner the service completely went down hill. Our waitress would ask if we needed anything and before we could even get a chance to respond she responded, \"no, okay good\" and walk off. We all looked around at each other because a majority of us either had a question or needed something. As for my meal, I ordered the veggie wrap with a side of veggies. The waitress said, \"You realize the veggies on the side are the same in the wrap? I figured this was the case but didn't expect the attitude so I responded, \"I figured, lets doubt that veggie intake.\" We got our meals, but not all at the same time. 2 of the people in our group did not receive their meal with everyone else and ended up waiting at least 10-15 mins later. The price for meal was fine, but the service really killed the experience. My only advice for anyone coming here, don't sit in Alana's section. I really hope she was just having an off night and that's not her normal attitude. Two stars were absolutely for the food and price."}
{"text":"The name says it!  This place really has a pub atmosphere but premium food.  I love coming here late night for the more booze oriented pub feel on the huge outdoor deck.   Just came in for dinner before the night crowd blew up and ordered a blackened salmon.  It was prepared perfectly.  The rice was lacking but the veggies were cooked very well.  The staff was very welcoming and Kelly behind the bar was awesome.  This just became my favorite place on Montford in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the bar!  There is a ton of eye candy walking around with their mugs of beer, and is surprisingly gay-friendly.  A group of us guys went to enjoy a few drinks after dinner, and were pleasantly surprised at the chill atmosphere and wide menu of drinks!! Being a cocktail drinker and not so much of a beer person, I was skeptical at the quality of cocktail a man-bar may create.  However, when I ordered, the waitress said that my drink was REALLY good and her favorite but the bartenders hated making it because all the girls who came in ordered it. Haha.  I knew this was the drink for me after that remark!   And, it arrived in all it's Strawberry Sangria glory and was DELICIOUS!!   The boys with me enjoyed their brews and a great time was had by all. There were plenty of TVs to watch sporting events, if that was something we were interested in.  Great time, great bar, great night!"}
{"text":"Cool bar/atmosphere with a great outdoor deck.  Food is ok, not great."}
{"text":"They have the best red bull specials on Monday night. Sung is the coolest person up there, well Trevor kinda cool too. Ok I love waffles bye"}
{"text":"I eat lunch here regularly and the food is good.  One of my favorites on their menu is the seared tuna sandwich.  If you like tuna, it's one of the best sandwiches in Charlotte.  I've also had their salads, wings and burgers and they are very good as well.    

I have had the chance to visit it late night yet, but have been after work for a drink or two and it's a very laid back atmosphere!  There is a digital juke box so there is always good music playing in the back round!  The outside patio is also very cool, great place to have a drink when the weather cools down!

On the inside, they have a ton of TVs on the walls to watch any game that may be on."}
{"text":"The lemon pepper wings are the best in Charlotte.   Kelsey is an amazing bartender.  Highly recommended.   J"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here about three times a week, since we live around the corner. We love the atmosphere and most of the staff. We've decided to stop spending our time and money at this establishment due to one of their managers Bryan/ Brian. He is by far the rudest, worst manager in any business we've ever come across. He obliviously lacks the correct training or education to manage in any business, he needs to choose a different occupation. Maybe the owners should help him with that decision or they'll end up losing more customers."}
{"text":"Go here on Sunday if you are hung over enough to need a good Bloody Mary. You'll inevitably feel creepy staring at your waitress' butt, but it's ok, God forgives you.

{"text":"This is in reference to the below link regarding my friends experience. He was pushed into a bouncer by a girl and accidentally stepped on his shoe. She was clearly more intoxicated than my friend and he was probably one of the more sober people in the bar. While we both tried to apologize to the bouncer, he would not even listen to us and was actually pretty aggressive. He made sure to tell us that he didn't care about the girl and how she was acting, but more upset about his shoe. We were there to celebrate a birthday and have a good time, and this has completely ruined our opinion of this place and we will not be coming back.

{"text":"This is one of my favorite Sunday brunch spots.  There is lots of outdoor seating and plenty of TVs, outside and inside, to watch football.  Get there early though because it'll be busy. 

Great drink specials for Sunday brunch, too. They have $4 mimosas and a Bloody Mary bar so you can customize your drink with as many olives, peppers and okra as you want."}
{"text":"Went there last night after work with some friends - true, the patio is AMAZING especially since it was a perfect night. We really enjoyed ourselves (maybe too much on a work night) and our food/drinks as well. 

I ordered the salmon salad.. the salmon was ok - the salad stupid.. I still haven't figured out why Charlotte can't get on the wagon and serve better salads... NO ICEBERG please... but no worries.. I ate it. My bloody mary was de-lish as well. 

Oh and the band was really good!"}
{"text":"Went there Saturday for rivalry weekend around noon..great day on the patio.  Kids played cornhole and threw the football in the parking lot.  Wings are good but get them crispy...fries are very good.  Burgers are awful....think one step down from frozen bubba burgers.

Get the burgers right and it's a 5 star"}
{"text":"I think the experience at Brazwells is pretty consistent. They have a ton of TV's, a big bar area and a full menu. They always have cheap drink specials in addition to the regularly stocked bottles, cans, draft beers, wines and liquors. The service has always been good when I've been there--they seem pretty well adjusted to the large crowds that can pack in on the weekends. Location is great, a fun area with multiple bars and restaurants in the area. 

I've heard the bloody mary bar is awesome, looking forward to checking it out!"}
{"text":"Waitresses are very nice!
And very hot too
My wife and go usually on weekend nights.
We like the tuna and spring roll appetizers the best

They have an updated menus with nice plates, my wife and I also enjoy the Tuesday wine special, and you go around 6:00 you can enjoy happy hour apps"}
{"text":"I give them 2 stars, simply for putting up with my drunk friend wobbling around(Not loud or anything) and not kicking us out. Other than that, this place was a fail. Service was super slow, our waitress forgot to put our order in, then when she did, everything was wrong! Most of our order was pretty much someone else's when it came out because it was so wrong. I was not impressed with my steak. It was explained to be marinated with Teriyaki with island spices and flavors with pineapples. The Steak had no flavor. Maybe they tried to cook it in Teriyaki last minute and the sauce just burned off? I don't know, but it was definitely not marinated as described. I definitely would not return for the food."}
{"text":"This place is perfect. I love coming here the food, the atmosphere, the bartenders are great. One of my favorite weekend spots."}
