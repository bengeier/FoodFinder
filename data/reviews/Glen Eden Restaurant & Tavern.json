{"text":"A great place to eat in North Routt. The portions are generous, the food is tasty, it's cozy as hell, and the main reason to return: the staff. Everyone is great. I'm partial to the Mac and cheese, the brisket sandwich, and many other yummy things here."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a huge disappointment since we had heard that it was remodeled and had new chef and staff. We had a party of 9 and all ordered something different. The prices were unreasonable even for a resort area. Only three of the 9 meals were enjoyed and acceptable. I ordered a Med/rare burger which came out well done and dry with cold French fries. I complained to the waitress who was very curt and unapologetic. The French dip was very bad and also over cooked. We could never recommend the food  or the service and will never go back."}
{"text":"Glen Eden Family Restaurant states that they are 18 miles north of Steamboat on 129 and worth the drive. I have to agree with them, especially if you want to spend the day snow shoeing and have a late lunch afterwards.  Good burgers, salads, steaks, pasta, and seafood in a great environment.  The bartender kept the drinks flowing while bantering with the locals. Glen Eden is a destination resort and most of the customers were staying at the resort and then there was a smattering of locals and active outdoor enthusiasts. The \"cabin\" like dining room offers a cozy respite to warm up and fuel up after a nice tour through the snowy Colorado Mountains."}
