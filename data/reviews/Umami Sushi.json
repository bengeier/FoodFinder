{"text":"It's so hard finding kosher sushi but then I found this place and my life has changed. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Was curious about this shop after walking to What-A-Bagel one day. I stopped by and ordered four salmon nigiri and a six-piece California Roll. The staff was very nice. The order was ready in three minutes. The salmon was very fresh and the rice was sticky enough so as not to fall into the soy sauce. The rolls were also very good. 

The price however is another story. I paid 19 dollars for that and in my opinion, that's kind of expensive given the fact that this is a takeout only place. I've gotten cheaper meals with more rolls and nigiri from other places like VIPS Sushi (Byng,) the World on Yonge Sushi Bong, the other Sushi Bong and Rainbow Sushi right across the street with equal or better quality fish. I guess that one of the reasons for the higher than usual price is due to the fact that the sushi has been certified kosher. 

The selection is also limited although the reason is probably because its kosher. This place is a great place if you're Jewish. You'll get the authentic sushi while conforming to kosher. If you're like me and don't need to restrict your diet, I would take my business to Rainbow across the street on the west side of Bathurst."}
{"text":"Just got sushi from here, it's by far the nicest sushi I have had since arriving in Toronto. The tuna avocado roll was delicious."}
{"text":"Probably the best quality and taste and value for sushi in Toronto. These guys know what they're doing. They're not a store or restaurant or a takeout place that also has sushi, they're sushi themselves. When I have cravings for real sushi, this is the place to go to. That being said, I am a huge fan of those crazy Godzilla and monster and philly cheese bagel and schwarma and Mexican bean sushi rolls, I love variety. Umami is against messing with their menu, which has like 20 specialty rolls but they're all from the same basic 10 ingredients (tuna or salmon, a few other types of fish, fake crab, tempura, carrot, avocado, cucumber, etc. You know, the basics), and I don't blame them, I guess, because why add 100 risky ingredients when what they do works. But not even a deep fryer, come on! But I've spoken to the owner and I have to respect someone who is so passionate about his product that he insists on doing it \"the right way.\" I begrudgingly say fiiine because, hey, it's working for him and if it ain't broke yadda yadda. Great sushi, and great customer service, too."}
{"text":"Excellent world class kosher sushi! They also have some other menu items. Avail from uber eats and other apps as well."}
{"text":"Love the sushi! It is expensive but that's what kosher is! The spicy mayo and sweet sauce is so damn good!!!"}
{"text":"We're routine purchasers of sushi from Umami.  My wife loves the fresh fish and sashimi offerings as well as a couple of the special rolls.  We routinely purchase trays for the entire family. There are a couple of stools to sit at if you really want to eat in, but this is really a take out space.

This is a Kosher Sushi place, meaning that you won't find any shellfish offerings.  What you will find is some interesting pairings of fish, vegetables and fruits combined into roll.  One of the things you'll find is that the chef uses pretty much the freshest ingredients available, with rice that has probably been cooked in the last few hours (think back to your last bad sushi experience and it probably relates to stale rice) and combination of textures and flavours to create unique offerings.  For example, I'm allergic to fish, so for me veggie is the only option for Kosher Sushi, how about seared pineapple and cucumbers in your sushi?  Sounds interesting... how about seared pineapple, avocado and jalapeno peppers?  now we're talking.... 

If you know what you want, then order in advance and pick up, if you don't know what you want, you'll probably have to wait 10 or 15 minutes until you order is ready (but it'll be freshly made).  

There are a number of trays that you can easily purchase or you can have them make something of your own.

We're frequent customers and we would be more frequent if we had more dollars and time."}
