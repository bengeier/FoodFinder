{"text":"Took some friends here for dinner on a Wednesday night in January. Our check seemed unusually high despite having ordered dinner, drinks, wine and desert. Ordinarily I would have just handed over my credit card, but something made me pull out the readers and click on the phone light to take a look.  Found that our server had added items from guests at another table to our bill.  She apologized and removed them, however, coupled with the small portions and meh food (especially the sixteen dollar mac and cheese) I am reluctant to return and sadly sharing my experience with other friends.  With so many other options in Tremont, I would recommend dining elsewhere."}
{"text":"I really hoped I could give Fat Cats more than two stars, but unfortunately, it's not in the cards.  

PROS: Great, cozy atmosphere in a converted old house in a quiet corner of Tremont.  Walking in, the vibe was great and the hostess and waitstaff were nothing but pleasant and attentive.  Things started off well enough and I thought this could be a repeat visit type of place.  However...

CONS: The food.  Ultimately, one still frequents a restaurant for its culinary output (one would assume, at least!), and Fat Cats kitchen offerings didn't complement what had been built up so far.  The olive tapenade they bring out to go with bread, stingily given one slice at a time I might add, is tasty enough, but the bread itself is cold and had probably been baked quite a while earlier.  I ordered the Ohio City burger and found it to be problematic.  The beef was dry, along with the stale-tasting bun.  Speaking of dry, what's with those pieces of pork belly thrown on top of the burger?  I had hoped maybe they were made to order, but it was pretty obvious the kitchen must make a number of them when prepping earlier in the day and just ration them out from a container like they would pickles and other condiments.  Way too chewy and not adding anything good flavor-wise.  The blue cheese slaw tasted off, and the pickles were of the slightly sweet variety, which I can't get down with.  Topping it off, the 'tomato jam' they serve with this is chunky enough that their pommes frites (aka shoestring potatoes) easily bend when you attempt to dip.  I ended up having to pour the jam over the frites and use a fork, which didn't feel right, nor taste especially good.

  On the bright side, my wife enjoyed her goat cheese appetizer and house salad, which leads me to believe Fat Cats strength is maybe in a quiet evening nursing a cocktail and sharing an appetizer.  Too bad, really, but there are still plenty of better options in the city."}
{"text":"Whenever the question \"where should we go to eat?\" Comes up Fat Cats is on the list!  I just wished we lived closer.  The food is always delicious and the service is phenomenal.  If you end up there early (I believe 4-7) you can take advantage of their happy hour - lots of the menu is at a reduced price.  You won't regret a visit."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here at least once a month.  I love that they change their menu; adding items to keep up with the season.  The staff is down-to-earth and friendly.  The atmosphere is charming and cozy (inside an old house).  We love their patio and it is dog-friendly!  
I recommend trying their Cobb salad with Salmon, the Burger, the Shrimp Po Boy, and their Chicken Curry Soup!"}
{"text":"2 1/2 stars. Unfortunately the only thing keeping this from being at least a 4 star review was the service. Sat at a table by the window overlooking downtown which was very nice. However, the two tables that were sat after us were given bread as we were not. Then they were asked if they would like more bread while we sat there with an empty table. The server seemed quite disinterested in our table. The wine was good as were the cocktails and i made sure to tell the bartender so before i left. We had the duck carnitas, pork belly buns & veal sweetbreads. All were excellent. Oddly, after we ordered our apps we told the server that we also planned to order 2 meals and then she paid zero attention to us for 20 minutes. We were not in a hurry but don't be attentive to the other tables around us and then walk right by without checking up on us. We paid our bill to the hostess and then the server came to our table and asked if we paid!! You ask your co-workers if they cashed out a table before you go up to the table and ask them where her money is. That is elementary serving. Wish we sat at the bar, and since we didnt have any entrees we ended up going somewhere else to have the rest of our meal. Bummer because we wanted to try everything."}
{"text":"I called ahead and asked if they provided vegan options or could accommodate our dietary preferences.  I was assured that the server would assist us and the chef would be willing to prepare vegan options.  Our server, Hannah, was fantastic.   She answered our questions and checked with the kitchen to make sure menu selections worked within our parameters.  The food was excellent!   We ordered several appetizers and an entree and all were outstanding.  We are so appreciative when restaurants are willing to accommodate us, and are thrilled when the food and service are so excellent.   We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"How this place survives in an area with so many great places to go is beyond me.   After going up and down the menu five times I finally settled on the burger.   Burger was cooked to medium on the inside and charred to the crisp on the out. Brother got the hangar steak and it was also charred horribly.   Also had to send back the green beans for the same reason. 

Burger was also flavorless and tasted like something I could have made out of my freezer at home.  

Two stars because the staff was nice.   Smell ya later fat cats."}
{"text":"Usually one of my neighborhood go to local spots. I thoroughly appreciate that many of the ingredients are locally sourced...always extra points for that. Unfortunately i didn't enjoy my most recent experience. Sat at the bar for dessert and drinks. Ordered the fat caz coffee... Came ice cold and the Bar tender didn't seem to notice (side eye)... Drinks had to be remade. Then i understood why  my coffee cocktail was cold, as I watched my coffee drink sit there as the bar tender made other drinks. The bar tender was really sweet and apologetic, but i was out done When my ice cream dessert was served with a fork. To their credit it was pretty busy and all of the servers seemed to be working hard. I love this place but was left feeling less than enchanted this time. Decided to go have drinks somewhere else."}
{"text":"So my younger daughter and I were searching for a spot for dinner mid week.  We decided to try out Fat Cats.  It is a bit hidden in Tremont but we had passed by many times.  Big mistake!  I read the reviews on Yelp beforehand and should have listened to the warning signs.  Very little was really said of the food at Fat Cats.  Now I know why!  I had a pizza and salad - both completely tasteless!  My daughter had chicken - which was OK but not worth the cost!  The service was OK!  The waitress failed to mention that there was a Happy Hour menu - which would have meant we would have spent less on mediocre food!  We will not be back as I like to spend my money and calories a bit more wisely!  Too bad!  We really try to support local businesses!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  I love Saturday brunch and dinner there - either way it's a win!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites for years.  Had an amazing dinner tonight and cant wait fo return."}
{"text":"Came here in a large group for lunch. Feels like you're dining in a friend's house. The food was great, we had ordered several small plates out of which I was impressed by the ceviche. The \"its about thyme\" cocktail was pretty tasty. I didn't eat an entree here but everyone seemed pretty satisfied with their meals. The tacos and omelette get special mentions. I gave it a '3' rating since no one was really blown away by the food. The experience was enjoyable overall."}
{"text":"First timers and wishing we lived closer. Loved everything about this place...beers, food, staff and location. Amazing views of downtown Cleveland. The Tremont area is fun and alive and awesome to see having seen it much different 20 years ago!"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time with my work friends. I love this place. I ordered pan fried fish a lot because it was so good, and I was always really happy with the wines I ordered. I have enjoyed all my meals here."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I recently got a dog and since then, we've been on the prowl for dog-friendly restaurants.  Fat Cats turned out to be one of them.  We called ahead and they were happy to accomodate us on their patio.  They greated us with a smile and even gave our dog a treat and had a dog bowl - A+ in my opinion.

As for the human side of the restaurant, we couldn't have been happier.  The service was great, the food was excellent, and the patio was perfect for a late Thursday evening dinner.  We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Had the Walleye and wife had fish tacos, both were very good. Portions are a little on the small side at least the walleye. Also, beware it is a very tiny space! Not for large parties...had a party of 4 and got a table that was uncomfortably close to other tables. All in all good food."}
{"text":"Quirky place that has a very cozy feel. Came here with a group of friends on a Saturday night. Good service overall. Every menu item we got was great. The Brussels sprout appetizer was amazing. I had the cashew crusted tofu which I was leery about ordering, but ended up being excellent. Definitely somewhere I would come back. Fair pricing for the quality and amount of food."}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood joint!  Had the fried chicken sandwich and sweet fries for lunch - perfect combo and couldn't get enough of the fries. Homemade ketchup- sweet and spicy - they nailed it!  Olive tapenade and bread was a great start to an awesome lunch. Wish I was part of the neighborhood to get a feel for the weekly vibe. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"In from Chicago for the weekend and loved their brunch menu. Great food, great atmosphere, friendly service"}
{"text":"Outstanding dinner and the service was beyond impeccable. It's been quite some time since I've visited, but will make it a point to have Fat Cats at the top of my list for \"can't miss\" dining destinations..."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Ribs were to die for.  Apple cobbler to finish it off.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pretty bleh for what I was expecting.  Seems like it would be fine dining with amazing food but the food doesn't live up the prices and we even skipped dessert to go elsewhere.  It's a nice place but just worth going to once.  The staff was really friendly with our kids and our experience was nice.  Just the food was ok."}
{"text":"Fat Cats is my obsession. There isn't a bad thing on the menu and the staff is top notch. The brussels spouts are perfection, the steak is mouthwatering, the calamari is so good I want to write a poem about it, the wine list is thoughtful and compliments the appropriately updated menu, perfectly.

The spot is small but well designed. Perfect for a date, perfect for a girls night, perfect for a quiet happy hour, perfect. 

I have always been impressed and happy with all aspects of this restaurant. It's been a staple in Tremont even when people still called the area the \"Southside.\" This is a Cleveland diamond and everyone needs to go at least once (but definitely more)."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and casual. The fish stew I got was decent  but  pricey considering the dish size. I was not too impressed with main dish but the deserts we ordered were so delicious. The chocolate cake with ice cream was perfect. The warm cake combining with the cold vanilla ice cream just bring the best experience to your taste buds."}
{"text":"Had a great late evening light dinner on side porch. Waiter was excellent. Mussels and Brussels sprouts were some of the best we have ever had. Cheesecake dessert absolutely delish! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here. I liked the subdued interior. The casual bar area and dining made me feel instantly relaxed and forget about the stress of the day. There were not too many beers on tap (4) but the bar tender made an excellent martini to start the night. For grubb we began with the tomato salad. This was not a caprese salad. It was slightly spicy and full of flavor - not just the old basil tomato routine. Very good. For dinners my wife had the pan seared halibut on smashed cauliflower - and loved it! I had the Pork taco. They were good, but there was so much Kimchi on it and slaw and lettuce - that it was more like a veggie taco -- AND with all of the kimchi - it became very very soggy and sloppy and I needed to eat it with a fork. The taste was good - but I was disappointed that it turned into a sloppy mess. We also had dessert and the Fallen Chocolate Cake lived up to the hype. It was a great way to end the meal.

Overall - the service was exceptional and the experience was good. We will go back and try some other items."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Service was great and the food was excellent. The soup portion was quite large but the entrees for lunch were perfect size. I had the hanger steak and frites. Cooked perfect.  I will go back for dinner. Nice quaint place. Nice wine and beer selection as well."}
{"text":"No complaints here, except their Web site could use some work (I like to peruse the menu online before getting there to get myself pumped up). First time dining at Fat Cats and really liked the cozy atmosphere. Decor is colorful and they featured some photographs from local artists, which was cool. Snagged a parking spot right outside, although fairly early for a Saturday (6:00). Probably best to make reservations if you're thinking about eating at peak time Friday/Saturday night as the place is pretty small - it's literally an old house converted into a restaurant. 

Shared a few apps amongst our group - sautéed calamari and thai chicken skewers. The sauce with those skewers was awesome - we were all trying to guess what made it sweet. Turns out some mango and coconut milk. The calamari was super tender with the right amount of spice in the sauce. Apps are a little on the pricey side considering the size, but between an app and entree, you won't leave hungry.

Got seared sea scallops for my entree. Generous portion of three giant scallops with a medley of diced veggies and potatoes - the scallops were like candy (if you like sea-flavored candy). Splurged on dessert and shared a lemon cheesecake and, get this ... walnut banana bread pudding with peanut butter sauce. Oh yeah, it was as good as it sounds!

By the way, their Web site is http://www.coolplacestoeat.com. Otherwise, if you're in the market for cat toys, then check out fatcats.com."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!!! Amazing Brunch!! Will be coming here again for sure. French Toast wasn't overly sweet. Potato cakes were fantastic"}
{"text":"We went here on Monday and had the $25 three course dinner.  I ordered the calamari to start, mac n cheese for dinner and chocolate bomb cake for dessert; hubby ordered brussel sprouts to start, bavette steak for dinner and apple cobbler for dessert.  This was plenty of food for each person, though I would expect that if you order these items a la carte they give you bigger entrée portions (at least I would hope, as the bavette steak was small!) The only parts of the meal I would say were good were the sprouts (good flavor), the bavette steak (cooked well) and the chocolate bomb (hard to mess this up!).  The mac n cheese was in a liquid that didn't quite taste like cheese, apple cobbler was a strange texture and flavor, and the fried calamari was pretty standard.  Overall, this is the definition of a 3 star experience.  Service was attentive, albeit not the friendliest."}
{"text":"First time there and loved loved loved it. Great casual welcoming atmosphere. Super service but not annoying. Food was superb. The view of Cleveland at the end of the short road is historical. Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"Best happy hour. Great drinks and food. Dining room can be cramped. Not good for kids. Patio seating is not great."}
{"text":"Good food but very small and the service can be lacking at times. I've been here when it's been packed and when it's been just a couple of tables worth of people and either time the service wasn't that great. I love the Brussel sprouts appetizer from here."}
{"text":"My wife, daughter, son-in-law and I had dinner at Fat Cats recently. My son-in-law and I had the House Burger, my daughter had the Macaroni and Cheese and my wife had the Salmon Burger. Everyone's' food was excellent and the service was prompt and courteous. My wife claims the cheese cake was the best she has ever had. It was very light. I give Fat Cats 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Can't believe I'm the first to review this place.  To be honest I haven't been in one year now but it is my favorite place in Tremont...

GOOD STUFF:  Trendy with good food and good service.  The bartenders are really well trained here (or just nice).  If you go a couple of times they'll introduce themselves and remember you when you come back in....plus they make crazy martinis with their homemade recipes..I got a pumpkin martini here that was really good.

BAD STUFF:  Sometimes crowded and can be a bit loud.  Small like most Tremont places but I like that...gives it a better feel.  Somewhat pricey (again like most of the Tremont places).

PRICE:  About 100$ with liquor for two people.

OVERALL:  Great date place or special occasion dinner.  Bar tenders are top notch.  Not as overhyped like some of the other Tremont and Downtown locations."}
{"text":"An excellent restaurant. Everything from the cool old building the restaurant is in, to the service, to the food was great. I went for brunch and had the veggie burrito. The burrito was delicious, and all the ingredients in it seemed to be very fresh.

I will absolutely be back and I have no reservations about recommending this place."}
{"text":"I want to Fat Cabs TOday. 

Gr8 place. Had a GR9 meal (SO GOOD) thanks guys. 

Had trouble picking a drink TONIFHT but thankfully manager SCOTT SWEPT into the scene and ordered me the one with Rosemary (me grandmas name) (good name) hahah. It tas ted good!!!
HAHA thanks Sco 

I wa sn't sure if I would love this placebutScottmadeisuchafineevening and I appreciated him so muh. Nice"}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday night and had a really great meal!  I'll start with the negative to get it out of the way.  Really, the only critical thing that I can say about Fat Cats is that despite a reservation, we still had to wait 15 minutes. I guess it wouldn't have been so bad if a) we weren't starving, and b) I didn't have out-of-town in-laws that I wanted to impress.

But the experience only got better from the time we sat down. Everyone was great to us, even though it was majorly crowded at first. My mother-in-law is an extremely picky eater who really would always want to go to a chain restaurant in order to get her salad & soup combo, or something really small, or something meat-and-potatatoey that she can share with somebody. She was really happy here because of...what did she call it? The \"local flavor\" or something like that. She was surprised to see fare other than burgers and \"sammies\" on the menu.

Anyway, she was very happy with her alaskan halibut. The fact that she and my father-in-law shared it did not make the server flinch at all (unlike the way they gave them \"that look\" the previous night at another restaurant). 

I had the spinach and leek soup, which was creamy, tasty, and filling. It came with a crostini overflowing with the same olive tapenade that they bring to the table with olive oil & vinegar for the bread. Delicious - so much so that I could hardly eat my main course, the rigatoni with olives, onions, fresh tomato sauce, and lake erie creamery feta. So good!

My husband had the arugula salad and then the duck entree, which he really enjoyed. We also  shared some great egg rolls to start.

And oh, can't forget about dessert. If you come here and consider skipping it, DON'T. Get the fallen chocolate cake (served with vanilla ice cream and a port-wine sauce) or the peanut butter cheesecake (topped with grape jam and drizzled with chocolate sauce). Even my in-laws, who were gabbing about Weight Watchers all night, ate every bite.

I seem to remember the last time I came here (last summer) there wasn't a very large selection of beers on tap. Even though it's still not huge, they seem to have added a couple of good local choices.

Fat Cats is a great  mix of casual atmosphere with really delicious food. Everything I had surprised me, which is always good!"}
{"text":"Yyaayy for local pubs. Great place to meet friends, slam some happy hour food and drinks and chat the bartender's ear off."}
{"text":"I was so glad a co-worker suggested we go here for lunch. Everyone's food was excellent and they filled a request for something off the dinner menu even though we were there for lunch. They also do brunch on Saturdays- which can sometimes be hard to find."}
{"text":"My review is based off their Happy Hour. I came here recently with a friend and when we arrived a little after 4pm we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves. The Happy Hour menu here offers a lot of options. They have $3, $5 and $6 food menu and offer $1 off drafts, $3.50 special listed beers and a select few wine specials. The bartender let us know that the food is more like tapas/small plate sizes during happy hour. 

In all we ordered the Fried Cheese, Fried Shrimp, Beef Nachos and Fried Chicken Sandwich. The fried cheese was nothing special and came out looking like a deep fried cheese patty. The taste was okay but nothing made it special. The Fried Shrimp was not good at all. It had a strange taste and the sauce it comes with had no flavor at all (and you only get two shrimps). The Fried chicken sandwich was good enough. The Beef Nachos were the bomb! This was the best thing we ordered and I would come back again for this dish alone. 

I'll give this place another shot during happy hour as they had a lot of food options that I have not tried yet, their drink specials are good and our bartender was friendly."}
{"text":"Different take on a seafood menu. Overall happy. Kinda small setting and over charred on the grill certain dishes. But overall I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my wife and friends for a Happy Hour eating-fest before a recent Cavs game.  Cheap happy hour drinks and a wide selection of interesting food choices across three price-point categories.  A good selection of both beers and mixed drinks made for a nice selection to choose from.

Our table went nuts and ordered a bunch of different dishes to share around the table...an eclectic mix!  Fried cheese, sweet potato fries, pork belly steamed buns, pizza, tempura shrimp, burger, mussels.

As you can see, the Happy Hour menu reaches across a number of different food styles so there is probably something for every taste as well as both carnivore and vegetarian alike.  While not huge in size, each dish was easily shareable and at $3-6 each there is almost a \"no harm, no foul\" mentality to ordering and trying something outside your comfort zone or at least giving yourselves a nice chance to sample a bunch of cool dishes.

He had a blast doing it, hope you will too!"}
{"text":"My first time dinning in I most say the employees were very friendly. I just left work and came just on time for there happy hour which isn't that bad of a selection I suppose. I was really in the mood for a crispy chicken sandwich which originally caught my attention. The chicken sandwich was average. And I got it for the happy hour price but I kinda was expecting better. It was good. But idk if I would be returning for just that item.  The area is great for nice days with an outside patio."}
{"text":"Great food, price, and service!

Went on a Monday for happy hour and sat on the patio. They have a great happy hour menu that's very reasonably priced. Great drink selection also. The Moscow mule ($6.5) was made perfectly. The tofu and pork buns ($3 each) were AMAZING! Great flavor and portion. For our meals we had the burger ($6) and fried chicken sandwich ($6) which both were great. The burger however came plain with cheese but if you add spicy ketchup or their aioli it had much more flavor. The sweet potato fries were also fantastic, they had some sort of tempura batter on and were cooked perfectly!

The server also informed us on Mondays they have a prix fix menu for $25 which includes an app, entree and dessert. Will definitely go back and try it! Lots of other great choices and a lot of vegetarian (tofu) options."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Came in for brunch and all of the dishes exceeded expectations. A very homey place with good quality food and service."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for lunch and the food is outstanding.  The view is fantastic, and is probably even better at night, the service is great, and the ambiance is wonderful--a good neighborhood bar/place to eat.  I want to go back for dinner soon.

A bonus--they always have a lot of specials.  The only problem is, it's hard to choose because everything is so good.

Note: I wrote that it's wheelchair-accessible, but there are steps up to the restroom, plus I'm not sure how easy it would be for someone in a wheelchair to get into that space."}
{"text":"Had a terrific lunch here and the prices were great considering the quality of the food.  I had Walleye for the very first time and it was perfectly cooked and can't imagine any better preparation.  Simple, perfectly seasoned, buttery little crisp edges, tender moist steaming flaky inside.  Served stop a perfect accompaniment:  sautéed baby kale, mushrooms and farro in a tasty light but savory sauce that made it all sing.  My friend had the salmon, perfectly seasoned with just the right touch of char, atop some Asian greens & veg mixture, also delish.  Great service, everyone smiling.  Interesting little place, it's all about the food.  I think my plate was only $11, like a reward for making your way to this place.  Oh yes, almost forgot the most unbelievably good sweet potato fries, try them as a starter!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum yum yum.

My mom was visiting Cleveland, and I wanted to find a delicious lunch place for the two of us to go to. While walking around Tremont, I had stumbled across Fat Cats (sadly, it was closed for the day at the time) and read the great reviews posted on their windows, so I decided to take a chance and go here.

Delicious! We went for lunch on a Wednesday, and the place was pretty empty - it slowly filled up a bit, but was still over half empty. The menu didn't look very professionally done, but who cares, the food was great. We both got the chicken sandwich  with homemade chips - oh my goodness. I could have just eaten the inside of the sandwich forever. 

The waitress was really attentive and brought us plenty of bread and olive oil (with actual olives!) - so much so that I very sadly couldn't finish the homemade chips.

I would go back here in a second - don't be fooled by the outside and step in!"}
{"text":"Decided to give the Tremont joint a try after falling in love with their east side cohort Felice. I have to say although the atmosphere, menues, clientele and happy hours(fantastic btw) are similar Fat Cats lacks the ambiance and service I was expecting. No complaints on food, price or drink only slightly underwhelmed..."}
{"text":"Love! I came to Fat Cats about 6 years ago was not a fan at all- and as a result I never went back. 

Yesterday me and my girlfriends went to try the happy hour and it was AMAZING. The food was excellent and selection was great! My absolute favorite menu item was the Olive Tapenade with Rustic bread! Staff was very attentive. This place is now on the time of my list for affordable, delicious, high quality small plates. I would say a great date night place for happy hour or any hour. They also have a brunch menu so i will have to try that.  Desert menu looked dangerously good but we were to full at that point to try anything"}
{"text":"Loved this spot! Had $25 three course meal. I chose the sweet potato fried shrimp, fish stew, and goat cheese cheesecake.  All were great!"}
{"text":"Came here for Happy Hour on a Thursday, and was really pleased with my experience! We ordered Bread & Tapenade, Fried Cheese, Beef Nachos, Burger, Crispy Fried Chicken Sandwich. I would highly suggest the Bread & Tapenade, Fried Cheese (it sounds weird but I promise you it's very delicious and savory!), and Crispy Fried Chicken Sandwich out of the selection.  They also serve Moscow Mules here, my favorite drink! May or may not have ordered too much food ;D

Tip: If you step out from Fat Cats, and walk along the road overlooking the city there's a great picturesque view of downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"I was pretty underwhelmed by just about everything at this restaurant.. Its not often that I disagree with most of the Yelp reviews but I really just don't get what everyone likes so much about it! 

To start off, the beer selection was okay but they were out of about 4 of the things on the list.. which is just annoying but not a huge deal. The service was also just okay. We sat at the bar so I know the bartenders were busy but they also just weren't that friendly or overly helpful. 

Honestly, I just really didn't like the food or the menu. They had a menu on their website with a sandwich that I liked the sound of and when I got there, the menu had changed! That's fine.. if you update your menu on the website! I'm a vegetarian so I always check first so I can make sure there are options for me. They still had an entree with tofu but instead of the sandwich, which was on the website and sounded great, it was tofu with noodles and vegetables. Okay, fine, I order it.. and it was not good. Flavors were weird or lacking altogether from bite to bite. My boyfriend got a burger that he said was just okay. 

We also got fries and they came with a fried egg on them.. which was kind of a neat idea but really weird to eat? And there was bread with oil, which was tasty, but it was just a tiny piece each AND i saw the bartender drop some of the bread and just put it back into the basket they were serving from.. 

Decor is neat, though! I just thought the food was underwhelming and overpriced. It's great that they use local ingredients but I just didn't think the menu was anything to get excited about and I\"m not sure that I plan on going back. There are so many good places in the area I'd rather go back to! I really don't get the appeal, sadly."}
{"text":"First time rolling up to Fat Cats and let me tell you the food was on point. To start off I went with the tomato bisque soup..soo tasty  followed up by two dank fully filled juicy breakfast tacos. The service was very efficient and the quality was respectable. I would recommend this fine establish to anyone who loves breakfast tacos or food in general. I will be back to fat cats and that is a fact."}
{"text":"Update:
I'm updating this review, well, because this place deserves it.  While my experience before was subpar, a dinner here was absolutely fabulous.  Our waitress was phenomenal, witty, charming, and knowledgeable about the menu and wines.  The food was fantastic, it's refined and well put together.  I had the hanger steak, and my partner had the fish stew... both were wonderful.  I would definitely recommend it in the future.


Previous: 
I wanted to be this place to be great... or even really good... but instead it's just pretty okay.

As per my normal - I have only been here for happy hour, and I was not exactly impressed with everything.  I had the Tang cocktail - it's tasted awkward... and not in a good way.  I happened to be dining with a vegan girl, but she will lean towards vegetarian when neccessary.  Upon her asking for recommendations - he just said \"meat and fish\"... which is funny the first time, but not when she asks again and you refuse to give her any direction.  Just to be clear - there are quite a few happy hour vegetarian items on the menu.

I ended up trying three things for happy hour (2 would have been enough).

Grape Jelly Pizza - I asked him if this was weird or good.  He asked me if I knew the restaurant.  I said no, but that sometimes places put things on just to be different.  I would not order this again... it was... okay.  But a little too sweet.  It just begged to be balanced out by another flavor.

Squash Pierogi - this was pretty tasty.  I'm a Polish girl at heart, and this was unlike anything I've had before.  I wouldn't say it knocked my socks off - but I would eat it again for sure.

Calamari - I loved this!  Lightly breaded... perfect garlic aioli!  It was much better than I expected... and I would definitely come back for it!

To top it all off we split a goatcheese cheesecake.  This was a delightful little treat.  It was savory, and topped with a berry compote.  It wasn't overly sweet... and it was well balanced.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food and a fun, funky atmosphere. We had the grilled octopus, kale salad and the salmon. Finished with the chocolate bread pudding. Overall, the food was just like the restaurant, funky and fun. Definitely unique and didn't disappoint.

Our sever was a bit inattentive. She was helpful when we were ordering but disappeared at times. The food was also completely dumped on us all at once. Not preferred when ordering an app, salad and entree. 

Still love the fig but not my best customer service experience"}
{"text":"I know people love this place, but I don't really see why.  I ordered the most basic thing on the menu - fish and chips... and they gave me, well, badly prepared finger sticks.  Okay, that's a bit harsh, but really for all the hype it really wasn't worth it.  The batter was bland and soggy.  There was no malt vinegar (come on, its fish and chips!).  it seemed like they put in some malt into the batter - not appealing.  I probably won't be back.  Plenty of great restaurants in Cleveland to spend my money at."}
{"text":"Very good. We went on a warm day and sat outside for a Sunday lunch. Very good food and service. Definitely would return when we're back in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Tremont is tucked away in Cleveland and Fat Cats is tucked away in the neighborhood. Fortunately for Jeannene and I, people are finding the restaurant easy enough as we would rue the day that it would close (yes, I was able to use \"rue\" in a sentence this week!).
The ambiance is a wonderful hip casual as Fat Cats operates out of a converted house with wood floors, warm colors and cool paintings. Then come the drinks, in addition to a decent wine list, the cocktails show some imagination. For instance their Oaxacan Cooler ($10) uses Mezcal, St, Germaine, honey syrup, lemon and grapefruit which gives a smokey twist on the usual tequilla cocktail.
We were there on Thursday and for an appetizer we got the Bahn Bao ($8). The two decent-sized steamed buns each had a slice of pork belly (not just pulled or chipped pork) and then pickled daikon, hoison, and jalapeno cilantro to spice up the thick pork and gummy bun.
For the main course, either Jeannene or I always get their salmon dish and this time it was my turn.  I am not a big salmon fan as it usually goes too much toward oily, but I love Fat Cats' as it is always cooked perfectly with spices that counter the heaviness of the fish. In this case, we're talking tandoori spice, chili oil and mint chutney to go with quinoa. The only downside is the portion size is a little skimpy but then again the price of $20 is going to be the least you'll pay for salmon at a top-notch restaurant. Jeannene went with the spring risotto ($16) ( why she would do that since it had no meat I have no idea!) but she loved it. 
For dessert we had a banana fosters bread pudding which was delicious -- warm gooey bread with mushy warm bananas and a thick, and I mean thick, burnt caramel sauce."}
{"text":"Don't stop here unless you have two hours to kill. I'm not sure if they were under staffed but we were there around 1:30 on a Sunday. It took over 10 minutes to see our waitress, another 10-15 to get our drinks and 15 more to get our food.  We were never given napkins and silverware. I needed to get it myself.  The food on the other hand was great!   My salad had the lettuce core in it:("}
{"text":"Oh my goodness--the happy hour here is amazing! Such a deal for such delicioso chompings. I loved their sophisticated mac and cheese and everything else I sampled somewhat recently, though not recently enough, for me to provide a full-tilt boogie review. The wine was excellent--I recall that I had Riesling that fateful night not so long ago. And dessert--I must've--I did-- stick around for that crowning jewel of any meal--it was fabulous
 indeed."}
{"text":"Made eye contact with a family of women at a table caddy corner to mine. I sat alone eating my food and drinking champagne - champagne cuz I was celebrating a recent promotion - and one of the women smiled at me and she had really nice teeth but they were alarmingly white because everyone is into having these ridiculously unnatural white teeth these days because we're all so completely brainwashed now. Anyway I saw this woman's alarmingly white teeth and I was so taken aback that I instinctively turned my face down away from her toward my plate and pretended as if I hadn't actually seen her horrifically beaming smile. Later I looked back toward her and I caught her glancing at me and I didn't want to provoke her into smiling again so I did my best to look solemn and avoid her eyes once more. I made it through the meal without having to see her teeth anymore. I was totally satisfied with everything I ate."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place in the hip Tremont neighborhood. It actually just looks like a house converted into a bar/restaurant. What really stands out is their Monday night special which is appetizer, entree, dessert for $25.

They definitely have some eccentric appetizers on the menu like a grape jelly pizza, but everything tastes pretty good. I would the two entrees I have gotten there, korean short ribs and something else I cant recall, could taste better. The desserts are also good.

I would come here again, but for the price and taste only the Monday deal seems worthwhile."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some friends and had a better experience than last time. 

We sat outside on the patio, enjoying a breezy fall day. I ordered the house pappardelle, which has braised lamb shank, butternut squash, mushroom confit, lamb jus. The noodles were a really, really good consistency! Knowing the portions of Fat Cats (and Felice), I was nervous about whether or not it would be filling enough, but I was pleasantly surprised at how satisfied I was at the end! I was definitely good to go. 

They still give out one piece of bread at a time. The olive oil/olives spread is good as always!

Service was very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"An underrated gem - remains, somehow, one of the best-kept secrets in Cleveland dining. All three experiences I've had there have been memorably positive. Very inventive ingredient combinations, diverse menu, pleasant ambiance."}
{"text":"A friend & I came to Fat Cat's on Sunday afternoon after a quick visit to Cleveland for the weekend. Our friend who lives in Clevland recommended Fat Cat's and said it was one of her favorites in the city! I was excited to give it a try! 

By the time we arrived, it was Sunday around noon and it was pretty full. We ended up not having to wait to be seated & our food was served quickly.  This was great because I was starving! The service that we had at Fat Cat's was just OK. The waitress was in and out and didn't care much to ask any questions or start any conversation with us. 

They still had brunch specials while we were there (I think it was until 3) so I ordered a mimosa and my friend ordered a bloody mary. My mimosa was fine- how can you mess that up!? My friend only had a few sips of her bloody mary- she said it wasn't very good. For our lunches, we both ordered the breakfast burger. This sounded great after a night of drinking! The burger had bacon and fried egg on it- it was just OK. The sweet potato fries that we ordered extra was the best part of this meal. I think that maybe I just ordered the wrong thing at Fat Cats, I would love to come back for dinner and try something new (heard they have good martinis too!)"}
{"text":"I've fallen deeply in love with Tremont.

This is yet another magical independently owned restaurant -- yet another piece of what makes Cleveland, Ohio, such a glorious swatch in our nation's cultural patchwork.

The small plates and soups are wonderful, though I highly recommend you explore whichever specials the creative chefs have whipped together. The crab cake sandwich is one such success.

The decor is hip. 
The food is fun and delicious.
Cool cats aplenty.

{"text":"I live through good food, ambiance, and friendly people. Fat Cats was a pleasant Yelp find. Visiting from out of town, this humble farm to table restaurant is worth seeking out! The server was extremely helpful (he even suggested places to visit on my down time). Their crispy chicken sandwich is delightfully naughty. It was a pleasant surprise to arrive during happy hour. I was able to take my time and try multiple items. Come one, come all. It's delish!"}
{"text":"Had a very nice early dinner with my cousins.  The atmosphere was very welcoming and relaxed  however it was extremely hot.  The AC was on but I do not believe it was turned down enough to accommodate the square footage of the building and the many guests.  The food was delicious, very well seasoned and cooked to perfection.  Prices were a little on the high side and I was extremely shocked when I got my bill and my house Margarita was $10.50.  I was charged $8.00 for the Margarita and $2.50 for \"Rocks\".  Because of that, yes I realize it was only $2.50, I will not be going back again. $2.50 for ICE and a rail mixed drink.  Wow."}
{"text":"This place is beyond amazing. I have no idea as to how I've never heard of it. To get straight to the point, the service was on point along with the food. Oh ma gaw, let me tell you about the food. We started off with bread and balsamic/olive oil sauce/dipping. That alone was amazing. Then the toasted break with goat cheese and their special tomato jam sauce? Oh myyy gawd. I ordered the chicken sandwich to play it safe so I wouldn't be disappointed if it tasted like any other sandwich. Boy was I wrong; the coleslaw in the sandwich made it stand out for the better and those fries, those sweet potato fries, just yes. I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Was at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and wanted something local. I wasn't sure what to expect walking into this place it seems to be in a different neighborhood and looks like old house. Once in the door I was pleasantly  surprised with hand painted art of a big FAT CAT.
Service was very good and friendly. The menu was a lot of eggs and some vegetarian dishes but I was also there for lunch or brunch. I ended up with Sausage Rigatoni and it was delicious. The thing that stuck out to me the most was the fresh green bean's mixed into the pasta along with mushrooms and fresh basil all over the top. Price was good and moderate I would recommend to a friend for something fresh and just nice."}
{"text":"Met friends for dinner here and had an awesome time. Menu is eclectic, but everyone in our group liked their meal, lots of vegetarian options. A little off the beaten path in tremont, but worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Adorable little restaurant. You can see downtown from the windows! The staff is super friendly and I love how it is a house atmosphere. It's very cozy. I've heard their bloody Mary's are delicious, but I was not in the alcohol mood that morning for brunch. It's a little pricey, but their food and drinks are very fresh. I forget what it was called, but I got an avocado breakfast sandwich. It was delicious and it came with sweet potato fries which were even more delicious. My friend got a breakfast burrito which was full of weird ingredients, but that was so tasty too. I definitely recommend this little restaurant. It's great!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group for dinner, and I was pretty impressed! I started off the meal with a cocktail (forgot what it was called, but it was served warm), and it was pretty tasty! It didn't come as warm as I had expected, but the staff was very attentive and offered several times to rewarm my drink. In terms of the food, we all ended up just ordering a bunch of appetizers and sharing them. Everything was good, but our favorites were the brussel sprouts and the empanadas! Desserts were awesome as well- we shared the chocolate cake and the bread pudding. Overall, good food in a nice cozy venue!"}
{"text":"We all had a great experience at Fat Cats. When I walked in, the bar area was completely full. If my glass of malbec was any reflection of the other wine selections offered, they certainly have an enjoyable drink menu. 

The place is fairly small and comfortable with a contemporary, trendy feeling. However, I did not enjoy the music selection; I felt it would've been better suited for a faux New York bar, and should have been replaced with some good jazz. 

The food was fresh and flavorful. I enjoyed a risotto dish adorned with lots of fresh vegetables. The chocolate cake was moist with a fudge like center had a perfect accompaniment of a rich port sauce. 

The server was extremely attentive and sweet.

I would highly recommend this for a night out."}
{"text":"This little \"gem of Tremont\" is a must try! Lovely atmosphere...

The menu is fantastic. Service was great. Went there for lunch on a weekday, and everything tasted fresh and homemade. They only use Locally Grown, Ohio Raised produce & meats. Very unique pairings of food & some nice selections of drinks!"}
{"text":"Farm to table. Fresh every day. Ever changing imaginative menu items. fair prices for what you get. P.W. likes the place too. This place is good. It has everything.

One of those places where you have to have one of the chef's special of the day."}
{"text":"Had brunch with friends at Fat Cats last Saturday and all I can say is that we discovered brunch nirvana!  In fact, every  time I've been here I have been impressed with the quality of the food.  I love to cook myself and it is obvious that the folks running this gem know what they are doing and they care about the food.  It is, in my opinion, one of the best places in the Cleveland area.  Hooray! for Fat Cats!"}
{"text":"A bit difficult to find, as it's in a neighborhood, this place is a sweet gem to add to your list of \"where should I eat\" in Cleveland.

The olive tapenade is good with the bread and the variety of foods suited everyone in our large party.  

Parking is a bit difficult, don't come in a sports car if you are worried about gravel kicking up on the sides.

While not an extremely fancy place, don't come in sweats and a tshirt either."}
{"text":"Great beer and wine choices, cute decor and great bread. Portions were somewhat small and I was unable to enjoy the conversation with everyone in my party due to the awkward table set up and loud noise. It was also drafty/cold. We asked them turn down the air or close the vents since it was so uncomfortable but they did not. The patio looked nice, it was a good view of the city but not the best view since the patio is right by the parking lot. I would go back though to try another dish with a smaller group and make sure I bring a sweater!"}
{"text":"Toni and I stopped in, per her review, on a Sunday morning after our evening out in Cleveland.  We were both craving a greasy, filling brunch and an alcoholic beverage to take the edge off of our hangovers.  My friend we were visiting had mentioned that Fat Cats is one of her favorite places in the area, so we decided to give it a try.

Like most other places in Tremont, Fat Cat's is cute and welcoming both inside and outside.  Locals filled the tables and we were seated promptly next to a larger party.  I ordered a Bloody Mary and Toni ordered the mimosa.  The Bloody was just OK.  Extremely strong - and I was about to make the trek back to Pittsburgh, so I couldn't finish it.  Toni's mimosa was good.

We both ordered the breakfast burger with the fried egg on top and sweet potato fries with aioli.  I usually prefer ranch, but they do not offer it here. Presentation of our meals was nice.  Our burgers were absolutely flavorless.  Mine was undercooked and so was the egg.  Neither of us finished even half of our meals.  Not even salt or pepper helped. Service was ok - nothing stood out positively that I can remember, but also nothing bad either.

I asked my friend after our meal what she normally orders since she was the one that recommended it, and she informed me she usually just goes for martinis and appetizers.  Maybe if you're interested in that, this would be a good choice, but I wouldn't come back ever again for brunch.  Much better places in CLE with better food."}
{"text":"I went with a couple friends and we got the Banh Mi, steak tacos, and fried chicken sandwich. First, the sweet potato fries are bomb. Probably one of the best I've had. My fried chicken sandwich was awesome. I tried the steak tacos, not my favorite tacos but pretty good. My friend said her Banh mi was very good. The service was good and prices were not too bad for the value. I'd come back again just for those fries."}
{"text":"Three-course dinner for $25 on the dog-friendly patio with friends, on a temperate 75-degree evening... What's not to love? 

We weren't aware that Monday nights are $25 specials, where all apps, entrees, and desserts are fair game. Nor were we aware of how ridiculously priced happy hour deals are. These were only bonuses after having come here as a back-up to our first choice restaurant that turned out to be closed on Monday evenings (really?). 

The covered patio seating wraps around only the front of the building, facing their similarly petite parking lot. The venue is perfect for large reunions as well as a couple's outing, and even with such a deal going on, we found it just busy enough to feel lively but not so overwhelming as to lose its quaint charm. 

I had originally made a beeline for the happy hour apps ($3 shortribs? $7 fried chicken sando??), but after hearing about the special I had to take advantage of it. I started with the Avocado + Chips plus the optional Smoked Trout topping, which was a generous heaping of housemade guac and pita chips. I ran out of chips and trout all too soon, and I really think smoked trout should be added to all guac (unless you're dining with non-fish eaters). The guacamole itself wasn't that great, and I had a few spoonfuls of too salty guacamole I couldn't finish at the end. My friend's Grilled Octopus appetizer was chewy but still tender enough to cut through without much difficulty. Would also recommend the Tofu Carnitas, a surprisingly pleasant and flavorful take on tofu! 

My Bouillabaisse wasn't actually that great, being a little heavy on the shellfish flavor and not enough tomatoes and spice. The addition of the garlic bread stick was much needed for that extra kick and to get over the not-quite-fresh seafood. The Hangar Steak was very tender, and my other friend enjoyed every spoonful of her Butternut Squash Soup - so perhaps choose those instead. 

Somehow I had made my Puerto cocktail last until dessert, so I couldn't bring myself to choose a spiked Root Beer Float (although I tried some of my friend's nonalcoholic one - a dependable decision). I instead chose the Bread Pudding, which was probably too heavy and sweet a decision to end on but nonetheless tasty. 

Our waitresses were down to earth and while they left us mostly alone to our devices, came consistently to refill our water. The bathrooms are located conveniently right across the way from the front entrance. The women's restroom was little more than a closet, and when I entered it was strangely warm... Definitely would have been unpleasant if it were a hotter day. 

The only thing I can think of to answer my original question is the spiders. Yes, I am aware of the risks of sitting outside, and won't even complain about the single mosquito bite. But there were no less than 5 spiders of varying sizes idly spinning up and down the wall right next to our table. One of them got close enough for my friend to freak out and squash. The lesson? Check your surroundings before sitting down!"}
{"text":"FINALLY had an opportunity to try Fat Cats for Happy Hour.  Cool space, good food.  I ordered the Happy Hour Ribs, Sweet Potato Fries and Puerto cocktail.   The ribs were tasty but the serving was disappointing, 2- 4\" long ribs no garnish, or anything for $6 a small spring greens garnish, or small scoop of homemade slaw would have made this dish a winner..  The fries were ok at $3.  The cocktail was excellent with hints of grapefruit.  I will absolutely return to try some of the other selections."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch and ordered the hanger steak with mashed potatoes and roaster green beans.  Steak was nicely cooked and the homemade steak sauce was delicious.  I was a little disappointed in the portion size.  I should have known because the price was very reasonable ($12).  I will check out Fat Cats again, but probably won't order the same dish unless I am looking for a snack and not a meal."}
{"text":"I'm remiss in writing my reviews. .. sorry.
Fat Cats is a hidden gem of Tremont. Dog friendly patio, cozy inside abode, comfortable bar.

The dinner menu and happy hour menu play off of the specials, whether food or drinks. 

The Trigger cocktail started off with ...wait for it... Bullet Bourbon,  pureed cantaloupe and honey jalapeño syrup. 

Foodie alert!!!! Sound the alarm. ..
The crispy brussel sprouts with other stuff was healthy and tasty. 
The fresh bread with olive Tapenade was savory and every drop eaten.  Laced in EVOO and Balsamic. 
The mussels (sorry, no pic...train gone) were so savory delish. 
The chickpea sandwich topped with an Avacado cabbage slaw was just knock you off your feet goodness.
The sweet potato fried shrimp was oversized snd ridiculous.  

The three of us had too much to write. But it's a FAV in Tremont. ..cleveland west side area.

Wrapping up the night was an apple, cheddar cheese cobbler with vanilla bean ice cream. No pic because it wasn't pretty but it was dang good. 

Bottom line.. fabulous! Hit the gym tomorrow!"}
{"text":"This has become my go-to happy hour spot. They have a great selection of small plates, some of which are very tasty (I love the Calamari and the Pasta e Fagioli), and a decent selection of beer and cocktails (although I do wish they'd put a gin martini back on the happy hour menu). The service hasn't always been the most polite, but it's always been timely and we have always felt taken care of, even when we went with groups of 6 or so. I have heard of people having bad experiences there, but it hasn't happened to me yet.

The atmosphere is charming and there's a nice, small patio area which looks out to the flats and downtown.

I haven't been there for anything other than happy hour, since I can't afford to regularly eat out at those prices (being a graduate student in my early 20's), and there are, frankly, better options in that price range.

Even though it's farther from me than Felice, which is owned by the same people, I always make the trip here, since I have been to Felice twice and have not had satisfactory experiences there either time."}
{"text":"We thought we maybe had the wrong address at first but this place is top notch. The food is fresh and you can taste the difference. Great beer selection. We had some local beers. The food was EXCELLENT. Fried chicken sandwich and spaghetti. Sounds plain but with an excellent twist, they were superb. Yum yum yum. Stop here. It's great."}
{"text":"It's hard to go wrong here. Great food, a fun, funky location in Tremont, and a relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"I don't have the chance to venture far from east side suburbia too often, but I had the opportunity to have dinner at Fat Cats in Tremont a few weeks ago, and it was fantastic!  It straddles the line between trendy, hipster, casual, and sophisticated all at once, and somehow, it pulls it off.

For full disclosure, I didn't pay for my three-course meal here.  However, I was fortunate enough to be seated near other foodies who wanted to sample the menu, so I got to try a bite of a lot of things.  As a result, I can vouch for:
--warmed goat cheese appetizer: you can never go wrong with goat cheese, but it's particularly good here.  The tomato jam is a nice touch.
--crispy brussels sprouts: possibly my favorite of the appetizers, and while I like brussels sprouts, I don't know that they've ever been a favorite before!  The crispiness is perfection and the dipping sauce is delicious.
--mussels: excellent.  While I like white wine garlic sauces, I get bored of this being everybody's go-to, so it was great that Fat Cats went with red curry instead.  It's sweet and spice and everything nice.  Save your bread to dip into this.
--sweet potato fried shrimp: the only thing I felt \"meh\" about.  They were good, but the sweet potato didn't come through as much as I would've thought.
--pan roasted salmon: at least 2/3 of the table ordered this, and for good reason.  It's roasted to perfection-- crisp on the outside but still moist on the inside.  I enjoyed the polenta and slaw that came with it as well.
--dessert: I can't find the dessert menu online and I forgot the name of what I ordered, but it was reminiscent of apple cobbler and it came with cinnamon ice cream and I loved it.
--drinks: apparently the cocktails are good, and they had a nice array of local and international beers.  I had the Market Garden Citramax IPA, which is always nice to see on a menu.

I'm glad I had a chance to make it to Fat Cats, and I'd definitely Uber this way again to try even more of the menu."}
{"text":"I've had Fat Cats bookmarked for a while as I've really wanted to sample their eclectic menu. But it wasn't until I saw their menu online and found that they offer Filipino lumpia that just lit a fire under me and finally decided to go there for lunch. As soon as we sat down, without even looking at the menu, I asked our server to bring us lumpia for starters. Our server then brought us some bread with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and chopped olives for dipping. Nice touch! Browsing through the lunch menu while waiting for the food, decided to share the spaghetti squash with calamari and spicy marinara and the Korean barbecue ribs. 

Ok, the lumpia arrived. There were 3 on a small plate with a couple of sauces. I think one was mustard-based and the other was apricot-based. I tend to be a purist and don't really like sauces. I tasted them, but went without for much of the lumpia appetizer. The good part? They were crispy, but that's about it. I could've sworn that when I saw the menu online, I saw pork lumpia. Traditionally, in Filipino cuisine, lumpia is filled with ground pork. The owner/Chef, Ricardo Sandoval is Filipino... so there was no reason for me to think that this lumpia would be filled with any other protein but pork. Disappointedly, I discovered in my first bite that the mushy filling in this lumpia was tofu. It prompted me to grab the menu again to verify (again, I didn't look at the menu when I asked for lumpia upon first sitting down). Sure enough, the menu says tofu. Definitely not grandma's lumpia and far away from tradition. Such a bummer! But I'm not mad at Ricardo... Fat Cats is known for the eclectic menu, not a traditional menu.

Onto the  entrees. The spaghetti squash and calamari was delicious. My only criticism with it was that I thought the spaghetti squash was overdone and mushy. I'm used to spaghetti squash being more firm. The ribs... they were pretty good - it just wasn't what I expected, which was beef short ribs. The menu was a little vague with the description. When I hear Korean barbecue, I automatically think of kalbi - which I was really hoping for. The pork ribs that I got wasn't bad - nicely flavor and well-spiced. Aside from the spice, I failed to make the Korean connection.  Loved the tiny fries that came with it.

Dessert... got the bananas foster bread pudding with ice cream. It was great!! Deep flavors on the well-done (burnt) and buttery caramel sauce flavored with rum was killer!

This visit was a-ok, but there are so many more yummy-looking items on their menu that I'd like to come back to try. This wasn't a strong first impression, Fat Cats, but fear not... I'll for sure be back to find something I like!"}
{"text":"Came for happy hour. Awesome creative food. PERFECT portions. Good service. Cute artsy place."}
{"text":"Nice place in Tremont that wasn't crowded at all on a Sunday afternoon. The side salad was very good, really liked whatever dressing was on it (had walnuts too). The steak and eggs were also very good, especially the steak. Bacon was a little undercooked. Service was quick and super friendly but did take awhile to give us the check. Would definitely recommend and try again."}
{"text":"Cincinnati Chilli is amazing! Made with fresh hot peppers that are locally grown. Portion sizes are perfect. Went with a group of 5 and everyone loved their food! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were exploring the Tremont area and walking along and found Fat Cats. We decided to stop for lunch and rehydration since it was a very hot day and we had been walkng for some time. We were seated immediately and menus arrived. My friend ordered a salad and I got one of their sandwiches, both of which were very good. We sat for some time and there was no problem with this. The staff was most accommodating and the waitress attentive. I would recommend and return when I return to Cleveland."}
{"text":"What a great staff. I am a delivery driver picking up food and had to explain to staff on why there is no tax on carry out. This is literally the first person I have ever explained it to and they did not get mad. But I agree. Period"}
{"text":"i think i'm obsessed. checked out fat cats on a lunch date with my boyfriend and was really impressed from start to finish. 

ordering off of the happy hour menu, we got the carrot soup, pork belly buns, short ribs, burger, and seasonal penne. i love the small plates concept because i'm super indecisive, and this is a great way to try a little bit of everything their eclectic menu has to offer. we ended up also trying the mussels and finished up with lemon cheesecake for dessert. 

my favorites were the short ribs and lemon cheesecake, which was super light and creamy - probably due to being made with goat cheese rather than cream cheese. for cocktails, i got the aviation and he got some sort of whiskey mule. he didn't care for his but i loved mine. 

the decor is adorable and our server was friendly and casual. waters were always filled and food came out with exceptional timing. 

all in all, our massive lunch ended up being around $60 which i felt was a steal. we got to try out a ton of different selections and can't wait to try the rest. will definitely be going back to try out their brunch menu!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and a decent bar, I just had a hard time finding it! I liked it here and will probably be back. I was just annoyed with the goofy 3 way intersection thing they had nearby. Not cool guys...

Anyway we started off the night with the Herb Crusted Goat Cheese with tomato jam. Probably one of the better appetizers they had! Great mix of sour and sweet tastes going on there. We also got the La Caprese with fresh mozzarella. Very good but nothing extraordinary.

For my entrée I got the Pan Roasted Duck Breast with a pumpkin goat cheese tart, and braised seasonal vegetables with an orange sauce. The duck was cooked well but I had a kinda lousy piece. Another colleague of mine had a much better cut. It was tasty though. The pumpkin tart was very interesting. It looked as if it was going to be sweet but had a very mellow almost bland taste. It was quite refreshing though after digging into a juicy duck breast. I was impressed but I think next time i will be getting the Hanger steak!  

Overall I had a good time and the food and service was above average. The bar had my favorite bourbon so i had no complaints there ! If you are a Clevelander, you should go here at least once. Just saying"}
{"text":"Found this little spot on the fly tonight.  We were blown away. I had the price fixed meal for $25!!  We Started with the warmed goat cheese with tomato jam. Perfect flavor profile. So satisfying. Then,I had the duck breast with apple challa bread pudding and kale. Cooked to a perfect medium rate, it was like eating steak. The skin was rendered so well. I've never had anything better.  The pudding was so good and the kale was surprisingly smokey.my girlfriend had the special buttermilk fried chicken, mashed potatoes and housemade apple sauce. The chicken was so tender and flavorful. And the crust was cornmeal based and crisp. We ended by splitting the lemon verbena cheesecake. Again, delicious. And our bill, including drinks came to just $50! And we left with a fried chicken lunch for tomorrow. Service was impeccable. Go there now!"}
{"text":"The best brunch in town. But go anytime because they always have unique tasty things. I love this place."}
{"text":"The French toast and potatoes pancakes are heavenly ! I love going home and enjoying a great meal in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Fat Cats.  First, the good - which, mercifully, means the food.   Each plate we tried was tasty - when it finally got to our table.   

* making a reservation was trying.  The worker seemed to discourage coming in; we should have listened to her. 
* One of our guests waited 45 minutes for his salads to arrive - actually having it served after the main course
* The bread ($3) took similarly long to migrate to the table and it took three requests to get butter.   
* The waiter was often AWOL visiting with his friends who stopped by.  
*  some of the portions were rather skimpy in light of the price and what can be had elsewhere.  
* The menu contained at least two incomplete descriptions of items which meant what arrived was not what was advertised.   

As they say, the devil IS in the details.   

(Second star for the food, IF you have the stamina for it)."}
{"text":"I remember stopping by here in the past for a few cocktails (OK--maybe more than that...), but I had no idea it was such a great lunch place! 

Dinner just HAS to be delish here because the lunch selections were decadent, rich and you could tell they were created with care. Yum! 

First off, the service for lunch was great! I thought I was getting a fancy dinner experience, but alas--it was still daytime. I will say that most of the options and specials were heavier than I was looking for, but I managed to find the pasta fagioli and the house salad. When I ordered my meal, the server mentioned that both options were larger portions and asked me if I wanted to get smaller sizes in either. Thinking a bowl of soup sounded great, I halfed the salad. Well, he wasn't kidding--this was no  average bowl of soup, oh no. This thing was HUGE! But it was also delicious and very filling. It had great, fresh, classic flavors and was perfection on a chilly day. 

The house salad was good--crisp romain, ripe tomatoes (don't know how these were good off season, but they were.) The only thing I wasn't so happy with was the dressing. It wasn't bad by any means, just a little too mustardy. I know all about adding dijon to vinaigrettes, but it just seemed like it was overkill. 

Other than that, this experience was fab and it's inspired me to come back and try dinner!"}
{"text":"It saddens to me to write this review. I have been raving about this place ever since I went here with friends last fall.  It's eclectic and there are usually plenty of vegetarian items on the menu. However, at this last visit, the food and service fell short.  I will say that my husband enjoyed his bouillabaisse, and my butter lettuce salad was sweet with just the right amount of tangyiness from the raspberry vinaigrette.  

But - our waitress did not know the menu well.  I don't expect you to know each and every single menu item. But I hate it when they say \"I think it has this...\"  rather than going back to check.  I ordered the summer risotto - what a mistake!  It was runny, overcooked, and had more vegetable scraps than expected.  So when I informed the waitress that it was not done well, she asked if I wanted to take it home....

Umm, no, I didn't like it all!  She got the point and then gave me back my menu.  I then ordered the cheese plate, which was very tasty.  Another waitress was assisting us at that point and she knew her stuff.

 And lastly, why did we only get one slice of bread to enjoy the delicious olive tapenade and the table next to us had a whole basket?  

This might sound nit-picky, but I was really looking forward to my dinner at Fat Cats and was just disappointed.  I didn't even want to check out the dessert menu. 

I will return once this experience fades from my mind, but next time, I need you to bring your A-game Fat Cats!"}
{"text":"First and last time here. The Bahn Bao (steamed buns) were very good but not worth the price paid, 2 for $8 :-(. The sweet potato fried shrimp, 3 small shrimp for $9, were heavy on sweet potato breading and very fishy smelling. The barbecue ribs were nothing to get excited over. Wanted to like the place but food fell flat."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my brother and wow, what a gem. The house is maximized for the most tables the atmosphere is great. They do have their own surface lot if you're lucky enough to nap a spot. The house sits on an overlook providing the best view in Tremont. We ordered the brussel sprouts, shrimp,  and my entree was the spring risotto. It was very good and the marscapone was a unique touch for the cheese. I highly recommend Fat Cats for the food and atmosphere inside and the view outside."}
{"text":"Located a little off the Tremont beaten path is probably the best restaurant the district has to offer. 

Fat Cats, to me, has the most interesting menu in Tremont and the best prices. What it may lack in that \"je ne sais quoi\" that some of the other restaurants in Tremont may have, it more than makes up for in charm, menu and price. 

From starters like grilled octopus or poached clams to kale salad or carrot soup, to pork belly sandwiches or Bavette Steak, Fat Cats has something for everyone. Daily specials are available for lunch and dinner, where you will always find a fresh fish selection straight from the West Side Market (ask if they have halibut). They also offer a great brunch on Saturdays and Sundays from 11-4. 

In an era of the Cleveland food scene where so many restaurants are really \"reaching\" to be different, and all for the sake of being different, Fat Cats stays their own course and consistently delivers what I believe to be the best food in Tremont."}
{"text":"As multiple Santas, inebriated and all largely 20 something, descended into Tremont recently I found myself caught up in the revelry with a tipsy, Santa hatted friend. She was hungry and everything was packed. The usual suspects- Edison's, Treehouse, Bario- were full to capacity so I suggested we head to Fat Cats. Success!
We were seated quickly and though packed, the service was excellent. The cute server from a visit several weeks ago remembered me and I felt like family. We had the braised mushroom app and crispy fries (with an egg on top). All were delicious. In the past I've had the specials and have never been disappointed. Prices were reasonable and drinks were cold and wet. I'll be back soon-"}
{"text":"Got off work in for happy hour so I thought I would try Fat Cats in Tremont.  Kind of off by itself at the North end of Tremont, but there is a great view of downtown.  The decor is relaxed, with some funky art in a nice old school building, with a compact covered patio next to the small parking lot.  

Sat at the bar, service was friendly and prompt.  The Happy Hour menu is diverse and has some nice choices.  I choose the Mussels, the Tempura Shrimp and the Sweet Potato Fries.  For $5 you get about 10 nice sized mussels in a nice garlic broth; not a huge portion but very tasty and well prepared with a perfect crostini to soak up the extra broth.  The sweet potato frites were a nice sized portion of various sized pieces of sweet potato lightly battered and fried and then served with an excellent tomato jam.  The best dish was the tempura shrimp which were two jumbo tail on shrimps with a crunchy batter served with a sweet and sour sauce that made the shrimp sing.  The portion is filling and the taste is excellent.

Overall the portions are not huge, but the food is very good.  Worth stopping in if you are near Tremont."}
{"text":"Ordered Bouillabaisse and calamari not on menu but in the bowl !"}
{"text":"I went out for some food and beers with a friend last night. We tried Tremont Taphouse then South Side and both places were packed and we didn't want to wait. I remembered seeing great reviews for Fat Cats and there was no wait so we decided to take a chance with a new place. We were 2 of the only 4 people sitting at the bar. The rest of the place was only half full at most. Within 10 minutes of being there it filled up quick and got a wait time for a table. We timed it perfectly. The decor looks like an old house converted to a bar/restaurant. The beer list was awesome. We started out with a Fat Heads Hop JuJu which is one of my favorite beers. The bartender was working her ass off yet still gave us great service for how crowded the place was. My friend got the burger which he said was great and I got the crispy whole fish. They weren't kidding when they said 'while' fish. It had the head tail and fins still on it. Perfect for me as I'm a avid fisherman. The fish was seared to perfection. It flaked easily and the skin just slid right off the meat. The sauce it was with was incredible to say the least, the perfect combo of sweet and spicy. It came with a risotto tasting type rice which was the perfect compliment. I can't wait to come back again and it will be soon too."}
{"text":"Went here for a happy hour last week. I really enjoyed the outdoor patio that we sat at. It was covered and had a decent amount of seats. I ordered the veggie burger off the happy hour menu and a house salad off the regular menu. I was surprised with how spicy the burger was, would definitely get something else next time. The service was also not the best. We were left waiting for our waitress to come back to our table several times."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere! Prices are reasonable as portions are diminutive. Will definitely come back for another try. Can't say anything really sticks with me as fabulous....."}
{"text":"I've been to fat cats twice, and I continue to be not quite satisfied. I got the pizza and salad this most recent time during happy hour, and it was just okay. The pizza was decent, but nothing to write home about. I don't like the bench vibe either, I want a chair with a back. I also had some really terrible white wine, and I've drank a lot of wine. I think it's the house white during happy hour. Definitely definitely skip that. 

The time before I did the Monday $30 deal and got the mixed seafood entree and a cocktail with some sort of chocolate dessert. It's not that the food was bad, but there are much better ways to spend $30 in CLE - like the Black Pig."}
{"text":"Gave us crostini and an olive oil balsamic blend to start. Bloody Mary's are refreshing but not too spicy. Great outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Excellent service; waitress paid close attention to giving us everything we needed without being pesky. I ordered from the happy hour menu and ordered a bread/tapenade and a pork belly bahn bao. The tapenade was very tasty, but the bahn bao was so good I ordered two more. Relaxing ambience, no extra noise, plenty of space, and quiet enough to talk."}
{"text":"Great happy hour location to enjoy patio weather while it lasts. We ordered the pancit as a starter and then a burger and the fish sandwich. The salmon cake was already flavorful and then once topped with avocado spread and aioli it became all the better!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adored the decor, the actual restaurant and food. Their happy hour is so great--$3-$6.50 for food and drinks and they have an incredible drink (one of my favorites) called the Aviation. There's a reason this place has stuck around so long--the food is incredible and is in a charming neighborhood. I wasn't super impressed with our server, who seemed rather annoyed to serve my friend and me on a Thursday at 4 pm, but that's happy hour time. Other than that, it was a great first experience for me and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Fat Cats has a nice casual aesthetic and a great brunch menu. It was the perfect place to meet up with friends. I got the chicken sandwich, which was crispy and flavorful! It comes with sweet potato fries. I would gladly eat here again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Cleveland and decided to stop in at Fat Cats after a recommendation from a local. We were just in time for happy hour and decided to order way too many of the small plates. My husband had a Kolsch beer and I had a pear cider. We tried the mixed greens, sweet potato fries, bahn bao (pork steamed bun), chickpea taco, spicy ribs, and mussels. Wow. We finished every bite. My husband's favorite was the bahn bao and mine was a two-way tie between the mussels and the ribs.

Our waitress (Amanda, I think?) was friendly and super helpful. The interior of the restaurant was intimate and relatively quiet for a weeknight happy hour. If we're ever in Cleveland again, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I waited too long to write this review, so some of the details have escaped me. Luckily, I took a few pictures while we were here for brunch!

The ambiance here was very laid back. Almost like you were going to a neighbor's house for a casual afternoon lunch. We sat outside because their patio is dog friendly. I drank a strawberry lemonade (dee-lish) and got a salad. I remember thinking 'wow, everything tastes so fresh!'. I like when things taste like they were freshly picked.

I've also been here for happy hour and they have some pretty great deals. Next time I go here, I am going to write a review right away so I can provide more details than the bare bones that this review is!"}
{"text":"I came here with my friends for brunch at around 1 PM last week. We called ahead to check the wait time, so we got a table right away which was great! Our server was very jovial and timely with our orders. First, we ordered the fried goat cheese + tomato crostinis and LOVED it. I think the tomato sauce was especially great and it was unlike any other tomato sauce I have had due to its slightly sweet nature- well worth the money. I am a vegetarian, so I decided to order the vegetarian breakfast burrito for my entree. I really enjoyed it! A bit greasy, but the cheese and vegetables in it were fresh and satisfying. Overall, great meal. Perhaps a little too overpriced due to the slight greasy-ness, but I would go here again for brunch if I get the chance."}
{"text":"I've been here many times for lunch over the years and once for dinner this past December. The food quality has been consistently great and the menu is very creative. I highly recommend the salmon and the Brussel sprouts. The service has also been consistently good here, even one time before Christmas when they were severely short-staffed  The waitstaff is knowledgeable and they check back with you frequently.  This is one of my favorite places to dine when I'm visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour and I have never been disappointed with the food. I had one of the best cocktails in recent memory there.

Great place for a date night or a family night."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Fat Cats this past weekend for the first time in years. Now I feel like kind of an idiot because it was so good! Food was excellent-everything was just spot on and richly flavored. It's like they've been doing it for 20 years or something  Service was lovely, our waitress in particular was awesome but everyone was very friendly. The cocktail menu was impressive, although being in a beer mood didn't try one. I'm saving that for my next visit, which is hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"Nice corner spot. Great view of the city from the big bay window. Happy hour food and drink deals are tough to beat in the area. This is where I had my first beer from the oldest brewery in the world. The staff is pleasant and helpful with any menu or drink questions. Strong byakko served at lunch, way to cure a case of the Monday's ! I've had the burger at happy hour and the ribs for lunch. Both plates were cleaned(:"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE- initially we were told our party of five could not be helped at all.... after hemming and hawing they finally agreed to seat us.... shorty thereafter, we watched other customers that were seated and ordered after us receive drinks within minutes.... we left after at least a twenty minute wait STILL without receiving anything we had ordered. Sincerely disappointed considering the owner was standing by- witnessed all this happening and still did not do anything about it."}
{"text":"I love this place. This is my second visit. We ate lunch here on a Sunday.  There is a dog friendly outdoor courtyard - lovely on a hot day - in the shade under the trees.

The food was fantastic and very reasonably priced. There are some really different and flavoursome things on the menu.  The octopus was perfectly cooked, not at all rubbery.  The calamari was lightly fried and not overdone.  The chicken salad had ingredients other than huge wedges of iceberg that is often served up as a salad.  The desserts are to die for, especially the bread pudding.  Yum, yum, yum.  All of this delivered thoughtfully, carefully and extremely politely by the lovely Hannah"}
{"text":"My husband and I are fairly new to Cleveland and as we were driving to this place, we were thinking...\"Where are we going?\" as you are pretty much driving through a neighborhood of residential homes. Once we arrived, I loved that the restaurant had it's own parking lot. Once inside, it was so nice and cozy. Sitting by a window table looking outside into the freezing cold gave a nice romantic setting, especially being it was after 9pm and it was quiet and peaceful. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. Their hamburger was very delicious and juicy. My husband had the steak which was cooked to perfection and was very good. We had the spiced creme brulee for dessert which is seasonal and had hints of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg in the mix. Also delicious. Another great gem found in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Fat Cats turned out to be a great place to go for lunch. The restaurant was fairly empty so we were seated quickly. The service was great; I was really pleasantly surprised with how friendly everyone was. 

The sweet potato leek soup is really good, but be forewarned: you get an entire bowl, not just a cup like I expected. It didn't stop me from gulping down the entire thing. I loved the way the subtle leek flavor rounded out the slight sweetness of the sweet potato. The fried sage on top was awesome, but I am on a huge sage kick at the moment (blame Thanksgiving).  My entree was the potato pancakes. Served in a stack of three, about the size of your palm, they were crispy on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside. Topped with a delicious apple chutney and creamy goat cheese and cold smoked salmon on the side. All of the flavors meshed really well together: the saltiness of the pancake, the sweetness of the apple, the creamy tartness of the goat cheese and the smokiness of the salmon. 

I'll definitely be back to try some of the other delicious looking options on the menu. Omelette with pomme frites? Yes, please!"}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of discovering the joy of Fat Cats today! Such an amazing all around dining experience! The exterior is \"Tremont Trendy\" aka artsy shabby chic. The interior is just as charming as well as the outdoor patio area. The table we were sat at had a beautiful partial view of down town and a very active bird feeder that provided entertainment during our meal. We fully enjoyed the casual, warm and friendly environment. There was SO much that looked so delicious in the menu so we elected to do a sampling of several dishes. The grilled octopus is a MUST try... even if you are a person who has \"texture issues\" with some foods. The dish was so perfectly balanced with all the flavors. The octopus was not chewy and had a perfect charred flavor from grilling. The fresh lemon, cilantro and avocado provided a fresh and zingy flavor that complimented the octopus perfectly. The cashews added an extra crunch and meatiness that just made the dish that more amazing. They had sweat breads listed as one of their specials today... my goodness! What a treat!! Once again grilled perfectly, not too heavy, great flavors and the accompanying sauce which included onion and bacon just made the whole dish sing! We had the crispy chicken wings. They were tender and crispy with such a great flavor. Very close to the wings at Greenhouse Tavern. The pork belly Bao Bun was soft and pillowy. The pork was dry almost crusty on the outside which sealed in the juices to make it extra flavorful on the inside. Lastly, the pork rib was fall off the bone juicy, with a similar crust on the outside keeping all that goodness inside the meat. Finished with their homemade soy apricot BBQ sauce... oh my! Everything came out very quickly too! The waitstaff was friendly, attentive and informative. It is VERY rare that you go somewhere and EVERY dish is spot on perfect, Fat Cats was able to achieve just that. We will definitely be back and often!! Thank you for such a great experience!!"}
{"text":"My \"go to\" place in Cleveland. Period. It's casual comfort and wonderfully executed and evolving and revolving menu make it a treat every time. If you want to wine and dine or just unwind, this place can and will deliver. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Where are my patio people at? Because, you should be at Fat Cats. Grab a drink off the speciality cocktail menu (I recommend The Fat Cat!) and treat yourself.

Fat Cats has this modest, chic Cleveland vibe that adds so much character to the Tremont neighborhood. Stop by on Monday and do their special 3 courses for $25...because the food is so absolutely outstanding, that its worthy of 3 courses. The portions are very generous, so get ready for an American fare food coma. 

The service is very attentive, and the servers are very knowledgable about the menu. I always appreciate their suggestions, and they've never steered me wrong! Try the Steak & Frites or the Butternut Squash Risotto, and I guarantee you'll be back again."}
{"text":"Honestly, not that impressed.

Had empanadas that were not that hot or flaky. Mac and cheese was just very heavy. Fish dish was just ok as well.

Very cramped environment and small tables. Very noisy as well due to hardwood floors."}
{"text":"The happy hour at Fat Cats makes me happy.  I dropped in yesterday with my boyfriend and got a delicious Moscow Mule for $5 and he got a Newcastle for $2.50.  We ordered a smorgasbord of appetizers to share.

Salad - $2.50 - nice petite little salad with great dressing

Squash pierogis - 2 for $3, so a little pricey but they were delicious

Fried zucchini - $3 - nice little portion of fried goodness with a good sauce on the side

My boyfriend had duck dumplings (which he loved) and the happy hour fried shrimp special.  Although he only  got two \"shrimps\" as we like to call them, he thought they were extremely good.  (he said he could have eaten a dozen more)

There were a couple other vegetarian items on the menu - fries, a pizza, and something else that I'm forgetting.  My server wasn't sure if the pierogis I ordered were vegetarian, and she happily asked the chef before I ordered.  

I think I love Fat Cats just as much as I love its sister restaurants Lava Lounge and Felice.  The converted house setting makes it kind of funky and cool.  And just like those other restaurants, I'd love to come back and eat a full meal."}
{"text":"Nice dinner with my hubby. Window seat and nice drinks- try the \"Out Cold\" drink it is served warm! Stop by!"}
{"text":"Next time your HOT for Cleveland - check into Fat Cats - this place rocks!"}
{"text":"My 100th review, yay! :D

This is another one of those places that I've been to quite a few times but haven't really gotten around to reviewing.  I would say it is a little hidden gem in Tremont - it's very tasty food that's relatively inexpensive, and you'll most certainly drive right past the restaurant the first time you go looking for it.  Really, on the exterior it looks like a house.

I've tried a number of their specials as well as their duck confit and the barbeque ribs, and nothing has disappointed me.  Every entree is relatively cheap for tremont (~$17), but the portion sizes are good and the food is delicious.  Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"One of the best places to go for happy hour in Tremont. Their happy hour food menu has many selections and it's all delicious."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum yum yum yum. Came here on a lark last Friday (after seeing it turn up in my Yelp list for nearby restaurants). I loved the informal decor and friendly wait staff. I started out with the goat cheese and lamb empanadas. I'm not usually (read: never) a fan of lamb, but these empanadas might have made me a believer. They were cooked perfectly and just the right size. So delicious.

Next, I had one of the day's specials: Pork Belly Tacos. They were served with fennel, curry rice, sour cream, and cilantro. The pork belly was super tender, flavorful, and juicy. Kind of a pain in the ass to eat (I'm a bit OCD when it comes to food, not a big fan of messy). But in the end, my efforts paid off: I cleaned my plate.

I would definitely recommend hitting up this little Tremont gem. Looked perfect for a date spot, happy hour (full bar), brunch, etc. Wish I could have had more time to explore the area! Sounds like Cleveland's got a rockin little foodie scene!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for brunch this Sunday, and it was a pleasant and very filling experience. The pancit was an interesting take on a traditional Filipino dish. It was tasty and the barbecue pork belly was a nice touch. They had a decent amount of vegetarian options as well, and unlimited table bread if you ask for it! You can get a mimosa kit for $30, which seemed like a pretty good deal, but we weren't in the mood for alcohol. I definitely enjoyed the brunch options here, and I'd go again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Interesting place. We came here for happy hour and sat at the bar for a while before getting a table. The bar is small and the tables are fairly close together because it's in an old house. 

They had a few draft beers and some good specials on domestics. We tried food from the happy hour menu only. The food on this menu is very small bites. Prices are around $5 but again very small portions. 

The food was all very good. My standouts were the pork belly pancit and the fried shrimp. The pork belly was very tender and had a nice glaze on it. It was served over super thin noodles. We ordered it again it was so good. The fried shrimp had excellent flavor and was cooked perfectly. These were 2 jumbo sized shrimp."}
{"text":"Quite the hidden gem!

This is a funky cool and really tasty restaurant. We visited on a weeknight, so the restaurant was only ~30% full and we were seated immediately. The atmosphere was quite cozy. It's a converted Tremont house, nice dim lighting, Cleveland skyline views, but artsy touches here and there. The waiter quickly came over, ran through the menu and explained the  specials and helped us decide what to eat. We started with appetizers of calamari and mussels. The calamari were 5/5, best I've ever had, perfectly breaded and fried in a way that made them taste like well seasoned seafood and not defrosted rubber. Highly recommended! The mussels were good too, but not as good as the calamari. For entrees, we ordered the lamb, pork chop, and ribs. Mmmmmm, so good!!! The lamb was subtly seasoned, but tenderly cooked and we enjoyed it oh so much! Pork chops and ribs were also delicious, and I'd have them again, but they werent out of this world yummy like the lamb. We ended with a shared apple crumble dessert (truthfully, the desserts options werent that appealing). The apple crumble wasn't horrible, but dessert is definitely not their forte. Thant being said, we really enjoyed our experience! Great food, very attentive staff, nice cozy, yet funky, atmosphere, we'd return in a heartbeat!

Recommended for: Date night, good American food, hungry people (good portion sizes), good service
Not recommended for: dessert, larger groups"}
{"text":"At 19, Fat Cats is a remarkably well-preserved treasure. Keep it safe from the rabble if you will, dear reader: it was Foodie before Foodie was a thing. The vegetation nachos were an exquisite mashup of spicy and sweet, and served up quite quickly. So too were the vegan tacos in a world all their own--the transcendent zing of jalapeño melding with wholesome eggplant goodness--impressive even when compared to the quotidian Cleveland taco (you know who you are). Finally, the cocktails were insanely satisfying. Try the What's Up Tiger Lilly ($10). Sweet, crisp, and beguiling, it's an ideal summer refresher. Bar seating was ample on Friday night, probably because this place is rather off the beaten path. A sacred little outpost of gustatory bliss. It's the perfect spot for a date or for those of us sick to death of the main drag establishments. It's stalwart. It's classy. Just shhhh... don't let the regulars hear us talking. They'd rather keep it all for themselves. But we'll just have a taste. And we'll tip well. Just let us share in the experience."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I totally appreciate that they always have at least two significant entrees that are vegetarian (i.e. cashew crusted tofu, spring roasted vegetables, crispy polenta...) and several vegetarian appetizers (i.e. tofu steam buns, mushroom tart, crispy Brussels sprouts...). They even have a vegan menu if you ask for it! I also love that the walls are adorned with local art, many of their ingredients are local, the bartenders are all great to talk to, and the specialty drinks are expertly crafted and delicious. My husband and I eat here a couple of times a month and have never had a bad experience (and he says the non-vegetarian food is good, too)."}
{"text":"I've been dreading writing this review... I just really wanted to like Fat Cats! And when I didn't I was pretty bummed. I went here for a dinner date (so I didn't take photos, wah!) and ended up getting to try the ginger beer, crispy brussel sprouts, pork belly bahn bao, and a pizza that was a special. The brussel sprouts were good actually, which is great considering I don't like brussel sprouts really! The pork belly bahn bao was unmemorable. Even now looking back I don't even have words to describe it because I just didn't really feel anything when I ate it. 

But now for the worst part... the pizza special was disgusting. It had all the ingredient descriptions to be great. What stood out and made us order it was that it had a fresh fish on it, trout if I remember correctly. Oh my god. It was the grossest, rotten, fishiest flavor ever. BLECH. I'm getting disgusted just thinking about it. Fortunately my dinner companion agreed and we did not finish the pizza. I can't see myself returning to eat. How can a professional prepare and serve fish without noticing how barf-worthy it is prior? It had to smell..."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I've been three times. The food has been great. From seafood stew to the fish sandwich and salmon tacos, this place rocks. The service was also very good. We had lunch there all three times and the place was really busy. The kitchen and wait staff really kicked butt, though. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite type of place: friendly, genuine, local, authentic, sophisticated, and casual. I was there for lunch by myself recently, and sat outside on the patio, which was gorgeous. My server was a super nice woman who complimented my backpack and gave great service (warning me away from a double or triple IPA that was on the menu - she said if I had that with lunch I wouldn't be doing much else that day). 

I had a salmon entrée which was cooked absolutely perfectly, just on the rarer end of the spectrum and moist, with delicious crunchy skin. It was on a little polenta cake and grilled peppers with grilled jalapeño, and a strawberry on top which at first I found slightly incongruous but wound up thoroughly enjoying. 

Fat Cats is a definite gem."}
{"text":"I went to Fat Cats with my sister because of all the positive reviews. We wanted to take advantage of happy hour and outdoor seating since it was a nice and warm day. The moment we parked we noticed an awful pungent smell coming from the dumpster that is located feet away from the outdoor patio. So outdoors sitting was out - a disappointment.

Inside the atmosphere is relaxed, but maybe a bit too relaxed considering our waitress wore a dirty grey t-shirt. I ordered a Moscow mule (6.50 during happy hour - great deal) but 5 min later was told they were out of ginger beer. They wouldn't give us a HH price for drinks on regular menu despite not being able to deliver what we ordered on the first place. But ok, on to food.

We waited for about 20min for food to arrive. My sister had fried chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries. Sandwich was amazing! Fresh, crunchy, spicy with perfect compliment of coleslaw. Fries were just OK. I had risotto and tempura shrimp. Risotto was creamy and well done but lacked savory richness of Parmesan. Tempura shrimp was absolutely awful! It smelled like chlorine and tasted like cardboard. Clearly it was old and frozen shrimp. 
Is three stars too generous?"}
{"text":"The ribs were so good! The salmon was on point. I had a lot of guilt because I didn't know that I could've brought my dog because they had a menu for dogs!! Ahhh! That was def special. The customer service was amazing."}
{"text":"Fat Cats is a really great restaurant in Tremont. The food has always been phenomenal and the staff is polite and knowledgeable. I highly recommend this place, the menu is great and the atmosphere is awesome!"}
{"text":"Normally love this restaurant but tonight I ordered the kale salad and it was not up to par. Told the waiter and nobody came to say anything and didn't acknowledge. Will be back but this made me feel bad about tonight.service was very slow. Waited a half hour for first glass of wine."}
{"text":"I have always heard people talk about fat cats but I have never had the chance to go. Weird I know since I'm obsessed with all Cleveland restaurants.  We were celebrating my friends birthday and we got a table in the far back room and since there was eight of us we had it to our selves. Even though the waiter had not tried anything on the new menu so he couldn't give us any pointers on what to eat and when we asked about the seafood he said he didn't like seafood so we kind of just ordered a little bit of everything and we were not disappointed to say the least. We started off as appetizers with the brussels sprouts the fried Bree and the calamari. Now whenever I go to new restaurants I always order either the muscles or the calamari because those are my obsessions and restaurants do either very well With them or they taste like rubber. Luckily I hit the jackpot. These were the most flavorful tender calamari I've ever had and I cannot wait to go back and get more. But forget the appetizers let's talk about the entries. I had the burger with a fried egg on it and I was licking my plate.  The only thing I did not quite like for my meal were the fries. They were shoestring fries but more like a hash brown. They are very hard to eat and just didn't satisfy my burger meal. Others had the mac & cheese in the salmon and the steak. Everything was absolutely delicious and I cannot wait to go back for more"}
{"text":"The menu was interesting, but the meals produced were just okay (especially for the prices, my big pet peeve...I want to get what I pay for).

I got the rack o' ribs and my boyfriend got mac n' cheese. Neither of us liked them so we switched meals, but in the end, neither of us was thrilled anyway. I wasn't even thrilled with the service, either.

 I feel like it may have been an off-night, and this seems like a neat place that people love, so I may be back to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Fat Cats has everything you could want in a happy hour - great drink deals, generous food options, and incredible service! It is low key and certainly doesn't have the stuffy feel of other big places in this neighborhood and it also doesn't compromise on quality. We celebrate all of our big coworker life events here and we are always treated well."}
{"text":"Our top 5 brunch place in Cleveland...maybe top 2. Fresh/organic offerings - they have their own garden.  Musts: Brussels sprouts, ham/cheese sandwich!"}
{"text":"When I pulled up to the place -- after I found it -- I was wondering what I had gotten myself into! But the client recommended it and he's local. I gave it a shot.

Oh, happy day!

An INCREDIBLY friendly waitstaff started us off in this quirky and tiny establishment. They knew their stuff and were happy to make suggestions, yet blended in with the decor and never interrupted at odd moments.

The food was great. I had the special (I always get a special) of linguini and clams. Outstanding. And good portions, too. Not so much that you feel stuffed. And not so tiny that you feel compelled to order desert. Twice.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My first time and definitely will not be my last! We stopped in on a Monday night and got the Monday special: 3 courses for $25!! 

 The complimentary bread and olive Tapenade is amazing, such fresh olives!!! Only thing keeping me from 5 stars is my bite had a pit fragment that I but into... if my tooth wasn't throbbing for the remainder of the night  I wouldn't have mentioned it. Lol 

As an appetizer we got the fried Brussel sprouts that were absolutely amazing and portion sizes were more than fair! We also ordered a cup of the squash soup which was light and creamy with a subtle sweet taste of coconut (to die for).
As an entree we ordered the Mac and cheese which was out of this world. The grape jam and breadcrumbs  pulled it all together!!!

We were so full that we had to take the dessert to go.  But I'm sure it will be absolutely amazing!!!!

 (We decided on the lemon cheesecake)"}
{"text":"Had an amazing omelette one morning for brunch and I have already recommend Fat Cats to my friends.  Rising Star coffee is a definite plus as well!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Happy Hour which is awesome. I'd give it a 4.5 if I could. During the week its 4-7 and throughout the whole restaurant, not just bar. We split a bunch of things including the pork bun, tempura shrimp, mixed greens, ribs and spicy fried chicken sandwich. All were very good, my favorite probably being the sandwich and pork bun. 
Service great, drinks great, cute ambiance. Will definitely be back. If I loved closer could def  see myself becoming a regular! 
Next I wanna try their brunch!"}
{"text":"Visiting from California and found this awesome spot. The food is killer, and they have some awesome beers! Fried chicken sando with that slaw.... daaammnnnn!"}
{"text":"LURRRVV this place.

I have been here a bunch of times, and each time I've found that the menu has changed! I like that they switch things up every so often, and while the mac n cheese is no longer on the menu (my favorite thing), when I asked the waitress about it she said they could make it for me anyway!! CHA CHING!

I've had tons of stuff from this menu. Stand outs include the butternut squash and goat cheese pizza, the thin french fries with a fried egg on top, and the tofu entree. 

Dessert is phenomenal as well. I'm partial to the bread pudding.

The staff here is AMAZING. They are super friendly and accommodating to ANY request. I want to be their BFF.

In short, HIGHLY recommend!!"}
{"text":"A gem of the Cleveland dining scene!  The menu, while not especially exhaustive, has something for every taste; and every offering at least grazes perfection. 
The dining room and bar exude an easy charm. The overall atmosphere is relaxed and informal. 
Service is friendly and attentive, without being intrusive or annoying. Servers are well versed on the menu, and able to give reliable recommendations.
Great food, great service, great atmosphere!  One of my favorite restaurants, period!
Be sure to check out the \"Fat Monday\" special: any appetizer, any entree, and any dessert for $25."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, tasty tasty food and terrific service. Very solicitous of my picky children!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  Always had a good meal, decent selection and portion size.  Great place for an intimate experience, but wouldn't let the group size get too big and overload the kitchen."}
{"text":"This is the best hidden gem in Cleveland! To be very honest, my Mom made the reservation for family dinner and I was surprised because I had never heard of the restaurant! Side note, I was born and raised in Cleveland so that's embarrassing that I didn't even know the name!! Boy have I been missing out on the great menu at Fat Cats!! 

Our server Macklin was on point! He was proactive and extremely attentive! We didn't have to ask for a thing!  Thank you Macklin for enhancing our evening!!

We started with a beautiful bottle of Pinot from Oregon, which was delicious!  Our apps were roasted Brussels, calamari, and truffle mushrooms. They all were extremely flavorful and yummy. Three of the gentlemen ordered the ribs and all were very satisfied! The meat fell off the bone pretty much! I had the Thai peanut chicken bowl which was so tasty with a kick from jalapeños. Yum!!! My mom had the sweet potato tacos (vegan) and absolutely loved them!!!  We finished with the Lemon Lavendar creme brûlée and the Lemon Cheesecake. I just about died from the amazing flavor!! If you like lemon, I would absolutely order both of these!

The night was perfect, except for my lack of photos! I attribute that to being so pleased with each course! Can't wait to come back on our next trip home!!"}
{"text":"Went to Fat Cats for their happy hour and I was very pleased and satisfied! I had the tofu bahn mi and it had all the right flavors and spices to make it amazing!! The happy hour dish doesn't come with the sweet potato fries so I ordered it separately and it was crispy and not too salty (they have this chili sauce that comes with it, that made it more amazing!)

A friend ordered the ribs and burger and it was satisfying for him as well! Great taste and great deal!! Loved the atmosphere and good service. Small place so try to get a reservation!!

Would recommend two plates from the happy hour menu, or get a bunch and do family style! Overall great experience"}
{"text":"So this was the third time at fatcats and out of the four of us tonight, 2 had good meals and two were just okay. The two folks with the bouillibase & the ribs were happy. The mac & cheese was just so-so and I had the hanger steak which would have been great if the homemade steak sauce had not been ice cold on a rare steak. If I wanted steak tartare I would have ordered it. Part of the reason I ordered the hanger steak was for the blue cheese tater tots, they sounded great, imagine my surprise when all I received was 2 tots ! My final complaint was with regards to the two vodka martinis that I had, I would think with an $11 martini, I wouldn't be charged an extra $.50 for freakin olives... Really? 

Not too sure I'll ever be back to fatcats. If it was only one thing I might be able to handle it, but all of it together, not a great experience tonight."}
{"text":"Located in a nook in Tremont, Fat Cats has a simplistic menu, which I was not overly impressed by. I have heard wonderful things about about their happy hour menu, which I am dying to try to give this place a second chance. I dined here during late brunch hours, with only a handful of people inside. The seating style is pincic-esqu at the bottom, and other varying table sizes up the three steps. The casual ambiance and decor is trendy, yet casual to allow for visitors to come from any event. Nothing really popped out at me as tasty, so I went with the french toast. With ordering that, and my friend with a breakfast sandwich, it took almost 45 plus minutes, which I found absurd.  Our waitress was not overly attentive, which could have possibly softened the amount of time it had taken for our food to come. I am hoping to come back in the future and give this place a second shot."}
{"text":"I would like to go 3.5 stars as quality and taste seem to be pretty hit or miss. But when it's a hit, it's a hit. Plus, they have a GREAT happy hour. Definitely a must-try for happy hour. 

Atmosphere is casual and quaint. At some places it's very dark and others cold. To have a good experience here, in my opinion, seating matters. I've eaten at the bar twice and that was a good experience I was able to talk to other people there and had a great time. The two other times I've been there with more than myself I was seated at a small two top right above the stairs (really liked this table) . It was in the \"main dining room\" nice spot. The second time we were seated in the back dining room next to the door in the dead of winter. It was freezing but there was no where else for us. It was not a great experience. 

I would recommend the warm goat cheese. I've now had it three times. I crave it. However, after the last time I got it -- I probably won't order it again. What usually comes out as a warm toasty goat cheese served with toast points, came to me as a very over cooked and broken up goat cheese ball with un-toasted cuts of bread (some of which were even soggy). I didn't mention it b/c I was the only one in there on  a dead night during the crazy awful winter weather. Regardless, it is usually quite tasty. 

I've tried many menu items as has my boyfriend. He's had the hanger steak twice. Loved it once and didn't like it the second time. I have had the mac and cheese twice. I've thought it \"meh\" both times. I want to love it and love all the ingredients. Somehow it just doesn't come together for me. I think they use too much cheese (not sure that's possible) when weighed against the other ingredients. So the balance of flavors really isn't there. The small greens salad is good -- casual typical greens salads. I tried the white bean soup and sent it back --- it really didn't taste like anything even after I added mounds of pepper to it. They were very nice and took it off the bill. They also don't always have a chocolate dessert on their menu. One time out of 4 they have had one --- to me this is a huge disappointment. I love dessert but will only do chocolate desserts (which makes sense in my head) . 

Overall, it's a nice place to go and grab a few happy hour drinks and enjoy a night out. However --- make sure you check the \"featured drinks\" menu pricing as some can be pretty steep (like 12 bucks for a martini) which in my mind is a lot when your food isn't far more expensive. Service is generally attentive and not pushy. It's a great little spot."}
{"text":"I have no clue how I never knew this place existed. Stopped in for happy hour/dinner with some girl friends after work and it was a great first experience. The food was delicious, the drinks were good and the service as good as well. The curb side appeal is a little off for me but maybe that is part of the look. One thing that I wasn't a fan of was parking, I had to park on the street and walk in the rain."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the food at Fat Cats but last night the service was really subpar. 

I met a friend before dinner shortly before 8 pm. By 8, we placed our dinner orders. At 8:45, we still didn't have our entrees and our server had not checked in to apologize for the wait or let us know the food would be out soon. The restaurant was busy but not on a wait. I didn't understand what took so long for tofu and a burger. 

After waiting 50 minutes, we finally got our food. My tofu and quinoa was very good, but quite small. 

The big offense was that my friend's burger and fries, while properly cooked to medium, was completely cold. Not even luke warm. 

It took the server another 10 minutes to check on our food. We politely alerted her that my friend's dish was cold. She offered to have the kitchen remake it - but by then we had been there over an hour, it was 9 pm, my friend was very hungry, and my small entree was almost gone. 

We asked for fresh fries. Instead of the sweet potato friends my friend ordered, she got regular fries which were more like tiny fried matchstick crisps with no potato consistency. The server didn't notice the error, didn't apologize for the wait, didn't comp the cold food, and didn't so much offer a complimentary dessert or drink. Very disappointed in this neighborhood restaurant competing in a city with tons of great local options."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I ate here with fellow yelper Joyce P. and other non-Cleveland guests.

Fat Cats is in a cool part of Tremont. What? I almost drove by it without stopping. It looks like it's in a house! Classic of Tremont.

The bread with the balsamic and olives were indeed good- I liked it.

I ordered the rigatoni special. The noodles were done okay (a little hard) and the meat was okay...I just wanted some kick to it. Pizazz. Ba da boom. Something of that sort. It was good though...just not \"omg, I'm in foodie heaven.\"

My other friends ordered the bouillabaise and polenta- and they weren't too happy with their dish. The guy next to me ordered duck breast- I think he liked it? And the girl next to him ordered the pork belly- and about died with the spice level.

So I think the quality of the food is okay, the menu selection is great though. I think we just had an off night....and chose way too random of dishes.

I mean, this place is a cool place. Nonetheless, I want to give it another try...."}
{"text":"Been to Fat Cats a couple times and it never disappoints. The bread & tapenade and the pork steam buns on the happy hour menu ($3 each) are what dreams are made of. Happy hour is Mon- Fri 4-7. Basically, be there or be square."}
{"text":"New to Cleveland and found this spot driving around Tremont. Had a fantastic experience! Delicious food, friendly staff, great patio and legit music selection. Our official new favorite brunch spot! A definite 'don't miss!'"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Staff is really friendly and fast service! Extra love for the dog friendly patio. Our two pups loved it and they love the meals we got them off the doggie menu!"}
{"text":"I just came back from Fat Cats on a wintry March night.  It was pretty quiet in there because of a snowstorm, so we were able to sit easily without the reservation I had called in.  It's a pretty cool set-up -- a converted house with a bar at the front and two nice back rooms with fantastic views of downtown Cleveland that looked great at night (all the skyscrapers were lit up).

Our server was very friendly and helpful.  She was definitely on top of refilling our drinks.  We thought it was pretty funny, though, that they only gave us one slice of bread at a time, and then replaced it, instead of giving us a basket.  It was a good thing though, because we would have eaten much more with the olive, vinegar, mushroom concoction that came with the bread, which was fantastic.

We both had the Angus burger with pommes frites.  Fantastic portion and fantastic flavor.  The dessert was a banana nut bread pudding with peanut butter and chocolate sauce and ice cream, and it was delectable.

Overall, between the ambience, waitstaff, and food, this is a place I'd heartily recommend.  It's a tad pricier than what you might expect for American cuisine, but imo it's worth it."}
{"text":"Finally made my way to Fat Cats for lunch, and totally lived up to the hype. I'm a vegetarian, so when I go out with I group I often end up stuck with the one random vegetarian dish on the menu. Fat Cats had multiple great vegetarian options, so I was thrilled. Got the tofu steamed buns and the crispy polenta, which made for a gluttonous but delicious lunch. That plus a soda and tip only ran me $25, which was great given the quality of the food. Also appreciate the little environmentally conscious touches, like no drinking straws. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"four star for the lemon brûlée there. Don't order the sweet potato fries there, they don't even taste like sweet potato anymore."}
{"text":"Everything was terrific. The service, the interesting collection of offerings & the fixed price Monday Specials all made for a great evening out with friends. Chef Sandoval knows his stuff. The hanger steak was perfect. The tofu banh bao were just as good if not better than the pork belly version.
My husband raved about the mussel appetizer. No doubt about it. Fat Cats made a great 1st impression and 4 repeat customers!!"}
{"text":"Fat Cats may be my new favorite brunch spot! And it's on Saturday only, leaving room for ANOTHER brunch on Sunday!

The Bloody Mary's were very spicy, the mimosas were made with real juice and they had a spiked coffee drink that also looked delicious!

The regular menu was diverse and everything looked delicious. I settled on the steak and eggs (my go-to) and it was fantastic. We had the pork steam bums to start and they were definitely the best part of the meal! 

They have weekly specials that also looked great -- everything from salmon to savory stuff like waffles. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I live right across the street from Fat Cats and have only been there a handful of times. I ate there tonight for a happy hour/dinner. A great place to eat. I feel like I have been wasting my time by not coming here. The people who work there are a pleasure to talk with. The mini burgers at $4 for a pair is a deal. The lamb and goat cheese empanadas are $3. Import beers are $3, domestic $2. The ribs at happy hour are also good. I have not shelled out for a full price entree. That day is soon coming and I will report back with an update."}
{"text":"The tofu sandwich is disgusting. Basically, a full block of tofu that is not marinated or pressed properly deep fried. It's an insult to tofu lovers everywhere."}
{"text":"Mushroom, cream cheese, and crostini was awesome.  

Octopus is good, I like the acidity that accents the fresh avocado and the char of the octopus.  The octopus wasn't just large pieces of the legs? Tentacles...lol?  They were more of the full octopus but smaller, bigger than calamari but similar.  So that can throw you off, I dont mind it but I also don't like to eat a ton of them... so just a heads up.  

I got the mac n cheese with cauliflower and chicken and I thought it was really good, it comes with a tomato jam which I'm usually not that into but it was good and a bit smokey flavored.  My husband got the ribs he said the sauce was good but they were a little on the fatty side.  He was pretty excited about the horseshoe string fries.  I couldn't help but just have \"one\" as well.  Which really equates to a handful on accident because they were delicious.  

How could I forget, the bread that got the party started... good bread with olive tapenade on top of olive oil and balsamic.   

Overall fun atmosphere, great views of downtown when you are headed out.  We had a good time!"}
{"text":"I got a crab melt here, I'm not some sort of sandwich lover, but it was THE SH*T. I wish it was a never-ending crab melt. I would have eaten it for hours if I could've. I never thought I could be excited over a sandwich. It came with a salad, also something I'm not super enthusiastic about normally, but damn, really fresh and good. THEN I had lemon cheesecake, totally worth it. I'm obviously overeating at this point, but it was important that I try everything, plus Monday is \"Fat Monday\" which means 3 course meal for $25."}
{"text":"The salmon special was great - it was served cooked perfectly on a bed of black beans with a side of lightly breaded zucchini. I was a fan of this entree. The soup special - a chicken curry soup - was a very large portion. It was made up mostly of white noodles, but I ate out the chicken and mushrooms and enjoyed the very flavourful broth. The drink bourbon something (can't remember the full name - it was on the bottom of the drink menu) is also a very good light drink to compliment any meal. Good service from the waitress - a bit slow from the kitchen. The place was full on a Wednesday night. We took the last 2 top table leaving only 2 sets of 2 seats open at the bar. Make a reservation. There is a small oddly shaped parking lot but a lot of free street parking"}
{"text":"This is another of my Cleveland favs. The converted house makes a cozy, funky atmosphere.  The patio could use a little upgrading.  The plastic lawn chairs seemed a little trail or trash for a nice restaurant. 

The sweet potato shrimp appetizer is amazing! But the dipping oil/garlic/olive/balsamic is even better. Utterly incredible! I had the hangar steak and enjoyed every bite.  There was also a blue cheese tater tot which was a bit strong but also quite delicious.  Give the place a try!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant that changes the menu frequently. Been coming here for years and can't say enough wonderful things. Well stocked bar and bartenders who know how to make a cocktail! 
Happy hours are a blast with folks from the Tremont neighborhood. 
Under appreciated at lunch times, great place to stop in and grab a bite."}
{"text":"What an interesting place!

I came here with the bf on his birthday, because we were intending on going for sushi nearby -- but he was too hungry to wait over 1hr for a seat at their sushi bar.  So we called the other hot spots nearby to see how long the waits were.  They quoted us 30 mins here, so we ended up walking a couple of blocks... finding the location... and wondering if we made a mistake.

We walked in, they lost our reservation, they asked us to wait 30 mins at the bar... 30 mins became 40, which then became 50.  During the wait, the bartender was super busy... she took foever to take our order, and my drink had just arrived when our table was set. 

Given how the night was going, I had low expectations, but it is a restaurant after all... the most important factor = food.  The food was delicious!  We ordered the Brussel sprouts as appetizer... roasted with bacon and jalapenos.  Yummy!  He got the whole red snapper, crisped, with an amazing sauce that we dipped everything into.  I probably ate a good quarter of it, and I don't even like fish!  I got the hanger steak which was a little bit of a let down.  It came out cold.  But it was at least cooked to a perfect medium rare (before letting it sit and get cold), and seasoned wonderfully.  For dessert, the fallen chocolate cake was a delectable end to the meal.

They lost our reservation, the wait was much longer than promised, the service was super slow (but friendly) all night long.  The room was freezing cold and they refused to adjust the thermostat. But I'll overlook all that on this occasion given they gave me and my honey a great birthday meal.

-----------------------------------
Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"Hands down, best happy hour in the city! Service can be a bit slow, but for the quality of the food, I never even mind. The tapenade is a must-have for an appetizer!"}
{"text":"Kind of empty the few times I've been here.  I hope I'm just going at off times because this place is fantastic!

OMG!  Best deal ever!  Mondays are $25 any 3-course meal (except the cheese plate appetizer).  All of our food was delicious: sweetbreads, steamed clams, and empanadas, followed by 4 excellent entrees: scallops, lamb chops, short ribs, and the hanger steak, which was outstanding.  Dessert, less memorable but hey, it's only $25!

I like the Fat Cats vibe -- nice but casual, kind of bohemian and not as pretentious as some of the Tremont restaurants.  Not that I don't also love pretension ( I yelp, after all), but it's nice to have options.  Fat Cats is giving Monday night Wing Night at the Winking Lizard a run for it's money."}
{"text":"Fat Cats is a cool, quaint place to grab a bite to eat. Their menu is not very large but everything I've had there tasted excellent. 

If you're planning to get dinner downtown before a Cavs/Indians game, you should definitely hit this place up. It's usually not too busy and it's only about a 7 minute drive to the Gateway district. 

Plus, you can snap some great pictures of downtown from there."}
{"text":"Don't be stupid: this place is a win whatever you're looking for.  Chef-owner Ricardo Sandoval is likely cooking, the menu shifts with the seasons, great specials, locally sourced foods, great bar, brunch to die for, great servers. 

Can get loud with happiness. Handles babies well. 

I'd tell you what's good, but it all is. Cooks seafood perfectly so go for it. Tomato jam is amazing--sub it on the potato pancakes any time. 

Seriously, stop reading, mark this as \"helpful\" or whatever, go here, thank me later."}
{"text":"Quality food and always nice for lunch. The pasta fagioli seems to be a bit inconsistent. In the several times I have been here it ranges from very good to basically tasteless and mediocre. The roasted Brussels sprouts with apple is a winner!

I love that they have their own garden on premise and use these fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"This is a little place with really good food. The hangar steak with special sauce on it is excellent. Decent prices....portion are not real big. Definitely worth a visit."}
