{"text":"I found the food very greasy and heavy for my taste. Some of it did taste very well but I found a lot of it overly greasy. I really dislike having a film of oil on my lips. 

We had a big group we had the dinner for 8. I thought everything was fairly average. I did not like the dumplings they were large in size but so oily. The salt and pepper squid was really salty and the squid tasted off. It tasted like bad fish to put it bluntly. I ate two pieces and refused to eat any more. 

I got a wicked headache. I'm pretty sensitive to food so I'm guessing it would guess it was something in the food maybe all the salt and oil my body is not used to. If I had to pick a \"favourite\" dish I would say the beef and broccoli was pretty good. I don't know if I would come back. It has parking which is nice but the stalls are pretty tight."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to go to for fresh delicious Chinese food in Calgary!! We've tried so many... greasy salty not fresh.. Finally found this gem on 16th and 10th nw.. our wonderfully gracious and knowledgeable server is Kim and now she knows our favorite dishes! Mine is the vegetable one with large pieces and zucchini pea pods carrots etc. So good.  

My husband's fave is chicken chow mein with bean sprouts cooked in.  Try to find that dish now a days.  It's the old Chinese way.. 

We recommend this resto to everyone.. worn out? Can't agree with that comment at all and the washrooms are the cleanest I've ever seen in a restaurant.  No kidding!! 

If you want red black and Grey and plastic chairs..head to McDonald's.  We come for the great food atmosphere friendly service and cleanliness."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant and it had a very nice cosy feel too it as you walked in. The place was constantly busy and had great service with the waitress able to tell you about the food and would tell exactly the difference between the different rice dishes. There are three large round tables for 6 and nice booths along the wall. Service very good. The fried vegetable rice was above average and the sizzling Szechwan Beef was very good and not overly spicy yet you could ask for it to be hotter. Portions of rice was good for two and the beef sauce was great  for the fried rice. Yes, I would come here again and bring my friends here sometime..... open to 11:30 on a Friday night.. Yes they are very fast with bring out the food and was happily surprised. I  would highly recommend this place  nearby SAIT."}
{"text":"Stopped in for super on a Saturday night, not too busy, maybe eight or ten others in the place, service was great, food was average, not great but not horrible, found a big black hair in the pineapple chicken, that was a big turn off. The staff was very apologetic and replaced it immediately but still ....."}
{"text":"The service here was impeccable. We just stopped in for take-out, but they were very prompt and even offered us some water while we waited. But after that, the whole experience went down-hill.
For the most part, the food was average. The chicken fried rice was terrible (the pieces of chicken looked raw--not fried) and the whole dish had this ozone of oil all over it. The sweet and sour chicken was okay and the veggie surprise was decent. But that rice was a real turn-off. It reminded me of that Arrested Development episode where they boil chicken in water and then feed people the water as chicken \"sauce\" or something. It was disgusting....
If you eat here, either stay away from the chicken fried rice or insist that they actually fry it."}
{"text":"I've been here half a dozen times, and am always impressed by the consistent quality of both the food and the service.  The sign says \"Peking & Seafood\", but they also specialize in dishes from Macau.  These include various Portuguese seasoned char-grilled meats, and delicious curries with aniseed for an Asian twist. These are not items you'll find on many menus, but they are definitely approachable for the average Calgarian. If you're afraid to order new dishes in Chinatown because they might come with that nasty pork that has the texture of pocket lint, try the all-kinds-of-awesome offerings at Emerald Garden instead.  You won't want to touch bobo balls or sweet and sour chicken with a ten foot chop stick afterwards!"}
{"text":"Family eats here all the time. Best chinese food in town. Every occasion with family and friends are done here. Food is great. Kids love the lemon chicken. Service is fast and crew is nice. Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"We've gone to this restaurant for a few years now and every time we go it's been very good.

We usually order the typical dishes (Beef & Broccoli, Egg Fu Yung, Fried Rice, Ginger Beef, etc.) and are always totally happy with the food served.  We've never had an issue with the dishes being too greasy and we've always been pleased with the freshness of the vegetables.  

Service is bang-on and the food arrives arrives quickly, piping hot.  This is a really good restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends who were going through their list of \"goodbye Calgary\" restaurant favourites. Was the first time but not last. Dumplings are my Chinese cuisine fave and this place knows how to do them very well! Service was prompt and cheerful too."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!!! The food is so great!!! I've probably been about 5 times and it is definitely my favourite Chinese food restaurant in Calgary.  We are pretty unoriginal and usual just order the combo dinners for whatever number of people we have... but always love and enjoy all the dishes.  And an added plus is the wait staff is always super friendly!"}
{"text":"Love the food there. Typical Chinese dishes plus some interesting variety from Macao (Portugese influence), makes this an interesting place.

We go frequently, say 6 times or more per year, and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I have driven past this place many times and never really noticed it.  Last night was the night to give this restaurant a go and it was a really good experience.  It began with a very friendly greeting which is always appreciated.  It was a group of 4 of us and with none of us being familiar with the restaurant, we chose to go with their dinner for 4 and added in a seafood dish.  All the food was really good.  Some of the better Chinese food I have had.  And the service was attentive and friendly throughout our time there.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My co-worker raved about Emerald Garden. I thought it was okay, but not as good as my favourite places in the city (Ho Won, Lucky, Chong Fat). The prices were more expensive and the portions were smaller. The hot and sour soup was stellar - good mix of ingredients and there was a good spicy kick to it. The ginger beef was one dimensional in flavour (sugar), and the beef was skimpy. The beef chow fun was done well. Slippery noodles, wok smell/taste and the beef was tender. I didn't see any Portuguese dishes - so not sure what the other Yelpers are talking about..."}
{"text":"Our Family Favourite, this Chinese restaurant not only offers a Chinese food menu but also a Portuguese menu, an influence from MACAU, the Portuguese colony 40 minutes from Hong Kong, our family get togethers or celebrations happen here often, the service is always great, and the food, always pleasing and delicious, the only thing I can say is the seats are uncomfortable but everything else is great, I am trying to get family together here lots in 2015, the prices are great, just nice evenings out, our family fav dishes include the Ginger Beef, Ginger Chicken, Corn Soup, Coconut Rice, and many more."}
{"text":"Probably our fav chinese food place for Calgary. We have been going here for over 15 years. The food is always very tasty and fresh.
We normally order the hot and sour soup. Then Szechuan chicken or beef on sizzling plate, ginger beef, Cantonese chow main. Everything is awesome and it's cool to try the Macau dishes as well."}
{"text":"Suitable for big family/group so that you can have many dishes!! Very good mapotofu!!!"}
{"text":"I keep receiving flyers from Emerald Garden in my mail, and I usually just toss them into the recycling.  I don't know what made me change my mind the other day and finally order some food from this place.

The place is on 16th and the food arrived surprisingly fast.  It was like they already knew what I was going to order and had someone dispatched before I even called.  It was awesome.  And, because the food was so quick to come, it was still nice and warm when we got it.  I love warm delivery.

They have a pretty standard Chinese menu with the usual soup, noodles, fried rice, beef, chicken and pork dishes.  They've also got a couple items that break the fold when it comes to menus such as duck, hot pot dishes, egg foo yung, and sizzling rice dishes, whatever that means.

It has average prices for the food you get, but you always get a lot of food and have leftovers for a couple of days.  That's the beauty of Chinese food.  Emerald Garden certainly satisfied our taste buds that night and next time I won't be so quick to disregard the menu."}
