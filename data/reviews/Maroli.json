{"text":"Let me get the positive out of the way first. Really delicious food and extremely authentic taste.

BUT:

Took us an hour to get the food when there were only 2 other tables occupied
Plates and cutlery were dirty. I mean unwashed.
I returned my unclean plate before lunch arrived...after all we had a hour to kill....and then had to ask for it to be replaced when lunch eventually arrived!
My daughter ordered Naan and it come stone cold...maybe they cooked this first?!
each additional order of appams took 15 minutes to arrive and I know how long it takes to make one.
Then the chef came to our table and we did take the time to tell him that he was doing a great job but that he might be out of one if the restaurant continue to be managed the way it was.
The final cut...he sent us an additional serving of appams...And then when we got the cheque they had charged us for it!!!
They have parking space for one car, but given our experience today, I guess that is more than adequate!

A pity, all of this, given that the food is outstanding.

I am inherently optimistic, but I do not give this particular Maro"}

We enjoyed the Fish Molee in a coconut sauce

Vegetable Khurma with a coconut sauce and a pistachio base

Jeera Pulao rice dish was moist and perfect to sop up the sauces

Award winning Butter Chicken was the best ever

The owner dropped to say hello and we enjoyed his interest in how we enjoyed the food. This really shows a dedication to serving up some of the best indian food I have had. This is really a genuine homestyle meal served in a restaurant. Authentic, Genuine and delicious.

Very very highly recommended"}
{"text":"First off, let begin with this statement... I am a picky enjoyer. Let me explain, I will eat just about everything, but for me to really enjoy something it must be really outstanding.

As my wife and I walked in, we stepped into a fantastic mix of bistro meets cafe. Very welcoming. We got seats real quick (mainly because the restaurant hasn't had it's grand opening yet, so nobody knows it's there). The waiter, missed his name, was very friendly. after going to Kolkata for 2 weeks, I was hoping this food would compare to how it was in India... not the sad fusion mix (mainly watering down the spices [not heat]). 

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to try the Naan because the restaurant was going into full swing the day after my visit. Me and my wife sat down and prepared to try as much as our bodies would allow. 

Portion size is perfect, but we went a bit crazy! We started off with fresh beef samosas, then we hit our stride... Nadan Chicken Curry, Chicken Kurma, Vegetarian Biriyani, Malabari Roti, Chai, and coffee.

Beef Samosas
The samosas were great. Fresh ingredients, freshly fried, and served with some chutney. 

Nadan Chicken Curry
I had the Nadan Chicken Curry... After my first taste I flopped back and said, \"ok Jesus, I am ready to come home!\" ... True story. Soft and subtle flavours mixed in with juicy chicken. 

Chicken Kurma
Again... a knockout. This was a soft flavoured chicken dish that ended off with a slight fruity flavour. Silky smooth with nice high notes.

Vegetarian Biriyani
I have had biriyani super dry, over cooked, under cooked, oily like crazy... just a dish that is hard to find done just right... and this was it. This had a beautiful twist I never had before. It had raisins and crispy onions... just a great mix!

Roti
Fresh, tasty, and a must have when eating authentic Indian food.

Chai
Just imagine a little kid standing on a crate on the sidewalk, scooping it from a pot, and instead of a small clay cup (traditional chai is a small amount), an actual cup that lasts more than just a shot of flavour.

The Southern Indian Coffee
This was basically a cappuccino. With my experience with coffee, I know this was steamed milk with instant coffee (nescafe). 

Price
For all this I paid 50 bucks for the two of us (my wife and I). Great price for this food. I was so pleased with the food and service and gave a generous tip because they deserved it. I gave more in tip wise then I have ever given anywhere... ha ha ha!

Overall... This is my to go restaurant. It was so good that I HAD to make a yelp account just to tell my fellow yelpers how great this is. 

My opinion if you couldn't tell... Seriously a good place to indulge in authentic Indian Kerala Cuisine."}
