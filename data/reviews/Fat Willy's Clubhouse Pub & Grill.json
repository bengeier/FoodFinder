{"text":"Absolutely amazing especially on mondays.. Jen and staff are great... have not disappointed in 3 years coming here.. you got to try... Monday $6 burger"}
{"text":"Try the 6 dollar hamburger night on Monday night great value and cooked to perfection . service was great even though they were very busy. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Sometimes the service is a little slow. But it's worth the wait for the black n bleu burger. Mmm"}
{"text":"Excellent food!! Looked like a work of art! Service was slow but they were courteous and sweet . It was our first visit!! Definitely will come back!!"}
{"text":"The service has really improved over past few years. When the food is good, it's generally very good but it's somewhat inconsistent - we've had cold chicken strips, fries, . . ."}
{"text":"Great service. Nice view of the golf course. We got the French dip, the Rueben and a bacon cheeseburger. It was all great. Will defiantly come back."}
{"text":"Good food! Great Karaoke! Wednesday nights, standing room only. $5 cover charge, but don't worry well worth the price! Not your typical karaoke, folks just come to listen! Some of the best karaoke singers I have ever heard. If your going better get there early last two weeks standing room only!"}
{"text":"These guys are amazing. Love the restaurant and the view. Wait staff is on point and can deal with a wide variety of guest from happy friendly to old and grumpy without missing a beat.  Hidden gem in our neighborhood.  Thanks for always being here!"}
{"text":"It's a \"sports bar\" but they have soccer on the TVs, and we all know soccer is not a real sport.  Also the service is hella slow and they ignore you for long times to chat with other employees.  Burger was ok but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Played golf at Viewpoint in the early morning and afterwards had their breakfast, french toast, eggs and sausage. Service was okay for 8 people and the server was friendly. I'm a breakfast person and this meal hit the SPOT. I'll definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Very limited menu. If you're really hungry, you'll find yourself something. Staff was very friendly. Free WiFi."}
{"text":"I was here for a special event, and I was charged $4 for a soda water with lemon. In my decade of bar tending I've never charged a designated driver for a non-alcoholic drink, let alone charge a patron for a \"soda\" when they asked for soda water. I believe the bartender just put the money in her tip jar. I was planning to tip for the waters, but to be charged is absurd. I'll never frequent any of the Fat Willy's Bars again."}
{"text":"My advice is don't come here. Save yourself time and money.  This isn't a real Fat Willy's. It has limited menu, less beer on tap and the service can fluctuate between OK and terrible. Food is normal bar food hut because this location isn't invested in, the food isn't on par as other locations.   Today my whole family finished their food before the waitress came out and told me my pizza will be another ten minutes. Really? My family is already done. We weren't even offered compensation for this terrible customer service. The silverware was dirty and had food on it. My daughter said her wings were terrible, the fish and chips was like warm. Awesome photo of my empty pizza stand."}
{"text":"We love this Fat willys location! Right on the golf course and great food!"}
{"text":"You couldn't pay me to eat here again.  Used a Groupon and still wasn't worth the money.  My husband ordered a burger and it was burned to a crisp, literally cremated.  What chef thinks it is OK to serve something like this?  Disgusting! I ordered the Friday Fish Fry and the fish wasn't crispy.  It was hot but not fresh out of the fryer.  Made ahead of time and left to sit and get soggy.  Not even good service.  They are way understaffed. It was full of old people so we felt like we were eating in an old folks home.  NOT a place I would ever recommend anyone ever go to."}
{"text":"The service was slow but friendly when my friend and I ate on the patio on a Thursday evening two months ago.  We had a great view of the golf course during sunset.  Unfortunately, my burger was overcooked (which it usually is at places like this).    It's a great, tucked-away spot extremely close to my home so I was hoping it would be a bit better visit than it was.  I haven't been back yet, but am willing to give it another try based on it's proximity to my house and the great view.  Just please don't overcook my burger this time!"}
{"text":"2 stars because your food is good.  0 stars because your bartender ignored me several times and in the 15 minutes I sat at the bar (after waiting to be acknowledged at host table) the bartender never once cracked a smile.  Another gal took my order. Got my Bloody Mary slid to me. Ordered my food to go cuz what's the point in staying when no one cares if you are there?  FYI - We are visitors to Viewpoint RV & Golf Resort ( great place!).  We obviously don't live here but can I give you a few pointers? Acknowledge your customers. Smile. The best tips come from people who enjoy a meal! Put enough staff on to work your lunch & dinner crowds, especially for your $5 burger nights. Lastly, take care of the older folks.  Sure they may have a bit of money to spend but they also need to WANT to spend it. I saw a lil couple served burgers.  You don't necessary need utensils, but you need napkins. They had to get up and snag a couple bar napkins cuz your servers ignored them, repeatedly.  I hope you review this and have a staff meeting. Smiles go a LONG way! And please! Hire more staff. Or teach them how to work busy shift. Oh and get another bartender. Went there several times - not once, not one time did she smile.  Other than that, enjoy you're day!"}
{"text":"Should have known when I walked in the door... My dad was staying at View Point and I was in town visiting so we decided to head over to Fat Willy's for dinner on 4/1/2017. When we entered I'd say about 1/2 the tables were dirty and still covered with dishes and no patrons. We took a seat at the bar... the bar was still dirty and there were glasses and dishes all over as well. We sat there for about 10 minutes and not once did any of the 4 or 5 people walking around behind the bar stop and say they'd be with us shortly or ask if we needed food or drink. After the 10 minutes of waiting we got up and walked out and found somewhere else to eat... and I recommend you do the same!! Horrendous service and I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've gone to the other fat willys locations and the vibe is usually great and thought I'd come here for lunch. This is a golf bar and grill so it's mostly old people, but compared to the other fat willys this place has way better food. I recommend the philly. Was delicious."}
