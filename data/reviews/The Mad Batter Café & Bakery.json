{"text":"Love this place! Home made strawberry jam. Fresh biscuits. Breakfast was yum yum yum."}
{"text":"I had to give this place five stars because there are no minuses. Had French toast and breakfast burrito. Everything is made from scratch. Awesome jam. Coffee is great too. Service is great and people very pleasant."}
{"text":"This place is excellent, great food at a good price. My family and I try to stay away from big chain restaurants. This small Mom and Pop shop really blew us away. The service was top notch. Also the staff went out of there way to make sure we got everything we wanted. I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting more from the places they eat."}
{"text":"After reading the great reviews I decided to visit yesterday with my 2 children.  Started off fine when my hot chocolate I ordered showed up and went downhill from there.  The whipped cream looked great however underneath that was lukewarm chocolate milk. I didn't complain because it wasn't the end of the world. 

I don't eat pork products so before ordering I made it clear with the server and asked if there were any other meat options for the breakfast burrito.  The response was no which wasn't a big deal so I ordered the Mad Batter Skillet that states \"Homemade biscuit, slice of quiche, topped with swiss cheese, carmelized mushrooms and onions, topped with creamy sirracha sauce\". No mention of meat whatsoever!  About 3 forks in I see meat and stopped the server to ask what it was, she says \"I believe bacon and ham\".  I immediately pushed the dish away from me in disgust as she stood there.  I showed her on the menu where it had no mention of meat under that entrée and she didn't even ask if I wanted anything else or anything before she walked off. 

The last straw was being fully charged for a dish I had only 3 forks of.  Any other restaurant would have removed it from the bill without being prompted. I didn't ask because it was only $10 however it's small simple things like this that make me never return to a business again......and I won't be returning to this one for sure."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast based on the Yelp reviews. However, 45 minutes after we placed our order we were still waiting for drinks!! I have to go directly to the front and ask if they can at least bring our drinks! Some people left the place, because no one came to their table to get their order! Our food came 50 minutes after we placed the order, and silverware 5 minutes after. Food was good (3 stars) but service scores a negative -1!! The place needs a good manager!"}
{"text":"OK. The decor is whimsical, the staff is amiable and their biscuits and gravy are magical!"}
{"text":"From the minute you walk in the door, you feel comfortable. It's our favorite place, good food, fair prices and the atmosphere is so relaxing. Pretty much has everything our family of 5 loves! With boys, they always want something hearty. Me,just watching the carbs! I can get the spinach scramble while they get the breakfast burritos or breakfast sandwiches. On a splurge, you've got to try the biscuits and gravy.....Ahhhh heaven in every mouth full! On top of that, we can get pastries to go???? oh my! They even have delivery.....Just wish I could get myself there for breakfast every day."}
{"text":"I found this place in my continuing effort to avoid Starbucks. If you are in the area of College/Horizon and considering Starbucks look NE and you will find the Mad Batter. It's more bakery than coffee shop but the have a decent selection of hot/iced coffee drinks. The young man working the counter was great...super friendly, very respectful and welcoming, something you won't see across the street. I suggest you gives this place a try and have a blueberry scone."}
{"text":"The Mad Batter Cafe created a luxurious wedding cake for us.  It was beyond our expectations and made a grand center piece for our event.  The cake looked and great and tasted even better.  The staff at The Mad Battery cafe was outstanding...they listened to every detail and made it to happen to make our event a night to remember."}
{"text":"We ordered the breakfast burrito, stack of pancakes, and sausage and gravy. All food was delicious. The burrito was the right amount of egg, sausage, cheese, and spicy sauce. The pancakes were fluffy and had a taste of vanilla?. Very good. The biscuits and gravy was an interesting combination of sausage in a creamy sauce. The scone was very soft and flaky. The pumpkin bread pudding was a little dry, maybe too much cinnamon, but still nice.

Service is a little slow. The food made from scratch is excellent but they might need another cook/ chef."}
{"text":"This place has so much charm, and the food is great! You can't loose, no matter what you choose. Both breakfast and lunch are delicious!"}
{"text":"The two stars are due to friendly servers, initially.  We saw great reviews on yelp and decided to visit this establishment since my husband and I had an appointment in Henderson.  We drove an hour from N. Las Vegas and arrived at 11:08am.  We were seated quickly, and ordered two coffees.  We looked at the menus and saw only lunch items.  We asked if they had a breakfast menu, but we were immediately told they stopped serving breakfast.  I surveyed the restaurant and found only seven other people inside, all eating their breakfast food.  I politely told the waitress that we drove an hour and were looking for breakfast, but she said they are serving lunch only.  We finished our coffees, paid, and left.  For a place that serves brunch, we found it odd they stopped serving breakfast at 11:00am.  Furthermore, no one else arrived during the 15 minutes it took to drink our coffees.  We were surprised they were so stern with so few customers.  My husband and I drive to Henderson on weekends.  They lost my business, and I will NOT recommend anyone else waste their time due to poor customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"Been here three times already. Excellent service and food. First visit I had the biscuits and gravy, then the following day I had the tri-tip sliders and 2 cannoli's then went Friday and had the crepes.

I'll definitely be back to the Mad Batter Cafe."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Super duper staff. Bryson was the best server I've ever had."}
{"text":"New breakfast place, my boyfriend and I were looking for a new breakfast spot, and found this place! Love it the only reason I did not give it a 5 star is the kitchen is small and it tends to get smokey in their, the wait is also a bit long but worth it. Just enjoy a cup of coffee and have good conversation while you wait. Staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable! We loved the biscuits and gravy and my picky son loved the French toast! Will come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Okay so I didn't try their bakery part, which seems to be their craft, but the cafe for breakfast was such a disappointment! I'm so sick of frozen processed food. I was so hopeful going in and then after they presented my food I realized what a mistake it was. My husband and I both got breakfast sandwiches: bacon or sausage with egg , cheese and croissant. And you can tell it's frozen food. Sorry, times are changing and we're beginning to realize how detrimental those types of foods are on our bodies."}
{"text":"Ordered the mad batter skillet and burrito. I love when potatoes are in burritos and their hash inside the burrito is excellent. I enjoyed the biscuit in the mad batter skillet, buttery and a little sweet. Can't wait to try their biscuits and gravy next."}
{"text":"Good quality food! I have had their breakfast and lunch--every time I order my tummy is very happy!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a late lunch and were amazed with the food. While it is a small place they were able to quickly serve our large group. Very good biscuits and gravy. Very good service and everything was made from scratch."}
{"text":"Love that we have this place over here. Our area needed something like this. Quaint little place. Great iced tea. The food is good but not something I would rave about. Hash browns are definitely a must try. Biscuits and gravy very good. I haven't tried too many of their pastries but, from what I've had, no complaints. 
Service was very good on every occasion I've been there. Give it a try, pretty sure you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall with potential.

Recently my daughter and I went here for a late breakfast. Upon entering, the diner is greeted with a high top counter and several stools where you can sit and watch the chef if you so desire. There are only a limited number of tables, as this restaurant is a converted sandwich shop. The back area appears to be used solely for the bakery and perhaps the classes they have begun offering. 

The breakfast menu is rather limited, but that's not a big deal as long as the food is good. We had the biscuits and gravy along with French Toast with caramelized bananas. The gravy is a sausage based gravy and has a good flavor. The biscuits were good, albeit slightly over cooked as they were hard on the bottom instead of light and fluffy throughout. This was a bit disappointing as the biscuit is very important and should be easy to eat with just a fork. 

The French Toast is thick Texas style and lightly covered with powdered sugar and caramelized bananas. The flavor is sweet and the texture appropriate. The bananas were not caramelized as much as I prefer, but were tasty none the less. We also had a couple of sides of bacon, which was tasty and cooked properly. 

Considering the food is cooked on a very small griddle the food was prepared quickly and was hot. The bacon was partially cooked prior to order and stored in a warming tray. After food is ordered the chef finishes the bacon off on the griddle prior to serving. He did a remarkable job at this, the bacon was not too crisp and had that fresh off the griddle smell and flavor. I would imagine the small griddle could become an issue if you were dining with a large group or if the place was really busy. With that said, the Chef appeared competent in understanding the order to cook items and ensure they are all finished at the same time and served hot. 

After finishing breakfast we ordered cake pops to go for desert later that day. The cake-pops were tasty, although the cookies and cream cake pop was a tad doughy. The Chocolate was good, the Red Velvet our favorite with the confetti being our least favorite as it was lacking in depth of flavor. 

The cost was average and within acceptable range for a restaurant such as this. We paid under $40 including tip for everything.

I did overhear the waitress talking about a planned expansion so if that happens this will definitely become a great breakfast spot with plenty of seating.  While watching the chef cook was fun I would hope they build a proper chefs kitchen with proper exhaust fans and the like. 

I am considering taking one of their cooking/baking classes to see how that goes. 

Overall this is worth a visit and worth returning to again. Next time I'll try the lunch menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I just ate here today. Was asked once if we needed anything else when our meals were dropped off. Then, no more service thereafter. We needed more drinks, extra napkins, etc. Server simply never came back. No friendly, or welcoming vibe in this place. I told my wife we should give it another chance before making a final judgement. She said that she really wanted to like the place because it was nearby the house. But, the experience was so bad she's not too keen on going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Loved it! Great food. Amazing, refreshingly different menu with old classics as well. Everything was so good. Glad we made our way out here. It was worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, I had the Caprese  sandwich  with a side of apple slaw & pumpkin spice coffee.  The restaurant was very clean and the staff were amicable, knowledgable and friendly.  I also purchased fresh strawberry jam & almond butter, an amazing find!"}
{"text":"We went with Mad Batter Cafe for our wedding cake. We went with Brittany because we had our wedding at Anthem Country Club and it was part of the package. This was by far the worst vendor we worked with at the wedding. Brittany was hard to get a hold of throughout the entire process and continued to forget details we discussed multiple times. And to make things worse she emailed me ON MY WEDDING DAY to tell me why the cake wasn't how we had discussed (saying that things weren't able to be delivered on time even though we had discussed the details 7 months prior to the wedding). She made me pay for colored cupcake wrappers and then didn't even give us the color we asked. Honestly horrible service, would definitely suggest choosing a different service."}
{"text":"What a great find on our way from LV.  Attentive staff and terrific food.  I had eggs and amazing hash browns made with sour cream and cheddar cheese.  My son had the Nutella crepes and two servings of bacon.  The pancakes ranked way up there. The French toast and berries were tasty.  The only thing that would make our experience better is if they served lattes and decaf coffee. Otherwise, don't miss this gem."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place so much. We tried it the day after the grand opening and it was quite disorganized (sort of understandably). We walked in and kind of stood there not knowing what to do. We finally just grabbed a table and waited awhile to order and waited longer for our food, but overall the biscuits and gravy were pretty good. I also got a cupcake to go and when I tried to eat it it was so cold it was hard. I let it thaw for a few hours and it tasted frost bitten. Super disappointing. 

Wanting to love this place, we tried it again. Walking in we grabbed a table that just became open, but wasn't bussed yet. It remained dirty the ENTIRE time we were there sitting there eating. We waiting awhile and no one came to take our order (still seems disorganized and didn't know if we just order at the counter) so I got up and went to the counter to order (where it asks you for a tip before you're served..?) an iced tea, latè and two biscuits and gravy. The food came out before our drinks and it was COLD! At that point I just wanted to leave. $25 for cold food, mediocre coffee and pretty bad service. 

I will say when the biscuits and gravy are hot they're pretty dang good. All in all.. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast after getting out of work early. Got the avocado wrap. I was pleased."}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I love to come here for breakfast! They have such an original menu and I haven't tried something I don't love! The prices are on point and the staff are great! They give you such an at home feel and if it were possible we'd eat here every morning! :-)"}
{"text":"Staff was amazing. Atmosphere was trendy and super amazing. Clean. Nice little touches all over."}
{"text":"Headed to McDonald's and found this great place next door. I had a delicious quiche and biscuit. My son had berry crepes.  It was wonderful. The only negative is how smoky it is in there."}
{"text":"I love this place. Today I had the philly cheese steak and it was wonderful. For my side it was the watermelon feta salad. It was refreshing and just perfect with my sandwich. They also have a delicious assortment of pastries. I could eat here everyday."}
{"text":"Omg his place is amazing it's so cute and personal the staff is extremely nice I love them and the food is magnificent my extreme turtle coffee was life I want it every day"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now...the food is fresh and tasty. The staff are sweet and friendly. If you aren't sure what to get...you must try their potato hash. Nom nom nom"}
{"text":"If I could, I would give 0 stars! I was on my way out of Vegas after a fun filled weekend with friends and we were looking for a breakfast place to eat. The Mad batter cafe & bakery came up on the list of restaurants nearby with a 4 star rating and several yelp reviews. We liked what we read and we decided to try out the place. When we arrived they were cleaning off some tables and were told to wait to be seated. There was a group of three before us that was seated and then nothing. We waited until a couple went in and sat themselves at a table for two. I was confused since we had been waiting to be seated. There were two empty tables pushed together that would seat 8 people. I went to the counter to ask about sitting at the table and was told no, that the table was reserve for larger parties. I was even more confused. This place is small, only 3 tables that seat four, 2 tables that seat two and then the 2 empty tables pushed together. I asked if there was a reservation coming within the next hour. The lady said no but that it's only reserve for larger parties. Okay, so maybe I missed this lesson in my BUS 101 class. I'm not a business owner, but this logic doesn't make sense. You have four customers ready to spend money at your establishment but you won't let them because you're waiting on an imaginary group of 8 that may possibly come. Well, this sounds like a successful business model...NOT!!!  This is what I have to say, if you don't want our business then \"Goodbye!\" We'll spend our money elsewhere. You take care of your imaginary customers. We went to the Omelette House, where we didn't have to wait to be seated and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"This review is 3 stars (1 for the baked goods and 2 for the customer service).  I tried several of their baked goods and was less than impressed with the flavor/texture/frosting of things, plus they are way too expensive.  The customer service was ok and the lady who helped me took the time to explain some of the items.  They offer breakfast too and I didn't try that, however what I saw coming out of the kitchen looked good so I may go back to try that.  If so, I'll update my review if that experience is better."}
{"text":"I've held off on writing a review for a long time.  I haven't reviewed for completely selfish reasons...I haven't reviewed, even though I have dined here nearly every weekend for over a month straight, because I don't want other people to come here.
Mad Batter is a cute, small, and hipster-ish coffee shop/breakfast cafe that is not very busy and has delicious coffee and food.  I will say that normally hipster restaurants annoy my husband and I, but Mad Batter has only a few funky bits and is not in-your-face or obnoxious about it.
My husband is a coffee snob, and I usually don't care for the taste of coffee, however we both love the coffee here.  The standard coffee (free refills, of course) is quite good, and smooth.  The hot and cold coffee drinks they make (I love the white mocha) are sweet and far better than somewhere like Starbucks. 
All the breakfast food is delicious, as I said above, but I think the savory dishes are where they really shine.  I can't comment on the lunch and dinner items as we have only come for breakfast.  They have several unique items, and many common, but with a twist items that provide just enough of a kick to make you feel adventurous at breakfast. 
A few other yelpers have complained about the biscuits, which I suppose I could understand.  They are scrumptious, but they are different from what you may expect.  Their biscuits are not the super dry Bisquick kind you make at home,  nor are they drenched in butter like other breakfast joints. I can't exactly put my finger on how they are different, but they go perfectly with their wonderfully  meat-heavy gravy.  I am not normally a biscuit, nor a biscuit and gravy fan.  I find most breakfast gravies far too salty (even though I love salt) and biscuits always make me feel like I'm eating straight flour.  Mad Batter has made me a believer, and it really is good!
Here, we have never had to wait for a table, unlike many trendy breakfast joints, and the staff doesn't rush you.  The place is \"seat yourself\" and due to the size and layout may be tricky for large groups.  I assume you'd need to split into two tables if you have any more than 5 adults.  It was comfortable for us at a table with four adults and two toddlers, but more than that would be hard.
We always come with our two year old and the ladies that work here are very sweet with him and he loves the food as well.  In the back corner (near the kitchen entrance) they have a bunch of no-sound vaguely vintage kids toys you can bring to the table.  Everything from older baby to probably 10 year olds could find something entertaining.  Lots of Melissa and Doug brand (for you parents reading this.)
So while this place is awesome, don't come here because I don't want to wait for a table or have it be loud inside :D."}
{"text":"They are the most un serviced people working here
Not only are they out of so many things of the menu but they couldn't even change the bread type on a sandwich
Don't waste your time going there"}
{"text":"A little small, but clean. Nice service. Didn't order lunch food - although it looked and smelled great. Had coffee and pastries. Coffee was smooth and not bitter- Very good quality. The pastries were also really good, especially because they were not overly sweet. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty decent. I had the XL sandwich, my son had the same( except with scrambled eggs instead of sunny side up), my wife had the Oreo pancakes, and my youngest had the French toast. All in all- happy with the food. The service was a little slow and maybe the girl we got was new/inexperienced, but it was Sunday and we were in a slow mood anyway. 

What I really like was the size of their dining room. Very small, really quaint. Reminded me of something you'd see stuck into the side of a wall in NYC. Dare I say there's a slight hipster feel to this place. I'm not the type to wear a scarf and skinny jeans while I photograph an omelette, but I felt right at home nonetheless. I could definitely see them having acoustic jam sessions or activist beatnik poetry in here.  I hope they add a more selective coffee/espresso collection in the future. 

Give this place a shot. Not a bad addition to the neighborhood. Come support them."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and the chicken salad croissant sandwich is great.  Special ordered a cake from them for wife and found it was the only time I enjoyed a spice cake."}
{"text":"Can I give 6 stars?! Seriously, the best breakfast I've had in a really long time. My daughter loved the croissant sandwich with their amazing cheesy hash brown casserole and I had the spinach scramble with a side of biscuit and gravy. Oh the gravy...chunks of sausage, a touch of heat. Everything was seasoned perfectly.  We had terrific service. Can wait to try the homemade Samoa cookie...later when I have room. We dropped in a 9am on a Wednesday so it was quiet, but they get busy on the weekends so go early or expect a wait."}
{"text":"Sick place dude ! Yea this place is legit check it out I love not too far and it's my go to place for some good grub"}
{"text":"This is a neat little place. The decor is nice and the food is good. I had the orange zest mascarpone french toast and the cheesy hash. The toast was perfect, right amount of sweetness. The hash was actually very tasty, however, I hate onion and this had little chunks all over. I wasn't aware of it (hidden well) until I bit into one.

My husband had the stack. He simply liked it all and thoroughly enjoyed it"}
{"text":"This was our second time eating there. First time: food and service were good. Not so much today. Had to order three times because \"we are out of that.\" 15 minutes after an order, the waitress came back to tell us they were out of what two of us had ordered, and said anyone could change their order because \"THEY HADN'T STARTED FIXING IT YET.\" We waited over an hour to get the food (literally-- not an exaggeration), and my order was wrong (I ordered a salad and got a wrap). I told them I would just take it as it is because we had been there over an hour. All of us had empty glasses for 1/2 hour and we only saw the waitress enjoying a meal at another table. Hm. Owner (?) apologized for the wait and took 20% off the total. The wrap (my order mistake) was good. The tri-tip sandwiches were a roll with a little bit of meat and cheese (4 bites) with a few chips on the side ($10?)."}
{"text":"Wonderful at first..... But not so much anymore. Best coffee though! We had a lovely waitress, however I'm not sure when things got sort of bad, but disappointed the last couple times. We took my in laws into visit and I think there is much to be improved. 

 Please cut your croissants in half and toast instead of microwaving it to warm it up and the French soup was very disappointing. 

 1130am would make more sense for changing breakfast to lunch too....super bummed because I think breakfast is much better."}
{"text":"I gave the girl a $100 bill to cover a $45 plus change bill.......she gave me back $44 plus change back!!!!!!!!!!!! Now......I guess to compensate them for me having to change the order from in-house to take out was to give me $10 less??????? Wow......and I still left a $5 tip.....I wanted to see if she would correct this....NOPE! So maybe business isn't so good....which is why she did not give me all my change back. As a business owner myself......I ABSOLUTELY LOATHE when workers/businesses steal from customers...by shortchanging them!!!! I am sorry .....my business has NEVER shortchanged customers.....it's a level of dishonesty passed off as a \"oops\" or a \"mistake\".  That is just not acceptable!!! Too bad....shortchanging me just cost them a sale of 2 custom cake orders I needed also."}
{"text":"This place was great. Was in town for a couple of days and we went back several times during the trip for breakfast. Service was great. Crepes are a must."}
{"text":"I had probably one of THE BEST breakfast's in awhile!

We drove about 20 minutes from up north just to try out a new adventurous place, and we were not disappointed by any means. 

I had The Mad Batter Skillet with a side of cheesy potatoes. I was so satisfied that I was so close to buying another one just to experience those flavors all over again. The coffee I was drinking had some pumpkin spice flavoring (since it was the first day of fall I felt it necessary) and it was perfect. 

I'm a simple man, and this place definitely pleased my appetite. We will gladly drive out of our comfort zone to this place anytime! Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"This place belongs in LA or at least Summerlin, lucky for Henderson, it's right down the street! This place is fairly new, but much needed in the mostly commercial area. I've been three different times for breakfast and each time they improve from the previous experience. Endless delicious coffee with a variety of flavored syrups and cream, delicious biscuits and gravy, warm sweet crepes! The staff is BEYOND friendly and you can truly see how happy they are to be there which is rare! The industrial feel and environment give it an artsy feel while the food will keep you coming back for more. They are notorious for samples which force you to take something home with you for later. This place is my favorite!"}
{"text":"We met friends here for breakfast. The place is super cute and according to our friends their specialty coffee were very good. The place is decorated cute with lots of fun signage.
The service was out of this world! The coffee cups were kept full and. The staff very seeet.
Unfortunately the breakfast was just part of the world. It was food l!
The biscuits and sausage grave with eggs was a nice portion but not particularly good nor did it have much sausages I would say if the used link sausage (the didn't) it would maybe have been one link work of meat. It also was the most unusual color kind of a tan pink color and not super hot. The breakfast burrito was  filling and the salsa was good."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my new favorite places to eat. Food was great, service was better. Special thanks to Jamison, for the absolutely outstanding service!"}
{"text":"Really cute place! Love the food, it was a little bit of a wait but totally worth it in the end. Definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"Went there today. Service is great. All the staff is very friendly. Food was very good.
They make everything to order, so it takes a little longer to get your food. Which I'm okay with because it's soooo worth it."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant, very clean. I love their pastries. I gave a friend some scones to try & she said it was the best she's ever had. I did enjoy the gluten free chocolate cookies. For breakfast I tried the skillet with a side of chopped melons and a cup of oj. Loved it. The young lady that works there was very nice. I'll bring my friends there next time. 
It's great to dine in a locally owned business, skip IHOP or Starbucks; let's support our local businesses!"}
{"text":"Sigh. I really liked this place when it first opened. Today was not so great. Food is pretty good American breakfast. I got the XL- Bacon Jam. It was fairly good, but not spectacular.

The place DOES smell like bacon grease. They need to get an overhead vent.

2 stars because they wouldn't take my groupon. They require 2 entree purchases or 2 people to come. Baked goods don't count. This is NOT in the Groupon fine print."}
{"text":"Friendly staff! My vegetarian wrap was delicious! Very fresh ingredients. I gave it 4 stars because the dessert was a little disappointing. Tasted old & dry, like it had been in the case a while. I wanted to like their desserts. Maybe I just came on the wrong day. Otherwise, a great little place in Henderson."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow-ish but staff was friendly and food was good. It's a cute place...hard to find, tucked in a corner. We brought the kids (age 4 and 5) and were happy to find games and puzzles for them. Great menu...wish there were more juice options. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The ride to this spot was well worth it! Great job Stacey! If you don't like biscuits try sourdough with their Stack attack!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal, and some delicious banana bread - great energy and plan to work remote here sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Such a lovely place, soon to become everyone's favorite local hang out or quick stop for \"Joe\", and the decor is amazing!"}
{"text":"The BEST biscuits and gravy i have had. It's not your traditional plain white gravy which I'm so happy about. I've been here 4 times now and never am disappointed. There food is very good! Will definitely be back again and again. Whoever the chef is. Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"We had the biscuits and gravy, potato hash, mad batter skillet and banana Nutella crepes. Everything was phenomenal! Delicious, fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"Not the usual breakfast! Yeah, they still have eggs, bacon, and toast. But they put  it all together in the most unique way and everything is cooked fresh. The chefs are behind the counter (Waffle House style) so you can watch all the action. 
Great price and great food. I recommend the Billy Goat!"}
{"text":"Great pastries my favorite was the Bacon maple scone. The cake pops and macaroons look so yummy as well. I almost splurged and got a small Butterfinger cheesecake looks amazing but didn't want to eat all those calories so close to summer. Cute little shop in the heart of downtown Henderson. Great for sitdown breakfast as well"}
{"text":"Had biscuits and gravy, crepes, and coffee...everything was great! Check it out! Plenty of baked sweets to choose from too"}
{"text":"We were BEYOND UNDERWELMED AND DISAPPOINTED with every single thing we ordered. The \"hash\" was soggy, mushy, and not seasoned at all- hash implies crisp fresh seasoned potatoes, not baby mush. Our avocado burrito was watery and undercooked, my husband SPIT OUT his first bite. Again, simple cooking 101 was missed, no salt, pepper, garlic etc. The crepes were bland and had NO FILLING- if german style means no filling, now we know so not their fault on that but the menu says powdered sugar and whipped cream and we didnt get either of those so they couldnt even do that right! I spent $40 on a soggy unseasoned mess that I could have made at home with 10 times the quality and flavor. We will never try anything from here ever again, total waste! Warn your crepe loving friends that this place will leave them entireley dissatisfied."}
{"text":"We stopped at this spot for breakfast on the way back to Phoenix from Vegas. What a good find... it was only 4 min off the highway and such a cute spot. 
The food was amazing, and anyone who goes should make sure to get the potato hash (so cheesy and good). 
I also bought some macaroons to take with me, and they were soooo good. My boyfriend d even raved about his breakfast sandwich which I also tried. 
We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I brought my son and hubby here on a Saturday and it was awesome! They have games for the kiddos to play while you wait for the food. The menu is not huge but what's there is super yummy! We had the mad skillet, French toast, and pancakes...all delicious! The biscuit (which is in the skillet) is one of the best I've ever had! The pancakes were thick and delicious...I think maybe with almond extract because they smelled different then any pancake I've had. My son also loves the parfait, portions are good and we didn't leave overly stuffed."}
{"text":"Very cute place but gave it 2 stars because the lack of service. We waited 25 min at a table with no water or coffee. Very young inexperienced staff. Hopefully will be better in future and they just had a bad day."}
{"text":"This place was a lot smaller than expected, but it wasn't crowded and service was pretty good. My son and I both got BLTs which were excellent. Also ordered one of their Nutella coffee drinks and it was OK. As a treat my son and I ordered a couple pastry items...cookie, some cannolis. I was not impressed by any of the pastry items at all. They tasted almost stale-they pick the quality of their pastry items up they'll be a five star place!"}
{"text":"Shared the Philly sandwich with my husband and it was so good I wish I had gotten my own!  My son had the grilled pesto chicken sandwich and really like it too!  The service was fast and the toaster strudel was delicious for dessert. Will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"So glad a place like this is finally in Henderson. Service and food were both great! I'm definitely going to go back often!"}
{"text":"The food and environment was really great. Good customer service and very friendly employees. Did I mention the food was great!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast. There were many delicious looking options. Food was good, service was friendly. We got some cookies to take home since they were 2-for1 on Tuesdays. Try the cheesy potatoes. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I arrived at 11:01, I didn't know they stop serving breakfast at 11, when we asked the waitress if we could still order breakfast she was rude and said it's after 11. Being in the culinary field myself I was polite to her even after attitude. (Sometimes you're just having a bad day)I then ordered coffee, it took 15 mins to get the first cup and 20 minutes to get a refill. When I finally received my lunch, I found a long hair in mine 3rd bite. I didn't want to ruin everyone else's lunch so I just covered with a napkin, unfortunately my friend started gagging and this caught the attention of the young man behind the counter. My meal was comped, without me asking. I always support local establishments but this was probably one of my worst experiences ever. The only highlight was the young man that helped us out."}
{"text":"What a cute gem hidden in Henderson.

The food and bakery items are extremely tasty. I also really enjoyed their unique and fabulous lattes.

The staff was extremely kind and helpful."}
{"text":"Great food, but you will stink from the grease smell in restaurant"}
{"text":"Really great brunch spot. I got the croissant sandwich with sausage and my husband got the quiche. We got the potatoes as a side and they were amazing! Cheesy potatoes with crunchy fried onions on top. We also both got one of their speciality coffees-a little expensive, but huge! It's pretty small inside and we were lucky to get a seat. I gave them 4-stars because I don't think they have enough people on staff and we had to wait quite a bit for everything. Next time I'd like to try one of their sweets!"}
{"text":"Swing and a miss.
Was that a day-old croissant? 

A sad disappointment, considering the high overall rating, friendly service, and that I've had MBCB bookmarked forever because of that glorious cake featured in their profile photo. 

But alas. I stopped in as I was in this part of town I never venture to, excited for a simple morning treat: my classic litmus test of a croissant and coffee, add one oreo cheesecake for a friend. 

The good, as has been stated by others--service, and that 10% Yelp discount. Food's affordable. But that's never the full reason anyone goes anywhere. You have to enjoy what you consume. 

So here I am, at home, not finishing my croissant. Sacrilege. It's one of those styrofoam versions, lacking any and all taste. It's not buttery soft inside, nor flaky or crunchy on the outside. It's just tough. And if you can't croissant right, then I'd not lay down dollar for anything more significant. 

My friend seemed to enjoy the cheesecake, but when I tried a portion, it was heavy on the crust and light on flavor, like its cousin. I haven't ever made a croissant, but I've made my share of cheesecakes; this one didn't pass muster."}
{"text":"Come here for breakfast, lunch, or sweet treats, it is all yummy. My family loves riding our bikes to The Mad Batter. It's right off the Henderson bike path at Horizon. Come try it, enjoy it!"}
{"text":"So happy that my client decided to meet here before we viewed some houses! The breakfast options are so good and are deliciously paired with some great coffee. If you love cheese and pastries you must check this place out."}
{"text":"Very marginal at best. French toast with Banana's or fruit is seriously a bad choice. They seem to be known for the biscuits and gravy (which they had ran out). The coffee is simply terrible. 

The place has such a nice atmosphere and decor! The food on the breakfast side it a big negative."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for breakfast, but bummer I was too late for it! They had a brunch menu dishes available so I ordered the Billy Goat. A simple sandwich of bacon, egg over easy and goat cheese...yes goat cheese..a favorite of mine. Came with a side, for 8.95 ...pretty good deal for this savory meal. On the sweet side, I got their inspired GS samoa cookie. They improved it size wise from the last time I was here. Good stuff!!! I actually thought , whoa these cookies tasted way better than the prepacked ones sold at the infamous Milk Bar place on the strip! Proof that local bakeries are the way to go!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! A diamond in the rough. The breakfast food here is over-the-top fantastic. They also make a pumpkin spice coffee, hot or cold, using real pumpkin purée, that is amazing (a fall requirement, of course!)! This isn't fast food so come ready to sit down and enjoy. The wait is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Don't be afraid of the humble strip mall setting, this place is just good solid breakfast! Staff is attentive and friendly and the food is above grade for most diner-style breakfast fare. If the French toast casserole is on the menu don't pass it up!"}
{"text":"Location: small little area in the same complex as McDonald's towards the back area. Hard to find. The space is small and the ventilation is poor so when we sat to drink our coffees our eyes were watery from the smoke and as to be expected, we smelled like burnt fried food and smoke. Even our purses smelled like it. Ugh! 
 
Coffee: My friend ordered the Cookies n Cream specialty coffee and there were supposed to be small little crumbs of cookies, well, there were none in her drink. Mind you, she paid for the cost of this specialty coffee and the ingredients were not there nor was there any shots of espresso. The taste of this drink was so bland, it was not worth to drink or PAY! 

This is my first and last tome to ever give my business to The Mad Batter Cafe. It's not worth the time and money for the kind of items we received and PAID FOR. Two thumbs down."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was due to being close to the end of the day, but the cupcake I got was terrible. I love salted caramel anything,  so of course I got the salted caramel cupcake, and well, sadly, one little nibble was all I could take and I had to discard even that! It was so dry and tasted like it had been severely burned! The blueberry scone was better, but way too sweet for my liking. Also, the girl working the front counter didnt seem to know ANYTHING about any of the available products! Every question I asked, she had absolutely no answer for. Unfortunately I do not think I will ever be back."}
{"text":"I saw this bakery posted on yelp.  It looked fun and so my husband & I went out to see it on our way to Boulder city.  First, I think I need to tell folks in Vegas, please do not go to a bakery in this town first thing in the morning. I am a morning person.. It must be everywhere else that folks get up and prepare fresh pastries and muffins and sweets at wee hours of the morning...You won't find it in Vegas. The stuff in the case had been there since the day before. I really wanted the maple bacon scone.. well the one in the showcase, the only one, was broken in 3 places.  I did buy it, at FULL price.. no discount offered nothing. They only have ONE type of coffee.  Nothing appealing beside cake pops in the showcase, didn't even have the bakery aroma when you walked in.  It is tiny.. It might be better at other times during the day.. I don't know.  I won't drive out of my way to see.  The Drago sisters on Rainbow was the same way.. Closed on sunday and day old stuff on Monday morning.. bleh..."}
{"text":"How do you post -5 stars??? An hour and no service on the \"dog patio\" (a concrete slab next to the building about 5 ft wide. Why were we still there after an hour? We met our kids and g-kids, got there before they did, ordered 2 coffees (they don't serve any decaf), & water. Kids arrived, we're still waiting. Girl came out and took our order, 6 people w/ several sides, not a small ticket, if you know what I mean. Waited 10-15 minutes more.Kids went in (daughter worked many years as waitress working her way through law school & MBA), has lots of respect for 'wait staff'. Asked what's the deal. \"It's really crazy\", however we'd seen through the window tables 'turning over' several times. I finally went in and asked for a tray, offering to bring out our coffee and water, but owner apologized, said she'd be right out. She asked for our order again...? What? And BTW, they were out of the quiche one of us ordered, it may be a little wait.  Are u kidding me?
Glee P, Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Saw that it was a new business in the area and wanted to check it out. 

They did not have prices on listed in front of the sweets, nor did they really have any descriptions of what some of the sweets were. 

1 sugar cookie with sprinkles + 3 macaroons = $8.97

OUCH! 

Based on price, probably would not come back...but on the upside the cookie was very moist."}
{"text":"I can't believe that this place is still open! It is so horribly smoky from the grill that you can barely breathe, their \"specialty coffees\" are hardly special, and neither is the food! I've been there a total of 3 times, each visit worst than the last. I don't usually bother with poor reviews,  but this time was the last straw. I ordered the salad with balsamic chicken. Not only did the chicken have no flavor whatsoever, it had a weird consistency like tofu. The rest of the salad left alot to be desired as well. It was inedible. The waitress could see I wasn't eating it and didn't bother asking if anything was wrong. And again, 20 min later when she cleared our plates, mine completely full, she didn't bother asking if there was a problem. When the check came, I expected that I wouldn't be charged $14 for something I couldn't eat. When I asked the manager about it, she said she could give me a discount, it was 10%! What a joke. Then they had the nerve to ask if i wanted to purchase pastries! Lit the worst dining experience ever!"}
{"text":"Ate at The Mad Batter Café for the first time yesterday and I will definitely be back. I ordered the croissant sandwich with the potato hash and a pumpkin spice latte. Everything was delicious. The potato hash was similar to my mom's cheesy potatoes, which is my favorite. The staff was friendly and welcoming and the decor was adorable."}
{"text":"Sent an email request for a call back. Never got one. Called to see about getting a cake made said yes they could. Someone would get back to me. Still haven't heard back so I had to go to another bakery to get cake done. This is just bad customer service. Not sure if their cakes are even good. Lost my vote."}
{"text":"No breakfast items after 11:00am on a Saturday. Not really impressed. Walked in and it was busy but not jammed. The staff appeared overmatched. Open grill is fine and kinda cool but ventilation needs help. We won't be back."}
{"text":"my family and I really enjoyed our breakfast at this little local café. the owner and staff were extremely friendly. The food was great, you have to try the pastries and desserts"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Lots of delicious sandwiches, salads, and -- best of all -- desserts!  We tried the Philly, the bacon jam sliders, and the loaded egg BLTA.  All great!  But the bakery items were terrific...the cheesecake, the homemade Samoas, the berry danish, and the banana Nutella toaster streudel were all yum!  We may come back tomorrow and try breakfast!"}
{"text":"We were in the market for a graduation cake for my son who is obsessed with macarons. They make a giant macaron cake, which we ordered two. They were both different in color and flavors,  which exceeded our expectations. The owner worked with us and made the entire ordering and pick up process a breeze. It was a pleasure to work with them and know I did not have to worry about anything. We will be ordering ALL of our special occasion cakes from The Mad Batter! On a side note, I enjoyed a watermelon feta salad-not to be missed!!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming when it first opened but the menu now has less to offer and they have gotten rid of the tri-tip salad that was so yummy. The coffee is only meh so that isn't a draw to come in. Frankly there are better bakeries in Henderson so the baked goods aren't a draw either."}
{"text":"PROS:
+ If you can catch their breakfast menu, the Mad Batter Skillet is incredible. It's like death by cheese, and I'm not complaining! It's a skillet with a biscuit bottom, topped with quiche, cheese, mushrooms, onions, and a creamy sriracha sauce for a little kick. Portion looks deceptively small but is really filling, I couldn't finish it. Pairs with side of your choice, the potato casserole hash stuff is awesome.
+ Fresh baked goods, with the pastry chef on hand to describe the options and make recommendations. Got a cupcake with fresh cranberry filling that I otherwise never would have tried, due to her detailed description and enthusiasm.
+ Coffee! Their roast is from Colorado River Roasters, located in nearby Boulder City. Plenty of flavored options. The pumpkin spice is an indulgent choice, topped with whipped cream and fresh crumble. It's practically a dessert. Soy milk is available.
+ Very friendly service. I sat at the bar since I was dining solo and was checked on by every staff member present at least once, and they were all genuinely friendly and cheerful despite the morning rush.
+ One of the few spots to carry Manbake Beefcake options! I prefer the real baked goods though. Go big or go home.
+ 10% off with Yelp check in, what what!

CONS (there aren't many, I swear!)
- Limited exterior signage makes this spot a little difficult to find if you're unfamiliar with the area. They seem to do enough business, I just wonder if they'd get more if they had more prominent signage. Parking lot is also fairly small. I mean really this is all positive because I want them to move closer to me, really...
- The pastry case was full of lovely options, but none of them were labelled and there is only a limited list of pricing on the posted menu above the bar. I asked other employees for info and they weren't able to name some items or really give any details, only the pastry chef seemed to really know what was going on in there.
- Despite the great description, the cranberry-filled cupcake I had was a little disappointing. Cake itself was a little dry and crumbly, filling was minimal. Their cafe menu seems to be their forte."}
{"text":"Love this place. Staff is great, dinner was outstanding, and desserts are a must. Can't wait to return for the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever had. The people are amazing and helpful. The food is fresh and creative bursting with flavor."}
{"text":"This restaurant went above and beyond to ensure that I received my order, even when GrubHub dropped the ball. Their food is delicious! I had the savory crepes and the cheddar biscuits, I truly could not be happier with my meal. Check them out if you're looking for a great food in Henderson. 10/10 would order from them again."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and we came about 30 minutes before closing but we were just gonna go in and eat really quickly and leave. but once we got into the door the girl that greeted us did now look happy lmfao, anyways, kinda rude just a lil bit and kept glancing at me that made me uncomfortable but the food was bomb."}
{"text":"I ordered the stack attack which was biscuits and gravy with eggs, bacon, and hash. They were not that good. Nothing tasted fresh except for the eggs. I saw bacon being reheated on the griddle. 

I also ordered the mixed berry crepes and it tasted good. However, the crepes were not fresh as I saw them being reheated when ordered. They had premade the crepes a few hours earlier in preparation for service. It seems like laziness on the kitchen's part because it doesn't take that long to make a crepe especially when this place does make fresh pancakes.

Despite the food being reheated, service was also slow. For a place that more or less premade everything, I don't see why food service wasn't quicker."}
{"text":"This place was real small but had a lot of spice. Our waiter Whitney was awesome and made our first visit very welcoming. We went around 1pm and it wasn't busy. We ordered the Stack Attack and Crab Cake Stack. They both were  really good and the gravy is what made it delicious. They also have bacon jam which is really good. If you really like it you can buy it in a jar. They also have specialty lattes. I got a iced white chocolate raspberry and it was ok. I probably should have got it hot because it was a little bitter to me. Their pastries looked really good and I will have to try next time."}
{"text":"Had lunch here a few days ago and am just getting around to review it. Cute little cafe with nice decor. My daughter and I had wraps that came with salads. The Wrap was ehh but the salad was great. I do plan on returning for breakfast and am hoping the experience is better. Probably would not return for lunch but I'm still interested in trying the pastries!!!

Till next time!!!"}
{"text":"I went with family on Memorial Day and the service was great! Very quaint decor, delicious food! Prices aren't bad either. I could see this becoming a regular spot for me/my family."}
{"text":"This place was soooo good. A friend of ours had been telling us for weeks to try this place out so this morning my fiance surprised me with a breakfast date and brought me here. I ordered the XL Bacon Jam and the thing was so big i brought some of it home. The place is a little on the small side but i like that about it. Our server was Jon and he was amazing very nice and kept checking on us. The food came out quickly and very hot. It was a little hard to find because its hidden but its a hidden gem in my book. Got a dessert for later so ill review that later."}
{"text":"I went here one day during lunch because it is really close to my work but also because I had a Groupon for it!  I had been wanting to try it and was happy that I got to, unfortunately it was not as good as I had hoped.  The staff were very kind but seemed to be in a rush as they closed in 40 minutes.  
The review of the food is not going to be as descriptive as usual as I've forgotten what the names of what I ordered were.  Pictures are attached though.  I got a sandwich, cup of soup, biscuit and apple butter, scone, and a samoa cookie.  I've got to say, the food was pretty bland except for the soup which had way too much salt in it.  The biscuit was too dense and the apple butter lacked in flavor.  The sandwich was pretty dry and the scone and samoa cookie were fine but not the best I've had.  
This place is obviously popular and cute and hopefully I just came on a bad day or at a bad time.  I will give this place another try as they have much to offer but for being as excited as I was to try this place, I was pretty disappointed after eating the food."}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast, lunch, and/or a pastry with a cup of coffee.  Their macarons are absolutely heaven!  I enjoy meeting potential clients here, and the owner is always very accommodating when it comes to someone's special dietary needs.  One person in particular had a food allergy.  The owner went so far as to clean the entire grill top prior to preparing the dish to ensure that my guest wouldn't have an allergic reaction.  That's outstanding customer service!!!!  Thanks, everyone, for your wonderful, friendly service.  You guys are the best!"}
{"text":"Service and food was great. Love the balsamic chicken,bacon and avocado sandwich"}
{"text":"I'm a fan, the skillet was amazing, the breakfast burrito was delicious, and all was filling! Flavored creamers made my day with coffee and attentive service. 

Nice crowd at 9am; full but no wait. Hope lots of Yelpers continue to try it out; it's worth it!"}
{"text":"The food was good, the service not so great.  Had to keep asking for cream and sugar for coffee and had to ask for napkins.  Most upsetting was no nutritional information and my 3 year old was just diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.  He can eat and drink whatever, but it's very important we know the carbs in everything he eats.  It wouldn't have been so bad if he made an attempt to help when we explained, but nope.  It was not busy so I'm sure he could have made an effort."}
{"text":"Such a cute and fun bakery! I've been here twice and everything I have gotten is amazing! The portions are a good size for the price and the bakery items are DELICIOUS! 

They have a great breakfast menu with lots of options and all sorts of coffee and drinks. Great place for kids too!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast for the second time bc the food is pretty decent. I ordered the cinnamon roll (which was hard as a rock) I also ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich with scrambled egg and asked to sub it with a biscuit. Her response was no I don't want to ask the cook he's in a bad mood. My order came out wrong and the first thing they asked if I wanted a a refund or to remake it. Of course i want it remade I'm starving !!! Please find  staff that aren't in bad moods and actually want to work and make money. Also, the ventilation in this place is horrible. I left smelling like grease from head to toe."}
{"text":"I ordered the lemon crepes....the container they came in probably tastes better. They are plain and are absolutely horrible. When I called the gentleman answering seemed disinterested. He could have at least offered to replace this tasteless crap. Will never order from here ever again

Have to add that the order of California Avocado Crepes is actually tasteless as well. The only decent thing we got today was the hash browns which was a tiny portion so with that being said we are getting in the car to get a decent breakfast somewhere else."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was comfortable.  The service was good. The food was a bit bland; it was missing something.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out for this morning. When we got there and sat down no one came up to us for a good 5 minutes. A couple that walked in after I did had their order taken before anyone even came up to us. Finally a waitress who had been standing behind the counter the whole time took my order. We're sitting there waiting 30 minutes go by and she comes back up to us and says \"did I take your order\"... Are you kidding me. She completely forgot to put our order in and was smiling while she was telling us. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced and I will NEVER return. Don't be a waitress if you can't even take an order right."}
{"text":"I was in the area and was hungry and found this quaint little place. It doesn't look like much on the outside since it's located in a small building next to a Fast Cash and nail spa. When you walk in you feel that \"mad hatter\" vibe which I like. It's also cute with all the positive quotes written on the walls. 

It definitely smells good in there, just like bacon! I ordered the Billy Goat with a side of Watermelon Feta salad and some coffee. The egg sandwich was definitely tasty, and the goat cheese was fresh...and that bacon! I'm not really a bacon or pork eater, but that is some of the best bacon I've tried. The salad was zesty with the balsamic dressing and feta. The coffee was actually really good too, not to strong or light but just right for my liking. I also ordered a cannoli (first time trying one), a couple of Samoas and an Orange Cran scone. The filling in the cannoli was light and fluffy, but quite small. The quality of ingredients was fresh and good. However, I do think it was a tad pricey since the portions were \"just right\" and it didn't yield any left-overs. The server was also a little indifferent, but still friendly and not rude or anything.  

Overall, really I'd give a 3.5 because I thought it was little pricey for the amount of food you get. The sandwich was $9.70 (w/extra egg), the coffee was $3 (bottomless) the cannolis are $1.50 each, the Samoas $1.50, and the scone $3. The last two are worth it since they are kinda big. Haven't tasted them yet, but they sure look good. I think if they made the portions a little bigger or lowered their prices a bit, it'd be a better value. I do however, understand that it's a smaller establishment so the prices are going to be higher because of that. They do give coupons when you cash out for your next order, and have Yelp! offers when you check in so that's a plus.

I'm sure I'll be back to try out the other menu items. It's still worth it!"}
{"text":"Since we were visiting Las Vegas we used a groupon we found for this place. It was a 20 min drive from the strip, but from the reviews we'd thought we'd give it a try. My kids got the s'mores pancakes and banana cream French toast. They loved their food, except one kid complained the banana cream was too thick (I know we can't please em all! Lol) My husband got an eggs Benedict type of meal and he really liked it. I got the biscuits and gravy and I think my kids enjoyed that more than me. The gravy was the exact same gravy they used on my husbands meal. I also had a small French onion soup. Nothing special about it. I really just thought the food was okay. 

Overall. The portions are decently sized and my family enjoyed their meals. We were on sugar overload from the pancakes and French toast so we didn't get to try any of their desserts but they looked really good. According to my family the food would get a 4. 

However, I couldn't really enjoy the food as much as I'd like because my eyes were burning from the smoke from where they were cooking the food. Which is right smack dab in the middle of the small restaurant. My daughter and I had to step outside several times into the fresh air for my eyes to stop burning. 

Everything was pretty pricey so on top of the groupon which covered $40 worth of food we paid another $20. My husband hands the cashier a $100 bill and he had the nerve to ask him if he needed change. We are usually very fair tippers and the service wasn't the best or the worst, but a $80 tip?"}
{"text":"Whenever we have to make the trek to Heritage Park, the daughter and I make the point to stop at the Mad Batter. We have always had good service and great food. Make the stop, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a weekend morning and we were seated right away. Service was friendly and it seems like a family business which is awesome. We ordered flavored coffees, I believe mine was one with Nutella. They don't serve espresso so they dress up regular coffee. I ordered mine half sweet and it was so sweet that I could not drink it! My husbands was worse, we're talking sweeter than soda. This place has batter in the name so let's get to the good stuff- I had pumpkin Crepes and they were out of this world delicious. My husband had waffles, I think with apples and cinnamon, and they were also phenomenal! I highly recommend this place for a breakfast treat! I know they aren't a Café but if they upped their coffee game it'd be another star from me..."}
{"text":"I loved the feel of this place, like a small town coffee shop. I ordered the spinach scramble with a side of potato hash. I can't rave enough about how good the potato hash was!!! If I could I would eat a tub of it. Some down falls were I tried a banana split cupcake and was very disappointed especially it being a bakery.. Another issue was it was a bit toasty in there, I know the weather has cooled down but I almost felt like there was no air. I will definitely be returning to try other food menu items and continue to support local businesses!"}
{"text":"I think the concept of this place is cute, but the food is just meh. I was drawn to this place when I read they had a breakfast sandwich with goat cheese. Some places are really skimpy with their goat cheese (if they offer it) but this place put a generous amount which made me happy. Comparing the sandwich to the one my husband makes at home though made me realize I could have saved the money and had it at home which isn't a feeling I like to have while dining out. 

As far as their iced coffee, it's awful. I tried drowning it in sugar and cream but even that couldn't mask it. Whatever brand they use needs to be switched or something. It had such a strange burnt taste. I ended up getting coffee from the McDonald's next door right after because I'm admittedly a coffee addict and needed my fix.  

Not sure if I'll go back. Not a horrible place, but if I'm spending money on food it's because I want something I can't make on my own that tastes as good."}
{"text":"Food is great and service outstanding.  My wife had the crepes and I had the tradional breakfast.  Both were good and enjoyable .  The young man who served us as friendly and helpful.  We will be back.  Nice to have a local breakfast place here in Henderson.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Went to the mad batter for the first time today after searching Yelp for places to eat lunch in the area!  We loved it !  The food is really good and friendly staff. We will definitely go back again! We got a cheeseburger, the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant and my aunt ordered the caprese sandwich, but had them use feta cheese instead of mozzarella cheese. All was so tasty!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! I cannot believe it's taken me so long to find this cute gem. The service is excellent and the food is super delicious. They even make custom cakes and have a little bakery. I love the decor too. Very rustic and chalkboard everywhere. Just super cute all around and charming! Check out this place and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! The food was excellent and the service was even better. The biscuits and gravy were phenomenal."}
{"text":"I've been dying to get to this place since I saw their temporary sign go up, a few months back. We drove by on a Wednesday afternoon when I spotted their 'Now Open' sign, to my delight.

We walked in and immediately loved the decor and atmosphere. Handmade furnishings, and the wood bar is beautiful. The menu was still being created and written, but the gal behind the counter took her time and explained specials, named the desserts in the case with patience (I had a million macaron questions!) and even asked our names in an attempt to remember us, her new and permanent customers.

Between the hubby, son and I, we chose to try a caramel tart, a chocolate nutella macaron, a chocolate chip muffin, a slice of the bacon cheddar bread..everything was delicious. I've already arranged future lunch dates and morning coffee runs..

LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Tried many of the macaroons and the bread pudding, both of which were excellent. Nice to have a local bakery nearby. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had it not been for Yelp, I probably would've never known this place existed! Even after all the times I've driven down College to get to CSN! Not sure if it's because it's hidden behind McDonald's or if it's because there's no direct sign on the exterior of the café, but regardless, it's a good place to come for breakfast, brunch, and lunch!

The menu is rather small, but offers a variety of sweet, savory, and even healthy options! 

Clearly, I was not interested in a healthy option and went with the Stack Attack from the House Favorites menu and oh my god, the layer of potato hash was heavenly! It was cheesy and just, perfect. The biscuit was okay, nothing special, and I thought the same of the homemade gravy. The gravy had some type of sausage in it and it wasn't as hot as I would've liked it, but it was decent. My meal left me feeling like I needed a nap!

My girlfriend ordered the Spicy Bacon Croissant since it was recommended by our server. She enjoyed it, but there were too many jalapeño slices in it for her liking. 

We stopped by on a Saturday morning and it was quite busy. The café's interior isn't very big and there are a limited amount of tables, which were all occupied at the time. We sat at the bar and I didn't mind because we were able to watch our meal being made from start to finish. It might seem odd, but I thought it was neat how everything was made on a very small griddle, about the size of a kitchen stove. However, I did notice that there wasn't a good ventilation system going on because from the moment we walked in, the air was completely smoky. Towards the end of our meal, my eyes started to bother me because of the smoke from the griddle.

Our food was good and the staff was friendly. The baked goods looked a bit disappointing, but I could be wrong. Maybe I'll give 'em a go during my next visit!"}
{"text":"Cute small cafe, my negatives are it's $$ with horrible parking, the positives is the food is ok.
     I can say the coffee is good and the pastries are awesome. So I gave it a 4 out of 5. Its just not my first chose for breakfast,
    But really, this part of Henderson needs more places like this (with a few changes maybe)."}
{"text":"Adorable, truly LOCAL, cafe! Definitely had an inviting atmosphere from walk in through departure. Unique menu items mixed with traditional for the unadventurous. We ordered the breakfast burrito and the wild berry crepes. Delish!! Not a lot of seating but on a weekday at 9am finding an open table was not a problem. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way to the Hoover Dam and I have to admit I was a little apprehensive mostly because of the location and small-ish menu. I was pleasantly surprised and the food was pretty good. The lady who helped us (I assume the owner?) was so nice and sweet. I got the Heaven burger without the bun and my beau got the Billy Goat (I think). My burger ended up coming with a bun but nbd I took it off. It was a good burger. I liked the combination of everything that it came with and it was all cooked really well. My beau liked the breakfast sandwich and said the goat cheese went really well with the chives. They have great flavors! The coffee was okay to me (tasted like an IPA) but my beau loved it. Would definitely recommending going here. It's a small place"}
{"text":"Their signature dish the mad skillet is outstanding. The potatoes that come on the side are also yummy however all three times that I have been there they have been completely different. Over cooked,  undercooked, or not fresh. Atmosphere is nice concept is cool. But I expect gourmet and delicious coffee options from a place that presents themselves this way. Coffee is terrible. Ask for an ice coffee get iced milk basically.  Hot coffee comes out of one old pot old school diner style refills are sparse. Macaroons and overall baked goods are ridiculously overpriced. Which is very unfortunate because I would love to take some things home wish there was more of a variety and more reasonable prices. A lot of the reviews say the same thing they really should take this criticism as constructive and make a few improvements."}
{"text":"We both loved the uniqueness of this cute place to eat. Not your normal Menu that you are use to of all the big chain restaurants. We both give this place 2 Thumbs up. Please try them, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went here today and the pesto grilled cheese was really good, as was the watermelon feta salad. But the cheesecake I had was a complete let down, I love all cheesecake I can get. But this one was dry, flakey, tasted like cheap Vanilla. Rainbow cheesecake no thanks!"}
{"text":"I had the breakfast burrito (not on the menu) and it was so good! It had sausage, egg, cheesy potatoes,  sour cream, the works. On the side I received more cheesy potatoes, like hash browns. We also tried the biscuits and gravy and they were pretty good, too. The service was very friendly and inviting. I'll definitely be back to try the crepes!"}
{"text":"This place is NOT a gluten-free establishment. They have 2 items on the menu that are, and allegedly an item or 2 in the bake case. The servers had NO CLUE when asked what was gf. Not worth the drive over here for what I was expecting. Also, there is a 3% up charge for using a credit card so have cash."}
{"text":"I love this place. Every meal I ordered never disappoint. My family come here often. They have games section where kids can access easily which my boy loves.
I gave a 4 star because As much as I want to like their pastries and desserts, I'm always disappointed. Everytime we go, I come home with a couple desserts from their fridge case hoping it will blow my mind but they always taste like the fridge and I can smell some bacon oil or some type of oil on either the cupcake frosting or the cookies. Maybe the place needs more ventilation? The last time I went, I bought the chocolate peanut butter Macaron cake that looked delicious and pretty but when I tried it, it was nothing but sweet with a hint of oil and fridge smell. It was so strong I couldn't taste the chocolate and peanut butter flavor. The buttercrem melts in my mouth which shows they use high quality ingredients. And They have this cruffin which is a must to try!!! I think from now on I'll stick with their freshmade food and cruffin."}
{"text":"Family environment, small, very nice service, true smiling people, absolutely not industrial food carefully prepared and served, the best american coffee in LV. What is missing? Maybe a espresso...."}
{"text":"Decided to order from this place on UberEATS. Should have just made my own breakfast like I originally planned. 

We ordered the:
Oreo French Toast: is regular French Toast with chocolate syrup. Nothing Oreo about it. Nothing special. Chocolate syrup was overpowering and gross. 

Side: cottage cheese, which was borderline spoiled. It was completely inedible. 

Billy Goat: soggy sandwich. Bread has no crunch or toast to it. Taste is a little undesirable, like something might be off about the goat cheese. 

Side: potato hash. *This was the highlight of everything ordered* 

Everything, aside from the hash, found its way to the garbage missing a single bite."}
{"text":"Wow....if you have breathing issues....DO NOT GO HERE!  The place was filled with smoke & burnt grease smell!  No ventilation at all! It was terrible!  I had read that was an issue...and it clearly still is!  I unfortunately ordered the crepes.  And let me tell ya.....they were the worst crepes I've ever had in my life! The texture & taste...was that of a rubber band.  There were cold, old & the batter was like flour & water.....that was microwaved.  Absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  That's the closest analogy I can give you.  The fact they only give you 3 little 6 inch crepes with 1 slice of lemon....would have been an issue....but since they were so horrible.....it made no difference. More of them wouldn't have made them any more edible. My husband had a BLT....and it was sub-par.  Bacon was hard as a rock & burnt.  They put it on Texas toast....which is at least 2 inches thick...and only 3 pieces of bacon on it.  Not impressed at all!  $28 & some change for these 2 items & 2 sodas.  I'm not sure how this place stays open.  It appears they were originally just a bakery.....and perhaps that's what they should've stayed.  The poor guy trying to cook on this little griddle....with smoke bellowing throughout every corner of this tiny place....is intolerable! Waitress was nice....but seemed overwhelmed for some unknown reason.  When I told her I wanted crepes...she told me to go to this new crepe place on Eastern.  I WISH I had taken her advice! And after she brought our food....we never saw her again.  She never came back to ask us how everything was...nor did she even come back to give us our check.  We had to ask some young waiter guy for our check.  There is a McD's right next door....and a egg mcmuffin would have been 100% better for a fraction of the cost!  Needless to say....there is no way we will ever come back here!"}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service today was terrible.  Asked for water and she only filled one of our glasses.  For the price, I expected to have better service.  Maybe if you sit at the bar, where they can't ignore you...  No condiments were brought to the table.  Asked for the check three times, finally had to go the to the counter to get attention.  Again, for the price, they need to do a better job at service.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. You can also get Manbake products here if you're into high-protein foods."}
{"text":"Visited the other day, nothing had prices, I don't like that, then I found out the prices...$2.50 for a single macaroon! What? Asked about a cupcake, also expensive, I can't seem to remember at the moment,  I did purchase something, bacon maple sconce, it was good... But due to the high prices I won't be back.  

It's important for me to support local business I just have to afford it."}
{"text":"Happy yelp find.  Small, clean restaurant with some excellent CRCR coffee.  The mascarpone french toast was very good as well as the 2-egg breakfast.  We added extra fruit and the good-but-not-good-for-you gravy and walked out paying $36 for 2 (including tip).  The biscuits and gravy live up to the other yelpers opinion...delicious.  Service was quick and friendly and it appeared to be a small family-run place.  The men's room was clean but there were no hand towels.  Also, ditto on the ventilation...could be better but it wasn't smokey. We'll be back and sit outside next time with our dogs (the bowl of water is a nice touch). Great to see such a good restaurant in gool ol' Henderson."}
{"text":"Small, intimate breakfast spot with interesting menu choices like quinoa. Short order cook is in full sight if you sit at the bar. Specialty coffee options looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Good cheese steak and good pumpkin iced coffee, but a little pricey and the scones are overpriced and dry."}
{"text":"It's very cute but they need to have breakfast all day not just until 11. I was in there today for lunch... I got one coffee, a sandwhich, and a scone for 17 dollars. NOW  I would find that price acceptable if my sandwhich was a whole sandwhich (it was a half!),  the scone wasn't rock hard, and they had gotten coffee order right. I had ordered an iced black coffee with flavoring... i had gotten a hot plain black coffee. Myself, being farmilar with the  culinary arts in particular pastries, knows the texture and how a scone should taste... this \"thing\" was ROCK hard and had next to no flavor. I was very disappointed and after leaving I left feeling like my walet had just been raped for mediocre service and over priced food."}
{"text":"I can honestly say this is one of the best breakfast joints I have ever been to. Staff is so friendly and helpful and the food is incredible. The atmosphere is that of a small town cafe, makes you feel right at home. They make their own salsa and jam in house. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this cafe for desserts and coffees. We only tried the specialty coffees today there was no interesting pastries in their selection like in the yelp photos. I ordered specialty coffee but it was super blant. I tried the cookies and cream coffee it tasted so watery, I don't think there was any espresso at all. It tasted like regular coffee with water and there was no oreo pieces as the description implied. Im glad I just tried coffee first on this visit rather than ordering a meal. If they can't get the coffee right im not coming back. 

Our waitress is extremely nice and welcoming I sincerely appreciated that being a first timer here. She was kind enough to offer help and explain their menu and the coffees. 

Beware of the bad grease trap ventilation if you dont want to smell like grease and cooked food like we did. It was all over me, my clothes, shoes, watch and purse :'( that's how strong it was. Urgh.."}
{"text":"Mad Batter cafe is the only place I go to for breakfast.I'm not a breakfast food person, but I've actually driven from summerlin to Henderson because I was craving their biscuits and gravy. You have to try a side order of the potato hash, it's one of a kind in my opinion . everything is fresh and always tastes good and fresh.I like that's it's very cute and quaint inside, giving the ambiance of a small town coffee shop, away from the crazy city!!!!"}
{"text":"All foods are very creative and delicious!! The waiter and waitress are very friendly. We are from LA and happen to find this cafe by Yelp. It's a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Mad batter did our wedding cake and it was amazing. Brittney was so easy to work with and the cake was delicious and beautifully done. We were able to do different cake flavors with each tier which is exactly what we wanted. 
We also ordered cake pops from here and they matched our wedding perfectly and at a great price. The cake pops were delicious and the perfect little wedding favor!"}
{"text":"They've updated the menu and the new food tastes great!"}
{"text":"I only have good things to say about this place. I grabbed some cupcakes from this place and they were delicious. Staff is super friendly and the prices are reasonable. Super cute and locally owned...what's not to love?"}
{"text":"\"Cake Pop Thursday\" is a thing!

You don't get many locations in Vegas that have the small town feel. Mad Batter has this vibe plus amazing bakery smells as soon as you walk in. They specialize in all things tasty; wedding cakes, everyday cakes, breakfast pastries and \"Cruffins\", you need to try the Cruffins.

I came in on a Thursday morning and the was place empty. I asked if they get a rush later in they day and I was told lunch and the weekend brunches are packed.

I was greeted with a menu and a list of the bakery items. I was feeling savory so I ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side of house potatoes. Holy shazbot!, this was a lot of food. The biscuits are made in house, flakey buttery pillows coated in rich sausage gravy, also a house recipe. This could easily feed two people, you two huge split biscuits coated in a lightly spiced up gravy that was loaded with sausage. B&G lovers this one's for you!

The house potatoes were basically scalloped style loaded with cheese and topped with french fried onions that normally come on top of green beans at holiday dinners. It's a house favorite, but not my favorite. 

The bakery items here very good. Like I stated Cake Pop Thursday was in full affect, which means buy one, get one free! I got the chocolate cake pop and a vanilla/almond pop. The chocolate was dry, but I really enjoyed the vanilla & almond pop, super moist and not too sweet

Lets talk Cruffins; a muffin, croissant hybrid that comes filled with either strawberry jam or any other amazing filling they have on hand that day. I went with strawberry jam and it was fantastic. A light flaky muffin with crunch buttery top, oh my. Definitely have them heat it up for the full Cruffin experience. 

The people who work here are awesome and the service was fantastic. I need to explore this menu a few more times... maybe 5 more. See ya soon Mad Batter!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place based on its proximity to my home but I felt it was average. I stopped in to grab some treats to bring home and stood at the counter for several minutes while a couple servers buzzed around the room. A young woman behind the counter slowly rifled through receipts and the register and didn't even look at me for a few minutes. Right off the bat the customer service frustrated me. The pastries were nothing extravagant; standard cannoli, cupcakes, peanut butter cookie sandwich. The cinnamon roll was not good. The icing was ok but the cake itself was dry and not tasty. We will try again for breakfast and see how it goes."}
{"text":"This was my first time here for Brunch. Very cute little place! The food was awesome! Customer service was also great! I I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food, treats, cake, and service. My favorite is the French toast with potato hash, but everything has been amazing. My son's first experience of eating biscuits & gravy and it is his first request if we are going to go to breakfast. I've taken my family for lunch and they have a great variety of options. I haven't had anything I didn't like from there. 

They did my daughter's cake, for her 12th birthday. It was Batman themed and my daughter designed it. They were super thrilled with her ideas and more than happy to accommodate. 

So thrilled they are in my neighborhood. Love the inviting environment. Great locals place."}
{"text":"This is a small establishment with homemade food. My son and I love breakfast food, and we loved theirs. The hash potatoes are cheesy!!!! OMG!! They are delicious  the service is great,  they keept checking in on us and refilling my huge cup of coffee. I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Super great atmosphere! Service is great. Food is wonderful. Looks small from the outside but is much bigger inside!"}
{"text":"Very impressed!! Being a small business owner myself, I try to frequent these types of places. I am really routing for Mad Batter's success!! The staff is awesome and the food is amazing. The cafe is adorable and very clean. I think I'll order my next cake from them. Keep up the good work guys! See you again soon!!"}
{"text":"By now we have finally tried the breakfast and I totally love their potatoe hash and biscuits and gravy! My mom and I have decided this is our favorite place in Henderson! I always have to have a hot pumpkin spice, regardless if we're having breakfast or lunch.. For lunch today I tried the bbq chicken sandwich, the Apple slaw puts it over the top! Once again the watermelon feta salad remains a favorite, my daughter loved the potatoe soup and my son said his philly cheesesteak was amazing!! I always look forward to taking home some almond butter and homemade strawberry jelly for my nightly sandwich!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had been wanting to try this place since we had heard good things and it's right by our house. I had ordered an iced Nutella coffee which didn't come until the end of our meal which was odd but once it came it tasted terrible. I gave it to my husband and he threw it out after one sip. The reason I'm giving 3 stars was because the food was really good! The baked goods looked delicious as well!"}
{"text":"1. Get better service. 
2. Get more high chairs. 
The food is amazing and it's sad that you have to deal with such incompetent people."}
{"text":"Great service, food, and chill ambiance.

I had the stack and a creme cheese danish.. Both of these items was out of sight.

For the stack which is a flaky biscuit with a couple over easy eggs on top, sitting on a layer of crunchy hash browns, and smothered with gravy. Ow and you can choose between sausage patties and bacon in the stack. The pro move is to go with the sausage Patty! It's a better compliment to the gravy! Yum.

The creme cheese danish was soooooo good! Flaky and light. Warning it is tasty but do not eat this in your car! Lol I did I had crumbs every where! On my shirt, beard, car you name it!  

I will def be back to try the pancakes here as well. The service here was warm and friendly. Just a great little spot to get your grub on."}
{"text":"Over-priced, small portions, mediocre quality, little to no flavor (Pork Verde Enchilladas), and forgot to include the eggs I paid extra for (it was a takeout order).

I might go back for a cookie or pastries but I will not order food from there again."}
{"text":"Yummy, friendly, cozy, home made. Good could have arrived a little faster. Dessert case is good."}
{"text":"Restaurant is pretty small but the food is delicious! I had the bacon quiche with a side of potato hash. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Nice little bakery located deep in Henderson. I came in with some friends and at this new spot and wasn't disappointed with the offerings. I tried the macaroons and was pleasantly surprised at the flavor and texture. The strawberry danish and cookies were excellent as well. They carry some non-traditional bakery style food as well such as biscuits and gravy and sandwiches as well. 

The staff was friendly and the service was great. Place has a pretty good atmosphere, like a quaint little cafe. You can help yourself to all the coffee and tea you want which is great. Definitely worth checking out if you are in this part of town."}
{"text":"It's a drive from southern highlands but well wort it. Great food loved the spinach wrapped burrito but I had to share it with my wife after she had a taste. I still won as I got to share her avocado crapes. 

We are looking forward to the danishes we are bringing home for later

Friendly staff and a fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"The good was AWESOME! It was hard to pick just a couple of items cause it all looked delicious. I will definitely come back when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"The food here is great. If you like the hash brown casserole from the Cracker Barrel, come get your life for way less gas."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly.  I was curious about all their goodies and pastries and the staff answered all my questions.  They also threw in a free pumpkin bread pudding with my order.  

I had their cookie batter macaron and cookie batter cupcake.  I will come back for those in the near future.  Too bad they don't have salted caramel macarons at the moment.  

They also offer brunch.  New menu.  I have yet to try.

I'm a fan of their sweets and pastries.  Brunch I will have to come back next time."}
{"text":"Delicious with great service. They have a few toys for kids too which is nice when your little ones start to get antsy. They also make dog treats that my dogs absolutely loved!"}
{"text":"Not kid friendly... to say the least!!!!! 
Went for lunch with a friend and her kids. when they brought the food out they told my friend that her son was being too loud. And the people at the table in front of us them left because of her son!  He's one! He was saying hi and thank you, and smiling the whole time! 
This is the definition of discrimination!!!! Please don't support this establishment."}
{"text":"Wow! Great food, wonderful atmosphere. Reminds me of something from the Gilmore girls. Can't wait to go back. Oreo French toast is it of this world.  Steak and eggs crepes were so good I almost stole it from my husband. Must try!!"}
{"text":"biscuits and gravy were awesome 2 of kids had pan cakes and they loved them my other kiddo had the eggs and greens and loved it"}
{"text":"We love this place!! It's not super fancy but the food is so delicious, you'll have to love it. We go almost every weekend we are in town for brunch. The biscuits and gravy and breakfast tacos are my faves. I love how they use random coffee cups with funny messages on them. All the bakery items are amazing!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I stumbled across this little cafe the food was good quick service. Not sure if it was the owner but her presence was not the frendliest. When I was paying I noticed the red velvet cheese cake I was disappointed the frosting tastes as if it was refrigerated for a few days horrible taste same thing from the cupcakes we ordered the sprinkles and the strawberry so not satisfied."}
{"text":"I came across the Mad Batter Café & Bakery at the Candle Lighters Fundraising Event a couple weeks back and loved all the desserts they were handing out (all different kinds). I ended up getting their business card as my work hosts different luncheons, catered breakfast, etc.

We decided to have them cater a breakfast about 2 weeks ago and it was great! Customer service was fast and friendly, Brittney gets back to me on all my multiple emails I send throughout the day. They set up and broke down the display for food, provided utensils, napkins, plates and the food was just great! We got the following food items;

Sides:
Potato hash (cheesy potato casserole)
Bacon and sausage 

Entrees:
Biscuits and gravy (separate)
Breakfast burrito (halves)
French Toast
Spinach Scramble (bacon or sausage)

We also got a champagne flavored cake with raspberry mousse filling decorated to celebrate an aware our site recently won.

We are currently in the process of booking them to cater a luncheon this Saturday which all food items sound delish;

Watermelon feta salad with a porcini balsamic glaze
Apple Slaw- honey, brown sugar, apple cole slaw
BLT triangles- on texas toast
Chicken Salad croissant sandwich (contains cranberries and almonds) 
Southwest wrap- spinach tortilla, southwest chicken, cheddar cheese, avocado, tomatoes, cilantro cream sauce. 
 
Desserts:
Cannolis
Brownie bites
Mini cupcakes

We will continue to use Mad Batter for different events we have throughout the year! I haven't eaten or been to their actual location, that is on the to-do list."}
{"text":"First time visiting and I can't believe the selection and quantity. I ordered the sliders (beef) so good. Serving size is perfect and I will definitely be back! We also ordered a peanut butter cookie. I'm a sicker for peanut butter, but they are peanut butter sandwich cookies! OMG with a coffee! Perfection."}
{"text":"This little bakery had a great vibe to it and the girls behind the counter were warm and welcoming. They have local Manbakes products including muffins, cookie butter and protein bars. We ordered the biscuits and gravy, a strawberry Danish, coffee, tea and a sugar cookie. The coffee and tea were at a help yourself station which I thought was unique and enjoyed. They have lots of different sugary treats to choose from behind the counter and everything we tried was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"We visited Mad Batter for brunch and were very impressed with the service, ambiance and food.  I loved the huge mugs of coffee and the Nutella crepes are just super delicious!
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.   Candied jalapeños are amazing.   I have never had something I didn't like, and the pastries look good too."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place out but when we walked in, nobody acknowledged us, we waited about 10 mins for someone to clean a table for us, we sat down at a wet table, waited another 10 minutes for the waitress to tell us the coffee would take a while because it had to be brewed, and when we finally placed our orders they were out of the gravy that both are dishes came with. We left. It started with no acknowledgement. If the staff had greeted us, we may have considered ordering something else, but they just didn't seem to care about us as patrons. Sad."}
{"text":"This is a small breakfast cafe with a small, but tasty menu. I have one or two things I order there that I consistently enjoy. The portions are a little on the small side, especially compared to other chain type breakfast places, but I've by no means left starving. I've had one of the specialty coffees (the Mocha I think) and it was really good. The service has been good every time I've been there."}
{"text":"First off let me say that the cannoli's are amazing! Next I ordered classic French toast for my family and they loved it!! Finally for myself I ordered the stack attack and it was great, I would definitely recommend it!!!!!"}
{"text":"The hidden gem go to spot. Service & food was great, no disappointments. Check it out , you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"Food and ambiance both great. Ambience is the real selling point though for me, most of the area has good food in terrible environments."}
{"text":"Breakfast here with my husband without kids!  We started playing dominoes, but didn't get to finish before our food arrived. We ordered biscuits gravy & bacon quiche.  Both were delicious with good sized portions without feeling too full. I marked down for a small menu selection, but mostly for the smokey air inside, perhaps from the grill? Maybe a little spendy, but not too bad & service was very friendly."}
{"text":"I finally stopped in here for some sweet treats after driving by several times.  I really wanted to love this place, but I was disappointed.  The upside here is that the cafe is cute, the presentation of the baked goods is great, and the service was quick and friendly.  I bought a red velvet cupcake, an oreo cupcake, a yellow fudge cupcake and a s'mores brownie. I came in around noon so it's not as though the treats had sat there all day, but they tasted like they had. The red velvet was a little dry and the cream cheese frosting was a little bland and crusty, as though it had been in the case for a few days. The other cakes were moist and the fudge frosting was very good, but the chocolate cake just tasted \"off.\" I don't want to be overly critical here, but the brownie wasn't even worth mentioning.  They burnt the marshmallow topping on it for the s'mores effect, which looked good but did not translate into a good experience in our mouths.  Because they are so close to home and reasonably priced, I will give them the benefit of the doubt and likely try them again."}
{"text":"The House breakfast skillet is superb!  The waitstaff are outstanding young members of the local community. I came in for breakfast and wifi to get some work done on a Saturday morning. They were not annoyed by me staying for two hours. I tipped accordingly and they kept my coffee full. Good times at MadBatter!"}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place forever, I've heard such good things and the positive yelp reviews are always give me an extra push to try somewhere new.. it's Memorial Day, I understand it's a holiday, we came in an hour before closing, ONE HOUR, I work in restaurants, I would not have come in if it was any less, I understand how it goes. 

Big turn off- no decaf coffee, seriously? McDonald's has decaf.. they offer specialty coffees but nothing decaf? I know the world survives on caffeine but not even just regular decaf coffee. My mom can't have caffeine, so this is extremely disappointing.. maybe the people working didn't want to brew any? Idk

The gentleman working/serving tables wasn't exactly the epitome of friendly.. he was ready to go, as I heard him say \"were closed\" when the phone rang. 

Our food was delicious, however on the menu my spicy croissant was suppose to have sautéed onions and jalapeños, it came with raw jalapeños.. no biggie I love them regardless but it's the principle of the thing.. stick to what the menu says.. and when someone asks for well done bacon, it should be well done.. my mom had the sausage gravy and biscuits, it was very tasty and also had bacon in it.. 

Three stars because the food saved it.."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I'm almost afraid to leave a review because i don't want it to get too busy, lol. The staff is wonderful and the food is amazing. The Nutella banana crepes are the best ever! Definitely try this place, but don't take my table."}
{"text":"The food is really tasty. Gave the 5 stars because the food and waitstaff is out of this world. However, a minor complaint was presentation. I got a breakfast burritos and that was all that was on the plate. A slice of orange or a little color would have been nice. Other than that, I'm totally satisfied with the food and the choices I made."}
{"text":"I got married a couple weeks ago and she made my cake. It was affordable, beautiful and absolutely delicious! Way better than Freed's, they were over priced and their cake was dry and lacked flavor. Thank you so much for something so wonderful that my husband and I will remember always. Looking forward to the next birthday so we can order another cake from them!"}
{"text":"This place is a well kept secret. It's tucked away in a small shopping center off of Horizon & Horizon. They seem to specialize in jams, but have numerous options. My wife and I really enjoy their breakfast sandwiches and tacos. I also strongly recommend their cruffin."}
{"text":"I am so sad to give this business such a low rating, but after several tries, it is warranted for my experiences.  I had very high hopes and wanted to love the Mad Batter because we are lacking breakfast places in this area.  Plus, I liked the how they transformed this Subway into a nice little cafe with tables and counter space.

My first visit was on opening weekend and I only got pastries to go because their lunch menu was not quite ready yet.  Since they were so new, I could understand.  But I was surprised by the attitude of the owner.  She was not very friendly or willing to explain some of the items in the case (only some items had signs to tell you what they were).  I wound up with a tomato bread that I was told was raspberry by another clerk.

On my second visit, I also only got to go pastries because we came in for lunch and they were out of the sliders we wanted to try.  Owner once again rude and definitely not apologetic.

On my final visit, I got breakfast to go.  It didn't travel well so I didn't take pictures.  Now I wish I had because the food was terrible!  I ordered a breakfast sandwich that was extremely greasy and bland.  However, the side of hashbrowns with cheese were really good.  The BF got french toast with caramelized bananas and a side of biscuits & gravy.  He said the bananas were good, but that the french toast bread tasted more like cake and the consistency was weird for FT.  Not something he'd order again.  Unfortunately, his description of the biscuits & gravy was really bad and I don't want to repeat it, suffice it to say he spit it out and threw it away.  To be fair, the owner did mention that this was not her favorite batch of b&g.

After three unfavorable visits, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went with my family since we had a Groupon. Upon arriving we waited until someone finally acknowledged us and said we could sit anywhere. We arrived in time for their lunch menu, which included lots of sandwiches. We ordered the philly au jus, the pesto chicken, and a couple other things. A while later our food arrives. The server neglected to tell us beforehand they had run out of au jus sauce for the philly (literally the only reason we had ordered it). The pesto chicken sandwich was just okay, I wish they had used something other than regular sliced bread so it could actually hold in the chicken. Philly was super standard, not sure why they would charge $11 for it. For sides we got brussel sprout salad, was also just okay, and bread pudding (weird side choice) which was decent, wish it had been warmed up or a little more moist. Service was alright, not bad but not great. I wish he had tried some of the baked goods, but after being so disappointed with the food we decided not to.

Food: meh
Service: meh

Also, the people making our food weren't wearing hair nets, how fun!"}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing...service is good, and they have a country version of eggs Benedict with gravy instead of cheese sauce on a house made buscuit with cheesy potatoes and an over easy egg stacked on bacon or sausage...the gravy makes the whole dish.....excellent!!!"}
{"text":"We've been here many times. However today was awful. Our favorite thing here has been the biscuits and gravy with potato hash. 

The biscuits and gravy were 1) runny, 2) the meat tasted weird and it was cold. Ugh!

The potato hash was cold.

And the best part....the staff could have cared less."}
{"text":"Throwing a birthday party so was looking for a bakery to order cake from. Found this place on Yelp which seemed to have good reviews. Walked into store and their bakery display was sad at best. Only had cupcakes, no cake slices. They don't do cake tasting for party of 50 or less so that wasn't an option. There was no information on what flavor of cupcakes, fillings and frostings were on the cupcakes. This place is NOWHERE NEAR being a \"bakery\". It's more a cafe that serves baked goods."}
{"text":"Love this little mom and pop shop! Great service, scrumptious breakfast/brunch bites, topped with delightfully sweet desserts and treats. During peak breakfast/lunch time there can be a longer wait. But, delivery through Uber or GrubHub make it stress free! I highly recommend their Tiramisu coffee if you're hankering for a new flavor infatuation."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food is great, people are nice and it's just a sweet little place. They cater, have some amazing desserts, and the coffee is great. Go check it out for yourself, tell Brittney hello... You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here and both ordered the breakfast sandwich. I wasn't sure what to expect as behind the counter was a small griddle and toaster. However, I ended up having the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had. I don't know what they do to their hash browns but YES, YES, YES. I had to use a fork and knife to eat my sandwich and I could barely finish it. Portion size was good. The inside is small with not that much seating and they have a couple tables outside. If you're looking for a home cooked, good quality, lots of love put into your meal, you must come here. I look forward to trying the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent local joint!!
Love the menu options, 
But the potato hash is the hit!!
Small but really great selection from
Breakfast to coffees to desserts.
The place has Mom and Pops quality with a modern design. 
Located down the street from
Downtown old Henderson and CCSN Henderson campus. Great stop if your on the way to Boulder City, or close to old Henderson.
It is gem not to missed, even if slightly close to this spot, well worth the drive ...
you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Heard about this from here and I must say what a let down the food was so expensive and not that good I ordered three egg all day breakfast and the eggs were supposed to be scrambled and looked like they were and over easy mistake made in to scrambled and so over cooked it was like eating rubber and bitter egg yolks. When we first went in we were asked if we wanted breakfast or lunch then told they were on lunch, what they can't just say that?
My wife ordered the philly cheese steak. which tasted like crap. And the fruit was so bitter my 3 year old would not eat it.
The Bakery looked good and we tried a cupcake which was not very good again my daughter who has never turned her nose up any sweet stuff would not eat it. I tried it later and the cream tasted spoiled so no wounder she would not touch it. we ended up throwing it away.
We also tried two the small things I forget what they called them but while they were good at 5.00 for two small pastries about the size of a small cookie was ridiculous.  After a 38.00 dollar bill and 5 dollar tip I will never go back this crap hole again.
Best suggestion would be to go somewhere else this place is way to expensive for bad food."}
{"text":"Never coming back here! If I could give a 0 star I would! The waitress were VERY rude! They wanted my son to sit on the bar area where he obviously could not reach! When I asked if we could pull one chair to a table one of the waitresses flat out said no with attitude! And when we walked out they said \"OMG their leaving\" while laughing! Talk about customer service! I will definitely share my experience here with family/friends.No good food will compensate for VERY BAD SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Cute little cozy place , right off the bike trail. Great service and the food was full of flavor . Coffee needs too be a little stronger but overall I found my new breakfast place."}
{"text":"I just ate THE best Philly of my life!  

Just started working in the area so I decided to try out some of the eateries around. I'm glad I did. 

I was greeted as soon as I entered the quaint restaurant.  When I said it was my first time there, she explained to me about the fresh bakery items as well as the full breakfast and lunch menus. 

It's a simple menu with some classic as well as creative items. I chose the caprese sandwich with watermelon feta salad. A few minutes later I was told they were out of basil so I chose a classic Philly.  It took awhile to get he good but it was worth it!  The bread was soft, the meat tender and the cheese gooey. They add mushrooms, onions and banana peppers. Pure heaven!

I took 1/2 dozen cookies with me and YUMMY! Try the Oreo cookies!  

The only negative was the size of the glasses. It's a cute mason jar but it's small and I wasn't offered a refill. So not sure if they are free or not. 

The ambiance was great with mellow music playing. A bit hazy though because of the grill."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!!!! I had 2 French macaroons extreamly unique and scrumcious !!! I would highly recommend the MAd Batter. The staff was extreamly welcoming and very attentive! I will be returning soon for their delicious looking Lunch!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The food is always good from the cafe side and the bakery is so additive! The atmosphere here is great, a place really scores high when they are playing Led Zeppelin in the morning! The grill station is right behind the counter so you can watch them make your food, it's that fresh! I am always a fan of local small businesses so I will be coming here to support this place for as long as I live here in Henderson."}
{"text":"If it were just a bakery I would only give The Mad Hatter 2 stars, but I have had enjoyable experiences on the cafe side of the business, so 3 stars it is. A lack of consistency is what prevents me from rating any higher. 

Weekday hours make it impossible for me to dine at The Mad Batter during the week, so all of my experiences have been on weekends. Sundays breakfast is served all day (but they close at 2 pm), and until 11 am on Saturdays. 

My biggest gripe with Mad Batter is that service can be spotty. The owner is usually quite friendly but some of the younger employees are not what I would consider amicable. Orders are usually taken fairly quickly, but after the food comes out there have been multiple occasions that I have had to flag my server down for refills. It's a very small space, making that pretty unacceptable. The closer it is to closing time, the less friendly service seems to be as well. Also, the ambiance in this cafe leaves a bit to be desired. It's a small spot, with no real separation between the \"kitchen\" and dining area so it can sometimes smell smokey. 

In terms of food, I have had some delicious items from The Mad Batter but I have also had some real disappointments.. The Billy Goat from the brunch menu is excellent, I should order it every visit. On my last experience at The Mad Batter I had the biscuits and gravy, which came out extremely fast but the biscuits were underdone in the middle and inedible. 
The coffee drinks here are just that: cold but reheated coffee with flavors added. No espresso machine here. 

I have yet to have ANYTHING from the bakery case at The Mad Batter that I'd repurchase. Perhaps it is because my visits are typically on the weekends toward the end of the day that the case usually appears to need to be restocked and I find some of their prices to be a higher than they should be for a little bakery in Henderson. 

Overall, The Mad Batter is ok but not all that, with a lot of potential to be great if the owners put more emphasis on service. (Also the 3% to use a credit card? Pretty sure that's not allowed by credit card companies AND, it's a real turn off)"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, must try the Billy Goat! The service was excellent. I would return in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Outstanding little tucked away gem! I'm conflicted as I write this because I don't want this secret to get out.... it's hard to get a seat in this place on weekends!  However, the food lover in me must proclaim this place from the mountain tops!  My third visit here and the consistency of the food, atmosphere, and friendly small town service never disappoints.  I've had the croissant breakfast sandwich, and today the breakfast burrito. Both very good, and absolutely fresh, fresh, fresh.  Their house potatoes are so yummy.....cheesy hash browns.  There is nothing bad about this place, except that it's popularity means it's not a secret anymore!"}
{"text":"The worst customer service...  

Ba-dum-tssss!!! 

 ...Found a hair in my food, cashier decided to disappear in the backroom of restaurant instead of offering a refund. What the heck on earth they'd think Im gonna pay for something that I didn't eat... Smh ? The credit card machine was super greasy and dirty, I had to rush myself to the bathroom to wash my hands after touching it. I tried to let that guy know about it, he didn't even take it into account. Lol. 
Well, that was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"We ran across this breakfast and bakery place by accident while celebrating our 30th year Anniversary and BOY!! What a find.  We ate there everyday and every meal was amazing.  

When in the area again, we will definitely go back.

Love this place and the service was Outstanding as well.

Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great atmosphere. I highly recommend this place. Family owned and operated. Today was my first of many visits."}
{"text":"This place is really cute and comforting. They are located in old Henderson. The lady who took my order (forgot her name) was very helpful & nice. I ordered  cookies and cream iced coffee and the croissant sandwich. The sauce they put on the sandwich had a kick to it, which was so good. And the cheesy hash browns were to die for. All freshly made :) definitely will be my new go to for breakfast and definitely will try other foods."}
{"text":"This place was unorganized, the food wasn't good and the service was horrible. I don't know if I caught them on a bad day but i won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband got a variety of things for Mother's Day.  We've wanted to try this place for awhile.  Love to see small businesses be successful.  My husband said the place is nice and pretty small.  Of course it was crowded being Mother's Day.  As for the food - the macaroons were pretty and had great texture.  The taste was good but too sweet and no substance.  Seems like they should taste like something.  I got nothing but sugar.  I did really like the maple bacon scone.  It tasted like pancakes and bacon.  Texture was good and soft.  The Rosemary scone was dry and if you really like Rosemary - you'll get lots of that flavor.  Probably wouldn't order that again.  We also got the croissants which were very average.  Not as good as I would have expected - on the dry side and not really a buttery flavor.  And my husband got a couple cannoli - he said they were okay - not impressive.  I will try to go to this place and eat there - not leave it up to my husband to pick things out.  Hopefully it was just a bad day to critique them and the best is yet to come... I love the name and it looks like a lot went into getting this place going.  It's got to be better!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, just missed the breakfast menu. Wasn't really in the mood for breakfast or I would have asked if they could have. I ordered the Open Face Pastrami with a side of Apple Coleslaw. The pastrami was  not tough which is refreshing! Between the mix of thousand island and melted Parmesan it flowed really well. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"We finally made it out to try Mad Batter and it did not disappoint! We ordered the stack attack and the Nutella banana pancakes. Both were amazing! We loved all the flavors of the stack attack! The runny yolk of the egg mixed with the gravy and bacon over the biscuit...yum! The pancakes were SO good! They seem more dense than other pancakes which I loved. The caramlized bananas added the perfect amount of sweetness and you can never go wrong with Nutella! The service was fast and friendly. I've thought about the food all day today and can't wait to go back! I'll probably dream about it the food tonight!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious! been in Vegas for a week, and this place we ran into randomly on our way back to texs was the best place we eaten! Try the croissant sandwich,  and always get the hash as a side with whatever you eat. I don't like hash, but this is a cheesy hash that isn't dry .. so good.  My only complaint is that I have to come all the way to Vegas to eat this good!"}
{"text":"I'm on a mission for the best vanilla latte. My mission brought me here. I didn't even know this placed was nooked back here, walking in its a very adorable little place, not busy with very polite employees. The latte was very sweet, we asked for a cup of coffee to make it more tolerable, the caprese sandwich I ordered was good, my husband ordered a BLT with avocado but the avocado was forgotten, there's also a 3% charge for using a debit card. It wasn't bad overall but I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst breakfasts ever. I ordered scrambled eggs and got an over cooked, dry egg omelet with potatoes with some type of cheese. It was a very disappointing meal.
Go to Denny's if you want a better mediocre breakfast."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. The name is genius, and the rave reviews had us intrigued. Especially about the potato hash. That sounded great. 

We came in just before 10am on Sunday. It was a small space, but there was an open table right by the door. We were greeted by a very pleasant woman who gave us a menu. 

As I was trying to look at the menu I was overwhelmed by the smell of cooking grease. It was so bad. We were looking for a somewhat of a healthy breakfast, only to be smelling this grease in the air. At one point I looked out the window to see McD's, and asked if my husband was okay going over there instead. He thought I was joking. I was half joking. 

He decided to get up and check out their sweets case with some scones. He came back very disappointed. He said they were these massive scones that looked like they were covered in glaze. I was starting to worry that my clothes and my hair would smell like burnt cooking oil  all day, so we left. 

What a letdown. And it took a few minutes outside in the breeze for the smell to leave my hair. After being in there less than 5 minutes. Oh well."}
{"text":"Love this place! So cute and the food is a GREAT!!! I feel like it's a cafe you'd find by the beach locally owned it has culture ! Our new favorite spot!!"}
{"text":"I had the breakfast sandwich,  I did biscuit instead of a croissant. It was so yummy. I would come here again in a heart beat."}
{"text":"I stopped in after having passed it so many times and eating in the local area but never stopping in before. It's a cozy establishment, for very small groups which I do like. Starbucks is too busy for my liking and this place fit my fancies for traffic. I snuck in and sat down and not more than a min after I sat the server was at my table. (Didn't get her name, but she was very nice)  

Having looked at the menu I immediately found several options that sounded really appealing and had a hard time deciding. When I did decide it was a new menu item Pulled pork beer cheese Mac and a side of pumpkin bread. It was damn good, I enjoyed every bit of it. 

The only knock if I can even say that is the portion size of the Mac and cheese. I have a pretty big appetite, and it felt like it was finishing right as it was getting good. I'd still go back in for more, though I'd need to order a double order to feel satisfied. Overall good attentive service, good tasting food, and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This little restaurant was AMAZING! The potato hash is a must have. The biscuits and gravy have a bacon and sausage gravy that is to die for! The stack attack was massive, must have a big appetite for that dish. The service was spot on, our server was very nice and the other employees were not shy to joke with us as well. All around a 5 star cafe"}
{"text":"After early morning breakfast and brunches, I have come to the conclusion that they get 4 stars. 1 star is solely for their crack potato hash. Really, I could bathe in that stuff.

Pros: the food is phenomenal. From dishes to pastries, I always walk out happily full and ready to take a nap. Spinach scramble (add avocado) (choose sausage), side of potato hash and a side of bananas is my go-to. The double stack is also very good but I am not the biggest fan of runny eggs. The triple berry crepes as well as their Nutella banana crepes are out of this world. The bacon quiche is for people who are looking for portion control. I would hold off on their coffees though, I've only had their coconut speciality coffee and though it was big, it was gross. Watery and hazelnut-like. PASTRIES! Wow delicious. 2 for 1 cookies on Tuesdays ( pick Oreo and snicker doodle). And now they donate half the profit on kids with club feet. Love that, I'll have to go pick up some more often. 

Cons: they change the prices for things and forget toppings. Are the banana slices $1 or $2.50? Same goes for the pear slices? I've been charged different amounts each time. They also forgot my avocado the first time I ordered the scramble. I was so hungry I didn't even notice until this time, to which they then forgot the sour cream, which I did get the first time. Portions change constantly. $8 for a slice of bacon quiche? Ridiculous. Service is very slow. Staff is young I guess? I work in food too and I don't work like that so I don't find it as an excuse. Half the time I've been there I have had to go get menus, drinks, Etc. 

The food is so good, not even spotty service can stop me from coming to this hidden gem. Also you get 10% off every visit! Score!"}
{"text":"Yuck!!! So excited to try this place out.  Do not bother!! Food is old- what doesn't get served that day is left for another day.  Servers act like they are doing you ( the customer) a huge favor by waiting on you.  Do not waste your time and money.  Sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and coffee. The breakfast burrito is good and the mocha coffee."}
{"text":"This review is for the bakery portion only. It appears from reading other reviews that maybe the café is the better part of this spot. I've had this spot bookmarked for awhile and looked forward to stopping in. Everything in the case looked awesome and I really wanted to like this bakery.

I'll start with the good. The staff working when I stopped in were very friendly and the bakery offers a 10% off with Yelp check-in offer which is nice. The Maple Bacon scone I bought for my husband was really good. It had the perfect blend of the sweet maple and smoky bacon. My Almond Cakepop was tasty and had a nice amount of the almond flavor. The chocolate on the outside had a nice flavor as well. 

The rest of the items I purchased were disappointing to the point that I only took one bite before determining that I could not eat more. I literally can't think of another time this happened to me with a baked good. My husband asked three times if I was serious because he thought I was playing a joke when I told him there was a baked good I couldn't eat. The Cotton Candy Macaron and Orange Mimosa Macaron were completely stale and had almost no flavor. The Confetti Cupcake fell completely apart when I was removing it from the wrapper. It was sopping wet with oil and tasted like oil. Same oil situation with the mini Red Velvet and Oreo cupcakes. The prices on everything seemed a little high which I don't mind for quality baked goods, but most of this was inedible. 

I feel bad even writing a review like this, but I don't want anyone else to waste their money on the baked goods here. I might return and try the café since the reviews on the café seem to be the reason for their overall four star rating."}
{"text":"This is a rad little cafe. The decor is unique and well done.  The menu is tasty and a good price.  It's not a big place so no big groups but perfect for a breakfast date."}
{"text":"The food was yummy and everyone who came to help us at our table was really sweet. I would recommend it for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Super cute local cafe. My children had some cookies which were very yummy sugar and Oreo. I had a breakfast sandwich with egg whites , bacon, Swiss, and a spicy sauce. The spicy sauce was great. The only thing I would change is the type of Swiss to be a more deli type of Swiss but it was still good. The croissant was perfect. 

The owner is super sweet, grew up in Henderson. The look of the café is perfect!

We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Groupon or I would never know this place existed.  Its tucked in at the end of a tiny strip mall in a McDonalds parking lot.  The menu had a variety of sandwiches, wraps and breakfast dishes.  I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy that was made with both bacon and sausage, and a side order of the cheese potatoe hash.  So good I wanted to lick the plate.  Washed it all down with a very good cup of coffee. My friend enjoyed her bacon and eggs, saying the bacon was amazing.  However, the potatoe hash is made casserole style with cheese already mixed in. I thought it was tasty but my friend doesnt care for cheese and left it on the plate. 

Our server was also the owner, Brittany, who gave excellent customer service with a great smile.The pastry case shelves were stocked with a delicious looking assortment of scones, cupcakes and cookies (I took a blueberry scone home to have later).  

I'm always looking for a bargain, hence trying out new places with a Groupon, and although this cafe was slightly more than I like to pay, I will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to Mad Batter, and the staff was very friendly! The place is very cute and clean, I love the decor.  I got the southwestern breakfast tacos with the cheesy hash browns, and WOW it was so tasty! Very fresh and filling while still not being too heavy for breakfast.  I'm a sucker for nutella too, and got the iced nutella mocha, which was perfect! Not too sweet, but you could DEFINITELY taste the nutella flavor. I live just down the street and I have no clue how I've never tried this place before, but I am absolutely going to be back."}
{"text":"I recently received a Groupon invite and it reminded me of the disappointing experience I had with their cakes.
I ordered a graduation cake from them based on their Instagram photos, which looked great.
I even did a tasting meeting with the owner who took down my info and assured me they would do a good job and even deliver it for a small fee.

The day of the graduation party, the same lady/owner/cake designer delivered the cake.
I asked for orange and blue (my daughter's school colors) and what we got was a muddled mess with sloppy  fondant work that looked like an amateur did it. Whoever made the Instagram cakes did NOT make our cake. It was so embarrassing to have to display this ugly cake. 

I contacted the owner afterwards and expressed my dissatisfaction and she offered to send me a gift certificate for a meal to make up for it. I never received it.

I would hate for any one else to trust this place to do an important event cake and be disappointed after it's too late. Next time, we'll stick to the more reputable bakeries in town.

In response to Brittany: 
I appreciate you reaching out. I'm sorry if my criticism is harsh but can you honestly say you are fully happy with how the cake turned out? The colors were supposed to be orange and blue and what was produced was a mottled mix of orange cream and baby blue...and what was that dirty splotch on it? I did expect more of what I saw on your IG, I thought you understood my \"vision\". From an artistic perspective, it looked like the cake was thrown together the last minute. Thank you for your offer to re-send the gift certificate but it's not necessary."}
{"text":"Cute little café, nice and clean . There's little parking outside due to the parking being shared with other shops. The inside is neatly decorated and has a nice atmosphere. The noise level is pretty low so studying is ideal. Their food is pretty good , a tad on the expensive side but its a plus that you can watch them cook your food. They only have a small grill so I would assume as it got busier that a wait would add up to get food . The staff is pretty nice as well."}
{"text":"This place is adorable!  The lunch black and blue wrap as well as the bbq chicken sandwich were delish!  The owner is a sweetie and waited on us herself.  The rest of her staff were competent and friendly.  We all should really want to see local businesses such as this one succeed!  So, if you haven't tried this darling little café with great food, you gotta go!!  Promote small businesses in our wonderful community of Henderson!"}
{"text":"I mean first of this place needs a better sign good location but if my gf hadn't have been there before I would have missed it completely. Here's the thing though if I can get food that tastes the same at bk like my breakfast sandwich I'm not willing to pay a ridiculous price for it. The service wasnt very good but I kinda chalk that up to them being new so I'm not going to harp on that but our meal did take forever to show up and we were informed that it was \"worth waiting for perfection\". ....... well hun you came up real short on that wasn't worth the time at all. Then we were given some sliced carrot cake or heck I don't know cause there was just no flavor in it at all and to top it off when we asked about the yelp check in discount the owner joked we could only get it if we posted a good review. Well guess what good reviews come from good food good service and leaving an establishment feeling satisfied we had none of that so I'm going to post an honest review that's what this is all about after all. I'll be keeping my morning meals at the sunrise cafe this place just isn't worth another visit."}
{"text":"Walked in with a friend and was very impressed that such a new business was so established with solid items on the menu. Coffee was great, our sandwiches were solid, and the dessert was to die for. The oreo cookies could be the life of me. A nice little hidden gem in Henderson"}
{"text":"Great little place for Henderson! Not your normal dive cafe!   Very modern, very friendly staff, small menu but done well! A piece of Summerlin in the heart of Hendertucky! Nice to see!"}
{"text":"I feel bad leaving 2 stars because the service was good but there were too many things wrong here for anything higher!

The good: the hash brown casserole is DELICIOUS. Just feed me that for breakfast and I'm good. Very tasty!

The not so good: when you walk in the cafe you're going to want to walk right back out. It is very smoky and greasy from the griddle. I don't know if they just don't have an exhaust fan or what but my eyes were burning and we scarfed our food as quickly as possible, then ran out for a breath of fresh air. We stunk like grease for hours afterwards and were there maybe a half an hour.

The \"iced mocha\" was stale coffee (not espresso) with tonnnnns of milk and tonnnns of vanilla. Mochas aren't supposed to have vanilla. Only good thing was they do make their own whip cream, though I tasted a lot more flavoring in it than necessary.

Clearly they are big on extracts and syrups because their pancakes aren't just \"made with almond extract\" they are LITERALLY ALMOND EXTRACT FILLED PANCAKES. I took one bite and that was it. I couldn't do it.

The French toast was not made fresh! It was clearly reheated which is disgusting. It does not take long to dip bread in an egg wash and cook it especially since they do make the pancakes fresh. Reheated French toast is chewy and just not tasty at all. 

Last but not least a slice of cheesecake that had been in the bakery case for at least a few days was $6.50. I know it had sat there for a while because I used to work at a bakery. :/ I understand small businesses are expensive to run but taking short cuts and selling reheated or old food is not the way to go. Only reason I gave 2 stars is because I liked the staff."}
{"text":"A friend recommended I try this place and I always saw it on Yelp so I can by. 

I ordered a caramel iced coffee and a side of the hash brown casserole for $4.75. It was SO GOOD IM COMING BACK TOMORROW! Wow. Ok. But really the hash browns were super yummy and filling but I still wanted more. The iced coffee was alright but seeing as I hate coffee and never drink it, I would say that's pretty good! Food and prices are totally fair here.

The vibe and setup in here is super chill, kind of kitschy cute but I dig it. Subtle Alice in wonderland theme. 

The staff were nice too, super helpful in picking stuff out and making suggestions. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Philly cheesesteak and B's Burger to go.  Both were very tasty and we enjoyed them thoroughly.  We'll definitely be back to try some of their breakfast items that get such good reviews."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed in this place, I wanted to like it but I just can't bring myself to it. The service is aweful, everyone seems to be in a rush and acts like you are a bother to them. While waiting for our food we could hear every conversation between the employees and let me just say they were not very courteous when discussing their opinions about customers and their own coworkers. We could not believe the things that were coming out of their mouths. Not only was our food more expensive than what it was worth but we got a very unwelcomed show by the employees and one of which we believe was even the owner. That is definitely not how you run a business. Anyways our food looked good but when we tasted it it had tasted like it had been sitting out for a while and if were to be expected to pay the amount that they are asking for I would expect great service and great food, but we received neither. We decided to opt out of any bakery items although they looked good, we didn't feel like staying in this place any longer. Besides our food looked good but was disgusting so that was a possibility with the baked goods to. 

Unfortunately we did not enjoy this place and we will not return as well as we will not be  recommending this place to anyone. No one should walk in to a place and hear shit being talked about either themselves or employees and not be charged an arm and a leg for something my 5 year old daughter can make better than these so called chefs."}
{"text":"This has to be the best mom & pop breakfast spot in town. It's small and cozy inside, the staff is absolutely lovely and the food was FANTASTIC. I'm from the south and I'm very picky about my biscuits and gravy, but I tried their Stack Attack and it was perfect! All the breakfast perfect stacked into one amazing mound of awesomeness covered in gravy. My husband had the Nutella Banana Pancakes and was in heaven. Their chef Ken was the best, he made some bacon jam to go on the side free of charge and was so friendly. We will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try a new breakfast joint to support local business, but unfortunately it was a bit of a disappointment. 

To start off with the positive - the environment was adorable, the staff was friendly, and the cafe food was edible for the most part. 

My wife and I ordered coffee with soy milk but the soy milk was expired that was given (clumping up/smelled sour). When we told the staff (although friendly), she didn't say sorry or offer to take the coffee off the bill. Another employee was drinking soda in front of customers which I find to be poor customer service. Cottage cheese that was given was also expired. After this, the thought of what could be expired in our food made us a little uneasy but it still tasted fine. I started to view my surroundings as I was sitting at the bar and noticed a caramel bottle on the table that had an expiration date of 11/11/16... Lastly, the area is small and poorly ventilated. The atmosphere was \"smoky\" and hurt the eyes a bit... We left smelling like smokey food. 

My suggestions for the owners is to ensure every night that employees are checking the dates of all products, and to somehow provide better ventilation in the area. Unfortunately, we will not be going back to this cafe... which is unfortunate because we try our best to support small businesses."}
{"text":"This place is cute and the food is amazing. The staff there are wonderful and very friendly. I waited at least a year before coming here and I don't know why I waited so long! So good."}
{"text":"This is a great little bakery. I cannot wait to go back and try more of the menu. Even the coffee was memorable!
My husband had the pancakes with the cinnamon roll upgrade. They were light and fluffy. More cinnamon (I'm a huge fan) and maybe candied nuts would have made them the best ever!
I ordered the fresh berry crepes. The crepes were perfectly cooked. The vestries were fresh and sweet. This was a perfect and fresh breakfast. 
I took a walk past the pie case and there were so many beautiful creations. The scones looked beyond delicious. They even have a pumpkin spice one right now!"}
{"text":"This has got to be my favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas. If you eat here the apple pie french toast is a must try so much flavor. I really enjoy going here vs the traditional breakfast spots and they're reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Henderson needs more little eateries like this one!! The food is spot on, filling and a good bang for your buck!! Service is great everyone was friendly, fast, and very helpful! We will be coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I hesitate to write this review because I wanted to love this place. I try to support small businesses and give positive feedback whenever I'm happy with the service. I'm much less likely to post a negative review unless I'm really unhappy and want to spare someone the same experience. But here it goes. Food was just ok. Service was REALLY slow.  Our waitress at least tried to redeem our experience but not enough to want to come back."}
{"text":"My bf and I went for brunch and sat inside by the window. Service was so so.. as well as the food. After we ate there we smelled like food for hours because how close we were to the grill being inside and the smoke circling the restaurant. We got dessert to go... And it tasted stale as if it's been in the display for awhile and we ended up throwing it away."}
{"text":"Our wedding cake was beautiful and tasted great! We are very happy the experience and the overall outcome of working with Brittney."}
{"text":"Healthy and fulfilling.  Had lunch here yesterday.  Came back today for breakfast.  Son is playing rugby and had quinoa and eggs for breakfast.  Charming and delicious!"}
{"text":"The decor of this place is so cool. It has an industrial kind of feel.

The food here is delicious. I had the skillet breakfast.The server was very kmowlegable and very sweet

The owner walks around and answers any questions you might have.

We also bought the cashew butter. Yum!

We love supporting local businesses and will return"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the food and 3 stars for the service. Our server was very nice but she was obviously overwhelmed. We waited about an hour to order and get our food which for a small cafe with only 3 tables with customers seems like a lot. 

I had the spinach quiche which was tasty. It had a fluffy egg center with cooked spinach mixed in. The crust was flaky like croissant dough. It could have been warmer. My husband got the avocado burrito which was flavorful and a good size but not something he would rush back for.

Overall we weren't wowed by the food. It wasn't bad but it wasn't something we'd rush back for."}
{"text":"This place is cool and a bit of a hidden gem and all, food is good, but the waiter was overly aggressive and just kinda rubbed me the wrong way. Seemed a bit too much \"up\" for such a low-key joint."}
{"text":"The inside is decorated so cute and cozy and the staff is so nice and welcoming. Haven't tried the food yet but it looked good and the coffee was yummy."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Awesome staff. The bacon jam....I could eat it with everything. It's so awesome!! Breakfast was great as was lunch. U have to go try it."}
{"text":"A group of us were returning from Hoover Dam and decided to stop for lunch in Henderson. Saw this was rated 4 stars, thought we might give it a try. Wow! Everything we had was amazing. The food was fresh, made by the owner herself and absolutely fabulous! We stocked up on baked goods as we left and were not disappointed with our choices. Please give them a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great quaint place with a good lunch menu. I came here for lunch around 1:00pm and ordered their chicken, bacon, avocado sandwich. It was so good! The bacon with thick and crispy and the chicken was made with balsamic vinegar. The sandwich was packed with flavor and ingredients. It was a bit messy to eat though and I wish it had been cut in half. The sandwich came with a side and there were plenty to choose from. I chose their watermelon feta salad but they were out of watermelon. They did substitute it with strawberries which I didn't mind.

My friend ordered a salad and a soup and she said that it was really good! She did wish there was the option of having half a salad and soup as a possible combo. Either way, we both agreed that we would come back for lunch again. 

Their pastry selection seemed nice. I personally did not ordered one but their cheesecake looked delicious.

I would definitely recommend this place! Their breakfast menu on the website looks like they offer great selections. I would like to go back to try those options too."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food...2 stars for the service...no fault of HER own.  Great little waitress at 10:05AM, 11/2/15, who was on the phone dealing with a to go order for 5 minutes from the moment we walked in the door.  This little, efficient, sweet people person should be able to focus on the customers, orders, meal deliveries and checking on those eating welfares.  Instead she has no bus boy who could take drink orders, bus tables, wash dishes and fill in on the phone as needed.  Makes the place seems a little greedy, some guy doesn't have a job, and this nice little gal is having to do the best she can, and shouldn't have to hustle this much as she already has enough hustle and enough to do specializing in just being the great waitress that she is.  MY OPINION...and I've been a waiter at a fine dining restaurant for the Sheraton chain when I went back to college in my late 20's."}
{"text":"Great find! Nice people and tasty food. Ordered strawberry french toast, banana Nutella crepe, quiche of the day, and Nutella banana pancakes and all were delicious. Located in the McDonald's parking lot."}
{"text":"I love a restaurant that doesn't own a freezer. This place is freshness at its finest! Not being a fan of mustard, my server suggested thousand island instead on my open face pastrami sandwich... Great call. Equally great was the homemade pumpkin bread pudding with freshly whipped cream!"}
{"text":"This place is the best breakfast in Henderson no doubt about it! I love the it's so Gouda breakfast sandwich and husband loved the jalapeño one! This is a cute little place too we loved going here  we could both eat a Greta breakfast for about $25 tip included! Check them out. They also make super cute cakes!"}
{"text":"I took my grandson here for breakfast. We shared a breakfast sandwich and banana. We both loved it. Then we had to try a cake pop! Red Velvet, yummy! The food was great, but I have to say the young man working was the nicest! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We just ordered a gluten free chocolate and Nutella cake and it was delicious!! Our guests didn't even know it was gluten free and that's exactly how it should be. Can't wait for them to make our wedding cake in October!"}
{"text":"Went here for Saturday brunch. Inside is cute but very smoky inside. When we left our eyes were burning and clothes were smoky. Upon ordering we asked if we could substitute simple items or add a biscuit on the side and those options were not available, even if we were willing to pay extra. A comment was made that if we sub or ask for things on the side the cook would be mad. I ordered the traditional breakfast and it was good but I did not know the \"potato hash\" had a ton of dairy in it which is a dietary restriction for me. There was no indication that it had dairy on the menu."}
{"text":"We ate here for breakfast this morning. YUM! I got the berry crepes. These were amazing, with a homemade caramel whip cream. Their biscuits are buttery and delicious with a house made jam that is nothing like I have ever had before. Hubby and I may go back for breakfast again tomorrow- yum yum :)"}
{"text":"Super cute hidden gem. Visiting my mom and without yelp would have not found this place. The cinnamon French toast was so delish!!!!! Loved this place and will definitely return when I visit again."}
{"text":"It's a very Happy Unbirthday to me!!!

I discovered this very little cute cafe with a novel theme and outstanding food. I've been there only a few times once for breakfast and lunch, both have been pleasant experiences.

I ordered the The Stack Attack, this behemoth is ridiculously good!!
It's two biscuits covered with eggs, hash browns and bacon smothered in sausage gravy. 
It doesn't happen to me very often, but I remember putting the fork down only a few times just to drink my juice. Basically, I was in LaLa land for the most part, no doubt the breakfast is stellar and the contrast of their style is so different than what I'm used to.

The second time around I came in for lunch, I had an amazing tomato, mozzarella sandwich and watermelon salad with feta cheese on the side. I was not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did, but if I had to go vegetarian for a day, I know where to go.

One day I have to go back to just to sample the desserts, whatever I did eat were just decadent teasers because they were all closers to my meal. The chocolate cupcake was an overall standout for me.

The staff is fabulous and I can tell they are genuinely nice people. Maybe it has to do with the small diner feel. During the slow time, I chatted with Lucas (cook) we talked for an hour just sharing experiences. I learned that he's a foodie just like me and has as this incredible thirst to be perfect his craft. You just never know who you might come across! 

The is an awesome cafe, make sure you add this bakery in your bookmark!"}
{"text":"There food is so good and unique. They're pastries are beautiful too. Definitely a perfect place to grab a quick bite or even spend hours to study."}
{"text":"Ok to be fair I would give this 2 1/2 stars if I could.
 Great service. Enthusiastic help=+
Then it sort of went downhill... = - The coffee had coffee grounds in it. Really?! A café that serves coffee with the grounds?!
 Sandwich was good, but small and the choice of sides less than inspiring. The soup was served cold, didn't even bother to ask for them to heat it up... Cream for coffee was not kept cold.
 The pastries were defrosted, had been frozen... one had very good frosting but the cake batter was very... I don't know... nothing special... Overall it was very expensive for what we got in my opinion. A bakery should never serve anything less than fresh for full price.. ever...if it is day old state it as such and lower the price... not to mention the prices in general...
I do hope they get the kinks out as Henderson NEEDS something that isn't fast food here. The people were nice, the décor is cute and creative. The food thing and actual service needs some tweaking."}
{"text":"We have been here three times. The food is great, but the service has gotten progressively worse each time. The last time we went may have been our last time ever. Before you continue reading this review, please keep in mind that we are normally VERY patient people and it takes something going VERY wrong for me to write a negative review.

First, we had to grab our own high chair for our toddler; no big deal, they were busy, so we did it ourselves. They took our drink orders right away and brought out our coffee shortly after; this is when most restaurants take your food order, but not here for some reason. There were also no spoons to stir our coffee, so we asked for those. Someone finally came out to take our food order after over 10 minutes, still no spoons for coffee, so we asked again. They finally brought us spoons, but, by that time, our coffee was cold.

Over 20 minutes after ordering, our food was finally brought out, but my wife's order was wrong. As you can imagine, we were starting to lose our patience at this point. I kindly told the waitress that the order was wrong and she brought back the correct order 10 minutes later. I asked her if that item was going to be on the house due to the fact that we had waited so long and she said yes. Then she came back and said it would only be 10% off. I asked to speak to the manager and she went to go get her only to come back and tell me that they'd take it off the bill. The manager didn't even come out and apologize, instead she sent this poor girl back and forth to relay her messages.

We finished eating our food and asked for the bill. I watched the waitress whom we asked for the bill pass our table several times refilling coffee and bringing out orders, but no bill after 10 minutes. Fed up, I just went up to the register and the bill they handed me still had the wrong order charged on it. I told the girl at the register that it was supposed to be taken off and she did; the least resistance we received during this visit.

It's a shame that this place doesn't have better service because the food is really tasty and they have toys for kids to play with. Due to our experience this last time, we may not go back."}
{"text":"Hello, welcome to 
The Mad Batter Café & Bakery. This has also been on our to do list so we ventured out and decided to give it a try. We knocked a few out in a short weekend. Made for some fun eating. Nestled in a small strip mall in a neighborhood in Henderson. As you enter its small and unassuming and the staff is real friendly. beverage orders were taken and delivered in a timely manner. I ordered the stack attack and Josie ordered the Croissant sandwich. She ordered the sauce on the side but it was delivered with sauce on the sandwich. We decided not to send it back and eat at normally served. The sauce had a small hint of heat but not so much as to be able to eat it. My Stack Attack had a home made biscuit, layer of potato hash, sausage (or Bacon). 2 eggs over easy, and smothered in gravy. This sounds good and it was. It was however (for Me) a lot at one time in a stack. Gravy was really good with lumps of sausage all through out, not grainy and abundantly served. Overall a great breakfast and very filling. Only thing again for me was the amount of onions in the hash and they were not cooked down very well. But that is a minor thing and an issue just for me. 
Thank you for dining at 
The Mad Batter Café & Bakery. Food good service was great. Give this little family shop a try if in area."}
{"text":"I think I have found my new favorite cafe.  Not only is it cute and charming the moment you walk in, the staff is amazing AND the food tastes fantastic.  From the little details you find throughout the place and the attention to detail into making each plate of food you can tell this place loves what they do.  Coffee is good, cupcakes are amazing and the California Crapes was to die for.  I will be coming back here over and over again."}
{"text":"I ordered my daughter's first birthday cake from this establishment. The order was taken accurately. The price was reasonable. And the cake was completed on time. The taste was incredibly bland. I gave the baker the option of which color to use on the color for the topping, which was honestly my mistake. Black writing on a white cake. Not a good choice. But, again, the price was reasonable for the cake itself. The aesthetics were incredible. The cake, less the taste and topper, was a sight to be seen, but there is room for improvement. That being said, go local. I'm happier with their service and product than I was with Freed's this time last year."}
{"text":"Wonderful local find! Service and atmosphere very personal and quaint. Food is excellent; the Mad Batter's skillet and French Toast are amazing. We'll definitely be returning often for future breakfasts and lunches."}
{"text":"The sandwich was delicious. Unfortunately for $8 I expected the whole sandwich rather than half of it.

I've had many great things here and I am sad to have to give a bad review but the past few times Ive eaten here have been a let down."}
{"text":"I love this place, food is awesome, bakery items to die for love their potato hash. Coffee is great, the owners are so friendly. Games on the table to keep little ones entertained before food arrives. My favorite weekend hang out!"}
{"text":"Disappointed, first time here and they set a Terrible first impression. Sorry to say they won't get a second chance, there are many other places that deserve the opportunity."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant. Egg sandwich was good. The two egg classic came with a biscuit that was amazing. No Decaf coffee here so don't expect it. The desserts looked good but did not partake."}
{"text":"Service isn't that great, they're actually pretty rude. The treats look so nice, but with everything so overpriced, I won't be returning. It kind of sucks because the decor is really cute and the name would imply it's cutsey with nice people. I guess not."}
{"text":"After a few disappointing experiences, we tried again, and sadly to say, it was the same old poor service. My water had something floating in it, the coffee was served without silverware and when asked for some silverware we were told to wait for it. Interestingly it never came. Additionally, all the sugar packets were moistened and dried leaving them crystallized. After 20 minutes where they couldn't get water and coffee served successfully we bounced. When we told our server to cancel our order, they just said \"oh ok.\" What a waste of a beautiful Sunday morning. I must be MAD for trying it again, Mad Batter I'd suggest hiring someone to run your front end service."}
{"text":"Quiet and cozy little sit in style bakery. They have an excellent breakfast menu. As for the bakery side they've got manbake products. For those men out there who are fitness buffs you know how crucial it is to have good fuel for your workouts.  I personally got to try some of their food and it was good, only problem I had was that I couldn't finish my meal. Good food, nice service, and great little mom and pop style bakery."}
{"text":"I wanted to take my daughter out for an easy lunch, just the two of us and this is close to home. I was hoping to find that breakfast was available a bit longer, but we had a great lunch. Quiet place, great service, but not a lot of seating. We will absolutely visit again for a meal or stop in for a sweet treat."}
{"text":"So it's cute and the dessert display looked amazing but the server wasn't very warm for a mom and pop kind of place. The menus were basic printer paper and pretty gross honestly. I think they could have printed way more to have a new one for every customer. Last but DEFINITELY not least. There was a cricket leg on my drink cup so we left. I couldn't believe it! I really hate being turned off by places like this. The reviews seemed great. I had high hopes :/"}
{"text":"What?!  Great service, fresh, interesting and delicious food and great coffee... all in one place? I am soooooo  glad that my wife and I kept driving to find a good breakfast place while visiting family in Henderson. The chef, (not sure if he was the chef, or just a damn good cook), was busy preparing all sorts of dishes... the best of which was my Basalmic Chicken Sandich on sliced sourdough. That was the bomb!  Then we took home a half a dozen, freshly made scones that captivated my family! 5 Stars!  Just don't tell too many people. Keep it just between us, okay!  Buono Petito!"}
{"text":"The Mad Batter is one of our favorite breakfast spots.  Always excellent service and friendly folks even when the place is packed.  Great coffee, pastries and a menu that continues to outdo itself.  Try the Billy Goat or German Crepes; everything is good.  If you are looking to stuff your face with cheap lackluster Denny's style food, this is NOT your place.  They take pride and put effort in their dishes and it shows.  Have breakfast and grab a scone or cookie for the road.  Keep it up Mad Batter, we'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  The \"Stack Attack\" is so good.  The gravy is what sets it apart from other places.  There isn't a bad thing on the menu and the coffee is good too!  The only issue is that you come out smelling like the place if they don't have the door open.  They need better ventilation."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The people working were rude and the manager was not happy to be there. They wouldn't let us use the groupon we had a screen shot of with the voucher number but they said the won't accept it. Will defiantly not be going back. And it would be a good idea to get some vents in there so when they are cooking, and you are trying to enjoy your meal your eyes aren't burning."}
{"text":"I love this little restaurant! I came in with family and ordered the burger that has a bacon jam on it. I was a little hesitant to have it but the fam insisted that it was awesome. I am so glad I listened because I haven't had a burger that good in a long time!

They even have pastries here that you can order and I plan to be back to try a few. The staff is extremely nice and friendly. You speak with them and they seem like friends and you've known them a long time. The layout and decor of the place is pretty awesome too. Extremely cozy and welcoming. I can't wait to come back and try other things on the menu. I absolutely love places like this. Off the chain (double pun if you think about it) restaurant that will not disappoint. Come and check it out!"}
{"text":"Sad!!!! Place is so cute!!!! Food was decent! Service absolutely horrible!!!! Took forever had to ask for coffee 3 Times. My daughter ordered her breakfast three times before they got It right. Not impressed. But it's a cute spot and busy!!! Henderson needs this so they just need to work on customer service"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It has such a cute and fun atmosphere. The food is delicious! Coffee and service is great as well. Make sure you try the Potato Hash!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The employees are great and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Cute little shop not exactly what I was expecting from the pictures.

We have been on and adventure trying to find all the little coffee shops in Vegas and we were expecting an espresso with our pastries and there is no espresso's here. Just diner style coffee"}
{"text":"My husband and I have come here twice. First time we came after 11 so we were a little disappointed we couldn't order breakfast but I think they changed that now. But we did enjoy what we got then. 

This last time we went, we got breakfast. We both got the goat cheese breakfast sandwich, it was delicious! Loved the cheesy hash browns. My husband got a cupcake which he said was awesome! 

Service was fine and look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Wow I didn't mean to be very confrontational as I see you're taking it that way. I never said he had an attitude and the right thing to do is customer service would have asked me if I wanted him to brew another pot. After you review I will never go back there again considering that you really over thought what I put and I still gave you guys three stars or some people would give one I hope everything works out for you and your business have a nice day"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, good prices, and a friendly staff. I highly recommend the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"I just adore this place. Atmosphere service and food.  My fav is the XL but I always have leftovers. The potato hash is what keeps me coming back. They also have a punch card that allows you to get discounts. They have daily deals and specialty coffees also."}
{"text":"The only good part of our experience was the food, which, when we finally actually got it, was fairly tasty (although the apple slaw was drenched). However the service was slow (waited a while for menus, waters weren't refilled, etc) and the server didn't seem to care much. We then waited around 30 minutes to get our food after we placed our order, and the place wasn't even that busy. Then to top it off, the prices on our bill didn't match the menu prices (two different kids meals were $1 more each and the bacon added to my sandwich was 25 cents more than the menu prices). When I pointed this out to the server she fixed it but didn't actually apologize for the issue. Seems a little shady that a place with a fairly simple menu has their prices set higher than the menu. This place needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"Tried this spot today for the first time.  We were a little skeptical when we drove up and no cars to be seen.  When we walked in there was a very pungent offensive odor, definitely not food.  There were no customers.  We took a seat and the server brought over moist menus.  She took our drink orders and kept asking if we were ready to order.  My husband asked for water and the BBQ Chicken Sandwich with Apple slaw.  I got iced tea and the Cobb Salad, asked for blue cheese dressing which they didn't have and asked to add the warmed balsamic chicken for an additional $2.  Our drinks came out and there was no Splenda...only Equal, Sweet and Low and Stevia in the Raw.  Tea was really strong.  Our food finally came and my husband was given a dirty fork to eat with.  My salad, which was $8.95 before adding chicken, was the size of a side salad.  The mixed greens were warm and wilted.  There was once piece of overcooked chicken, two slices of boiled egg, what looked like overcooked scrambled eggs, no avocado, no bleu cheese...and only a few tomato pieces.  The best part was the bacon (perfectly cooked) and the ranch dressing, and I don't care for Ranch.  My husband loved his sandwich and apple slaw.  Mine was not worth $10.95 by any means.  Grateful to Yelp for the 10% off coupon for checking in.

I do not recommend this spot.  Sorry..."}
{"text":"Not only is the food delicious... I had them custom make a cake for my sisters sweet 16 and it came out amazing!! It only took them 2 days to finish and she absolutely loved it!! The people working there helped me out because I've never ordered a cake before and they walked me through the different ways they could do everything and I appreciate them taking the time to help me out. Would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Frequent here often.  A great place to ride your bike via the Pacific Railroad Trail. The owners are Henderson locals and soo sweet!! Although the service is a bit inconsistent,  it is improving. My favorite thing to order is the quiche skillet with hash browns. Mmmmm. Unlimited coffee refills and delicious Nutella creeps.  You can't go wrong.  Oh yeah, they also make homemade protein bars and nutbutters. Yep,  this place rocks!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden spot for a yummy place to go to.Its great for breakfast and brunch.We love the stack attack. It reminds me of bakery cafes from back east. Their macaroons are to die for."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the crepes on my first visit, and on my 2nd visit I had the tri-tip slider and it was fantastic...full of sweet tender meat and cole slaw. In fact, I liked it so much I went back for it again a few days ago......and.......not as good. That's why the rating gets dropped a star.

Consistency is difficult. It seems like they have new people at the counter all the time. This slider didn't have as much meat, and the meat itself was a bit dryer and shredded. It was good, but not as good as before, and not as much of a deal as it felt the first time. 

I hope they have good success. I will try to get back early enough for the biscuits and gravy. But I'm losing faith in the place a little bit."}
{"text":"I've lived in Henderson my entire life and always root for a place like Mad Batter. I've been coming here for a couple years now and brought a few friends here also and have tried so hard to not have to write a review like this but unfortunately it's time. The service here is not good at all. Majority of the time I feel like I have to force a waiter to help me. Any variations I want from the menu are always a hassle and \"not something they want to ask the cook about because of his mood.\" Our order was wrong and all we wanted was it redone and that was even difficult to get. The male cook seemed extremely put off by the redo. Food quality is decent, just need to improve the staff."}
{"text":"A phenomenal little breakfast spot. They specialize in breakfast and brunch but now they also serve dinner! 

Upon first impression, this place doesn't look like much on the outside. The inside however is cute, petite, and very cozy. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our breakfast and even helped ourselves to some of their pastries and coffee. Their coffee was fresh! 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. It's perfect for a breakfast date or if your coming from Boulder City heading towards Las Vegas, this is a nice pit stop. Just know that this is a small establishment and catering to large groups may be a hassle!"}
{"text":"While I found the food to be mediocre, the service and ideas were cute. Everything sounds enticing but, I wasn't overwhelmed with excitement and the taste of my meal and neither was my boyfriend. We bought some pastries and they were really yummy according to the audience they were presented to. I would go back for the pastries but not to dine in"}
{"text":"Easly the best breakfast in Henderson, lunch is fantastic too...  friendly and fast service, everything fresh..  love it !!!  =)"}
{"text":"The food was OK, and the ambiance was nice, but the dining room became very smoky due to the kitchen being in the same space. The servers were very nice and made the experience worth 4 stars."}
{"text":"10% off your order when you check in! Don't you love people who love Yelpers?

They are the cutest shop in Henderson. I'm so glad I found this hidden gem! What used to be a subway, turned into a magical coffee/brunch spot. I can't believe I just found out about this place! 

It's definitely a local spot where you can find many regulars coming again and again. They have a bigger menu than I had imagined and it's super hard to choose from! They have breakfast, brunch, and lunch during the week, and serve dinner now on Fridays and Saturdays. 

Their pricing is excellent for the amount of food you get, and the quality is even better. I got the chicken salad croissant which had almonds and cranberries and it was delicious! I never finish my food and this meal had me wanting more. Most meals come with a side, I believe, and I got the fruit bowl. I felt healthier as ever!

It was Tuesday, 2 for 1 cookies!!!! Who can pass on that? Their bakery options looked so yummy! I got the chocolate chip, two Oreo, and snicker doodle cookies. I'm gonna have to come back multiple times to try everything I can. They were definitely a hit and I can't wait to try everything on their menu. I'm planning on bringing my mom next time. I could totally see this place as my go to spot."}
{"text":"Food here isn't bad and I will go back to try something different but I ordered one of the burritos and it was plain I had to keep salting it and there aren't any sides included with it. My husband ordered chicken avocado crepes and did not like them again it was a bit plain. It did come with banana bread which was delicious. I would definitely come back to try more pastries! Hopefully the next thing I order is a better choice"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! The sandwiches are very tasty - we had a croissant and brie/bacon sandwiches which had the perfect combination between sweet and savory. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is great. Like other Yelpers have noted, it had a real small-town feel.
I found this place because I was on Yelp looking for a tea house to take my out of town, tea-loving cousin. Although definitely not a tea house, we both thoroughly enjoyed.
They have an array of teas in a cabinet to choose from...they bring you a carafe of hot water to steep your own.
We ordered crepes, and a mushroom, spinach, bacon scramble with a side of the house potatoes! We finished every bite even though we were full half way through!
We also left with bags of scones, as it was buy 2 get one free day! Also delish!
The staff were so friendly and helpful...
I gave 4 stars because they have packaged creamers on the tables instead of fresh half and half or milk...just a pet peeve of mine! 
I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Exited the highway looking for a place to grab a bite. The food was delicious and the service was great. I had the skillet with the potato hash as a side. Very flavorful with just a bit of a kick from their spicy sauce. Had to get some bakery goodies for later. I will stop again if I'm in the area."}
