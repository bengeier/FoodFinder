{"text":"I tried this place on a recommendation from a friend.  I put in a timed carry out order for 2 half baked pies.  The owner met me at the cash register and was very friendly.  He checked me out quickly and gave me good directions on finishing the pies.  I ordered these half baked because I had to travel 45 minutes home and didn't want to reheat them.  I ordered 2 large pizzas and they fed 5 people with plenty of leftovers.    They were incredibly delicious and I would place them in the top 2 pizza shops in Northeast Ohio.  Maybe #1, but would have to have Gioninios and a slice from this place at the same time to decide.  I have had pizza in NYC, Chicago, China and England.  Believe it or not, Chinese corn pizza is great.  This shop beats them all!  It's almost as good as my homemade pies but how can you beat homemade?  The dough is perfect, the ingredients are perfect, the sauce is perfect and the stuffed crust was amazing!  My family loved it and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Thank you Sirna's for making customer service your top priority.  It meant a lot that you followed up with me with a personal email on how to resolve the issue I had in March.  Also, I had another pizza from your shop today and that it was excellent as usual.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Local, fresh ingredients. Very tasty pizza pies. Among my top 5! Simple, reasonably priced, excellent service. Salads are very good as well. highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The best pizza place in Ohio!!!! The Sirna family are class A kind of people!!! The staff is friendly and courteous!!!! Keep up the good work!!!!"}
{"text":"Terrific pizza. The bacon and sausage are homemade, and all of the vegetables are sourced daily from the family farm. Premium ingredients make for a delicious pizza. The owner is very friendly, and the prices are very good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Auburn from Lakewood and were very pleasantly surprised to find such a great pizza place in our new neighborhood. After 11 years in Lakewood, it's hard not to judge all other pizza places against Angelo's but I must say that Sirna's is definitely in a league with the best of them.   So far, we've had wings (the dry rubs are great), pizza in thin, original and stuffed crust, the zucchini fries, loaded jo-jos and the Chicken Parm sandwich. Everything is really good and you can definitely tell that they use high-quality, local ingredients.   Sirna's is the antithesis of a chain pizza place that gets a semi full of processed ingredients every week - it's an unexpected jem and well worth the drive from Chagrin Falls or further if you want great pizza, apps and sandwiches. You can even pick up some great ice cream and milk while you're there.  Dine in ambience is nothing special but there are some tables. They seem to do a strong take out biz and deliver to Auburn Township, we haven't tried delivery yet.    Don't everyone rush out too fast though, I don't want to have to wait too long for our Friday night order to be ready!"}
{"text":"I am new to Northeast Ohio, but my boyfriend introduced me to Sirna's Farm.  (We love their peanut butter!)  Recently, Sirna's took over a pizza shop in Auburn and we ventured out there last Saturday night to give it a try, taking home a piping hot pizza, half meat lover's and half olives and fresh garlic -- with extra cheese, of course!  It was delicious.  I judge my pizza on the crust and the cheesiness -- both were excellent!    Definitely stop in and give this pizza a try."}
{"text":"We got carry out at sirnas it was decent, it was very greasy. It was pretty cheap we got some cheesy bread that was amazing. If you live around there you should try it I would go again but it's not my first choice."}
{"text":"Great find! Multiple gluten free options too. Very friendly staff. Will definitely be returning when we are in the area again!"}
{"text":"Just had a pizza delivered...it was burnt. Very disappointed....we will not be ordering from here any time soon!!"}
{"text":"We love visiting Sirna's Farm for their fresh fruit and vegetables so decided to try their pizza place. We were happy to see they use local fresh ingredients, including their own amazing sausage. We ordered the Meat Lover's Pizza--sausage (their own), pepperoni and nitrate free bacon and a Veggie Pizza--Artichoke, peppers, onions and mushroom.  The family was very friendly and we had a nice conversation while we waited for our pizza's--it's nice to see a family working together.  We were happily to see they sold their pickles, almond butter and peanut butter, too.  We will be back and can't wait to try the apple pie dessert pizza."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE pizza place of all time. Everything I've tried here is delicious, but my personal favorites are their flatbreads!  Don't be fooled by the unassuming exterior, the food here is always delicious, not to mention super affordable and convenient. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"This little pizza shop is a real gem!  We came through just visiting this area and decided pizza sounded good.  But this is WAY better than your typical cheap pizza.  The ingredients they use are all locally-sourced top-of-the-line (and you can really appreciate the difference!), and the owner was as hospitable and nice as can be.  It's a small restaurant but absolutely a five-star find."}
{"text":"My son and I stopped in for a last minute snack pizza (we shared a personal small pie , thin crust, with pepperoni and sausage).  While we were waiting, the owner offered my son and I a beverage on the house, a gesture I don't believe I've experienced in a pizza place.  The pizza was excellent, sauce tangy with a little sweetness, and the cheese was rich and pulled to a wonderful stringyness.  The sausage is a family recipe that's over one hundred years old.  It has a hint of anise that compliments the other herbs and the pork very well.  The pepperoni had a really good kick of spice, and the whole thing was eaten in less than 2 minutes.  We considered ordering another to take home, but chose not to because I already had a dinner going at home.  We also bought a half gallon of I homogenized chocolate milk, 14% butterfat Chocolate Ice Cream, dill pickles, and almond butter.  Quite a hodgepodge of things, but they are all very high quality products produced locally without a lot of processing or preservatives.  Give Sirna's Pizza a try, you'll love it."}
{"text":"My wife and I don't mind traveling to have a good meal. I stumbled across Sirna's Pizza on Yelp and the Farm to Pizza concept didn't disappoint. Great crust, zesty sauce,  and generous toppings made for a great pizza experience. The owner was on premises and was very nice. The White Collar Pizza was a tasty and unique specialty pie. We will be back. Give them a try. So much better than chain pizza."}
{"text":"Pizzas made with their own farmed veggies and meats can't be beat!!  We've been a customer of Sirna's Farm down on SR-44 for years.  We were excited when we heard they took over this pizza place November 2013 because we loved the idea of pizzas made with ingredients fresh from their farm!   Our first try was their large meat lovers pizza ($16.00), which includes Sirna's own bacon and sausage, plus a pack of hot wings ($7.99).  The meats on the pizza were absolutely delicious on their own.  Combined with their own great sauce and a nicely risen, fluffy (not hard or burnt!!) crust, this was definitely a good pizza we both enjoyed!    We used to be fans of the former incarnations of this pizza joint when it was Poppa's then Vinny's then Franco's but they completely lost our business when their quality flew out the window.  Sirna's, however, promises to bring back that quality by sourcing as many local ingredients as they can - either from their own farm or other co-ops in the immediate area.  And for that reason we're willing to come back and pay the premium pizza price versus using the cheapie coupons at chain pizza joints.   We're looking forward to the pizzas fresh from the 2014 growing season!!"}
{"text":"We stopped there on after going to Geauga County Fair Thursday.. We ordered some calzones and some gluten free pizzas.    highlights  - very friendly staff and owner  - I personally got a meat lovers calzone, which was great.. fresh meat inside the calzone, the best I ever had.. I did not know what to expect but was happy to see fresh cut meat, not canned..    - gluten free pizza. My sister had this and she said it was best gluten free pizza she had ever  added bonus. while waiting I tried a bottle of Rowdy Cow Milk.. this was whole milk. so thick and creamy that the cream was formed at the top of the bottle.. it was like drinking a milk shake. .the best milk I ever had.  Best staff, best calzone, best gluten free pizza, and as a bonus, best milk ever for the wait."}
{"text":"We tried the caprese pizza with the arugula. It was excellent. It is fresh tomato, basil, and Mozzetta on a garlic olive oil. I can't wait to go back to try another of their signature pizzas."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate our son's birthday. The owner came out and talked to us & explained that a lot of the ingredients are fresh from his farm. We started with the cheesy bread & wings. Both were great. The pizza was delicious!!  Then the owner brought out a Nutella dessert pizza with bananas and it was AMAZING!!!  would highly recommend- we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza all the way around. The dough is delicious, the cheese and toppings are fresh, and you can taste the fresh ingredients. We usually get a large pizza with green peppers and sausage and their cheesy bread which is great.  Another big positive is the fact that I have ordered from them many times, and never once has there been an issue with the order or integrity of the food. We always get our money's worth, which is my last point. They seem to have priced better than most pizza places around the area."}
{"text":"Always get great service from calling in an order and they have all my information on file attached to my phone number.  The delivery person is always friendly and delivers the pizza in great shape.  I don't have to work out the cheese being all in one side.  We love the taco pizza."}
{"text":"Stopped at Sirna's after volleyball tournament- great service and even better food!  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Disappointed PIZZA AGAIN ! sausage wasn't even on all the pieces only a couple , Once was great now its not consistent..tried to give it another try but failed. This place used to be Great now its on the bottom, sure it wont be around in the future since its on a downfall spin, oh , and the Prices are HIGHER $$$ for less.................How does it go,  one day I owned a railroad... today, brother can you spare a dime!"}
