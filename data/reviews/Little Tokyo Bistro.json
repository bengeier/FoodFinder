{"text":"Very nice place excellent staff each one of them greeted me. The sushi was prepared fresh. Got the sushi very quickly. I had the spicy tuna and avocado maki rolls and they were very very spicy but very delicious! I also had shrimp maki rolls, very tasty.   All in all if you're looking for a good place to get some very fine sushi this is the place to go. The quality matches the price everything was very very good. I had a great experience here and recommend it to everybody."}
{"text":"It's about time I reviewed this Southside sushi staple.  My family probably eats here several times a month and have become quite familiar with the menu, level of service, and staff.  If you're searching for some quality sushi at a great value, this is your place.  When you first come in, you'll most likely be welcomed by the extremely cheery and friendly hostess, Alice. Upon being seated, you'll received a warm towel to wipe your hands while you peruse the menu.  As well as a full dinner and sushi menu, Little Tokyo also has a good selection of wine, sake, and plum wine.    The sushi rolls found at Little Tokyo are pretty standard, but are well made with high-quality ingredients.  The sushi chefs are very skilled and careful in their preparation. You can't go wrong with the Black Marlin & Tuna Roll, Rainbow Roll, or Spicy Tuna Roll.  Their dinner menu offers a variety of soups and salads, as well as hibachi and chef's specialties.  I personally like to start off with some edamame and miso soup before moving on to my sushi and sashimi.  Some of my other family members begin with sushi as an appetizer before their hibachi entree.  Whatever your hunger level and taste may be, you're sure to find something to satisfy.  Don't forget to end your meal with some mochi, a Japanese dessert that consists of flavored ice cream encased in doughy, sticky rice.  Or, you could always pop into the frozen yogurt joint next door if that's your thing.  I can't say enough good things about the exceptional level of service, consistent quality of the sushi, ambiance, and value.  Dine in or take out, you're sure to have a great experience at Little Tokyo."}
{"text":"I think the staff and employers are great! They're really nice and truly know what customer service is.   My complaint is the sushi. I had a sushi deluxe and a rainbow roll. They're not skimpy on the amount of fish they give you in each piece. But the fish they serve is just plain bland. The first piece I ate was the tuna nigiri and it really surprised me how tasteless it was. I figured that I just needed to wash my palate but even after that the salmon had no taste. I was just in awe of how bad the quality of fish they had.  Great decoration and presentation on the plate. Service is great as well.  Sushi quality is quite abysmal."}
{"text":"My son and daughter-in-law live in Pittsburgh and Little Tokyo is their favorite restaurant.  My wife and I were visiting a few weeks ago and we all went to Little Tokyo for a sushi dinner.  I have had quite a bit of sushi in numerous restaurants over the years and I can confidently recommend Little Tokyo.  The various sushi rolls we had were all delicious, and combined with reasonable prices, will make me want to go back whenever I am in Pittsburgh visiting."}
{"text":"This was a great dinner with the friends to celebrate graduations and businesses. We had like 50 pieces of sushi and it was delicious. Tip: spicy tuna IS spicy.  Everything went great, the fish is super fresh, the combinations are creative and delicious, the wine selection is really good as well but my 3 stars are for the dessert.  The moment we opened the menu all of us saw mochis and yelled with emotion, and after such a great sushi feast, mochis were the expected gran finale.  Sorry for us, they were really bad. We ordered mango, red bean and green tea, and the only passable ones were the green tea. Mango and red bean had crunchy shells instead of gooey and the flavor was off.   I'll come back, for some great sushi with good price and a great and friendly service. But I'll never stay for dessert again."}
{"text":"Have you ever seen Jiro Dreams of Sushi?  It's a documentary on the oldest chef to ever earn 3 Michelen stars.  The movie portrays a man who is completely dedicated, passionate, and engrossed in the quest of creating perfect sushi.  He takes such pride in his work, it's inspiring.  So now, everytime I see someone making sushi, I want to ask him, \"Have *you* seen the movie with sushi chef Jiro?\" in hopes that they, too, have pride in their sushi.  In 2 years in the 'burgh, I've not been totally content with any particular place so far.  Littly Tokyo Bistro has wonderful service, and both chefs and waitstaff are very, very friendly.  To me, that makes a big difference, and it's not as common as you would think it would be in a service-industry.    As for food, we had the Spicy Tuna Tartare with Caviar ($9.95) as recommended on Yelp!  Eh, there was a lot of it, and it was spicy with a kick, but otherwise a bit bland.  We were rather hungry, so we finished the plate.  It's definitely not chopped to a fine tartare, and the caviar is lost.  The Udon broth ($9.95) lacked a depth of flavor I'm accustomed with these soups.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.  And the sushi!  The rolls were well packed, and the rice was seasoned well.  The portions are big, and a smidge bigger than bite size.  I'm sure Jiro wouldn't approve, but my big mouth did approve!  We had the standard rolls ($5-6) (California, Spicy Tuna, Shrimp Tempura, Eel) and were, overall, pretty pleased.  If I lived on this side of the bridge(s), I would probably come here again.  I'm not sure if I'd make the effort for takeout/dinner for the sushi, but that's not to say that it's bad.  It takes some real food with pop to overwhelm my baseline indolence."}
{"text":"Dolsot bibimbap... um absolutely delicious! It's a quiet, quaint place where you can get great sushi and other tasty Korean or Japanese based food at a descent price. The wine selection is large and not badly priced(how can you diss any place that has bottles of wine for $20 and under)? If you don't look for the sign, you'll overlook it. It's a hidden gem in the Southside. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best ever!! My husband and I love little Tokyo bistros. We visit at least once a week.  Great food and great service. ..luv it!"}
{"text":"The sushi was very fresh and extremely delicious! I will definitely be coming back. The atmosphere is quiet and great for catching up with friends without having to wait a long time for a table."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Portions are try perfect size, not too big.  And they have one of the best ginger salad dressings I've had!"}
{"text":"My new go to place for sushi/ sashimi in Pittsburgh - best value for price IMHO.   I order take out and my sashimi is always very fresh, nicely cut with good size portions and delicious.  Never disappointed me and very pleased with the quality of my sushi."}
{"text":"Great sushi and very friendly staff (even the sushi chef and owner asked how my meal was) but the SiriusXM Love station was brutal to listen to."}
{"text":"When in Pittsburgh's South Side and craving sushi most people flock to the corner of 17th and Carson to Nakama.  When I first moved into the neighborhood I followed suit.  After squeezing myself into a chair at the sushi bar to avoid the painfully long wait, I was served below average sushi during which I could hardly hear the person next to me talking.  Personally, I don't need valet parking, button down shirts and high heels to enjoy my sushi.  I was officially on the hunt for another sushi joint in my neighborhood.   Little Tokyo Bistro was next up on my list.  Upon entering the sushi bar is immediately to the right and I was greeted with a smile and a \"Hello!\" by the chef's.  I then was promptly seated and already liked the more subdued, low-key atmosphere.  The décor is what you would typically expect from a sushi restaurant.  The most important thing for me is cleanliness (besides food) and in my experience Little Tokyo meets this requirement.    For starters we decided on miso soup and seaweed salad.  The miso soup was a bit lacking in the substance department but the seaweed salad was very satisfying.  During this Friday evening, it was busy but not overcrowded and it took about 20 minutes for our rolls to arrive at our table.  Like most sushi restaurants, the rolls are served family style and are brought out on one plate.  We asked the waitress to point out the names of each roll so we knew who ordered what, perfect.    On this evening, I had decided on a yellow fin, spicy tuna, and an eel roll.  All three were fresh and terrific tasting.  More importantly the sushi stayed together as picked it up with my chop sticks and dipped it in my wasabi soy sauce mixture (admittedly 3/4th wasabi...I love the stuff).  There is nothing more frustrating than sushi that falls apart as you pick it up.  Upon our exit we were again greeted with a friendly smile and a \"Thank You!\" by the chef's.  If I'm craving sushi and I want to stay in the South Side, Little Tokyo Bistro is my go-to place.  Another plus is they are available for pickup.  I've had about a dozen meals here and all of them have been very solid.  This isn't my favorite sushi in Pittsburgh (Andy's wins that award) but it sure hits the spot as my neighborhood favorite."}
{"text":"Came with fair expectations. I was disappointed. Food was barely decent and presentation was quite poor. Some items we ordered were not eatable, especially the tempura (all the items): very thick fried layer of hard fried shell. Horrible.  Serving was poor as well unfortunately.   Will definitely never come back here. I cannot understand how it got such good reviews."}
{"text":"I was hesitate about trying this place because I have known about it for years. I am your typical Pittsburgh native foodie and believe in spending my money on quality food.  This place is hands down by far the best sushi in the \"burgh\" and is reasonably priced. Their warm sake with delicious as well.  Will definitely being going back here again in the future."}
{"text":"I've been to this place once before and it was great both times. We got the sushi/sashimi combo- the albacore was wonderful. Everything is so fresh, the sushi chefs are polite and welcoming, and the service is great. I've never had better salad than this (and the Little Tokyo in Mt. Lebanon) because the ginger dressing is real ginger (not random and creamy like other sushi places). We ordered just enough food (not too much) so we got fried ice cream for dessert- delicious!! :P"}
{"text":"I came on a Sunday evening and there were only three or four groups there.   We had tempura, rainbow roll, spicy tuna roll and black marlin & white tuna roll. The rolls were all pretty good. I really like the sashimi on top of the rainbow roll. The tempura was the worst I've ever had. The flour inside the huge broccoli floret wasn't done at all. We showed it to the waitress and got it cooked again. However, it din't get much better the second time either.   The service was ok. The waitress asked us \"how is everything\" before we could get a bite....   I probably will come back for the maki sushi."}
{"text":"There's a saying in the oil field for some who talks a big game then can't deliver: \"He's all hat and no cattle!\"  This saying can easily be adapted to sushi restaurants: \"All tank and no fish.\"  I'd refer to a sushi restaurant as all tank and no fish if what I'm paying for is a sushi experience instead of a sushi meal.  It may just be me but I'd rather pay for the food than the ambiance.  You know the kind of place, there's a DJ, no room at a bar crowded with cast offs from America's Top Model and gladiators from the Steelers practice squad, the staff looks like a Benetton ad, and after a few sake bombs you could mistake your location for a night club.  The interior and location of this restaurant translates into very expensive fish for customer; fish that isn't always fresh or thoughtfully made.    Tell you what I am looking for in a sushi joint: Japanese nationals.  It is very comforting to go into a Japanese restaurant and see actual Japanese people running the place.  This is what you are going to find at Little Tokyo Bistro, a friendly Japanese family preparing and serving your food.  They invented it, so in my opinion their version is best.  The second thing I look for is the quality/freshness of the fish on the sashimi platter.  This is fish in its truest essence.  It's not fried or encased in cream cheese, sitting on rice or wrapped in seaweed.  No sir, just the fish.  We ate the sushi deluxe platter at Tokyo Bistro 4 times in one week and not one bite tasted anything but fresh. Tastiest fish I've had in Pittsburgh so far and that is why we will keep going back. That is not to say we haven't enjoyed their rolls as well.  Had one the other night that at the time I could have sworn was the tastiest thing I've ever eaten.    The only thing I wish they did at Little Tokyo Bistro was keep a few more bottles of sake chilled, because sometimes, one bottle just ain't gonna cut it!"}
{"text":"Actually, 3 and a half stars. The food is good - nothing really leaps out, but everything is fresh and well priced. Service is attentive and friendly.  My major hesitation is the ambiance. It's clean, but really very dingy and rather depressing - the seats on the booths move when someone sits down behind you. Also the music - 70's rock - is pretty jarring - how about some nice koto music????"}
{"text":"Ambiance: the outside actually looks quite authentic, but among entering, you basically have an awkward blend of Westernized Asian. The place was very empty.  Service: the lady kept rushing us but was very friendly. She answered our questions. In general, it wasn't bad. she filled our water very promptly, the towels were very good!  Food: TERRIBLE. I will say I have very high requirements for sushi since I lived in japan for a while, but go to Tamari if you want fresh sushi. The tuna was dry, the sea urchin was down right disgusting. The prices are extremely extensive for the quality they offer. The rolls weren't bad, but that's mainly due to the sauces, and not the ingredients themselves. I would rank even cheap places like oishi bento or campus sushi places higher than this. Their tonkatsu was also VERY DRY. Expensive, low quality. NOT GOOD. I should've known from the start with the cliche ginger dressing salad and the artificial miso soup that this place wouldn't be good."}
{"text":"Really good sushi, especially for the price.  I've never been disappointed here, which is saying something.  It's definitely not the trendiest spot..but it is really tasty.    The atmosphere here is pretty standard asian restaurant...nice, simple.  The wait staff is attentive and fast.  I've had more than a few free desserts after getting sushi here.  The food is nice, but I can only comment on the sushi.  The selections are fresh and prepared nicely.  The Hawaii roll is literally one of the coolest rolls I've had anywhere, with blue crab and tempura shrimp...the texture is great.  All of their rolls and nigiri are good.  I've been very, very satisfied here.  The sake selection is also nice."}
{"text":"I have sushi from time to time in San Francisco and a few times in Osaka and Tokyo. But I most regularly get my fix here. They never fail to please. Fresh product, fine service, fair price. I am a lunch regular but enjoyed dinner at the bar tonight."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Pittsburgh! !! My husband and I love coming here, the food is outstanding, fresh and the service is amazing.  The owner and his wife are so welcoming.  He comes and asks if everything is ok or if we need anything.  Good gesture! The prices are decent. I love it here and will return soon."}
{"text":"I love Little Tokyo Bistro (the South Side location). Everyone there is so pleasant, and the sushi may be the best in the city. This place puts all their love into the food. The nigiri really highlights the quality of the ingredients. The hotate (scallop) and salmon nigiri are my favorites, but they actually have a larger variety of fish than many other places around. They have amaebi (small, sweet shrimp). The sushi rolls are beautifully executed and delicious. I highly recommend the first date roll. My fiancé and I sometimes share the sushi or sashimi deluxe and a roll and add on another miso soup and salad because the meals come with a soup and salad. That is enough for two people. I feel like people might not take a sushi restaurant in the South Side seriously, but this place is great!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Food is excellent. You get giant beers. And everyone working there is so kind and welcoming. They make you feel good to be there. We've ordered something different everytime and have always enjoyed it. Very fresh, beautiful presentation and the atmosphere is very relaxed. Brought my Dad here who does not eat sushi and he loved the options on the menu for non-sushi eaters. He had some sort of stir fry and it looked very good, he said it was delicious."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Everything is fresh and delicious. The staff is nice and polite. Every time I come here I enjoy the food. I highly recommend it if you like classic sushi. If the southside is too far go to the original spot on Mt. Lebanon."}
{"text":"This is my absolute FAVORITE South Side lunch spot. While I'm not a sushi fan, I find the very tasty \"Kitchen Chef's Specialties\" quite a bargain. The Yankiniku is delicious and the beef nearly melts in your mouth. It comes with steamed veggies that are cooked just right--not mushy, but not too crunchy either--and choice of miso soup or a house salad. As an added bonus, the service is consistently warm and friendly.   I've also tried the Butaniku Shogayaki, Tonkatsu, and Chicken Katsu. All were equally good and just $7.95. I'm not sure you'll find a better lunch anywhere for that price. Dinner is reasonably priced too and everything is available for take out."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi on the Southside. We got a handful of various vegetable rolls, a tempura roll, a salmon skin roll and a First Date roll. It was all pretty good. As usual for Pittsburgh, the rice wasn't vinegared like its supposed to be. But besides that, everything tasted great. Wasn't too expensive, either.  The ambiance is cool. Its all like neon seats and its well lighted. The servers were nice. The sushi chefs were very pleasant and were all working quite diligently in the middle of the room where the sushi area is.  We also got a a bubble tea and mochi ice cream. The bubble tea wasn't tapioca balls, but little tiny balls with juice in them. Good, but I was expecting the tapioca.  Great place, I will be back."}
{"text":"I wish there were better options for sushi in Pittsburgh but alas. This place is on the better end of things. If you've never had sushi in,  say,  NYC, this place will do.   But I personally prefer the Korean dishes here, perfect dolsot bimibap and excellent kal-bee makes a soul happy."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place, which is why I was really looking forward to it.  Not sure if I hit them on an off night, but the sushi was not good.  I sure hope this isn't the best sushi in Pittsburgh.  Didn't care for the atmoshphere...kind of dingy."}
{"text":"Came here for a quiet little dinner in South Side, and everything was quite delicious. My friend has the sushi rolls while I had chicken hibachi. I wish I had know there were mushrooms in it; I would've asked for those to be taken out. Other than that, the service was the food. The meal good, a little pricey but good."}
{"text":"This is by far the very BEST sushi in the Pittsburgh area!! The owner is hospitable and gracious, always greets us hello and wishes us well on our way out. Used to live in the neighborhood and would frequent multiple times a week. A group of friends and I were having dinner and celebrating a new job one evening. We were pleasantly enjoying ourselves when the owner presented us with a bottle of sake unsolicited and on the house. Everything on the menu is fresh and delicious! A number of specialty rolls as well as smooth fresh nigiri and sashimi. I now drive an hour a few times a month to dine here! Best ginger dressing I've ever had and ample wine options! You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Out for dinner with my family while visiting.  The food is excellent, reasonably priced and so good a picky 5 year old will eat it.  From a sushi bar to Korean and Japanese favorites, bubble tea and a full bar they have everything."}
{"text":"Little Tokyo Bistro stands out on Carson Street in a lot of ways. South Side isn't best known for its Asian eateries, for starters. Plus Little Tokyo Bistro is a pretty distinct business in the area, with wooden doors and a wooden gate beckoning for people to stop in. Past said doors is lovely restaurant decked out with more wooden decorations, a bonsai tree, and decor and patterns along the floor and walls designed to remind you of a zen garden. It's definitely one of the better designed Japanese eateries in the area, and the not-too-loud radio in the background was a nice bonus when I stopped in.  When I ate here  I was given multiple menus: the wine list, the main menu, and a printed paper list of sushi. Unfortunately there were no descriptions to go with this last list, which is definitely not helpful when your list says things like \"Pittsburgh roll\" and \"rock 'n' roll.\" So I ended up ordering the shogayaki (grilled pork slices marinated in ginger sauce and served with vegetables). Yum! In a nice change of pace from the average eatery, the meal came with not too much and not too little sauce, meaning that I could mix it throughout the dish as I pleased. Plus I could still enjoy the distinct flavors of the veggies and fairly tender pork underneath the small layer of sauce. In addition to the great main course, the meal also came with your standard salad and miso soup. Eh. Like I said: standard. And the soup was admittedly not as jam packed with taste as it could have been. For the most part though the meal was quite good.  All of the food cost me just about $20 before tipping - not a bad price at all when considering the pricing at other sushi joints. And on top of the pricing and the good food, I just loved the little things here, like hearing my waitress humming along to the radio. It really elevated the restaurant in my mind and made my whole meal a good one. I hope this place is a lot busier other nights of the week, as they're definitely a nice addition to the South Side (and a great alternative to the very noisy Nakama down the street)."}
{"text":"We were the last customers, coming in at 9:45.  They were very accommodating.  We had the sushi rolls.  The Rainbow Roll was the awesome.  Clearly, best sushi in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Hawaiian Roll and spicy tuna roll.   That's what I dreamt of the other night.  I know I'm not crazy because my sister said the same thing. Could we both be crazy? Quite possible but before you judge, please go and try the sushi for yourself. #omg"}
{"text":"This the best sushi resteraunt in Pittsburgh. The quality of sushi is the main draw for me to come here. I come here at lease twice every month and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I do the sushi lunch specials quite often here. It's delish and heaps cheaper than the dinners. Haven't tried anything else yet tho, but really happy with the sushi."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for six years and never once thought to write a review. I'm here by myself today though, and figured I should.   While most others may go to Nakama for their sushi, I vastly prefer Little Tokyo. I was first introduced on a first date and have been coming back for more ever since.  The staff here are sweet and attentive, and the sushi is freshly prepared and always delicious. Their pricing is what you would expect for specialty rolls and basic fare.   I've tried all of it at least once and found I can't go without the First Date, Discovery, Dragon, or Crystal Roll.  I tend to come here with groups so we can try a bit of everything :)   Keep in mind they close for a time between lunch and dinner, so check their hours before you go!"}
{"text":"Nice little place to grab some sushi. Good for dining in or taking out."}
{"text":"I had low expectations for sushi in Pittsburgh, but WOW, this place is great and super fresh! I was shocked at how delicious my surf clam maki was and how large the amount of fish on the maki. Miso was great, tastes like homemade stock base, and my zarusoba was perfect. The wait for food to come was rather slow. So you better enjoy the company with whom you share your meal!"}
{"text":"Wonderful sushi ver much more on the traditional side. Worth checking out if you're in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great food with even better service.  You can tell the people working her love their job.  Alice is the sweetest lady and so is the cook (forget his name) highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very warm and traditional.  Staff is very welcoming. I opted for spicy tuna avocado roll and California roll. Everything was prepared fresh. Service was prompt. Prices are very reasonable Best sushi in Southside."}
{"text":"Needed a break from all the heavy american fare I had all weekend.   This place is quiet and has a good selection of sushi. The a la carte menu lists all the rolls but lacks descriptions so when there is cool sushi name I often wondered what was in it.   Prices are decent for sushi and the staff was attentive. The quality of the sushi was just ok but it's still a great place for a light dinner then off to the bars!"}
{"text":"My Go-To sushi place in Pittsburgh. The prices are reasonable, the staff and chefs are friendly and helpful and the food is top notch. I usually stick to the sushi and appetizers and I've never been let down by either. Great for a quiet date night. 5 stars well earned."}
{"text":"Update to a solid 4 stars.    Went back to Little Tokyo Bistro the other day with a group of friends and got the sushi, sashimi, and maki boat.  everything was fresh and sooooo tasty.  the boat was decently priced and enough to feed 5 hungry people.   highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We went on a surprise date to a new place.   They were totally packed and had 2 servers on. Maybe a call off and that happens. But our server could barely get to us and just dropped food and ran. If she really looked, she would have seen we didn't eat one sushi roll.  The Dean. Pureed and super fishy.   The Udon Noodles seemed Way over cooked. Wine list was crap, but I wasn't expecting anything great.   We left hungry and will not return because of the food. I can forgive some slow service."}
{"text":"Hard to believe that it's been over a year since I first reviewed Little Tokyo! After paying them another regular visit last night I figured it was time for an update!  Little Tokyo remains my favorite sushi place in Pittsburgh.  You really can't beat the service, the food, or the prices!  As soon as you walk in the door, you are greeted with a smile and cheerful hello before promptly being seated.  You'll also notice as you walk by the sushi bar that the sushi chefs will nod and greet you as well! How they manage to do that at the same time they are making their amazing sushi is beyond me!    I rarely every get anything other than the spicy scallop roll and the black marlin tuna roll. They are my two absolute favorites, though sometimes I will add in some tuna sushi, a miso soup, or a seaweed salad.  All are excellent! On last night's visit, my boyfriend opted to add the Dean Roll to our regular order, and it was a great choice.  This roll has NO rice, which I thought was interesting... but it was so good! It's spicy tuna wrapped in rice paper, topped with avocado. That's it!  It's very simple and refreshing, though it will run you $12.95. However, considering the quantity of quality spicy tuna you're getting, I'd say it's well worth the pricetag.  If you haven't been here yet, I have one question for you: WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!  Little Tokyo has my heart... and though there are other Asian bistros and sushi restaurants in the city and on Carson Street, LT remains my favorite for so many reasons."}
{"text":"Updating this to a 4. Since I have been back a few times, it didn't smell so fishy. Yay! If I am in South Side or around the area, this has turned into my go to sushi place. They have a few dinner options that are awesome for sharing with a date :) Servers are friendly. Next time I go I want to sit at the sushi bar and watch them make the rolls!"}
{"text":"By far the BEST sushi in Pittsburgh!!! This was my first time to the south side location.  I usually go to the one in Mt.Lebo. Everything is always so fresh. The spicy tuna tartare is a must. It melts in your mouth. This night the special roll was shrimp tempura wrapped in mango . The service was impeccable. It's definitely worth the prices."}
{"text":"This place was great! Great teppanyaki for a good price. Pretty chill place for Carson St too!  Definitely recommend the wagyu steak and scallop combo!"}
{"text":"I am shocked I've never rated Little Tokyo until now! This place is my all-time favorite Japanese restaurant in all of Pittsburgh! When I visit, and  I'm craving some authentic Japanese food with good company, I go here. First off, the staff is so friendly and just genuinely nice people. I love walking in and getting a huge smile from their staff. Before I moved, I was a regular, so they knew me pretty well. Hehe I'm also a pretty picky (boring) eater because I get the same thing every time. It does vary, but I normally start off with the salad and soup, shrimp balls, and then some shrimp tempura, and finally finish off the night with their delicious fried ice cream. Even though I don't order much, I can still say that all their food on the menu are amazing, and everyone needs to go here!!"}
{"text":"Considering they are less than a block from my house. I usually order take out. The american dream roll is my favorite and my sushi is always ready in 20 minutes. Very nice people and the restaurant is always so clean which I find to be important especially when serving sushi."}
{"text":"Yay for finding decent sushi in Pittsburgh!   This place has kind of a \"hole in the wall\" feel, with décor that is sort of old school strip mall stuff.  Nothing fancy, but it's clean and the service was friendly.     I ordered an 8 piece specialty roll (can't remember which one), a 6 piece spicy tuna, and a black marlin nigiri.  Hands down, the black marlin was the winner.  Soft and buttery - reminded me of white toro.  I'd order everything I got again, with maybe some minor modifications.  The spicy tuna could have been spicier for my taste.  And these were pretty big rolls, so I'd probably ask for smaller slices next time.   Overall, it is reasonably priced.  6 piece simple roll and 2 piece nigiri average $5-6 each.  The specialty rolls top out at $13 or $14, with most in the $12 range.     I will say that the menu descriptions could use some work.   They have a card that has pics and descriptions of the specialty rolls, but that's about it for sushi descriptions.  I never would have tried black marlin if my friend hadn't raved about it (mostly cause I didn't know what it was).     At the end of the day though, I'd go back again and again."}
{"text":"We hadn't been in PGH for a couple of years and wanted some sushi in a convenient place.  After running out of noisy Nakama, this place was a tasty jewel on Carson."}
{"text":"After being in Pittsburgh for 6 months I was still on the search for some solid Asian food. One day, I found myself having the ability to leave at a normal hour so did a quick yelp search for sushi and stumbled upon this joint. I had been craving sushi but not had the ability to have any good options in Pittsburgh so was eager to try this joint out. The joint is located on a strip in the Southside with multiple restaurants and bars surrounding it. The restaurant is large on the inside with a sushi bar upon your entrance. The folks greet you quickly at the door and seat you just as quickly with menus by your side. These folks have the standard menu selection of nigiris, rolls, and hot plates.   The restaurant itself would be great for date nights or large groups and everything in between. After perusing the menu, I ordered some hot sake (of course) and literally went down the list ordering a whole array of nigiris including a rainbow roll. I was a bit nervous as I have not had great experiences in Pittsburgh so far but figured I might as well go all out. I ordered yellow tail, tuna, salmon, white tuna, uni, ikura, and unagi. The rolls themselves were solid and I was glad they did not lay down on the sauce too much. The nigiris were actually pretty good and probably the best ive had in Pittsburgh. They were pretty fresh and they gave fairly large size cuts which was nice. For the amount I ordered, the price was also decent so I was happy with the outcome.  This is probably the best spot for sushi was able to find while in Pittsburgh and I was glad to have had the opportunity to grab this spot."}
{"text":"I always have given Little Tokyo Bistro a good review, but after my last two experiences here, I have to say, it gets 5 stars... and if I could give it 6, I would.  By far one of the best sushi joints in the city, and on top of that... EXCEPTIONAL service.    Fresh sushi, reasonable prices, not stuffy environment, and the amazing service makes this one of my favorite places to go to now.  They actually know how to cut the cucumber for the rolls that are wrapped with cucumber (the Sushi chefs at Nakama can take a lesson from this).    Great for groups, a quiet date night, or even for some to go sushi... Little Tokyo Bistro will never fail you!"}
{"text":"Sometimes a single dish made poorly can negatively affect one's entire experience, and that's what happened one evening several days ago.  In Pittsburgh, we used our Garmin to give us a nearby location for Asian food and selected Little Tokyo Bistro in the middle of a rain storm late one Monday night.   We ordered several items as is common in many Asian retaurants, e.g. spring rolls, tea, various sushi rolls, fried dishes, etc., and ramen. And that was the issue, a poorly made ramen, possibly the simplest dish possible that both of us tasted and thought was unpleasant, especially with the added cucumber slivers. Everything else was okay.  The service was good, the price normal. Reading the other reviews, it appears the Bistro has more to offer but that was not our brief experience."}
{"text":"Great sushi!  Happy to have found a place nearby that does sushi right- if you're a traditionalist.  Their specialty rolls aren't as good as Tamari or Nakama, but their simple spicy tuna, hamachi, and salmon rolls are fantastic! I was worried that I would need to continue to trek to Lawrenceville for my sushi cravings, but Little Tokyo hits the spot.  We were a bit surprised when we came for the first time, as we weren't expecting much, but we were pleasantly surprised.  I would suggest ordering an appetizer while you wait for your sushi, as the delay from ordering to eating is a bit long...but worth the wait in the end!"}
{"text":"Last night after dinner, we were on the hunt for some dessert, so we walked down east carson to find just the spot. I really didnt know if i wanted a brownie sundae, fried ice cream or a milkshake.   We headed into Little Tokyo and looked at the menu at the front of the restaurant. YES, they had fried ice cream- but i still couldn't decide. The sweet lady who was serving as the hostess at that moment was so nice. We informed her we really weren't sure of what we wanted and would head back most likely.. 20 minutes and 5 blocks up (& back down) Carson St we headed back.   We shared the fried ice cream and it was yummy. Bobby originally ordered one for each of us, but our server was surprised and mention it's pretty large. We could always order another if we'd like.  The only flaw was it seemed like the ice cream was a little freezer burnt.. the \"fried\" part made up for it. Honestly, it still wasn't bad at all.   Everyone who worked there was extremely friendly and their menu/sushi seemed great. We'll have to head back. I've walked by here multiple times, but this was my first experience inside. It's cute & quaint.  Oh, they also have sushi boats for $75. YUM!"}
{"text":"I was surprised they let me order food to dine in, by myself, at 9:40, when they close at 10. I ordered quickly as they urged me to do so because of the kitchen closing, and received my food at 9:59.  At 10:06 I was picking at my food because it was, honestly, unappetizing, because I don't like mushrooms and I don't believe they were advertised so I ordered what seems to be a variation of shrimp fried rice (with mushrooms) in Japanese.  Anyhow, I'm on my phone just texting someone back and the owner, a very stout, angry and unhappy looking Asian woman does a double take at my plate of food and my phone at the table. Completely disregarding the sad fact that I am eating alone tonight, she makes a very ugly face and it seemed like she was trying to imitate a judgmental tone used by the girls in Mean Girls, when she said \"You know we're closing, right ?\" Emphasis on the word \"closing\", with extra nasally undertones.  This upset me deeply because there's a couple right beside me, whom they said nothing to. They arrived at the same time as some. They were very kind to this couple. I spent $22 even though I hated the food and I boxed it up to give away to pigeons on the street, although that would probably be encouraging cannibalism!  They wanted to see me make an effort to eat my food faster instead of making an effort themselves for me to enjoy my food and experience more which is why this place sucks. It might as well be a fast food restaurant the way they expect the turnover to be. It is fast food, under the guise of fine dining. Although there's no way to disguise cold hearted bitch when she runs the place- her disgusting aura emanates throughout this places pores."}
{"text":"I was in the Southside and craving sushi so I used Yelp to find someplace to try.  Little Tokyo has decent reviwes and was close to where I was.  I was surprised at the layout and amount of space in the restaurant.  It has seating at the sushi bar, booth seating along the wall and table seating in the middle section.    The selection of sushi and appetizers was a little smaller than I expected.  I love speciality rolls and they didn't have as many as I thought they would.  I did like that in addition to the descriptions, they had photos of what the rolls looked like to help you make your decision.  I started with the tuna tar tar.  It was a different texture than I expected, but it was tasty.  For the price, I wish the portion size was larger.    I tried the first date roll and the rock and roll.  While I enjoyed both, none were extremely memorable or really unique.  Overall, I got my sushi fix and was satisfied, but it isn't someplace I will rush back to."}
{"text":"I probably should've paid more attention to other reviews and focused more on the sushi. Unfortunately, I was enticed more by the other entrees on the lunch menu and that's what we ended up getting. We got a toriniku udon and a yakiniku dish. Both were not too bad, and along with the small salad that came before them we were pretty satisfied in terms of portion size. The different sauces in both the salad and yakiniku were pretty good, and the taste of sake was actually a bit apparent in the latter one (both could've used a bit less sauce though). The udon came with a lot of chicken and vegetables and the noodles were done pretty well. Overall though, both dishes could have used more depth. The udon didn't feel nearly as hearty as it could have been, while the yakiniku felt a bit boring with some pieces of grilled beef (which were also tasty), some steamed vegetables with sauce slathered on top, and rice.  If I ever return, I would probably just go for the sushi next time."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with friends for dinner. I had the spicy salmon roll and two pieces of salmon sashimi, and miso soup. My friends ordered tuna and California rolls, salad, and miso soup.  The sushi here is fresh, well-proportioned, and delicious. When my office used to be in the South Side, I liked to come here often, and I'm glad to see that the sushi is still every bit as delicious as it was two years ago!   The service is also superb. We were waited on quickly, and the food came in record time, despite the fact they were quite busy. I also really like the warm hand towels they bring out in the beginning.  My only complaint is that it is not open for a few hours each afternoon. If you've got open time in the afternoon for a late lunch (between 2:30 and 5), you need to wait until dinner, which is a bit of a bummer."}
{"text":"Like Sakura, this is another Chinese owned sushi place. Their sushi pieces are usually succulent. Though a tad on the expensive side, they offer a more generous serving size than Sakura, who has a similar pricing. Friendly service.   Little Tokyo also delivers via Campusfood.com (though it requires a $4 delivery charge)."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Pittsburgh! The staff is nice and the ambiance is fitting."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Sushi!!! My girlfriend and I went here Saturday night and ordered 4 specialty rolls, yes they were a little pricey ($12.95-14.95/Roll) but sooooooo amazing and so worth it! We ordered soy paper instead of seaweed and it was awesome! I will def return"}
{"text":"Little Tokyo is my absolute favorite restaurant in the south side! Don and staff are beyond amazing. We feel like family every time we walk in.  The sushi is extremely fresh and delicious.  I highly suggest the Spicy Tuna Tartar and the Dean Roll. Go see Don, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stunningly bad... Not sure what else to say but if you're seeking edible Japanese food run in any direction but this place."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, and I really enjoy the sushi.  Probably the best you'll be able to get in the South Side.  The service is great, the sushi chefs are on the ball, and the atmosphere is friendly and relaxing.  Excellent for dates or business meetings.  If the scallop sashimi is available, i recommend it highly.  I think I've only had beer there, but I seem to remember that there was a bar setup somewhere."}
{"text":"Little Tokyo has become my favorite spot to eat sushi in Pittsburgh. in fact, I've been dining here almost weekly for the past month or two. The sushi is delicious and fresh. The service (which is very important to me) is great. All of the employees (some of whom I believe are owners) are extremely friendly and I never leave without being thanked by nearly every employee. Next time you're in the mood for sushi and on the South Side, skip Nakama and head here."}
{"text":"For a Pittsburgh-based sushi restaurant, I can't help but give Little Tokyo a deserved 5 stars.  The service is always a highlight. The chefs and waitstaff are incredibly friendly, and my wife and I are constantly discussing how we'd rather go there than many other places simply to support a restaurant that prides itself in positive customer service. When you walk in, you feel welcomed, and when you leave, you truly feel that your patronage is appreciated. The chef almost always checks in on your table to make sure you're enjoying your meal, too, which is a great touch.  As for the food, I've never been disappointed. I typically order the simple maki rolls (tuna, salmon, etc.) and they cuts of fish have always been good. Their specialty rolls are delicious, as well, but I typically like my sushi simpler. The one big, yet easily-overlooked thing that I appreciate at Little Tokyo is their approach to their spicy tuna. I can't stand when sushi restaurants shred tuna and make it a gooey mess of spicy mayo. Little Tokyo actually gives you cuts of ahi instead, which is a small, but really nice touch. Like I said earlier, the chef almost always check in on your meal, so while Little Tokyo won't go down as the greatest sushi restaurant ever, it's very clear that the chef(s) take pride in what they do.  I've gone for lunch, dinner, and shortly before they closed for even later dinner. It's never been too busy to get seated and the service and food has always been consistently good.  Is it the best sushi you'll ever eat? Perhaps not, but you're not going to find many, if any, better sushi-eating experiences (especially at this price point) in Pittsburgh at the moment. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love this sushi place--I've tried basically every sushi place in Pittsburgh in Oakland and Squirrel Hill, and this place is definitely the best in the 'burb aside from Chaya in Squirrel Hill. (I have yet to try Penn Fish Market, but I've heard that's amazing as well!)   It is not nearly as expensive as Chaya, but the sashimi is just as delicious and fresh. I personally LOVE the white tuna and yellowtail. :) The nigiri pieces are always served with a little lemon wedge that they cut into a snail shape, which is beyond adorable. The whole ambiance is authentic, from the outside of the restaurant to the inside.  The owner of Little Tokyo Bistro is so sweet. My friend and I love this place so much we went twice in one day, and she actually remembers us now and greet us very warmly everytime we go now :) The chef's sushi bar is right in front, and they are all very friendly. The food takes a while to come, but that is because they prepare everything after you order it, so it's fresh. The waitresses are very sweet as well.  I highly recommend this restaurant. My friend and I always go all the way from CMU to southside just to eat here xD Plus--it's open late!"}
{"text":"I ate there Friday night and here it is less than 2 days later and I am completely inundated with food poisoning -run away from this place do not eat here do not eat here. I had a raw sushi appetizer and raw sushi rolls and they must be contaminated because that's what this is do not eat here."}
{"text":"I stopped in around 5:30 and the place was empty. I was seated right away.  I ordered the spicy tuna roll the Red snapper soup and a seaweed salad. Tuna roll and soup were good. The seaweed salad didn't taste fresh and had an aftertaste like it was old. The sushi person stopped by and asked if everything was ok. I told him it didn't taste fresh and could I get something else after only having a few bites. He said no it's fresh so I asked him to please take it and he asked if I wanted it to go. I politely said no thank you and he walked away with an attitude like I did something wrong lol. Needless to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"Sushi joint run by some nice chinese folks.  The sushi chef was super friendly and seems to know all the regulars.  Service was a bit slow, there was only two chefs and it would take quite a while to get an order in.    I came because they said they had fresh uni that just came in today.    Uni - cheap(er) but IDK if I would order this again.  It was heavier and creamier than usual and the flavor   Sake (Salmon) - Great! Got two orders. Your typical expected salmon at a neighborhood sushi joint.    Hotate (scallop) - Great! Not a large piece but based on price, pretty worth.  This is usually an MP item because it's imported from Hokkaido, so non-MP means it's somewhere local.  Usually the local ones are tasteless and/or have a horrible texture (I've been scarred) but this was very nice.   Unagi (eel) - Winner! Thanks for making it warm.  The tail end of my unagi had a small crisp.  Fan of their sushi rice and rice-fish ratio.  Well-seasoned and stays put when you pick up the sushi.  Not of fan of over the counter conversation even if in Chinese about their employee(?).  I really like quiet sushi joints.  If there is talking it should be between me and the chef.  :)  Also, I like taking two bites of all my nigris but the nori was obviously not crisp-fresh so I couldn't bite it in two.    And they have these comfy but wheely chairs at the sushi bar.  I didn't realize it had wheels and almost topples over trying to reach the soy sauce at the end of the bar.  I'd go back to try a roll."}
{"text":"I went here with my friend last night to try something new. Walking into the restaruant the decor was really adorable and I liked the two person booths they have. The service was fairly quick I ordered gyoza to start off with. My friend got the chicken hibachi it came with miso soup and a ginger salad. I ordered sushi I got the rock n roll and the shrimp tempura with avocado roll. They were so good I finished both of them and my app! I almost always have leftovers too. My friend didnt really like the dressing on her salad she said it was too tart but other than that the food was really good I will be back to try more sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Love the sushi here. Very welcoming when I arrived and sat me at a booth. The atmosphere is very relaxing and comfortable. They give you a warm damp cloth to clean your hands. So awesome. I ordered two rolls and miso soup. The Philly roll and shrimp tempura roll were excellent and they were large pieces.  The sushi chef walked around to all the customers at one point to make sure they were enjoying there meal. He was so nice and it is always nice to meet the person making your food. The price for all the delicious food was very acceptable. I had two sushi rolls and soup for $15. That is pretty much unheard of, especially for the high quality of food they serve. Delicious...I will defiantly be back for dinner again soon."}
{"text":"It was not as impressive as the first time I was here. Maybe a different sushi chef now?"}
{"text":"Wow, I don't review many places but this was so good I just had to tell everyone!  I got a salmon roll and a philly roll tonight (a tuesday) for carryout. First of all the atmosphere was nice and the lady who rang me up was super nice. But okay listen, the raw salmon was literally the freshest most high-quality salmon I've had in my ENTIRE LIFE. And I've tried a whole lot of sushi places with this order.  It was so incredibly fresh and delicious I just can't even. Also unlike other places, both rolls were a great size, huge chunks of salmon and perfect amount of rice and everything else, it was just the most ideal serving of these two rolls that I've ever had. EVER. Total was $11.71 and as poor as I am, it was totally worth every penny. Wish I'd gotten more tbh.  This was my first time here so I can only vouch for the sushi, but I'm looking forward to trying other rolls and seriously I can't emphasize how amazingly good it is. Wow wow wow. Wow."}
{"text":"This is literally the best sushi in Pittsburgh hands down. Better than Nakama for sure. The First Date roll is my absolute favorite.   Tip for the owners: add descriptions to the rolls that aren't so obvious. I wouldn't have tried the First Date roll if it wasn't suggested by a friend and I can't imagine not ordering it every time I order."}
{"text":"Pretty standard hibachi fare. However they're consistent, good quality and offer takeout (don't ask me why so many restaurants in the city do not). I usually get the shrimp hibachi meal which comes with about 10-12 medium size shrimp, hibachi rice (small portion), grilled mushrooms and mixed vegetables. It's enjoyable but won't blow you away."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for some good priced sushi. The service was good and the fact I wasn't sitting crowded with other people sitting right next to me was a plus. If you are coming here to save a buck and have a chill environment this is your place. Not a place where you need to all decked out for just come good food and Japanese beer."}
{"text":"The best sushi in the city! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise! Staff is super friendly (Bing is awesome!), and the quality of fish/food is top notch!"}
{"text":"I used to go here when I hung around the Southside on a regular basis (sadly, now I'm starting to feel old down there and general vibe annoys me). The sushi is great - as good as you can get in Pittsburgh, in my opinion. Sometimes I dream about that Hawaii roll. They also have a sister (or parent, whichever) restaurant in Mt. Lebanon, Little Tokyo... just as good, and more of a restaurant feel than this location which is a bit basement-esque."}
{"text":"So the main sushi chef & his apprentice are totally delightful. They smile & are hospitable. Sit st the sushi bar when you come & relax after a hard day at work. Waitress recommended king salmon which was great (albeit slightly pricy). Also great was Yellowtail & Ikura. Chef threw in a complimentary tuna which was good (for being out of season) but not great. Locals come here to relax the later part of the evening - which tells me that they build relationships with their regulars. So this place is good to have dinner with friends but still try to sit at sushi bar."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!   Cheery hosts and an a very efficient server.  Sushi chefs greeted the hell out of us. Haha.   Interior tries to go for a trendy look, but doesn't quite achieve it... which is something I actually found endearing, somehow..   The sushi was very tasty and fresh, but took a very long time to come out--but I think that was due to one table that ordered four trays worth of sushi (eek!) right before us. We ordered a few pieces of nigiri (VERY generous cuts) and a couple of rolls that weren't drowning in sauce, but were well balanced with the amount of rice-to-fish.   We shared a chicken-katsu entree, which was a solid dish... just kind of pricey for what it is.. We also ordered a squid appetizer (ika yaki) but it ended up being painfully salty. Eek!   I would give this place FOUR stars for the sushi, but the other dishes were kind of meh. Will DEFINITELY be here in the future for sushiiiiiii. yum yum."}
{"text":"The sushis were nice. I especially liked the Dragon Roll from the 8 sushis we tried here. We tried the Dean's, Dragon, Veggie, Rock and Roll, twister, American Dream and two others. I could say the dragon and rock and roll were among my most favorite ones but the veggies was probably the least favorite."}
{"text":"Sushi with great mouthfeel, well-executed rice, but not a ton of flavor.  I ordered the Sushi deluxe meal, which comes with 10 pieces of nigiri (fish on top of rice, which is the only sushi in Japan.) This comes with miso soup and the common sesame ginger salad. The miso soup was flat in flavor and the salad was OK. A bit too much sweetness/acidity from the dressing.  The sushi selection was predictable. Tuna, salmon, snapper, and bbq eel. The fish was very creamy in mouthfeel (excellent) but none of them impressed me in flavor except the bbq eel, which was smoky and sweet. Rice was of good execution."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, my favorite sushi place in pittsburgh. I have enjoyed every dish I've tried here. The sushi rolls have a good amount of fish, unlike some places that put such thin slices on their rolls. Everything is fresh and served with a smile. I highly recommend the Fatty salmon sushi. Yum! We love to come here for a great meal and a glass of red wine. We've tried other places around pittsburgh, but they just leave us craving Little Tokyo Bistro."}
{"text":"I popped into Little Tokyo Bistro on a whim when a craving for sushi hit just a few days after moving in a few blocks away. What a surprise that it turned out to be quite tasty and reasonably priced to boot! There is plenty of seating and some cool lights illuminating the walls. The fish was very fresh and the portions were generous. I absolutely loved the Dean Roll, which was a low carb option (spicy tuna with avocado and soy paper). I must warn you that unlike many places, Little Tokyo's spicy tuna has a definite kick to it! I was disappointed that their white tuna is albacore (the same variety you get in a can at the store), not escolar (my favorite cut of sashimi that is melt in your mouth goodness). Presentation/execution of the food and service were both good and everyone at my table (party of 4) was happy with their selections. My only real complaint is that when I left, my clothes and hair smelled very 'greasy', from the strong cooking smells coming from the woks in the kitchen. I will definitely make Little Tokyo a regular stop in my neighborhood eatery rotation."}
{"text":"This place rocks. California roll, eel roll, Pittsburgh roll & edamame. All wonderful. The waitress was a sweetheart and was so nice. Inexpensive too."}
{"text":"11/2015 - I am cheap when it comes to sushi, and for several years got my fix with Giant Eagle Market District sushi, but they changed vendors and I was so disappointed in them that I FINALLY caved and got some sushi at a real restaurant. It also gave me a chance to indulge my craving for ikura (big, luscious, salty salmon roe/eggs), which the grocery stores just don't have.   I got lunch here last week and got my ikura and tamago sushi fix. I was not thrilled with the pork tonkatsu... I thought the pork was very dry... but the sushi was yummy. And that's why I went back last night for take-out to sate my ikura jones. I also picked up a Maki Supreme dinner with three rolls: Rainbow Roll, Dragon Roll and Rock 'n Roll. OMG - they were all awesome! Seriously, five-plus stars! Sushi is a luxury indulgence for me. I hope I have not just become addicted, or I'll go broke. I cannot recommend Little Tokyo Bistro on the Southside enough. PS - the staff is very nice, and if eating in, the restaurant is lovely!  07/2016 - I have been ordering for pick-up here almost weekly for the last few months. The same thing every time, so I call up, they look me up by phone number, and say 'same order?'', and I say 'yup'. I'm so addicted. Trying to make sure I don't order more than once a week because I'd like to retire some day...  The staff is lovely, too!"}
{"text":"Little Tokoyo kicks Nakama's ASS.  not that that's any real feat.  i'm just sayin'.. as far as southisde sushi options go, choose this place hands down.  No, I absolutely love their spicy tuna.  I love it as the spicy tuna tartar appetizer, i love it as maki, i love it as a handroll.  &lt;3  Very pleasant staff as well."}
{"text":"Best place to get sushi in Pittsburgh. The service is exceptional, the prices are low, the atmosphere is calming. This is my favorite place in the South Side to get away from the madness and create some madness of my own- with Saki, of course!   I like simple sushi- tuna, avocado, and salmon rolls do for me. I also love getting their ginger salad- it's an excellent way to start a meal. The flavors here are better than anywhere else in Pittsburgh. I'm not sure who their supplier is but they've forged a great connection. Try the mochi for dessert- it's an excellent treat. I've had the hibachi which was also excellent- but I still recommend sushi since it's the best you can get in the city.   I have to make a special note about the exceptional service. Even before the people here got to know us, the servers were friendly and attentive. The chef would always say hello and the lady at the front counter is especially kind. I've never had a bad experience and I've been here at least 15 times.   It's a wonderful gem- have a visit and enjoy some sushi!"}
{"text":"Totally in love with this place. The sushi is perfect every time. Quiet, intimate setting and the staff is always above and beyond friendly"}
{"text":"Seated upon entrance on a Saturday around 7ish. CasuaGreat Service. I had hibachi lobster (good portion)  and hubby had an assortment of sushi. Excellent! Will def be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. As you walk to you seat, the sushi chefs greet you and make you feel immediately welcomed. The business is clean and modern, and the staff is very friendly. The sushi always tastes fresh, and I like that you can see the chefs making it right there. I've never ordered anything but sushi, though, so I can't vouch for other dishes. I never go anywhere else for sushi!"}
{"text":"Yelp, I can always count on you!  As I will probably continue to note ad nauseum, I am looking for good sushi since moving to Pittsburgh.  I think I may have found another contender!    First of all, the service is spectacular.  The staff is attentive and so kind.  Everyone seems genuinely interested in providing a positive experience.  Secondly, they have a full bar.  This means a lot, since most BYOBs in the 'Burgh charge a corking fee (WTF?).  I was able to order a small house sake for $5 and it paired so nicely with my meal.  We started with the gyoza, which was fried crispy (I'm used to pan fried).  Good, but a bit greasier than what I'm used to since it was deep fried.  I went for one of the sushi dinners, which included miso soup and salad.  The miso was yummy!   Perfectly seasoned and not burn your face off hot.  The sushi was really great. Huge pieces of fish when it comes to the nigiri and my roll was quite tasty.   I think most people wouldn't expect a good experience like this on Carson, but the ambiance was nice too.  I saw a couple having a delightful date in front of me, while I had a girl's night with a friend.  Did I mention that the price was right?!    In short, my favorite  find so far.  I'd love to see more specialty rolls on their menu, but they do SUCH a great job with what they've got.  I'm a happy camper!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi on the southside.  I had been to the Mt. Lebanon location before but it was just a fluke that we ended up at this particular sushi restaurant.  My friend and I were driving by and just happened to be hungry and thought \"sushi.\"  She ate all kinds of traditional stuff and I just stuck to shrimp tempura and avocado roll.  Though I ate about three and was really full and got a stomach ache.  But that's okay cuz then I got to go home and lie down!  plus they pour a mean stiff  drink here.  Was a very fun night.  Was nice to treat a friend who was down on her luck - even though I no longer call this person a friend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been eating here for years. The sushi is amazing. Super fresh and reasonably priced. The staff is so friendly accommodating. We love to stop here for lunch when we're in south side."}
{"text":"Love the Hawaiian & spicy tuna roll!! The 1st time I tried this place I was craving for more... Delicious!! The people there are friendly & happy to help.  Let's just say they got that \"crack sushi\" keep you coming back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  I'm one of those sushi people that doesn't stray too far from the avocado roll. Yet sitting with the adventurous group that I was, I went full fish ahead and tried many...all beautiful, all delicious. The waitress, who was helpful and patient, assisted us in making a giant platter that at the end had not not one piece of rice remaining.   Next time we will sit in front of the sushi chef at the \"bar\". He checked on our meal and then sent over four more pieces of the coolest looking sushi ever!"}
{"text":"This place has been my go to for several years. just realized as I was sitting here for dinner that I've never written them a review. Spicy tuna tartare is my favorite appetizer of all time. seriously. just a large mound of perfect tuna. The owners are so welcoming and accommodating and friendly. Definitely go here ... you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Little Tokyo Bistro is my favorite Sushi option in Pittsburgh! And there are not too many. But they do it right.  I usually order the simple stuff - Spicy Tuna, Salmon, or Avocado rolls. They have a Sushi bar where you can see how the sushi is prepared, and you can watch the skillful chefs doing their work. Everything I ordered so far was super fresh and tasted great, and the service is always fast, very attentive, and friendly.  Many locals stop by for takeout which is a good sign. The restaurant also has lots of seating available, or you can choose to sit at the Sushi bar. Parking is not hard to find in any of the side streets of East Carson.   Prices are okay (you can get away with $15 pp) and overall the value is good. I'm a regular now!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in Pittsburgh. I have been to every sushi restaurant in Pittsburgh, including Umi, and I feel comfortable putting Little Tokyo at the top. Okay, real talk:  this is gonna get gushy. I love this place.  Not gonna lie, the outside of the store looks straight up sketchy. It's on East Carson in South Side and is surrounded by a less-than-nice area. The exterior is lit with cheesy neon signs and a fake, Chinese-looking set of doors.  But their service is really friendly and their sashimi is completely fresh. The sashimi test is pretty simple: if it tastes buttery, crisp and melts in your mouth, it's the real deal. If it has any kind of fishy, salty or ocean-y odor or taste, chances are it's been sitting out for a while or hasn't been kept cold enough.    If you're a sushi person chances are you've ordered rolls with crab in them before. Surprise: most of the time it isn't real crab. Little Tokyo, on the other hand, puts real crab in their rolls.... for like... half the price of anywhere else.   In fact, all of the rolls are priced ridiculously cheaply (under 13 dollars, even for stuff like dragon rolls and scallop rolls). How do they do this? Illegal fish smuggling operation? Child labor factory of sushi chefs? Honestly, I don't care, it tastes awesome."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for some sushi takeout today to take to a friend's surprise birthday dinner. The hostess was soooo super nice and very friendly to me and my friend while we were waiting for our food. All the staff were super pleasant and even the sushi chefs were talking to us as we were waiting. I really wish we could've sat down and eaten our meal there but we had a celebration to get to! The sushi tasted super fresh and was super delicious. I will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"All in all, this is a pretty good spot. Everyone that works there is very friendly - even the sushi chefs greet you will huge smiles when you walk in. Other than that, I don't have much to say. The place didn't wow me but it didn't disappoint me either."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, because I have fond memories of its sister restaurant in Mt. Lebo.  No such luck, I went there last night for the first time.  It's located on E. Carson St., which is good because the s. side needs more sushi options than nakama.  The first thing that struck me was when we walked in there was a \"boom box\" blasting mid 80's love songs.  You know, Journey, Pat Benatar and the like.  We walked in and were greeted by a friendly host who sat us at a nice table in the corner.  It was crowded which is normally a good sign.  The service was prompt for the drinks.  We got a bottle of reasonablypriced chardonnay.  It took forever for our sushi, which was disappointing.  The warm towels are also a nice touch.  I really didn't care for my sashimi overall.  The way it was sliced was very unattractive to me.  It was big hunks of fish that didn't look all that appetizing the way it was presented.  The salmon was good once I cut the pieces into smaller bits.  It was fresh for sure.  The albacore tuna had a weird color to it and while it tasted okay again the way it was cut was unappetizing.  I also tried the conch, which was okay but probably not the best thing to order sashimi style, better in a ceviche I'd guess. My friend she ordered the rolls.  I'm not a big roll guy, but I tried a few.  The Philly roll was pretty good and reasonably priced, but I'll pass on the cream cheese with my sushi if it's up to me.  The lobster roll wasn't that good.  The lobster had too much mayo and we barely touched it.  The softshell crab rolls were okay, but I only tried a little.  Again, I'm not the best to judge rolls because overall I don't care for them.  My friend said she didn't think much of them and she has tried many \"sushi\" rolls in her time.  The prices were okay, but maybe a bit high.  The atmosphere kind of sucked again with the blaring 80's music.  I probably won't go back again, too many other options."}
{"text":"Salmon was super fishy, soba sauce too vinegary, rice was not properly cooked.  Miso soup was decent.  Then came the rice...which had a cooked spider inside.  That's right--not a spider roll.  A real spider.  Like, that 8-legged creature.  Walking around my rice.  Eat at your own risk here."}
{"text":"Sushi was good! The shrimp tempura in the rolls were crispy! Service was great and friendly!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Little Tokyo Bistro never disappoints.  Exquisite flavors and fresh ingredients with friendly service- one of my favorite restaurants in the Southside.  Highly recommend the first date roll- crispy and delicious."}
{"text":"If I could give a half star, I would.  3.5 seems right for this place.   Service was good, and prices were pretty comparable to the Mt. Lebanon location.  Some menu items differed, and there were two new rolls for us that we tried and liked.  However, in general, it wasn't as good.  I was excited to potentially get my expected quality and flavors at Little Tokyo Bistro, but I was somewhat left wanting.  The shrimp tempura was mostly batter, and was overdone.  Unfortunately, most of my choices had shrimp tempura inside the rolls, so I got that over cooked batter across the board.  Also, the pieces of sushi themselves were too big.  We had to cut them in half to get them to fit in our mouths without spewing it out onto the table as we chewed, and at that point, why bother?  It's sushi -- you're not supposed to have to cut it in half.  The salad was just ok.  Dressing was super similar, but not the same; and the lettuce and veggies may not have been super fresh.   The restaurant is cute, and clean.  Everyone was very nice, and the sushi chefs thanked us for dining with them.  It's just unfortunate that it wasn't amazing.  It was just good.  Wouldn't travel all the way to the South Side just for that."}
{"text":"This place is great and has been for years. It's just about the only place in Pittsburgh where I'm excited about getting Japanese food. Being landlocked and all (and practically the midwest), Japanese, especially sushi, is not so good here. If you are reading this while visiting from a coastal area WAIT TILL YOU GET HOME TO ORDER FRESH RAW FISH! Nothing in Pittsburgh will compare to what you're used to, but if you really, truly have to get some while you're visiting - come HERE. Also, beyond the sushi their food is great! The soups are downright fantastic! Plus everyone is really nice, and the sushi chefs are great :) I'm sad that they have to deal with landlocked fish shipping, but their handywork is awesome."}
{"text":"I love sushi so after reading lots of positive reviews i was happy to see good prices and enjoy good service. I just wish you had more apps like small tempura options."}
