{"text":"Looks like they went out of business. My family and I went by on 8/23/11 and they had a confusing sign indicating that they were done. This goes along with reviews I saw on other sites saying that the owner was talking to customers about money problems. This is a bummer because it didn't seem that there are any other restaurants in the area."}

{"text":"Listen, there isn't much to choose from in Monroe, those that live here know this already.  That being said, if you are looking for a nice, quiet and romantic dinner locale, Mucci's really fits the bill.  The location is in the heart of downtown Monroe (all be it very small).  I've dined here several times and the service and food have always been great.  The menu is a traditionally Italian one and most items are made from scratch, just like it should be!  I personally would recommend the stuffed mushroom appetizer, it's stupendous!   Another nice touch is the owner is directly involved in all operations and is at the restaurant most every day.  A friendly, down to earth atmosphere really sets this place apart from the typical chain restaurants that can be found in the area."}
