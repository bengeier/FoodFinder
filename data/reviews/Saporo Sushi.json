{"text":"This place is a joke.  When we walked in and were seated we waited patiently for the watiress to acknowledge us or at least make eye contact....never happened.  There was ONE other table in there and she took their drink order, brought the drinks out, took their food order (which took forever) brought their food order back and then was in the kitchen for about 3 minutes, came back out and had empty plates and soy sauce dishes for this same table.  Meanwhile she didnt even LOOK at us.  All it would have taken was for her to say, \"Ill be right with you\".  This was completely ignorant and inexcusable.  I am a waitress myself and will tolerate quite a bit without getting crappy about it....this girl was a total moron.  The hostess too.  She sat on her fat ass and didnt do anything.  We ended up walking out after around 10 minutes of sitting.  If this had been a busy afternoon it would have been one thing.  This was at 3pm and it was dead.  I will never attempt to go back there ever again."}
{"text":"The former waitress is no longer there - hallelujah. The decor is much nicer and there are new sushi chefs as well as new special rolls!

I love this place. The service has definitely gotten much, much better."}
{"text":"I've been to Sapporo's several times and I've always found it to be mediocre.  On my most recent visit my spider roll was bland and warm, the baby tako was very rubbery.  The quality of sushi there just doesn't seem to compare to Sumo or I Love Sushi.  I won't be returning, other sushi places in the area are better.  Our waiter did his best to help us but the other wait staff interfered and one of our rolls were forgotten."}
{"text":"After a nice photoshoot with Anna where we shot out on the dry lakebed in Jean (thanks Eric!) and then at the famous Vegas sign, we headed over to her favorite place for low key sushi - Sapporo Sushi.  

I had a hand roll she suggested and sake and shiro maguro nigiri.  Those last two are my common compare-basics-to-know-how-good-a-sushi-place-is options.

I have to say that the portions were great and the freshness was solid.  Nothing outrageous, but then the prices justify it easily.  Solidly fresh fish here and quick service.  

Our waitress was a bit uncaring, but hey the food was good, reasonably priced, and in a nice non-Vegas-y location."}
{"text":"I have been here many times...and the table service has always sucked. Its kinda something you expect when you come here. Like that one friend that you still go out with even thought they always do something stupid. What I would suggest when you go there is try to sit at the sushi bar, but even then it can be really slow. Even if you are the only ones there. Or it just opened.Or pretty much for any reason..you are going to wait. But when you get it, it's delicious and you don't care anymore, and you go back. and bring people. and then go online and yelp about it. yum, What I get is now all I get, I know I should try to get other stuff..but these are just so good: 
the no name handroll, the stacie cut roll (get 2 even),the moon roll, and the green mussels and a side of ponzu with it all. Dayum."}
{"text":"only been there once and have no complaints.
im not a huge fan of sushi, but actually tried a variety of things at this one and LIKED them. 

the service was SUPER good. The lady that served us talked like she knew us for years. we were also there till closing and the rest of the staff started conversations and joked around as well. very easy going there. which is a big plus.

its a little tiny cute place tucked in the corner.
their prices arent bad at all.

stacie roll, YUM."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi place in town, at the moment. The fish is incredibly fresh, and the rolls are inventive, but don't overpower the flavour of the fish. The place itself is really laid back, looks like a dive from the outside, but clean and friendly on the inside. Always busy, which is a good sign."}
