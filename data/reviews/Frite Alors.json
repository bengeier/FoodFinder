{"text":"Frite alors! c'est la brasserie/friterie belge typique revisitée pour les Québecquois (comprendre \"avec poutine\"). Comme d'habitude, j'étais un peu sceptique. Les frites, ça doit pouvoir se déguster sans sauce et juste briller par sa qualité en standalone. Après, ça m'empêche pas d'apprécier des sauces, mais toujours dans un petit pot à côté pour pouvoir alterner entre avec et sans sauce. Et puis, du fromage sur des frites? wtf.  Mais j'ai essayé une poutine avec champignons, oignons et boeuf et j'ai changé d'avis. La poutine est, en fait, une idée génial. Le problème c'est qu'elle peut servir à cacher un manque de qualité du produit (les frites par exemple) en la \"noyant\" sous une masse de trucs. Mais, à Frite alors!, chaque partie de la poutine et la poutine en son ensemble étaient de qualité.  Un excellent souvenir de Montréal."}
{"text":"Took a group of teenagers here for lunch and it was a great choice. Lots of good options on the menu. I have a good appetite and the regular sized poutine was quite filling. The service was satisfactory. The food was delicious. If you are downtown looking for poutine, you won't be disappointed to come here."}
{"text":"nice ambiance and the waiters are nice and their \"small\" poutine is pretty big the prices are good for the area"}
{"text":"I recently (regrettably) visited this Frite Alors,  My partner and I thought it would be a good choice since the menu had a few vegetarian options and I'm vegetarian.  I ordered the Croque Vegetarian with fries; it seemed like a good choice - until the sandwich came and there was a chunk of ground beef in it.  Fine for meat-eaters; not fine for vegetarians.    We alerted our waitress to this fact; she told us it must have have been an accident, but offered no apology, no concern, or no new sandwich.  Further, she told us that the fries aren't even vegetarian because they're cooked in beef fat.    We then told her it would be a good idea to tell customers who order a vegetarian meal that the fries are not in fact vegetarian, since it's not mentioned anywhere on the menu.  She told us that she eats meat, but sometimes orders the vegetarian sandwich because she 'likes avocados', so there's no need to tell customers about the fries.  Additionally, she told us the restaurant specializes in Belgian style fries, suggesting everyone must already know the fries are cooked in beef fat.  Perhaps they know in Belgium - but we're in Quebec.  It's not uncommon to assume that fries are cooked in vegetable oil.  Some things this restaurant should note:   If you have vegetarian items on your menu, your servers probably should NOT assume the customer ordered it because he 'eats meat but likes vegetables'.    If you have vegetarian items on your menu, your servers probably SHOULD assume vegetarians will order it.   If you have vegetarian options on your menu, you should consider indicating that the fries are not in fact vegetarian.    Not all vegetarians are vegetarian by choice."}
{"text":"I ordered the take out poutine with bacon and onion. Took about 5 mins from the order. Taste great."}
{"text":"Les meilleurs frites de Montréal, un restaurant vraiment sympa...  Plus cher qu'un Fast food, mais très abordable et d'une qualité excellente...    Espère vraiment que cette franchise débarque un jour à Paris"}
{"text":"Very important information for vegetarians: their fries are cooked using beef grease.  The waiter told me that they were vegetarian friendly, which is obviously false. I'm quite disappointed in the service and lack of knowledge."}
{"text":"Every trip to Montreal requires a trek to Frites Alors (or any poutinerie) in my books. Who knew there were so many different types of poutine? Not the adventurous kind, I usually get the classic poutine with gravy and cheesecurds. What's nice about this place is that the cheesecurds are actually fresh, and curds- unlike other places that just sprinkle pre-packaged shredded Kraft cheese. The portions are huge (I definitely recommend sharing) and the prices are reasonable. The place is laid-back and very casual with a French charm that keeps me coming back form more."}
{"text":"With a great atmosphere and located on the busy Sainte-Catherine, this place is definitely worth trying. Their burgers are yummy and they have a decent vegetarian selection available. But, their basic poutine was lack-luster.   The vibe of the place is nice and they have a decent amount of outdoor seating considering their location and pricing. The staff was friendly enough, but our waiter was (understandably) a little pushy about his tip.   My favorite thing about this place is their beer selection. They had plenty of options to choose from. We visited during the Jazz Festival (sponsored heavily by Heineken) and as close as Frite Alors was from the Jazz Festival it was worth a short walk to drink something other than Heineken. Not to mention how reasonably priced their beer is."}
{"text":"Came for my poutine craving and was relatively satisfied - won't be the best Montreal poutine but nothing much can go wrong with fries, gravy, and cheesecurds. I would go for the classic next time instead of the shredded chicken I got alongside. Love the fact that they advertise their local sourcing of chicken and pork, and Canadian beef. Love their fries and mayo concept - I imagine this to be the type of fast food served in Belgium. This would be a place I could casually pick up some fries at as a snack, and I don't do that often.  It's interesting that they only serve Pepsi products. A ginger ale comes in a Schweppes can. It might not sound like I'm happy about that but I actually prefer Schweppes."}
{"text":"If your looking for the unusual, this used to be the place. It's a casual restaurant featuring Belgic style cuisine. The food isn't spectacular but what I appreciated was the unusual items that sadly aren't available anymore such as Horse meat tartare and Reindeer burger.  The Horse meat was actually palatable and the reindeer burger was bland but still an experience. They also have a lobster poutine that was more poutine than lobster, but then again its rare to find a place that is generous with lobster.   L. John Dory Twitter: @LJohnDory"}
{"text":"I came all the way to the restaurant because of the good comments on Yelp, but found their Poutine a completely overrated overpriced dish.   I ordered a Poutine with pulled pork on top, it costs me almost 14 dollars. The size is not even large. I would only pay 7 dollars for this."}
{"text":"Excellent accueil et très bonne frites !je vous conseille en hamburger le boucanier avec une petite sauce maison Américaine"}
{"text":"This was my first expirience with poutine, but it tasted like it could have been from a fast food place.  The ingredients did not taste fresh."}
{"text":"Les frites sont bonnes. Un choix varié de sauces. Lea burger sont servis dans un pain ciabata.  Il a meilleur dans cette rue pleine de vie."}
{"text":"Delicious! I've tried their lobster poutine, pork with grilled onions poutine, and some others I can't recall. The sauces that are extra offer a lot of variety and the large size poutine is enough to completely fill up your stomach. The wait can be a bit long after ordering, but this place has an outdoor terrace which is enjoyable with friends. 4/5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Poutines et frites plutôt moyennes, burgers très réussies. Pour les prix, qui sont assez bas, je suis satisfait.  Bon point pour la musique !"}
{"text":"C'est super cool! Pomme Frites, mmmmmmm!!!! D'accord, au revoir!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now. Burgers are very good and fries excellent. The variety of sauces offered makes for a different experience each time.   The service is quick and staff effecient and polite.   I will be back again."}
{"text":"Manque de propreté,  ils ont une infestation de grosses mouches à fruits en ce moment il y en avait partout. La bouffe est très ordinaire pour le prix. J'y suis allé deux fois, j'ai essayé un burger, le hot dog et les frites.  Les frites sont bonnes mais sinon le burger était sec et j'aime mieux un hot dog de cantine que leur hot dog. Leur mayonnaises maisons sont bof,  j'en ai essayé trois sortes à date et sérieusement on peut en faire des meilleures à la maison avec zéro effort. Service correct sans plus, pas de refill d'eau. Je n'y retournerai pas."}
{"text":"Un restau belge à Montréal? Une réussite! L'ambiance BD est sympa, les frites vraiment délicieuses, une très bonne adresse pour un repas sans chichis et pas cher"}
{"text":"Great service and great food... We had a traditional poutine that was awesome. The staff was nice and attentive..."}
{"text":"Alors - L'atmosphere, la service, et la nourriture  Atmosphere: Frite Alors is a franchise.  Curiously however, it does not suffer from the blandness that other chain restaurants often exhibit.  Frite Alors restaurants are all unique and do not conform to some standardized image / layout.  The Firte Alors on St. Denis is especially endearing.  Although St. Denis is more or less known to be heavily trafficked by tourists - especially the portion between De Maisonneuve and St. Catherine's Streets - the Quartier Latin still retains many of its charms and individualities.  The Firte Alors here has certainly been affected as much.  The place is spacious - and although attempts to stay true to the theme of Tin Tin (long before the 2011 movie), the place can come off as being eclectic and unpredictable - and this is what give it its charm.  The entrance is stocked with flyers and brochures advertising various artistic events and musical performances (professional or otherwise) , and the crowd is equally trendy, young, and diverse.  First time visitors will find that this is a neat place to run into ideas as to what to do next in Montreal.  Service: Since Frite Alors is really suppose to be a fast-food burger joint - the staff is entirely comprised of young people. St. Denis, being on the east side of the Main (St. Laurent Street) the staff is mostly French speaking - but they are incredibly accommodating and willing to speak as much English as they can.  Overall - nice bunch.  Food: The burgers at Frite Alors are simply fabulous.  They come in a straw tray and are quite generous in their proportions.  These burgers also come with Frite Alors' famous fries and a choice of dipping mustard.  In fact, burgers aside, Frite Alors is often fun to visit simply for the fries!  Prices are reasonable, and this makes the place a definite bargain.  Put it on your to do list!"}
{"text":"Over the years I have popped in from time to time. On my most recent trip I noticed signs of  MBA crackdown and small-sizing. The prices had jumped up again, which gave me pause.   The fun Tintin references and drawings have been excised in favour of some middling grunge-esque counter-culture. The burgers seemed smaller.   There are TVs in the dining area, in case you don't have one at home, or you miss your TV after thirty minutes away from it.  EDIT: Since this review, I came back around around 9 pm to get a chicken burger to go. The goth taking my order and working the till said one word to me. I usually tip but my patience was tested this time.  As for the chicken, it was quite tiny indeed. I think I will save up my money or just go to Belle Province across the street, where there is less attitude and it is less expensive."}
{"text":"As far as chains go, your best bet for poutine and burgers. This place makes a solid trad poutine, and has a much more sober take on stunt poutine (the pulled pork poutine is quite good). Their burgers and house dressings are delicious as well. Friendly staff, good ambiance, though a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Boulevard St. Laurent is my favorite strip for boutique shopping as well as trendy bars and restaurants. If you're here during the day and you need a break, Frites Alors makes a great stop for poutine or belgian fries and your choice of sauce.  They have burgers and sandwiches if you're in need of something more substantial."}
{"text":"Service toujours un peu long, mais j'y retourne pour la poutine au porc effiloché. Les frites sont bonnes, surtout avec une de leurs fameuses sauces!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend & I really enjoyed this place. Good burgers & heart-killing Poutine with a good stock of beer ! The staff were friendly, nice & came by often."}
{"text":"My favourite Poutine. I literally came here twice the same weekend!  I'm from Montreal originally and this is my go-to for Poutine."}
{"text":"I ordered poutine  from the special of the day! It was described steak but  i got minced meet! The guy said its miss translation from french and didnt offer anything!!  When the bill came it was not the same price and he said oh its the lunch special ! Not all day special.  The server was nice but i didnt appreciate the \"miss translation and the extra price ! \""}
{"text":"We came here to grab a bite to eat for a late lunch. The restaurant was mostly empty when we arrived and we grabbed a seat at the bar. The waitress was extremely nice and provided us with an english menu. We split a large order of poutine. It was more than enough for us to split. There was plenty of cheese and gravy on the fries, but it didn't blow me away. I probably would try some place else before returning to this place."}
{"text":"As European tourists, we went here to try Poutine and it was great. It's a nice location on busy St Denis and in summer the walls to the street are open. Service was very nice and really quick. The food was also really fast.  We shared a large Poutine and a green salad between two, which was enough.  I liked their selection of beers since I am from Cologne and they sell a cologne style beer."}
{"text":"Fast food vraiment succulent. Les poutines et les frites sont définitivement leur spécialités. Il y a une dizaine de sauces différentes que nous pouvons essayer avec nos frites, c'est vraiment génial. Il y a aussi des possibilités végé.  Le décor est vraiment beau et branché. (Un des plus beau Frite Alors à mon avis).    Il n'y a jamais d'attente et la nourriture est toujours impeccable."}
{"text":"This place was nice had a sandwich that was really good and the fries were amazing !!! People working there were nice and informative they were helpful will come back for sure"}
{"text":"When the \"other\" poutine restaurant that we had orginally booked for called at the last minute to say that had to close for an emergency, Michel and his wonderful crew accommodated all 25 of my students and me with just an hour's notice. Although the food was slow because of an unexpected lunch rush (methinks the potential customers from the \"other\" poutine resto came here instead, like us!), the staff were clearly working their butts off. My elk burger and salad was perfect, and my students all loved their poutine experience. Not everyone wanted to eat poutine, and this place was great for its diverse menu of more-than-just-poutine. I was very impressed with the customer service here and would recommend it as a great place to bring large groups and international travellers. Note that they don't accept Mastercard."}
{"text":"Big portion, definitely for 2 people. Had the steak (minced meat) poutine, well I think it was good, can't compare since it was my first poutine ! I think it cost around 8 or 9 ? Not sure. Service was good, place could be a bit cleaner but was okay. I'd definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Crappy food and crappy service.  I got one of the burgers on my trip to Montreal.  I don't remember which one exactly because it wasn't exactly memorable.  The patty was so overcooked, it was dry and hard.  It's one of the worst burgers I've had in a while.  I also had the poutine, which was okay.  Not the best I had in town, but nothing spectacular either.  As for the service, and thus the 1 star rating.  They were not packed at all when I ate there (Thursday night), but the servers were not attentive at all.  It took 15 minutes to flag one of the wait staff down to take our orders initially.  After that, they never returned to refill our water, or ask if we needed anything.  I had to hunt another wait staff down for a bottle of ketchup (cause the burger really needed it).  And when the meal was done, I ask to break some change for tips, and I guess she didn't want to do so cause she felt she deserved the entire bill instead, so she left me to sit there waiting.  I could've left nothing, but I felt bad, so I Ieft whatever change that was in my pocket.    Folks should move right pass this place and eat at one other places on this road."}
{"text":"Frites Alors offers a delicious and overwhelming gorge fest in a bright cartoony setting. It's a fantastic place to stop while shopping on St. Laurent, but it may slow you down for shopping afterwards due to all the waddling. They have a tasty array of poutine, without getting too weird with the ingredients. However, the creativity is welcomed with their wide selection of burgers, including some vegetarian alternatives.   While you're filling your gullet with gravy, curds and fries, you may as well carbonize the concoction with one of their many beers.   Their prices are moderate and their service is good."}
{"text":"Great casual place, yummy food.  The burger was delicious and there's lots of options which is nice. We got the Buccaneer burger which has smoked meat & it was tasty.  The fries were really nothing special but you get to pick from different sauces which brings it up a notch.  Our waiter was the sweetest guy, very attentive.  They also have beer and wine for beverage options which is convenient.  Our waiter even brought over the bottles of wine to show me before I chose.  Not typical of a burger joint, so kind!"}
{"text":"The garlic aioli dip (for the fries) was out of this world! Friendly waiters, lively atmosphere and reasonable prices make this place a late night must-do when in Montreal."}
{"text":"First things first, this place is a fucking rip off, plain and simple. Almost twenty dollars with tip for a burger and a poutine to share with a friend; absolutely ridiculous. It's not even like the amount of food you get is substantial either. I could have eaten this whole meal by myself and I'm not a massive eater; just an accomplished one.   The poutine was a disappointment but alright. Not enough gravy to cover all the fries and the cheese curds were alright but not in enough abundance either. Their fries though are quite good and I do like the dips they have but I ordered a poutine, not fries and dip you bumbaclot...  The burger as well is a rip off and not fresh. They don't even try to hide the fact it's a frozen patty which to me is kind of lame...At least have some pride. It's a thoroughly decent burger though and they have good variety but to be honest I expect that if you eat here enough and try all the burgers, you'll experience the 'Subway Effect'; they all taste pretty much the same.  I'm sure there is a better burger in Montreal and I know there is a better poutine. I also know you can get both of these for a better price. It's still worth it though if you want to go for fries and dip but hold onto your wallets cause this place wants to bleed it."}
{"text":"really bad. went with my gf and the hamburger was dripping and created big miss. the girl working there also forgot to bring our drinks. just dont go there."}
{"text":"Go in a group, there are a variety of sauces for the fries and it's fun trying a bunch. Order a wacky burger! The caribou burger was really interesting and very tasty. Bigger variety of soft drink that most places here. Great service and great price/experience ratio.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  Full Review:  This little franchise is a burger + fires joint with a twist.  They offer interesting meats in their burgers (caribou or bison anyone?) and one of their burgers has apples in it. It's a cosy little place with dim lighting and a happy waitress that was more than happy to stand around and listen while I spent 5 minutes looking at their fridge of drinks and figuring out which of the 12 or so unique mayo-based sauces I want to get with my fries.  The bizarre varieties of drinks, sauces and unique twists placed on the burgers is what makes this place delightful. You won't just go in there and order: \"Cheeseburger, all dressed and a coke.\" It will sound more like this: \"I'll have the Rudolph with Indonesian sauce and a lime soda.\" The Rudolph, which is the 3rd or 4th burger I've had there since I've discovered the place is a caribou with onion jam, pickles and a sour mayo sauce. It's the burger that finally made me decide to add this review to my burger list.  The flavour in the caribou was rich and juicy. Very enjoyable, especially with the sour pickle and sweet onion jam. It created a burst of flavour that I really enjoyed. The other burgers I've had before were also unique but all beef. They weren't as juicy but equally interesting. If you like green apples and brie (2 things I adore) I recommend having the burger that has those in it (can't remember it's name).  I would never really tell you to go to this place alone. Before I get to that, let me digress a moment: Food, isn't always necessarily related JUST to the way it tastes - at least I try and skew my reviews not to always reflect that. Situation and atmosphere are very important in eating. So why never go alone to Frite Alors? It's multitude of mayo sauces. Every time I've been there, we were at least 3 people and we each order a different sauce so that we can mix and match and maximize the interesting experience that I always have when we go to Frite Alors.  The fries themselves aren't particularly special, but honestly, that doesn't mean anything to me. I come from Lebanon and while this may sound either extremely stupid or pompous, I've yet to taste a tuber like the ones grown in Lebanon. If I were to collective rate ALL fries I've had in Montreal, it wouldn't really exceed a 2* rating at it's VERY VERY best."}
{"text":"Pipping hot sauce poured over burnt-to-a-crisp-yet-cold fries, with whatever needless topping you'd like (I went Frite Alors, with bacon, mushrooms, onions, and red peppers). Add a drink and a tip for table service, and you're looking at $14 a person.  For what, exactly?"}
{"text":"Vous trouverez plusieurs \"Frite Alors\" à Montréal (le seul en France se trouve à Lyon). Il s'agit d'une franchise Belge ou le choix est très large (il y a même de la saucisse de Toulouse !). La cuisine est goûteuse (c'est du fast good) et la déco singulière et chaleureuse (à l'opposé des franchises ultra aseptisées et sans âme). Dans l'arrière court il y a une petite terrasse sympa pour fumer un café tranquillement. Le service est à l'image du resto, chaleureux et très amical. Je recommande."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place compares to other poutine places but for me it was okay. It was extremely filling and after eating there I wasn't hungry for another 6 hours.  I ordered the mussels and fries and the amount of mussels served was very impressive however the flavour of the broth wasn't that impressive. The lobster poutine was considerably better with chunks of deep fried lobster sprinkled throughout.  Next time I would go for a traditional poutine just because I'm curious if that's their strong suit."}
{"text":"Super casual chain place with several poutine and beer choices. We stopped by for a late night snack and got the smoked meat poutine. It was good, but nothing spectacular.   The servers were very friendly, but one warning about the place- there is a bar upstairs with lots of smokers outside. The open windows were great to enjoy the weather, but not to enjoy the smoke-filled air."}
{"text":"Great customer service but okay poutine. I don't know, maybe I got a bad batch but when I ordered poutine for delivery, the cheese curds were super weird, like it felt like I was trying to chew erasers.   But I've also tried their taco poutine; not actually 100% sure what it's called but it had sour cream, guac, etc etc. That one was pretty good.   Another thing is that the servings are pretty small."}
{"text":"With out a doubt the best French fries in North America! The only place i know with that quality and tasty équivalent was in brussell itself  Often good music. I love the avocado Burger and that andalouse sauce"}

{"text":"En quête d'un bon petit burger/frites dans les rues un peu désertes de Montreal un dimanche midi, nous avons posé notre dévolu sur Une frite alors ! Le nerf de la guerre : les frites... Et bien elles sont parfaites ! Bien dorées mais un peu molles, du grand art ! Un large choix de sauces maison est proposé pour les accompagner.   Mais quelle déception pour le burger qui les accompagne : pain industriel style pavé (où est le traditionnel bun ?!), fromage tout mou... C'est très très décevant ! Côté ambiance, l'esprit se veut inspiré de l'univers de Tintin, mis à part quelques clubs d'oeils sur le menu (dont la mitraillette, LE hit des baraques à frites belges), rien dans la déco ne rappelle la BD d'Hergé. En bref, comme le nom l'indique, ici, il vaut mieux de contenter d'une frite !"}

{"text":"Bon restaurant. Bon service. Certainement pas exceptionnel toutefois. Si vous lisez certaines des critiques positives, vous risquez d'avoir des attentes très élevées (comme moi) et d'être déçu. C'est un bon restaurant, sans plus."}
{"text":"I've heard about the good price quality food for their sandwiches combo.  Had to give it a try.  My date was craving fries.  I went for the effiloché de volaille (Shredded chicken cooked in duck fat and homemade Ribs sauce)  What I like about this place is the variety of sauces you can get to accompany the fries.  The sandwich tasted amazingly food. The duck fat was the key here. Smells good tastes good.  They also have beers which is nice.  One thing I also like was the fact that they had paper and crayola crayons.  Great timing to show off my Japanese writing haha.  The waiter was SUPER KIND. Unbelievable. Awesome service. Great experience. I enjoyed it a lot.  Good place for meal after a date.  Good food. good service."}
{"text":"Busy, but all good restaurants are.  They were very helpful, food was great, and the service also. Will be back for sure. My only sad moment was that we forgot our half mergeuz sandwich that the had gotten ready for us to take home.   Tout était tres bonne ont y retournera avec plaisir. Mon deli regret, c'est que j'ai oublier ma moitié de sandwich mergeuz labas. Tout était telement Bon"}
{"text":"Though many come here for their excellent poutine with fries that stay crunchy I highly recommend trying their burgers, they are all fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great fries with lots of creative sauce options.  Good service and couple great local area  beers. Fun to hang out."}
{"text":"Le cornet de frites du Frites Alors! vaut vraiment le détour! Une fois qu'on y a goûté, on en redemande! Leurs poutines sont également excellentes!"}
{"text":"I always bring visitors here. Love the sauces for the fries, love the burger combinations. So yummy!  On a couple of occasions, I've had problems with the service. You know, situations where you're convinced the waitress has completely forgotten you and \"dashing\" is looking more and more tempting. The food and location make it worth coming back, though, and giving it 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is a pretty fun chip and burger place with decent chips, with a choice of sauce (and quite a choice) and nice burgers. Fun!"}
{"text":"Très sympa !!    C'est dans ce restaurant que nous avons eu l'occasion de tester la fameuse poutine québecoise et nous n'avons pas été déçus :)    A noter, notre serveuse était ravissante et s'occupait très bien de nous ^^    On vous le recommande"}
{"text":"I think 3.5 stars is right on...  You've gotta love a one-city chain dedicated to that city's name sake - poutine.  I'm no poutine expert, being able to count my experiences on one hand, but I felt the poutine here was above average, but not amazing.  I'm still waiting to be blown away by poutine, but it wasn't here.... You will however have a consistent, affordable experience and they do have quite a good beer selection."}
{"text":"Bestes Burger Restaurant in der Gegend. Belgische Frites mit ca. 20 Saucen Variationen. Klare Empfehlung."}
{"text":"The vegetarian burger was great, the bread is crispy and fresh. The poutine was disappointing, reviews cited it as \"the best poutine in Montreal.\" However, we had better at the Eaton Center mall food court. At Frite Alore, the fries were soggy, the gravy was bland and the cheese was unmelted and subpar."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner. Tired and hungry. The hotdog and grilled cheese w/bacon green apple were both good. Being a poutine virgin , I decided to order some. It was awful. I found out the gravy was gluten free and there were 4 cheese curds on top at most. The server was nice but you don't go out to eat for just the service. We didn't go home hungry but would not return."}
{"text":"Entered this place on a whim while walking down the street. Glad I did. The service was nice and quick. The food was even better. I ordered a burger, L'Hambourgeois, with a side of poutine. It happened to be my first time trying poutine and my verdict is that it's amazing. The burger was really good as well. I hope to return before my trip ends."}
{"text":"I had popped in to the restaurant one Sunday afternoon , to order a sandwich and some fries . The place was cool to hangout in a group and not something romantic . The sandwich was good , but the fries were burnt . Too burnt that they taste bitter when you have some."}
{"text":"How do these guys get their stars?  I've been twice, and both times my impression was that the food was very mediocre and overpriced."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner yesterday. Ordered the Burger Week special \"Le Huppé,\" which consists of a duck confit and ground chicken patty, arugula, Saint-Guillaume aged cheddar, red cabbage slaw, cranberries, pepitas, and dijonnaise sauce on a soft ciabatta bun. The burger came with fries and sauce for $12.50.  As a chicken burger, it was pretty good. The savoury meat meshed well with the peppery greens, crunchy cabbage, sweet cranberries, nutty pepitas, and creamy sauce. However, I didn't taste anything that resembled duck confit =/ The fries were crispy and well-seasoned, but I didn't really like that they were short, stubby, and arrived in clumps (like they were stuck together in the fryer.) Service was meh... The food arrived within a reasonable amount of time, but they forgot my sauce and nobody checked on us during the meal. In fact, because we wanted to sit outside on the terrasse, we ordered and paid for our meals with the hostess and the first and last time we saw our server was when she brought us our food.  Overall it's an average burger and fries joint."}
{"text":"Local Québécoise beers, fries-poutine combos for days, burgers, sandwiches, fresh salads, and free wifi. What could be better? I'll take a side of poutine with my burger, s'il vous plaît! I split a L'Hambourgeois outfitted with a ciabatta bun, subbed the salad/fries option with a side of classic gravy-curds poutine. While I'm no stranger to poutine, my stateside experience has always been some elevated gastropub reinterpretation. It was nice to go classic. The fries were deliciously crisped and held up well against the gravy. As for the burgers-- move aside ketchup-- they're dressed from their lengthy sauce list. I also got a separate salad order and was impressed by the freshness. Who raves about a salad at a fries place? This girl.        While Saint-Denis is lined with eateries aplenty, Frite Alors was a great choice."}
{"text":"Located on St-Laurent between Sherbrooke and Prince Arthur, this little restaurant is a bit tired decor-wise (ugh, wooden chairs) and the menus could use a little typography, but the food is decent enough for the price. Service was good. Drinks were slightly overpriced ($2 Pepsi, $2.75 Stewart's etc). But the food was served quickly (it's a burger) and the sauce selection for the fries (as Belgian tradition) were good (okay, the pepper-lime was overly peppery, but why be picky.) Didn't try the poutine, because coming to a Belgian restaurant for poutine just didn't seem right. But if you are looking for a burger (we were) and a decent price (not exaggerated as some places) it was fine. Wanted to try the deer, but they were out of the Onion Confit (which begs the question of how you run out something that is a preserve... really, you can't manage to keep another jar on the shelf?) And maybe someone should mention that Emmental isn't really a Belgian cheese."}
{"text":"I'm transplanted from Nova Scotia.  Maybe I'm just too used to \"wrong\" poutine, went to the wrong spot or misc but I was unwhelmed by the poutine.  I ordered the classic, normal poutine to go.  It was sort of sweet, I'm used to a more peppery gravy, and the fries weren't bad but, I dunno.  I'll try to find another poutine place eventually but I'm sticking to tofu and apples for a while.  Service was meh, price was meh flirting with bleh.  If you're cool that made sense"}
{"text":"This establishment was perfect for the 2 hours of down time my friends and I had before hitting the road back to the states!  Nothing to note as far as decor .... It's a place for a quick bite and I had to have the poutine before we left ... after all it's the food of my people ( I am half French/Canadian)  The staff was very friendly and curtious.  The only thing is that it was cold out that morning and they had all the front awnings open, like open to the cold, outside air... so dress warm!"}
{"text":"Poutine is a must.  Not many places open late and this was a great find. The street it is located on is a fun, upbeat area.  Accepts credit card and speaks English"}
{"text":"Great for a quick bite! We stopped in for a quick dinner after a long trip up to Montreal. The staff was friendly and helpful (we only spoke a little French and they were accommodating). I got a small poutine, which was more than enough to fill me up. My friend one of their burgers and we were amused with the large amount of sauces! The Andalouse is pretty tasty.  The portions are reasonable for the price and their drink selection is small but enough to satisfy us.  Definitely stop in for a bite of Canadian fast food!"}
{"text":"Frite Alors offers quite good poutine at a reasonable price. Their poutines offer interesting combinations... I had the La Tunisienne with Merguez (Tunisian lamb/beef sausage) and onions which match perfectly with the delicious gravy and melty cheese curds! However, even the frites themselves are very good with the multiple combinations of sauces offered for a Belgian-style feast. A decent selection of bottled Belgian beers, however it could be better. I also like the graphic art reminiscent of Asterix on the walls-- gives the ambiance a lift."}
{"text":"Yummy poutine, fun college atmosphere, service a bit slow, but would definitely recommend if you're ever in downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"Almost had to give it a 4 because of the absolutely outstanding service I received, but the food really wasn't that great.  For the price of decent food, this place offers a bit more than fast food. I ordered a pork burger and tried a regular beef burger, both were decently cooked and juicy. The fries weren't bad, very crunchy, not crispy, crunchy, which made for a not-so-great poutine. The fries were served with a number of mayonnaise based sauces to choose from, which were okay, but not a lot more than small portion of mayo + something. The salad was watery green on an awkward dish. All-in-all it was fine, not worth the hype, but worth the your business."}
{"text":"Walked in on a beautiful day, and ordered the Frites Alors Poutine. But...Ehh. Cheese curds were great, the mushrooms, bacon, onion and the sauce were good, but the fries were not. Come on the fries in a Poutine were not good?! Its like having a hamburger with a so-so beef patti.  On the plus side, the service was good and there was a lot of Poutine for a very little money. They have some good, cheap local beers too!"}
{"text":"I only had the classic poutine and it did not disappoint. The \"grande\" size was more than enough for two of us. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"02/12/2016  After travelling 5-6 hours from Toronto to visit Montreal for the first time with my boyfriend this was our first food stop. The last thing we ate that day was Tim Hortons at around 8AM, right around the time we boarded the Megabus from the bus terminal back in Toronto.   Ambience: When we arrived in Montreal, the weather was freezing and it began to snow.  We just stopped into the first restaurant we saw, which happened to be a few blocks away from our AirBnB. It was warm inside and not too busy.  Service: We were instantly greeted with French greetings. We were able to seat ourselves and we looked through the menus. After 5 minutes of being near a closed windows we were still cold and asked if we could move seats and had no objections from our waitress.  Food: I ordered a small classic poutine called La Vladimir with a small burger ($12.65), while my boyfriend ordered a vegetarian burger with a side of fries and the Rémoulade sauce ($11.85). The wait for food wasn't too long. The burger was pretty good! The gravy for the poutine was savoury and the cheese curds were squeaky and great. I had a bite of the veggie burger and it was really good and my boyfriend's fries were also good with the sauce he got it with.  Price: With tip, the meal came up to around $30."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hilton Gardens Inn and we were looking for a poutine place that was close by (it was pouring). We came across Frite Alors!  It's a pretty big restaurant! I ordered the La Tunisienne - sausage and fried onions. The poutine was delicious! The sausage had a smokey taste and it came with a good amount of cheese curds. The gravy wasn't salty which was good. I would rate the overall poutine a 9.5.   We also ordered the Vladimir which is the regular original poutine. For a simple poutine it tasted good. They put the perfect amount of cheese and gravy. I would rate this poutine a 9/10.   The service was really good since our waiter was funny. The area was moderately clean, but, the joint was set up like a fast food restaurant.   Overall, I would rate this restaurant a 9. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Service was great, would have given 4 stars but the price was a little high for the food ($60 for a sandwich + large poutine, 2 beers + tip)"}
{"text":"Frite Alors appears to be a Montreal staple, and is one of many spots you can find their famous poutine in all shapes and sizes.  I'd be lying if I said this review didn't encompass multiple late night stops to the various locations they have around town, because when you're experiencing Montreal nightlife for the first time and you're ready to turn it in, you have to get your poutine fix first!  My original and most \"rememberable\" visit (for multiple reasons...) to this particular location was good, but not great.  The service gets the job done, but was somewhat inattentive...waters left unfilled, extended time between ordering drinks and ordering the food, the usual suspects.  I had a lamb burger while I was there, which tasted like a gyros inside of a bun with a different consistency.  The fries, the poutine, and their variety of dipping sauces are definitely the biggest reason to come.  Reserve Frite Alors as your post-club, not your dinner, destination the next time you are in Montreal."}
{"text":"great place for poutine. Not the best fries (not double fried/as crispy as I wish), but they had a lot of poutine options and prices were good. the pesto rose and frite alors sauces were really good, and the beeeerger was delicious"}
{"text":"I got to try this place because of its proximity to the hotel I was staying at. To my surprise, it happened to be the place that had the best poutine I've tried in Montreal. We got smoked meat and pulled bbq poutine. Both were impressive and the fries felt like they just came out from the frier, something I have not seen in the other times I've tried pouting in Montreal.  If I go back I know I'll have to pay it a visit again."}
{"text":"Messy place located in a semi-basement establishment. Waited for 15 minutes BEFORE their closing time until someone came to us and told us that they're closing.  I don't know, a simple closing sign or telling us a little earlier would've sufficed."}
{"text":"Average at best. I came in the late afternoon for a classic poutine. The dish was warm and the cheese curds were NOT melted. Really disappointed since I'm coming from the US and this is my first poutine in years. It's not like the kitchen was busy since there were only like two other tables. The fries were good though but thoroughly disappointed."}
{"text":"OMG EXCELENT PLACE Auntentic Belgian  fries, just like at home .... I saw the sign the night before and I promised myself to came back the next day and  Fabrice the waiter, Catherine and all the stuff were super friendly. (No atitude at all) Love the experience !"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 5 star review because I am a Canadian currently living in the US and I have never been to Montreal before this past weekend. My friend and I were touring around and decided to try the original poutine and a local beer (recommended by our waiter). It was a nice day out so we sat in the window seats with the open doors enjoying people watching. It was delicious and we ate the whole thing! So happy we stopped!"}
{"text":"Found this place via Pinterest & I loved it! Hours aren't regularly business hours so make sure your there before they close, I think m-f they're closed by 4pm."}
{"text":"Ordered the clubhouse sandwich and received what looked like cat food on a bun with a soggy piece of lettuce and one stubby sorry excuse piece of \"bacon\" whom ever made it cut it diagonally and dropped some parsley for esthetics which was actually kinda funny.  KUDOS to the server who agreed a standard clubhouse sandwich is made with turkey not canned chicken, she was embarrassed that she worked for this company as she should be, your done frites alores"}
{"text":"Poutine in several different flavors, funky sauces for French fries, burgers, wings, some seafood.   Came here for my first Poutine experience and I am so glad I did! I had the Poutine with Pulled Pork and it was DEEEELICIOUS! We started off with some wings which were pretty good. Ordered the sundries tomato and basil fry sauce to go with them and it was really good.   The service here is not so good. Our waitress started to take our order then ran off, she came back and seemed annoyed by our requests to translate some of the menu items into English for us. The food came out in good time, but we hardly saw her the rest of our time there. Had to grab other waitresses for water refills, when it was time for the check, etc.   The Poutine was so good though that I would go back."}
{"text":"Please pay no attention to the fact that the average rating is 4 out of 5.   Every time to travel to Montreal from New York we go to this place to sample the superb poutine, excellent fries, fantastic burgers (the one I had last time was probably the best burger I've had in years) and tasty local draft beer. This is our favorite place to eat on St Denis. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Ce frite alors ci ma carrément réconcilié avec la chaîne. Je l'avais pour la première fois testé sur Lyon et bien il n'y a juste aucun rapport car j'ai adoré celui ci. Testé 3 fois, toujours celui de la rue sainte Catherine, le lieu est spacieux, très aéré, on attends à l'entrée qu'une serveuse vienne pour nous installer puis on commande. J'ai goûté leur hamburger (juste délicieux) fait avec du vrai pain de chez nous (j'étais trop contente) et leurs Poutine (la Vladimir a chaque fois car à la minute où je l'ai essayé je l'ai adopté). Tout était excellent. La serveuse elle était très attentive et venait régulièrement s'assurer que tout se passe bien.   Juste en face de moi une immense TL sur laquelle on peut suivre base ball, hockey, basket enfin tout ce qui s'apparente à du sport. Il y a une petite terrasse mais en renfoncement ce qui nous permet de profiter de l'air frais caniculaire des montréalais tout en nous évitant le bruit immense de la rue (très animé) sainte Catherine.   L'addition elle est un chouia plus élevée qu'en France mais bon il y a le pourboire également et depuis que je suis ici je suis assez généreuse au niveau des pourboires on va dire qu'il y a une petite différence de 2 euros par rapport à celui que j'avais testé en France."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Friday afternoon to grab a poutine snack to shore up our bellies before a super late dinner reservation. Frites Alors was my favorite of the two poutine places we stopped at on this trip to Montreal.   Boyfriend got the sausage and onion poutine. The gravy was really good - thin but not too watery, super flavorful and delicious. Cheese curds were good, and the onions were red which are my favorite kind, and I thought a nice touch that elevated the whole dish. The only disappointment was the sausage - the flavor was there but it was REALLY spicy, too spicy for me.   I didn't want a full poutine so I just went with frites. They have a ton of different flavored mayonnaise/sauces which I just loved. I got the béarnaise mayo which was more bearnaise flavors and not the sauce itself so slightly disappointing, but still good.  The service was good and there wasn't a line or wait to get in - always a plus. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst poutine and cheeseburger. Fries were cardboard, cheese was rubber. Cheeseburger was okay, but will not be visiting again. Avoid!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite things in Montreal is, funnily enough, this Belgian chain. They specialise in chips, which are served in little baskets with your selection of dips, though they also do various main courses. Being Belgian, mayonnaise and beer are obviously important elements, though because it's in Quebec you can also get poutine. It's nothing special and the prices are not bargain-basement, but it's reliable enough and I'm a fan of their chips. This branch on Saint-Laurent has a terrace which looks out onto the famous thoroughfare - good for people watching, though it's not the most interesting stretch - and they also open up the front during summer so air can circulate."}
{"text":"I came in here once upon a time 4 years ago and thought that the fries were absolutely phenomenal. I never set foot in this place again because I was trying to get healthier. In any case, I brought my parents in after my mom mentioned something about a craving for fries three months ago. Man what a disappointment it was. The fries were terrible..I was embarassed that I had even raved about them to my parents in the first place.... Either their standards have changed from 4 years ago, or we were uucky that day. Either way, can't give more than a 3! Sorry!"}
{"text":"One of the neat things about Montreal is that even fast food is made with quality ingredients and served with alcohol. When you have that \"beer and a burger\" craving, you don't need to go to the local pub, you can head to Frite Alors!.  I give this place four stars...  Star #1 is for the local microbrews and homemade iced tea. All yummy.  Star #2 is for the burgers. They're served on good-quality buns and there are lots of delicious toppings. (Unfortunately for dairy-free me, lots of those toppings are cheese. Oh, how I miss cheese).  Star #3 is for the frites. They are skinny fries served in a paper cone, à la Belgique. They are served with your choice of homemade mayo. I can recommend the aïoli, the Frite alors, and the Béarnaise, which tastes even herb-ier if you request vinegar for your fries. Someday I have to try piccallili, which I love with crackers and cheddar but have never thought of trying with fries.  I always go in promising to have salad instead of fries (or at least half-half) but the frites are just too yummy to pass up. Also very filling.   Star #4 is for the crayons and brown paper \"tablecloth\". I am so easy to entertain.  The atmosphere is casual but classier than a fast-food chain. At this location in the Quartier Latin, we often see groups of university students. It's not a quiet spot for date night but it's an affordable indulgence when you want some artery-clogging goodness. Service is a bit hit-and-miss. Food and drinks come promptly but it's sometimes a challenge go flag down the server for the bill or a refill on drinks."}
{"text":"Just got the worst service ever. My family and i did pickup order and left an $8 tips. Once we get home our order was missing a fries. When we asked if they can deliver or reimburse the fries they said they can't do any of the above. The only other options offered was for us to leave our family dinner on Dec 26 and come over to be reimbursed our 3.50. Definitively, Pierre the server and the store manager are not the most customer friendly. Last time for us ;-)"}
{"text":"Well I wished we could have tried the poutine here. But unfortunately we came in about half an hour before closing and was told that they were closing because it was busy. I have never been to a restaurant that refused guests with that much time before closing. AWFUL service!!! If I could give it zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Pour ceux qui n'ont jamais goûté la fameuse poutine c'est là qu'il faut aller.  L'ambiance repose sur le monde de la bande dessinnée, assez étrange pour un établissement qui fait des frites, poutines et burgers. Le service est terriblement rapide, on en vient même à transpirer quand on les voit courir dans tous les sens.  // For those who never tasted the poutine, this is the place to go. The atmosphere is based on the belgium comic book world, quite strange for a burger/poutine/frites place. The staff is amazingly quick, you just watch them run around and you're already sweating."}
{"text":"have a never-ending love affair with poutine - not fries, cheese, and gravy - but POUTINE. What's the difference you ask? One is good, the other is monkeymadness delicious.  My only problem with poutine is that in Montreal it's everywhere: La Belle Province, Mamma's, Lafleuer, La Banquise, and so forth. Let me clarify, by problem I mean so much poutine, so little time.  Of all the fast food poutine in the city, my favourite is Frite Alors! The gravy is savoury and seasoned, the cheese curds are bountiful and rich, and the fries are crispy and flavourful. So good, exclamation mark."}
{"text":"Probably the best fries I've had in Canada! Certainly a must.   But stay away from the burgers - they're average at best."}
{"text":"Poutine is sooo good. The fries are fantastic, the gravy peppery, and the cheese curds fresh. The sandwiches are very tastes too.  Many mayo options, I had \"limette\" and it was flavorful but not overpowering."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were devastated to see that Patati Patata was closed for vacation, but we were craving poutine, so we decided to try Frites Alors. There was no food menu on our table, but when someone finally came over a good five minutes after we sat down to see if we'd been served, he seemed exasperated that we had to ask which poutine was the normal one (the Vladimir). We got a large plain poutine and a pint of blonde beer on tap.  The poutine was pretty good: great fries, decent sauce (salty though), and good cheese curds, but the portion was pretty average, good for splitting two ways.   Our dismay came when we never saw another server again. We decided to push our way up to the takeout counter so that someone would take our money and we could leave. The total was $22 for 1 poutine and 1 beer! The poutine was over $10, and the beer, some kind of a house draft, was over $7.  With the number of cheaper places you could go instead (Patati Patata!), there's no reason to get ripped off here."}
{"text":"I had La Frites Alors poutine which comes with bacon, sautéed onions and mushrooms, and of course cheese curd and brown sauce.  It was delicious, and there was lots of it!  The service was very good as well; I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The fries were way too oily and the Vladimir poutine was unappetizing. There just wasn't enough flavor in the poutine to make it interesting. All in all, a disappointing poutine experience for me."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here twice, consecutively.  The \"Frite Alors\" burger with the \"Mexicane\" sauce will not fail you. I PROMISE."}
{"text":"Outstanding! I had the \"hamburger frite alors\" and was not at all disappointed - perfect with the fries and \"mexicain\" sauce. Can I get seconds, please??"}
{"text":"Ordered la frite alore poutine (bacon, mushrooms, onions, red peppers + poutine) and it was SO GOOD! Crispy fries, soft on the inside. Best poutine! Great beers too! Such a great experience on the terrasse outside :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! We each got different poutines (steak, traditional, pulled pork) and loved them all. Another person got a burger and loved it too. Try the speciality sauces. They are worth it! So delicious."}
{"text":"Really great place - fun and ok for kids as well. You can sit in the window and people watch in the cool neighborhood. Definitely recommend the fries, with many dipping sauces, and poutine as well."}
{"text":"I visited this location of the Frite Alors! chain yesterday, and was definitely happy about my dish choice! I ordered the Texan BBQ Hamburger, which contained beef, bacon, gruyere, mushrooms, and was topped with a sprinkle of BBQ sauce. It was served with the classical french fries cone, and I asked for a side of Pistou Rosé mayonnaise.   Everything was served warm and in a very reasonable time delay (which was great because I was actually in a hurry). The mayonnaise was absolutely awesome; the burger tasty and well-seasoned.   Having already visited another location (i.e. The tiny piece of restaurant on St-Charles St. in the Old Longueuil, on the South shore), I was able to compare both experiences. Although I found that the food was definitely better at the Ste-Catherine W. location, the atmosphere was, without doubt, more familiar at the other location.  Still, I would recommend both to anyone - What can I do, their fries are just TOO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Came to Frite Alors for supper with some friends. Place is pretty small but still accommodated a table for 8. Ordered a burger with a reg poutine. Burger was a tad small 5oz but it was quite good and filling along with the poutine. Didn't hear any complaints from our group. Would come back again if in the area."}
{"text":"We ate here 3 years ago, when we visited Montreal on our babymoon, and it was on our list of places to eat when we returned to Montreal this past week. We've only had the veggie hot dogs and fries here, and I doubt we will ever get around to trying anything else, the dogs are THAT GOOD. Not only are the dogs good, but their fries....oh my. And you get a dipping sauce with them, too. You choose from like 10 or so, I think, and they are really all good, but our favorite is the curry. Their curry sauce is kind of like Nutella. You could put it on an old shoe and you'd say \"man, that shoe is GOOD!\" Lots of beers to choose from too. I probably would go back to Montreal JUST to eat at this place."}
{"text":"nommy nommy nommy! the poutine here rocks!  the burgers rock too!  but... last time I went the gravy sauce was poured on a little too heavy, but the cheese curds are noms and the fries are noms and the people are awesome who work here and the burgers are totally kick ass.  and i don't even really like burgers all that much. :) nommmmms!  definitely- if you're visiting montreal and need a poutine experience, i say go here.  want more of me?  video blog at http://www.tastytwosome.com"}
{"text":"Always seen this place around town (they're a chain) but never had the urge to check it out. Was catching a movie nearby and had some time to kill, and this place seemed like an okay option.   I was expecting something along the lines of a BellePro, but this is a full on sit-down-and-have-a-server-take-your-order kinda spot, complete with alcoholic beverages (cocktails even) and a fairly respectable food menu: burgers, sandwiches, appetizers, poutines and more.   I went for the hot dog with a side salad. Not bad, not bad at all. My partner had the merguez (Arabic sausage) sandwich with fries and she was pleasantly surprised (she's Arab). The service was rather slow, but the servers were super sweet. The decor is cute and they have crayons at some of the tables so you can go avant garde on your placemats.   Probably wouldn't go out of my way to go here but a good spot to hit up in a pinch."}
{"text":"I know that I'm not a poutine expert, but this was bomb poutine.  We came in after midnight after getting out of the bar, but the service was slowww.  The smoked meat poutine was amazing!"}
{"text":"I've never been so disgusted in my life. I downloaded the Yelp app just to write this review. DO NOT EAT HERE! The grease they fried everything in was old. The wine tasted like chilled gasoline. My night is ruined. I'm two seconds away from vomiting. This almost completely ruined my impression of Montreal and poutine."}
{"text":"Went during busy hour and waited for about half an hour without anyone asking. But, the fries was good. Should've ordered small size of poutine."}
{"text":"Quick, easy, late night food. It's a chain so they're all similar. This one is clean, friendly staff, usually empty. Great for fast bite. I enjoy their meat poutines and burgers. It's not the most mind blowing poutine but it gets the job done. They have a pretty good beer selection though and 3, count three, different brands of root beer! Not sure why that is but it's fun."}
{"text":"The Croque Végétarien (country bread, mushrooms, avocado, onions, peppers, goat cheese, Rémoulade sauce) is an amazing sandwich I wish I could have every day! The service at this place was super friendly, especially since not all of us were fluent in French. They were quick to explain a problem with the grill that they thought might cause a delay in getting our orders out, but it turns out the delay was hardly noticeable. The variety of poutines is a good range, we tried the L'eau à la Bush and enjoyed it though the serving seemed a bit too much for two people also ordering other things. This is definitely on my must-return-to list of places next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Terrible service. The waitress came over twice 1. To seat us 2. To ask for our order then not let us finish by walking away.  We ordered a cheese platter (disgusting quality of cheese, worse $9.00 ever spent). Also ordered a burger with fries terrible quality and my partner ended up ordering a burger and poutine. The meat was not cooked properly and the poutine was stale and the cheese was rubbery. A terrible experience and very disappointing. What bothered me the most is when told the food was not very good the waitress took my Visa card forcefully and did not say anything other than a bad attitude.  SAVE $50.00 and eat at a Burger King down the street folks!!"}
{"text":"The fries we got were large size, and it was very thick cut and fried to perfection. The sauces were good, but not crazy amazing. The workers are very nice and they gave extra sauces with no charge."}
{"text":"We had this poutine with meat and mushrooms over it.  I wanted more gravy though.  It wasn't the salty mess you get at New York Fries, but I expected all the stuff on the fries to really add a little bit more flavor than what I tasted.  But I did eat their cheekily named Rudolph Burger.  Montreal's brimming with meat gamier than what I usually find in other restaurants.  The burgers are served on a nice foccacia bun with pickles, a nice leaf of lettuce, and a toothpick speared through the middle.  Satisfying, and a fun, low-key atmosphere."}
{"text":"I tend to not be too into chain restaurants, but anything that involves fresh cheesecurds typically has me sold.  I had yet to try a legit Poutine in Montreal, and Frite Alors seemed like the place to go.  With a few Veggies in our crowd, we were pleased to learn they even had a meat-free option (I'm not entirely convinced the gravy was vegetarian, but hey, if they tell me it's not meat I ain't pushin it).    Prices weren't bad, and as I've come to find of the Service Industry in general in Montreal, they were extremely accommodating.  People split various entrees, and they offered to split individual bills, and would evenly divide things people had split onto individual bills - the Veggie Poutine they divided onto 4 separate bills!  Tasty, filling, and fun.  Go to Frite Alors for a classic Poutine experience!"}
{"text":"Not sure if I went on a bad fries day, but the fries were too oily. Would only come back if its a group thing, they have ample space to accommodate big crowds. But, overall, not the kind of place you crave food from. 3 stars for service friendly, food came out relatively quick (but it was only us there, group of about 20), and big clean space."}
{"text":"Walked in after having a few beers on St. Denis. The restaurant is spacious and cozy, the service is efficient and the servers maintain a friendly composition. Their french fries are made to perfection, yes... they are a little greasy on the outside but perfectly crispy and tender on the inside. I got the Mexican sauce to go with it, which was a good balance between sweet and spicy and is one of the few non-mayo based sauces. I also had the veggie burger, which tasted just about right. I enjoyed the entire meal, it hit the spot.   Being a fan of Belgian beer, I would've liked to kick a few back, but I had already drank prior to going there, so I was set for the night. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Headed here to have some poutine while in Montreal in a short visit. The poutine was good but not the absolute best I have ever had. The meal however was a very good value for the money and the variety of sauces available for other dishes was very appreciated."}
{"text":"staffs were very friendly but... kitchen messed up my order. poutine tasted horrible. i like poutine and i expected better. i want my money back. will not go back."}
{"text":"Best. Poutine. Ever. That is all. Very prompt service and an excellent choice of French beers. Next time I'm in Montreal, I'd like to think I'd eat a poutine somewhere else to compare, or if I go back to Frite Alors, I'd try a different poutine, but I can't make that promise. Just incredible"}
{"text":"Really cute place with amazing poutine. Cute walls, aesthetic, and lots of art. The kitchen is open so you will leave smelling like food!  There's lots of booths and there's a large bar scene. The service was slow as it took a while to order and get our check, maybe because there weren't many people working there (it was a Friday night, though.)  Great location in downtown Montreal, within walking distance of lots of restaurants, stores, McGill, and Concordia."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  We got the poutine (La Vladimir) & the burger with fries / frite alors sauce. The poutine was pretty good, not the best one we've had. The burger was just okay, nothing special. We like the frite alors sauce. It was spicy & tasty. The portions were decent. They were definitely enough for us.   The food were good. The service was definitely below average. It's a small place with just one waiter. It was so hard just to ask for a glass of water. Our waiter wasn't attentive.   Our bill came out to $23.45 without tip.   Food alone is 4.5 stars, minus 1 star for the below average service"}
{"text":"Had my first poutine here! It was pretty good. The service was average, we couldn't get much of it because it was so busy. The rushed atmosphere wasn't too easing. Would go again!"}
{"text":"Since it was my first time visiting Montreal, I wanted to try authentic Canadian food (although I know Frite Alors! is a chain, so how authentic can it be, but that's beside the point).  My friend suggested we eat poutine, as it is a common Canadian dish.    We shared L'eau à la Bush (poutine with steak, onions, and mushrooms).  The portions are large, so two people can share.  My friend loved their poutine so much, she was upset she didn't take any back home. The waiter was friendly and attentive.    The place is fairly snug, but it has an open concept.  There is metered parking, which can be kind of a pain because it is located in such a busy area, so be prepared to walk.   I would definitely eat here again when visiting Canada."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick lunch with my wife. After my meal I headed towards the washroom, where I was followed by an employee.  He entered a stall and proceeded to do a number 1.  After leaving the stall he never washed his hands and headed back into the restaurant,  I was quick to follow him, turns out he's the cook.  Well, I can tell you I will never return to this or any other Frites Alors location ever again."}
{"text":"I've been going to Frites alors for about 5 years. Most of the time, I am quite happy with ordering a large fry for two, two beers, and a handful of different sauces/dips to try. Their sauces are excellent for most of them, and their fries are always fresh and crispy. I would go as far as saying that might be in the top3 in montreal for fries alone.  This review has more to do with the poutine. I tried the regular poutine, and the mexican poutine. On both poutines (on two separate occasions), the fries were fresh and well cooked but the cheese was average. I could tell they didn't get it fresh from a local supplier: it wasn't squeeky, it wasn't oily or salty. It was just your typical curd that was probably kept frozen for some time. Maybe I've just been unlucky, as others here on Yelp seem to suggest that they do have fresh curds.  The sauce of the regular poutine was average. Not bad, not good, but not memorable. It lacked something distinctive, to make it stand out. That's not to say that I didn't like it (I did), but it's nowhere close to some of the best traditional poutines in Montreal (e.g. Maam' Bolduc, Poutine Lafleur (Verdun), La Banquise). Still, if you're in the area it'll do.  The mexican poutine was interesting. It is actually just the same as a regular poutine (chicken gravy, fries, chesse), but with the addition of the \"mexican\" sauce that they use as a side for french fries orders: tomatoes, hot peppers and corriander. So you get this strange layered combination of sauces which, once mixed, kinda spices up the traditional sauce and makes it look like one of those italian poutines (red pasta sauce) but with a kick. It's something to try once, but I wouldn't try it again necessarily.  Overall, Frites Alors! is a great place to sit down, have a drink or two and chat while eating some crisp fries with great sauces. Their poutines are okay, and my experience with other foods has been the same (burgers). Don't expect more than that."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday, they claim they have the best fries in town, they are pretty good.  Had this with a 3 type of meat sandwich (I don't remember the name, sorry) which comes with fries and a homemade sauce. I chose the aioli .    Sauces are pretty good, spicy is really good as well.  Sandwich is delicious, great sauce.  Fries were really good with a decent helping.    Service is really good, waiter had good recommendations and was very friendly.  Would definately go again"}
{"text":"It was my first time going there and I loved it! I ordered the special lunch of the day (Burger frite alors which includes fries) and though it might have been a nornal burger to most people, I loved it. Especially the fries, they were amazing!! They have a very nice variety of dishes on their menu and the different dippings for the fries were interesting too! The service was great, the waiter was super nice. Will definitely go back some time soon! :)"}
{"text":"Great burger joint. Interesting selection of burgers and various local and European beers. The fries are really good and the service is great. The place is very busy, so maybe reservations are a good idea"}
{"text":"Didn't think it was gonna be as good as my friend told me it would be but it was fantastic!  I got the beerger which has goat cheese and bacon. Asked for the bacon well done and it came out nice and crispy. They put mayo and lettuce and tomato of course and the bun isn't a boring hamburger bun it's on a sour dough buns.  A frie comes with ur burger and you get to pick a sauce which is big enough for ur entire fry believe me lol I'm usualy the one who wants 3-4 mayo packets for my fries but this one sauce was perfect.  Friendly staff on the phone when i called for pick up :)"}
{"text":"Great Belgian burgers, a variety of sauces for your frites, and refreshing imported belgian beers.  What more to say?"}
{"text":"It's a chain but they do a good job.  Quick friendly service and they checked back to see how we were doing.  We got a Poutine Porc Effiloche (our waitress's favorite). The pulled pork was moist with good flavor and a light (not overpowering) bbq. The poutine (french fries, cheese curds and gravy) was also excellent.  The gravy can make or ruin it (had canned gravy in an Ottawa cafe and it sucked). Frite Alors had a good gravy and the curds were made daily.  We also tried a burger kebab with lamb and beef, it was dry and we wish we'd gone straight beef on that.  The bun was great.  We got a side of fries with the burger and got the Americaine sauce with mayo, paprika, shallots, garlic, onions and harissa.  It was ok and we do like mayo with fries but preferred catsup.  There are several homemade sauces so plenty to try.  Not the best poutine we had but good enough to go back."}
{"text":"Casual little joint for POUTINE and beer done right. What more do you need? POUTINE!  Very friendly staff, was patient with me stumbling around and speaking weak French."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant at random, based on a handful of factors. It was close to our hotel; it was close to a metro station; they had things other than poutine on the menu; they were open.  We needed a quick but hearty meal before heading to a music festival the morning we stopped here, and in that we weren't disappointed. The restaurant was one of few along the Rue Saint-Denis that were open at the time, and we didn't really want to spend too much time wandering when we had a trip to manage.  So, we entered the establishment and walked up the stairs to be greeted and seated by one of the waitresses working that day. She gave us a small table next to the windows, so we were able to watch the street wake up.  The menu, as I mentioned, featured items other than poutine, and though that was my requirement for the day, what did I end up ordering but a variation of poutine! We placed our orders - a Mexican version for me (meat, salsa, guacamole and salsa, complete with one tortilla chip), and the L'eau à la Bush for him (steak, onions and mushrooms). Much as we wanted to add a beer to our order, we both abstained and went with just water, instead. We were planning on being in the sun at the festival all day, after all, and wanted to be as hydrated as possible going in.  The restaurant is rather large, and very bright and airy, thanks to the large windows. It was nice sitting there, enjoying the breeze and people-watching. I enjoyed that part very much.  Our food came out pretty quickly, and I was surprised by the servings. Initially, I thought they were kind of small, but once we dug in, I realized how deceptive looks can be. There was a lot of food there!  So yes, they were fries, and probably not the healthiest of choices, but it was pretty dang good. My version was like a taco on fries, plus the brown gravy that seems to be everywhere. I didn't think I'd enjoy it quite as much as I did, especially given the fact that I didn't think brown gravy would pair with things like sour cream and guacamole. Silly me.  My husband's meal was a bit more \"typical\", with meat and sauce mixed in with his fries. He enjoyed his tremendously, and put a pretty good dent into his bowl. I didn't do quite so well with mine - it was a lot of food, I tell ya! - but I certainly was full by the time I tapped.  The waitress was friendly, and kept coming by to ensure our water glasses were full, and to check  on us. It was nice, considering there were only three other tables occupied at that time.   Overall, it was a good, quick, cheap experience that filled us up and helped us prep for the day ahead. Random it might have been, I am glad we ended up here."}
{"text":"Great palce to try the poutine. Gravy is tasty. Good for a quick bite, good service and don't have to wait for a long time like La banquise. They have multiple locations in Montreal."}
{"text":"De tout des endroits de Montreal, je me souviens de cet le plus. Les frites belges et la bière Cheval Blanc sont très bien, et le service est aimable aussi. Je recommande fortement la sauce mexicaine."}
{"text":"Upon arriving to Montreal, the first thing on our minds were poutine, so after quickly yelping, we found this place that specializes in the gravy fries goodness. After walking around St. Cat's and not being able to find this place, we just settled for Peel's Pub. It's okay though we were able to find this place the next day, hidden in the downstairs on St. Cat's. Even though we weren't too hungry at the time, we still managed to stomach a big plate of poutine. I ordered the poutine with beef, mushrooms, and onions. The food was okay, way toooo much ground beef more than the fries itself. The cheese was chunky, meat was salty, and the gravy was almost non-existent. After picking off my friend's plate, I came to the conclusion that poutine should be simpl, just gravy and cheese. If you're into all the extras with your poutine give it a shot, and if fries aren't your flavor, they also burgers and more."}
{"text":"Un classique, pour manger de bonnes frites! :) Il y en a pour tous les goûts, différentes sortes et différentes sauces Super en cas de hangover ;)"}
{"text":"Frite Alors does not disappoint when it comes to food. The burgers are delicious and the poutine is authentic.  The service is lacking. Recently, I frequented Frite Alors and was in the process of paying the bill. I had already put aside a very generous tip for the waitress, out of sight. While I was paying with the card machine, she felt the need to remind me that \"service was not included\" in a very condescending tone. It is bad form for a dining experience and would expect better trained waitstaff from such a popular location."}
{"text":"I am giving this a 5 star review because as I see it, you go here for 1 thing, and 1 thing only.   French fries. At least that's what we went for, and it's all that we got. We walked in, paid $4 for a small order, and walked out. I'm not going to pretend I remember what kind of sauce we had (D thinks it was a sun-dried tomato and basil, all I know is that it was good). But like I just said in the parenthetical there, it was damn tasty. The guy told us what most people go for, and we went for something else. But I have a feeling that it wouldn't have mattered. I'm sure they were all solid.   I don't know what else they serve nor do I much care. If you're here for a review of anything else on the menu, sorry to disappoint but this is all I got. I guess in a way this is how I like to approach things. Don't go to a diner for the smoked halibut dinner platter. Likewise, don't go to a French fry joint and get a Caesar salad. Come for the fries, eat the fries, enjoy the fries.   And be happy you did. Well worth it, enjoy the trip."}
{"text":"The menu is very large, lots to chose from. If you want a large variety of poutine then this is the place for you! At first we felt a bit awkward entering this restaurant, almost like everyone was staring at us because of how the restaurant is laid out. Very open concept, which you quickly get used to, especially after a caeser or two! The waiter was very friendly and the food came quick. The poutine is huge and I would recommend splitting with someone because by the time you get to the centre of the poutine it is soggy."}
{"text":"Les Poutines sont bonnes et j'ai apprécié les bières locale ! De plus l'accueil est chaleureux et l'ambiance bande dessiné est cool !"}
{"text":"Elles sont Belges, blondes et dorees.  Great fries and Belgian beers.  What else could you ask for?   Some of the best fries that I have ever had since living in Bruges."}
{"text":"This was a pretty disappointing location. The fries were badly made. Some were hard, some weren't properly salted, some were just tasteless. I was with some friends and they both thought the fries weren't very good and I have to agree even though I love their fries usually. It's such a bummer because this was their first time coming here and they got a bad batch of fries.  The location is nice but the kitchen makes the whole place unbearably hot. I wouldn't eat here. They have a lovely terrace though."}
{"text":"Amazing quality fries as always. Wanted Mexican but got dragged here? Order the Taco Poutine, I felt satisfied as if I had just eaten both tacos and poutine. One star off because they forgot my drink and some of the side order fries weren't crisp, but fast and friendly delivery!"}
{"text":"This is right down the street from us and a decent option for a quick bite. The food is more expensive than I think it should be for the quality. The fries with mayo are pretty good (like the curry one), poutine is ok (not my favourite fries for poutine), and club sandwich was pretty plain and not worth the price.  They have a nice patio in the summer - a good option for a drink and some fries once in a while!"}
{"text":"First night in town I chose this place to get easy take out, had the pulled pork pressed sandwich, kind of pricey for the size but it was pretty delicious. It's one of those foods that looks gross but full of flavor... I especially liked the onions. The device was friendly and fast"}
{"text":"What it is: Belgian fries chain that also sells burgers.  This specific location: Cute small Frite Alors with a terrace, good quality fries with an array of different sauces. I tried the Indonesian,  béarnaise and the piccallily  sauces..with the winner being the béarnaise. I also ordered tartare, which was tasty, not too expensive & a generous portion.    For a chain it's pretty good.   I have yet to try any of their burgers, I just wanted to eat some fries since I very much missed my Belgische friet. Next time I'm going to order a burger & update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"Had a really great time on their terrace - good food, good beer, (good friends also contributed to the occasion). All in all - it was a good start to our evening, before heading for a concert at the nearby Place des Arts."}
{"text":"I tried the hot dog , i was disappointed because it came in cibatta bread ...The menu didnt have any pictures of the food , so that got me very indecisive . The sandwich had an over-powering taste of horse radish or dijon mustard idk .... on the bright side the waitress was cool, the sauce, fries we're good. barely overpriced , not a good place to go if ur strugglin, sitck wit shitty quebecois fast-food joints , not really . i recommend the poutine and fries with their special aoli   - stoner approved"}
{"text":"YES! as soon as i got to montreal, i needed to have poutine.  in the bronx, we have disco fries at the diner, very similar...but no curds, just mozzarella (bronx...remember?)  so when i sat down, i ordered my delicious traditional poutine and a boreale beer, watched a canadiens game and butchered the french language....what a great night!  would've had more poutine there throughout the trip, but i thought i might die from a heart attack if i did....also it was pretty hard to walk between frites alors and the hotel on a sheet of ice. no wonder you guys love hockey...why no salting the pavement? us new yorkers are a privileged, entitled bunch who can't handle such things!"}
{"text":"Nice dipping sauces.  Great location.  Fast service (mainly because French fries and dipping sauce take no time to assemble).  Slightly over-priced for French fries."}
{"text":"I woke up after a night of drinking and wanted poutine. Frites Alors had it, in spades! The restaurant is a cute little place in the center of montreal, they serve a  number of different types of Poutine. The service was actually good, and on top of the good service and poutine they had a very good menu for beer! I know it was brunch but I couldnt help but get myself one of their beers from a local brewery! Quebec is a light year ahead of Ontario in terms of beer, and I definitely enjoyed being able to get good beer just about everywhere. I enjoyed the Poutine, which had fried onions on it, and tasted pretty good. I would definitely go back here!"}
{"text":"I also followed Kenneth's revue and went for the poutine with steak and mushrooms. I gotta say, I really enjoyed it. Total props to Yelpers for once again leading me to another great eating experience!  The curds were fresh and not overly salty and the fries were perfectly done and very, very crispy.  Additionally, super friendly staff, with loads of personality. So go to one of the many surrounding, overly priced restaurants if you want to be seen, but check this out if you really want to eat!"}
{"text":"This place had incredible Poutine. Well worth the visit. I went to the location in Montreal, nearest Mont Royal. The staff were friendly, and the atmosphere was great. It was so good, I went back the next day!"}
{"text":"Super solid poutine! Our waiter patiently helped us Anglos through the options on the menu. We ended up with two delicious local brews and two fantastic poutines. The Vladimir (Classique) was delicious with loads of cheese curds and gravy. I devoured the Poutine de porc éfiloché with its duck fat fries and mound of excellent pulled pork on top. We left very satisfied with food, drinks, and service. Looking for good poutine? This is a good place to start!"}
{"text":"I was right around the corner from Frite Alors and really wanted French fries. I pulled up my trusty Yelp app and Frite Alors seemed like a natural choice so away I went!  Their fries are served in a classical European cone and come with a choice of homemade sauces. I chose the Andalouse  which is a combo of mayo, tomatoes, and spices and it was quite nice.  Because a pregnant woman cannot live on fries alone (well I probably could, but it would take quite a lot of fries) I also ordered a burger. It was just a regular hamburger with cheese, relish, mustard, onions, lettuce, and tomatoes. It was really, really big though. I ended up eating only about half of it.   I took my order to go as I was at an event around the corner so I can't speak to the dining in experience, but the people that helped me were fast and friendly. I was in and out of there with my much-desired fries in no time and I enjoyed them thoroughly!"}
{"text":"Poutine La Vladimir [Regular Sauce]($10.00/Lrg) Les Trois Mousquetaires(QC) - Blanche($4.50/Bottle)  Aside from a few straggling top Curds, this Poutine was fulfilling. As you know, impaired judgement makes Poutines hard to rate. It does however make it easy to stuff in one's mouth."}
{"text":"I was in the neighbourhood and was just craving for some good fries. The fries here was good but not \"perfect\". I got a small regular poutine to go and I only waited for less than 5 min to get my food - super fast!  The fries, gravy and cheese curd all tasted good but they could be done better for the price I paid. overall it was good but overpriced. maybe the rest of the items on the menu were more worthy trying."}
{"text":"AMAZING poutine!! Ordered a large poutine withtasty potatoes and cheese curds for 2 people. Proportions are just right in my opinion - not too crazy and doesn't leave you hungry for more (in a good way). There are multiple locations throughout Montreal. This one has a casual and comfortable setting but isn't the biggest location so seating is limited."}
{"text":"Me and my husband were wondering around downtown trying to find a place to sample the infamous Montreal poutine and Frite Alors did not disappoint! We got a smoked meat with added brie cheese and an order of lobster poutine. It was comfort food at its best. The most delicious poutine I have ever had. Add a glass of beer and it's perfect. Service was great: friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Poutine, Poutine, Poutine!  Super unhealthy, but you need a layer of fat when it's cold out, right?  This place reminds me of a college bar where I use to go. Everyone there was very nice.  I got to watch Hockey (in french), drink local beer, and have my yearly fix of poutine.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Had their regular poutine as a snack. Oh man. It was awesome. This is not ultra fancy poutine, but still serviceable. Recommended."}
{"text":"Assez difficile de noter Frite Alors car il y a beaucoup de positif mais il y a aussi beaucoup de points négatifs : - trop de choix dans la carte donc forcément les plats sont parfois un peu décevants - la nourriture est un peu trop grasse en général : huile.. - c'est un peu cher pour ce que c'est en général (burgers,Poutine..)  Par contre: -beaucoup de sauces possibles dont des choses qu'on a du mal à trouver ailleurs : béarnaise, aioli, samouraï.. - les frites sont vraiment bonnes - même si c'est cher il y en a quand même pour tous les prix et y'a moyen de pas payer trop cher au final  Bref sympa pour manger bien gras de temps en temps mais rien d'extraordinaire non plus!"}
{"text":"Loveee the decor! Nicely painted camels on the walls, cute pictures and fonts on the menu (bonus points as i'm in graphics!) and friendly waitress. Fries are crispy and crunchy, and great experience overall.  I had Le Rudolph Burger, which is moose meat (or so the menu says elk) with onion sauce (a lot of it! my hand was dripping with it), dijon, cheese, and pickles (which i took out). They don't stinge on the condiments. I never had moose before, the texture is like beef, though it's not beefy in taste. It doesn't have the gross bits of tendons and fat in the burger like beef does. It's meaty and leaner I would say. There's not a distinctive taste to it, really. Interesting try, very filling. it was a lot of moose/elk lol.  I dipped my fries in Pistou-Rosé, which has mayo, basil, dried tomatoes, oil and pine nuts. Don't regret it. It tastes greattt- kind of like hummus dip which I liked better than the other sauces like Aioli, which had more mayo than flavour.  A quirky thing i'd like to point out is the soap. Absolutely love the scent! Been trying to find the scent everywhere for years but couldn't; it's like a nice berry fruity mix. If anyone knows where I can get the soap, please let me know :P"}
{"text":"Frites alors !!!! Très bon restaurant ou leurs Poutine et leurs burgers sont délicieux, service est très bon, les bières sont en bouteille mais bon c'est correct !  Ensuite les prix sont raisonnables je conseil vivement \"Frites alors ! \" de la rue st Denis"}
{"text":"This place has such a cool vibe! Once I got there, i was seated to my table and it was lunch time, the waitress gave me the 2 menus.   Scanned through it and they have so many options and different varieties which was great! I fancied for the Nachos Fries. My food got to my table within couple of minutes. To my surprise, the portions are definitely abundant and huge. I wasn't able to finish them all and had to opt for take out. The Nachos Fries were a success. Love the fact that they give you lots of sauces like guacamole, salsa as well as sour cream which gave it the Mexican tang to the fries. Fries were very well done but greasy.   For $9.20 included taxes for the portion of Nachos Fries, I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to try new flavours and if you're a Fries lover, this will definitely change your mind as you're gonna enjoy it! The service was fast and nice.   I'd recommend it to all."}
{"text":"Pour vrai, les meilleures frites de Montréal!!! Et leur sauce \"Frite alors\" épicée les accompagne parfaitement! Les burgers sont pas si pire mais j'ai connu mieux... C'est bon, rapide pas loin de chez moi, donc pratique en cas d'une envie de frites burger que je dois combler au plus vite!"}
{"text":"Just get the fries based dishes here. Other things just look kinda sad. The thick fries in our poutine stayed crispy even under all the gravy and cheese all the way to the end. Poutine tasted great. Gravy had some nice flavor without being too salty.  The large size of the poutines are good enough for 2 as a meal.  Service was a tad slow."}
{"text":"I would like to give 2.5 stars but I will give them the benefit of the doubt.  The food was good, my poutine was excellent, my friend had no complaints about his grilled cheese. But the portions are very small and the prices are very high. A small poutine and a bottle of St. Ambroise came to $12 PLUS tax and tip! That, in my mind, is outrageous.  The service was a little slow, but when we finally got served, the waiter was totally friendly and helpful. I wish the guy behind the counter would stop whistling and singing along with the music, it made it hard to carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"Great poutines - interesting to have it served on a metal bowl. It was piping hot and somewhat hard to eat but very delicious.  Great service from the waiter as well.  The gravy is however very salty than usual.  Recommended for late night snacks."}
{"text":"This was my second time here. The service is decent and our waiter was nice. It's a huge space so a good place to go with a group.  I got the avocado & beef patty burger, which was good but messy. It comes on a ciabatta bread with tomato and mayo. On the bland side though, it needed some spice. The fries were so limp and oily that they were un-dippable!! Let's just say this was a very messy and unglamourous meal. I needed about 10 napkins to clean up the mess from the sauce dripping from the burger and the oily fries that kept slipping out of my hands. The fish burger that my sis got was even worse, dripping from the second she picked it up! She says their poutines are better and less messy.  At $36 for two, I think I'll go to Five Guys next time!"}
{"text":"Great place to experience Canadian poutine.  Where else can one get pulled duck on poutine and, most importantly, General Tao's chicken on poutine? This is the future people."}
{"text":"Frite-Alors has a following, although sometimes I wonder why...  The portions are small, the food is meh and the fries - their namesake - are barely decent...all this for a large price tag and below average service make this a no-go.  I would only consider returning if it was for a friend's birthday and they chose the place.  Overrated."}
{"text":"Poutine and beer - great combination. The fries are probably the best fries I've had in a poutine. I've had better gravy but don't be mistaken that it's still tasty. Open late on weekends. I had the one with pulled pork on it, the sauce on it was very tangy and complimented the gravy-cheese curds combination. Casual small place but great food."}
{"text":"I have been to other Frites Alors, but not this one until now.  The good: Food is above average. Waiter was friendly. Nice presentation of food. Good price vs quality.  The bad: Wobbly tables and wobbly chairs. Very noisy (we were there at lunch). Not much space to move around the tables. Entrance looks like an old abandoned place.  This wouldn't be my first choice to go eat again, but I would follow friends if we all decide to go there."}
{"text":"We wanted poutine.  None of the reviews around the hotel we were staying in were raving.  Here, they should have been.  Aside from the fact that the waitress stopped speaking to me in French the moment she realized it wasn't my first language, and the completely nonsensical comics about colonialism on the walls, this place was everything we were looking for, and so much more-- especially quantity-wise.  My boyfriend got a veggie burger, which is always geocached away in Montreal, and it was delicious.  The salad it came with had a bizarre mustardy dressing, but who eats salad when you get a GIANT TERRINE OF POUTINE?  We got the one with mushrooms, onions, and peppers (asked for no bacon), and attacked it.  The gravy was hearty, and the mixture of soggy fries with crispy ones-- could I make it sound any tastier?-- was unlike anything we can get in California.  I'm completely unclear why.  The mushrooms were a brilliant addition, too.  We were hurtin after we downed the entire thing, in the best of ways.  And despite all the warnings, I have yet to have a heart attack.  I'll keep you posted."}
{"text":"Frite Alors was the perfect ending to a 4.5 hour drive to Montreal. We found this spot via Yelp because we wanted to try poutine, and it was close to our hotel. Upon reading reviews, we weren't entirely sure what to think of it but decided to try it out anyways. We got the regular poutine and the parigot burger which had Brie and apples ontop. Both were amazing and I would definitely come back here if I ever find myself in Montreal again"}

{"text":"My boyfriend and I stayed downtown for a little weekend getaway and we stumbled upon this place one evening.   Our drinks were yummy (Caesar and Sex on the Beach) and our food was delicious! The fries were seasoned perfectly (highly addictive) and you get to choose your own house-made dipping sauce. I am a vegetarian and there were plenty of good sandwich options for me, which was nice. The house salad was also amazing! We loved it so much, we went back the next day for lunch.   Service was fast and everyone was very welcoming and friendly. A great downtown spot for quality and well-priced food and drinks."}
{"text":"Visiting Canada, I just had to have poutine. All of them are excellent. They also have a wide variety of beers. I had to try the Quebec brews while there.  On Sundays, they are understaffed and very busy. I had a long wait."}
{"text":"Waaaaaaaaay overrated. Here's the breakdown; half decent fries, very greasy burgers, sausages in a hot dog bun, and a handful of fatty mayo based dipping sauces. None of this is exceptional. And you WILL leave this poorly ventilated restaurant smelling like grease. that alone is enough to stay away."}
{"text":"This was my first poutine experience and Frite Alors! delivered admirably.   We shared the La Frite Alors!,  La Cochonne and La Montrealaise.   All 3 were obviously similar - a smorgasbord of French Fries drenched in a delicious gravy and cheese curds. I thought the Frite Alors! stood out the most, as the thick cut small bacon bites were to die for.   The wildcard at Frite Alors! were the Mussels. GET THESE. The vodka sauce they were served in was so good, I found myself using the shell as a spoon to drink as a soup. We devoured these quickly and most agreed they were the highlight of the meal.   Overall - I would recommend Frite Alors! to any large group visiting Montreal, especially if they are looking for a fun, accommodating, traditional poutine affair."}
{"text":"We had heard that you can't visit Montreal without trying frites, and this was a recommended place. They were very good, and Frites Alors offered a variety of sauces for us to sample. Our server was also very friendly and, recognizing we were from out of town, spent time explaining the menu and our meal to us."}
{"text":"From our friends who live in town, we learned there's a lot of conflict over what's the best poutine in Montreal. One of those friends swears by Frite Alors, so B and I hit them up after an afternoon of beer and cocktails, and split a poutine La Cochonne and a basket of fries with a handful of sauces on the side. It was perfect-- it ended up basically being dinner, but it was the greatest post-drunk-buzz food, and didn't leave us feeling super heavy full afterward either. A+, would poutine again."}
{"text":"Our waitress was great so I wish I could give this place more stars. We had a large poutine with bacon, peppers, onions, and mushrooms which was good. Things went wrong with our appetizer plate and my drink. The fried pickles were so salty that we had to remove the breading to eat them.   Everything that was fried was extremely dark in color which leads me to suspect the oil used was old. I had a pink lemonade alcoholic drink which I forget the name of but not only was there barely any alcohol in it, the juice part itself was watered down. The presentation was pretty but the taste itself was disappointing."}
{"text":"I had a very lovely meal here. The place was packed for a Friday lunch. We got to our table and the service was very good! We kindly asked for some English menus and definitely went straight to the poutines. Since this is something very uncommon in the states, I just had to try it,   I ordered the lobster poutine: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=O1ANCUUIoSMPigAujSO-4Q  Holy crap, the dish was delicious. I would never have thought to put lobster with fries and sauce...but it worked. The sauce that was laid over the dish was creamy and delicious. Loved every bit of it.   I would suggest coming in early to beat the crowd and just enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Ce n'est pas la première fois que je mange dans un \"frite alors\"... Mais, là, franchement... Une serveuse seule, alors que c'est Montréal en lumière, le lieu est bruyant les frite sont hyper cuites (trop), hyper grasses (trop), le hamburger passe encore... Et le dessert...un fondant au chocolat, trop cuit, en fait il s'agit d'un gâteau spongieux, posé sur une rondelle de chocolat sensée être fondue, mais disent plutôt que la rondelle était trop cuite (elle aussi), rien à voir avec la photo sur la carte d'un fondant au cur coulant... Bref, je pense qu'avec un peu plus de management et de personnes en sale, cela aurait pu être mieux... Ah oui, le sourire, c'est juste au moment de l'encaissement de la facture... En même temps, elle est à moitié pardonnée. La digestion est difficile (on s'y deux à en souffrir...)."}
{"text":"Un restaurant qui fait parti d'une chaîne belge... Dans un décor façon BD, l'accueil est chaleureux.  Vous y mangerez donc des frites !!!  Servies dans un panier avec un accompagnement (bah oui, les frites, c'est le plat principal). Large choix d'hambourgeois et de sous-marins. Des sauces maisons (en partie de la maison du rôti).  On y trouve aussi différentes poutines. Pour les grands et les petits, tout le monde est ravie !  (Peut-être une terrasse, l'été, lors de festivals sur le Boulevard Saint-Laurent)."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a quick bite to eat for lunch. I started off with some wings, which were cooked perfectly, crispy, and only $5 for six wings. Then I decided to have the lunch special poutine, which was topped with smoked meat. The smoked meat was a little skimpy (possibly because it was a lunch special) but tasted fine nonetheless. The atmosphere was nice as well. Overall, a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Frites Alore is a local fast food chain.  Chains I tend to avoid, but this chain has some real simple things that are good going for it.  First, the fries are quite tasty.  They are not overcooked or undercooked and they crackle and have a great fatty texture and savory flavor. Second, There are many sauces that come with them. Tartare is very original, and any of the mayo based ones will not fail either. Third, this place is also very inexpensive.  And fourth they of course have poutine which is large and plentiful, and while I've had my share of pountines in the past (such as the famous one at Au Pied), one here will be satisfactory enough as it is and they have several different kinds.  It's a fast food joint, the service is a little indifferent, the floor was probably not that clean or swept recently before you walked in chances are, but it's a great simple place to get a cheap bite."}
{"text":"POUTINE. Obviously, a must-do in Montreal.  Frite Alors is a chain with an outpost within walking distance from our hotel, making it the perfect midday beer and fries stop while basking in the afternoon sun. My personal take on poutine is that there's no need to dress it up with anything fancy. It's best as the Nordiques made it - simply-done frites, thick brown gravy, and gluttonous cheese curds. Don't dress it up with sweet potato tots, bison sauce, or havarti melts.  As such, the absolute best thing you can order at Frite Alors is La Vladimir, the \"regularly\" done poutine with no additional accoutrements. It looks plain and tastes great. The group ordered some other poutines that were totally skippable.  Their regular fries are done well, too, if you prefer the dipping methodology. There are a boatload of sauces to pick from and I honestly don't remember what we chose (Maybe the simple aioli? Or the Bearnaise?) but I remember it being good. There's a small patio outside that we promptly commandeered, and yes, a nice selection of Canadian beers awaited."}
{"text":"Being located 140 feet from the dance studio where I practiced for 7+ hours was a plus. Someone had recommended this spot to me, so it was an easy decision to check poutine off my todo list. My only wish now was to read my wife's old review and maybe try another place during my short 2 day visit.   Pluses: easy to read menu, friendly customer service, felt that the gravy was light and not too overwhelming, squeaky cheese.   Minuses: more gravy toward the bottom with mushier fries.  Next time, I think I want to go with a local or someone more acquainted with poutine. I'm still a novice and learning."}
{"text":"Place was empty. Good. Poutine was delicious. Good. The poutine was hefty. Good.  Beer came in three different sizes, 12 oz being the smallest and worth $4. SO if you don't want a whole pint, you can save $3. They don't have that in the states.   Service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Cute lil place! Tourist worthy decor yet authentic dishes that entertain both locals and out-of-towns. Offered a good variety of poutines, we tried the original poutine and the Montrealise sandwich, both of which were delicious."}
{"text":"I would give less than one star if I could.   The fries are not great (taste just like basic Swiss Chalet fries...go to Five Guys a few doors down and the fries are unfortunately substantially better); and the service is so incredibly rude. My partner was snapped at with the most condescending tone by a woman with white/blonde and purple hair, because he didn't speak French. She had such an attitude problem, and my partner is not one to ever complain about anything. He was genuinely shook up by her demeanour. We are in Downtown Montreal, the tourist hub in the whole city...calm down, and recognize that tons of people don't speak French! Rest assured, fellow tourists, most establishments in Montreal are not like this and many people are very kind about the language barrier.   Lastly, for a place that specializes in fries and dipping mayos for said fries, you'd think they would invest in proper packaging with lids? Our takeout order was disgusting with sauce everywhere - ugh!   Do yourself a favour and avoid this place at all costs. There are so many better MTL restaurants around that will offer friendly service and a good product."}
{"text":"Had a large fry here with some sort of mayo based sauce.  The order was up in just a moment and delivered promptly, so the service was A-Okay.  The fries on the other hand were decent but not great.  Maybe I was left with the bottom of the bag or something but it seemed like I was just getting pieces of fries.  Once I dug in to them they started to get a little mushy.  The sauce lacked flavor and I was given just a tiny little paper cup full.  There's lots more better food options in the area so I can't really recommend this place.  I was expecting Dutch style fries, but Frites Alors just doesn't quite deliver."}
{"text":"I am no expert on poutine, but I thought it was very good.  I had that and the vienna sausage, which was also tasty.  I would definitely go back for the poutine though."}
{"text":"Je n'encouragerai pas ce genre d'entreprise qui met une employée (Morgane Mary-Pouliot) à la porte pour le simple fait d'avoir donné une interview à La Presse où elle expliquait pourquoi elle militait pour l'implantation d'un syndicat dans l'entreprise où elle travaille.   Congédier unE employéE pour activités syndicales est illégal au Québec. Constituer une association et la mandater pour négocier de meilleures conditions de travail avec le patron est un droit. Si Frites Alors! veut jour à Wallmart sur le plateau, il va trouver chaussure à son pied."}
{"text":"Un endroit rêvé sur la rue Saint-Denis, tout près de l'UQAM, du CÉGEP du Vieux-Montréal et de la Grande-Bibliothèque.   Mettant en vedette une certaine belgitude, vous ne serez pas surpris de voir que la décoration est inspirée des bandes dessinés belges.   Les bières belges sont à l'honneur ainsi que les bières locales produites par des micro-brasserie.   Comme repas, le hamburger accompagné de frites (à la belge, bien sûr) y est à l'honneur. Notons qu'il y a sur le menu un steak tartare fait avec de la viande chevaline."}
{"text":"Have traveled the US 50 States, I can say Canada is beautiful. Frite Alors is great, the Poutine is awesome and I am thankful for the staff for being so friendly and courteous. Food is great and staff made it taste better."}
{"text":"Their smoked meat sandwich is amazing. I found it to be the perfect balance of the rich Montreal smoked meat and the tanginess of the mustard and sour pickle, albeit I prefer my food slightly more tangy than most people I've noticed. Their fries are absolutely amazing, definitely top tier in terms of texture and taste. Their pistou-rose sauce goes AMAZING with the fries. I know their american sauce is probably their most popular, but you'll really love the pistou-rose if you try it. Thank me later ;)"}
{"text":"Actually the best poutine I've had in Montreal.  Delicious lobster poutine under $10, From the outside you could miss it but you just need to go down some stairs and you're there.   Quick pleasant service"}
{"text":"This was our first stop after dropping our things off at the hostel.  I wants me some 11pm fries + cheese curds + gravy!  The Frite Alors ($8.50) is topped with mushrooms, bacon, and onions. The Tunisienne ($9) was better, smothered in crumbled spicy merguez. Ohhhh poutine. After a long, foodless train ride, this Montreal favorite did the trick for filling our bellies with greasy, comforting goodness - though I really, really wished the toppings were hotter.   A \"small\" size is heavy enough to be a meal for one person. I finished an order all by myself, and consequently felt like I hated everything and wanted to lie down.   The food was 3 stars - try the Tunisienne. I'm giving 4 stars because our waiter was insanely friendly and helpful. He gave us food and beer suggestions and we got to try some local Quebec brews immediately! Blanche de Chambly is good if you like light, citrusy Belgians. Dieu du Ciel's coffee stout was... very, very dark. $5.50 for a bottle of 9.5% ABV beer? Okay!"}
{"text":"I visited Canada and ate here. It was fucking great. Poutine is delicious and alcoholic root beer is like grown up candy. Will go back."}
{"text":"Best Poutine!!! This is, hands down, the best place to grab a Poutine. They serve their Poutine on Belgium fries which elevates it to the next level. The fries alone are delicious!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good few years ago, but not anymore. The food quality is comparable only to a cheap fast food chain, but it does not get ready fast. They prioterize Foodora orders and let other customers wait and wait. The fries are made with frozen potatoes, the burger patty was small and almost burned, and it was not served in a burger bun."}
{"text":"Frites alors = poutine w bacon, onions and mushrooms. Greasy, cheesy and heavily gravied, smothered with fatty bacon and sauteed onions. Not meant to be eaten on a regular basis but good enough for a tourist with an iron stomach."}
{"text":"Poutine fries are what Montreal are all about and I liked these.  If you don't know what Poutine is, it's cheese curds and gravy on fries.  Its delicious.  The burger was satisfactory but not worth it by itself.  The pretty girl and her personality brought the meal up a notch."}
{"text":"Well, what can I say  The fries are served \"Poutine Style\" (kind of mushy but tasty), and the Mexican sauce for fries has a nice spiciness to it. Proudly spicy.  The burguers are nicely done as well, nothing too exiting but it's honest."}
{"text":"Hungry after the 6 hour drive, we walked down to Rue Saint-denis for some poutine since it was near our hotel.  Waitress with friendly (this was our first restaurant experience in Montréal).  I ordered the poutine with the caramelized onions and merguez sausage.  The bf ordered just the classic poutine.  To complete the meal we ordered a pitcher or Boreale.  I wanted the Boreale noir, but the waitress said they were out, so the lager it was.  The poutine was very tasty.  The curds were hot gooey, and the sausage added a nice savory element to mine.  Overall, we were both pleased.  The petite portions were still pretty large and satisfying, so we ended up skipping dinner that night after this late afternoon snack."}
{"text":"This was our first poutine spot and it was awesome! We had the smoked meat poutine and plain poutine. Both were very good!   Make this your first stop in Montreal!!"}
{"text":"One of my all-time favourite poutine spots in the world. Nothing has beat this spot yet."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Tuesday afternoon for a quick lunch and it was what we came for. I got a salad which was a very good size for the price and my friend got a burger with the poutine. This was my first time having poutine so I do not have much to compare it to, but it was great! They offer many options of poutine which if I had more time I would of tried, but I stuck with the classic one. The drink options are also great for a quick lunchtime break. The server was friendly as well. He gave us a site with things to do in Montreal and recommended two craft beer places for us to check out."}
{"text":"We came here pretty hungry after a heavy night out of drinking in the Montreal town. We were walking along the street of St. Denis looking for burger type places besides McDonald's. So we found this place on a rainy early afternoon. Although the place was pretty much dead with only a few patrons, we didn't care cause we were so hungry.   Anyways the hot waitress seated us promptly. I'm not sure if it's Montreal but almost all of the waitress seems to be cute and hot at the same time. Anyways, the best thing about this place is the Poutine, it's basically french fries mixed with a smooth creamy texture gravy sauce added with bits and pieces of mozzarella cheese. It is absolutely to die for this dish. The burgers were pretty good too as the meat was tasty and the buns were a bit different than the usual sesame seed buns that Americans use.   Overall, a very good lunch after heavy drinking nights."}
{"text":"Mon resto favori pour une bonne poutine. Bien sûr, il y a autre chose sur le menu, mais malgré les dizaines de fois où j'y suis allée, je n'ai rien essayer d'autre que la poutine. Plusieurs choix, mais ma préféré est la Frite Alors! que j'accompagne d'une petite mayonnaise maison aromatisée. Selon moi dans les tops des poutineries de Montréal."}
{"text":"The fries were somewhat disappointing,  especially if you've had pommes frites at other locations.  For me,  Belgian fries have a distinctive,  specific taste that it seems these does lacked.  However,  my group was blown away by the quality of the burgers and sandwiches.  Simply excellent,  with great speciality buns.  The servers are all extremely helpful.  Warning  for vegetarians,  fries cooked in beef fat."}
{"text":"Okay the fries with different sauces are actually good, I enjoy their unique sauce options with plain fries."}
{"text":"In search of poutine. Showed up at 10:35pm. Restaurant was 95% full. They decided to shut down early because they were too full. Usually closes at 11pm.  Strange, why would a business turn away revenue."}
{"text":"If you are a foodie in Montreal, you'll definitely be eating poutine.  Allow me to make the case that you should have it at Frite Alors: - The fries are crispy and delicious even with the cheese and gravy!  This alone makes a huge difference and was the single biggest factor in my decision to list this as a \"best ever.\"  Other places that are otherwise decent (including Belle Provence and even the famous Au Pied de Cochon) don't get this right, leading to a soggy experience. - They get the ratio right!  Enough cheese curds leads to a rich enough, delicious experience all the way through. - They serve them in a bowl!  Serving poutine on a plate is an unfortunately common mistake, allowing heat to escape without really preventing sogginess.  They offer a few \"varieties\" of poutine now, and we tried several.  The Moroccan one was good but the classic  / original is still the way to go.  BEST X AARON'S EVER HAD WINNER: POUTINE"}
{"text":"Good burgers and fries. The blue cheese burger is excellent. The buns are great as well. The outdoor/street side seating was good for summertime dinners. The service was good. I was less impressed with the sauces. However the fries were so good that sauces were unnecessary."}
{"text":"My first poutine in Quebec came from Frite Alors. While walking to my work activities, I kept noticing their cute sign since it seemed like the fries were screaming \"frite alors!\" at me. When the server came by, I asked her what her favorite poutine was and she quickly and confidently responded with the taco poutine (ground beef, spices, grilled onions, avocados, tomatoes, sour cream, Mexican spicy sauce and nachos). My colleague ordered the la cochonne (fatty bacon and onion, fun fact: I found out cochonne means whore).   My favorite loaded fries type-a dish is carne asada fries from San Diego, which consist of crispy fries (thinner than what you'd find in poutine) topped with guacamole, sour cream, carne asada (steak), pico de gallo, salsa, and shredded cheese. The fries are served hot, so if you keep the to-go box closed for a minute, the cheese will melt deliciously on top.  Overall, the fries were a great consistency but I'm not sure if the blend of flavors with the taco poutine work for me. It reminds me of a Canadian version of carne asada fries, which just meant a thicker fry and gravy and cheese curds added to the above toppings. I wasn't crazy about the gravy flavors combined with the Mexican \"spicy\" sauce (salsa) and the texture of the curds was a little out of place. I put the spicy in quotations because for my spice lovers, it wasn't very spicy at all. I loved the cochonne though! The bacon and the onions were delicious with the fries and the curds.   RESULTS: - For me, this place is a 3.5 rounded up to 4. I would take my review with a grain of salt though because I have not eaten poutine many times in my life.  - Good place for poutine (though, not the best) and the cocktails are reasonably priced.  - Quick and kind service!"}
{"text":"Well, this was the first stop on our vacation & it was truly a disappointment. The menus were sticky & my drink did not match the menu. Our waitress probably spoke to us four times & each time she did not want to. Once when we sat down, the second time when our food came, the third time when my food order was completely wrong. I informed the waitress, she grabbed my burger with her bare hands & carried it back to the kitchen. Five minutes later she came back with the same exact burger, I know because I asked for no Swiss cheese & no mushrooms. She placed another piece of cheese on top of the Swiss & scrapped the mushrooms off....I couldn't even eat it. The fourth time she spoke to us was for the bill which was way overpriced! Thus being said, I will not return! Did I mention the poutine had no seasoning & was below average. There's plenty of other places in Montreal to eat where the food & service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Poutine! I love poutine. Carbs (potato), fat (cheese curds), and protein (cheese curds and if you add a topping of real meat). What is there not to like?  I got the poutine topped with pulled pork. The pulled pork was cooked and sauced excellently. At no point did I feel the pork was dry. They used some kind of sweet sauce, which combined with the poutine's gravy to make a sort of sweet poutine, which is unlike any other poutine I've had before. Would I have it again? Probably not, but that's just because I prefer salty poutine.  The fries were cooked Belgian-style, which in my opinion is the only valid way to do fries for poutine. (Thin fries, e.g. McDonalds, don't hold up well to gravy.) The fries were cooked very nicely, with a very crisp exterior and a soft interior that wasn't undercooked."}
{"text":"This was, without a doubt, the most over hyped, over priced, and under-satisfying poutine in all of Montreal.    With so many options, there's no need to stop here for even a second.  Think of this as the McDonalds of Poutine, but then imagine it priced at the level of fine dining.  If you find yourself here, do yourself a favour and walk away.  There are other alternatives within a two block radius, I assure you."}
{"text":"The poutine here is pretty good. I got the large poutine with sliced sausage on it. The large is huge it's really bigger than it looks. The service here is alright overall not a bad place to eat."}
{"text":"This was my first poutine experience. The food was really great, the waiter was extremely friendly and suggested we order the Montréal. The Montréal was covered in gravy, meat and of course, cheese curds. I think I enjoyed the cheese curds more than anything. I learned that you must eat the poutine quickly because towards the end of the meal, the fries were soggy and therefore, not as tasty. The dish was big enough to split between two people. The atmosphere at this spot is super cool and I enjoyed their selection of local craft beers. I recommend checking out this spot, especially if you're a poutine virgin. However, I cannot speak for those that are poutine veterans because I'm not sure how the fare matches up to other poutine delights."}
{"text":"Jai commandé des frites, et on m'a servit de l'huile recouvert de frites. On a apparement pas le temps de les essorer. L'endroit est ordinaire. Je deconseille la bouffe."}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal earlier this week with my wife and we went to this Frites Alors location - largely because we had walked by this and other locations and were intrigued by the concept.  Upon arriving, we were greeted warmly in both official languages.  After being seated, our server - who also spoke to us in both official languages - was very prompt and taking our drink order. After bringing the drinks, he was quite helpful in terms of answering questions about the menu.  The meal itself was delicious. The poutine here was some of the best that we have ever had, and their sandwiches were quite good as well.  We will definitely be back on our next trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Montreal, this is one of the larger locations of Frite Alors. Quick seating available but service is a tad slow. If you're looking for poutine galore, this is the place to go. Just don't expect fast food; just clogged arteries after your meal, lol!"}
{"text":"The Fries here are totally delicious! Very broad range of dips and sauces - i like that! Also, they offer a selection of craft beer in three different sizes.  In the Summer, you can sit outside on theit neat porch. Staff is friendly and the shirts are funny. I can't really complain. Despite the fact, that they don't offer a vegetarian poutine. I was really craving for one. But the fries and the ipa was good too!"}
{"text":"Poutine was tasty and budget friendly. My salmon burger was ok too.  Casual place to grab a bite while shopping."}
{"text":"While spending a perfect day in Montreal, kids and us wanted poutine. Walking by the menu caught our eye. Looked tasty! Walked down the stairs to the casual yet sports bar atmosphere made for a relaxing place to rest our feet. We ordered the large classic poutine and large fries with a special mayo: mayo, ketchup, spices. The gravy was savory with a hint of spice while the fries with the special mayo were super yummy. The portion sizes with the large was enough for a family of four to get satisfied. Excellent choice for a restful bite or even a meal."}
{"text":"Toujours un plaisir de manger un bon burger et une frite chez Frite Alors!  Les meilleures frites. Et un service pas crispé et authentique.   Sans doute le meilleur endroit pour manger vite et sainement !"}
{"text":"A very decent option for poutine.  Lots of varieties, and use a crispy peanut-oil french fry as the base for the toppings (the crunch allows the fries to survive intact).  Subtracted a point because there was some kind of caterpillar on the table - ick.    I'd highly recommend they install a take-out window, because cones of frites are very enjoyable on the go - can't believe they need to be told this."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. It was quite yummy. I had pulled pork sandwich with their famous fries and 2 different dipping sauces and I really enjoyed it. I would go back"}
{"text":"Such yummy poutine. It's such big portion-- I wish I could have shared it with someone. I think I ate half of it and was done. The drawback was that they charged extra for me to box up the food, but I guess you have to make sacrifices for future promises of yumminess I guess."}
{"text":"Came here for my first taste of poutine and was not disappointed. The staff were very friendly and considerate. The food was perfect. I wish I lived in Montreal, I'd go here every week!"}
{"text":"Oy! Another burger another disappointment.  The old lady said it best... WHERE'S THE BEEF? Right sized burger but it was probably a 10/1 patty. The rest was all condiments and sauces. The bun was pretty good though, a would-be Ciabatta bread but not as dense or tough. Some spanky sauce, over-dilled dill pickles. And Emmental? Really? All the topings were so overpowering that I couldn't even taste the patty, it's like the main component of the burger was a mere afterthought.   The poutine... I asked for a small poutine and yet it was a meal in itself.  It was ok but as a non-traditional poutine goes, they need to go to La Banquise and study up. Burger meat, onions, and shrooms. But a lot of Meh also. It was OK but not very impressive. Although my friend's pull-pork poutine was pretty tasty though.   BONUS: Large selection of Steward's pop."}
{"text":"Frite Alors is a great poutine joint all year round. The fries are amazing and the toppings are well varied. Their amazing range of unique sauces is what has us coming back again and again. The St. Catherine location often has special poutines such as the Lobster poutine or Italian poutine. :)"}
{"text":"I've visit this chain multiple times on my visit to Montreal. This was the first stop when my boyfriend and I arrived and it'll stay in our heart.   Cute little \"fast food\" chain even though there's nothing fast food about it. Serves a wide variety of burgers and poutine. Gosh, their fries are to die for. Absolutely best fries I have ever had, the best!   We ordered the Le Rudolph Burger (reindeer burger indeed, unless you want to call it caribou) and the Toulouse Sausage which was made of garlic and white wine. The caribou burger was really good, the meat patty was cooked nicely and was really tender. Didn't take too much chewing for a burger. The sausage was on the bland side, tasted quite healthy which is the total opposite of what I had in mind when it comes to sausages. But the fries, whoaaa... the best thing on earth. Light and crispy, even after an hour of sitting there eating, the fries were still light and crispy... how does that work?!   Service was alright, waiter was friendly and helped us with some things on the menu. The atmosphere was trendy and chic, definitely for the young crowd. Luh-uv this place."}
{"text":"Early morning, what's better than a quite bite at Frite Alors. My boyfriend and I finally had our first taste of poutine in Montreal. We ordered the classic poutine and ate it on the go since we had quite a number of destinations to hit up. Hot poutine in the morning is amazing. Fries, gravy and cheese curds is just the perfect match made. I liked how the gravy tasted, light and definitely not to overwhelmingly salty. Pair it with the fries and cheese and I was having an early morning orgasm in my mouth.   So far, the best poutine I had in Montreal. But I certainly will keep looking."}
{"text":"Universitaires, musique des années 90, burger généreux et frite Belge. Un classique!"}
{"text":"Frite Alors was a solid choice for a casual family meal with kids in tow. The atmosphere has a food-court vibe that doesn't encourage you to linger, but the food was good and the server helpful. It was a good way for our group to try poutine during our trip, and my pulled duck grilled cheese was excellent. Would recommend for a quick meal with a group if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Yummy poutines! So many to choose on the menu. They also have grass fed beef. Yum twice"}
{"text":"Traveling from Western USA, really wanted to have the Montreal experience. Frites Alors did not disappoint. We were immediately greeted by a friendly bilingual waitress that asked if we wanted English menus, or French. My son studied French, so I made him get the French one ;)   I had no idea poutine came so many different ways. This place must have a great reputation too, cause when I asked a store manager about 2 blocks away, he had a menu behind his own counter for it!  The decor is very casual, but clean. There are paper placemats and crayons on every table to help you while you wait, although, the wait was not long at all.   I highly recommend this place if you want good value for your dollar."}
{"text":"After a long night out, it's good to roll out if bed and slam some poutine down before continuing on your drinking tour. Great place for food and reasonable portions for the price."}
{"text":"J'ai pris le menu midi de 10 dollars: un chien chaud d'icitte, un petit frite avec sauce et un liqueur. Le hot-dog était un peu messy mais généralement délicieux et un bon prix."}
{"text":"Good burger, great poutine. (Add $2.00) seems clean, friendly waitress, speaks English and French too."}
{"text":"My poutine was sub par. A few of the fries were burnt completely black. The staff was super friendly and helpful though. I find the price a little high for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Duck Poutine with Rib Gravy and an IPA. Overall, it was some great rainy weather, but nothing to call home about. Great customer service too!"}
{"text":"This is a nice, big space, and table service is our preferred mode of ordering in a non-English language, as I get stressed out trying to speak French with other people behind me, potentially impatient, while I try to string together words. So, it's a good mix of fast food and regular resto.  We had a poutine, a grilled cheese with apple and honey, and a side of fries with mielnaisse (honey mayo) between three of us. The grilled cheese was a little too much bread for the other ingredients, but the fries were perfect -- fairly thin, good and greasy without being gross, hot and fresh.  The bathrooms in the back are Asian-themed with different Asian characters on each door. This was a little stressful - going from French/English to Asian. Still not sure if they are actually men's/women's or unisex, but I'm going to assume the latter. Clearly not worth docking them stars, but it was funny watching a little girl (maybe seven) walk to the bathrooms and then yell for her dad in a worried voice to come and help her choose which bathroom she was supposed to use.  Getting our check was slow, but this may just be a Montreal on the weekend thing, because the same was true at every restaurant we tried. Overall, it's just what you want (or what I want, at least) from a poutine/fry place."}
{"text":"I came here while searching for a Poutine place in Downtown Montreal that would be open on the later side of a Wednesday night.  Convenient to my hotel (which meant a short walk through the snow), Frites Alors felt oversized, if anything.  With tens of tables free occupied by just a small scattering of young locals and visitors, it made my solo dining experience feel even more lonely.  But it didn't really matter: they have beer, poutine, and hockey on TV.  I ordered the Montreal poutine, a standard poutine but topped with smoked meat.  It was good, not great.  The meat didn't really taste like anything or add any flavor to the dish, and the cheese curds stayed pretty solid the whole time.  Fries and gravy were solid though; but I've had better.  The service was fine, no complaints, and for what it is, the price is about right (I probably should have just opted for traditional poutine in retrospect).  I guess this is convenient if you're looking for Poutine downtown and it's part of a chain, which could explain the quality and what not.  It's not good, but it's not bad.  It's totally fine for what it is."}
{"text":"Poutine is a French-Canadian dish of French fries and fresh cheese curds, covered with brown gravy or sauce.    Ugggh, I think I just gained 5 pounds writing that but OF COURSE, you can't come to Montreal and not have any!  So we ended up at Frite Alors.  This was my first Poutine experience so I'm going to go with three stars.  I ordered the traditional which was just cheese and gravy.  The cheese is not melted, it comes in a curd form (see pics).  It was good but obviously very filling.....great for sharing and great for after hours.  My favorite part is the GRAVY.....oh my lawd, so good.  The cheese, was just ok.  It didn't really do much for me in the curd form."}
{"text":"Cool place on Sainte-Catherine St that we tried for lunch. I got the traditional poutine which I heard good things about but I wasn't too impressed. The gravy was overpowering  and I wasn't about to really get the taste of the cheese and fries together.  I had a great strawberry (fraise) milkshake though.   Still seems like a good place to grab a quick meal while shopping Sainte-Catherine.  3 stars."}
{"text":"On a 7 day vacation to montreal, I had poutine 6 of those 7 days. And the smoked meat poutine at Frite Alors was the best that I had."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic no-fuss no-muss poutine, this is the place our Quebecois friends swear by.  And it did not disappoint.  Frites Alors is a chain with locations along the hip streets of Montreal; this location on Rue Saint Laurent was convenient and close to other well-known Montreal eateries like Schwartz's Deli and a Juliette et Chocolat branch.  First, Frites Alors endeared itself to me by using a font from Tintin comics, and the perfect aroma of well-cooked and seasoned fries that enveloped us upon entering.  The standard poutine is Le Vladimir (a nice pun on the name \"Putin\"); unfortunately there is a poutine named after George Bush with steak (please change the name, Frites!).  We each had a Stewart's Cherry Soda and La Frites Alors Poutine, with peppers, onions, and mushrooms.  The veloute and fries and cheese curds tasted great together.  The cheese especially was so authentic.  Don't order anything bigger than a small unless you're sharing."}
{"text":"Like everyone says, POUTINE. and lots of choices. Good service, good beer and poutine. Yum."}
{"text":"The guys who work here are pretty nice, but the food is as mediocre as it gets. I had the Vege Burger and La Vladimir (Poutine). Granted this is my first time having Poutine, hence nothing to compare it with but it was just okay and the gravy was a bit salty for me. However I've had many veggie burgers in my lifetime and this one lands way at the bottom of the veggie burger hierachy."}
{"text":"Out of all the poutine I tried in Montreal, this one was my favorite. We ordered the poutine that came with steak, mushrooms, and onions and it was sinfully delicious: crisp fried potatoes, savory gravy, squeaky fresh curds, and seared meat! I wish I ordered another poutine instead of the burger, which was actually kinda dry to me.  Too bad, I can't find decent fresh curd where I am in the states."}
{"text":"The service can be hit or miss depending on the day.  The poutine is pretty good and I'd definitely recommend getting the small one because it is more than enough for a meal.  When it comes to choosing among the burgers and sandwiches it really depends on what you choose.  The grilled cheese was pretty lacklustre and it hadn't been grilled long enough for all the cheese to melt.  The Texan Burger is very good and it is worth getting as is the European Hot Dog.  I always get the aioli sauce to go with the fries as I'm a big fan of it."}
{"text":"This is not a review of Frite Alors on St Denis or St Laurent, because those locations are terrific, 5 stars.  This review goes to this St Catherine's location. While the waitress was very friendly and did a great job, we had a pretty bad experience. One of our orders was wrong (a burger drowned in mustard when it was requested without sauce). As soon as my friend finished scraping it off his bun, we hear some cheering and the whole staff is gathered around in the back taking shots. Have fun on a Friday, whatever, but take care of your work first! One of the meals ended in a gastric exorcism, which is not what I ever want to expect from my otherwise favorite french fry place! I'm not giving up on Frite Alors, but I'll definitely always be taking the trip to the Latin quarter."}
{"text":"Delicious. We ordered the lobster poutine and it was very yummy. Even the Caesar salad was fresh and tasty. Lots of selection for all foodies."}
{"text":"Deux étoiles, pour les frites, uniquement. Le reste n'en mérite aucune! \"Hamburger ordinaire\" (dixit le menu). On ne peut pas si bien dire! Galette de viande sèche et insipide dans un pain ciabatta pas frais et même pas réchauffé. Le \"fishwich\": même pain insignifiant  contenant un morceau de poisson très gras. La \"terrasse\" n'est pas invitante et une odeur difficilement identifiable s'en dégage. Non, vraiment, si j'ai une irrépressible envie de cholestérol, j'irai rendre visite au clown qui s'habille en jaune et rouge."}
{"text":"Fun place to stop in for a poutine fix! Lil on the pricey side, well maybe just the 15% added taxes then 20% tip!! Very creative interior and lively!  The fries were perfectly cooked and HOT, the gravy was on point, only negative is that they could have added a bit more cheese!  Overall the poutine was very good! We will definitely be back! \"Back to the Friteure\""}
{"text":"Gini la sauce provençale, c'était ma raison de venir prendre un burger. La sauce des poutines est trop poivrée à mon gout. Vraiment déçu de leur nouveau menu (qualité et quantité au rabais)."}
{"text":"Their fries are amazing and their sandwiches are good too! Their poutines could use more gravy and their sandwiches are a bit pricey. It also took a very long time from ordering to getting the food. They don't take MasterCard."}
{"text":"Endroit parfait pour une bonne bouffe bien grasse! Les poutines sont très satisfaisantes, tout comme les hamburgers!"}
{"text":"Good fries, good beer, popular with the locals.  This location is close to all the action on Rue Saint Denis.  Lack of air-conditioning combined with hot deep-fryers can make it a bit warm in here in the summer.  Expect to be served by heavily tattooed hipsters."}
{"text":"This place has great flavors, from the sauces to the meats; however, my hotdog happened to have multiple bones in it, which was weird. I don't enjoy bones where I don't expect them, but besides some prickly surprises it was ok."}
{"text":"You cannot visit Montreal/Quebec without trying some poutine but I really wanted a burger so my boyfriend ordered the poutine so I could taste it.  I had the Le Bêêêrger which is a beef burger with goat cheese and bacon and I had the frites as my side and the American sauce.  My burger was cooked to perfection and the goat cheese and bacon just absolutely made the burger delicious.  The La Vladimir (classic) poutine was just okay.  I ended up having a way better poutine at an Italian restaurant later in my trip.  The place was packed with young college students which didn't really bother me much.  All-in-all, it was a satisfying experience."}
{"text":"Delicious classic poutine. This is a chain restaurant surprised by the delicious taste. It's all in the gravy baby..."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fun & happy ambiance, friendly staff, but for God's sake, PLEASE CLEAN YOUR TOILETS!  Seriously, the ladies' room was dirrrrrty, and I mean it in a literal, old fashioned way.   Here's the rest of the verdict:  Food: My croque monsieur à la belge was very nice. The fries with sauce americaine were addictive.   Service: My bf ordered the moules à la flamande, but got a croque monsieur instead. He's one of those very forgiving customers, so he didn't mind the mistake and happily gobbled the croque monsieur, and the waitress felt really bad about it and asked if she could offer him something as compensation. My bf, again, was an absolute sweetie, and did not take advantage of the offer - silly him, I think. I would've asked for a soda or something. In my opinion, she should've taken a few dollars off our bill, but seeing that my bf wasn't unhappy...she probably thought it wasn't worth it. Other than that incident, the service was fine."}
{"text":"Okay, so it's not the healthiest food you can choose to eat, but it sure does taste so good! If you feel like having some fries or poutine, just look for the closest Frite Alors in your neighborhood."}
{"text":"Was here back in August, had a regular ol' Poutine and a grilled cheese with a fancy cider. Everything was great, even though we were there late in the evening. Thanks for being patient with my terrible attempt at ordering in French.   For a chain, this place still manages to serve some pretty legitimate poutines. But I am a filthy Toronto native, so I might not know what I am talking about."}
{"text":"Really great food at a good price. The fish sandwich was spectacular and the sauce that come with the fries was great."}
{"text":"I am HUNGRY!!! I want Poutine!   Frites Alors! really hit the spot. Large Poutine Vladimir ($10) is great to share as late night snack.. the cheese curds.. I love Cheese!! Fries is cooked just right crispy outside and mushy inside...and with just the right amount of gravy!  Maybe after a drink or 2 and another beer to go with the poutine, it makes everything perfect!.  Service is efficient and friendly.  I think I am starting to entertain the idea of having Poutine and Beer as my snack of choice!  I wish I can find good Poutine in Toronto.................."}
{"text":"Taco poutine was where it's at! Their burgers were extremely tasty and despite a full house, the servers were very nice and we couldn't blame the slower service because of how busy the place is. Because of how affordable the place is, I appreciate the amount of food they gave us (lots and lots of cheese and gravies along with nacho components to our taco poutine)"}
{"text":"I ordered the poutine with duck on it. It was super yummy and the waitress was very helpful and polite."}
{"text":"Last time I gave it a very good review, but I need to re write my review after today's visit. Frite Alors changed their design (I must admit its nicer) and their menu and this is the reason I need to change my review. The menu has more option and one option that really made me happy is that they added a \"Vegetarian Menu\" there is a small section highlighted in grey with all of the option. Now all of them come with fries. The Fries in Frite Alore are fried in fat so they are NOT vegetarian. When I asked the waiters if the fries are vegetarian (I said maybe they have something new) she replied no, the same fries, So I said but then they are not vegetarian, she replied yep, but this is the vegetarian menu. Sure you can add 1$ and change them to salad BUT if you are a vegetarian that doesnt know better you are sure you are getting a vegetarian option when in fact this is FALSE advertising. For this reason I gave them only 1 star."}
{"text":"A decent chain poutine place.  At lunch time it was nuts...super packed and loud.  I sat at a little bar and service was very slow.  The lady was friendly but she was overwhelmed.    I had the Frites Alors poutine, which is green peppers, mushrooms, onions and bacon.  It was very tasty although at the bottom of the bowl it was all fries, no sauce.   The large was so big I had to get a box for the remainder I couldn't eat.  For poutine on the go, this is a solid option but it doesn't elevate the genre of the food."}
{"text":"Comfort food de qualité, ingrédients frais, ça se goûte!  Les frites et leurs mayo sont délicieuses!   Poutine montréalaise: à se lécher les doigts."}
{"text":"crispy fries, squeaky cheese, and savory gravy. a solid poutine. no complaints."}
{"text":"When you're up for some greasy good food, Frite Alors never fails you. I actually do really enjoy their hot dogs which are served on baguettes rather than hot dog buns.  Also, the staff is usually very nice and welcoming. Not the best place for a burger but definitely hits the spot when you're in the mood for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I would normally give it a 3 stars for the food but I give it 4 because we had a really great waitress. She didn't speak English the best but tried her absolute hardest to give me answers to my questions and was very friendly and enthusiastic. The poutines are good but not the best I've ever had but not bad and we got a Viennese hotdog which is good. They have sauces with their fries which were really good and I liked."}
{"text":"Saturday May 28, 23:30, rue Sainte Catherine,  we were a group of 4 to step in the empty restaurant for a bite and a beer. After trying to get the waiter's attention for 15 minutes with no results, I took the initiative to go to the waiter myself and give him the order (remember, the restaurant was empty). He ordered me to go back to the table with attitude. I very kindly explained that we have waited for a long time and that I am ready to order for all the table right away. He kept his bad attitude and gave me a firm order to go back to the table. I then threw him an ultimatum, kindly saying: either you take the order, or we leave. And he asked us to leave. Interesting to see businesses in Montreal that do not care about customer experience. I, and my friends will never set foot at #FriteAlors again."}
{"text":"On the second day of my three-day visit in Montreal I was nervous I would leave without tasting any of my beloved poutine.   A friend was going to Frite Alors down the street and offered to bring back some for me. Should I wait to see if I can get something better? Whatever, I can always eat it twice.   By the time he returned I was rather famished and ready to dig in. However, I was quickly disappointed by the quality of this poutine.   The fries were already getting cold and mushy, the gravy was a strange orangey-brown color, but at least the cheese curds held their squeak.   For $9, I was left wanting much more. Even after sharing with two friends, several fries and too much gravy were left at the bottom of the box.   Read my review of  Patati Patata for my far superior poutine experience the next day."}
{"text":"Surprised at the reviews. Got the burger as per the waiters suggestion-dry terrible beef and tasteless fries. My friends got the poutine...over all \"meh\". Its one of those meals you don't finish unless you're starved because it's just not worth it's weight in calories. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I slipped down the stairs coming here.   But I was greeted friendly by staff whom promptly took my order.   I was in here trying to get a poutine before heading out to the train.   It's a large space with friendly staff.    The poutine was OK but not to my taste.   For some it may he very good but for me this was just OK.  I would comsider going back though.   That's all I have to say about this place.   Oh yea and watch the first step."}
{"text":"Deux fois qu'on y vas et pas déçu. Très bon repas, sangria très bonne . On en a pour notre argent. Serveuse toujours dispo et souriante. Je recommande les yeux fermé :)."}
{"text":"Pour un hamburger, une poutine ou un excellent fish and chip c'est un des meilleurs endroit que je connaisse. J'y suis allé une cinquantaine de fois!"}
{"text":"We meant to order the poutine, but had burgers and fries instead.  Excellent.  The crowd is mostly 20 somethings, but the staff is friendly and all are welcome.  Bustling and efficient service.  Fun, inexpensive dining out."}
