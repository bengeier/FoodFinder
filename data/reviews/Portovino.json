{"text":"Portovino opened recently at the old Oro Toro location and we were treated to a spectacular evening of great Italian specialties and courteous,prompt service. The menu consists of appetizers like tender octopus served with baby greens,mussels swimming in a perfect marinara sauce,Margarita pizza with a just right crust and a fabulous tomato sauce. Mama Mia where have you been all this time with mains like a melt in your mouth Osso Bucco and a sushi grade tuna served with all the Asian accompaniments. They come to your table with a platter showing the freshest products from the sea and the land and you choose what their Master Chefs will prepare.  We were in all honestly pleasantly surprised with all the dishes and we finished the evening  with an addictive dessert called red velvet cake, be forewarned eat it at your own risk because once you do, you will be coming back for more. Did I mention that this wonderful place is also a BYOW (bring your own wine)  establishment which makes the evening very affordable as you drink away your cellar while being  served with Reidel glasses and beautiful decanters. Also take note we were there week two of the opening and the place already was full and I highly recommend you call for reservations. Parking is Free. Enjoy and Ariverdeci !!!"}
{"text":"Bring your favorite wine to accompany a delicious meal. The Portovino mussels is a favorite !"}
{"text":"I have been trying to avoid this place for years. Let me sum it up in a nut shell. Over priced, mediocre food, nice deserts. I ordered a lasagna, it was \"Meh\" okay at $18.00 bucks. The Cesar salad was pretty good.  This is a nice place to go eat something called Italian food. There is a very nice place in Marche de l'Ouest that serves tastier Italian food on styrofoam plates. Good wait staff, loud club music, average tasting food, WAYYY over priced. If we do not go back again it will be fine with me."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Went to portvino for my mom's birthday and they told us they will charge $3 per slice to cut the cake. I said I can cut it myself for free And I said \"who charges for cutting a cake?\"and they said \"because we have a bakery downstairs.\""}
{"text":"Portovino is in general a good restaurant if you dont mind the $$. Went on Saturday Dec. 13th with a reservation for 10 people at 8:30 PM which is the last service. There were literally 50-60 people waiting with reservation at the door. After one hour and a lot of bitching we got glasses to open and drink OUR wine at the door..plus some Pizza. After 1.5hours we managed to get to our table. Appetizers were on the house..but still unacceptable. We sat at 10:00PM and ate around 10:45.  Ridiculous. They overbook and they dont do much to make people leave at the end of a service. Avoid if you dont want to be waiting forever.   PS: By the time we ordered there was only 1 FISH portion left. lol"}
{"text":"Completely not worth the price. Do not go for pasta!! And don't bother going for fish! Every time I've tried they were out. They also have yet to take the tuna tartare off their menu but they haven't had it in over three years at least!!"}
{"text":"I went there for my wife bday dinner, with a group of 12. I was a bit worried after reading the negative reviews. I am happy to say that I had a great experience..  Its supposed to be classy italian place and may get busy at nite with the byob..All depends on your luck. I was there on a saturday nite and the place was packed with decent crowd.   Keep in mind its an Italian place so be smart and order something italian. Menu wise they have a great choice of  pasta and steak options...I took the Italian sausage pasta and it turns out to be one of the best.  The week before i was a t L'Academie  with the same group. so it was easy to compare. And group found their food is better than L'Academie.    We had one main waiter and 2 others helping him and they were always around for help. Food showed up in 20-30 mins and I will definitely recommend to everyone...  I choose this place because i have been to other Italian places in west with the same group So decided to give a try.   Will definitely go back and recommend to others based on my experience.  PT"}
{"text":"This place is unusual (in my experience) because diners are encouraged to bring their own wine. Since they are located only steps away from a provincial wine shop that's tres cool. Service is above average, the tables are well set and the ambiance is open and friendy.  The food is pretty good too with an emphasis on Italian dishes. My recent clams in a red sauce was spicy and flavorful. It all worked well with my 1/2 bottle (left from the previous night at the same joint) of Argentinian syrah. Give it a try an share you impressions."}
{"text":"The brunch is exquisite and the service is outstanding. You feel like family and you really enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way to Mont Tremblant. The food and service were definitely 5 stars. My husband had lasagna and I had one of the mussel dishes. Both were excellent. They had buffalo mozzarella caprese on the menu which was surprising and delicious. For dessert we had the nutella banana creme brûlée which was out of this world. Our server was friendly and attentive.   However, I'd give it 3 stars for atmosphere. It was loud. I had to concentrate hard to listen to my husband who was sitting right across from me. There was a speaker right above our head and the changing lights were really distracting. There were a lot of people eating there, too which added to the noise. I saw some panels on the ceiling that looked possibly like noise absorbing things...but they didn't seem to be doing much - especially when the restaurant adds in music on top of the already loud din.   So between the 5 for food and service and 3 for atmosphere - it averages to a 4. We would definitely go back, but maybe not at peak dining time."}
{"text":"j'ai pris des pâtes avec du poulet à l'intérieur, la viande était sec, c'était degueulasse. On aurait dit des pâtes, avec de la sauce tomates du poulet sec avec un peu de sel et poivre. C'est un restaurant Italien, je m'attend à manger dea bonne nouriture, je me retrouve avec de la nourriture fade, sans goût. Ce restaurant est a eviter"}
{"text":"I went to Portovino for brunch for a family members birthday. As it is a BYOW restaurant you can bring champagne to your brunch if you are celebrating, which I noticed a few tables were. Brunch is served from10am to 2pm, costs $35 and is all you can eat. The brunch had a great selection divided into different stations with friendly cooks at each station.   To the best of my memory the stations were: -Standard pastry section: toast, crossiants chocolatines etc  -Breakfast station with scrambled eggs, beans, bacon, sausages, corn flake crusted french toast and more.  -Another with mostly seafood and pasta, crab legs, shrimp, mussels, calamari, salmon, cheese tortellini and penne.  -A cold salad bar with potato salad, pesto pasta salad, seafood salad, bean salad, prosciutto melon, smoked salmon mousse, oysters etc. -A waffle and dessert station where you can pick anything you want to put on your waffle and desserts such as rice pudding, creme brulee, macarons, cannolis etc. -Small selection of cheeses -And every kids favorite section: the chocolate fountain with fruits and marshmallows to dip.  Service was great. Our server was polite, she cleared plates quickly and refilled coffee frequently and was very friendly. Great place for kids and for groups. Good food. I would recommend. :)"}
{"text":"I went out with my fiancee and another couple last night to Portovino. I enjoy the food there and the atmosphere is nice. Last night, however, a waitress asked us if we wanted sparkling water or flat. We all said that we wanted flat.   At the end of the night, we were charged $7 for the water! That wasn't acceptable. I explained to the waitress that we all said we wanted the \"regular\" water to avoid a charge. She then said that we opted for the flat water. I explained to her that she misled us to believe that was regular tap water. At the end, they removed the charge which was fine. Next time, it's best to be clear and not mislead a client when asked for water."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food was good, and BYOW! Surprisingly classy place for being attached to a mall, and the lunch menu was very reasonably priced. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Thumbs down for Portovino on Decarie... Not accommodating to handicap clients and rude!"}
{"text":"great pasta friendly staff ,   the desserts are great, we were a group of 20 people the waitress really made an effort."}
{"text":"Had all you can eat Sunday Brunch there.  The breakfast items were very good, the omelet station was great, mussels were excellent, the oysters were \"ok, a bit on the fishy side\", huge array of desserts and fruits.  I also enjoyed the pasta and of course the waffles (although the aren't made fresh infront of you, but they add all the other ingredients to the hot pan with the pre-made waffle).  Waiter was very attentive, kept refilling our water and coffee and clearing our plates away."}
{"text":"Went for a group dinner with a pre set menu. I chose the chicken florentine soup and the Bavette steak and fries. Portovino's antipasto dish is always excellent, especially the calamari. The soup was horrible, I left half in the bowl. The Bavette was well cooked (medium) and the fries were decent. As for dessert, the good chocolate cake came wayyyy before the (horrible tasting) coffee - big no no. The service suffered due to their being other large groups."}
{"text":"Very good italian food with a nice ambiance. A bit pricey in my opinion, but given its location it's somewhat understandable."}
{"text":"The worst \"italian\" restaurant in Montreal area!!! If you really love italian food don't go there!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because the service was very friendly and accommodating by changing our table from a very noisy area to a more quiet one. But it took speaking to the manager because the poor waiters couldn't get the volume down.  It might be because it was Christmas parties but extremely rowdy crowds with lots of alcohol going around.  After that my comments are pretty well the same as Mark's. The food was very well prepared but extremely pricey considering the size of the portions. When I asked to substitute the potatoes with pasta, I was refused the vegetables that originally came with the dish unless I was willing to pay for a side order. $7.00 for an appetizer salad and $6.00 for a cappuccino to finish your meal is way overpriced.  My friend took the table d'hôte and was offered a dessert and then was charged $10 extra for the dessert.  I think they are taking advantage of a BYOB to jack up the prices.  They got me once and only once......"}
{"text":"We did a 20+ person birthday dinner and could not say enough good things about the service food embiance and price. Our waiter Michael was extremely attentive professional and courtious. He made sure everyones glass was full and communicated with everyone very comfortably. Everyone enjoyed their meal and had a great time. I have been to parties at the Portovino on the transcanada which was nice but this one is so much nicer. Thanks again to the Portovino staff and management for helping make for a great memorable birthday party."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch!!! They have everything!! Plan on spending some time. It's classy yet friendly and so tasty. Bring some bubbly and enjoy it all. The stuffed avocados I can't get enough. Bring your friends As a treat. They will be impressed."}
{"text":"Tellement trop cher! Pour ce qui est offert dans notre assiette... Trop grand trop bruyant... Nous avons par contre reçu un excellent service."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Almost choked on the fettuccine alfredo which by the way tasted like watery rubber. Waited over an hour for burnt salmon. Finally when the replacement arrived the underside was pure black. Service was below average. Took about a half hour to get the check. I don't suggest coming here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is well known to most people living in town. I personally find that it is excessively advertised and over rated. There are many other Italian authentic restaurants that serve great pasta and pizzeria."}
{"text":"The service was attentive. That is one positive thing I can say.  I find it offensive, however, when the waiter brings a tray of raw meat and seafood, to show the diner what it looks like before it is cooked. Are we infants?  We have all eaten before. Four diners, four different dinners. Chicken breast was dry. The rack of lamb was so-so. The lasagna was pretty but short on meat and oomph. And the rib steak was terrible. Cooked as specified, but it was a mass of fat and sinew, very little meat that was edible. Each of us got 4 vegetables, a floret of cauliflower, a small yellow pepper, half a carrot and one lonely asparagus. This was so not worth the price. I guess we have eaten at Portovino twice last night, the first and the last time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. I came here looking for some decent food. I decided to order the pizza and found it to be merely average. Perhaps I should've ordered something else? So despite the great atmosphere and amazing service I only give it three stars."}
{"text":"We went with friends for dinner as we were looking for a BYOW restaurant. I like Italian food, but I'm not a huge fan of pasta, so I usually tend to go for veal parmigiana, osso bucco and the likes. When ordering, they present you the meats on a platter, and I knew right there that I had to take the osso bucco (and my wife did the same). We also had the salmon tartar and grilled octopus as entrees. Both entrees were delicious, the salmon tartar a very nice mix of mangoes and salmon with sriracha sauce on the side, and the grilled octopus grilled to perfection.  The osso bucco itself was perfect as well. Melt in the mouth, luscious risotto and marrow was a delight in itself (to the point of disappointment when there's not more left).  Had a cappucino and split a cheesecake for dessert which were also very good.  Service was efficient, quick and pleasant.  A very nice evening of perfect food with great friends. The bill ended up on the high side, but as an occasional evening out, we'll do it again."}
{"text":"I went with my wife and kids to this place for Sunday Brunch. We had to make a reservation in advance, the place is good for people with children and the food is OK and nothing special.   The main issue though, \"if you get to eat\" then it would taste ok. This place has a buffet brunch during weekends but nothing there. Everything was emptied and you would literally eat one bite at a time. They would get you fries then a long time later you will get the sausage then wait for another 10 minutes till you get the eggs. They are very slow and no one was there to supervise or see how the food is gone.   The price is EXTREMELY expensive taken into consideration that we did not eat a full plate or all the contents of a good brunch at the same time. I wanted to wait till they get some toast so that I eat my egg. All I got was cold egg warm toast no sausage and then I had sausage after a while just separately alone.   Would not go back there and would neither recommend it. Maybe if it is not for brunch could be better but I won't risk going back there.   I've put 2 stars just because I did not try their menu and just tried their brunch buffet."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and the menu was pretty good, but unfortunately that's about it. I was here with a large group, so that certainly could have contributed to the slow service and cold food, but the quality/ingredients of the food weren't at all impressive, and the prices were far too high for such mediocre food. There are tons of Italian restaurants in Montreal: you can do better."}
{"text":"Yeaaaaaaah... So I've always wondered about this place.    I'm pretty sure this is a chain.  I know there's one in the West Island and I've driven by it every single time getting on the highway going in a certain direction.    The pastas are not made in house.  I know because I asked my server.  The pasta isn't even fresh.  It's dry.  Like dry from a package.  I'm not into that.  No one should be into that unless you're at home and desperate.    We tried the osso buco, pork chop, and veal scallopini (sp?).  Everything was okay... Nothing special.    It's not a place I would go back to or recommend but if you're basically a suburbanite wanting a nice dining environment, family friendly, and lots of parking, I can see why people come here."}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday night. Service was excellent and the food was good. I had the mussel and fries and they aee excellent.  I did not take any dessert but some at our table did. Be warn if you take the cannoli. Theirs 2 in the plate and they are big. The decor would be in need of a bit of an upgrade but at least the food is always good."}
{"text":"Met with an employee today for a meeting and then decided to try this place out. Didn't know where anything was so when we saw an Italian restaurant, we decided to stop.  The overall atmosphere was the same everywhere. Dim, romantic, not the atmosphere we were looking for. But, as we were hungry and it was 8-9 pm, whatever right?  The service wasn't very good. We waited quite a long time for the person to show up with our drinks. Nothing special either.  The food portions were quite large. Once the appetizer got to the table, I regretted ordering it. I knew I wouldn't be able to finish my pasta.   The food was good, not amazing, just good. If I wanted to be very picky, the pasta was a ligule bit soft, but it was still pretty average.  Overall, it was a very average restaurant."}
{"text":"The restaurant is basic Italian food nothing that blows your mind that will have you begging to go back.  It is byow which is most likely the best part.  We had a fun waiter as we were a group of 6 girls :)  The atmosphere is very quiet and calm and all the customers looked upset minus our table.  Calamari is the best thing :)"}
{"text":"An excellent experience for my first visit. I enjoyed a wonderful dish the was presented well and tasted very good. It is a BYO establishment so plan accordingly. I would definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"Beware, you think you will get one dish, but NO. You get bread with balsamic and olive oil, choice of soup, your main, AND dessert plus coffee. This is all included by the way. Great price for what they give you. (my bill came up to $21.86....yes for all that)  My pasta was great! Too bad I didn't finish it though. It was way too much and I really wanted to squeeze in dessert...so you know one must make sacrifices. I also had the lobster soup before my pasta, and it was very delicious.   Service was very good at lunchtime when I went. Our waiter was extremely friendly and attentive. He was in such great spirits that I ended up being in great spirits too.    This is  BYOW so don't forget to bring a bottle!"}
{"text":"A good place for dinner, classy and typical Italian menue but I feel it is a bit over priced for what you get and never find myself saying hey we should go to Porto Vino because it is a bit simply generic and expensive, might as well go to a nice authentic Italian restaurant but maybe I am unfair because it is a chain after all.  On the PLUS Side, there Sunday Brunch is IMPRESSIVE if your willing to fork the over 30$ bill for it. It has everything with a couple chefs and several stations (omelet, crepre, pasta,..) where they cook on the stop with your instructions.  Basically imagine a brunch on a luxury cruise with a lot of breakfast and lunch items like sliced roast beef, seafood, all kinds of pasta, omelets, fruits, ...  Dessert include a large chocolate fountain, creme brule, cannolis, .. Just in desserts you get a lot of your value lol It is good for a celebration with family or friends as a group but I would't go there by myself lol"}
{"text":"I am conflicted...the service and food was really good! BYOB is always a great idea because you can bring your favorite wine, spend according to your budget, or both. The thing is, I feel like many dishes are terribly over-priced at dinner time.   But on to the food: I wasn't feeling the table d'hôte choices and neither was my date , so we shared an appetizer of grilled calamari and then each had a main. I enjoyed the calamari but he found it too smokey and charred for his tastes. Then for my main I had the steak tartare. It was almost too spicy, I think they really need to ask how the customer prefers it when it's not mentioned on the menu. I loved the simple arugula salad on top of the tartare and toasts, but then it was also accompanied with cooked veggies and mashed potatoes (?) A bit of a confused presentation.   My date and his friends were great fun, the shiraz I had was lovely, but overall I can't justify the QPR."}
{"text":"What I really like about this restaurant is the fact that it is a bring your own wine. And the positives end there, the food is overpriced for what they are serving you. There's really nothing special here, just your run of the mill Italian fare. I had the veal and I was not impressed, very tough and chewy not tender in the slightest. I would recommend going to Scarolies instead its cheaper for the same quality of food."}
{"text":"First of all, this place is a BYOW. They have some pretty decent italian meals. Last time i got the bruschetta which was one of my favourites in a while. Next i got the arancini which were OK. As a main meal i shared a pizza, it was a thin crust style pizza and it was pretty good.  Overall, i enjoy coming here, it's not too overpriced, you can bring your wine, and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Love it here!! Alfredo pasta very good even accepted to add broccoli for me!! Every time I go, I have a good experience. I always ask for bread with their classic olive oil and balsamic vinegar so good!. Also went for their New Years buffet brunch was very satisfied and impressed!! It was delicious and well managed."}
{"text":"What a disaster this restaurant is. A friend organized her birthday party here. I had never heard good things about portovino, but it was out of my hands.   You can sense the pathetic attempt at high class from the moment you walk in. I noticed overdressed west island people all ready for their weekend outing. Well portovino is bad even by west island standards.   The service was bland and unpleasant.   The food was bland and unpleasant as well! Every entré (appetizer) is 15-22... Seriously...? 17$ for an Italian sausage with tomato sauce? I ordered pizza, it was cold and boring. Everyone around me was rather unimpressed.   Think of L'academie, but less good and more expensive."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, perfectly attentive waiter and love the \"bring your own wine\" option.  Menu was varied and there are a number of dishes I would like to go back to try.  Be aware, they serve large portions, good value for the money too.  As we are fequent visitors to Montreal I think we'll definately go back to try again."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for a Monday evening. We arrived and said the name which the reservation was under. We waited 45 minutes for the rest of the group only to realised they had place them at the other end of the restaurant claiming no one else had arrived yet. (It was a work thing so we didnt have their personnal phone numbers). The food was mediocre. The prices are as usual in those types of restaurants. Calamary appetizers were good. Seafood pasta was disgusting, chewy seafood and sandy clams. Yuck! I thought i would get lucky with the desert....red velvet coconut cake. Sounds yummy no? .....omg too sweet. And I LOVE SWEET. But this was not good. Very dissapointed! :("}
{"text":"We were served with fresh and warm bread with olive oil/balsamic vinegar dipping. Had the manicotti which was excellent. Second main dish was a mushroom pasta plate. The food was good. Prepped quickly. Service was great. There was nothing extravagant about the meal but everything was well done."}
{"text":"Nous sommes arrêtés là un par hasard en revenant à Montréal par l'autoroute 40. Dommage que nous ne savions pas que c'était un \"apportez votre vin\". Portovino, bien sûr ! Bref, on a pu manger un repas italien sans vin pour une fois ! Les calmars grillés en entrée étaient très bons. Mon plat de pâtes était correct. Nous n'avons pas pris de dessert. Si j'y retourne, j'apporterai du vin pour une meilleure expérience !"}
{"text":"BYOW which is great for our group of corporate folks that drink more than most. Great food, excellent presentation and good choices. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great Italian style restaurant. Had the linguine al duo di mare (linguine with shrimp and scallops) and the red sauce was perhaps the best I've ever had - including in Italy. My party also had the moules et frites (muscles with fries) in the marinara sauce. There must have been 50+ muscles in a great sauce. Great menu variety."}
{"text":"Good service but overall bland food. Had 2 different pastas and an entrée, for the price expected much more flavour."}
{"text":"Food is very good, fast service, nice ambiance, bit pricey but totally worth it! Lots of different dishes, ill go back anytime. And don't forget to bring your wine!"}
{"text":"Portovino is an expensive restaurant but totally worth it! The pasta, the meat even the deserts are great! Not 100% kid friendly. The decor is up-class, and really chic. I come here about 2-3 a year for anniversaries, the space between tables is tight so be careful when moving around."}
{"text":"The decor and ambience was amazing...well...maybe not the music. You would expect some sort of music from Italy but anyway...it didn't bother that much. The server was very good, considering that he was running around like crazy since it was a bit crowded. The food was good, nothing outstanding but it was fresh, hot, and portion sizes plentiful. You do have to bring your booze but there is a liquor store inside the mall with plenty of wine options. Worth the try"}
{"text":"Je crois l'avoir déjà dit, le Brunch est mon repas favori. Le porto Vino du Carrefour Laval offre le Brunch du dimanche depuis janvier 2013. Quelle bonne idée d'avoir suivi les traces des autres Porto Vino. Un très grand choix et des aliments de bonne qualité. Huitres frais, saumon fumé, saucisses italiennes, différentes sortes de salades froides, polenta, pâtes, station d'omelettes et station crêpes suzettes (grand Marnier ou Tia maria) et gaufres, fontaine de chocolat et fruits, station de desserts... Du choix, du choix et du choix, le tout à volonté. Comme c'est un apporter votre vin, il ne suffit que de commander un pichet de jus d'orange et savourer un bon mimosa avec le repas."}
{"text":"The joy of Portovino is that you can bring your own wine here as a BYOB resto so you can have a smashing good time with your friends while enjoying a fantastic Italian meal!    We had a huge group meal for lunch and on the day we came it seemed like each table was a Christmas party.    I chose the bavette de boeuf (hanger steak) with fries on a friends's recommendation.  It came with crispy fries and an au jus sauce and what appeared to be another creamy (yet delicious) sauce as well!  My lunch was fantilliy-astic in terms on flavour texture and portion size!    Portovino is good for pasta (for dinner) or lunch!  Just be prepared to pay around $20 for lunch.  For dinner I never order the meat on the fancy tray they bring around.  It's expensive albeit I believe it would be great!  Their pasta is really good that I usually stay with one selection on the vast menu.  This location would have to be my favourite as the layout is really nice next to Carrefour Laval!    Make sure you bring wine (if you drink) it will make for a great lunch or evening!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant as everywhere else was packed and I was not about to wait an hour and half for supper at 8:30 at night. So came to Portivino with my colleague. Place was full but we only waited 10 min to be seated.  The service was fast our server was very courteous and explained the choices and menu. We were always tended to: water refill,  bread. We each started off with a salad, which was solid, and then our main meal came. I had the chicken fillet with white wine sauce, variety off vegetable and served on french fries. My colleague had the osso bucco which was served on a bed of risotto. Presentation wise is was beautiful and looked really appetizing.   Unfortunately in my case flavours fell short. Chicken was too dry, not enough seasoning very very bland, also the french fries were soggy as it had absorbed all the sauce and juices of the chicken. Was not tasty at all. But my colleague osso buco was really tasty and that's why I'm giving it a 3 star. The ambiance is nice but much too noisy we could barely here each other speak. We ordered cappuccino at the end, I like my coffee hot but this was lukewarm. NOT IMPRESSED"}
{"text":"Went for brunch and would not go back. The food wasn't good. The yolk of the poached egg in the egg Benedict was hard from sitting under the heat lamp so long. For 3 people with tax and tip it was 140$, definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive service, but beware the food. Just finished lunch there an hour ago and I'm already dead sick. Two hours left until the work day is over but I don't know if I'll make it. If I'm not here Yelping tomorrow, tell my family I love them."}
{"text":"I was there during lunch with my boss and we always have the same thing Penney Alla Gigi.... It was delicious!!! Penne pasta with a little spicy crramy rosé sauce.   Their lunch portion price is great! $12 it comes with soupe of the day or salad and coffee! Think about it, it's just $4 more than McDonald. But you'll be comfortably seated, with service and a lot more healthier.   Service. Maybe we were there a bit earlier than the usual crowd, we got there quarter to noon. Everything went in a timely fashion, foods arrive hot and tasty! But actually impressed me was the waiter. We were on a hurry to a meeting, so we told our waiter we didn't want the coffee even though it was included in our meal. The waiter brought us the bill along with 2 coffees in a takeaway cup. Now this is what I call thoughtful.  Way to go!"}
{"text":"Portovino is a lovely Italian 'ristorante' where the bread is served hot (read: gooey on the inside and toasty on the outside), meats and fish are brought table side for your choosing, and the pasta is so divine, that it would satisfy eve the most critical palates (seriously, have you ever met someone who wasn't impressed with the Duo di Mare dish?? A sprinkling of dill on a a giant scallop is the stuff of dreams).  The only con I can think of that denies this superb restaurant a perfect score is the service on weekends. They seemed understaffed the one time I visited on  a Saturday night, resulting in very slow service, some plate mix-ups, etc. However, we were a big group, and the several times I've eaten here on weekdays and weeknights, I've had nothing short of a great experience.  In short, if you happen to have had a lovely day of shopping at Carrefour Laval and are feeling peckish - treat yourself to a fabulous meal at Portovino. And don't forget: \"Portovino\"  translates as \"Bring Wine\"...so make a quick stop at the SAQ before dining!"}
{"text":"I have always liked Portovino  .  Mind you this time was a stressful experience . We were a group of 25 ppl on a Saturday night and the ventilation was out . We were seated upstairs  and it felt like we were in Mexico . They  said they were in contact with Hydro but nothing happened till we left at 10 pm . After 1h30 mins sitting in what felt like 30 plus degrees , the fire alarm going off , going up and down to get air , they were able to take our group downstairs for out main meal . The only reason why I am giving them 4 stars is because fist off the food was delicious , they gave us all 15% off out meals  , free creme brule for everyone and they birthday girls meal was free ."}
{"text":"My cousin had arranged a surprise 60th birthday for my aunt here, mostly because of the \"BYOW\" aspect. It's a decent size, but isn't the best location for a surprise because of the openness of it. Nonetheless, we were able to \"hide\" well enough for the birthday girl to only notice us as she got really close. The wait staff were nice, helpful and very attentive. If ever we asked for something, they were right back with whatever it was we had asked for. As with all BYOW I've been to, the menu is overpriced to counter the lack of alcohol profits, which is unfortunate for someone who is unable to drink at the moment (damn you antibiotics!!). I ordered from the Table d'Hote, starting with a House Salad (mixed greens with a balsamic dressing) and the Gnocchi. The House Salad was deeeelish. I know, it's just a house salad, but it was really good! Unfortunately, the Gnocchi didn't garner the same reaction. It was good, but felt pretty heavy with all the oil, so I took half home to eat the next day for lunch (when I had the leftovers the following day, forget it; the globs of oil made it almost impossible to eat!). The best part was probably the dessert; I had planned on ordering a cannolli because they are soooo good, but we were told that a birthday cake had been purchased and would be distributed to all guests. I must say I was a bit disappointed, until I found out it was red velvet, with buttercream layers. NUFF SAID!! I am a huge red velvet lover, and that cake was so decadent, I almost licked my plate clean. But I didn't, because I didn't want to be THAT girl.   I've never had a bad experience at any Portovino locations, although I see others have. It's a decent place; nothing to write home about, but if you're in a pinch and you want a BYOW, it's a safe bet."}
{"text":"My bad review is really about the price vs. the quality of the food. I took a cesar salad to start. When you order a cesar salad at 9$, you expect a good salad with all the ingredients included. Not at Portovino. It was just salad with cesar dressing and 3 croutons. No bacon, no parmesan.   My main course was the tortellinis. Well coocked, good portion, but tastes nothing. The meat sauce was tasting like Catelli can sauce.. It was bland. 21$ for that is a rape.   The only positive point of this restaurant is you can bring your own wine. Everything else, for me, is a no go. It does not worth the price they are charging."}
{"text":"N'aller pas la pour avoir une assiette à 10$. Par contre, le prix en vaut la chandelle. Les portions sont juste correcte pour bien remplir un estomac. N'oubliez pas votre vin puisque c'est un apporter votre vin.  Le service est correcte vu le nombre de table et de serveur. Par contre, l'ambiance est extrêmement bruyant. Je croyais que c'était un peu hupé comme endroit mais ce n'est pas le cas, juste moderne. Il y à trois endroits possible où être assis, soit dans un genre de corridor près des fenêtres ou dans deux gros espace rectangulaire superposé. Le problème est que le bruit se concentre alors dans ces espaces, ce qui le rend aussi bruyant sinon plus qu'un cafétéria d'école secondaire. On avait de la misère à entendre la serveuse.  L'aire d'attente pour une table est aussi très bizarre. De gros coussin séparer d'une table où il est impossible d'avoir les jambes droites. C'est à croire qu'il veulent qu'on se couche."}
