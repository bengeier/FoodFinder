{"text":"Bought a groupon wish I could have gone after reading all the stellar reviews but it's permanently CLOSED just a heads up..."}
{"text":"My first time review and first try of chicken and waffles. Let's just say this place did not disappoint. A hidden spot that serves hot, fresh and tasty comfort food. During this visit we ordered Leroy's chicken and waffles as well as the special called the\"mother clucker\". Both dishes filled our bellies and created huge smiles on our faces. Food is on point and the service was too. Made us feel right at home. Definitely going back to try out the other items on the menu"}
{"text":"Had lunch at this little gem yesterday and all I can say is omg, I want more!   Had the fried chicken - moist, flavorful and crispy.   Candied yams - mashed with whole bits.  The flavor and texture were amazing.  Mac and cheese...where do I begin...   Creamy, buttery, moist - this stuff is beyond good.  Greens - done just right.  Cornbread muffin - now I'm not a fan of cornbread but, this was excellent.  And let's not forget the perfect accompaniment, ginger lemonade.  In short, I will be back and the food was nothing but sublime!    Just one thing, you need better signage and an \" open\" sign.  I almost kept going thinking you were closed.  What a shame that would have been :-)."}
{"text":"I came across this restaurant thru groupon. Right on chicken and waffles in Tolleson.  I had Leroys chicken and waffle on the menu and it was good. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The only  thing I would suggest is have a traditional hot sauce on the table. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic Southern Food! The atmosphere makes you feel like your back home in Mom's kitchen and so does the food. If you're from the South and miss home, you'll fit right in. The women are so nice and friendly and make you feel so welcome. If you're not from the South and want to know what real southern food tastes like, get yourself over here and find out!"}
{"text":"Fabulous! Heard about this spot from a friend and sent my husband to pick up dinner while I was at work the next day. Menu had many options and the wonderful ladies even helped my husband put a meal together. Chicken was crispy and full of flavor but not greasy like the big name fried chicken joints. The green beans were crisp and loaded with flavor.  Mac n Cheese was tasty and moist.  The cornbread muffins were perfect.  The prices are right and the service is awesome. I have referred friends who also have come back just as happy.  Our plan to try the breakfast line soon."}
