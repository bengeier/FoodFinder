{"text":"We did a food tour of the Mile End area that started here. The falafel was wonderful, so much so that we returned for lunch another day on our visit. The decor was really fun, loved the metal cups and commitment to being green and sustainable. We had several smoothies that were great, served in mason jars with handles. And really, the falafel sandwich is the best I've ever had--really like the veggies in it."}
{"text":"So enjoyed the falafel pita, that falafel may be the best I have had. Tahini sauce was perfect. Live the decor. Went here on a food tour so I cant comment in the service."}
{"text":"They have the slowest service I've ever seen in my life. I bet they lose thousands of dollars a year bc of this inefficiency. I could have picked the mangoes off the tree, peeled them and made 5 smoothies in the time it took their employee to make one (not for me, I walked out- and it's not the first time I've walked out).  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've only tried their smoothies, but they're amazing. Much better than Jugo Juice, Liquid Nutrition, and other smoothie places in Montreal! Very healthy, smooth, and quite filling! Summertime is soon so I will be heading here for smoothies frequently!"}
{"text":"I found a BUG inside my sandwich!! The locale at 2153 Rue Mackay seems to have poor hygene standards - starting with the bathroom. I can't imagine what the kitchen looks like."}
{"text":"It took 25 minutes from the moment I set foot into the restaurant until I got a simple sandwich. There were only two clients in front of me. The sandwich was good, but the service is not comparable with the Panthère Verte in Downtown."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today. Ordered a Panthere Sandwich or whatever it's called. I took it with the salad combo and a drink. When I was about to pay, even the cashier seemed embarassed to tell me how much I owed: over 20$! Adding the salad cost me 6$ extra, more expensive than the sandwich itself! And you could barely taste the vegan pâté in the sandwich, it was mostly tomatoes and a handful of lettuce. Definitely not worth the price. At least service was quick. But for that price, you can eat twice as much at Aux Vivres. And it tastes 10 times better. Won't be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent de fraîcheur et de qualité. Un peu plus d'espace serait apprécié pour manger sur place"}
{"text":"habituellement, je ne suis pas fan des places végétaliennes mais je dois avouer que ce petit restaurant est très sympa et leur sandwich aux falafels est vraiment délicieux !"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food has always tasted good. The servers are always cheerful. Why are people hating on La Panthère Verte? No idea, it's great."}
{"text":"Super endroit pour un lunch végétarien ou vegan :-) les prix sont corrects et le cadre est sympa."}
{"text":"High ceilings and indoor plants always a plus. Patio and open windows, even better, especially if you hate air con like I do! Organic and vegan, with a limited selection of falafel variations, roasted vegetables and fresh juices. But extremely affordable...I've been here enough times to have tried everything at least twice (except the soups) and I keep coming back for the great value for money."}
{"text":"C'est une super place pour manger santé sur Queen Mary!....presque la seule! Ils ont des bonnes salade et des bons desserts. Oui les prix sont chers, mais c'est à ce que je m'attend pour une place comme celle-ci."}
{"text":"Delicious falafel and salads! A great healthy fast food option, and just a few blocks away from Jeanne Mance park if you feel like a picnic."}
{"text":"FOOD: The soup and Falafel Sandwich were amazing with a great Mango Tea!   PRICE:  $28.00 ( two large soups + 2 Teas + 1 Falafel Sandwich)  Restaurant decorations is good!!!   I recommend for anyone who wants  a quickly and tastefully option!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed of the Tao bowl, the sauce is salty to death, my feeling is it is ten times saltier as normal. We ordered a vegeburger which is not bad."}
{"text":"Awesome wraps, but for take away it can get rather soggy if left for a long time. It tasted wonderful however, and I'd love to return!!"}
{"text":"We found parking easy on a Saturday late afternoon. The selection is not large, but it all sounded delicious. Lots of sandwiches and salad, smoothies and teas. If you don't want bread, they will sub it with the insides of the sandwich for basmati type rice.  The staff was VERY friendly and warm.  There are about 10 or so tables, don't quote me on that. one table by the window is sort of Middle Eastern style, and you can lie instead of sitting straight up. Very cute.  The food is not fancy, but it is GOOD. The prices are reasonable.  They have desserts that look good.  I want to give 3.5 stars, but alas, not a choice.   I tried my partner's vegeburger and it WAS delicious I must say. Not your usual.  Right next door to this place was another vegan restaurant which looked like the upscale sister restaurant to the green panther. I would like to try that one for dinner."}
{"text":"When I went to there I had a 5 ball falafel pita and a balooberry smoothie. The falafel were awesome but the additional contents of the sandwich took away from the taste. The smoothie was good. The prices are reasonable for organic food which is usually twice as expensive. The people were friendly. The place doesn't have high chairs for children."}
{"text":"As a vegan approaching the two year mark, I was thrilled to find myself living within walking distance of crud essence, aux vivres, and most importantly, la panthère verte. The other two are delicious, but nothing beats the 8 dollar falafel. It's filling beyond belief, delicious and is always satisfying. Haven't tried many other things on the menu as I love the traditional falafel too much, but I highly recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this great restaurant twice during our stay because we loved it the first time! The traditional falafel is AMAZING! The burger is good too along with the BBQ Tofu (tho I wish it had a bit more of the BBQ flavour. Overall we love it! The atmosphere inside is great and they've got a patio that can accommodate at least 50 people! A must visit! Thank you to the staff for a wonderful time! You're all so great and welcoming!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best falafel pita sandwich to be had in Montreal. Delicious, healthy, inexpensive food and cute and friendly staff, need I say more? Try to get the low table by the window!"}
{"text":"Even on a street as busy as Saint Denis, the atmosphere is peaceful and natural with little ambient noise, making it a perfect location for a business lunch. The falafel sandwich is very tasty and its ingredients feel fresh in your belly. Must have the falafels, they will perfectly do the job of filling your belly without hurting it."}
{"text":"Oh wow.... Yum! I'm not vegan, not even vegetarian, but I will certain be going back to la Panthere Verte.  A vegan friend brought me there on a Wed night for a quick bite. The place was about half-full. We split a veggie burger and a tempehtation pita, which were ready in less than 10 min. The portions were quite generous and both were delicious, but the veggie burger was just a bit better with the pickles and ketchup. Didn't try any of the juices or smoothies, but certainly will next time.  Perfect location, with the 24 bus steps away, the Guy metro just around the corner and a Bixi stand a block away.  Loved the relaxed atmosphere and all the greenery."}
{"text":"English follows.  La Panthère Verte est mon restaurant végane préféré à Montréal, mais je préfère leur location sur le Plateau, au 145 Ave. du Mont-Royal. Je trouve que leur nourriture est plus fraîche et a meilleure goût à leur location dans le Plateau, alors qu'au centre-ville ça manque un peu de goût et on dirait que c'est fait \"à la botche\". Je ne sais pas si c'est dû au personnel ou à leur stock. La location au Plateau est charmante et accueillante, mais souvent bondée. La location au centre-ville est tout aussi chaleureuse, mais moins bondée.  J'aime tous leurs sandwiches, mais en particulier celui aux falafels. Leurs desserts sont tout aussi délicieux!  Quant aux prix, je les trouve raisonnables. Parfois, ils vendent du bon hummous maison à seulement 2$ dans leur comptoir à emporter, c'est une bonne aubaine!  Bref, je recommande vivement cet endroit pour les végétariens, végétaliens et véganes, ou même ceux qui ont envie d'essayer ce genre de nourriture! La Panthère Verte offre aussi des rabais sur les repas consommés sur place aux membres de l'Association Végétarienne de Montréal, si c'est quelque chose qui vous intéresse.  ************  The Green Panther is my favorite vegan restaurant in Montreal, though I prefer their location in the PLateau at 145 Mont-Royal Ave. In my experience, the Mont-Royal location serves fresher foods with a better taste, whilst in the Downtown location I feel like it's not as fresh as it could be and it's done with some sort of \"negligence\". I don't know though if it,s due to their employees or because of the food stocks they have there. Their location in the Plateau is cozy, though it's often full. The restaurant in Downtown is just as cozy and has far less people.  I like all their sandwiches, but particularly their falafel one. Also, their desserts are just as delicious!  As for the prices I think they're reasonable. Sometimes they'll sell some delicious home-made hummus for only 2$ at their ready-to-go section, I think it's a great deal!  I highly recommend this place for anyone who is vegetarian or vegan or wants to try this type of foods. Also, The Green Panther offers discount for members of the Montreal Vegetarian Association (to-go meals not eligible), if that's something you're interested in."}
{"text":"Food: I mainly go there for their awesome falafel sandwich. It's a good place for a semi-quick & relatively healthy meal.  They also sell leftover food as a to go meal in a jar- cool idea. I personally prefer my food fresh and alive.   Mood: it's a cute place and could have been pretty homey. But There's something weird about the energy. It feels more like a little machine trying hard to look like a good human :)  I like to eat close to where the food is prepare. But here I prefer to take out food there. And really really reaaaaaly don't like drinking in plastic cups! It feels to me, (absurd as you may think) that water dies a little bit when you put it in plastic.   They have cute plants hanging throughout the restaurant, but the plants seem sad and unkept. I guess that's not what people care for when reviewing a restaurant, but in case some other energy sensitive folks are there, that's for you :)"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! I swear you leave there feeling happier and healthier. I would definitely call this comfort food - without the \"guilt\". Their salads are fresh and their dressing homemade (the intense flavor(s) of those homemade dressings are impeccable). Their sandwiches are fun and there's a large selection of them...again, everything is very fresh. It's the chili that really stole my heart though. Vegan, hearty and I'll point out they are deliciously generous with the kidney beans.  I would've given this place 5 stars but I was just SO disappointed with the terrace! It's way too small & cramped to even be considered one. It's almost better not to give customers the option at that point."}
{"text":"Great soups and daily specials.  I haven't had the negative experiences other people have had.  I have only had the falafel sandwiches - and you do need to mix everything together, otherwise you are getting uniform mouthfuls of various things, not everything mixed together - and the tempeh sandwiches.  Both of them were great.  I LOVE their cookies, and really enjoyed the various soups and daily specials.  I like the one on MacKay more because it's a nicer venue, and they don't take forever to make their food.  Some of their salads aren't great, though, just \"meh.\"  Good portion size too and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Since the reviews are so great, maybe I was there on a bad night. My boyfriend and I each ordered a wrap, and we split a smoothie. The total for both of us was almost $30 with tax. I ordered the Tofu BBQ wrap, and I was really excited since savoury tofu is a great thing to find. However, when I got my wrap it was mostly filled with ketchup (waaayyy too much ketchup - and I like ketchup). The tofu was bland and I could not taste any BBQ flavour, maybe because of the strong ketchup taste. There were a lot of pickles, which I loved. However, I couldn't help but notice that the wrap was very cold. The filling had that \"just pulled out of the fridge\" temperature to it; I would have preferred that they heat it up more before serving.  My boyfriend got the wrap with veggie pate and enjoyed it, although was still a bit hungry afterwards. The Tropikale smoothie was nothing special; it was not particularly tasty and it was a whopping $7 for what seemed like a fairly small serving. It tasted \"healthy\", so I'm glad they didn't overdo it by adding too much fruit juice, but it also didn't taste very yummy.   On a positive note, the staff were great and friendly. Over all, I am happy to have a vegetarian option so close to Concordia, but for the price I thought it should have been better."}
{"text":"A friend and I, both almost-vegetarian, visited this place while on vacation in Montreal. We wish we had these back home!! It's like a high-quality fast food place or a really lowkey sit-down place, like a cafe. We got a falafel pita, a tempeh pita, and sweet potato salad to share. Everything was delicious, service was fast, and cashier was friendly (thankfully spoke English well too). The atmosphere was very cool--from the liberal use of plants in decorating to the repurposed wine glasses as water pitchers. The food was excellent...if I ate like this all the time I'd have no problem going vegan! The portions are pretty big and I thought the price was well worth the quantity & quality of food we got. Apparently they deliver too. Overall a wonderful experience :)"}
{"text":"This is my go-to for lunch during the week. I usually either get the falafel sandwich or the soup/salad combo. Their portions are generous and very filling, fresh and well-seasoned. I always kick myself when I decide to get lunch somewhere else for a change."}
{"text":"Best falafel I have had.  Clean, quaint, friendly.  My husband and I both had the Traditional Falafel plate; the portion size was large.  All the ingredients were fresh.  Our son had them tempeh which was also very delicious.  We shared an oatmeal stoudt; not heavy like other stoudts.   And to top off our meal; carrot cake - MMMMMM.  We all left feeling well nourished but nothing was heavy on our stomach.  I sure wish there was a Green Panther in Philadelphia."}
{"text":"Meilleures falafels en ville ... Pas sur ... Payé 3$ pour un café noir, format nain ... My first And last time there !"}
{"text":"The staff have certainly improved. The food is great.The decor nice.But really the best food is the falafal.Very healthy.They are open later which is great."}
{"text":"Fraicheur, saveur, bon prix. Si vous souhaitez essayer la cuisine végétarienne, vous devez absolument aller à la Panthère Verte. Le meilleur deal sont les repas de type ragoût dans les pots mason servi sur riz: ragoût brésilien, ragoût de tempeh, ragoût marocain, le ragoût des 3 soeurs. Vous serez satisfait et rassasié. Leurs smooties sont aussi délicieux."}
{"text":"Two words: AMAZING FALAFEL. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. I  had a great meal!! The sauce in the sandwhiches is absolutely fantastic and the alfalfa in the pita is a great idea. We don't use enough alfalfa, I have a renewed love with it now, and want to use it everywhere... not sure the kids will be a fan of my new \"ingredient of the hour\". Go to Panthère Verte, you won't regret it!   The restaurant is also really well located, right on the Avenue du mont Royal, in the middle of all the hustle and bustle that makes Montreal's charm. I stopped on my way up to the mountain. It was a great idea for a quick tasty lunch. I saw many young professionals having lunch business meetings there also, I am sure they appreciate the proximity ans spacious dining area. Great place!"}
{"text":"Best falafel in town! I absolutely love it. Their veggie burger is also good. Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"Visiting from the US.  Came here straight from the airport.  What a nice welcome.  Simple European style decor with outstanding food.  Last night we were taken care of by a very pleasant young lady.  Thanks you!!!"}
{"text":"Cute and fresh cafeteria ambiance.  Not busy and plenty of room for many guests.  Friendly for private date or bring the kids.   Staff is knowledgable and open to explaining their concept.  Enjoy the Veggie Pate pita sandwich- perfect balance of health and filling.  Also, sweet potato fries with this unique green dipping sauce - yum!   They had low-sugar drink options and local brewed drink options - that was kind of cool.   It's like a new and hip Subway - but way better than Subway.  I'll go back - for sure!"}
{"text":"Too expensive for the quality, and it's not because it's vegan that it's healthy those fried falafels..."}
{"text":"Amazing falafel (and well priced) and interesting take on tahini.  Bland-looking salads.  Interesting-looking wines, beers, ciders, and cocktails I didn't try.  Nice location.  I'd stop back in for falafel or a drink with a friend.  I'd go across the street for a salad."}
{"text":"The Green Panther is mostly a falafel/related sandwich place, but they do it haute hippie style, with just the right combinations  -- cruchy, creamy, spicy, pickled perfection. Falafel is outstanding, but I also love the tempeh sandwich. Side salads also like i would make for myself, but even better.  All ingredients are organic, mainly local. It's like going for lunch at your vegetarian friend's house, only she happens to be an amazing cook."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch here with the BVF due solely to proximity to where we were caught up on that trip.  We had both tried and and reasonably enjoyed the other location, so it was considered a safe stop.  I'm afraid I need to concur with some of the other reviewers and give this place the 2 star \"meh\" it deserves.    Although I liked the look and feel of the place, the music was too loud - not at all conducive to conversation.   Service was friendly and efficient.  The problem was with the food.  Essentially this was old-school taste challenged vegan fare - large clumps of grainy chewy stuff surround by veggies that needed to have been cooked more in some cases and less in others.  The tofu balls and quinoa special was a nice portion for lunch but was downright unpleasant.  The quinoa was ok, albeit bland, but the tofu balls were best left off the menu.  Had some of the BVFs (Best Vegan Friend) salad which was pretty good but the tempeh wrap may as well have been chunks of newspaper.    Honestly, I cannot understand how this one gets it so wrong and the one in Mile End gets in right... I actually double checked to make sure they were the same owners.  Maybe it was just a bad day, but I won't be hurrying to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"tried this place out last night for the first time. Went in knowing that vegan places in Montreal have a long way to go. I do, however, appreciate that they are beginning to sprout up more and more in this city.  I ordered the tofu BBQ sandwich and was pretty disappointed. it was cold and I tasted the pickles in the sandwich more than the BBQ.   had the brownie for dessert and it was no match to the other vegan one I had a week ago at Aux Vivres.  Service was lackluster. servers seemed  un happy to be working. Cashier's uniform was SO DIRTY. either he hadn't washed his uniform in a couple of weeks or he had managed to spill on himself, everything he came into contact with that day."}
{"text":"We had an amazing soup and ginger made it even better! Also rise with corn and beans. All food was fresh and brought very quickly. Thank you"}
{"text":"Wow! Meilleurs falafels que j'ai mangés! J'ai personnellement goûté aux falafusion et ma pita était succulent de la première à la dernière bouchée!  J'enlève cependant une étoile pour le prix des boissons. À part de l'eau, toutes les boissons sont très chères. Et aussi pour le fait qu'à 20h, il n'y a plus certaines boissons (faciles à refaire) comme le thé glacé.  Petit minus pour la saleté des tables également"}
{"text":"La Panthère Verte est l'endroit par excellence pour manger sainement et se sentir bien après un repas. Je ne suis pas végétarien, mais je dois avouer que j'ai rarement mangé un chili aussi excellent que celui de ce restaurant. Ma copine et moi y retournons également pour leurs supers falafels qui sont imbattables.   L'endroit est aussi idéal pour étudier avec ses grandes tables et fenêtres. Les employés sont très sympathiques et courtois.   De plus, la Panthère Verte possède également un camion de rue qui propose les plats clés dont les falafels dans différents événements de Montréal."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had a classic falafel with a mix of salads for lunch the other day and everything was tasty, fresh and memorable. If you're in the area and want to eat healthy (and plenty), La Panthère Verte is an excellent choice. The space is airy and luminous, very relaxed. I just kinda disliked the way tables and seats were set up... but that's no big deal. I can't wait to go back and try something else. Also, veg desserts, yes please! :D"}
{"text":"Très bon. Bonne bouffe, originale, bon bar. Ambiance sympa et agréable pour se détendre ou travailler, seul ou entre amis."}
{"text":"Un des pires rapport qualité/quantité/prix que j'ai vu dans un restaurant à Montréal. Cherchez ailleurs vous trouverez mieux. J'ai mis 3 étoiles au liez de une, car la nourriture demeure excellente."}
{"text":"When i entered La Panthère Verte,  i felt like i had just entered Mother nature's Kitchen filled with fresh scents and flavors. The decoration is obviously green but not the kind of green that makes you puke ( because truthfully, i am not usually a fan of green in any type of shade) - with lots of earthy elements  like plants and wood benches - overall the place is enchanting & almost comforting. They were playing some nice lounge music which really complemented its relaxing atmosphere. I also really loved the smell of the place, weird right ?! Well It smelled like Couscous & fresh salad which his heaven to me. The food is of  Mediterranean flavour. I got a Pita with falafel which i enjoyed quite a lot and i also tried my friends vegan brownie, which was one of the best brownies i've ever tasted - perfect for any chocolate lover.  Apart from the brownie, they offered a assortment of vegan desserts like tiramisu . I also briefly saw that they had a fridge with some fresh home made juices that i'll be sure to try next time i go there. They also had a little table set up with a water dispenser and some drinking glasses.  This is a great vegetarian place that i will visit many other times !"}
{"text":"I have to say, their pitas are divine, the falafel is the best in town, and the sauces to die for! A bit on the pricey side but I guess it makes sense (I believe everything is organic and vegan). I love their carrot cake. Unfortunately I've found the side salads hit or miss, or maybe I'm just not a fan of the ones with legumes. Other than that no complaints and they seem to have a fully integrated system in terms of environmental sustainability. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Ce qui est chouette à Montréal, c'est qu'on trouve pas mal de restaurants ou petites places pour manger végétariens/végétaliens. Mais ce n'est pas seulement ça!!! C'est que ces endroits sont de petites merveilles pour nos papilles! C'est simple et bien préparé!   Manger santé, convivial et savoureux pour un lunch... check! :)"}
{"text":"Well I was hungry and decided to try this Vegan place out ! I was told how amazing it was and didn't believe it. There's not great parking in front but I found some off Decarie in front of the SAQ.   So they have a great juice collection ! Freshly premade juices, Vegan Beers and other cocktails. They have pretty amazing beverage and premade food and drink fridge. It's stacked with boocha, tea and other great drinks.   The premade food is vegan Chinese, soups, sandwiches and bowls. You can also order freshly made from their menu bowls, sandwiches, burgers, salads, deserts and much more.   What else can I say this is a pretty amazing place with great non-processed and whole food vegan restaurant. I liked how the pita that I made was soy free ! They accept many forms of payment, there's tons of seating inside as well.   Plus they also have free samples of foods that you can try out. Check it out if your in the area :)"}
{"text":"Excellente nourriture; je suis allée dans plusieurs de leurs restaurants; toujours aussi bon. Celui sur le mont Royal est mon moins préféré puisque le personnel n'y est pas toujours aussi gentil qu'aux autres endroits. Goûtez leurs patates douces et falàfels!"}
{"text":"Lovely, fantastically delicious low-key vegan spot in Mile End. Falafel - Salad- Santa Cruz Drink Combo will leave you sated but looking forward to your return. Everything I've had here has been great. Organic.   Rating Scale: 1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.   2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one? 3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch. 4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible. 5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"Un bel endroit charmant, frais et chaleureux.   Les délicieux jus frais et smoothies dont mes préférés: Choco macca et Mango Chango Lassi ainsi que le jus d'herbe de blé tant convoité.  Les meilleurs Falafels, les plats du jour, le Maffe, Kombucha, les desserts incroyables et les efforts pour respecter l'environnement en plus de la livraison à bicyclette font de ce resto un de mes endroits végé préféré"}
{"text":"Excellent, tout simplement. La Panthère Verte c'est bio, vegan, bon et sain ! J'y ai mangé la soupe du jour (pomme de terre et poireaux), un sandwich pita falafel classique et un carrot cake. Les 3 étaient vraiment très bons, je reviendrais. Leur réputation de meilleurs falafels de Montréal n'est pas usurpée !"}
{"text":"Decently priced vegan fare downtown. Felafel pita sandwich is by far the best and most popular offering, but they also have veggie burger, veggie pate, a few other pitas, daily specials, soup and a selection of salads. Local beer and kombucha, and house made cookies and brownies. Granted, there is nothing new and exciting here, but it's nice to have a solid place to go grab a vegan lunch that won't break the bank. Friendly staff and cute dinning area, small terrace in front."}
{"text":"La Panthere Verte is a great great GREAT place for vegetarian food (I'm not a vegetarian but when the mood strikes, this is my go-to place).  Although a little pricey, all ingredients are fresh and portions are very generous. Sandwiches are jam packed with flavor as well as their salads. The smoothies I'm not crazy about (I've tried 3 so far) but everything else is great! Try it out. There's something for everyone - even the biggest carnivores whom I've had to practically drag here kicking and screaming have found something to eat and enjoy so go and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Nice place I specially liked the table behind which you need to sit without your shoes on. So eastern! I tried the traditional felafel. You can order either a full or a half sandwich  The bread is round and yummy The felafel is tender and goes well combined with the salad and the sauce I enjoyed the experience  It is a must go for veggies ( I'm not one though :) ) I'll visit again!"}
{"text":"Organic, healthy, vegan and a chain restaurant!? All words that do not associate with my types of food, but when you're a part of a food tour that knows its stuff, you give it a fair shot, try two bites and write a review. As you can tell, I had a good time eating at this place.  Please note: for those of you trying to find this place from the food tour, you need to keep on walking down Rue Saint Viateur O until you hit the East side. You'll see the Ubisoft building!  This was the first stop (and new location) for our Mile End Food Tour. This restaurant prizes itself in organic, farm to table, wholesome goodness, and I have to admit, their food was decent. We tried the traditional falafel wrap with cabbage, carrots, pickles, sauerkraut, shoots, tahini and I devoured this wrap before people even started unwrapping their meal. I can't tell whether it's because we walked for an hour, were hungry and was also late to this event, but I really liked the sandwich and the overall decor of the place. The ingredients of the wrap sang in harmony with each other, and the tahini sauce blended everything together without overwhelming your taste buds. Overall, I had a good time, but looking at the prices of the wraps, they could definitely use a price cut.  The ambiance was less hippy than I had imagined, almost had a futuristic vibe with nature imbued in the architecture. There's even an old safe lock in front of the men's room, neat.  Food: 4 stars Price: 3 stars Ambiance: 3 stars"}
{"text":"My first time going to Panthere Verte was when I'd heard that there was a new vegan place on Bernard. I was hungry and excited and hanging out with a friend and very much looking forward to it.   I ordered the veggie burger and to this day, still remember the deep disappointment I felt when I got a steeply-priced pita filled with falafel-like paddies, sprouts, sauerkraut and tahini.  \"This is a meal to make a child cry\", I thought. It was good and filling, but man, it wasn't what I'd wanted.   A lot about the place stressed sproutedness and it made me pine for the vegan diners of Toronto or New York where you can have a shot of whisky with an unpretentious heaping plate of decently-priced diner grub (for vegans).   For awhile, I swore off Panthere Verte.   But then, I went back. I think I needed to shift my expectations. I came to appreciate Panthere Verte as an alternative to Aux Vivres - something that's too expensive price-wise but that's actually quite delicious fare. My fave as of right now is their tempeh sandwich - it's large and filling - the tempeh is nicely seasoned and I find the taste goes very well with the yummy, crunchy sprouts and sauerkraut.    A few months ago, I was there with a friend and I asked for the salad platter and was completely blown away - a very large and very varied portion of various salad selections. It was a pretty, diverse and as opposed to the sandwiches, felt like a reasonably priced eating experience.  Their desert cookies are also quite good. They have samples on display and every time I go, I have one of each sample."}
{"text":"My thoughts about this place usually start with \"hmmm... I am going to get some good healthy food!\" and end with \"Note to self: don't go here again.\"  Most recently, I paid almost $11 for a plate of \"Mac n' Cheese\" that I am pretty sure was made from wallpaper paste and food colouring. I have eaten a lot of macaroni and cheese in my lifetime, and this verison of it was truly disgusting. It takes a real effort to make any kind of Mac n' Cheese taste this bland. On the upside, they gave me a refund. Downside: I was still hungry."}
{"text":"Great food! Healthy and organic! I go anytime i am craving something delicious but want to keep it healthy. Wish the menu had more variety. You have to try the falafels - they are amazing."}
{"text":"i always get the falafel sandwich and it is probably my favorite falafel sandwich around Concordia. Although other places are cheaper, which is why I gave it four stars. It is nice that the sandwich is all organic too. I haven't had anything else there, but even the counter people always recommend the falafel sandwich, so it must be the specialty, I guess."}
{"text":"Nice staff and cute place but i ordered the Tempeh bowl and the rice was not fully cooked and the sweet potatoes were cold."}
{"text":"Very good and original sandwiches. Quick service, nice design. Food was very fresh, a great place for a good healthy original lunch."}
{"text":"L'endroit est très populaire, alors c'est sûr que ça plait à une certaine clientèle. Mais ce n'est pas vraiment pour moi. J'ai essayé les Falafels, le latte et un spécial du jour (curry et riz brun). Pour chacun, c'était Ok mais sans plus. J'ai déjà goûté mieux ailleurs. Surtout pour le latte: ils n'ont pas de lait de vache et pour moi, les substituts ne donnent pas d'aussi bon résultat. Bref, si vous cherchez un bon resto végé dans le coin, je vous suggère plutôt les Vivres, sur St-Laurent au nord de Mont-Royal."}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly staff. Chill environment. I like it! I had the veggie burger and it was really delicious and filling."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food! The serving size of the bowl was a bit too big for me, but the price makes it a good deal."}
{"text":"The Green Panther is a vegan chain restaurant in Montreal. They have a variety of veggie-burgers, shawerma, falafel and few more options. Their sandwich is very fresh with a nice combination of seed sprouts and special sauce (you can choose your sauce). They offer ice-tea, smoothie and some other drinks. It is a favorite place for many vegetarians in Montreal. It is reliable and not very different in different locations. The one on Lacombe is very quiet and often there aren't many costumers. The staff could do a better job in giving explanation about their food and drinks. My sandwich was served cold and not well dressed but it doesn't happen very often. Although you take you sandwich your self and there is no table service they expect you to tip above what you eat which I see it very odd! I will go there again but expect to see some changes in the way they treat their customers."}
{"text":"I liked the variety on the menu, for someone whom is non- vegan/vegetarian, I thought the food had a lot of flavour. I had ordered a half of a BBQ tofu wrap/sandwich and a salad spread with a beer. The sweet potatoe salad was amazing. An exciting adventure for the palate!"}
{"text":"We tried a couple of smoothies and I hated them both St-Basilic and Vert éclectique felt like a weird mix thrown together.  I could not take more than a sip in and the second drink still had bits of date pits in it.  Good thing my family liked them, it would have been a waste for such a high price ($8 each)  I did like the couple of bites I had of the chic burger, despite the overpowering sauce.  The deserts are all over the price map, both about $3-4 , but the date \"energy ball\" is just a bite, while the pecan pie was a respectable size.  The service was very lackadaisical, I Left a $5 tip on a $35 bill when ordering, the guy at the cash could not even muster a smile and I still had to cleanup after myself.  The decor is very industrial hipster with lots of space both inside and out and neatly varnished tables. The door in the men's bathroom used to be a bank safe."}
{"text":"Prix abordables, j'y vais pour le falafel, les sandwichs Tempehtation et le Kebab.  Bon service"}
{"text":"i liked the prompt service. the vegan tiramisu i tried tasted similar to a chocolate cake. the icing was thick on the side of the cake. i would have liked to taste more of a coffee flavor in the cake. i am glad i tried this cake as i thought it was rare to try a vegan tiramisu cake."}
{"text":"I has the falafusion and it was amazing. Great place to get a filling meal without feeling gross later. Recommend if you love falafel and vegan food."}
{"text":"The falafel came highly recommended and did not disappoint: I loved all the crunchy, vinegary veg stuffed into it. Also tried the brocoli soup of the day and it was just ok--a little short on flavor."}
{"text":"Great vegan food on the go. We tried almost all of their sandwiches, only one we didn't fall in love with was the BBQ Tofu (too much pickles and not enough veggies). The sandwiches are prefect food on the go, enough to fill you and for a good price. Probably the reason why we can't stop eating them and haven't tried the other meals! One day my friends."}
{"text":"Loved their food! My family and I got their Falafusion, Tempehtation, and Vegé Burger, and they were all amazing! Each seasoning were completely different and were all glorious. I love that they also have half portions for small eaters, especially because their sandwiches are quite filling. The soy latte was also quite delicious! As for the price of the food, it was pretty reasonable. They also sold to-go meals in mason jars, which I want to try soon. Definitely will go again and highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I love love love their sandwiches. I usually get the tempehtation or falafusion (I think it's way better than the traditional falafel one, trust me on this). I love their half portion option too since I have a small stomach (I usually have to take away a lot of my food). To add on to that, I love vegan sweets/pastries but they can sometimes be really unflavourful when done wrongly, and The Green Panther does it pretty well. I come here quite often because it's literally 2 minutes away from Concordia's Hall Building, where I often have classes. During class breaks or between classes, I'd go and get a bite. It's convenient, it's relatively cheap (I say relatively because I can't afford it every day), and super good. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best vegan food I've ever had. I ordered the Bol Tempeh and I almost couldn't stop eating it when I was full. It was absolutely delicious. My partner ordered the Bol Falafel and he was raving about it the entire time. Not only that but the customer service was wonderful, the lemonade was just right, and the atmosphere had a very rustic and comfortable feel to it. Even if you aren't vegan/vegetarian and just looking for a place to eat, check this place out! It has some really tasty options!"}
{"text":"I eat here with some regularity.  The staff is always friendly, the atmosphere is great.  I don't love all the sandwiches, but I really like the BBQ sandwich, and the Falafels are to die for.  Deserts are also excellent."}
{"text":"Amazing vegetarian food! I had the most delicious falafel with tahini and I can't wait to go back! Vegan/ veggie heaven."}
{"text":"Our friends brought us for the 1st time and LOVED it! They offer delicious and filling food. Atmosphere is good too"}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick bite. I tried the falafel pita- the thing is HUGE and super tasty! I had half for lunch, and ended up saving the other half for dinner. Their take-away salads are also really nice."}
{"text":"Cute little vegan joint. Order your food up front and then seat yourself and then pick it up later when it's ready.... Very simple place to just hang out and catch up with a friend.   I shared the FalaFusion and the VegeBurger. Both came in a whole wheat super soft fresh pita!! We also got the sweet potato fries, hummus and tofu sticks on the side. Both burgers were good but the Falafel Burger was actually tastier.  It came with a special Yogi sauce inside.   The sweet potato fries were a let down. Usually they're my favorite almost anywhere but these had some spice or cinnamon on top and were a little too sweet for my liking. (I personally don't like cinnamon anywhere) I would have very much preferred them traditional. My friend loved them though.  Hummus was super good and came with a little green sauce lightly squirted on top.  The little tofu strips in a barbecue sauce were tiny and  delicious + they come with a tahini sauce on the side that you can dip them in!   Desserts were ok. I actually brought home 4 different ones to share with my family since we were too full! The viramisu was gorgeous but not as moist as I was expecting it to be.  Of course they also sold some kombucha, cold herbal teas, and organic vegan flavored beers! They even had a Recycling, and Compost bin! Way to go"}
{"text":"I am not a vegan but I like eating vegan or vegetarian food once in a while. Went there for lunch today. First thing is service was really quick. I had the tofu bbq pita. The pita is not big but they fill it up quite nicely. The taste is really good. You do taste the tofu so if you don't like the taste of tofu this is not for you. One thing I was not sure of was if it would fill me up or if I would be hungry 2 hours later. I had that sandwhich at 11h30 and one hot chocolate beverage only since and I'm only now starting to get hungry and we are after 4 so it's not bad. I have to say that I'm suprised it sustained me this long."}
{"text":"Location: On the Plateau, a short walk from the Mont-Royal subway. Street parking only - it's not easy finding a spot so choose your time carefully!  The place: P-V is of a decent size, with plenty of windows and sunshine. I find the space to be pretty cozy, and you can enjoy your food while reading a good book or the local paper.   Food: There's not much more that I can say about Panthère that I haven't said in my previous reviews (different locations) - the good is fresh, healthy (veg) and damn good. I love the veggie burger and personally think they make some of the best falafel in town. You can't go wrong with either option, but be sure to try the falafel sandwich because that sh*t rocks.   Service: Good.  Price point: Their prices are fair and pretty decent for a vegetarian place."}
{"text":"Location: Tucked away REAL good in the Mile End. I think Laurier might be the closest subway stop then you'd have to walk from there. Street parking is available. I think that unless you work in the area, you may not even know these guys exist. We were visiting ateliers in the area and found these guys by accident.  The place: The space is nice and still feels new. The lighting's a little too dim for me but if you're going for romance then you're all set. The decor offers up a lot of wood, which I like, and one wall is basically a huge window, which I also like. You order at the cash, then make your way to the end and wait for your order where they'll call you by name.  The food: I only ordered a veggie burger. I can tell you that it was delicious and full of flavor (note that this is served cold), and it was super fresh. Personally, I found it to be very filling so if you're starved, I'd start with the burger then work your way up to something else if you've still got room.  Service: Good.   Price point: The veggie burger was something like $8.50."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to pick up a healthy, veggie lunch downtown. My favorite is the Traditional Falafel sandwich (5 falafel, cabbage, carrots, pickles, sauekraut, sprouts, tahini). First of all, it's huge and I usually get 2 meals out of it. Secondly, it's delicious and full of flavour.  They have several healthy and yummy options, and also have a 'baked goods' section where you can pick up a sweet snack. I definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the area. That said, it's very small, so if you plan to stop in for lunch, I suggest dropping in around 11-11:30."}
{"text":"\"Best Vegan Tiramisu! \"  Their Vegan Tiramisu was entirely genius and memorable and we look forward to trying it again on our next trip to Montreal! Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is great - nice location and patio, and the food is good and reasonably priced! The BBQ tofu and black bean soup were good but not mind blowing, but the falafel was legit some of the best we've had - super fresh, and they put some coleslaw in which was a nice touch. Two pitas and a soup was $20, so pretty reasonable. And I'll definitely be back for more of the falafel!"}
{"text":"Wrote an in depth review of the one on queen Mary but bottom line is i love this place. Got the falafel sandwich and the carrot & sweet potato soup. SO filling and SO delicious."}
{"text":"SUCH GOOD VEGAN FOOD!! Loved it. Took my non vegan dad here and he really liked it too!"}
{"text":"Location: Tucked away REAL good in the Mile End. Unlike my other reviews, I really can't tell you what the best transit route is to get here (probably Mont-Royal metro) but I CAN tell you that there's street parking. I think that unless you work in the area, you may not even know these guys exist. We were visiting ateliers in the area and found these guys by accident.   The place: The space is nice and still feels new. The lighting's a little too dim for me but if you're going for romance then you're all set. The decor offers up a lot of wood, which I like, and one wall is basically a huge window, which I also like. You order at the cash, then make your way to the end and wait for your order where they'll call you by name.   The food: I was under the weather so I only ordered half a veggie burger. I can tell you that it was delicious and if I'd had a larger appetite, I would have been more than happy to eat an entire burger. Super flavorful and fresh. I also grabbed a Kombucha because it's supposed to be good for you... I like the stuff but I'm not crazy about it so don't go out of my way to have it. Needless to say that Kombucha + a sore throat = no good.   Service: Very good. The clerk who took our orders was very friendly.  Price point: The half veggie burger and Kombucha ran me $10 so a bit steep given what I had."}
{"text":"Une découverte. Cuisine originale, saveurs, plaisirs jusqu'aux saveurs des boissons. Génial !"}
{"text":"Très bons sandwiches pita / fallalfel et burgers végé, et les soupes et salades avaient l'air bonnes aussi.. Seul petit hic, il n'y a pas énormément de choix au niveau de la bouffe, si vous voulez y aller 1 ou 2 fois par semaine par exemple Les smoothies aussi avaient l'air bons (un peu dispendieux selon moi - 6 à 8$) Il y a aussi des cookies, brownies, etc.. Très bon service et surtout bel endroit, avec des tables en bois, des plantes, un petit côté exotique!! A essayer!"}
{"text":"Good and reliable food. Nothing too special. The workers were nice. The bowls are hefty and filling. My friend and I shared the falafel bowl. The falafel is really good."}
{"text":"Simple. Great server, standard vegan options. Nothing spectacular, but nothing terrible.   Not the most vibrant setup, but it's calm and bright."}
{"text":"Franchement c'est bon !  Je ne suis pas du tout végétarienne mais leur falafel était vraiment très bon et pour un prix très abordable 4,95$. Même mes ados qui râlaient de venir manger là, ont avoué que cela leur plaisait."}
{"text":"Best falafel in Montreal is right. Though, I haven't yet tried falafel st Jacques.  The falafel here is absolutely delicious, I eat it all the time. The place is low waste as a nice cherry on top."}
{"text":"La Panthère Verte is one of my favorite vegan place. It's delicious, good service and cool ambiance! The \"no socks\" table by the window is really cool for a group of four with his low table and cushions. I highly recommend the Falafel fusion sandwich and cold sweet potatoes salad. They also have a variety of cold meal to take home (no tried yet tho).   I recommend this restaurant for any person who's interested to try vegan food for the first time but you might find the menu a bit short on choice but hey! for a first time is good enough :)"}
{"text":"I have to update my review of this place, for the third time.  Why's that? you may be wondering (or not).  Because I've been there numerous times in the past few months and had much, much better experiences, that's why.  They offer free samples of food at the counter (on occasion), and the food is fantastic.  When I asked, they let me know that I could have as many free samples as I wanted.  I had to keep myself from eating all of it.  Being a typical garbage vegan, I had been accustomed to garbage vegan food (deep-fried and generally unhealthy food, in other words) at other restaurants and I feel like I initially gave Panthère Verte an unjust review.  However, I now feel like I can give a pretty accurate account after having been there nearly a dozen times.  First off, the sandwiches.  I have to admit that it took me a while for the veggie burger to grow on me.  The staff definitely stepped out of the box when they first created it; however, that's not to say that it isn't delicious.  It's just not your traditional veggie burger.  It's basically composed of a pita filled with alfalfa sprouts, chunks of veggie pattie, pickle slices, and doused in what tastes like Big Mac sauce.  Trust me, it grows on you.  I've eaten every sandwich here so far and I found all of them to be refreshing and delicious.  My favourite one is the Chickebab, which again, is amazing.  I once decided to try some of the desserts, and my mind was blown.  The cake is amazing; I'd even go as far as to say that Aux Vivres has some serious competition in that department.  If I had to recommend only one plate though at La Panthère Verte, I'd recommend the hummus and pita.  The hummus is so fresh and delicious, and it's one of the most affordable plates.  I go in there all the time (at varying levels of soberness) for it and can't get enough of it.  And now, my pièce de la résitance of the review: the staff.  The staff is part of what won me over on this place.  They are extremely kind, patient and courteous to customers.  They painstakingly explain all of the ingredients to every customer who asks and what vegan food is to the occasional hungry wanderer who walks in by chance.  Once I wanted to have some beer on tap with a buddy of mine and they apologized that they had no gas to pump beer out that evening.  They did, however, offer us LARGER organic beers from the fridge for the cheaper price of a beer on tap.  You can instantly tell that the staff really care about their restaurant and about their customers' satisfaction.  So I'm a little in love with this place."}
{"text":"My friend is vegetarian so I've been here a few times. I'm not crazy about their regular menu such as the burger, the falafel, the pita and whatever. But I came in to eat again with that same friend and they had...yes! ratatouille! And i LOVE ratatouille. I decided to order it and it was really delicious. Service is in general ok. Food is just ok. Hit or miss sometimes. If I find out they are making ratatouille again, I will definitely stop by and eat it."}
{"text":"Un regal sans viande!!!! Woah.. je suis bleuffé.. je ne savais pas quon pouvais se régaler aussi majestueusement. Un bon combo à petit prix qui vous fera raviver les papilles. Les falafels sont juste délicieux... et la salade du jour époustouflante... je me suis régalée et sans avoir de regret...  la panthère verte m'a vraiment surprise."}
{"text":"Service hyper rapide, employés courtois et souriants et les mets sont délicieux à chaque coup, never disappoints. Le végé panthère est un must!"}
{"text":"C'est une envie de falafels qui m'a amenée à découvrir \"la panthère verte\" où sont fabriquées les meilleurs falafels de Montréal ! Le lieu fait un peu \"fast food\" mais végétaLien et biologique ! On commande au comptoir, on nous appelle quand c'est prêt, on se sert nous -même d'eau... on débarrasse en faisant le tri.  J'ai choisi le falafusion en version pita entière (possibilité 1/2 pita), avec pas moins de 5 falafels à l'intérieur, des crudités, des graines germées, une bonne sauce.  C'est parfait pour une grosse faim, les falafels sont très bons, bien assaisonnés...  Côté dessert, j'ai testé le double trouble brownie, un brownie chocolat avec une ganache chocolat qui ne m'aurait pas fait envie si Audrey Rose ne me l'avait fortement recommandé ! Et en effet, objectivement, c'était divinement chocolaté, avec du croquant, du mou, du croustilant (sucre muscovado ?) même si à peine trop sucré pour moi. Et également le biscuit pomme, patate douce, moelleux et épicé parfaitement.  Une bonne expérience que je serai heureuse de renouveler, notamment pour leurs smoothies et autre jus qui à la liste des ingrédients font bien envie.  Le prix est tout à fait raisonnable surtout quand on se répète que c'est végétalien et bio !"}
{"text":"Nouvelle franchise sur St-Denis depuis l'été 2015. J'adore les falafels de la panthère verte, et j'adore leur philosophie, vegan, bio et écolo. Ils vous feront un smoothie dans votre propre pot Mason, le tout avec une économie de 0,25$. Même chose si vous apportez votre propre plat pour le repas. Sur l'heure du dîner il faut prévoir un peu d'attente (quand même moins que pour la succursale près de Concordia), mais il y a toujours la place en salle à manger quand j'y vais (je prends néanmoins pour emporter au bureau). Il faudrait toutefois que je sorte de ma zone de confort pour commander autre chose qu'un Fala-fusion et un St-Basilic ;)"}
{"text":"Ordered today through Foodora !! One of the best falafel sandwich I've ever had and make me feel good  because it is healthy and organic!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for post-dinner drinks - some wanted smoothies and apparently they are pretty good here. I on the other hand, had a blonde beer which was OK but while they are neighbours to Le Saint Bock, the beer served here is a bit more expensive and not as crafty.  We also got a brownie which was served cold and very hard. It was tasty, but a bit of a let down. I would advice that they come up with a different name for it. Calling that a brownie does brownies a disservice. Otherwise the ambiance was cool, the server was nice, and it was very pleasant to carry on a conversation here, probably better than a noisy bar!"}
{"text":"A la base je suis un gros mangeur de viande, mais là ....  Je pourrais manger de leur falafel vege et leur vegepaté tout les jours.  La place est sympa, bien que petite pas adapté si vous êtes plus de 4.  Mais la où ma langue a halluciné c'est pour les desserts végétalien ... le \"Viramisu\" (tiramisu) un vrai régal mais .... vraiment rien de comparable avec le Brownie, THE BROWNIE il est juste divin magique tout ce que vous voulez.  Si vous passez pas loin, passez prendre un brownie, sérieux. Même si vous n'êtes pas végétalien etc ça vos vraiment le coût."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now as it is a nice light and vegetarian option in a area full of burgers and fried whatnot. The decor is nice though the music is loud and not always in synch with the decor. Service is friendly but be ready for a bit of questionning when you order (at the bar). I spent a few minutes studying their menu and finally settled on one of their pita sandwich (tofu bbq) and was all proud and happy and full of courage to say it out loud to the waiter... Cue the questionning - half or full? As a combo? With a soup or a salad? Which soup? which salad? what size your salad? Drink? ... Whaaaaaat?! I dropped to the floor in a ball and started crying, please leave me alone, I'm cold and I'm scared and I don't even know who I am anymore! After a few minutes of heavy breathing, I picked myself up and managed to drag myself to the nearest table just in time for my food to arrive. I have to say, at this point I didn't even remember what I had ordered and frankly I didn't care. My first surprise was that the pita bread wasn't grilled, making it a bit bland to eat. Then, the sauces were not all that good and the salad was almost in the same state as me. Lastly, in my confused and dazed state, I remembered the waiter telling me that a half pita and a salad was enough to fill you til the next day but I was still starving and I had just spent more than 20$. I don't mind paying more for organic and local especially if it's good but I do mind paying too much when I need to cross the street and go eat a burger afterwards 'cause I'm still starving."}
{"text":"I am a flexitarian. A semi-vegetarian. When given the chance, I tend to opt for the vegetarian dishes. Sometimes when I am feeling cheap, I will go to Green Panther. After my last experience at the St. Viateur location, it will be my last resort for vegan food in the Mile End.  Good : I only get the half pita Chic Kebab with no carrots and extra sauce. I usually get the half pita because it's $3 less than the full pita... the difference is 1 inch more of bread, but no extra filling. Get the sweet potatos if you get a chance, it's very flavorful!   Bad : I've tried the Tempehtation (eh) and VégéBurger (meh) on separate occasions, which neither are outstanding, and yet I still go back because it's cheap food on the go. I usually order a side of sweet potatoes for an extra $3 when you order a pita and it's a pretty generous portion. However, at the St. Viateur location, they gave me 6 pieces of potatoes for a side. I can't even exaggerate this...$0.50 per potato cube. When I complained that this isn't the right size because I've been to the Mackay and Mont Royal location and ordered the size salad, which was huge. The counter person rudely replied 'no this is the right size... well this is the size we serve here.' I asked for more potatoes, not your left kidney. I should've told him to shove it but I was hungry. I was really annoyed with this particular incident.   Bottom Line : To be fair, I don't mind the food, it's just this particular location that had a really rude staff member. I will still be eating at the Mackay and Mont Royal location though."}
{"text":"Great spot for casual healthy (and vegan) food. Their take on Falafel it pretty great, with whole wheat pita, sprouts and perfect falafel bowls. Try the popeye smoothie and you will not be disappointed. It's very spacious and you could come with a big group or work on your laptop."}
{"text":"pros: Great place! Good organic food!   Enthusiastic stuff!  cons:  High turnover rate, often new stuff is clueless and service could vary from good to bad"}
{"text":"We went this place today the experience we had wasn't great ...it's overly priced for the portion size they serve .... food was ok ...not great"}
{"text":"Worst food ever. I am a huge fan of crud essence and panthere verte was next door so I decided to try it. Worst food ever. I had the BBQ tofu, sooooooooooo disgusting I left everything. And my husband had the falafels they were so greasy  oil was leaky off. Terrible experience. Hated it. Will never go again!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. I had the Bol falafel and the honkey monkey smoothie. First of all the falafel was perfect, as it's often over cooked most other places. The bowl was filled with greens, hummus, lentils, sweet potatoes and other food stuff. The bowl have enough for 2 people, and it's good in its own freshness. The smoothie was absolutely amazing! The taste and consistency was spot on!  Will go again."}
{"text":"Went to eat there 2 days in a row. A hidden gem indeed, had the salad melange and the herb flavour was amazing. Falafel with sauce was also good. Prices are great and one will leave with satisfaction."}
{"text":"The staffs are nice and friendlh The food is great, loved the ragout and the sweet potato salad. The viramisu was a bit too sweet for me and didn't taste too similar to a tiramisu  The price is fair and the decor is nice"}
{"text":"Very tasty vegan food. Most of their dishes are usually falafel and other vegetables wrapped in a pita. But it tastes much better than any falafel I had elsewhere.  They have dessert items like sweet balls made of dates and chocolate and \"viramisu\" (vegan tiramisu) and also sparkling flavored tea."}
{"text":"This restaurant brings up some interesting philosophical questions for me. Should I stick to tradition, to comfort, to the classics, because I know they're delicious and never disappoint? Or should we all try to experience new exciting things - live on the edge of cultural and social mixing? How can one way be better than the other?   These are the thoughts that arise when I try to decide between the traditional falafel and the falafusion at Panthere Verte. Both sandwiches are SO DELICIOUS (just like the rest of the food here - I could survive for the rest of my life on the ChocoChipMonk cookies). This place isn't lying when it says it has the best falafels in town.  The atmosphere is casual, fun, and hip. There are plants! You feel at one with nature. You'll want to talk to the staff forever. And eat forever, of course.  Definitely give this place a try if you're in the area and prepared to fight thieves! Your friends will be so jealous of your pita, they'll try to steal it away."}
{"text":"I opted for the salad of the day as it was one of the only gluten-free options on the menu. When I asked the cashier to give me an idea of what was in the salad she told me it was a combination of \"all the salads in the window\" and welcomed me to have a look before ordering. I saw a beet salad, sweet potato salad, tofu salad, quinoa, green salad, and others and so placed the order expecting them all to be included. (9.75$, coming out to 13$ with tax, to-go container charge and tip.) When I finally opened the container I was so disappointed! Mostly lettuce, 3 pieces of sweet potato, and a spattering of quinoa. No tofu or beets and hardly filling enough to be a main course for lunch. DEFINITELY not worth the price. I can safely say I'll never go back. I gave it two stars because, to be fair, the salad was tasty, just way overpriced."}
{"text":"\"Am I a little drunk? Maybe, but I still give it a five,\" my husband.  Bright, clean, open atmosphere. Small tables for small groups and one large table for, I presume, communal dining. Very casual and delicious food. It feels healthy in here :-)"}
{"text":"Not bad fast vegan food but confusing to order and they hide the salad bar??  Weird- Why hide those delicious greens -sketchy!  Also menu is far from where you order so be careful they get it right- they messed up our order and had to call someone to figure out how to do that.. finally got order we asked for No potatoes 3 times- they gave us potatoes lol and short changed us 10cents!  Staff is lacking omegas!?  Those falafel balls make it ok tho"}
{"text":"Great place, nice atmosphere. There aren't that many food choices but the BBQ Tofu is good. The price is a little steep, especially for being located right beside Concordia (hello, there are cheap students living here!). Nonetheless, I still pop in there once in a while to get one of there amazing (and expensive) smoothies (the banana mango one is to die for)"}
{"text":"If you are staying downtown and are a vegan or a vegetarian this place is a must try. They offer vegan food that is very generously sized. Place is neat, clean with hip decor and is open till 10 every day. Staff is very friendly and speaks perfect English. I suggest falafusion and tofu BBQ. Both are filled with fresh veggies. If you are into pickled veggies than try temphetation. It had too much sauerkraut  for my taste."}
{"text":"Pas besoin de présenter La Panthère Verte !  Le combo bio et végétalien est gagnant et ne laisse indifférent personne. Le service est toujours courtois et souriant. De plus, savourer son sandwich avec une bière de Beau's je dis oui sans hésiter.  A quand une succursale sur la rue Masson ? De cette façon, je pourrai en manger tous les jours :)"}
{"text":"Indeed the BEST felafel in town!! The soups are amazing too.  Fabulous baked vegan goodies,and this is coming from someone who'd always HATED vegan baking! Try it, try it all,you'll love it !"}
{"text":"I loved the food! My choice was jackfruit shawarma with tzik sauce- don't know how they pulled that off but was super. Nice fresh pita. The bowl my sister got was lovely- fresh, big and tasty- too big for her, that's how I know how good it really was..."}
{"text":"Finalement, j'ai été initiée à La Panthère Verte! Est-ce que je peux manger ici jusqu'à la fin de mes jours s'il-vous-plaît?   Mes expériences précédentes en matière de falafels n'avaient pas été très concluantes, mais maintenant j'ai fait la paix et mon bedon est heureux. Les falafels sont tellement goûteux, on dirait presque de la viande, mais on est heureux de savoir qu'on se délecte d'un délicieux met végétalien. Prix abordable et service ultra rapide, j'aime les options \"Pita\", \"Demi-Pita\" et \"À Côté\", qui conviennent à tous les budgets et les appétits! Et que dire des desserts.. Le biscuit pomme, patate douce et pacanes ainsi que celui à la banane chocolat et epeautre etaient succulent mais le brownie - OH LE BROWNIE. J'en rêve encore, je crois que je vais y retourner aujourd'hui juste pour en manger un autre. Aucun mot ne peut le décrire, laissez vos papilles gustatives vous fredonner la chanson. Et tout ça sans uf ni beurre! Décidément un endroit de choix si vous vous intéressez à l'alimentation végétarienne, ou pas. Je veux dire, de la bonne bouffe c'est de la bonne bouffe!"}
{"text":"La location sur Mackay est mieux adaptée pour venir avec des amis tandis qu'ici c'est parfait pour se prendre un take out ou venir manger en solo. La place a plus des allures de petit café que de restaurant comme c'est le cas sur Mackay. Par contre, la bouffe reste la même: Les meilleurs falafels en ville, de bons smoothies originaux et des desserts à couper le souffle, tout ça dans un range de prix très abordable. Et je veux pas me répéter mais... LE BROWNIE GUYS, LE BROW-NIE."}
{"text":"Rather meh vegan food. Sandwiches are basically just a bunch of random, cold things added into a pita. If you're looking for food to warm you up you're in the wrong place."}
{"text":"I have eaten here on several occasions, in and also for take out and delivery. Each time I regret it. The food seems to all have the same taste which leaves a garlic aftertaste that repeats on you for days. The falafel pita (falafusion) is 60% sprouts. The tempeh pita (temptation or something) is 60% sauerkraut. The salads are 70% wilted mesclun greens and then a sprinkling of some good stuff. So overpriced for what you get, it's offensive. As they fill up the sandwiches/ salads with the filler stuff and not the goodness.  Smoothies are inconsistent - sometimes delicious I liked the choco macca until they became different every time I ordered; and sometimes bad that I stopped getting them. What is consistent, is the rude staff (last time I ate in was at their St Viateur location, so possibly new) who are grumpy and inattentive. They were just hanging out and chatting with each other despite a line up of people. They are slow to serve - there seems to be so many staff with very little actually getting done. The pita is soft and fluffy and delicious and their falafel (on the side, not the pita) is pretty tasty. Everything else, is a big thumbs down. Sorry."}
{"text":"I think my expectations were to high after reading they had the best falafel sandwich in Montreal. Which I don't agree with, it's not a typical one as I expected, it is an American version of it. I would have to go back and have some of their other plates to give this restaurant another chance. Service was really good."}
{"text":"A very good option for a healthy, vegetarian meal. We ordered delivery for 12 people with only one small error in our order. The food was hot and fresh and portion sizes very generous. I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"The fusion falafel sandwich, which I had them add some spicy sauce to, is the best thing I've eaten in Montreal so far. Absolutely delicious, and filling - and the employees were really nice as well. I'm going back tonight, mmmm..."}
{"text":"A truly vegan restaurant serving wonderful Falafel . Located in the Mile End section of Montreal.   An environmentally friendly restaurant which is kind of minimalist."}
{"text":"I work near this location, so I visit fairly often. As many Montrealers already know, they have truly top-notch falafel and any of their falafel sandwiches are a win for me. I was a little disappointed that they removed the BBQ tofu sandwich from their menu, as it was one of my favorites. The new items are OK, I tried the asian-style bowl but was not very impressed. As long as you stick with the classics (falafel sandwiches, salads, cookies and desserts), you will not be disappointed!  I have to say this location can be pretty slow for service as well."}
{"text":"Honeeyyyyyy this place was so cozy and the desserts were fantastic! Girl I would come here again just it's super expensiveeeee. But other than that a great place."}
{"text":"Good falafel, and good vibe. Has the one thing I hate about these places, patrons with their heads up their assess. And it's funny, they do not indicate a difference in prices between eat-in and take out, but if you want a container to take your food to go, they charge you... Funny place, would get the falafel again if I was taken here but would not seek this place out again."}
{"text":"I just want to start off by saying this is my new fav healthy restaurant!  It has a great little cozy feel to it and a friendly staff.  I ordered the falafel full pita which I loved great flavors and the falafels weren't dry at all. Can't wait to try there other choices. For dessert me and my two girlfriends decided to split the tiramisu cake and holy moly was it ever good! I highly recommend this place for all you healthy eaters great menu and also great drinks I had the iced coffe which was also good they also offer smoothies as well."}
{"text":"La Panthère Verte is my veggie go-to place for delicious and very reasonably priced food in a chilled,welcoming atmosphère. Everyone I've taken there has really liked it too.  The menu is not big and is limited to sandwiches, soups and salads, plus a few smoothies . But everything they do here they do WELL, the pitta's are stuffed full...my favorite is the BBQ tofu which has huge chunks of tofu in it . The salads are also really good and you can get a large plate with a mixture of a few different ones which is nice...  They also have a bar at this location which is cool and rare for a veggie cafe like this, a beer goes perfectly with the pittas !"}
{"text":"So, I've always *hated* falafel until I had it here. That should give you some indication of how good the food is! You know, falafel is typically dry and hard to digest, right? Not this stuff - moist, flavorful and crispy, with a super yum dipping sauce that's some kind of soy yogurt base. MMMMMMMMM. This is a beautiful little spot to grab a snack and an espresso in the heart of the Mile End. I stopped in after shopping at Jeans Jeans Jeans, because I was feeling a bit peckish and wanted to try something new. Just so you're clear: THEY HAVE DELICIOUS FOOD. All organic and vegan. The staff are super nice and the prices are right! You can eat in, gawk at all of the gorgeous décor, or choose something to go from their sweet selection of take-away foods, all cleverly packaged in reusable mason jars. It's warm + cozy, relaxed and makes you feel like you've done your good deed for your body for the day."}
{"text":"One of the best vegan place I've been to. The falafel are exquisite and they'Re not dry at all like they tend to be elsewhere. The price is more than reasonnable and it is a really cute spot to hang out and chill."}
{"text":"All their pita sandwiches sound and look amazing, and they do not disappoint! I had a falafel pita with a salad, and both definitely hit the spot. This location is quite small, but if you don't go at a busy time you're likely to get a table. The line up will tell you how good this place is, but they move quickly so the wait wasn't too long. Relatively cheap too, so I will be back the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great falafel, super friendly staff! Place is cute and clean! I'd recommend for a quick bite in the city."}
{"text":"Lacking sophistication/complexity.  I am all for this type of food but we ordered the dish of the day which was a chickpea stew and it basically was chickpeas, squash, and basmati rice. There was no flavor really to it and it was essentially bland. Com'on let's admit it.. vegetarian food is bland as it is.. why not give it some life! Maybe it was just a bad day and hopefully the other dishes are more rich.  I also tried their falafel wrap and was pleased with the pickles and the sauce they use. It definitely had more personality than the other dish I tried.  Their carrot cake was pretty tasty however it wasn't as moist as I would have liked. They should find a better way to store them or make them more fresh as it tasted old.   3 stars for offering a healthy alternative that is desperately needed in Montreal -1 star for dry dessert -1 star for bland tasting dish of the day   Good luck guys! I am spoiled in California and so my bar is pretty high.. keep up the good work ;)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Good food, portion sizes can vary and the prices are a bit expensive. Family friendly vibe which is nice. A bit slow sometimes. I am writing this because I've been stood here for 20 minutes waiting for a smoothie..."}
{"text":"I was looking for some cafes and fast food places around Le Plateau but I was so hungry when I got out of Mont Royal station that I decided to give this place a try even though It looked like it served strictly vegan meals.There are also several places to sit down inside and a few tables outside.  My meal and drink tasted unexpectedly awesome! I had the Falafusion in a half pita and a St. Basilic smoothie. The Falafusion was rather filling with lots of fresh tasting veggies on top of a maybe two crispy and chewy falafels. The St.Basilic smoothie was also filling and refereshing even if it was not sweet. Ok, I do like my frappe and shake style drinks to be on the sweet side, but the pita and smoothie went well together. At the end of my meal I felt refreshed without feeling any greasiness in my stomach. In other words, the food did not weigh-down my stomach :-D This is probably the first vegan place that I have ever ate at and in Montreal of all places! Definitely liked it :-)"}
{"text":"I had the Bol Falafel which was really delicious and filling but almost $20! Seems kind of high in my opinion. The bowl had lentils, sweet potato, pita bread, alfalfa sprouts, cabbage (the best part, so tasty), hummus, lettuce (filler), and falafel of course. These items at the grocery store would cost much less and it wouldn't be difficult to make."}
{"text":"The food here is is terrific. We had the falafel sandwich and it was awesome. Probably the best falafel we've had. We also had the vegan burger which was quite good. Two of us were full for $18. The restaurant was pretty cool looking too."}
{"text":"This is the official meeting spot for the Mile End Food Tour I joined. This vegan meets coffee shop meets cool vibes restaurant has everything going for it! Awesome up-cycled decorations all about. Lots of tables inside and outside. A phenomenal, big covered front patio perfect for people watching and just being outside!!   Tried the Falafel Pita Sandwich here. Amazing!! Interesting: They make a homemade tahini sauce, a great veer from the usual tzatziki sauce. Best falafel balls I've had in my life!! Perfect combination of herbs and spices. Even the sprouts were fresh, crunchy and full of flavor!  Whether you're simply thirsty, need a space to get some work done, vegan, vegetarian or just plain up for a change in the norm, this is a fantastic place to drop in."}
{"text":"Ha la Panthère Verte, nous y sommes venus à plusieurs reprises et c'est la première fois que je fais un avis dessus. Vous vous en doutez que je reviens c'est parce que j'aime leur nourriture, particulièrement la pita Falafusion qui contient tout ce qui me faut pour mon petit corps :) Leurs frites de patates douces avec leur mayo végétalienne sont très bonnes et on en prend à chaque fois car c'est un peu notre péché mignon ! Je ne peux que vous le recommander : bon, végétalien et bonne gestion de leurs déchets :)"}
{"text":"I love this place, and sad I don't live here to enjoy it. I ordered tempehtation and my hubby ordered falafel traditional. They are both good and satisfying. Mine is a little too salty but I love the sprouts."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype... As a vegetarian I love trying new places. I was in the area and figured I should give it a shot. Food is mediocre, and very over priced. VERY overpriced. It was good, but not worth almost $20 for a 1/2 pita and salad. The server was barely able to answer my questions, and the pricing on the menu isn't clear. I was hoping to let be this place. I've heard so many great things, but I leave very disappointed. I highly doubt I'll ever be back. It's too bad, I was looking forward to coming here more often... As I said, I don't get the hype :("}
{"text":"I go here often because I work right next it. I have to say every time I go I am always disappointed in some way or another.  he wait is always so long. Why they only have one cash boggles my mind. I was just there to order 5 falafel balls that's it and waited 10 mins in line and 20 mins for the food. Only one  cashier and one server. Not only that, the server was incredibly slow and was not working in a manner you should be working when you have 10 customers waiting for their food. I bought cake once and was asked to pay for the to go container. Just now I ordered their yogi sauce and it's super watered down and has no taste. The Falafel balls are cold even. Honestly very horrible service and a disgrace to the quality food that the green panther usually has."}
{"text":"The falafels are good! Staff really nice and Ive found the menu pretty original! Its also well located in downtown Mtl"}
{"text":"By far my favourite veggie/vegan place. I highly recommend the falafafusion. Their falafels are simply delicious, and the flavours of various sauces completes the pita so well. You have the option to eat in, or bring it to go. They offer various desserts, salads, sanwhiches, drinks and more. They're also an organization that is very health conscious and eco friendly, they recycle, reuse or compost everything it seems."}
{"text":"Top falafels!!! Came here spontaneously during a conference and un expectantly found some wonderful smoothies and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Parce que je suis française, je trouve que la Panthère Verte est une révolution. Oui, parce que j'étais habituée, passée 19h, à ne plus trouver pour me sustenter à moins de dix euros (mais pour 2000 calories à la bouchée) que les kebabs les plus suspects de la savane. Parce que, même si cela tend à changer, vegan ne rimait que rarement avec sexy, et que dans les restaurants, les falafels étaient souvent fades, gras, tristes. Alors bien sûr, je reste chauvine, et je ne vais pas cracher dans la soupe, la gastronomie végétalienne française se dévéloppe de plus en plus, mais les associations restent encore frileuses et surtout les prix s'envolent vite. Alors quelle joie de découvrir la Panthère Verte en arrivant à Montréal ! Avant de poster cet avis, et pour le bien fondé évident de ma pensée, j'ai pris la peine de tester à peu près tout ce qui se trouvait sur le menu, et je peux officiellement dire que la Panthère Verte est devenu un de mes restaurants préférés sur cette terre. Pourquoi ? 1) LE CARROT CAKE. Mon Dieu, le carrot cake quoi. Absolument végétalien, ce qui, pour moi qui suis intolérante au lactose et avait presque dû complètement abdiquer tout ce qui était cheesecake/carrot cake/tiramisu etc, est une bénédiction. Les parts sont vraiment gigantesques, et même si le glaçage est un peu (trop) sucré à mon goût, ce gâteau réussit le pari vraiment très sympathique d'être bon ET relativement sain, on sent qu'il n'est pas plein de trucs saturés ou aux noms bizarres. En fait, vous faites presque un cadeau à votre corps, si si vraiment... 2) Le rapport qualité/prix. Pour une dizaine de dollars, les possibilités de se régaler sont VRAIMENT multiples... Combo sandwich/soupe, combo salade/soupe, combo soupe ou salade + falafels ou bâtonnets de tofu ou tempeh, assiette houmous/falafels, plat du jour... Avec un budget réduit, on ne s'ennuie jamais ! En plus les produits varient tout le temps, alors très peu de chance de se retrouver avec deux fois exactement la même assiette... (Bon ok, sauf si, comme moi, on développe une obsession assez poussée pour le veggie burger, mais ce genre de choses est tout à fait personnel, vous pouvez décider d'être normal.) 3) Les SALADES ! Ceux qui ont traité les salades, vegan qui plus est, de rabbit food ne sont jamais allés à la Panthère Verte, c'est certain ! La \"petite salade\" est déjà vraiment bien copieuse, tout ça pour six dollars et des brouettes taxes compris, et surtout deux éléments ne varient jamais dans la salade : les patates douces rôties et le mélange de salades vertes maison avec graines et sauce vinaigrette verte secrète. Et bien je peux vous dire que ces deux petits trucs là vous donneront envie de leur écrire des poèmes.  4 (le bonus de la rédaction) Il y a tout le temps (bon ok très souvent) des trucs en dégustation... Prenez un air un peu distrait, accoudez-vous près des caisses, et picorez (finissez !) l'air de rien l'assiette en libre service où traine aléatoirement falafels rondouillets, cookies peanut butter/chocolat, boules d'énergie... enfin moi j'dis ça....  what is good for your soul is good for your belly, vive la panthère!"}
{"text":"Vegans Indulge!!! Eating a vegan diet while traveling is quite challenging. Rest assured that PV is satisfying most, if not all, of your vegan culinary wishes.  Great atmosphere, friendly hippy-like staff."}
{"text":"The place is small and cozy. The service is fast. I always get their salad and it never disappoints just as their falafels don't. The only down side I would say is the price. Adding a combo seems not to expensive when it's written on the board but it can add up scary fast. I found their falafel sandwich was \"meh\" and didn't have much taste to it due to the overwhelming pita. All in all if you're feeling like something fresh I would opt for the salad with a side a falafels (but you will be charged more for a dipping sauce which I also find a bit ridiculous)."}
{"text":"They recently changed their menu and their prices went up. It is now really expensive and honestly the quality is nit there anymore. I took a tao bol yesterday and it was basically a rice but l with a few cheap tickets fu cubes, some cooked salty veggies and a few barely cut raw broccoli. All swimming in a cheap sugar sauce. U wasn't feeling well all night. Disappointed as i used to like this restaurant."}
{"text":"Resto parfait pour un lunch par une journée d'été ( printemps) ensoleillée! Les sandwichs dont très gouteux et l'endroit est super agréable alors que les immenses portes tout autour du local sont ouvertes. Des comptoirs sont disposés de sorte qu'on puisse s'assoir face à la rue et profiter du grand air. Le décor est super sympathique avec ses éléments en bois destructurés et l'on s'y sent comme à la maison. Il est aussi possible de manger sur la terrasse. Un endroit excellent pour un fastfood (+santé) végé! Aussi, le chaï latté est délicieux et le sandwich Falafusion un vrai petit plaisir en bouche! C'était la première fois que je mangeais de la Panthère Verte ailleurs qu'à leur food truck mais certainement pas la dernière!  P.s: j'adore que l'entreprise encourage les gens à apporter leurs propres récipients!"}
{"text":"The best falafel in town! That's there motto and there sooo right!  To be vegan or not vegan is not important. You'll find there salads excellent and the service fast and attentive.  For 11$ you'll have the perfect meal : tasty and healthy. Try it, you'll come back again, I garantee you!"}
{"text":"You have to try their falafel sandwich, it's delicous, healthy and affordable. What more could you ask for!   I always get the mafe when they have it as meal of the day, it's a stew made from eggplants with a sauce based on peanut butter and tomato sauce. It's fabulous! Add the hibiscus drink and falalef balls and you got yourself a perfect meal.    What I love most about this place is how ''clean'' and light you feel after eating their food. Everything tastes so fresh and healthy."}
{"text":"Les meilleurs falafels en ville et c'est bien vrai! La fraicheur de leurs plats et leurs saveurs sont sans pareil et le personnel y est très sympa également."}
{"text":"I had the balloo berry smoothie and it is delicious! Friendly staff, extensive menu of healthy items for lunch for about $5. It is a great addition to Queen Mary - it's good for the waistline and the pocket book."}
{"text":"Best falafel in town and I just discovered they serve Beau's all natural beers on tap (including my favourite Nordic ale). Ten thumbs up out of ten!"}
{"text":"Ok, this place was amazing! It's a fast food chain that sells falafels, smoothies, sandwiches, as well as to go options. I went to two locations while in Montreal and had a great experience. I had their hummus plate, which was a great value, and their chai smoothie which was also great! Their falafel wraps are also good!"}
{"text":"My go-to place for lunch and dinner when I used to live in the neighbourhood, and still now if I have some time in-between my classes.  I am vegan and it can sometimes be tricky to find a place to eat downtown for a reasonable price. I absolutely love their Falafusion, Choco Maca Smoothie and Brownie (one of the best I've ever had!) and I mostly order one of those three items as I know what I like, but I would recommend trying their salad as well (very filling!) or their daily special (never disappointed and you have a full meal for 11$!) as well as the rest of their sandwiches (my roommate absolutely loves the Tofu BBQ one).  I would personally not recommend the desserts on the creamier side (Tiramisu, for example) as they are very heavy and the taste is bland because of the overwhelming (I would say cashew?) cream. But this is only a personal taste and someone else might like it.  On the downside, the place is very small and get very crowded between 11:30 and 1:30, you often have to wait in line and you will probably won't be able to find a table. But if you can order from them, take away or if you want to go at more appropriate times, when it is not too busy, you definitely should try it as this is one of my favourite spot to eat downtown, if not my ultimate favourite."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise. This place is simply amazing!!!!!   This cute little masterpiece is tucked neatly into the side of the street. It's comfy atmosphere welcomes you with open arms. The staff was beautiful and so well trained. We were treated with such kindness and appreciation. I'm so so so happy this place exists. Vegan, vegetarian an non vegans would love this place. There is something for everyone!   10 out of 10 on the food list. This place will be my regular spot for as long as it is here! Well done!"}
{"text":"The Yelpers who claimed this place serves the best falafel weren't kidding. My husband and I ordered the mango lassi, bbq tofu pita, traditional falafel pita, and their special of the day- it was a curried tempeh stew with rice and salad. I wasn't blown away but the food was pretty good. I thought the tempeh stew tasted bland but my husband enjoyed it. Tofu pita was good, the pickles and bbq sauce gave the sandwich the right kick, lassi wasn't unnecessarily sweet like many other places. And the falafel pita...I'd also say the best I've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"J'avais entendu parler de l'endroit par une collègue de travail végétarienne. J'avais un peu de temps avant d'aller travailler et pas de lunch. J'en ai donc profité pour essayer ce petit paradis végétarien.  Le resto est petit, mais on peut manger sur place. La caissière m'a accueilli avec un beau sourire.   J'ai commandé le sandwich falafel. Le sandwich était bon avec beaucoup de légumes, de la choucroute et une bonne sauce et fait à la demande. La portion est assez grosse pour satisfaire tout le monde. Si jamais ce n'est pas assez, vous pouvez rajouter une soupe ou une salade à votre repas. Les desserts ont l'air appétissants, mais je n'avais plus assez faim pour y goûter. Par contre, j'ai pris une Kambucha au thé vert et citron.  La boisson était un peu chère en comparaison avec le prix du sandwich, mais c'était rafraîchissant et cela m'a donné de l'énergie.   Bon endroit pour dîner si vous êtes au centre-ville ou avec des copains végétariens."}
{"text":"Falafel : excellent Carrot cake : excellent Boisson au gingembre : pas bon du tout  Jus vert : bon"}
{"text":"Fantastic smoothie (you really get something for your money!) , it's more like a cream though. Lovely atmosphere and seats! I felt in love with this place the moment I entered, everything about this spot is perfect to me :D the falafel was very delicious too, and not \"boring\" at all.."}
{"text":"I just wanted a falafel sandwich. I remember how good it was when i tried it from their food truck. I thought that perhaps it would be less expensive if i go to the actual location. Nope! sandwich will run you 10$ after taxes. And for someone like me who doesn't want a salad inside my sandwich, thats unacceptable. The falafels taste great, service was slow considering it was lunch time and we are in the university area. This place would get a better rating if the value was there. but it isn't."}
{"text":"AWFUL PLACE. I've been coming here occasionally for many years and EVERYTIME they make a mistake in my order. It is absolutely ridiculous and very frustrating because I often go between classes or during my lunch break from work and they waste my time, everytime. They are also completely apathetic about their mistakes. I've been to the panthère vert on Mont-Royal and have nothing but good things to say but whoever is working/running the Panthère Vert on Mackay is not doing their job !!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I got the Veggie Panther with a side of hummus and a falafel  which rounded to 11 dollars which is so inexpensive and very filling. I can't stress enough how good the Veggie Panther sandwich was - I would definitely recommend anyone to try it. They also had little tasters of the Peanut Munch Break (a peanut butter and chocolate chip cookie) on the counter which I adored. If you're a peanut butter fan it is a must try!"}
{"text":"Really great! The staff is fantastic and helpful, the food is delicious and vegan, made on the spot (it seemed), super tasty falafels.. the list goes on and on. I would definitely go back! Love it!"}
{"text":"Another awesome vegan and healthy food chain in Montreal! It serves more like salad based food. I have been to Mt.Royal, St.Viateur  as well as Mackay. Somehow I like the St. Viateur , the best. A lot of sitting space, beautifully done interiors.  The Falafels are way better than any Mediterranean restaurant,crisp from outside and mouth melting from inside.The butternut squash soup has a subtle aroma. Their soy-based milk products and meat substitutes are perfect. It a self-serve place, with nice sitting space in summers but for winter not much. I won't go there for dinner but for lunch or brunch, it's good.   Rue Mackay, itself it a paradise for vegan people, I could find 5 vegetarian/vegan rest, in just 100 meters. I did not like their cookies, they were too hard. but rest all was remarkable."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the gluten free vegan daily special with yellow curry, rice, and salad.   So delicious.  So delicious and filling.  It was my first time and I was very impressed."}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients! The falafel and veggie burgers are quite good here but a bit expensive for what you are getting. Casual atmosphere - very quaint. My only complaint is that they add way too much ketchup on the veggie burger for me so be warned. Now I just order it without ketchup."}
{"text":"The place offers direct competition to Crudescence next door, but their styles are different:  Crudescence is a sit-down and order type of deal, La Panthère verte is more casual, and serves warm stuff. Honestly I'm not sure whether they are vegan or vegetarian, but they are delicious for sure! I was a bit hesitant to try them out (\"really?! I've had falafel before..\"), but I was hangry.   The place is small/cramped. Someone comes in with their bike and you might just have to order to go. A downside is the design of the place: if you are unlucky, you might sit at a table right in front of the door, if there's a draft you'll be chasing your meal all over.  The big rush starts at 12:30 so come early if you want a table! I got a falafusion and a medium hummus side. The cashier seemed a bit surprised, and I get quickly got why: those sides are massive! A medium hummus can easily be shared between two since it includes a full hummus plate and pita bread. The falafels come warm, in cute little baskets. They are a bit on the small side (I got the half), but very filling and tasteful. Feel free to chat with the cooks, and sample some bites! I'd love to come back and try the full-sizes (and maybe a mason jar of smoothie if they weren't so expensive)."}
{"text":"L'endroit est sympa et la nourriture est bonne ! Les prix sont corrects et les portions dans les assiettes sont parfaites ! Même les personnes qui ne sont pas végétariennes ou végétaliennes apprécieraient ce restaurant. Un \"must to try\" ! :)"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, I went to Bali and fell in love with tempeh and now I must try everything that contains it.   So, the tempehtation sandwich is really tasty and full of veggies; I love their homemade pita breads (fortunately a lot sturdier than traditional ones). The carrot cake is great too, although the icing is like toothache sweet. Nice vegan option in the Concordia area, a bit pricey as this type of place tends to be. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ok so I have to admit it, when I think about vegetarians, I imagine people sitting in a field, surrounded by rabbits and eating salad.  As a meat eater, I was always a bit worried about going to a vegetarian restaurant, thinking it would be boring for my taste buds.  Well, I kinda knew it already, but I was an idiot.   I tried their Falafusion (Falafel balls, lettuce, sumac onions, carrots, sprouts, yogi sauce) and.... Wow. That was really delicious, I surrender (yes I'm French, of course I surrender)  Had a little salad next to it, and I was full.  Not so convinced by the Celery/lemon/apple juice I had, celery was too much present.     Vegetarians, my bad, your food can definitely be good.  But Talking about rabbits made me want to eat some paté now."}
{"text":"I tried the traditional falafel and it is really good! Everytime I studied in library, I rush to to this store and bite this so delicious and healthy food! Yummy I strongly recommend. As for the smoothie, I tried banana mango before it is not the best choice."}
{"text":"Vegan Heaven. Delicious! I'm often in the area and not too enticed by food that seems vegetarian or vegan or wholesome in anyway. Taste rules and I workout so I can eat full flavour fatty things. While touring around with a vegetarian however we decided to give this place a chance and I'm happy we did! It was delicious and simple. I definitely want to go back to check out a few more dishes!   This was honestly a game changer. I've tried vegetarian and vegan before but it wasn't ever really tasty. It was acceptable and palatable. This one has me reconsidering meatless Mondays and stuff.   Disclaimer: I always wanted to be a vegetarian. I just suck at it. I hate it. I'm addicted to meat. I'm in conflict because I love animals and the environment but I love eating as well.  Looking forward to trying it again."}
{"text":"Wow, with a vegan friend in town, La Panthere Verte proved to be an excellent place to dine. I recommend getting a duo combination as their in house beverages are terrific combinations to their hardy variety of plant based food. My shawarma (see attached picture) was fantastic, better than any I had in Israel. My friends cleverly named \"tempetation\" (possible sic) was even better. I believe La Panthere Verte deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for their tempeh creation that had a fantastic sesame taste. In fact, it is hard to find a word to describe how good the food tasted. For Vegans and non-vegans alike, I recommend stopping by and trying their food (they also offered a Poutine I'd like to try next time). The interior was nothing fantastic, but offered games and amble seating for families."}
{"text":"Wow. Fantastic falafel. Fresh ingredients. Cute little place. Wife (non-vegetarian) loved the BBQ tofu and the chai-bella smoothie was the best chai smoothie I've ever had. One star off because the pita is just pita--nothing special--and it's all pita. Otherwise, brilliant. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Surprised at some of the negative reviews here. Had the BBQ Tofu wrap, the hummus and Pita, and a brownie - all were great, good portion sizes.   Small, casual - but I liked the ambiance."}
{"text":"I am no big fan of veggi restaurant. Since I already had some snack before lunch time, I'd like to give it a try. Surprisingly good.  I have noticed this place several times. I found other branches on St-Denis and Snowdon metro station. Also I saw their food truck on Yul Eat, and they advertised themselves as best falafel in town.  I had a demi sandwich of falafel. It was very tasty. With the fresh sprouts and salad in it. The falafel ball is green inside bragging how healthy it can be.  They offer self-served tap water with a H2O sign hanging. Really cute. This place is a surprise reminding me that trying new things always make me happy. Not to mention it was also a surprise to find yelp check in offers 20% off."}
{"text":"I don't know what I would do without these guys. Their soup and salad is always a perfect meal for any time of day...I'm the pickiest when it comes to soup and they never do it wrong. They also just revamped a few menu items. Their new falafel is AMAZING...a tad on the salty side but totally fine for a treat. They also win at putting the environment first with compostable/reusable everything. It's the best vegan place for my everyday needs...Get more locations!"}
{"text":"Falafel, pitas végés, MIAM! Bonne bouffe bio avec du goût.   Les assaisonnements font toute la différence entre du végé fade et peu inspirant. La Panthère verte tombe dans le mille (lien à faire avec mile-end ici) avec des épices qui rehaussent l'expérience gustative de façon agréable et bien dosée.  Le décor est brut, avec des tables en bois massif. Le tout est généreusement fenestré, ce qui ajoute une impression d'espace.  Le service est rapide et courtois. Parfait pour un pita à mastiquer lentement, selon les principes du slow food."}
{"text":"This place has amazing pitas! The homemade falafels are really excellent. I wish I could eat some again! Note that one half pita was definitely not enough for me, so my advise would be to go for the entire one without hesitation.  We also tried the carrot cake which was very good but not exceptional. So better take more falafels and skip dessert! :)"}
{"text":"I love this location. It is pretty large and nice. They have a huge outdoor sitting Area. The Food is always on point. Light and healthy"}
{"text":"We started our food walking tour here and we had a falafel sandwich! It was one of the best I have ever had!!  I was basically full after eating it. Half a sandwich is huge.  Apparently, everything about this place is vegan, natural, earth conscious and sustainable. Cool cool.   I loved the falafel, they were perfectly prepared. They were tasty, warm, like homemade little crispy balls of happiness! I also like how they put sprouts in the whole wheat pita.   Super tasty, very healthy, extra delicious!"}
{"text":"An awesome new Panthère Verte, right in the heart of the Plateau!   By far the largest and best lit location, but that's just the tip of the ice berg... there's also enough seating for at least 40 people, which is a huge step up from their other spots.   Menu is the same as the other locations, but daily specials may be different. In any case, personal favourite is the FalaFusion. Ready made salads and desserts are also available."}
{"text":"La panthere verte on McKay is next door to Concordia University and not far from McGill so naturally, it has a very studenty feel.  It is a bit of a hippy cafe and we went there for lunch 3 times and the food was consistently fresh and delicious.  Do not miss their absolutely delicious falafel pita bread, they are possibly the best I have ever had.  Also if the place is packed (which it is at lunchtime), you can always go right next door to Crudessence."}
{"text":"La Panthère Verte n'a pas volé son titre de meilleurs falafels de Montréal. Allez-y pour le sandwich traditionnel et/ou demandez l'assemblage de salades du jour (quinoa, fèves, betteraves, etc.). Aussi, le smoothie Noble Grenoble est un incontournable pour les fans de café!"}
{"text":"C'était délicieux ! Belle ambiance! Le Pita falafel traditionnel est un délice!!!:D  Les smoothies ont aussi l'air délicieux !!:) Bien contente de m'y être arrêtée !;)"}
{"text":"Fast food végétalien par excellence !  Comme la plupart des initiés, j'adore leur falafel, leur plat #1 sur leur menu. Très content qu'il y ai finalement, une Panthère Verte dans le Quartier Latin, un ''fast-food'' végétalien de cette chaîne montréalaise. Si, c'est votre première fois, il faut vraiment essayer leur falafel traditionnel, délicieux! Ils servent aussi des soupes, salades, smoothies, desserts végétaliens. Ils ont aussi de la kombucha, de l'eau de coco et cafés. Cette succursale possède un bar servant de la bière & du vin bio. Intérieur quoi qu'un peu sombre. Wifi gratuit. Carte de crédits acceptées.  5/5 visité à son ouverture en juillet 2015"}
{"text":"Falafel in this place is very good. Juices and soups are fresh and tasty. It caters primarily to students of a university nearby so the environment is friendly and informal."}
{"text":"Veggies to me are like hot girls in high school. I hate them but wish I was their friend. Anyway, lame analogies aside, one day I was hungry, didn't want to walk far from home, so decided to give this place a try.  I ordered a half pita of Tempehtation and a serving of falafel balls. The balls blew every vegetarian ball I have ever come across in my life out of the water. They were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. If anybody ever remembers from the early 2000's, KFC once made these mash potato balls coated in their famous fried chicken batter. Panthère's falafel balls aren't quite that decadent, but the fact that they remind me of these ingenious little KFC potato creations say a lot about their tastiness. Tip: the staff recommended the (delicately sweet) hippie sauce for them and she was bang on. As for the pita... yawn. I chose Tempehtation because I love tempeh. I grew up in Indonesia eating tempeh and am always excited whenever I find it here. Unfortunately, it didn't taste quite like how I imagined it. It tasted bland and the too-soft texture didn't add any value to the pita. Also, I thought there was way too much sprouts (alfalfa?) in the pita and that sproutiness ended up masking the taste of the other ingredients. One other feedback I have is that the beer is very expensive. Granted it's Beau's, which is organic and all that, but at $9 a pop, it practically doubles my food bill. Overall I would definitely go back for just the falafel balls. For $2.50 a portion, they make a great afternoon snack."}
{"text":"La carnivore en moi, sceptique par le sans-gluten, le sans-rien-du-tout mouvement très présent ici me soufflait que je resterais sur ma faim, et que tout serait fade. Cliché, mensonge à moi-même et supposition ! J'ai pris une claque gustative, que ce soit à la première qu'à ma deuxième et (et oui) ma troisième visite. Les assiettes sont énorme, très savoureuses : plein de mélange de saveurs et de produits frais. Les falafel (fusion !!) sont divins et la salade de patates douces un régal. Je retire tout ce que j'ai pu dire (ou penser) et je suis ravie de voir que ce genre de place existe, où les plats sont aussi bons que sains. Où les carnivores et les végan peuvent enfin s'entendre ;) Ah, et laissez-vous tenter par la tarte pécan. Une claque gustative !"}
{"text":"I am married to an Egyptian, so if he deems this as close to home as it gets for Felafel - well then its probably the best in the city.  The Traditional Felafel sandwitch is to die for I also personally love the Felafel salad. They have a whole range of vegan desserts just staring you down when you enter.   I'm not super into the take of your shoes and sit policy for their window table...i mean its Montreal i don't want anyone taking off their shoes in a restaurant, but that's what happens when hippies fall in love with the Middle East and make your amazing vegan sandwich."}
{"text":"A lot of my fellow vegan restaurant lovers have been badgering me to give this restaurant a try, and I finally got to do so. To be completely honest, I wasn't super blown away.   For starters, the restaurant is pretty small (not ideal during the lunchtime rush). The ordering procedure is also quite strange, in my opinion. You basically order at one counter and then wait by another counter for your name to be called. Their system works in theory, but everything becomes pretty hectic when the restaurant fills up. It gets fairly crowded when everyone is waiting to order as well. There were several people waiting by the door to enter/ get out of the cold. The service was great. The cashier was very helpful, and polite.   The food was okay - nothing special. Not the best compared to other vegan-friendly restaurants in Montreal. Then again, my options are usually limited because I am unable to consume gluten. I will admit that the meals containing gluten ordered by others looked good!   Overall, decent food. Reasonable prices. Great service. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"id say this place is A -OK not much to choose from if you like coming often tho"}
{"text":"$5 falafel that is fulling and delicious and stuffed with great things like marinated veggies and sprouts and tender but crispy falafel balls? Yes please. The half-pita sandwich was just the right size for lunch for me, but if you are someone with a heartier appetite, I'd recommend the full pita. The location is nice, if a bit cramped, but I'll be sure to be back to grab pitas to go as the summer picnic season gets into gear."}
{"text":"Great vegan restaurant!  We were lucky enough to find this place on our way from the Metro to Mont Royal. Had the Veggie Burger and it was very good, the atmosphere at this location is  very casual.  They have additional locations in Montreal..."}
{"text":"Wonderful local vegan chain!  We ate at one of their other locations then came to this one because our experience was so good.  Near the Berri UQAM Metro stop on the lovely Rue Saint Denise, this location had a better, more relaxed atmosphere than the Mont Royal location.  Had the Tempehtation sandwich and it was superb, the Hippie sauce is particularly good.  For some reason I did not try the falafel at either location, hopefully they will open some locations in the States soon so I can try it!"}
{"text":"J'ai adoré le concept de fast food végé et la place est vraiment agréable ! En revanche, un peu déçu par les plats, franchement pas très goutus. Mon sandwich Tempehtation n'était vraiment pas exceptionnel. Le végépanthere de mon amie était bourré de mayonnaise.  Je passe mon chemin, dommage."}
{"text":"C'est rapide et c'est bon. Le style est à mi chemin entre un fast food et un restaurant.  J'ai essayé le sandwich Falafel et la part de gâteau Viramissu. Le Falafel est très bien assaisonné et se mange très bien. Le Viramissu est délicieux mais le topping est un concentré de sucre écoeurant impossible à terminer tellement il y en a.  À signaler au niveau de la conception du restaurant : gros bug = tout est trop haut ! Les tables sont trop hautes, idem au water room, l'évier, le sêchoire (bruit assourdissant - je déteste ces appareils). Pourtant je fais 1.86 m !  Soit ils devraient trouver une solution pour baisser ces tables, soit ils devraient installer des chaises plus hautes. Sinon on doit lever les coudes pour manger. C'est assez inconfortable.   Je pense que je reviendrai pour y essayer les smoothies."}
{"text":"La Panthere Verte exceeded my expectations. Their Tempehtation sandwich is so so so so SO delicious. They flavour thir local! tempeh in a magical marinade, the veg, sauerkraut, sprouts, and amazing sauce harmonise beautifully. For $9.50 it's not the cheapest but definitely worth it. I'd give the place 5 stars if the restaurant looked cooler. It would make the experience perfect if decoration, seats, etc. were a little more tasteful."}
{"text":"Just met this amazing place! Vegetarian and organic! Tried a \"spécial du jour\" that was a Curry Tempeh!! Delicious! Lovely place. Very nice service. And prices are fair! Worth trying, even if you're not vegetarian. Like me!! Lol."}
{"text":"Vegan, bio and delicious!!!!!   Everything I've tried here was delicious. Sandwiches, salads and... sangria! Very cozy ambience at Saint-Denis street. Very nice service.   Special attention to the cocktail options. You will find a classic Brazilian caipirinha, that I haven't tried yet... But you will tell me your review in case you do.   If you like this place, you must try the food here... If you don't like... Give it a chance! Who knows..."}
{"text":"It's always a delight to find all-vegan restaurants, coming from Buffalo which has none. It's even better when the food is delicious, healthy and fresh and the staff is friendly and helpful. La Panthère Verte is a place I would visit at least weekly if I lived here. And there are five locations to choose from!  I ordered the Veggie Panther--a pita stuffed with végé pâté, lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, pickles, sprouts and mayo. Tasty and satisfying. My girls each ordered the traditional falafel, which they loved, and an order of sweet potato fries, which came with a sweet mayo. Fruit smoothies for the girls, and an organic sangria for me rounded out the meal.  The multi-tasking cashier/order-taker/bartender forgot to deliver my sangria, so when I went back to the bar, he apologized and offered me a free cookie. That's the kind of service that keeps people coming back."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, I ranked it relatively high since its 5 min away from my house. If the Falafel is fresh you will feel like you are tasting heaven if not..you are on your way to hell since dry/old Falafel is the last thing you want to eat. You need to make sure the Falafel is fresh (and it is usually is during busy hours) and then just sit back and enjoy."}
{"text":"I will write it in advance: This might not be the cheapest place to eat, and they serve a different Falafel version (from the traditional one) but its fresh healthy and tasty, and that's the most important thing right? A falafel is only good if it is served fresh not an hour or 2 later all dry and tasteless like you might find at other places in Montreal. This is a great food choice for a full meal or a snack. Go try it :)"}
{"text":"La Panthere Verte is a simple and quick vegetarian option if you are seeking a healthy or greasy vegan meal in downtown. It is located near two other vegan restaurant. This area is the \"Wholy (holy whole food for long) Trinity\" for vegans.  La Panthere Verte has a great array of Southeast Asian inspired smoothie options. Most ingredients are organic and locally sourced. The Mile End location can be very busy if you run into the lunch time crowd.  The best part is La Panthere Verte's weekly sales.  Soups in mansion jars are sometimes sold for $1, hummus or baba ganoush are sold for $2 and 5 pitas for $3.50, 4 veggie burgers for $6.99. Extremely reasonable if you are seeking for a quick meal and can reheat the food at home.  I would highly recommend La Panthere Verte if you are (a starving student like me) in the area."}
{"text":"good comforting vegetarian food uncomplicated but a bit greasy"}
{"text":"Though I'm not vegan by any means, I was pumped to try La Panthère Verte due to the amazing reviews.   I came here around 12 on a weekday and the place was fairly packed. The line had about 15 people ahead of me, but it moved quick. You order at the counter and then take a seat to wait for your name to be called.   I got the falafel bowl and BOY was that tasty. And massive. The most amaaaazing tahini sauce. Unbelievable hummus. Great pita bread. A nice amount of shredded greens at the bottom. My. Mouth. Is. Watering.   I closed off the lunch with a chocolate chip cookie that was (of course) vegan - banana based. A great choice to end a delightful lunch.   Truly 5 stars as there's nothing that could have been better - price was on point, atmosphere was great, wait was minimal, and food was beyond amazing. Looking forward to my next experience here."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick, but healthy, bite to eat. My wife and I both enjoyed the broccoli soup and falafel sandwich. Indoor and outdoor seating good for people watching on the main street in the Latin Quarter."}
{"text":"Étant une grande amatrice de viande, j'étais réticente..  Je les ai connu par leur Food truck, et leur sandwich pita falafel est dément !!!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute delight for any vegan, and a must try!  I first tasted it at Heavy Montreal, they had a food truck there. I ordered a falafel pita, which was super fresh and had the most DELICIOUS little falafels in it.  I have since returned to the actual restaurants to eat (I'm not even vegan). Their desserts are ok, I guess a good option if you have a restricted diet (if you don't,  I would suggest going elsewhere) but this place is worth going to for the falafel alone!"}
{"text":"I only got to eat here once, but I LOVED it.  The food was delicious and exactly what I hoped for when placing my order.  Having a full vegan menu with soups and all really goes a long way with little accents like house made croutons.  This is definitely a great spot and I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"La Panthère Verte has a lot going for itself: a convenient downtown location, social & enthusiastic staff, reasonable prices*, healthy vegan food, & a comfortable & welcoming space (love the socks area! Basically an elevated table in a little alcove near the window, surrounded by cushions, where you can sit cross-legged, chill & be the envy of everyone else). As if this was not already enough, it can also boast of serving the best falafel in Montreal.  It comes in a pita that can only be described as \"moelleux\", a term for which I cannot find any satisfying English equivalent. Moelleux it is, then. In addition to the falafel, the pita is stuffed with carrots, alfalfa, some coleslaw, delicious pickles, and THE glorious tahini sauce. I must have eaten this plump little wonder about 7 or 8 times now, & I'm always reluctant to try anything else on the menu... With good reason.  Thing is, despite all the positive elements I have mentioned above (plus the peanut butter-chocolate cookie, how could I forget!), La Panthère has a number of serious flaws. It seems, in my opinion at least, like nothing it makes can compare with its falafel. I have tried the tofu BBQ sandwich, which was good, but not exceptional; I have also had the veggie burger (to be fair, at the other branch on St. Viateur, but oh my Lord, I have rarely experienced such bitter disappointment) & the végépâté, which was simply bland. The fact that ALL the sandwiches are served in a pita further takes away from the appeal of the place. It really gets redundant & I sure would appreciate more variety. Finally, the brownie was too dry & friable; I was using a fork & actually had a hard time eating it because the bits just crumbled when I cut them. A much better one can be found at Aux Vivres.  *Reasonable in so far as we exclude juices & smoothies. Grossly overpriced, these ones.  Still, with all that being said, I will keep going back for my fix of falafel - really, really, REALLY the best in town. You can't afford to miss it."}
{"text":"My wife doesn't have hairy armpits, nor do I live on the Plateau, but I actually enjoyed my lunch here. Great food, the falafel wrap actually tasted like the real thing."}
{"text":"I tried the classic falafel sandwich here, which is apparently what put this location on the map, and I can see why! While technically \"fast food\", this is truly fast food done right. The falafel was so good and perfectly fried, the tahini sauce was creamy and perfect, the cabbage added the perfect amount of crunch and flavor.. everything was wonderful.  It's really cool to learn that this place has a lot of sustainable practices, including locally sourcing everything they can, recycling just about everything, and even composting.  I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Perhaps my rating is a bit harsh- if I had never eaten at the original location i would give it 4 stars easily, but as it happens with most expansions, the Panthere Verte has lost a bit of love and care in the food it serves now, at least at this new location on the corner of St. Viateur and Casgrain.  But it is across the street from the best yoga studio in Montreal, So I just keep going back! Oh yeah- they serve beer now too- added bonus for those of us who still allow ourselves to indulge outside of this healthy food movement."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place whenever I'm in a hurry and want something that somewhat healthy. I usually get the  half Falafusion or the half Végéburger but the Falafusion is by far my favourite . The service is quick except during lunch time where the place gets crowed and there aren't any tables. There prices are reasonable for what you get and would recommend it too anyone vegan or non-vegan."}
{"text":"I love this food but am repeatedly frustrated with this location. Everytime I come they are always out of ingredients and/or the food takes forever for the stadf to prepare."}
{"text":"Super beau local où on mange en communauté (grande table, comptoirs, plus petites tables aussi). Très bon service et les prix sont très raisonnable. J'ai pris l'assiette humus: elle vient avec une excellente salade, 5 falafels et un pita. Tout ça pour 11$. J'y retournerai!"}
{"text":"Une envie soudaine de falafels, ou de manger bio tout court à Montréal? Filez à la Panthère Verte !  C'est vraiment très sympa comme concept, et très abordable en terme de prix. Ils proposent quelques formules avec sandwichs, salade ou soupe du jour + boisson dans les 10-12$.  On a choisi tous les deux une pita aux falafels et ses légumes. Dommage, à l'heure où on est passé, il ne restait plus de soupe, donc une salade de nouilles pour l'un, une russe pour l'autre.   Les sandwichs aux falafels sont vraiment très bons, frais, copieux, par contre j'ai été moins emballée par les salades, j'ai trouvé qu'elles avaient moins de goût.  Très sympa sinon le soda bio en bouteille à la canneberge, et les différentes boissons proposées. Plus de place pour le dessert, et pourtant le maxi carrot cake m'a bien fait de l'oeil, une prochaine fois !  Un bon spot pour manger sain et bon sans se ruiner."}
{"text":"Their falafels are amazing. Everything always tastes super fresh, and their pita bread is addictive. Decently priced too.  I'm giving 5 stars for the service though. I ordered through justeat and seems like there was a problem with my order as it was taking very long. I called and the manager said he'd redo my Falafusion so that it was fresh, and asked whether I'd prefer complimentary falafels or a cookie. In the end he sent both!"}
{"text":"J'adore la décoration ! Grande fenestration, bcp de plantes , plusieurs tables, bon service, healthy delicious choices mmmmm"}
{"text":"Really like the atmosphere, the light and the food. Toucher les tables vernisées et tres douces en attendant la bouffe fut un plaisir. Choix de smothies et de desserts. I will come back !"}
{"text":"Si Montréal ne manque assurément pas de restaurants pour les végétaliens, les 3 établissements de la Panthère Verte valent vraiment le détour. D'ailleurs c'est la deuxième fois en 3 jours qu'on y teste les meilleurs falafels. Il s'agit d'être bien certain, question de professionnalisme.  Et, oui, le FalaFusion ferait tomber les plus carnivores d'entre vous. Les jus sont frais ; les desserts sont un supplice... (Le Viramisu a de bons arguments)  Tout cela pour un prix tellement abordable, on mange sain et le cadre est agréable... Mention spéciale pour la possibilité de composter les restes en partant (si d'aventure il y en avait). On adopterait bien cette Panthère à Paris... Dommage de ne pas pouvoir attribuer une note supérieure à 5 ...!"}
{"text":"Bon burgers fais de pain pita vegan avec des excellentes frites de patates douces et deux liqueurs douces poir 30$. La mayo est vegan tout est vegan. Musique électronique pas trop forte on peut y boire du vin. Côté négative il faudrait deux salles de bain une seule n'est pas suffisante."}

{"text":"Well if you have to eat you have to eat.... Vegan and gluten free you sometimes take what you can... The tempeh was yummy but served with rice, potatoes and pasta... really.... okay there were some fresh veggies but not enough... Food served with no love at all"}
{"text":"My Favourite is the falafafusion pita. Also love their sweet potato salad and their banana chocolate chip cookie. New to the menu are their sweet potato fries and they are delish!!  Come here for lunch around once a week. The line can be rather large, but tends to move pretty quickly (10 mins)! Once you order the team has a pretty fast delivery of your food (5 mins). Definitely not as fast as a subway etc...but a good option!   Prices for a full pita is around $9. Expect to walk out of here with a $10-15 bill.   Of all the green panthers, this one is for me the best designed. I love their large outdoor seating area as well!"}
{"text":"TEMPEHTATION:  Full pita sandwich is $8.45CAD  VEGEPANTHERE: Full pita sandwich is $8.45CAD  Neither of these really blew my mind to be honest, BUT I really liked them if that makes any sense. I don't think this is a MUST for tourists but if I lived here, I'd for sure eat here often. It's light and it tastes good.  THE PLACE: I really liked this place actually! Lots of windows! I saw some people with laptops, I definitely would come here to work."}
