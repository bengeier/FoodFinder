{"text":"This place picked up where the previous tenants, Gordo's left off. Decent sized menu, good variety. It's a small place & can get crowded on any given day, but it's perfect for quick to go orders. I highly recommend the soft tacos. My preference is the carne asada tacos. Meat, white onion, cilantro. Simple, yet amazing taste. Their salsa is also very good. Happy to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little spot! Is has a cute inside and great family atmosphere.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  The food is well priced with large portions and every bit of it is delicious!! I didn't take pictures of our food, but the presentation is great.  I personally had the Super Chimichanga with chicken, and the chicken was very juicy and flavorful, the guacamole was fresh, the refried beans were wonderful!  The Horchata is also wonderful here! Sweet with just enough cinnamon be be distinct but not over powering.  I am only visiting the area, but if I were to live here, I would definitely be a regular here!!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I walked in and the atmosphere was adorable. Our waiter was adorable and accommodating. We received chips and salsas and drinks right away!  If you like authentic Mexican food that is delicious, this is the place. It's in an adorable neighborhood and the staff is friendly and the service was timely!  The refried beans and Mexican rice rivaled my moms!! The meat for the tacos was tender and flavorful!  The proportions were fulfilling.  The only reason I didn't put 5 stars was because the bar is not open yet and I was looking for a tasty margarita!  I can't wait til that happens!  If their drinks are as good as their food, I may just have to move here!!!"}
