{"text":"I've always loved the food from this restaurant; it's been my favorite for many years. I've never found anything I shouldn't in the food, so hope the other reviewer's experience was a one-off."}
{"text":"absolutely disgusting. the eel has fins on it, the rice was basically pudding, the shrimp had its shit sack, and the wasabi was jello........... no stars for you."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken chow mein, a side of rice and an egg roll. I live a 6 minute drive from the restaurant and the order was placed during regular dinner hours. The food showed up early but somehow cold, and the chicken was beyond gross, floppy and weird texture and soggy. The egg roll was soggy too and the rice was beige and looked like leftover rice that had been reheated, it was very dry. I will not be ordering from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"They like to focus more on takeouts than serving restaurant patrons !  One visit found us getting a pot of tea that was nothing more than a pot of lukewarm water with some tea leafs in them.  It's a chopsui place."}
{"text":"Ok no. Takeout order through Just Eat.  Arrived on time, everything I ordered was there (two common complaints about this restaurant). As a waitress, I know that sh*t happens, but when my sushi box has not one, but TWO hairs in it, AND a bug, as well as being unreasonable warm, there's no way I can trust to eat what was delivered to me. What is going on in your kitchen!? Saved my peanut butter dumplings for later only to have the huge disappointment of them not being tossed in the sauce but only topped with it, meaning I had sauce on only 4-5 of my 10 dumplings. At least I have spring rolls..."}
{"text":"A modern looking delivery menu (in a easy to read purple and black font) arrived a few months ago, and seemed worthy of a try. Better yet they had opened a second location fairly close by. Unfortunately by the time I ordered it had closed 2 weeks prior. They were still forwarding the phone number and delivering to a wider area which was cool.  The order taker was pleasant on the phone, despite having another line on hold. They were honest, and said to expect 1 hour, but the food arrived in 45 minutes and was still fairly warm to my surprise.  Ordering one of their combos seemed like an affordable way to try several dishes. See below for what it included;  2 Egg rolls - with an excellent chunk style filling, not the typical shredded fermented tasting one most have. The shell was not as crispy, more dough like - but still good when fresh.  Dry spare ribs - were a little too chewy (almost like beef jerky), and the sauce was super sweet. *watch out for bone shards.  Cashew chicken - On the pro side were lots of crisp cashews, on the con side the chicken had the look and consistency of oyster mushrooms (which if actually mushrooms are a delicacy of sorts - not so much when the chicken kind).  Chicken fried rice - was darker in colour than most, perhaps from more soy sauce...  Peanut butter dumplings - (not in the actual combo) same scenario, a rich tasting dough with a thick sweet peanut butter sauce, but virtually a non-existent layer of pork filling.  Funny enough looking back, I don't think the meal came with a fortune cookie, hmm, not to stereotype Chinese take-out, but that's an odd first.  Either way, for the price and the efficiency, it was a nice no nonsense meal. More four for former, and 3 for later."}
{"text":"This is the worst delivery place I have ever seen. Not only did it take more than 1h30 to receive the food but when I called to complain the person did not even apologies. And finally when the food arrived it was barely hot and all the sauce was dripping in the bag. Do not order from here if you are planning for a delivery"}
