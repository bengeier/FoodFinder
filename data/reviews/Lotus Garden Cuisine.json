Try the House Egg Foo Young"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! So good.Clean and friendly. Have never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Very slooooow.  There were only two tables of people, and it took forever for our food to be served.  The appetizers were all gross.  The BBQ pork was over-cooked pork slathered with BBQ sauce.  It did not taste like the two items were cooked together. The wantons were nasty!

The sweet and sour chicken was okay - nothing special.  The chicken in hot garlic sauce was pretty good.  The shrimp and scallops were good - it was mostly vegetables, but the flavor was decent.  The pork fried rice tasted old, not fresh.

The restaurant was hot as balls.  My back was totally sticking to the pleather seats.  We just moved to this side of town and were hoping for a go-to Chinese place, but this is NOT it."}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese food restaurant. They have a great inexpensive lunch special with a big list of main dishes to choose from, plus a cup of soup, fried rice and a spring roll. The food is always fresh and hot, not to mention delicious! Today I got Mongolian beef (I ask for it not spicy) and my bf got the teriyaki beef, which I think I might get next time."}
{"text":"THis place was recommended by a friend of mine.  I wanted to try a new chinese place in the southwest of las vegas.  I ordered orange chicken and asked for the sauce on the side.  It came as I ordered it.  The staff was O-K, but not really enthusiastic.  She did check on us frequently and accomodated everything that we asked.

My husband ordered the moo soo pork,  I didn't like it and thought it was too salty, but hubby liked it.  

Needless to say as much as my friend ranted and raved about this place (he drives all the way from the northeast side to eat here) I didn't like it as much as I thought.  I would not be my frist choice, but I would be willing to try this place again...."}
{"text":"Small quaint chinese restaurant located in the SW part of town just off the freeway.  Many other chinese restaurants to choose from as south Rainbow has a strangly high asian community - I live there too lol.

They serve more \"american chinese food\" as their business is more lunch people - but way less sauce and fresher than most.  

However - little known secret - if you want AUTHENTIC chinese food (less sauce/sugar and no MSG) they will make it for you.  But, if you like the PF Changs style cooking (which I admit at times I do too!) - this place is comprable and at half the price and no wait!"}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews but this Lotus Garden is a place worth writing about. It's a little over eight miles from my house and worth every mile.  I'm not going to itemize because each time I'm there I get something diferrent.  I Haven't been disappointed yet.  On the rare occasion when something's not quite right they take care of it immediately and if the dish is a bit over seasoned it's not washed down.  A whole new dish is prepared.  The place is small and cozy.  A nice place to go to for quiet conversation and great food.  If I could double or triple the stars I would.  I've recommended Lotus garden to others an they all really enjoyed it.  No fancy high end dishes.  Just good old Chinese dishes with great variety and great prices."}
{"text":"The food was good . Service was good. Very clean little Chinese place . The little intro chips and sauce are different but good. The food was fresh and hot . Potstickers we're really good ! Would defiantly recommend."}
{"text":"I finally found a Chinese restaurant that has decent, quality food. If you like eggplant, you must try the spicy eggplant dinner! The eggplant is cut in chunks with noodles and some vegetables. It has a great flavor; I was pleasantly surprised.

Another great entree we enjoyed during this meal was chicken egg foo young and beef and snow peas. The egg foo young consisted of thick pieces of egg omelets with chicken in a tasty sauce topped with chives. The beef and snow peas entree consisted of a lot of fresh snow peas, onion, watercress, and carrot. 

Although the food preparation is fairly quick, the table-side service (e.g., refills of hot tea, more napkins, check) is slow. When we were in, only one server was on the floor handling everyone in the small restaurant dining area. Regardless, she was nice and the atmosphere was comfortable, clean, and nicely decorated. This complemented the dine-in food experience.

I will be back - next time for take-out!"}
{"text":"Good food for the Price.  Went here with my family and it was empty around 4pm.  The hostess/waitress for us was very forgiving with customizations to the menu.  I wanted to do their \"combination\" platter which included a bunch of stuff but didn't include General chicken.  She made no fuss about swapping that in for me.  If Archi's Thai is too busy but you still want that asian kick  Come chick this place out.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Sweet & Sour Pork and Egg Drop Soup... So glad I checked Yelp and found Lotus Garden! It is so good! It easily fed two people - and the price was very reasonable! We'll be back... sooner than later."}
{"text":"Everything here is good the food is good, except it may take a little long to receive your food. The only huge problem I have is that, my water for some reason tastes like some sort of chemical. I've never tasted water like this, it tastes like maybe chlorine or like there's sanitizer in it!!! I tasted my friend's water.. taste normal. I asked my friend to try my water and they even taste the chemicals!! I feel like if I just disregarded the taste of the water, I would probably end up in the hospital later. Better safe than sorry. I asked for a change of water and it still tastes strange. I don't know if I want to come back here again."}
{"text":"I ate here because I was hungry and craving Chinese food. After a disgusting experience, I wish I never ate here in the first place. I wish you could rate in half stars but then again it wouldn't deserve that rating either.

First off: There was only one waitress doing everything in the front of the house: taking orders. answering phones, cleaning off tables, refilling drinks and taking orders to the tables. And the service was horrendous. I waited at least five minutes before she took my drink order, and another ten minutes for her to take my food order. If you wanted a refill, you literally had to flag her down and tell her.

Second: The food was mediocre. I'd choose Panda Express over this place. The food was bland, the rice was crunchy and so was the \"egg flower\" soup. I also ordered the Crab Rangoon, which were basically just filled with cream cheese, no crab taste whatsoever. They were still cold, fresh out of the fryer, and came with no dipping sauce.

Third: This place is a health department nightmare! The kitchen staff wasn't wearing anything to be sanitary. No hairnets or aprons. I have no clue if they were sanitary when it came to handling raw food. Two out of the three glasses at my table were filthy. The first glass had food particles floating at the top. The second was dirty around the rim. The glass I was drinking out of was \"clean\" but the outside of the glass felt gritty, and glassware isn't supposed to feel like that. I noticed the waitress cleaning off one table. She used water from a used glass to wipe the table down. After a man had been drinking from it during his meal. She pours a little bit of water out onto the table and proceeds to wipe up whatever mess was on it. After seeing that, I lost my appetite.

Fourth: There were no free refills. From a place charging nearly $3.00 for a soft drink, I'd like to see free refills, but this place charged $.75 per refill. But you could buy soda from a 24 oz. bottle, which costs $2. I noticed on the drive home that the soda bottle I purchased was expired almost three months ago.

All in all, this place was disgusting! The service was terrible, the food was terrible and the cleanliness of the place (or lack there of) was horrendous. I would never go back here. And avoid the lunch rush, because this is when it happened to me and I don't want anyone getting sick of this joints lack of cleanliness."}
{"text":"Yay!

I finally found a great Chinese food place near me. (I had to move to find one though). I ordered pork wonton soup, egg rolls, two chicken dishes and a beef dish and it was all NOM city baby!

The sweet and sour chicken was fresh. The chicken was encapsulated in a fried golden brown dough that tasted sooo good. The sauce was the right consistency and the vegetables were a plenty and cooked to perfection. The General chicken and beef and broccoli dishes were just as nice.

I ordered take out and had pups in the car. The sweet woman at the counter said she would deliver my order to my car so my doggies weren't alone. AWWWWWW (It's the little things)!

This place is a full restaurant with lots of comfortable booth and table seating options. The service is great and the food is whipped up and served quickly.

Go check it out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A small, low-key Asian restaurant- perfect for orange chicken (that actually tastes like oranges) and spring roll cravings.  I especially love their won ton soup... I could eat an entire bowl as my meal!  The soup is just absolute perfection with crunchy veggies, green onion and pork dumplings.  Lunch specials here are a crazy good deal at less than $7 (soup, spring roll, pork fried rice and choice of entree).  Dinner is also a great deal at around $12 and it comes with an abundance of food (soup, spring roll, bbq pork rib, fried shrimp, pork fried rice and choice of entree).  I seriously don't think you can beat it.  Service is okay.  They're set to feed you, not make small talk and be super friendly, but I don't really mind.  They also offer to go orders, so you can always call ahead and eat the delicious food at home!"}
{"text":"This is cheap Chinese food at it's finest!

I've come here several times for the lunch special which is reasonably priced and you get your choice of soup (sweet and sour is good!) and entree which also comes with rice and a yummy egg roll. There's nothing too fancy about this place but it hits the spot when I want to eat some cheap eats. The service is pretty quick and although they aren't overly friendly, they aren't rude either. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"I live in Henderson and drive here once a week.  Do not come here if you like fancy chinese food - this is for those who want a quick, well-prepared and inexpensive chinese dinner from friendly staff.  Small unassuming place lacks a lot of energy but the food is just terrific.   Never had a bad meal there and I've eaten almost everything on the menu at one point or another.  Very unassuming and unpretentious, just good eats."}
{"text":"Great food and service. If you want some great tasting food this is the place to go. The fried rice is like no other place, full of flavor. The Generals chicken is lightly battered with good pieces of chicken. I have never had a bad meal from here from the first time. I am so happy i happened to find Lotus Garden Cuisine. I will be going back for as long as they are open."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in Las Vegas. And you cant beat the price. I especially love the Lemon Chicken!"}
{"text":"MuShuPork=Salty
Orange Chicken=Just not good. 
That's what I tried and did not like. 
Service was good and prices were fair. 
But I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food is good and cheap, if your on a budget this is a great place away from the strip. 

Came here since I went to a similar restaurant on Rainbow Blvd. saw this place and decided to give it a try. 

It's not bad at all to be honest. They give you some chip like noodle and sauce. The waitress is really fast to get you your drinks and food is given fast as well. 

I got the general tzo chicken or just the general chicken on their menu. Almost like orange chicken but a little more spicy and less sweet. Came out really crunchy."}
{"text":"Me and my cousin decided to explore more chinese restaurants in the Las Vegas valley. We tried the Lotus Garden Cuisine. The food was alright. One of the dish we ordered was Salt and Pepper Pork Chop. It was ok, but it needs more seasoning. We also ordered the Walnut Shrimp with mayonnaise. It tasted good. The service here was ok. When we dine in, there was only one server but she was good. I guess there was only one chef in the back since we waited a long time to get our food."}
{"text":"Really good food, the pepper beef is amazing and the Egg Rolls are always on point, the waitress may seem like she hates you but I've been there enough times to were she knows me but still, same face, and sense of urgency. still love this place and will continue to go."}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese place close to my residential area. The server lady (possibly owner) was very nice and welcoming and accommodated myself and my family miraculously. Not giving it a 5 star rating because the little wonton chip like appetizers that were brought out were very stale. Other than that, food was great (pics to follow). The chow fun and fried rice were excellent as well as the Mongolian beef! Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Love this place. Happy we finally found a good chinese restaurant without having to drive across town. Everything we've ordered has been really good."}
{"text":"Good food with big portions! I ordered from the lunch special menu, Several items to choose from & comes with an egg roll & soup! Service was good, I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Also been coming here since the east side location. Has always been great food and the best service ever! These two are like family and you will love the food and quality."}
{"text":"Quick, decent chinese food. Love the Walnut shrimp and Crab rangoon!"}
{"text":"The lunch special prices and selections are some of the best I've seen. This is what you receive for under $10.00:

- Your choice of entree that comes with fried rice
- Your choice of soup (egg drop or wonton) or house salad
- And an egg roll

I went for the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce -- without fried rice on the side -- and egg drop soup. Not enough \"egg drop\" in my soup, and my entree was lacking in the taste department. The sauce was on the gelatinous side, and I didn't care for the bits of beef scattered throughout. Furthermore, the vegetables tasted like they were fresh from the freezer. As for the egg roll, there's nothing exciting about it, but it is packed with veggies and rice noodles. 

The service is quick; my co-worker and I received our food in under 10 minutes. I should also add that the employees here are resourceful. My co-worker wanted to take her Thai iced tea to go and asked if she could get a to go cup. The server returned with a small food container with a hole poked through the lid for the straw -- Hey, it worked!

Lotus Garden Cuisine may not be the best Chinese food I've had, but it sure beats going to a place like Panda Express."}
{"text":"I never actually stepped foot in this place. A co worker of mine was going there for lunch and really enjoys the egg drop soup. Since there was no menu to look at online he pulled a hot pink folded menu and told me to look through it before I ordered. The menu was pretty straightforward. Exactly what I'm used to when ordering at a Chinese restaurant. Sections divided by beef, pork, shrimp, chicken etc. On the back are their lunch specials. $7.25 and can choose one out of about 12 entrees with an egg roll, soup or salad, and fried rice included. 

I decided to go with the Mo Goo Chicken. Described to me as chicken vegetables water chestnuts in a stew sauce. So when my co worker came back with my meal (I WAS STARVING btw) I was excited to dig in until I opened my box. The Chicken was literally swimming I a gelatinous sauce with steamed vegetables in it. It was hot and there was not much flavor. I didn't see a sprinkle of pepper on there and the chicken although cooked all the way was as white as snow. Literally I poked my fork at it in and it jiggled. (Gross) the fried rice was so tough and chewy. The only part I ate of the entire box was the egg roll. Bland but hot and I was desperate so oh well. I most likely....actually I'm going to say it now. The food was disgusting, could've went to Panda. Never going back again."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food great orange and great rice too And great customer service"}
{"text":"This place is amazing no place can get the salt and pepper pork chops right for me. It's always clean and quite and they give you the little chip thingy with sauce as appetizer. What else could a man ask for other then chicken wings lol."}
{"text":"Close to my house - food is just ok.  Hot and sour Soup was thick and snotty . Rice seemed stale or old and reheated . With so many Chinese /Thai places in the neighborhood I don't think we will be back . Only good thing is they offer a lunch menu everyday of the week until 3pm / $6.50"}
{"text":"Stopped by again for lunch, the food is always fresh and good quality. They also have a great selection on the menu. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I have been wanting Chinese food since I moved here to Vegas haven't been able to find anyone that knows of a good place until my sister took me here and it is the best Chinese food I think I have ever eaten. The honey walnut shrimp is a must as well as the combination fried rice. The egg rolls, egg flour soup, crab rangoons were awesome.  We had the mongolian beef was great too!! Service was fast and very good! It is a small place and should be bigger because the food is so amazing!! Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"Every year our hiking group stops for lunch to celebrate Chinese New Year.  This year, we stopped at Lotus Garden as recommended by one of our group who has been going here for years.

They have a large number of $7.25 lunch specials which include fried rice, an egg roll, and soup or salad.  I ordered the pork with hot garlic sauce and hot and sour soup.  The soup was boiling hot and was standard hot and sour soup.  The pork with hot garlic sauce was listed on the menu as spicy--one red pepper.  It didn't need any spice symbol because it wasn't spicy but it was good.

Our hiking buddy ordered some crab Rangoon for the group and that was the best crab Rangoon I've had.  There wasn't a crab flavor but there was more cream cheese in the fried noodle than I've gotten in the past in other restaurants.

The restaurant is on the small side but our group sat at one of their round tables.  Service was very good.  It's straight Cantonese food.  I want to go back in the evening and try something else."}
{"text":"I truly do not like giving bad reviews because the people were really nice and the service was lovely but I literally threw my food out. I have never done that before. I hated my shrimp and snow peas with fried rice. No flavor. Sorry. Going back to my original spot."}
{"text":"This was our first time and it was delish! I've been on the hunt for a good Chinese place and after many disappointments I'm happy I found this place! 

I ordered the chicken w snow peas which was fresh and full of crisp snow peas. I also ordered Mongolian beef which had an amazing sauce w the perfect amount of heat! It had fresh veggies and lots of sweet onions. I also got the house special wonton soup which was really good. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the egg roles... They were mediocre. 

I got all this plus a large white rice for $35! Needless to say I found a new local favorite!"}
{"text":"My parents and cousin always seem to find their way to this restaurant. They love the beef or chicken soft noodle chow mein. Been here a few times & it's just like any other authentic Chinese restaurant. They have lunch specials M-F that range from $6-8 that come with ur choice of entree with fried rice, spring rolls & soup. Love their salt & pepper pork chop or pork chop in Peking sauce. They offer large servings."}
{"text":"This is our go to Lunch spot. I rotate between the Won Ton Soup bowl and the Shrimp with Snow Peas, both of which I name best in show. The service is fast and friendly, and the atmosphere is cozy, reminding me of the Chinese restaurants  I visited as a child."}
{"text":"Usually, Chinese food tastes unhealthy but tasty and flavorful. Lotus tasted both unhealthy and bland. Archi's was closed, so my boyfriend and I ended up going to their neighbors at Lotus, where we ordered the lunch special chicken chow mein and lemon chicken. The chow mein seemed canned, with tough chicken and little noodles. The only flavor seemed to be salt. The lemon chicken was also disappointing. The cutlets were extremely tough and dry. Fried rice that came with our meals was somehow flavorless too. Hot sauce did little to enhance the flavor. 
The good thing about Lotus was that the service was quick."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food, especially the roast pork Egg Foo Young...wonton soup is very good and flavorful...prices very reasonable..."}
{"text":"Met some girlfriends and just loved this place. Everything was so fresh and the Sweet and Sour Chicken was fabulous. Our waitress was great, attentive and friendly. Plenty of parking and we visited for 2 hours and all the while our waitress kept checking on us! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been stopping in the last week or so for lunch, and have only had the large bowl of war won-ton soup both times,  but it is very good. The service is top notch, the place is immaculately clean, and the prices are what you would expect. The only even slight complaint I have is that they do not have fountain soda, but rather plastic bottles of soda instead. But I really like this place."}
{"text":"A decent place for Chinese food. Some authentic items and some americanized stuff like Chop Suey.The place is located in a strip mall/office complex and is modestly decorated with Chinese art  and paintings. In my group we had the Mu Shu pork, Salt & Pepper Pork chops, Lemon Chicken, BBQ Pork Lo Mein, and Kung Pao Chicken. Everything was served in a timely manner and the service was good even with only one waitress for the whole place."}
{"text":"The neat thing about hiking adventures is that it is usually followed by a dining adventure. This past Sunday afternoon following Norm K's Freeway and Donkey Wash Trails Hike UYE, I tried Lotus Garden Cuisine. 

  Lotus Garden Cuisine is in the shopping center at the northwest corner of Rainbow and Sunset Roads immediately north of  the 215 Freeway Rainbow Road exit. Due to its proximity to three major roads, it is in easy reach to motorists commuting across the valley. This is a Chinese restaurant that many people could enjoy. One of the many is yours truly who will share his positive experience dining here. 

   From my experience dining in Chinese restaurants there are two types of dining environments. One is the take out style restaurant with tables and the other is the cozy restaurant with a server. Lotus Garden Cuisine is the later. 

  I made it in time for the lunch special. In my opinion, the Chinese Restaurant lunch special is one of the best deals around. For the price of a fast food restaurant, the lunch special gives a lot for the money. As soon as I set eyes on their lunch menu, I was impressed. They offer over and above what many of the Las Vegas Chinese restaurants do. When it comes to the lunch special, many of the Chinese restaurants serve either egg drop or hot and sour soup calling them soup of the day. However, Lotus Garden Cuisine offers hot and sour soup, egg flower soup, wonton soup or house salad with house dressing. I have yet to see a Chinese restaurant offer house salad with house dressing as a lunch special choice. The lunch special menu gets even better. Hitherto now, every Chinese restaurant lunch special charges additional for shrimp-based entrees. At Lotus Garden Cuisine a Mongolian Beef entree and shrimp with lobster sauce lunch special is $6.75. All 22 lunch special entrees cost $6.75. They include soup or salad, egg roll, and fried rice. Plus, before the meal, they give you crunchy skinny noodles with duck sauce. I was starting to enjoy this dining adventure. 

    I complimented all this food with hot tea. I'd pour the tea from a tea pot into a small cup. The advantageous thing about hot tea besides the taste is that it gives me a break from the high sugary soft drinks that customarily  compliment my dining adventures. 

    The food was served over the Chinese Zodiac place menu. Looking at the place mat, I had a revelation about myself, \"Being born in 1972 makes me a rat.\" But a good rat that is ambitious and sincere. Kind of like this review. Anyways the food served on the place mat was on regular china with silverware. This isn't China Go Go or one of those places where the food is in styrofoam boxes with plastic forks. There was a quality presentation to the food. And ultimately a quality taste. 

    From the wonton soup which included broccoli to the shrimp chop suey, this was delectable Chinese food. There was sufficient shrimp interspersed with the vegetables, sauce, and onions that made up the shrimp chop suey. The egg roll was bigger than a Twinkle. The fried rice had a nice texture. 

   I had zero complaints about the service. The waitress would check up on me and never rushed me. Plus, she never charged me for the hot tea. 

  The lunch adventure concluded with the check and fortune cookie. All this delicious food that I shared with you and hot tea in a cozy atmosphere came out to $7.30 before the tip. That is less money than Panda Express and even some of the food at McDonald's. My fortune would read \"Keep your plans secret for now.\" Now is over, and I can let everyone in on my plan that I am spreading the word that there is a really good Chinese restaurant called Lotus Garden Cuisine that is a hop and a skip from the 215 Freeway off the Rainbow Road exit."}
{"text":"Love this place, been coming here for almost 3 years now. the food is good and you cant beat the lunch special. I would like a little bigger portions though."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant since I was in middle school in the late 90's when it was located on the east side of town and I was shocked to find it was still ran by the same owner, cook, and waitress from back then! Food was still bomb af and it brought me back to my childhood. Not to mention they all remembered who we were and what booth we used to sit in."}
{"text":"Reliably good food. Simple restaurant in a strip center, on the small side, but always worth coming to.

Although tonight I ate supper here (craving good veggies), I usually come here for lunch. They have family-style specials that are fun to share with co-workers and friends. Soups always satisfy, and sauces make their dishes pleasing.

It's all fresh and MSG free, so no post-meal headache. With good balance of veggies and proteins, feel like I come away happy and healthy."}
{"text":"Truly decent little Chinese place. Small, but service was decent. Food served still sizzling, and the best part was that the almond chicken was NOT breaded! BBQ pork made fresh, not the cold, sliced, & dyed stuff you get at most places. Had to ask twice for extra sesame seeds, though. War won ton was a bit salty, but I'll be back to try a full bowl. Only got the cup, but it was chock full of goodies."}
{"text":"Decent lunch special.  Quantity looked small but it was way more than enough for a lunch meal.  They also gave wonton soup which is unusual for lunch specials and these were pretty decent wontons.  Tasted handmade and not mass produced.  Gave it an extra star for that. The atmosphere and service were good too.  I only dinged it one star because my beef green beans was a little salty.  its really suspect whenever i am served salty meat because restaurants do that to either mask old meat or make bad cuts more tender.  This is usually because the business isnt enough and stuff gets old.  More restaurant style panda express with more menu variety.  The dishes is also made fresh instead of under hotplates and mass cooked."}
{"text":"Go somewhere else, there are many other places I'd rather eat than this place.  The utensils are old and dirty and the egg flower soup tasted like some sort of bleach, had to to send it back.

Save your money and time!"}
{"text":"Poor quality food, not impressed. Sesame chicken overcooked, egg rolls okay, rangoons good, barbecue chicken overcooked, steak on a stick too chewy, chefs special just okay. Will not be returning sadly. Service was poor. Clean I guess but below average food."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The woman who runs it is wonderful and friendly and always allows me to order something not available on the lunch menu since I am a returning customer.  They have the best General's chicken that I have ever had.  It is all white meat and deliciously spiced."}
{"text":"Been going here for almost 15 years now so I thought It was time to give it a shout out.  It is a typical American style Chinese food.  Portions are good and so are the prices.  I can honestly say I have never had anything I wouldn't order again.  It is our go to when too lazy to cook and need a delivery or a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I am trying their Singapore noodles for the first time I will let you know how it is after I have dinner thank you so much."}
{"text":"Ate at this Chinese restaurant a couple times now...Unfortunately the food still does not come close to many other Chinese Restaurants back home. The quality of the food is okay, but decent nonetheless. I still have yet to find a Chinese Restaurant here in LV that tastes more authentic. Staff here are friendly! 

Side note: The last time I was here, we had to ask for another fork because the utensil that was given to my friend had not been washed well."}
{"text":"The food wasn't very good. The service was average at best. I would not recommend going here."}
{"text":"Very good, never too crowded,  fresh ingredients,  fast friendly service.  My favorite is the aromatic shrimp so good! Very good egg rolls sometime I get those alone."}
{"text":"Horrible! I won't be back. I was unable to consume the thick starch pudding like sauce the almond shrimp was swimming in. I asked my waiter to take my plate away after one or two bites. She hollered back at me as she is walking away. \"I charge you half\". I never asked for a discount however once she snarled at me I replied once she returned to the table. I didn't eat half, I took one bite and the taste and smell has made me nauseous. No apology, just an attitude, wow.  

She said ok, returned to the table to throw the check at us. I have no idea why she was so belligerent towards us? I was super sweet, nice and discreet. She was in the kitchen yelling loud in her native language, it made us uncomfortable. We soon left after my Mom finished her plate which was not good however tolerable at least."}
{"text":"We have been looking for good Chinese food since moving to Vegas years ago and I think we finally found it.  We placed a large order over the phone and it was ready for pickup about 20 minutes later.  Everything that we tried was very good.  The honey walnut shrimp really stood out ad did the Aromatic shrimp.  Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place been coming here for years good food never had a bad meal reasonable prices especially lunch hour me and my family love it! 
Great customer service forever a customer"}
