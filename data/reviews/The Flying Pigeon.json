{"text":"Delicious gourmet food! We held a community event and invited The Flying Pigeon. They were so professional and everyone raved about the food. The prices are more than reasonable. Find this truck and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Second time eating at the Flying Pigeon food truck. Managed to get in before the line.  So yummy and friendly service.  Clearly a passion for these people!  I have the culture shock and it was everything!"}
{"text":"Only 2 reviews? 

That shit is going to change. 
Gunna change Rrrrreal fuckin' quick. 

Cos Duck Dumplings, are you fucking with me right now? Whos your informant? Who squealed?! How did you know about my food problems? Why do you play with my emotions like that? 

Â¡Baby, why are you so mean!?

-Cough- 

anywho. 

They're a keeper. Place is the bomb like: Tick-tick...boom! Totally inspired food. Yuge portions. 

We'll be back until we've had everything on your menu. 

I'd already filled up before I found these guys but they understood, took pity on my pain & worked up a half portion for me. 

And it was worth more then I deserved. 

These guys are Bangerang!"}
{"text":"So. Freaking. Good! Cannot believe this food came from a food truck! 
Today we ordered 7 different menu items & loved them all. One person is an  authentic Korean & he thought they did the best kimchi he'd had in Phoenix! 

The Tator tot nachos were def a fave...& people actually drove back to the farmers market to get more. 

You must try this!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  I had the opportunity to sample 4 different dishes from The Flying Pigeon today. Every single one of them were delicious!  The flavors are on point, the ingredients taste incredibly fresh, and the folks who work here are very nice. I'm a picky eater and typically don't give \"5 stars\" unless they are well-deserved. I can't say enough positive things so do yourself a favor and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Hard to believe the food comes from a truck, this is unequivocally the best truck in the city. Other trucks charge the same prices for a fraction of the quality. I've had:

Roast duck: quite extraordinary. Crispy, layered ingredients create very satisfying and complex flavor (like most of their stuff)

Ramen: doesn't blow your mind but better than any noodle I've had from a truck

Bruce Lee bowl: maybe my least favorite item so far, but still tasty on the top

Cod/pork sandwich: a novel combo I never considered, very yummy, probably better to share for 2 people

Porkapocalypse: sandwich with pork belly / eggplant, etc. Like a gourmet meatball sandwich

Tator tot nachos: as good as they sound"}
