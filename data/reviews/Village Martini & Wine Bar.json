{"text":"From the outside, this restaurant is unassuming, and my guess is that if you didn't know it existed, you would drive on by. But that would be a huge mistake. Everything my husband and I ordered was saliva-inducing delicious. The crab cakes were divine--not too \"fishy\" and accompanied with a fresh red pepper coulis and cold corn salsa. I ordered the Ohio Berkshire Pork Chop, which was wonderfully moist and featured a maple sauce--the perfect combination of salty and sweet. My husband chose the Pittsburgh Steak and loved it, a bit surprising as he typically likes everything plain, plain, plain, and this piece of meat is rubbed with spices and served with hot peppers, olives, tomatoes and a red sauce. The steak was grilled to a precise medium rare, just as he ordered it.

The service is just a tad slow, unless you're a regular. The waitstaff obviously had their favorites, but, still, we didn't feel slighted. Expect to pay $18-20/per entree unless you plan on just ordering a sandwich. I would recommend reservations, especially if you have a large party; we were able to get a seat right away, but we arrived just as they opened at 5 p.m. on a Saturday. The restaurant is small, and it filled up quickly. This is a great spot for a romantic date or a family dinner."}
{"text":"Apparently I have struck a nerve with someone as he has called me an idiot. I did not realize that if I left MY opinion in MY food for that day someone named Jeff would stoop to such a level. I have now shown this post to my friends. Well Jeff none of them will be at your establishment anytime soon. I really hope you do not run your business this way."}
{"text":"The Wellington was AMAZING!! The goat cheese ravioli was delicious and the shrimp cocktail was huge and definitely two thumbs up. The cheese and meat board however was not worth the money though."}
{"text":"The bartenders are great. Very personable, mix great drinks and know how to pair a drink with a meal. The food is top notch for the price and the area. They have an indoor and outdoor seating area, both with great atmosphere. A great happy hour. The only issue is you wouldn't know it existed if you didn't look it up. Long and short, been there many times, never had a bad meal or bad service. Well worth checking out and far better than some of the other bar/restaurants on the same road within walking distance."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Busy but not so loud you cannot talk with your friends.  Great draft beer and mixed drink menu. A very interesting food menu as well.  Everything we had was fresh and well done.   Probably one of the best kept secrets in Chagrin Falls.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was bad, food was average, and totally kid UNfriendly! I don't recommend. So many other great restaurants in Chagrin Falls...we won't go to this place again!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner and drinks with some friends. Parking was crowded, in a shared business lot. Nice atmosphere. Menu had many different things to offer from salads, steaks and pasta dishes. Service was good. Our server made wine recommendations and even brought over a sample of what was recommended. Food came out fast and was hot. We didn't have dessert but saw another table eating something chocolatey and it looked as good as our meals were. Prices were moderate. Bathroom was located in hallway and was cold and dirty, it is shared with other businesses in the building. I would go back. Overall experience was good!"}
{"text":"The low rating is not for food, but service and attitude.  Four of us went there on a Monday evening.  The food was good, we each enjoyed what we ordered.  But the service was very slow, and there were not even that many customers there.  We were seated at the booth on the far end of the restaurant.  Also, mistakes were made on our credit cards.  When I went back (twice) to try to get the credit card charge corrected, I was encouraged to just dispute the charge on my card.  No offer of help, even with attitude.  I prefer to take my business someplace else."}
{"text":"Was in with my family over the weekend on saturday.  Food was excellent.  Service was pretty good, but was very very busy.  We had a tall, very skinny waitress, she had a bit of an attitude and seemed annoyed.   My husband kept referring to her as \"twiggy\".   only thing would recommend, is a different server.  The african american server who checked on us was very nice.  Would like to have him next time. Other than that, everything was great!"}
{"text":"Great place. Love that they are vegan-friendly and have an entire vegan menu. I would suggest they place it on the tables like normal so you don't have to ask for it though. The happy hour drinks are great prices (& half price apps). The drinks are delicious and the food is amazing quality. Their vegan pizza is incredible. Have had friendly staff too. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We have been here twice for drinks and dinner, made reservations on open table, they seem a little confused when checking in, but when you finally get to your table the staff in quick to wait on you with great service and food, I would highly recommend this restaurant, there food was great and the drinks where made perfect!"}
{"text":"So disappointed in the service here. When we walked in, we felt like we were inconveniencing the server. He practically threw the menus on the table and barely spoke to us. Basic services were ignored so we had to go to the bartender, who was awesome! The food and drinks were great! The server was just so rude, that it was hard to get over."}
{"text":"Service was great and we were able to sit by the fire.   Food was good, especially the creme brulee."}
{"text":"Village Martini and Wine Bar is definitely a hidden gem in Chagrin Falls. While the service is slow and the food is pricey, it's a great place for a romantic date or Saturday night dinner. My boyfriend and I both ordered the stuffed peppers for an appetizer (spicy yet delicious) and the baseball filet (so tasty and filling)!"}
{"text":"This is another tucked in place in Chagrin. They have a nice bar and a menu that is very vegetarian friendly. The service was prompt and lunch was fabulous. I ordered a vegetarian pita and I was impressed. They also have quite a large wine selection. I have gone there in the summer and they have a nice patio for outside dining. It's a nice alternative to the Chagrin Falls Main St. Restaurants."}
{"text":"First time there.  Outside seating.  The tables are far apart and not cramped in toghether.  You can actually hear a conversation.  So that is good! They need to figure out some lighting program for after dark, other than people using their iphones to read menus/bills with!  And a table light.  Hey, how about candles, or spot lights.... The food was ok.  Hubby loved his, I thought mine was too spicy.  The biggest reason we won't be back is the slow SLOW service.  Prices were inline with Chagrin."}
{"text":"My husband and I went last week for our anniversary.  We booked on Open Table.  It can be hard to find the entrance but I'd read other reviews before going so I knew where to look.  It is VERY dark in there.  Small candles on the tables or a few more lights would be helpful since things are dark colored in the restaurant.  They appeared to have a nice patio but we dined inside.  My husband started with the duck wings and I got the crab cakes.  He LOVED the duck wings.  The liver & onions were recommended to us because they sell out every weekend so my husband got it and he said, \"it is the second best thing I've ever put in my mouth\".  I had the short ribs wellington which was nicely done.  We certainly hope to return!"}
{"text":"great place a real find.  cozy comfortable and GREAT food and food choices"}
{"text":"Quickly becoming my favorite spot in the falls, until my recent experience.  I was raving about the chili (black bean on the vegan menu) & encouraged my bae to join me on a night out - my treat.  Turns out in the end he had to handle to tip. I'm usually the overtipper, but was so turned off.  The food came out all right and the male host were nice (as always), however our server had the most ridiculous attitude. It genuinely felt she was mad at me and only our table, because she had no problem chatting with the table behind us, laughing with them, refilling their drinks. I waited about 20 minutes for a water refill.  I wanted another glass of wine but we both finished our meals by the time she came back. Which wasn't correct, but we never got her attention to tell her until we were done.  When I asked her about desserts she wouldn't even tell me about them because I mentioned I'm lactose intolerant/dairy-free, but I will splurge on sweets!! Anyways, I give this a three because my past experiences were great but I'll dine with another server in the future."}
{"text":"The Village Martini and Wine Bar in Chagrin Falls is a cozy and quaint little bar/restaurant that is tucked back a bit from East Washington Street. I like to call it \"Chagrin Fall's best kept secret.\" Upon entering the building complex in which the martini bar is in, you get transformed into pure ecstasy with the aromas of tea tree and other essential oils from another office that occupies the same building down the hallway. Managers Adam and Amber are AWESOME! Here is a place you will ALWAYS get good fresh made to your liking food, great service, and wonderful atmosphere. Cute little fireplace inside and a beautiful patio outside. Dark, quaint and quiet bar with two televisions. Their seasonal in-house infused vodkas are a must try!! Best happy hour around!!!! My #1 Favorite place!!!!"}
{"text":"Usually have appetizers and drinks.  Service is good.  Yellowfin is fabulous.  Mango scallops and proscuitto are also great.  Good wine list.  Outdoor seating is comfortable."}
{"text":"Seriously damn good Martinis, fantastic menu and great music too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate dinner at the Village Martini and Wine Bar on August 25, 2015.  We had a wonderful time!  The atmosphere is quiet and refined.  There are outside tables but it was cool so we ate inside.  We started out with Martinis (naturally).  We chose to eat \"Tapas\" style ordering several items off the appetizer menu so we could all try multiple items.  This worked out really well!  We had a total of 6 appetizers for the 4 of us.  Our favorites were the duck wings and the Yellowfin Tuna.  Fantastic.  The Calamari was also great with a nice spicy sauce.  The scallops were good as were the spring rolls although they were more like egg rolls.  The Crab cakes didn't quite match up with the other items...

The service was great!

So, overall, for a quiet, upscale dinner with for the most part excellent food, we recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"We waited over an hour for the food to come after we ordered .  The waiter was not very apologetic or very attentive.  Our wait clouded our whole experience so it was hard to enjoy the food when it finally came."}
{"text":"To start the waiter was curt and not friendly.on saturday night they were out of. 
 veal dish and no desserts except pudding. At 630pm. The place was busy how can that happen. I find both kinda bizzarre.no bread or salad comes with dinner
The calamari was nicely done. The server were dressed terrible..one had old jeans that were ragged. Another wearinf a hunting coat .server never asked if we wanted coffee just layed our check on table and left"}
{"text":"The Bulleit Rye Manhattan is a good starter. Trust the staff from there."}
{"text":"One Star is being far too generous. The WORST!!! Do not waste your money on this restaurant establishment.  

My friend and I had a Filet Mignon. The  steak  knife they gave me would not cut soft butter.  When I asked for another one, The manager gave me tremendous attitude and told me they are all alike and then proceeded to come by with a basket full of steak knives and drop them next to me at the table and told me to pick one with a belligerent attitude. 
I told him I have never been treated so poorly in a very nice restaurant. He did not seem to care one bit, as a matter of fact, he became more aggressive throwing the check in the billfold on the table.  Then to add insult to injury the waitress came by to check on our table, when I expressed to her my complaint he became verbally abusive to me. 


The owner of this restaurant needs to get his shit together with this poor representation of what he calls management is unacceptable. 

I would not treat a dog the way this man treated me.  He needs to be fired and sent to  a Third World country where he cannot have interaction with anybody as he clearly has no people skills!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is low stars for the efficiency and the service not the food. We made a reservation on open table and it appeared that they don't monitor that or have a hostess/check in station at all so we just waited for someone to stop and talk to us. The wait to get water and even drinks should have been a warning sign. It took a while and to get the appetizer as well. The meal continued wth difficulties such as forgotten water refills, ketchup delivered after the meals were already eaten, half the table done eating while others waited for their food to arrive. My mom didn't get salad dressing until after everyone was finished so we just sat there and watched her eating before we could leave. Not very apologetic and no effort to reconcile the difficulties. For higher prices and upscale neighborhood it wasn't worth it and we probably won't be back for a while. 

Good stuff--Food items themselves were very very good. Nice menu selection, expected prices for Chagrin Falls, cute atmosphere. My grilled romaine salad was inventive and flavorful. The chicken was cooked perfectly. I was envious of the baseball filet, it was a nice cut and good portion."}
{"text":"Ambiance is great for a date night. Drinks are fabulous. Staff have been so attentive to our needs; we had 4 people check on us the first 10 minutes. Great patio outside and the inside is beautiful. They also have cigars! I loved the chocolate and the espresso martinis."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! They have an awesome vegan menu. The seared tofu is absolutely the best. The service was excellent, and I love the manager, who's always really nice and accommodating. I took my dad there for Father's Day, and both my parents enjoyed it.  This is a must try for all foodies, especially vegan ones."}
{"text":"The pizzas are fantastic. Lance at the bar is fantastic. Pretty great martinis, but I'm no snooty aficionado. This is a classy joint."}
{"text":"Happy hour is great! Cozy atmosphere and the owners Adam and Amanda are AWESOME! Great service ALL the time!!!! Fresh food made to order. Drinks are fab!!!! Good time, good friends, good service and good food all around! A quiet little place that nobody knows of. Sits back from the road in a little plaza. Has been here for three years. All our friends that we brought here never knew it was here. They wanna come back adapt!"}
{"text":"Loved finding this place while visiting Solon for work! Great drink selection & reasonable portion size all for a great price. The food was delicious and my dinner companion loved his meal, Pad Thai with chicken! Very unassuming as it's tucked away in a small indoor shopping plaza. Loved the hospitality also."}
{"text":"Good good. Poor service. Dirty surfaces (tables, chairs, floors, menus, etc..Wait staff dressed in old, dirty t-shirts. Weird location. Outdated decore. Tried this place three times hoping things would improve (I always support local venues first) Sadly, they didn't. Owner responded to my honest review by insulting me and dropping the F bomb. Classy guy.  Seems he should focus more on improving his restaurant rather than chasing away customers."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the cozy feel and food on a blustery cold night.  Excellent Martini as well.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different in the chagrin falls area! Thanks to yelp.....Great little place! Great food! Great service! I had the chicken piccata which was amazing! Hubby had the chicken salad which he enjoyed as well."}
{"text":"I would probably give 3 stars for the food, but I'm bumping it up 1 star because they have a large vegan menu, and a nice atmosphere.  They also have a decent cocktails along with a good beer selection.  Went here for dinner last night with the husband and sister and while the husband is far from vegan, he ordered off of the vegan menu because it sounded better than the regular menu.  We started off with tempeh fritters and the stuffed hungarian peppers.  Both were very tasty, however the fritters weren't fritters, just strips of tempeh. Still, they tasted good.  The stuffed hungarian pepper was very good and had a nice heat to it.  For dinner, the husband ordered the chickpea meatballs with pasta and we all thought that it was very good.  The sister had the tempeh lasagna which was really just tempeh, spinach and pasta sauce.  It tasted good, but needed salt and maybe another texture (a noodle would help).  I ordered the tempeh noodles which were a bit too sweet, but good nonetheless.  My main complaint is that they rely a bit too much on tempeh and maybe they should try another type of vegetarian protein.  Still, it is really nice to have a well thought out vegan menu in Chagrin Falls.  Of note, they are a sister restaurant to Clifton wine and martini bar near Lakewood."}
{"text":"I love to hate this restaurant. The food is absolutely amazing. Had he pork chop first time; wife had scallops. Both were tremendous. Second time we had some appetizers which were equally good. For being a martini bar they make sub-par cocktails. Service is absolutely abysmal. People are nice enough but just not attentive at all. From my professional experience I'd blame management not holding folks accountable and setting a good example."}
{"text":"Wow! Went here last weekend at the suggestion of a friend. She ordered a chocolate martini while I had one of the seasonal drinks that I just can't recall the name of!! It had strawberry puree, cucumber vodka, and was so refreshing. Both drinks were delicious, in fact. I've heard many good things about their pomegranate martini as well, so that's next on my list to try."}
{"text":"Yes, five stars. We made reservations for Saturday night around noon same day. This is not our first visit and we are always pleased. Today i sampled two really special Village cocktails; the Village  Manhattan, made with in house infused bourbon with roasted peanuts and bitter chocolate. This is a real Manhattan - not sweet like it sounds - just SPECIAL. The second, the Greek martini. Awesome, peperoncini juice, clam juice, and Tabasco added,  a real taste explosion.
The nights special was scarlet snapper, a new fish for me, it was awesome!!!!
Best specialty cocktail prices around and the special was under twenty!"}
{"text":"After it took us a while to actually find the restaurant, we chose a great little table outside on the patio. The patio is brick with a white fence and bushes hiding the diners from the street which makes it very personal. The tables are old school cast iron and have umbrellas at each table. Inside there is a good size bar, a few booths, and a good amount of tables, but it's not a big restaurant at all. 

We came right after I got out of work so we got there about 5:30. We were the youngest there by at least 45 years, but once we got the drinks, we decided we wanted to keep this hidden gem our secret (besides announcing it on Yelp how much we enjoyed it). Even though the prices are a little higher than normal, it surprised us more weren't there that were in there 20s/30s. The happy hour menu had a ton to choose from and the list of martinis - it was hard for me to choose one, but don't worry, I did. 

My fiancé had a beer he chose off the long list of draft options then I had the Village Colada that honestly takes you to a beach feeling after the first sip. I highly recommend it. 

The food was alright, needed some salt (especially in my dish that was the vegan mushroom ravioli) but what I loved about it was the wide selection and that they had vegan and gluten free options as well. The vegan menu makes it very easy for me to find something and not worry about it having dairy but they did say that they can make accommodations to any meal - our waitress even said they can easily make a flat bread without cheese on it ( HIGHLY recommend the flatbreads by the way)

Overall, this was a great restaurant that I hope to see more people our age at, but they can count on us returning that's for sure!"}
{"text":"I went here for a happy hour with a coworker a few months ago.  The location is a bit odd because you have to go inside a building to find the entrance to the restaurant.  The customer service was just so-so, not particularly friendly.  I wonder if this is because it's a much older crowd here (at least when we were there) and we were much younger.  I think I ordered a pizza (limited vegetarian options) and it was fine, nothing memorable.  I don't think either of us ordered the namesake martinis - what a miss!  Don't plan to return to try them out."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hoopla is about this place. 

Any place that has less than 15 martinis on their menu should not advertise that theyre a martini bar. 

$9 martinis. They weren't filled to the rim and lacked garnish. 

They do have a great outside patio area for eating/drinking. 

We watched the waitress clearing tables outside tossing all the left over glasses of water towards the plants steps away from another table of prople. 

Plastic cheap menus. Hostess didnt say goodbye. 

Just not impressed."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect.  I went with my department for a work lunch and it turned out they had a completely separate began menu that was loaded with entrees - many or most of which were gluten free.  I tried the tempeh lasagna and loved it. A co-worker had the tempeh noodles and I got to try them. They were phenomenal. I went last week so I could have the tempeh noodles myself. I have a new restaurant to are to my favorites list. Everyone else also enjoyed their meals. The flavor was spectacular and the service is top notch. I cannot wait to go back or order to go from there again soon. Also, there was so much food, I had enough for another full lunch serving so the cost per serving for me was cut in half. This place is a winner!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of sassy women and we were all hangry and our server Ben handled our sass with ease.  The food selection was great and we all enjoyed our selections, they all got the goat cheese salad with chicken and I had the Tuscan flatbread.  I would recommend both.  The bomb cake however was awful.  Dry and boring, I was expecting fudge and something gooey.  I wish they had a cheaper wine selection, glasses started at 10.  I do prefer swirl in Solon for this reason, you can get a bottle for 15 if you're looking for something cheap.  But the patio was nice and the food great.  And again, big shout out to Ben!"}
{"text":"Village just keeps getting better! I love how they change their menu! Gives me a variety of new options to try every few months. As of right now the Beef Wellington Short Ribs are my favorite!!! So tender and wrapped in the most flaky delicious pastry! Ugh, to die for. Also loving the new addition to the martini list - the Himalayan. Just the right amount of sweet!"}
{"text":"Wonderful and funny/charming staff. Pair that with great food and friends, then you will have a great night out!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of girlfriends for a night out.  The bar tender was extremely rude!!  The food was average.  I will never go back.  Too many other great places with good service and great food."}
