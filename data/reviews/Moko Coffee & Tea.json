{"text":"A real mixed bag. On the one hand, the food is fresh, good, and they have healthy options that are tough to find at other places for lunch.  On the other, the prices are all about $2 too high (a salad with chicken will run you about $8.50, which is the average price for a lunch item). The staff is not very friendly, either. Even daily customers rarely receive a hello."}
{"text":"They don't sell any hot tea. No milk either. I got a decent cookie the other day, but it smelled like the grill, which was weird. Went back for another cookie today (I work upstairs and it was too cold to go out!) and they'd locked the doors ten minutes before their posted closing time. I'd be happy to give them my money instead of to Starbucks across the street, but they don't seem to want my business."}
{"text":"I work at Cleveland State and had the pleasure of discovering this little cafe.  The service is decently friendly and the coffee is less expensive than *bucks.  I ordered a non-fat vanilla latte; it was VERY tasty and smooth, which I deeply appreciate after having moved here from Seattle.  It was a little heavy on the vanilla syrup, but still very satisfying.  Moko also offers sandwiches, soups and salads, and is vegetarian friendly which I also very much appreciate.  There is a portabello and pesto sandwhich that I can't wait to try.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this place as a wonderful independent coffee shop in the heart of downtown.  Down with big chains!"}
{"text":"I am sadly addicted to their Napa Chicken Salad sandwiches. Fresh Amish gerber chicken breast with candied walnuts, grapes and a cranberry spread. Simply to die for. The turkey avocado is great too, but I recommend the multigrain bread over the Italian hoagie. Chips and a sandwich for $7 downtown? That's a steal. The place across the street charges $11 for sandwich and chips."}
{"text":"$2.50 for a small coffee.  No Wifi.  Staff basically made me feel unwanted because I only ordered coffee.  Was 11:15 and not a soul in there, but they wanted me out since lunch was coming. In a word, \"rude\".   Fact is, the food looked and smelled good but the attitude made me want to never go back."}
{"text":"I've waited several months to post a review of Moko.  I have worked in the building for over 9 months now and while I really wish this could be my go to when all else fails, it's just not.  For many reasons.  My first experiences here were with the odd hours and unfriendly staff.  I mean, it's a coffee cafe and they don't even open until 8am.  So much for getting a coffee on the way into the office.  Very inconvenient.  And then they close at 2pm which is also inconvenient if you missed getting lunch and are starving.  They have no items with protein for breakfast yet they have tasty meaty sandwiches during lunch.  Makes no sense to me.  Their soups are really good - I've tried several and that's how they are able to even earn 3 stars in my book."}
{"text":"yum yum tasty mochas.  i haven't sampled all the other drinks, but i'm a mocha girl, so i was happy.  a great blend of stronger coffee but not burnt beans like other places tend to do, mike's place makes a darn good cup o' joe.  i will be back, and after all, supporting other yelpers and their great businesses is what it's all about.  word, mike.  keep on rockin' in the bean world.  i mean, even neil young thinks so.  congrats on opening, and i will be back for more tasty caffeinated goodness, and to sample the food :)"}
{"text":"Rudest hired help I've ever met.   All I wanted was a bottle of water.   The help was miffed that they had to take off their gloves and stop what they were doing to sell me a bottle.   They finally took my money, and then just stood their looking at me.   I asked for the bottle of water, which I could see on the display case which they only had access to. The told me to get it myself out of a different cooler in the other side of the. store. No thank you. No nothing."}
{"text":"I come in here pretty often. The owner knows my usual order (Big BLT on a hoagie) if that says anything. It's decent food for an okay price. I recently tried the carrot soup and was not a fan. I think I'll stick to the BLT.  EDIT: The butternut squash soup is GREAT! And so is the Tomato bleu cheese. They are pretty good sized portions, and usually the tomato soup fills me up. The butternut squash is lighter."}
{"text":"I stop in hear a few times a month for lunch. I've never had anything bad. The sandwiches are good, the soup is really good and the salads are ok. The thing I like here the most is the bread! I'm not sure if they bake it in house or not, but it is fantastic!. The folks who work there always seem relatively unhappy, and I don't think I have ever seen the owner (at least I think she is the owner) smile. That being said I like the food."}
{"text":"If you love coffee and, in particular, espresso...then MOKO is MUST-STOP for you. Quite simply, they expertly serve the best coffee in Cleveland, hands down.   By expertly, I mean that they know their coffee & espresso. That's why they serve Intelligentsia, one of the premier coffee roasters around.  The owner, Mike, is very knowledgeable about the coffees he serves and knows how to serve such quality coffees (especially the Black Cat espresso). This place is a true coffee-lover's dream!  If, by some chance, you're not a coffee connoisseur you should still drop by and try their soups. Even if I weren't a coffee aficionado, I would give MOKO 5 stars based on their wonderful soups. In particular, my faves are the Chicken Paprikash and the Coconut Chicken Curry. Yum!  The staff couldn't be more friendly.  I'm an out-of-towner and they remember me every visit. They are courteous and intent on providing quality service to go with their quality menu items.   My only regret about MOKO is that I don't live closer to this fine cafe and must rely on business trips to Cleveland to get my fix. Of all the cafes I have frequented across the country, MOKO is most definitely in my Top Two. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place was great for sandwiches at lunch.  Sad it closed.  Don't try Otto Moser next door - does not compare."}
{"text":"Let's get one thing straight.  They have coffee,  probably Folders,  but no tea or espresso.  The food is not New American,  more like a deli.  The sandwiches are boring and don't get me started on the Mac n cheese.  It had way too much white pepper and didn't taste cheesy at all.  It's really not worth what you are paying.  The place is dirty.  Food all over the floor behind the counter and the fridges were left open and you could see food in there.   For some reason my coworkers still occasionally eat there and my boss paid the price- she had to miss a day of work because she was sick."}
{"text":"I've worked downtown for three years, and MoKo has always been an easy go-to.  The staff behind the counter are always kind and helpful.  The owner could use some tact and people skills. When it comes to food, their soups and fresh made sandwiches are really tasty.  The Italian Wedding Soup and Chicken Paprikash Soup (Tuesday only) are pretty popular and will sell out quickly. The roast beef sandwich and the chicken chipotle sandwich are really good as well.  Their peanut butter cookies used to be the best, but I have noticed that they have shrunken in size, and are well done with burnt edges. I recommend ordering soup or a fresh made sandwich.  I don't trust the salads that are in the refrigerators because due to browning of lettuce and avocados, it leads me to believe that they are left in there a tad longer than they should be in hopes that they get purchased rather than having to be thrown out.  I can't comment on the coffee since I don't drink any, but people from my office seem to enjoy it regularly."}
{"text":"This was one of those places that you find on accident, but wonder what took you so long.   I walked in at about 1:30 in the afternoon hoping for a yummy sandwich, wifi and some coffee. What I found was an itty-bitty cafe with a few regulars, a lot of smiles and everything I was looking for, plus more.   The gal at the counter was sugar sweet and very patient with all of my questions. Hey, it was my first time there, alright?! Anyways, she told me about their fresh menu and everything looked delicious. I eventually ended up going with a turkey sandwich with avocado and provolone. They were out of a few, essential things on their menu, like wheat bread. I think what the issue actually was that (and I didn't realize this when I walked in) they close at 2pm and they were out of what they were going to serve that day.   I think this place could do way better if it was open later than 2 in the afternoon. And, on top of that, after I ordered my lunch and sat down with my computer, the owner asked if I knew they were closing soon.   Umm, can I enjoy my lunch, please? That's the only reason why they don't get 5 stars. The owner need to learn to treat his customers as good as his employees do. Oh, and they could really use a bike rack and some outdoor seating!  Anyways, I still have to give them props for their delicious food and awesome iced tea. I scarfed my sandwich and the side salads are full of lots of veggies, not just lettuce and a single tomato. I was also super pumped to see that they actually have mayo-free tuna salad. Yes! Finally! A place in Cleveland that doesn't think tuna salad means \"swimming in mayo!\""}
{"text":"I went here to get a cup of coffee to try to support a local business instead of the Starbucks across the street.  The coffee tastes like something you'd get at a gas station that was brewed the day before"}
{"text":"The hours are incredibly annoying but the food is fantastic. I love the mac n cheese, which you can only get on Friday, and the Napa Chicken Salad Sandwich. Great place to eat if you work downtown. Try to go around 1, so you can avoid the rush."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place when my bus stop temporarily moved up Euclid.  Really enjoy stopping in, wish they had extended hours/weekend hours so that I could try some lunch!  Cute place, good coffee, to-go salads I've gotten have been yummy and they carry some neat, unique items like honeycomb."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Cant beat Intelligentsia and cant find it any closer.  But the service is horribly meh. I mean meh meh, perhaps bleh meh? Regardless, better service would knock it out of the park.  In short -- to an already short review -- if you are driving take the extra 10mins and drive to Ohio city for some great houses, if you are stuck in the area you could do worse?"}
{"text":"I saw the various reviews on this place and being new to the area I figured I'd try it out.  I'll say that I was very impressed!  The coffee was great. And not to mention everything was priced quite well.  I got out of there spending only 6 dollars on two items that I know from experience would have cost me about 8 or 9 at Garbagebucks. On top of this the staff was superb. They greeted me very warmly and were friendly throughout my entire time there. The only downside to this coffee shop (why it's not receiving a 5 star) is that they close at 4 during the week and 3 on weekends.  Personally I like to meet friends for coffee or go myself later on in the afternoon but apparently most of the businesses in that area close around that same time. Considering it is a 1 minute walk from a very busy campus I would have expected it to be open until at least 8.   Overall I loved it. But unfortunately I will need to find somewhere else to go for a great after dinner coffee....sadly enough...it will be hard to beat the coffee I had there today."}
{"text":"I frequent moko, because I work in the building where it is located. It is an unassuming little place--I doubt I would have ever wandered in off of the street expecting to find as many food offerings as they have. I have tried almost everything that they sell, and I've hardly ever been disappointed.  Some favorites: Soups: tomato bleu cheese (not super bleu cheesy, just the way I like it), Italian wedding, Coconut Curry Chicken (perfect amount of spice, in my opinion), and mac and cheese (not soup--but it is listed as one of their soup offerings on Fridays. It is artery-clogging good...)  Sandwiches: Napa Chicken Salad (the cranberry spread is a nice addition), Pulled Pork (tangy bbq + slaw = really tasty), Angelina (a great veg option--kind of sloppy, but really tasty roasted veggies, mozz, and pesto). I have tried all of their breads, and they are all great. Really fresh, soft, and delicious.  Sweets: Their muffins are really good- chewy and not too sweet. I also love their lemon bars.  In short, this is way more than just a coffee shop, as their marquee over the awning suggests. It is a great place to get a fresh lunch if you find yourself in the playhouse square district."}
{"text":"Moko is absolutely my favorite place to get coffee, catch up on e-mail (free wi-fi and a quiet balcony to hide), not to mention get a great lunch, in downtown Cleveland.   They make legitimately delicious coffee unlike the burnt tasting sugar water shop across the street (I'll give you a hint, it starts with a 'star' ends with a 'bucks').  If you are in downtown Cleveland in the cold winter months, I would highly recommend stopping in for the spicy tomato and blue cheese soup which is amazingly complemented by the 3 cheese sandwich!  Also, if you need Intelligentsia beans, he has a full array.  Cheers Mike!  Great place!"}
{"text":"Went in today for a bowl of soup. The line was kind of long and moved very slowly. After I placed my order I had to wait another ten minutes until it was ready. Total wait time over 20 minutes. Terrible service! No concern at all for patrons. Avoid!!!"}
