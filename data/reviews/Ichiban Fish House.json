{"text":"It is really hit or miss. I drive from scarbough to get my craving when I meeting up with freinds who leave in Richmond Hill. 


I ordered the medium sushi and sushimi boat. Decent selection of fish.


Some day the quility is amazing and other days it taste like end of day dales a the sushi place in the mall. 


Service is typical asain. So don't expect that much.   Also bathroom are inside the mall, so don't want nice shoes. 

  
When in season 
They also have sea urchin (uni) In the shell but they only give you four pieces instead of five.



But it is still good value.

It can get.buay here so go early like at 6 or call in advance for takeout.  The mall closes ealry.



Some days it is 5 stars with service , fish quility and overall experience.   Other it can be brutal with a one star. 


But better than most in the nothern part of gta for mid priced suahi"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi restaurants in the area. The prices are fairly reasonable but it's the service, portion size, and delicious food that keep me coming back. Definitely a great value. The restaurant looks nice and the restrooms were clean."}
{"text":"This is already the third time I have been here. I luv this place, it is one of my favourite place for Japanese food. The price is reasonable and the sericw is good. Foods are delicious so I would recommend this place to anyone who love Japanese food."}
{"text":"Have been going to this place for years now. Havent gone in a little over a year but was there again just last week. Great sushi as usual. This time I also tried the Kalbi beef and it was yummy!

added a star because I remembered that they gave me a complimentary dish for being a good customer. Always good quality."}
{"text":"Went into this place with two of my friends and had no idea what to expect. Not going to lie but he outside of the restaurant was not very appealing to me but we wanted to try anyways. 

They had a great selection of bento boxes, rolls, and sashimi. The prices weren't too crazy (12-17 dollars for bento boxes) 

I got the bento box with calamari.
It came with the soup which I didn't like too much. But the bento box came with many options of sushi, glass noodles, rice and some fried veggies with teriyaki sauce, I believe. 

The wait time was good for us and the service was great. 

I would probably come back here again to try other options!"}
{"text":"Just in for quick take out, but this is one of our regular haunts for good sushi. It's expensive but not overpriced because te fish is very good. Lots of creative rolls with  fresh ingredients and clever presentation. 

Ichiban roll is usually a must and I want to buy some sashimi grade salmon in bulk to make some salmon ceviche at home.

Service is usually great but te store is a bit small, but it's cozy."}
{"text":"food was ok, I know the sashimi is usually fresh and service is quite good usually.

The waitress serving us, a party of 15, kept telling us that we tipped too little. As we left, she kept staring at us and kept on repeating \"terrible tips.\"

Never going back again."}
{"text":"I reported them. I wont ever visit that place again.

{"text":"The restaurant quality has really gotten worse over time, food and fish quality, store bought products vs made in the restaurant. If you are looking for average quality sushi, and hit or miss service, with above average prices for what you get then you have found your place.  I cannot recommend this place any longer."}
{"text":"The Spicy tuna roll was the worst I've ever had, almost made me vomit. After complaining, the rolls were replaced, but were equally bad. So I concluded either their fish is not fresh or they dont know how to make spicy rolls. Anyway, I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"Ordered the Premium Chirashi Sushi set.  When arrived, everything looked fine until I tasted it.  It was very apparent that the chef mistakenly put plain rice as oppose to the correct sushi rice.

I politely informed the waitress of the chef's mistake only to be given an attitude and a response ...an I quote \"I DON'T THINK SO\" and walked away.  Called her back and only after a brief conversation did she agree to bring my plate back to the chef for an exchange.  I can see that her and the chef had an lengthy conversation before remaking my food again.  

While the chef was remaking my plate he too was looking over at our table with an annoyed and dirty look. Upon bringing back the new plate she rolled her eyes at us.  Did he also do something to my food perhaps??

For the record, the food wasn't that great anyways. Very very average. I would honestly give this place 3 stars but given the experience here, I would give 0 stars if Yelp had the option."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of sushi but I've never wanted to throw up. I had a piece of sashimi from this place and literally had to throw up into my napkin. There were two bones in the salmon and they were cut poorly. The maki absorbed all the oil from the tempura they put inside and the rice was completely full of oil. It was terrible."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's nice and quaint. The food is GREAT! Their sushi doesn't consist of a giant piece of rice like many places. Their fish is fresh and delicious. The rice is not too hard or soft. Good service. Good prices. Even take out is great! What's more to ask! :D"}
{"text":"This is our regular place when we crave some RAW FISH.  Meidum Platter (half sushi and sashmi) ... Good value for your money!"}
{"text":"Sushi is really great at this place. I am a regular in ordering party trays at this place. The quality is good, packaging is good and price is right.
I've dine-in a couple of times and enjoyed the sushi and sashimi. Everything was made with quality and care. The place is small so you might have to wait for table. Service is below average. The guys and gals behind the counter making the orders are amazingly friendly, but the people waiting on tables are not so good, not as friendly."}
{"text":"Have been to this place a few times over the past couple of years.  The food quality is pretty consistent but specials are sometimes hit or miss. The favorite choices is a chirashi salmon, which is always a good portion and fairly priced.  Dynamite roll came out in a small-ish portion and wasn't that impressive. Their tea is good.  The service is OK when the restaurant is slow, but when busy takes quite awhile to get a server to come to the table and for food to arrive.  In summary: good neighbourhood sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Upping this to a four-star because after all these years, it is still my go to place for Salmon Chirashi. That must mean something right?! 

There's something to be said about consistency and walking into a restaurant and knowing exactly what you're going to get. And for this reason, Ichiban Fish House, you have moved up a notch in my books! Huzzah!"}
{"text":"My favourite place for Japanese food. The fish is always fresh, the sashimi is in big chunks, even the fish in sushi rolls are much more than expected."}
{"text":"First time here, impressed by the super sized chirashi box and bento box. Unagi roll was also good. Presentation and food quality is four stars. Great service too!"}
{"text":"There is only really 4 things i order from this place.

super chirashi (approx $14) enough food for you to take some home
salmon chirashi ($10) -never failed me
sushi chirashi (great assortment $10) (accept requests for substitutes if you dont like shrimp, white tuna..etc)
uni sushi ($5/2PCS) -SUPER fresh and not available during off season

service can be kinda slow at times and staff tend to be loud when the restaurant is empty and ive seen the kitchen staff sitting next to us eating their meals 

however, like one of the previous yelper said the chirashi keeps me coming back for more. 

parking is the worst part about going to this restaurant. They only have street parking and there's always parking officer roaming that street.

they have a full wine/sake/soju selection and i get the impression that the staff are not quite knowledgeable.

ive ordered beef sashimi, and chicken katsu in the past but i dont think that the quality is anything worth trying."}
{"text":"I have been to this Ichiban for many years and have always had a decent experience (food and service), but this changed this time around for different reasons. 
1. They added tea to their beverage list at $2. This is not a significant amount, but i can go to another restaurant within a minute walking distance that doesnt charge anything, with good food.
2. After placing our order for two, it took the waitress another 10 minutes to only serve us our beverages, 2 soy sauce dishes that were dirty - stained with uncleaned soy, edamame beans cold and unsalted.
3. Another 15 minutes later, our miso soup fonally arrived. What happened to the complimentary tofu??
4. 45 minutes after ordering our food, my chirashi salmon and my husbands spider hand roll were served, but what happened to the other chicken bento we ordered??
5. 10 minutes later, the chicken bento arrived. Sadly, the chicken was cold, dressing missing from the salad, rest of the food was mediocre.
6. Tables throughout the restaurant had dirty dishes not cleared from patrons that had left more than 30minutes ago. 

Not sure what happened to Ichiban Spring Garden but i DO NOT recommend coming here, unless you plan to stay here for more than 1 hour for a meal that should be 30min."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for whenever I have craving for raw fish! Management has improved, and so has the food in the more recent years. I do have to say a few years back, the quality was not so good, but it's actually good now. 

It's a small place, but it can get pretty busy here. Definitely the best Japanese restaurant in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Best quality at an affordable price. You can have uni, lobster and a large variety of fresh fish for $60. It's says for 2 people but we never really can finish it all. It is super fresh!"}
{"text":"I've been here more than 10 times for sashimi, maki, hand rolls and Ha Da Bap (the sashimi with lettuce and seaweed on rice).

I've never had a bad meal (of the items listed above).
Service is good.
Price is fair."}
{"text":"Average food quality but really poor service.
Our food order was incorrect (and no apology whatsoever) and when ask for something all you get is \"it's coming\" but nothing came.

Also, try to avoid fried items.  All you will see is batter without any meat inside."}
{"text":"First visit here with small group for sushi . Fish I would rate 6/10 . Service was very fast  and friendly . Could be a little cleaner .."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, just getting around to writing a review.  Definitely one of the better sushi places I've found.  It's very clean and the service is always quick and polite.  Food is consistently good; my only slight complaint would be that the edamame is served cold and plain (I prefer hot, with sea salt).  I tried the Super Chirashi special today and it was totally delicious.  Perfect mix of sashimi, rice and some interesting little sides.  I didn't know what they all were, but I tend to be a fairly adventurous eater so as long as it tastes good, I'm in."}
{"text":"Sashimi are always fresh, the price is relatively low for its quality and the waiting time is short. I always order their salmon neck and kalbi! But the place is too small for any large party and the seats are not always the best option to do catch up with friends. Overall, I would recommend this place as my top sushi places!"}
{"text":"When I'm craving sushi, this is the place for me. Sushi party trays are at a good price and can be ordered right away or call ahead. Sushi tastes fresh and if you pay cash you get 10% off which is a good deal."}
{"text":"The Salmon chirasi was good, inside was a little run down. 

Service is slow and the restaurant was empty with one other table being attend to at 4pm on Sunday. Took about 15 minutes to prepare our salmon chirashi and a dynamite roll we ordered with with 3 sushi chefs at the front. The food took a lot of time to prepare in my honest opinion. Decided to go up to the counter to pay to speed up the process. 

There is no parking lot for the restaurant. One must pay for street parking. Really not worth it if you drive here but for a local it may be alright place to walk to, to get your sushi fix."}
{"text":"really fresh fish for its low price. this sushi resaurant is actually one of the oldest in north york area since 1999(? im pretty sure) when u enter, sushi bar greets u with irashaimasen and ur immediately seated by a waitress or waiter. hot green tea is usually given as soon as you seat down and after you order, some free edamame and tofu comes out. then u get the food u ordered (fast) and ur tea is never emptied bc of the constant refill and quality checks. the place is old but i looks neat."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever. They were better before. Our waitress sat at the table right beside us with her friends which is extremely weird. Was not attentive at all and when I waved at her she had to finish her convo first. Never once asked me how things were. Her friends were extremely obnoxious as well eating dessert they brought in themselves. Food was terrible. The sashimi was very fishy and  tough. Was not fresh at all. Also have a feeling she was the owner."}
{"text":"After new owners taking over, the service, quality and cleanliness have declined. MUCH better japanese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I came here with my family and ordered the 72 piece sashimi and sushi platter. The fish was really fresh - I particularly love good scallop and sweet shrimp sashimi. It is definitely a hole-in-the-wall as it wasn't busy at all. I have only previously ordered takeout before and was glad I came in for dinner. The menu is really helpful with ordering as the pictures were relatively reflective of the food that we got. The service was quite nice too! I would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"This is the best place to get Hae Dup Bup that I know of. Korean style with or without rice. Amazing! They owners will know who this is when they read this. It's my usual for years."}
{"text":"Ichiban in Japanese means \"best\" or \"number 1\". Personally I've had really good sushi at my local farm boy. The presentation on the plate was good save for the hair in my platter. It took 15 minutes to prepare. It was soft and well sliced. Taste wise was not as fresh and it lacked that direct from sea flavour. Price was expected for a chef's choice platter. Colour was a bit subpar. I did a takeout order but it may be quite nice to eat in."}
{"text":"WHO are all these people giving this place 4 stars? This place is a sorry excuse for a sushi place. I came here for lunch with a coworker and we both had an bento lunch box. 

First, their menus are literally just pictures and sticker labels with hand-written prices in a photo album. No, actually. The 'menu' isn't even categorized or has tabs that would show you that lunch bento boxes are in the back of the menu. HORRIBLE.

The food itself was OK. All of the bento boxes come with tempura. WHAT IF someone doesn't like tempura?? I guess they never thought about that...

Usually with bento boxes you get sides like japjae (which is Korean, but apparently tomato tomato), fried tofu, etc. I got seaweed salad (fine), a SHU MEI (wtf?) and a western-style meatball (HUH??). 

First, the shu mei that I got is from frozen because I used to buy them myself. They're by this Chinese brand that has a stick figure in the logo. I can go to the store and pick it out for you. Also, I'm PRETTY sure that the meatball is PC brand. Yes, I am very well-versed in frozen appetizers. 

The rest of the bento box was fine. Nothing to write home about. But since I KNOW that their apps are from frozen, there's no saying whether their fish is previously frozen as well so I'm VERY skeptical. I wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"Great place for takeout tray and hwae dup bap. Everything is fresh and the trays are always consistent!"}
{"text":"First time there.  Went inside with no expectations and come out with no surprises.  

The price is good - $less than $30 for 2 person for lunch.  

The start serving some soba, in mini cup, and another bowl of miso soup.

We ordered the bento with chicken teriyaki and salmon teriyaki.  The chicken and salmon are below average, but safe for consumption and no weird/fishy smell.  The tempura was good, but this is from someone who was on diet and did not eat tempura for over a year.  In addition to the shrimps, there is a piece of yam and pumpkin, both my favourite.  We didn't touch the salad.

The service was mediocre.  Nothing good or bad about it (except you have to ask for tea refills).

For the sake of eating (and not tasting), it was good.  No sure if I will go again..."}
{"text":"Friend suggested to come here as we were craving for sushi. It was the closest sushi joint in the area. I barely ever come to this plaza as I've heard stories in the past so that's why the thought of coming makes me feel uncomfortable (those of you who know the stories, you should know what I mean). 

Their menu is in pictures form so it is pretty self explanatory. They seem to offer different combo deals. Their menu isn't really up to date as they only showed just sushi platters or just sashimi platters. We had to ask our server about the combination of both sushi and sashimi since that was what we wanted (which they didn't include a picture in their menu). The server told us that it would be the same price so we ordered 60 pieces for approximately $72. For that many pieces, it is a pretty decent price but I wouldn't say the quality was amazing or premium. This is not the spot if you're expecting high quality. I liked that a miso soup, green salad and green tea ice cream were included with our meal. 

Moreover, staff were friendly. They greeted us upon arrival and as we were leaving. Our server was prompt in collecting our dirty plates. Food arrived to our table pretty quickly after order was placed. Ichiban is a small casual restaurant. Overall, a decent experience. I will be back to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Nothing special about it. Service was a bit slow for lunch. What was a real turn off was their dessert. They pre scoop and freeze their green tea ice cream in bowls. It must have absorbed all the flavours of everything going into that freezer because it tasted disgusting."}
{"text":"Ichiban Fish House is one of those restaurants that I always pass by. Nothing against it, but in my mind, it is one of those same-old-same-old Japanese places that serve the usual fanfare of Bento Boxes A1-Z1, California Hand Rolls, and Fried Tofu. This restaurant is exactly that, but whatever because, I think I have found my new fave late-night (ish) hang out place that is in my area. 

Intro. My boyfriend and I always lament the lack of late night places to hang out on the weekend. Since I live in the Bayview and Shep area, most restaurants or local eateries close by 10-ish. Which is why we always go to the Yonge and Shep area, but we were decidedly not feeling the same old Moxie's cuisine. And so, we decided to go for Japanese. Can I just say this restaurant was packed! As we walked in, we were greeted with hello's from the men at the Sushi bar and were promptly seated.

Food. The menu is extensive and they actually have a lot of set menu's (Bento sets, Sushi and/or Sashimi set dinners, Curry dinners and Vegetarian Dinner sets). You know what...sometime's I like not having to think of individual Sushi/Sashimi pieces to order so these dinner sets really take the pressure of  because they include all the yummy things. Because I was not hungry, I ordered the California and Spicy Tuna Hand Roll. Can I just say that the Spicy Tuna was so yummy! This restaurants adds crunchy, flaky bits (don't know what they're called), but it just creates the perfect bite. I would have ordered another one, but I was helping my boyfriend with his Sashimi Dinner Set which comes with pieces of Salmon, Tuna and White Fish along with California Roll, salad, mixed tempura and cold noodles with a hint of Sesame Oil. All that for around $14.00 which is a great deal!

Because I love my booze, I also ordered a 300ml Sake for 30 bucks. That was on the more expensive side, but they do have a lot of 300ml Sake options for less which is nice. Sometimes, Japanese restaurants only carry limited Sake's and they are always so expensive...

Service. Our guy was so nice - he pulled the next table for us so we wouldn't be cramped, offered us Edamame beans as appetizers and gave both of us Miso soups. It could be they just wanted to clear their inventory for the day, but regardless, he was very thoughtful.  

All in all, we left this place around 10:30 and there will still a lot of guests eating dinner and drinking, which means my find for a late-night spot in my area is now over. You can never go wrong with Japanese cuisine and they have lots of drinks, so even if you just wanted to pop in for Sake, this is a great place. The total bill came out to be $50 some dollars, but that is because of the Sake. So sans-alcohol, this won't break the bank. This is a definite yes and a come-back in my books!"}
{"text":"Very nice little place inside ???. Amazing quality sushi and sashimi. Their menu is a photo album so it's very self explanatory. They usually have combos or specials andare pretty decently priced platters. They also serve Japanese beer, sake and soju.

It's a pretty small place and seats very little people so keep that in mind. Seats under 60 people. 

You always get mixed green salad, miso soup and green tea ice cream with your order.

Cash order take outs are either 10% off or tax free depends on what they say at the time. So they do get a lot of orders. Call to make your orders.

Service is pretty good. They speak Japanese, English and Mandarin.

I often come here for special celebrations or milestones because it's not overly priced and you get great quality food. They are not all you can eat.

They serve seasonal greatness like oysters, hamachi, lobster sashimi, toro, uni, scallop sashimi, ebi sweet shrimp sashimi, fish liver etc."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch. The servers were very friendly and the restaurant is very cute and clean. 

We had the Chef's Chirashi, bulgogi, and I usho soup. Everything was absolutely delicious! 

We were also given green tea, edemame and tofu pieces on the house.

I will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"My go-to place in the GTA if I want chirashi don at a reasonable price. They give a generous portion of sashimi and the perfect amount of rice. Their rolls are pretty good too.
The only thing I don't like is the menu layout, which is just a photo album. But it is what it is- its good for people who are new to sushi."}
{"text":"Ordered the lobster sashimi special 
, the unagi Don and sashimi salad, the sashimi salad was somewhat mediocre, lots  of vegetables and not too much sashimi, the Unagi Don lunch special was tiny, and lobster sashimi was kind of too moist..overall an average lunch experience"}
{"text":"Ichiban is a small cozy Japanese restaurant in Richmond Hill.  I been here over 10 times in pass few years.  I used to come here a lot more often as this place been here for a very long time.  They have good maki rolls but their sashimi quality is not to par with other places. The price at Ichiban is very reasonable.  They can get full quick as they only have like 10 tables.  They have a photo album of all their food as the menu which is pretty cool.  Service is pretty good as well.  I see they have some very good maki party tray deals that might be worth a look.  Ichiban offers some pretty good signature rolls such as the No name roll.  The last few times I been here it seems like the quality is getting worst don't know if they have new staff.

Update: Apparently they have a new owner that could be the reason for the recent decline at Ichiban.

{"text":"Fresh fish and good pricing. Came here for take out after Sushi Moto was too busy and we didn't want to wait. Ichiban was pretty busy on a friday night so we decide to come here. Got the Rainbow roll and the Lover's platter.  Both was very good.  WIll come back for sure"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and I think the quality and price for a sushi place in this area is not bad at all.

The combos and meal comes with miso soup, salad and green tea ice cream (yumm).  I believe I ordered the combo #1 that comes with 6 pieces of maki, various sashimi and sushi. Along with that we ordered one of their special rolls with warm fish on top, this roll was quite delicious but tasted weird once it cooled down. The sauce may it feel very heavy as well.

Overall, good sushi for once in a while but definitely some better places out there."}
{"text":"alway busy, like ram-crammed.
the service tends to be a bit harried, but always friendly.
the hae-dup bap is good here, if not typical. except they have two options: japanese-style or korean-style. js is chunks of fish and ks is slivers. personally, i prefer the ks, because the fish gets incorporated into the salad and rice so each mouthful is balanced.
nothing to scream about - positively or negatively. just a good option.
oh, the lighting is glaringly bright. don't bring an ugly date."}
{"text":"-Server not offer/ask if I want any drink and turn around to do something else during my ordering! She bring me tea after I asked and apologize when she bought me the tea which is not too bad.
Might be due to short of staff! 

- Should change the oil more often for the deep fry!!!

-Tempura should have thiner batter!!!  

Hope management will review, I seen better day here before!"}
{"text":"I really want it to like this place. This restaurant is located in North York where you'll probably find better Asians restaurants than this. Although this is a Japanese restaurant, it is owned by Koreans. The decor is nice. The restaurant was fairly busy when we were there and service was attentive but the food was very disappointing. I ordered the Seafood Udon and the broth was flavourless and as you can tell by the picture, there was little amount of noodles. 

I'm willing to give this restaurant another chance but if the rest of their menu taste like the Udon, it will be my last time. 

Hopeful..."}
{"text":"Fish is fresh, Price $$$, but its worth it. I dont think you can find any restaurants that provide AAA grade quality, but also same price range in Richmond hill."}
{"text":"Used to come here quite a bit over the years, but it seems to have gone downhill over the years. Ended up here when another restaurant was closed, and was pleasantly surprised to see that it was quite full. Waited for a bit, but got seated rather quickly. 

A very small interior space, but a good number of manageable tables. The menus are quite unique in that they are photo albums, featuring everything they have in photos. Just a little hard to navigate as they aren't really sectioned off. The photo album also hasn't changed over the years, so some of the photos are a bit outdated.

My friends and I decided to go for the boat to get as much food as we could. The fish was quite fresh, but some of the sashimi cuts were so large, it wasn't that enjoyable. The sushi and rolls were amazing though. 
I have been here a couple times before and found that some of the items weren't that good. The gyoza especially were all soggy and flat. Not recommended. 

The service was absolutely horrendous though. We weren't given tea when we sat down, and had to ask for it! Our soup and salad came, but we didn't have chopsticks of napkins either. I asked for chopsticks, thinking the server would give us both, but only came with chopsticks. I then had to ask again for napkins. Towards the end of our meal, I requested some more tea, which the same server from earlier forgot. I asked again, just to give her the benefit of the doubt, but she forgot again. She would listen to my request, but then immediately go to do something else! I could tell she was getting annoyed with me asking her multiple times, but if she decided to use her brain, none of this would have happened... Overall, the servers all seemed to hate that they were there and were not very friendly at all. 

A good place for some a la carte Japanese food, but I would be careful what you order, and beware of the service. The sushi and rolls saved their star rating."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for many years and have always had a good experience! The menu has a lot of variety and the staff are very friendly. The sushi is also very good quality and fresh"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best sushi restaurants in the city at this price range.  They offer selections that are not offered at the \"average\" sushi joints.  The Baked Scallop and Snow Cron rolls are to die for.  Also delicious is their selection of raw oysters.  The Aji is also highly recommended.   I live downtown, and would drive all that way just to eat here!"}
{"text":"The food was alright for the price paid. It was a large and spacious place. We had a very friendly server."}
{"text":"I was initially going to go to Sakura next door, but decided to try something new!
As soon as I was seated to my table, I kind of wanted to leave - I don't know if anyone else has had an experience like that when going to a restaurant.
I came alone and was seated in what seemed like the smallest table ever, even though the restaurant was practically empty - and I just felt very awkward being there.

I ordered the chicken teriyaki lunch special for 9.95.  It came with a miso soup, edamame, and the bento box (rice, salad, chicken, tofu, japchae).  everything was  average; the sauce on the chicken teriyaki was overpowering.

This restaurant is like someone going through the motions without any care - both the food and the service.  The prices for lunch are much higher than any other Japanese restaurant in the area, without any justification.
 I wish I had gone to Sakura instead, and can safely say I will never return."}
{"text":"Unfresh and very very fishy.. Sushi were cut before even ordered :( we ordered their special sushi boat.. 40 pieces and boy were they tiny.. :( and I ended up paying $20! Sorry guys I would high recommend staying away from it"}
{"text":"I don't know if I would rave about this place like the other reviewers. The sashimi was okay. It didn't seem that fresh. I ordered the dragon roll and the unagi on top was overcooked and fishy. The rainbow roll was okay. Nothing spectacular. The hardest to stomach was the sashimi. It didn't seem that fresh. Maybe it was my fault for coming on a weekday so the fish was old? I would say that this place is comparable to senbazuru, but I would much rather go there. It has a nicer atmosphere and the fish seems fresher. The rolls here have more flavour though. It's nice that they do serve miso soup, salad and ice cream here. 

Maybe because I compare every sushi place to MiNe sushi, which is the best sushi I've had in the York Region area...I find it difficult to enjoy sushi from other restaurants."}
{"text":"Mediocre, really. 

Ordered a lunch special - a don katsu bento box - and was thoroughly tired of it only a few minutes in. The don katsu itself was very dry. The sushi was very bland. The tempura, while decent, was ruined by the tempura sauce which had a distinct sweet taste reminiscent of Chinese medicine.

Overall, the food looked like the atmosphere and the servers - namely that of blandness, boringness, and lingering hope for something a bit better."}
{"text":"I went to pickup the food few month ago so called the store. When I made the call and said I'll be there within 20 min and she laugh and said need more time. I am waiting 30 +20 min. All the order is coming out except mine. This is bad service. I will not come here again"}
{"text":"Management has changed since I last reviewed this place. The place underwent renovations to look more nice and modern. Food quality is really good now, and Ichiban is now my favourite place to go for Japanese food now. The fish is fresh, and I can't seem to find a place in the area that's any better. Sometimes the service can be a bit slow, but the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their spicy salmon hand rolls are to die for. Their sushi pizza is good as well (excellent presentation wise), but could be improved if the rice was a little more fried and if it had green onion, caviar, and tobiko on it. Otherwise, really great food and fresh fish. 

The reason I gave them 4 and not 5 stars is because it's hard to find parking here, and you have to pay. If you don't, you get a ticket from the \"officer\" hiding in the bushes.

I can always get a table here and the staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"Authentic sushi - made by real Japanese sushi chefs!  Friendly staff and great sushi and rolls. The menu is all pictures, its a photo album. Can get really busy so make a reservation"}
{"text":"I came here with my sister and mom on a weekday night. There was a few tables occupied but still had lots of seatings available. We were seated immediately and was given the 'menu'. The menu was a photobook which was different than other restaurants. I actually like how it is a photobook, each menu item having a picture to refer to. 

We ordered the medium sushi/sashimi boat and a uni crab roll. The sushi was fresh and the sushi/sashimi boat had a good variety of sashimi. There was different cuts of tuna and salmon and you can taste the difference between each cut. 
The uni crab roll had crab meat in it topped with their sauce and slightly torched uni. I wasn't blown away with the roll but it was still good. 
The meal comes with miso soup, salad and green tea ice cream.

The service was great, the waitress came back a few times to fill our water. The portion size offered is good as we left satisfied."}
{"text":"The Lobster Roll was presented in a nice way, with the lobster tail sticking out of one of the rolls and the eight-piece roll divided up in a half formation on the plate. I tried one roll and I thought that there wasn't very much lobster in the roll. My dining partner thought that the lobster shouldn't have been fried with a tempura batter; it took away from the lobster taste in the sushi roll.

The Fried Salmon Skin Roll was a new roll I don't think I've tried before.  It was interesting and its insides were all fried salmon skin.  It was very crunchy but otherwise I wasn't a huge fan of it."}
{"text":"Best Sushi Ever,

We have been going there for years!    Great take out platters for parties
Best sushi & sashimi in Richmond!

{"text":"Ichiban is a gem, and a North York sushi institution!  This place has been around for at least 20 years now!

Delicious cuts of fish are prepared and presented by proper sushi chefs. The staff are friendly and attentive and the general ambience is inviting and warm.

Exceptional value makes this one of my favourite restaurants for when I'm really hungry. I always leave with a full and happy belly."}
{"text":"i remember in University we used to come here all the time, because the choices were either this (and it wasn't even that cheap) or sapporo sushi up the street. 

Came here today because we had some gift certificates. it was my first time eating out with my new food intolerance diet, so I was having a hard time choosing something that didn't conflict with me (until i realized Soya sauce is made out of soy)

So we kept it simple. A small Sushi boat (she said had about 20 pieces). And a salmon belly appetizer. 

because i can't drink green tea (and it's sweltering hot outside) i asked for water, and it came in a big cup that got refilled occasionally).

Our sushi boat wasn't a boat, but slices on a plate. But we had some good meaningful pieces, and not filler like shrimp or egg or surf clam. I think there was a good 5 different fish on there. 

Staff is friendly, and you are shouted the obligatory asaya masay!! when you walk in. 

price wis wasn't too bad. $28.00 for 2 people."}
{"text":"The food wasn't that tasty, maybe it was a busy Saturday night, there weren't much service at all, we had to wait for a very long time to have our orders ready!!  The price was reasonable, but I probably would not come back for a second time, since there are so many more Japanese/Korean food around Yonge and Sheppard..."}
{"text":"Summary: Overall, this isn't a good place. There are nicer places within seconds of walking distance that offer a much better value. It's so easy to opt for something better in North York, so do yourself a favour. 

Ichiban sushi houses are already questionable for a lot of reasons. Not a very good experience at all. Firstly, they add tea to the menu, I've never in my life had to pay for tea while having sushi, and here they charge $2, and $2 isn't a big deal obviously, however it's the fact that I can walk 30 seconds to one of probably 15 sushi places in the area and they'd never even try to charge for that.

The menu is also over priced, but we managed to find the spicy maki set for $13 which seemed on par with other restaurants. It had spicy tuna, spicy California, and spicy salmon. When I asked if I could substitute the tuna for a Philadelphia roll and I'm willing to pay extra, she said no we can't. Why not? Just add some cream cheese into the roll, I'm willing to pay for it. On the bright side we all got tofu and Miso soup with our orders (wasn't noted on the menu so I ordered an extra Miso soup, and when I ordered it still wasn't mentioned that my maki set already comes with Miso soup).

Our server was very friendly however, and momentarily that lifted my not-so-great experience. But my friends salmon bento box was served to her, and our maki sets were served about 5-10 minutes later. And try getting anyone's attention to ask them why only one person at our table got their food and the rest of us have to either sit and watch them eat while we're still hungry, or the person who was served feels guilty to start and their grilled food goes cold.

The salmon tasted weird and that totally turned me off from all my food. I'm super paranoid after that worldwide raw salmon scare that made everyone very sick a few years ago.

Overall, this isn't a good place. There are nicer places within seconds of walking distance that offer a much better value. It's so easy to opt for something better in North York, so do yourself a favour."}
{"text":"On the north/east side of Yonge and Sheppard, on Spring Garden, Ichiban is on an asian strip of restaurants. Finding parking isn't always easy, and is usually paid.

To begin, they provide two tiny appetizers - soba in mini cup and a bowl of edamame, which is nice.

I order a bento box. The portion isn't that big compared to most Japanese restaurants. Other places include a few rolls of sushi, as well as dessert. Ichiban had neither. Also, I wasn't feeling full afterwards. It was mid-range, $15 and up.

The service was meh. At first they seemed okay, but then they didn't even offer to refill the tea. The restaurant wasn't busy on a Friday night."}
{"text":"We got the super chirashi and it was mainly salmon, some red snapper, 1 slice of seared tuna and 1 slice of red tuna. Makes me question what the regular chirash would be like. For dessert we got 1 slice of orange. Thats right. Generosity at its best."}
{"text":"I work in the area and I often get sushi. It's always between Ichiban and Sushi Moto. We like Ichiban because the quality is the same as Sushi Moto but the prices are lower. We've never had good customer service but for the price, we didn't mind coming. However, today was awful. The first thing I said when I got to Ichiban is that we made a reso for noon. She seated us and served us tea and soup and asked if this was for Christine. I said it was and she told me that I should have said so because our table was already prepped - but she said it with a lot of attitude. I've only ever ordered one thing off the Ichiban menu and it's the salmon lover. I always get the spicy salmon roll replaced with a normal salmon roll with cream cheese. The waitress came back and told me that it's not possible and that I have to order that roll separately. I told her that I come here almost weekly and I always order this and she said that they've never done that before. If she had said their rules changed and they no longer do substitutes, I'd be completely fine with the answer but to say they've never done that before is insulting and condescending. She charged me an extra dollar for subbing the spicy salmon for a normal salmon roll. We will not be coming here for a while - back to Sushi Moto!!!"}
{"text":"I don't usually come here to order the salmon sashimi or the california roll. If I did, I'd probably give a slightly above average rating of 3.5 stars as well because to be honest, it's hard to make those things stand out. If you would like to try something truly unique, please tolerate the higher price point and order yourself one of the Chef Specials. They are an assortment of sashimi, all arranged beautifully at the chef's discretion. Because it is up to the chef's selection and creativity, every order is unique. 

The first time my family ordered one of these Chef Specials, I had the fortune of trying an unidentified piece of thick white and pink sashimi that melted in my mouth like nothing I've ever experienced before. That was the first time I've tried O-Toro...or tuna belly, arguably the most expensive of all sashimi delicacies. Surrounding it were succulent pieces of fatty salmon belly, chewy conch meat (in its original shell), sweet scallop, and fresh sea urchin. I wasn't familiar with a lot of the fish selections that were chosen and to be honest, I didn't know what I was eating half the time. Doesn't matter, it was ALL delicious. 

The second and last time I've ordered the Chef Special, they had lobster tail and a whole fish. That's right, a fish that was about the size of a small hand, with its meat carved out and the rest of the fish (head, bone, tail) decorating the edge of the plate. They later took the fish and deep fried it so that we could enjoy the rest of it in all its crispy delight. 

It was these two one-of-a-kind experiences that have really solidified Ichiban as a great sushi place in my mind that is well-deserving of its slightly higher price point. I've tried their other dishes before, like their rolls and sushi/sashimi platters and boats. As others have pointed out, they're not bad. But if you are feeling a little adventurous, my suggestion is to save up a bit of money, come here on a special occasion, and order something that truly stands out.

{"text":"This is a small restaurant in a plaza. We had lunch here. The Ichiban combo is average but pretty good for the price. The roll was very good. The price for what you get is very good.
The washroom is the down side. After you been there you might not want to eat. They should clean up because this is the most important area in a restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of those worst place to have sashimi and sushi. The fish was so thin. He service was good and that's why I give 1 star. I will never come here again!"}
{"text":"We ordered the special boat B to share among 4 people.  The fish was NOT fresh, especially the uni.  The tables were very close together.  We got a table for 6 people but 2 seats were so narrow that it's impossible to sit.  We had 4 people so it worked out for us.  But the person at the other table was technically sitting beside me, which I don't really like.  Service were okay.  Food came out fast.  Overall experience was meh.  I would not come again."}
{"text":"Excellent Sushi, I love the volcano Roll!  I say this is my hidden gem."}
{"text":"I like their photo album menu, it makes ordering so much easier when you can just look at pictures, point and order! 

The value-for-money meal here is not their dinner menu, but their lunch menu. Sashimi is given more generously in their lunch bento boxes, as I have been told.

Anyhow, here's what we ordered for dinner:
-The medium sashimi boat had decent variety and the fish was fresh. Portion was small though for 4 people, would have been better if they sliced the sashimi a bit thicker.
-Tempura shrimp was not bad, would benefit from less batter.
-French kiss oysters ($1.95/each) was alright - not much taste but was still fairly fresh.
-Sushi roll was okay - portion was small considering the price.   

Service was excellent; courteous, fast and efficient!"}
{"text":"We've dined here several times, each of which was satisfying. I think anytime you review a sushi place the vital importance of it should be the quality and freshness of the sushi itself and this place has it. I've read several reviews about people complaining about long waits for their food but if you order sushi and it arrives to your table quickly, I'd be concerned. The sushi here is always fresh and always flavorful. There is plenty of seating and the place is spacious. Service is good, as well."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. I used to come here all the time back in high school and through first year university. I then stopped due to the influx of all you can eat sushi restaurants. I recently revisited this establishment. Still running, still Japanese, still AMAZING! 

Upon entering, you see the refrigerator full of fresh sashimi ready for you to consume and the sushi bar with the master slicing away but immediately looks up to greet you with many hellos and head nods. 

Service can get a little slow during peak hours, especially at lunch as there are many offices around in which patrons will need speedy service. So if you want speedy, show up in a suit with a swipe card.

When ordering, if you don't know what you want, fret not my friends but everything is in photo format and all you have to do is point and eat. I ordered a sashimi combo and this is the only place I know of that will give you the rare fishes. Not quite sure their names and along with the typical salmon, snapper and tunas there were other types that tasted wonderful but I couldn't name them for the life of me. Everything was fresh and the food came quite quickly. 

They do have bento box lunch specials but I would suggest trying some authentic rolls and sushi/sashimi as these are truly a testament to their longevity."}
{"text":"The past few times I ordered takeout from this place has gone from decent down to the recent experience and was so horrible that I had to give a review. I ordered the sashimi and sushi combo large. On the phone the lady said it would take 30minutes or so. When I got there early (15minutes before I called) the order was already ready (all packed in a bag). It did not occur to me what was wrong until I got home that both the fish and rice were so hard everything was not edible. Definitely appeared the order was not made fresh. I quickly called the restaurant (still 45minutes before their closing hours) and no one answered the phone. Was obvious a scam. And it was a Monday night and Tuesday they close on Tuesday."}
{"text":"Never judge a book by the covers applies here. Not sure if they had an off day but when we went on Canada Day the food we received could only be described as amateurish in direct contrast to the well presented interior of this roomy restaurant.
On the rolls we ordered, the rice was undercooked and the avocado in the rolls ranged from barely ripened to completely raw and crunchy-chewy. 

 Chewy, this happened to be the word that came to mind the most while eating, be it the chewy rice the chewy avocado, the chewy mayo crab or even the chewy eel . 
The only thing that wasn't chewy was the salmon which wasn't very fresh and was mostly mushy.

  Overall we agreed that we would have had better eats from grocery store sushi platters that are apparently a better bang for your buck than the menu items at Ichiban Fish House. With a wealth of other sushi offerings on Yonge street it might be well advised to make a detour elsewhere."}
{"text":"Me and a friend went there last night for dinner. The services are awesome! We really love the chicken karage and we had three orders of it lollll. The crazy love roll were great too. However we didn't like the short rib bento box for take out. The total experience was perfect!"}
{"text":"Price for lunch bento pretty affordable at less than or a little over $10. 

We were here on a Sunday lunch. 

Bolgogi, eel, chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu were pretty much at par with other Japanese places. Quite good and would come back in the near future. 

The sushi that came with the bento was like the ones from the CHINESE groceries so I guess you get what you pay for. 

Service was a bit slower due to more customers when we were there but it wasn't that slow so not a problem."}
{"text":"Food pretty good for a weekend lunch. Service took some time as it was quite busy that Sunday afternoon. Lunch bento were ok - the best being the salmon and beef teriyaki"}
{"text":"Love this place! Ingredients are always fresh and staff their are always friendly. They have become acquainted with me to know that I don't prefer red tuna and that I prefer salmon or white tuna in place of it. The prices here are very fair. Their combo one includes 6 pieces of sadhu, 6pcs maki rolls and I think 4 pcs of sushi - all for $13-14! They serve complementary salad and ice cream with every meal. Love their ice cream as they chill their scoops individually."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner (since the korean place nearby was closed sadly) AND BOIIIII I DO NOT LIKE THIS PLACE AT ALL

They have a HUGE menu like damn. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to eat, but in the end I chose the nabeyaki udon. Now I had pretty high expectations because the nabeyaki I had at Toshi Ryoriten was pretty bomb, but of course they didn't even meet 1/4 of my expectations. Not gonna lie, it tasted okay at first. But the more I ate, the more I hated it. It was EXTREMELY SWEET LIKE EXTREMELY. No doubt from the onions and possibly the mirin. But wow like LEGIT. My tongue felt like it was covered with a few layers of sugar particles. No matter how much water I drank, it couldn't get rid of the sweetness. It was like super-glued to my tongue. Holy shit monkeys. Worst thing ever. I usually finish all my food, but I really couldn't with this one. Anymore and I think I'm gonna get diabetes no joke. I also got to try one of their sushi/sashimi platter things (the one that is like $42 or something) and nah mate. It was pretty bad too. I think I had the tuna sashimi and it was not fresh at all. It was like mushy in my mouth and VERY fishy tasting like yup I tasted the whole ocean in my mouth. MMMMMMMM -.-

Will not and can not come here again. (As I'm typing this, I'm reliving the moment I was there and dear lord I feel sick)"}
{"text":"This place is slowly going downhill.  The portions are smaller, fish is not as fresh.  This used to be my go to sushi restaurant but I no longer recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good when you're in the mood for some sushi. It's not the best I've ever had but it's pretty good considering the area. 
I truly dislike many of the sushi bars in RH and Markham, especially the ones who consider it the norm to stuff the roll with mayo. I want Japanese food, not a miniature burger in seaweed with fish and rice.  

The bento box I ordered was more than satisfying, yet considering the reviews I was waiting for something a little more mind-blowing. Maybe I'll give the Sashimi and Udon a shot on my next visit. 

For those of you who've never been here before. Be warned, the tempura contains the odd slice of apple. Really. Apple in tempura."}
{"text":"Staff can sometimes be unfriendly at the end of their shift (understandable) but the food quality is okay. Perhaps I came at a bad time but it's been a consistent experience over the 3 times I've gone there."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while because I find that the prices here are more expensive than other sushi places. However, the sushi here is pretty good. Very fresh which is always key. Parking is always a problem because there are a lot of stores on this street and not a lot of parking spots. I usually get a couple orders of sushi and one of the chirashi dishes. There is plenty of sashimi in these chirashi dishes and also a lot of rice which I think they throw in the make the dish look bigger and to fill you up. Maybe it's their way of justifying the very expensive price tag on here. If you go for lunch, it's usually packed. For dinner, it's not that crowded but there are still a lot of people who come here for sushi. The service is decent. The tea is brought out pretty fast. I've had troubles getting water before. They tend to take their time getting it and I have had to ask different waiters for water on multiple occasions. The actual meal takes a little longer than most sushi places to make. They do get a lot of take out orders that they work on which would probably explain it. Overall, if you don't mind spending a little more money for some very fresh sushi, then come here."}
{"text":"I came here twice last week after reading some reviews, I thought I'd check it out. 

I loved their sashimi and sushi. It was fresh and not frosty (like some places). 

Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. I was disappointed in their maki rolls. They had some unique rolls, like the lobster roll, no name, scallop rolls. Very were tasty... but it came with a price. I was chugging down tea like a camel. I think their sauce has a lot of MSG because I was really thirsty.

Otherwise it's good. I also tried their soft shell crab. It was good, but I've had better in San Francisco."}
{"text":"Quite busy for a Saturday for take out. On the downside already a bad impression when entering the restaurant. We had to wait 15 minutes for a table when there were visibly empty seats in the back of the restaurant. 

After we were seated the waiter was already trying to get our order. We just sat down. The menu was hard to navigate. It is a picture album menu. 

Another down side to the menu is that it does not indicate whether it is a daily or weekend special. As customers beside us tried to order a combo but was denied. 

Appetizer were standard miso soup and salad. Salad dressing on the salty and garlicky side for me. 

We ordered the medium tray maki  roll combo for $37.95 and the golden treasure roll for $14.95.

Sushi taste was good. Rice to fish ratio was good. Rice had right balance of vinegar. 

The meal ended with complementary green tea ice cream. 

Overall a good meal besides from poor first impression which is key to returning customers."}
{"text":"I too think that over last while the sushi has gotten worse over time, by that meaning it's not fresh, but it is passable."}
{"text":"Ichiban Fish House is my go-to sushi restaurant in the GTA/Richmond Hill. The fish is always fresh, expertly prepared and presented, and delicious for all occasions. The restaurant is a tad small so during busy hours/holidays, it can be a wait. Their menus are easy to choose plates from as they are picture menus. Some of their best deals are their lunch specials and party trays. The latter is always a good takeaway option for parties."}
{"text":"The only sushi place I know that is actually run by Japanese chefs. I think it makes all the difference in noodles, rolls, rice, and even the delicate sizing of fish. You can find many dishes here that I have yet to see in other Japanese restaurants. 

The chefs bar is located in front of the entrance and you will be greeted by multiple head bobs by at least 4 people upon entering. If that doesn't scream authentic Japanese then you need to leave the country, go to Japan, witness the head bobs upon arrival, come back to Canada, then come back here and tell me it's not authentic! Here you will taste the most succulent fish and most delicious rolls in this fair city. 

The inside is very small and the location isn't great but the food definitely makes up for it. The inside is decorated in typical Japanese fashion with paper wall dividers and bamboo accents. This restaurant is located in what can only be described as an Asian mall for food. Picture a small strip mall where the only thing located inside are restaurants, a spa, and a convenience store. It is the strangest mall I've ever been to but Ichiban is here so it makes it all better.

Overall, my favorite place to grab sushi that isn't all you can eat. When I want some quality sushi or even just quality food I look to Ichiban to dish it out. Prices here are reasonable and more than worth the quality food."}
{"text":"Have been visiting this restaurant from time to time for a quick lunch since years ago. I think the quality has gone down from before.

Fish quality is similar to some average AYCE. To be honest, good AYCE places like Matsuda has surpassing sushi quality, flavour, freshness than the fish at this restaurant. 

The tempura batter is soaked in oil, as if it's been deep fried more than once. I tasted more oil than the shrimp or yam. I only ate 2 of the tempura pieces out of like 8 pieces. 

The price is quite reasonable for the portions, especially for their bentos. Around $14 after taxes and tips."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, good quality, good price, good selection, good service.  I always order takeout from here too.  They r very on time with their orders."}
{"text":"The lunch box sets located at the back of the menu probably have the best value overall. They're around $10-13 for a box set which includes a salad and miso soup to start, assorted sushi/tempura shrimp & vegetables/sashimi/rice depending on which set you get, and ice cream to finish. 

Getting an individual roll with 7 pieces ranges from $7-11, but the sushi is good. The tempura is not so good. It used to be better, but now it's kind of meh. 

It's a cozy restaurant. That is to say, the tables are placed somewhat closely together so going in a group of more than 4 people might not be ideal, but it's definitely doable. 

I recommend dropping by for lunch if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and for some reason every time we go, we never know what to order. This is probably just me but I prefer a list for a menu, as suppose to flipping through the photo album one by one per item. It just makes it difficult to order when we order multiple things. Pictures are great tho! 

The wait staff speak Chinese; as it is located in a Chinese mall. Personally, I thought they could've been more helpful in helping us decide as we had no idea what to order. We had somebody sitting at our table who was vegetarian as well. We asked if there was anything vegetarian, but she didn't say anything. Instead they got us plain udon (with no vegetables) as all the udon had some sort of meat in it. After flipping through the menu, we did find an avocado and cucumber roll - so at least that was something! 

Other then that, the food was A-OK. This including the sashimi, sushi, gyoza and tempuras we've had in the past."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here last minute because they were the only place that took credit card in the entire plaza! Small quiet restaurant that gave off a mom and pop shop. Friendly waitress that sat me down right when she noticed me. Their menu is in a form of a photo album with the name and prices on the corner of the photos. 

PRO: i finally get to see what i am ordering. No need for \"assuming\" how my food will arrive. 

CON:  i had to flip through, what felt like hundreds of photos just to get to the lunch bento boxes. 

TIP: bento lunch pictures are at the end. 

I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento ($10.95) and a spicy salmon roll ($5.95). 

The chicken teriyaki bento came with a miso soup, house salad and ice cream. The miso was delicious. Smooth and you can taste it's not made from powder. The house salad has a mix of radish, cucumbers and iceberg lettuce and the usual vinegertte sauce. The bento box came with two imitation crab meat sushi roll pieces, some seaweed salad, some glass noodle, white rice, 2 pieces of shrimp tempura, 2 pieces of sweet potato tempura, 1 cucumber and 1 eggplant tempura. 

I think, the chicken was chicken breast. White meat. Not too dry. The sauce wasnt too heavy.  The chicken was on a bed of bean sprouts which was unusual for me. 

The shrimp tempura was not consistent. The first one i had was over battered then the second one was just fine. 

The spicy salmon roll was good, fresh, not a thick layer of rice and their spicy mayo was nice and cold (just like how i like it). 

Other than the photo album, the other weird thing was the waitress jusf standing there...staring at everyone in the dining room as we ate...

Other than that, the food is good!  

3.5/5"}
{"text":"The average Yelp rating is 3.5 stars, and I wholeheartedly agree with the consensus.  

This Ichiban has been in business for as long as I remember the Richlane Mall is opened.  I have patronized here numerous times over the years.  I believe the one undeniable strength of this restaurant is consistency.  The raw fish in sushi and sashimi has been reliably fresh.  The fish quality is similar to a good AYCE or slightly better than an average AYCE.  The rice has always been supple.  The portion is never large or small, just reasonable for an average person.  If you are a big eater, prepare to order an appetizer or a roll on top of a sashimi or sushi order.  The services is not super fast or attentive.  When they do wait on you, the wait staffs are courteous.  The waitress is often sensitive and patient with the needs of the children who dine with me, such as warm water not cold, nothing raw, nothing spicy, take forever to go through picture menus, etc...

3.5 stars for food, services and decoration. 0.5 stars for consistency."}
{"text":"This is a decent sushi restaurant.  I came on a Sunday afternoon for the lunch special.  I orders the Sushi Bento box which came with miso soup, salad, 2 pieces of california rolls, some tempura (Veggie & Shrimp), and 6 pieces of sushi.  You can choose to substitute all the other fish to salmon for those of you who only eat salmon.  The fish is fresh here as one should expect when eating at any sushi restaurant.  The price of the bento was only $12 which is decent for the amount of food that you get.  Service was a bit slow, but it's okay if you're not in a rush (took about 20 minutes to get our food). The restaurant is a bit small so it does fill up quickly on certain days. Overall, if you live near this restaurant and have a craving for sushi you should come try Ichiban Fish House."}
{"text":"It ain't the west coast but it'll do for dinner or lunch; I go here regularly, maybe too regularly."}
{"text":"This establishment has been around for a long time, and in a fast pace, ever changing neighbourhood, that's saying something. The atmosphere feels a bit more suited for different age groups. I know some restos in the area can have a very young hip vibe, but this one feels a bit more homey. 

My husband and I got the small sashimi and sushi combo (boat). It came loaded with lots of fresh fish - and mostly sashimi. The waitress mentioned that the boat can vary each day depending on what the chef gets. Also many thanks to the chef as he gave us a few more pieces of sashimi. We were stuffed :)

The service and value overall was really great. There were a few \"on the house\" dishes that came our way, including edamame, raw oysters, soba in broth, and mango ice cream. Great surprise!

{"text":"Small and cozy Japanese restaurant.

Got the Ichiban special B which came with 24 pieces of sashimi, 14 pieces of sushi and 14 pieces of sushi roll all for $60.95. It was presented in a wooden boat which is like the new standard now a days. The sashimi was fresh and cuts were a good size. I liked the variety of sashimi offered (shrimps, shrimp heads, uni, scallops, tuna, salmon and one other fish which I am not familiar with). There was even some special cuts of salmon which are more fatty and can be easily identified with its white fatty markings. I especially enjoyed the scallop, uni and shrimp sashimi. They were all really fresh and tasted so good.

With a total of 52 pieces we didn't think it would fill the four of us so we ended up getting some fried dumplings (gyoza) too for $7.95 which came with 9 pieces. Tasted okay but it was really only ordered to fill our hunger as the sushi boat is a bit small for 4 people. Its really recommended for 2-3 people in my opinion since I eat the amount for 2 people with my appetite.

Meal came with salad, miso soup for appetizer and green tea ice cream for dessert.

Service was fast. Prices are pretty high but the quality of the sashimi made up for it. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I keep telling myself to avoid this place for lunch and once a year or so, I always forget and come back again. Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good and the lunch pricing and bento boxes are good for your money. Lots of options to choose from. However the wait is what kills me. Every time I come here I'm waiting 45 minutes for food from the time I sit down to the time the food comes. It's not a good choice if you need to get back to your office quickly but fine if you have all afternoon to eat. I'd recommend maybe ordering ahead of time. Anyways, the wait drives me crazy so I'm going to avoid during lunch because it's just way too busy in there."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good and fast. Wait staff was attentive and came over a few times during the meal to refill our tea. Their menu was a photo album, so it was a little hard to navigate. 

What stood out was the quality of the fish. Super fresh and tasty. Sushi was great for its price."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, friendly and quick service.  Portions were a fair size. I had the Salmon Lover dinner, which was more than enough for one person. The salmon was very fresh and the tempura was light and crispy. Sapporo was half priced that evening (Saturday), which complimented my meal nicely."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my Dad. Decent Japanese and comparable to most cheap sushi restaurants like the ones you'd find in the Annex or Queen St. Nothing really stands out, in a good or bad way. 

Service was swift. Our server brought green tea without us having to ask, and right after we ordered, brought complimentary appetizers -- cold tofu in a spicy vinegar-y sauce and cold edamame (like Lesley C., I also prefer edamame served hot and salted. Oh well). 

I had the vegetarian bento box. It's a lot of food for $15. Miso soup, salad, 6 avocado cucumber rolls, tofu teriyaki, sauted veggies (mostly bean sprouts, with a few carrots and cucumbers), and vegetable tempura. Everything was pretty good, except the teriyaki sauce is really thick and gelatinous, and the flavour was overpowering. I was trying to scrape it off my tofu... 

The place itself is spacious and airy. There were a number of solo diners who kept busy watching sports on the big TV screens."}
{"text":"I really liked their lunch bento boxes. Fish are very very fresh and bento boxes consist of variety of food. Great deal and i will definitely try their dinner menu next time."}
{"text":"this is my go-to sushi place in toronto/gta area. ive been here a handful of times since i was in highschool, which is over the past 8 years! their quality of the sushi and fish are superb each time! the presentation of the sushi is also plated beautifully so also instagram worthy photos. my favourite rolls are the crunch roll and baked scallop roll. if i had to chose one roll, it would be the baked scallop roll, it never disappoints! everyone i have taken here loves this place!"}
{"text":"The restauant is tucked away in a plaza full of food and it could be difficult to find for newcomers. The menu is made up of 1990s style printed photos that give off a feeling of mediocrity. 

The food is decent, I'd say 6.5/10. Seating is right and price is average to slightly above average. I go there on occasions due to proximity but there's better options within another 10 mins drive."}
{"text":"The place was very nice on the inside, and the lady that was there was okay but seems like someone who hates everyone and probably shouldn't be in that kind of work. Any way, I was happy leaving it smelled great ( i got take out) when i got home, The portions were small I got the 9.99 lunch special, Very small. The soup was awful, the beef was okay just not much flavor, The tempura shrimp were good and the Cali sushi that came with it was simple like grocery store simple in taste. I honestly wont be back because there a lot better places in the area."}
{"text":"It's tough to pick a sushi place on this short stretch of road off Yonge where there's likely more sushi joints per capita than on any other block on the planet.
I went to Ichiban on equal parts hunch and suggestion and was not disappointed.

The seating area is made to look larger than it is: a strategically placed mirror makes the place appear to be roughly twice as large as it should. A large sushi bar looks like it would fill up if people could pick this place out of the crowd.
A sign at the front door about proper sushi eating etiquette is indicative of the calming atmosphere of the dining room. Service is attentive and professional.

We each ordered a bento box and an order of sashimi (why go to a sushi place and not order any?). The sashimi was clearly defrosted, as required by law, but the freezing was not to the detriment of how delicate and fresh-tasting the fish was. Bento boxes were nicely filled with chap chae and salads, largely dependent on the main ordered. Seaweed salad and deep-fried tofu accompanied overcooked tuna teriyaki and boring California rolls come in dinner bentos. Grilled salmon was perfectly cooked, then unpredictably slathered in teriyaki sauce, and came with grilled and some less-grilled veggies- raw onion definitely won't impress a date.

Sashimi impressed, as did the service; washrooms were difficult to find and smell of moth balls, but clean. Excellent selection of sakes for the deeper-pocketed. Great for a sushi craving. 4/5"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch around 3pm on a weekday and we were greeted nicely. I was a little sketched out when I saw the menus (it's a photo album filled with printed photos and the dishes/prices are written in). My friend and I ordered the baked scallop roll, pizza roll, and the backstreet roll to share. The baked scallop and pizza were really, really good. I didn't expect to like the pizza one as much as I did because it was so strange - pizza sauce and cheese on sushi?! The backstreet roll was meh because it had wasabi sauce all over it. I'd definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night roughly 7pm with 3 friends. Finding a parking spot was pretty hectic and we waited for about 30 minutes for a table. The restaurant isn't too big, sits roughly 10 tables of 4 and is always busy during weekends. 
We ordered the large sushi combination and a veggie roll. All in all, the quality of the fish here is always high, the size of the rolls and sushi pieces are decent as well. 
The total bill came up to about $82 after tax which is roughly $20 per person. 
For that price, I had my sushi craving satisfied but I wasn't full full. 
They also do give free green tea ice cream which is a bonus. 
This place is definitely a good restaurant that beats the quality of an all you can eat place by a mile  - but be sure to get there before dinner or lunch time rush to secure a table quickly. 
I'd give it a 3.5 stars but rounded up to a 4.
Thanks for reading, check out my other reviews :D"}
{"text":"Great service and great FOOD!! So nice to be here with family and friends. Clean and tidy."}
{"text":"Best place to have your sushi cravings filled in markham.
The menu is a picture book with the items displayed like a catalogue.
As this place is owned by koreans, their korean dishes like the kalbi and bulgogi are excellent as well.
I would say if you wanna try something here for the first time, go for the ichiban specials or the bento boxes."}
{"text":"This location specializes in Uni. 
You can expect good quality here, but man oh man is it a bit dungeonous on the inside."}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant!!  Awesome service....friendly, fast & very accommodating.....food substitutes is welcome!!  Food is decent & reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I came here and has there donkatsu don with a spicy salmon roll and salmon sashimi on the side. This place satisfies my sushi cravings for a la carte. When you walk in there's not much seating area. But the employees are very friendly throughout the whole time you are there. I didn't really like the way they made their donkatsu but overall the spicy salmon roll and sashimi were fresh and tasted right. I'm usually not a huge fan of ice cream but their complimentary green tea ice cream is amazing and I even asked for seconds. They have amazing customer service and I wouldn't necessarily say that their food is to die for but I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I live in an area with many sushi options and I find myself returning here because I love the laid back atmosphere, the polite service and the manner in which dishes are thoughtfully prepared. I don't eat raw fish so I cannot comment on this, but what I have ordered, namely tofu teriyaki bento, veg sushi with gorgeous purple rice and seaweed salad...have all been stellar. I think there is a lot of attention to detail here and the price is reasonable for what you get. I have paid a lot more for less. Only complaint is I can do without all the TV screens."}
{"text":"Ichiban is my go-to a-la-carte sushi restaurant. Over the years they have remained consistent with the quality of their sushi--it's always fresh and sweet!

I also think their menu is one of the best. They offer a variety of special sashimi/sushi but what I like most are the accompaniments with some of their combos.

Their lunch bentos are very reasonably priced, and you also get a LOT of crunchy fried tempura/veggies, fresh sashimi/sushi (or whatever main you choose), and some great sides (maki, seaweed salad, etc). When you look at similarly priced bento boxes at other Markham restaurants, I guarantee they will NOT have such a filling, well-rounded, excellent quality box like Ichiban.

Moreover, they have these chef special combos that are completely worth every dollar. These combos come with uni, sweet shrimp, and a whole bunch of other fish I do not know by name (haha) but have thoroughly enjoyed and crave constantly! These combos are meant to be shared among 2-3 people and I think it's completely worth it! I really don't know another restaurant that has such a great selection of sushi/sashimi in their combos without the \"useless\" stuff like imitation crab (get outta here). 

I will say that over the years, their bento box sides have gone from 6 yummy salmon/spicy salmon maki rolls to 2 pieces, seaweed salad, and this fishball and sui mai that don't taste very good. This is probably the only down grade they have had over the years (aka the time when the prices of everything went up). Similarly, the bento box prices have also went up, as well as the other sushi dinner combos and individual orders. Nonetheless, Ichiban remains one of the BEST sushi restaurants in Markham if you want quality sashimi at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is *THE BEST* Japanese restaurant in Richmond Hill / Markham in my opinion when it comes to the ratio of price to quality. Don't hesitate, just go there, get a table and order one of their super tasty rolls. My favourites are lobster roll, red dragon, dynamite and xmas. Trust me, you can't go wrong with this Ichiban location. It's money well spent on good food that will leave your tummy saying \"Muchas gracias\"."}
{"text":"This Ichiban is a great place for lunch or dinner. They have something I've never sen before at any mid-level Japanese restaurant - scallop teriyaki bento box. That stuff is really good if you're wondering. You should definitely try it. Grouper teriyaki bento box is also one of my favourites. If I find myself around Yonge/Sheppard craving Japanese food, I know I can trust Ichiban to feed my belly :) You can also catch a hockey game, thanks to 3 big flat screen TVs broadcasting either sports or news."}
{"text":"I gotta say, not sure if it's part of all the other Ichiban franchises but this if they are, this is definitely one of the better places. I was quite surprised. 

Blue Fin Tuna set ($35)
I actually came here just to try this.This is your real bang for the buck, where are you going to find 5 o-toro sushi, 6 o-toro sashimi, and 6 pieces of neigitoro sushi at that price?! In terms of quality I must say I've had better, but this definitely cures your toro fix. Only thing is when I originally saw pictures on instagram I saw a mix of cuts from the tuna, some looked like chu-toro and not just all o-toro - would have been nice to have a mix. Too much o-toro did make it feel really fatty and was a little too much to have all at once. 

Spicy Salmon Handrolls ($5.50 each)
These were really good. The salmon meat went all the way to the bottom. It was mixed with some tempura bits which added a nice crunch.

Unagi sushi and scallop sushi ($6.50 for each pair)
The fish were fresh - good quality. The scallops were decent size, not the thin ones some restaurants serve.

No Rice Roll ($15)
Saw this in the menu and just had to order i! Normally when I go to sushi restaurants I hate it when they stuff the rolls full of rice and I'm usually the type that would start picking the rice out. Totally enlightened me as I never had a roll without rice before! How brilliant. But anyways inside was salmon and shrimp tempura wrapped in thinly sliced avocados, and wrapped it the outer layer. I'm not 100% sure what the outer layer was to wrap the sushi - it seemed too thin to be rice paper. It actually doesn't look too appealing but it was actually really tasty.

Service was good, really friendly - the food came fast, and my tea cup was always full which is a huge plus for me since I always drink a lot of tea. They also served complimentary soup and salad, and green tea icecream as well."}
{"text":"I used to like coming here but it disappoints the last few times we've been here. The prices are increasing yet quality is not and neither is quantity. More choices of rolls does not mean all the choices are delicious. Will be a while before we visit again."}
{"text":"quaint place, sorta hole in the wall, but quite enjoyable.
Prices pretty good, fresh fish, they actually have two photo albums full of sushi pictures for their menu.
Several types of toro available, quick, friendly service."}
{"text":"I was here a little while ago with some friends, and I'm struggling to remember what I had, and what my experience was like. I guess that's why for me, it just wasn't that memorable. 

I ordered from one of their standard sushi sets, and to be honest there isn't really much to say. It was your typical, standard sushi, nothing special, not outstanding. Service was average, price was average, taste was average. It wasn't a bad experience at all, but I don't think there was anything that would make me go out of my way to come back.

Oh, but as a plus, they give you ice cream at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"An unsignificant Japanese restaurant in Toronto.

Not the worse, but far out competition for the top 50 Japanese restaurants in Toronto (would be around 250..). Closes early. Not very tasty. Not sure about freshness (i.e., not obviously that fresh). Too much corn starch in sauce for a Japanese restaurant.

Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Admittedly I didnt come here for the food but for the company so I didn't really know what I was eating. In fact, I didnt even notice that they forgot to bring me rice for my bulgogi bento box (14.95). Besides the lack of rice for our group's bento boxes, the service was pretty good, and included a bell in case we needed anything.

Free: miso soup, tofu appetizer
Bento box: tempura (good), salad (meh), 6 california rolls (good), chap jae (ok), bulgogi (ok)

My friend told me their chirashi is good and that their fish is really fresh."}
{"text":"Fast service! I came here and ordered a bento sushi box to go, which comes with a miso soup. I wasn't sure if it will be enough for 3 people, so I got Philadelphia and Western rolls too. The quality is amazing and the sushi is good portion. Great place for take out and dine in."}
{"text":"After going to this sushi place for years, now they have changed owner. The fish quality suddenly dropped from well above average to blah, no better than T&T Supermarket sushi. 

What a disappointment. 

Furthermore, about 2 hours after eating there, food-poisoning ensued. 

PS: what's with the serving of melted green tea ice cream dessert?

Definitely will stop going there for good."}
{"text":"I can here again and was really disappointed. The quality of my favourite chefs special really took a dive. You can tell just by looking at the fish that it wasn't very fresh. This was the first time I came here that I couldn't finish my food. I'm going to give this place another try and if it doesn't improve, I think I have to find another go-to jap place"}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy the quality of the sushi at this place, but they have really taken a nose dive. 

I usually always get their dynamite and spicy salmon rolls, but the last 2 times I've been here, I've gotten really bad food poisoning each time.  Beware, they may have switched to lower grade sushi."}
{"text":"Good value sushi. Fish tastes fresh and there is a big selection of combos to choose from."}
{"text":"I went to Ichiban Fish House today for lunch.

The chefs are Japanese however all the waitstaffs are Chinese. I guess because it is located in a Chinese mall so they decide to hire Chinese speaking wait staffs?

I ordered the Sushi box. It came with salad/soup/2 little piece of tofu/shrimp & vegetable tempura/8 pcs of sushi.

I personally find the sushi to be just ok.. not much different than the AYCE quality. 

The tempura though is really tasty! It has 2 shrimps, 3 pieces of vegetables. The batter is really nice and the shrimps are fresh! one of the vegetables is an piece of apple...that is quite different than the usual.

The ice cream is small but it is cold, solid and not melting!! I really don't like where places served ice cream that are half melting when they bring it to your table or there are little ice crystals inside.

Next time I going to try the Sashimi combo and something different... 

Yes I will go back again!"}
{"text":"It seems like their main priority are take-outs. Everyone who i know always complain about wait times. They dont care about actual customers sitting and waiting at least 1 hour for food. And you can find much better sushi in terms of quality and price in this area too."}
{"text":"Ichiban used to be one of my favorite reasonably-priced sushi restaurants, but it seems like this restaurant is going downhill -- possibly due to management change as the staff seems to be new.

The staff, like many sushi restaurants, are not Japanese but Chinese, so it's best to order in English rather than the Japanese names.
I ordered the Ami Ebi (sweet raw shrimp sushi), which the waitor mistaken for Edamame. We eventually were served the shrimp sushi, however they were rather small (which explains for the double serving) and the heads were not fried, just merely separated from the body and left raw and inedible. I explained to the the proper way of serving Ami Ebi which they took the heads and had them fried (but not very well).

We had to ask to have our cups of green tea refilled a few times during our meal which was a minor annoyance.

The rest of the sushi we ordered was mediocre -- not bad, but not great. The preparation and presentation of the food wasn't as good as before. The amount of wasabi and pickled ginger was rather skimpy. 

Their credit card reader was not working at the time, so they only took cash.  Luckily we had enough cash on us, as we didn't want to use the rather sketchy looking ATM just outside the restaurant and pay the ATM fees.

There has been many new sushi restaurants sprouting in this rapidly growing town, so I will rather try these before returning to Ichiban."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just at the side of my condo, it's so near to my home therefore I always have dinner there. Special sushi rolls and Maki are all good, I highly recommend beef sashimi, if u like raw to rare beef then u must try!!"}
{"text":"The food here is decent but nothing special. We got complimentary enoki mushroom soup which was nice. The sushi here is fine. Some of the rolls were falling apart or misshapen. The food took a while to come out too. I'd say the best roll was the mount Fuji roll. It was very very filling and unique."}
{"text":"Ichiban Fish House has unfortunately gone downhill.  It used to be a reliable place for me to get fresh sushi (Chirashi Sushi) at reasonable prices.  Now they put weird stringy pieces of sushi in the Chirashi bowl along with some okay pieces.  Not as fresh as it used to be.  Not as good.

Other food is mixed.  
Teriyaki is okay.  Tempura is better.  Unagi is solid."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot more back when I knew the waitresses. I knew them from when I used to eat at Inatei all the time and they had previously worked there. Recently, I've noticed that the waitresses I knew no longer work here and from what I can tell, the customer service has gone down since they've left. Realistically the only difference between then and now is that they actually seemed to know what they were doing back then. Please don't misunderstand though, the staff now are still plenty friendly but it just seems like they are either newly employed or frazzled due to the restaurant being at maximum capacity (which at most is only about 40 people). 

Since I knew about the limited seating they have, I called ahead and made a reservation. I would highly recommend doing that on any given day seeing as they don't have very much room to begin with. Seeing as the entire restaurant was filled with customers when we ordered, I didn't think much of the fact that my family and I didn't get soup and salad. After waiting around for a few minutes, I decided to ask waitress A. Waitress A said Waitress B was the the one who took our order and also subsequently told Waitress A that we had already received our soup and salad. I then called on Waitress B who told me she thought had already given us our complimentary soup and salad. I cut her some slack despite the fact that we clearly did not receive either of those aforementioned things. Eventually, she did bring them although I was still kind of miffed that she fought me on whether or not I had received complimentary items. 

I know I complained a lot in the previous paragraphs but all in all, the food was still up to its normal quality. The fish used in the sushi was fresh as usual. I also ordered the beef tataki which comes with its own sauce. I personally prefer dipping my sushi in the sauce that comes with the beef tataki rather than the soy sauce. My grandparents ordered the seafood soba although they said they would definitely not order it again saying that it was rubbery and tasteless. 

I would recommend coming during lunch since their lunch specials are good value for the amount you pay. I'll probably return given the fact that they do give you a 10% discount if you pay in cash when you get takeout.

Visited on November 8th!"}
{"text":"The food is average, service is terrible sometimes depends on the waitress. We went on a weekend evening around 9pm, restaurant was fairly empty except a few tables. I asked if we could sit in a corner area to be able to watch tv, the middle aged waitress insisted we sit somewhere in the middle for her preference . The restaurant was almost empty and they were not  closing any section because there were other tables near us, so it didn't really matter where we sat, so I refused and sat somewhere i could watch Tv? The waitress wasn't happy about it and didn't come over to take our order until after half an hour, we waved hand to ask her, she saw us but kept going to other tables or just chatted in the back with other waitresses. After half an hour, she came to take our order and 20 mins after she came back and asked what we ordered. So she didn't take our order until one hour after we got in. And I saw other customers came in one hour after us and ate at the same time. The noodle dish we ordered also took forever to come too. No tea until after we placed order and waved her again.. So keep in mind, if you see the middle aged waitress, be prepared for poor service if she is in bad mood  and don't order anything other than the sushi and sashimi as they would take forever."}
{"text":"Don't order base on their picture menu cause you will be disappointed.   Ordered the small sushi platter for dinner on Father Day, and it took them more than a hour to get 24 sushi on a plate.   The sad part is what on the plate is nothing like the picture.   Picture showed salmon belly sushi but what they gave was regular grade salmon that I could have had any buffet.  When asked why the fish cut doesn't match their picture and why only the cheap fish was given,  their excuse was the picture menu is just for picture, and if it wasn't busy she would ask the chef to change it.   Lol.. 

My $27 is better spent at a buffet next time for the same quality."}
{"text":"Restaurant looks ok and doesn't seem to ever be busy inside but the food is great.  It is affordable for a sushi place.  They taste great but nothing really stands out among the rest of the sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"Ichiban Fish House is a step above your run of the mill sushi places. It's got the specialty fish that you would expect from some of the more higher end establishments but at a fraction of the price. Here you will still find your everyday selections but it is the specials that truly make it stand out. The price is a little more expensive as well say for example comparing platters to say GALS the platter is approx $10~ more expensive and less 8 pieces. 

The service of the restaurant can be a little lacking as they always seem to be short on staff. At often times you find yourself waiting for utensils or even finding it hard to find someone to take your order due to the weird angle of the restaurant. If you dont really care about the service or lucky enough to have the server in your area do take the opportunity to wave them down and get your order in first. The only thing left to worry about is the wait for the bill.

I would give this place a try if you already haven't despite its short comings and price tag it is still a heck of a long way from establishments like Zen and the like that can easily run you $200+ for two people."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the massive Sushi boat... this has a good one.  Friendly service, good food, decent prices.  Nothing to wow about, but nothing to complain about either."}
