{"text":"Absolutely worth the money, soup e jo was fantastic and quite tasty. Ghorme sabzi was pretty good but they used too much oil, overall I definitely recommend this place and if i ever go to Montreal and be in mood for Persian food, I'd go there. Lastly, staff were nice and friendly."}
{"text":"worst service and rude owner i have never seen anything like that. the OWNER first i thought he was one of the employee but it turns out he was the owner, here is the story i went there with my girl friend and after sitting for awhile and no one came to take order i went inside and ask the guy (owner) can we have ice cream ( persian ice cream) ? while he was smiling he said \"if you eat here you can have ice cream if you don't you cant have ice cream\" !!! i was kind of shock i couldn't believe what he said. so we left and never went there any more."}
{"text":"This place is everything that you don't want in a restaurant. Rude waitresses, low quality and quantity of food, long serving time and above all an owner which is a crook.  I arrived 9:35 Friday evening there with a group of friends to try \"Chateau Amoo Jamal\" since we had envied this since long.  First they started by telling us that there is no food left. We ordered some dishes from the very limited list of options left. Then we waited and waited and waited and waited again. Meanwhile other groups of people arrived and where served earlier than us while they had ordered proper dishes like kebob, curry, etc.  I complained to the servant and she started to mock me asking for the food. I couldn't believe my ears and so embarrassed in front of my friends. Then she went in and brought the so called food in a minute or two. It was half done and it was more of snack than a proper food. Then the manager came and made excuses where I proved him wrong. He just was speechless. Not even an apology but more mockery. If this wasnt enough, then came the topping for their stellar performance. The CROOK owner said that his machine doesn't work so we had to pay cash. Obviously he was avoiding taxes. Downtown Montreal. Can you believe that!"}
{"text":"The ambiance of this restaurent is unlikable, the food is sometimes served in plastic plates, and the service is not very great. The food is sometimes good, the quality changes over time"}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever seen in Montreal.  They forget to take order from new customers. They even forget to bring the order they got just 5 minutes earlier. I reminded the waiter two times to bring my drink.  After two times he brought it when I finished my main dish. Quality of the dishes is not satisfying. I have been there several times with my friends ,  but I don't recommend it. It is waste of money and time."}
{"text":"I have been there several times and totally satisfied from their service and food quality."}
{"text":"good resturant... good service... good area... Delicious food.. but because i am irainan and i can Compare with other resturant... i Criticized ... 1. Lower frequency at menu. 2. i think their Kabab koobideh... not reqlly perfect..."}
{"text":"A variety of Iranian dishes from appetizers to main meals The price you pay is affordably set ( mostly below 10$) and you can choose to sit outside in an open area in front of the restaurant as we did this evening in late June when it's cool The weakness is the service which although is so friendly but slow ( only one waitress and many guests!) Tahchin is a MUST try they make it really well! It could be with chicken or red meat. I prefer the latter though."}
{"text":"The neighborhood spot for your Persian food fix.  Their dishes are pretty good! I love their gheme bademjan (a split pea stew with eggplant served over rice), which is a special. I also like their kubideh sandwich which is on a baguette and their chicken kabob. Their prices are very affordable and their portions are generous.  Warning, if you go in the evening, sometimes they've already run out of several dishes. I usually call in advance to check the special for the day (normally a stew with rice) and to make sure they're not out of the things that I like.   Otherwise, there is nothing special about the look and feel of this place. You're often given plastic silverware & cups and no plates when they bring out a basket of herbs (sabzi) and pita bread and butter to start.   They also have a decent amount of outdoor seating available in their front patio."}
{"text":"Very tasty Persian food here in Montreal, a $15 plate gets you a very delicious chicken kabob, a well seasoned lamb kabob, vegetables and a ton of rice. Grab some pita bread and hot sauce and dig into some Persian awesomeness. Service was attentive and smiling, food took a bit but for the quality of its preparation I did not mind. They have a small selection of hard alcohol and wine available as well. Ambiance was cozy and comfortable and not very busy for a Saturday night probably due to the rainy weather outside. Street parking only but it's Montreal, you get used to parking blocks away and walking to places."}
{"text":"As an Iranian and after 4 years living in Montreal despite the bad feedback that we had heard from the friends, we tried this restaurant for the first time. The food was the worst we ever had in Montreal. This will be the last time and We never recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience at this place. We're from California and we go to Persian restaurants pretty often. This place certainly has the best Kubideh kebabs we've tried outside of Iran! The service was fast. They even gave us each a bowl of cucumber yogurt for free which most places charge for. The staff were friendly and patient when we couldn't decide what we wanted. I highly recommend this place. And if you're a kebab fan, you should definitely try their juicy \"nan & kebab\"."}
{"text":"So price is good for quality of food and great location and there it ends.  Service is horrible.  We ordered appetizer that came out and was never delivered so it sat, congealed and grew cold.  The kabobs were okay but rather plain. If you like rice you will get plenty but none that has the taste of saffron.  Menu pictures are not believable beware.  Would not go back!"}
{"text":"Very solid iranian food and the price is right, especially for a downtown location. The lamb dishes were great as was the egg and spinach entr√©e."}
