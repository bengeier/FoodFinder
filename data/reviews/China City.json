{"text":"Chinese traditional Sichuan food and American style Chinese food. New chief does good job now!"}
{"text":"New Management, food is not as good as previous reviews make it out to be."}
{"text":"I love this place. The hot and sour soup is one of my favorites! Always enjoy the food. Not to mention I can call and my order will be ready in 10 min, and if I get it delivered they're pretty quick as well. Very nice staff!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal! I come her at least once a week and I've never been disappointed! My girlfriend did eat some of the typical American dishes chow main and general taso chicken. Both were the typical fake chinese however this is not PF changs! Do yourself a favor and order real chinese food. Their veggie egg rolls are amazing, crispy and fresh, the cold jelly noodles are refreshing and spicy full of flavors you'll never find at a steak house. A few other dishes I've tried are the chicken and mushrooms in brown sauce which I recommend to anyone who cannot tolerate spicy. I recently had the country style lamb which was also great. 

I hope everyone got this far into my review! My highest recommendation has to be for their hot and sour soup with I always order a large to go. The large on its own is enough for 2/3 lunches and once it sets after being chilled in the fridge you get a sense of how unctuous and rich the broth is as it will be a jelly. I always microwave or sit on a range for a few minutes to soften again. 

Also must have mapo tofu and the cumin beef/lamb. These are both spicy and delicious. This will put hair on your chest and cure your cold. I hope these suggestions were helpful"}
{"text":"Definitely not the best Chinese food on the planet, but I have never had a single complaint with the service or the food. My brother is a real regular here, so they know him by name.

I like the house special tofu and some soup. Yummm"}
{"text":"I'm used to Hunan Wok in the West Mifflin area so I'm spoiled, but I've tried a couple of Chinese food restaurants in the Robinson area and this is by far the best, it's mostly a take out place, they do have like 4 tables and chairs but noone really sits there except to wait for their food. The food is good and the staff are very nice. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The food here is as authentic as you can get here in Ohio and our favorite is their HALF ROAST DUCK which we do share!!!
Their apps are awesome and so is the service!
It is a 30 minuet or more drive ANS SOOOO WORTH IT!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The most unprofessional experience I have had in Cleveland. Ordered for delivery and was told it would take about an hour. 1 hour and 40 minutes later still no food. When I called to request an amount of time they told me that they would refund my money. When I asked what had happened they began yelling at me and hung up. I called back to ask if they were still going to attempt to deliver my food and the worker yelled that they would refund my money and hung up again. Previously I was never called to say whether my food had arrived or that it would not be delivered. I was shocked and surprised by how they handled all sides of the situation. Very unprofessional and very rude. Disappointed that I was not able to find my place for Chinese delivery or take out in Cleveland. Any recommendations?"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Kent!! My husband and I had (vegetarian) dinner at China City and were thrilled with the number and variety of dishes. The portions were sizable and plated nicely. Lotus root; Tofu in black bean sauce; Glass noodles with dried chilies! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Eat here! Best Chinese in Kent! The food is delicious and reasonably priced. Black bean sauce (hunan chicken) is on point as well as the sweeter sauces such as the one used in the empress chicken. The vegetables paired with the dishes are really good as well and the egg rolls are mmmmcrispy."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food seems really, really authentic.  So of course I think their best talents lie with the authentic dishes.  You can get the Americanized dishes too, General Tso, etc. But My favorite dishes so far are: Homemade tofu with seafood.  A huge bowl of steamy juicy saucy assorted seafood, with delicious homemade tofu balls that taste amazingly like matzah balls to me.  Not a spicy dish, but soothing and wonderful. Huge chunks of lovely tilapia. 
Dan Dan Noodles. Super spicy. And delicious. 
MaPo Tofu.  Also delicious. Very concentratedly tofu and sauce.
Kung Pao chicken.  Really the best kung pao I've had.
My husband likes the three pepper chicken with peanuts. It is insanely hot. Good insane."}
{"text":"took a coworker there today for lunch. we both orderd the sesame chicken.  took one bite and was done.  warm at best and had a sat around to long appeal to it.  the manager person asked if we did not like it, we both replied that we did not.  gave us the bill at full price and told us to have a good day."}
{"text":"We had them deliver to our hotel. We ordered seafood delight. We got instead imitation crab, 4 miniature shrimp and alot of veggies. 2 dinners cost 39.00 including delivery charge. Such a rip-off."}
{"text":"Considering this is an Americanized Chinese restaurant and I am Chinese, this is pretty good. I had shrimp with broccoli. I asked the guy over the phone if I could have that in white sauce and he had no problem with it. I was pretty happy about them being pretty accommodating and it tasted like I expected.  The broccoli was not soggy or undercooked. It was just the right amount of crunchiness. The shrimp was cooked just right too. They charged $2 for delivery and got the food in 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Great staff, good food, speedy service. My husband and I eat here often and it is always good. The food is hot and plentiful and it is reasonably priced. Nothing fancy but it's a great place for take out and I don't think they have ever messed up our order. I would recommend over some other places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This was the worst Chinese food I have ever had.
This is very difficult for me to write this review. 
I own a restaurant and I understand the preparation, detail, and care that goes into preparing any food.
I would not have wrote this , but we called to explain our dissatisfaction, and they did not hear us.
The oil was old, the soups tasteless and without veggies, and the Rice yuk!!!
What shocked me the most was they're inability to listen and correct the situation. 
I take no pleasure in trashing any body's business, but these people in our experience did not care.
I have a huge family in Pittsburgh  and I will make sure to pass the word."}
{"text":"We had enjoyed our selection several months ago, but today's order, which was supposed to be spicy (Mongolian beef), was NOT spicy at all!"}
{"text":"Sooooo mediocre. To start I ordered the crab rangoons , almond cookies, the general tso's combination dinner w/ shrimp fried rice and a shrimp egg roll. They do give a lot of sweet and sour sauce for the Rangoon's but its not sweet and sour sauce....its more like sour and bland sauce. It was just disgusting. I have never had nasty tasting sweet and sour sauce, but this was awful. 

The crab Rangoon's were no better. I only ate 1 out of the 8 because it was so disgusting. No flavor what so ever. The almond cookies were really good, you get 3 cookies for 50cent which is really good, but I don't think the restaurant makes them, their store bought. The egg roll tasted bland as well and like it had been in a freezer or some thing too long. The general tso's chicken and shrimp fried rice was good.

 I definitely won't be back though there was nothing that made me feel like it was wowzers or even really yummy. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here if you're looking for good, quick, and affordable Chinese takeout. Food has never taken more than 10 minutes and I've never gotten a wrong order (even though I was a little afraid of a potential communication error honestly). Definitely recommend if you just want some good Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"China City used to be your average run of the mill Chinese American restaurant.  I live a couple of blocks away on Morris Road, and I'd rather drive a way to get more authentic Asian food.  Recently China City was taken over by the folks from Szechuan Gourmet in Cleveland, which is one of my favorite restaurants in the area.  If you ask for it, you can order from the same menu they have in Cleveland at the restaurant in Kent, meaning you get authentic Szechuan cuisine, which is awesome!  Try the cumin lamb for an out of this world experience!  To top it off, the staff is friendly, service is quick, and the prices are almost too good to be true for what you get.  Highly recommended for a top culinary experience in a totally unexpected strip-mall setting.  I hope they can attract the customer base they deserve in this setting!"}
{"text":"Everyone needs a good Chinese restaurant in their town, and having moved to Kent from quite a ways away, and a very good Chinese restaurant, I am happy to find China City (which may be soon changing their name?).  Regardless of the name, the staff were very efficient and the food was quite good. Spice levels for the dishes were appropriate, meaning, hotter than typical American tongues may like, but we like spicy food and got what we wanted. (Truthfully, nothing was super-hot, although it looked as if you could have asked for '4 chile' heat.)  The \"double sauteed sliced pork with cabbage\" (#69, often just 'twice cooked pork') was well done; traditionally the meat used is pork belly, so one should expect \"fatty meat\" (why eat meat if not for the fat? it's called flavor!). Pork egg rolls were nice and hot (temperature) as were the dumplings, so all cooked to order. Also had minced pork w/sweet potato noodle in spicy sauce (#209), which was a new dish to my wife and myself, but with a menu like theirs, we thought we should try something different.  It was the spiciest dish, but really well balanced. Sweet potato noodles are not like eating a sweet potato, but like eating very chewy glass/cellophane noodles. I suppose one either likes them or you don't. We do.

While I have not travelled and eaten extensively in China, I have done a bit. And considering myself a Chinese food snob (I'm an ex-chef/cook, so there's where the snobbery comes in, and I have eaten a whole lot of American-Chinese restaurant food), I am pretty critical when I need to be.  Does that make me an expert? Probably not, but nonetheless, I have China City 5 stars because the food was hot, was very tasty (plenty of it), and the service was really pretty outstanding. And yes, their tea is good too.  And, it looks as if they run daily specials too; next time I'll dive into one.

So support your local Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here! I am from Austin, TX and was visiting Pittsburgh and staying at the Sheraton 4 Points. The front desk gave me two Chinese restaurants that delivered in the area. I ordered from here because the yelp review average was 4 stars and it said the delivery was fast. I would have rather waited a long time for a slower delivery place than eaten this food. The fried rice is like Spanish rice. The moo goo gai pan came with a white sauce with zero flavor and a gelatinous texture. Do not order anything from here with a white sauce! The wonton soup was horrible. I ordered a side of broccoli and they gave me an entree of broccoli. However, the broccoli was the only thing I liked so it is okay that they messed that up. The egg roll was smothered in grease!! My boyfriend ordered the sweet and sour chicken which is tough to go wrong with and he said it tasted fine. Being from Texas, I have tasted some delightful Chinese food and this place is not one of the them!!"}
{"text":"What a rip off! Ordered General Tso's Chicken. It didn't have the consistency of chicken so I started cutting the pieces open. It's all breading! One out of three pieces had some chicken in it. And what's up with using jalapeño peppers instead of Thai peppers?? 

Would not recommend..."}
{"text":"Very authentic! Fresh and well done. If you want a taste of real regional Chinese food, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Starting with crab Rangoon and crunchy spring roll. 

Side note, I never saw a Chinese restaurant menu this full since Boston. Definitely better than Pittsburgh, as a frame of reference.

Duck, squid, cuttlefish. And I am guessing you could go off menu and really get the real deal.

The crab Rangoon was the best I have ever had. The cream cheese filling was hot, with crab mixed in. May have been surimi. May have been crab. In either case, best I ever had!

When all was said and done, the wife and I agreed easily best Chinese restaurant we had ever been to together.

So gold star for best Chinese as a pair. And bonus points for best decor. 

And super double extra bonus points for a mostly Asian clientele. 

If you live anywhere between youngstown and Akron, you would be hard pressed finding better Chinese food, or just \"food\" in general."}
{"text":"Have been stopping in here for 20+ years.  This is a great little Chinese restaurant  for a quick bite on the way home after a busy day. They do have a few tables inside but it is mostly take out patrons that I've noticed.  It is located in a little strip mall with bi-lo and a pizza place at the end of Hudson Blvd.  
They have great moo shoo pork, beef lo mein and orange chicken.  Not really fond of their hot and sour soup but that's just personal taste.  I know others who really like it.  Food is always HOT and PLENTIFUL.  Reasonably priced.  Give them  a try!"}
{"text":"his is go to place for my family atleast once a week. My dad brought me there since I was kid and now it's over 15 years and I'm still enjoying their food a lot. Their price is cheap and affordable, food is fresh and they always give extra portions. Minimal oil/grease and salt yet still super tasty."}
{"text":"yuck worst wood ever the chow mein had no noodles their to tell them to change it and the tryed to get me to pay more to order again the chinese man is not cool bad english and food is not good at all."}
{"text":"This place was so bad when I first ordered from there last fall and I recently tried again after seeing good reviews on GH.  The almond cookies are amazing, they are made in house bc sometimes when I get them they're still warm and still soft. I also love the tofu veggie soup. The crab Rangoon  is good also and they give you a lot of sweet and sour. I used to hate their egg rolls, so gross. They are GREATLY improved since the last time.


I just simply cannot find a good entree here. It's always just ok. Not spicy enough or the meat is over cooked. I don't know what's up with that."}
{"text":"The food has never let me down from this particular Chinese food establishment.  When we used to live within their delivery radius they would always arrive within 40 minutes (or earlier on non-busy hours) and the food was still steaming hot.

The staff sometimes has a little trouble understanding over the phone, so I have always felt more comfortable ordering in person.  Something about giving someone a 16 digit number with my non-native accent to their non-native ears that just spells DOOOOOOOOOOOM when it comes to getting it right the first time around.

Even after we moved a couple miles out from their delivery range we still eat there since its the only one in the area that has the reliable level of quality."}
{"text":"Perfect delivery every time.  The food is always hot, but the fried rice sucks, it's yellow and weird and they throw pork in it.  They always are reliable and consistent."}
{"text":"My family has been coming to this place since the 90s, and while I can say that the food quality has declined in recent years, it is still pretty effing good.  Standouts for me are the dry garlic wings and the cantonese chow mein.  Stay away from the won ton soup, the won tons have a weird taste to them.  Good for late night delivery, they are usually pretty quick."}
{"text":"Not much in the way of Chinese restaurants in Kent, but the food here is good and reasonably priced. Friendly staff as well.

I usually buy take-out so can't comment on the dining experience."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food anywhere around the area.
They have 3 menus.
1) Lunch
2) Dinner
3) Real Chinese food (Menu With Pictures)

I find myself surrounded with Chinese people eating dish's I've never seen before.
My favorite so far is the counter lamb."}
{"text":"If  you take it for what it is -- a basic, run of the mill chinese restaurant -- it is pretty aces.

I have always enjoyed the mongolian beef, orange chicken, and the kung pao.  They will make things spicier upon request.  The take-out service is great and helpful; when dining in there are good days and bad days.

Stay away from the sweet n sour -- a little goopy for my liking."}
{"text":"Probably the only traditional Chinese-American restaurant in Kent that's worth paying attention to. Has all the classics and most are pretty good or passable. You know we heavily get down with this place"}
{"text":"I travel all over the country and have tried many small Chinese carry outs. This one is pretty middle of the road, I've had better but I've had much worse. The only big problem was that I asked for white meat chicken in the cashew chicken and was told that it is all white meet. It wasn't white meat and it was fatty. Other than that things were fine. Fried rice , lo mein, cashew chicken, sweet and sour chicken, won ton soup."}
{"text":"I was visiting the area for work and decided to order takeout via GrubHub. I chose China City and wasn't disappointed. While the food wasn't anything incredible or out of the ordinary, it was exactly what I would expect from carryout Chinese food and hit the mark in that respect. What I really appreciated was the timeliness of the order preparation, as well as how hot the food was when it arrived. Additionally, it was not overly greasy and had good flavor. I also appreciated that my order was correct and all elements arrived in my order, something that takeout places sometimes mess up. All in all, China City's food was exactly what I was craving and didn't disappoint. I would say that the quality of the food and service was above average for a restaurant of this type."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible customer service Can't believe how inconsiderate the call taker is...sent me twice cooked reheated refried sweet n sour chicken so hard nearly broke a tooth I will never order from here again no refund no kind of recompensation nothing guess I'm hungry tonight"}
{"text":"Clean place, yummy food. Was visiting my friend in Kent Univ and came to this place for lunch and dinner. Small place from outside but inside big clean sitting area. Food portions are large."}
{"text":"Very nice Chinese restaurant.  Mai Tai's are great, food was delicious and service was very friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"I came here with my family after my sisters graduation. we ordered five different dishes and all were good however the service was terrible. we had to get attention of a server more than twice for simple things like refilling our tea, rice, etc. if you plan to come with a large group, expect to pay a service charge which isn't disclosed in their menu. 

2 stars for the food, -10 times for their service."}
{"text":"I work close to the resturant, so we order from them often. The food has always been good.

They have your basic chinese take out menu containing both lunch and dinner specials.

I like the fact that they will customize your order by adding mushrooms or extra spice.  The food is always delivered hot and in a timely manner, but I do work in the same plaza so can't really judge that one."}
{"text":"Had the salt baked Pork chops wasn't too impressed by they cooking! Portions are a bit small. They're more hot red peppers than the dish itself."}
{"text":"Weekend Lunch Review

We were the only ones in the place and the service was wicked slow... and not in the \"it's fresh and takes time\" sort of way.

Potstickers - heavy, gummy, bland

General Tso's - candied, fried to beyond a crisp, but did have a nice mild burn for a heat level

White Rice - long grain and not very sticky.

Drink refills took way too long and thankfully we had exact enough change to leave a minimal tip.

Not on the favorites list... the search goes on!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews on different Chinese spots as they are all usually the same. 

This spot is WAY different. I just ordered the kung pao on lunch special for 7 bucks and received enough food for two.  The flavor explosion from all the different ingredients was amazing. Spicy. Not too much. Just enough.  Hot and sour soup was just okay, I'll go with the egg roll next time. 

I have found my new favorite spot in Kent for Chinese. A little more expensive then other spots, but the food speaks for the price. Well done!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and fast delivery.  Only complaint is that they sometimes forget to add the hot oils I ask for."}
{"text":"Finally!  A good Chinese restaurant in Robinson!  I ordered my usual Shrimp Mei Fun and this is the first time in the area that the shrimp were more than cocktail shrimp and it truly had some flavor with the heat (I always order extra spicy).  Service was quick and the staff friendly.  This by all means will be my go-to for Chinese in the area.
You do have to look for it as it is located in a mini plaza back of the Pike."}
{"text":"China city is a good place for Chinese food. Whenever we go to China City we usually have a big order and they give good customer service and treat us very well."}
{"text":"Best Wonton Egg Drop Soup of all time. They are friendly and quick at delivery. Very good egg rolls!!! Roast Pork Egg Foo Yung is their traditional best!"}
{"text":"We have ordered from this place multiple times and really enjoy it. We have tried lots of different dishes and it's definitely not the best Chinese food we have ever had in our lives, but it's your average Take Out / Delivery place. The staff is really friendly and helpful and we will definitely be ordering from them multiple times in the future."}
{"text":"Worst Kung pao... chewy rubbery dry chicken.. waste of money. Never ordering from here again"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! The food was DELIVERED hot and fresh.. Not only was the food great the expedience was good as well! They have us a 45 min delivery time frame, but came in a half an hour! My wife and I were impressed with the service we had and is definitely our go to place for late night delivered Chinese food.."}
{"text":"Best food around!! Usually get the lo mein, lower cost than most places. Recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Best crab rangoon and pork egg rolls we've found so far in the area.

Not sure how they packed so much lo mein into a quart container; seriously there was no room left. Not that I am complaining.

Mongolian beef was very good, but geez, can someone make an actual spicy dish spicy???

Expect to spend about $10/person here."}
{"text":"This is real, authentic Chinese food. I can't even believe there is something this good in Kent! And the employees here are SO nice and welcoming. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite in Kent, but now I go to stow. They seemed to change their recipes and I'm not a fan anymore"}
{"text":"My daughter has soccer practice at the Kent state field house. I asked Siri to find me a Chinese restaurant and this place was listed. I was expecting your typical cheap takeout Chinese food. I was pleasantly surprised to see specials listed on the walls written Chinese. I was going to order simple hot and sour soup but saw spicy beef shank noodle soup on the menu. It was szechuan style, not the Taiwanese style I really like but that reflects the character of this place. 
This is some of the best Chinese food I've had outside of the larger cities in Ohio. Not what I what I was expect ing. OTS located in a nondescript strip mall in Kent Ohio but this decrepit plaza has two separate Asian grocery stores. who knew there was a little, mini China town in Kent. There's a martial arts studio here as well."}
{"text":"This is a typical American Chinese food to-go restaurant.  The lady owner is friendly and the food is ok but too salty, oily and poor quality.  The whole place feels very greasy and not very clean.  My receipt was even stuck to the table after I signed it.  Worst of all, I saw one cockroach on the side of the table crawling! I really hope they can improve their cleanliness."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food, I would recommend it. The customer service is great as well, adequate delivery time. Side note, they have the good containers that make your life easier."}
{"text":"So let me tell you the story . First time we ordered food from here they forgot to put rice for my friend for sesame chicken. When we called back the phone person who barely spoke English , said it doesn't come with rice. We were like it's weird. But my food was good. After that I ordered maybe 5 more times all were good, the food was coming with a side of rice by some reason lol. So last time which was today, I ordered the same thing as always HAPPY FAMILY WITH FRIED RICE. After I got my delivery they put me steamed rice. When I called back it was different person on the phone, I couldn't even understand his English , he told me it doesn't come with fried rice and hang up on me, after I called back  he hang up on me again, I called third time asked for manager and he said he is an owner, and was super unprofessional , told me to pay for fried rice because it doesn't come with that. Even before I was getting the same order all the time with no extra charge. But the lady on the phone who took my order I told her fried rice, she said ok and asked me if I want pork or no. If she would tell me I have to pay 2$ more it's ok. The big problem in all this , how unprofessional and rude is the owner!!! He hang up 4 times on me. Didn't even let me talk. I work in the business , me and my colleges get delivery from that place all the time, so , you know what, congratulations! You just lost lots of customers! I will find better place where I can get good customer service !"}
{"text":"I'm still pretty salty about the change in ownership.  I REALLY wish someone could tell me what happened to the former owners and the people who worked here who were so kind. I am so sad I'll never taste their chicken with hot garlic sauce and won-ton soup again!!!

To those fans of former China City, please note it is under new management and operating under a new name even though their external sign still says \"China City.\"  This review is for the new business which is called Szechauan Gourmet which also has a Cleveland location. (Hopefully Yelp marks China City as closed soon and update the info.)

I'm so so very sad that China City as I knew it is closed.  When I walked in and realized it, I nearly cried.  However, the boyfriend and I still gave the new business operating here a go.  Ooolong tea still a plus.  Wonton soup ok but not the flavorful broth it used to have. I asked if they had a garlic sauce that I could get with the chicken and snow peas, they said yes but when the dish arrived it had a white sauce, lacking in flavor. (Maybe a language barrier thing, I didn't get bent out of shape about it.)

The chicken was different, not great quality but tasted fine and the veggies were fresh.  The fried rice was not very flavorful. The bf got General Tso's which was pretty tasty and he liked their hot and sour soup.  

Overall, I was fairly put off by the new ownership but also the decreased quality of the food. Service was friendly. I could be convinced to give them another try but it's not likely to come soon with the other options in the area based on our last experience and the pain of remembrance."}
{"text":"I am a student at PTC, they delivered here which was great and I felt like I got a lot of food for cheap. And it all tasted good"}
{"text":"Amazing Food Great Service. I recommend this for lunch or dinner. I grow tired of the same foods everyday but I love this place."}
{"text":"AVOID - Gross, greasy food, slow delivery, small portions = BIG TIME RIP OFF!

We decided to order delivery from this place because of the decent reviews on Yelp but, let me tell you, this was a major letdown - absolutely disgusting!  These people should be ashamed of themselves to rip off customers to this extent.  I'm pissed because this was severe highway robbery!

We called at about 6:45pm on a Tuesday night and ordered crispy beef, pork fried rice, salt and pepper squid and two spring rolls to be delivered less than five minutes away; however, we were told that it would take ONE HOUR. That's right, ONE FREAKIN HOUR!!!  Our bad as that should have been a telltale sign to cancel the order but, again, because of the Yelp reviews, we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and move forward.

The food arrived at about 8pm with no condiments, no napkins and no chopsticks or cutlery.  The pork fried rice was more like plain fried rice as it had only about 10-15 little pieces of pork in it; not to mention, it was extremely greasy.  There were only about 10-12 pieces of the salt and pepper squid on a huge bed of lettuce.  The squid, like the fried rice, was extremely greasy and tasted like it may have been fried in old oil.  The crispy beef was kind of eatable but seemed more like a dish you'd get from Manchu Wok - lots of red chicken ball sauce poured over it.  Finally, I don't even know what that thing was that they called a spring roll - it was actually wrapped in phyllo pastry!  I didn't even try it because it looked simply nasty.  I was told it was greasy (no surprise) and tasted extremely foul ... surprised we didn't get sick. 

THIS PLACE SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN!"}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere, great service, and excellent food, all at a reasonable price with large portions.

This is not Cantonese, it's more authentic, more spices and flavors. 

When one goes to an ethnic restaurant, and finds it full of people with that ethnicity, it's a pretty good sign! 2/3's of the patrons on a weeknight were Asian, and I'm pleased we found this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the most authentic Chinese I've ever had. The menu is extensive and has classic faux Chinese dishes as well as crazy fungus things I've never heard of but look really cool. They even serve their sake in hot water pitchers so it stays warm! When my friends come to Kent I always recommend China City for an interesting experience and delicious food."}
{"text":"The new management was super courteous and prompt with the food when we were dining in. The food was delicious! Authentic and spicy (because we requested extra spice), and I could eat it by the bucket-ful. The peppercorn chicken and spicy lamb were really good. We will definitely be frequenting this location, and it's no wonder that they're so successful in Cleveland. If you like to try new stuff and if you like good food, definitely try it out."}
{"text":"Recently went there with a friend had the hot pot and it was very good more than we could eat. People are friendly and courteous food was great and although it was a tiny bit pricey would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"i previously gave china city a 5 star review. we went here for years, and the food was absolutely delicious. on 9.10.14 we went here excited for the food as usual, but i should have known something was different when my husband had to wait 20 minutes in the restaurant for our food after already calling in the order and waiting. i bit into the veggie eggroll and said, \"oh...i think they changed this recipe. it's not as good\", but shrugged and continued on. my husband tried the wonton soup which he is normally a FANATIC for, but could immediately tell it was different too, and not in a good way. such a disappointment. i then opened up my fried rice, and just by looking at it, i could tell it was not going to be the fried rice i know and love. tried it, and nope. different. i called them to ask if they changed some recipes, and they said it's a completely new restaurant, but they still have the same name. such a shame. wanted to warn others that the past good reviews will no longer be for this new management! such a let down, and we will not be going back :("}
{"text":"The best Szechuan food I have had! I was amazed to find this gem in Kent. Not like other places that serve only Americanized Asian food. If you like spicy food I would definitely recommend this place. We had the fish fillet in hot oil and the hot pepper chicken with peanuts and the green beans. All amazing dishes and I can't wait to go back and try more the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Not the best  thing I ever ate, but great for Chinese takeout. Convenient location not far from my office helps too. I had the sesame chicken with fried rice and egg drop soup. Tasty stuff"}
{"text":"Authentic Sichuan food, and in my opinion one of the best Chinese restaurants in the area aside from those all the way in Cleveland or Beachwood. Service is good, and the food comes out very quickly after you order. I can't attest to any American Chinese food here because I usually order Chinese/Sichuan classics. I've come here a dozen times by now, and I can speak on quite a few dishes. From my last visit:

Beef Tripe & Tendon with Chili Sauce: Very popular Sichuan cold dish, which they make really well here. Do not order this if you don't like spice! Everything is sliced very thin and coated in chili oil, so the heat will build up!

Dried Sauteed String Beans: I'd be surprised if they messed this up since it's a pretty simple Chinese dish. It's salty and oily and overall yummy. Even if you eat American Chinese food, I would recommend this dish.

Eggplant in Spicy Garlic Sauce: Cooked well! (I hate it when my eggplant is overly mushy.) The sauce is slightly sweet and mild in taste--I didn't realize it was supposed to be spicy. A nice break for your tastebuds if all of your other dishes are spicy.

Salt & Pepper Tofu: Didn't really have any flavor. Unlike Salt & Pepper Shrimp, the tofu itself has no flavor so the frying/seasoning provides all of the flavor rather than accentuating. Get the Salt & Pepper Shrimp instead!

Taian Fish Fillet: Meh. The fish slices were cooked ok, but the sauce was very watery. Therefore, it didn't hold onto the fish well, and the fish wasn't very flavorful. Further, the bok choy was coated in oil. I recommend the \"water boiled fish slices\" instead (I'm not sure this is what it's called in English as this is a direct translation from Chinese, but it's spicy poached fish).

Szechuan Dried Pepper Chicken with Peanuts: You'll find that most of this dish is chopped chili peppers rather than chicken, but that's pretty typical. I think they overcooked the chicken slightly because it was tougher/harder than it should be. Also, I wish they used boneless chicken instead because then you'd get more bang for your buck. However, the flavor was good, and my complaints didn't keep me from enjoying the dish.

Mapo Tofu: I've had better, but still ok dish. It's spicy, but I'm used to my Mapo tofu being make-me-cry spicy. The sauce is good, but the flavor doesn't permeate the tofu blocks fully.

I didn't order this last time, but I recommend the Dry Pot (it's spicy), where you can customize what proteins and veggies you want cooked together in your pot! Also, if you like kidney, their sauteed kidney dish is pretty good. They do slightly overcook the kidney (this dish is extremely easy to overcook because it requires very high heat for a very short period of time), but I really like the sauce. 

Overall, solid Chinese food in this area!"}
{"text":"China City gets a FIVE ALL DAY BABY! This place is definitely the best Chinese place I've been to in Kent so far. Their General Tso's Chicken is amazing which is what I usually get with the Crab Rangoon. However, I definitely want to try the duck next."}
{"text":"Real Sichuan food in NE Ohio, yay! This is as real as you will find for Sichuan food in the Kent area. Guests from Sichuan Province, the we have taken here, really liked it. When I see reviews that rate this place low I suspect they are all people that 

1. Don't know what real Sichuan food is about, and thus...
2. Are ordering food that they shouldn't

By that last point I mean, if Chinese person were to go to a American style steak house in China and order a pizza, they are probably doing it wrong. Same with China City. It's a Sichuan style restaurant. Yes, they carry the things that Americans expect from a Chinese restaurant (General Tso's, Lemon Chicken, etc.... all of the \"not really Chinese\" dishes that are fine for what they are but are really American dishes) but they only do this because people expect it. Take a look at what the Chinese people in the place are ordering... that's the stuff this restaurant specializes in. 

Stick to the real Sichuan style dishes and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Never order from this place!!!! Took two hours for the food to be delivered... I wish I would've canceled it because it was most disgusting Chinese food I have ever had. It was so nasty.... vegetables were old and soggy. The sauce tasted disgusting.  It tasted like it had been reheated 100 times it was a few weeks old!
Do not waste your money! There are other Chinese restaurants in Robinson that are pretty good."}
{"text":"Pretty ho-hum, average chinese take-out/delivery place. I've ordered food on here twice now on grubhub and have gotten exactly what I expected each time. I'm the sort of dude who orders a ton of food for multiple meals when I get chinese, and my $30 got me 3 meals and 2 snacks worth, which is a good deal. Their orange chicken is identical to their general tso's, whereas most restaurants throw in some orange peels to differentiate the two. I will say the Wonton soup was just jam-packed with wontons, which is nice. Overall a good place to get chinese  when you are craving it, although their are alternatives that may be better."}
{"text":"I just started going to this place last week. It's no Mandarin, but it's alright. For $6.50 you can get about 3lbs of food that is pretty tasty. 
The combo I get consists of Chicken Chow Mein (the best part of the meal...LOTS of nice white chicken chunks), plain fried rice that you think would be boring but is actually quite nice, 4 huge chicken balls that have a little too much batter, and an eggroll - which is the curdle in the milk. The eggroll is basically inedible, its like trying to bite through a fried sack of wet shoelaces. It is impossible to eat, so I just eat the crispy shell. 
I wasn't expecting much walking into this place but they surprised me. For a quick dinner of Chinese food, this will do the trick."}
{"text":"I LOVE China City.

Great food and good prices. Great place to go before the movie. Unassuming but really a treat."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. First, the service is great. Literally amazed anybody has written weirdness about the service - perhaps a cultural things as this is an Asian experience. They are wonderful. Efficient, friendly, knowledgeable. 

Second, the real deal food. Yes, they dish all the American \"Chinese\" food and do that very well. But then there is the more authentic and if you can get past Kung Pao chicken, this is akin to what you might experience in CA or NY, etc., where sizable Asian populations make for crazy good restaurants. But you have this in a modest strip mall in Kent- which is completely, and totally, awesome. 

I won't bore you with my multiple stops here and meals. Just go and try for yourself. I suspect you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have always loved this place! But the new owners that took over made it a place to go!!! It's sooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Actual authentic Chinese food in Kent! A small nondescript locale in a strip mall that took me by surprise. The place appears to be frequented by international students. The dishes were flavorful Szechuan tastes. 

If you're looking for General Tso's chicken, just an FYI, no self respecting Chinese person ever eats this and we certainly don't make this dish at home! You'll find General Tso's chicken on the menu (probably to appease the uninitiated), but China City has so much more to offer."}
{"text":"I don't necessarily feel I have a right to review this place as I am torn in how I truly feel. I can't say that this was a bad experience; the service was great, the environment was clean & offered some beautiful decor & my husband loved his food (the portions are huge!). 
  Yet I can't say the same, the texture of the beef dish I had was so inconsistent that I didn't get past five  bites before I was really grossed out. Some of the beef was very tender while most of it was tough and very fatty. I cut all the fat off of my meat so maybe this just wasn't the best option for me. So I wound up eating plain steamed rice (you'd be amazed at home many people screw this up) but it would have been nice if I was offered soy sauce...couldn't find anyone until our bill magically appeared..."}
{"text":"Started off with a wonderfully nice waiter who took us to our booth. We got to our booth and he used the menus to swat a fly on our table. Gave us the same menus. We almost walked out. We ordered the Kungpow Chicken and the serving size was very adequate. The chicken was rubbery tastingg with a spice that I never tasted in a Kungpow dish. It did not taste very good. The egg rolls were over cooked. The hot tea was delicious, however. The price was reasonable and the staff was very nice."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant. They have the regular things, plus more unusual. My favorites are the Pork or Shrimp with garlic sauce. Nice heat, but not overwhelming. The spicy cucumber appetizer is really spicy. My husband likes the brisket with turnips and the frog. They also have lunch specials."}
{"text":"Friendly greeting and double check to make sure order was correct, food was prepared right there in front of me and was flavorful and generous"}
{"text":"This place for the most part was awful. The lo mein was very sweet tasting and my husbands Kung Po chicken had sliced chicken tenders in it. The donuts had very little sugar on them. I was quite unhappy that we paid $35 for gross food. This isn't our go-to Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has great food despite what others say. Yes, it's a take out food place. But the food is decent and their delivery is super fast.
Their Hot and Sour soup is wonderful. Their Kung Po Chicken tasted fresh and had some really good heat to it."}
{"text":"I have only ordered takeout once, and so my stars are based off of the single experience. The menu is very large, with a lot of specialty is not offered at other Chinese places. It was our first time so we decided to stick on the safe side with sweet and sour chicken. It was terrible. The chicken was off, The breading was off and it tasted like a vat of oil. Our food was ready quickly, but was much more expensive than other local eateries. The inside is also very dated, as is the strip mall that it's inside. If I order again, I will change my review."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp would allow two and a half stars. 

Why is it so difficult to find Moo Shu in Gastonia?  Don't know.  China City has Moo Shu  pork, chicken, etc. on their menu.  That's why I tried them. 

They ONLY take cash as of 12/01/14.   Not knowing this, I had to visit the ATM at the BiLo  next door.  Bummer. 

I got Moo Shu Chicken.  It tasted yummy, but it was light on the meat and heavy on the cabbage.  There were no mushrooms. 

The shrimp eggrolls were huge. Lots of shrimp. Mega greasy. 

The young man at the counter was friendly, very attractive. Sexy. 

China City is out of my way. I don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"I have gotten food from here on several occasions and I love it. It's not amazing like a 4 star restaurant. Remember folks it is fast food chinese take out. I have never had a problem with anything I have ever eaten from here. It all has been delicious. Their prices are also reasonable."}
{"text":"This restaurant was (rumor has it) opened because Chinese Kent State students got tired of driving to Cleveland for authentic Chinese food.

The dry pot is my favorite, with lots of meat, several kinds of tofu, lotus root, and a great variety of other vegetables. I always get the rabbit which my family complains is too bony, but I love for the slightly gamy taste. We also met a Kent State Chinese professor at the restaurant who recommended the mapo tofu and the water-cooked fish as particularly authentic.

Lamb with cumin is very tasty. Pea sprouts are always tasty everywhere. Service is very polite."}
