{"text":"I've been coming here here for a while and I think the manager left the salad bar sucks!  I don't like the pizza chuck e never comes out the potatoe salad was runny! No eggs no green olives ect and paid almost ten dollars!  Won't be back! Don't go to the one at bell and the 51 either!"}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience I will never go back in there and will never take my children one of the guys name Jonny pull a toy from  my daughter and snatch it out of her hands the managers and their don't even know what they're doing they overcharge you the pizzas were not even ready they gave me my pizza my food an hour and 40 minutes later because even if they gave it I to   another customer"}
{"text":"Can't say enough nice things about the manager Troy. Went out of his was to make sure my son's birthday was special. Food comes out fast and is delicious as well."}
{"text":"So incredibly dirty. Unsanitary to an extreme.  Garbage and food all under the soda and toy counter. Bathrooms are absolutely filthy. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Mr Cheese In respects to your cupid shuffle. You should be dancing with the perspective of the children. When the song says move to the left and you move to your left, in the eyes of the children you are moving to their right. Very confusing for a kid.Think about it from an audience perspective. I know its going to be hard to get, being a Rat. But when you say move to you left you are actually going to need to move to your right. Dancing Dad."}
{"text":"Our first time at this location and it was great! Very clean and friendly staff. We came on a Thurs. morning so not a busy time. Chuck was super nice to us and a great dancer! Buffet was yummy and they even made a pizza that I requested! They replaced a few coins that we lost in a game so that was nice too. The kids had a blast so I recommend this location!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this two stars is because my daughter had fun.  I would never visit this location again. First my pizza came out looking like it was drop on he floor. It was crowd with birthday parties but Chuck never came out on the 30 while I was there from 5pm until 9:30pm. The games were broken or not working. When someone did come to reprogram the games . He didn't put a sign on the games to let people know the game was broken. Let's talk about the unprofessional young staff. While I stood with my five year old daughter. Two stuff member were touching each other. Really. Their uniform was dirty. One girl had holes in her shirt. At the end it was time to check out, so we about 500 tickets. We stood there for 10 min until she count our tickets and they didn't have any toys my daughter wanted. It's a Saturday night but I will be calling corporate come Monday Mornings."}
{"text":"Our first time taking our 3 year old to Chuck E Cheese. Place was very clean-always saw employees walking around clean the games, etc.   Pros: - No entrance fees. -All games are 1 token =$0.25/game. -free hourly kids dance and ticket giveaways. -safe place for parents to feel at ease due to employee at front entrance who gives parents and kids the same invisible stamp so the kid can't leave with anyone else. - you can top up tickets for $0.01/ticket to redeem for prizes. -tickets and tokens never expire. -friendly staff -sunday morning events for autistic /special needs kids with reduced noise/etc. -food tasted good. Good value.  Cons: -place looks a bit dated. Could use a refresh of their videos/mascot  etc. I went to Chuck E Cheese 20 years ago and it looks the same."}
{"text":"This is the worst Chuck E Cheese I have ever been to.  The smell of urine is so strong throughout the place.  At least 5 games did not work with no sign and many more games with a sign saying out of service.  The workers were just standing around not bothering to clean or fix anything.  Whoever runs this place should be embarrassed.  We will not be returning!!!!"}
{"text":"I was a guest at a birthday party. I went to get a salad (as told by the host of the party, i could charge it to the account). 2 others in our party had already returned with full plates but i was rudely confronted by a young woman who made me feel as if i had done something wrong at the salad bar. She rudely asked with a raised voice if i had paid for my food and that i was not allowed to get anything since i didn't pay. I looked around and there were 2 other ladies at the salad bar with the same color plates  (who happened to be Caucasian ) and nothing was said to them as they filled their plates.  As a matter of fact, nobody was confronted in my party except me, and i happen to be the only minority.  I told her to charge it to the party. As i headed for my seat, i was confronted AGAIN by another young lady who proceeded to grill me once again about my salad. I was with another lady in my party who had just filled her plate  (same color plate as mine) and they said nothing to her and continued to rudely confront me about my salad. I find it very insulting and highly discriminatory that i was the only one confronted, moreover confronted in such a rude and demeaning manner. I spoke to the manager and she informed me that this was not the first complaint they have had today, with the same employees.  I was offered free salad and tokens and they assured me that the employees would be reprimanded; however,  i did not take the complimentary items and would rather bring this to corporate attention instead. How many more people have to go through this before something is done? I lodged a complaint on chuckecheese.com so i hope they read this review."}
{"text":"I took my son here for a few of his birthdays. Overall, the experience is great! The staff is great at taking care of your needs. They go out of their way to ensure that you have a good experience. The birthday packages are great, especially given that the kids are left with plenty of tokens to have a good time.   My sole complaint: Other parents failing to supervise their kids. I've been spit on and had a few kids attempt to steal the candy from my son's pinata while their parents looked on (as well as one parent who attempted to grab a few things off of our table - you know who you are).   All-in-all: Great place for birthdays! If you get here early enough, you get the whole place to yourself for a few hours (just an FYI). My son outgrew the games and we'll miss this place. Take advantage of this place while you can!"}
{"text":"This location is the best!!! It's my favorite CEC location in AZ! It has a ton of games, a stage with the band, and a really nice staff! So, let me tell you all about it!  Ok so when you first walk in, of course, you will get stamped by someone. I always run straight to some of my friends, the animatronics. Go to this location if you live or are in the Phoenix location."}
{"text":"This is a really cool location. I hate it how there is no stage. But still, it has a lot of games, and I mean a lot! And I wish they kept the ball pit. The pizza tastes alright. But let me get into bigger detail.  This particular location is great with a studio c beta stage. If you want to go to a stage with the whole band. Drive 30 minutes to Metrocenter. But no, it's still very nice and must I mention clean!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. The pizza and wings were TERRIBLE. The sauce on the pizza had a nasty dust taste to it. Almost like it was old or not fresh. The \"wings\" were just little dry soggy balls of chicken that were soooo gross with no flavor. The games are fun but a LOT were out of order or not giving tickets. My kids had fun but we won't be going back. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"I have to say that my experience  with the venue wasn't bad ,but my experience with the manager was horrible. ( Jessie) He's  rude and lazy  he gives  the impression that  he's  prejudice or maybe he just treats everyone like crap. I don't think  this is the place to work if your feel like that about people.   He needs to go back to training to learn how to deal with people. Other than that I like it."}
{"text":"Completely filthy,false advertising, unfriendly staff, outrageous pricing. ...NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"It's a great place to come and bring your little ones for some game, dance fun. & since they have an employee guarding the door so kids won't run out, you can feel secure enough to just give them tokens and let them lose. Great staff and always friendly and helpful. Also, the nice thing about the games, they are only ONE token to play and to continue. Pepper pipper pizza is cheaper, but there tokens are ridiculous. 2-4 tokens to play and to continue.  The downside of it. Pizza isn't really that good and its pricey. But if you come during payday, I think you'll be ok."}
{"text":"So got off from a 13 hour shift pretty hungry. We craved some pizza decided to get pizza at this place. Entered and were welcomed by a lady putting stamps like if it's the end of days putting the mark of the beast. We order pizza super combo, a sampler platter. Got the salad, it was ok.  I forgot I had to make like 5 trips for them to fill the salad too. And so my wife and I ate it. Played a bit with their games.Then sat down we got a pizza after 20 min then I seen one of the workers take a platter to a family next to us.  And so I got up to get soda and saw our platter then I went to sit down and seen the same person telling the cooks you got the wrong order! But instead of taking the food to us. The lady handing the food took the platter to the family that had already gotten a platter instead of making it up to us which good customer service tells you to that when you when mess up someone's order you make up to them not leave them unattended. Then one of the workers came and told, \" sorry, made a mistake we will put it right in.\" And so I said ok. With a smiley face. After 30 minutes we never got our sampler platter which probably had mediocre fries and wings like their pizza,  the pizza was so dried like the Sahara. I LOVE ME SOME SAUCE! Please put sauce on your pizza! There was comes a time when you make bad choices. I forgot to mention a lady that had a purple shirt walking around with her phone."}
{"text":"Scary.  Took my kids today. Almost immediately after opening a single homeless man came in wearing gloves and sat next to the emergency exit watching the kids. The front entrance has the hand stamper to discourage child abductors but the emergency exit must be unlocked & accessible in the event of an emergency. It made me really nervous. I alerted management who said the \"homeless\" guy frequents the place regularly but they won't deny him service because he pays. As our time wore on the man became more agitated walking around the games talking to himself pretending to put in and remove imaginary glasses and sitting down to play a driving game every time a child sat in the adjoining seat. It was pretty clear that he is mentally disturbed and made me extremely anxious. While I'm compassionate toward his circumstances I can't ignore the fact that I had very real concern of his intentions &  am worried about Chuck E Cheese's nonchalant attitude toward the matter. We cut our time there short spending both less time & money there. We will not be returning. We'll go to Peter Piper Pizza next time."}
{"text":"This is maybe 5 th or 6th time here and it's one of the okay chuck e cheese I have been to. Every time I come here there is more than a few broken games . Which is annoying because every game my son wanted to play was broken . Don't come here after the buffet is over at 2 because if you want a salad expect to wait an hour for them to set up the salad bar. It's rediculous I got a refund because they too WAY long.  The employees didn't seem happy to work there or kid friendly since it is a kids place I expect them to put at least a fake smile on. Any ways besides the broken games and the salad bar the pizza was decent."}
{"text":"The pizza is good and the place is clean. The staff is friendly but the service can sometimes be bad. We go at times when the place is empty but yet it still takes them a long time to take our order or come out to the ticket redemption area. Whatever you do, don't go there for the lunch buffet because the all you can eat pizza is awful and isn't the same as when you order it. The game selection is ok, not as good as the Scarborough location though. I'm convinced some of the games are fixed as I've been ripped off for hundreds of tickets I should have won for bonuses but then the game says I lost! What the heck?"}
{"text":"Please for the love of all things holy: call a hazmat team up in there and just start over.  Everything is covered in a thick layer of grime.  There were giant stains on the floor; if you're like me and watch a lot of Forensic Files your mind is like \"where's my bottle of luminol?\"  I shudder to think of what would happen if someone took a black light to that place.  My kids usually don't mind a generally dirty kids place (Amazing Jakes, Trampoline places) but even they were grossed out.  Food was greasy, and even the soda tasted weird and stale.  I got a salad plate and I couldn't even eat it since they put ice in the dressing containers to keep it cold!? So, there was a layer of murky water atop each dressing.  Then, I witnessed a worker take the tongs from the veggies and use it to \"stir\" the new ice she was adding to the salad bar.  Yuck!!!  I could go on & on... But I think you get the picture.  Just don't come here... Ever."}
{"text":"My little sister was invited to a party and I figured why not but since I went as a kid myself they really cut down on the more fun games. I ordered 2 individual Pizza and expected about it about the size of my hand or a little bigger but was greatly disappointed $10 each Pizza (which I got 2) and $5 for cotton candy is a rip off."}
{"text":"You get so many tokens for $10!  You can literally spend an hour playing games with your kids for such an inexpensive price. I love how every parent and child are given matching \"invisible stamps\" on their wrists, so a kid cannott walk out of the establishment  with just any adult, unless they have a matching stamp on their wrist(can only be seen with blacklight). So clever!  There's pizza and a salad bar, too!  And they host birthday parties as well. Ive been coming here as a kid, and its still fun as an adult to go with your kids!  Well worth the 10 bux!"}
{"text":"Three starts bc the food experience is bad, unless your a kid & don't know better.  However, once you accept & move on you will find that kids do love it! We took an 18 month old not knowing what to expect & if they even had baby friendly entertainment but our baby loved it!!! & they do have a few baby rides & small play zone.  Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Barely have any games that actually give a decent amount of tickets. I had to ask for the coin guy atleast about 6 times because their machines were broken and my coins would get stuck.  Would not come back here again."}
{"text":"Always your best bet when it comes to small kid entertainment.  This CEC was pleasantly clean and had all the games in working order.  I also think they must have changed the pizza because it's not as greasy as I remember it, which is a good thing.  I ordered the family 2 pizza deal and it fed my three boys well.  I went to purchase a salad from the salad bar and the nice guy at the counter let me have it for free.   If you think about it, you'd end up shelling out way more money taking the kids to an amusement park or the fair.  It's a nice celebratory place where everyone can have fun."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst place you can have a birthday! We were at this location on 1/20/13 for my 4 year olds birthday. The \"party hostess\" was more about up selling than getting our orders right or attending to guests. I seriously felt like i was in an auto dealership. As soon as you get there the selling starts. Before half of your guests have arrived and before you can even start setting up. She rushed us through every step with an emphasis on up selling and rushing the party. My daughter was upset because her mom did not come to her party. I told the hostess she is too upset to do the chuck e cheese dance and ticket blaster at that moment. The hostess told me we have to do it now or not at all. Basically we spent close to $300 and got none of the birthday perks that she is supposed to enjoy. We spoke to the manger and she did nothing. We used to come here once a week almost but I will definitely never return to a chuck e cheese again. I will also try my hardest to make sure none of my friends or family ever go back to chuck e cheese."}
{"text":"The best around the mangers are awesome and the staff is fantastic they really love kids and the pizza is great"}
{"text":"Great price and great playing atmosphere for the my little kids.  They loved it.  Perfect for a couple of hours of family fun.  Staff was very friendly and they check you in and stamp the family's hands which is ideal if a child wondered off.  Very clean, and inexpensive food, and inexpensive gaming."}
{"text":"This place provided us horrible customer service... We have attended Birthday parties here before and it was great. Our experience hands down was horrible. The staff was very inattentive, the lighter didn't work. Come on if your doing the cake as a group. At least make sure your lighters work. They didn't reserve enough space for us. Complete chaos. Manager was not very helpful. Smh! Total a bad experience."}
{"text":"Just went to this location and my family and I are very disappointed. First off the stamp girl didn't greet or say good bye with no smiles. The girl at the ordering register was nice but she's the only one working that area, when she asked for help her fellow employee ignored her. Never saw a manager! Not that I exactly needed one but hey maybe I could describe the food in person instead of yelp. So the soda was watered down, the pizza was greasy and tasteless. I asked for blue cheese and ranch with my wings and only received ranch. My wife refused to eat and so did my 15 month old son and he was hungry. Paid $36 bucks two drinks medium pizza and small wings. That's the food experience, will never go back."}
{"text":"I took my nieces at 8pm. We had to sit in the birthday room because all of the tables had dirty dishes on them. It took over 40 minutes to get 2 pizzas. There were many broken games and 2 of the ticket eaters. I let a worker know about it. No one ever replaced the tokens we lost in the games and no one ever came out to fix them. To top it all off at 9pm they turned off all of the games and show. Fortunately we were eating and didn't lose more tokens due to the games being turned off. Other people were playing when the games were shut off. Not a good way to run a business. We were there for almost an hour and according to the advertising Chuckie Cheese is supposed to come out every hour at 30 after. My nieces never got to see Chuckie. We will NEVER return to this location!"}
{"text":"Gross, gross, gross!  Did I mention GROSS???  Seriously, every single surface in this place seemed to be sticky or dirty.  At least half of the tables hadn't been cleared and the booths were covered in half eaten pizza and soda.  About a third of the games/rides weren't functioning and just ate my son's tokens.  And the pizza was the pits.  Seriously, Little Caesar's $5 pizza tastes better than what this place served us.  We went on a Thursday evening (around 5pm) and were totally disgusted.  I do not recommend this place to anyone.  The $30 that we spent here were a total waste and we wound up grabbing dinner somewhere else after leaving."}
{"text":"On a Monday-Friday during the day I would give this place 5 stars all day long! But for your safety & sanity please do not ever go on a Saturday or Sunday. My kids have grown up playing at Chuck-e-Cheese, we all love it there! But this trip ruined it forever. Had to ask 3 times to clean & fill up salad bar...after the 4th time of having to ask so I could get a salad I paid for they told us they where out of lettuce. Really?! (I'm pretty sure they just didn't want to clean & stock, so that was the easy way out) mind you there was still 4 hours before closing time! Then a fight breaks out amongst 20 black women..instead of the security guard & manager telling them to leave, they let them stand there and battle back & forth in a room full of little kids for atleast 45 minutes. DISGUSTING for all parties involved. You are in a building full of kids, is it really that hard to act normal. My son wouldn't even go to the bathroom cause he was too afraid to walk-thru the nastiness. Little kids sticking their dirty hands in the bowls on the salad bar & taking food off. And imagine that, there where no parents in sight to tell them no. Ugh not to mention how disgusting & dirty everything was. There where ripped up tickets & trash all over the floor. Dirty cups, silverware...etc! I get one full day off of work a week with my kids & it's a shame it got ruined because of ignorance!"}
{"text":"Disgusting! My husband and I were looking at potential places to hold my daughters 2nd birthday party...and this is definitely not the place.  First off, there was pizza all over the floor from a customers table along with lids and straws. My baby daughter stepped all over the pizza! I was livid because the table and floor area still had trash, and yet the customers seemed to have been gone for quite some time.   There was trash on every table, and not one to pick it up....we had to actually get someone to clean a table off for us so we can be seated.   Then, they never brought us our pizza. My husband had to walk up to the counter and ask for our items...an hour later. On top of that, we ordered BBQ wings, and the wings had both hot sauce along with BBQ sauce (as if they made a mistake and were hiding the evidence). Yet, we noticed no manager but lots of young high school kids working there.  Last, after wiping down machines and playing with my daughter because of the filth, I decided to cash in my tickets, which then never spit out a receipt. So yes, there you have it. Visit at your own risk or go to Peter Piper Pizza instead."}
{"text":"Our visit was a Monday night.    Your hand stamped with invisible ink that shows under a dark light and your kids are numbered with the same number as you and so helps protect your children.  The employee at the counter helped us get a better deal than even the coupons we had brought with us.  As you can see from the pictures we uploaded the areas were clean and there is plenty of room.    The pizza was fine nothing to write home about, but then who goes to Chucky cheese for the food?  The games were great there was stuff that would be fun for a one-year-old through adults.  There were some fun driving games for adults, skee ball style games and basically a little something for everyone.  We lost a few tokens to machines that weren't working properly, but that's to be expected at Chucky E Cheese. I'm sure we could've gotten those tokens refunded to us, but we had so many we didn't bother.   There is something they have called sky tubes  allows you to crawl around probably for the younger kids, and it has one slide that comes down from the sky tubes It was fun for our young children.  They did have one monster truck ride that moves around quite a bit so you want to make sure that your child is able to keep inside there were no safety belts in the truck at the time.  Employees check before you leave to make sure that your children's number matches yours.  Even though it was dark when we left, it still felt very safe in the parking lot.    This is the best chuck e cheese I have been to in the USA."}
{"text":"My kids love this place. They never want to leave. Chuck comes out dances and give out tickets. Nice to be a kid again."}
{"text":"DANGEROUS for kids and parents! Management does not care !  Went there with my kids on May 2nd, 2010 and got threatened by another customer (\"shut the f&&% up or I punch you in the face\") - the manager on duty did not care at all. His response was \"thank you for bringing this to our attention\".  Here is the incident in detail: my 2 yr old daughter was playing in the TODDLER area and two other boys (age around 6 and 10) were \"playing\" there too ... the boys understanding of playing was to PUSH and KICK other children as well verbally assaulting them (\"wanna try me, huh?) ... the adult in charge of the two boys did not pay attention at all to what his boys were doing ... when i went to him to tell him in a CALM voice that he should perhaps keep an eye on them and that the 12 yr old should perhaps not play in the toddler area at all the man got VERY ANGRY and started to verbally ASSAULT me, THREATEN me, YELLING at me and point his finger right in my face etc !!! Even when I walked away he kept following me .....   When I described the above incident to the MANAGER on duty he his response was \"thank you for bringing this to our attention\" and then he just walked away without even talking to the other man !!! This is totally UNACCEPTABLE!!! Chuck E Cheese should be a safe place for kids and parent to hang out and have fun !!! the manager should be trained to not only care about CHILDREN BEING ASSAULATED and PARENTS BEING THREATENED on his premises - he should also be trained to handle situations like that professionally !!! I am extremely disappointed by this particular Chuck E Cheese location and CANNOT RECOMMEND this location to any parent unless you don't care about your kids safety !!"}
{"text":"After my terrible incident at the Dixie Rd location I will probably visit this location in the future even though it's a longer drive for us.. this location appears to be more professionally managed and cleaner than the other location. the food is still as greasy as at any other Chuck E. Cheese's but no normal person goes to Chuck E. Cheese's for the food anyways !! it's all about the games and fun !! there are plenty of decent food choices in the area ......"}
{"text":"My sons birthday party was scheduled from 3-5pm and they kicked us off the tables at 430 to set up for the next party. They have a 30 minute gap between parties but if they need more they should lengthen the gap between parties. The host told me we could move to booths if we found any available. Really? It was a Saturday evening, so 32 guest had to share 4 booths. Just be aware they say you have 2 hours, but it's really an hour and a half. It's not personalized to your child, everyone just sings happy birthday to all the birthday kids."}
{"text":"Great salad bar, something for the little \"little\" kids and the little kids, pizza was passable. Only one game was broken, and I didn't spend much money. I think for a quick low budget kid place, it's great. At any rate, it's better than Peter Piper, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Chuck E Cheese is our typical Friday outing.  We had an activity in south Phoenix so on our way home we stopped at the closest one.  This was our first time at the one.  The good thing is they had different machines then the other ones we go to.  But the one thing my daughter loves about Chuck E Cheese is \"Chuck E Cheese\". At this one I almost had to become Chuck E myself, we almost had to force them to bring Chuck E out. We got there at 5pm, we were about to leave and they finally brought him out.  So we she did get to see him but almost by force."}
{"text":"Horrible place! It's dirty, food was cold and the salad bar was warm! The salad bar was a total mess and the lettuce was yellow and wilted. Half of the games would take your coins and the ticket counter is a total rip off and would count 10 tickets and give you credit for 1??? Too expensive for the service.. If I would've known my experience was going to be this bad, I would've simply gone to Peter Piper where at least the food is good.  The staff looked very unhappy and not one person smiled!!!"}
{"text":"Took our 1yo there during the week around 3:00 there wasn't anyone there it was great! She had a wonderful time! But I wish it was as big as the old one was...i feel like there isn't a whole lot of things for them to do. A little pricey but a great once in a while treat!"}
{"text":"We come to this CEC every trip we make to Pheonix.....about twice a year.  We have always had a great time!  My kids are 7 yrs and 4 yrs and love this place.  Today we went and found 8 machines not working.  My kids were in tears from frustration.  I found an employee who gVe the kids a handful of tokens and began working on the machines.  I was impressed.    My kids have once again had a blast!  *The pizza was awesome.  That always shocks me."}
{"text":"Horrible serviced and they count the wrong tickets for you... They don't even want to fix them fault... They just want quick to get order customer... And don't really care about you. When you try to told them... They don't answer then just get other customer... Don't want to come back here anymore... Sad day"}
{"text":"This was our first time at this location. It is 100% cleaner then the bell Rd location, the staff is personable and friendly. The few games that malfunctuoned while we were there were either fix right away or put out of order. These games run all day and constantly get played theur are going to malfunction every once in awhile. We just had pepperoni pizza and salad but both were good. The kids had fun so we will go back."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience. Staff were extremely friendly and lots of games to play. We had a really great time at this location. We ate the stuffed crust pizza which was delicious with the melting mozzarella in the crust. It wasn't that busy since I went on P.A day. We went again on Friday night night and the arcade was literally amazing. The place was dark and the video games were flashy. The prizes were good and we got a lot of tickets from the arcade. They always add more and more games which makes the place better. They even added one of my favourite games. Big win super spin! We also got a deal at the entrance for buying a cup will get 50 tickets. Keep up the amazing work, Whitby!"}
{"text":"Really great place... only one thing: the animatronic needs huge repairs. It's teeth fell off and it's jaw broke that's all you need! Chuck e saw the tooth fairy"}
{"text":"The service here sucks they don't know how to see how your doing or even help, when they do it's like 30 minutes later! I will not go back to this one any more I will drive to do to one."}
{"text":"Oh noes it closed. Former Showbiz Pizza Place. Housed Rock-afire Explosion then went Concept Unification in the early 90's. The CEC 3-Stage got replaced by a Studio C Alpha in the late 90's/Early 2000's. Now it closed in 2015. RIP West Mesa CEC 1983-2015 :("}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended on the Food Network so I had to check it out. Chuck E Cheese Pizza is the final level of pizza. The pizza is made fresh daily from world renown chefs from Italy. They have innovative ingredients like Pepperoni, Sausage and Extra Cheese. I believe the Cheese comes from God himself or possibly a cow but my instincts tell me that the cheese was created in the Nethworlds or by a powerful wizard. I like being wizards in Role Playing Games. At first they aren't as strong as warriors but when you build your character up, the wizards tend to end up more powerful. If I were a wizard in real life my main ability would be to Conjur Chuck E Cheese pizza. Let's say a Troll group was attacking me, I would just Conjur up 32 Large Pizza's with extra cheese and the Trolls would just start eating the pizza and forget about me. How this place hasn't won any Michelin Stars or James Beard Awards are beyond me. This is fine dining at it's absolute best!"}
{"text":"We went to Chuck E Cheese's for my daughters first birthday with some family. We sat near the stage where Chuckie comes out and dances for the kids. In the same area there were two individuals working whom looked like they were from management. Even though you can tell these two were busy working on what seemed to be paperwork they were attentive to us with out us even asking. One gave my daughter a stuffed animal for her Bday and the other overheard us say we didn't have a lighter to light her \"one\" candle on my daughters cake. He ended up finding one for us. Thank you two for your great customer service we greatly appreciate it!"}
{"text":"Came to this place for a rest stop and to eat. Unfortunately we had pizza the day before and went for nuggets and hotdogs with fries and pasta salad. After ordering plus tokens my bill was $70. The food is all cooked from frozen and it wasn't all that good. Nuggets on the spicy side . I don't know if the pizza is any better. The kids obviously enjoyed the arcades. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I took my daughter here for the first time for her to meet up with some friends and play some games. At first when we walked in I was really impressed with the idea of stamping everyone in your party to ensure no one leaves with the wrong person. So I was a little more comfortable with my kiddo running around with the other kids we were with. Everything while there was fine until we left. When we were leaving there was absolutely no one working the exit to check to see if people were leaving with the correct kids. My husband left with two of the other kiddos and no one bothered to check them, and had they it would have been noticed that they were not the same number. Management should look into tightening up their own security policies."}
{"text":"We had our 6 year old's birthday party here and were extremely pleased with the whole experience.  Kaz was our \"party host\" and she was enthusiastic and attentive, making sure everyone had a great time.  We've been to a lot of birthdays and CEC was probably one of the most well run and engaging for the kids with several songs, ticket \"splashes\", the ticket blowing machine - there was always something going on in between the pizza, cake and games.  Our daughter said it was her favorite birthday ever and several other parents said their kids had a blast.  It was easy on us parents too so that gets 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Yay! Chuck E. Cheese's! This place is what you would expect. A kid's paradise, full of Milves as far as the eye can see, a bunch of crappy games, some skeeball and pizza only a kid could love. Actually, my daughter's Mom loves the pizza, too.  My daughter loves this place. She's 2 1/2 and still a little bit too young to get the full experience but she doesn't care. Its like a huge sensory overload for her and she is always super excited. We can't go to the shopping center in Bridgeville when she's awake or she will see Chuck E. Cheese's big old rat head and start yelling his name.  The pizza is crap. Its basically one step below frozen pizza, which is sad. They do have a salad bar, though...and I eat the salad bar while my DM and little girl eat the pizza. While we had no problem this past Sunday, in the summer, I've seen fruit flies swarming around the salad bar. Also...sometimes the veggies and stuff is less than fresh. But hey, there's a dancing singing rat running around.  There's always coupons in the mail and if you don't get mail, you can go to Chuck E. Cheese's website and print off coupons for them there.  We never had a birthday party there so I'm not sure how good they are. I've worked at a Chuck E. Cheese when I was younger and the one I worked at (in Phoenix) did good shows. I don't know about this one, though.   This one is a bit small and we had alot of difficulty finding open games. The place was totally packed with a line out the door and they were letting everyone come in. If you wanted a table, you needed to be put on a waiting list but they weren't limiting the amount of people coming in. This was completely ridiculous, they really should have limited how many people were inside the building. Not just for the enjoyment factor but also for safety, especially with all the kids. If there was a fire in there, it would turn into a mad house and some kids would get trampled.  Finally, every time we entered or left the building, there were about four or five adults out front chain smoking. For starters, this is illegal...they are required by law to be so many feet away from the door. And secondly, ITS A FREAKING KIDS PLACE! If you can't leave your cigarettes alone for a few hours while your kid or grandkid enjoys themselves in a fun, friendly and safe environment, then stay the hell home.  All in all, we had fun. We did not intend to eat there this time, which was good because we'd have probably had to wait an hour to get our food. We played some games, put our little girl on some rides and won her some prizes."}
{"text":"The pizza is mediocre but it's Chuck E Cheese. I took my grandson for his first time and he a good time. However $50 later and a fistful of tickets there was nothing for him at the toy counter that was age appropriate. I asked the young lady for options and was told I could buy a toy or save the tokens for a later visit.   This wasn't an option my grandson wanted his \"reward\".  It took time but I was able to speak with the manager and explain my disappointment at no age appropriate toys for a 3 year old unless I wanted to buy it. Aubrianna was kind and understanding and worked with me. In the end my grandson has a Chuck E Cheese cup with a straw. Way better then candy or a toy he would choke on.  Something for the corporate Chuck E Cheese world to think about is the need to offer kids toys/rewards, anything, that is age appropriate for the age groups who come to play.  Thanks to Aubrianna for coming through.  She is the only reason for 3 stars."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff. Pizza isnt bad. But blows other pizza places out of the water to have a birthday party!! Alot more games geared to younger kids. My kids love this place compared to Peter Piper. Prizes are horrible still like everywhere else. Kind of weird that you cannot tip the servers. I slipped mine a cash tip anyways because she did such a great job for the birthday party."}
{"text":"Quite enjoyable location for the kids. They have a good selection of games for various ages. The seating area is quite big and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"This is the best place to have my kid's birthday parties.. they love to play, hang out with Chucky and the pizza isn't too bad. Love the fact that all the games are a single token. Makes the money go farther. The staff is typically super nice, even when my kids are crazy!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a negative 10 stars!!!! This place sucks and the manager is disgusting! We were with a party of about 8 or 9 kids mostly latinos and mixed race. The manager comes by the kids and gave the only child who looks Caucasian a glow stick and completely bypasses all the other kids. Made it totally obvious! Then this piece of crap of a person gives all the Caucasian kids in front of us trading in their tickets free little gadgets but as soon as our kids got up there he closed down the prize booth and said he had to closed it for cleaning! Wtf?! I went off and almost had to be escorted out! We will not be back and we will spread the word at how much of a bigot this fat ass ugly premature balding hillbilly of a manager they have running this shit show!"}
{"text":"Went for a birthday party. Place was freekin crazy and packed. Food was good and kids had a good time. It is like a mini Dave and Busters."}
{"text":"This place sucks, like really bad! But, the kids love it and this review is in honor of them. The food is awful! Only half the games work, the other half eat your tokens and doesn't dispense tickets. Chuck E and his friends couldn't be more \"cheesy\", the birthday show is lame as all get out, Chuck E can be terrifying (just ask my near 2 year old), and the prizes are totally lame too. All in all, a great place to bring the kids to give them a great time!   Personally, I believe Peter Piper is way better, only problem is their pizza is actually pretty decent and that coupled with the decent lunch buffet, prepare to defend yourself against an army of seniors looking for a cheap meal and a large place where they can all gather and elbow our darling kids out of they way in their pursuit of the last slice of desert pizza. You don't ever have to worry about crowds or flocks of seniors at good old Chuck E's! When the children are polled and Chuck E is the resounding reply, Chuck E it is!   The way I see it, the kids, they are never able to make too many decisions at this young age, so let us empower them and take them to DINGY Chuck E Cheese's when they request it!"}
{"text":"I had to give them one star because it doesn't let me give zero. But honestly we just had the worst customer service experience ever and when we complained to the manager he didn't even look at me or say a word to me. He just handed me my money back.   Here's what happened, we paid for the salad bar yet there was no salad in there. So we asked one of the workers if she could fill it up and she said \"I'm on it\" 20 minutes later and still no salad. Between those 20 minutes we asked her 2 more times if she could put salad in the salad bar and she said she was busy and she would get to it when she could. After 30 minutes of waiting we asked for our money back and as soon as the manager handed me the money back (without even saying a word to me or looking at me) the girl was putting the salad in the salad bar! Really after 30 minutes of waiting! She couldn't have done that earlier. They took my salad plate and didn't say anything to me.   I would understand if they were extremely busy, but some of the workers were literally standing around doing nothing. And there's no excuse to the treatment we received from them not even acknowledging me or apologizing for the inconvenience. Never coming to this location again."}
{"text":"I am split 50/50 on Chuck E Cheese's here is my breakdown:  Pizza:  I am pretty sure they have the worst tasting pizza that you will ever have....ever! That being said little kids seem to love it. The only reason we ever go to Chuck E Cheese's is for the kids so if they love it, i can force it down.   Games: Their games is what makes it, every game is 1 token that is a huge win! You are defiantly getting the most bang for your buck when it comes to the arcade games.   Safety: They stamp your parties hand when you come in and make sure you have the same stamp when you exit. That way one of you kids do not go running off with another party. We always feel safe having them running around.  Over all: Kids love it that is way we come back!"}
{"text":"This place isn't as bad as some people make it seem, nor is it amazing...at least not the pizza and wings. Ok so let's start with the entertainment, all 3 stars go to strictly towards entertainment because frankly kids looove it here. Celebrated my nephews bday here tonight and they had a blast. The whole cheek E. crew comes out to dance and sing with the kids... Plenty of games, photobooth, & a little playground type of thing. & now let's talk about the Food..... Pizza tastes like cardboard, cold & basic. And the wings I could bet anything that they're the Tyson microwaveable wings you could get at like Walmart... They tasted exactly like them!!!! no kind of freshness to them or flavor. Could've bought way more if u just went with the Walmart route in that case.  Overall I'd say if you want a place where your little ones could go have fun, dance and play then this is the place, if you're interested in strictly food & looking for a place that serves amazing pizza and wings... NOT THE PLACE."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in chuckie cheese! I used to go to one in Simi Valley California growing up and that place was super fun and super huge! I walked into this one and was like \"What the heck?!\" It was so small and could totally pass for a dirtier version of peter piper pizza. Was so disappointed! Not to mention when I ordered a pizza, they seemed to have \"forgotten\" about it and we waited a good hour and a half until I had to ask someone where the heck it was! Pizza was as I remembered though. They need more games for the kids!!!! And more prize selections! Probably wont go back ):"}
{"text":"We've been coming here since my oldest was 4 (or was she 3?). She's 12 now. My youngest is 6 and he wants his 7th birthday here in December.   Clean, reliable fun. Easy way to entertain your kids without moving around much yourself (once your kids are schoolagers).  If you don't want pizza, order the salad bar!  The food was surprisingly fresh and good!  Now they have chicken sandwiches and chicken bites on the menu.  I don't know about all that, I just know I liked the salad bar.  I think it's cool that they offer these other food options for parents.  Keep socks on your kids' feet.  I'm not sure how often they shampoo the carpets.  My kids' socks are usually black on the bottom by the time we leave. This doesn't surpise me.  It's not a knock on their cleanliness at all.  Their bathrooms were in really good condition. Just keep socks on your feet is all.  I can sit.  They can play.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Although, as an adult I cringe at the thought of going to Chuck E. Cheese, especially on a Friday afternoon, but my 3 year old loves it. We don't go often, so I can justify the torture. It was the first time at this location, and I was sadly disappointed. There were a lot of broken machines and not a great selection. There seemed to be an excess of machines with games of chance....roll your coin into a slot, the coin pusher game, etc. I understand the lights suck people in, but my 3 year old doesn't understand how to play those. He just likes sticking his coin into the slot. I found a lot of the machines ate our coins and then no game or there were signs on the machines \"out of order.\"  Like I said, I don't typically enjoy going to Chuck E. Cheese, I'm glad it's there for my kids, but this location was disappointing."}
{"text":"This Chuck E. Cheese is absolutely HORRIBLE. All the negative reviews on here are spot on correct. I have four children who are 9, 6.5, 5 and 3 years old. We have been to this Chuckie's 3 times and every time there were 5 or more games out of order, 3 more that were running but not operating correctly and a couple more that would just eat tokens! The service is slow at best. What little staff that is on hand is usually hiding in the back. When it was time to reward the kids for good behavior, I asked what they wanted to do and their reply was, \"Please no Chuck E. Cheese!\""}
{"text":"Good lord, people, it's Chuck E Cheese, not Picazzo's... I think we all know what to expect from this place.  Who cares what us adults think, our kids think it's a five star joint, and that's super awesome in my book.    The pizza has actually gotten better from recent years, in my opinion.  This location is super clean and updated, the employees are attentive & friendly, and there is a good variety of games & activities.    My daughter wanted to eat her birthday dinner on a Wednesday here & we all had a blast.  It's really what you make of it.  How can you be miserable in Chuck E's presence, anyway?!"}
{"text":"As far as Chuck E Cheeses go, I thought this place was fairly \"clean\" compared to others.  They had hand sanitizers throughout.  Albeit on the small end, the kids had a great time - ages ranging from almost 2 years old to 8 years old.  I would go there again."}
{"text":"We just had my grandson's 5th birthday party here.  We didn't get half the food we paid for.  The cardboard pizza arrived late, no goodie bags, no dip in dots and last but not least, cold wings for desert.  We had to search for our host who apparently hides between games to avoid her customers.  Overall awful experience.  Save your money and rent a bounce house."}
{"text":"I avoid taking my kids to Chuck E Cheese's, even though there is one nearby our home.  However, one of my kids got invited to a birthday party, and she was so excited that I knew I couldn't get out of it.  The birthday party portion of this place is actually very well-run.  Everything was on time, the coordinator was great, it flowed very smoothly.  However, the rest of it really needs some help. I expected it to be busy on a weekend afternoon (had to wait for most of the games), but would also expect that there would be adequate staffing.  There were no employees walking around the floor to fix machines, refill tickets, etc.  Our skee-ball machine was not dispensing tickets.  I went to the front counter to report (remember, no employees around on the floor).  That involved waiting in line for quite awhile behind people trying to purchase food, tokens, etc.  They had one person ringing consistently, with one other person occasionally helping.  I reported the problem, she said she'd be right out to fix it.  In the mean time, at least one other person had the same problem with the same machine and she reported it twice.  It took 15-20 minutes for someone to come out to fix it.  The employee handed the other person (an adult with no kids with her) a huge pile of tickets and a few tokens, while ignoring me and my 4 year old child standing there patiently trying to make eye contact to tell them that we, too, had a problem.  The bathrooms were a disaster- toliet paper dispensers hanging off the wall ready to crash to the ground at any moment.  Debris of one sort of the other in every single stall, and very dirty toliet seats.  The paper towel dispenser was empty.  The prize counter was barely staffed - usually empty with a crowd of kids waiting.  Aside from the birthday party staff (which was very good) and food runners, I counted at total of only four other employees serving as cashier/machine fixer/salad bar fillers/prize counter.  My daughter enjoyed herself, which is important (as did the birthday kid!), but I will not return here on my own with my kids.  There are plenty of other fun places to go for young kids."}
{"text":"Only played games with my 3.5 year old. She had a great time. All games were working. They seemed to be understaffed for the amount of people were there on a Sunday with multiple birthday parties"}
{"text":"We had to clean our own table. The tray they gave us was wet and sticky. There was no soap left on the bathroom, and there was a literal pile of garbage on the floor. The pizza took over an hour, was immediately cold. Our kids got about a dozen tickets because at least half the machines were out. The soda machines were covered in dry syrup.  This is probably the most poorly managed place I've ever encountered. Multiple employees just standing around and shrugging at guests. Maybe they are planning on closing it soon? It's all I can guess from our visit."}
{"text":"AT $0.15/token, who could complain.  The kids get to have fun and the adults get to spend $20 on a $5 toy they could've bought.  Just don't eat their food."}
{"text":"My kids loves this place they really enjoy being here. Happy babies happy mommy ;) there aren't many places for kids here in Arizona and during the summer the heat is very bad to go to the parks, so this place is a very nice and cool and kids are actively playing."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but I felt this one was necessary. The staff always looks miserable here and does not engage with the kids. The pizza is pretty bad and the service is below mediocre. Chuckie rarely comes out and when he does he is not there for long so half the kids don't get any interaction and feel left out. They took away the little kids slide so toddlers have nothing to play on since they can't go up the big slide. A quarter of the games are broken and eat your tokens.  Most don't give tickets. If you mention this to the staff they just say ok but don't put up a sign and continue on their way. If the staff was more engaged, the games were maintained and their was a toddlers slide/play area my rating would be much higher. The kids generally have a good time because they are easy going and ignore all the nonsense adults get irritated about. We work hard for our money and want to come somewhere where our kids will have a good time. You don't want to feel \"eh\" when you leave. The manager needs to hire the right people and keep them engaged in the customer experience."}
{"text":"don't eat here unless you want to get sick. I took my son here and the same man who gives you your tokens, also gives you your plate (with out washing his hands) they put the order number sign on your plate as well. I ignored this and tried to the make the best because I love the hand stamp feature and the 25 cent for all games.   Our pizza came out and it tasted like water from the fountain with out lemon, it had this really weird taste. maybe it was the sauce mixed with sink water. the cheese was good so we ate the top of the pizza.    Games broke. picture taking one was out of paper! the car picture didn't work but took tokens. the car game by the front shut off while playing. just really bad service.   the hand stamp is why I loved going here, great security feature and the 25 cent per game is really fun and ideal.     salad bar was not clean. straw holder has dust   over 40.00 for pizza with my boy and besides spending time with my son, it was a total waste of money and it hurt my stomach. had to be the pizza or germs!  two stars."}
{"text":"Came on Halloween after trick or treating, asked the girl working the door what time they close she said 9. It was 8:40 so I thought ok I'll just get some tokens for my son so he can play some games real quick. I walk in and they announce that they will close in one hour!!! So I order food get tokens and begin to play some games, hardly anything worked and what did didn't have tickets in it!!! Food took 40 minutes and there was only 15 people max in the entire place. Absolutely awful experience. Oh I almost forgot, when it was time for the rat to dance he no showed, stay classy chuck."}
{"text":"Freaking awesome experience! Excellent customer service, how can you beat this place? Pm manager Kelly made sure we enjoyed everything, def recommend, took my 14 year old, 10 year old, and a 3 year old, was something for everyone. Super fresh salad, pizza was so much better then I remember it being years ago. Why are you not bringing your family here already? Seriously, really had a great time. Rianna vilaire."}
{"text":"Went here for my Granddaughters 3rd birthday - she was scared of the mouse lol Chucky I guess lol - pizza and pop to our tables and she won tons of coupons for toys at the end Her papa (52) celebration of life was the day before and allowed all of us to forget for some time .... thank you for letting us all be big kids for a day"}
{"text":"Very clean, everyone was so friendly and I felt very comfortable having my 18 month old running around playing with everything"}
{"text":"Nothing like waiting an hour and a half for pizza...that has still not been delivered. We were told our pizzas were delivered to another table, pretty odd since they give you a number to keep on your table. Half the games don't work but there is no \"out of order\" sign on any of them. I don't enjoy throwing money down the drain so I won't be back."}
{"text":"My kids love this place and it's a great deal for tokens if you have a coupon. Otherwise, it is way overpriced.   My take... food is pretty bad, wings are well, let me put it this way, imagine you microwave a handful of Dyno-bites chicken nuggets, toss it in some sauce and try to pass that as boneless wings...yeah, that bad. Everytime we go, I swear it's the last time.  The machines work about half the time, whether they are out of tickets, swallow tokens, etc.  Trying to find an employee to fix it, is next to impossible, by the time they show up, kids have forgotten about it so their tickets are lost and so is the token.   The hand stamping at the entrance is a double edge sword. On one side, kids can't leave, but on the other... parents DO!  This last time we went, there were these kids basically stealing tickets, tokens, etc from other kids, climbing on the equipment (cheating), they were told I don't know how many times to stop.  Myself and another parent got fed up with these little punks, frustrated unable to find these kids parents... We complained about it, we were told... \"oh yeah, those kids have been here for a while, they won't stop or listen, I think they were dropped off\", so, why don't you call the cops??? You can't just drop off your kids and leave!    I wouldn't say it's \"dirty\" in the sense of being neglected.  That is one thing I do see, is somewhere always walking around wiping things down, but still doesn't fix the fact some people are just gross, walking around with food and greasy hands, leaving it everywhere sometimes it falls in the games... kids walking around with food in their mouths (taking big bites and realize it's too big of a bite while playing a game and spitting out), again, comes down to lack of oversight by parents...    Employees are polite and patient (you have to be to work here), I would say is bad customers who ruin the experience... One group of them is enough to ruin many other family's experience.  Maybe asking people causing trouble to leave??? I mean they do it in bars and restaurants, why not a kids play place??? Just a thought."}
{"text":"Did you know Chuck E. Cheese has AWESOME PIZZA?!??? Went here a few weeks ago with Marie B. and Melissa B. AND yes with kids too... we all had a blast.   But what I remember the most from this Chuck E. Cheese fun day is the PIZZA! Oh... and Deal or No Deal.  I'm coming back here with a bunch of adults and no kids so we can stuff our faces with pizza and hog the Deal or No Deal video game. Hahahaha! Besides, I'm shorter than most kids. So I'll fit in just fine."}
{"text":"Yes kids love chuck e cheese but the food is disgusting... I will only take my kids to play with games but I will not buy anything other then bottle of water"}
{"text":"We visited this Chuck E. Cheese for my sisters 7th birthday. Overall, it was a good experience. The people who work there were super friendly, seemed to really enjoy kids, were interactive. The pizza and veggie tray was alright, not great, but definitely edible. In addition, the price was right.  While many people have Birthday parties on the weekend, having it on Friday is actually an excellent idea. We were the only birthday party which was very nice as the kids got to spread out and no one felt claustrophobic. It was busy enough where there were other kids, but not overcrowded."}
{"text":"We were greeted with a smile by Anna. The games work so far for the kids, I am pleased. I am unhappy with the beverage service provided by the manager Tiffany. She was completely unfriendly. She was unable to describe what a \"blackberry shandy\" was and when asked to provide a small taste she flat out refused. The restaurant is not busy but several tables are dirty. I am happy to have this option for the kids on a rainy day. And happy they have beer. But I appreciate smiles and clean tables hence the lukewarm review."}
{"text":"This review is for the games only. We did not eat here.  The games are dated and filthy. It was overcrowded and just about every other game was out of order or just ate our tokens. It was incredibly loud and my little girl was overwhelmed by everything going on.   Each machine or ride takes one token which can get pretty expensive because it breaks down to 33 cents a token.   Peter Piper Pizza or the Carousel Arcade in Scottsdale are much cleaner. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to play, not to eat. For children 4 and under, this place is great. You and your child get a matching security stamp so that only you can leave with them. I really liked that.   The games are geared towards smaller children which is great. We took our son to Peter Piper Pizza, but it was much more rowdy, and really no games for toddlers. This was much better and age appropriate. Also, the games are only a quarter each.   Unfortunately, the pizza is overpriced and really not very good. The kids will eat it without a problem, but that's only because they don't know better. Its edible, but not enjoyable.   I'm sure we will be back for the kids, but I really wish they would put a little more attention to the food."}
{"text":"Download the free app \"Skate Universe\" to earn up to 1000 free tickets sent instantly to your email. Its works, and its much faster to get then playing games lol"}
{"text":"My kids love this place, just as much as I hate it. The food is worthless cardboard pizza. I spend to much money on ticket games. They need to step it up and actually get video games instead of token games. My wife claims the salad bar has given her food poisoning twice. Yet we keep coming back cause the kids love it. The stupid things we do for those that we love."}
{"text":"Great spot for kids and families to get out of the heat.  I like how they stamp the kids and families with the same numbers, but just a peice of advice if your going to do that as a security feature you should probably use it and check them when people are leaving. Disappointing.   They have an all you can eat pizza and salad buffet. The salad is pretty weak, its just mixed greens with a couple choices of salad dressing. The pizza buffet consists of 3-4 pizza options. Its OK for what it is...  Games galore for all ages. Not as many games as some other chuck e cheese's but definitely enough to keep the kiddos entertained.  When we were there it was a challenge finding a clean table. We got there around 12 so they hadn't been open too long so how that many tables were already dirty is beyond me."}
{"text":"Why can't my daughter beg to go to Peter Piper Pizza?  I wouldn't like Chuck E Cheese even if the staff was friendly, the food was good, and the games actually worked.  But if all of those were true, I would at least give it a higher star rating. But seeing as how each of those categories were a disastrous mess, I am confident in giving the one star rating.  I am all about rewarding my daughter when she does well. She has been doing splendidly getting ready for her first day of school and I wanted to take her anywhere she wanted to go to let her know we appreciate her hard work. When she wanted to go to Chuck E Cheese, I felt the low grumbling sigh emerging.  I do have to give credit to the idea of stamping the family with identical infrared markings to deter those who wish to impose ill will on our little ones. But that is about the end of the good will I will project to the staff. If you are hungry or thirsty and want something quickly, then be prepared to wait. I timed my wait for a simple drink; it ran about 4:15. I don't know if it is short staffing or paying slave wages to high schoolers who simply don't care. Either way, the combination they have just isn't working.  The only thing worse than the slow service to get your food is the food itself. It is horrible. I don't know any other descriptors to really describe cheap cheese layered on tomato paste that is all resting on what amounts to pressed together Wonder Bread. I would describe the wings but I don't technically ever want to call them wings because that is an insult to all other wings created. Ever. I referenced Peter Piper earlier and even though Peter Piper's pizza isn't exactly gourmet, it blows this pizza clean out of the water. No comparison. I can't talk about their food any more, it makes my stomach sad.  The coux de gras is the games. If it all came down to just going in to play some games with the family, then you will again be completely disappointed. Almost half of the games either didn't work or would eat your tokens without actually working. It was simply just sad. The games that did work were about as badly maintained as any I have ever seen. I actually felt bad for my family at one point because what was supposed to be an eventful afternoon turned into a pitiful experience."}
{"text":"Birthday Ruined. A hand full of the machines were turned offs Many of the machines would take coins and not work. If they did work, they didn't give tickets. At the end at ticket counter machine, it only counted half of the tickets put in. The manager said it happens all the time and didn't even to give us a voucher for the correct amount. And it's not just the machines that made the experience bad, everyone that worked there acted like they didn't know what was going on, and they had to redo our food order twice because they kept getting it wrong. Get it together Chuck E."}
{"text":"My 3 year old daughter loves it and since she's the reason we go then I guess that's all that matters. But, their customer service could really use an upgrade. They always seem to be understaffed & there had not been one time that we've visited that we haven't had to wait at least 5 minutes for someone to come to the counter to take our order. Tonight we visited and we waited for 10. When you have an excited toddler who wants to play games right away that wait can be horrible. Also, there are times when Chuck E doesn't make an appearance, even when it's announced that he'll be out."}
{"text":"I like to let Chuck E. Cheese take the fuss out of birthdays and they've been doing so for year. Now we've tried Ci Ci's Pizza and we've gone bowling too, but as a family we always find ourselves back at Chuck E. Cheese.    The vast majority of my siblings were born during cold and flu season so when I saw a Chuck E  Cheese employee wiping down games after use I was both oddly impressed and thankful.   Chuck E Cheese for years have been offering great indoor fun for my little bro whose  birthday is in December.  With options for out door activities far and few between in the winter months I am beyond thrilled to have such an excellent Chuck E Cheese so near to home.   My only disappointment is that there is no longer all ball pit and the tubes that the kids can climb through have been reduced. Everything else from the selection of games, food and entertainment are up to my high standards for family fun."}
{"text":"If you have young kids under 10, this is paradise for them. If you have kids who are all grown up, make sure you take a Tylenol or Advil :)  Kids just have a blast here. We have a joke amongst friends that the casino Indian subsidizes CeC, as they train future gamblers. Seriously kids get hooked on to those tickets (meaningless) and go nuts over collecting them in the hope they can \"buy\" a gift. The kids hope they will hit a jackpot for a huge payout. You know where this story goes, right?  The pizza is OK. Weekday lunch for $9 isn't that bad for an OK pizza. The service is good. A perfect spot for a kids birthday party. And yes, I believe they don't sell tea/coffee, but do sell beer - go figure. So if you need one, and you will need one, walk in with one."}
{"text":"Pizza: Actually a lot better than I expected. I would eat it again for sure.  Staff: Everyone was nice and looked busy most of the time. Seemed to care about the quality of there work.  Arcade games: Everything is one token, that is kinda crazy. Most of the games functioned well, they were super generous on tickets. My kids loved that part. Deal or No Deal was pretty entertaining.  For under $40 we got a pizza, four drinks,100 tokens, and had a good time. That is very inexpensive entertainment in my opinion.  I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"If there was one Chuck E Cheese's that I had to name my favourite it would be this one. The true pinnacle of child entertainment. I could drop my two kids off and leave forever and they probably wouldn't notice! haha! However there was one child named Hayden that was harassing my son. The staff wouldn't do anything about him so I took matters into my own hands by LIGHTLY tossing him into the ball pit. Unfortunately I was asked to leave. It would be five stars if Chuck E Cheese had a stronger, anti-nuisance security squad to teach some kids a lesson."}
{"text":"Had never been to Chuck E. Cheese & never will go back. Horrible customer service from the start! When I saw people that got there after us getting their order before us I got up to check on the order. There were a lot of employees standing around laughing & talking but no one seemed to bother asking what I needed. I went up to the girl that was stamping everyone to get it & asked who I could ask to check on an order. She pointed to the same kids laughing & talking. So I politely asked if someone could check on an order, one of the girls (first name started w a Z) turned around & told the girl \"go tell someone else, i need you to come back so I can train you.\" I was furious. It would take you TWO minutes to check on an order. Finally someone giggling said they'll check & 10 minutes later we got our food. It took more than an hour & a half to get our food. NEVER GOING BACK. the manager seems so careless too. So it's not like we got anywhere when we mentioned it to him."}
{"text":"About 40% of games broken, this location used to be fun now u gamble when u put a quarter in any machine. Good luck. If it was not for my daughter I would never set foot inside this place. I would rather pay 20 dollars for games at Peter Pipper and atleast ALL the game will work. Thumbs down. I guess the creator of Chucky Cheese does not care if its franchise drowns."}
{"text":"This chuck e cheese had the mouse come out and dance with the kids. My kids liked it and had a good time here.  The bad: it's super dirty. Tables were dirty with food and no one bothered to clean them the whole time we were there- they remained dirty. There were very obnoxious  kids playing tag and running wild through the place, that no one did anything about. Some kids were crawling inside the machines to cheat (ski ball and basket ball) and no one cared. There was no diet coke in the machines. Also some of the machines were out of order. Will hope my kids don't beg me to come here again. I will have to bribe them with toys r us, and everything else on the way first before coming here again."}
{"text":"They burned our pizza and still tried to give it to us. We told her it was burned and she said sorry and got us another one. My 3 year old had fun. This place is for the younger children around his age."}
{"text":"You people giving one star reviews for the pizza, are you kidding? This place is not for you, it is for YOUR KIDS.... The pizza is dry, the prizes are terrible, the price is high, its a great Chuck E Cheese's. We come here often for play dates with families in our group and always leave happy."}
{"text":"Although, We got pretty lucky today on a rainy day, because  it's not too busy on a Tuesday, summer day, and the kids are having fun. The place is fairly clean chicly made the appearance and the staff are 'approachable' also, at first glance the salad bar seemed impressive... Well  at first!!! I was very disappointed when I saw that the cucumbers in my plate were completely covered in slime, I had kindly asked them to replace the container with fresh ones, And then went ahead and attempted to make myself another plate of salad, I was looking forward to finally having my late lunch! And my first bite made me GAG!! Everything on my plate was rotten including the dressing. Literally, tasted mouldy rotten!THey seemed only slightly surprised , and gave me a refund. Yey! (Not really)  That was when, I was happy to learn about their gluten-free cheese pizza. It's very tiny, smaller than the personal but only cost me $5.99. It was edible and not bad. With a tiny souvenir... But I still feel hungry and really wish I could have the all you can eat salad :(  that's why I can't rate this place any higher then 3 stars! Rotten food! Is a big no no!!! Especially in a kids place!!! Although I love the fact that the kids can move around freely and safely and I know no one can grab them and they can't walk out of here with out us, thanks to the stamp Process and always someone at the door!"}
{"text":"Disappointing to say the least. Spent a good chunk of change to have my sons 5th birthday party here and the experience was just disappointing.   The excuse given to me was that there was another party of 70 guests going on, and that's why we were neglected the entire 2 hours of our time. Funny, the table next to us had a blast, their hostess was visible the whole time and had their food in ample time.   It took over an hour to receive our cups for drinks, an hour for our pizzas, and then didn't even receive one whole pizza or our wing platter so had to speak with a manager. 20 minutes later the wings arrive and felt like they were just removed from the freezer.   Didn't receive a majority of the items I had paid for in regards to my son being the birthday boy, yet still got charged.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's slowly getting worse. Games not giving the right amount of coupons. Or they take your tokens. Photo ride didn't print the picture. Happened to be the first time my son would ride the photo ride, got no photo. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Had a birthday party for my daughter at Chuck E Cheese in Mississauga (Dixie Road) on September 13th, 2015.  Our hostess was excellent, and made the experience enjoyable and hassle free.  Perhaps we were lucky because we were the only birthday party taking place at that time.  The food was good and the service was excellent.  All the kids had a great time.  We were given a lot of extra tokens for booking online and on a Sunday.  While the event wasn't cheap, it was worth it for the kids."}
{"text":"The parties are a joke. The hosting staff are not energetic, helpful, nor really hosting much.  They really need to put more effort into hiring and training party hostess staff if they're going to charge 12 to 16 bucks a kid. Of course my kids had a blast but that was on their own enjoying the games and playground. I had to serve the Pizza, cut and serve the cake myself and NOTHING was run in a timely organized manner. In fact the host was 20 minutes late to work and the poor kid had no idea how to conduct a party or interact with little kids. The hostess conducting the party seamed even less enthusiastic to be there so...BASICALLY as a mom, this was my first time not doing a party at home and I was INCREDIBLY DISSAPOINTED IN THEIR PARTY ON ALL LEVELS!!! AND IM PRETTY EASY GOING! It almost made me feel emberassed like I wasn't doing a good job when I should of been enjoing my daughter's 5th bday and they were the ones not doing a good job...and chuck e the character sucked!!  The pizza is okay. The place was clean but next time I'm going to just go somewhere else or simply buy pizzas and conduct our own party! On top of that a lot of games didn't work and their prizes are terrible!"}
{"text":"We were there for a party this last saturday afternoon and saw something that really pissed me off. about 5 black children were playing on the stage with the animatronic chuck e when an older employee barked at them to get off the stage in front of a man taking pictures who I believe was the father. the kids got down and went and did what kids do at chuck e cheese and the employee walked thru a door about 10 feet to the right of the stage. less than 10 minutes later about the same amount of children maybe a little older and white were doing the same thing up on the stage with robo-chucky. the same employee walked in their direction, looked at them, paused and then walked thru the same door without saying anything. I get why he kicked the first group off the stage. I was thinking to myself that the man that was with them needed to get them off the stage. why not the 2nd group? I'm knee deep in the difference between boys and girls with my 6 year old. I'm not prepared to cover privilege at this time on our liveS."}
{"text":"Went today for the lunch buffet I have been getting emails about. Was very disappointed by it. The salad bar is nothing like it used to be. All they have out is lettuce and 4 different dressing options. Very disappointed. Pizza also seems very poor quality. It seems they have decided to cut costs by offering this pizza and salad bar but I will never go back!!! I will go to Peter piper pizza like I usually do for the buffet and kids to play. Way better pizza and salad options there.  Also they have changed their play area, no longer having the toddler section with the little baby slide. I enjoyed that area so baby could play in a confined space and I could watch. Now it's all open and of course can't just relax and watch."}
{"text":"I rate it three because it took so much time to get in and if you want to buy something you should wait for long time. Workers so slow. Rather than that games are good. Food it is not bad."}
{"text":"Hellooooooo . . . .. . . 1995 called and wants this Chuck E Cheese back. Entertainment is via 11 CRT tube TV monitors and one faded 1st generation flat screen TV monitor. The video loop is loaded with kid versions of rap music (gag). The most up-to-date monitor had a Windows XP logo floating on it the whole time we were there.  I had visited this establishment several times when my kids were small in the 1980s and early 1990s and I was shocked to see that many of the rides and games are still the same ones my 30 something daughters had used when they were small. They were all new to my 2 year grandson, so he seemed happy with these ancient rides and games. An employee dressed as the Chuckster came out for about 5 minutes and made a real impression on the 2 year old as they \"high fived.\"  Now for the food: If Organ Stop serves a 3 star pizza, and Peter Piper serves a 2 star pizza, Chuck E Cheese serves a 1 star pizza. Soda, iced tea, or a juice box is all they had to drink. My daughter had a salad, said it was OK, nothing special.  Staff: It looked like only 2 employees were working, which is probably about right for a weekday lunch time since only 3 families were in the restaurant the whole time we were there. Clueless alert--my daughter asked the person behind the food counter if the iced tea was fresh brewed, and he pulled out a jug and pointed to the label on the jug that said \"Lipton's fresh brewed\" and proudly answered, \"Yes, it is fresh brewed!\" She said it tasted wretched.  Parking is close to the door. The restaurant appears clean. Seating is a mix of tables and chair and booths. Two drinks, one very small awful pizza with one topping, and one salad came to $20 plus another $5 for tokens for the rides and games."}
{"text":"This was a nice location.  I went here for a birthday party and they had a lot of nice adds like a tube that the birthday kid got to go in where they had to try to grab tickets that were swirling around them.  Also, the tvs and music were fun for the kids to watch and try to imitate the dance moves.  Chuck E. still comes out and meets the birthday kid and gives them a crown to wear.  Other than that, it's the same food, same games as any other location.  I would go here again."}
{"text":"When you don't want to deal with Peter Piper... You drive your kids 30 minutes down Litchfield and come to Chucks. Added bonus - free tokens for military. I didn't have my ID on me, but I did have my dog tag, and that was good enough. We didn't get a police discount - not that it mattered, but once we saw the military token offer we figured we'd shoot for the gold and ask that too! Score one for Mommy minus one for Officer Bill!    Games were clean and worked. Tubes were clean which is nice. Tables were clean. Bathrooms were clean. Basically it was clean all around. I like that each game takes only 1 token. Prizes are good for the kids. Something for everyone no matter how many or less tickets they earn. (Collin 600 - Chase 44)   It was a bit $$ even with a coupon. Which you can show from your phone. So google coupons before you go in. It was $55 for 2 lg pizzas, 5 drinks and 120 tokens."}
{"text":"I went to Chuck E Chesse's recently only for the pizza because I remember Chuck E Cheese's pizza from when I was a kid and it was really good!  Unfortunately, that is all over.  Their pizza is priced like gourmet pizza (very expensive!!!) and I'm pretty sure its just frozen pizza.    Their pizza is not good at all.  If it was half the price it is now my rating would still only be 2.  Their pizza would get a 3 if it was 1/4 the price it is now but nothing can bring their rating above that.  Too bad because Chuck E Cheese's used to be a good place with good food even if it was 25 years ago."}
{"text":"Had to love the sign for WE NEVER CHARGE FOR ENTRY, and being spat out to the area where you order food and buy tokens.    A bit rich for what it was, but my son loved the place.    The ticket payout -- LOL.   As always, a bit of a joke.   But again, my son was happy.    Worth going to - just bring your wallet."}
{"text":"You don't go here for the food, you go here because it gives the kids something to do inside.  I love to come on a weekday, first thing in the morning with a good book. I order pizza and let the kids play while I read. Perfect for the last days of summer when its 115* out."}
{"text":"Well after about 15 minutes of calling them and they not answering, finally someone picks up and tells me they don't do to go orders over the phone. Are you serious?! I work right next door and I can't order a sandwich to go? No wonder I've never seen anyone eating here."}
{"text":"An absolute rip off. Half the games don't work and the staff don't give a shit to help. It's packed, people push and shove, steal games and tickets. If the games worked it wouldn't be AS bad but I don't know how they get away with this.  Oh and I ordered a drink and it never came after asking 3 individual employees about it.   Never coming back"}
{"text":"I came here to bring my daughter, ordered some pizza and was looking around for a place to sit, all the tables were dirty, not one empty booth I approach a worker there and he says he would get one cleaned he dissapeared and never came back so we basically had to clean up a table to sit on,   the salad bar was dirty watered down ranch so we tell a girl to please bring us new one she just rolls her eyes and brings it, then of course we say thank you she says nothing and walks off with an attitude, a lot of rude young workers that must hate their job. I hadn't came to Chuck E Cheese in a while definitely not coming back!"}
{"text":"6 games were down for the count and the salt and pepper shakers were filthy. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I hate this place and I don't like to use the word \"hate\". It's a crime what they charge for pizza in comparison to what you get, it's awful and they should be ashamed to serve it. Many of the games were not working, the place was disgustingly dirty and the staff all seemed like they hated the place as much as I do. Whenever one of my kids gets invited to a birthday party at Chuck E Cheese's I cringe, I'd rather shoot myself in the foot with a .22 than go back to this rip-off..."}
{"text":"Had my sons party there this past weekend and the hostess service was beyond poor to say the least. After asking to speak with the manger she u desktops my frustration and went to get the Store GM Steve who was just as useless And has even no apologies or even anything to say about his lack of staffs help during the party. Your much better off spending the money at Peter piper there much more attentive, pizza is 2000xs better, they sell booze, and they have updated Games. Even Chuck E sucked and barely interacted with the birthday kids. For spending over 250$ for a party it's not worth it. The only reason they are getting 2 stars is because I like the store manager she did try and make things better for one, my son didn't notice how's crappy the party really was Cuz he's a kid and two games there are only one token other than this the place is outdated and blows!!"}
{"text":"Just did my 2nd birthday party here in a year and I don't think we will be going back. They overbooked birthday parties for our day... when I booked it was wide open. The entire area was so loaded and crowded it was hard to move around. Our table was not given the display for birthday announcement. Our party attendant was very nice and helpful for what she could take care of. We got an appetizer finally after everyone was finished eating - AFTER our attendant had to go into the kitchen and cook herself, because they were short staffed. Many of the games were not working, or stealing coins. A game CAUGHT ON FIRE while we were in there, the entire place filled with burnt smoking rubber smell, no one assured us things were okay, not to worry, I had to grab the manager by the arm as he ran by to ask what was going on. He said a game caught on fire, but he unplugged it and it was still on fire and smoking!? An announcement should have been made or something. Not very safe. When prompted to pay for my bill I had to stand in a very long slow line to pay a $200 bill because they were short staffed. Our party was scheduled from 11-1, around 1 when things were finishing up I asked if the table was needed by another group... 2 different people assured me the table was not needed until 4pm. About 10 minutes later while Im in the middle of video taping my kids dancing with Chuckee another employee came up and interrupted my video to insist we move off of our table. I let them know we got permission to stay already that another party wasn't coming until 4. They continued to argue with me, where I finally stated \"I am in the middle of doing this video, ill move when I am finished!\".  We left at 4pm because we bought lots of extra tokens and food..... there were 6 tables OPEN and NOT USED, including the table we were on! Manager is supposed to come check in with each party on service, 2nd party there and no one checked in again. I will be calling in to customer relations tomorrow. If I'm spending over $200 for a birthday package, I shouldn't be rudely kicked off my damn table for no reason or have to smell burning rubber the whole time."}
{"text":"Really impressed with this location!   Very clean & friendly staff.  My kids had a blast with the variety of games & rides.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"My sister had my nephews birthday party here and was told over the phone the had no tables available. We went in hoping we could get enough tables. No need-the Manager Aaron was on top of it. He got us a birthday table up front. He was very helpful and accommodating! He saw our hands full bringing in presents and had the door open for us before we even got to it. We never felt rushed that they needed the table for the next party or anything. Was a wonderful experience and great customer service by everyone especially Aaron!! We all appreciated it!!"}
{"text":"This chuck e cheese sucks. I brought my family here Saturday night. I understand it's a busy time, but the restaurant should be prepared for the weekend. It's dirty, 50% of the games don't work, we ordered a pizza and after an HOUR and my kids being hungry I went to see what happened. After 10 minutes of waiting for the employee to check on my order, she advised me they didn't make it. It would be a little longer. We will never come to this location again. I would rather drive out of my way to a place where they know what they're doing. I will also be writing corporate about this."}
{"text":".overpriced food .bad games .some irresponsible and ignorant parents  .dirty and unsanitary .Workers that aren't good at their job"}
{"text":"I always look forward to bringing the family here even throu the sticky floors and the messy tables the employees always seem to have a smile on their face!!! thou they can never get my order right my kids always have a blast so I deal with the sticky floors and messy tables only because this place brings smiles to my kids faces!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment #Chuck E Cheese in Good Year, AZ was for our little birthday party. With the choices available these days be sure to avoid this #Chuck E Cheese managed by John Riley.  My family came here to celebrate my 7 year old grand daughter's birthday. 10 people and $120+ later and with a near empty restaurant (see photos), manager John Riley decided that my 7 year old granddaughter could not use the ticket wind-tunnel because we didn't jump through the right hoops.  Manager, John Riley, said it was something about scheduling a party or some other kind of corporate policy with which we didn't comply and over which he (as manager!) had no power.  I apologized for my ignorance of the correct #Chuck E Cheese protocol, pulled out a credit card and ask manager John Riley what the extra charge would be to utilize the empty wind-tunnel (see photo). Riley said that it couldn't be done. The wind tunnel HAD to sit unused no matter what any of us did.  Riley said that \"they\" had done some talking about utilizing this big, expensive piece of unused gear, but nothing had been \"decided.\"   Well, you keep thinking about it manager John Riley and other #Chuck E Cheese stuffed shirts, but we'll not be back to #Chuck E Cheese in Goodyear, AZ.   And if you're looking for more than a birthday party dictated by more than blind, mindless corporate policies, I'd suggest you avoid #Chuck E Cheese in Goodyear, AZ too!"}
{"text":"Pros: clean facilities including bathroom and all the toddler games and rides worked with zero issues.   Cons: cigarette butts all over outside and absolutely rude employees including management. Chuck E came out on time each time and seemed to interact well with children and staff would stand back with arms folded just staring off, when it was time to give tickets they threw them at the ceiling tiles directly above Chuck E. Cheese so that most of the older kids who ran forward were the ones who got the majority. Staff looks absolutely miserable to be working there and have no enthusiasm considering it's a children's place."}
{"text":"Love it here!!! Alexandra was AMAZING !!!! She was super sweet and greeted us with a smile and excellent service !!! The games are super fun for my toddler and the rest of the staff was so friendly. Best Chuck E. Cheese I've been to."}
{"text":"I took my niece here last year whenever she was 3. She enjoyed the games but i'm sad that there isn't a lot of space to climb around in. There's one tunnel and it's not too big. I'm only saying this because I grew up at Safari Sam's (Rest in Peace!!) which was the most AMAZING place EVERRRR for a child. Its ok though.  One plus is that the games are kind of separate. There is an area for smaller children's games and then more games for older children. They seemed to have a decent price on food but we did not eat here. Also, they serve draft beer.   In the back, they have room for parties as well as a stage for Chuckie. My niece was literally terrified of him. She screamed bloody murder and we had to run out of the door to avoid the stares.  Also, another plus is that you get an invisible stamp for every person in your party. I'm assuming every group has a different design or color of some sort. When you leave, someone checks the stamps under a black light to make sure no one left with a kid that is not theirs."}
{"text":"Had my son's birthday party here. They were pretty accommodating and helpful and helped make the party a success. The kids had a blast and the food was surprisingly decent.... or atleast edible."}
{"text":"I'm used to gong to the east end one mostly for birthday parties.  This one was good.  Kiddo had fun ~ I always knew tokens were expensive but wow!  3 adults & 2 kids, having lunch (pizza) and tokens was about $80.  I guess it's fine if you include food.  Unfortunately for me, my kiddo is spend-y and likes to drop coins into the slots and walk away.  Ha ha ha.  As is life with children.  The pizza did take an extraordinarily long time to come - 45 minutes!  Lucky it wasn't a week day or they would have had to pony up a free dessert, says their signage.  The kids have fun, and this location still has the big climbing apparatus with a slide.  Needless to say, I get daily requests to return to Chuck E Cheese."}
{"text":"This location is one of two things for customers  1. Welcome to the old school Chuck E Cheese we grew up with in the 90's or  2. This place needs to be revamped and remodeled.  Seems like corporate simply just forgot about this location and doesn't want to do much about upgrading the games or furniture around the restaurant. The game section is over crowded to say the least and much of the space which can be available is taken up by the party tables.  One does not go to Chuck E Cheese for the food but more to entertain the children so please do a better job of keeping up to date with your games and remodel the place already."}
{"text":"I haven't been to chuck's in years and the pizza taste exactly the same. Delicious! Haha. I wish they would make the decision to do delivery or allow for pick up. This location was a little smaller than I thought it was going to be. They were pretty busy today & all the staff looked high school young but I was very pleased with the service. My nephew & I had a great time."}
{"text":"Had my daughters birthday party here and I will never return. Horrible party host and she didn't even get anything we asked !!!! My party guest was upset and made me look bad !"}
{"text":"Disgusting!!! I don't know why this location remains open.  I brought my daughter here during vacation and must say it's absolutely Filthy.  Besides the filth, the games and rides are either broken down or literally 10-15 years old.  I have no idea how chuckee cheese corporate allows this location to stay open.  If you want people to come, you need to invest in your operation. Start investing!!!!"}
{"text":"Crap place. We came here after a weekend trip for our son's 2nd birthday. He enjoyed all the games and had fun. I mean, he's 2, he won't noticed how we were being served, of course. I ordered food for my family, 1 pizza, some wings, some cheesy bread, fries and hot wings. Food took almost an hour to come out. Wings were not hot, they were bbq. Cheesy bread was really greasy for some reason. Fries were obviously from a frozen bag, undercooked, and was not completely drained of oil. Pizza was actually good. Probably 4 girls worked that night. The greeter, who was completely uninterested in her job. Did she even welcome us? She pretty much stood at the entrance the entire night when the other girls needed help. Girl running cashier and orders was pleasant. She tried hard to make our stay okay but she can only do so much, I guess. Third girl looked like she was running prize booth, running tables, running Chuck E costume but again, uninterested in her job. 4 person was probably the cook? I didn't see her much. Everything was pretty much chaos when it came to the service. Maybe I shouldn't complain cause this place is not for adults and kids don't know anything about service yet... but damn..."}
{"text":"Other than the food it's a cool spot for me and my daughter to hang out,didn't have any problems with any of the games. My daughter loves it so I love it. 4 stars because my daughter have fun every time we go."}
{"text":"In all fairness, this review comes from my 9 year old who can't believe that grown ups are allowed to review this place and give it so few stars. In his words \"Good games, good food and good prizes.\"  As someone who pretends to be a grownup myself, I I'm going to say somewhere between 3 and 4 stars *for a Chuck E Cheeses*. Service was prompt and polite, bathrooms were relatively clean, the food was about average. Chuck E made an appearance to a birthday party, but I don't think he ventured out to the rest of us. Most of the ticket redeemer a were down, but it wasn't too busy and so no line. I'm sure I'll be back here again because, ya know, I've got kids."}
{"text":"My son loves it here...for the games and air hockey. If you are looking for great pizza this is NOT the place. Most kids however are not that finicky when it comes to pizza. The plus side is that  it does serve beer."}
{"text":"Honestly, if you tried to tell me that I would be writing a positive review for Chuck E Cheese 3 years ago, I would have told you- you were nuts! Because 3 years ago, I didn't even know what this place was.  Then after having my son, I avoided Chuck E. Cheese like the plague because the place just seemed noisy and ANNOYING to me. Well, here I am 3 years later giving Chuck E. Cheese 5 stars- why?  Because my 3 year old absolutely LOVES this place.   Don't ask me how because I've never mentioned Chuck E. Cheese to him but at 2 1/2 when we drove past a Chuck E. Cheese, he could call out the place by name and wanted to go there. FINALLY, I could not avoid the place any longer after we were invited there for a birthday party and my son was so excited to go there.  Once there, my son was in heaven!! The noise level on a busy Saturday morning still drives me crazy but I've since gone with my son and friends on a weekday morning when it's not so busy and I have to admit, it is a very safe environment with fun games that will entertain your child for hours. And definitely get on their email list for their great coupons and specials because if you are like me (and I never thought I would be doing it), you will end up buying tokens by the bucket load! So Chuck E. Cheese, never thought I would ever be doing this but here's a 5 star posting for you!"}
{"text":"man this place is full of kids, but what do you expect.  This place is really dirty i think they are not appropriately staffed. there are long lines at the cash register and toy favour counter can take a long time also.  my kids love it"}
{"text":"We went on Sunday 5/1/16 and it was very busy. I was bringing my 6 year old to reward her for accomplishing her goals at school. We also had my 13 year old son who only wants to sit home on his \"tech\" devices. I was pleasantly surprised how everyone was having fun and no complaints from my son. He started out playing his tablet on the house wi-fi  but then started participating. We got a coupon deal $49.99 for two large one topping pizzas, four drinks, and 120 tokens. The pizza was actually good and the tokens lasted four people for a couple hours. My wife did complain about the ladies room being dirty and the drink area was messy. It was very busy and they had birthday parties non stop. The security was good as they were thorough in checking who's with who at the door. I would definitely go back for sure and enjoyed myself more than expected as did everyone else."}
{"text":"Pizza came on time, was good, and service is very friendly. The only bad thing I can report is half the games and no that's not an exaggeration, half of the games don't work!  My family and I got 90 tokens thinking that should be enough to keep the kids happy and it was except we ended up using most of the tokens on games that weren't fun, more like spill games to get tickets.  Again I have turned say the service was great, the food was good, but the games left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Good ol' Chuck E. Cheese.. last time I was in one of these was about 20 years ago, good to see this franchise has been around for so long and now I have the opportunity to bring my child here  to admire the old time nostalgia of a good time. Of course things have changed in the last 20 years and you can obviously notice the changes if you are from my generation. Chuck E. Cheese used to be the main source for child entertainment back then, now we there are many more other options. Anyways... I took my 17 month old son here today.. as soon as I walked in I was greeted by a friendly teenaged boy who stamped us and let us in before advising us of where to go and what area would best suit my son. Was impressed already. We saw Chuckie as soon as we walked it which was a special surprise and dancing in front of all the children and the oncoming customers. My son was thrilled but more so confused as to what he was looking at lmao.   After we walked in the front counter is there to grab your food and your tokens, noticed the line was quite long (12pm on a Friday) with ONLY one attanedant working. (Boy at front said they are cutting hours so only one person doing cash) which shouldn't be the case especially on a Friday during Christmas holidays?? They shouldn't be cutting hours like that. Couple people in line were quite irritated but what can you do right? So after seeing the line up we decided to grab a seat instead and get situated with our belongings.   It's nice how the Chuck E. Cheese website offers you deals on food and tokens which totally helps (even if it's just a little) we got 100 tokens for $25 which I think is a great deal. So to all, while waiting in those long line ups take the opportunity to go to the website and grab the coupon before paying. We also got pizza buffet which was about $7.99  which is also I good deal with a drink. Pizza wasn't as bad I thought it would have been, of course everything is in kid sizes so as an adult I had more slices than I probably should have. :)  One thing I thought this place still had was a ball pit, which it didn't and I found quite disappointing. My son is still young so he can only do 1/3 of the activities here but oh well he still had a great time. Photo booths are fun, slides and trains with actual smoke which my son found very cool as he loves his Cho choos. One ride even takes pictures as your on the ride, not in the best quality but eh for a ride that's only 2 tokens you can't really complain. All the games here usually only use up 1 to 2 tokens each so the 100 tokens we had was WAY more than enough and we even left we some for the next visit.  All in all we had a good time, my son ran around like he owned the place and it tired him out just as I suspected. Thank you Chuck. E. Cheese for still being around and look forward to seeing you for the many years to come.   One word of advice to the franchise owner slash manger in this location, hire more staff for front cash!! Very slow and very upset parents. Not something you want as soon as people walk in to your establishment."}
{"text":"I'm from new York, so when I moved here and discovered the incredible pizza they have at chuck-e-cheeses, I realized with all my being that there is no reason for me to ever return to the roiling cesspit that is Manhattan.  It really is everything new York has to offer, without the reality of daily muggings. Flashing lights, bustling noises, and of course, the GREATEST PIZZA IN THE WORLD."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible. My sons birthday party experience was horrible as well! The party host was never able to be found and I had to go ask for everything the party was suppose to be included with. The lunch buffet is worthless and waste of money. The pizza is not fresh and sits there for a long time before they make fresh. Even the \"fresh\" pizza is nasty. I definitely will stick with going to Peter Piper Pizza!"}
{"text":"Prices for tokens and pizza have gone up,  likely to accommodate their new menu offerings. I was excited to see some new sandwich offerings but disappointed that I couldn't order the one I wanted (bbq chicken) as they were out of several of the ingredients.  Cashier was not trained well on the menu offerings or the register keyboard and paired her incompetence with a lackluster attitude. Frustrated that it took more than 30 minutes for a single individual sized cheese pizza to arrive at our table during a very low capacity mid week lunch time. All of that said- the manager of this establishment blew me away by noticing that we were less than thrilled and went above and beyond in trying to turn the day around for my son (without me asking).  He noted that Ty was filming with figurines and spoke in length with him about his hobbies and the animatronics (Tyler has autism so this made his day) We will drive to this Mesa location in favor of others just due to this experience."}
{"text":"Tip: If you're having a birthday party don't forget matches or a lighter (they don't provide them).  This is a review from an adult with no kids (lol).  I was there for a 3 year old's birthday party.   It is just like I remember from my birthday parties 25 years ago  I must admit I was content because some how the rat has a little bit of swag to him.  The songs have a trendy hip hop beat to them, and I do believe I saw CEC do some of the current dances (in a kid friendly way of course).  Chuck E also doesn't look as scary as he used to back in my day.  The costume is much better!!!  I also think the games are actually pretty fun to play.  They have a fun basketball and football game.  I also like Deal or no deal.  Be careful if you're even NEAR a game with balls.  Some of the smaller children will come up and take the balls, OR if they are playing them and their coordination isn't there yet the ball can hit you in the face when you aren't expecting.  I'm speaking on experience.  I was playing basketball which in the back corner of the facility.  Somehow a ball from another game takes me out.  Not kidding.  I was playing something else and I got hit again.  Was it on purpose?  You'd have to ask little Timmy lol.   Food:  The Pizza is actually pretty good.  Maybe I was just hungry though, but I was pleasantly surprised with the way it tasted.  I also like the fact that they serve beer.  Now, their beer is pricier than going to a bar, but there was no way I was going to make it without it.  Kidding.  But beer does make it nice!  They don't have many options or anything.  I must admit the lady at the front did not know how to pour beer.  I guess in her defense she wasn't old enough to drink, but lets just say that 3/4 of my cup was full and half of that was \"head\".  I had to motion to the manager to help her.  At first I thought I was being \"Punk'd\" but she didn't know lol.  I was at least patient.    Will I be back? Sure!  I told all my friends with kids when they go back to let me know.  It would be very strange to be in there without being able to associate with at least one child."}
{"text":"Gross is the one word that comes to mind when I think of where we had my nieces 3rd birthday party. This location has to be the dirtiest, stickiest, worn down place I've ever been into. Which is pretty sad since it's for children. A lot of the games and rides didn't work. The customer service there was awful. They didn't even remove our dirty plates after we ate our pizza, we had to put them on the table next to ours and they were sitting there as we left. All of the animated animals or whatever you'd call them looked like sad, worn out, crackheads with lazy and/or unopened eyes as they danced/flailed around. The place didn't even do anything for the birthday girl. No Chuck E walking around, no ticket booth, no happy birthday song, pure crap.  They really need to close down for a few days, clean and sanitize the entire place, fix the broken games and rides and have a \"how to treat customers\" seminar. I DO NOT recmommend this location."}
{"text":"I booked a birthday party 01/02/15 for my 3 year old son and it was the best party yet! I have had several chuck e cheese parties for my children over the years , but this one was better than any other . My party host Jason was amazing . The general manager came over as soon as we arrived and gave us a cup FULL of token on the house ! Our host played with the birthday boy, gave us more tickets and tokens than we payed for & went above and beyond to provide a fantastic experience .. Granted the pizza was the standard chain type pizza  (I am paying for the experience , not the cheap food) . they were slow at the time so we Didn't get kicked out of the party area as soon as our 2 hour time limit wAs up. I highly recommend Jason as your party host , and to Book your party at a slower time so you can reap the benefits ."}
{"text":"My kids had fun and the employees seemed nice. But it was very dirty, and we were there as one of the first families of the day. Which means it wasn't cleaned from the night before. Smudgy finger prints all over, dirty bathrooms that smelled like pee, soda machines that were quite gross, empty straw holder that was sticky and nasty, etc. I took a couple pics but didn't want to look like a crazy lady taking pics everywhere. It was only my family and 3 other families for lunchtime today."}
{"text":"The game selection was great for my little man, the customer service and the fact that 1 miserable employee was on register while her supervisor and other employees stood around, waiting 10 mins with no line at all for some tokens is not good."}
{"text":"We just had my son's 8th bday party here and we had the best time!  Our party hostess was amazing!  Janessa??? Ugh, I can't remember her name! But she was excellent.  My son was beaming ear to ear. Such great memories made. The food platters we ordered were bomb. Especially the ciabatta sandwiches.  Yum! The cake was excellent. The package we bought was also great. He walked away with all sorts of goodies!    Thank you Chuck E Cheeses! !!!"}
{"text":"It's cynical beyond belief re the food and not that well thought out re the games.   The games are not really well thought out in relation to the ages they cater for. Our six year old  couldn't see  above the modded \"gun\" games,nor reach pedals on the couple of race games there were. There are no steps/ accommodations for that and  he's too old for the simple games. Ergo.. not a lot to keep a kid used to Gameworks or Jillian's busy.    Staff were friendly,helpful and attentive, the place was clean but  that's not really a selling point,that's meant to be a given. Our son still had fun so when you are aiming at kids without standards fun can be had.   They have the audience, we're already paying over the top for the food so seriously spend the extra $ or 2 on the pizza and add it into the price. $17 for edible vs $15 for 3/4 left would be a nice thing. I can't reconcile  their website's \"fresh\"  ingredients with the pizza motif floor-tiling we received.  :update. Letter to their Corp office went unanswered seems like they know what they are doing:)  2nd update. Eventually got a call but it was agreed that we disagreed on how pizza should taste, they may use fresh mozzarella daily and new dough 2x a week but it's been brutalized to the point it's scare to rise:) .. Main review still stands."}
{"text":"Waited 40 minutes for a medium pizza wasn't even busy people came after that got wings and bigger order had their first management was no help really they both looked confused them self she told me it would be 5 more minutes and it was 15 more won't be back ever will go the Peter piper for now on and will be canceling the party I have reservations for"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Overpriced and it's being run by high school students that don't know how to handle things when they get busy. One guy us attending the whole ticket counter and there is 12 people waiting. Horrible service. And the food is mediocre and they got our good order wrong."}
{"text":"Lots of birthday parties for the kids here.  It always seems packed but I think that is because there are not many of these in the west valley.  Pizza is tolerable and service is average."}
{"text":"Let's be clear, those Yahoos who write a review with the intention to go for the pizza only, and leave a bad review, are just ridiculous.   Chuck E Cheese is a place for games, entertainment, and pizza. Family friendly!   We took our 6 year old daughter and 5 friends on a Friday afternoon for pizza and games. We were a little nervous, cause this is located in a sketchy area of Phoenix. We almost switched last minute to P.P, another local family fun place. So glad we Didn't!   This particular C. E. C, is very nice. It's clean, and friendly all around. We found the staff to be professional, and friendly.  They were available and interacting on the floor. If a machine had a problem, they were on it with a quick fix. The service was top notch.   From a business stand point, you can tell this place is well managed. The employees care about the customers!   By far way above our expectations. The kids had a fabulous time! Give this place a chance. If u are a large group, please call an advance..."}
{"text":"Sticky floors ... check  Loud screaming children .... check  Greasy pizza that can take paint off walls ... check  That's right, your at Chuck E Cheese. It was definitely fun if you go there with a small child and let them run loose, but, I don't think I enjoy that anymore. The only fun machine they had, for me at least, was an old Space Invaders arcade. And, just in case you were wondering, I don't like my pizza greasy anymore (at least not THAT greasy). Actually, my little one didn't like that greasy pizza either.   The games are definitely fun for the kids, and the motorized mouse on the big stage deffinitely brought back some memories for me (it actually didn't squeek and grind as it moved).  The question now is, would I go back? Short answer, mah. Long answer, I can bring my kid to a better play area for the amount of money I had to shell out. Total spent ($61 for a large pizza with one topping and five drinks, plus $10 for tokens)  'Nuf Said"}
{"text":"Mondays are the best days to check this place out. I like it way better than Peter Piper Pizza because it is cleaner and it seems like everything tastes a bit better. The pizza is not award winning but it is decent enough. The people working are all high school students it seems like but they do their job. They also have a secure way to get the kids in and out of the place which is nice!"}
{"text":"This is the best one in the valley!"}
{"text":"We had our son's 5th Birthday here yesterday and it was great. We chose an early morning (10am) party that offered extra tokens. The location was clean and all of the staff very friendly. Our chosen time was apparently not a popular party time slot which meant we had the venue to ourselves! We even had a few no shows and they were very accommodating about adjusting our count.   My only complaint was that some of the games were broken and on the older side. But they had a maintenance guy working on some and an attendant available to help with ticket dispensing. I imagine those machines take quite a beating at the hands of hundreds of kids a day. On the flip side everything only costs one token. My friend was saying another location they've been to charges 1-3 tokens depending on the machine.   Overall, I'm very happy with our experience and will be taking our son back."}
{"text":"Almost didn't come here based on the other reviews but I remembered it having a rising monster truck  (not there anymore) and my son is super into trucks so we went anyways and we had a blast!!! Pizza was not the greatest but both my boys ate it. Everything was clean. Games are only 1 token and they give out at least 1 or 2 tickets per game. The boys (ages 1&3) loved the little rides (they have a bunch), jungle gym and games. We hung out for about an hour or so on 60 tokens, got a sketched picture of ourselves, and a handful of toys for each of them! We really had a great afternoon for very little dough."}
{"text":"For the hundreds of dollars we spent, this was the WORST experience ever! Spent 15 minutes standing at the door with my entire party (of about 40 people) and no one knew what to do. The host was late coming to retrieve us! We finally get walked to our table and he doesn't tell us anything. I had to ask who was sitting where or how it was set up. Everyone was just standing around confused. He tells me he doesn't have tokens so he will go get them. Waited another 15 minutes for him to come back, meanwhile all my kids are going crazy just sitting around waiting for something to do. The table wasn't set either. Half way through I had to ask for cups for the kids. Then they bring out the adult food BEFORE the kids! I also was charged for adults and kids that didn't show up!! The \"manager\" who was completely rude, told me she would refund me IF I brought her back the empty plates and cups! We had used them for cake and other things since they were sitting there. I had no idea I was supposed to bring them back! I had to keep going to find the host asking what the plan was throughout the party. And my son didn't even get to open his presents! So the whole \"2 hour hosted party\" was a COMPLETE joke! So much wasted time, standing around, stress and chaos for me trying to run this party, and getting everything together we needed!!"}
{"text":"We were invited to a party here this weekend and....  The employees don't care about their job.  The food is disgusting, even down to the watered down soda!    I asked for a table to be cleaned and the employee just smeared it around, I ended up cleaning it up.  Hold a party there and Chuck E. Cheese is lackluster and the employees can't even fake a good time for the kiddos!  The tables are jammed so close together that when kids are sitting back to back, another child can't even get through.  I saw multiple childeren trying to squeeze their way out and ended up falling and throwing their tokens everywhere... this included my own child.    The \"games\" eat your tokens and good luck finding an employee to get the token back!  Then to top it all off, it is not the cleanliest place and  I got a stomach bug from there and am still miserable 2 days later!  Kids love it, but we need to be their protectors and keep them away from places like this.   Spare yourself, find another venue for a party!"}
{"text":"The food is overpriced and terrible.  Most of the machines are outdated and missing parts or malfunctioning. Whoever dresses up as ChuckeeCheese is an idiot.  Comes out every thirty minutes, hangs out in front of the bathrooms and lacks enthusiasm.   The place smells like mold and the staff is incompetent."}
{"text":"the worst place possible.  8 people in the whole place other than our group.  took 20 min to place order.  ordered at 5:57...it is now 6:42 and my order isn't here...AND cashier said they just started it!  games are broken and not giving correct tickets.  salad bar is $6.99 for one trip....more expensive than Olive garden!  take your kids to Peter piper"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you and your party get stamped. Then you walk right into the counter where you you can order over priced pizza and wings. They offer a salad bar for 6.00 it's a one time deal you get to load op a plate with withered lettuce and sloppy fixings. The drink machines need service most of choices were carbonated tasteless water. Finding a place to sit with your family is just horrible tables are wobbly and quite small. It also seems there really isn't anyone that tends to them. When we finally found a caople tables next to each other we wiped them down our selves.  The luxury family style benches are located in the reserved for party area.The wait for 2 pizzas and about 15 wings seemed like forever. So why I give 2 stars? That is because every single game is 1 token! So yes I actually had some fun. Now if you put aside and ignore all the little children that run up to your tickets and try to rip them out. Or the inappropriate dressed women that do not understand this is a family establishment then I guess you will be ok. I am not going to complain too much about the staff. I did need a few things and they were very  nice and responsive. Reminder...these are mostly teens and young adults doing as much as they can in this hectic busy environment. As time passed this place just seemed to get busier and busier on a Saturday afternoon. Cashing in tickets for some cheap prizes was not bad at all though. That was wierd. I think my wait was like 2 minutes. In the end I needed to pee bad. I waited to go home just wasn't too sure if I could handle the restroom. If we had to wipe down our own table. I just didn't feel like walking into a disaster zone.  This place just needs to be a lot bigger. More tables that a family can actually sit together in. Better food. And maybe more staff. Well that's all I have to say. I might not be back. If so it will be a long while."}
{"text":"The pizza is sub-average and the games are pretty lame. However, my 3 year old had fun putting tokens in the rides. The quality of CEC has really plummeted. The service was mediocre and slow . The store needs a deep cleaning and some updating. Peter Piper Pizza is a better choice for family fun of this kind."}
{"text":"Ok so once a month the first Sunday of the month is supposed to be sensory sunday... for kids with with sensory problems.. website says that and that only. but when you get there at 11 am since they open at 10 you think all will be well but you quickly find out that's a lie. it's super loud, even for me and my wife, I asked a lady that works there I thought this was sensory Sunday and she says that's from 8 till 10 even though it says on there door and there website they open at 10. what this is is false advertising, ment to luer people in with sensory issues knowing fully well your gonna make them regress even further with all the noise and rowdy kids, people working there yelling over the intercom.. it's not just bad business it's outright fraud.. shame on you for your lying ways and tactics and taking advantage of kids with issues.. I seen it on all the other parents faces.. we all were dupped.. but I'm making a statement. don't go there. they are just shady"}
{"text":"So I haven not actually been to a chuck e cheese in about 15 years. I was expecting it to be dark and burgundy with a room on the side with giant characters that burst out in song in a sort of hauting way. I was pleasantly surprised to see it updated with walls of windows, bright lights and bright colours.   Ok...so now for the rest. All the kids there were having a wonderful time! They have all the regular games like skeeball, mole wack, arcade style gambling games etc. They have lots of car racing games as well as lots of games for little guys. A friday night there was chaotic...they just did not have the staff to keep up with machines jamming, food not getting out on time etc. The one girl in the striped shirt was running ragged...as was everyone else...  We had a fun time, but if you really want to enjoy it, you might try a weeknight until your kids figure out how to be a part of the madness"}
{"text":"Had a great time for my son's 4th bday! Our party host was Christopher and he was just fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"I was worried about booking our party due to the bad reviews but they went out of their way to make my child's party fantastic. Everyone had a blast and we will definitely be going back. Food was great! Staff was great! Very happy"}
{"text":"If you are considering going to this restaurant, read this first!   While the luster of Chuck E Cheese's has worn off since I was last there twenty years ago, the basic tenets of economics have not.  When one pays for goods and services, one has a reasonable expectation they are provided.  I attended my nephew's birthday last week, and my brother paid for pizza, drinks, dessert (Dip'n'dots), goodie bags, and the ticket Piñata.  I'll itemize the failures in ascending order. 1. Drinks: cups arrived about 30 minutes into the assigned party time. 2. Pizza: cold, and arrived 1 hour into the assigned party time. 3. Ticket piñata: arrived and my nephew participated.  However, two adult men (40+ years old) from another party were literally pushing young kids from other parties (2-12 years old) out of the way to gather tickets.  I guess the employees are not responsible for your child's safety?   4. Dip'n'dots: never arrived, despite being purchased.   5. Goodie bags: never arrived, despite being purchased.  We queried the corporate office, however, if this store is any indication of their collective competence, I expect the fabled Dip'n'dots will arrive before a satisfactory response.    Recommendation: take your money and kids somewhere else."}
{"text":"NEGATIVES 1. Food       It's sub-par. (Then again, it's Chuck-E-Cheese's.)   - Salad Bar was not kept up or maintained. I noticed how toppings were falling into other toppings, looked like a mess. Wife received food poisoning from the Salad Bar. It's also not all you can eat Salad bar, (maybe that was for the best)  2. Games     - Your typical arcade, ticket - winning games. Although, less than half of them are working when you go there, while the rest either eat your tokens or are out of order.   3. Chuck-E-Cheese Mascot   - When you go to take your kids here, you want them to get the full experience don't you? Well don't hold your breath or you will turn red & blue in the face.     Unless you are willing to wait until almost closing time for Chuck-E-Cheese to make one SINGLE appearance and settle for the robotic version/on the screen tv's (Sorry, but its NOT the same thing)   If they DO have the Chuck-Cheese Mascot walk out... Expect for a Chuck-E-Cheese Employee to dress up in the costume and walk around aimlessly, while distracting the kids with \"free-tickets\"...MAYBE. when I say \"free tickets\" I have it in quotations for a reason, and use those words loosely. Because your kid may not get anything at all when you have other kids scrambling for a mere few tickets. So Chuck-E will come out for 5 minute walk with some high-fives..Donald Trump would call it Low-Energy, so would I.    POSITIVES          .....INSERT CHIRPING CRICKETS HERE.....

{"text":"Just visited Chuck E Cheese in Mesa AZ for the \"new lunch buffet\", all we can say is how awful and what a joke.  Worst experience ever.  Spent $25.00 for 2 adults and 1 child, the signs all say endless salad bar, pizza and dessert.  Let me tell you what this endless lunch buffet consisted off.  The salad bar was a complete joke, all they had on it was salad and salad dressing.  What kind of salad bar is that????  Then they had 2 1/2 pizza's on the salad bar, mind you this goes from 11am to 2 pm and we were there before noon.  Before we were even able to get to this lunch buffet the pizza was gone.  We had to wait for them to make more pizza.  There was quite a number of families there so its not like they were slow.  A number of families stood around waiting for food.  Finally they brought out more pizza and in a matter of minutes it was gone again.  The manager on duty there didn't seem to care and he just stood behind the counter like it was okay to no food ready for your paying customers.  They only had one dessert and you had to wait for that as well.  GOING TO THIS \"NEW LUNCH BUFFET\" is not worth your time, STAY AWAY, NOT WORTH THE MONEY.  Now let's talk about they games, half the games didn't work, had signs on them that they were temporarily out of service.  The games that did work hardly gave out tickets, really?  The fishing game gave out wrong ticket amounts, example you spun the wheel and clearly you win 5 tickets, it tells you congrats you won 3 tickets.  This was reported to the cashier and she said not to play the game and will have a tech come look at the game.  We were there till 2pm and no tech ever came to the game.  Games for children and you have to waste tokens to get any sort of ticket amount.  The ticket eating machines only counts like every other ticket, so the rob you of half your tickets.  Then there is the prizes, you need 400 tickets for a pair of plastic sunglasses?  Anything decent enough you need 1200 tickets, there was no prizes available between 400 and 1200.    Chuck E Cheese himself seemed like it was a bother to be there with the kids, it was a strain to act the part and dance with the kids.  Not worth the money, bathrooms dirty, staff doesn't care.  Waste of money!!!!!  Don't waste your time or money......."}
{"text":"This place screams the 90s. Came here on a Friday afternoon with my friend and her daughter. It was reasonably busy but there were many free tables available and there wasn't much wait for machines. The lunch buffet that's $7.99 is for the pizza which is a pretty good deal. There were 3 savoury flavours and one dessert pizza. We opted to get a combo for tickets + drink + pizza. We ordered a plain cheese with stuffed crust. It was reminiscent of Pizza Hut pizza which is a good thing in my books. The cheese is a thick plasticy mozzarella. Chuck E makes timed appearances and leads a dance followed by a make it raining of tickets. The dance was a nice touch to get the kids to stretch and move. The prizes seemed kind of cheap and whatever but at least there was always the candy fall back. Kiddo was happy so we were happy."}
{"text":"This is going to be short and simple! The only plus side to this place is the games and the security at the door. Other than that, its dirty, the staff is unorganized, the prices for food and tokens is pretty high and last the food is awful tasting! I don't mind spending a pretty penny on my son having a good time, but I would like a little bang for my buck. At least Peter Piper has decent tasting pizza and wings. Chuck E Cheese's has no flavor to their wings and their pizza taste like cardboard. The family packs, where you get a pizza wings and tokens, not worth it! I spent over $60 for a large pizza, wings and tokens for 4 people! Jeeeeesh!!! I think this is a no-go for us in the future."}
{"text":"Well I am giving 3 stars because this is a place you go for a kids birthday and not your first choice restaurant when it's family night to go out to dinner. The pizza was surprisingly good. The slices are small but actually pretty good. There are way more rides than Peter Piper and the experience is better for kids. Chucky Cheese comes out and gets the kids involved with dancing and singing, that was neat. The negatives were it is run down and needs some upgrades. I was most disappointed in prices. We paid 38.99 for a large party platter of wings and we got 8 boneless and 7 bone in wings. They said this could feed 8 people. I went back and thought they made a mistake and they said no we do it by ounce of wing not by how many. I was very frustrated because that is a lot of money for such a little quantity. The manager brought us another order for the confusion, but said that is what I ordered. It's worth coming here for a kids birthday party but I would just stick to pizza."}
{"text":"We had  our daughter's third birthday party here. Our party host was outstanding.  The games and activity area's were very pleasing for the kids.  The pizza was fairly terrible, but we expected that.  There are a lot of kids milling around unsupervised, not associated with the birthday parties or with parents in attendance.  But again, that was not unexpected.  All in all, the kids had a great time, the party was over and done with, no fuss no muss, and the service was good.  The manager stopped by for a moment to let check on us, and honestly, he looked a little squirrely, but whatever, we didn't seek him out, he didn't come around again."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. We went in to experience the party package for my daughter turning 7. I expressed my concerns to the manager who did not really seem to care. After our discussion the manager hid in the back to avoid any further conversation with me, and would send his employees for any further discussions that had to take place. Since the terms of the party package were not fulfilled entirely and the service was awful I filed a dispute with my credit card company with the break down of the package and what was and what was not fulfilled. The receiver of the complaint lied on their response and stated that I never brought the concern up to management. Not only does this establishment provide terrible service, but they appear to be liars as well.     -Superhero Cap & Mask, Princess Cape and Tiara or Chuck E. T-shirt for your birthday star -fulfilled  -2 hours of reserved table space Area was filled with non-party guest who interfered with our own activities. The manager said that nothing stops other guest from joining the reserved areas. The hostess asked us to leave the area 20 minutes before our time slot was up, we were in the middle of opening presents and pictures.   -Ticket Blaster experience for the Birthday Star with a change to catch the Magic Ticket I am not even sure if this took place, I was speaking with a very un-empathetic manager who was explaining to me that there is nothing special about the party package and that I could have just gotten pizza and charged the stage during the birthday show like everyone else.   -Star recognition in our Birthday show Star recognition was not given due to other non-party guests in the area. All of the guests were on the same platform/location during the show. Definitely not \"star treatment\" for the birthday guest.   -Superhero or Princess Table top photo cutout - Fulfilled -60 tokens for the Birthday child Tokens in this batch was 10 short. I had to ask the hostess for a correct amount of tokens.  -40 tokens for each additional child - Not sure  -Free refills for soft drinks - Multiple soda streams were out of service and dispensing diluted soda.   -2 Slices of a one-topping pizza per child - Pizza was cold when served  -Festive tablecloth and plateware -Fulfilled  -Party host/hostess -Hostess clearly did not want to be there. She was very slow to react to our needs. Management was not any better. I spoke with a member of the management team for ten minutes regarding how unpleased we were. After that discussion he was nowhere to be found.   -Email invitation powered by Punchbowl  - Not utilized"}
{"text":"Do not get the BUFFET!!! The entire time we were there they did not have even PIZZA ready for people to eat. They sold plenty of buffet tickets and yet the buffet was literally empty!! Once they did bring out 2 pizzas they were gone instantly because of how many people were waiting!! Horrible service and horrible food. Won't be coming back. Close your buffet if you don't have food!!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing screams \"I have young children\" like spending time at Chuck E Cheese's.  When I was growing up it was the only place I wanted to go every single birthday.  My poor parents.  Gone are the huge animatronic displays ( remember \"the King\"??) and the up and down seats.  Now Chuck is hip, and mostly on the screens in the birthday area--think sugar-fueled preschool show.  This location has seen better days, though we were there on a busy Sunday. The skee ball lanes had maybe two balls if you were lucky, and it seemed that half the games had one of their coin slots broken.  The prizes are still cheap, but I've gotta say our little ones (3 and 6) has the best time ever, and were oblivious to the problems.  They were thrilled to get tickets, ride on the rides and had a blast.   The staff was all very friendly, and you have several food options beyond pizza (sandwiches, chicken tenders, salad bar, veggie platters, etc).  I've been to two parties there, it's tempting because the staff really does a nice job.  Bottom line, the kiddos just love it.  (And sorry again, mom and dad!)"}
{"text":"The location is pretty good. There are plenty of games for the kids to play.  BUT, the food was terrible.  I wasn't expecting much, but it didn't even deliver \"just ok\".  The management needs to step up their game.  There were bad grapes mixed in with good ones.  And the salad looked old.  I know, we took the kids there for the pizza, but not even that was good.  I'd at least give this place two stars, but the employees were lazy and a lot on the rude side.  It's almost as if they were saying, \"We know you're still going to bring your kids here because your kids ask for it.\"  If we had been at an adult restaurant and were treated the way we were here, we would have walked out."}
{"text":"We took the kids here for a birthday party.  While the food is nothing special, the employees were very courteous.  Well, I take that back.  The wings are better than expected.   This after a horrible experience at the Chuck E Cheese in Glendale.  The kids had a great time.  And I had to laugh at their rendition of \"Living on a Prayer\" which was aptly named \"Grandma's Rocking Chair\".  One other thing of note, this Chuck E Cheese was clean.  A big plus when you're talking about letting your kids run around in areas of the place without shoes on."}
{"text":"When we arrived, it was not busy.  Went to order our pizza and wings at the counter, no one was there.  Wait game started.... finally a worker showed up to TRY and take my order, she didn't know how to work the register. Waited again for someone else to help, they finally come by to help with placing my pizza order did not ask if she needed further help before walking away.  Now I'm left with the person who is clueless again, she asks me to pay the pizza and come back as she has a long line behind me.   The experience lady walks by after I pay and tell her she didn't know how to order wings, family size so we get that in order....30 min just to order food.   Food service took a while to get, they brought out the \"family size\" wings ...5 small Pcs.  $20 for 6 small Pcs....went back up to the ordering desk and the ladies simply said I thought you said kids size and disregarded that we paid for the \"family size\".     Spoke with the manager, showed him the receipt.  He apologized refunded me my $ and placed another order in for us free of charge.  (Which is why I gave them 3 stars instead of 2)  Cook comes out and appologies and he says he's been working there for a month, the cashier has been there for 2wks.  This place needs some serious help in training there employees.  If there not trained they should not be in front with the customers.    We will not be returning back."}
{"text":"Not sure why ppl are saying they have bad pizza because it was pretty good to me.  However, I am debating whether the childhood nostalgia memories are kicking in.  From what I remember as a child I loved the pizza here! We came on a weekday for dinner, felt weird cause 2 adults, hahah whatever no shame.  We got a pizza and the wings, both were sooo good! The games are pretty old because I remember playing them as a child.. can't really comment on anything else except they have REALLY SLOW SERVICE.  It took 10 mins for someone to come to the front.  After dinner we relived our childhood days by playing the games, full and happy.  We'd probably come again for the pizza and wings"}
{"text":"I've only found myself here during off peak times, apparently. As I have never seen any big crowds here. I don't come here to frequently as it can get pricey throwing the tokens in those machines, especially when the wife GTA on the \"Deal or No Deal\" game. It is a fun time for everyone, even the kids.   We've never eaten here, at least not since I had a birthday here many moons ago, so we can not attest to the quality or taste of the food."}
{"text":"The games have improved over time. I visited back in 2013 and had a terrible experience with employees. Since then the employees have also improved and I would like to go back eventually. One thing that I didn't like is that they removed the tokens but the new \"play pass\" card works very well."}
{"text":"I like to take my kids to Chuck E Cheese because my daughter has Celiac and they have a certified gluten free pizza. Typically the pizza is served sealed and with a separately sealed pizza cutter. When we came to this location her pizza was served on a regular open plate with no protections. When I asked the server to verify that it was gluten free and hadn't gone in contact with other surfaces she rolled her eyes at me and walked off. I will definitely not return to this location."}
{"text":"I'd hate to talk bad about a \"kids place\" but it started with the server, throwing our food on the table. We are paying customers and that's not how you treat us. Secondly, parents don't watch their kids. They are climbing on machines, hanging on to my daughters machine trying to get a free ride. The workers don't say anything.  The place is dirty and we'd never come back to this location."}
{"text":"Maybe the ONLY good thing I like about this place is that the person at the door  stamps your whole family's arm with a number that can be viewed under a black light---that way Peds or Weirdos don't try to leave with a random kid if the number doesn't match under the glowing black light.  Don't try to walk in with a juice box in the open--they won't allow it. They want you to buy their sugary sodas for the kiddies.  If you do sneak in a Juice Box, Capri Sun, or bottle of water, be sure to conceal it in your purse, pocket, or diaper bag. They treat the situation like you are sneaking in a case of beer or something!  The pizza is really disgusting! The crust is so nasty, not sure WHO thought this even tastes good enough to eat. Cheese Whiz on a saltine is gourmet compared to this CRAP!  Many of the games were OUT OF ORDER....and there were way too many teenage girls crawling through the kiddie play tunnel for actual little kids to get in it.    Hey Chuck E Cheese, how about some carpet deodorizer??? There is nothing like the smell of stale vomit lingering in the dining area when trying to consume overpriced nasty pizza, how appetizing! Yum!"}
{"text":"when you go for a birthday and you see an employee wiping the table off with a floor broom you can only imagine what they use in the kitchen to clean   will never be back  and will be reporting to health dept.  see attached photo's"}
{"text":"This place is way better than Peter piper pizza. The salad bar is fresh and there's lots of toppings to choose from. The pizza is really good too. The prices are reasonable. There's so many games to choose from and they're all just 1 token. The place is clean. The workers are friendly. Nice place to bring kids and get out of the heat."}
{"text":"Pizza was subpar at best.    Tasted more like cardboard Honestly for the amount of money we spent today the food could of atleast been decent.   There's 0 room for seating so unless you only have 2 kids don't expect to be able to sit and eat comfortably. The kids had fun atleast  Really doubt we will be back unless its for another kids birthday."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday, and the place was busy but not too busy.  The salad bar was on point and had good potato salad and cottage cheese. The pizza cam out hot and fresh and the employees seemed attentive to whatever needed attention! Had a great time l!"}
{"text":"Police should never be at Chuck E. Cheese. But on the night I was tricked into going, they were. My mom conveniently forgot to mention after my brother and I agreed to have dinner with her that she has also invited her friend and her three children under 10.   She also forgets to mention that we're going to Chuck E. Cheese. I've never seen so many unattended children in my life. Running here, flinging pizza there, spilling soda and screeching like possessed little demons on satan's playground.  Then I see some unruly dad starting a fight with another dad. WTF people! This is Chuck E. Cheese! Dads fight at Chuck E. Cheese? Is nothing sacred anymore?   Long story short, the police were called, the dads were tossed out and I decided that this location had to be the most ghetto Chuck E. Cheese in the world.  And it was a little dirty. Things just didn't seem clean.  But on a lighter note, the creepy robot animals actually put on a nice show and the pizza, although thin, really wasn't that bad. But just so we're clear, I will never, ever go back."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed by this Chuck E. Cheese.  They have no lunch specials available during the summer at all, despite advertising that they have several available when the kids are in school. Well, how about you capitalize on this additional traffic and have some lunch special, even if it costs a little more, so I might actually want to eat with my kids here?   Then, I went to buy tokens at the register because I only had a $20 bill, and I just wanted to spend $10 on tokens. The tokens at the machine are $5 for 15 tokens. Up at the register, you can buy $30 tokens for $10 (essentially, the same thing). So I order 30 tokens, and they try to charge me sales tax. WHAT?   I am not paying an additional $0.52 for you to convert my money into your spendable version of money, when I would not pay that at the machine.  That's ridiculous. I asked for change and did it myself at the machine.   Most Chuck E. Cheese's that I have been to have the little token cups sitting at the token machine. Not this one. I sent my kid up to the guy at the front entrance to ask for one, and despite the fact that he had a stack of them right there, he actually sent her to go wait in line at the cash register to ask the cashier for one. Seriously?  Are you kidding me? I saw the whole thing and was really irritated.   A lot of the machines don't cash out the number of tickets that they say they will be cashing out. I think they bank on the fact that kids aren't really paying attention to that. A couple of the games were out of order. The characters at the front never turned on to \"perform\" like they do at other ones. They don't have the Chuck E TV thing with the green screen going on up there either.   The one thing I will give this place... at least it is clean."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time this week & Im confused as to why there's so many negative reviews of this place! I liked it so much better than the competition! Games were clean (only 2 or 3 were broken) and food wasn't bad for a video game/pizza joint. I signed up for their email list and they sent a coupon that allowed us to get a pizza, 4 drinks, and 175 tokens for $50. I really loved that every game takes only one token, as its less confusing for little kids and they don't have any graphically violent video games here that you need to keep younger kids away from. We visited on a week night, but they still had a stuffed chuck e cheese come out and dance with the kids. My only complaint would be that they seemed a little under staffed- there was only one employee to be seen and although he was doing a great job of stamping hands (nice security measure!), taking order, delivering orders and running the ticket redemption counter, there were some waits just because he wS the only one."}
{"text":"This was a very clean place but the service was not that great. When it was time for the birthday song the server did not have the cake out. Also she was asking us questions while were trying to take pictures of our child with the top cheese Chuckie."}
{"text":"Most of the employees were really friendly, especially the lady at the front who gives you the stamp. The food was pretty good. We got pineapple pizza and the sample platter. The place is pretty messy, there were cups and trash all over the tables in the main area. The machines don't give you the amount of tickets that you're supposed to get, for instance the skee ball says 2 tickets for points 0-170 and we only got 1 ticket each time. It will probably be another year before we visit any chuck e cheese."}
{"text":"It's MothaF**kin Chuck E Cheese!!! You go with your kids, siblings, and/or little cousins, spend about a hundred dollars on tokens, they play some skee-ball and at the end of the night they get these cheap little dollar store toys for all the sweat and effort they dished out. Effing awesome how innocent kids are considering how happy they leave this place. That alone is worth the cost. Just make sure you bathe them in Purell after because this place is bacteria heaven. A few rounds in the jungle gym and little Timmy will smell like a dirty diaper."}
{"text":"The worst service ever from beginning to end. The wait and clueless employers and rude comments when asked to wipe down tables and let them know the machines aren't working and to refill the salad bar which should be taken care of if they can be chit chatting amongst each other. They refund wasn't asked for but was definitely given because the manager had to admit it was a lot shitty not a bit but a lot!"}
{"text":"We had my son's birthday party here yesterday and as I was reviewing the different places to do a birthday party, I looked to reviews. I wanted to add my review in hopes that it helps other people.  THE PARTY: First off, when we arrived there, we were greeted and when I told the person that we had a birthday reserved at 5pm, she was expecting us and promptly went to go get our birthday host.   The table was set up for us and in less than 5 minutes, our party host was there to help us. She brought out our tokens and we got our pizza ordered.   Samantha was our hostess for the party and she did a great job. She was working both the kitchens and was our party host and still managed to get the food out in time, serve the cake, get us candles, and make my son feel like he was a superstar.   My son adored dancing with the Mr. Cheese himself and we had a good laugh with him in the ticket blaster machine.   THE FOOD: I ordered two cheese pizzas for the kids, a mini personalized pizza, breadsticks, and the salad bar.   The salad bar was clean and stocked very well. It's your basic salad bar, nothing too fancy but everything was fresh and tasted good.   The pizza was surprisingly tasty! I was expecting it to not be very good but I was pleased. I would say it was on par with other major pizza companies.  THE GAMES: The games are outdated. Some are new but many of them are older games. Sometimes they would not give tickets and sometimes they would take your coin. But I kind of expect that when I go to any arcade. It didn't matter enough to my kids and they were happy with the tickets and prizes they got. I was also helped promptly at the ticket prize counter.  THE VALUE: I got the \"star\" birthday party package. Would I say it was worth it? Yes. My kids had a blast and it was awesome to have a birthday party where I didn't have to cook or clean up the dishes afterwards. My son got completely showered with tokens and tickets from Chuck E. Cheese (they gave us extra of both), Samantha was always willing to help us with anything (she even cut and served the cake for me), the food was tasty, and the place was clean. Overall, I would recommend it. The only negative thing was that some games were out of service and others would sometimes not give tickets or take your tokens but I would honestly expect that in any arcade so it wasn't a huge enough deal for me."}
{"text":"Great spot. Staff is so fun and they are so nice. We will be returning soon. The place is so clean even the bathrooms."}
{"text":"If I could have given this place zero stars, I absolutely would have. We have hosted and attended parties at this location in the past. None of which we're overly impressive, but acceptable.  We decided this year, for our daughter's 6th birthday, that instead of paying the outrageous price of the exclusive party package, we would just come early, grab a few tables, and do it our own way. I called early, mainly to check that it would be allowed if we brought cupcakes. They agreed that it would be fine, but refused to let me pay \"ala carte\" for the ticket blaster which I thought was odd.  So we show up, it is Monday night, and not very crowded at all. The person running the register was clearly ill-trained and it took us, amongst the other people ordering play passes and pizzas, over 10 minutes to order, after we waited in the line that took a half an hour because she was the only employee there. The manager (Andrea) finally came out, was extremely rude, and not at all helpful.  Our pizza took over an hour, it was cold. My girlfriend ordered wings, she never received them and when she asked for a refund, THEY STILL CHARGED FOR HER DRINK. So after ranting, obviously we will never be back, which is a shame because our kids love to play there. I just cannot see spending nearly $200 to leave disappointed and treated poorly. Step it up guys."}
{"text":"The greatest part of my trip to this Chuck E Cheese was the fact that I was going there to meet my brothers girlfriend and her daughters for the first time. Other then that this chain location really didn't meet up to my expectations.   It was a clean and a fairly large location that had plenty to do for all ages of children even the big ones, but half of the machines either ate the tokens or just had out of order slips placed on them. That sucks and is hard to explain to a 2yr old who only has a I wanna play mindset! I have no clue how many tokens were wasted??   The food was mediocre, we ordered the \"family\" special to feed 4 people uh huh yeah right???? That consisted of a \"large\" pizza, 4 drinks and 100 tokens............whoopty dooo! The pizza was card board with a bit of peperoni flavor to it. I had to eat something more so I took it upon myself to go get a salad what a rip off $4.99 for a one-trip serving. So I decided to pile it on but the selection of toppings didn't look to good so I had a salad with mushrooms and a bit of cheese and of coarse ranch dressing. I did get some macaroni salad to have a bit more to eat but that made no difference.   I just loved the woman who had her 3yr old who was running ramped all over the place asking everybody for pennies (aka tokens) from every adult but his own freakin' mother! I can't stand parents who don't pay any attention to their kids and just leave it up to other parents to actually parent them.............WTF kind of bullshit is that??? Pure laziness that what it is!!   Anywho..............................*deep breath* from getting my self worked up!   The kids had fun which is why this rating is getting 2stars, but ill never step foot in this place again."}
{"text":"Came here on a week night for my sons 2nd birthday. It was so quiet and we basically had the whole place to ourselves. The staff were friendly upon our arrival. I think i paid $10 for my son to play for an hour. There was a variety of rides and gamea for all ages. They had food avaiable to order such as pizza and drinks. They had a security system where they put an invisible stamp on the adult that brings the child in so that child must leave with that adult. They use a flash light so only the staff and you can see. I also like how chuckie came out to dance with us. He gave us tickets ans high fives! We had a great time."}
{"text":"Took my son here on December 6th for his first visit ever. He is 4. He had such a great time. Everything was clean, the games all worked great and the employees were super friendly. I appreciate great customer service and always base whether I will return to a business based on customer service. Tailor and Tim were so awesome and I give them both 5 stars. Thanks for making my son's first visit so special."}
{"text":"We had our sons 4th birthday there and it was awesome!  We arrived about 15 minutes early to make sure everything was in order for our party, and was immediately greeted by our hostess who was already waiting for us.  She showed us to our table and explained how the party was going to play out.  Everything went perfectly!  The atmosphere was fun and the food was great!  The best part was not having to worry...  All we brought was the birthday boy, cake and balloons!  They took care of the rest, including (my favorite) the clean up ;)  The kids as well as the adults had a blast, so overall very good experience and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!!"}
{"text":"They have a giant sign advertising a lunch special but when you try to order it they tell you sorry the kids arent in school right now what a joke we left and went to Peter Piper Pizza. never again"}
{"text":"Although we had a FANTASTIC birthday party at CEC last year, this review is about the weekday buffet. It SUCKS!!! They don't put out many pizzas and, when they do, they put out the same pizzas over and over:  Cheese, pepperoni and pepperoni with mushroom and olives. NO VARIETY!! And when the pizzas get old and cold, they do not replace them until some desperate person takes them (maybe they toss them in hopes for new pizza!!).   There is a gal who stands there at the buffet in a creepy way. I got salad and some lady sneezed on it and I felt so awkward going back to get more salad that I just tossed mine and went without more because I felt like I was being monitored.   I simply will NEVER go back for the buffet!! I should just give one star, but I like Chuck E. Cheese but for the buffet experience!!!"}
{"text":"Had my nephews fourth birthday there today. Kids had a great time. Food was not very good. We had pizza, but even kids weren't impressed. Show was ok. There was a mouse talking to tv screens. Kids seemed to enjoy it though. Guess that's what matters most."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. I've spent 15 out of my 26 birthdays at chuck e cheese. I've been a loyal customer. This locations customer service was awful. No one was at the register for over 5 minutes. Only 2 floor staff members. I was there for over an hour and a half not once did \"chuckie\" come out. Once I was helped I realized the soda machine was down. Waited 20 minutes for someone to help. Asked the manager for help and she forgot. Asked the cook for help and he forgot, asked the cashier for help and finally they were fixing it. The manager fixed it but never told me it was ready. Waited so long to get served burned pizza and when I received my wings I didn't even get celery and carrots or ranch. After I asked to please get celery and carrots I was given four tiny pieces of celery and no carrots.  I have a picture of it. The cashier was on her phone the whole time crouched down on the counter. Also have a picture of it. The manager was no where in sight. The guy at the door was crouched down on the floor on his cell phone. He would get off his phone when someone walked in. Then he would stand there continuing on his phone. I also have a picture of him. The manager was allowing other people who weren't dressed in uniform go to the kitchen area. Sadly I couldn't even eat my food. Didn't end up playing on the games. On my way out the guy who was supposed to stand by the door was sitting on the floor with his legs spread out on his phone and when he saw us leaving he looked at us and said \"shit\" and told us to have a good day. All while the cashier was on her cell phone near him. Unprofessional employees, untrained, they all really put shame on the name of this company. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"I took my nephews here last week. The place wasn't busy when we arrived. 1 hour n 15 mins later I had to speak to the manager bcuz we nvr received our order. Medium pepperoni pizza. Families that arrived after us received their orders before us. The manager refunded me $10 for my pizza. Nvr again will I go to Chuck E. Cheese."}
{"text":"Worst service ever ! Took over an hour to get my food and to find out that once my food got here it was incomplete and they didn't bother to fix it! Employee came and complained to me and my boyfriend for requesting to get out plates fixed  never coming back to this place again ! Worst of all all employees are super mean and disrespectful. This Chuck E. Cheese needs to be closed asap !"}
{"text":"Following the closure of the Bell Road location, we have to venture a little farther afield for some quality mouse time. The pizza is tolerable, but Chuck E Cheese is not really about the pizza, is it? The price is high, but you can receive some extra tokens using online coupons. And those tokens are what matter. On this Saturday, we had a very long wait to order, aka a very long wait for tokens, a pretty serious problem when you have little ones all fired up and ready to play. To the restaurant's credit, \"most\" of the machines were operational and not stealing tokens or shorting tickets. Skeeball was the major exception. Our disappointment this day was the absence of Chuck E Cheese himself. We were use to the Bell Road location where he'd frequently come out to interact with kids and make it rain tickets. It seems you need to pay for a birthday party to play with Mr. Cheese at this location. Despite this, Chuck E Cheese remains a good choice for young kids to play indoors and for parents to enjoy the air conditioning. We're going to check out other locations."}
{"text":"2015 UPDATE: OH NO!!!!! This location has closed!!!  It's noisy. It's expensive. Other patrons can be annoying. The pizza is fine. Sometimes.  The entertainment is just a shell of the awesome animatronic musical shows the chain formerly presented.  Hundreds of hard earned tickets earn you, well, next to nothing in prizes.  So why stop in? Your kids will love it, particularly if they are on the young side. Just watch their enthusiasm when Chuck E Cheese himself makes an appearance.   They have a child security system, stamping you and your children with invisible ink when you enter.  No children leave without an adult with a matching stamp. Wonderful. It allows kids to run free to have fun.  The play maze suspended from the ceiling at this location is \"awesome\" in the words of our little ones. And their favorite game? The ticket counting machine. I kid you not."}
{"text":"The only reason this gets 2 stars is because my kids love this place. The pizza is Terrible. The games pretty crappy and run down many of them not working properly.  Why can't places for kids serve better quality food?"}
{"text":"No longer here, There is now a Chuck E Cheeses at the same location, I wish that I had known that before driving all this way for a pizza buffet!"}
{"text":"When I was a kid, Chuck E Cheese was a place I went to for birthday parties. Now, as a babysitter, I took a 5 year old, per parents request, as a reward for good behavior for 4 days. We went around lunch time on a Friday, there were two or three other families there but they were there separately. After an hour a few more came in. It just seemed like a casual Friday afternoon lunch amongst kids, games, and a creepy giant mouse who made it rain tickets on the kids, they had to pick them up off of the floor. The staff was friendly and competent, although I did have to wait a few minutes before being helped every time I was at the counter.   There are coupons online, I just googled chuck e cheese coupons, and there are about 7 that come up. I used the one for 125 tokens for $25. That lasted a good 2 hours, then we had pizza. Note: they offer a gluten free pizza and gluten free cupcakes. The salad bar didn't look too sad, but it was $6.99, a complete rip off.   The prize counter did not have many toys. Some of the \"prizes\" had actual price tags. Additionally, if someone is short on tickets for the prize they want, they will take cash to make up the difference. Watch out parents, because she looked at the child and said she needed 100 more tickets, looked at me and said \"it's a dollar, if you want to do it that way\". So I put the dollar up!   Overall, I can see how a novelty place like Chick E Cheese from my 90's childhood became a place for casual Friday lunches for families with young children. There's just really nothing that special about it. I wish there was a place like Discovery Zone I could take a 5 year old, now that place was fun!!"}
{"text":"Our 5 year old picked his birthday spot. We invited some close family friends and took out family of 5 as well. We didnt plan any party as he celebrated this past weekend. Apon showing up manager Steve had greeted us, he started right in telling our son he know it was his birthday (presents gave it away) it meant so much to Cole.  I should have known then the night would be great, I never imagined the above and beyond the whole staff and Steve would go. We have fun every where we go, but this is unreal. We feel truly blessed at the service from everyone. Cole was so excited when we left and even today is still talking about it! As are we. My husband and I were just blown away. We will be back more then just for birthdays.  Thank you all for the amazing night and for making Coles birthday even more special. Service was top notch! Great job, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just horrible. Went on a Saturday night, which I do not recommend. Almost every napkin dispenser on every table was empty. Had to swap out my own with a table on the other side of the restaurant. No straws in the straw dispensers. Manager is walking around clueless not taking care of any of these issues. And there are 3 employees chatting behind the prize counter with no customers there. Why can't they take care of straws and napkins?"}
{"text":"Average food. But it us a good place to go for this little kids. Good variety if rides for most ages below 15."}
{"text":"Cleanest Chuck E Cheese I've ever been to.  They have a great buffet lunch M-Thu for less than $7 too!!! If a machine isn't working, this awesome guy immediately comes to fix it.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I give this place 1 star only because our pizza took an hr to come. Then only 2 of the ticket machines where working,  also when we went up to collect a prize only one person was helping people when two people where standing up front I asked them if one of the people in the front could come over and help she gave me a snotty attitude rudely telling me no I believe if you're going to work in a place like this you should have patients and kindness. Very upset because my kid is obsessed with going here. Makes me not want to ever go back!"}
{"text":"Chucky Cheese at Argentia is AWFUL - been multiple times for my nieces' bdays last couple of years - I will never get those hours back. I grew up going to bday parties at this joint, mostly in the US - huge locations, tons of games, decent pizza, and consumed characters instead of pycho-scary looking robots - it was amazing. This is without a doubt the red-headed-stepchild version of Chucky Cheese, and should have their franchise license revoked.  Pro tip: A&W and a South St Burger are both across the street, as well as a Massage Addict location. There is also a Moxies that opens at 11am right next door. For emergencies..."}
{"text":"It is what it is. Its Chuck E Cheese, a place to have a bday party for little kids.  Chuck E comes out to dance and kids get to play games. They can go a little cheaper on the drinks but I will say their pizza quality has definitely gone up since last time I was there so thats good."}
{"text":"Note to myself: Never eat at chuck e cheese. I found hair in my salad and the supervisor informed me that mine was the first of such complaints that day! He then proceeded to give me an empty plate to get some more! Yuck!"}
{"text":"One of the better chuck e cheeses. It is realativly clean. Food is as youd expect and it lives up to a kid friendly enviroment.  Lets face it you're not here for the fine quinine you're here for a safe clean place for you kids to go bananas in and this is it."}
{"text":"Everyone who knows us knows Chuck E Cheese is our favorite family hangout. I've been taking my daughter here since she started walking (she's 12 now). My son loves it here too. But today was a disappointment. We went out of our way to come here to try their lunch buffet for the first time. It's Presidents' Day. There's a line out the door. And when we got our plates to get food, the only thing that was out was the salad, light ranch and one single cheese pizza. Took 10 minutes for 2 more pizzas to come out and it was a pepperoni and a mushroom pizza. Needless to say it went quick and the pizza bar was bare for 10-15 minutes until more pizza came out. I was expecting there to be their usual full salad bar plus pizza. There was salad and pizza and their dessert pizza. That's it. That's the variety. I do buffets for the variety. This was weak. We'll definitely come back to Chuck E Cheese. We love it here. But NEVER again for their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"SMALL BUT CLEAN LOCATION  Not the best Chuck E, but memorable because it was the first time my daughter has ever been to.  For that, I will be grateful.  Super nice and accomodating staff/service, and it was very clean.  It's small, and when I went on a Saturday at 11am -- there were no shows at all of Chuck E...boo.  He did make one floor appearance, and we got some adorable photos with my daughter.  Her favorite part of the day, meeting the \"Chuck E\".  So, the fact that I ran around to keep an eye on her, spent a quarter for 20 second of an arcade game (times 40), and kept track of all my little one's tickets...Chuck E is the best part?!  What about Dadd-E?"}
{"text":"4-yr-old grandson/gramma heaven on a Monday afternoon between 1:00-4:30! I think we had MAYBE 12 other kids to share the place with!  We even found parking in the shade...which was great given he triple-digit temperatures!!  Pizza was good! It's a larger store with the full compliment of animated characters to put on \"the show\" and the big screen to watch for a little resting time while eating and between gaming!  Large overhead crawling tube/slide. Many games for little ones. Things seemed clean and didn't see any games out-of-order.  Loved the \"Chuck E Cheeses Sketchpad\"! Gave us a sketch that was a keepsake for Gramma!!"}
{"text":"A smaller store than I've been to in other towns...but despite that and all the company from birthday parties on a Saturday night, I had great fun with my 4-yr-old grandson. Lots of age-appropriate games for the little guys...and the tube to crawl around in and slide down was one of his favorites!"}
{"text":"Our son enjoys going here for the play area.  We had a coupon for $20 we got a 1 large topping pizza, 20 tokens and 2 drinks.  The pizza actually was not that bad.  I did feel little dirty there though with all the kids running around barefoot.  It's also interesting how you can't enter until you and your family get stamped.  I guess it's to make sure you're child doesn't get kidnapped!  The manager there was extremely nice and very polite.  That's a huge plus right there.  Every now and then the employees will come out and throw tickets in the air for kids to collect.  Those tickets go towards prizes they can \"buy\" at the prize counter."}
