{"text":"Great breakfast. Awesome staff. Will be back for sure. Unexpectedly awesome food. And gluten free. Yes."}
{"text":"A big fan of this place, how could you go wrong with a cute cafe with such reasonable prices?  Love that it's a family run restaurant and it's wonderfully situated in Kensington.  You get more than a deal, so much food for around $5!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place, I love it so I keep going back. Big size breakfast for such a low price and the staff is great."}
{"text":"It was 11am and looking for breakfast after a hospital appointment. We found this little cozy restaurant with a big sign that said: BREAKFAST ALL DAY. This was the place I was looking for. Three eggs, home fries, salad and toast at $4.50. I am coming back soon..."}
{"text":"Great food! Friendly hosts! Great prices. One of the best brunch places in the area. Greak salad breakfast is next level"}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto for about a week from the US, and I came to Our Spot for breakfast on my last day. Had a BELT with cheese, and after going to a lot of great restaurants, this was probably my top meal of the week. Just a damn good breakfast sandwich- no frills but a ton of good stuff. Great service. Good vibes. Awesome a local place. Definitely stop by for a solid meal."}
{"text":"Good: this place is CHEAP. Their all-day breakfast starts at $4.50. The service was fast, the lima beans were delicious.   Bad: The 'salad' that comes with the breakfast is just iceberg lettuce, two slices of tomato, and a tiny bit of feta cheese. Really not a salad by any means. But for the cheap price, I forewent it.  Great location in Kensington Market."}
{"text":"A cute, family-run restaurant in the heart of Kensington. So it's a great location, and nice quaint vibe. Went for Sunday brunch. As others have said: definitely don't come if you're in a rush. Time to order is quick, but we waited quite a while for the food (which was okay because I was there with a friend to chat). During the week or off-peak times you'll most likely be served quickly, as other reviews have stated. Just depends when you're there.  Covered patio seating in the back looked nice & relaxing. Had a nice, young male server who was polite & prompt when taking our order. Gave nice suggestions when I informed him I was vegetarian.  That being said: not many vegetarian options, but the Greek omelette is a good choice & you can get a lentil side (instead of homefries) which was tasty & packed with protein. The omelette was cooked well, but could use some flavour and/or spices."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe with good breakfast/lunch. Generous portions. Loved the home fries and gyro. Staff was friendly too."}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic staff and a sweet location. Everything is good, but I really like the breakfast with peameal bacon and Lima beans on the side.   I come back again and again, and the food is consistently great."}
{"text":"My favourite brunch spot! Food is fresh, price is right, service is friendly.  Small-ish space, gets busy and full very quick, so get there early (before 11am)!"}
{"text":"My husband I just wasted 45 minutes in this restaurant. After a suitable weekend table wait of 15 minutes - we were seated.  After waiting for another 30 minutes without coffee or water or hello - we were told she would \"come to us next\" (after a table that arrived after us) needless to say, we allowed 2 more minutes and left. People seemed nice enough but - beyond acceptable. Won't return."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place. Food is great and it's cheap too. Only drawback is that it gets pretty busy on weekends, especially during the summer. I gave it 5 stars anyways"}
{"text":"After perusing the kensington market we were up for some lunch, and this seemed like a nice spot. The menu was very reasonably priced and the place was packed despite how warm the resturant was, so we decided to check it out.   We went to the back patio area to eat where we sat at a communal table with two other people seated there as well. The tables are large so you don't have to interact with the other diners unless you so choose. The patio area was covered so it was still very warm, but there was a nice breeze blowing in every once in a while.  Our waitress was friendly enough. While we were ordering our drinks, however, we found out there were very few options. My family and I all ended up with ginger ale despite desiring some different things, but it was no big deal.   I orderes just a plate of spicy homefries with cheese, as I wasn't feeling too hungry. The food came quickly and I was greeted with a very generous portion of home fries. The homfries looked delicious, but as far ad taste goes, they were nothing special. They tasted like boiled potatoes that had just been thrown in a pan with some spices and cheese. Not exactly what I think of when I hear homefries, and they sat kind of heavily in my stomach, but for the price I can't complain too much. My fellow diners ordered the breakfast which looked delicious, were generously portioned and also very cheap.  If youre looking for a lot of decent cheap food, I would definitely recommend our spot."}
{"text":"I go to this place at least once a week because it is seriously delicious, for sure affordable. The staff is amazing and sweet and friendly. The options they have are great. Their gryo is perfection and full of flavor. They're breakfast is just the right amount of grease and comfort. The Greek food they have is also awesome. This is one of my favorite places in the city, I suggest you go there ASAP.   So yummy!!"}
{"text":"This place is very small and cozy, but what I love most is that you really get such great food for the price!   Also, its a family-owned place, and we always make a point to come out and support the owners who we've gotten to know, every time we're in Kensington :).   Best breakfast place in town, hands-down, if you are looking for a simple, down-home breakfast!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast on a rainy Saturday morning so it was pretty packed but I was able to get a seat in the patio. The portion size was surprising. I ordered the typical breakfast meal with home fries and a side of pancake. It was a lot of eggs and home fries which is basically chunks of potatoes. The salad and fruit it came with was alright. Just a chunk of lettuce and watermelon. The brown bread I ordered was nicely toasted and buttered. The pancake was huge. Bigger than my hand.. Overall it was a very nice place to get a quick breakfast fix before exploring town."}
{"text":"Had the gyro in a Pita. It was very tasty. The gyro was seasoned perfectly, I  really enjoyed it. My husband had the standard breakfast plate which tasted as good as it looked. Absolutely delicious! A good place to come for a good meal."}
{"text":"It's great...there's really nothing more to say!!!...you want a good breakfast or lunch at a decent price?....this is the place....just go!"}
{"text":"This is my new go to place in Kensington market. I'm in the neighborhood a lot and recently noticed that this location was being renovated so I made a mental note to check it out once opened, and I'm glad I did.  I've been here 4 times in the last 2 weeks, I usually go for breakfast, it is very good and cheap. They also have various daily specials, I tried the chili and it was fantastic. They also make a great latte.  This is a small local shop, I love supporting places like this especially when the owners are this friendly and attentive. Service is very quick."}
{"text":"Nice place for a simple breakfast if you're in the area- nothing worth making a trip for, but good nonetheless .  The eggs are well-cooked, the home fries are excellent and the coffee/tea is good.   The service is great, all of the food arrived quickly and none of our orders were messed up. The ambience is an interesting mix of a diner and a hole in the wall (in a good way.)"}
{"text":"The staff here are absolute darlings. They're cute, alternative, and cheerful. The covered back patio is great- I went here this morning in the rain and didn't get wet!  Breakfast was really good and came up to about 5$. I had three eggs, a salad, home fries, a delicious Lima bean dish made with tomato sauce, carrots, and celery, and toast. Gluten free toast available at no extra charge! I opted for the turkey bacon for an extra 2$, and was glad I did. My dining partner said it was much better than the bacon (which was also great!)  My only complaint was that the coffee tasted kind of weird today. Yesterday it was good though so maybe it was an off batch or something.   I hope \"our spot\" will stick around for a while- it's got everything that the other breakfast spots in Kensington Market lack."}
{"text":"Went looking for a cheap spot for brunch in Kensington today and after walking out of two places due to extreme indecision we happened upon Our spot. We'd already passed it but couldn't decide whether or not to go in.   We eventually made it back there and paid $4.50 each for the nicest breakfast I've had in Toronto so far. And I'm Irish - I know a good breakfast. Home fries, eggs cooked to order, lovely toast and some salad. Apparently they run out of home fries all the time so get there early!! Only complaints was that my eggs werent done medium as requested, more soft. So cheap, lovely staff and great quality food for the price. Will definitely be back for Sunday brunch!!"}
{"text":"What good is a breakfast place that does eggs and hashbrowns poorly?  The eggs were bland and also tiny, but the bigger sin was the super soggy almost bitter potatoes. They were orange and really resembled baby food. It took a while to be served and was a loud crowded place, but that's to be expected and usually comforting in that area. Points for the other proteins, the bacon and sausage were crispy and flavorful. The salad that came as a side would have been pleasant but didn't have any dressing. Over all it has a lot of potential but for somewhere that styles it self as a Sunday brunch hotspot it has a fatal flaw with the mushy taters. Maybe try the lima beans instead?   *Only tried the Standard Breakfast plate."}
{"text":"A good breakfast place!  Ordered the full breakfast. Comes with eggs salad home fries bread. Was good enough! Nothing special.  Weekends can involve waiting."}
{"text":"I adore this place so much. The food is fantastic and the service is even better. Wish I could give more stars!"}
{"text":"Laid back restaurant with affordable prices. I've heard good things about their breakfast but what I recommend is their chicken club sandwich for lunch. It may be some secret mayo but it's really tasty."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town with my friend. We walked in and got a great two top with a view of the street. There was a coat stand right next to the table which was ideal for our bags and jackets. Our waitress whose name I forgot was so kind as to try three different outlets for my cell phone charger when it wouldn't work. When we realized it was broken, she was able to direct us to a store just down the street that was quite affordable. Excellent customer service at this place.   The food itself (buttermilk pancakes, toast, tea) was also excellent. Very generous with their condiments such as maple syrup, milk, and butter. The food was exactly what we wanted and was extremely reasonably priced. We paid close to $5 for one pancake, one serving of toast, and one tea. It sounds like a small thing but a similar breakfast always costs us $10 or more elsewhere. Finding such a reasonable price in downtown Toronto was my favorite part of the trip.  Would definitely come here again every chance I get - I told my family members about this place and they were just floored. Hopefully I can drum up a little more business for this place because they really deserve it."}
{"text":"For some reason, the service at Our Spot was decidedly apathetic. Although this could've been due to a busy rush earlier that morning, it still felt unfriendly, which was unfortunate.  The Greek feta potato omelette plate was enormous; definitely big enough for two people to share. The gyros on a plate, however, was the reason for this poor review. I know it's a cheap dish, but I didn't expect two slices of tomato, a few pieces of wilted lettuce, and a plate of gyros in a puddle of grease.   Tip: If you're really hankering for gyros, order pita bread with it."}
{"text":"Delicious traditional brunch! Super cheap! And they have gluten-free bread :-)"}
{"text":"Super affordable breakfast with really good bacon. But they only have breakfast potatoes NO FRENCH FRIES. I am a huge advocate for French fries with brunch and was a bit disappointed!! This place gets pretty busy but definitely one of the best and CHEAPEST options in Kensington for a classic breakfast. French fries would make it five stars!"}
{"text":"First time in Toronto and needed breakfast. Actually planned to go to a different restaurant but they hadn't opened yet and Our Spot was a few stores down, so instead of waiting we ate there.  The place is small so seating is cramped. They do have an outdoor area that I didn't see but I'm sure it's nice with good weather. Everything I saw being brought out looked delicious! I got the egg sandwich and LOVED it. They have a small coffee selection as well so you can get your morning fix.  Once your bill comes be sure to pay at the front. We waited about 15 minutes to pay our bill and when we finally asked the lady said to pay up front. Now we know!"}
{"text":"In a city of $14 omelettes and 45-minute waits for breakfast, this Spot beckons like a beacon in the night (see what I did there?).  Decor is no-frills, but they have a lovely and hidden back patio.  While it can get busy on weekends, I've never had to wait for a table.  Staff is delightful and efficient and is always coming round with more coffee.    In the tradition of old-school greek-style Toronto diners, this place offers you basic breakfasts, along with greek salad (better than many I've had in greek restaurants), hummus, pita, etc.  The menu is small but has lots of great options.  The three egg breakfast comes with a pile of home fries, toast, a bit of salad and fruit and is CHEAP (I believe $5.99).  Omelettes are delicious and huge ($8.99) and the homefries are home-made and always crispy (the amount of bad homefries I've had in Toronto is terribly sad).    And yesterday, I ate the creamiest, tastiest lima beans I've ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth.  I almost hesitated to review them because I wanted to keep them a secret but they deserve all the business they can handle."}
{"text":"Our Spot is solid breakfast place in the heart of Kensington Market. It's an unassuming restaurant which I have walked past on many occasions, but recently noticed it's positive reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  The staff are very friendly and the service is prompt. Our food came quickly and was very hot. I found the home fries a bit tasteless and the fried eggs somewhat watery, but for the price you can't go far wrong. The service and friendly staff more than make up for it.   There is a small patio at the back which we didn't notice until we had sat down inside, but will definitely check it out next time we return.  Solid four stars."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfasts. Much of the offerings sound simple- eggs/omelettes with toast, home fries, sides of meat etc- but the preparation is incredible. So much better than the decor lets on."}
{"text":"I'm forever looking for a spot where breakfast is not going to cost a ridiculous amount. I found this gem today at \"Our Spot\" on Kensington Market. I have nothing but great things to say, our waiter was excellent, our coffee kept flowing, an actual huge bottle of water was left on the table at our disposal. I had a breakfast sandwich and a regular coffee, refilled three times, all for less than six dollars! My friend had a delicious omelette, a flavored latte and fresh orange juice, so she paid a little more but was also very happy with her choices. They left us alone to talk and eat in peace, never felt rushed for occupying the table, even after we were long finished eating. I highly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast with my wife when we were here for a Toronto weekend getaway. Food was amazing, great service, generous portions, incredible value, cozy atmosphere, what's not to like? 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast joint!  Everything is cooked from fresh ingredients, including freshly squeezed orange juice.  I had the veggie omelet and my wife had \"the Greek\".  Both of us went with the Lima beans and absolutely loved them.  Very interesting section of town with lots of little shops.  Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Great food and great value. Standard breakfast with 2 pancakes was plenty for 2. Window seats are great for a view of Kensington. Busy during peak weekend brunch times."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing. Our Spot is the only spot, seriously good food. This place is absolutely awesome. The food is great, the price is bang on and the service is unmatched. If you want to really enjoy a meal in the Market then go to Our Spot."}
{"text":"Perfect economical breakfast joint! A *ton* of good food for extremely reasonable prices, efficient service, and a comfy setting."}
{"text":"Our Spot is the most recent restaurant in this spot. Nicely redecorated with a homey look and feel, I hope this turns into a enduring breakfast spot that opens early that locals and early rising tourists can rely on. All the right elements are in place. Good coffee can be found anywhere, but good trad breakfasts are elusive, especially before the brunch hour. The bacon or pea meal and eggs are perfect! The building has always been hot and stuffy, best enjoyed in the cool fall breezy days. Or just hang just outside on the sidewalk bench as they even serve you there - so nice!"}
{"text":"Wow, So much breakfast for so little price and it's delicious too! I've came here twice now, and I'm a little surprised I haven't been here more often.   They have two options for their main breakfasts which might seem odd but they are so customizable that you can never go wrong. They also have lunch/breakfast sammys if you're feeling like something else.   My only upset is that they don't have any juice! Don't get me wrong I love coffee but sometimes you just need some OJ in the AM, y'know?  Also major plus: they have a back patio for the warmer months!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast food. Nothing super fancy or innovative, just your basics done well, though there were some Greek items on the menu. I always ask for my eggs over medium and they actually got them right (a lot of places will just serve you overeasy anyway).  The portions were generous, especially considering the prices, and the service was fast."}
{"text":"Meh  This place has an awesome location, dirt cheap prices, and friendly staff.  But I'm sorry, that's where it ends.   They serve up standard breakfast items that weren't done very well, nothing unique, and very slow.  To elaborate, the homefries were more like warmed potato, salad was lettuce and two thin slices of tomato sprinkled with feta, and it took 30mins from sit down till food.  Fast, better, or cheaper. Pick two?  This place was just cheap.    **seeing how everyone else seems to find this place fine. I'll be coming back to give it a second shot."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast! Home fries and Greek feta cheese omelette stand out the most for me~ Affordable and very filling. The place is always busy, it's best to go around 1pm to avoid the lunch rush. Theres a patio in the back if you prefer to dine outside."}
{"text":"Arrived 8am on a Tuesday morning. Staff were friendly, food came fast, and it was delicious and cheap. Can't ask for anything else. I arrived starving and ordered the $6.75 Greek (Greek salad, 3 eggs any style, home fries, toast, and orange wedge) +$1.00 lima beans. It definitely hit the spot!   A handful of customers came in to take out and there were a bunch of regular customers who the staff knew on a first name basis. I'd come back (:"}
{"text":"I wanted to eat some classic hole-in-the-wall food, and this place delivered.  Eggs = delicious. Meat = just the right amount of greasy. Potatoes = filling and hyper palatable. Toast = the right amount of toastedness.  Best of all, cheap too."}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere, delicious food, great service. You can also find GF options on the menu. 5/5!"}
{"text":"We came to Kensington Market to try this breakfast place last Sunday. We got there right before 10am and the place was packed. Similar to a lot of the places in Kensington, seating is somewhat limited. Thankfully, we only waited 10 minutes for a table to clear but we could see that a lineup was forming behind us.   The restaurant is long and narrow with tables on the right while the counter and open kitchen is on the left. There's a few seats by the window with a nice view into the street. Just be aware that the open kitchen creates a smokey haze inside the restaurant.   The menu is divided into breakfast dishes, egg benedicts, omelettes, breakfast sandwiches, lunch sandwiches and vegetarian options.   We went for the Standard Breakfast with added sausage and bacon and the Meat Lovers Breakfasts. I ordered a side of Lima Beans on a tomato sauce. You have a choice of eggs and bread (white, brown or rye). There's also different options that you can add for an extra charge.   The dishes came fairly quickly and as the pictures indicates, portion sizes are generous. We all enjoyed our breakfast although it was a bit salty. Prices were reasonable.   I do want to come back and try their sandwiches.   Recommended.  #36 of 2018"}
{"text":"Breakfast was decent and economically priced.  Staff was friendly.  Only weird thing was that it felt like we were eating in an oven!  It was a particularly warm afternoon but there was no fan, no air conditioning (maybe it broke?)  Eating and sweating wasn't the best time.  On top of that, no toilet paper or paper napkins in the washroom....so.....for those reasons, no strong desire to come back."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, I didn't think Lima beans could taste this good!  I enjoyed a hearty and inexpensive breakfast here the other day. They have a pretty straightforward breakfast and lunch menu. The standard breakfast comes in around $5 and the potato omelette around $8. You can add ham, sausage, ham, gyro etc at an additional cost. As I mentioned, give the Lima beans a try, the tomato sauce it's prepared in is very flavourful.   The staff here is friendly and attentive. And the food was served promptly. Definitely a nice, casual spot to grab breakfast and they have a nice little patio in the back."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast called the standard. Make sure you add the gyro. All for under $10 including bottomless coffee. I challenge anyone to find a better breakfast deal in the city!"}
{"text":"Been here twice for breakfast. Food is decent, although I found my eggs overdone. Staff here are nice but the kitchen is ridiculously slow. The ventilation at the restaurant is also terrible. The place is always smokey as its an open kitchen. I found I had a little trouble breathing."}
{"text":"Here is how close you may find yourself to Paris, in Toronto. This sweet spot is cozy, it is bustling, and the vegetarian omelette is a tasty pairing to those gluten free bread.   Great spot to bring a new date. Would not recommend layering too much for your shirts and pants, shoes and hair, scarves and hat will soak in all that cookery scent and when you depart you might just get the... Mmm, you smell like brekky! from a stranger on the TTC."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch restaurant! The prices are very good, and the food tastes homemade. There are some nice Greek options and the portions in general are very big. I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"A great breakfast/brunch place hidden in the Kensington Market. Tried the Standard Breakfast: Generous portion of fries, eggs, bits of salad and fruits, for a low price of $5.95+ tax. Service is reasonably quick, clean interior (tough to find in Chinatown). Will never eat at Eggsmart again.  Our Spot is an unknown gem."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best breakfast places in town. No frills whatsoever. Been here 20+ times and haven't had a bad experience yet!"}
{"text":"This restuarant is a quaint all-day breakfast location in the heart of the Kensington Market. It was quite busy, and has a hidden patio in the back.  Overall, I would go back again. The portions are great, and the food itself is pretty good. I am bias as I love all-day breakfasts, so I always look forward to going to any all-day breakfasts.   The service was great as well. Very friendly."}
{"text":"went to our spot with me and my boyfriend, definately cute place to have brunch. Not a huge fan of the server when my boyfriend asked for substitution on the ham for bacon the server said no. and then she tried suggesting him to buy the other meal option and adding bacon for extra cost which comes up way more expensive. that whole ordeal just ruined the mood when dining in. The food was so-so. I wanted something sweet but there wasn't any. all savory stuff. Price is okay..."}
{"text":"One thing I miss about living downtown is coming here, I would come here with someone sometimes and sometimes I'll just come alone, id even come to grab take out when I worked out of the city. I would order them from Just-Eat when I had a job close by. The owners really know how to put a smile on peoples faces without even trying, I really want to be a regular again but... since moving back to Markham and working there as well.. I really don't think that's going to happen anytime soon or at all lol.   Food is amazing, never would I be hungry after a breakfast + gyro add on. Oh and fresh gyros in the morning, can't beat it ;) service is likewise; I love the home-y vibe spread through out the establishment, open kitchen so you know who is making your food and how. Substitutions from what I remember are fulfilled if it's not too over the top..   The space is a little crammed and it almost has a messy vibe to it but then again maybe that's why it's home-y to me, considering my place ain't always the tidiest.   Would love to have the owners move closer to me but \"Our Spot\" almost seems like it belongs in the Kensington Market"}
{"text":"We waited a good 15 minutes just for someone to bring us menus and take our drink order which you know, is about a Led Zeppelin song and a half longer than it should take. Luckily they made up for this slip-up with their low prices and monster portions. You're A-OK Owl Spot."}
{"text":"Wow, brilliant place for brunch. The portions are HUGE and prices are more than reasonable. The eggs are perfectly cooked, bread is toasty and buttery, everything is fabulous here! The wait was not too bad since we were lucky to avoid the lineup. Definitely a place to come back to!"}
{"text":"I had an overnight layover in Toronto and found this adorable and cozy breakfast spot. Super friendly service, free wifi for visitors, and delicious no frills breakfast. I had the vegetable omelet with rye toast which was serviced similarly to business class and was the perfect portion. I don't know if it's typical, but I was not refilled on water and I was dying of thirst after finishing my first carafe. Otherwise, the waitresses working were very friendly. I also LOVED the hot sauce options (as a visitor from Texas where we keep things pretty spicy)."}
{"text":"Place is clean and cute. Kinda hipster. I saw a few elder gentlemen eat here the morning I went and it seemed like a nice and relaxed place for them. The person at the desk was also very nice.   I ordered a standard breakfast combo with bacon, eggs, toast etc. I was also picking up breakfast for a friend so they were kind enough to do take out for me. They asked how I'd like my eggs done, gave me more than enough jam for the toast, and put ketchup for me in the bag for the potatoes. Overall very nice impression, would recommend dropping by for brunch."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of time, and it's a very quaint little place with great classic breakfast/brunch food.  It's a small place so if you're heading here on the weekend during prime brunch time, you can expect to wait a little (15-20 mins) before being seated.   Service is friendly and quick and the food is cheap and good! Highly recommend this place for brunch if you're in the Kensington market area."}
{"text":"Sooo good and server was so nice! For 6$ their breakfast special has a of content! Their 1.5$ pancakes alone are worth the visit. So perfect!"}
{"text":"This spot gets brownie points for being a breakfast place that is actually open on a Saturday morning at Kensington market!  It was bustling and busy, but we landed a cool outdoor backyard patio spot and our food came fairly quickly.  It's traditional, typical Canadian breakfast fare.  Bigger meal than what some of the uptown places offer - three solid, delicious sausages! The downside is that it was definitely overly buttered!"}
{"text":"Friendly, fast, delicious breakfast spot. Was crowded when we got there and an even longer line when we met. The waiter was funny and friendly, the food was super-good-greasy-spoon breakfast. Filling, cheap and interesting-- side of roasted Lima beans in a tomato base, side salad, side fruit, side bacon and 3 eggs-- all for about $7. See pics for breakfast, eaten breakfast, and menu"}
{"text":"Barely makes it to a three star because it's a good value. Nothing exemplary here and it's very popular nonetheless. I tried to figure this disconnect as I stood my twenty minutes in line.   The good: very reasonably priced breakfasts; has a lunch menu we didn't try. Really good service. Counter-culture ambiance.   The bad: inescapable noisiness, crowded, and you need to plentifully patient. Food is ok; nothing stellar but very reasonably priced.  This is not Denny's. If it wasn't for the wait, I'd probably go back. They really are working as fast as they can; they're friendly, it's not plush in any way, but at the end you'll probably be happy. The coffee is so-so."}
{"text":"Super cheap! Super good value! But you get what you pay for... This was probably the most simplistic, ratchet (in a good way) brunch I've ordered in a while. YES! Even more ratchet than Fran's, but I loved every bite of my $5 3-egg breakfast platter.   My friend and I came at around 10:30AM today (Tuesday) and it was pretty packed inside! We took the last table, but have no fear the client flow is relatively speedy, so the wait doesn't appear to be too long.  Venue- 2/5. One step away from fully resembling a Chinatown restaurant - pretty dirty and worn looking furniture and interior, but home-y and warm nonetheless, so why complain. Restrooms were pretty clean, even the men's.  Service- 5/5. Guy came to check on us 3 times and replaced my buttered toast with un-buttered toast when I requested. +++  Food- 2/5. No frills, but honest and freshly made. My friend ordered a BLT breakfast sandwich on rye bread. It was literally just a sandwich that you and possibly I can make. I ordered the 3-egg breakfast platter, which came with 3 eggs cooked however you want, salad with lots of feta cheese, home fries (I opted out), whole grain toast (buttered by default I guess), and a slice of navel orange.   Value- 6/5. Excellent for broke ass students like ourselves. My friend paid $4 and I paid $6. Not bad, not bad at all."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to this cute little nook place at Kensington Market since I had a huge craving for big breakfast. I managed to order this standard breakfast ($5.50 not including bacon $2.00 and cafe mocha $2.99) it was decent with friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Alright kids, buckle up because I'm going to paint you a word picture.  Let me start by saying that Our Spot is like home away from home. And like many homes, when you get home, you want your food done right and good.   I walk into this cozy place and I sit down, and I already know it's going to be a good time.  Service is fantastic, WIFI is available, the glasses are clean, the ketchup is full, the forks are nicely washed; you're home.   Anyway, I decide I'm feeling something fresh, maybe a sandwich. I get this Jerk Chicken sandwich, and I literally had to take a break from eating it to reflect on my life.  It has everything you want in the most phenomenal combination of taste you will ever enjoy. This smoky hot sauce, that's not too hot, but not too mild brings the Jerk chicken alive. The mayo in between and you're overwhelmed by the perfectly toasted texture of the coco buns.   Oh. My. God.   My eyes are finally open, I can see what I've been missing. If you're not busy today, or tomorrow do yourself a solid, hit up Our Spot, if you don't like it, I'll be a monkey's uncle."}
{"text":"This place is very deceiving on the outside. Once you go in, you'll want to sit on the back patio. It was so cute and our waitress we had was great. I forget what I ordered but the house dressing was amazing.  You get plenty of food so even if you think what you're ordering is small, it's not!"}
{"text":"Love this and can see it being a new favorite. Super friendly staff, coffee refills are endless and great diner styled food items on the cheap. I'll be back in no time!"}
{"text":"A small place in Kensington. The food was so good and so reasonably priced.  It was packed when I went and lucky for my friend and I, for a party of 2 it did not take long to get a seat. I would suggest coming in early. It was really nice and I would definitely love to visit again."}
{"text":"I had no idea that I loved lima beans before trying the eggs and beans breakfast. Delicious and inexpensive. Service was quick, efficient and friendly. Lots of free tables on a rainy Friday morning at 8:15am, but not empty.  I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Place is just excellent. Delicious food and very well served. Much better than I expected - initially I was wrong thinking it would be a place overrated as many many others in Kensinton Market. But this one really stands out. Really friendly staff. One of the best places to have a real american breakfast experience. Oh, and great prices too. Must go place (I'll be back for sure)."}
{"text":"First time for breakfast. Food and service excellent.  Great omelette, loved the lima beans. There was a line-up but it was worth the wait. I will definitely be back. Added bacon to the two big breakfasts with coffee, about $26 before tip."}
{"text":"The menu prices have changed, but the food was good, the service was great, and they even have almond milk for your coffee/tea. The only thing we didn't like was that there isn't a kitchen fan, and my jacket smelled like breakfast meats for hours after we left. But we would definitely go back for the good food and friendly faces."}
{"text":"Simple brunch for affordable price. The choice is limited but the plates are really generous! Eggs, bacon, salad or pancake... everything you need is there!"}
{"text":"Came back on a weekend on the earlier end of brunch, around 9:30-10am, and there were only a few tables left. It definitely gets much more packed around 11am, and the wait goes out the door then, so be sure to drop by early. Their brunch is solid - it's a busy, quick environment - the food is yummy (not overly greasy, and competitive priced) and their staff are super attentive. Just a note, your clothes and you will smell like breakfast even after you leave."}
{"text":"I was not a fan of this particular breakfast spot.   The waitress was nice enough but the food was pretty bland and the menu very limited. Also 2 of our orders came out wrong but they took so long to come out that I was starving and didn't want to wait any longer to fix it. We got the pemeal and egg sandwiches. They were fine but nothing special. Homefries are blah.  If you're looking for a really good breakfast with some morning cocktails, Templeton's is a much better choice. Wish we had gone there first..."}
{"text":"Very nice place for breakfast! Huge portions, but the food is so delicious so you might end up with eating too much, haha. The Lima beans are just too great to not to have!  The Americano is also very nice!"}
{"text":"I work in Kensington and there aren't a lot of breakfast options as hippies don't get out of bed before noon, obviously.  This place changed hands a few times and had a few misses before becoming Our Spot which is newly renovated and looks fantastic.  The owners are super nice and remembered my name having only met briefly a couple of times!  They are a lovely addition to our neighbourhood, and they make a damn fine (and filling) breakfast for $5.  I'm very picky about eggs, and they cook them exactly to order, a perfect over-easy which is definitely tough to find in Toronto.  Try the Lima beans, they're yummy!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Our Spot while walking around Kensington Market. After a long hangry wait, we were finally seated in the back patio at a communal table.   The brunch plates were delicious, not greasy, filling, and good value - more like a sampler plate because it had a little bit of everything. My husband's plate came with lima beans(!), which were a nice addition.  Why 3 stars? The service was slow and frustrating. Yes, it was busy (full house at 1PM and a line out the door), but the ordering process did not make sense. When our server took our drink orders, we were ready to put in our food order as well. He told us he couldn't take our food order yet until the people ahead of us put in theirs first. OK... so if those people took their sweet time sipping their coffee and needed more time to peruse the menu, did that mean we'd have to wait equally as long? Yes, that was how this place operated.  Basically our brunch was 45 minutes waiting in line + 20 minutes waiting to order + 20 minutes waiting for food before finally eating (5 minutes lol). Luckily, you pay your bill at the front counter/entrance (no need to wait for people ahead of you to pay first, phew)."}
{"text":"This is a super cute restaurant in Kensington market. I was there for brunch on a Sunday. It can get crowded and have a lineup in front. It's better to plan some queueing time.  Their brunch menu is quite cheap but with a very generous portion. There are options to add meat, or substitute potatoes for yogurt granola (healthier!). Definitely a great place for weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"Ordered the standard breakfast. $6.50. 3 eggs, salad, home fries and toast.   Asked for extra salad instead of the home fries.   Eggs were ordered over medium and were cooked perfectly.   Salad was delicious. Mixed greens, crumbled feta and tomatoes.   My only beef to pick was their toast. It was just plain toast. They could benefit by serving some artisanal options and charging slightly higher to balance out the minimal cost.   There was also a nice slice of grapefruit.   Service was excellent. Everybody wore a smile.   Although the place was super busy, the food arrived in a very reasonable time.   All in all a solid 4.5."}
{"text":"Food was a little salty for my liking but overall it was cooked well. Paying is kind of s hassle because you are in a very tight spot with basically you but on back of someone's head while they eat their food. Not sure if I would go back"}
{"text":"I'm a big breakfast fan and have been making my way around the hot spots in Toronto, but always find that there's a pretty big price tag attached to what my husband calls \"food you can make at home.\" That's not to say they're not great spots, but this is why I really liked \"Our Spot.\" I went with some girlfriends recently and enjoyed a really nice meal at a hugely competitive price! The staff was friendly and attentive, and after the first bite of omlette I new I'd be coming back. :)  UPDATE May 2014: I had to knock down my rating from 4 stars to 3-- after coming down around noonish on a Saturday for a late breakfast, my husband and I waited more than 45 minutes for our meal. Now, breakfast places are known for being relatively quick, and more to the point, we'd come down long past breakfast hours-- so this wait was really a surprise. Still, a staff member is sometimes sick and things get tight in the kitchen-- these things happen. What I would have appreciated as a customer is being told there would be a wait, or at least offered and apology or a complementary coffee: something to know that we weren't just being ignored. Our Spot-- I'd still like to come back, so please just remember to acknowledge your waiting customers. A smile and a soft apology go a long way to soothing impatient, hungry folks. :)"}
{"text":"Surprisingly, the only breakfast place open on a Monday at 8am in Kensington!   Seriously this place has one of the cheapest prices for breakfast in the area.  The food, value for your money, back patio, and friendly staff is what makes this spot so great.  I ordered a traditional with a side of sausages for an extra $2.  For $2, I was expecting small sausages, but I was surprised by the generous helping of four medium sized sausages.  My friend who ordered the bacon was also surprised by the size and amount of them.  Definitely a place to go to if you're looking for something cheap and hungry."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Breakfast all day but they were brilliant enough to add salads to make it unique. Staff friendly warm and engaging, atmosphere dinery with a home feel, but the food makes it. I highly recommend sitting in the back by the storage cases (it gets very crowded after 10 am on Saturday); I sat next to the case of oranges and it was almost like aroma therapy!"}
{"text":"Our Spot is my new favourite breakfast joint.  Ridiculous value and super friendly and prompt service.  Try the lima beans instead of the home fries. Delish!!!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is de-contracted, a thing that I  prefer in restaurants. I ordered the ham and cheese omelette; it was good. It comes with the usual salad and bread. The service is friendly. I would certainly come back.  The menu is long and many options and side orders.  I hope they stock their decaf americano supplies.  Arrive early on Sundays to avoid lineups., but it moved quickly.  They have a patio but we didn't get to the back."}
{"text":"This place has great value and great food.  Can't complain!   The homefries are amazing and a must try!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot with great food.   The house fries are delicious and highly recommended.  I got their breakfast sandwich, B.E.L.T. and it was a great size and the perfect amount of bacon.  Affordable. Staff is friendly and it gives a true small restaurant feel. They have a patio in the back, but we sat inside.  Located in the heart of kensington market and is a great place to stop amd grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Small floor space with some awkward seating but that is more than made up for with the friendliness of the staff. Servings are huge and very high quality and the coffee is bottomless. Enjoy."}
{"text":"great little breakfast spot. It's like everyone there knows each other and is just loving life. The breakfast was hearty and cheap (BELT sandwich) a simple sandwich on a plate. Just what I wanted, I didn't leave in a food coma, the sandwich was fresh and didn't taste like old pan grease (old pan grease = common at breakfast spots that don't clean there pans often while cooking). Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was fine. We did see that it was pretty full, people constantly coming and going. However, nothing amazing. the food was ok but pretty generic. The prices were good. Overall, I wouldn't hate to come here for breakfast but I don't think I'll be back. There's nothing that makes this place different or unique."}
{"text":"UberEats is almost always garbage for breakfast. But I was home sick and didn't want to make anything. Decided to try this place out. I got the meat lovers breakfast. First of all the price for that much food?? Unreal. Everything was still warm when it got to us even though our delivery guy was useless and didn't understand any of my direction and took forever getting upstairs. Everything was incredibly delicious, I told my boyfriend he could have half my meat before it got there because I really just wanted the ham and eggs, but no, i devoured everything. I'm highly impressed, and will definitely be ordering from this place again!!"}
{"text":"A solid place for breakfast. Definitely get a pancake! Our server suggested we get one for sharing, and it didn't disappoint. I got the veggie omelet, which was perfectly fine. Cute little diner!"}
{"text":"Quick service, nice menu, well priced! A new breakfast gem in Kensington Market. The standard breakfast is a staple. Great for groups of 4. The kitchen is open concept and you can see - and smell - your order being made. The restaurant is right next to the buchter's and across the street from Chocolate Addict. Prime location on Baldwin, just take the Spadina streetcar southbound/northbound to Nassau and walk for 2 minutes. Perhaps one of the best breakfast place near Chinatown. Very hip and young atmosphere with lots of natural light. They also do take-out.   I got the standard breakfast with sausage and pancakes. Delicious!  Tip: there's a secret patio at the back. Not advertised! Just ask."}
{"text":"I feel like there isn't an awful lot to say about this place - and I mean that in a good way.  They have an extremely simple menu (only two breakfast items), it's inexpensive, simple decor and it's popular. The place was pretty much packed when we went on a Saturday at around 2.30PM (it closes at 3).   The helpings were substantial, the food was good and the people were very friendly as well.   Definitely a place worthy of the name 'Our Spot'."}
{"text":"Go to brunch spot for the basics (eggs, potatoes, toast and salad). Always leaves us satisfied and coming back for more! Also, cannot beat the price for the quantity."}
{"text":"This place has delicious breakfast, but fills up pretty quick. Decent service. I particularly liked the gyros with my friend's breakfast that I picked off of. I don't typically eat gyros, so it was a nice change, and they do it well at Our Spot.   We sat in the back on the covered patio. It gets extremely hot there.. with no flowing air. It was just a friend and myself so we ended up sharing our table with a family. They were really nice. Because of the setup, your meal may end up more interactive if you're seated in the back."}
{"text":"You would never guess from the outside, it's on a small st near Chinatown. The food here is amazing and we'll priced! Plus the staff is very attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"Cheap and good breakfast. A lot of places these days charge around $10+ just for eggs and bacon so it's nice to go to a place under that ($4.50 for 3 eggs, toast, lima beans or homefries + $1.50-2.00 for bacon, sausage, or etc).   Service is fast and friendly. Although glasses for water could be larger for those feeling the effects of the night before lol.   Solid little neighbourhood joint!"}
{"text":"Great location, me and my business partner were visiting Toronto from New York and was mentioned this spot. Great portions and cheap price, the food was amazing. would go back."}
{"text":"Really cute breakfast spot in Kensington area! Found it through yelp and it was a great decision. The restaurant was really busy on Sunday morning so we decided to go on a Monday morning. Plenty of seating in the restaurant as well as on the patio. Perfect for a sunny day! Free wifi, really excellent wait staff and yummy eggs Florentine."}
{"text":"A super nice spot for breakfast! I truly enjoyed my time here with their well-prepared food and impressive service. The employees were nice and friendly as well. The portions here were decent at a good price to boot. Worth recommending this location to others."}
{"text":"Our Spot is a restaurant in the heart of Kensington Market. We were walking by and stopped for brunch here on a Saturday morning. We ended up waiting ~20 minutes to get seats in the back patio. The back patio has a colorful mural and interesting seating with benches. The only bad part of it was the lack of air flow.   The menu is pretty simple and straightforward. I was surprised to see how affordable the menu items were.   I ordered a standard breakfast with the spinach omelette, salad and home fries. I wasn't too amazed at the quality of the food - the eggs were bland and so were the home fries. They looked  amazing on everyone's plates so I was most excited to try those but they were mushy and tasteless. Finally, there was no dressing with the salad!   Overall, this is an average brunch place. I don't think I would go back again but given that it is so well rated by others, Im sure there are other menu items that are a hit! And for under 10$, it's also a great deal."}
