{"text":"We actually walked out of this restaurant. Now, it may have been that we went while they were transitioning from breakfast to lunch; however, a hotel restaurant needs to be better prepared for such transitions. The food MAY have been great but I never had a chance to taste it. The MAIN reason was a RUDE hostess, acting as though our concerns did not matter to her. Even if I had tasted the food and it was the greatest I have ever tasted, RUDE employees will NEVER get my return business."}
{"text":"Two restaurants share this space in the Mission Palms Hotel, Tempe:  Mission Grille, where we enjoyed lunch today, and Ha rry's Place. The MG dining room is spacious with attractive tables for four, or one can choose to eat in the pretty tree-shaded courtyard.  Since temp was 102 degrees, we opted for indoors and the welcome air conditioning.  A pleasant lady escorted us to a table and advised us that we could order from the menu or have the lunch buffet.  Took a quick peek at the latter and it looked very good to us.  Hot dishes consisted of trout almondine, grilled chicken, scalloped potatos au gratin and a mixture of green beans and baby carrots. A chef was carving beef, there were cold sandwiches, baked potato soup, salads and yummy desserts.  The items bore exotic names on cards but I cannot recall them.  We took small portions of each of the hot items, all were nicely presented and tasted very good.  Feature of desserts was a delicious, very moist carrot cake and a selection of petit fours.  Our waiter was efficient.  I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We enjoyed an outstanding Thanksgiving buffet with a wide array of menu items. All the basic turkey fare,but also peel and eat shrimp,salmon,prime rib,etc.  Because the weather was pleasant we were able to take advantage of the outdoor courtyard to enhance our experience. The price was more reasonable than other buffets and I highly recommend it.  The Mission Palms is right off Mill ave. as well."}
{"text":"I come to this place once a year for business, this year it hit an all time low for quality, our meals were so bad that we couldn't eat them! We tried not once but twice to have a meal here and both times things had to be sent back. Even though we talked to the so called manager nothing much was done for the really bad meals. We did receive credit for one meal but that was only one and after we had finished our 2 meals and the lady with us had to eat alone. Sorry but there are a lot of good places to eat well within walking distance. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Breakfast tasted good, but at one point the waitress never put our order in. We weren't in a hurry, so we weren't upset. It's just annoying, given you have like 1 job as a waitress and you don't do it you know? Had like an unplanned, 1 hour breakfast. 

We stayed at the hotel and had an okay stay, but in all honesty, this breakfast didn't make our stay much better. 

TLDR: did not impress (given the hotel as such a good reputation)"}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet here and all the food was pretty good. The seating area was modern and comfy but no booths. The dessert selection was Ok and worth an extra star.I do prefer a lot of the other buffets that are in this price range and will not return. why pay more than wandering horse buffet fot half as good?."}
{"text":"Great place! Service is awesome. Try the tacos- perfect! Table side guacamole is the best. Plate sizes are great for sharing. Nice place for date night or meeting with a group of friends. We are here on vacation. Can not wait to return!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast buffet here. This is a hotel breakfast type of place. Pretty limited selection. Their hot items were: bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, pancakes, and cheese blintz. They also had omelette and waffle station. 4 kinds of cereals, oatmeal with topping station, fruits and juices.  

POSITIVE: no long wait, buffet so no long wait for your food. 

Negative: very limited selection."}
{"text":"You know what parents just Looooove?  They just love it when the hostess counts the party of six and says \"four?.....and two kids.\"  That's right because since kids don't have credit cards they aren't technically a full human in the eyes of a restaurant. 

Then we sit down and we're given FOUR menus.  Not only is my daughter old enough to read, she's old enough to know when she's been rudely blown off.

Then there came FOUR glasses of water.  She asked, \"Daddy, how come they didn't give me a water?\"  I gave her my glass and told her she should assume that they rudely forgot to bring MY water.  

After about 45 minutes of waiting in frustration and embarrassment with no food, we all got up, paid for our coffee and left.  \"Oh but your food is ready now.\" Sorry, I was insulted when we walked in the door and after 45 minutes of stewing in insult am too fed up to complete the purchase.  If you can't scramble eggs in 45 minutes, I'll find someone else who can."}
{"text":"My family and I have frequently enjoyed the Grille on our ASU football visits at the Mission Palms.  Donna and her staff typically go above and beyond typically restaurant service with a familiar personal flair, which keeps us coming back. Convenience, quality, and a friendly smile make this our home base while away from home!

{"text":"Went with 3 co-workers to the Wednesday lunch buffet, which always features Prime Rib.

The star of the show is the Prime Rib.  It was DELISH and was the main thing that makes this worth the $15 buffet charge.

There was a sandwich station with various cold cuts to build your sammiches, a salad bar, and a \"hot food\" bar with 4 different \"meat/veggie\" combinations.  All those were just so-so, nothing to wow anyone.

But the Prime Rib Carving Station was TOP notch.  Worth every penny of the cost.

The desserts were fairly mundane (brownies, pecan pie, 4 kinds of cookies) with the exception being a Strawberry Cheesecake Parfait which was delumptious.  

We will likely be going back on future Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Welp what can I say ? I'm beyond disappointed in this place. They've always had a great Easter and Mothers day brunch, until this year. They did raise the prices over the years, understandable. Prices went from 32.50 a head for the brunch to 50 a head but they got rid of all the delicious dishes!!!Last year this place seemed to be going down but this year it's hot rock bottom, THE ABSOLUTE WORST. The room remains decorated the same as always (hint, time to update your decor) bowls glued to the wall, really ??? Hash browns with motz cheese were beyond burnt. The short ribs, burnt and dry. No leafy salad either. Deserts were super sweet. No one manned the omelet bar. Service by the busers, HORRIFIC! Thank goodness we had a great server. Sadly though the server could not help with the poor quality and poor preparation of their food. We will NOT BE RETURNING."}
{"text":"This is located within the Tempe Mission Palms hotel. This is where lunch was served while I was in my training. Many options. Salad bar was great! Lots of veggies! A lot of the warm food was greasy or creamy. There was always 1 option that was pretty healthy. The staff is great and friendly. Very on the ball when it came to serving us. Dessert was also awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Stayed here for 3 nights.  Hotel employees were great.  Called room service my last night for 30 minutes and no answer.  Unfortunatly I called the front desk after room service closed and was told they could not me.  Will not stay here again for that reason alone  ."}
{"text":"This place is the best American buffet in the phoenix area.  The quality of food you get here is comparable to good wedding food, fathers/mothers day buffet, or other banquet type events.  All this for only $15 which includes a drink and a wide selection of desserts.  

I go here once a month and the staff is always friendly and very  professional

*insider tip: mention you are a culinary club member and they will give you an additional 20% off."}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast and gladly it was paid! They have a buffet but because I was with some ASU guests I had to stick to the menu. It is not a big menu, but still has a little bit of something sweet, salty, healthy, high carb, veggie.

I had the Greek omelet and it was more than enough! the potatoes were a bit salty, but the rest was just a good combination. Employees are really courteous and helpful!"}
{"text":"One of the restaurant options located within the Mission Palms Hotel. I'm pretty sure this is where the room service comes from too. I had room service twice during my stay and had no complaints there.

After finally finding a spot that didn't have bird dropping remnants, I dined in the outside corridor area. I only dined at the actual restaurant once for lunch, for the lunch buffet. The offerings on the buffet were a bit different than what I find on other buffets in my part of the country, but that's common to find while traveling practically across the country. I enjoyed the salad and the wrap station... with options that consisted of deli meat, cheeses, and a few extras. 

Service was awesome, which can sometimes be rare when you choose a buffet option. I never had to wonder where my next refill would come from."}
{"text":"I had one meal while staying at the Tempe Mission  Hotel. It was the Saturday morning brunch at the Mission Grille. The restaurant is very clean and the workers were exceptionally attentive and polite. The buffet was nicely laid out with a wide variety to choose from hot and cold cold cereals,breakfast meats,different egg selections, breads and danish. My favorite was the omelette bar. its the type were you select the filling and a cook completes the omelette. The restaurant is set up so you can eat indoors or out on a beautiful tree covered patio, Pretty romantic for a breakfast brunch. It was a great bargain too, approximately 16.00 per person. I liked, I recommend it and if ever in the Phoenix area I'm coming back"}
{"text":"A great restaurant staff! They go above and beyond for their customer.
Try the buffet you will not be disappointed.
Bacon is cooked to perfection. Fruit is fresh and the seating is perfect for large groups."}
{"text":"First of all, I'll give my waitress (Phyllis) and other staff a FIVESTAR.  

Day 1: The breakfast buffet including the omelet simply did not come close to living up to the $15 price tag.  Fruit was tasty and fresh, and there were many more (high carb) food options.  Clean and cool looking place, stylish and has fabulous outdoor dining option. Perhaps ordering off menu is the way to go for breakfast.

Days 2 & 3:  similar experience with breakfast as day 1, but to be fair I eat very low carb foods, so did not try the pastries and waffles, which looked terrific!  I do eggs and bacon better at home.

The lunch buffet was awesome!  Wonderful choices for almost anyone, including gluten-free options.  The salad was fresh, they had soups, nachos, a sandwich bar, and ice cream sundae bar.  Everything I tried was great tasting (I loved the swordfish).

Again, I eat healthy, low-carb foods and there was plenty of wonderful options for me."}
