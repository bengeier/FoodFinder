{"text":"First of all a reuben sandwich shouldn't be cold. Ordered potato salad as an extra side which ended up being the best part of the meal. Perhaps the worst reuben I've ever had very dry lacking enough dressing to add some flavor to the crumbled corn beef. 
The waitress took my glass for a refill and never came back.
Another person in our group order a steak with baked potato when opening the potato it was rotted black inside. Never seen anything like that before.
Not worth going back ever even if the meal is free."}
{"text":"I rarely submit a bad review but I walked out sick to my stomach. My boyfriend and I were ill for hours. I'm sure the desserts are great, but the food was terrible, and I should have known by just looking at it when it was served."}
{"text":"food was lousy, cold and smaller portions for the price.  The place was undergoing renovations drywall and paint unfinished.  The worst of all everybody was freezing in the dining area, we had to ask 3 times to turn up the heat.  I will never step foot back into this place not worth the hype - I do not care how long they have been around!"}
{"text":"The food is and always has been outstanding.  They always give you great sized portions for an unbeatable price.  I'm not sure what those negative comments are about; I've never ever had a bad meal at Simons.  

Simon's is in the process of renovating and it's looking great!  I applaud them for their efforts to upgrade their restaurant while maintaining a quality establishment that is a staple in this community."}
{"text":"Dried out Corned Beef.....stale rye bread that you can't chew......dinners comprised of flash frozen food from a cardboard box. Get a Stouffer's or Boston Market frozen dinner and you got the same thing. Who loves ya baby?................nobody that knows what good food is that's for sure."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money.  Asked the server if the turkey dinner was freshly cooked or processed deli counter turkey. She told me it was freshly cooked at the restaurant....wrong.  It was processed. The dinner, along with my wife and sons dinner of brisket, was swimming in a pool of gravy.  The bread for the hot opened turkey sandwich had corned beef on it.  That was a little odd since I had a TURKEY dinner.  Might this bread have been reused.  I hope not.  Matzo ball soup was good.  That seemed fresh.  Do not recommend."}
{"text":"\"Family Dining\" maybe?  Not sure totally, but the food is good.  This is the place we go almost after every Saturday morning run.   \"Zandy's Choice\" is a favorite (ham and cheese omelet).  Still possible to eat healthy if you are careful."}
{"text":"Well known for their corned beef. Great food excellent service what more could u ask?!"}
{"text":"Two most recent visits left a bad taste in my mouth both literally and metaphorically. Last time made my whole group sick. This most recent was just awful. A bad meal doesn't make a bad resteruant, but a such a bad impression and overall dissapointment sure can, especially as a repeat occurance. 

I have been to Simons quite a few times. The matzo ball soup was good, and they have good Rubens, pretty tasty desserts. But take care not to stray off the things they're \"known for.\" 

One of the first times I went my friend had a killer scrod sandwich. Just to die for. So craving fish we went back a month or so later. Got the scrod and a seafood platter. It was inedible. Bland as can be, greasy, I don't even know what happened. They were so disappointed and the service was terrible. We all ended up sick from it. Thinking it was just the one time we decided to try again a few months later. Soup was cold. Food was cold. Sides were cold. I had the salmon that was on special, which was tasty, but it was served on these fake frozen vegetables that grossed me out to the point of thinking the salmon's taste was kind of a moot point. And again awful service. Noone even asked about our meal. 

Welp sorry Simons. I gave you the benefit of the doubt a few too many times it seems. There are better places for the money. I can name 2 within walking distance."}
{"text":"my boyfriend had the veal here.  He went home and immediately got sick!When I called to tell them to be aware of the veal, the woman's response was \"you can't prove anything!!!!\"  Totally not compassionate! Never eating there again."}
{"text":"My husband and I ahd not been to Simons in along time. I remember it as an expanded deli..with booths and tables in a quaint atmosphere. TOO BAD what we found was a DARK DINGY restaurant, with wires hanging down from the ceiling, with miss matched chairs..with our table being stablized by a folded piece of cardboard...eating utensils on the floor under tables..and I would have overlooked that if the food had been the same...SADLY it was not! I was poorly presented..my husband had finished his sandwich and mine had yet to arrive at our wobbly table.I was sooo disappointed in what it had become because I remember what it had been. Sorry but I will not be returning nor recommending Simons to anyone."}
{"text":"Decent place with decent specials but noting to write home about.  Appears to be consistent quality \"home made' type of food.  Only real complaint was I ordered country style ribs and got spare ribs with what appeared to be a jarred type of sauce."}
{"text":"My husband had been trying to get me to try Simons for the longest time and we finally went there on Friday night.  I knew this would be no Ken Stewarts type fancy place, but it was the night before the Akron Marathon and my husband wanted carbs.  They didnt dissappoint!  I usually love the Waterloo restaurant in Akron for food like this, but Simons has alcohol.  Its a Waterloo with alcohol. And that makes all the difference for me.  They have Great Lakes Dortmunder on draft.  We got the Matzo Ball soup and it was very good! I'm not a soup fan but the orange sized dumpling in the soup was excellent.  I also got the Turkey Reuben and the Pumpkin Cheesecake.  Could have been the best cheesecake I've ever had.  If you aren't expecting a fine dining experience and want a place with good food and beer, this is the place to go!  Our waitress was excellent and the decor was cute too."}
{"text":"Great soup, great salads, great desserts ! Awesome place for good family friendly food. Be sure to get the matzo ball soup!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I like their selection, their service, as well as the atmosphere. 

Simon's has two sections, one more of a bar area and the other the dining room area. I have eaten in both sections and found the service to be very good. They have a good selection of beers and mixed drinks. 

I always leave with leftovers, in part because they are so generous with their portions and the other part is that they pop their own popcorn that I snack on when I get there!! 

I am a vegetarian and LOVE their veggie sand which as well as their salads and soups. This is the kind of place where you can bring even the pickiest of eaters and everyone can find something they like. 

Their desserts are awesome, you see them as you walk in to get your table. I have never sen cream puffs that big!!"}
{"text":"Had a really good meal last week and reasonably priced wished I'd had room for dessert they all looked delicious!wiil definitely be back when in town again."}
{"text":"Simon's is much larger inside than I expected, with several different seating areas.  This was my first visit, but I was told that it recently underwent a remodel.  Food and service were both good last night.  No complaints.  My salad was huge, and a great value for $8.49.  I still probably prefer the salad selections next door at the Courtyard Cafe, but I was very pleasantly surprised with all the fresh veggies on the menu.  I had been somewhat reluctant to eat here, mostly because everyone refers to it as \"Simon's Deli\" so I thought the menu would be mainly sandwiches.  They do have a decent selection of appetizers, salads, and entrees as well."}
{"text":"The service was horrific. The server never came back to check on us once throughout our meal. They seemed genuinely annoyed while we were there. I had two kids with me and had to request kid's menus. The server  acted put out by my request. My daughter's pasta wasn't cooked & my boyfriend's wrap was almost inedible. We've been here a bunch but will never come back. There are other establishments nearby that offer much more. Oh, and there were dirty tables everywhere."}
{"text":"We couldn't have had a better meal last weekend. The food was served hot, tasty, and exactly as ordered and the server was great.  I'm not sure why others have a so-so dining experience here..."}
{"text":"Nice bar...check.
Popcorn served in bar area...check.
Big menu...check
Deli style wrap served hot...meh, could have been more interesting.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"The veggie pizza tasted like dirt, and the tomatoes on it tasted like mold, one of my co workers ordered a burger once and the burger was barely cooked, wouldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Two words: Snickers Cheesecake.   This was my first visit and I was really surprised at all of the items for sale at the counter (smart of them to put those gorgeous desserts up front so you save room - or order them anyway) and the sheer size of the restaurant.  It was hoppin' for a Tuesday lunch hour, mostly with an older crowd, but that's always a good thing.  

  The menu is expansive with something for everyone.  I tried the veggie burger, which is made in-house, and was not disappointed.  I will say that it was a bit dry but was such a large patty - I think they could cut it in half and it would improve the sandwich overall.  It's not bean-based, it seems like some mixture of grains.   Plus my waitress said they sell the mix!  The steak fries were great but I'm a huge fan of them anyway.

  Then dessert.  Oh man.  I'm still trying to squeeze this cheesecake in even though I'm stuffed, it is just that good.

  Service was great, the hostess (who you have to go find past the bar) did give me a funny look when I said I was alone but overall I was comfortable dining by myself here.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Simons a number of times over the years. I am not a regular but I am familiar with them. I've also eaten their catering as well. 

They are a good deli. I've had breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My favorite of their offerings is definitely breakfast. Breakfast I've always received a good portion of food for the money. And it was good quality and tastee. Corned beef hash is great! Their omelets are good as well. 

Both lunch and dinner were just average. Not bad. Let me make that clear. Just not great. Sandwiches are kinda expensive and portion is just ok. I've had a few of the sandwiches and burgers. Deli meat was good. Portion kinda small for the price. Burger just ok. Courtyard next door makes a superior burger to them. 

I've also had their catering. Now I have to say I am actually more impressed with that than the basic lunch and dinner at the restaurant. Always good with the catering. Definitely recommend them for any event.

Also the desserts in the dessert case look incredible. However, I've never ordered one. So not sure how good they look to taste would be. 

I will go back. At some point I'll try the desserts. :)"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or breakfast.  Never been here for dinner but I am sure it's on par with the other times I have been.  Last time I even showed up a half hour before they opened and they let me in, gave me coffee and made me feel right at home.  Food is outstanding, corned beef especially.  I highly recommend this place for any meal if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Best Matzo balls and fried cauliflower ever :)"}
{"text":"Went with a group of 7 for lunch, big place so we got right in and sat down.  Experienced great service and everyone's food looked fantastic.  A lot of different daily specials to choose from too.  Topped it off with a giant cream puff for dessert, delish."}
{"text":"Over an hour for eggs and corned beef hash.  Place was barely 1/4 full (maybe 5 tables sat with 4 servers).  The waitress only came to the table when we asked her to stop.  Never once were we asked how everything was.  Probably will not return."}
{"text":"A couple of days into spring and weather is very cold in Cleveland. Why? I needed a leap to faith for lunch to shake my panic principle and thaw out. I had a good lunch. 

Restaurant is deceptively large. There is rectangle bar formation as you enter that confused me for a second. I recovered and my guest and I were presented a booth in adjunct dining area. Small criticism restaurant was cold, maybe I was sipping too many cokes, but coming from the cold I expected to warm up a bit. not bitter. Our waitress wore a velcro wrist band support. I found her very attractive for an older woman. I am against arthritis yet I could not help but imagine us in the sack together. Something similar to Bukowski novel. My gaze did not betray my intention to be a respectable patron.

Onto the meal, I had tasty kraut balls for appetizer. Tangy sauce was good complement. I had king lean corned beef. very good and I smashed the pickle. snicker cake to go. I just finished the cake, mmm that was some good fill."}
{"text":"Our last few visits have been less than impressive, both with service and food quality. But, if you want a delicious dessert, it's the place to go!"}
{"text":"Waiter greeted us with \"Friends, what would you like to drink?\" They serve Coca Cola mmmm the best tasting - the syrup to water ratio was perfect and cold mmmm. And then the king sized corned beef (salt cured brisket - large salt crystals called corns thus corned beef) was great on the rye bread with muenster cheese a sliced pickle and really excellent potato salad - we opted for the bar with high chair booth seating - don't step on the foot rest - the table will tip over.
Corn beef is a little stringy- not melt in your mouth like slymans 

When the food is good and the service is good - I was surprised it wasn't busier 

And then we went to pay at the bar - which is next to the desserts - forget lunch those desserts are magnificent 

Cream puffs as big as your head and cream filled donuts as big as your arm
I'm skipping lunch next time 

2/16/17 update-This last visit wasn't as great -  I think the microwave needs to go!! Bread rolls were microwaved rubbery 
And the potato and carrot were reheated in microwave 
I say the horseradish was very hot - watch out
There was a small plastic cup of yellow liquid (I thought it was melted butter -not)
Oil maybe melted margarine
I wasn't really happy - honesty no one can make boiled dinner like my grandmother 
But this was very disappointing"}
{"text":"Had lunch today with friends and haven't been here in years, love the remodel and had the reuben and coke slaw- Delicious.  Will be back and recommend to all my friends ! Everyone in our party loved their meals- party of 12."}
{"text":"I couldn't tell you how the food was today because no one ever waited on me. I waited at the door to order carry out while multiple people walked past me. I've always thought this place was so so overpriced bad service and today just proved my point... went to court yard instead"}
{"text":"Pathetic pathetic pathetic your pre cut pre wrapped corn beff sandwich very disappointed"}
{"text":"Love the Bronx sandwich I go back several times for it. The pasta salad is great. I also had the snickers cheese cake that us excellent too."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing and love the Matzoh ball soup!  I love all of their daily specials,  definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Ok. We went to Simon's on our way to Heiman's Grocery (which I'll review later) based on Yelp's mixed bag of reviews.  My first impression was that the lady behind the Pick-up counter, who I believe was a manager, was either hard of hearing or just rude. That was quickly overcome when we saw the Dessert counter though! Mmmmmm, it all looked good!  Then we were directed to the back dining room which was clean and nicely decorated. Our waitress, Ms. Chris, was a well trained, awesome machine! Attentive without hovering, paid attention to the details, friendly and knowledgeable. After looking over the menu, I realized that this was a cleverly disguised Lebanese restaurant posing as a deli with comfort food. We ordered the Kraut Balls, Corned Beef Reuben with a side of fried mushrooms, and the Beef Latkas with a side of tabouli, and finished by splitting a piece of raspberry cheesecake. Kraut balls with a wonderful horseradish sauce; I could eat these all day!  The Reuben was large and very good. Mushrooms; average.  I was not crazy about the Latkas (potato cakes), they just weren't seasoned well and tasted like fried mashed potatoes, but the Corned Beef was pretty darn good. The Tabouli was very fresh and tasty. As for splitting the cheesecake, that almost led to a fight (which I think our waitress found amusing), so I would suggest that you order one of your own instead.  An overall good experience and will probably go back sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best only bright side was matzoh ball soup stick with jacks or a real deli this was comparable to ny deli that shut down."}
{"text":"This is more like a 3.5 stars, on most occasions at least. Small, deli type restaurant with a bar. They have daily specials and when they're out, they're out. My family comes here all the time for the matzo ball soup, they absolutely love it! I've had the chicken noodle soup which is pretty good. 

I feel this is important to note .. Their Reuben is FANTASTIC!! It's tough for anyone to get recognition for their Reuben's or corned beef with Slyman's being \"the best corned beef in Cleveland\" so if you're a Slyman's loyal customer just give them a chance for comparison!


Adding to my previous review:

Today for the first time I didn't get my usual. I was looking for a lighter lunch so I decided against the Reuben. My mom and I split the BLT. You really can't go wrong with a BLT, so it was average. But what made me feel compelled to update my review was their French Onion Soup! Since you don't find this soup in as many places as you would chicken noodle, I always get excited when a find a place that does serve it. I get even more excited when it's delicious!! The French Onion Soup here was so good! The cheese and broth were perfect. Not overwhelmed with onions. My only complaint, though minor, is the bread. Nothing wrong with it, just wasn't fond of the taste. So, if you're a fan of this soup definitely give it a try here!"}
{"text":"If I was to choose a place and eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner there; Simon's would be the one. It has been my go to for years. Very friendly service, great food and prices. Try the matzo ball soup or the sauerkraut balls. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Not great and sure isn't Jack's or Corkys but an okay corned beef and a little over priced."}
{"text":"My family has been eating here for many years and was never disappointed. The meals are great and the corned beef Reubens and potato salad are the best i've had anywhere in this area. Great for take out and chowing down at home."}
{"text":"I had a solid lunch here the other day.  I went with a guy I was working with out here in Ohio and I can't speak for him, but I really enjoyed my meal.  The menu is deli fare: sandwiches, wraps, burgers, and the restaurant felt like it had been around for a couple decades without changing much.  I don't know if that's true, but the point is it feels comfortable and familiar.  I had the veggie wrap, which had a bunch of vegetables you don't usually see in a wrap (i.e. broccoli and cauliflower) with just the right amount of melty cheese.  The pasta salad on the side was decent.  Service was good.  I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant we have been to many times. This might be the last. Went with my husband on a Friday night for a quick bite after a long work week. The bar area is our preference but is was full so we were quickly seated in the main dining room. Waited a few minutes for our waitress. She took our order right away. I ordered the soup and sandwich. Clam chowder and a half of a Rueben. My husband ordered clam chowder and one of the specials veal schnitzel and potato pancakes. Soup came right out and was delicious. Then I waited approximately 30 minutes for a half sandwich. After 50 minutes my husband still didn't have his dinner. The waitress stopped by a few times saying she didn't know why it wasn't ready but would check again. I finished my sandwich and after being there a total of 1 hour and still no food we cancelled the rest of the order. At least 3 tables were seated, ate and left while we waited. After paying for my dinner we were walking out we stopped to speak to the manager. She apologized and offered to have the kitchen prepare his dinner to go. We waited about 10 minutes and the dinner was ready. She commented that it was a new waitress and maybe another server took our order in error but it still shouldn't have taken an hour. Food was good but not worth the wait. Not sure when  or if we'll return."}
{"text":"Simon's used to have delicious food.  But we went there last night and it was awful.  I ordered a new menu item--pecan crusted chicken over rice with sauteed fresh vegetables.   I have never tasted chicken so bland.  Basically, this appeared to be battered and deep fried chicken with no seasoning.  I saw ONE tiny pecan stuck in the batter.  In other restaurants where I have ordered pecan crusted food, the food has been rolled in finely chopped pecans.  Not so here.  The rice on which the chicken sat was just plain old white rice, not pilaf and with zero flavor, as well.  The sauteed vegetables were hideous.  There were shaved carrots that were so hard that my fork would not pick them up.  There was very soggy yellow squash and something that was unrecognizable that appeared to be a portabello mushroom, but I was afraid to eat it.  All of these veggies were overly greasy and doused with a lemon flavor.  yuck.  At the table were also pierogies that I tried.  Being Polish, I know a good pierogi.  These were not good.  The dough on the outside was not completely cooked making these pierogies soggy.  My husband had the walleye which he said was good.  We both ordered soup for starters.  My husband got the New England Clam Chowder which was served lukewarm.  I got the chicken noodle soup which was tasty, but lacking chicken.  There was one tiny piece in my large bowl.  Note that there was probably MSG in the soup broth because I got a huge migraine after eating it.  

Also, I think it's important to note that on the last two occasions we have eaten at Simon's, there has been some big drama going on with the wait staff and the discussions concerning whatever are the problems with wages, hours, who is going home when, who walked out and won't work. . . whatever it is, is discussed loudly right in front of us!  Is that really necessary?

Not sure I'd ever go back again."}
{"text":"Call ahead and get carry out!  Better than pizza!  
The food is great, but I am giving three stars because you still have to wait a long time even after your wait time is up for carry out. The food was stacked in the bag so you could not set it down in your car while you drive, my husband had to carry it on his lap while driving AND it is really cold in the restaurant.  But the food is great and the Matzo Ball soup is fabulous!  Maybe three stars is harsh, but customer service is such a big deal in my book."}
{"text":"Great food, and lots of it, I mean huge portions, great service, and very reasonable prices. What more could you ask for? 

The matza ball soup is fabulous and after eating that baseball size matza the was hardly room for my veal schnitzel and potato pancakes. Actually I ended up taking over half my meal home. If you order a corned beef sandwich watch out because there has to be a pound of corned beef on it. A very splittable Sammy. Go hungry because you won't be when you leave. Well done Simons."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed in Simons.  I ordered chicken noodle soup and a turkey sandwich.  The soup did not taste homemade.  I got a bowl full of noodles with very little broth.  I had to eat my sandwich with a knife and fork because the bread fell apart.  The restaurant was clean.  I must agree with one of the other reviewers.  It seemed a bit dark."}
{"text":"Love their wings! Good quality, homemade food"}
{"text":"The best thing about Simon's are the delicious, beautiful desserts which I understand are made off premise.  (Kudos to whoever makes them....wish I could bake that well!). Deli type food is pretty good as well.  Dinners not so much.  My hubby had the veal schnitzel with potato pancakes, both were just awful.  The potato pancakes were WAY over cooked, not fresh, and had consistency of gum.  His green beans were cold.  The clam chowder was too thick, more like paste than chowder.  I had pesto salmon which was acceptable.  The rice was so-so and my beans were old and cold.  We come here maybe once every two years and each time are reminded why we are not frequent diners....."}
{"text":"My experience with this place has been all good. Service is slow but very friendly. They will let you do just about anything in terms of special orders(i.e. Wrap instead of bread, mix & match toppings and fillers, etc.) and the food is excellent. The corned beef is to die for(I usually get it in the sundried tomato wrap) and I LOVE their horseradish! I did carry out today and it was right on time and they threw fork, knife and napkins in for me too. All in all a good place to get carry out."}
{"text":"Well, visited again and corned beef is great as always, whoever they order their pastry from does a great job, it is wonderful.  Especially the napoleon bars.  This deli is barely three stars in my humble opinion, it used to be a solid three plus to five stars, but a problem now is there is no longer a corned beef sandwich platter which I believe they used to have.  Which means if you want slaw and fries you have to order all of that \"ala-cart\" which is ok, I guess they need to make their profit, but the food was brought out on three distinct strange looking plates.  Why not on one plate with a sandwich and fries and maybe slaw on the side? Should include at least a whole or half pickle, not a quarter slice.....and biggest peeve (besides eating my early dinner off of three plates) are the teeny tiny horseradish condiment cups.  If you need portion control, simply ask your guests when they order if they would like horse radish or thousand island on the side.  Some will, some wont, but stop with the tiny plastic cups, switch back to a larger size.  It is embarrassing, when someone loves horse radish and has to ask for three or four cups, like they are a pig.  My friend had the corned beef and cabbage dinner, needs a little more spice and flavor (maybe caraway?) thicker sliced corned beef and a quarter rather than a half cabbage, with more carrot would make it better."}
{"text":"Simon's is a family restaurant.  It's delicious and consistent.  Whenever I visit I order the matzoh ball soup (delish), tuna melt and chocolate milkshake.  It is heaven at lunch.  I have had many items on their old school deli menu (liver and onions, anyone?) and would have them all again.  Everything is consistently good and service is polite and casual.  Something good for the entire family at Simon's."}
{"text":"Hey Deanna...we miss you at Simons. Sorry  but Simon's b what they b.  I think cocobella is hiring.  It b under better management."}
{"text":"We stopped here on the way to a Cincy at Cleveland Baseball game...it was vey good...my buddy had the chicken parmasian and I had the Pastrami...with a Yuengling beer..(on tap)...what a way to go."}
{"text":"I have been to Simons several times and i dont get it.  In general, the food is average.  The matzo ball soup is excellent. He deserts and deli sandwiches are good too. 

The prices are not bad, but not great either.  Just average. 

The service is slow. Very slow.  The staff is very nice and friendly, but the service is slow."}
{"text":"A must try resteraunt  homemade corn beef is to die for and Rubin sandwich is huge with no need for fries  to fill you up. Really nice desert menue  with large portions. Very reasonable priced lunch specials. I try to stop whenever I am in the area"}
{"text":"We chose Simon's as our first local restaurant while vacationing in the area. The reviews seemed to be positive. I cannot speak for other dishes but the items that my family chose left much to be desired. 

I ordered the corned beef and cabbage dinner for $14. The cabbage, boiled potato, and carrot had zero seasoning to enhance the flavor. They served it with a 2 ounce cup of melted butter to help choke down this bland food. The corned beef tasted good but was sparse and incapable of saving this equally overpriced ($14) and underwhelming dish. I should have ordered the corned beef sandwich for nearly half the price and over twice the meat. 

My wife ordered the new French onion au gratin soup and the deli burger. The soup tasted like hot soy sauce and the onions were just blackened mush. The deli burger was a dry sandwich and does not come with any sauce by design. 

The kiddos both ordered the cheese pizza from the children's menu. My wife said the sauce tasted like plain tomato paste. She makes her own pizza sauce at home and understands the ingredients in a good sauce better than I do. But the kids ate it with smiles like most little ones probably would. 

The pink lemonade tasted off in a bitter/watered down way. Probably just a fountain issue unless they make it in-house. I asked my server to switch my drink to Coke and she brought me Diet Coke. 

Maybe the desserts are incredible but we were way too far in financially to just keep throwing the ol' blue-collar greenbacks in the fire."}
{"text":"The food was very good!!! Sautéed walleye with mushrooms! Rice tasty flavor and love those crunchy green beans!! Pierogies delish and clam chowder was flavorful and verycreamy. Will dine here again !!!"}
{"text":"Great local place.  Reubens and Matzo Ball soup!  Nice bar area.  Extensive menu with something for everyone.  Kids menu.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"Simon's doesn't pretend to be a destination restaurant. It is an expanded deli with good sandwiches, cheap beer and a dinner menu for seniors. Still, there are some surprises on the menu that are worth more than they cost.

The deli sandwiches are usually very good. The Philadelphian is my favorite but the Rueben or a good old Pastrami sandwich will do the job as well. Their fries are those old-fashioned steak fries which are good enough to make you think twice about getting the potato salad. The Veggie burger is the best around which is surprising considering how infrequently it must be ordered. Blintzes and sauerkraut balls work as appetizers.

Breakfast is okay but not great. If you're like me you'll get lured into an omelet which isn't worth the extra bucks. Their orange juice is served in a bottle (huh?) and the coffee is what you'd get anywhere.

I might not be cool enough to know what 'good matzo ball soup' tastes like (see other review) but the stuff they sell at Simon's does the job on a snowy day and it tastes good to my unsophisticated palate. Now that I know it's not 'good' I'll be sure to order something a tad more -shall we say- toothsome. Indeed.

Simon's is a good deli with good sandwiches."}
{"text":"Service was fair. My beat salad had three Beets in it and it lacked Luster. lousy dressing.The fisherman's platter was a joke, the breaded clams were stringy and dry.The rice was cold and old and so were the green beans. The crab cake was un-eatable. My husbands food was awful potato pancakes were gummy an uncooked The veal schnitzel came apart from its breading and was undesirable. Won't be back...and the place had flys flying around and landing on my food.... yuck we both had sick stomachs after eating there. bad food."}
{"text":"Simon's Catering is now serving lunch at my place of business!  Our call center was ecstatic when we heard Simon's was going to set up a 'cafeteria' at our building.  They bring in a few hot entrees, a few sandwiches, salad, soup and desserts every day.  The quality of the food and size of portion has not suffered at all, eventhough they're out of their element.  The food is always amazing and the staff is more than friendly and accommodating.  We use them for all of our catering needs and recommend them HIGHLY!"}
{"text":"Waitress and service was very good! Food was overpriced for what you get. There are far better deli's in the Greater Cleveland/Cleveland area. It would do in a pinch, but it's really more of a bar with marginal deli food. We didn't try any of the desserts, but they looked amazing."}
{"text":"The staff is fantastic and very helpful when you are trying to figure things out.  The food is great and the desserts are worth the calorie splurge every time.  The food is fresh and brought out hot. 

They were very welcoming of a large group that was unsure of how many exactly at the beginning but turned into 8 people with separate checks.  They were friendly and didn't make us feel like we were bothering them with an inconvenience.  I would recommend them any time."}
{"text":"Simon's either needs to update their online menu descriptions or make items as described.  I ordered takeout--a Cobb salad which was supposed to have: Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, broccoli, cauliflower, red cabbage, carrots, hard-boiled egg shredded cheese and bacon in a tortilla shell.  I asked for no cucumber or bacon.   My salad came with exactly one piece of broccoli, no cauliflower, a few shreds of cabbage and carrots and about 1 TB of cheese, exactly 1/2 of a hard-boiled egg.  And one full section of the compartmentalized salad container was filled with pasta salad.  I didn't order pasta salad.  Pasta salad is not in the description.  When I opened my salad I wondered if it was the correct one.  Very disappointed and can't say I will be ordering or visiting again anytime soon.  If you want a salad you should go down in the same plaza a few more stores to Courtyard.  Their salads are phenomenal."}
