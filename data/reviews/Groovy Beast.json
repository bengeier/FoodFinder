{"text":"Great food (I've been here once before), but poor customer service!  I arrived at 7:46 on Monday evening, lights were on, door was unlocked, sign indicated they close at 8:00pm.  Little gal said \"sorry we're closed\", I said \"the door indicates 8:00 pm today\"! She says \"well, we stop serving at 7:45\" ..... go figure!  Then lock the damn door and change your posted hours to reflect your business hours!  I just wanted to pick up a hamburger to go (they are actually very good!) No adult management in sight, probably the little snowflakes wanted to go home and play tweetie-tweetie on their iPhone...."}
{"text":"I have nicknamed this place the \"greasy beast\" because everything swims in oil.

We first went for breakfast and were told they had cream cheese and bagels separately, but not allowed to sell a bagel and cream cheese.  French toast was yummy and the omelette was good, eggs cooked well but the hash browns were sitting in at least three tablespoons of oil.

For a second go, we tried lunch.  Added the onion petals to our meal and they too sat in tablespoons of oil.  

Service is lackluster, as is environment (it's attached to a gas station, uses all disposable everything) and the oil has just done me in.

I'm Not sure that I'll return."}
{"text":"Don't let the gas station neighbor fool you.  Groovy Beast is a cute, very clean, restaurant that offers a good breakfast in a quick and casual manner. You'll never want to find a greasy Waffle House again.  Taking my mom out of her comfort zone we found this gem on YELP.  I had an egg Sammie made exactly how I chose.  A basic breakfast for my mom, she loved the hash-browns.  While we didn't have the French toast it looked delicious, and the regular customer behind us said they were great.  

I'll be back on my next visit."}
{"text":"I went here for the second time yesterday after hiking at Crowder's Mountain, and it was GREAT again!  I'm a fry snob and usually leave behind the dry or overcooked ones, but these are the best fries I've had and ate every one!  Gina and the rest of the crew are great!
[I inadvertently forgot to leave a tip at the table yesterday, unless there was a jar at the counter...if so, I did...if not, sorry...I'll double it the next time I'm in.  #FightFor15]"}
{"text":"Amazing, high quality food and wonderful service!  Love this place!  Lots of great lunch specials, house made burgers, and the best French fries in Gastonia hands down."}
{"text":"I had seen a lot of exceedingly positive reviews of Groovy Beast and decided to see what all of the fuss was about today.

First off, being attached to a gas station, there's certainly a natural skepticism to Groovy Beast. But, as they say, sometimes the most surprising packages hold the best things! Once inside of the restaurant, it's very easy to forget that gas pumps and a car wash are right outside! The inside is clean, cute, and comfortable. 

I had the daily special which, for Friday, was a flounder sandwich with handcut fries. The fries were very good and the flounder sandwich was good. It was served on white bread, which was definitely unusual. But, good. Next time, I'd definitely ask to substitute a brioche bun though! My friend ordered the GB burger & a side salad. We were both pleased with our food and the affordable prices, too. Daily specials are only $7.04 which is both delightfully affordable and a fun hometown shout-out. (Area code=704 for any unfamiliar with the area!) We were both already checking out the other menu options and specials that we might want to try in the future! I'm definitely glad that I gave it a go and will certainly be back! I have a new go-to when I'm on that side of town, for sure!"}
{"text":"Best food in town hands down. Burgers are ground daily, one of the best phillys in town, made from scratch gravy, hand cut french fries. Soups are made in house and never dissapoint. 

Hidden gem for sure."}
{"text":"In a gas station plaza .... Great food and atmosphere. Great staff and was attentive to my family. A must try for anyone in the area"}
{"text":"Great food, nicely nestled in South Gastonia. Good food is fairly easy to find in the city, until you get into this area and we really have very few choices. 
This is a breath of fresh air. Fresh everything) quality ingredients well prepared always equals good food. You would do yourself a favor to try it.
Breakfast I would recommend the \"ernie\", Order a chicken tender breakfast bowl and swap the tenders for their fresh ground sausage. The bottom of this bowl is home fries, topped with \"cooked your way\" eggs, fresh sausage ground that day and some kick butt gravy made in house.
Lunch, I recommend the Bacon Burger, Mustard Chili Onions with home fries, Their fried are PERFECTION, or Onion petals. 
Recently found out about Fried Mac & Cheese Egg rolls and I'm already shopping for bigger pants. TRUST ME, Bacon and a light mix of jolapeno's come together with some killer Mac & Cheese cooked perfectly in an egg-roll. How can that NOT be good?
Update
I just wanted to add that they have added jalapeno poppers, so I added photos of that. And my new favorite burger is the cheesy bacon stack. You can have onion petals now in lieu of onion rings. This food just keeps getting better and I couldn't say enough positive about the owners. The only thing stopping me from giving this a five-star is little nitpicky items. Stuff like wishing there were 4 poppers in the order of appetizers so that I don't have to fight my friends for that third one LOL"}
{"text":"(4/6/18) So I was on my way to a client's house when a personal emergency cropped up for her. Now I had 1.5 hours to kill rather than half an hour. So I asked Yelp what was out this way and the beast caught my eye. I missed the turn but found it on the second go. Like folks have remarked its pretty well hidden. Inside though its a nice little restaurant. Everyrhing is $7.04, with the exception of the kids menu. The food is simple but packed with flavor and it comes out of the kitchen hot, definitely a plus in my book."}
{"text":"This is THE best burger in Gastonia, and YES, I am the authority on the issue.  If you disagree, you're wrong.  Good quality meat, ground in house, chilli, slaw, mustard, onion, YES!!  Hotdogs, fries, fried mushrooms also awesome.  They make their own dressings, cut their own fries, etc, etc.  it's nice to see a place in Gastonia that cares about serving good quality food!  This place is a gem that should be supported!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Found it while in Gastonia doing some surprise preparation for our newly adopted grandson! It was clean and had great service. As others have said, don't let the fact that it's attached to a gas station scare you! A must try!!"}
{"text":"We can't say enough about this place!  From the moment you walk in the door, greeted by two very friendly and helpful young ladies to the wonderful food. The fried tenderloin sandwich was awesome. Reminded me of my Indiana State Fair days!  And hand cut fries. All fresh!  Nothing frozen that we had!  Very clean restaurant!  Support this local gem!"}
{"text":"Third time here and I've  yet to have a bad meal. Everything is fresh! Service is swift. Great local option!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and GREAT OWNERS.  We have ate lunch here several times and it was great. Hand cut fries and hand pattied burgers. You don't find that anymore. Thanks for the great service and food."}
{"text":"This is becoming our favorite place to eat!!  Everything on the menu is amazing!  You can really tell they take pride in everything they create!!!"}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere. Friendly staff. Food quality does not match the price. One of the nastiest hamburgers I've ever eaten. Home cut fries were plentiful and quite tasty, though. This was my second visit. The first time, I ordered breakfast and it was so bad that I hesitated to return. A lot of people love this place, but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Love breakfast here! Always huge portions and cooked just right. The chocolate chip cookies are amazing and gigantic. They will even warm it up for you."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Gastonia. But they don't stop there. The burgers are to die for! And they now stay open for dinner too. I must recommend the fried chicken dinner with collards and mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast and was satisfied. French toast with fruit and home fries. The price was just right and the food was good. First impression when pulling up was not the best because it is connected to a gas station. Overall was good."}
{"text":"I have eaten lunch here many times, and have always had great food. This morning I took my wife to breakfast here for the first time and was not disappointed. The bowl and omelet were excellent."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. We really enjoyed everything we ordered - including the chicken sandwich (huge piece of chicken hand fried), sirloin steak (smothered in peppers and onions), and bacon stack burger (brown sugar bacon was delicious!). My son also got the french onion soup, and it was really good too. The fried mushrooms and pickles were melt in your mouth good. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Had the soup of the day. It was great!!! Pimento grilled cheese sandwich to die for. Bread puddling yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Comfort food with a unique flair. Always a great experience -- don't let the setting sway you. Clean, flavorful, fresh. I'd be here all time if i lived closer"}
{"text":"Got the chicken strips, fries, and mushrooms it was delicious! Also got banana pudding and loved it all!"}
{"text":"I was kind of skeptical about this place when they opened up. Before they opened, There was another restaurant there call Trackside Grill. I loved eating at Trackside. I was was sad when they trackside closed. When Groovy Beast came along, I had my doubts. Boy was I wrong. This restaurant has the best food, especially the meatloaf. Never had a bad meal at Groovy Beast. Sad to Trackside close down, but so glad Groovy Beast took over!!!!"}
{"text":"I visit this establishment for both breakfast and lunch several times per week.  The food is great, with some of the specials having a unique twist on standard fare.  The service is fantastic!  It is so nice to be called by your name when you arrive, and when you leave.  The prices are fair for the portions you get.  I highly recommend the entire menu!"}
