{"text":"Reasonably priced, fresh ingredients, lots of choices for a tiny kiosk with a \"mom & pop\" feel. I particularly liked the mushroom rolls with the sweet brown rice option."}
{"text":"I see this place all the time, out of the corner of my eye as I am making my usual beeline for Choklat. As something unexpected came around, I finally decided to try out Kin Sushi.

From the looks of it, nothing is made to order. All the dishes are premade and packaged in to containers akin to the ones you find for premade sushi in Safeway, or Sobeys. 

As such, the sushi all tastes like Safeway sushi, and for that, I was slightly disappointed. I guess, your expectations are a little higher when you see a place surrounded by all the fresh produce available from the Farmers Market. It wasn't bad, it was just glaringly ordinary. 

And with the prices being on par, or higher than those of other Japanese places in town that actually make the sushi to order; it's made me far less inclined to visit them in the future. I'd almost rather get Safeway sushi, because it tastes the same and it's $2 cheaper. Hey, sometimes you get a craving for sushi and don't have time to sit down in Kinjo.

But in those instances, I think I'll be heading to Kingsland and their Big Catch."}
{"text":"Ready made sushi that isn't too bad, but is a little pricey for what it is. 

My fiance ordered California rolls and it wasn't too bad, but again we weren't expecting anything amazing. We ordered from multiple stalls in the Farmer's Market to try different things that day for their Valentine's event. We definitely thought that Kin sushi's sushi was good for ready made sushi, but compared to all the other food we ordered, it seemed way pricier and didn't really offer as much in quality or taste.

Their service was okay as well, nothing too memorable. They didn't have any customers lining up to order that day we visited, and the whole Market was extremely busy. 

Would probably order from there again if we were in the Farmer's Market and had a craving for sushi, but would not come visit their stall just for their sushi."}
