{"text":"This hidden new treasure is all the way in Bradford. I went in and had a great experience. 

The place is clean and classy. 
Servers: friendly and sweet. 
Food:   Falafels were nothing like I'v ever had before. Served over hummus and some side fresh pita.  Chicken skewers were juicy and delicious. You get a pickled cabbage and sauces to go with everything !!! 

They cater as well !!!"}
{"text":"Food is a 4-5 star, staff is a 1 star.....Perhaps a little over priced but the Turkey Shawarma is excellent so I'm ok with it. Been here 3 times and the staff just seem miserable. No smiles anywhere. I would consider going more often and trying more of the menu but I feel uncomfortable going in there. It's like going home into your house knowing your spouse is mad at you! Lol, only way I can describe it. It's too bad..... cause the food I've sampled from there is pretty good."}
{"text":"So happy to have found this restaurant, definitely one of the best middle eastern restaurants I've been to. Great service and staff. First time I showed up here, it was about 30-45 minutes before closing, and they still made sure we were seated and enjoyed our meal (instead of originally doing take out since we noticed they were about to close). Very large portions, and beautiful presentation of all dishes. Their house salad is lovely, the dressing and the little bits of barley inside, are a really nice touch. I've also had their chicken breast skewers as well as their shawarma, which is amazing! Definitely becoming one of my go to places."}
{"text":"1st time here and the food was amazing.  Turkey  schwarma and dark chicken skewer and mushroom hummus was great.  Price was excellent as well.  We will be back."}
{"text":"What a great place.  They just opened up but theses guys have it all ironed out and ready to serve you.  The shawarma and shish Kebob are delicious. The service is amazing. The restaurant is very clean and bright.  Definitely a must visit.  Great addition to Bradford."}
{"text":"Great food ... actually, make that a LOT of great food! Fresh and tasty. Will definitely recommend to friends who live around the area and this will always be an option for us when we are nearby."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. To be honest I was going to go to Crabby Joes but saw this place and I'm glad we went in. Everything was delicious, freshly cooked, good quality and did I say friggin DELICIOUS!?!!!!! Great ambiance - industrial looking but lovely! Will definitely go back. If you LOVE Mediterranean, ''tis is your place."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with husband yesterday.  From the exterior I wasn't feeling overly optimistic even though there have been many great reviews.  The food was great.  My husband had a burger with salad, and their house potato salad.  The burger was huge and very juicy.  Their salad was delicious that they had the dressing was savoury and sweet.  I had a falafel sandwich which I ended up taking home with me because the portions were very large.

The home made mini loaf was delicious. I would recommend coming here."}
