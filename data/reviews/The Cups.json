{"text":"Ordered the Mango Shaved Ice. Even though it was winter and freezing cold outside it still left a warm spot in my heart. They have mastered the ice consistency to the point where you do not have to chew at all and the ice just melts away. 

I highly recommend this place. The only downfall is the space itself. It is very small with limited sitting. Very tight if you are a family looking to have a nice treat after a meal, especially if you bring a stroller."}
{"text":"Small spot that has good bingsu, had the large black sesame. Dessert was of good quality. Only negatives was the use of Styrofoam for cups and the place was cold due to the door being so close to all the seats."}
{"text":"First time trying Korean shaved ice as an afternoon snack and it was a pretty pleasant experience.

The staff are very friendly and helpful. Ordered a cup of black sesame shaved ice ($7.50+tax) and it took around 15 mins to make it as there were some orders before mine. They only take debit or cash.

The black sesame toppings consist of black sesame powder, black sesame ice cream, almonds, red beans, and mochi. The black sesame powder is very strong and not too sweet. Unlike black sesame soft serve, you can actually smell the black sesame!! The black sesame ice cream is just average, much like the ice cream in the supermarket. The red beans on the top are unsweetened, personally, I would prefer it to be a little sweeter. Also 6 pieces of korean mochi on the top, unsweetened as well. There's also some more black sesame powder in the center of the cup so that the shaved ice on the bottom has flavour.

As for the shaved ice itself, it says it is milk-flavoured, but I can't really taste anything. I would prefer the Taiwanese-style where the flavours are blended into the ice itself. Also, it's not like Taiwanese shaved ice where it's layers of ice, it's more like snow. 

Overall, I would give 4/5 stars. I would say it's a little too pricey for a cup of dessert, but I wouldn't mind every once in a while. Also, I think the service should be a little faster. There were 3 employees working to make the orders (3 in front of me before I entered), and it still takes 15 mins for a small cup."}
{"text":"Prices are comparable to other places that serve bingsu; however, on a plus side I feel like the toppings and sauce was generously added compared to other places.

I ordered a green tea bingsu in a cup and really enjoyed it. Would definitely come back to try other items on their menu. They have free parking at the back, but there is a 1 hour seating limit as the place is relatively small."}
{"text":"I saw pictures of The Cups going around on social media before, so it's been a place that I've been wanting to check out for sometime. And so a friend and I decided to go and get their bingsoo (shaved ice) on an extremely cold day, makes sense right?

This place is pretty small. There's about like 4 tables. Because it was cold that day, there was only 2 other customers when we got there. I ordered the cup sized Tiramisu Shaved Ice ($7.99) and my friend got the Mango Shaved Ice ($6.99). We waited about 10 minutes or so, until they called us up to get our order. 

The Tiramisu Shaved Ice comes with a piece of Tiramisu cake placed on the top of the cup as well as a heart-shaped cookie and whipped cream. It looked really good. It also comes with a shot of espresso, which I was told was to go with the cake. I personally don't like coffee in general, so after taking a sip I didn't drink anymore of it (it was so bitter ._.) 

I really enjoyed the tiramisu cake. It was rich, very light and creamy. As for the shaved ice, it was flavourful and since they layer the ingredients, every bite was good. I didn't try my friend's mango shaved ice, so I can't comment much on that but what I can say is that it looked really good!

TL;DR this place has some great bingsoo. Probably the best bingsoo in the area. Get bingsoo."}
{"text":"Fantastic, cute and small cafe.

Who's never not in a mood for some patbingsu (shaved ice). The intrigue with The Cups is that they serve shaved ice to go in a cup if you prefer. They also have hot lattes (black sesame, taro and sweet potato to name a few), homemade desserts and toast. 

I had the tiramisu as well as the coffee flavour and both were delicious. Since it was layered in the cup, there wasn't a moment where it wasn't flavourful or lacking any sweetness. 

I believe the cafe is owned by a lovely older Korean couple and they were very friendly. Since it's just the two of them, the patbingsu takes longer to make, but it may have just been a rush period for them (it was packed at first, but died out around 9pm on a Monday when we went). 

The Christmas decor is lovely in there especially with the light pots hanging from the ceiling. I regret not taking that picture against the antique clock (also Christmas decorated) they have. I'll be back just for that haha. 

The Cups has my stamp of approval, for whatever it's worth."}
{"text":"The restaurant is VERY small! My friends and I had to sit by the washroom - basically blocking the aisle. We had to get up every time another customer needed to use the washroom. 
We ordered the mango bowl and it was very good!
The presentation was great! Who doesn't like condensed milk with fresh fruit and shaved ice!! I'd definitely come back but not with a big group."}
{"text":"Small place with 1hr seating limit. Free parking at the back which they share with the residents at the building. However, there isn't any signs indicating visitor parking there. Paid parking is beside as well. Had their Taro Frappe with no whip cream and it tastes pretty good. Also tried the Real Fruit Blueberry Yakult Slush and it's also very refreshing. Price is reasonable. Will consider coming back again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I did it! I finally went for Bingsu (Shaved Ice)... when it was -2C outside (smh). Leave it to me to wait to have one of the GTAs most famous frozen treats when it's freezing cold outside - jeez.

Cold weather aside, I was super excited to try it out and cutting right to the chase, it was totally worth the wait and lived up to the hype. A small shop with limited seating but literally tons of amazing flavours from ones that might be a bit more traditional to other that might appease the more western/caucasian palette.

You can get any flavour in a cup size (similar to a McDonalds Large pop) or as a large, which is basically a shareable bowl of amazingness. 

For my first taste, I went with a Cup sized strawberry which was layers of a strawberry sundae style fruit filling placed in between layers of shaved ice, topped with tons of strawberries, cheesecake bites and actual strawberry ice cream.

As far as desserts go this one delivers, and best of all because it was shaved ice and not all ice cream, I didn't feel like crap afterwards from the excessive amount of dairy consumption.

Minus points for how long it takes to produce the product, they're set up like fast casual but I can only imagine how long this would take if there was a lineup in the summer, yikes.

Overall, good times, I'll come back again!

PS - One other note, earlier in 2017 they won a friendly little contest that Yelp GTA hosted on Instagram called Munch Madness which was essentially a foodie bracket where people voted on their favourite foods in head to head battles. They must have been super proud of this win because they manufactured their own, unofficial plaque/award with a backwards Yelp logo. Kinda cute but also kinda weird/sketchy...."}
{"text":"This place was very good, its small but the owner was lovely and friendly. Me and my friend came by wanting to try the famous Korean Bingsoo, and it was not disappointing. I would have given this place a 5/5 but the issue was the fruit, it was too sour and they used frozen fruits. I'm not sure if that is what regular bingsoo is suppose to use as it was my first time trying bingsoo. However, overall it was delicious and it is a place that I would definitely recommend and come again. The owner was so sweet and gave us recommendation for the next time we come. So this place definitely deserves a thumbs up! :D"}
{"text":"Cute. Ordered the medium sized tiramisu and black sesame shaved ice. I personally prefer the black sesame because the toppings that they put in there were great. Mochi, black sesame ice cream, sesame seeds, yum! The tiramisu came with a block of tiramisu. Both were very milky.

Imo the medium size is enough even for two people. It was also affordable. Cashier person was friendly! Tiny tiny place tho so good luck if you wanna sit down somewhere.

A coworker said men don't go here, but I went anyways."}
{"text":"Pretty tiny place on Yonge steet serving all type of shaved ice desserts.  Seating here is very limited like 4 tables max.  Might be better off going to the bigger location a bit North if you have a large party.  Got the matcha read bean large size in a bowl.  I noticed the large ones are not layered like the small size int he cup which wasn't as good.  I had to ask for more condensed milk as the middle wasn't filled with topping.  Overall pretty good but the wait is long I was expecting something like the Hawaii shaved ice where it was ready in 1-2 mins.  ahd to wait over 15-20 mins and it wasn't even that busy."}
{"text":"**TIP** you could always park in the Visitor Parking available for that building. Learned that the hard way by getting a $30 ticket LOOL

Anyways. My girlfriend and I have been wanting to go here for quite some time and try their bingsu! They've always looked so Instagram worthy but came to find out about the taste.

The Cups is a small cafe with small tables and food variety encompassing desserts and snacks such as dumplings, bagels, breads and so on. However we came here for the Bingsu

Honestly I can say the bingsu was pretty good! What we got were the Black Sesame  Bingsu and Strawberry Bindsu Cups for 7.99. 

I absolutely loved the taste of the Strawberry Bingsu because of the freshly sliced strawberries and the little cheesecake cubes. It was a tad bit sweet with the Strawberry jam but it tasted pretty good.

The Black Sesame was alright, but then again I'm not a huge fan of black sesame. My favourite part of that Bingsu was the chewy mochi 

All in all I really liked the Bingsus but we didn't finish all of it. The \"cup\" size was pretty big and all you need tbh. There is a larger size for 10.99-11.99 but I think the Cups size is good enough"}
{"text":"One of the best bingsu I've had. I tried the mango bingsu in a bowl and it was a good amount to share between two people. Lots of mango chunks, chopped almonds and cheesecakes with fine powdery like shaved ice. When I mixed the bingsu with the condensed milk, it became almost like melted ice cream. Some shaved ice from other places don't come with enough toppings so it can be difficult to finish once you get to the bottom where you're just left with ice. However it's not the same case here at The Cups. They give generous amount of toppings and layered in a very appetizing manner. I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"Cute place to get shaved ice. The sizes were kinda smaller than I thought they would be but was very good. The lady working there was very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"We came here on Good Friday. The store is small with only one staff working from what I could see. It is a self serve takeout restaurant which you will get yourself seated and get your own water at the counter. The storekeeper greeted us with a big smile and still direct us where to sit and went back to prepare the food for other customers. 

We ordered mango bingsoo (Korean shaved ice) and sesame bingsoo. Texture of the ice is fluffy with milk flavour. While I do like the sesame bingsoo which has generous amount of chewy Mochi and really flavourful and aromatic sesame powder, the mango bingsoo is made of mango that are mushy and sour. I know it's sometimes inevitable to use frozen fruits but it is worse than the frozen mango I got from average grocery stores. I would give 4 stars for my bingso and 2 start for the mango. They do have lots of other interesting items on the menu such as spam sushi and Asian inspired latte (taro, green tea, black sesame etc) 

I will still come back and give it another try."}
{"text":"This place was quite disappointing I have to say. Came in for lunch because I saw the bulgogi sandwich on their menu, but I guess I should have read all the reviews since I found out they stopped serving these a few weeks ago. This is not a brunch, breakfast or lunch place. It's known for their shaved ice dessert so don't come here looking to  fill up on lunch. Anyways, I made that grave mistake but ordered a coconut latte and king dumping anyways. They have interesting latte choices (which btw do not have caffeine in them)...there was sweet potato, red bean, taro and chai latte. The king dumpling was not a dumpling! It was just a single veggie bun which cost $2.50 so don't order it. I may come back here to try the shaved ice but nothing else. So sad."}
{"text":"Good shaved ice, it's light, fluffy and milky tasting! Tried the matcha and tiramisu, really enjoyed it. Even in -10 degrees weather hah."}
{"text":"Ordered the Black Sesame Shaved Ice.  It was as good a shaved ice dessert as I've ever had.  Black bean ice cream, ground black sesame, red bean,  mochi bits, almonds, condensed milk-i think.   Huge 10.99.  Meant for sharing.  
Place is tiny... 3 or 4 tables.   My only complaint is that none of their offerings combine red bean and fruit.
Will return."}
{"text":"Rating for the shaved ice: 5 stars, super yummy and a regular size is actually PLENTY for two to share. Portions are great for the price.

Rating for the atmosphere: 3 stars. I guess it being on Yonge Street means real estate is expensive but this place is pretty small and cramped. It's not the most comfortable space and definitely not good for larger groups of people which is a bummer because desserts is something that my friends and I like to do. It could be decent for a date as the tables are fine for one or two people but still, the atmosphere is sorta dark and dingy, not really romantic or cozy.

If they can work on their interior or expand the space for more seating, it may could be a lot better :)"}
{"text":"I would give this 3.5, but Yelp only accepts whole numbers.

After Snow Time, my favourite bingsu vendor, popped up in my neighbourhood, I developed a penchant for the Korean shaved ice dessert. The Cups was on my bucket list, and I tried it out with some of my buddies during a Wednesday evening after a dinner at Yupdukk.  It takes about a 7 minute walk from Finch Station to get to The Cups.  Therefore, it's in close proximity to many dinner options, making it a prime choice for dessert after dinner.

What distinguishes The Cups from many other bingsu competitors is the fact that their bingsu dishes can be done up in a grab and go style.  By this, I mean you have the option of having your bingsu prepared in a large sized disposal cup.  The disposal cup doesn't take away from its presentation value and actually gives it some extra character because you can enjoy the layering, which is often hidden when you eat from the regular bowl.  Plus, the ''cup-style'' makes the bingsu highly portable, which gives it these advantages:

- you can grab it to go for a drive or commute

- you can go to your next destination with this in hand

- you can enjoy this outside when there's no more seating

The only downside is that because of the narrower space of the cup, mixing the layers does take some work. You won't be able to do it immediately either because the toppings may fall off with too much motion.  Due to this, I found that there was a lack of condensed milk flavour until I was able to stir the layers together after eating a third of the cup's content.  My black sesame bingsu still tasted decent of course, but the shaved ice was very powdery and was in definite need of more condensed milk at the beginning. It would also up the ante if they served condensed milk on the side like some bingsu places. 

The Cups won't top Snow Time in my books, but I'll definitely be coming back.  What draws me back is that The Cups has many unique flavours that I rarely see elsewhere, such as their Green Grape Bingsu and their Tiramisu Bingsu. If I get the large size in a bowl, perhaps my issue with the lack of condensed milk flavour will be non-existent as well."}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with friends. Their snowflake shaved ice is amazing and they have a good selection of flavours. Lattes are all good too. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I was strolling along Yonge St. and I've always wanted to check out this cafe as I saw pretty high reviews on Yelp. 

The special toast caught my attention with the egg, cheddar cheese, cabbage, pork ham, and real kiwi sauce. To be honest, the real kiwi sauce caught my attention. The sandwich was made as you place the order. The real kiwi sauce is unique and tasted very refreshing! I don't like ham, so I asked them not to put the ham inside. The only thing that this sandwich can improve is to reduce the amount of cabbage. Way too much cabbage in this sandwich.

For the drinks, I've ordered the tiramisu latte. I am not a coffee drinker at all, but this one tasted pretty good. There is a good selection of latte. 

Note: There is a sign that indicates a 1 hour seating limit time due to limited seatings. I will definitely come back to try the king-dumpling."}
{"text":"Cups is located at Yonge/Horsham Ave. with several other small shops beside it. It's about a 7 minute walk from Yonge/Finch. While they sell some sandwiches, cakes, and other miscellaneous stuff, their bingsu/shaved ice is the first thing you should get! 

Food *****
Probably the best bingsu/shaved ice in Toronto. Bingsu is a popular Korean shaved ice dessert with sweet toppings like strawberries, mango, or even tiramisu. Each one is prepared fresh and is reasonably price for the portion and taste you get. I always get the tiramisu flavour but their other flavours like mango, green tea, or black sesame are also delicious.

Service *****
Service was top notch at Cups. All staff were super friendly and happy to answer questions or when they are serving you. 

Ambiance ****
Cups has a cute, homey decor although its small space might make it difficult for large groups to eat together. 

Tips/Closing comments
- Small size if you're eating alone, get the large if you're sharing with 1 or 2 other people 
- Tiramisu is great for chocolate lovers, they even put a real cake on it
- Eat it as fast as possible, the ice will melt pretty quickly.
- Either eat at the place or if you want to eat outside, if you go north a bit, there are some benches which are nice to eat at"}
{"text":"A small and lovely coffee place. There snowflake or binsu is delicious, especially the matcha one. The drink smells nice but the taste is just okay. The food is not very good for the price. This place only take cash and debit card."}
{"text":"Ordered a matcha and tiramisu shaved ice. Both were really good! Tiramisu had a lot of cacao powder for my liking but still pretty good overall. The shaved ice is pretty fine too. 

Also ordered the sweet potato latte which wasn't the best! Super sweet and was unable to finish it 

This place is pretty small and they said there is a one hour limit to customers."}
{"text":"I've only had the tiramisu shaved ice. So good! A small shop with one or two employees so there's usually a wait for the food. The quantity is never consistent though. The tiramisu cake portion gets smaller every time but I still keep coming back because it's so delicious!"}
{"text":"Friends of mine were craving bingsu for a few weeks since trying out the Cups location in Markham, so we made a trip to this North York location. Unlike the Markham location, seating is extremely limited. There is room for about 10 people in the front section of the cafe, and seating for about 6 more towards the back of the restaurant. 

I like that this location serves some savoury food options, such as sandwiches and dumplings. I was looking forward to seeing bibimbap on the menu as I had noticed another Yelper had posted a picture of this. Alas, bibimbap is not a regular menu offering. There is a very extensive list of bingsu flavour options, including tiramisu, blueberry cheesecake, cheese, mango, grape, green tea, and injeolmi among others. They even have a dessert dumpling on offering but I was really there for the bingsu.

Our group got several flavours including cheese, blueberry, injeolmi, and black sesame. Like other locations, there are options for portion size, including cup (good for 1-2 people), and bowls (good for sharing with 2 or more people). Like the other Cups location, the quality of the bingsu is consistent in terms of the finer ice shavings and overall creamy mouthfeel of the bingsu. I always appreciate the layering of ingredients so that you get consistency in flavours even towards the bottom of your cup or bowl.

My biggest disappointment with this visit/location was that they only had one person working on a Saturday afternoon. This poor individual had to take orders from at least 14 people while we were there and prepare all of the orders herself. As a result we were there well over an hour from time of arrival and ordering to time of consumption. The person working there did the best she could but had other patrons been in more of a rush, I can imagine their patience would have worn thin. Based on this experience, if given a choice, I would prefer to visit the Markham location for the bigger venue, greater staffing, faster service, and more ample seating."}
{"text":"Delicious and different from the Hawaiian Shave Ice.  This is Shave Milk.  Creamier and lighter. 
 Had the Mango Shave Ice and Injeolmi Shave Ice.  Reasonably priced compared to other establishments that serve Shave Ice.  A large could feed 2 people.  I look forward to trying all the other flavours.

This location is very small.  Seating for about 10 people max."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim and wasn't disappointed. They have various shaved ice desserts all very delicious. Since they are on they expensive side, I recommend getting a big version and ask for cups so you can split it with friends. The area has free parking but seating is limited."}
{"text":"I am so looking forward to coming back! I had the \"small\" black sesame shaved ice and it was perfection! The prices are not too bad considering the large portions. The cafe is tiny but is perfect for mini dates and smaller hangouts. Really wanna try the matcha and tiramisu next time."}
{"text":"If only based on food quality it would be a 5.  Drove quality  distance to this location and after we ordered, one of the employees spilled ice on the floor and they said they were all out of the Hingis. My friend and I were very disappointed. We sat their thinking where we should go next and in disappointment. My friend saw them making bingsu still. Begged them to make one for us cause we came from a distance. Then we got our order. 


Seating is not the best. Go for the food, not the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Went here with my family and friends to try out something new in the area, as they were visiting from the States and out of province, they loved the desserts here and the people who served us were very kind. We went again the next evening, because we wanted to try more. Highly recommended for people who have recently moved into the area and for those visiting beyond just downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"As good as others said it was. However, the place has a 1-hr stay limit for their tables. Please understand that it is a very small place. We were there for way over 1hr when it wasn't busy, and the owner didn't bother us at all. Please give your table to others when people start to pour in."}
{"text":"Lovely little dessert place. My boyfriend and I stopped by after dinner and decided to try the Korean shaved ice, which we had never had before. It's different than Taiwanese shaved ice - in fact, I thought it was better! It looks like shredded coconut flakes and doesn't melt easily, but has a lovely milky yogurt flavour (not too sweet or too tart).

There are a number of flavours available in a small or large bowl size. We ordered the large strawberry shaved ice to share ($11.99). It came with sliced strawberries, strawberry puree, a scoop of ice cream, and condensed milk. It was a decent size, good for sharing between 2 people. I have nothing bad to say about it; it was like eating a delicious strawberry yogurt sundae and they were very generous with the sliced strawberries.

Will definitely revisit to try some of their drinks and other flavours of the shaved ice!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to get bingsu (shaved ice). This place is very cozy, can sit about 15 people. It is a family run place.

The food: very authentic bingsu, lots of flavours to choose. Most popular ones are Tiramisu and Injeolmi. Small one comes in cup and big ones in bowl. I had the Injeolmi, love the soybean taste and it is not too sweet. 

This place is perfect for date or catching up with few girl friends.

I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here during lunch on a weekday and it's packed.  They serve Korean shaved ice, toast and drinks.  I had the Injeolmi shaved ice and taro latte.  Injeolmi is my fave; it's milk shaved ice with soybean powder and rice cake.  The shaved ice is fluffy, airy and light.  The rice cake is soft and chewy.  I like to get it in a cup; not only it's the right size for one, it also looks good with the layers in a see through cup.  Taro latte is smooth and in nice purple.  Decent service and prices : )"}
{"text":"The location is near the piggy restaurant so I came here after pigging out in piggy restaurant and decided to have dessert with the girls(friends) so we decided to order Injeolmi and mango shave ice cream. The look on these shaved ice cream look amazingly tasty! The injeolmi have mochi and some nuts perhaps? I could be wrong... but there's some syrup/sauce/cream that sweeten the fluffy shaved ice and allows it to melt and bind together, it wasn't too sweet so it taste really good, i love the Mochi texture as it was chewy but not to the point that tires u easily either or get bored of it easily. Additionally to injeolmi, I have also ordered the mango one.... this is sweeter and more refreshing as mango flavour entice the taste bud and makes everything more tropical! I like the fact that this one have mango sauce or syrup swirl in it and the ice cream also have some shaved almond! I believe this creates a perfect balance in the dessert. Overall I enjoyed the experience at this location... I won't say that this place is fancy, however is cozy, it's pretty small but you can fit about 25-30 people maximum in this location. Pretty bubbly place. I would definitely come back and try their coconut latte as I love coconut and who doesn't like a well crafted latte?"}
{"text":"The shaved ice is amazing! I had the tiramisu and at first it looks like a lot but the ice melts into a delicious ice cream, I will deff come back to try he other flavours !"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Bingsu that I've had in a while, highly recommended to give it a try. 

The restaurant is quite small, where there are only 2 tables and some bar stools, so it's better that you drop by in a small group of 2 or 3. The space is quite nicely decorated and good for catching up with friends, but keep in mind that they do impose a 1 hour seating limit since the space is quite limited, and I'm pretty sure they don't do reservations. Free wifi is available. 

Other than the Bingsu they also serve drinks such as coffee, latte, and smoothies. For the Bingsu, they come in 2 sizes: the cup size (roughly $6) and the bowl size (roughly $10). The bowl size is so much more worth it in my opinion as you get more of the toppings at the top, and generally the presentation looked better as well. 

Between me and a friend, we split the Red Bean Bingsu among us. The Bingsu had toppings include red beans, soybean powder, mochi, chopped almonds, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and drenched in condensed milk. I really like how the texture of the ice was different than some other places that I've tried. As opposed to having a creamy texture like the shaved-ice that I've tried before, the Bingsu here was more dry and powdery looking, which reminded me of coconut sprinkles. I really enjoyed my meal and I would definitely pay another visit if I happen to be around the Yonge/Finch area again."}
{"text":"I ordered the mango shaved ice ($10.99). The service here is much faster than that of Snow Time and similar to them, they only take cash or debit. 

I didn't enjoy the shaved ice that much. I don't know if it's because I made a bad choice with the mango. The mango didn't taste fresh, and it didn't go well with the cheesecake cubes."}
{"text":"Decent price but the fruits they using are all frozen fruits...... meh... My first and my last visit. For sure not coming back."}
{"text":"The Cups deserves its four-star rating on Yelp. Probably some of the best bingsu you can get in Toronto!

The location is pretty small so big groups might have to choose a different place. You can look at a menu which includes not only bingsu but snacks and drinks (like lattes).

For the bingsu, you can choose between a cup and a bowl! A cup is around 8 dollars each with tax while a bowl is around 11ish. At first I thought it was pricey for a cup but when I got it I realized how huge it was. Definitely share! 

They have a variety of flavors like mango, strawberry, matcha red bean, and tiramisu. Unlike Snow Time, they also add a scoop of ice cream to the top. You pick up your bingsu at the counter when it's ready. They put a lot of effort into the presentation here and it is so worth it. I had the matcha red bean in a cup and it was delicious. Loved the chewy, fresh mochi (Snow Time's mochi not so much). Just like Snow Time, all ingredients are layered. With my matcha one, I feel there wasn't enough matcha and by the time I got to the middle I felt it was mostly ice! Maybe it would be better if I got the bowl next time. I understand how it might be difficult to layer in a cup. I think it also depends on the flavor - my brother's tiramisu looked like there was good flavor all the way through.

Service is no frills and self-serve but courteous and friendly! When you're finished with your bingsu you take the tray they gave you back to the counter. There is free wifi and the password is on the wall by the door.

I feel like you can't quite compare Snow Time and The Cups. Totally different locations and decor and even flavors (The Cups has tiramisu and black sesame, Snow Time has a mixed fruit bingsoo and Oreo...). Their bingsu is very similar with small differences here and there (I think Snow Time layers a bit better in this case and The Cups has better mochi). Both are solid choices. Either way, will definitely be back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"We were in the area, and wanted some dessert after eating lunch one day. The Cups is a small dessert place off of Yonge Street. I have never had Korean style shaved ice before, so we decided to stop by. We ended up ordering a strawberry shaved ice to share. The dessert is huge, with tons of strawberries and ice cream over the shaved ice. I really enjoyed the texture of the ice, which was more powdery and dry as compared to other shaved ices. I definitely recommend sharing the large shaved ices as the portion is pretty big."}
{"text":"I went on a good day. The place is quite small but there wasn't many customers. My friends and I tried the large sized tiramisu milk shaved ice and it was amazing! The shaved ice was so finely shaved it was like eating milk-flavoured snow. Snow. I kid you not. The staff and the overall feel of the restaurant was great as well. I highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"I came here as a group of four and we got the tiramisu and mango bingsoo. I saw a lot of photos of the tiramisu on Instagram and had to come try it. It comes with a slice of cake and a pitcher of expresso which you pour on top. In all honesty, I was disappointed in the quality. The espresso shot tasted great but the tiramisu cake and biscuit it came with were very mediocre. It was also incredibly sweet to the point where it was nauseating. Even the espresso did not cancel out or balance the sweetness. There was way too much condensed milk inside and the cocoa powder is sweetened which made it worse. The espresso shot is also impractical because it is hot, which melts the shaved ice. The tiramisu is definitely more visually appealing. The mango came with generous fresh chunks and pieces of cheesecake. It was decent but the flavour is more artificial than Snow Time. I have yet to try the injeolmi (soybean powder) flavor here as it is my favorite at Snow Time. 

Seating wise, the place is very small- I was rather surprised. We visited at night (half an hour to an hour) before they closed so we were able to sit at a table. Overall I was disappointed but I will try the other flavours next time."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, decent prices, but more importantly: DELICIOUS. 
THE BEST bingsoo I've ever tried in my life. The ice itself is this powdery snow texture, and the toppings and sauces are generous, so you'll be enjoying whatever you order. 

My friends and I all ordered the cup sized versions: I got Injeolmi, and they got Strawberry and Tiramisu. All 10/10. 

We also ordered the King Dumpling (pretty decent, but I'm not really a dumpling loving person) and a coconut latte (creamy and delicious). 

WILL recommend and WILL be returning :D"}
{"text":"I would've given this a 5 star if it didn't take so long to get your order!

Since going to the Markham location last month, I've been craving their bingsu. This visit, I ordered a cup of chees bingsu. The ice is so fine and pillow-y, the pieces of cheesecake strategically layered and generous with slivers of almonds make this worth the visit - even when it's cold outside!! 

It's a small, narrow shop and has about 20 seats, so if you come with a big party, you'll probably have to wait or take out. 

It's also a nice surprise that they serve some savoury offerings, that king dumpling was calling my name so I will definitely have to come back and try them with another cup of bingsu of course!

Korean bingsu is nothing like the Taiwanese version (can sometimes be icy and rough) so I hope you give it a try."}
{"text":"After dinner me and a friend came here for dessert. This place is self serve so you need to order and pick up the food by yourself. We got the green tea bingsoo. At first I thought the shaved ice was coconut because it looked very dry. So good!!! I took a bite and I just kept smiling. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"And the search for Toronto best shaved ice begins! Oh wait I may have found it already! Cups is another hidden gem that features bingsu (shaved ice) in various great flavors including Strawberryand Injeolmi, as well as lattes, smoothies, sandwiches and bibimbap which is served in cute little to-go cups perfectly sized for a quick office lunch run! I personally loved the strawberry bingsu and it tasted a lot like Strawberry milkshake. The store is super cozy and small so it's quite perfect for a cute little date night. The berries bingsu is totally Instagram worthy as well!

Because this is their second location for their family-run shop, quality service warm hospitality, and amazing bingsu has brought increasing foot traffic to their store!  Can't wait to go back and try all their flavours!"}
{"text":"This place is bombbb!! 
1. Park your car
2. Line up
3. Order the tiramisu or mango 
4. Worry about the calories later 
5. Demolish your cup 
6. Get back in your car and drive off
7. Come back tomorrow 

True story"}
{"text":"I tried the tiramisu and mango cups. We probably left around 1/4 of it because once everything melts at the bottom it just tastes like pure cream and syrup, way too sweet. The beginning part was ok but also too sweet. Their shaved ice is a really nice texture though. They should consider increasing the shaved ice to toppings ratio
The place is also really small can probably fit 10 people, and they have a 1 hour sitting limit.
They do have free water with flavored syrups that you can add in for free."}
{"text":"Small place, limited seating time. There's paid street parking near by. Desserts are good! They have many flavours of Korean bingsu. They also have coffees, lattes and snacks if you're hungry. 

Tried to order something different from my usual. I ordered the mango bingsu, cup size. The Korean bingsu here is one of the best. I really liked it. The texture was really fine, pretty much like snow. But the mangos were hard and sour which I didn't like too much. If it were sweeter it would've been better. 

Will be back to try their other flavours."}
{"text":"The Cups is a small shop on the busy Yonge Street, mainly famous for their shaved ice dessert :) I was following them closely when Yelp hosted the March Munchness battle back in March on IG, and The Cups actually won the championship in the entire GTA! Finally get to try it today :)

I order the Injeolmi Shaved Ice in a cup. It was topped with roasted soybean flour, condense milk and mochi :D I think the cup size was a decent size for one person. The shaved ice was light and fluffy as snow. I really enjoyed it and I'd definitely come back to try more flavours!

I also ordered a Ham & Cheese Sandwich... but they ran out of Ham, so Turkey it is! The sandwich was a bit funky, made with Kraft cheddar cheese, turkey, strawberry jam, and a scrambled egg made with corn kernels (what?). It was delicious in its own odd ways but I will just stick with shaved ice next time lol.

P.S. There is a 1 hour seating time limit because the place only has 4 small tables and 1 bar area. Maybe the one on Glen Cameron location is bigger?"}
{"text":"My go-to place for Korean shaved ice. Its actually shaved milk and they call it snowflake bingsoo. Very sofy flakes and toppings are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Came here because I read a review saying that it's lighter than the Chinese shaved ice? It was the sweeeeeeeeetest I've had. They offer two sizes - cup size and bowl size and it was too sweet I couldn't even finish the cup sized one... Maybe it would be better if I got the bowl size? so the syrup could be more spread out?? 

Anyways, totally out of context, my favourite shaved ice is still the green one from Hong Kong's Ocean Park"}
{"text":"Some of the best Bing su in town! Whenever I'm in the area I take my friends here. It's a wonderful quaint shop, really friendly staff, amazing portions and of course awesome possum Bing su. The tiramisu Bing su is by far the best- the large size comes with a small pot of espresso to pour over"}
{"text":"This is the smaller location of The Cups (bigger location is up North on Glen Cameron road)

I am a big fan of The Cups, and this location serves the same selection of great shaved ice desserts and drinks.

Seating is extremely limited in this location (hence 4 stars), so coming here at off-times are recommended."}
{"text":"I was introduced to the wonders of Korean shave ice first at one of The Cups locations and this had exceed my original expectations of shaved ice on so many levels. I grew up in China and am used to eating street stall shaved ice that are coursely shaved with fruits and syrup drizzled onto it. The coldness and sweetness of various artificial syrup flavors was enough to satisfy my young taste buds, but my shaved ice experience stopped there as well. 

When I was brought to The Cups by a group of my friends last year, I could not believe the quality and variation of shaved ice that was offered here! The shaved ice here is super fine so that it looks more fluffy like snow rather than crystalline shavings that I can see. As a result I can easily enjoy the coolness of the ice shavings without tasting the courseness from the traditonal shaved ice I had in my childhood. The toppings also impressed me, they have variations of different fruits, tiramisu, rice cake/mochi, condensed milk etc. I have tried the tiramisu, the soybean powder mochi (Injeolmi), and the mango shaved ice. My friends ordered black sesame, cheese and matcha flavors and all seem to enjoy theirs tremendously. I have no doubt I would be happy with any other shaved ice item on their menu in my future visits. 

There are cake option and savory sandwich options a well on the menu for those that find shaved ice too cold to eat in the winter. I myself still like enjoying shaved ice from The Cups even during winter."}
{"text":"I am hooked. Bingsu may well be the best discovery of 2017 I have made. Cups' bingsu is the best in Toronto. I always order the large size to share between 2. Gotta recommend the mango, tiramisu, and black sesame. 

Before Cups, Snow Time in Scarborough was my go-to until they recently changed up their menu and are much stingier with the topping. The portions here, along with amount of toppings, are generous and the service is good. Cups leaves me super satisfied until my next craving... which is as soon as the next day. 5/5 everytime. Eat at Cups."}
{"text":"Best bingsoo in North York! Their injeolmi shaved ice is perfect.

The winning point of their bingsoo is the snow texture (super fine, like eating actual fluffy snow) and the fact that they layer the flavours so that you get condensed milk, almonds, soybean powder, and mochi with every bite. I expect that this place will be pretty crowded during the summer time. 

Seating area is small, so don't bring more than 4 people to this place unless you're getting takeout.

The pictures, from what I've ordered, are photographically accurate so you won't be disappointed.

TL;DR pictures are accurate for what you're getting and bingsoo texture/flavours are perfect!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I actually went to the Yonge and Steeles location thinking it was the same one, but apparently this Yonge and Finch location is the only location that carries their hot food (the Musubis and bulgogi rice in a cup, etc.)
So we finally came to this location hoping to order their bulgogi rice in a cup, but turns out they didn't have it that day. How lucky. Instead the lady recommended us to try their bulgogi sandwich with kimchi (~$6). Long bun stuffed with bulgogi meat, lettuce, cheese, mushrooms, and topped with kimchi. The sandwich was cold, the meat inside wasn't too hot either. I recall bulgogi being more of thinly sliced beef instead of these thick cuts. There were a lot of mushrooms stuffed inside so that was nice. 

I also ordered the black sesame latte. This was really good, strong in black sesame flavor since it wasn't powdered flavor but grinded real black sesame. Essentially tasted like black sesame milk. Quite expensive for a small cup though, I think after tax it was $5.29 for a small.

Will want to come back when they do have their rice cups and give a more updated review."}
{"text":"Portions are very good and the price is not bad. The best part is you don't have to wait for hours like snow time so honestly if you want good shaved ice and not have to wait forever, come here! They have seating and the desserts come out at a good pace! You can also get free coffee or tea if you like and follow their page!"}
{"text":"My first trip here was on one of the most coldest days of last year and I decided to come here for dessert haha. For the first time, I ordered the mango bingsoo, cup size and I shared that with my sibling. The \"snow\" part was actually milk based, not iced like other shaved iced places which is good. The only part of what made me not want to return was the mango pieces. I felt like there were some fresh cut fruit and others that tasted plain weird. The pieces broke easily when I bit into it. You can compare that as if you are eating a apple, it did not taste right as if they had it in their container for a long time.

Second time I came and got the green tea bingsoo with my friend, it was much better than my initial experience. The injeolmi (soybean powder) complemented the shaved ice and green tea/matcha very well. I would return again to try their other menu items!"}
{"text":"One of the best Bingsoo in the area. I came two days in a row, ordered Mango Bingsoo on the first day and Cheese Bingso the day after, both in a Cup size. After trying both flavors, I like the cheese bingsoo better as the mango bingso was quite oversweet. The mango one has both yogurt ice cream and mango puree so that the taste is doubled sweet. They also used frozen mango but that is not a problem for me because they need to use frozen fruits to avoid the snow ice from melting. For the Cheese Bingsoo, they use frozen cheesecake and it was a nice topping to the bingsoo. I love the snow ice for its consistency. It was so good that I couldn't stop eating. The owner was very nice and accommodating. I also like this place because they offer bingsoo in a cup size that we can eat on the go. 

Overall, I love this cute little bingsoo shop. I totally recommend and definitely come back every weekends."}
{"text":"Korean Shaved Ice!!

The Cups offers smaller individual shave ice at $5.99 which is just perfect for me as I could able to order a smaller size for myself. No sharing needed!

The store is small and basic. There is a one hour limit per seating. But I was there when the place was empty. I ate my treat and left happily after 20 minute.

Injeolmi (Korean mochi, shredded almonds and soybean powder) with just a touch of condensed milk. Perfect!

I will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good shaved ice, liked the tiramisu flavour"}
{"text":"This small joint for Korean shaved ice is pretty good. Not too far from Finch station getting there by public transit isn't a problem. The dessert here does not disappoint because it was really good. I ordered the cup size and it was already pretty big, they also have a large size in a bowl and I think that can be shared between 2-3 people. I ordered the mango shaved it and it was fantastic, the mango syrup with the ice cream and the shaved iced, it was a perfect combination. My friend ordered the Tiramisu shaved it, and he loved it. The Tiramisu one wasn't as sweet compare to the mango one. Next time I hit this join I will try the matcha shaved ice. This place is really small, it can only hold up to 15-20 people, I had a 1 hour seating limit, so it isn't the best place to catch up with friends. 

Services: 3/5
Food: 4/5
Environment: 3/5

Overall: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Mmmmm Korean shaved ice! I like it better than the Chinese version since it feels lighter and less sweet (so it must be healthy right?!).

I've tried the injeolmi and tiramisu flavours and trust me - the injeolmi one is the best. Milky fluffy bingsu with little mochi bits, it's heavenly. Tiramisu one was good too, a slice of tiramisu cake at the top and good hints of coffee flavour throughout, but found it a bit too sweet for my liking.

Definitely coming back for some of their fruity ones next! 

OH! And their lattes are pretty good too - the coconut latte is perfect to warm you up! 

Cups needs to open up a 3rd location and expand lol"}
{"text":"A family-owned business serving Korean desserts and savory dishes such as Cup Baps and Musubis. I've recently developed an addiction for Bingsu (Milk Shaved Ice), so I had to go check out 3 of their most popular flavours of Bingsu served in a cup. Alternatively, if you have a large group of friends, it can also be served in a large bowl. 

Mango is always my automatic go-to, but if you're looking to try something different, check out the Injeolmi Shaved Iced. If you visit their newest location at 5418 Yonge Street in North York, free visitor parking is available at the back of the building."}
