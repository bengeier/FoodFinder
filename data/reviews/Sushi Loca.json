{"text":"Sushi was ok, nothing extraordinary. LIke most sushi places in LV they are owned by Korean folks, not Japanese. If you know your sushi you know it is not the same. It is ok if you want sushi on the go. Go to Raku for authentic sushi, the real Japanese style. Pricey but worth it! Make reservations ahead of time at Raku."}
{"text":"We love the sushi here.  The fish is fresh, the service is usually quick, and you will leave very, very full.  Here are the only complaints: their music (club style) is always so loud that it is hard to have a conversation; and the names of some of their sushi rolls are vulgar and distasteful. C'mon people... Remember that kids also come into your establishment!"}
{"text":"The best sushi in the northwest and now in summerlin! 

Servers are generally nice. Haha it depends which one you get. 

They have great drink specials. Once they had buy one, get one free bottles of sake!

Sushi is ALWAYS fresh. I've never had a bad roll. 

I recommend the Jackpot and the Heart Attack."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here about 11:00 on a Saturday nite to get some late nite sushi. I believe the roll I ordered was called the double down. Sounded good on the menu but when it got served it looked like some fear factor  challenge. Tasted like it too. Ordered a spicy tuna hand roll and it was better than the roll but not much. Edamame and the miso soup were the best things I ordered and def was not worth the price. The music they played was the worst playlist of songs I ever heard and I noticed it even more Bc the food was so horrible and it was kind of an appropriate soundtrack to the meal"}
{"text":"I'm new to Vegas. So I don't know that many places to go to or even try. My family and I went and were very pleased. I thought this place was great. Very nice environment  and great food too! A little more than I would like to spend, but you can't beat the quality."}
{"text":"Whoever keeps telling me this place is good has never had good sushi. The food and service was awful.. Probably one of the worst sushi places I've ever tried."}
{"text":"I live in close proximity to this sushi place so I had the opportunity of trying them out multiple times.

The ambiance is relaxed and generally good in this place. I like the portions because they are slightly larger than average so you can enjoy sashimi better IMHO. The sushi is served fast and they are delicious. I haven't tried their rolls but their nigiri sushi are good. Soft shell crab appetizer is recommended as well. 

If you are looking for a good, casual sushi, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was here with my friends last week. Everything was awesome...love the food here, all fishes was fresh and they have some special fishes also you mush try. Service very nice here. Me and my friends will come back here again :))"}
{"text":"Amazing selection! Great ambiance and outstanding service! My favorite sushi place in Vegas."}
{"text":"Having previously been a big fan of Sushi Loca, tonight's experience has left me mildly despondent. They may well be ok at making Americanized rolls with funky little names, but their skill with traditional sushi is woefully lacking.  

Let's start from the beginning.  The ginger and wasabi came out looking a bit tired with slightly dry crusts forming on the edges (as if they had been prepped too long before being served), and the cucumber salad with vinegar and bits of imitation crab meat had obviously been left out judging by their room-temp warmth.  Ok...I was willing to let that slide.  I wanted traditional sushi tonight and ordered the following nigiri: tuna, tamago, cucumber, and ika.  The cucumber roll looked like a three-year-old rolled it up, and it fell apart with the many slivers of cucumber scattering on the first bite (why not just put a few, or even one chunk of cuke in there?).  The too-long piece of tamago was laid over about 25 grains of rice, and the seaweed 'ribbon' did nothing to hold it together because the egg bit was five times bigger than the rice...that was fine, it still tasted ok, even if it made me chuckle.  The tuna never showed up.  Oh, I also ordered the garlic chili edamame, which was overcooked to limp greyish death, a bit like the Christmas Brussels sprouts that an English granny might serve, and the husks kind of broke up and came away along with the beans as my teeth tried to pull just the soybeans away.
  
And so to the ika, usually my very favorite nigiri!  Hmm...it wasn't really bright white...it was a bit yellowy beige, like lightly coffee-stained teeth.  Eww, what was that about?  *sniff* P-U.  Being 1/2 Okinawan and having lived in Okinawa and mainland Japan, and loving sushi, and knowing about the properties of fresh fish products (one of which is that it does not smell like anyone's ex-girlfriend), I knew that fresh ika was not supposed to smell like (I will refrain from being even more graphic than their funky sushi roll names and just say) THAT. This was not the worst part.  When I explained to the lady who asked if everything was ok that no, the ika was old, she told me it was fresh from their supplier today.  I told her I didn't care when she got it or from where and that it was way off and asked her to smell it.  She smelled it and told me that was how it was supposed to be and that's what raw squid is like.  I don't blame her for trying...she had no idea if I'd ever eaten sushi before and may have assumed me to be a raw fish virgin (it transpired in the back-and-forth that she only eats the cooked stuff there, so maybe she just didn't know herself what ika is supposed to be like).  I dread to think what illness I would have contracted had I taken her word for it and eaten the stinky raw squid.  She again said she just got it fresh and repeated that it was good. \"YOU can eat it then,\" I suggested and even managed to smile. \"I'm not touching it, and I'm not paying for it.\"  After I *finally* convinced her that it was indeed off, she became apologetic and assured me that she was going to complain to her supplier and even offered me another Asahi and dessert, but I frankly think a restaurant should take full responsibility for what it serves, and this was too little too late.

She took the rotting ika and the never-even-arrived tuna off the bill (well, break out the champers!).  I feel like a bit of a sucker for paying for any of it at all, but by then I was already feeling awkward for having complained (I know it was a valid complaint, but it's still not nice when confrontation becomes necessary, especially when the staff make it more awkward than it ought to be), and I was ready to just high-tail it out of there.  If they were willing to serve me manky old squid and then try to defend it, who knows what other ickiness they would put on my table?  Confidence totally blown for me.    

From 4 stars to 1 star in one fell swoop.  Sayonara, Sushi Loca!   :("}
{"text":"We come here all the time. Best place for sushi in las vegas for us. We don't like AYCE cuz we like to take home snacks. Oh man so good. Is a must try for sure"}
{"text":"Too loud, it's like a club atmosphere. Not somewhere I'd come again. I love sushi but this is definitely more of a friends night out or maybe a date night. Not a family place."}
{"text":"So we double dated at Sushi Loca the other night.

I'm not gonna lie, I don't usually like sushi AT ALL. The whole raw fish thing, and especially the seaweed, never really sat well me. I only agreed to go here because 1. I wasn't the one payin haha. And 2. because I planned on ordering like hibachi steak or something.

BUT! We ordered like five or six rolls and they were all equally amazing. There's nothing negative to say because all four of us thought that their sushi tasted super great! Raw fish, seaweed, and all!  I'm also a sucker for the house salad at sushi places, and their ginger dressing was def very yummy. Hope to visit Sushi Loca again soon. :]

{"text":"One of the reasons I love coming to my mother's house is that it is close to suishi loca! Of course anyone can say that they have had better suishi, especially when you go to Japan or something like that.  However, I would happily eat suishi loca any day.  

I only wished that they had their menu online showing the actual prices.  I am the type of person who likes to know how much I may be spending before I go to the place, but it seems so common nowadays that restaurants won't post their menus with prices online anymore in order to make sure not to lose someone.  I find this current practice  a bit shady, especially when you go to the restaurant and find out that each specialty roll is at least $13- $20 per roll. 

Yes Sushi Loca I am calling you out for posting a menu with no prices on your website, shame on you!"}
{"text":"There is a place that i tried in california it is called sushi loco that i fell in love with, so naturally when I saw this place i was super happy thinking they were associated with each other but they aren't. i am a sushi fanatic....i will eat any sushi even if it doesn't taste as authentic or as fresh as some other places but not this place. I actually spit out some of the food i was served because it taste like it was out of a can and slimy i almost asked them to take it back but I'm not that kind of person to ask those things so i tried to order another roll but the servers were completely ignoring our table walking around when i finally caught someone i ordered the first date. Which wasnt as bad as the first roll but it had huge chunks of tofu soaked in soy sauce. Again not the biggest complainer and will eat almost any sushi so i ate it but to top off this night they handed us the check and the waitress literally stood there waiting for our payment and we stared at her until she left but all the servers were surrounding our table like sharks and kept staring at the check 5 servers came asking for the check and my mom was so irritated that they were surrounding us for our money but not even to get us water. After finally paying we left a $1 tip and swore we would never go back... Maybe we got them on a off day because i work retail and complainers is the last thing my family and i are but damn this place really is a no."}
{"text":"Food is GREAT. Customer service could be better, it seems like they try to rush you or want you out as soon as your done."}
{"text":"The kiss of fire, poke, and Neptune are the bomb.  Jackpot roll too sweet for my taste.  But over all a very good Sushi joint"}
{"text":"Wow I've never been to such a wonderful sushi restaurant and I have been to a few in my day.  My wife and I went here on a date (we are from alaska) I thought that we had some fresh fish from being where most of
It is caught.  But I was genuinely impressed with the quality of fish served here.  We will definitely make a return visit when we are both back in town.  Awesome place very fairly priced for what you get.  $100 was more than enough for two people with drinks."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. Some of the best sushi in Vegas. I love the tepura roll."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Best sushi ever and amazing customer service. Great music and very clean and relaxed environment"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a take out dinner the other night and have to give this place a great review.  The ambiance of the restaurant is very welcoming and the appearance is neat and clean.  The girl at the hostess station took my order right away and I only had to wait 10 minutes for my food, which was made right in front of me.  The service was friendly and the food was good - on par with every other sushi place I've been to.

It is a little pricey, and some of the rolls have interesting names, but it's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"The combination fried rice is soooo good! The staff is really friendly and service is quick. Perfect little date spot, especially since my boo loves their sushi!!!! I'm definitely a regular at this great spot!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and Wow!!! They have beat lunch special in town!!! Fish is very fresh and sooo yummy!!! Big rolls and big nigiri!!! Everything tastes so good! Definitely recommend to everyone and will come back for more!"}
{"text":"First time in tonight... Walked in to a very loud atmosphere and no hostess for the first 2 minutes... Hostess showed us to our table without a hi how are you, welcome, is this your first time? Etc... Dropped the menus and left.  Since its Sushi we knew the drill and picked out what we wanted... Waited over 5min for a drink order and 8-10 min for the drink to show up.  Waiter and waitress were very cold and not personable... Gave no suggestions or told us about any specials or house specialties... Sushi was good and rolls were good.  Nice cuts of fish... So loud in the restaurant you can't have a conversation without yelling... Noticed 3 tables not bussed from my table... Not sure this place will make it if the service does not get stepped up... Summerlin Folks are not going to put up with that... Only saving grace is the food presentation is good... May or may not return..."}
{"text":"We were so excited to come across this new Sushi restaurant.  The service and food was excellent.  I am picky about sushi places, since I don't like that much of it , but my husband does.  It is just as good as I Love Sushi in Green Valley, but it is a newer, hipper atmosphere.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Sushi was great. Some of the best I have had. Unfortunately, the service was terrible. The server acted as if she could care less if we were there. Not sure if I will go back...."}
{"text":"Rolls were much bigger than expected. Much more filling too. Delicious! Very fun atmosphere, staff was great. Especially when they all stopped to do Dali bombs"}
{"text":"Service terrible - hostess was rude and took forever to get a waitress, the menu is not appropriate for children - many menu names X RATED. 
The atmosphere is beautiful dark woods and reds. If they paid as much attention to their food and their customers as they did the decor, it would be a 10."}
{"text":"Food is good, but this is one of those places where a lot of the rolls have sexual names; the sushi chefs wear tshirts with disgusting sexual phrases on them. Also, they don't take the digestive tract vein out of their shrimp. This grossed me out."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!! slow and rude waitresses, running around like their heads are chopped off! Good food though, but horrible customer service skills.

Went in for lunch and ordered bento box. When I received it, it was undercooked. So they took it back. Server looked like I was inconveniencing her. IT'S YOUR JOB. no apologies just skipped out on our table, passed by us multiple times and no acknowledgement. 

Also, beware. They won't tell you about any additional charges for whatever you order until you get the bill.

UNPROFESSIONAL and TERRIBLE service."}
{"text":"Everyone is very friendly. People are super super nice. Super nice. That's almost all it is. The menu has some really ridiculous hilarious names that my sister and I try to make sentences out of, \"Burning Sensation\" \"Tastes like my ex-girlfriend\". It is a true tribute to some of the more interesting parts of Japanese culture. 

Food: I think the sushi is a little over done here. Maybe I should stop ordering the combos. But if you're looking for very traditional, basic sushi, you're not going to get that here. Everything is augmented 10 fold. I agree with John about the fives, this place is not a five. It is Vegas so how fresh can the sushi really be? (Remember...desert?) But it is not a 1. I would say this place is very good to introduce people to sushi, people that are anti-raw fish and are just getting in the mode. This is good for that because a lot of the insides are cooked. Bring a large group here, they can take it."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience at my favorite sushi place You lost a loyal customer today. One of the sushi chefs was obviously sick or had allergies, because he was sniffling with a runny nose the whole time he was making sushi. He sneezed twice while making sushi rolls, without washing his hands. Then a customer came in, and the sushi chef shook the customers hands with the gloves on that he made sushi with, then without washing or changing gloves, he went back to making sushi....it was discussing, and I'll NEVER GO BACK."}
{"text":"absolutely love it here! one of my favorite sushi places in vegas...they have super fresh fish and awesome rolls, they are a little expensive but i dont mind paying for quality, never have.

the sushi chefs easily EASILY are the coolest in the entire valley imo, very friendly outgoing and love doing sake bombs with the parties that come in and buy rounds, great to see everyone having a fun time...although a tipsy chef wielding a 15\" blade doesnt sound too safe, its worth the risk!

best albacore belly and yellowtail belly ive ever eaten."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! 
We have been coming here for 3 years and it is always great. Sit at the Bar and ask for Charlie, he is the best. Sushi is the freshest we've had away the strip and the vulgar names of the rolls don't bother us at all.......Have a sense of humor! The staff that work here are the friendliest we have ever had at any Asian Cuisine Restaurant. They will always hook you up on your Birthday or Anniversary!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, but the people, the fun and the energy of the place earns 5 stars. It's a way's out from the strip, but worth the drive."}
{"text":"We have been to Sushi Loca a few times.  Mostly just for to-go sushi.

PROS: 

    -The overall atmosphere of the restaurant is good.  The decorations are attractive.

    -The actual sushi is good.

    -The waitstaff is friendly and helpful with the menu.

    -The soy sauce containers on every table are only low sodium.

    -Pretty food presentation.

CONS:

   -The music/restaurant was very loud.  I could barely hear the person across from me talking, which made conversation difficult.

   -NOT family friendly.  Last time me and my family went to eat there, there was a waitress with a headband that said \"f**k\" all over it.  Also, the menu has VERY suggestive names for the sushi with references to Viagra, orgasms, and \"Sex on the Beach\".  Not trying to be prude, but if you have a young kid that reads, it may not be the conversation you want to have at your dinner table when they ask what the words mean.

   -Could not find the website online.  They need to have website with the menu on it so you can call in your pickup order.

   -The waitress didn't come by the table enough.  We wanted to place our order and had to wait 20 minutes for someone to come over and get us drinks.  Then it took forever for them to come back to take our order.  We almost left.

  

They need to have a suggestion box so customers can give them feedback to improve.  Since they are a new restaurant, they should care.  I think Sushi Loca has great potential, and a great location, but they need to take steps to make it more family-friendly and accessible for more types of customers since they are in a mall."}
{"text":"Terrible quality of food. The chicken karage was burned, and the sushi was warm (which made me throw up when I left). They even charged for hot tea! Never returning.  :("}
{"text":"We've been going to this place once or twice a week for nearly two years now. Each visit is usually 60 dollars. Service is always good and so is the sushi. It also comes out very quick. 

Our last visit was roughly two weeks ago. During our meal a small cockroach scurried across the table. I managed to squash it, and then placed it in my empty cucumber ramekin. I was slightly grossed out, while my wife was exceedingly grossed out (to the max-insert valley girl accent here.) 

I handed the ramekin to the server, pointing out our visitor. He acknowledged the pest, but did not apologize, and left the table. 

Our issue? Nobody ever came back to the table about this incident. No manager visit at all. Nothing. 

I'd also like to point out that if you can see roaches in the front of the house, then there most certainly are roaches in the back of the house. 

Sushi restaurants are a dime a dozen here. And while this is really close to our house, I find it highly unlikely we'll go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sushi Loca is one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas. Your food is terrific and the service outstanding. However, the other day I had lunch with you and the music (hip-hop and rap) was inappropriate for a restaurant. I'll try again, but if this continues, you will have lost a regular customer."}
{"text":"Went on a date last night to Sushi Loca. I have been here before.... I usually go to AYCE because once you buy 2 rolls you may as well pay for AYCE... Sushi Loca does not have this option, my date and I ordered 3 rolls together and it was huge portions for rolls... More then enough... Still pricy, but great presentation and fast service.... Drinks not filled often enough.... But not terrible.... We ordered the volcano, caterpillar and a deep fried roll.... All really good.... They are heavy on the imitation krab and light on the raw fish... Wish it were opposite! Also, last time I was there I ordered the sashimi salad and it was amazing!!!! Definitely going back, I want to try the stuffed tomato...."}
{"text":"Fabulous menu, not super cheap, but the price matches the quality and they give pretty generous servings. I recommend the kiss of fire, pearl special, and their white peach sake cocktail. My boyfriend and I had a plate of rice, steak, and veggies off their large menu the last time, which was tasty. Usually their service is pretty good and a nice sushi place without breaking the bank!"}
{"text":"Wow. Coming from Hawaii, I am typically disappointed with sushi on the mainland. However, Sushi Loca is ono- whish means taste good in Hawaiian. The fish is as fresh as you can expect from an eatery with no shoreline. The creative rolls were also very good.  Also, the ramen broth was excellent."}
{"text":"My favorite is the \"three hours long\", and I love the poke here!!! I went here a few times, and I always recommend it to my friends and family."}
{"text":"I live in the northwest and absolutely love this place. The sushi is fresh, delicious, and its the best in town that I've found. The staff are friendly, attentive and its a fun atmosphere. I really enjoy coming here, I have never been let down. We have tried almost everything on the menu and it is all good all the time.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I never liked Sushi before I came here!! The staff is great and the menu is hilarious!! the waitresses all have a great sense of humor and now I am loving sushi from this place!! Jap lasagna is my all time favorite!! We go atleast 1or2 times a month!! Great prices and great taste... thats all I need in my life :D"}
{"text":"Actually it would be more like a 2 1/2.

The rolls are really good and fresh tasting, but really overpriced.  And although the decor is cool and the employees are friendly,  the place is loud.  I mean LOUD.  So loud you can't hear the person you're eating dinner with.  What's the point of eating out if you can't even converse?"}
{"text":"We love this Place!!

We are local favorites to this establishment! We love the food especially the Jackpot, Taste like my x-girlfriend and the shrimp and veggie tempura! Always friendly and fun! We visit weekly. Great food and great place to hang with your friends. Try the all night long..you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was old, felt ignored, and was way overpriced. Will not come back. Really sad I didn't just stick to my usual place."}
{"text":"Favorite non-all you can eat sushi place. Great roll variety and plenty no-rice options. Nigiri doesn't shine here, though, and some of the fish is inconsistent; even still, it's at the top of the list."}
{"text":"I left my Tom Ford sunglasses here.  Called the next day & they had them!  I'm so thankful for a honest establishment!  Thank you to the server for turning them in!  This is a really good sushi place for being in Summerlin, it's clean & really nice inside!"}
{"text":"Wife and I were shopping in Downtown Summerlin and she had the craving for some sushi & sake. This place fit the bill!

Great decor, quick service, and most of all - great sushi!

The rolls have some hilarious names that will offend some folks but who cares? Cracked us up as we sipped our sake and Asahi Super Dry. 

We had the 'Que Paso' roll and it was awesome. So good we split another. Reasonable prices, good vibe, good food. We'll definitely be heading back."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and amazing food! This is the spot for all your California roll & Beef teriyaki needs. One chef named James stands out above the rest, great job guys, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This is my local go to sushi spot service is excellent !!! fish is always very fresh . The Sushi is tasty"}
{"text":"Awful service on every level. Unfriendly, got the simple order wrong, poop in the shrimp, teriyaki was cold and we were the only table in the place. Super disappointing. Not coming back. By the way- if you ask for extra avocado it will cost you $4.50!!"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite sushi place. The rolls are HUGE, and there is regular asian food for people who aren't into sushi. If you go, try the Jackpot or the Jimmy Special, they run about $15 each, but if you're frugal like me, and want a cheaper option and your into spicy, I would go for the Hot Night. its like $7 and very good. Very friendly atmosphere. They opened a 2nd location in the Summerlin area, and thats where all the OG sushi chefs went. But this one is in a good location as well, and the chefs are still alright."}
{"text":"I thought the place was great.  I ordered the Spider roll which came out pretty quick, they had frosted mugs for the beer, and the bill wasn't sky-high.  I'm inly giving it 3 stars because as far as sushi places go, I haven't visited enough to have a bar set yet.  I DO recommend this place though"}
{"text":"We go there at least once a month and it is always delicious! The entire staff is friendly and the service is prompt. We try something new every time we go, this last time was the baked lasagna and it was just as good as everything else we've tried. I would highly recommend Sushi Loca to anyone!"}
{"text":"The sushi was alright but the waiter was really rude, she asked if I was good and left right before I even had the chance to answer her . Also, I had to wait 10 minutes for the check . The other guy that wasn't even our waiter was better to us, I would suggest the manager to check on their waiters .."}
{"text":"Terrible! The food was bad to put it kindly & the service was somehow even worse. My boyfriend will tip 20% or more no matter what, however when he looked at me & said \"you can fill the tip section\" I knew his food was just as bad as mine. The dirty dishes remained on the table the duration of our meal even though the apps were done  (when I say done I don't mean completed) before the entrees were delivered. The shrimp hibachi was greasy & room temp... The list goes on and on but to make a long story short. Save yourself the money & aggravation."}
{"text":"I will only come here during lunch because I would rather pay the AYCE prices at dinner other sushi places.  The lunch specials are pretty decent and for that area of town it's one of the only Japanese places.  My friend who comes to visit likes to come here because she likes the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Exactly what a sushi bar should look like! atmosphere is A+, spacious, and the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"this place is wicked amazing!!  just tried it for the first time, really close to my apt, fun, and great atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, one of the best Sushi places in town. Excellent menu and unique chef specials. Ambiance and decor is also nice. Great place for lunch and dinner alike."}
{"text":"This place is so great!  Waiters and waitresses are really nice about a fifteen min or less wait for the food.. Fat ass and Into the night rolls are my favorite, there names are kinda obnoxious, but if your kids aren't reading the menu all is well!   Enjoyed this place a whole lot, definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"I hear the sushi is great, but I didn't get that far. The service and hospitality are awful. I walked out before getting my food."}
{"text":"My wife and Grandaughter eat Sushi several times a month. We decided to try Sushi Loco. We ordered 2 pieces of Salman and that was all. The fish had no taste at all. We paid our bill and will not return"}
{"text":"After reading the mixed reviews on this place my fiancé and I decided to give this place a try. We were immediately greeted to happy employees greeting us at the door, sat down promptly and served drinks immediately. We sat at the bar and the sushi chefs took our order.

The rolls were amazing!! Some of the best sushi I have had in Las Vegas, and I loves the \"suggestively\" named rolls such as the Viagra roll, I did your girlfriend, tastes like your ex girlfriend. 

Even though you have to pay alcarte, the dishes are so hefty that you are full after your third or forth roll. And ultimately pay the same as you would for AYCE.

Go check it out!"}
{"text":"It's acceptable but not the best sushi in the world 2 out of the 4 rolls we ordered were decent enough to finish . They make the plate look better than the taste and the rolls have cool fun names but the taste is very basic. I most likely wouldn't come back if I wanted sushi again"}
{"text":"If you love Sushi, this is your place.  great food and fresh, love the name of the items and plates.  High energy place. The place is always jumping.   Service is great too, even when busy."}
{"text":"Sushi loca is a great place to get your sushi fix in. The atmosphere is great with loud music which can get too loud sometimes.  Everybody greets you when you come in which is nice.  The sushi is fresh and great!   The reason why not 5* is because they raised the prices on the uni they have.(which is yummy).  Also the chef I had gave me smaller peices which I guess depends on the chef.   But overall I still recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came to eat here this past Saturday. It looked packed from the outside. Walked in and we were seated right away. Waitress were very friendly. Those sushi rolls are nice and big. I didn't think I was going to get full with just one roll. Boy, was I wrong. We will be coming here again."}
{"text":"tasty sushi, great prices, good customer service, great music (lol)
what else can you ask for??!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Loca is such a fun place to go... As you walk in everyone (servers, hostesses, and chefs) stops and greets you ( I think it may be hello in Japanese? who knows, but it\"s friendly).  All the rolls are really original and have super fun names. Best of all the chefs don't get cranky if you ask them to leave a sauce or something off. They also serve edamame and some yummy cucumber dish as you're seated so there is no wait to start eating! Woot!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Lasanga roll and heartattack are my favorite! Everything tastes soo fresh!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. They have no patience for their guests, even when it's dead. AVOID AT ALL COST. Sushi is mediocre and bowls are flavorless. Staff is unhelpful."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday afternoon, the decor was inviting. The staff wasn't  as friendly as some places we have been. However, they were not rude or anything. Just not overly friendly.The Rolls are good sized portions and the sauces are really yummy. Food overall was great!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has been my go-to sushi place for like a year now and I honestly think their food is great! I've tried a lot on their menu and always love the sushi. There hasn't been anything that I ordered that I didn't like except for some spicy rolls which is totally just preference. They also serve big portions (the salmon appetizer is super huge btw). Although I've read some reviews about their bad customer service, I can say that their customer service is decent. I came here on my birthday and reserved it for 9 people, however I was running late so by the time I got there people had already taken our seats. Being my fault, they still treated us patiently, sat us down immediately, and even sang the happy birthday song. But recently when I was eating with family for lunch and asked a waitress to get a picture she totally forgot and never came back to us. I also wish the staff was a little more welcoming, sometimes they look like they don't know what they're doing lol but it may depend on the waitresses you get. Other than that the food is really good and I definitely will keep going to this place."}
{"text":"I came in on a Friday night, the service was ok, not the absolute best. Food was mediocre, nothing special. We waited for awhile to just get our check. I don't really have reason to come back, and I probably won't unless I'm meeting friends here."}
{"text":"I've been ignoring this sushi place coz of the mexican word in its name. Why a sushi place got a mexican name? But I found it in yelp and it got a good reviews. So, I gave it a try. The sushi looks good, I love sushi place that makes presentable looking sushi (it means to me that they hire knowledge sushi maker). Not only the sushi looks good, the sushi are fresh and taste good as well. They have reasonable prices. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Their sushi is so yummy, especially the Jackpot.  I live far but don't mind the long drive.  To me, this is the best sushi place in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday evening at 4pm. Super fast service; clean and quiet environment; very good rolls (esp. the caterpillar). Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Party of two, they gave us one menu. Server has no service skills whatsoever - assumed we knew the menu (it was our first time there), no introduction, no suggestion, gave us no opportunity to ask, rushed us to order, came back to refill drinks, didnt ask how we were doing, didn't come back to ask if we wanted dessert. Server, you're better off a busser.  Two stars for the food - ramen was on the salty side. Had the Jimmy Special roll - on what would be our first and last time..."}
{"text":"This place is gr8! The atmosphere is chill. And, of course, the food is gr8! Also really gr8 service!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi place in town!  The staff is friendly, the atmosphere is great, and the fish is awesome! I can't say enough great things about this place. I try and eat here as often as possible."}
{"text":"You have to get the Jackpot, mostly crab lumps. Japanese beer on tap.  The chicken yakisoba is good as well...veggies were really fresh."}
{"text":"To start, cold Edaname! Mediocre service! Double charged on my bill! That was my lunch,hope yours goes better!"}
{"text":"Being from the PNW intend to eat a lot of sushi. This is the best sushi I've had. I love the flavors and variations! No soy sauce or wasabi needed! We ordered the garlic edamame (YUMMM!), and for rolls we did the Ryan's Special, Kiss Of Fire, and A Burning Sensation. All were packed full of delicious flavor. This place is great. My mom lives close, We will be back to next time we visit!"}
{"text":"The food is great here, I have been here twice and got tonkatsu!! I absolutely love this dish!! The service here is not that great and at times they sound rushed every time we would ask a question on the menu! This place is worth checking out if you are looking to try something different."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever. The \"jackpot\" is to die for and the \"ohh she was 17\" also amazing. I'm not a die hard sushi fan because I guess I've never had amazing sushi. This place is so good. Fast and friendly service. Take note $20 or less and you have to pay cash. My friend and I wanted to split the check but couldn't because I didn't bring cash. Seems a bit cheap on the resturaunts side since for those two dishes Were $30 plus bucks. Other than that we had a great experience and will go back for sure."}
{"text":"As good as it gets. Always a fast service and delicious food. I don't think I had a menu item I didn't like - I come here once every 2 weeks. My new favorite sushi place in summerlin. 

Japanese lasagna #2 is my favorite choice"}
{"text":"Everyone we know loves this place. I thought my rolls were bland, so bland that I didn't finish half of what I ordered."}
{"text":"Love Sushi Loca it's my favorite! The rolls are amazing! Great atmosphere, and music too!"}
{"text":"So happy I don't have to drive out to the edge of town to get my sushi spot.  I love you sushi loca,!!!
Final Fantasy 2 and Burning Sensation are my favorite."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place since it was so close to home... As we were told by the hostess to \"sit down, tables dirty.\" When the table was cleared off she hollered across the restaurant,\"ready!\" And motioned with her hand.
The waitress wasn't any better not even a greeting she stood there and asked: \"what do you want?\" Her service was awful! The sushi follows suit and is equally disappinting if you've ever purchase sushi at a grocery store you're getting about the same quality here with the exceptions of the price. Here your taken! 
We will not recommend this place and will not be returning! Not only was the service terrible and the food awful it is definitely not a place you want to take a young family as the names for the sushi's are not g-rated. Very distasteful and lude...
The The ambience was anxiety inducing due to the high techno music."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood sushi joint.  Quick service, great sushi and hilarious names for all their custom rolls (you'll see)  they also do a really good lunch special.  The price is a little higher then some other sushi places but the quality is a LOT higher and the rolls are big.  Well worth the little extra.  Keeps me coming back again and again"}
{"text":"Having not seen my father in a good minute, we decided to catch up over a sushi dinner. Living across the city, we decided to meet halfway at Sushi Loca. 

What we ordered:
Yellowtail & Tuna sushi
Spicy yellowtail & tuna handroll 
Sushi Loca Special
Creamy Scallop Roll
Banzai Roll (to go)

The sushi had great flavor and didn't need any wasabi or soy sauce whatsoever. The handrolls were huge compared to other places I've frequented and I had to take one to go (I'm eating it as I'm writing this- yum)!  The Sushi Loca Special had spicy tuna and a garlic ponzu. The ponzu was unlike any other I have ever tasted before: lemony, garlicky, and lit my mouth up! The scallop roll had an interesting texture and a creamy mellow flavor. I brought home the banzai roll (cucumber, shrimp, crab, avacado, eel sauce) to the hubby and he devoured it in 2 minutes tops. 

Service was a little slow, but overall friendly. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This WAS one of my favorite sushi restaurants, but it is slowly making its way to the bottom of my list. As with most new restaurants, as time goes by, the quality goes down. I consistently get an OMG Roll that has HARD MOCHI CAKES. The current order I'm munching on right now is covered in undercooked rice. I use to get complimentary edamame with my to-go order, not anymore. They must be getting really cheap, but the prices sure haven't dropped. I can't afford to get poor quality sushi here for their prices. Sorry Sushi Loca. I have to move on."}
{"text":"Sushi is good. Fast service. Never a long wait. Close to my house. I come here pretty often. I'm kinda plain when it comes to sushi  Cali roll philly roll spicy crab and shrimp tempura us my favorite!"}
{"text":"I remember when this place first opened.. I absolutely loved eating there. There was a sushi chief named Jack who made it experience very fun.  However these last couple times I have gone I've been very disappointed. The sushi has tasted and looked awful...like tonight, I ordered a spicy tuna roll. The roll looked like complete shit. It was sloppy, overly stuffed with tuna and not enough rice. On top of that, it tasted horrible."}
{"text":"Finally, a good sushi joint in the northwest!

They have everything from standard sushi to some good creative rolls, nice atmosphere, good service.  I'm especially happy there's a number of tempura rolls on the menu.

And the Final Fantasy rolls have to be tried.  Great presentation, and very tasty!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time. They have the best sushi in town and the fish is always so fresh. I love that they are open so late throughout the week as well!"}
{"text":"Absolute favorite sushi restaurant. Me and my boyfriend really enjoy going here. Great atmosphere and yummy sushi! Rolls are big and leaves us full and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Best freakin' sushi in town!! And the ambiance is amazing. For recs you should start with the hoshiusagi sake (Star Rabbit), which is a smooth tasting sparkling sake (and be careful cuz if you get too comfortable, it will get you!). For rolls I tried the \"crazy horse\" (a tempura roll with baked salmon, cream cheese and cucumber) and the \"oooops she was 17\" (a baked roll with salmon green onions and jalapeños; aka one of the best rolls I have tried!!). My wife and her brother tried other rolls and they have the same great experience that I did. So if you are looking for good sushi, good ambience and a great experience, go to Sushi Loca! Peace out!"}
{"text":"Gosh
I went to summerlin down town one,  environment is so dark even lunch time , rolls are same as other sushi restaurants but more expensive !
Bad thing waitress is so unkind and terrible!
I dropped the spoon , and asked her to have new one but she sighed and brought so late !
Hmmm .. not much recommended!"}
{"text":"My friend from back home in Hawaii who moved here not even 4 months ago introduced me to this place a few months ago. At first, I LOVED it! Well, last night was the last straw for the both of us....the service AND the owner are EXTREMELY rude with the exception of a server and busperson. It wasn't crowded at all at 9:45pm when we go there. So we thought: \"great! In and out. Order our food and we're done.\" Didn't happen that way at all. Don't want to go into great detail except to say we both are \"foodies\" that know alot about food, drinks, deals and service. This place is DEFINITELY NOT on my list of places to go to for good, quick service. Yes the food is pretty good but I'd rather we try other places from now on when it comes to sushi and japanese food. Sushi Loca, you've lost 2 great tippers because of last night. Sayonara!...."}
{"text":"To bad we would never go back to this place anymore, the worst service you will experience in a restaurant, no Manager or owner is there to take your complaint and the staff doesn't care"}
{"text":"Love Sushi Loca...we come here often and I always get the Orgasm-ugh my mouth is watering just thinking about it lol. We have never tasted anything that we did not like. The service is great-the staff is so welcoming and pleasant. I love the set up as well, its a pretty big place so you are never waiting too long to be seated."}
{"text":"I LOVE you this place!  Fresh sushi and I love how they greet you when you walk through the door. Service is outstanding as well. One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"9:30pm on a Saturday we came in with a group of friends.  Apparently because it was later in the evening (they close at 11) the mad rush before us wore them out and their energy level was at an all time low based on our past experiences.  

First off the mood of the place wasn't as it usually was.  The music was down low (which usually is so bumpin by this time of night) and there wasnt any loud exciting greetings when we walked in the door as we have always had in the past. There were still quite a few people there being that it was later in the night which dwendled down the longer we were there.  

We asked at the beginning that we have the bill separated accordingly which they said wasnt a problem.  We ordered some drinks and then ordered our first round of rolls etc.  The food came out timely.  Our first round of food was done and the plates occupied the whole middle of the table the rest of the time we were there chatting and finishing our drinks.  We would have loved to put some more orders in however the servers were MIA.  This was a big bummer because I was still hungry!!!  Grrr.

When the bill came out it wasnt separated as discussed in the beginning.  Not to mention we didnt realize till we saw the bill that there were things we ordered that we never received but were charged for.  Carazay.  lol   So another 15 minutes trying to separate what everyone ordered and deleting the orders that we didnt receive etc...still all while the pile of dishes took up most the table.  My added pic says it all.

Between all of us we all ordered a little bit of everything so too much to remember.  But there were no complaints about the food other than we didnt get all of what we ordered and we were still hungry.  The service is huge for this place though.  I've always thought the service made this place stand out from the others and maybe it was an off night for the crew.  Hopefully the next time I can put this back on the 4-5 stars which is expected.  The only reason for the 3 starts is their food is good!  And the past experiences have been good ones.  I'm hoping that the next visit will overshadow that last."}
{"text":"Excellent spicy tuna tartare.. Service was great. Food was outstanding. Servers are very friendly appetizers came out quick. The yellow tail was also amazing. Not eating carbs right now. Spicy tuna hand rolls with no rice came out big generous portion and was delicious. I would recommend this place. Would Even drive from Henderson to go visit again."}
{"text":"Rarely have I ever craved sushi. Except, Sushi Loca has made me consistently wanting to come back.
This restaurant is a friendly environment that is suitable for dates, bringing friends/family, and even to eat by yourself. 
The salmon sushi is by far my favorite--especially for the price. It always tastes fresh and you definitely get a large amount for your money."}
{"text":"Great place for group lunches/dinners, these guys have awesome customer service as well as food! I am normally in and out within 30 minutes! The only reason I don't give the place 5 stars is that the names of some of the food items are very inappropriate. I understand that the restaurant is aimed towards an adult crowd, but I've seen a lot of kids there, and it would seem a bit odd to hear an 8 year old order an \"XXX\" or a \"One Night Stand\". If the name of what you're ordering really doesn't bother you, then you should be fine. The waiters/waitresses are very helpful and the food arrives quickly. The music playing in the background is always good, and overall, Sushi Loca is a modern and fun restaurant to go to for a great meal with not much waiting."}
{"text":"This place is spot on.  We go there a few times a month.  Its not the cheapest sushi around but the quality and service makes up for the prices.  Recommend the shrimp friend rice and shrimp killa Roll"}
{"text":"The I love my ass was freaking amazing. The choi's favorite was great and so was the I did her sister. Everything came out as it was prepared so it was was pretty quick except my husband's chicken teriyaki took like 45 minutes to come out."}
{"text":"Great service love there sushi roles it is a little expensive but the service and quality are more then above average."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  My favorite place for sushi in Las Vegas!!  Lots of variety, tastes great, nice atmosphere, fast and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Sushi is good and tastes fresh but service is so-so. We arrived and our drink orders were taken right away. After about 15 minutes of waiting we finally had to wave a server down to take our order. When we asked her questions about the menu she was not really knowledgeable about it. She was not helpful. The wrong sushi plates were delivered to our table (no big deal). Overall the food is good and you get it fast once you order it but the servers are not very attentive. We had to wave someone over again once we finished eating. 

I will say the booths are nice, big and private and can seat 8 comfortably. Oh and I highly recommend the cherry blossom. It was delicious! We took a bite and devoured it so fast there was no chance for a picture."}
{"text":"Great place! Nice and clean. I had the \"kiss of fire\" and it was amazing!! I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"Walked through the door and waited 10 minutes to be seated when the place wasn't even busy. Our waitress was rude and unhappy and the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Not sure if reading the previous reviews made me aware of this but the service does feel a little cold. Had the miso noodle soup and the broth was overpowering in my opinion. I will go back and try the sushi which really looked fresh."}
{"text":"Oh my god this is the best sushi place I have ever been to! Thank you Hong for our amazing sushi!! Can't wait to come back for more!! 
Not only was the food amazing but so was the customer service, everyone was really sweet"}
{"text":"Best sashimi sampler with  and awesome rolls"}
{"text":"They have good sushi and other stuff .  I wasn't to impressed  with the sushi .   But what I did loved  the spicy garlic ponzu sauce .   Beef plate was tender and good ."}
{"text":"Great location and awesome atmosphere!  Love the Japanese Lasagna #2 and the Rolley Rice bowl.  Prices are good!"}
{"text":"This is of the best sushi places out here! The happy hour has many great offers. They have a great liquor selection. The staff is very good and friendly. I am very glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"This was mine and my husband's all time favorite sushi spots in Las Vegas! We lived close by so we were very happy when we found this place. 
My favorite dish was the tuna poki!! It's served with seaweed salad mixed in and onions, The tuna was always fresh!! We are the raw fish kind of sushi eaters so freshness is very important to us...
Another thing about this place is the name of their rolls...they have a roll called \"Taste like my Ex Girlfriend\" we always get a kick out of it when the waitress brings it out to our table. 
Great place, great vibe and great service!! Can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"They had us wait 15 min to even take our order, then when the waitress finally came over she had an attitude!  And...  they weren't even busy!  Never ever coming back!"}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi in town.  Price is right, the staff is always friendly, and the food is the freshest.  I've been here probably 50+ times and have never left disappointed.  I'd recommend the Final Fantasy 2 roll - the spicy soft-shell crab really ties everything together."}
{"text":"Like a moth to a flame, I return to the overpriced Sushi Loca. I thought maybe I had been in a bad mood my last visit, or ordered the wrong items - wishful thinking. 

This time I ordered some simple rolls, spicy tuna and regular tuna. With miso soup and a tempura appetizer to split with my date, the total came out to something absurd like $50 for what amounted to 2 1/2 rolls each. Highway robbery. 

I cannot believe this passes for \"good\" sushi in Las Vegas, or all the five star reviews on here. DEAR GOD, smell the tuna my friends. Your tuna should not smell so bad/fishy or taste so unappetizing. It was edible but certainly not fresh or enjoyable. They also charge per drink on soda (no refill). AVOID."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a few co workers and ended up getting I Did Your Girlfriend. It was ok, the pieces were huge! I will try something spicy next time. Our server was alright, not personable but very efficient...reminded me of another co worker, so I didn't mind so long as our beverages were filled and our mouths occupied. Love the shirts they wear and how they always greet everyone when they come in."}
{"text":"Love their rolls and their Chashu Ramen my favorite. I come here at least twice a week. The servers can be a bit rude but you can tell it's just from exhaustion and nothing personal. The food makes up for any short comings. Other than that it's beautiful, a chill environment, pretty cheap, and delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing. Shocked this place doesn't have a higher rating (yet). Portions are very generous and the quality was impeccable. Sushi chef was extremely personable and truly talented. Likely my new local sushi place in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is stealing from customers, they added a 20% tip to my bill without even asking, they claim is because it's a big party  (4 people and a toddler).  The worst thing is that the service was not even good, our server gave us attitude since we came. The manager on duty didn't even care when confronted about the charge on my bill and just walked away. It seems as if she was covering for the waitress. 
Definitely not coming back to this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at sushi Loca for lunch. We were there at 11:30 before the lunch crowd and the sushi chefs suck. It took forever to get my husbands sushi and we were ignored the whole time we were there. My husband loves sushi and was so upset he had to help eat my bento box since the sushi chef cared more taking care of to go orders instead of waiting on customers sitting in the restaurant. This isn't the first time we have been at sushi Loca and I don't really know if I want to go back. This really bothers me because the food is fantastic but if management doesn't care that their employees ignore customer why go back. So if you plan to go there...remember I tried to warn you. Good luck."}
{"text":"4:30pm for UNI and a few other sushi items. A few booths with customers I sit at the sushi bar. Ordered a hot green tea the waitress brings the green tea I asked her if I could get another plastic cup with no red lips stick? The plastic cups must be the new kuhl feature they slide right off the bar along with the plastic tea pot - no joke. She was like OMG really lips stick on the cup... I'm sorry.... So she brings the menu Im looking at the menu caked with old food and finger prints.... I pushed the menu away and just looked it up online... Order UNI and Hamachi  - UNI was good but the seaweed wrap wasnt wrapped correctly.... Hamachi fish was hard not good at all also the rice fell apart when I picked it up.  Not sure how in the world this place made it to a 4 star?  I stopped ordering after these 2 items. Just wanted to get out of there. Will never go back I have been to sushi bars around the world this place is substandard.... I approve this message J K KUHL..."}
{"text":"This will be an overall review of the food and staff.  I dont care what a place looks like as long as its clean and the food is good enough not to stay home and cook. We have been here a few times since they opened so we hoped for some improvement. The funny thing is when you get thru the front door they think you speak korean or japanese for some reason. I'm thinking I have been around the world a few times but your in Summerlin a local town. Get your english on point. Keep in mind I do speak a few asian languages but your in America and most of your customers aren't Asian. Staffs customer service skills poor.  Order to go one time waiting at the front door and same the guy asked me twice if I have been helped. I said don't you remember you ask me a few minutes ago and I still don't have my to go order paid in full online. The place was empty on that day. On to the food Sushi is ok most of the time. However my wife made a huge mistake and ordered the Seafood Sukiyaki it was horrible. The seafood was farm salmon and a few other odd items I think one was brown / gray tuna. No shrimp for you and that will be $18 soup aka Sukiyaki.
We are going to stop going here and just order to go from another sushi bar that is more professional with less drama also I agree with another yelper the names of the rolls needs a serious creative change its NOT dance club its local sushi bar. Also another review below was 4 star with a hair in the Ramen, How in the world do you give a 4 star with hair in the food? I approve this message J K KUHL...  Come on ES you can do A LOT better."}
{"text":"Two words: Fat Ass.

Thats all I will write in this review.

Now GO AND EAT!!!"}
{"text":"Please avoid spending your time and money here. 
Sushi was good, but there are several restaurants nearby that are on par or better which  are cheaper/equal in price + good service. 
The service here is absolutely horrible. Upon arriving we were seated quickly in a mostly empty restaurant. The table next to us had been seated probably ten minutes before as there were two guests there and two more who arrived after we did. Upon initial order of food and drink, we were never helped again unless we initiated help with service through verbally asking. The table next to us received constant attention but the servers always had their back to us and never turned to ask if we required anything. One server took our initial order and we never saw her again. Two different servers were required to take additional requests, both of which made you feel as though you were troubling them. Our tables were never cleaned, waters never filled, check never came. Completely ignored. When asked for the manager, we were told there was none. When we complained about the service, was offered no apology. Finally, we got ahold of the manager, who said she was the owner, who's only offer of explanation was that it was busy, which is was not. No apology, no offer of compensation, just a bill and a verbal indication to not give a tip if we were unsatisfied with the service.  After giving us the bill, no one came to take it for several minutes. It was so appalling it was worth walking out on the check, but still I paid. I cannot express enough that the service here is terrible and I do not believe they care at all. I don't believe they care about any of these reviews and will continue on just as they do. For the price and location, you would expect so much more and should. You receive a better experience at your local McDonald's than you do here."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Sushi Loca probably 10 times in the past 12-18 months. In general, we have always had a good experience (good food, good service, prompt food delivery).  But, my experience tonight, in combination with other recent reviews, leads me to wonder about the future of Sushi Loca. We entered the establishment at 10 pm on a Saturday and encountered a low energy vibe (low music, an absence of the traditional loud, jovial greetings).  We placed our order. Thirty minutes later, still no food.  After seeing food served to several tables around us who had arrived after we did, we asked our waitress about our missing food.  She didn't really give us a response but simply said, \"Oh yes, it is coming out.\"  When it did arrive, only half of the items that we ordered were served.  She later corrected the mistake but never apologized. My husband and I concluded that she simply lost the order. In short, food is decent.  But service and vibe is below average.  I don't know if we will be returning again."}
{"text":"The food itself is good. Fun names to their specialty rolls. Service is ok. Ambience aims to be more on the hip side which is not quite my taste but tolerable. Not very family friendly but more suited for groups of friends or adults only. But at the end of they day, yummy sushi so will return in the future."}
{"text":"The quality has gone down over the years. I remember when this place first opened. It was delicious! The fish was so fresh and the fish to rice ratio was perfect. Now the fish pieces are much smaller, more rice, and quality has gone down. I still come here since it's close to home. There aren't many good sushi places around the Centennial area. I usually love AYCE places. I would probably go here more if it was AYCE. There are still a few items on the menu that has stayed consistent on quality.  The volcano no rice is pretty good. Also the burning sensation. Oh! Try their beef udon soup!  That was also surprisingly delicious. My kids also love their hamachi Kama."}
{"text":"I ordered a Mucho Grande and Yakitori, and my boyfriend a California Roll and Elvis On the bed. I must say both were EXCELLENT, but the service and staff was a weak point. They should really be nicer and smile more!"}
{"text":"Sushi Loca is by far my favorite sushi spot! The \"68 and I Owe You One\" roll is to die for!! Also, their Screaming O and the Screaming O sauce is the best in the town! Their sushi is SO fresh and tasty. I've never had anything here that I haven't liked. The only down side is that they do not have AYCE. :("}
{"text":"Rude. No all you can eat.  Disgusting.  Our one year old had gotten car sick and while waiting for a table I asked where the restroom was. Hostess was so rude and treated me like I was trash.  Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Great tasting fresh sushi.  The staff was very attentive and professional.  Excellent place to grab a roll or three.  The beer selection was good. I wish they had a full bar though.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My sister and I eat here whenever she is in Vegas. 
I absolutely love octopus and this place by far has the best octopus sushi. Their other typical sushis are amazing as well. And the names for their rolls are hilarious and a bit dirty (if you have a poor sense of humor or are easily offended, don't go). For example my favorite so far is \"Tastes like my ex Girlfriend\". Well for us younger folks it's amusing. 
Anyways so far I've loved everything I've eaten here. Service is friendly and I have never had to wait long to be seated. Atmosphere is nice as well.  
No they do not have AYCE but their portions for their rolls are really great. I'm saying they are pretty huge. Especially the tempura or crunch rolls. So it's fine to me. Only reason it's a 4 instead of a 5 star is because the service is friendly, but often my sister and I would be stuck waiting for service. They seem understaffed. Not the staffs fault but the restaurant needs more people or something. 
Still love this place though!!!"}
{"text":"Never fails. This place always comes through with some of the best tasting sushi in Vegas. Highly recommend!! Just tried out the new Summerlin location for lunch and left a very happy customer. Taste like my ex girlfriend is one of the best!!! Baked rolls are all delicious!! Awesome job guys!!"}
{"text":"Service could really use some improvement. Maybe a smile or two would be great. I mean, it was our first time and we definitely smiled at her & she enthusiastically (not) walked us to a booth.

Anyway, thought the food would save the icky service but I was wrong. It was.. alright. Nothing special & I've definitely had better. I ordered the Sizzling Beef Hibachi.. which was definitely not sizzling when it got to our table. Actually, it wasn't even warm, except for the rice. Also, my supposed-to-be sizzling plate barely had meat. I'm sure I didn't order Veggie Hibachi. Sigh. Food wasn't terrible but it wasn't anything special & portions were ehhh. 

I probably won't be back. Oh well.. on to the next Japanese spot."}
{"text":"Ordered the short rib special that wasn't the word cheap by any means, as the taste was ok, however was chewy, very chewy...In addition before sitting down to eat we had a little conflict getting a table as someone got seated ahead of us...When this place get's busy, these people are overwhelmed...Service goes down hill, waitresses have \"hurry up what you want attitudes\"...Floors were filthy, bathroom's not bad, wrong door knobs used for commercial bathrooms...We have been here 3 times, not sure if were going back...No where to park as well on Friday nights..."}
{"text":"Gotta say.. why all the boss reviews? I just moved down from Seattle.. so maybe I have had too much good Asian food up there.. but this seemed average.. The miso.. Ranch 99 instant.. I am telling u.. it was good but I don't even think it was homemade.. Tasted instant.. 

Food was super average and very plain. Only way to excite my taste buds was rubbing wasabi on everything.. thats not very exciting either.. I don't know.. sushi chefs seemed cool.. waitress was like a dead fish.. lol.. prior to being chopped into sushi.. no expression and so bla bla bla..  

probably not going to repeat.."}
{"text":"Im a big sushi person n have had sushi all around the world n this menu by far impressed me the most with the creativity n complexity of dishes. BEST sushi ive ever had and affordable prices. leave here feeling full and satisfied without the hefty bill."}
{"text":"Still here waiting after 30 for our food. People that got here 20 minutes after us and already have their food. The host is doing everything but attending to us. Besides the horribly snail like moving service, the food is great, but won't be back again. This is my first time ever leaving a bad rating, which says a lot in all the years checking in on yelp."}
{"text":"Man I had the sashimi salad. The ponzu dressing was overwhelming with pepper flavor. The roll I had too wasn't great. It was way too saucy. With that said, I enjoyed their sake flight."}
{"text":"The food was great but we did not appreciate the names of the rolls all with sexual inuendo. I should not have to take a question from kids about orgasm and \"what does his shirt mean?...it says \"I did your wife \"....  Just not necessary in this time of increased scutiny regarding sexual harrassment."}
{"text":"Sushi is bomb!!! I love their freshness and how big their rolls are! Yes they are a tad higher in price but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Service was great. I like the waitress' outfits. The sushi menu was a bit crazy for me with rolls called \"68 and I owe you one\" but the sushi was great. I have had lots of fresh sushi living on the coast and the Torro here is awesome. It melts in your mouth. I just moved to Vegas so it took me a while to find a local sushi joint I can go to once a week. This place has the quality in the fish. The Chicken Terriyaki is so good too, it's not greasy. They make it just the way I like it. This is an awesome place for quality food, the prices are good too."}
{"text":"The service here was just ok. Took a long time to get our food. The food was good, I especially liked the tempura and the eel. We'll be back, hopefully service will be better."}
{"text":"We were not very adventurous but what we had was very good.
I had shrimp habachi with squash , Bill had shrimp and veg tempura. Both came with rice, soup and salad. All was very good. 
Atmosphere is fun, young, noisy, cheerful. Clean and efficient very fast service. All in all a great new find!"}
{"text":"If you are in the market for poor service, staff with bad attitudes and over priced grocery store grade sushi then this place is for you. The sushi was utterly dismal, to be honest I can't even describe how much I disliked it. The fried calamari was so chewy I couldn't even swallow it after several attempts. The beef teriyaki was actually pretty decent, the pot stickers were also fair but not great enough to ever draw me back into this restaurant. Japanese is one of my favorite cuisines and I've had it from various restaurants all over the country. This is by far the worst. 
As a side note noise and ambiance is very \"club-like\", loud techno music and dim lighting.
Overall a very unpleasant experience was had here and I will never return."}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant in Downtown Summerlin. The ambiance is amazing and the staff is friendly and welcoming. The vibes are sexy and fun with the modern look and fun music playing in the background. The sushi is really good but the hot plates are even better. I always get a bento box and a roll and always leave so full and happy. Im not a fan of the desserts, but everything else is amazing! At least check this place out once, you wont regret it. To be honest, I dont know why the rest of these comments are so harsh. The place is good!"}
{"text":"Fresh fish and high quality get the o toro! Great service sat at sushi bar and very fast as well"}
{"text":"The Summerlin location just gets it !!! Never a bad meal and all the staff is on point very good communication between them and yet to mention the food here is totally AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Lousy service so bad I cancelled my over priced meal and left. Do yourself a favor and head over to Oyshi All You Can Eat sushi on Sahara and Tenaya. Great food and service where the price is right."}
{"text":"Met up with friends here for lunch. We each got rolls. Forgot what the names were. I got a tempura roll. There were a lot of things in it. It was a very fat roll.

The rolls itself were good. Price was average."}
{"text":"This place is consistently very good. Tonight, we had a group of 8 to celebrate a friend's birthday, and they were very accommodating! We were one of those annoying tables that needed our check split multiple ways and didn't tell them initially. They were very nice about it all. 

I dropped a star because the tempura box was just a bit too greasy. The flavor and overall taste of everything was great though! I also had the \"I Like My Ass\" roll and really liked it. I'm picky when it comes to sushi; I'm still a sushi amateur. 

They gave the birthday boy a tempura ice cream and played the funniest Happy Birthday song over the speakers! Then a couple minutes later, another table had a birthday! It was a hilarious moment!

Sushi Loca is a great option for sushi in the Centennial Hills area. Fun music, too!"}
{"text":"Every time I walk away from a meal here, I'm satisfied.  The staff is great, the food is fresh and the environment is fun.  The food comes out pretty quick and their drink list is good as well."}
{"text":"Our ALL TIME favorite sushi spot! Everything about this place is great! I have never met a menu item I didnt like.The fish is always fresh. Never disappointed! Staff is extremely friendly, entertaining and attentive. Modern \"sexy\" atmosphere. Fun and definitely different names for their sushi rolls, who ever made the menu had a sense of humor, just dont let your child read it. Hehe.

Favorite sushi roll there: kiss of fire. DELISH!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the Pearl Special and Tastes Like My Ex Girlfriend..."}
{"text":"Great prices good variety of Japanese food with sushi, noodles, and steaks  and other main fishes. If recommend this place. They are waiting for liquor lic."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in town amazing service. My favorite rolls are the holy cow, final fantasy, burning sensation. If you want sushi in Las Vegas I recommend this place 100%"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi spot for 5 years now. Rolls are huge, lots of flavors, sauces, ingredients. So amazing! The food is undeniable. Kiss of fire roll is tangy and spicy, jimmy special is sweet. Those are my two fav rolls there. So good!"}
{"text":"This is probably the most fun and entertaining sushi bar I have ever been to. The staff is extremely friendly and fun, the sushi is out of this world, the rolls are out of control I can barely finish one roll. Just reading the menu is fun in its self. They have some of the craziest names for their sushi rolls!. I also love how large the restaurant is most sushi places I have been to are kind of tiny. Oh I suggest taking anyone whose birthday it is here they put on a nice little birthday scene."}
{"text":"Nonstop excellent food, visit after visit. Consistently high quality sushi nigiri and a wide variety of skillfully prepared rolls. We have some favorites we get frequently and the product is always top notch. 
Last night my girl asked the guy manning the bar if he could make us a special off-menu roll. He knows what we like, made a beautiful one that we loved. He comes back, asks how we liked it, and we asked him to remember for next time so we can order again. I asked his name, he said \"Ryan\". So we tell him we're gonna call it the \"Ryan Special\". He points at menu item and says \"we already have\". LOLOLOL, this guy's done this before. \"You call #2\" he says, still pointing. 
So that's our new thing, the *Ryan Special #2*
Ryan is a bomb-ass sushi chef and this place is full of good stuff. Do yourself a favor: go there, eat, then #%$&ing die happy."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for a quick sushi fix in Downtown Summerlin. Everytime I have been here, the salmon is fresh and service is generally on top of it. Sometimes there are longer than normal delays but if you just flag someone down and get their attention, it's fine.

The interior is cute, on-par with most of the local sushi spots. It has a good ambiance and an easy location. The pricing is ok, but I think it's to be expected for the large mall location. If you want super authentic rolls and options, head to Chinatown. But this place is good for a quick sushi fix in south Summerlin."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. Unfortunately the staff and management have lost interest in this location. I am not easily offended, usually I just let it go. This was such a disrespectful, juvenile, offensive act that I will never return. I've been eating here 3 or 4 times a month for 7 years, so this is no small decision. 

Eating LUNCH AT 11:45AM and blaring over the speakers of the restaurant is the song (I don't give a F) uncensored version. Kids are walking into this place with Mom and Grandma at this time. Childish BS like this has no place in a public establishment, and certainly not for a lunch crowd. After 10pm if you have no class, fine, but at lunch with kids. This is lewd behavior, and it shows poor judgment and a lack of respect. Innuendo in the menu is one thing, gross lewdness is another. I'm reporting this to Clark County Treasurer (business license division), I'm also sending a letter to each of the Clark County Commissioners. I'm also sending a letter to Steve Wolfson regarding this incident. Poor judgment like this makes you wonder what else  (they don't give a F about)"}
{"text":"We love this place!  No AYCE but the freshness, quality of the fish, and most importantly, the service are always top notch! Ask for Ryan at the sushi bar. Oysters, tuna, Hamachi, smoked salmon, salmon n tuna collars! Fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place... Never fails in quality, taste or experience. The rolls are probably the best I've had in town and the atmosphere is quite interesting! Plus the name of the rolls themselves is quite amusing."}
{"text":"So disappointed....   told waitress I had a really bad shellfish allergy 3 times only for her to bring me a plate of sashimi with shellfish.....  worse part is that there was a hair in one of the sashimi pieces.  I told the manager and no real apology given. Worse customer service imaginable.  I always try my best not to write bad reviews but this time I could not help it.  I hope they use this review to improve their business practices."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and you will definitely not regret bringing friends here or the boss for that special lunch. I suggest ordering a bunch of rolls so that you can all get to to experience their various delightful dishes."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim for lunch.  The restaurant is very spacious and decorated nicely.  My first impression of the menu was I was disappointed in the lunch specials option so my sister and I decided to split a few rolls.  We chose the Japanese Lasagna, this was the best I've ever had.  It had a unique smokey taste that really added to the flavor.  The second roll was the Fake Caterpillar, the best part of this roll is they did not skimp on the avocado and the portion size was larger than I expected.  The third roll was Chois Favorite, this roll is wrapped in cucumber, it was so fresh and yummy. The only negatives were the instant ice tea and service was a little slow to start.  The quality, freshness and taste will definitely have us returning."}
{"text":"Great sushi, but absolutely terrible service. I'm sitting in here right now and can't get a waitress's attention to save my life. There are 3 other tables besides ours and there are 3 waitresses here so it would seem like service wouldn't be a problem."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place was modern, friendly and very welcoming. Also had flat screen T.V. so you can watch sport shows. This place is clean and spacious--with the bar being the focal point of the restaurant. The women waitresses were dressed in kimonos and the men were dressed in black attire. Happy hour is from 11am-2pm.

I came in here for dinner and was very excited to check out their sushi menu. Once seated, the waitress asked for our drinks. Moments later, she came out with the drinks along with a tiny individual plate of  thinly sliced (slightly) pickled-cucumbers with shredded imitation crabs that was sprinkled with sesame seeds. A great and light appetizer to munch on while the sushi rolls were being made. All the sushi rolls that was ordered came out very presentable and got us all excited to taste. The fish all tasted fresh and the rolls were average-big in size, definitely not skimpy at all!! 

I have posted pictures of the rolls that my table ordered. My favorite had to be the \"KISS OF FIRE\" roll. It had spicy crab, spicy tuna, spicy soft shell crab, and cucumber in the inside; and spicy crab, spicy tuna, spicy soft shell crab, albacore with a slice of jalapeño with a special sauce on the outside of the roll. Definitely, it is a must-try roll! My second recommended roll had to be \"Opps, She is Just 17\" roll--the mountain of fried onion strings added an humph of textures to the simple delicious roll."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in the mood for sushi and thought we'd check this place out, with our 2 kiddoes, because it's close to our house.. And we're so glad we did! We ordered the \"Fat Ass\" roll recommended by other Yelp reviewers and holy cow! It was yumm-o! We also ordered the lunch special which was a great size serving for a very reasonable price. And for the kids we ordered their 2 item combo for $8.95! Kids loved it! The people were all very nice, great service, and great music. We will definitely be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst experience at a sushi joint for me!   Me & my husband ate lunch there yesterday & it was busy.   I shit u not there was a roach crawling across the table.   Floored me to the point of vomiting.  That only can say how infested the kitchen must be.  That isn't like hair in your food or it is raw.   That's on a whole other level of trifle.   They need the health department there.   ASAP!  I won't be back. 

**shitty thing is u can't post this on Yelp unless u put a star.  I had to put one, but they deserve negativo!!!"}
{"text":"The food is great, the location is perfect but the service is horrible.  Their English is nonexistent but instead of clarifying they just smile and nod their heads a lot so your order becomes a pot luck situation.  The server was impressed with my car and lingered around asking me uncomfortable/ tacky questions in broken English until her chef husband waved her away. I pretended I didn't understand her to save her the embarrassment. When we complained about the table not being bused, loud night club music and no refills- the manager stood over me awkwardly smiling.  Won't come again."}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite sushi in the city! Have been a faithful customer for about 6yrs.  Superb quality. Great Service. Cannot recommend enough! Favorite's are Tiger Roll, Tickle her mustache,  Loca Special, Hawaiian Pokè"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. Kiss of Fire is #1 on my list every time we go. And actually, the shrimp tempura role is really great! I'd say we've tried at least 10 different roles here and all but one were excellent. We'll be going back many times :)"}
{"text":"Literally, some of the BEST sushi I have ever had.  NO PAIN NO GAIN is my fav roll of all time.  Their garlic mayo Ponzu sauce is to die for.  I go once a week. Both locations are amazing.  So many choices and all good.  Love this place. People say the price is too high but I usually eat two rolls and here I can only eat one they're so big!!!"}
{"text":"Only giving a 2 before serving was HORRIBLY RUDE ! The hostess acted like it was a hassle to seat us and then couldn't even direct us to the bathroom without a huff and puff. When we asked for forks the waitress rolled her eyes at us, various times throughout the meal. Besides that, the food was good!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi place in the entire world. All sushi bars are held to this example of sushi. 

We travel all over this country for work and every time we eat at another sushi restaurant it always ends in the same conversation about how it's not as good as sushi Loca.

The staff is friendly and personable. 

The kiss of fire is my all time favorite roll and the fat ass or Jimmi's special are not bad alternatives. 

I don't know what else to say, but go here and enjoy it."}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars here, although we usually call ahead for take out. He gets the Chicken Fried Rice, I get the Final Fantasy 2 roll with a Garden Salad. We rarely stray from these choices, not because we've ever had anything we didn't like, but because we're not very adventurous. When we eat at Sushi Loca, we add two pots of Peach Tranquility tea. It's always good. Always friendly service."}
{"text":"Sushi place in the new downtown Summerlin center.  I had the 15 piece sushi plate (special). The chef selects the items, but it was very fresh and a great selection (2 items each)."}
{"text":"Please avoid spending your time and money here. 
Sushi was good, but there are several restaurants nearby that are on par or better which  are cheaper/equal in price + good service. 
The service here is absolutely horrible. Upon arriving we were seated quickly in a mostly empty restaurant. The table next to us had been seated probably ten minutes before as there were two guests there and two more who arrived after we did. Upon initial order of food and drink, we were never helped again unless we initiated help with service through verbally asking. The table next to us received constant attention but the servers always had their back to us and never turned to ask if we required anything. One server took our initial order and we never saw her again. Two different servers were required to take additional requests, both of which made you feel as though you were troubling them. Our tables were never cleaned, waters never filled, check never came. Completely ignored. When asked for the manager, we were told there was none. When we complained about the service, was offered no apology. Finally, we got ahold of the manager, who said she was the owner, who's only offer of explanation was that it was busy, which is was not. No apology, no offer of compensation, just a bill and a verbal indication to not give a tip if we were unsatisfied with the service.  After giving us the bill, no one came to take it for several minutes. It was so appalling it was worth walking out on the check, bit still I paid. I cannot express enough that the service here is terrible and I do not believe they care at all. I don't believe they care about any of these reviews and will continue on just as they do. For the price and location, you would expect so much more and should. You receive a better experience at your local McDonald's than you do here."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the suburban mall in Summerlin you'll find sushi Loca. Well, I would've never of known that this place was here. Best sushi I've ever had. If you care about sushi quality, definitely give this place a try. Not sure why they've only rated 3 stars, it should at least be 4-5 stars."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends and we loved it so much. Service good. All staff very nice and the rolls here is amqzing"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's located in a strip mall, so away from the hustle of the strip, but once you come inside it has a coll, trendy ambiance with a club feel because they always play music that makes you want to dance. Such a great vibe! And how can you not love this place with their rolls with names like 'I Love My Ass,' 'I Did Your Girlfriend,' '68 and I Owe You One' and 'Taste Like My X-Girlfriend.' No wonder they call themselves Sushi Loca! Love their Extraordinary Roll selection. This is a must try for locals."}
{"text":"Been to this place for a few times. I like the food. Their prices is on the higher end. I gave it a 3 star is because of the service. They definitely not up to par."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited on October 2nd. I ordered the tuna roll and the Philadelphia roll. My husband ordered chicken karage which is Tempura with ginger and sesame. His dish smelled good but he told me it was bland. My rolls were decent tasting, if misshapen. I might have ordered more if the rude service hadn't killed my appetite. The only word to accurately describe her behavior was beastly. She slammed the cucumber and ginger on the table and hit me with the plates...then walked away for over 20 minutes. She disappeared and didnt serve snyone else. Other servers walked by our table, looked at us while we waited, and though  they looked concerned they did nothing. Eventually she sauntered back to dish out more bad service, just as I had gathered my belongings and was about to walk out. There even seemed to be a manager walking around; she was dressed in nice street clothes and helped the waitresses from time to time...except for our fair maiden. It seemed the other employees avoided her, which pretty much ruled out service recovery for us. Even though the location in Summerlin is convenient to us, and we love sushi, we won't be back."}
{"text":"We live nearby and come here regularly, so nice to finally have a good sushi spot close to home.  Friendly staff, unique rolls, a great lunch special and we are particularly fond of their soups.  This is the only place in Vegas that we've found with ramen that comes close to what we had in Tokyo."}
{"text":"The food was fresh, hot and fast! I really enjoyed everything my palate tasted. We had a fake caterpillar. Yummmmm. I was kinda disappointed that I had to share with my date. Even though they were extremely busy they sat us down right away and gave us prompt and kind service. This is an awesome place to make as your weekly sushi place."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times in the last few years.Yelp asked me what keeps me coming back to this place? I like it! Never had a bad time here. Food is ALWAYS fresh and great! Service is ALWAYS great. Employees are ALWAYS friendly with a greeting when you get there and a see ya next time when you leave. There is something in this food that keeps me coming back. (I think it is in the oyster shooters!) Anyway if you like sushi this is the place! Until next time!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken Katsu and beef teriyaki lunch and I did your girlfriend roll to go. the chicken was dry but the beef made up for it. The roll was alright. I liked the sauce that came with it. Its different. 

I wouldnt mind trying their other rolls. Just reading the description makes me drool. The names are funny!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Food atmosphere price and great food. It has it all. The names of the rolls are hilarious. The rolls are different and so good!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. We ordered teriyaki chicken and it came out cold. We sent it back and it came out dry. The sushi was nothing special. The service was average."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in on a Friday night around 6:00. No one was at the front desk to greet us or take our name down for a table for about ten minutes. By then there were three more parties behind us. So someone then finally seats us. 

We take a look at the menu (which was sticky and full of sauce splatter) and many of the rolls have soft shell crab and shrimp tempura in them. So for us, we're automatically turned off. By then we're feeling stuck with our decision to eat here, so we order inari, spicy salmon roll, and Loca special roll. The rolls came out quick, but the rice was undercooked, the fish had zero taste, and one of our rolls was swimming in ponzu. Anyways we eat our rolls, but during this time no one checks on how the food is and no one comes by to refill drinks. The wait staff can't be bothered for anything as they're literally running past the tables. We ask for the bill, which after ten minutes doesn't come out. Another waitress stops by to ask of everything is okay. Well, we just need a bill. oh brother. Understaffed? Overpacked? Combination of the 2? I don't know, but the food was bad and the service was bad. No reason to come back."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the suburban mall in Summerlin you'll find sushi Loca. Well I would've never of known that this place was here, I have a meeting on the west side of town it took me over and I'm glad I found it!

What's better on a cold winters night than a warm bowl of udon noodle? Sushi Loca offers udon noodle bowls served with grilled chicken, grilled beef, tempura, vegetarian, etc. Are you Lupa bowl in the came with a side of special chili flakes to heated up even further, and it was really great!

So the next time you find yourself out in Summerlin why not give this joint a chance?

Here's the rundown:

Satisfied? Yes

Return? Yes

Advocate? Yes"}
{"text":"If you like imitation crab, otherwise known as k-rab, then this is your spot! We did have some very good rolls (caterpillar, omega,  and tempura),  and some okay ones. If you order anything with crab in it you will get about 2 tbsps of k-rab in every bite.   It is way too overpowering and makes the bites too large.  And on a neurotic note, the  circumference of the chopsticks is oval shaped instead of square;  so if you have a child with you that needs cheaters they won't work.  The decor is very pretty and the place seems very clean. I will go back, but I won't order any k-rab; and I will bring my child's chopsticks with me."}
{"text":"This sushi is SO good!! I went 3 days in a row! The server took forever with the check but the food was so good we went back 2 more times!!! Try \"The Jimmy Special\" it's AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here this past weekend, we frequent here a couple times a month for their lunch special. Their lunch specials include a variety of options and size portions are perfect, not small like most lunch specials. When we have our usual server, the service is great! They already know our order and have our order out quickly! I recommend this place to friends and family who will be in the area!"}
{"text":"Great lunch special. Large portions, definitely get your money's worth. Staff was friendly, split checks with no fuss. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I love going here. Staff is soooo friendly and fast service. Rolls are the bomb too. My usual rolls are OMG and Dynamite... After that I can only eat one more, the rolls are HUGE and great quality... A+++++"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner in sushi loca and thanks to the owner that was taking care of us and got us some awesome selection of sake. I've seen this place a million times but didn't come in since they open and probably were still trying to figure out how to run the place this time was a wonderful experience great atmosphere and the food is delicious! I'm definitely making it one of my new favorite place to eat now."}
{"text":"The sushi was good. The shrimp fried rice is excellent.  They just added screaming orgasm - I'll try that next time. They're not as good as Sushi Fever. They do try to hard with the naming conventions. A lot of the names have raunchy undertones.  It's unnecessary. The service was excellent. Prices are decent."}
{"text":"Not very good sushi at all and over priced.
Chicken was extremely DRY
Seats were sticky with ponzu sauce or soda. Horrible super loud techno music. 
Bad experience all around."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi restaurants on the northwest side of town!

Only downside to this restaurant is that they don't offer all-you-can-eat. If they did im sure I would be here more often! 

Besides that, the restaurant is great. Service is usually good. They can get busy, especially on weekends. 

Husband and I have been ordering to go the last couple of times & even at home the sushi tastes just as good! Fresh & reasonably priced! 

Also, they have an app so be sure to download to your phone to make to-go ordering easier!"}
{"text":"Typically I would have a arsenal review lined up for a restaurant, either good or bad. this experience was just ok for me.

the sushi was real fresh, the waitress was very polite and on point, I just didn't feel it here. not sure, maybe I'm just so use to the all you can eat type sushi joints that I just can't justify spending $90 for the same stuff, and I leave hungry.

I had my usual tuna hand rolls on soy paper, some other dishes. no real issues other than price. when I realized I had only order a few things for myself and I think 2 rolls for wifey and I to share and I was at $90 or so, I said no more.

comparing it to sushi koma, which I love, I just have to go towards that place moving forward. lt boils down to price and I did not notice any quality difference between a all you can eat style sushi place and this a la carte sushi spot.

this spot is good if your up in this area for sure, but the pricing is \"loco\" for what your getting, only reason I'm dropping it a star. just not worth the price paid for the product your getting."}
{"text":"Only been here once, but the selection was great and the rolls were awesome! Not my fav. but defiantly great rolls. My husband had the sushimi and loved it.A bit over priced though."}
{"text":"Ok not to be a dick but go here ATLEAST once a week spend 50 or so everytime went with my family on a Sunday night ordered my usual we get now not to talk bad about the food but THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE NOW!!!! ordered about 6 rolls and found a 2 inch long hair in my roll then complained about it bill came out to be $130 now I was not expected a compt bill but HALF off ATLEAST being a regular who pays the bills at that place!!! Manager on duty said nothing can be done but just 1 roll?!?! I work at I high end place where multi mill people come in all the time and we ALWAYS show customer hospitality bill comes out to be 100 still. Will never go back will never have my business again and I'm not the type of person to ever right a review on a place it is what it is but with my family there and having them witness what happened and how we were treated as in cooks laughing in the back at us not happening again. Save your money save your appetite and dine somewhere else it ain't worth the headache!!!!"}
{"text":"Place is amazing! Bento box is must!  Can choose a little of everything. Katsu is delish,  so is the chicken and beef teriyaki. Miso soup.. don't get me started. Dessert is great. Go for the fried ice cream. Sushi is so good. Tried a few rolls none have disappointed so far I will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Service is great but the food is not. You can usually get seated fine even with the place being busy. Most of their menu items are basic items that you can't really mess up, things like fried rice and teriyaki chicken. If you try to venture into something specificaly Japanese, forget it, you'll be disappointed. Their sushi is good but it's not authentic, very Americanized but maybe that's your thing. Their portions are big so try to just get one item as most everything is overpriced for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place!! Always friendly with fast service and their 68 and I owe you roll never disappoints. Recently we had to order to go, and when I picked up my sushi, they had placed a bonus item that I loved! What an amazing gesture with great attention to detail (they know our name and orders now!) will definitely have to move from bi-monthly to weekly sushi!"}
{"text":"the summerlin location was on Dirty Dining. Explains why I got diarrhea the few times I ate there. Every time. Never eating at that location again."}
{"text":"Never was a really big fan of sushi until I was introduced to this place from my girlfriend. The first time I came here, I bought a \"Screaming Orgasm\" and it was delicious. The radish is nice and crisp, the tuna with the spicy mayo over it is a nice touch also. The service is decent, friendly staff, warm environment. The reason for the 3 stars is the last time I went I felt like I was on the verge of getting sick."}
{"text":"I'm going to go with a solid 'meh' on this one.

Judging from the lunch menu by the way.

Dipped in here to satisfy a curiosity of this place as i have been living in the area for over a year and still haven't tried it out. Between Sam's Club for pizza and hot-dogs for a cheap meal or be adventurous and try out the sushi joint for lunch this was chosen and here are the results:

Two options for the lunch special both ehhh under 12 bucks. One is set up bento box style the other being the sushi special which i assume you get rolls or something. Grabbed the box option. 

Salmon Teriyaki
Remember when Teriyaki ment a cooking technique where something is broiled and grilled with a glaze of soy sauce, marin, and sugar? Pepperidge Farms remembers...
Very bland and tasteless. Couldn't taste any of the grill flavor. Forget about the salmon flavor that's long gone after being popped freezer to freezer to freezer.

Why did i get salmon? Figured a restaurant that specializes in fish is able to pull off a tasty grilled fish entree. Same reason i would order a milk shake at an ice cream parlor. 

Tonkatsu
The best thing about this tonkatsu is the sauce which is most likely bottled. The breading failed to stay on the pork except for the end pieces. When i picked up a strip and dipped it into the sauce the breading broke off at the point where i was applying pressure with my chopsticks and fell into the sauce. The meat under was white the hair of the undead white walkers far beyond the wall...the north remembers...

The Rest
The rice was slightly too moist, the salad had too much dressing that was poured on top instead of evenly dispersed throughout and tasted too much of mayo, ginger and a touch of thousand island. Best thing in the box was the Gyoza which was perfectly crispy on the outside and flavorful and juicy on the inside.

The Bill
Need to spend 20 quid to use plastic...good thing i got a hand roll then!

Spicy Yellowtail Handroll
I LOVE spicy yellowtail hand rolls. To me they are a window into the fundamentals of the place. An instrument to measure amounts of fucks given if you will. Once i received a YT hand roll that was nothing more then thick chunks of yellow tail, cucumber slivers, sprouts, and a moderate amount of rice and was rolled so perfectly nothing dripped out of the bottom. What i received here came less than 5 minutes after i placed the order. The amount of rice and...yellow tail i guess was WAY off, too much of both. First bite revealed what my eyes were trying to tell me. The spicy yellow tail...spread was pre-made. No texture, no flavor, no spicy.

This dining experience honestly wasn't all that great and i knew this going in. Still went in just to afford the oportunity to be 'wow'ed'. It didn't happen. 

Now if you're reading this review trying to decide if you should go here for dinner or if you should go here at all i would like to thank you for reading this far and highly consider skipping mine and read another review. Here's why: There's two kinds of sushi places for two kinds of sushi eaters: The Rolls and The Raw. I am a raw eater. I love nothing more than to pay all you can eat prices and gouge on all the sea urchin, tuna, surf clam, and mackerel i can get my greedy paws on. This place is a Roll place...Is it a good roll place? I dont know, i dont eat rolls."}
{"text":"All their fish taste super fishy and smells pretty rotten which leads me to assume it's old. The staff is not friendly at all, the service really sucks. But hey if you like terrible food and bad service I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Sushi Loca a few years ago but haven't made it back recently until today. Everything started out good we got in got seated and received our drinks and had our orders taken fairly quickly.
       However, both food items that my mother and I received had HAIR in them. My sushi and her salad. They were clearly hair from two different people which made it that much more gross and as a worker in the food industry I understand the importance.
       Then on top of that, after we received our food our server did not come back to check it on this the entire time and never did refill our drinks. She only offered after she saw that we were clearly ready to go with our plates stacked and our credit card out. 
Normally I give them the benefit of the doubt but considering there were only two other tables in the restaurant I don't understand why she never came back. After both of these incidences I don't think I will be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Amazeballs
Sushi was super good quality and very fresh!!! Rolls were really big!! A little pricey but that comes with the location 
90 for 3 people and that was with two dishes of yummy mochi !!  super cute inside too"}
{"text":"I am officially loco for Sushi Loca! I've heard lots of good things about this place and every good thing I've heard I can agree to be true. The Resturant is super cool very big with super tall ceilings. Hip Japanese decor and very spacious. Besides the loud greeting from the whole crew when you walk in some of the staff are a bit ehh. Kind of like forced friendliness. But there was no problem and they did their job. 

So I have been on a mission to try fresh Uni for awhile and decided today's the day. I ordered a big order of assorted sashimi and boy they serve up some amazing sashimi here. The Uni was on that order. I have have always shy away from trying it because it look like it had a weird texture kind of like a younger but it didn't at all. I never thought that it would be so tender and so melt in your mouth but it was and I was hooked. The pieces were small but big enough to where I wasn't scared to try it. Thank you Sushi Loca for a great first time. 

The sashimi are very fresh and presented beautifully. The texture and the cuts of their fish was amazing. As for the specialty sushi rolls there was so many to choose from that I didn't k ow what to choose because they really all sound the same. The rice to sushi ratio was good and they flavors were on point. 

The chicken teriyaki dishes and sashimi salad was yummy as well and I loved their seaweed salad. Flavored well mixed perfectly and had a perfect crunchiness to it. 

I would definitely come back. Food is amazing!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome!!!!!   The service is great!!!!!!   We have taken friends and family to this restaurant and everybody is extremely pleased with their meal.   You can't find better sushi in this town.  Great extensive menu so if you don't like sushi, there are lots of other great Japanese foods to pick from."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi restaurant. I took my boyfriend who loves sushi and he was thrilled with the huge menu option they had available. They have classic and outrageous rolls. He tried 5 different ones and loved all of them. They rolls were all super fresh and kept coming. They were very filling, he even had to take the last one home."}
{"text":"I'll be the last to complain about a restaurant ... I'm giving one start based on how HORRIBLE the customer service is here. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I went here for my sis in laws bday,  it was decent sushi, I would go back.

The menus has weird names like \"who's your daddy, who's your mama, etc\" to give it some humor while waiting for the late commers.

I had the chicken yakisoba, it's a decent portion and the noodle was chewy which I like not over cooked.
The sushi, I ordered was double something.  I can't remember all the crazy names but it's suppose to be spicy tuna, spicy soft shell crab etc.  it was not spicy ( a little disappointed bc I like spicy food!) and I didn't like it to much."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent here. It's our lunch date spot. Get the jackpot. You won't be sorry. The names of the rolls are ridiculous. But their specialty rolls are huge. You'll need to unlock your jaw sometimes to get it in one bite. Service is great and quick. We prefer to sit in a booth but at the bar they chefs are friendly. They play edm. Bento boxes are good. Tempura comes out hot. This is not ayce! But it's quality"}
{"text":"Service has been exceptionally bad both times my husband and I have been. One time is bad luck, 2 times is bad management. We went on Saturday, and the dining area was empty. We waited a half and hour and then a tour bus came in, I ensured the sushi bar has out ticket. 15 minutes later, still no food, the server asked if it was good. We told her still no food. Already the tour bus costumers were reviving their food. We waited another 15 min and then it was no longer worth the wait. We paid for our drinks and left without eating.

There is a reason why the restaurant was empty (even on a weekend in a premier shopping district) and they are having to rely on tour bus traffic to support themselves. The service is not worth the food. We will not be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi joints. The service is meh but I'm there for the food and it's really good!"}
{"text":"Came in from California, the place was not crowed food was ok nothing to write home about, the service was poor! The food took along time to come and each persons meal was brought out in separate times!! Won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable price. Friendly server  and not too long of a wait after ordering. Nice ambiance, though I wasn't a huge fan of the music. We will be returning again."}
{"text":"Rolls, rolls, rolls.  Many rolls with unusual names and combinations.  We shared a Rainbow roll, a spicy yellowtail  roll and  Fat Ass roll. The latter covered in panko and deep fried.  All were fresh and very tasty.  They also have the usual  cooked Jspanese menu"}
{"text":"Service seems to be hit or miss here. Sometimes I get very attentive service, sometimes I feel like I'm being rushed out the door. I like the roll selection a lot. Nothing totally amazing but they taste very high quality. And the food does come out fast.
This last visit I tried something different and had the Chicken Katsu dinner. It was seriously a lot of food! For that reason, I would say that it's one of the better bang-for-your-buck choices you can have here. They have a pretty good alcohol selection as well. All things that go well with sushi. 
Overall I'd come back especially when I have guests. It's just that the hovering feeling gets on my nerves sometimes."}
{"text":"I've only eaten at Sushi Loca couple of times but I enjoyed my experience on both occasions. It's located in downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"I just had dinner here the other night and it was a really nice place. The atmosphere was fun and the waitresses all made sure we were taken care of. I really like the Choi's Favorite roll. So fresh and delicious. I will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and the food was ok and since this place is local I decided to try one more time just in case I missed something, but now I'm really turned off by this place. The quality is not good; wasabi and ginger plate I received was all dried up, the cucumber salad they served tasted like it was prepared a couple of days ago and to top it off, when the guy served us the cucumber salad he had one finger in the salad ( not cool ). I sat at the bar and asked the guy making sushi what he suggested to eat, he grabbed the menu from me to point something out then went back to making the sushi roll without washing his hands. MENUS CAN BE ONE OF THE FILTHIEST  THINGS IN A RESTAURANT. Another thing, the batter on the tempura shrimp looked and tasted old. After all that I ate my sushi rolls with some hesitation. There are other sushi places  that trump this place so  from now on I will drive further and even pay more to get better quality. 

Just gave them 2 stars:
1 star cause the people were nice and
1 star cause food did not make me sick."}
{"text":"Lasagna 2 omg i cant stop coming in for him. My families favorite place 2 eat sushi! Great service and ambiance!"}
{"text":"Great sushi spot !!! Cool atmosphere and quality product. Service was prompt and attentive."}
{"text":"Third time coming here with the kiddos and it was great.  The names of their rolls are hilarious, and the atmosphere is laid back and casual.  We were given the choice of the bar or a table for seating.  They took our drink order within 2 minutes of being seated.  While scanning the menu, they give you a sheet where you annotate your meal preferences.  All was great, we had no complaints and will return!"}
{"text":"It's honestly so so. For the price you pay you don't get much. 6.99 for 3 piece of not that good sashimi. Overprice for what you get. Not that good."}
{"text":"Do not waste your money! Service sucks and sushi is nothing special and overpriced. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great quality sushi.We had the fatty tuna here (Toro) and it was a bit pricey at MP $15 a serving, but it was well worth it. The rolls are exactly described and the service was very good. We were not expecting service and food this good north of the 215. We ordered the Ex Wife roll and that was very tasty and filling. Altogether it was $50-$65 including a couple of rolls, the order of Toro and a couple of handrolls. We are definitely going to come back if we are in the area."}
{"text":"This is definitely my fave sushi bar. This is place is POPPIN'. It has a great upbeat ambience, and I always receive great service here from the sushi men and waitresses alike. Let's take this review step by step. 

APPETIZERS: I always like to start off with the garlic edemame. It's a great way to start off your meal with a little miso soup. 

ENTREES: Their chicken habachi & seafood yakisoba has never disappointed! 

SASHIMI: Their sashimi has always been fresh for me. My favorites are definitely the halibut and yellow tail. You can never go wrong..

ROLLS: Let's get to the fun part! If you like a little spice & kick, I definitely recommend the Kiss of Fire. The jalapenos give this roll a great kick. Tastes like my ex-girlfriend has a great blend of tastes and textures that make it an overall great roll. The two are definitely my favorite! 

Definitely my regular sushi joint and worth the trip for a girl from the westside!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  You simply have to have sushi here! Make sure to try the special rolls. The service is super fast! Love it."}
{"text":"Great sushi place!  Fresh and fast. Delicious food."}
{"text":"When you go to a restaurant with a group of people, you expect to sit at a table. Right? So that way everyone can come and go as they please and the servers can serve the food to the patrons accordingly. Right? Well, according to the manager at good ol' Sushi Loca, a BOOTH for 7 people is \"more than enough room!\" And \"perfectly fine!\"...even AFTER we requested to sit at a regular table in a nearly empty restaurant. Not only was she persistent about it, but I found her tone to be extremely rude. Not to mention she made no eye contact and practically rolled her eyes while taking our order. I wish I could say that the food made up for the terrible service but it really didn't blow my mind. Don't think I'll be coming her again unless it's just for take out."}
{"text":"The sushi is good, the service is okay  and the prices are high but it's still the best sushi in the NW so I go back despite the mediocre service and high prices. They don't have much of a selection when it comes to adult beverages. Try the Neptune Dazzler, it's my favorite roll. Oh and if you get a screaming O, ask for lots of sauce, mine have been dry lately."}
{"text":"My cousin took us here.  He and his sister are regulars.  It was a good experience.  Great sushi rolls.  I loved my old favorite the japanese lasagna roll.  The wait staff are awesome.  There was a fun atmosphere.  I have to admit I was glad my mom wasn't with us because it was very loud and you know how she is!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times now it's very close to my home which is very convenient when I'm craving sushi. The rolls are really good. I like the fact that they have healthy rolls made out of cucumber and you can also get brown rice instead of white which is great for me. The service is not the best. There slow and not very friendly. Overall great food and amazing location!"}
{"text":"Our friends took us here for dinner. Great decor and ambience, they played club music very loud. The servers were dressed in kimonos. The kitchen greated us loudly as we walked in! A very welcoming feeling. Ordered the lychee saki cold.. It came out in a wine bottle. It was soo good chilled!! Took notes to purchase additional for the house (: 

Order beef yokisoba(?) noodles, teriyaki beef, no pain no gain rolls, garake(?) chicken and I think it may have been the one night stand(?) rolls. Everything was delicious and the portions were very generous for a sushi house. I would not order the garake(?) chicekn again though. It was dried fried chicken over a bed of shreded cabbage -was not very enticing. 

Great restaurant, atmostphere, service, food!! 5 stars is a mos def. Their late hours are great! Hard to find something that opens that late w/ great food off the strip. Will be taking family and friends back (:"}
{"text":"Great sushi!  Great prices!  One of our favorites.  Try the triple X, taste like my Ex Girfriend or stick to the basics!"}
{"text":"Honestly the service was so bad it wasn't worth the drive.

Came her with a few people for a birthday dinner and not only did they give us things we didn't order, they didn't give us the things we DID order either. No refills on water. Didn't give us any plates even when we asked multiple times.

Towards the end, someone would come by every five minutes and ask what we needed. The rest of our orders that we've repeated almost 5 times now? 

So we asked to cancel the rest and just give us the check. Then they came back AGAIN and asked what we were waiting for. Seriously. Just the check and to cancel the rest of our orders. Please for the love of God.

So the waitress just stares at me like shes confused. 

Aw cripes.

Finally the check comes. And guess what. The stuff we never got is still on the check. 

When all is said and done, the sushi is fine. Not ala carte good, but it was good. Maybe I'll try their other location. Because this place needs to get it together."}
{"text":"It was ok. Nothing special. Very slow serice.
Even though the place was emply, no one came in to take our order until after what seemed  as a half an hour, I started waiving my hands up in the air"}
{"text":"Yes, I know there is fish at a sushi restaurant, but when they offer a vegetarian option, I'm expecting it to be vegetarian. 

I let the waitress know that I have a fish allergy and asked if it would be possible for the chef to clean his knife to make my cucumber, avocado and asparagus roll. The waitress said the chef would be able to do so. 

While eating my food, I noticed some small, orange balls on my sushi. My boyfriend and I did not know what they were. We called the waitress over and asked her if she knew what they might be. She replied, \"fish eggs\". I let her know that I could not eat that as I had a fish allergy. She said, \"not shell fish\". I replied, \"I have a fish allergy, not just shell fish! I don't eat fish!\" She asked if I wanted the chef to make me another roll. I let her know that I didn't trust the chef and could not be certain if he could make me a roll without fish eggs on it. Especially since I had already mentioned before ordering that I have an allergy. 

I refused to eat anything else and therefore, I am now the first person to review this abominable restaurant! 
This is Las Vegas, food capital of the nation! Exceptions and dietary concerns should be considered in this well advanced year of 2015. I have every right as anyone else to request a simple customization to meet my dietary needs so our entire party can enjoy themselves. This establishment almost made me seriously ill! Beware!"}
{"text":"While I may not be a professional food critic, I do fancy myself as a true fat kid. I live to eat. That being said, sushi is one of my favorite foods to eat and Sushi Loca does not meet my standard of amazing sushi. It's fine. Not great but not bad either. Sadly, I have had worst. Nothing memorable. If the sushi was an AYCE type of sushi restaurant, then I would say it's decent. For an a la carte restaurant, it is a bit subpar. 
The service is good. Very nice wait staff. Attentive. For me, no amount of good service can overshadow the \"meh\" food.
Not the best. Not the worst. Why not give it a try if you are in the area? Just don't go out of your way to come here. I did hear their other location was better but I still have yet to try it."}
{"text":"I stopped in to get a couple of rolls to go. They were both warm, which was unpleasant.  One of the rolls had something fried in the middle that tasted spoiled.  It was inedible. When I got home I offered the pieces to my dog. I'm not trying to be obnoxious or say something untrue, but my dog dropped each piece on the ground and attempted to roll around on them. When a dog won't eat a piece of sushi, there is a problem with the sushi. The entire roll went into the trash."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice and it was excellent both times.  The whole experience was amazing, from start to finish.  The restaurant is warm, spacious with stylish decor.  Not your typical \"hole-in-the-wall\" sushi place  (although I have nothing against those either!). You are greeted right away by really friendly staff.  

No AYCE which is a little disappointing but I feel like the quality and taste makes up for it.  It is a little pricier than most but again, you're paying for premium freshness and flavor. 

We ordered two rolls: the Caterpillar roll and Neutral Viagra roll.  I've also had the yellowtail sashimi.  The quality of ingredients really stand out here.  Every bite evokes a \"mmmmmm\" response.  If you're looking for an elevated sushi / Japanese restaurant without emptying out your bank account, this place is perfect.  Will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"The best service and greatest people very good sushi. My whole family loves the nobu special I really recommend this role."}
{"text":"Been craving sushi for weeks! Usually end up at Sushi Bomb, but really wanted to try Sushi Loca! Heard some good reviews on here. Finally made it in.

Pull up to the parking lot... Sh*t are they closed?!? There's no cars! But the open sign was on. Oh yeah it's 3:30p on a Wednesday, ok. So since it's slow maybe they should do happy hour to bring business! No happy hour :(

Their prices were kinda high. It might be because I usually only go sushi during happy hour. 3 rolls and a dessert for about $50. (could've done 2 AYCE sushi lunches!.. or dinners at Island Sushi...)

Quality was okay. The salmon on the Sex on the Beach was pretty fresh. The seaweed seemed different from other places, dunno good or bad, but chewy.

Also got the cucumber island roll. No rice! The sauce it came with was weird though. and wasn't anything special. And also had the I Did Your Girlfriend roll. It was pretty loaded and good sauce. Tastes like there's horseradish in the sauce though, which was not mentioned in the description and the bf hates that taste. So had to eat the whole roll myself. I don't like that idea. I like variety. Too much of one thing no good.

Then dessert! I overheard another table order Tempura + Cheesecake. Yup. Delish!! Comes with blueberry preserve and chocolate sauce. Odd, but totally worked.

I'd actually rate 3 1/2 stars. Service was average. Pricing seems high for such average food though. There's other places I'd rather go. Photos are posted though. I think I did good with the pictures :)"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I were both craving sushi today so after going to Home Depot we stopped into sushi loca. Very chill and peaceful atmosphere. The service was quick and kind and the food was delicious and fresh !"}
{"text":"Ricky.. my sushi boyfriend..was not here.  But it was still amazing.  Oyster shooter continues to be the most addicting crack and husband and I NEED it.."}
{"text":"Fantastic Sushi, friendly service . They were busy and we still got seated right away . Would definitely recommend the Heart Attack roll.. So good"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming during the afternoon and the service was horrible!  My boyfriend and I were the only people in the restaurant, yet we struggled to get any help. My boyfriend spent over 10 minutes trying to get our waitress's attention, so we could order more rolls (she was just standing, talking to a coworker). When she finally came over we just asked for the check and left because we were so irritated.

2 stars only because the rolls are really good."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband -- I was having a sushi craving. The waitress was able to help me find rolls that were pregnancy friendly (low mercury fish-cooked.) I ordered the vegetable roll and California roll. They don't use a lot of rice so your roll is all veggie/crab goodness. While this isn't my normal sushi order (I love ahi-tuna however that is not preggers friendly) I was very happy with the taste. My husband had the chicken teriyaki plate and some chicken katsu. He raved about how great it tasted. I believe the prices are reasonable. They have a debit card minimum of 10 dollars (so heads up!)
Watch out for the soy sauce dishes-the ones at our table were dirty. I had to ask for new ones (all three were gross!)"}
{"text":"Great variety of rolls. Fish is fresh. Have a really large menu besides sushi. Only downside, pretty pricey with no all you can eat option."}
{"text":"I heard this place is Korean owned not Japanese, and it showed, I had a tonkatsu dinner set (the worst I've ever seen), friend had a chicken and had no taste at all.  The attitude of the server was just terrible. Never going back."}
{"text":"I'll never understand why people working in the service industry would be rude and unwelcoming to paying customers. Your restaurant is empty, you have what seems to be an abundantly staffed crew, and everyone in our party was polite. Please do me a favor and DO NOT rush my order and then take forever to bring it. Don't disappear for a half hour with my check when I asked you nicely to cash me out because I have to get to work on time. And don't try to take the orders of 8 people without writing things down because it's just not efficient when you have to keep coming back and asking what we all had. 

Oh. And there's an automatic 18% gratuity for 8 people or more. Which is fine if the service is better, but on this occasion it wasn't. 

Food is really expensive for what you get, and food quality is lacking overall. Service here, as you can tell, leaves much to be desired. Everyone tells me that the Sushi Loca on Centennial is MUCH better, so I'd be willing to give that location a shot. This one, however, is never getting my business again."}
{"text":"Shrimp killa  is the best one supper fast and ice cold beer service is always awesome and a fair price"}
{"text":"Meh. I'm always skeptical of sushi places I don't normally go to so I guess I didn't give them a fair chance today. I ordered garlic tuna and salmon nigiri and a roll that had mozzarella cheese melted on it. I know cheese and fish is a big no no but I've been duped by odd flavors before and loved then so I gave it a try. Not good. Nigiri was sliced so damn thick, I had to take two bites and it was not fresh tasting to me which instantly turned me off. Rice had no flavor but the sauces were good. I tried mochi for desert and they both had a fishy taste to them. Done."}
{"text":"Yep, you're in Vegas and have craving for sushi.  This is the place.  Alone or with friends, Sushi Loca is your place.  No casino.  Quiet.  Good service.  Great cocktails."}
{"text":"Sigh.. This restaurant may be the very reason why I never eat shrimp at a restaurant again. 

I went for sushi with of a couple of girlfriends last night. I'm not brave enough to eat raw fish, so I usually go for shrimp tempura. I order the appetizer, which came with 4 pieces of shrimp and mixed veggies. The food came fast and was hot. After biting into my second piece of shrimp, a long vein (poop) fell out of the shrimp remaining in my hand. I have never been so disgusted! I cut into the remaining two pieces, and poop was in abundance. At this point, I'm finding it difficult to not puke on the bar. I ate poop! We notified the waitress, and she revealed that the shrimp came already prepared. $10 for frozen shrimp tempura is pretty expensive. She took away my plate with three of my four pieces of shrimp, and offered free ice cream. We passed.. It was cold and rainy outside. My check came, and I was charged for the meal. I was kind of shocked! 

I called the next day to speak to a manager, and a lady named \"G\" reluctantly offered to give me my money back. She never apologized, but seemed upset that I less than thrilled about being served dirty shrimp. 

I would never dine here again.. Tragic experience!"}
{"text":"Not the quality of food or service we expected. The place was half full and was struggling. Waited 6 weeks to try, maybe better in the future??????????"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch try try their lunch specials. We got two of the lunch boxes. I got the beef teryaki and the chicken karage and it came with rice, salad, miso soup and gyoza.  They're decently priced and came with a good amount of food. Food was good, not the best I've ever had, but I'd go back. We also tried one of their sushi rolls and it was good, but nothing special. Didn't have to wait too long to get our food, but mine came out way before my friend's."}
{"text":"My husband and i went to this place last sunday early pm.. The food is quick and good, however the service sucks.  The server after taking our order took all the  menu without asking if we want to keep one in case we want to order some more. And then, this asian lady in a jogging pants and a baseball cap, gave us our food without even looking at us and instead looked at the other table. She like shoved our food to us. Haha. Not american customer service.  

There are other good no ayce place with great food and way better customer service than this.. 

And a server in a sweatpants and a baseball cap? Strange..."}
{"text":"Absolutely best sushi in town. My husband and I have visited many places in town for sushi and we havent found any place that even comes close. 

The menu has such a wide variety that you can sit there all night and order roll after roll! 

The staff at the sushi bar are always hilarious so I highly suggest sitting at the sushi bar. 

We went to Maui, Hawaii on our honeymoon and asked everyone in town where the best sushi was. We expected it to top any sushi we have ever had and we left wishing we just had sushi at Sushi Loca! 

The atmosphere is alot of fun. It makes our date nights great. 

The pricing is reasonable but it is worth the variety or rolls and sake."}
{"text":"This is my favorite ambience for a sushi restaurant! The sushi is great and they have some excellent specialty rolls.  Last night the salmon and tuna sashimi were fresh and incredible as usual!"}
{"text":"I have loved sushi loca since I have moved to Las Vegas 2 years ago. But today, I sat down promptly , got my order in, and waited 50 minutes for my Jimmy Special sushi roll! I actually didn't see my waitress after I ordered.  I had to stop a busboy for forks for my Ramen! I had to stop someone else for sauces. I finally sent a smoke signal and asked the nearest server for my waitress.  Horrible service! Definitely finding a new lunch and sushi spot!
The music is great though!"}
{"text":"This was a hidden gem inside one of the many mini mall plazas near my folk's house I always wanted to try and might I say what a pleasant surprise it was. First off, you're greeted by the sushi chefs when you walk through and seated promptly. From there on, you get to see the many variations of rolls with creative titles accompanying the dish. Me and my family got three entrees and three rolls which were all fairly priced with the quality matching. That and a very attentive waitress plus great looking ambience makes this a stand out from the rest in Las Vegas. I for sure will be making many trips here when I move out here. Great job n keep it up!"}
{"text":"we really like this place!  I've never been a big sushi fan but the food here is great!"}
{"text":"So excited to be here with family and looking forward to some delicious sushi.  The restaurant is beautiful and the staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Recently came here for dinner with my girlfriend. I had high expectations for this place in terms of food and sushi rolls. We were heavily let down.


The sashimi here - great. Nice big cuts and pretty good quality.

The Steak Hamachi dinner here is awesome! My favorite dish by far!

Let's get down to the sushi rolls here - the reason we came. They are just ok.  They have the potential to be great - but they miss. Most of the rolls are heavily-laden with sauce which drowns out much of the taste and flavor. The rolls are deceivingly big. The rolls are stuffed with tons of  spicy \"crab\" and their \"soft-shell crab\". Making for just a filler and topper of the rolls. 

All of these rolls seem to be badly poor knock-offs of rolls found at 'I Love Sushi'. The names on the rolls are different  - and so is the quality and the amount of real fish you are actually getting. 

Rolls we ate:
TTL- Favorite of all the rolls
Final Fantasy 2 - Second favorite 
Put your hands up 
Jackpot 
Taste like my ex gf
I did your gf
No Pain No Gain - least favorite - way too much sauce all drenched over it.

If you don't believe me - I implore you to go eat at 'I Love Sushi' to taste the difference.

If I lived on this end of town - this wouldn't be a terrible go-to. But knowing that other sushi places out there trump this place; for that I can only give this place three stars."}
{"text":"So far the best none all you can eat sushi in vegas!!! The rolls are huge the service is great defently coming back!!"}
{"text":"The servers walk around like lost puppies.

I don't understand the need for sexually explicit names for items on the menus or the attire. The decor of this restaurant is so upscale, but the uniforms of the staff is like a beer barn or something.

The sushi was okay, I've had better.

We won't be back."}
{"text":"Eel sauce is a little too sweet for my taste but they have funny specialty rolls and pretty decent quality. The sorbets are good too"}
{"text":"Sadly, the only impressive dish we had today at lunch was the edamame, and frankly, that's a stretch. Either serve it cold or warm, not somewhere in between. 

Our appetizers came out in an odd, piecemeal fashion - sauce with no tempura veggies, appetizers after the meal had been served. 

We were told the lunch special is not available on the weekend, which is fine. As long as you state that one the website. Check it out - there's no restriction listed, just a time frame. 

When we finally received the entrees, they all came out minutes apart, and did not impress. The katsus, both chicken and pork, were dry and nearly inedible without the sauce. Surprisingly, the katsu sauce was deliciously tangy and sweet. The yakisoba was horribly over done. For a dish that warns the meat could be potentially undercooked, it was a bit ironic to be served something more like hockey puck than bovine. 

I can understand every restaurant has an off day, but to have the horrible service (getting sneered at for spilling a few drops of soy sauce, and the fact that I've been waiting 20 min now to get the check) that accompanied this lackluster meal, has made a long-time fan into a customer who probably won't return."}
{"text":"Always here. Their sushi is so great, and thy have other options as well for people who don't like sushi! Sometimes service isn't always the best, but overall, it's a good spot!"}
{"text":"I dream about the rolly rice bowl
Here!!! Great sushi, best in Vegas!!! The price is good too and they have sushi rolls that I don't find many places."}
{"text":"Double trouble and 68 are great. Great service and the rolls are big. The music was great and the decorations are cute. Will be going back in the future."}
{"text":"ordered salmon skin roll and spicy tuna roll for take out.  not the best sushi place in Las Vegas and north Las Vegas at that.  I wouldn't even consider this place if i was desperate for sushi.  I don't know why this place has 4 stars.  

not only is the sushi crap but the staff isnt that friendly.  the hostess who took my order was extremely rude.  

I wouldn't suggest this place to anyone.  this place sucks.  plain and simple.  whole foods has better sushi than this place."}
{"text":"I have been here several times now,and the only time I have been disappointed was when I ordered take out. Other than that time I have always gotten good, and consistently fresh fish. You are welcomed by every staff member as soon as you walk into the restaurant. What I really enjoy is how fast our service was. As soon as we sat down we were brought a nice and refreshing cucumber salad. It was small and a great start. If there was one thing that turns me off with this sushi restaurant is the noise. It was and always is LOUD. The music is played way to loud,so everyone has to talk loud to be heard. I had the heart attack roll and it tasted really good,but would fall apart every time I picked it up. Minor inconvenience. Overall I still believe this is the best sushi restaurant in the northwest."}
{"text":"A new beautiful place in downtown Summerlin. First time here and food is very good. A little pricey but worth the money. Service is excellent.
We will go back in the near future"}
{"text":"My friends and I have been coming here for years. Their customer service and portions have gone down and their prices have gone up. It took out waitress at least 20 minutes before she took our order and another 30-40 minutes to get our check after we were finished eating. Our bill was then messed up and we had to wait another 30 minutes, at least, in order for our waitress to correct it and then another 15 minutes for our change. We will not be dining here anymore and I don't recommend this to anyone. I work in a restaurant and this is the worst service I have ever experienced. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been countless times!! My absolute favorite sushi!!  Everytime I eat here it's soooo delicious!! Great food. Great chefs. Music is awesome. Clean friendly fun entertaining. All the sushi chefs are amazing funny. I've never had anything I wouldn't eat ten times over or more!!  If it's out of your way it's so worth the drive!! Best sushi in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if sushi could be worse. From the wait staff who spend more time talking to each other, to the sushi chef's t-shirt slogans, \"I did your x-girlfriend\", to the overly sauced, incredibly underwhelming food, I'm not sure I could think of a faster way to go out of business. Do you have a clue how to run a restaurant in a suburban community with a plethora of competition?"}
{"text":"Really fun place right in the heart of downtown Summerlin great staff and the owners a lot of fun too she comes out and greets everybody personally"}
{"text":"This place is very overpriced for the quality and the service, I don't think they have ever gotten our order right, very forgetful waitresses."}
{"text":"We come here quite a bit because it is always quality sushi and good service. We came for a very early dinner and were quickly seated. We ordered 4 rolls and a soup and the final bill with tip was $53, so it's a little pricey. My biggest complaint is they have no all you can eat. Rolls average about $7 for a basic roll and around $11-12 for a regular roll. Booths are nice and big to fit at least 6."}
{"text":"So incredibly yummy!! Their sushi is the bomb. Try the heart attack or the I did your ex girlfriend. They give big portions on the seaweed salad"}
{"text":"This place used to be great! Always packed. The sushi is still good. But yet the staff is really unattentive. We had to flag down a waitress to get service. . They served our Sushi and yet we still had no plates. They didn't pay attention to us and yet the two waitresses behind the counter was sitting on their phones. When we did asked questions we felt as if we were bothering the waitresses. The prices are high compared to other  sushi /all-you-can-eat places such as umiya. Spent $50 just on two sushis and an appetizer and two drinks. I am also a server and I know I would not do that to my customers if I wanted to make a tip. I suggest they go thru customer service training. Other than that but Sushi is good and the decor is nice."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try after my sister had recommended it to me. 
Had the salmon skin hand roll. That was the only thing that was good! 5/5 stars for that! 
Uni sushi- I asked the waitress if it was fresh and when did they get their shipment. She lied to me and got her days twisted. Uni came out brown. And they charged me $11.95 for a week old uni. 
My boyfriend and I had also ordered a few rolls... 
First roll: Nobu special- 2/5 stars. The fish was dry the sushi was dry and the taste was bland. 
2nd roll: eel roll: 4/5 stars: nothing special. Just your typically traditional eel roll. It was just ok. They were shy on the eel and there was a lot rice. The boyfriend likes Eel rolls so we ordered that.
3rd roll: Burning sensation- 1/5 stars. This roll had bad news written all over it! The roll that was suppose to contained shrimp tempura and soft shell crab inside and SSC outside topped w/ tuna and avocado. The menu did not describe how the soft shell crab was prepared in a this roll. So I assumed the SSC was deep fried and rolled into the roll (kinda like the spider roll). But instead it came with some weird tasting minced SSC mixture. So when the roll came out my boyfriend and I both ate a piece and we both made a  face! The SSC mixture tasted awful! A taste that I cannot even discribe! I've had SSC rolls at a lot of places and it does not taste anything like that! Long story short! I had to talk to 2 waitresses(which 1 didn't speak English and another that had a major attitude and got in my face and told me \"it's my fault for ordering this rolls unknowingly not knowing how they prepare their Soft shell crab) and 1 boss to get them to finally exchange this roll to something else! So we finally changed the order to just the traditional Spider roll just to be on the safe side and fill our tummies!
Let's just say this is my FIRST AND LAST TIME AT THIS PLACE AND I WILL NOT AND DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT TO ANYONE!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for about 8 years and I have never been disappointed. In fact, this is probably the only place that has NEVER disappointed me when it comes to the food and environment. It's comfortable and cozy and the food has always been very fresh and very tasty. I especially like the small cucumber salad they bring you as an appetizer. The reason for the five stars though is because in the past eight years I can only think of one time that the staff left a lasting impression on me...my ex BF and I walked in and felt so welcomed by the staff at the bar that it was probably THE reason why I've continued going back all these years. This past time I went in there really was none of that...no welcome or friendly small talk before our order was taken or goodbye as we left. Don't get me wrong...I will be back...but the customer service should be a bit more welcoming :)"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  When you walk in the sushi chefs start yelling something at you ... I've been there many times and can never figure out what the hell they are saying.  I'm assuming it's a cultural thing that the white man doesn't understand.  The rolls are phenomenal but you have to try the screaming orgasm.  It's rightfully named so make sure your wear protection, it's messy.  

Very fun environment at the sushi bar as well.  The sushi chefs are a riot and can drink you under the table.  In fact they'll do sake bombs with you all night.

One of the better sushi places in Vegas for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I have been here several times but haven't written a review. Prices are great, menu selection is phenomenal, and the atmosphere keeps you entertained. This place does get pretty loud with the music, but it does not become a nuisance. This place is perfect for groups, families, or couples. 

However, I don't suggest the take-out. Very different quality compared to dining-in."}
{"text":"The Sushi was okay. Nothing super special. Customer Service wasn't that good, I'm so tired of dealing with racist businesses. And I don't feel they treated my party like everyone else. The food took forever and they said goodbye loud and nicely to everyone but my party, people of color. This is a diverse neighborhood and racism should not be tolerated."}
{"text":"Come here all the time. Favorite sushi spot. My mom isn't a sushi lover like me so she always get chicken Katsu or karage.  Today we got the lunch box with boy for her. The Katsu was delicious. Karage was real chewy..like rubbery...and the chicken didn't taste too good, almost like it wasn't fully cooked. We told our waitress towards the end of our meal (which we still had the full position of karage still on her plate).  The waitress said sorry there's nothing we can do. Didn't apologize, didn't offer to replace...well actually she said if I told her earlier she would taken it back and re-cooked it.  That doesn't sound appetizing to me!!! Disappointed. Btw I always get screaming o and ttl.  Today I got ttl and xxx. Neither disappointed..both were yummy!!!!  I'm disappointed in how they handled our lunch box though.  Oh!! Also, I got hot tea and asked for refill..I inadvertently removed the tea bag prior (it's a habit, I don't like my tea too strong so I always remove after a while)...she took my cup and brought me back hot water! No tea bag!  When I asked for one she seem annoyed!  Hope they do better next time...would be sad to have to go to my 2nd fave sushi spot instead"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had. If you care about sushi quality, definitely give this place a try. Not sure why they're only rated 3 stars, it should at least be 4-5 stars. There's never a wait, very roomy, served quickly. If you're a sushi lover do yourself a favor and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing considering that this was a recommended sushi joint. Food was mediocre, but more importantly the presentation was horrible. The fish was just hacked into pieces, the rolls were super sloppy and falling apart, and the soy sauce tasted weird. We actually left after we got one roll and some nigiri because it was so poorly served. 

Service was okay, but I definitely wouldn't return. The rolls didn't sound appetizing (too much going on with them) and the lack of care with the fish was more than I could stand. 

Summerlin is still in need of a good sushi joint!"}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food! The fish was fresh and sizzled in my taste buds. \"I did your girlfriend\" was my fave super savory and mesmerizing."}
{"text":"Visited Sushi Loca for the first time last evening. The menu was impressive with a lot of choices. This restaurants staff is not welcoming or upbeat in any way. I first sat at the sushi bar for about ten minutes before anyone even spoke to me or greeted.  The sever brought me water after many minutes with a menu and I sat for at least another ten minutes and thought about leaving. I finally walked a few steps over to the sushi chef and ordered the Spicy scallops and a cucumber roll.  The spicy scallop roll was bland, but the fish was good. The cucumber roll was very good.  No one ever checked back with me once. I had to take out my credit card to get attention to get a to go box and pay.  There are many other sushi bars to visit, so I wouldn't go out of my way again."}
{"text":"Everything was just ok. The food was just ok. The service was just ok. The ambience was just ok. It appears from outside to look like a fast food place. It's actually pretty nice inside. That said, it's nothing special."}
{"text":"Service and Food is great. New location and the atmosphere is great for Downtown Summerlin"}
{"text":"Sat at the sushi bar. Everything was delicious try the Banzai roll. Even their gyoza seemed better than most!"}
{"text":"Sometimes, bigger isn't always better. Quality over quantity.

I was disappointed since this was so hyped up by a few friends of mine. We came here for dinner on a Friday night. Place was pretty busy, but we only had to wait about 5 minutes....despite my friend calling in for a reservation ahead of time but that fell through. They never even had a reservation for us to begin with.

Service was kinda spotty...and weird at times. Our waitress would rush us to order and at the end, she kept on checking back on us because we took awhile to pay the bill since we were chatting and catching up with one another. You may be thinking oh she's just seeing if we may want to order dessert but no...her body language and behavior said otherwise.

My friend ordered his usual like Japanese Garlic Lasagna, Heart Attack and Burning Sensation. I ordered a spicy tuna roll and Jackpot. The rolls did not look too appealing. It was too big causing all the contents to fall apart plus there's just too much going on. Sometimes, keeping it petite and simple may be the best way to go about it. Not to mention, each roll is about $12-$16. Too expensive and it wasn't even that good. And....am I the only one who had stomach problems after eating this?? Not to get too graphic but I was in the bathroom all next morning....ughhh....not coming back. 
I came, I tried, I'm done."}
{"text":"Not many times have I used words like perfect ,amazing, or Orgasmic ! 
Nor have I left a restaurant filled to the gills planning on what I will have to eat next time I visit. 
starting with the service prompt ,courteous and extremely friendly.  now the hours ..awesomely convenient for your late night craving after eating here the first time your addicted  lol  open 7 days a week 11a.m. till 2 a.m. ...... prices.. Perfectly priced so that I can afford it twice a week !
 now for the food ...extremely fresh , phenomenal  with a  creative extensive menu 
This is Bagofdonuts without hesitation is my #1 sushi destination recommendation
OH and the fried cheese cake Orgasmic !"}
{"text":"I order to go very often from here. They phone staff is very polite and accurately take my order. I haven't had to bring anything back for being incorrect. 

I usually order the philly roll. Salmon roll. Tempura classic. With extra spicy mayo. 

Very delicious"}
{"text":"This place USED to be the best spot for sushi but the last few times I've come it's been horrible. The rolls are smaller and the prices have gone up, the quality of the food isn't as good anymore either. I came here last night with my family and no one was offered refills on their drinks, we arrived after the Saturday rush so there was no excuse that they were too busy. We also ordered a roll that had a cheese spread on top that was lit on fire to melt it. It tasted like pure chemicals I nearly threw up, when I asked our waiter if we could get something different he said he didn't understand and asked if we had this specific role before, not that it mattered if we did or not it taste like chemicals. We waited for our food forever as well. The service has gotten so poor here! Who ever manages or owns this location should be ashamed of how run down this place has gotten. I will no longer recommend sushi loca to anyone I know. Not to mention the demerits they received from the health district as well!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. One of the best sushi places I've ever been. We got the banzai and Alaska and they were absolutely delicious. We will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Not as good as sushi ko, which is in the same general area (Centennial-ish) and same price point.

However, their tuna and salmon rolls are good.  I don't like a lot of their special rolls because they have \"crab\" in them, which of course is not real crab but its shady alternative.  Their cucumber salad is also pretty good."}
{"text":"Well, this is my favorite neighborhood sushi joint. First I should warn you old folk about it. The place is pretty loud and they have club music bumping. I like it and wouldn't want them to change.

Food is really good too. The best are the crispy rice with spicy tuna.  My wife and I agree that it would be our final meal if on death row. They have a bunch of crazy rolls with names they use for shock value. I eat the nigiri and their sashimi salad is really good too. If you have non sushi eaters, the need to order the chicken karage. It is a fried chicken dish, but they marinade the chicken bites before battering and frying them. They are very good! I usually order the \"Hibachi Sauce\" with them since that is what the waiter called it one night. Half of the time they bring the wrong one so I don't know what it is called I guess. 

This is where I found Hamachi Kama (Yellowtail Collar) with ponzu. They had salmon kama on sale one night and a guy next to us got it. I asked what it was and ordered one since they were like $3 that night. It was soooo good. The next time I tried ordering it again and they told me to try the yellowtail one. The yellowtail one kills the salmon one.

Service is really good there. The staff are prompt, and you never have to look for someone to help you. I usually don't experience good service at sushi restaurants and this one is the best by far."}
{"text":"This place was REALLY good. The fish was very Fresh and the sushi chef is very nice! This is going to be my sushi restaurant from now on! Great job! I would have taken pics of the food, but we ate it way too fast! Then for dessert you need to try the Tempura Cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi, but VASTLY overpriced. Our lunch was $105 and not close to worth it. If this was half the price, I would be back. Not now. If someone else is paying the bill, there are better places to eat. No complaints, but no praise."}
{"text":"Best sushi place ever! only place in vegas that i know of that will do brown rice on their rolls! much healthier alternative!"}
{"text":"I had heard so many good things about sushi loca that when my family said they want it to try sushi I suggested Sushi Loca. BAD idea! So we had 7 to our party 2 bills well they try cramming all of us to a small table at the time we asked if we could get 2 tables. Per waitress  NO because it's a busy day we need the table for other customer.... The restaurant never during our stAy was it full so I don't see what the problem was. During dinner we asked for water 2 times NADA!! The food was good not delicious just good. Time for the bill we get charged for our dinner and tip is automatically added. I don't ever mind paying for a tip but when a tip is automatically applied and t he service isn't 5 stars??? We both got charger a total of $40 combine. No need to say this will be my last time here."}
{"text":"This is the place I go to whenever I have a late night craving for some rolls. I usually go to an AYCE location since the price is more efficient and effective, but the rolls here are absolutely delicious and filling. 

I got the kiss of fire last time I was here, and my god, the food is totally kicking. The one roll filled me up and I was sweating from how spicy it was. I love it! Unfortunately my lower end also got a kiss of fire later that night, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"The search is still on for a really great, over the top sushi restaurant. 
Service is fine here, staff are fairly attentive. I dined in with a group of (5) and neither of us, truly enjoyed our meal items. I have to say that I do not expect too much, but when I am hosting friends in town, its pretty embarrassing. 

Ramen tasted very similar to instant ramen, chicken karage was obviously fried in over used oil, and needed more seasoning (there was no salt and pepper shakers on the table). We probably needed to try the sushi to see what the rants were really about. This is probably why we were only provided with one full menu and (5) sushi menus. 

First time here and probably my last. 

Good Luck Sushi Loca."}
{"text":"This place was terrible ?the waitress was so mean and rude ? here is Summerlin ? high end location and  not all you can eat ? something wrong with the management ?did they trained the waitress before they put them out there ? they represented this place . I had a night mare experience ? the most fattest waitress she was so mean and rude to us and l swear to God if she still worked there i never go back ?worst ever ?"}
{"text":"Wow!  One of the best sushi places in las vegas.

Trendy decor, house music. Great place to take a date.

I love a lot of the newer rolls with jalapeno, cream cheese, baked mayo etc..... and this place does them really well along with traditional cut rolls.  

Their japanese dinners, with steak and chicken katsu are great as well."}
{"text":"Not bad! I had a tuna roll with their miso soup and seaweed salad and have no complaints. Everything tasted fresh and good! The waiting staff was attentive as well. I just wish their sashimi was a better price. Their tempura ice cream was super delicious too! It's a HUGE serving - could honestly be split between two people. I will be going back and next time.. I will take advantage of their All You Can Eat option :)"}
{"text":"One of the better places I've been to for sushi in Vegas. LOVE the lettuce wrap hand roll. Also loved the roll \"Tastes like your Girlfriend.\" Decent service. Large bar area with plenty of table seating."}
{"text":"The best place in town for a One Night Stand or a XXX! You'll understand once you've seen the menu, but don't be put off by the names; it makes ordering so much fun!

We were pleasantly surprised that the service was super fast, friendly and efficient even on a Saturday at 6 pm. The One Night Stand is much more fulfilling than its namesake, and the Ryan's Special complimented it nicely with beautiful fresh tuna and asparagus. The Eel Roll is simple and scrumptious, and the Soft Shell Crab Roll made for a nice finish.

5's! Check it out!"}
{"text":"I have to say wow. I was surprised how much I liked this place. The service was on point. The ladies who were taking care of us were on top of things. Great service.
The menu was easy to follow too which I liked.
The sushi was delicious.  I'm a very picky eater and I enjoyed everything I got. The fish was fresh and not fishy. I will say though, don't order more than two rolls for your self because these rolls are big! List of things we had: final fantasy 2, heart attack, my ex wife, and spider roll.

I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Las Vegas. What can I say that hasn't already been said? Nothing it has definitly earned it's great reputation.o"}
{"text":"The best place to get the \"Americanized\" sushi rolls. They have a lot of cream cheese, spicy ponzu sauces, and delicious screaming orgasm. The names on their menu is humorous, and I remember having my 21st birthday here. They served my party of 24 very well without any problems in splitting the bill. The waiters are very helpful!

Their nigiri is sub-par and their soft shell crab is disappointing. Also the no AYCE hurts this place as well because I love nigiri and it always costs a lot to fill me up when I eat it!"}
{"text":"Decent service, cute place...fishy fish! We ordered 4 rolls and some sashimi and our bill was $100! Not a big deal if the food is good. We have been here before...we won't be back. Our stomachs upset after dining here."}
{"text":"This is seriously the best place to get some good. A+ service and even better sushi. It has a great atmosphere for groups and the young adult crowd. 
The staff was very kind and attentive to us. They offered suggestions when we asked, and were overall fabulous! 
The sushi was just fantastic. Me and my friend split three rolls (we came later in the evening) We shared an eel roll, the Volcano roll, and the I Did Your Girlfriend. Every single one was fresh, and made right in front of us. We couldn't get enough of the Volcano roll! 
We'll be back again, and again and again!"}
{"text":"First time, last time maybe.......

Service sucked, others agree in their posts its hit or miss well tonight it was miss. Rolls seem like a best of Las Vegas menu which would be nice but while they tasted good they where made like loose and just feel apart.

I'll stick to Oyshi"}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service was not great. 
We heard this was a really good place by family. 

I hope they had a better waitress. 
We went for my daughter birthday with a group of 6 people. 
For the price I would have hoped service would have been better. 

I probably won't return to this location."}
{"text":"So we ordered two noodle soba soup. Came out some plain watery overcooked soba. We ask the server if she can change our order because the noodle taste bad. She said no sorry we cant change it for you and will have to pay for it. Really? 
What kinda service is that??? This place is a scam and not upscale sushi place. They don't care how there food taste, and special they don't care about customer satisfaction. Very bad service! One of the worst sushi places in las vegas, they have 3 stars on yelp and they deserve it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times. The sushi is inconsistently fresh and prices average. The variety of rolls is over the top

Quality of fish is good. I'm a stickler when it comes to sushi rice which is above average.

Service can be hit or miss depending on how busy the place is and it can be busy on weekends.  

They also rush you when they are packed. I wasn't done ordering for the night when they brought the check. 

The bathrooms were filthy."}
{"text":"This is the place for our weekly \"family sushi night\". The fish is always fresh, the specials rolls are yummy and the service is awesome. We do like to try other sushi restaurants, but this is our \"sushi home\".

Our favs: Cucumber Island, Salmon Roe Sushi, Philadelphia Roll, Final Fantasy's, Taste Like My X-Girlfriend"}
{"text":"The sushi roll names are witty and the design is appeasing. . .
The rice on the sushi was not fresh which ruins the sushi. After two flat bottles of Pellegrino they tried to tell me that their water wasn't as sparkling. I never received a plate to eat my food. I will never go anywhere but Sen of Japan again."}
{"text":"Alrighty...my first review was a it's good review :-) yup, I was just that lazy that day. 
Well it's been awhile and I came back to have a fast dinner break here since it's down the road from work. 

I have to say I'm spoiled now, the Cresta before that said, \"it was good :-)\" never tried Yummy Grill before. My eyes are open now and the bar has been set. I sat at the bar and chatted with the sushi chefs for a brief moment. They are nice but no personality plus coming my way. The sushi was okay, decent...no wiggles in my seat though. I ordered a I love my ass (I don't really love my ass) and some tuna sashimi. The sashimi was pretty thick but the quality wasn't all there. 

I'll be back I'm sure, can't beat a quickie sushi fix for a dinner break ;-)"}
{"text":"We were trying to avoid the strip and its commercialism, so we decided to try Sushi Loca, despite the name.  We are both definitely sushi snobs, so readers of this review should take that in to account.  

We were there on a weekday afternoon, before dinner time.  There were only a couple of tables occupied.  We chose to eat at the sushi bar.  A brief look at the kitchen menu showed a wide variety of dishes, but we decided to stick with sushi.  We were immediately served a small dish of pickled cucumbers, which were pretty standard, but tasty.  The server brought us a small pot of hot tea.  He was efficient, clearing plates away as we finished with them.

The sushi menu is vast, consisting mostly of rolls with crazy combinations of ingredients and silly names. We generally avoid Americanized rolls at all cost, extending this even to establishments that serve them, but since they seemed to be the specialty here, we decided to try a few.  Sex on the Beach was scallops on the inside with salmon outside the rice.  The Rainbow Roll was typical, but a bit sloppily constructed (all the big combo rolls were, really).  Dragon Roll had eel and some other ingredients.  The benchmark of a good sushi bar for us is their tuna roll.  Loca's was lacking.  There was almost too much fish in it, and there wasn't any wasabi.  Sashimi octopus and squid were okay, but the temperature of the fish on these, like a number of the other pieces we had was too cold.  It wasn't frozen, but cold enough to take away from the true, subtle  flavor of the fish.   The other issue we had with the sushi was the sushi rice.  It was missing something: our theory is that it's a little short on sushi vinegar.

The highlight was a bowl of rolley rice: salmon roe and crab mixed into rice with avocado on top and a spicy kick.  The sushi chef who was dealing with our order was very nice and friendly. He was South Korean, as were the other sushi chefs and waitresses (or at least they were also speaking Korean). He had recently returned from a trip to Japan, maybe for some training?  In any case, Japanese owned and operated sushi places are not always better, but they certainly have a leg up on knowledge and details.

Sushi Loca's food was good, but not fantastic.  The atmosphere seems like it could be fun with a bit more of a crowd, and it is nicely decorated.  It wouldn't be a top choice for us, but is a decent option for those who are into funky rolls, good portions and pretty reasonable prices."}
{"text":"So what if its Americanized; I love it for what it is - a great sushi place that has a twist on boring rolls.  I highly recommend the Jackpot roll it is something you won't want to share. The sauce it comes with is heavenly and sweet - a concoction that goes perfectly with the roll.  All ingredients are fresh and generous - I know it's a desert out there how fresh can it be that's what I thought and trust me I am picky about fresh sushi! You will be as surprised as I was.  Avoid the usual rush hours (dinner Fri & Sat and you should be fine). But even with a big crowd the turnover is pretty fast you are never waiting for too long."}
{"text":"This resturaunt was absolutely amazing in taste and presentation was on point! They served the best shrimp fried rice that me and my cousin have ever tasted! 
I ordered the shrimp tempura plate which was awesome, excluding the fact that they don't add as much tempura sauce you would probably like so I guess you could request more if you love that amazing tempura flavor!
My cousin ordered the 'Oh My God' plate which had crab, eel, and scallop that tasted pretty good! 
Definetely woud recommend this spot to anyone wanting some amazing sushi!"}
{"text":"Nice spacious dining area.  You walk right into the main sushi bar in the middle with tables on left and more family oriented eating.  To the right are more private booths.

They place more electronic/dance music which is a nice change to your typical sushi place.   The rolls all look fantastic and have some more risque names.  See the menu.

Fantastic kid's menu (strange way to judge a dining place but you wouldn't believe how many chicken strips/ mac and cheese you run into on the menu).

The one thing I didn't see was a bento box which was strange to me.  Maybe just missing the page it's on. Almost every place has that.

Prices are fairly reasonable for the type of food.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Yum!  They have huge rolls that are just delectable.  A bit pricey and I wasn't as impressed with the non-sushi entrees.  However, the sushi is awesome!

I would recommend getting an appetizer and just jumping straight into the sushi heaven."}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if possible, horribly overpriced food. Who wants to pay $13 for teriyaki chicken when you can get it across the street for $6? Staff was racist, I'm a white guy and they offered me a fork and not my gf who is from the Philippines.. But seriously way too damn expensive go to Tokyo sushi instead it has all you can eat unlike this one."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place so I wanted to try it myself. Loved it! Big menu with lots of choices and the tempura is so good. 
Great place to meet up with friends or date night with that someone special to get some great sushi. The service was amazing, always someone there to help. So glad we tried it...will definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and tongue-in-cheek names for them.  Ordering one roll is more than enough as all the add-ons make an order sky-high, yet delicious. This is quality sushi at a reasonable price and the service is always fantastic.  The sauces and add-ons can be overkill at times, but the flavor combo is excellent."}
{"text":"I had the beef teriyaki it was pretty good, except it came out about 15 minutes after everyone got their sushi and was almost done eating by the time mine came out. So they should have planned that differently, mine took longer then the sushi? Either way i had to make my family slow down from enjoying their sushi so  I wouldn't have to eat alone, that would've been awkward. 

The service wasn't good at all. It was our first time there, my first time to a sushi place, ( I know it sounds crazy huh). But either way the server just seemed like we were bugging her, it was ridiculous all we needed or asked was for options for the many of sushi plates that were ordered. 

The food was good, service and experience made this review not the best."}
{"text":"Came in today with my husband and daughter. Never been to a sushi spot that took forever to make the sushi. I ask our waitress when it would be ready and she said that there's other customers in the store who came in before me. How rude! When the food finally came I wasn't at all impressed by the salmon rolls they were tiny and expensive. Spicy tuna rolls were good though. I will not be returning to this place, ever."}
{"text":"I'm a relatively new convert to sushi. I've only been eating it a few years now. At first I was afraid of it, then I never really got any good sushi. I caught the vision about a year ago. Since then I have been everywhere trying everything. This is my favorite sushi place so far. My mouth waters every time I think of having sushi here. Everything I've tried has been really good. 

The flavors are vibrant and not muted. The spicy food comes out spicy, the cold food comes out cold, the hot food comes out hot, the sweet food tastes sweet, the crunchy food is crunchy, and the soft food is soft. It all works wonderfully together. It really is like an orchestra in your mouth.

Everytime I go there I randomly try a different dish. Each one is better than the last. I really enjoy choi's favorite, hands-up, and the pearl. If I had a complaint it would be that the menu gives each dish a unique, sexy,  sometimes fun raunchy name, but does a poor job of describing the differences between the sushi rolls. Ultimately it doesn't matter cuz they're all very good.

Service is usually average to poor. They do a good job of turning tables quickly but not really taking the time to be attentive. But the food is so good that nobody cares.

{"text":"I like the atmosphere and the music (it's not for everyone). Nice for a hot date in my opinion or with friends. I'll be bringing my friend here for cocktails and girl time. The Zipang Sake was awesome. Loved the fizz and the chilled shot glass that came with it. The seaweed salad was very good. I'll blush while I write this but I ordered the Screaming O ;) it was fresh and tasty. I probably won't get it next time because there was a lot of mayo with less spice, not to mention there are so many to try. Nothing bad about it because of how fresh it was and I could eat around the mayo. I liked the bed of radish it was placed on. We also had the Volcano and it was so good. Brought the rest home and it tasted even better when chilled in the fridge. We indulged with those choices so on our next trips, I'll try the lighter ones. Hubby said he wants to try the entrees like the teriyaki and fried rice. It was a craving we needed to fix and this place did the trick. Going lighter next time will allow us to have room to split the cheesecake. If we're too satisfied for dessert right after our meal, we'll order it to go and have it during a movie at home. The service was nice enough and pleasant for us. The staff seemed happy to be there for the most part. I couldn't really tell who our server was from beginning to end because there wasn't much of a connection but that wasn't a big deal. Overall, everyone was friendly. There was a super nice male waiter at the table next to us that I hope we get sometime. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"SUSHI LOVER'S REJOICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG!!! WHERE DO I BEGAN L0L.... This restaurant is amazing!!!! First off... it is hands down one of my favorite places to eat at me and my fiance. The food is incredibly mouth watering here... and talk about freshness you can taste; the decor is very modern and elegant. And the atmosphere is ultra hip and inviting as well, they never skimp on the sizes of their sushi rolls, and you know you've found a really great spot when it's always a line headed out the door. Sushi Loca is a local's favorite; with great food and friendly staff... I am truly a fan of this restaurant... They're hands down one of the best sushi restaurant outside of the Las Vegas strip in town!"}
{"text":"I didn't read the reviews until after I had ordered. And to no surprise we were seriously disappointed with everything. The three rolls we ordered were all kinda just like mush, the calamari appetizer was flavorless and their tempura breading wasn't good either. We also ordered several pieces of sashimi of which the mackerel had bones in it and the waitress didn't seemed too concerned. The disappointment grew when our bill was 120 dollars. Terrible experience all around.. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner last Saturday after the fight.

Friendly staff and the special rolls menu was ridiculously long!

Not bad at all, the names were funny and the sushi had alot of different things going on with it but it tasted pretty good.

The actual combinations were interesting to say the least.

If i'm ever in the northwest side of town again, I would definitely go back just to try some of the other special rolls they have going on."}
{"text":"Super fun staff! Interesting combos of rolls, but honestly a rock solid 3 stars on the food. Not terrible, not amazing.

We have been a couple times. The first time on a chilly winter night, we had Udon. Sorry, it was an U-dont! Terrible. So I decided to wait on my review, because ...hey, they are a sushi place after all.

Have been a couple of times since. trying different \"hysterically named\" rolls like \" I love My Ass\" and a few classics. Spicy Scallop, and spicy tuna, and so on. And they were fine. 

This is a great place to grab a quick bite before a movie at the super sexy Regal Downtown Summerlin. But to be Razzle Dazzled with some incredible sushi? Ya' not so much."}
{"text":"That place is absolutely disgusting. I ordered shrimp Temporel with vegetables and it was drenched in oil all over my hands it was still raw it was disgusting the lady wanted to fight with me and tell me that that's how it's supposed to be I had oil running down my hands it was disgusting I should've walked out once I noticed that aroma and the smell of disgusting fish but I wanted something light.  The worst customer service I would never spend one dollar back in that place ever again!"}
{"text":"Taste like your ex gf...yummy!! Teriyaki Steak app is bomb too!! Been craving this all week..can't wait."}
{"text":"This place is super yummy. My sister always tells me I don't like sushi but I eat crab rolls xD I guess that could be so as I don't do raw fish and I trade all the seaweed for soypaper!!! BUT!! The point is, the here at Sushi Loca are so awesome and do our orders as asked and I couldn't be happier. I love the chole wrap or something. It's a spicy crab roll but rolled with cucumber instead of rice. FANTASTIC!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the sushi is huge and piled with so much stuff it all tastes the same. The service was so so as well."}
{"text":"My brother and sister-in-law were visiting this week-end and my brother had remembered years ago that the food here was really good and asked to go back.  My husband and I hadn't been for a while so we all went on Friday night.  My sister-in-law has some dietary restrictions so we did not order the things that we usually do but what we had was still delicious.  We ordered some toro and were very pleased when the waitress told us that they would not recommend it that evening.  We really appreciated that."}
{"text":"A fun place with great sushi. I highly recommend the \"Fat Ass\" roll. It's a giant roll in case you couldn't tell by the name. This is one of the few sushi places in Vegas I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm being generous with my rating. I've frequented sushi loca  in the past even took guests from out of town, by I will not be returning to this establishment. Went her for a girls night out, the waitress took a long time to come take our order and the restaurant was nearly empty on a Monday evening so there's no reason for her to take 20 minutes to take our order. We ordered our first round and it wasn't bad. We ordered our second round and one person in our party wasn't pleased with her roll and asked if she could get something else. At first the waitress said no then changed her mind, but counted how many pieces of sushi were on the plate. She had an attitude about it which we brushed off. Then when we asked for our bill we paid in cash she counted our money at the table as if we were not going to pay for our bill. Our waitress was rude the service we received today was not worth our patronage. We will not return, in this city there are plenty of sushi options so there is no need to return."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant through CitySearch and noticed the rave reviews. Being a foodie, I decided to check it out the other night. Where I live in Vegas, it's a 9 minute drive on the freeway, so it's close. It's also located in a very nice area of town, which brought my hopes up. Going with a previous review stating that this was better than Nobu--which honestly did not impress me when I went last week--I wanted to see what an off strip Sushi bar could offer.

Walking into the place, you feel like you've steped into a posh Japanese sushi bar. The colors and layout is fantastic, and there are at least four sushi chefs on hand at all times. I loved the menu offerings, from cold and hot appetizers to the infamous hibachi and bento boxes. As any great sushi bar will have, they offer the Americanized rolls but have a beautiful variety of sushi to order. We ordered the Man dai sushi (Japanese snapper) and garlic tuna sushi, along with shrimp & vegetable tempura appetizer, beef teriyaki (cut up ribeye) appetizer, fried gyoza, Nobu special roll, and yellowtail jalapeno sashimi (which they offer at Nobu for three times the price).

I have to say that as a person who grew up on a Pacific Island and having access to authentic Asia cuisine, including breathtaking Japanese sushi chefs and their culinary expertise, this place ranks on my top five places in Las Vegas to go for sushi. Not only were the flavors beautiful and clean, but their service was impeccable, their servers dressed (the women only) in kimonos which added to the authenticity of the restaurant, and the traditional Japanese greetings coming in and leaving. Add on the experience with honest-to-god beautiful and very delictable Japanese cuisines, and you have yourself a fantastic restaurant off the strip that is much better than what the hotels have to offer.

I know some people may think that I am exxagerating, but you have to try it to understand the beauty in their food."}
{"text":"Great food but they need more servers. Service takes forever"}
{"text":"I usually love this place, really I do. I've bought friends from out of town here, I've spent a significant amount of money here but tonight, was my last night. 
I ordered spicy tuna roll and my hubby got fried rice. Then we ordered the jackpot roll--my favorite. I order it every time but tonight it was off. And I told the owner I was dissatisfied. She then proceeded to tell me how it was the most popular item on the menu and she was sure it was made right. She wanted me to swap it for something else but as I said...I only order that. So I said no thank you and to just take it back. She went on to tell me how amazing it was, how sad she was that I didn't like it and that she was going to cry (she even did the hand motions for crying--wiping eyes #saywhaaat??) AND that we still had to pay for it. She argued with us for 5 minutes over this roll and told us that she'd do it this time but next time she won't just \"let us try things and send it back.\" We politely told her there wouldn't be a next time, she then tried to argue with us all over again!! I'm appalled that this restaurant doesn't have basic customer service etiquette. I've had meals comped for FAR LESS ISSUES. I'm so disappointed in this experience. The food was tasty, that's why we gave 2 stars but the customer not being right is what makes me never want to come back again. OH and their credit card minimum transaction is ridiculous. This isn't a small shop this a large restaurant in DT Summerlin, Sushi Loca. Do better."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times off and on. It is dark inside, which is fine to set the mood, but they have loud music blaring pop borderline nightclub music. It can start to get quite roudy at times with the chefs at the sushi bar whooping it up with the patrons sitting there. I'm all for people enjoying themselves, but seems to send the message that party goers are welcomed more than other types of paying customers. Plus all the noise can interfere with conversations you are trying to have with your family/friends. 

Perhaps not the best environment for young children either (sushi wise), as the names on several of the rolls refer to actions taken with the genitalia. (Probably don't want to have sex ed IN the restaurant with your wee ones.)

Now don't get me wrong thinking I'm bashing the place. I'm not. Like I said, seems to be more for the partiers than family friendly.

All the rolls I've had are all awesome.

You are brought ought a salad dish which is very tasty. Can't remember the other dishes I've had here, but they definitely were good going down in my tummy.

Next time we go, may have to have a babysitter."}
{"text":"Ya this place is pretty darn good.  To be honest at first I didn't want to like it because of the mexican-esse name, despite this prejudice I have ended up here like 4 times and have always had a great meal.

My go to spot for good sushi thats not too expensive.  The fish has always been real fresh, salmon is my favorite nigiri and it has always been real good when I have ordered it.  If you like all kinds of crazy rolls this place has got it, hence the name.  The ones I have tried all have been tasty.  Its a cool restaurant too, probably the best spot in the northwest however I haven't tried them all."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. Perfect ambience for families and dinner for two. Never fail to provide best quality meals and quantity is just right. Recommend the Jackpot and Heart Attack specialty roll, goyza, shrimp tempura and any teriyaki lunch /dinner. We've only had to wait no longer than 5 minutes in the past three years. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"All of the staff was smiling and extremely polite, they greeted me at the door and lunch was simple and delicious. Thanks"}
{"text":"Great service and discovered an Amazing roll - the Burning Sensation roll was the best!"}
{"text":"I like the food served here, but sadly the last time I went I had to leave after ordering my appetizer because the service was so poor. The wait for the chicken teriyaki appetizer was long. I also asked multiple times to at least 2 or 3 different waitresses and staff members for an order of rice but they would always forget to bring it to me. I ended up finishing my appetizer before any rice had gotten to me. I wasn't going to ask anymore, it should have came when I asked the first time. I simply asked for my check, paid, and left after only eating an appetizer. I would come back here, but only if the service was better. :("}
{"text":"Wasnt bad, not worth the money... ive definitely had better for way better pricing. I had the Mexican and the Spicy Yellowtail roll. My husband did not like the Fat Ass roll, he didnt like it but i did. The Classic Tempura is what he enjoyed. Service was fast and polite."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We love their rolls. My friend lives in South West and every time I go to her she asks me to bring smth from Sushi Loca, especially Japanese Lasagna and Screaming O salad. She is obsessed with it. As for me I like Jack Pot roll very much and many others too. Everything I ever ordered was delicious."}
{"text":"This has Been a staple for me and the hubs since its original location at Centennial Hills. We were so excited to learn they were opening one around the corner!! Favies are Screaming Orgasm and Oh My God! roll."}
{"text":"The sushi was mediocre. I went there for their lunch special. On their website and on Yelp their lunch special is priced at either $9.95 or $10.95 but at the restaurant on their menu it's $13.95. I ordered the lunch special #2 with sushi and a roll - most definitely not worth the value. There's tons of other bento boxes and sushi specials around the area with much better deals."}
{"text":"This place used to be really awesome now lately it just sucks.
The food is good but service sucks butt! No joke I gave it so many tries and it just seems like this place is just slowly down grading itself. 
I knew service was bad here but I figured maybe give it another go.

:( Man was that a bad Idea. 

I order a spicy yellowtail roll and a eel  bento entree. My date order the salmon collar app and a beef hibachi entree.
So we knew collars take forever to come out so we ordered that first before even deciding what entrees we wanted. So the spicy yellowtail came out, and man that thing was the ugliest sushi I've ever seen. It was so half-ass made. The rice wasn't even sticking together the fish look so odd o.O it felt like a gamble to eat. 
So then we got our soups that comes with the entree and I didn't even get to take a sip of it and my entree came out super fast and my date is left waiting for his for about 7 mins or so and I had to starting eating my food before it got cold. Now, were basically almost done eating and our collar never came. So I ask about how much longer, she had the balls to say I never ordered it! Are you serious that was the first thing I ordered after the drinks. 
And surprisingly it's nothing new they forgot my beer before and didn't even remember till I was done eating AND I had to ask for myself.

This place needs some serious 9-1-1 server training!

I don't think I'm ever coming back again. 

I was so mad I was just like give me the check already."}
{"text":"Excellent this is my favorite Sushi place they dont offer all you can eat but I prefer the quality"}
{"text":"This place is great.  It's conveniently located in Downtown Summerlin and there's plenty of parking.  We went there for the first time tonight and it was delicious.  I had the miso soup and the volcano roll while my husband had the rainbow roll.  Everything was delicious, the service was prompt and courteous, and we'll definitely go back.  It was also nice that we didn't have to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"Its aiight, nothing to rave about. Only go if you are in the vicinity. I have visited 3 times, hoping it would get better each time, but no. The sushi was not very tasty, even the simple easy stuff. The spicy tuna, not even spicy, no taste at all. I ordered that only after spitting out the supposed, specialty rolls. The service, rushed, and not personable. The hot green tea tasted like mop water. Do yourself a favor and keep driving."}
{"text":"Finally found a good sushi spot in Vegas!! We will be back for sure! The food is good and the decor is super cute!!"}
{"text":"Had Valentine's day dinner here last night. Place was packed but the staff kept it under control; at least while we were there. Food was excellent as usual. \"My Okinawa, Japan replacement\" - miss that place!"}
{"text":"Great sushi always consistently fresh and amazing! A little pricey but you definitely get what you pay for here. There service is great as well."}
{"text":"I have waited places for 45-50 minutes at sushi places with really nothing that great. Sushi Loca on the other hand.. TOTALLY different experience. Always seat right away and the place is always packed, loud music, super upbeat vibe, the later it gets in the evening the crazier it gets. The sushi is the best I've had anywhere. I am SO picky but have never been disappointed!!! The Pear Special? HELLO. Amazing. The Jackpot, Taste like my Ex-Girlfriend. its all so good. If your in the area its worth the stop!!!"}
{"text":"Been there for lunch.  Loved it.  Good food and good service.  

Been there a few times for dinner.  Loved it.  Good food, great vibe, and great service.  

Went there tonight for a late night meal.  Big mistake!!!

Went there at 10pm.  No hostess.  Server finally came to seat us and look pissed off.  

Sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chef looked miserable.  All the fish in the display fridge was cleared out.  They looked like they were ready to close and they still had two hours until closing.  

Ordered food from the sushi chef and the sushi was excellent.  I told him that I needed to order some food off the menu, but he told me that I needed to order from our server.  Our server who we have not seen since we got our drinks.

The restaurant is practically empty.  How can service be this bad?!?!

After 30 minutes into our meal, we told the sushi chef that we were ready for our check.  He finally smiled and looked relieved.  

We waited for our check and couldn't find anybody.  Finally a busser asked us how we were and we told him that we just needed our check.  He brought the check back and we asked him where our server went.  He said that her and the chef were in the back eating, because they missed their meal earlier.  LOL.  

Unbelievable.  

My tip to fellow yelpers... Go for lunch.  Go for dinner.  Don't go late night.  

IF management reads these reviews, we were there at 10pm on Sat 4/4."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been regular customers at the original Sushi Loca. It is our favorite place to get really good rolls. Once we learned that they opened another location closer to us we were so excited. 

We've only been twice since it has opened because the service us so horrible. The wait staff are impatient, rude, and vengeful. We usually each get a roll and split a third. On this last visit our waitress became VERY impatient while we were deciding on our 3rd roll. Usually I would understand her impatience, but we were 1 of maybe 4 or 5 tables. There was no rush. Well 25 minutes later we still didn't have our food. We had to track down another waitress. 

The food is also more expensive than the original location. We used to be able to order 3 specialty rolls and drinks for $40. Summerlin location charges $2-3 more a roll.  

I will go the distance to eat at the original location. This place is way to pricy and rude for me."}
{"text":"Wait staff running around doing Everything but Nothing, we sat at the sushi bar where some gentleman proceeded to tell the sushi chef the men's room needed hand soap and toilet paper . Husbands beef teriyaki he said was decent. I had sushi, with small side of tempura. SO the tempura tasted like old oil with more breading then vegetables. The baked roll was warm on top .. everything under cold? Can't say I would recommend the place for those prices. Waited to check out & our sushi chef actually had to flag down a waitress"}
{"text":"We visited this establishment when they opened. It was crazy delicious. We came back with several friends it was the most disgusting sushi smelling food we've ever had. They were ignorant when we explain to them there was something wrong. We will never go back"}
{"text":"Probably the worst sushi place I've been in town when factoring quality, price point and service.

My wife brought me here as she heard it was great...

Terrible service, sushi was below average

Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. Plenty of other options that blow this place away within 5 miles of here"}
{"text":"My wife and I were starving for some good tasting sushi, so I Yelp'd and found Sushi Loca.  We went on a Sunday night and the restaurant was wicked busy, but plenty of seating was available.  I'm sure on a Friday or Saturday night, there's probably a wait time, but we lucked out this trip.  First, the menu is crazy!  This is perfect considering the restaurant is in Las Vegas.  Also, they have a grip of specials and menu choices galore. But enough of that, we wanna talk about the food, right! 
We ordered the mixed tempura appetizer and four rolls.  My wife had water and I had green tea. Our rolls consisted of: a Rainbow, Holy Cow, Lasagna Roll and the Heart Attack.

The tempura batter is a little thicker that the batter that I correlate with Japanese dining, but it was tasty. The shrimp were monsters and cooked nicely and the vegetables were fresh!  
I always order a Rainbow roll.  I feel that a good sushi restaurant should be able to make a basic Rainbow roll with good flavor.  Sushi Loca succedded in this realm.  The fish was fresh and consisted of thick,  healthy cuts of meat.  It was delish!   The Holy Cow was amazing as well.  The salmon was cool against the heat of the spicy sauce, but not over whelming.  The Holy Cow was demolished but enjoyed tremendously.  
The Lasagna Roll is a baked roll and takes a little longer.  The only issue we had was the cream cheese wasn't melted as much as it should have been and the rolls were only warm, not hot.  For me, fish has to be hot or cold, not in between and I'm sure, when prepared correctly, this roll is at the top of it's game.  This roll is delicious, but be ready, it's also super rich!!!!  This roll is beautiful on the plate and we may have to try it again. If we do, I'll let y'all know what I think.  
Lastly, we had the Heart Attack.  This roll is a deep-fried roll.  It's pretty good. The only issue we had with this roll is it came out about 10 minutes after most of our table had been cleared-- we thought the waitress had forgotten to get it ordered.  This roll has some heat to it!  It's deep fried, cut into pieces and garnished with a jalapeno and a dab of sarracha.  It's also served with a dish of sarracha mayo and teriyaki for dipping.  If you like smoked salmon, heat and deep fried cream cheese then this is your roll. 

Overall, Sushi Loca is a nice spot to get some good sushi.  The restaurants staff is friendly, quick and the location is good.  The food is reasonably priced and the fish is fresh.  My only suggestion is to mix it up a little, but enjoy the good eats!"}
{"text":"For a local place that has been nothing but consistent I have to give it 4 stars. We like the food. I really have had nothing but great and good rolls. Never any yuck ones. It tends to get loud. And one friday night I swear we could've been in chuck E. cheese for the chaos of kids in there but you know what, if the place wasn't good, people wouldn't go at all. And yes, the names are cheezy. But, really, it's good. Slightly over priced but we have had many a good times there since it's been open!"}
{"text":"Worse service of any restaurant I have ever eaten at. We have always been big tippers however tonight was the first time we left 0 it was that bad. Food is good if you can deal with lazy unmotivated staff."}
{"text":"Ordered some avocado rolls and vegetable yakisoba. The environment is pretty \"club-like\" and I got a good laugh from reading the menu. The service was extremely good. Got a table really quickly and didn't have to wait around for the server to take the table's orders. I definitely give them 5 stars for their service. The yakisoba tasted a bit off to me, so I asked if I could exchange it for something else and the manager came over and said that was alright. Needless to say, service is amazing and the people are very friendly. I will likely stick to other places though."}
{"text":"We continue to get bad service but I return because I really like the food
The owner is kinda mean and the servers suck"}
{"text":"food = good
waitress = if i knew where they were id say ok...
food comes out way after you order it, but take a moment to think about what you want and.... the waitress huffs puffs and walks away....
okay.... 25 minute drive to original... so worth it....
so much for a happy night in a pricey sloppy put together sushi place...
guess i gave 3 stars because i enjoyed the sticky table, tonic water that they call sprite and oh yea, my HOT sushi coming out cold....  ok now im down to 2 stars....
2 stars... because they gave free desert after they saw how pissed we were."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and they never disappoint! Double down is my favorite roll! I am also a big fan of their shrimp fried rice and miso soup! The service is always good and I love the room as well. They have nice flat screens if you want to watch a sporting event and the bar is very spacious! I actually prefer to sit at the bar there. Prices are right around what you would expect from a sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was okay. A bit bland. The decor of the restaurant is beautiful, but it's nothing too special."}
{"text":"Great Sushi, service could be better. Loved the Double Down roll, was amazing, and Yellowtail sashimi."}
{"text":"Awesome sauce!!
We love all the food and the service is top knotch !
We will be back !!
Hot saki and Saporo!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! Sushi was served fresh and fast.  Server was very friendly and establishment was very clean and trendy."}
{"text":"The food was so delicious. We ordered jackpot roll, salmon skin salad, tempura set, spicy edamame and grilled squid. Just ignore all the negative reviews here. The service was great."}
{"text":"If you close at 11PM don't make the guests feel rushed at 10:10 .... Hostess / manager woman came over and told us last call was at 10:30 .... She said it at 10:10.  My girlfriend wanted to leave based on the attitude...... Close at 10 if you are pissed to work until 11 !!!  I had the who is your ex-wife roll ( I love sushi rip off) it was ok but not good ... Fishy smell ... Overall not terrible but far from good .... I will be driving from Red Rock to I Love Sushi again .... Nothing to see here ... Lighting and empty sushi counters make you feel like this place is already dead .... It won't last long so try it quick !! I just went again to see if it was as bad as I thought..... It was worse !!! I would walk to I Love Sushi from Summerlin before I would drive 3 minutes from my house to eat here!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Honey Roll and Final Fantasy 2.
( it's not AYCE which is the main reason why I won't go back anytime soon) Honey roll was great. final Fantasy was too big. All of their rolls are really big which isn't my style.
Service was great and it was a nice decor.
If you live other by this location give it a try.
I had a great experience but not worth the drive all the way across town especially since it's not AYCE.."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome!!!!!!!!! The service is beyond great. Very polite and accommodating. The sushi is some of the best. My daughter who's picky ate the teriyaki beef like it was her last meal. She loved it. Trendy, hipster feel with the remix dance versions of popular songs. Very clean. Go get you some sushi!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a number of times.  It deserves to be recognized as one of the best in the area.  The softness of the rice and yet the compact wrapping make me order sushi rolls after sushi rolls every time I go there."}
{"text":"The raunchy titled rolls are part of restaurant's gimmick --  I'm still trying to figure out if the Final Fantasy rolls were named after the popular video game franchise or if they're alluding to another form of entertainment. 

Sushi Loca is a typical neighborhood sushi joint  with a large sushi bar, plenty of seating, Japanese wall decor, and a music playlist that has a collection of J-Pop and Pitbull tracks. 

All right, let's get down to the food. This restaurant has a downside: there isn't an AYCE option which means you can end up spending a lot of money. The sushi rolls on the Extraordinary Rolls menu can cost about $12.00 per roll. Sushi and sashimi can cost approximately $5.00 per order. If you like masago with quail eggs like I do, quail eggs are an additional charge.

Dynamite: Rice with sliced mushrooms, scallops, cream cheese, green onions, and smelt eggs -- all baked together. I'm used to eating Dynamites that consist mainly of seafood, and this one could've used more than just a few pieces of scallops; the mushrooms were a good fit, though. 

Nobu Special: This is the roll my boyfriend ordered from the Extraordinary Rolls menu. It's filled with cream cheese and fried salmon, and avocado on the outside and smelt eggs and dots of hot sauce to top it off. Not a bad roll overall. It had a little bite to it because of the jalapeño slices and the hot sauce. Usually, that kind of combo for a sushi roll makes my stomach upset, but it was executed well. 

Salmon Collar: A roll and a dynamite weren't enough for our appetites, so we finished dinner off with salmon collars. The tops were nicely grilled, but the bottoms were over charred. Fortunately, that issue didn't ruin our meal. Overall, it was good.

The service was fine; though, I don't think this is the sort of place where servers are talkative and ask how you're doing. It's basically get the job done and leave the customer alone until they call on you -- sometimes, that's not a bad thing. My one criticism is that it was difficult to track down our server.

I haven't had positive experiences dining at sushi restaurants on the northern part of town, but the food here is better than expected. Now, if only this place had an AYCE option...

Rating: 3.5/5.0 Stars"}
{"text":"best sushi in this area. i've tried going to other places around centennial hills but nothing is as fresh as this place. plus its across the street from our house, so convenient for late night sushi cravings"}
{"text":"Generally when I go somewhere new,  especially for sushi, I leave with at least some type of memorable moment of the meal that allows me to write a review. This is not one of those times.

My only memories of Sushi Loca are the fact that it doesn't have an identity. It has the design and decor of a trendy upscale restaurant, with a menu that looks like it was written by a horny 15 year old boy. Some of the rolls have ridiculously perverted names for no reason. Oh, and they were playing 90's rock which just confused the shit out of me.

The food? As I mentioned before, it was less than memorable. My favorite part of the meal happened to be the free pre-meal sample of a cucmber salad that was really enjoyable. The sushi itself was fresh but the flavor combinations just seemed a bit confusing and overly ambitious. I'll stick to Naked Fish and Sen of Japan for my daring sushi choices."}
{"text":"I get takeout from this place probably once every week or two. The sushi is amazing and the price is too. They don't skimp on the rolls, they are always nice and plump. The atmosphere is very nice as well, great place for a younger crowd. Parking on weekends is a bit annoying because they share a parking lot with Olive Garden. Other than that its totally worth it."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for fried gyoza and miso salmon. Fresh sashimi and they took good care of our toddler every time, and it's her favorite restaurant. We even saw Andre Agassi here!"}
{"text":"This place SUCKS!!! They've tried to re-invent the wheel. The rolls are WAY too big to eat. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"I've come here a couple times and have never been disappointed with the sushi. I love that the restaurant is spacious and modern, service has always been friendly and attentive. My friend and I were here yesterday around 4:30pm, we got two large Kiran's, 4 specialty rolls(Shrimp Tempura Roll, Neptune Roll, can't remember the name of the other two rolls) and 4 orders of garlic tuna with our bill totaling $111. I would recommend having a happy hour just so there is a little discount off the bill as we all know sushi can get expensive. Regardless, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Located in Downtown Summerlin, the restaurant is beautiful and modern inside. The space is sexy, inviting, and comforting and showed a lot more personality than the drab exterior, which does nothing to draw people in.

Sushi purists, this is not the place for you. This is Americanized sushi to the max, full of mayo and orgasm sauce covering many dishes and rolls on the menu. But, that doesn't bother me. Sometimes I crave this type of bastardized Japanese the same way I occasionally crave a box of Kraft mac and cheese. I know it won't be the best, but it feeds and satisfies the craving.

The spicy tuna sashimi ($11.95) is nicely plated with thin cuts of fish atop rice noodles, all covered in a light sauce. The tuna wasn't bad, it exceeded my expectations which were low to begin with. The hamachi nigiri ($5.25) and the garlic ponzu tuna ($6.25) were slightly better than what you'd find at an all-you-can-eat joint.

Most rolls have ridiculous names and ridiculous amounts of ingredients and sauces. The massive \"Put your hands up\" was covered in tempura flakes and sauces like a snowpocolypse had just hit it. Each piece of the roll was so huge you'd have to be a porn star to fit it in your mouth. The Tiger roll was pretty good.  The Loca Special was my favorite roll of the night. While it was still crazy big, it was more manageable than the first one. As is common here, it was drowning in sauce to mask the freshness of the product, but it did its job -- it satisfied my appetite.

If you're just looking to stuff your face silly, you're better off heading to an AYCE spot. Otherwise, this is a decent place to go to quench you hunger for oversauced Americanized sushi.

{"text":"It was good. But mostly, it was FUN! Sat at the bar and ate with a couple of friends and then we drank with the owner! BTW, he's HILARIOUS!! Who knew you could, drink, laugh and roll all at the same time!
Food was fresh (which is SUPER important for sushi!), tasty and made to order! Service was friendly and equally fun! I'll have to go back and eat again to give them a proper review though."}
{"text":"Pros: Ambiance, service is good. Sushi is good. They have dipping sauces that make the sushi great! 
Cons: A bit pricey for sushi. It's especially not family friendly. They have 'appetizer' teriyaki chicken. $7.95 for teri chicken without rice! Who does that?! They charge for everything. For expensive sushi, it's kind of a turnoff."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi spot!
LOVE love Love everything about it!  I've eaten sushi all over this country and I'm certain that it doesn't get any better than this!

~FRESH, quality fish!
~GREAT atmosphere........upbeat, loud music at night!
~Incredibly friendly staff!
~Garlic edamama..........what?!?!?!?!  Finger-lickin' good!
~Sashimi...........   =)"}
{"text":"No liquor license...
Average service...
Pretty good food...
And a hair in my ramen...the waitress stood there and then asks, \"what would you like me to do with this\"? The attitude was super awkward and semi rude! 

I will give them credit...they did take it off my bill! 

Not a terrible experience, and I will definitely try again."}
{"text":"I'm sure glad I ignored the bad reviews. This place is great!! Sat at the sushi bar and had my entire order in 10 mins. Fun atmosphere. Fun music. Fun vibe. GOOD sushi! No hair in my food like another patron mentioned. Ordered: Screaming orgasm appetizer and Neptune dazzler roll and I highly recommend both!!"}
{"text":"The positives, cute atmosphere, great location and bill splitting is not a problem.

The negatives would be everything else.  I ordered the lunch box with beef teriyaki and chicken karage.  It came with miso soup, salad, rice and gyoza.  I've ordered similar boxes at other restaurants so I was pleasantly surprised that the portion size seemed to match the $14 price.  The miso soup and salad were what I expected.  The chicken karage was disappointing as it had no real flavor and was extremely dry.  The beef teriyaki was not very tender.  Everything just felt like it was missing flavor.  As far as service the waitress was friendly although I never got a refill on my drink and she never inquired if I wanted one.  

The price point for the rolls was high compared to other places and based on the fact that I had stomach issues after this meal I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Didn't love this place. 

Right when I walked in I thought the decor of the place was really nice. It was open, specious with a nice design. 

We were there for lunch so we had ordered off the lunch menu, which my friends and I thought was perfect. Around 13 dollars for a rice box or a nigiris + 1 roll. Not Bad. 

But right in that first bite of the albacore, it was really tough to chew through. Ultimately I was already disappointed. I guess what made it up was the really tender salmon on the salmon nigiri. Oh and also the service. Our server didn't give us a hard time on splitting our checks."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite sushi restaurant but in the past five years that I have been coming here, the quality and service has declined considerably over the past couple years. The plates and cups are all chipped. The wait for to-go orders, even ones that have been called in is longer than if you had eaten a meal at the restaurant. The sushi doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't taste as fresh as it used to. The few times I have eaten toro here, it has been rather stringy. I dont recall getting complimentary edamame the last time I came. Oh, and there was a hair in my sushi roll last time I was here. I love the Candy Roll, but that isn't enough to bring me back. Get it together Sushi Loca! I miss coming here."}
{"text":"I'm late writing my review and must admit it comes inspired by visiting a subpar  popular sushi pace in summerlin. Sushi loca  does not offer ACE but we've grown to appreciate quality over quantity! This place is the real deal. Everything from authentic sushi to special rolls is super fresh and tasty. Service is great. We haven't come across any specials or frequent diners type of specials/awards but we still go back about once a week for the past year or so. Even tried takeout. It's pricey, but after tonight's subpar sushi, we will pay the price for good, fresh, tasty sushi with a nice environment."}
{"text":"We come here often, especially for large groups. Everything here is great but my most favorite dishes are lobster roll, OMG and Megabucks. And for dessert, I love their Deep Fried Green tea Ice Cream."}
{"text":"Floors are sticky, bathroom was a mess, horrible customer service, waited until we asked for the check to get asked for more water, the rolls weren't wrapped well at all and no all you can eat"}
{"text":"Sashimi platter is good as I liked the slices thick. Their lunch specials at USD13 is a great value too. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I can't remember all the rolls we tried except for heart attack and it was so good. Prices weren't too bad. My only complaint is the music. We went for lunch one day with our 2 five year olds and the music was unedited. I don't want to take my kids to a restaurant where the f word and b word are being said on the speakers."}
{"text":"The bar was dirty when we arrived.. understaffed? Pricey and not the best quality. Don't sit at the bar if you want to eat."}
{"text":"Awesome!  The food, the drinks, the service... All impeccable. Julie is the owner and she came over to our table and absolutely made our night. Love this place... Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Considering the good reviews, I was shocked by the low quality of the food. The fish was old and rubbery. Parts of it had even started to get dried out and hard on the edges! None of the vegetable tasted fresh, like they just came out of the freezer. The cheesecake tasted like like something from Wal-Mart, and the cherry topping was thick and low quality like the stuff you get in cans at Wal-Mart."}
{"text":"I am impressed with my first encounter at Sushi Loca, and I only ordered to-go!  I was house sitting in Centennial area and had to get my sushi fix for dinner. This is definitely the place to try.

I ordered online using their phone app, nice and easy.  I left the house right after ordering and figured I'd wait a little bit at the restaurant to pick up the food.  Everything was ready as I arrived, 10 minutes tops and they had steady business inside!  Their fast to-go service blew my mind.  My only nitpick is to show the food during pickup, to ensure accuracy. I checked before I left so all was well.

Most important, the food was delicious and fresh. I ordered some nigiri, and two rolls. Sushi Loca is very attentive with boxing up the items and setting up the to-go bag (which is very important to me).

The salmon and yellowtail nigiri was fresh, with a good fish/rice ratio. The Final Fantasy roll was good, and the Natural Viagra was my favorite. Interesting name, I can't pass up smelt eggs on a roll!

I look forward to dining in, especially at the new location in Downtown Summerlin. :)"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was excellent. Loved the steak,shrimp and noodles with sauce and the sushi is awesome."}
{"text":"While this place is in a great location and has pretty ambience and decor, you quickly realize why prices for the most basic of rolls are so high, it costs a lot of money to have a restaurant in downtown Summerlin. The service is mediocre, the food was ok, and the experience is fine. Many other better sushi spots around here that are better. Only redeeming menu item: the Garlic Chili Edamame, that was the bomb and I would go back just for that."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places to eat for a non-AYCE joint.  The ambiance is really nice and hip.  The fish is always fresh every time I went there.  Furthermore, I love their unique names and take on their sushi rolls.  My favorite roll to eat there is the Kiss of Fire. Delish!"}
{"text":"It was okay... They don't have all you can eat.  Ordered something with mozzarella and a lot of fried onions and it was not good, too much cheese. It was in the neighborhood and wanted to try it. And never will go back.  I will only go to sushi bomb now"}
{"text":"Went on the 15th of March--a Saturday night around 6:30 p.m.

Sounds like the reviews outpace this establishment and it was no where close to the 4-stars it has cumulatively received over time.

Pro
- relatively quick service
- sushi....prepared better than most places

Cons
- miso soup....cool to the taste!
- hot green tea....room temperature!
- tempura udon noodle soup....tap water warm and seemed like tempura was previously cooked(frozen?!?) and then warmed up
- steamed rice....room temperature 
- music....EXCEPTIONALLY loud!!!!  Could not have had a conversation with the person sitting across from you in the booth.  Asked them nicely to turn it down even a little and it didn't matter to them one iota
- air conditioning....set for the workers and not the patrons---jacket/sweater worthy conditions

This is the last ever visit to sushi Loca as its worth driving to a place that truly cares about its customers and not just the bottom line.  It's too bad because there are very, very few sushi places on the north/northwest side of town."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this sushi restaurant! The quality of fish is amazing! The upbeat atmosphere and attentive service are always key in my book! This is a weekly treat for us!"}
{"text":"WOW!!!
I am surprised at how much I hate this place. 
I am usually not one to destroy a place after a bad meal, however my experience at Sushi Loca has to by far be one of the worst dining experiences I've had in Vegas. 

The food I would give three stars. Definitely not terrible. I would come back if it weren't for the staff.  If I were the owner, I'd probably fire the staff and hire a new crew ASAP. 

Overall staff customer service skills are very poor. It's so disappointing for a new spot to not be on their A game, especially when it's fairly slow in the restaurant. You will not be greeted by any of the staff as you walk in. I was able to wander around the entire restaurant without being asked if I would like to be seated. If you are reading this review while sitting at Sushi Loca, stand up and just walk out. I'm sure the servers won't even notice. 

I enjoyed most of the items I ordered except for the jalapeño poppers which were terrible. Do not order this. We tried to send this back. This is where bad service became somewhat offensive. Instead of asking what was wrong with the dish, she told us that the dish is exactly what the menu describes and if we did not like it, that is our problem since we ordered it. WTF?....ok....
My friend and I were pretty much speechless at this point and just asked if she could clear the dish and bring us our check. 
She returns with the check and attempts to make ammends by explaining to us that if she took off or replaced every item that a guest did not enjoy, the restaurant would lose too much money. I understand this, however it is obvious that customer satisfaction is not of concern. Eventually she ends the awkward with conversation with \"Just this once I will let you order something else that is the same price as that dish but never again OK!?\" 
First of all. Thank you? But I will never be back so don't worry about it. 

They also charge 50cents for all sauces. I wouldn't usually mention something like this in a review because 50 cents doesn't really matter, however I asked for ponzu and she brought out the wrong sauce at first but decided to charge me for both. 

My bill came out to $100 for two people. There is no way I'd ever return to this place. There are just too many great restaurants to choose from to waste your time here."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here but it does tend to get a bit pricey. Due to some county code or something they now close at 11 and that sucks balls for the late eater I am. Their food is really good and I just discover their kake udon soup. It's in the cheaper side around $6-7 but it does not travel well. The sushi is amazing! Love the sushi loca special and the final fantasy 7. Beside price I really enjoy it!"}
{"text":"It's always a bad sign when you go to a sushi spot on a Saturday night at 10pm with NO ONE THERE. There were only 2 other tables other than ourselves and it took 45 MINUTES just to get the check. Once you order your food, the waitress disappears into Narnia- making you wait forever for your damn check. The one star is for the food but the service is phucking horrible.  I gave this place a second chance. Never again."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here.  It's fun and friendly.the menu names, hilarious.  I love the quality of the fish, the tuna almost melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Ever want to feel like Norm on Cheers?  Well, walk into Sushi Loca and you'll feel like everybody knows your name! Ok, so it's not exactly the same and they don't really say your name. But boy does it sate the ole' ego when all the sushi chefs and wait staff cheer some happy Japanese somethin-or-other when you walk in the door!
For a local joint, the decor here is fabulous. Who'da thunk it just a stone's throw from Walmart and Payless? But indeed, walk through the suburban doors to find a pulsing urban atmosphere with lush red and purple velvet seat backs, black, industrial piping in the ceiling and up-tempo music to make you feel part of the IT crowd.
I've lived in the NW valley for almost 5 years, and this is the first place that marries really good sushi with a really cool atmosphere. I cannot recommend the spicy garlic edamame enough. I would travel to Hender-tucky for it! Honestly. Amazing. The sushi is fresh and creative with many the R-rated maki names :) I'll let you see those for yourself.
Take a date, go with friends, or go by yourself to flirt with the sushi chefs.  This place is a GO."}
{"text":"Sometimes sushi is just sushi. But I prefer Sushi Loca over them all. I tried something new today but can't say I enjoyed the shrimp tempura. My sons and I easily can eat this place out of business. More eel sauce please!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have come here a few times now since moving to vegas a few months ago. The price is not bad for the quality of the food and service. I have tried a numerous variety of the different sushi dishes on their menu and have enjoyed almost all of them, not that it was bad or sloppy, simply just not for my flavor preferences. 
Our only discrepancy is if you sit at the sushi bar the wait staff assumes you will be getting sushi and dont come around as offen for instance if your my non-sushi eating wife and want to get fried rice. However that is easily mitigated if you just ask to sit at a table."}
{"text":"Their sushi was really good but I'd like to say that what I liked the most was their customer service. They even changed the tv channel per our request. Now that's what I call service. They stopped by every now and then to make sure we were all set and even recommended items from their menu when I couldn't decide what else to order. My favorite thing from their menu was the fried ice cream. That's soul food for sure."}
{"text":"Tuna poke salad, pearl special and tastes like my ex girlfriend are my usual. I love this place. Excellent service, clean and the decor is so nice and elegant. 
Thanks sushi loca I'm one satisfied sushi eating gal every time I eat here."}
{"text":"Nothing really stands out .... the only thing worth mentioning is the yellow tail collar. We also had the lunch special and some rolls.   For this price I'd rather drive a little farther to Sen of Japan."}
{"text":"I never tried baked sushi before but It was possibly the best sushi dish I have ever had before. The other rolls left much to be desired and were overpriced but the baked sushi was worth this entire trip."}
{"text":"Poor service, feel like an inconvenience. Far too loud... I'm trying to eat dinner not go to a night club and names of rolls are totally inappropriate for kids. There are many great other options in this town. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Love there food ...its always good...this time the service was the worst ever.....never got our food ...when they finally notice we didn't have our food and all the other people that was seated after us was eating they begin to worry...NOT HAPPY. ...a little light to offer us appetizer but better yet to ask us what did we order.... really.... we wrote it down for you and handed it to you.... but then tells us that the computer did not print the check to the cooks....Really.....after all was done ...I got to say again the food was wonderful. .. no one's perfect and everyone makes mistakes and yes I will go back there love that place# # # # # # # # # # # #"}
{"text":"Food is still good but service has gone WAY DOWN since my last review. I cannot give 5 stars anymore to this restaurant....not sure what is going on here...last several times I have dined here the service has been AWFUL! Hopefully they fix it soon : /"}
{"text":"Sushi is fantastic!  Mexican roll, love my *** are favorites...service can be slow but it is worth it to get sushi this good!"}
{"text":"The Hamachi kama was just ok, small and dried out. The other dishes for a non-all you can eat were also just ok. We went with a group of friends that chose this place. We prefer authentic Japanese sushi restaurants normally in Las Vegas. Service was great though!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice sushi spot. Korean sushi and a little pricy. Paid over $40 for ice green tea and three decent sushi rolls. Not great of service had to ask for refill and who was my server. Great quality of fish!"}
{"text":"The portions are big! Everything is so flavorful and delicious! The owner is really sweet checked on us. We had Oh My God, that was my favorite!"}
{"text":"I eat too much sushi, and that means I eat it in many places. That means I know what it should cost. Unless you have won the lottery you should probably skip Sushi Loca. It's a menu similar to Sushi Fever with prices higher than on the Strip. 

So here's what we ate: Toro pieces were good sized, but at $17.95 a piece, highway robbery! The Negihama roll had double the rice it needed. The Kiss of Fire roll was swimming in so much spicy vinegar sauce that it made the roll fall apart - and the flavor was just sauce. The Spider roll had lots of the crab salad inside and the fried softshell crab was warm and crunchy. The Alaska roll and Tiger roll were just what was expected. 

Bottom line - average sushi, crazy prices. Service was trying hard, but for these prices the water glasses should not sit empty."}
{"text":"Always friendly and I have been there 6 times and always at the sushi bar so the service is good. Fish very fresh and they aim to please. I usually get the regular sashimi and the pieces are very large and you can tell the fish is very fresh."}
{"text":"So I've been dying to try this place because they have a good looking menu and good reviews... Unfortunately I will never return! 
When our food came to the table the waitress had brought a sauce along with our rolls so I thought is came with it. We had been eating the sauce and the waitress comes back to the table and said \"oh sorry you didn't order this, sorry\" takes it off of our table and I watched her place it on another table.. Are you f*cking kidding me? So UNSANITARY!! I can only imagine what goes on behind the kitchen if they think that doing that is ok! 
Oh and also my \"cooked\" roll came out with raw scallops.. And that's not my thing!"}
{"text":"So, the rice was hard and the fish soggy and the tempura cold. Straddling that line between gross and barely acceptable.

But service is fast...so I guess I value responsiveness."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Sushi Loca (Centennial location) and it was so good! My cousins have recently moved to this side of town so they recommended we go have dinner there. 

We got seated pretty quickly when we got there and the server brought us little bowls of cucumbers with sesame seeds and strips of crab meat on them. Then she took our drink orders. We did not do all you can eat but a la carte. I'm not sure if they have all you can eat but if they do, I'm going back for it! 

We ordered the Jackpot roll, TTL roll (has no rice), California roll, Choi roll (with cucumber instead of rice), Chicken Katsu, and Garlic Edamame. All of it was delicious! 

The Jackpot roll was perfect if you're not a spicy lover and love shrimp. The TTL was also amazing (it's a life changing roll for one of my cousins LOL). It does not have rice so if you're looking to eat healthy and want some spice in your life, it's the one to go with. The California roll was also a good take on a classic roll. The Choi roll was by far my favorite for the night though. If you order it, try the the cucumber instead of the rice! It is so good!!! Also, the Chicken Katsu was delish! I've often tried Katsu that's been dry but this was perfectly moist and the breading was crunchy. Last but not least, the edamame was also very tasty as well.

Overall, I would most definitely come back to this place!!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out last night as I had a free night alone at home. I so enjoyed the quickness of my order and the absolute perfect take out kit .. They left no stone unturned. Thanks for a great sushi dinner at home :) next time I'm having dinner there,"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! Fresh produce and delicious rolls!amazing service and excellent sense of the customer's feelings! I absolutely can't stop eating here! Sushi loca  surely never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Seated promptly..received water quickly after.. then it seemed we were forgotten shortly after. After waiting and flipping through the menu for about 20 minutes while employees walked by us multiple times, making eye contact and everything, we decided to get up and go somewhere else. It wasn't until then that we were acknowledged. And what was said was\"Did you eat?\" Like we were dining and dashing instead of leaving because we were being ignored. Annoying."}
{"text":"My girlfriend is from japan and she probably ate more sushi than the amount of rice i've eaten in my life. Half of the time, she can tell whether the sushi is fresh or not simply by looking at it.

So.....

She was gonna give it a 0 star if it was possible. She wanted some bento box and I wanted some sashimi really bad. We decided not to go to Sushi Koma or Sushi Goyemon, our to go sushi spot, but instead opting to try sushi Loca. 

First of all, this place is Korean perhaps with Japanese owners. This is perfectly fine as Sushi Koma is Korean too. But omg my gf's bento box was horrendously bad. HORRENDOUSLY BAD! It doesn't look/taste/anything like a Japanese bento box. My girlfriend failed to eat even 1/4 of what was in it. It was just  fried chicken with absolutely no taste. 

I had sashimi and nigiri. I would give it about 3 stars. Rice was definitely not to the standard of a good sushi spot. What's more crazy is my girlfriend thinks their tuna isn't really tuna. It tasted funny to me but I thought it was, we leave that to you to make the call. One thing though, I am a master scallop dude, their scallop was not fresh, period! Dried and tasteless.

I probably not gonna go back again. I rather drive 30 minutes to go to sushi Koma for fresher better sushi."}
{"text":"Been going to Sushi Loca for Years! Wouldve said that its the best if not one of the best Sushi places in Vegas however tonight it was sad. Ok if i go to a pay per roll place Id better get a decent sized roll with fish in it. What we were just served was a ball of rice covered in sauce that paled in comparison to an all you can eat roll. When we made mention to the chef that there was no crab in a roll thats supposed to have it, he made an excuse that there was just a little bit so the could roll it. I looked at him like really this is one skimpy roll thats just pathetic. We asked for a little crab on the side to compensate and he refused... Check please! We are gone. Go to Sushi Burrito places like Poke or Ja Burrito like we are from now on, sure theres a different environment but at least you get fish and some rice, not the other way around."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love the Centennial location but this one is not up to par. We got our drink order in and didn't see the waited for at least 10 min. When the food came the Jackpot roll was good, Tiger roll was very bland and dry, had to add spicy mayo to it to make it taste better, creamy scallop roll was totally raw and gummy, sent it back. When I asked to send the roll back   for not being specific in being raw I had to ask my waiter, another server, and the manager and had to fully explain why I wanted to send it back. Because it was gross. That's why. Next time just care for the customer and make fresher tasting food next time."}
{"text":"Had a blast here! Great food and great sushi chef's! Was very busy Friday evening, but well worth the wait. We will be back for more."}
{"text":"This place has the WORST service! Went to dinner and sat for 15 mins for our order to be taken. Never came around to ask how we were doing, No refills on drinks, wanted to order more but no one came by to ask if we wanted anything else, ordered food that NEVER came and then charged us for it!!!!! Ask for a Manager when paying and they Manager didn't even apologize for what just happened. I left NO tip which I usually don't do but it was that BAD!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We just got take out and we were very disappointed with the quality and taste of our rolls and edema me that tasted very very old. 5 different roll and none of them were good. We are a family that loves sushi  and when there are left overs you know something is wrong. Northwest Vegas sushi restraunts have all went downhill from a few years ago."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Who's you're Daddy and No Pain No Gain are the best,  the chefs are incredible!"}
{"text":"I'd give it a zero if it were an option. First time I went was a few months ago while visiting family in Summerlin and the service was terrible from the moment we walked in. Although we were seated right away we must've waited about 15 minutes just to order our drinks. The server kept forgetting about us and never brought us refills after I asked 2 times. The food took longer than any other place I've been to to arrive and they even forgot to bring my neices's kids meal and they brought it right before we left only because we had to remind them twice to bring it and by the time it arrived the rest of us had already finished eating. You're probably thinking it was a crowded night but it wasn't at all. I believe there were only about 3 tables being served so I have no idea why they took so long or how they can possibly forget a family of four. I would definitely never go back nor would I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"$36 for 2 people. Beek Yakosoba (sp?) and 3 rolls. YUMMM I didn't sit at the sushi bar so I didnt get the full experiemce but the food was good, and Id probably go back."}
{"text":"New place in Summerlin Center that we really enjoyed. We had 3 of their specialty rolls; I did your girlfriend, no pain no gain and heart attack...wow to all three. Really unique and flavorful. No pain no gain was my fav. We will return."}
{"text":"Average at best.  Expensive compared to alternatives.  I think we spent $50 on lunch.  Menu is full of all sorts of sexual references that are not appropriate.  Service was slow.  The lunch menu is very limited.  The quality of the fish was below what I am used to getting.  Presentation was sloppy."}
{"text":"Okay..I will try to be fair here with Sushi Loca.  Keep in mind, 3 stars doesn't mean that this place is horrible.  It just means Sushi Loca was just okay.

Let's start with the restaurant and service.  This is one of the bigger sushi restaurants that you'll find out here. I dig the decor, colors, and huge sushi bar.  As for service, they strive at this as well.  I had zero issue with their service and ambiance. Good start so far. 

Now for what's important, the food.  I didn't try their $9.95 two-item lunch special, but this seemed to be the trend for every one else that was eating here.  By the looks of what people were eating, looks like a great deal with huge portions. 

I chose their fish only dishes which were their;

-Yellow Tail and Salmon Sashimi:  Probably the highlight of my lunch. Fresh, not fishy, and thick slices of fishes.  Some people like their shashimi thinly cut, but it doesn't matter to me as long as it's tasty and fresh.  Sushi Loca got this right.

-Spicy Tuna and Salmon Skin Hand Roll:  Compared to other sushi spots, these hand rolls are a lot bigger.  Regarding taste, I've had better.  

-Taste Like My X-Girlfriend:  This is one of their Extraordinary Rolls (aka Yum Yum Rolls).  Regarding the name, which girlfriend are they talking about?  No but seriously, their Extraordinary Rolls had names like \"Love My Ass\", \"I Did Your Girlfriend\", \"Taste Like My X-Girlfriend\" and \"Sex on the Beach\".  The names are amusing, but not the type of menu that you give to your young kids to read.  I will dabble in a few Western Rolls every once in a while.  I only did it here because I was just curious.  The \"Taste Like My X-Girlfriend\" consist of shrimp tempura, crab, scallops, spicy tuna, and all of this was covered with their crunch sauce. I didn't think it was bad.  It just had too much going on.  If I get this next time, I will probably tell them to cut the crunch sauce and mayo. 

The food here isn't bad depending what you get. I'm not a fan of the rolls I got, but loved their shashimi.  But because this place lacked AYCE, I had to spend all I can spend.  Overall, nothing really special here at Sushi Loca. I spent close to $50 for the same quality that I could have gotten at Yummy, I-Naba, and Kazien at half the price."}
{"text":"I just ordered  Beef soba ramen and your chicken soba ramen for take out. I'm just going to say how bland your broth is and almost near flavorless.  If Gordon Ramsey was to put a comment regarding the broth and the consistency,  that would be a very interesting review.  I mean, why would you leave the noodles to sit in the broth and get all mushy and soft??   

Will I come here again?  Maybe... but I wouldn't order the same bland tasting broth that should have more flavor and consistency of what a real Japanese Ramen broth should taste like.   Then again, I dont think Japanese Ramen is  your specialty."}
{"text":"The only reason they got two stars is because the sushi is pretty good. The service on the other hand, is horrible. This is the second time we've got stuck with a waitress with no personality. The restaurant was empty and the server seemed to take her time with everything. The main reason for the review is her response to my daughter getting sick while we were there. My daughter had a runny nose so I took her to the bathroom to get cleaned up. On her way, she threw up on the floor outside of the bathroom. She wasn't sick prior to dinner or we wouldn't of went out to eat. My husband got up to help her out while I waited for the waitress so I could inform her of what happened and ask for our food to go. Once I told and showed her where she threw up her response was, \"Oh\", and then walked away. No one made an attempt to clean it or provide us with the necessary items so we could clean it. She never came back to our table so we had to talk to the cashier at the front. That is completely unsanitary that no one made an attempt to clean it up. My husband wiped up what he could, but again, no one sanitized the area. I'm pretty sure that is a health violation."}
{"text":"Love this place. The sushi is amazing. Great quality and delicious rolls. The service is great too. If you are looking for great quality sushi this is the place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice already and it's always bad baaad service! The food is mediocre at best. I took a break from my regular Yama Sushi binge and decided to give sushi loca another try after shopping around downtown summerlin. 
What a big mistake! We were seated promptly but the service after that was a tad bit slow. There were only 2 other tables and they took atleast 10mins to get our drink orders and then another 10 to get our food orders. I work in the service industry and I understand that people get busy but you have 2 tables! And adequately staffed. What kind of service is that?
Don't even get me started on the sushi. They were all warm?? I got some smoked salmon and they tasted so off! I had to force myself to finish it despite only having 4 pieces. How do you even mess up smoked salmon?? Idk. My sister went for the lunchbox combo and it wasn't as bad as the sushi but the beef teriyaki was a little tough, Gyoza was gross, and the rice was a little hard. The only saving grace from this place is the miso soup. No wonder it's never busy here! This place is awful. Never coming back again. I'll stick with my Yama Sushi or the Sushi Loca in centennial."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Service was horrible even though there were hardly any patrons in yet. Sushi was not fresh. Rolls were sloppy and had far too much rice. I will not be back here."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is running the way it is. I came in here first timer and the waiter lady that we had was extremely rude she never welcomed us. Service was extremely slow not once did she come and check up after we would get our food we had to keep calling her and we accidentally ordered a wrong item and she gave a nasty attitude and said \"don't do it again because I will not change it\" even though she didn't even walk to the computer we had told her right after she took the order and second there's no need for the attitude when you didn't get hired to act like a snob. Sushi was overly priced here and doesn't even compare as far as taste with other AYCE places. I also asked where the manager was to this other waitress and she look confused she couldn't understand me and I told her that I didn't like the service and all she said was \"oh sorry\" and walked away. Honestly what a joke this place is not worth it. Will never be back again that's for sure."}
{"text":"Overpriced for small portions. Don't get me wrong though the atmosphere of the place was very nice and modern. But I think I could've got a little more BANG FOR MY BUCK!! I would only go back here if someone else was paying. Sushi was good overall."}
{"text":"The food is missing something. All three rolls we ordered were made pretty sloppy, falling apart as it was presented to us. The spicy tuna was not spicy :/ The service is quick and the restaurant clean. We wouldn't be likely to return."}
{"text":"WTF!! I ordered a single roll to go. I opened the container. I have never seen such a small roll in my life. There wasn't enough rice. It was soggy. $12 for one roll - a rip off. I am Japanese I will pay any amount for good sushi. This wasn't even worth $0.50.. no way the chef was actually trained well. I can make sushi better than that."}
{"text":"One thing I love about Sushi Loca, is the size of their rolls. Ive been to many many sushi places around the Las Vegas valley and some rolls are just dinky. I like the various ingredients and taste difference in all their rolls. The decorating is fabulous and the atmosphere is even better. We have went there many times, and there has been a few times our order has gotten messed up and they were more than happy to fix the problem, let us keep what they gave to us by mistake, and not charge us for any of it. I would definitely recommend them to everyone. The only dislike I have is that they don't have a happy hour what so ever. There is another sushi place we go to regularly due to their half price menu on Friday and Saturday nights. I would hope that Sushi Loca will consider adding a happy hour."}
{"text":"Loved the Japanese ramen soup. Be sure to ask for sriracha. It's better spicy. Japanese lasagna is a must try"}
{"text":"With not many Japanese options over here in the Centennial area - Sushi Loca is my savior. They have great deals on their lunch specials- for a little over $8.00 you get rice, salad, miso soup, gyoza, and 2 choices of either chicken karage, chicken,beef or salmon teriyaki, shrimp or veggie tempura or pork\chicken katsu. I like the salad dressing here- it's like an orange ginger citrus dressing- Yummy!!!
A real positive is that the chicken katsu is made with chicken breast- I just wish the chicken karage was made using chicken breast as well....
Last night the BF and I decided to try some sushi rolls-
Taste like my ex-girlfriend, Jackpot and Japanese Lasagna #2 -
All were yummy and filling....
The Japanese Lasagna #2 was only different from a regular Japanese Lasagna roll because they added scallops under all the gooey ooey eel sauce and cream cheese- Yeah Boy!!!!! Good Stuff!!!

***So, here's a little tid bit for parents of kids who are of reading age  - pretty much all the rolls listed on the menu and the t-shirts of the sushi chefs all say phrases that leave kid's asking \"Why does it say that?\" So, be ready to honestly explain or pretty much lie - you're the parent , it's up tp you. But, they will ask!!!***

I like the decor in here - it's trendy but still comfortable.
Thank Heavens Sushi Loca is near my work or I don't know what I would do...."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Wasn't as expensive as I thought it might be and the service was quick and attentive! Every order was right, and my drink was never empty! Plus the atmosphere was pretty laid back. Would definitely recommend this place to all my friends and family! Stop in and try the salmon skin roll!"}
{"text":"Glad I tried but I won't be going back for more. I ordered a California roll and a Tiger roll but was not impressed by either. They were just so-so. Was hoping to love it as it is so easy to order online for pick up."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from this location. It was toward the end of the evening and they were wrapping up food. The sushi chef had a wonderful personality, but the salmon he served was not fresh. Be cautious when eating here. They also did not provide soy sauce."}
{"text":"It's okay here, but not tops on my list, in large part for service!!  I've been here 3 times since they've open and all 3 times have had awful service.  The last time we were there, there were 5 of us and the waitress ignored us more than she acknowledged us and when I finally flagged her down to order more rolls, she kept walking, turned her head back and said, \"one moment\".  And we waited . . . 

The food is average, nothing wonderful. Their shrimp tempura roll is awful - too much rice and too much flakes, shrimp is buried inside.  Their nigiri sushi is okay, it's hit and miss, the yellowfin was chewy, but the albacore was great.  

I wanted to love it, it's soooo conveniently located for us, but I just can't.  I love great service and this is was one of the times I left less than a 10% tip (I can count them on one hand!).  We won't be back, at least not for a long time or if I have any say, there are too many great sushi places in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Mexican sushi roll was Amazing 
My boyfriend and I loved it.
The only thing that wasn't good as I thought would be was the service, server had us waiting awhile."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times, great place with really nice decor. The sushi we've had has always been fresh and well done. Great names for the rolls too. One side note, we have used this place twice to cater large parties with take out and they really do a nice job."}
{"text":"This is a very nice, clean and friendly place the food was good and prices reasonable. When  I'm come back to Las Vegas I plan to eat here again ."}
{"text":"Amazing food but i felt like i am in a nightclub, only house music every time i come here , the music should match  the environment 
I hope they change it 
Sushi is great and i really want to continue coming back"}
{"text":"very yummy sushi place! great portions for the price you're given. definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This is the closest sushi place to my house and it is not good. Iv'e given it about three tries, each time there is a issue with service and the fish just isn't good. I drive down to my old stomping grounds near Sahara to Sushi Fever when I want decent sushi."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here. I love the sushi, service and and the relaxed atmosphere. 
 Ive been here several times the last few years and every visit has been a good experience.
 I especially like that its more of a party type atmosphere then a quiet boring standard dinner joint! Eating here is like an event rather than eat dinner and go home type of place! 
  Cant wait until my next visit!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here on two different occasions.  The first one the staff were very polite and attentive.  Great service.  We went this past Friday and didn't have a reservation and waited a little bit which we were fine with.  They seated us pretty quickly even though it was busy.  The hostess seated us and didn't give us menus.  When the server came and asked us what we wanted to eat we had mentioned that we never received menus and she looked irritated, we thought she was coming to give us menus.  We picked our items pretty quick and she came back about 10 minutes later to take our order.  Once the food came no one ever came back to see if we wanted more sushi rolls, water, tea, coffee, absolutely nothing.  So we gave up and decided that we would just ask for the check.  Good luck with that.  I finally got up to walk to the front stand to request my check when the server stopped me and asked what I needed (she noticed that the rest of my party had left and I'm sure assumed I was walking out as well).  I told her that I had been waiting and waiting for someone to come by so I could get my check.  I think she could see that I was beyond irritated.  So she brought back the check and stood over my shoulder and ensured me that the drinks were one the house for the slow service (we had 3 waters and 1 ice tea so it wasn't that big of a deal that the drinks were on the house).  I paid the bill and left.  I have no plans on going back, which is too bad because the food is really good.  But, it only takes one trip of bad service for me to not go back."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi nor service compared to other places in Las Vegas. If you're looking to get a taste of sushi I recommend the lunch plate. It subdued my craving and is one of the more reasonably priced items on the menu. Not overwhelmingly delicious but it did the trick until going to an AYCE place and REALLY fulfilling the sushi craving."}
{"text":"Not a fan. 

They were quick to seat us. There is no hostess, but the servers direct you to your seating. She pointed at the booth down the way; did not guide us to our seating. We sat in a deep, comfy booth that could easily accommodate six fatties. 

On a Wednesday afternoon, my party of two was one of about four or five other parties present. Two servers, two sushi chefs, and some back of the house kitchen employees. 

Large sushi bar, seats about 18. 

The restaurant/ sushi bar takes up two units. It's a large beautiful space with soaring ceilings, nice decor, kept clean. The hanging pictures are tilted, but whatev. 

I ordered the \"No Pain No Gain\" roll (~14). Being that it is a Korean-manned sushi joint, more than half of the sushi rolls with have some spice element. If there's tuna, it will prolly be spicy tuna. If there's soft shel crab, it will prolly be spicy soft shell crab. The No Pain No Gain roll is one of them heart attack meals: spicy soft shell crab and cucumber, wrapped with tuna and slathered with scallops, krab, and spicy mayo, all then run through the baker device and served with a generous serving of some mystery spicy raayu (spicy oil) with mayo, green onions, and ponzu maybe?). But it was hardly spicy. I felt as though there was neither pain, nor gain. 

I also got a yellowtail collar (~$12?), which was beautifully cooked -- not over cooked, not at all dry -- served with a large portion of ponzu. 

The other person in my party got a California roll and one of those combo meals where you pick two items, also comes with miso soup, rice, and a salad. She picked teriyaki beef (nothing wrong there) and chicken karage (sic), which was near tasteless. 

The above listed items plus a mochi ice cream (2 pcs) came out to $44 before tip. 

The servers wear kimono-esque outfits. If you're a kimono/ yukata person, don't look directly at their outfits. Your eyes might sting a little (arm pit seams ripped out, poor excuse for obi, etc). But who cares, right? We don't eat yukata. 

The house plays club dance music. I didn't think it was too loud (previous reviews from other Yelpers indicate the contrary). 

The food was fine, but one of the two servers was just awful. The service killed the experience. She dropped food off with out a word, asked how everything was and walked away while we were responding. Then at the end of our meal, there was not a server in sight for a good seven minutes. 

They are open late (til 2a most nights?).

{"text":"Been coming to Sushi Loca for years! This place is amazing!, the spicy tuna sashimi is the best with extra masago!! Definitely recommend coming here!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I enjoyed a nice, casual lunch, and found the food to be tasty and well worth the price paid. 

I had a sashimi salad with three types of fish over a bed of romaine lettuce, and had the miso soup that came with the \"Lunch Box\" that my friend ordered. Both were tasty, and all of the components of the salad were fresh and crisp. 

The \"Lunch Box\" special was a great value, coming with two entrees (my friend chose vegetable tempura and beef teriyaki, both of which were offered in a generous portion), a salad, two gyoza, rice, and the miso soup that I ate. 

Again, all of the food that we ordered was tasty and well-prepared, and we will definitely return in the future for lunch and/or dinner."}
{"text":"My second favorite Sushi place in all of Las Vegas....My husband loves the Japanese Hamburger dish, and I have yet to find a Sushi Roll I do not like."}
{"text":"This place is bomb!! Idk why everyone is complaining! The atmosphere is nice and dim, good for a date night and techno music. Its a bit pricey but the portions are HUGE. I got whos your daddy\", burning sensation, heart attack and Japanese Lasagna!! It was delicious and the orders came within 5 min!! And the tempura cheesecake tho. Wow!  I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is a rip off of I Love Sushi in Henderson and Nobu, except not as good. It copied I Love Sushi's restaurant layout, the boxes people get to write on, the menu, the outfits the servers wear... If you think this place is good, try I Love Sushi instead. It's across town though, so that's probably why they can get away with it. The food was okay. I tried the fat ass, and it's not as good as the reviews I read. We ordered the fat ass and I Did Your Girlfriend, which fell apart too easily. The place was also completely dead. There were maybe two other parties in the restaurant with us."}
{"text":"I love me some sushi and since moving to Las Vegas, a few years ago, I have tried a few local places,  all very good but this place is my new favorit. Atmosphere was cute, staff was friendly and helpful, best of all the food was amazing.  Great flavors and the fish was fresh and tasty.  Best roll of the night, for me, was the Loca Special."}
{"text":"Sushi Loca is Awesome, me and the wife go there all the time! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"We've been coming to this spot atleast once a week for the past year.  We came in last night and had dinner.  2hrs after we got home i became violently sick throwing up w stomach pains which has lasted into this morning.  I knew my roll seemed a lil off but was hungry and didnt want to wait.  Big mistake.  Food poisoning at its finest and my whole body is paying for it today."}
{"text":"The rice is mushy and the service is awful. The taste is borderline unbearable. Just eat somewhere else if you want something you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"All time favorite family favorite Sushi! Our three favorites, Kiss of Fire, Loca Special, Put Your Hands Up. I am very picky about the freshness of my fish and I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place!! I'm very picky with where I eat sushi at because I am so afraid of getting sick and not ever wanting to eat sushi again lol. Love that they are usually open until 2AM especially in this area. I've only had 2 bad experiences in the last few years I've been going here. None that were major really. The TTL is by far the best especially the sauce it comes with! I LOVE spicy food so the kiss of fire is a fave of mine also. The jackpot, jimmy special, XXX, Screaming Orgasm and Tuna poke are also great choices. The service is decent they are always friendly and accommodating. A little slow at times and sometimes you have to ask a few times for certain things but the servers are never rude and the chefs almost always greet you when you walk in."}
{"text":"50-50 unless Lee is your sushi chef. Lee serves it up fantastic only 3 days a week. The others, especially in the front door corner sushi bar offer inattentive paper thin scraps with attitude. Since Loca is local I have gambled here too long. I think I must be the only one to tell the staff \"the bathroom soap is empty\" every time i use there bathroom. Bottom line; so many sushi bars so little time. Check out Eric @ Yummy on Lake Mead and John @ SoHo on Jones for some well deserved excellence. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi! Every time I've been here the food is fresh and delicious. Would definitely recommend to family and friends :)"}
{"text":"Avoid it for lunch. I was excited to try this place because I know a lot of people who like it, but it's super expensive ($14 for lunch combo of miso soup, 4 pieces of sushi, and a spicy tuna roll), and the sushi was not good/fresh at all. Also, they don't tell you that there is a $20 minimum card transaction until the very end. This is a modern restaurant in \"Downtown Summerlin.\" Not even my Chinatown places have a $20 card minimum!!! Luckily I have cash. Very disappointing and stupid!"}
{"text":"Im a sushi snob. I have worked on equipment on long line boats in Hawaii and have traveled through Japan. I have tried probably the best of the best for raw fish. I am a purist, and focus on the core of sushi, the quality of the fish. I feel like fancy rolls are like ordering hamburgers at a steak house. Sushi Loca's fish is pretty damn good. Their Nigiri, rectangular fish and rice, is top notch. They also had Japanese sides I did not expect to find outside of a Japanese hub. Shiso, fresh wasabi (packaged but the real stuff), daikon, and Orion beer (Okinawan). Also their Toro was delicious. As good as Ive had in Tokyo. Served with the special care that Toro deserves. Service is great. It has become my go to place for my sushi fix."}
{"text":"The menu was pretty standard and bland.

I do believe that they charge \"extra\" for their sushi rolls because they gave them all \"inappropriate and distasteful\" names. The sushi rolls are not unique. I was not wow-Ed.

The decor and atmosphere is very nice.  It is date night worthy if you're not looking for food that is beyond average."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly and our hostess was very friendly. I wanted to love this place based on other yelpers reviews, however, I want to say YOU LIED!!! This place was meh when it came to the atmosphere and the rolls weren't very tasty. I honestly gagged after eating about 4 rolls. As of that moment, I was done. If you must have sushi and nearby, I see as to why you would want to go. For me, however, never again. :("}
{"text":"The service for a not too busy Wednesday night was hand down horrible... I could have done better myself in a bad mood! And I have never stepped foot in the place. My daughters 13th birthday might as well have been a burden to the server... no smile , nothing , not even a mention, even though we let the hostess and server know. They were both rude as could be from the start, before the birthday mention. I felt like I was in the twilight zone! Won't go there again !! Food was overpriced and not even good.. wouldn't go back if you paid for it. Sorry, we wanted to love it. If you like mediocre food, high price and rude , very rude service this place is your spot."}
{"text":"This is one of my top sushi places.  Once you go in they have good loud music and the waiters are so friendly.  The portions here are big.  The first time we came here we got 4 rolls and an appetizer and we could not eat it all.  Now that we are practically locals here we love to come after 11 they have late night happy hour, we get a large tuna poke ( which is in their happy our menu regularly it is like 14 dollars but after 11 it is 9 dollars) and we get house sake and beer this is also in their happy hour (buy one get one sake and beer).  My favorite rolls are the Loca special, I did your girl friend roll and the hot mess roll."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi restaurants in Vegas.  Love my fat ass, who's your daddy & who's your ex wife!"}
{"text":"This place is delish!!! My husband and I have our favorite sushi-mon...Ricardo...awesome!!!"}
{"text":"AHhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I just left Sushi Loca. 

So good. So. Good. Prices are pretty good. Food is great. I made up a roll and they were like- \"sure...okay\". I had the strawberry mochi (sp?) and I've never had it before. I'm pretty sure I'm obsessed now. I like the atmosphere- music is a tad loud but that's okay since the tracks are good. Service is pretty good- a different person every time so I never knew who to ask for something in particular but you could always find a waitress. So it was pretty good. The menu has a vast array of options and the names are ridiculous. I love my ass? That was seriously the name of one of the dishes. Wtf?!

Kind of out of the way and I wouldn't have known about it without my friend who is from LV and lives near there. But it's a nice place in town.

I would definitely go here again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place great sushi, great atmosphere and even better service! Sashimi always on point!"}
{"text":"My friend and I always stop here over the last couple years to satisfy our sushi cravings, and they never disappoint us. The sushi and appetizers are consistently great and we always have a good time. The atmosphere is fun and energetic. My favorite roll has to be No Pain No Gain! My only complaint is that there is not an all you can eat option on the menu!"}
{"text":"Been coming to Sushi Loca for over a year, average 3 times a month, spend $80-$100 bucks each time. Sushi is great, I'll give them that.... But service has been going down hill for last couple of months.
On our last visit, maybe only three tables were occupied and even then, service was bad. Drinks came almost when we were done eating. 
Waitress didn't even give us plates.
Even felt a little discriminated by staff.
Very disappointing to see a place that I really enjoyed coming to eat with my husband, not want us to come back in the future."}
{"text":"THIS IS the  go - to  Sushi place IN Las Vegas.  Love their sushi names and prizes. Better yet, it's open until 2am everyday."}
{"text":"I was kind of excited when I found out that sushi loca was coming to downtown summerlin. As always I enjoyed their creative sushi rolls. You cannot go wrong with any of their exceptional rolls. Unfortunately, they do not have all you can eat options which makes this place a bit pricey. Each exceptional roll is between $12-$16 dollars which could add up pretty fast. If you like sushi on the spicy side I would recommend the 3 hr non stop. The decor and atmosphere are very nice and modern. The service is also good, fast and very efficient. Overall, I would recommend  this sushi in the summerlin area."}
{"text":"This is our number 1 local spot to go to for sushi. We are there at least every other week. Great quality and reasonable prices. We normally sit right at the bar and watch the guys do their work. They are very friendly and if you ask, they will make recommendations. Some of the specialty rolls on the menu are worth a try. Look the list over and try something that interests you. We love the caterpillar roll ourselves."}
{"text":"My original review was intended for their Downtown Summerlin location."}
{"text":"I would put 5 stars but I can't stand the two waitress that's there they rush you never a kind welcome back type of ladies... The one  younger girl always wanna charge extra for sauce on the side. I only come here because of the sushi chefs make great tasting sushi..... That's why I sit at the sushi bar.."}
{"text":"The large Spicy Salmon was amazing!!! The owner is super friendly and the food was delicious. So happy this is in Downtown Summerlin-this will be our go to spot for food. Great sizes for the sashimi, and the presentation is beautiful. The whole staff overall was helpful and nice-such a great experience!! Having never been to the Centennial location-this was a great find. Will for sure be back!!"}
{"text":"We were making a long drive from Reno through Vegas to Phoenix. A fourteen hour drive (just in case you were curious). We got to Vegas just about in dinner time and wanted something light, fresh, fun, and laid back to gear us up for the next leg. We found Sushi Loca in our hunt and got exactly what we were looking for. 

The cuts of fish were nice and think in both the tuna rolls and the Philadelphia roll. We didn't try any of the signature rolls, but they had some really awesome names and I would give them a go next time we are in town. 

We also shared the Tempura dinner - really great. Not too greasy, nice crisp and again - fresh. 

I appreciated the caliber of food with the really relaxed environment. Specially in Vegas which seems to be full of over priced and over dressed restaurants."}
{"text":"This is always one of our favorites. We love the Holy Cow roll. Sit at the sushi bar and buy saki bombs for the crew and the free samples begin to flow!"}
{"text":"On our recent one day trip to las vegas we decided to have dinner at this place since we were residing far from the strip blvrd. The menu was very interesting and very confusing, So I let the other order. My favorite was pieces of salmon, and the one with the quail egg.
In general the service was really good, super friendly and very fast. Fish was very fresh."}
{"text":"We sat up at the sushi bar. Our Sushi Chef did an amazing job. He answered my questions and made awesome suggestions for my sushi experience. Very clean,  and the staff were very quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Once again so deliciously and freshly prepared! Love the Ika Yaki grilled calamari and topped it of with the fried cheesecake! Tried the yellowtail collar too! Yum!"}
{"text":"My favorite Sushi in Las Vegas! The service can't be beat, the fish is high quality, and best atmosphere in town! Julie and her staff are the best!"}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and wanted sushi and I went to Yelp to see what was in the area. This had 5 stars and was close. So we went.

It's in a massive WalMart lot but it's pretty easy to see. The interior is nice, they have large velvet booths, they have tables and you can also sit at the sushi counter. We had many different servers and I was a little confused as to who was really in charge of our order. Nothing bad happened, I was just confused. I think that all of the waiters/bussers hit every table and maybe at the end of the night they split the tips? I don't know, but we had 4 people give us our drinks and food.

All of the sushi names are raunchy and sexy. It was fun. The food came so fast I felt like I was in a drive-thru but it was fresh and delicious so I wasn't complaining!

Will definitely come back.

Oh yeah, don't you hate it when you go into a sushi restaurant and it is adequate to good, and you're thinking to yourself that it is a nice little place and then you go to the restroom and it's down this long, dingy hallway and you have to walk by the kitchen and see the employees and the bathroom itself is cheap and dirty?

Well this is not like that at all!!!! I love sushi restaurants, all restaurants for that matter, that actually care about their bathrooms. Thank you for having a clean hallway and a hallway that doesn't pass by an open kitchen. Thank you for having a stylish and clean bathroom with more than one toilet.
                   (It's the little things that make me happy)"}
{"text":"Date night here was PERFECT! Staff was friendly and attentive! the food was DELICIOUS and FRESH!! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We really love this place, everytime we have visitors we take them here.  

Great food and service 

Checkout they're menu names.  Jackpot, megabucks just to name a few."}
{"text":"We are eating in Sushi Loca, Centennial location, once almost every week in the past two years. 
We love sushi here! It's one of my favorite place.
Despite the fact that this location is so far away from my house, we still take the time to drive here.
Service is excellent here!
Everyone makes sure the customers feel welcomed!All servers smile all the time, and they are very attentive!

At lunch time, besides the regular menu items, you can choose between two different lunch specials, for around $10-$12 each. Both including miso soup, salad, a variety of entrees, sushi and rice.
It's very fulfilling!

My favorite items from the menu:
Oh My God ! - inside - crab, avocado, cucumber/ outside- cooked shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, mochi (rice cake), smelt eggs.
Very flavorful, tasty!
Crazy Horse - smoked salmon, cream cheese, avocado, green onions with eel sauce.
Melting in my mouth ... yummy!
Final Fantasy 2 - inside- spicy soft shell crab, shrimp tempura, cucumber/ outside- spicy soft shell crab, assorted fish, avocado and spicy mayo ponzu sauce.
Very fresh tasting ingredients in every rolls!
Double Down- inside -spicy soft shell crab, spicy tuna, spicy crab, cucumber/ outside-spicy soft shell crab, spicy tuna, spicy crab, salmon, yellowtail with sesame mustard sauce.
The spices and the fish all together just a great harmony of flavors!

68 and I owe you one!
Taste like my Ex-girlfriend!
And many other amazing rolls ... I like them all!

Also, I love their Green Tea mochi, and my absolutely favorite one is the Mango mochi!

Happy to return anytime!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Downtown Summerlin location only! First couple times we were very disappointed, because the other location in North Las Vegas is very good, and we were excepting the same quality of food and service! Unfortunately, can not say I am happy! Sushi is mediocre. Service is terrible.
We had same waitress twice in a row! She was so rude, I said it loud \"I would like another waitress\".
Miracles happened, because we got served by someone else! She was absolutely nice!
Otherwise service is very slow, even when place is not busy. Few times it happened they forgot to bring the food to one of us. Everyone got served and eating, and one person still waiting for food.
Awkward!!! Asking servers to please check the order, then warm food being served cold, meaning they've been forgotten about it!
Menu selections are huge. Very entertaining to read the items being named! 
This location would be more convenient for us, but we really prefer the other one even if it is very far from us!"}
{"text":"Meh... Came here because we were starving after shopping ... Sushi was good, ramen was so so... but service was sa sa sloooowwwww.... Took forever to get the check, or anything else that we needed. However, they were really quick to pick it up. Won't be back, I'll stick with the all you can eat at jjenga or Yama sushi."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. Super perfect! I will return here for sure. The only thing that bothered me was the servicers didn't pay any attention to us once we ordered. Other than that it was cool!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, great chefs and staff!The sushi here is incredibly fresh, clean and tasty! They use a good ratio of fish to rice for sushi, and the sashimi is amazing. i haven't been here for a while but thinks it deserves a good review lol! 

I only wish they offered all you can eat sushi. I would be willing to pay $25-30 for sushi here if it were allyou can eat."}
{"text":"I've only had the pleasure to eat here just once.  Now that I have that out of the way, here goes nothing.   I ordered Hitachi Steak, Chicken Fried Rice, and the Heart Attack Rolls.  The Hibachi Steak was nothing short of perfect.  The Ribeye steak was cooked to medium perfection, and was tender and full of beefy, fatty, goodness.  The Chicken fried rice was good, but lacked chicken meat.  I've had better elsewhere.  The Heart Attack rolls were good, and we are them all with the quickness, but I think I want spicy rolls next time I visit.  All in all, this place is good, and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My favorite!!  The atmosphere and employees are only shadowed by the great food!  Wish I could go every week."}
{"text":"best sushi place ever!!! the Japanese lasagne is amazing, the vegetable fried rice is to die for & chicken hibachi is my fav....my family and I always eat here!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this sushi place and I was actually surprised that it only has a 3 star rating. My usual sushi spot is JJANGA on either fort apache and sunset or twain and decatur where I go for all you can eat sushi. 

I generally can eat A LOT so when I only had 2 rolls here and couldn't even finish the two I was pretty amazed. Maybe I was a little off on my sushi game that day but the rolls tasted great and fresh and had a lot of fish in them! This place didn't skimp on their ingredients. 

The rolls were a bit pricey considering they did not have an all you can eat option.

It was not busy at all when my party and I went and our service was very attentive. I will definitely have to take another stop here!"}
{"text":"Nice and quiet place. The sushi was really good. Staff was very friendly. I recommend the Crazy Horse. My husband tried sushi for the first time and liked it. Best vegetable fried rice... EVER! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Las Vegas!! Been a faithful customer for years and will continue to enjoy this fresh awesome quality sushi!!"}
{"text":"Solid spot for your sushi cravings. Hands down the best spicy garlic edamame I have ever had. Classic rolls and specialty rolls are great. But, they also have great cooked dishes too like salmon and hamachi Kama, baked mussels, and any choice of Ramen is great. They even serve sesame oil and shichimi on the side to season as you like. Service staff is always polite and this place always seems busy so they've gotta be doing something right. Right? Right."}
{"text":"Like many reviews have stated before, the food is AMAZING. What ruins it are the servers. They're timid and/or unfriendly and clearly disinterested in serving. I'll come back but I will probably sit at the sushi bar instead of a table."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and held off reviewing until this, my third try.  It's very close to home and was hoping it would be good...it's not.  Hands down the worst garlic edamame I've ever had.  It is served slightly warmed with a garlic paste slathered all over it.  Not tasty.  I had a couple rolls - I love my ass and hot night...both virtually devoid of flavor - I'm not sure how you accomplish that with sushi.  3 tries is enough.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Well we went and tried it and not my favorite. I've been to many places in Las Vegas for sushi and this one did not hit its mark. Two things high prices that are not justified and service was so so. Never brought our edamame we ordered and put it on the bill. Rolls were extremely generic. Fake caterpillar roll had no flavor along with sex on the beach which tasted like rice vinegar that overpowered the whole roll. Salmon sashimi was not cut correctly, it was cut like the crab sticks which detracted from its presentation and flavor. Burning sensation roll with soft shell crab, avo, and tuna was swimming in a garlic ponzu and for some reason here was a heaping mound of rice on my plate. Overall not impressed and won't be back. Many other sushi places to try in Vegas for better food and service."}
{"text":"My favorite place for sushi in las vegas. The no pain no gain roll is my favorite. Sitting the sushi bar is a must to get the full experience. I highly recmomdned sush local to all my friends."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. But the hours should be fixed. They are actually open until 2am, not pm. I almost missed out on another glorious yet fishy meal of the gods because of this mistake."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Rude waitress. Slow service. This server dropped off a drink we didn't order, just dropped it off and walked away to chat with her coworkers. When I got my food, vegetable tempura was not thoroughly cooked, it was still pasty inside. Told a server about it, no apology she just grabbed the bento box and walked off. After waiting another 15 minutes, she dropped off my food, taste was a lot better. But she barely checked on us afterwards. I asked for a sauce when I finally got their attention and didn't let me know of extra charges that comes along with it until I saw the bill. Now I'm a server myself so I know how things are when it gets busy. But it wasn't busy. There were two servers handling maybe 6 tables. And they can't even make customer service a priority? Ridiculous. The food was alright but very overshadowed with horrible service.

They need to either be re-trained or let go."}
{"text":"The service was friendly, though slow. The ambiance and decor was fabulous. It was spacious and clean and had a lot going for it. The food was just meh. 

Beware the evil soy sauce pot. It drools. It dribbles. It pees in your lap. I HATE this thing enough that even if I loved the food and service, it would keep me away. I am not a messy eater, but this thing destroyed my plate, my table, and my pants."}
{"text":"After a long day of shopping at dts, hubby wanted to eat some sushi. Luckily we found this hidden gem! I did not expect it to be so nice! The interior design is amazing, I fell in love  we got seated right away, which was awesome because we were starving. SUAH  was our server, she was great! Everybody was very friendly and helpful! So let's get to the good stuff! FOOD! I'm not really a sushi eater I only eat it when my hubby is in the mood for it. I usually just get California roll lol my hubby ordered soft shell crab roll and a tuna roll. He said it was really good. The bill was 92 bucks for a family of 4. Anyway food was good, service was great, and it was clean!"}
{"text":"Going to give 3 stars-
Not for service
Not for quality 
Both of these were good and I would give 4 stars for each.
Decor was nice and clean- but:

I don't want to try to talk over bumping rap music while trying to enjoy dinner.

The other issue which created my 3 star is the price is a bit heavier than what is average and the menu is not only overwhelming with far too many options, but it all seemed to be the same-"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would! Very disappointing coming here when it says they close at 11pm on the door. I walked in at 10 to put in a Togo order and one of the servers said \"its been dead for the past two hours\", so she wouldn't even let me put in a Togo order! Being I'm in the industry that was very poor customer service, and won't be sending people there anymore."}
{"text":"By far one of the best sushi restaurants that I've experienced in Las Vegas!!!

I absolutely loved the fried Calamari! Very large and delicious strips!! 

Great ambiance and customer service!"}
{"text":"I did not like this place. But if you are willing to try something different, this is for you. The sushi isn't very traditional here. The service is okay (they get really busy so it's a bit slow to get anything). Nice place tho, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Every year I gather with my friends at Sushi Loca to celebrate another year of my life. We particularly love the Centennial location. The staff is great, friendly and attentive. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is amazing."}
{"text":"Haven't had sushi in a while, and this was a great place to go to reconnect. The names of the rolls are highly amusing and irreverent, but the sushi is top notch. I've never had a baked roll, and I thoroughly enjoyed the \"Oops she's seventeen\"! Japanese beer is a great pairing, and the price is most definitely right.

My mouth is already watering for my next visit!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing sushi spot. I really enjoy their service and the sushi is very fresh."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! The food is always fresh, nicely plated, and freaking delicious! The only reason for a 4 out of 5 star rating is the customer service. I enjoy the enthusiasm and  interaction of the sushi chefs, but not the fact that sometimes they do a couple too many sake bombs with the customers and cause me to wait 30 minutes for one roll when everyone else at my table is already done eating. Yeah. True story. When my friend asked the waiter what was taking so long for my roll, he responded, \"sorry, they're a little drunk.\" Now, don't get me wrong, I still go there every chance I get! I have feeling that after a few more visits, I'll be upping them to a 5 star rating! Go check it out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic A+.  As we entered we sat at the sushi bar which was very entertaining. The sushi chef was so pleasant and friendly and made incredible rolls. We're offered a cucumber started plate complementary. Nothing large but a small snack and it was yummy. Our service was fantastic and the food was on point. I'm not really one to suggest sushi as a restaurant choice but I think this place made a monster out of me. Better than China Town restaurants I've tried. The bf order the Crazy Horse roll and said it was fantastic and the Philly roll after. I, not eating meat or seafood order the First Date (no crab) and tempura veggie roll and they were amazing. The First Date roll was out of this world. The server described it like a French toast flavored roll and it was incredible. Then we finished off with tempura vanilla ice cream and it was perfect. Other notes I like to mention is the beer came out ice cold with an ice cold mug and they offer a large selection of vegetarian choices and a low carb menu. An A+ absolutely"}
{"text":"The food was OK, but the service was seriously terrible. I had heard amazing things about the NW location so I was excited to try the place at Downtown Summerlin. My BF is a Chef and we were surprised at the level of service. For a Friday night, they seemed to only have ONE waitress which was bizarre. The hostess seemed rushed and didn't speak English so we had no idea what she was saying when she spoke to us. We were not checked on consistently and our drink orders kept getting messed up. The sushi was OK, not that I would rush to go back there. I was pretty underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is lacking.  Been coming here for yrs and always spend close to $100 each time.  Poor customer service too.    Leaves dirty dishes to sit in front of you. Had to pile on the side before they grabbed some of them.   Also asked them to for a plug to charge my phone and server said they could not do that.   Really???    Well then we'll go spend $$ someplace else where we CAN charge our phone."}
{"text":"Ok sushi bar that is nice and clean inside but doesn't have anything to separate it from the competition. The prices are high as well."}
{"text":"I love sushi! This is one of my go to places. Service is always fast and friendly. They have a good selection of sushi! I'm pretty basic when I come here. I like the California roll, Philly roll, spicy crab and tempura shrimp roll. Pour it down with some Sapporo and you have yourself a winner. I always come back."}
{"text":"Amazing food..I love the clam miso soup..I keep going back because of the food. The only problem I have is that everytime I go there they close way earlier then they advertise and make up dumb excuses for why they are closed. I went there at 1am and because they saw me pull up they turned all of the signs off..not the first time! They once told me that the kitchen closes 45 mins before the actual dining room. This is all fine but then make that your closing time."}
{"text":"Doesn't sound like a traditional Japanese name for a sushi restaurant does it?  You may be expecting some type of Japanese-Mexican fusion right? Wrong. When you walk in it's farrrrrrr from commerical.  Sushi Loca has got to be one of the most authentic Japanese sushi restaurants I've ever been to.  The servers are dressed up in traditional Japanese gear and the sushi chefs are so incredibly friendly and fun that it makes you want to be a regular there all the time.  

Most recommended roll: Fat Ass Roll --what? what was that?  Did you just say \"Fat Ass\"?  Will it make me fat?  Well, quite possibly so but with something like this in your mouth you'll be screaming-- \"fatten me up baby!\"  Hey, how ever many fat ass rolls you indulge is entirely up to you.  But I promise that you will never taste a sushi like this more delicious in your life.  I'd describe what's in it but honestly with something like this in your mouth, do I really need to?  Just trust me.  I've abandoned my Lion King roll all together and I'm cheating on it with the Fat Ass roll.  That is how serious of a relationship I have with this Mr. Fat Ass.

Their fish is so fresh it makes you wonder, \"how the heck did they get such fresh fish to the Las Vegas desert?\"  We found out that they get a fresh shipment flown over daily and delivered from Hawaii, Asia and all the yummy places you expect fresh fish to come from.  All their rolls are excellent...they even make boring California rolls a delicious art.  Everything from their edamame  to the fresh oranges they give you after your meal.  Ask for Jack--he's our favorite sushi chef-sters.

If you are in the North Las Vegas area, it would be a shame if you don't stop by this place and give a warm \"Arigato\" for their excellent roll-o's.

We became instant regulars.  Friday nights are crazy, fun.  Music, sushi-chef performances and fun crowds."}
{"text":"It's in my hood, but never tried it until now. They recently have extended their hours on some nights to 2am so we went for some late noshing. 

They have a roll menu, a full menu, a late night menu so we ordered something from each. 

Tako Yaki from the late night ($4.95, 5 pcs)- the batter was great, crisp outside and the inside has a soft gooey consistency but not mushy. There is a big problem though- where was the tako? My first ball had none at all. The second did but it was small and same with the following balls. I took a picture to show you the biggest piece of tako I got next to the size of the ball. Just sayin' it's not crispy balls of dough, it's key word is tako so if you make it, please put it in. Shame,  their batter texture is spot on. 

Final Fantasy 2 roll (inside- spicy soft shell crab, tempura, cucumber. outside is more spicy soft shell crab and mixed fish- $12.95) as you can see from the pic, the roll is pretty filled. It was good, but it wasn't a \"fantasy\". I appreciate the sauce was a happy medium between a light ponzu and spicy mayo sauce and served on the side so the roll doesnt sog. 

Hibachi Beef ($13.95)- diced ribeye with zucchini, mushrooms and onions on a sizzling plate w/ a citrus sauce. The meat was good, soft and juicy and veggies were fresh. Came with rice, miso soup-a tad salty for me, and salad- good dressing thats a cross between ginger dressing and thousand island but the greens were swimming in it.

The service was pretty good. 

The look of the place is very cool, nicely decorated, but the ambiance isn't quite there because of how dirty the booth is. I put a picture up of the wall next to me with black smudges. It's probably stupid kids getting a hold of the sushi menu pencils they leave on the table with stupid parents who don't know how to keep their kids proper, but you should clean that up. Also, the booth is a cool color of microsuede, but the problem with that is you get it smudged and it looks so dirty....there was caked on sauce smudge at the end of the booth where the BF was sitting. I was gonna get a picture, but I didn't need my flash to go off under the table and making me ousted since were the only people left before closing. Sure, I've eaten at dives, hole in the walls that are grimy but if you have this nice of a place I would think maintaining it's nice character should be a given.


The food was good, but nothing I would say set this above and beyond other sushi spots....A-OK food. New Years Eve just past, I did my deep cleaning but Loca didn't. BF and I agreed that 3 stars is being very fair."}
{"text":"Great! experience.. I wanted to kill time so i decided to eat here and check it out.. 
Oh yah!! on point! i just ordered the Salmon Skin roll & the Spicy Crab Roll but oh man did it fill me up!! I will definately come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Quality has went downhill at this place. Met with a friend for lunch. Ordered the Gyoza app, and the sushi lunch special. Friend ordered caterpillar roll and spicy tuna roll. Everything came out at the same time! I only ate two pieces of my sushi, because the tuna was sooo salty. I never used my soy sauce! My friend couldn't finish hers either. Talked to one of the many staff about the disgusting tuna. Staff walked up to the sushi bar told the chef, he shrugged and never once looked up to apologize or ask if we wanted anything else. I lived in Japan for four years, so I am fully aware of all the varieties out there with sushi. I have never had sushi that salty! This experience was the last straw for me and a lot of my friends. Now on the hunt for new sushi bars in the north!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and they are consistent with their sushi rolls.  Always good. The chicken in the bento box was a bit chewy but I won't mark a sushi spot to hard for not great chicken. Staff has always been friendly and provided good service

Can't go wrong with this place"}
{"text":"My husband & I have been eating here regularly for the last 2 years since moving back to Vegas.  It was clean & the sushi was fresh although the portions were quite small compared with our regular sushi bars in LA & it's conveniently located near our home in Summerlin.  We are that couple who orders the same thing each time even when we would place a take out order.  We've never seen this place busy so it never made any sense why the service was so slow but the food was pretty good.  The Screamin O is tuna sashimi salad of which was my favorite.  
We last ordered our usual approx 4 weeks ago as take out.  When my husband brought the food home, I seriously though there was a missing bag.  Our bill is the same each time, $74 in addition to a $10-12 tip for a take out order.  If I were to weigh the food, a McDonald's hamburger would weigh more than the entire meal for 2 people.  It was insulting!!!  The sashimi salad could seriously be consumed in 4 small bites.  The portions were significantly smaller so needless to say I was angry.  I called them immediately to complain...they knew who we were & that we are regulars.  There was a lot of screaming on the phone in the background between the workers so it was obvious to me that they didn't give a S#@T!  \"Come back & they'll redo the order.\"  Sure, makes perfect sense to make a 2nd trip to the restaurant because they were too lazy & cheap to make it right the 1st time.  The $12 tip we had originally added to the bill just added insult to injury...I wish we could have taken that tip back.  Never will we eat at this place again!  I was floored at how arrogant the staff was coming from a sushi bar that was featured on Dirty Dining 2 yrs ago.  Avoid this place, it's not cheap, the service sucks & the portions are small.  There are many other options to choose from."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on Sunday. I'm usually picky about sushi places, but this place definitely exceeds expectations!

First things first, the sushi here didn't make me sick, so that's a plus!

I had the Spicy Crab roll and I found it to be very good, though it was a little lacking on the spicy part. 

Some of the names they have for the sushi is hilarious, but be aware, this isn't a good place for kids, because the names are somewhat provocative. i.e. the Tates-Like-My-Ex-Girlfriend Roll.

I can see the humor in it, but your grandma might not. 

They also have a vast selection of sake here too, but the bottle. I got the blueberry sparkling sake and it was delicious!

the waitresses and chefs were great and I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Great Japanese food with fast service.  We have been there 5 times and expect to go many more times."}
{"text":"Good interior design, large size of sushi restaurant
Hawaiian shrimp was awesome.
Sushi I ordered was fresh and delicious
I am sad that I do not live in Vegas.
I will come back whenever I visit to vegas..."}
{"text":"Great interior. Feel so comfortable to eat
Great service.
Food was absolutely great...delicious....fantastic.
My kids loved their food even though so peaky
I will definitely come back..."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I had in a while. There was only one roll that was good but I wouldn't order again. The service was quick and friendly. I highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just ate here. I was not impressed by any of their rolls. We tried quite a few and the fish didn't not taste fresh at all. Also I ordered Chicken Teriyaki for my son and they forgot all about it and by the time it came out it was cold. 
The service was also terrible and slow. We asked for wasabi a few times and had to ask 2 different servers till they final brought it. 
The rolls we tried were the final fantasy, holy cow,spider roll, don't touch mustache, and sex on the beach, and the jackpot. I was not impressed with any of the rolls at all and fish did not taste fresh at all. I am very disappointed in this places and unfortunate will not be back."}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant....my husband and I absolutely love this place. We don't come as often as we like since we moved across town. But when we are in the area we make our plans around sushi loca. We always order the Mexican roll it never disappoints. Service is great and staff is friendly and welcoming. Come check this place out if you are in the area. It's great!"}
{"text":"The sushi was fantastic. But service was terrible. Server was not able to understand simple directions like warm sake not cold sake and glass of ice water please so do that I give this place 3 stars but the seafood and the sushi was all at least four star food I really like the spicy jalapeno crab rolls those are the best. I think they're called crazy jalapeno rolls oh and they have sushi happy hour hour after 11 p.m. So you get like a 30 percent discount well worth it"}
{"text":"The customer service is horrible. I continued to come but the quality of the food has left me sick the past 3 visits. Sadly, I wish I could elaborate but I just don't know where to start. The cleanliness from the seating area, to the sushi bar, staff member not washing her hands when we both exited the bathroom stall, to the fishy tasting tap water (I know right don't ask), lucky they sell Fiji water for a good $2.75 a bottle, to the quality of fish and seafood. I'm quite disappointed and wouldn't mind sending in a review to the health district too. It was absolutely disgusting that myself and 3 other who dined in ended up with food poisoning resulting in ER and Urgent Care visits. NEVER THOUGHT ID BE THAT PERSON TO WRITE THIS KIND OF REVIEW."}
{"text":"My friends and I always come here! It's so delicious and everyone is always super nice. The prices are perfect and so are the sushi rolls! Usually we order a Kiss of Fire, a Japanese lasagna, definitely a kiss of fire and always the shrimp tempura appetizer. Sometimes we try new rolls but we always finish with some Mochi Ice cream!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"So we finally came to eat here last night and I will say that I like the menu and the food was pretty good but just like most of the reviews say the staff is very inconsistent. I felt kinda rushed until I ordered yellowtail collar (hamachi Kama) and it took forever. Their servers said 5 minutes and it took like 35 minutes. I will say it was a good portion and the price for the food was set at a good price point. I think a couple minor tweeks here and there with staff will again make this place shine a lot more. Also with the name sushi loca I was under the impression that there was some kind of Mexican fusion going on but it isn't just the name."}
{"text":"Great new spot in Summerlin Center. My wife and I had: I Did Your Girlfriend, No Pain No Gain, Heart Attack, and a double order of Baked Mussels as an app (2 pieces per order). All of it was great. I'd say the mussels were the weakest link, but they were still good. Their location isn't the best in the new mega-mall (South of Nordstrom Rack by Five Guys), but it's worth the trip. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Sushi rolls were really good. We stopped here for a light lunch and had the pearl and jackpot roll. Service was a clusterf#$k. Was seated at the sushi bar, took about 10 minutes to bring out our soft drinks. Waitress rushed away even though we said we wanted to order a few things from the kitchen. About 15 minutes later the sushi chef asked us what we wanted. We ordered our rolls through him. Waitress never came by again so our drinks went unfilled. I noticed several other patrons be ignored as well. Had to go up to the front desk to get a waitress to get us our check. Paid in cash and waited another 7 or so minutes just to have someone come by to take It from us. Went back up to desk and finally a few minutes later an employee took it from us. With the extreme lack of attention we could have easily walked out without paying. Lucky for them we are honest people."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST sushi I've had in Las Vegas!!! Great sake selection!!! The sashimi was cut beautifully & unbelievably delicious. The salmon melted in my mouth like butter!!!The rolls were also fresh & tasty!!! Hands down the BEST SUSHI IN LAS VEGAS!!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in vegas by far, great tasting rolls and great service warm and personal! Love this place"}
{"text":"This place....not so good. The fish offerings were either fake or not so fresh. My friend and I will pass by this sushi spot next time."}
{"text":"I must admit this place is freakin awesome. The sushi is extremely delicious. Top 3 of the best that I've had out here in Vegas. I have found my new spot!"}
{"text":"Great sushi!! Very nice atmosphere!!!
Sushi was fresh and creative rolls !!"}
{"text":"never again will i go to place that lacks customer service & return. 
ordered a special deep fried roll that was on top of a bed of sauce that was disgusting the roll was awful had BITEN INTO one piece & kindly asked an older asian woman if i could trade for something else, she looked at me like i was asking for a free meal ??? after some debate i got my usual california roll (stick with what  you know)  also ordered cucumber salad which i never ate as i thought lady spit in my food.

picked up the tab for my  friend  & left a \"fair\" tip but it would have been better had the lady not treated me like a slave eating at masta table.

never again./horrible customer service."}
{"text":"One word..inconsistent. The first time my husband I went it was really good. Fresh sushi and teriyaki. The next time? The rolls tasted old, the rice tasted old as well. We were really disappointed, as we thought we had found \"our\" sushi spot. This place has taught me to eat at a place a few times before writing a review or committing that I've found \"my spot\", 'cause this place AIN'T IT!"}
{"text":"I been coming here for years but the last 3times I came the service has been horrible. There was a bug on our table the waitress killed it with her hand  eww gross. The waitstaff is not A tentative at all we had ask a few times for utensils,water ect..  Also The food just doesn't have the freshness anymore that it used to have especially if you're real sushi eater this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Neighborhood hot spot. Usually busy and noisy but room at the bar! Prices are reasonable and food is tasty. A good value. Nothing fancy though. Not romantic so bring the kids or have a casual date night."}
{"text":"Ok, so I pretty much wrote out short comments about everything I tried while I ate. That is what you will see directly below. Then, a summary of the service will follow. 

Garlic edamame - tastes great, slightly strong flavor but bearable

Gyoza - decent, not the best I've had but it's definitely good with the Gyoza sauce

Tempura - pretty standard, no complaints here

Sashimi platter - wow so much fish, pretty freakin amazing assortment of different fish and it looks fresh. I enjoyed most of the fish on it. I couldn't tell you exactly what fish were on it but I know there was salmon and super white tuna which were both excellent

Jackpot roll - awesome roll, flavor is well balanced. 

Tuna nigiri - tuna is very hit/miss for me and I'm very picky with my tuna. I prefer the best of the best. It was just OK. 

miso soup - excellent. Bits of seafood in it. Just wonderful. 

Kiss of fire roll - freakin amazing, it's not super spicy, there is a slight kick to it but of course if u eat the jalapeño it will be spicy, I took it off. 

Hamachi - very nice, I like Hamachi and the sauce for it is excellent too. 

Super white tuna - o. M. G. So freakin good. I think it was belly or something? Idk but good lord it was tasty. 

Oh my god roll - wow, this roll is something else. I don't normally do rolls but... Oh my god this roll is good. 

I'd say the service was pretty standard; decent. We were well tended to and the waitress was friendly. The guy who cut our sushi for us was Han. He is good! Overall, the sushi was great and I was quite satisfied with the entire experience. I would recommend you check this place out!"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews about this place and their sushi, I decided to give it a try.

I walked in and went straight to the sushi bar. The atmosphere was great, and chefs entertaining. I was greeted with edamame and a small cucumber salad which is a plus. The sushi menu has a lot of specialty rolls to choose from...after 8 minutes of continuous reading,  I realized most of their rolls contained the same things over and over with a little difference???? I ordered the Double Down which wasn't bad....presentation wasnt impressive at all.

After a 5th look at the menu, I decided to customize my 2nd roll due to the lack of variety inside their rolls.

Overall, this place wasn't too bad and I give it props for the atmosphere and service. Price was on par with the rest of the valley."}
{"text":"Sushi loca is the best sushi in the NW of Las Vegas!!! The fish is consistantly high quality."}
{"text":"**Summary**
       - No AYCE - There's no AYCE, so it's all a la carte.
       - Decor - The inside of this place looks amazing and great for a date.
       - Rolls - Their rolls names are a little more interesting than your average sushi place. They're priced a little higher, but they're worth it.
       - Non-sushi - From the limited I tried, I wouldn't bother.
       - Chinese - Other than Ohjah, I think this is only the second Chinese run sushi place. Most are run by Koreans.
**Ordered**
       - $12.95 Final Fantasy 2 - Assorted fish wrapped in shrimp tempura and spicy soft shell crab crumbles with a dipping sauce. This was the roll they suggested, and it's the only reason I'm giving this place a passing mark. It was one of the best rolls I've had. I really like how you can dip the sushi yourself to control how much ponzu sauce you like. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-loca-las-vegas?select=x1CV1RcERUTAxN0Vru3TlA#x1CV1RcERUTAxN0Vru3TlA)
       - $9.95 Dynamite - Shrimp/scallop/mushroom/rice cake slices based over rice. It was nice that the shrimp and scallops were pieces from a larger shrimp/scallop unlike other places that give you mini scallops. However, there seemed to be about 3 or 4 slices of scallop compared to the 15-20 slices of rice cake. Also, this is probably the first time I had Dynamite ontop of rice. I assumed the rice was there to fill space? (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-loca-las-vegas?select=qOBq-CHIQRMxSiF0BJZ0Pw#qOBq-CHIQRMxSiF0BJZ0Pw)
       - $9.95 Lunch Special - You pick two items with soup/salad/rice/goyoza. I got the Beef Teriyaki and Chicken Karage. The beef was in a sliced steak form, but a little think. The chicken was breaded too much for my taste and lacked flavor. The ginger/garlic flavor was too mild and I ended up dipping the chicken in my teriyaki sauce. Overall, a good deal, but definitely not getting the Karage next time. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-loca-las-vegas?select=Z_nsPce_4do4YAK5Vqo6tw#Z_nsPce_4do4YAK5Vqo6tw)
       - $9.95 Beef Yakisoba - Noodles were thinner than I expected and it was lacking flavor. I'm ashamed to say it, but this was the first time I had to pour soy sauce on my noodles. Furthermore, you can see from the picture there's almost no beef slices in the dish. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-loca-las-vegas?select=i0lPvmbwWCMZwhQ5P2wY2w#i0lPvmbwWCMZwhQ5P2wY2w)
**Recommendations**
       - I'm hesitant to recommend this place. The non-sushi I tried was not impressive but the sushi rolls are delicious."}
{"text":"I have only been here the one time, but it was a good experience.  Working on the mall, you get tired of the same ole thing.  So we decided to give this a shot.  The rolls we had were really tasty.  We will be back."}
{"text":"It seems like I am in the northwest more often than normal nowadays. With that being said, I thought it was about time to roam around the area to find restaurants I have not eaten at yet. Sadly, Summerlin is plagued by chain restaurants galore. Good thing Centennial and Providence are starting to develop up. 

Sushi Loca is not an AYCE place, but they do give generous cuts on their fish. The restaurant looked to be packed after a few moments of walking in. Luckily, we avoided the mad rush in and were seated promptly. 

Even though it was my first time here. I ordered sushi like I was at my regular haunts. I threw out orders like hirame with jalapeno, tako with a lemon slice, and it was all prepared decently well. My only complaint is the overuse of sauce. Sometimes less is more. The texture of the rice is good. I can't speak about the flavor since most of it was overdressed. The fish were all delicious. With how busy they are, the turn over must be quick."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with this resto.  It's not that great or \"Japanese\".  We had the spicy tuna roll and hibachi combination dish with two ochas to drink.  Spicy roll was pretty good but not the best I've had.  Hibachi combo dish was ok--meaning it was more like a fajita dish than a Japanese hibachi BBQ dish.  It was not bad, just not what we expected in a Japanese resto.  The comparable restaurant Sushi Tachi in NLV is better in our opinion.   Also,  the service at Sushi Loca wasn't that attentive,  our drinks were empty and in most Japanese restos the drinks don't go down halfway before someone asks if you want more to drink."}
{"text":"I gave it another try..only a matter of time since the place is literally within a mile of my house. This visit occurred at 2:30 in the afternoon on a Sunday. The restaurant wasn't that busy, and my daughter and I were seated right away at the sushi bar. We were given a nice size portion of edemame and cucumber salad. We ordered 3 rolls that I have to admit were Delish! We had the Caterpillar roll, the Final Fantasy 1 roll and a Rainbow roll. I was astounded to see the size of the fish pieces on top of the Rainbow roll, they were huge! All of the fish tasted very fresh. The Final Fantasy 1 is just that....a fantasy, or maybe a dream in which my taste buds were in heaven! It came with a spicy ponzu/mayo sauce that was new to me, but so delicious. It had the spicy flavor of regular garlic ponzu with an added creaminess of the mayo. 

The only reason I am holding back 1 star is because we had to ask for our check. The waitress, once she brought us our drinks, disappeared, without even a return trip for a refill or anything. 

I will definitely return to Sushi Loca. I'm glad I gave them a second chance!"}
{"text":"Service was very attentive and friendly and that is always a plus... It might just be a personal preference but, my only concern is that I felt the sushi rolls were made with too mush rice."}
{"text":"So I mostly stay in the southeast part of town which has a plethora of solid sushi joints. However, I had a friend in town who was staying out in Summerlin and I didn't want her navigating to the other side of town when she wasn't familiar with the roads. So we agree to meet at Sushi Loca in Downtown Summerlin. 

I was a little concerned when I arrived at 6:00 and the place was completely empty. But then again, it was Week 1 of Monday Night Football so I'm sure that had a lot to do with it. The place was very spacious and beautifully decorated. I thought it was pretty cool that they served green tea from Le Creuset French press vessels. 

The food was service was good. We shared the jalapeño yellowtail, salmon collar and a couple of rolls. Everything seemed fresh and we actually loved that the rolls were more fish with just a thin delicate layer of rice. I thought it was strange that they only brought one plate of ginger and wasabi for the three of us to share. 

With so many great sushi restaurants closer to my side of town, there was nothing outstanding to warrant the longer drive out there. However, if I happen to be on that side of town I am absolutely not opposed to going back either."}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  What happened to it? I went with my husband and 3 daughters.  My husband ordered an ice tea and requested sugar 3 separate times, I finally had to ask her in a not so friendly tone, not once did she ask if we want refills ect. My husband's rolls came out first, 30 minutes later I asked what what happened to my kids rice and Habachi? She forgot to place the order.  My daughter's were crying because they were hungry.  I was so upset.  I have never not tipped before, but today was the first time. Zero tip for you, and I wrote her a message on the receipt.  I wrote \"Get better customer service\"."}
{"text":"Second time here, both times it's been amazing. The fish is fresh, service is great and the sushi rice is authentic!

My huband tried one of their bento boxes it wasn't great but just good, we discovered more bang for the buck ordering sushi rolls and tempura off the menu. 

My favorite is their eel role, my husband likes the califorina roll, I love anything with spicy tuna but he thinks its too mushy. Their roasted garlic edamame is great! 

Hood food great service gook beer!"}
{"text":"Food was tasty.  Didn't like the roaches living in the crack between the fridge case and the sushi bar scurrying inches from my plate. Its dark in there so you may not notice but they have a bad roach infestation."}
{"text":"This is a decent place for Sushi, the place is really nice, service is good and the Sushi while not the best but good."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!! Never had bad service or food.  Prices are great.  Open till 2Am."}
{"text":"They have hardly any rolls with raw fish in them which is a huge turn off for me. I always ordered the sashimi which is really good but they raised the price $4 to $19.95 for like 8 peices, I'm not quite sure on the number. Their fish is fresh and tastes good. Too bad it's too expensive and there isn't much raw."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi spot in town.  I always get either the Burning Sensation or the Kiss of Fire with salmon. I really loved their spicy garlic edamame too but they slightly changed the recipe a few months back and sadly it's just not the same."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite place to eat sushi! Everything I've ever eaten was good.. no complaints here."}
{"text":"My mom and I just went here for lunch, and loved it. They have an awesome lunch special for 10$ that includes Miso soup, four fish rolls, and your choice of a roll. Really great deal! 
I got the Salmon roll, a fresh and tasty treat while my mom got the Spicy Crab roll- whoa, way good! 
They give you a huge mound of tangy ginger and wasabi, but they do not have a low sodium soy sauce option, at least not at the table. 
They have five desserts to choose from, awesome since most places I have been to only have about two or three. 
Can't wait to go back ad try a tempura roll!"}
{"text":"Great experience!!! I highly recommend the Tomago Sushimi!! Sweet egg always hits the spot"}
{"text":"Little skeptical about sushi restaurants in North Las Vegas area, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  The music is lively (borderline clubbing music) and there's an upbeat atmosphere especially on the weekends.  

They start off by giving you free cucumber salad (sumonono) and edamame!
And the rolls are GINORMOUS, so you definitely are not overpaying for rolls if you think the prices are a little steep when you first look at the menu!!  The rolls are actually more creative than most places...

Some stand out rolls were the oh my god roll...which has assorted seafood mixed with mochi (rice cake) on top! The other roll that stood out was the elvis roll with a yogurt sauce on top of seared salmon.  I think the only roll I wasn't too pleased with was the Neptune Dazzler...sounded good...but was drowned in a sauce to the point the rice was falling apart.   

I haven't had a chance to try the sushi, but i saw the chefs prepping it and there are definitely large generous portions of fish.  Definitely a go to spot for people who live in the north and northwest area!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Vegas,both locations are awesome. Great service,excellent quality, super clean restaurant.
With TV's and really large sushi bar & next to the summerlin mall couldn't get any better then this.."}
{"text":"Wow! I got smoked salmon sashimi and xxx roll. Everything tasted great. My friend got two standard rolls. One was yellowtail which was great. Other one I don't remember. He also got a specialty roll, didn't get the name was great as well. My only problem is that the specialty rolls are so big and can't eat them in one bite, so they fall apart, oh and had to let my salmon sashimi warm up, it was extremely chilled. But that's more of a preference for me. Some of the best sushi I've had, wish there was one similar to where I live. Though I do have a tendency to stay away from more americanized sushi, it's what it's known for and for good reason."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be great since it is close to my house but no such luck. Very nice inside with a big sushi bar and plenty of tables - and still packed when we got there. Unfortunately the sushi just isn't good. They try to make these specialty rolls that are just loaded with tons of stuff and drowned in sauces and spicy mayos.  Many of them have mounds of extra fish piled (really...PILED) on top, creating an unrecognizable mess. Plus they have many rolls with \"crab\", which means cheap filler.  There are so many other great sushi places worthy of visiting, but since they were smart enough to open in the newest ultra-trendy locale in Summerlin, they will probably be wildly successful.  What a shame."}
{"text":"Great service. I always sit at the sushi bar and the chefs are very entertaining. I love the modern Asian music they play here, the atmosphere is great. 

My faves are the Final Fantasy 2 (O.M.G) and that they have a great spicy salmon roll. I love salmon rolls and they are hard to find. :D Truthfully, Ive yet to try a roll that wasn't fantastic here."}
{"text":"Food So so, service awful! Had to go find someone for water, then hunt someone down to order, then again had to repeatedly ask for check. Sushi didn't taste that fresh and fell apart when you tried to pick any piece up. Very disappointing. Won't be back."}
{"text":"First time and will defiantly be back! Fast seating and food came out wicked fast!!  

Price is normal for good fresh sushi. 

The menu selection is fantastic. 

Atmosphere is perfect for a date or just cuz."}
{"text":"Ive been eating here for years, and slowly its been not so great. I do have my \"go to rolls\" from here that I love! And lots of healthy options for those sushi loving fitnesss goers. My rolls came out in 5 min or less, I know most people want their food quick, but not that quick if it was sitting in lamp or cooler forever. I guess it depends who is working."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi pace in town! Although the they do not go all you can eat you only need a couple rolls to be filled up because they are very large! Absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"The rolls were not bite sized, and too big to fit in my mouth. The sushi was mediocre. The atmosphere was way crazy and too upbeat for my liking. Next"}
{"text":"If you call this sushi, it would be a real insult to those real professional sushi chef who study and work hard to earn their titles.  Let me just say, I can not find anything right about this place. Sorry!!  The word Sushi and Sushi chef comes with an extensive training not a privilege of a color of your skin."}
{"text":"My family and I have come to this location for a few years now. We also eat here about twice a month. Over the last few months however, service as well as the food, has been absolutely HORRIBLE. I don't usually write reviews yet here I am. Let's start with the last time I was here before today. We all ordered, drinks came out fast. One by one however, the food trickled out. And not at all quickly. One person would be done with their food before the next persons came out. And we didn't order anything time consuming either. Not to mention it was a slow day. So my dad always orders brown rice, they forgot per usual. It took 20 more minutes for his brown rice to come out. He was done with his food by that time. On top of that, they hadn't put in 2 of our orders. So while everyone had finished eating, 2 of us had been sitting there with no food at all. Eventually they realized their mistake and comped the 2 orders, which was absolutely necessary. During the time, our waitress never checked in on us, only when we asked about our food. She was also very curt. 

Now today, which is what made me write this review. Upon entering, we see it's packed. Nonetheless, you're in customer service. You do not get to give paying customers attitude. The waitress (same one as the last time who forgot to input our orders) is once again curt and not at all attentive. She forgets my brothers drink order. Fine. She forgets my dads brown rice as always (he gets gout otherwise it wouldn't be a big deal). This time it didn't take as long to come out. 2 of our meals come out, we finish eating them, and 2 of our party still has yet to get their food. Shocking. Not to mention my shrimp hibachi was ONCE AGAIN over cooked and TOO SALTY. Everyone eventually gets their food besides my brother, who only ordered udon.............noodles and broth for crying out loud. Mind you, the waitress knew he was waiting for it as she kept coming by saying \"udon almost done\". I mean, were they making the noodles from scratch back there? Highly doubt it as my brother stated how it wasn't even worth the wait. 

To sum up, we receive horrible service every time as well as mediocre food, every. Single. Time.

Why we come back here is beyond me. If I could give 0 stars, I most definitely would."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Chuli was very nice and friendly. 
Best sushi we've had so far. Back for the forth time.. and will keep coming back for more..."}
{"text":"I love to find great family run restaurants. The owners have been there most of the times I've gone and make you feel really welcome. They have super friendly sushi chefs so I highly recommend sitting at the bar. I think it's much more fun to interact. If that's not your thing, they have private sectioned tables too. It's another authentic place that has the waitress' in traditional kimonos and fresh fish. Never a bad piece. One too spicy but that was my fault for ordering =) WORTH THE DRIVE!!"}
{"text":"I love everything about Sushi Loca. My favorite place when I need a nice hot soup, sake bomb, sushi & a good time."}
{"text":"Okay - so I write reviews and rate places on what they are... Sushi Loca is a locals sushi restaurant and they do it well.

I like it there.  It has a pleasing design.  It has a positive vibe to it.  It is super clean in there.  The service is very friendly.  Fair prices.

Spicy scallop hand roll, Japanese lasagna and shared a few other rolls.  It was all good.  I know a lot of sushi purists will not like this place.  The sushi is basically geared towards well... you know -- round eyes.  It's kinda your sub-urban sushi place, but like I said they do a good a job.  

They do have lewd names for some of the rolls there... kinda obnoxious... but hey.

I noticed they have a late night happy hour... bogo drinks after 11:00."}
{"text":"Waiters are very rude. Waiter said \"ONLY ONE ORDER??\" When my guest and I wanted to share a lunch box. 
Waiter then tossed the lunch box on the corner of the table. 
She never asked if we needed anything, and had an attitude the entire time we were there.
Will not go there again. Ever."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on 10/29/15 with my sister. I will keep this brief so that you can Google the absurd \"writer\" I'm about to reference. 

There is a roll called \"I love my ass.\" I incredulously asked my sister if  author Chuck Tingle wrote the names of these rolls. Google image search / search Buzzfeed for his book covers now & prepare to cry laughing.

We ended up with a spicy tuna roll topped with smelt (?) as well as karage, seaweed salad and 2 pieces of some foolery called something something ex wife and is sold by in pieces. DO NOT get it. Each piece consists of a raw jalapeño, sliced lengthwise, topped with cream cheese, chopped fish and then deep fried with eel sauce. Not good.

Karage was highlight of the meal. Service was good. Menu titles are sophomoric and out of place. We were still hungry after the $28 meal so we stopped for crackers, cheese and wine at Smith's on the way home.

Honestly, I think in general it might be better to come for their late night specials that begin at 11."}
{"text":"2/5 I am very disappointed. Food was mediocre service was very bad , 
So I get there and there must of been maybe 10 people , I basicly had to sit myself no one helped me, I order the first roll burning desire  4/5 pricey but it tasted ok over all , I then ordered mucho grande the batter  was not very cryspy  I would give this roll 2/5 1 star for the presentation was decent  also expensive roll for what it was , then I overhear a conversation from two people  sitting next to me and they where not happy with their order they told her they dint like it and only try a small piece of the roll and where asking to return it , the server reply  \"we still going to charge you for it might as well you eat it \"  I was shocked 

I understand charging steep a la carte  prices but when they give you huge rice rolls with barley any fish that's disappointing, I rather go eat at a cheap all you can eat for that. 

It might seem harsh that I gave this place 2 star but if you look at what they charge ,  I spent 55$  got 2 beers and 2 rolls , I expected the rolls to be something I couldn't get at an ayce sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my first restaurant review and I was encouraged by friend Dan P., the thai food fanatic, to write it.   Sushi loca was recommended by another friend and through yelp.

I went there around 7pm Friday and the place was packed.  The energy was really high and exciting, but I was not feeling it.  I was expecting a quite and relaxing eventing dinner with my mom.  The music was so loud that I could not heard the server and the server was having a hard time hearing us.  

This is what I ordered:

Spicy Tuna Roll was too mushy.  I had better at Yamaguchi Sushi.

Spider Roll was good, but I like Hikari Sushi version better.

Soft Shell Crab Roll was a bit spicy and dry.  It was like eating crab cake over cooked in the oven.

Caterpiller Roll was good.

Rainbow Roll - the fish was not as fresh as Hikari.  It was dry and left out too long.

Volcano no rice - This was the only think that stands out at Sushi Loca.  There were plenty of imitation crab meat with cream cheese wrap with a thin outer layer of Tuna.  The rolls were bake in Yum Yum sauce.

Overall the price is resonable, but it is not the best sushi place in town unless you live in the extreme Northwest. 

I will try again when it is less busy to see if my perception can be changed about Sushi Loca."}
{"text":"I have been to the Summerlin location a number of times. The food is average to above average, depending on what you order.

The Tempura was greasy and heavy. I was doubtful whether they used tempura batter..

The rest of the food was good; Hibachi Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice and the sesame dressing on the salad.

The hostess who could be the owner allows the front of the house to get out of control. There is no rhyme or reason to how you get seated. It's very frustrating especially on a Friday night. We almost left a couple of times before being seated. 

There are many options for sushi so we may be back, we may not."}
{"text":"Hands down this is the best Japanese restaurant in Northwest Las Vegas. They not only have a huge sushi bar, but they also serve my favorite Japanese dishes. Great atmosphere, friendly staff and clean. The food is really fresh and really good. However, ever since the Olive's Garden opened next door, there are now twice as many customers as before, which translate to waiting a bit before getting a table during peak hours."}
{"text":"Ordered on-line with no issues. Lunches were available on time.  Although a little pricey the food quality and quantity made it worth it.  This is only my 2nd time here since I live in Hawaii but I plan to order food from here again."}
{"text":"Foods were okay, nothing special about this place. What bothered me the most was that all of the servers were not friendly at all. They were so grumpy when we asked for water, and condiment. They didn't even to bother to refill our water. We were here at 3:00 p.m and it's not even a busy hour for them and we still didn't get the service."}
{"text":"Sign on the door says open till 2 am. Website hours say open till 11 pm. We get there at 10:15 and were refused service. What type of business refuses money??? Will never attempt to go back."}
{"text":"This is my moms favorite sushi joint because she like to eat yellow tail fish collar. 
This place is alright but it does not offer AYCE. So if your not feeling too hungry but crave sushi, you should try this place out. They have a super white tuna sashimi as an appetizer which is one of my favorites. 
I gave 2/5 stars because on my last visit the waiter messed up on 2 of our orders. Then proceeded to argue with me that it was what I ordered. He then walked away and let the manager deal with us. She then said he is just upset because that was happening a lot that night but I think she failed to realize it was probably the servers fault. She didn't offer a comp or an apology. Not that I needed a comp, just that you think that is the proper thing to do when you have shitty service. But I am the type that no matter how crappy I'm treated I will tip properly so they can realize that they should always give quality service no matter how bad their day has been. (I tipped 18% btw) Finally as I walked out, the same gentleman was by the door and proceed to ignore my group and avoid all eye contact."}
{"text":"Tried sushi loca again...waitresses still VERY rude. Also, they have a minimum of 20$ to use a card. Well, I never carry cash on me. My hibachi was $17.00 and the waitress says, \"it must be cash\" Then she proceeded to say, \"I have told you and your friend before.\" But we misunderstood her I guess.  They eventually let us pay with card but had the biggest attitude. I have never had worst service. Please update your staff..otherwise the food is perfect like a said before!"}
{"text":"Okay, since I've procrastinated too long for all the places I need to review, I am going to forego my long, detailed reviews for succinct, to-the-point ones in an effort to get reviews in for as much of the joints as I can.  First is Sushi Loca.

Chic interior and cool vibe at this sushi joint on the strip mall-y section of Summerlin Downtown. While the food lives up to the premise with their fresh ingredients and good portions, a few things fall short:

- It's a bit pricey for what you get, although quality is good
- Sushi rice falls apart too easily.. good ingredients, mediocre sushi chefs?
- Our server was not very nice... fake smile, always rushing, no acknowledgments

Might visit again because food was good, but needs to improve here and there.

Table-for-1 Factor:  Sushi bar is good for eating alone, as is the large interior with plenty of tables."}
{"text":"This is the best quality sushi that's closest to me. I live in summerlin and eat here twice a week. Those all you can eat places just don't compare. I've never gotten sick from their sushi and the ingredients taste so fresh."}
{"text":"Food was good.  However it was all masked by poor service.  On a Sunday afternoon at around 12:30pm, the place had 2 sets of customers and we were the 3rd.  A server named Jennifer had no concept of customer service,  brought food to the table without saying \"ramen\" or \"salmon roll\" so that you can claim what you ordered.  Instead, she comes and hovers over you with food.  Mind you 1 of our dishes was ramen so she held it over my niece's spot.  

Another waitress was nicer and tended to us after the 2nd half of our meal.  Which I mentioned to her she's nice and had great customer service.  When I asked for the supervisor of the shift, I was told it was Jennifer.  I then informed her that the other waitress had better customer service than her and I would not return for such poor service when there's only 6 other people in the restaurant on Sunday at noon.  

She didn't apologize or say anything else, continued not to smile and have a smirk on her face."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awsome.  I've lived in Vegas for 4 years now and finally found a great sushi restaurant on the northwest side of town.  Since in Vegas have only liked one other sushi restaurant and Sushi Loca is by far better.
The atmosphere is wonderful, great service and fantastic food.   I would go there weekly if I could.

Try everything as everytime I go and order something different its just as delicious as the last dish.  Go and enjoy some great japanese food."}
{"text":"Ugh...should've trusted my instincts.  Ended up ordering from this place due to close proximity to my house, even though I posted previously that I would not do this.  Chose some rolls that had \"crab meat\" in them, according to the menu...let's be clear, it was not \"crab meat\" at all but that fake crab \"stuff.\"  Personally, I don't care if sushi places want to use that but I have no desire to eat it and the menu should be accurate.  Don't call it what it's not.  We ordered some other very forgettable rolls and none of them were any good.  We threw away half of it and that never happens when we order from our favorite sushi place (Naka Sushi...man, I wish that place was closer to my house!).  Now I know for sure...NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Omg!!!! This place is incredible!! Definitely some of the best sushi I've ever had. I ordered the screaming o and stick em up!!  Soooooo good.  We sat at the bar. The sushi chefs were super rad!"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food and we will definitely go back . Had s special dinner there for my daughters bday and they made it special! Thank you sushi loca !"}
{"text":"Walked in at 9pm, was greeted, seated, received drinks all very promptly. For granted it was 9pm and there was maybe 6 tables and a few folks at the bar. Upon being seating fairly quick we waited and waited and waited to order food. So many employees walked past, made eye contact and even said excuse me. We just got up and left!  They noticed that and ask,\"did you eat?\" Lol yes we are out water and left."}
{"text":"Absolutely the last time we will come here!!!! The service is slow !!!!!!!!!!!!!! We asked 3 times for a waitress this time (last time was the same thing we had to keep asking for someone to come to the table) the restaurant was pretty empty tonight and the service was still awful. We nearly left the restaurant after waiting for 20 minutes to be acknowledged! 


Tip to management:
 Acknowledge and service the people keeping your company in business! There's plenty of other places we can go. 

Sushi is average"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Sushi Loca twice.  The first time we were not very impressed.  The sushi was okay; nothing to brag about.  Also, both the waitress and hostess were rude and slow to serve.

However, I am one who believes in second chances.  Months later, I went in a second time where we sat at the sushi bar for our meal.  We got our first couple of rolls, and as I started eating a cockroach crawled by me on the counter.  It then crawled over the glass barrier to where the raw fish is kept (the same fish they served me).  Not wanting to make a scene, I called the sushi chef over and pointed out the bug.  He immediately squished it like it was nothing and apologized.  Our appetites were pretty destroyed after this, but trying to be forgiving and polite, we finished our food and asked for the check.  They brought us the check for full price and did not compensate us for what had happened, although the waitress did apologize when she brought the check.

Being frequent sushi eaters, I will say I have never been so disgusted.  Sushi Loca customers, beware.  We should have left the moment we saw that cockroach crawl by my plate, but we tried to ride it out.  This I regret."}
{"text":"I am in Vegas visiting my Brother, came here and got a few different types of sushi. Some I have had before and others I have not. Anyway,  I thoroughly enjoyed all that I had. The ones I can tell you are spicy tuna, spicy scallop, kiss of fire, and a few others that I cant actually remember there name. I will be back again when I am in town."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been back many times now, and it has never disappointed. Everything that I've ever ordered has been exceptional. I've had several of their rolls and noodles like yakisoba and soba noodles. The portions are really generous, so you will get a good meal out of it.  I second the recommendation for the Fat Ass roll - filling, but good."}
{"text":"Ok more of a 3.5 star sushi joint. Nothing I had was mindblowing."}
{"text":"Everything was great! I had a tempura roll and California roll. Good portions. Well priced. My favorite sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Omg! I can't believe I'm the first review! 

This place is awesome! The menu is just big enough with a great variety of rolls!  Fun names! We had a Neptune's Dazzler, a \"Tastes like my ex-girlfriend\" and a Japanese Lasagna 2....all super fresh and tasty!  

Service was very fast and friendly too! Hubby had the Chicken Teriyaki platter and he said it was great!  

We wolfed it all down it was so good!  I'm sad I forgot to take pics before it was all gone!

Definitely a do again...and I'll take pics next time!  

Everyone come here! This place has to survive!"}
{"text":"Nigiri was good and fresh. Generous fish with just the right amount of rice. Tried salmon, tuna, super white, albacore, and yellowtail. Also tried 2 rolls, Loca Special, and Kiss of Fire. The Kiss of Fire was awesome, highly recommend for those that like it spicy. The Loca Special is a good design, basically spicy tuna, topped with a bunch of tuna and spices. The only issue was the spicy tuna mix didn't taste very fresh. That's why I didn't give 5, otherwise it was really good and I will still return."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and I still love their sushi there screaming orgasm appetizer is delicious and so are their extraordinary rolls I usually get the Final Fantasy 2 roll and the service was great as well nothing but friendly."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. There are other sushi places in town with comparable prices and BETTER customer service. This is my review from my visit with a friend on 4/21 around 3 pm. We first walked in and there were probably only 2 or 3 tables with people and the hostess told us to wait while she checked what was available...ok. We decided to order a la Carter because we weren't terribly hungry & wanted to have room for dessert. We shared the calamari tempura appetizer which was ok. It wasn't the worst, but I've had better. We both got 2 rolls each and I stuck to speciality rolls I was familiar with and knew I would like. My friend decided to get two rolls she had never seen before but both sounded good based off of the description. When her first roll came out she was immediately turned off because of the overwhelming smell that came from the salmon skin top (it was called the salmon skin roll). She only took one bite before deciding she didn't like it & pushed the plate to the side and ate the rest of her second roll. 

Our waitress comes around and asks us if we would like boxes and we both say no. She notices she hasn't touched her first roll & asked if there was anything wrong with it to which she hesitantly relied she didn't like it & wanted to know if she could get a different roll (mind you she is not a confrontational person at all and didn't even want to bring anything up to begin with. She was completely willing to pay for the roll even though she hadn't ate it.) The waitresses entire attitude changed and said she wasn't sure & had to talk to her manager. The manager comes over a few minutes later & immediately goes \"I don't understand, why don't you like it??\" And my friend simply says she just did not enjoy it (I didn't know it was a crime to not like a certain dish when you're having it for the first time.) The manager offers another roll & my friend asks if she could have it to-go because at this point we were done eating & wanted dessert. The manager proceeds to TAKE BACK her offer of another roll & says \"no I can't do that because that's wasting our food and I just can't do that.\" We were both completely shocked at this point because we both work in a restaurant where our place of business is so strict on food costs, but that has never stopped us from giving a free item if a customer was dissatisfied with their meal (I thought this was common restaurant courtesy but apparently not). The manager instead offers a discount to which my friend agrees. She thinks it'll be AT LEAST 50% off but to our shock once again (not really at this point) it was only 10%. Mind you this is a $12 roll. 

Needless to say they DID NOT get a tip from us...correction, we left the 12 cents from her discount as the tip because they did in fact accommodate us sooooo well, how could we not be generous to their fantastic customer service? No wonder this place was almost completely empty on a Saturday afternoon when the mall is completely packed. Even Panda Express a few doors down had a line of customers!"}
{"text":"I ate the final fantasy roll and had the ramen. The roll looked decent but the fish on top was cut extremely thick I had eat it in pieces and it seems they don't wrap the fish properly when they store it cause it seemed a bit dry. 
I'm extremely disappointed in the ramen it smelled like wet dog what ever they use in it the dashi or pork broth or mushrooms  should change cause i love ramen and I don't mind funky Asian flavors but this one was  just unpleasant. 
I've been here before and I've had great experience until  this recent  visit . My advice stick with the sushi and avoid the ramen"}
{"text":"My family & I have been coming to Sushi Loca for some time now. Never a bad experience. Sushi is delicious with fun names. Their lunch special is always a good deal! I like the booth set up, it makes for a private dinner experience."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 4 years and the service is starting to decline. The sushi seems to be thrown together with careless effort. This used to be the best spot on the north side of town. Sadly I haven't been here  in two months."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some of my classmates. The establishment was clean but kind of dark. We were greeted right away and sat down at a booth. 

We were given the lunch menu which the prices were not too bad. It was $13.95 for either a lunch plate which came with sushi, sashimi, and miso soup or a lunch box which came with your choice of two items on the list they provided and miso soup, salad, gyoza, and rice. 

It took the waitress a little longer than we would be liked to come and get our drink orders. So we decided to just order and ask for our drinks when she came to us. I chose the salmon teriyaki and vegetable tempura and one of my friends chose a California roll with the sashimi that was provided under the lunch plate. 

The salmon teriyaki was a bit overcooked for my taste so some pieces were a bit burnt. The vegetable tempura was overwhelming so I was only able to eat a few pieces. But I did like how it came with all those sides. My friend enjoyed her sashimi but her California roll had too much rice and was very filling."}
