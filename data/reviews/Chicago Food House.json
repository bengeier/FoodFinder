{"text":"Wow! I'm surprised that there aren't very many good reviews here. I guess people just didn't order the right things. I on the other hand had the BEST chicken Parmesan sandwich. My BF and I came here last week and I couldn't decide on anything on the menu until I saw the chicken Parmesan sandwich. Took it back to our room and when I took the 1st bite it was over. This was my very first, ever chicken parm sandwich. I tried to recreate it at home last night and it wasn't as good. I'd definitely recommend the chicken Parmesan sandwich."}
{"text":"It was just ok.  My night at the Stratosphere I needed a snack before bed and I bought a large bottle of water, the hummus and pita, and a side of fries. It was about $10 which was great and it tastes good.  The next day I went in and a Philly cheesecake, side of fries, and order of coconut shrimp with two gatores cost me over $40. The Gatorades were $5 each, which is a lot. And it only came with 6 shrimp.   It's part if the hotel so I guess it makes sense to be overpriced but it just reminds me of cheap food you'd get at a water park or something."}
{"text":"They need to Take the Chicago off there name because they are not representing the city at all. They have a limited menu and when I asked for the Italian combination  I was told it's not available at the time because they don't have the sauce. It's over priced for the amount of food your giving. Spent Forty dollars on a Philly Cheese sandwich, a Gyro, a small fries, and cheese sticks."}
{"text":"Not the best service or food. Ordered some waffles and not only were they cold, they were EGGOS.. Talk about cheap, no in house made waffles. I also ordered a basic breakfast that was cold as well.. For 28$ it was a scam of a place. Maybe some real utensils to eat with and plates instead of plastic and paper would help."}
{"text":"Terrible. Don't do it. I was looking for something quick before the Michael Jackson show. I should've looked way harder.   The Philly Cheese was fake meat - a patty broken up while frozen.   What's worse is that the alleged Philly Cheese steak tasted like greasy oily salt.   When I first came upon it I was a little ticked because of how small it was for the price. It was roughly  $13 for 100% crap. In the end it was pushed aside because it was inedible - regardless of how hungry we were. The $13 excessive price tag did not include what I assume would've been extremely greasy inedible fries. The grilled cheese was also so greasy the six-year-old would need it. There is no hope for this place it should just close."}
{"text":"Paid 40 dollars for food that was SO small ! The service was over all okay the employees were nice but both my husband and my Philly steaks just wasn't worth 12 bucks each. Should have been charged 6-8 dollars at most. Rather go to Mexican spot next door"}
{"text":"The food was horrible. I ordered a tuna melt and it was a very nasty sandwich I will not be returning here . The service was horrible"}
{"text":"Disgusting and totally disqualified. Worse food I have had. Not to mention the prices. 5 pieces of \"fried ravioli\" of which has some sort of white paste inside accompanied by cucumber sauce? I was light headed and dizzy needing food and stumbled into this place only to find myself nauseated stumbling out. Don't waste your time or money UNLESS you already suck at cooking and this would be better than yours anyways. Chef Ramsey and Bar Rescue please save them!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible. I would give it 0 probably if I could. Cook was rude the food itself is a joke. Rather go to McDonald's across the way."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here and the service was amazing. Met the owner and they're  really from Chicago and they have these amazing Tapped coconuts. I highly recommend going there."}
