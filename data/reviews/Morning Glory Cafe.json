{"text":"Great neighbourhood breakfast joint - unique spins on classic dishes and fresh, homemade baked goods and excellent coffee.  Due to its very small number of tables (I'd say it can seat 15-20 at the most), there are usually lines at peak periods, so be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes.  Also, cash only, so be forewarned.  Service is decent, but it really depends on who you get - I've had extremely friendly, helpful servers, and also too-cool-for-school hipsters who missed the exit to Ossington"}
{"text":"We took visiting family to breakfast at the farm the Saturday before Christmas. My aunts lived in Tempe in the 1960s before they moved to Seattle and Alaska. They said the farm reminded them of the Valley when they were growing up. The service was great. We sat under a heat lamp on the patio. The little ones weren't too happy with the granola/yogurt dish, but they enjoyed the sausage and eggs. I ordered the gluten-free creamy corn porridge w/ maple glazed sausage and cinnamon sugar roasted apples (the sausage had a surprising spicy pepper kick). A nice selection of hot teas. After we ate, we wandered around Maya's Farm, looking at the newly sprouting crops, chickens with \"funny\" hats. Giant squashes and gourds. My aunts bought fresh baked pies and jams from Joe who was warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst breakfast for the following reasons:
- they don't have regular ketchup! I did not like their homemade stuff so that left me eating without ketchup which is reason enough for me not to go back.
- service was slow and not attentive. I was never asked for a refill on my drink (and the cup size was very small so finished pretty early on!)
- my bacon was served super undercooked so I asked to get it re-cooked until crispy. It arrived about 10 minutes later (i was finished my meal at this point) and it didn't look any different than the first time it was served to me. I couldn't eat it.
- there was no jam or anything to put on my toast, so left that on my plate as well.
- even when it was obvious I did not like my meal (toast and bacon left on the plate), the server did not say anything.

I spent $15 on breakfast and am now at home wondering what to eat for breakfast! Will definitely never go back and would recommend BYOK (bring your own ketchup) if you're a fan of ketchup with your eggs!"}
{"text":"Loved the scenic restaurant, right in the middle of the farm. My #1 spot for a weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Waiter stole from us. My self and my spouse ate at morning glory 5/28, the service was horrible. Wrote a $2.00 tip, I kept the receipt just to make sure the correct amount went through. The waiter Alexandra decided she was owed more and gave herself a $6.00 tip instead of what I wrote in. I have called with no answer or response to this egregious thief by one of their employees. Be wary of eating here for the staff may steal from you."}
{"text":"$35 for 2 atandard fare breakfasts out in the open with  leaves falling on your soon cold food and in your self served coffee in a paper cup. Not impressed.too many hundreds of better options everywhere."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito and French toast is where its at. Great friendly and fast service with quality food and super atmosphere. Yum."}
{"text":"My fav breakfast joint in the city. Charming decor, sunny service, good portions at fair prices, well-executed dishes that are interesting without meandering into typical Torontonian pretentiousness. Plus, the hipster hordes haven't discovered it yet so you can still find a table. (Shhh don't tell them!)"}
{"text":"What an amazing breakfast we had! The hash is beyond comparison, super fluffy nongreasy eggs, and the sausages were so savory with fresh herbs that we re-ordered more! Our lattes and cafe Americanos were perfect. I wish I could get this breakfast boxed & shipped here for a perfect Sunday morning :)"}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix for a friend's wedding and wanted a place to go for brunch the next morning. We went for Sunday brunch with friends, including the bride & groom. It was completely crowded by the time we showed up at 9:30am but they offered us a table for 4 after about 15 minutes (there were 6 of us) and they seated us without our whole party since we were waiting on people. We were a bit squished but it worked out fine. I will admit we were a little worried since our taxi driver had no clue what we were talking about but he found it and it was beautiful from the moment we pulled up. 

Anyways, the atmosphere was wonderful, really laid back. The drinks (minus mimosas) were all self-serve. My fianc√© is a bit of an eggs benedict snob and he loved them! The portions are a little small for the price but it was very different from anything else I've seen in the area. Would go again if we're in town."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Phoenix.  Situated on a produce farm with huge pecan trees lining the road through the farm, it is an oasis.  Being from the east coast, I miss real trees.  When you arrive, you'll almost always see families having picnics in the grass, people bring their dogs, and you can freely roam the farm.  Several restaurants exist here, pass the lunch spot that is closest to the main road and go to Morning Glory.  Not the deal of the century (average price is $11 per entree), but you can have as much coffee as you want, and it's worth it to sit outside in the middle of green farm.  The food is fresh, local if not directly from the farm, and very good.  I've eaten all the veg items, they've happily eliminated meat from anything I asked, and everything is good.  Ask for sauces on the side to be safe.  The biscuits are wonderful and herbed, as are the potatoes.  I often order these two sides with one entree to share with my significant other - PLENTY of food, especially with a bloody mary (or mimosa).

The real reason to come here is for the atmosphere. If  you can possibly avoid Sat and Sun, do it, because this place may be hidden from some, but the hotels know to send guests here.  Be prepared for a wait, but it's not at all a bad think to explore the surroundings."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch places in the city! Teeny and cute, the food is amazing and served on vintage plates (the kinds you'd find in your grandmother's cupboards). And with the most expensive thing on the menu being $7.50, the price is not to be beat. My boyfriend and I go here almost every Sunday and have yet to leave feeling dissapointed!"}
{"text":"50 bucks for two adults and a kid. Way over priced breakfast. The atmosphere was great. The service was very slow. Thank goodness the drinks are self serve."}
{"text":"I came at lunch time. It took me around half-an-hour to get seated. But the good thing about this place is its location. People can help themselves with water, coffee, and lemonade, chatting with friends/family, going around, and enjoying some natural/farm view, especially on a beautiful warm sunny day. The food itself I think was OK. The concept of \"farm to table dining\" is a plus."}
{"text":"This place makes me want to die and go to heaven every time. Its a slice of perfect. 

1) The service is fantastic. You can have nice little conversations with servers who remember regulars and genuinely want to know 'what's up'. They are a fun, quirky and vibrant bunch.

2) I could make myself sick on the homemade ketchup. One time, I became so obsessed with it that I asked if I could buy some for home. Hannah the owner indulged me and I proceeded to eat the entire cup with a spoon on the walk to my house. OMG. Seriously. Put ketchup on everything you normally wouldn't. On that note a lot of the home made sauces and aioli's are pretty killer.

3) Ginger Cookies. Don't bother eating them anywhere else ever again. No joke. Don't even bother with your grandmas. They just won't be as delicious. Enough said. 

4) Hello, apples on sandwiches. Just say yes- though I've not been disappointed by a single menu item and I've had almost everything at some point. 

xo forever. and if you don't like it, you should just stick to mickey d's- you must be THAT kind of person."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourite local breakfast establishments. ( so shush !!!! don't tell anyone) The staff are always ever so helpful and the prices are excellent. The menu is simple....no fancy eggs benny in strange sauces here.....but what they do have is well prepared.
I come here on almost a daily basis and have seen some major Hollywood celebs incognito..........enuff said mate !"}
{"text":"Probably our favorite place to eat breakfast.

The scenery is what you come for and the food is pretty good also.

It can get busy, but every time I have been sat fast.

I don't know how I feel about the serve yourself drink station, but the environment makes up for it.

The weekdays are not as busy as the weekends. Therefore, during the week they do not have some of the entrees served on the weekends. 

Visit their produce stand if it is open, because I love the idea of supporting our local farmers."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best breakfast stop in the Phoenix area. Some may argue Matts Big Breakfast is best but I disagree. The atmosphere alone takes the cake and the food is also top of the list. Some my favorites are chili and eggs, salmon platter, and monte cristo."}
{"text":"A great place to enjoy a meal outside.  The farm was serene and the weather was perfect.  The Farm Monte Cristo, a \"french toast sandwich\" with ham and eggs, was very tasty.  The french toast was melt in your mouth and the over easy eggs added a nice level of texture.  I was a little scared when I saw the sandwich drowning in maple syrup, but was pleasantly surprised when it wasn't overly sweet.  I also liked getting my own coffee as I felt their service was a little slow.  I have been looking for a brunch joint in Phoenix and I think I found a winner.  

Oh yeah, this is also a nice place to bring your 4-legged friend if you have one."}
{"text":"Morning Glory is not your typical brunch joint i.e. dont expect the likes of Bonjour Brioche or Lady Marmalade.  It is:  tiny but quaint, cozy but sweaty on a summer day, cheap but also pretty average.

The food is plain and simple. Definetely not worth pulling out paper, searching for a pen and writing home about.  If all you have is $10 to spare for protein, fats, carbs and caffeine, definetely bookmark Morning Glory under that category. They also have freshly squeezed orange juice (although really, its hard to tell these days with those 'extra pulp' cartons).

I'm giving one whole star for being able to sing along to Metric while chomping on my eggs."}
{"text":"In town for work and found Morning Glory while wandering around King Street early one morning. It'sa small shop yet sunny and inviting.  Since I'm from out of town, I look for anything non-touristy so I was pleased when I noticed folks from the neighborhood stopping in to grab their regular breakfast. 

Important to note, esp if you're not from Canada.  They only except cash.  

Don't go to Morning Glory if you're looking to run in and out for a quick bite.  It's more of a \"lazy Sunday morning, let me read the paper with my 2nd cup of coffee\" type of vibe. I had the Monday Classic sandwich with brie, carmelized onions tomato and bacon.  It too a bit longer than expected for a sandwich but was worth the wait."}
{"text":"What's in a name? This restaurant name says it all - Morning Glory Cafe! If you can handle the wait you will definitely love it. The food is scrumptious and the view makes you feel like you're somewhere other than south Phoenix. 

My only advice would be to try it early in the morning in February or March when the Phoenix heat hasn't begun. I don't think it'd be too pleasant in our 100F+ days!"}
{"text":"You come here for the Farm environment and not so much for the food.  After a long wait on a warm weekend morning, the uncomfortable plastic chairs offered little reconciliation.  

Would've preferred if the French Toast Bread Pudding did not come drenched in maple syrup - much nicer to sweeten as needed.  The country fried steak was unfortunately not as good as Denny's and our favorite version in the Valley at Texaz - this one got soggy quickly under the gravy. My veg and egg skillet with white truffle oil was tasty but seemed a bit small and would've benefited from a side of toast.

Other Valley breakfast eateries like Over Easy and Matt's Big Breakfast offer more satisfying food.  Come here to get away from the city and stretch your legs on the farm.  For only a few bucks more, eat at Quiessence and get more comfy seating, real table cloths and glass cups instead of help-yourself paper ones, which really isn't as earth-friendly."}
{"text":"I went to the Morning Glory Cafe for breakfast early on a weekend day.  The patio is very nice for sitting in a garden type atmosphere and the service was good and very friendly.  However, the food was at best OK, and worst disappointing, as I was expecting above the ordinary.  I ordered a sausage, tomatoe and cheese omlette  that came with \"home fries\", and a buttermilk biscuit.  The omelette was OK, as the tomatoes were a puree drizzled across the top of the eggs, cheese was minimal and hardly noticeable, and the sausage spicy and tasty, with the omlette prepared well as light and fluffy.  The \"home fries\" were cold, over spiced and I ended up eating a bite or two.  The buttermilk bisquit was also disappointing as it was hard on the outside and fairly tastless, only butter and strawberry jam made it acceptable.  I expect flaky, soft centered, bisquists that melt in my mouth and this one tasted like it had been cooked 2 days before and left to dry out.  Maybe other items on the menu would have been more delectable, but I was so disappointed in my breakfast I will not make the trip again to this location."}
{"text":"After hearing about Morning Glory Cafe for years we were excited to go with some friends.  Everything went down hill from there.  The wait staff was slow and seemed put off that they had to work.  The service was slow and the staff uninterested.  My wife ordered the South Mountain Omelet thinking she would get some good veggies.  There were a total of 9 pieces of veggies in the omelet, all cut to about 1 and a half inches long.  There were 2 pieces of asparagus, 2 pieces of string bean, 2 pieces of carrot strips and 2 paper thin pieces of pepper along with 1 tiny piece of the end of a broccoli floret.  The omelet was luke warm.  I ordered the Morning Glory Benedict.  The eggs were close to hard boiled with 7 small pieces of \"Home Fries\" and my meal was also luke warm at best.  Our small overpriced OJ's ($3.50 each) were slightly cool not cold.  Overall, the service was poor to fair, the food was fair to poor and the prices very high, given what you get"}
{"text":"Neighbourhood staple. Friendly staff. Cozy atmosphere.... Don't let the incredible sandwiches distract you from their yogurt and granola bowl. loaded with fresh fruit, amazing granola and maple syrup, that sinks to the bottom greeting you to a sweet finale. :)"}
{"text":"This place is the shit. Hands down I will never go to ihop, Denny's, the good egg, ect. Anytime in the the southern valley you can bet I'll be here! I can't say enough about the quality of food and the taste, THE TASTE! seriously, do your taste buds a favor and make it in here. not to mention the surrounding charming farm. This place is very relaxing, charming, and romantic."}
{"text":"Morning Glory or not to Morning Glory? That was the question. I was going to Buskerfest and wanted to find a brunch place in the St. Lawrence/Corktown/Financial District. I narrowed it down to Morning Glory (thanks Kat F!) and Le Petit Dejuner. It was only 10:45, but when I passed LPD, there was already a line-up. Morning Glory, it was!

I ordered a latte (delish!), the omelette of the day (homemade salsa and cheddar) and a 1/2 order of french toast, as is my normal M.O. The salsa was amazing -- fresh and so delicious -- which made the omelette outstanding. The french toast was good, but was cold by the time I got to it (see below).

They were full inside without a wait, but had seating on the lovely, and tiny, back patio. Unfortunately, their beautiful flowers, and delicious food, attracted the swarms of bees inhabiting T.O. this summer. Not to be thwarted, I perservered. For about ten minutes, until two bees landed in my french toast, at which point I went inside. My server was really sweet about it and let me know when there was a table available inside, so I was able to finish my eggs and eat my french toast.

The staff was super friendly, the menu was selective but seemed to have a variety, and was very good. I would like to go back for lunch and try a sandwich, as they looked fab, too.

They have a little blog on their website that updates the specials each day, although it hasn't been updated since May 2009.  Still, it's a great idea.  I definitely recommend Morning Glory."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! I didn't really read a description on this place before going, but I looked on Yelp and saw it had 4 stars and the pictures showed bomb looking food and a cute patio so I went for it. 

Because I hadn't read any reviews, I did not realize the restaurant was on The Farm. I had trouble funding the place because there were only signs for The Farm and none for Morning Glory Cafe. Once I stepped on The Farm though I was blown away! Who knew a place so green and country could be found in Phoenix? There were rows of planted veggies and beautiful trees. We turned a corner and saw the quaint little patio nestled under some shady trees.

The hostesses were very nice. It was a long wait. But there was a cute little shop and some local vendors where I bought a few little souvies while we waited. We walked the grounds and had such a relaxing little Sunday. 

The food itself was amazing. It took about 45 minutes to come out, and after the 1.5 hour wait for the table we were starving. I got the Back to Your Roots, which was a plate of fresh veggies and potatoes grown right on The Farm! It was incredible! The best meal I've had in months. 

In short, plan to spend you're whole morning there unless you get there early. But the food is worth the wait and The Farm is a super cute place to explore."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are fucking fantastic! One of the best breakfast and sandwich joints in the city. I mean they might take forever because God knows what - I don't fuckin know, but holy shit these are top fucking notch! And they have their own homemade awesome weird ketchup! Well worth the money and the wait at times."}
{"text":"The cutest little place in the cutest little neighbourhood, Morning Glory does all-day breakfast right. The place is super small, but the food is super delicious. When I went, the omelette of the day was Mango & Brie. Whaaaat?? I had to get that in my mouth immediately. 

When it arrived, it was a scrumptious as it sounds - and along with the great music playlist that was lightly wafting through the speakers, it was  a great experience. (Their homemade ketchup ain't so bad either).

They also have a little blog on their website, that mentions their specials along with occasional quirky commentary.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Love the food!  Very cozy and great place to start your weekend at the Morning Glory Cafe"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really what draws you in! My carnivore friends gobbled their meals down, the chili and egg dish was a hit with them. The only vegan option I found was granola and fruit parfait (yogurt omitted of course) and it was TASTY! We came after hiking South Mountain and felt comfortable in our post hike outfits. All in all, cute place with friendly service."}
{"text":"Was at a wedding last Saturday and working Sunday morning so I was a little ropey to say the least.  I hadn't eaten anything by lunchtime so I was starving by then and I really needed something heavy on grease (unhealthy I know but that's the point of hangover food) to get me going for the day.  Morning Glory's patented breakfast butty saved my life.  My colleague gets their omelette of the day when he is in need and swears by it.   

Also, the staff and owner Hannah are always so friendly and laid back which makes things so much easier!"}
{"text":"Farm monte cristo
is more than one can hope for
prepare for big bliss."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my most recent visit. This was our first trip back this season and we brought some friends. I felt so embarrassed for inviting them without having been there in a few months. 

 1. They have changed the menu. The breakfast tacos (the reason I picked this place), waffles, and some omelets are gone

2. They changed the french toast. The new version was horribly disappointing with Marscapone Cheese and Raisin Bourbon Syrup. Both my wife, myself, and friends would have preferred the old candied pecan.

3. Disappointing food:
  - The \"home fries\" were dry, cold, stale, and very chewy with no seasoning at all. 
  - Biscuits and gravy were disappointing. Gravy had poor flavor and the biscuits were flat, and burned
  - Eggs were very rubbery - I had to cut them with a knife.

4. Some items are way overpriced. $2.50 for 1 egg??. I can but a dozen of the Hickman's eggs that are used at the grocery store for that price. 

The one highlight of our visit was the Farm Monte Cristo. It was very flavorful and the Peppered Bacon Syrup was delicious. After this visit, I will not be back for a long time."}
{"text":"Morning Glory has been a family favorite for years.  Great coffee under the trees surrounded by the flowers & fresh crops abound.  The atmosphere is unparalleled!  
We went for breakfast this week & were surprised to see picnic tables were now the norm instead of tables with full back chairs.  Rebar was used as the \"legs\" of the table which you keep banging your knees on.  Sitting at picnic tables is NOT comfortable at best but with a back injury, unbearable.  The waitress did take it upon herself to find a chair without even being asked.... Much appreciated.  She said the table change was new this season.  Obviously ownership didn't want patrons to stay long.   For the prices, we should be as comfy as possible & be served our coffee. 
Coffee was great, water was even great.... That was kinda it.  Muffin a bit dry.  Bacon meh... Salsa omelet was over cooked as were potatoes.   Wish I'd ordered the turkey sausage.  
As much as we hate to cross this off our list, the tables are not a positive change.  Replace the few broken \"floor\" tiles, too.  Trip hazard.  
We hate to check this off our list but we'll return when you change the tables back to something more comfortable."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Healthy food options. Love the outdoor atmosphere. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Going here was a complete waste of our time. Terrible service. This place has about 5 tables and 2 of them were occupied and we still sat for 25 mins without acknowledgement before we left. The server was too busy staring into space and wiping glasses to wait our table after she sat us. Just wanted to have a nice breakfast, wasted time instead and went somewhere else... I would not recommend this place after this experience. Not a way to run a small business..."}
{"text":"Good ambience and setting. Great for out of town visitors or a breakfast date. Bacon is delicious. Charged way too much for self serve drinks. Food was good and priced fair. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Used to go to Morning Glory frequently when I lived closer... glad to have returned after a long layoff.  It reminded me that they serve one of the best breakfasts/brunch in the city.  

Consistently good brunch, with nice selection of menu items: brunch items (omelette), sweet/savoury (french toast, waffles), and breakfast sandwhiches.  Any of their sandwhiches with grilled ham or melted cheese are really good.  Morning Glory also uses Ace Bakery bread.  They have seasonal specials too.  

The restaurant is very quaint, seats maybe 30 people at most.  There is an old-fashioned charm: coffee served in old Corelle mugs that keep the coffee warm.  The kitchen is tiny and very busy, since most of the time the place is packed.

Service is friendly, efficient, and waitresses come around to top up coffee on frequent basis.

Good prices with free street parking on Sundays.  Brunch for 2 with coffee and latte was $25 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"This place has been on our to-do list for over a year before we finally made it here...and I could have kicked myself for waiting so long!

Upon arrival, we were immediately taken w/the place.  The grounds were beautiful and we truly felt like we've \"left town\" and was at someplace else.  There is usually a line for breakfast but once you sign in you can walk the grounds and garden or sit on the outside patio (in front of the other restaurant that's only open for dinner).  This place is also dog friendly and if you get a drink from the bakery up front, you can refill it at the cafe when you sit down for breakfast.

When we come here, we always go for the French Toast and something else.  Have you ever had something so good that it ruins it for you to get it anywhere else?  This is what their French Toast did to me...from that moment on...all French Toasts will be compared to this one.  The bread they use is super light and fluffy, sprinkled w/toasted pecan & served w/warm & silky maple syrup.  It's really simple...yet so unbelievably delicious.

We usually also get some sort of egg breakfast and they've been pretty good.  Their potatoes are also good and I always request mine extra crispy like my bacon.

Another plus is they have fresh-squeezed OJ and the service is always prompt, courteous and mindful."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Not sure why people rave about the place - it's small and cramped, the servers are not particularly attentive (especially once your food is served), and the food is run-of-the-mill, standard fare.
I've been several times, just to ensure fairness of this review, and it has been the same experience each time, more or less. Not a place I plan to visit again, even if it is just down the street. 
Also, they keep very peculiar hours (9-4? 9-3?) which strikes me as odd. I guess they have other jobs on the side besides the cafe."}
{"text":"The food was ok.  I had the breakfast burrito and thought the chorizo inside was a little greasy (I know, what did I expect??).  it was a bit pricey and there wasn't anything particularly plain on the menu for my picky kids.  My daughter LOVED her biscuits because she could put her bacon inside.  The serve yourself beverages are just ok.  For what I'm paying for them (and the meal) I'd sort of like them SERVED.  Also, I will say, I did see the monte cristo on someone else's table and it did look good.  The service was not good at all.  The server seemed impatient with my children (and with me for that matter).  I realize it was late on a Sunday, and she'd likely been there from early in the morning, but a bit more attention than blindly answering my basic questions while staring off at the distance would have been appreciated.  
I think next time we'll eat at the picnic place at the front."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad but its wasn't great either.  I might be a little bias as I'm originally from Melbourne where breakfast and coffee making are an art form.

Nothing special on the menu - I could have made the meal at home and been just as happy.
Eggs were cooked well, toast was toast.  Potato rosti just fell apart as I tried to eat it.  Coffee was ok, thought I had accidentally ordered a milkshake when I saw the size of it, but wasn't too bad.

Overall it was OK but I wouldn't go back or recommend it."}
{"text":"Good service, price to portion ratio a lil' outta whack - side rosti $2 for a silver dollar pancake sized, very flat and not crispy. Jimmy Screech highly recommended - egg in a whole sandwich filled with nice thick ham, cheddar and Dijon."}
{"text":"Love this place, it's such a hidden gem in Phoenix. Take the dogs, kids and a picnic blanket to hang out on the lawn under the trees after you're done eating a tasty brunch in the cooler months. Love that they've kept a simple menu and just focused on honoring their beautiful space in the middle of the city."}
{"text":"We are never disappointed at Morning Glory! Fresh air, patio dining w Cali, fabulous food and Bloody Marys! Beautiful way to enjoy a Saturday afternoon!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing on the weekend although it is busy. The weekday barely anyone is there but the service is kind of weak which you would think it wouldnt be since the employees have nothing else to do. The food is good but everytime we ask for our eggs for be fried or over easy they cone out really runny and sunny side up. Overall you are paying mostly for the environment and the freshness of some of the food. :) I enjoyed the place and I will return agian. :3"}
{"text":"This place is just okay after giving it a few chances, won't be going back again. Food isn't great, acceptable.....meh not great. But the service is what really sucks.  Pity 'cause it would be great to have a breakfast place so close to home."}
{"text":"Faboulous little hidden gem. I absolutely loved this cute breakfast outdoor cafe. Was so refreshing and breezy with beautiful farm setting. Will definatly be back here on my next visit to AZ. Their mimosas were yummy."}
{"text":"I really wish I could write a positive review about this place. The decor and location is sweet, the food was good but the service was terrible. 

My boyfriend and I ate there this morning and my first clue should have been the one man who stormed out from his table and said \"Just forget my order!\" It took about 15 minutes for us to be offered a drink. With about 6 tables inside and 4 tables outside and THREE servers, this was unacceptable. 

The waitress took our order and we watched as every other group was served before us even if they arrived 20 minutes after we had been seated. Eventually, I had to ask another server if our order was missed and she said they were so unorganized trying to figure out who we were. She told the others that because we were sitting outside originally that the order got forgotten but we had been sitting inside the restaurant the entire time. 

All in all, it was 20 minutes before we got coffee, twice as long as that before we got our food and our original server never returned to check in on us though we watched her socialize with the cooks and do menial tasks around the restaurant while we waited and ate. 

I had been here before and have even recommended the place to friends but will no longer be doing so."}
{"text":"Great, hearty breakfast and wonderful coffee!  Breakfast is served outside and we have a baby and were worried it wouldn't too cold but it was a beautiful December morning in the sun.  After breakfast visited the farm, gift shop, and chickens while walking my little baby around.  The perfect way to start the day peacefully and well fed."}
{"text":"Went today with wife and kids for breakfast......very good, had an omelette with sausage topped with some tomatoes sauce and grated parmigiano, it was delicious. 

The wait for a table was about 30 minute, which it was ok, but once seated we had to wait close to 45 minutes for the food.....

It was a little expensive, around 45 dollars with tip for two omelettes and two orange juices.

Great atmosphere and friendly service and good place for kids with plenty of activities allover the farm."}
{"text":"I would like to give this place a 3.5 but not a 4.

Four words into this part of my review I realized I was unintentionally stealing Sarah L's  review so I'll sum up with this, the food was good and cheap. Their staff were warm and friendly and did a good job keeping up with orders. It's a nice clean place with lots of sunlight.

What I didn't like was how small it is inside and how many tables they jam in there. When it's half full it feels like there are too many people and when it's full I feel claustrophobic, which is strange because I'm not bothered by small enclosed spaces normally.

If they were in a larger space I would certainly go more often."}
{"text":"I've been in the valley for 20 years and never knew this place existed at \"The Farm\" on 32nd Street just south of Southern. 

Seating is all outside under large beautiful trees, lovely breeze this morning too, it was one of the most relaxing areas I've ever experienced and it was hard to believe that I was still in the city of Phoenix. 

We were seated within 10 minutes and our server Carrie was great with answers to any questions we even brought us a menu from the restaurant adjacent Quiesscence and answered questions we had about that restaurant. 

Now the food.  I had the chef special which was a braised beef and carmeralized onion omelette with potatoes.   My sister had the Eggs Benedict with the potatoes and of course, being family, we shared.  Everything was delicious and fresh. 

After we ate we wandered around the farm and came across a small crowd and we were informed that the goat had two kids yesterday.   Just watching them brought a big grin to my face.   Next to the goat pen was the chicken pen.   

It was just a lovely morning."}
{"text":"Taking a long weekend out of town, we decided to review Yelp to find a good place to eat breakfast.  I can't say enough about how wonderful our experience was at this out of the way cafe.  The food was excellent.  I had a chicken enchilada with Chile Verde sauce and a fried egg (not something I would normally not get, but so glad I did).  It was to die for.  You are seated outdoors in a picnic style setting.  Our server was Shannon and she was so friendly and helpful.  After we ate, we took a leisurely walk around the grounds to see the chickens and roosters and to look at all the of the fresh produce growing in their gardens. I can't wait to visit Phoenix again to stop at this gem of a restaurant.  Try it...you will be so happy you did."}
{"text":"Lovely setting, average food, atrocious service. There are MUCH better places for breakfast in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went to Morning Glory Cafe at the Farm on Sunday, 10/9.  I almost always enjoy al fresco dining and especially LOVED the atmostphere here.  Liked that all food is grown on the property so I knew it would be fresh.  Had a tasty omelet that could've been bigger and WARMER when it hit our table.  Home fries were pretty cold.  Taste was good, temperature needs help by a warming light and/or wait staff to get it to table sooner.  Lots of pepper in food I ordered...I liked it, my friend wasn't thrilled w/ pepper taste.  You can't beat atmosphere at restaurant and surrounding farm area for a lovely stroll.  5 Stars for location and atmosphere, 3 stars for SIZE of omelet and cool temperature of food (so, overall will give it 4*)"}
{"text":"Love this place for a variety of reasons and would go here for just about any occasion...
Have spent Mother's day here @ Morning Glory (not separate buffet) for a few years and like to take friends here when in town or when we want a relaxed, filling, outdoors brunch. Great service and scenery! I would like to say all food is good but I can't pry myself away from the Monte Cristo French Toast to try anything else-- delish! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"There are some items on the menu that I'd rate as a \"miss.\" But by and large this quaint little cafe offers a delicious brunch in a nice setting.

Their buns are uniformly awesome. The side of sausage irresistible. Friendly, prompt service."}
{"text":"Love it. Correctly priced, good food. Where else can you find a place in the desert where you can eat under trees, in a farm? Granola is out of this world, and the Montecristo is to die for. Relax, enjoy."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Staff was super friendly. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a unique breakfast nook."}
{"text":"Put it this way: Every guest I have in Phoenix, I force to get the Monte Cristo at Morning Glory. It is just that good. Taking my parents here in two weeks and my mouth is salivating already."}
{"text":"Yummy brunch in a cute setting.  The restaurant is one of three on a farm.  The Morning Glory Cafe is devoted to breakfast/brunch items while the other two restaurants serve lunch and dinner.  I had the Farm Monte Cristo -- the perfect combination of salty and sweet.  The eggs were cooked just the way I like them.  The Morning Glory Benedict was also excellent.  Loved the farm greens on the benedict, tasted very fresh.  No complaints here."}
{"text":"I am already excited to return here for breakfast, even though I know it will be packed! We lucked out and went yesterday for breakfast, and it had just re-opened for the season the day before, so not many people knew that it is open, so it was amazing. Lots of empty tables and no wait. I loved driving in on the long driveway, surrounded by green grass and pecan trees. Passing a greenhouse and chicken coop, we parked and then walked in with our dog. (Dogs are welcome on the patio). I ordered eggs, bacon, biscuit and homefries and my girlfriend ordered the monte cristo - ham, eggs and cheese between pieces of french toast and then smothered in maple syrup. Both of our meals were divine - fresh and with clean flavors. I love that the restaurants at The Farm use ingredients that they either grow on their property or get super locally. You can really taste it in the food. After breakfast we walked around the property, peaking in at the chickens and the different plants growing. Great spot that I highly recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Pretty surprised that some folks didn't quite enjoy MGC as much as I did! Went here on a beautiful weekend on our bikes. Their back patio was full but we sat near the door which gave our table a cool summer breeze. 

I had the Jimmy Screech sandwich (grilled ham + havarti + dijon + egg fried into the middle) and my love ordered the Cornelius (corned beef + caramelized onion + guyere) with a fried egg and we both LOVED it. Comparing between the two, I'd recommend the Jimmy Screech. Our one table neighbour saw my JS and made a mental note to order it for next time, and our other table neighbour (a regular, he seemed) came in and ordered the same thing so you know they're doing something right with that one!

A filling, heart and gut warming sandwich topped with mixed green salad (we all need to eat more greens!) and a fresh cup of grapefruit juice made the experience pretty high up on my list of more enjoyable, stress-free, simple weekend brunches!

Atmosphere - 3.5/5
Service - 3.5/5 (the place was small with only 3 or 4 tables in the store front so she didn't have to walk very far to get us stuff!)
Food - 4/5
Price - 5/5"}
{"text":"What a beautiful setting to eat breakfast in.  That's why I'm giving it four stars.  The eggs were yummy, the potatoes a little dry, and the coffee I would have preferred in an actual mug instead of a throw-away cup, although it did allow me to carry it around as we roamed the beautiful farm after eating.  What a nice way to spend a weekend morning."}
{"text":"A nice break from the indulgent, rich brunch out there. Very fresh, fast, and healthy, and friendly service!"}
{"text":"such an adorable spot if you're in the area and need a beautiful hangout to look at flowers, walk around the vegetable farm, and grab a bite to eat. There's an organic farm on the property and the tea and lemonade are self serve. The only main issue is that Arizona is hot and everything is outdoors. In addition there were lots of flies so everyone was swatting them with their menu. At the same time, people willing to overcome both of those issues must love the spot. Very cute. Would definitely recommend it to anyone near the airport!"}
{"text":"Great food for a good price. The staff is friendly patient. An outside atmosphere that is relaxing and enjoyable. The kids got up to play as the rest of us enjoyed the food. No complaint about the food, but the coffee choices could use some work. Regular or decaf. with refills.."}
{"text":"The best brunch or breakfast I've had in Phoenix.  The eggs benedict was perfect, and all of the six people I was with liked their meals. The atmosphere was good, the coffee was good, the service was good. 

Admittedly, it was cool and overcast, and I wouldn't want to sit outside if it were 100 degrees outside. But other than that, I anticipate many, many trips here in the future!"}
{"text":"This place has a magical feel to it! Very impressed with the service and amibience. The food was also great but I was a little dissappointed about the Chicken Enchiladas being sold out. Def have to check this place out. I suggest driving past the Farm Kitchen (Lunch Restaurant) and make your way to the back for a great experience. Not sure if the two restaurant are connected but the attitude from the farm kitchen compared to Morning Glory Cafe is night and day :("}
{"text":"Absolutely AWFUL service this morning. We have been here many times before and it had always been an enjoyable experience, but this morning was just so awful. Our server was slow and unsure of every little thing. Getting drinks took far too long, food orders were incorrect or forgotten entirely, at no point in our meal did our server ask how things were or check on us. I will not frequent this establishment in the future nor will I recommend this cafe to to anyone else. Completely dissatisfied."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to have  brunch at Morning Glory Cafe. The server was very friendly and helpful in deciding what to order. 

I had the breakfast burrito with a side of sausage patty and a side of rosti while my friend had the 3 eggs and toast meal with a side of bacon. The food was served quickly along with the homemade ketchup and homemade strawberry jam. 

The food was excellent! The avacado mixed into the burrito was a nice touch and the sausage patty was so juicy and flavourful. The food was not greasy and I will definitely come back here in the future."}
{"text":"I had the Western.

This little cafe makes delicious sandwiches with fresh ingredients and has a friendly staff. Perfect for a light lunch or breakfast.
The western was great and I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Awesome mimosas, the Morning Glory muffin is amazing.  Great service and atmosphere.  Did I mention good mimosas?  Grapefruit mint and rosemary lemonade."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Don't get me wrong it's a great ambiance having breakfast on picnic tables at the farm. But don't waste your time. The food is mediocre at best. But the service is horrible. From the unfriendly/rude female hostess, to the server being unwelcoming and then the food took FORVER. breakfast food should take MAXIMUM 16 minutes. Took close if not more than 30. And it wasn't even full. We were hopeful for the 2nd time but disappointed again. As \"cute\" as the environment is, not worth paying for the overpriced breakfast food and crap service. Safe to say we won't be back for a 3rd time"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite breakfast place in all of the Metropolitan Phoenix Area. I drive all the way from Litchfield Park/Goodyear are to here just for their food. They have an amazing waffle which is topped off with fresh berries and a sweet butter. Another one of my favorite dishes is their Pork is the New Black omelet. I'm typically not a big omelet guy, but that changed the first time i had the PITNB from here. I definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and wasn't disappointed.  Service was good, plenty of tables and turnover seemed manageable for the staff.  

Food was fresh and was as expected.  Had an omelet and the French toast.  Would recommend either as a good choice for your breakfast.  

Only drawback to this place is that you are definitely paying a higher price (especially for breakfast) because of the \"atmosphere\" and venue you are in.  However, I didn't mind paying that upcharge.  From what I saw there seemed to be a lack of restaurants in the area, especially for breakfast.  

Would come here again, and wouldn't think twice about giving it as a recommendation."}
{"text":"Beautiful place to eat breakfast. I'm happy to pay a little more when I know the food is quality. Birds are chirping and the sun shines through the trees. Little chilly during winter so bring a jacket"}
{"text":"We went here last weekend for the first time with friends.  Excellent food, and we had great service.  We liked this place so much that we went back for brunch today.  The chicken enchiladas are fantastic, as is the monte cristo.  Definitely my new favorite brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Decent breakfast . Better ingredients than your average breakfast spot. It's small so you may not get a spot and expect it to be warm inside. Grilled cheese has real cheese!"}
{"text":"First thing. This must be one of the few places left in the civilized world that take CASH ONLY. Nearest ATM is at a service station 15 minute walk away so remember that.

Food was cold when we got it. The rosti was tasteless and required significant addition of salt to bring it back to life. The sausage was so strongly flavoured with sage that we couldn't taste anything else. Figured on trying just a regular coffee with cream as this seems to something you can't mess up. Well, coffee was terrible too. It's either Folgers or some bland, cheap brand. Willing to say prices are cheap though and waitress was friendly. Really not our kind of place and cannot share the enthusiasm that others seem to have had for the place. Bad experience and a shame as breakfast is one of the easiest meals in the world to get right!!! Obviously others love it though from reading the reviews. Each to their own."}
{"text":"I have only been here with a large group. Each time (3), I thought the service was excellent and the food very tasty. I love the ambiance and am so glad we have this little jewel in the Valley.  From the Monte Cristo to the homemade granola and omelets, the food is solid and I think the portions appropriate. 

My only complaint about Morning Glory is the self serve drinks. The price should be posted. I am not cheap but would like to know the ice tea will be included for $2.75. After paying my bill, I made sure to stop by and get a refill."}
{"text":"Nice to go to see something different and get a different experience. i really liked the atmosphere of the farm. cute, picnic tables, a few chickens, lots of fruit trees, very pretty and calming to walk around the farm. 

but, in rating the restaurant, i would give it 0-1 :( food was not tasty at all. was expecting so much more from this place! went there for breakfast. 1st thing, they didn't have fresh squeezed OJ. how can a farm not having fresh squeezed OJ?? i think it was around $3 for a small glass of OJ that he took out of the refrigerator gallon bottle and poured it in. very expensive, overpriced for the food that sadly wasn't something i would go back for. i had gotten some sort of a scrambler and my husband got the french toast. the scrambler was ok and the french toast was drowning in syrup, wayy too sweet and heavy. 

also, we waited about 45min on a saturday morning to get seated, which was expected, so no big deal about that.

but, i was expecting much better tasting food for a place that's on a farm and so expensive. if i go back, i may just go to see the farm, but not to eat there again. 

the weekend i went (in mid october), they were talking about how someone new had bought it and the ownership of the farm changed, so maybe they'll make or have already made improvements at the restaurant...?"}
{"text":"This place is too cute. It's a great date spot, it feels like you are a million miles away from the city. We didn't have to wait for a table, but if you do, I would take the opportunity to explore the farm. It really is a cool place.

I had the American breakfast and my date had the Monte Cristo. Both were delicious.

A couple of tips, the coffee/lemonade/tea is all self-serve from a table by the building, but it is not complimentary. So if you grab yourself a coffee and a lemonade for example you will be charged for two beverages. Personally I would prefer if they just did away with the self-serve table and had the servers bring the beverages like other restaurants.

It is outside seating so in the cooler weather the meals cool down quickly. Also, you may be pelted with leaves or twigs from the surrounding trees if the wind blows and get a friendly bird or two hoping for a bit of your breakfast. I think it is part of the charm of the place, but yes you may be picking leaves out of your hair as you leave.

Also, the bathroom is a little rustic. It's a step above an outhouse really. It is clean-ish for what it is but you have been warned."}
{"text":"We stopped by Morning Glory cafe after a hike up south mountain.  I love going to the farm and the morning glory cafe is always enjoyed by our guests when visiting.  The cafe was packed and the service was a bit slow.  Please don't forget though the kitchen is quite small. I tried the chorizo omelet and it was lovely. The potatoes are always perfectly cooked and the biscuit is a nice complement to the meal.  Many healthy options to choose from and all fresh ingredients used!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is to die for!!! First time here and we found it on Yelp and came because of the great reviews. I was beyond excited when I saw chilaquiles on the menu because I've been craving them! We also got a waffle, the pork is the new black omelette, and their signature  breakfast sandwich! Everything was great, I mean amazing!! The service was awesome too!! The scenery is beautiful too, shaded, and it  felt amazing outside! I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Morning Glory Cafe has quickly become my new favorite breakfast spot.  Mainly because of its outdoor, fresh air, country feel.  The grounds make you feel like you are eating right smack in the middle of a working farm.  You can walk around the different areas, even check out gift shop.  There usually is a wait, but luckily it has never been more than 10 or 15 minutes. The tables are wobbly and the ground is hard to walk on in many areas (don't bring your heels or wedges here), but adds to the unique, agricultural yet homey atmosphere. 

As far as the food goes, I have tried a few different dishes from the french toast, pork omelet, eggs Benedict, and American breakfast.  They are all delicious, I haven't had anything I did not enjoy. Love the lemonade, and the muffins are house-baked.  Try this place out on one of our many beautiful sunny Arizona mornings. 

Tip- bring your furry friends, this is a pet friendly patio.
Tip- good location for different group events, from yoga to weddings."}
{"text":"My least favorite of the three places to eat at South Mountain.  I wasn't very impressed by the food, no where near as delicious as quiescence or the farm lunch."}
{"text":"What a nice hidden place to have breakfast!
Services was top notch!
Breakfast was delicious and so was desert. 
They were also not shady with their mamosa drinks ;)
Pet friendly!
And plenty of space to walk off.
Will definitely be coming here again and again and again."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast for our anniversary and it was everything I had heard it would be.  I had the Monte Cristo and it was delicious.  I also had a mimosa and you could tell it was made with fresh squeezed oj.  10/10 would come again."}
{"text":"Kind of pricey for what you get which is healthy, yes, but not very tasty. The pulled pork sandwich was too sweet and the coleslaw had no dressing or flavor (just shredded cabbage). $26 for two sandwiches and a bag of chips is a bit steep for a no service, no frills kind of place for lunch."}
{"text":"Love the setting. The food is amazing, considering a lot of it is from the very farm it is on. And normally I hate waiting at places but they had little shops and gardens to explore and look at while we waited. I know everything is outside but still a little dirty for my taste which is the only thing keeping it from 5 stars."}
{"text":"I so wanted to love this place. I'd heard great things about the food, love the concept and was looking forward to a wonderful experience. What a disappointment. 

We were seated within 20 minutes or so of arrival, which was great considering the crowd. It was nice to have somewhere to walk around, and we were able to serve ourselves tea and coffee while we waited. 

Once seated, however, it took 20 minutes for anyone to take our order, and another 45 for the food to come. Our food arrived cold. Husband and I both ordered eggs \"over medium;\" mine were runny and undercooked, his were hard and scaly. \"Home fries\" were a mound of mushy, under-seasoned potatoes. We were offered jam when the food came, but the waitress never returned with it. My husband asked one of the other staff if they had any jam, received a curt, \"yes\" as a reply, but they didn't offer to help in any way. 

For the prices (average $10 plus $2.25 for a self-serve drink), I can think of many places I'd rather spend my dining dollars. Yes, the grounds are lovely and I like that most of the food is from local suppliers (which does not mean it was raised on THIS farm, BTW), but there are many lovely patios in Phoenix with much better food and service."}
{"text":"Excellent stop in a bit out of downtown, but worth the drive if you have kids.

Great food, lots of atmosphere....can you say animals and a working farm to distract the kids? 

An absolute must if the weather is mild and you can get there early.  A bit later it gets too busy and limited number of tables can cause a wait.

Kids loved the self-serve beverages and we loved the flavor and local flair

Only reason it wasn't a five star was the amount of 'nature' that ended up in my coffee...lots of grass and seeds from the overhanging trees.  Guess I should have had a lid on my coffee

Dog friendly and very laid back vibe.

We will probably stop I on our way to airport, making it our only Phoenix repeat during our short stay"}
{"text":"Came to have brunch for my bffs birthday in super bowl Sunday. There were 7 of us so we were ok with the 45 minute - 1 hour wait. We grabbed some coffee and browsed around the area for a bit since the day was beautiful. They sat us down. The waitress was a bit rude yet tried to be funny. The kind of rude where you don't know if that was a joke or not. Kinda awkward. Out of the 7, 5 of us were eating. None of us had complicated special orders we orders the basic breakfast plate. It was pretty packed so we automatically expected to be a wait for our food. However everyone who sat down after us and ordered after us got their food first. We waited almost an hour and a half for simple breakfast food! It wasn't until the birthday girl got up and asked the manager what was going on to the response she got was \"we are short staffed in the kitchen\" ok that still has nothing to do with why the people around us all got their food first when they sat down way after us. We eventually got our food. My plate was delicious. Others had runny scrambled eggs and cold over easy eggs. I gave 2 stars because my food was good and they took a percentage off our check."}
{"text":"\"Please wait to be seated\".  Now there's a sign we haven't seen too often in our current breakfast tour (see my list, \"breakfast places\"). Fan-cee!  

This place was a step up from our usual greasy spoon/diner preference, but the price fit the bill.  (Special = 2 eggs, rosti, toast and coffee, 5.50.  Add meat for 2.50.  Not bad.)

The eggs were very good, the toast was excellent and the rosti was...well, just barely there.  The potatoes are shredded very fine, not particularly tasty, and today's portion was pretty skimpy, so they were almost missed.

Our large-ish group of 8* was primarily pleased, however, the loudest shout-out was for the Morning Glory Western Sandwich.

The waitress was patient and friendly, the vibe was good, and the food was above average.  What more could one want?

*Henceforth known as the \"Breakfast of 4 Davids\".

NB. Maybe actually 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"There is a lot of hype for this place but the breakfast was pretty mediocre and over priced for an outdoor only restaurant. 
The menu has your standard breakfast items which include sandwiches, omelets, waffles, french toast. Although the ingredients are partly locally grown, the flavors are bland and taste similar to what I would prepare myself in the comfort of my home...and I could take it to my patio if I wanted to eat outside. 
All items range 11-15 bucks. Drinks are all self serve which is a little annoying too. I usually like to be served when I go to a restaurant. 
It's outdoor seating and it can get pretty warm. At least the tables are shaded but it's like 90 degrees in early April so it's not a very comfortable experience. 
Overall Morning Glory is all hype. The food is not the quality of the Michelin star breakfast place as it is of price. 
I guess I wouldn't come back unless the prices were more reasonable and the weather was nicer (like month of February only).  
There are so many more unique breakfast/brunch spots in Phoenix that also use fresh products that I would rather visit."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was terrific. Outdoors, birds chirping, colorful foliage all around. The menu is excellent and I had the brisket which was much better than expected. I asked about the chefs special for the day and read that the asparagus omelette was delicious. Unfortunately it was broccoli today so I went with the brisket. My server was Gabriela and she was the icing on the cake. Great recommendations, great service, great atmosphere. Peaceful, and a welcome break during a hectic day. I completed some work while I was there and plan on returning in the future since I work around the corner from this peaceful place."}
{"text":"The Monte Cristo French toast was to die for!!!! Next time it will be the eggs bene. Self service beverage bar rocks!!! It was packed being the last weekend open for the season. We had a 40 min wait but with the self service beverage bar, the beautiful scenery, the very yummy brunch, it was so worth the wait."}
{"text":"After hitting up the downtown farmers market this past Saturday, the Hubs and I decided to give the Farm at South Mountain a try, since we are rarely in this area.  Although we were a bit confused on which restaurant was which, we ended up landing at the Morning Glory Cafe.  I must add, as other reviewers have noted, the scenery here is wonderful and unique.  That alone is a reason to stop by, but as food goes, I might just bring a picnic lunch or get lunch at the grill when I come back next time.

I found the food to be mediocre at best.  I had the breakfast tacos, which were served in a hard shell - I didn't know restaurants served those anymore, especially on a breakfast taco.  The taste was fresh, minus the shell, but nothing special that I couldn't make myself at home.  The potatoes on the side had good flavor, but I would have preferred them to be crispier... they were rather soft.  The Hubs had the french toast, which he seemed to love.  I really saw him enjoying the candied pecans on top.  I liked the self serve lemonade/tea/coffee, although non were anything to write home about.

So, if you're in the area and want to experience something different, I say why not try Morning Glory Cafe.  For me, next time I will try the deli/grill place at the front.  I love the idea of a picnic here on a beautiful spring or fall day.  Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"This little cafe located towards the back of The Farm at South Mountain is to die for. All normal lawn chairs, nothing fancy. It's under a huge tree that gives shade to the entire outdoor restaurant. I love seeing all the vegetables that they planted because they take those veggies and use it for their different dish. Such a cute little place with mouth watering, fresh, organic, veggies right from the garden. Love love love!"}
{"text":"Loved the environment: flowers, blooming trees on the patio with roosters crowing in the background."}
{"text":"This is a cute spot! It is a bit out of the way next to South Mountain, but the rural farmy setting definitely benefits from that. 

You enter by going up a long farm lane, passing between several buildings, an event lawn, a group doing yoga on the other lawn, etc. It is very picturesque and seems like a good place for a wedding or other party. There are several buildings at the end of the lane and Morning Glory Cafe occupies the patio of one of those buildings - you duck beneath a vine-covered arbor and enter the seating area. The tables are patio tables covered with plastic red gingham patterned tablecloths with menus scattered on them. You choose your own table and are advised to help yourself to coffee, iced tea, lemonade, water at the station next to the house. You can also order a few other beverages from your server - orange juice, mimosas, bloody marys, etc. 

The menu is relatively brief but chock full of farm fresh ingredients. They have some interesting items - The Cowboy Breakfast Chili and Eggs, The Farm Monte Cristo, and the Chicken Enchiladas were all pretty unique breakfast fare and so we ordered one of each :) Browsing the menu, I learned that if you are a pancake/waffle/french toast/pastry lover, this is not the place for you. The food came out REALLY fast, which makes me think that they have most of the stuff ready to go in the kitchen and just garnish/sauce the dishes before sending them out. Itwas pretty good - I got the Chicken Enchiladas, which were filled with shredded chicken, covered with green chile sauce, and topped with Over Easy eggs. The temperature of the dish was less than great (a bit cold) and the yolks of my eggs were overdone, cooked all the way through. When I've had dishes like this before, the intention is that the yolks are runny and add moisture and flavor to the dish beneath. Since the eggs were overcooked, this didn't happen and it left the rest of the dish pretty dry (most of the green chile sauce was soaked into the enchiladas beneath) I did ask for extra chile sauce which was provided promptly, however it was very cold and did not spread well over the dish (I also could have still used even more of it, as the dish was SO dry) 

We had a side of bacon that was delicious, and my husband enjoyed the Cowboy Breakfast Chili. 

The setting was nice - we could hear roosters crowing and watch the activities of the farm/preparation for the day's events, etc. while we ate.

Service was decent - the girl who was our server was nice but a little brief - I was having trouble deciding and asked her for her favorite item on the menu. She said the Chicken Enchiladas but didn't really elaborate further, which didn't sell me on it. Her demeanor just came across as pretty uninterested.

I felt like the prices were quite high considering the type of place (outdoor picnic tables), service (serve yourself for the key stuff and overall a little less than friendly) and food (seemingly mass made, okay tasting, not quite right) We spent $60 for three people and I walked away just really feeling as though it wasn't worth $20 per person.

I did want to like Morning Glory Cafe, but in the end it was more of a \"meh\" meal."}
{"text":"The surroundings are pretty and there is a ton of natural shade which doesn't happen much in Phoenix. It is a week day so this place wasn't very busy today (Thursday). Do not count on Yelps posted hours go directly to the website itself. Today it was only open 8-11am. Enjoyed our meal (also a very limited selection) we both had the pork omlette which was tasty and a large portion. The extreme amount of flies was kinda gross. If the manager/owner reads this I would suggest some measures about keeping flies away. For example there are plants flies don't like (basil, mint and tansy) that could be added to each table as a centerpiece. Just a thought."}
{"text":"I went to breakfast with some friends at the Morning Glory  (The Farm) after a hike on South Mountain last Sunday. It's been awhile since I had been there and noticed the new picnic tables and how they all matched, loved it!!! We were quickly greeted by Barbara who did a fantastic job from start to finish!! No chasing her down. She was on it! The coffee and food were great as I remembered. A place to add to your must go list."}
{"text":"This is easily one of my FAVORITE places to eat & be!  I recommend everyone visit here at least once!

A beautiful farm (garden, not too many animals) that uses their harvest in the dishes.  This place is extremely beautiful, relaxing, and delicious!

I've ordered their granola, French toast, and the Pork is the New Black omelet over and again!  Every time has been delicious, we even took a bag of granola home!  They use the pecans from their trees and it's perfect!

The omelet is served with a gravy, bisquit, and potatoes.  Soooooo good! 

The service is always great, even when they are super busy and have a 30 minute wait time. 

The bathrooms... are not what'd I'd prefer, but they are decent."}
{"text":"It was a bit pricey but worth it. Farm fresh food. Organic. Beautiful atmosphere and great service. Our server was Lorena and she was great. Tended to our every need. Really enjoyed our experience there. We had a party of 3 and it was $60 minus the tip. We will return soon"}
{"text":"Morning Glory, get it together!  I did my part by calling and asking for a reservation for 10 people.  I left a message asking you to all me if you CAN'T accommodate us 2 days prior.  24 hours go by so I call and leave another message 1 day prior.  NO response.  Finally, I called that morning and got no response, so decided to head over early.  Now for the BAD part....I approached the hostess to ask about my reservation and was told we were not on the list.  She clearly did not care and her only offer was that a big table would be open \"soon\".  I couldn't get any sort of indication of what \"soon\" meant so called everyone and gave them the bad news.  The fact they were not willing to stick it out was very telling and should be an indicator for you.  Clearly you don't care about my business so I won't be back.  Way to lose a good, loyal customer, Morning Glory."}
{"text":"Cannot believe that I've lived here as long as I have and this was my first visit to The Farm.  As they don't serve hot breakfast @ The Farm, they told us about Morning Glory Cafe and we walked back.  It is quaint and lovely.  Upon arrival at the desk, the gal said we could grab a coffee or water while we wait.  We killed a few minutes by grabbing coffee (half a cup) and waiting out front.  The food was very good -- my husband had the brisket & eggs and I had the omlette of the day.  My only complaint, and I can see several others have commented on this, is the casual manner in which they tell you about grabbing a self serve coffee.  If they can't tell you they will charge you for it up front, then it should be clearly posted as such at the drink dispenser area.  We would have never gotten a half a cup of coffee each if we had known it would add $6 to our bill.  This is a big no no and has a way of turning people off even when the overall experience was good.  Dear Morning Glory:  please post something indicating the cost of the beverages that are casually mentioned by your hostess.  This feels a bit deceitful.  Thank you."}
{"text":"A perfect place for a lazy Sunday morning breakfast! I had the Chef's special which was an asparagus and swiss omelet with a red pepper cream sauce. To die for yummy! The little biscuits and home-fries served with it were delicious too! 

My boyfriend had the chicken enchilada and loved it. 

Our only criticism would be for the drinks. He had a Bloody Mary. The drinks were premade so they could not customize. He said there was too much pepper and not enough Worcestershire. 

They don't serve any pop either. Pop is my caffeine fix of choice so that was a bit of a bummer. 

Service was good and it was fun to walk around the property while we waited for our table."}
{"text":"They overcooked my omlet eggs. The place is pretty but the food is nothing special. On weekends expect insane waiting times."}
{"text":"A must visit everytime I am in Phoenix.  I wish I knew this was here when I lived in Phoenix.  The scenery is just  gorgeous! It is always busy but the scenery and set up you never feel rushed nor does it feel crowded.  The whole premise of The Farm and Morning Glory Cafe is sustainability and quality, which they definitely achieve.  Everything I have eaten is delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"We had an amazing breakfast!! I got a large latte, which tasted amazing and was freshly made. I got a breakfast sandwich with a fried egg, ham, homemade ketchup (amazing!!!), garlic aioli, on a homemade bun. The breakfast sandwiches all come with an amazing side salad too with a great dressing!! My boyfriend had a sandwich with brie, an egg friend into the bread, and ham too. We split a homemade sausage patty which was so juicy and not greasy. We ate every last bit, and were so stuffed. The bill only came to $28 and the service was great!"}
{"text":"I went here for an early morning breakfast on a lovely Sunday morning 2 weeks ago for the 4th time. I had a terrible experience. It was tons of flies around while eating, the services wasn't good. The waitress was overwhelmed. The restaurant didn't have adequate silverware and no jelly. How can you serve breakfast and not have any jelly. I will not be back again to the Morning Glory Cafe."}
{"text":"Excellent! I have been to Morning Glory Cafe several times and have never been disappointed. The restaurant is strictly for breakfast and has many options. I have had the monte cristo, eggs any style with fresh veggies, all american breakfast, and breakfast burrito. All are amazing and so fresh and light. They offer free coffee and lemonade, which is located on a table near the hostess. You walk up and get it yourself and refill as much as you want! The coffe is great and the lemonade is fresh! This place is so good, even when it was downpouring rain, my husband and I and the rest of the patrons stayed to finish their food. They did have umbrellas but in a monsoon like that, we still got relatively wet. So delicious!!!"}
{"text":"One star removed for wait ( was told an hour waited about 1.5 hours) worth the wait -however nothing extra ordinary.  Ordered the Belgium waffle very light and fresh butter it comes with is delish. Mimosa was yummy.  Waitress heard us say we were hungry ( after waiting 1.5 hours to be aeated) so she brought us some biscuits and jam! Worth checking out if you have the time to kill. All seating is outside and they don't take reservations so be prepared."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and attentive service in a garden oasis. The huevos rancheros with chorizo were fantastic. Just visiting from Hawaii but would definitely come back again if we were in town for longer!"}
{"text":"Nice brunch on a beautiful day.  The place was still pretty packed at noon (they close at 1pm).  We ordered the eggs benedict, All American breakfast and egg white omelet.  Everything was very good. I'm not a mushroom fan so I didn't try the egg white omelet (it has portabello mushrooms in it).  But the benedict was tasty and teh all american breakfast came with a great biscuit that was super flaky.  Portions are not huge, but satisfying.  Its nice to be able to sit under large historic trees and enjoy the weather and company.  For those who have dogs you can bring them there!  Its a bit on the the pricey side (its no 2.99 special at Denny's), but you pay for the relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"So delicious. Probably the best breakfast place in Phoenix. The service was fine, and it was nice to eat breakfast outside on a cold brisk morning. There are heaters outside too! 

The food was excellent. We tried the chili and Monte Cristo -- so so so good. I'm going back."}
{"text":"I was here once. A reasonably sized girl broke her white plastic lawn chair and tumbled to the ground. I averted my gaze and tried to focus on my overpriced mediocre eggs benedict. My friend just laughed and laughed. I guess I should have ordered the mimosas, too."}
{"text":"After my family and I eating brunch here at least once a week for over 7 years, I figured it was time to finally write a review.  Few things in life are predictably awesome, and brunch here is one of those things.  I can conservatively estimate that I've eating my favourite food item on their menu over 200 times, The Breakfast Butty. It is the one food that actually dream about, and when I get my fix it puts the world back in order and all is well.  I also love the small diner feel and knowing that I just have to say, \"I'll have the usual\" and my hot coffee and Butty arrive perfect every time."}
{"text":"I would have to say, Both Gordon Ramsey and Robert Irving would like the menu here, its pretty short menu, and your not waking your brain trying to figure out what to get. 
I had a Omelette and OJ, the one thing I REALLY REALLY loved here was the Strawberry Jam! Best jam I EVER had! The Omelette itself, I dont know about the gravy on it, but it was good, wife went with a Omelette that had Goat Cheese on it, the Goat Cheese most diffidently had a bite to it, so not sure I would get it myself, but overall, if your looking for a good Breakfast place in the Tempe area- THIS IS A MUST GO TO place!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty food, good coffee, but the servers don't get to keep their tips. I will not support a business with practices like this."}
{"text":"A good friend once said that everything tastes good with truffle oil.

I couldn't agree more, and that's just one of the reasons I love the Morning Glory Cafe.

Let's start with ambience.  It's an outdoor patio, with trees providing the shade.  It's morning on a farm, so the cock will crow every now and then.  Birds actually sing.  And it's Phoenix, so the weather is going to be perfect 99% of the time.

The coffee (serve yourself!) is a decent blend.  But the highlight of the breakfast was the veggie skillet - farm fresh vegetables done in a skillet (this mornings selection included fennel, squash and red onion), together with skillet potatoes, and topped with scrambled eggs finished with white truffle oil.

I know - it makes me salivate just thinking about it.  And that's what makes a good restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!!

Everything on the menu looked SO good.... I couldn't decide. Sooooo I got the following:

French Toast (Sweet Rustic Bread, Apple Butter, Candied Pecans and Warm Syrup) 
+ Side of 1 egg and a side of applewood smoked Bacon (3 Slices) 

The french toast came out with 3 THICK slices of bread, a TON of apple butter and a sprinkling of pecans. While the bread was fresh and soft... it didnt really have much flavor... I like my french toast to be more cinnamony... Plus, there was just TOO MUCH butter and not enough pecans.

The bacon was MONEY!! It was peppered (which I LOVE) and cooked perfectly. 

My friend got the blueberry Belgian waffle which she swapped 1/2 for 1/2 of my french toast.

The waffle was probably the best thing there.... light and fluffy with WHOLE blueberries in it... YUM.

Also, my other friend's meal came with a biscuit and \"home fries\" which she let me try. The biscuit was warm and fresh out of the oven but a bit too dense for my taste... the \"home fries\" are actually just seasoned and slightly mashed up potatoes... they were REALLY good... spicy and very flavorful. I wish I had ordered some!! 

I also got a glass of fresh squeeze orange juice. DELICIOUS!!! 

The food here is great, but what really makes this place a hit is the ambiance... the little tables under the shade of the trees and the farmy, rustic feel. 

GO HERE!!"}
{"text":"We traveled out of our way to go back to this spot while visiting family. Such a beautiful farm Oasis in the middle of a desert. And the food is so fresh and delicious. Will definitely be back a third time / every time we visit."}
{"text":"Loved this place, it is so quaint.  We happen to be in the neighborhood and i've always wanted to try this place.  The grounds are beautiful with huge grassy areas, picnic tables, huge gardens, etc.  We had breakfast here.  I had the South Mountain omelet with goat cheese and sauteed vegetables from their garden (zucchini, red pepper, onion, fennel, cauliflower).  You can not get more farm to table than this place.   My boyfriend had eggs benedict and he said the sauce was the best he has ever had - very rich.  He said the sauteed greens on the benedict was a nice touch.  It's very casual and it was packed.

I definitely want to try the dinner restaurant, Quintessa?   It is expensive but would be such a great experience.  They said he butchers his own meat and flies in fresh seafood every day.   Yummy!"}
{"text":"I was enjoying breakfast at MGC this morning and realized I have been seriously remiss in not reviewing it. 

The Morning Glory Cafe is in a sort of in-between space on King Street, but in close proximity to several interesting destinations that will make you want to drop in and have a yummy breakfast.  (Examples that apply to me: The Body Blitz Spa, the Leslieville Value Village, the enormous Staples Depot!)

It's a small, bright space that feels very welcoming and seems to attract both in and out of neighbourhood clientele.I've enjoyed several of the omelette specials and many menu items, all scrumptious. Service is pleasant and very helpful in working through special requests or allergies with patrons. 

Definitely try out that incredible homemade ketchup! you will not believe that the stuff that comes out of the squeezy bottle is supposed to be the same thing.

My only regret when I go to the MGC is that I don't have more room in my tummy to keep eating.

With summer time comes a summer patio, but I didn't check it out.

Important: Cash only."}
{"text":"I came here back when I was at George brown just a hop skip and a Jump away. Atmosphere is very cozy and comfortable. Breakfast options is yum! An they have good breaky specials. 
The staff was reaLly nice and friendly. It is a tiny restaurant so I'd recommend going with a small group. Perfect spot to cosy up with a coffee and book and have a relaxing afternoon."}
{"text":"Delicious and worth the wait! We had a farm omelette, Monte Cristo and farm breakfast burrito. All were so yummy! The biscuits were mouth watering too. To add to all of the yum is the surrounding farm where they get their vegetables. There is so much charm to explore while waiting for a table. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"An absolutely perfect breakfast spot on a lovely day. For a Sunday between 1030 and noon, the wait was zero to ten minutes (pretty impressive for such a prime brunch hour). The grounds are gorgeous and shady, and include an entire farm and green house in which to walk off your meal, and the food was fantastic. 

I had the All American Breakfast, which included a perfect sized serving of bacon, two eggs, a biscuit and hash browns. Everything was how you would want it to be - the bacon crisp, the biscuits soft and buttery, the eggs fresh and cooked to order. 

My one complaint was the bloody mary, which was WAY too spicy. I'm not one to send a drink back, but it was ruining the meal because it was creating a reaction in my throat with each sip. I flagged down the waitress and asked to add more tomato juice to it to even it out (and she seemed to know what I was going to request before I said, leading me to believe this happens a lot and that they should reconsider their bloody mary mix recipe). But she was more than happy to correct it ... except that they had run out of tomato juice. I left the drink where she placed it back on the table, hoping I wouldn't have to ask to have it removed from the bill. 

Smartly, when she came to drop off the check, she asked if we were done and if I wanted the drink. I said no, she then handed us the appropriate ticket. She had the smarts to print one with the drink on it and one without so she would be prepared for either answer, eliminating any awkwardness or time wasting by going back to re-print it. Seriously, it's that kind of simple act of foresight that makes me love a venue's service.

Oh, and they have wi-fi but I couldn't get my phone to pick up the network."}
{"text":"Superb.  Excellent service. Beautiful setting.  It feels like you are getting out of town to dine here.  Our meal was flawless."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Legacy Golf Resorts during Christmas break, and decided to get some brunch.  I booted up my trusty Yelp App, and a quick search yielded this place a mere 30 second drive away.

This is just an awesome brunch spot.  A lot of the ingredients seemed very fresh and delicious.  I got the breakfast burritos which came loaded with rich, delicious chorizo, eggs, and beans, while my girlfriend got the waffles.  The waffles came with the sweetest blackberries I've ever eaten (although the strawberries were not sweet).

Love the atmosphere, service, and the food.  What can be better than sitting outside surrounded by the farm, enjoying fresh coffee and brunch?  Life is good!"}
{"text":"Joined my fellow yelpers for the Breakfast Club UYE, couldn't go wrong with a farm fresh breakfast! The setting was gorgeous, surrounded by trees, flowers, herbs and veggies, it smelled amazing and was such a relaxed environment that I wanted to pull up a hammock. It has a great venue for a small party or wedding(definitely somebody else's of course) but lovely just the same.
While waiting for our breakfast we wandered a bit, my daughter and I enjoyed time taking pictures of pretty flowers. At your leisure you could help yourself to water, tea, coffee, or fresh lemonade. I ordered the farm burrito & home fries while my daughter ordered the banana french toast(which gave a few of us food envy) with a side of sausage. Lucky for us the portion was large and she shared, even took some home. Good service and everything tasted  farm fresh and fabulous."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love this place! The setting is beautiful, peaceful and very unique. It is part of what was once a very large multi acre farm that the Heard family purchased back in the day to study the Arizona canal systems. 
It is still a working farm today providing fresh produce, eggs, crafts and best of all........restaurant services. 
The breakfast here at the Morning Glory is always very fresh. The herbs and vegetables are grown here,  the coffee is robust yet smooth and iced tea is always refreshing. I have yet to try the morning libations offered but they are on my list. Lol
I typically get the smoked trout omelette with egg whites, potatoes and fresh homemade biscuit. (I hand the biscuit over to my bf since it's not gluten free :(( ). The biscuit comes with a side of fresh homemade strawberry preserves which is DELISH! 
After a wonderful relaxing scenic breakfast, it's a joy and pleasure to walk around the farm exploring all that is offered. 
They provide three restaurants in one location. (breakfast, lunch and dinner) There are also three areas for events including weddings, showers, birthdays and special celebrations. 
The staff is very friendly and a accommodating and facilities clean and satisfactory. 
Come and check this place out! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a beautiful location to enjoy breakfast-right in the farm surrounded by nature and all its glory. You can't get much fresher than \"just laid eggs\"! The chef is brilliant and I actually took a chance on a vegetable hash with my eggs over easy and it was AH-MAZING! 

Pet friendly, your dogs can sit at your feet as you enjoy the fresh air and some of the finest food around."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on a perfect day. The weather was brilliant - not too windy or sunny and there was a lively atmosphere but it wasn't overcrowded. You definitely don't feel like you're in Arizona when you're here. The grounds are surprisingly lush and there's a lot of plant life. I did expect a farm when I visited, but aside from the few plants here and there - there's not much farmland. Moving on to the restaurant, the menu is definitely pricey. You are paying for the ambiance. The service was also very slow. I was actually audibly complaining to my boyfriend (sorry honey) about the long wait when the waitress finally brought out our food. 

I had the \"Back To Your Roots\" which is a vegetable omelette, over-easy eggs, and a buttermilk biscuit. The meal was very good. Just a headsup on the veggie omelette - it's quite carrot-heavy so if you're not a fan, I'd reconsider.

Again, I'm so glad we went on a day with beautiful weather. I can't imagine the outdoor dining experience is very pleasant in 113 degree weather. Overall, a great brunch place to visit when the weather's nice."}
{"text":"We went for brunch on Saturday as a group of eight (plus my Corgi), and I was delighted with my entire experience. They don't take reservations, and when we got there we were told the wait would be an hour. For a Saturday morning I wasn't surprised, I feel like you'd have a hard time finding a brunch place with a shorter wait in most parts of the Valley. Luckily, since we were such a large group there were only so many tables that could accommodate us and one opened up within 15 minutes! 

In the 15 minutes we waited we grabbed coffee from the coffee cart and mimosas from the hostess table, listened to the live music, explored the gardens, and checked out the local businesses that had booths. We even got to watch weddings get set up and one happen! 

They were busy but our orders were taken quickly and our food brought out in record time. Our waitress seemed spread thin, so it was hard to get the one set of silverware we were missing, but it all happened in time. The food was great, everyone in our group loved what they ordered. It's hard to beat fresh ingredients that come straight from the farm that surrounds you as you eat. If you're going with a group, take note that there's no splitting of checks, but thank goodness for Venmo! 

There are giant shade trees that kept us cool in the beautiful April weather, and the entire place had such a relaxed and happy environment. I would've loved to hang out there all day.

I had heard people talk about the Farm at South Mountain for years while I lived in the Valley, and am so glad I finally went!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed breakfast here with my wife. unique outdoor dining experience. great food and efficient, friendly service. will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Morning Glory isn't cheap but it's delicious, fresh, organic, local food and totally worth! I went on recommendation of a coworker and was not let down. I had the Monte Cristo and....wow. the brioche french toast was incredible and the egg and everything else was perfectly cooked. the wait time was well over an hour (perhaps because we went on Valentine's Day???) but it was definitely worth it! And as an awesome extra bonus: their coffee cups/lids are compostable!"}
{"text":"Go early or you will wait, wait, wait.  

I love their biscuits; they have some sort of herbs, which make them a little different.  Zach likes the eggs benedict.

This is a great place to bring family while in town, a little oasis in the city."}
{"text":"After a long but quite enjoyable saturday night, the last thing I wanted to do was wait in line for brunch the next day. Therefore, both Lady Marmalade and Bonjour Brioche were both a no go. Stumbling upon morning glory cafe, we decided to give it a try(after yelping it of course).

The place was small but there were enough tables. We were greeted right away by the friendly staff that promptly brought us menus. The drinks were written on the board and I decided to go with the freshly squeezed apple pear juice and french toast, whereas my bf had the ham and hot egg sandwhich with bacon on the side and OJ. My french toast was quite the generous portion. It came with three slices with fresh apples on top and 'real maple syrup'. It was really good and my boyfriend was pleased with his. 

What caught my attention more than the food, was a little note on the wall in the women's washroom. The note said, \"to whoever stole this painting, i hope you enjoyed it as much as I did..it was given to me by my grandmother.\" It really touched me."}
{"text":"I think this might be one of my new favorite spots for breakfast . The food was delicious, quality ingredients and large portions. I had the huevos  rancheros and shared the brioche French toast.  It's a nice get away from the city, within the city. The outdoor space was relaxing and service excellent. Looking forward to trying more from their menu!"}
{"text":"03/18/2018
First time here!! Beautiful outdoor farm along with chickens. The wait time on a Sunday around 10am was 25 minutes. There is plenty to see and enjoy while you wait. The service was really quick and friendly. I definitely enjoyed the outdoor eating this time of year. Plate range from $12 & up for very good quality ingredients."}
{"text":"What a fun place to go to for breakfast.  My husband and I took my uncle here for breakfast a couple of weeks ago.  It is a beautiful place to go to.  You definitely do not fill like you are in Arizona when you are at the Caf√©. 

One of the cool thing about the caf√© was that you could get your own drink whenever you wanted to.  The staff was great and the food was amazing too.  I had the pork in the new black omelet.  O my,  it was the best omelet I have had in a really long time.  

If you have guest coming into town and trying to decide where to go.  You should take them to Morning Glory Caf√©."}
{"text":"This is an outstanding breakfast spot that I cannot wait to go back to! They have a large, dog friendly patio and plenty of seating. The service was quick and friendly and food was outstanding! I highly recommend the farm burrito. 

There was about a 25 minute wait, but we anticipated that since it was about 11am on Saturday morning. The grounds of The Farm are beautiful and give you plenty of scenic areas to walk around and kill time while waiting. They also had live music and mimosas for purchase while you wait."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was really awesome but everything else was lacking. 

Sitting outside under the large trees was really nice, only having Coffee, Tea, Lemonade, and water as your drink choices was not. Oh did I mention you had to serve your own drinks. 

The portions were small and expensive, and nothing to write home about in the taste department.

I feel that the only reason people give this 4 stars is because it is trendy to like Organic locally grown places."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a weekend in Phoenix that was actually pleasant and mild! The weather definitely helped improve my opinion of the place, as it is an outdoor restaurant.
We had a slight wait on the Sunday morning that we went, which we didn't mind at all because of the lovely scenery at The Farm @ South Mountain. It definitely makes you forget that you are in the middle of the desert.
We were seated at a 4-top, even though we were only a party of 2. It was nice to have the extra room! I got the American Breakfast, which included 2 scrambled eggs, home fries, applewood smoked bacon and a DELICIOUS biscuit that we had to order 2 more of, they were that good! 
My husband had the local Schreiner's sausage, tomato and cheese omelette, which he really enjoyed, but I think he could have easily eaten a slightly larger portion.
The food was really great! We had a really sweet server as well.
The only complaint I have is that they had what looked like an all-you-can-drink beverage bar, where they were serving lemonade, tea and water from big canteens in plastic cups. Of course, we grabbed 2 drinks thinking \"Oh, how nice!\" Unfortunately, both drinks turned up on our tab. I would have appreciated someone warning us that they charge for the drink bar.
But, that's OK. Now I am more informed and I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Brunch food here is pretty good - even by my snobby SF standards. I had the Cowboy Breakfast with beans which was tasty but the beans were underdone (a little too al dente). I did appreciate how they did their best to make sure everything was ethically/locally/sustainably sourced.

And though I understand the appeal of eating outside at the farm, it was very distracting to have flowers/seeds falling from the trees onto our table through the entire meal. Were the chefs planning our meals around this additional food from the sky? Also, when I pointed out the decaf coffee was empty they said they'd fill it but did not even though I kept on eye on it throughout our meal.

But these are small complaints. Overall the food is good."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am enamored with nature and the farm-to-table concept. I think it's a brilliant shift in our society that is so disconnected with where our food comes from. That being said, I've been to the farm for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Thus far, breakfast blows the others out of the park...err...farm. 

My breakfast absolutely blew me away. I had the Farm Burrito with scrambled eggs, refried Arizona tepary beans,potatoes, cheddar cheese and pico de gallo wrapped in a locally made flour tortilla. They serve it with sour cream, salsa, and home fries. 

My mouth is watering right now remembering this. It's one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. I didn't bother talking to my breakfast date. I was more interested in the burrito. 

It was a dog friendly patio which created for a great ambiance outside on a beautiful Sunday morning. Complete with a mimosa and a Bloody Mary, the day couldn't have been much better."}
{"text":"Limited menu, but we love taking our two dogs to The Farm for special brunches. You can see all the produce being grown from your table. This is expensive but casual (help-yourself coffee and juice) clothing-wise."}
{"text":"They take debit now, so that's a plus. 

Still, food portions are pretty small but the price is right. I only ever have the plain ol' breakfast because nothing else really appeals to be on the menu since I either want a proper breakfast or brunch and they seem to offer more of the breakfast sandwich options 

Some people go crazy for that homemade ketchup, I think it's disgusting and overly sweet. Please offer regular ketchup."}
{"text":"Adorable space.  Really cheap average to good breakfasts.  It won't blow your mind- but a good affordable option if you are in the neighbourhood.
The nice thing is that you can spend a bit more time here- since intimidating lines won't be circling your table for you to leave.
The service is great- people are nice.  Nothing spectacular..but in the summer, when I walk eastwards towards a food dessert that sits right between St lawrence and the Distillery- this is a solid option."}
{"text":"We came here on a beautiful Sunday morning. We sat outside, which i don't think there is inside seating here. But, not sure.                        Anyway, this is such a peaceful and beautiful place!                                  The Coffee and Tea were great. The Food wonderful!   So romantic and beautiful. This is the place to go to just relax and remember what a great place the Valley can be."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance at this place. But when will the owners enforce the servers to be grateful they have a J-O-B? No smiles, no great customer service. The food takes FOREVER to get out to you. But if you wanna sit and wait 30 minutes or so for your food, then go. The food is tasty and it's nice to support a local biz. They should think about a little live music once a month on weekends."}
{"text":"What an absolutely LOVELY spot for breakfast al fresco! The ambience itself would have gotten five stars, however, our service was incredibly slow.  We were a table of two adults and four children - all ordering from the adult menu.  Our waitress was quick to take our order, but the food took exceptionally long and we had to ask twice for something that had been forgotten.  After the meal, we waited a bit to get our check but sent her back immediately with a credit card.  After about five minutes we were told they were experiencing computer issues so it would be another moment or two.  Had she been up front about the delay, we'd have been more understanding but having to track her down on more than one occasion was a little bit of an annoyance.  I'd like to go back, sans kids, to try out both the lunch and dinner restaurants.  I love that everything was separate and we enjoyed watching both a morning wedding AND the farmers picking beautiful flowers while we ate.  Such a quaint spot and didn't feel at all like we were in the middle of the desert!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food is good too, but this dining is all about this setting.  Deep in the Walnut orchard under shady trees.  Sitting across from the one in your life.    

It is 4 stars just because the service is getting a little weak.  I used feel like the people there were tip top, but this last visit they seemed to resting on their fact that everyone loves the setting.  They turned down the customer service thinking I wouldn't notice.  

It is true, I did barely notice it, since I happen to be in love.  However, when you have a great server this place makes you feel like, you're dining in Oprah Winfreys' backyard during a big hat party!  Shimmering leaves, mimosas, amidst a organic garden, birds chirping, while couples in love and children frolic on the almond orchard horizon.  

This place is great!  I feel like giving it 5 stars again now that I think about my times there.  This setting is so damn good.  I have to drive 15 miles to get here, and it is worth it.  However, I am going to keep it a 4 stars.  If I update, I am sure i will write this one a 5 star again"}
{"text":"This spot is really close to where I fix my car, which makes it very convenient.

The space is small and cozy, with a friendly, hipster-y atmosphere. There is a good selection of breakfast food including rosti! I had the breakfast butty, which had a perfectly fried egg and a great mix of flavours, even without the cheese. Oh, they were super cool about my dairy allergy. I also had the rosti, because COME ON.

Coffee is good (free refills!!) and the service comfortably rides that line between making sure you have everything you need and leaving you the hell alone with your thoughts. There are a ton of interesting options on the menu, which ALMOST makes me wish that I needed to fix my car more often.

So it's a decent spot that isn't insanely busy on a Saturday morning. Check it out!"}
{"text":"What a waste. Place looks like a cool spot for breakfast, but that was it. There were about 4 tables, and 2 waitresses, and they waited like 15+ minutes before even asking us if we wanted a menu. They did however stare at us several times, yet never making the jump to offer us anything. After we took a menu from the table next to us that finished, we finally got to order. Once the food came, it took another 5 minutes to get silverware. Non-fresh squeezed OJ(Big letdown!), and food was terrible. I had the breakfast burrito and my tortilla shell was stale. My sisters goat cheese omelet was rancid, and my other sisters scrambled eggs had a very weird taste to them(unedible). Only meal that didn't get too many complaints was the over easy eggs, except the yolk was cooked. 

The weird thing was that the neighboring table's food looked so much better than ours. I don't understand, because we werent raudy or disrespectful or anything. We paid our bill, and left, and will never be back. Shame, because of the cool setting. Don't waste your money on overpriced breakfast!"}
{"text":"The food is worth the wait!! There are not many places were I am willing to wait to be seated to eat. But I will wait an hour or more at Morning Glory Caf√©.  Plus they have a lot for you to look at, buy, and see as you wait, so that helps. This gorgeous property not only has amazing breakfast, but they cater to many weddings and events. They have fresh produce and homemade goods to buy in their little shop. On some day's they have a little farmers market to come get their freshly picked produce that comes right off of their farms. 

But back to the food... I got the special that day. It was their CHILAQUILES:
Crisp tortilla with housemade roasted red and tomatillo salsas, two fried eggs, melted cheddar and Monterey Jack, pico de gallo and a drizzle of crema. Topped with shredded pork. The pork was a little sweet yet had a little spice, and was nice and tender. But my favorite part was the housemade roasted red and tomatillo salsas. I need an entire bucket of that so that I can put it on it on EVERYTHING, or drink it... whatever. It was so perfect. Sweet and tangy. Mmmm... 

I highly suggest putting this special on your regular menu. If not I hope you they take requests."}
{"text":"I think a great weekend starts with a great breakfast., ideally including a mimosa.  And I've not found a better place to have breakfast than Morning Glory Cafe.

The atmosphere is wonderful. It's quiet, laid-back, and beautiful. Morning Glory is set on a farm property near South Mountain. I found it easy to forget that I was still in the middle of a major metropolitan area.

And the food is excellent. I had French toast with apple butter and pecans. The thick slices of country bread were soft but never got soggy with syrup. I also had some locally made sausage, which had a delightful hint of spice that really offset the sweetness of the rest of the meal.

I would definitely recommend this place, especially on a nice spring or autumn morning."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem for breakfast.  My wife and I brought an out-of-town guest today. Arrived at 10 on a Friday morning and it was half full. Impressive. 

We were greeted quickly and given menus, which differ on weekdays from weekends: It's more limited. There were still plenty of choices tho. 

Our guest ordered the Farm Monte Cristo and coffee. My wife tried the Huevos Rancheros with coffee while I ordered the \"Pork is the New Black\" Omlette plus tea. 

Our brunches arrived in less than 10 minutes. Our guest commented on her Monte Cristo: \"Oh, it's not battered and fried\".  She liked the Farm version much better than the traditional one!  My wife enjoyed her Huevos as well. My plate was really well thought out: plenty of meats, cooked perfectly with a bit of char, eggs just right, cheesy, melted goodness on top and smothered in gravy. 

I highly recommend The Farm and the Morning Glory Cafe."}
{"text":"Breakfast was awesome!  We ordered goat cheese, Turkey sausage and tomatoe omelettes along with the French toast.  O.M.Goodness talk about scrumptious!  Hands down best French toast I've had in ages.  Can't forget the fresh squeezed o.j. and champagne to wash it all down with.  Very nice cozy place, pleasantly surprised by the outdoor seating but nice to sit out with the fresh air eating the oh so fresh food.  There's also a dinner restaurant that I will definitely try the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing. The staff is friendly and the food is awesome. Favorite breakfast place"}
{"text":"This place is good. The hours aren't very friendly so I dropped them down a star. The service is good with nice waitresses that are getting things done out in the cold/heat. The food is good I get the eggs Benedict and my hubs got the American breakfast. He liked it and so did I.. Depending on the time, and weather I will be coming back.

Downside- your outside under this huge tree and exposed to the elements. Including the animals as well. The tree sheds of course and may get on your food. Flies and Birds are around."}
{"text":"I love the farm and I love the Morning Glory Cafe. We had breakfast here today and it was fabulous. I had the french toast - yum yum yummy. My husband had the eggs benedict and he was happy as a clam. The food was very tasty and presented beautifully. I also had the fresh squeezed OJ, it was very tasty. My husband had the free refill coffee. I love the outside seating arrangement though it was a little chilly this morning. We let our toddler run and explore right outside of the restaurant area while we had our breakfast.  The menu is small, but I'm sure they make everything well, I'd rather have a small well done menu, than a menu with so many options the kitchen can't do it all well. I love that they source locally and I love that they are environmentally friendly. Right up my alley. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite brunch place it's a outdoor patio restaurant what makes it truly unique , it's pet friendly as well . Their food is all organic . I believe the only odd thing of this place is they do close during the summer due to our high heat . Other then that I give this place a 5 stars from service to location , service , food and amazing outdoor environment! One last thing don't get confuse there are a few eating places in the farm this one is the one in the back far end of the farm and only open until 1pm ."}
{"text":"got the vegetarian scramble with griddled bread.  medley of veges were fresh and topped with scrambled eggs drizzled with truffle oil.  truffle oil and eggs just go well together....and i liked how they plated it on thop of a small skillet.  breakfast was very peaceful..it was fun eating and hearing cows mooing..

drinks were self served unless you want a cocktail, etc
got myself some water but there were dirt in it so i didnt drink it...

parking was across the street so i had to walk along the farm to the restaurant which was tucked all the way inside.  it was very nice weather when i went..so it was a nice meal.."}
{"text":"In the middle of the big city it is really hard to find a peaceful outdoor space to escape. But now I know all I need to do is swing by Morning Glory and the rest of the farm. 

My group of 6 arrived at 10:30am for brunch on a Saturday. The place was PACKED! Always a good sign I say. We waited about 1/2 hour to get our table but time flew by with conversations and relaxing/taking in the scenery of the farm. Once seated we all pulled out pens and drew all over our butcher paper table cloth. Us 20/30 something year olds turned into 7 year olds drawing all over the table. 

Our service was great! For as crazy busy as they were everything came out tasting wonderful! I ordered up the eggs benedict. All of the egg dishes use the farms eggs from chickens you can see for yourself just a few yards away. Yum yum! I also got to sample some of my friends applewood smoked bacon. OMG! This bacon will make you drool for more! In her words \"They really smoke it with real apples!\" hehe One of the best parts of the meal that really impressed me was that they have a self serve station for water, tea and coffee. I liked not having to wait for our waitress to bring me more water or coffee I could just jump up and get it myself. 

Don't try to make this a quick stop for breakfast or brunch. Plan to spend the morning or afternoon there and take in the relaxing outdoors, the restaurant, farm and to local shopping just steps away. Enjoy and relax!"}
{"text":"I am yet again a failure at planning anything so when my boyfriend asked me where I wanted to go for brunch when we landed early in Phoenix, it was up to him to save the afternoon! He quickly found this place and it looked 10x better than anything I had book marked so we took our rental car here asap. 

Its kind of hard to find because its located in the back of the farm. There is no restaurant sign which is what we were looking for at first. There are a bunch of other restaurants on the premises but this was the only one that was busy the entire time.

20 minute wait on a Saturday afternoon. I think they messed up and let the guy after us get seated before but whatever. I grabbed myself an iced tea from the self serve section while we waited and shared it with my boyfriend teehee. The wait didn't seem long at all because we got to walk around the beautiful farm! 

I got the farm omelette and he got the pork is the new black omelette because I refused to let him get the same thing as me. Our order took FOREVER to come out. People that were seated at the same time/after us were pretty much done with their orders by the time ours came out. I think they must've forgotten our order or something wtf. Bastards. Our waiter Dexter kept reassuring us our order was on our way though.  

The biscuit was bomb! I am so happy our waiter offered us some jam because I pretty much loaded my entire biscuit with enough jam for the both of us. So noms. Totally worth the 500 buttery calories it probably was. I should've subbed the goat cheese in my omelette but I wasn't thinking. It came with cauliflower and carrots and all sorts of veggies I've never seen in an omelette before! 

All in all a perfect way to start off our little weekend getaway in Arizona!"}
{"text":"My standard order is eggs, toast and rosti.
The Good:
Eggs over easy are consistently cooked just right
$5.50 is a bargain
House made ketchup and jam
Front and back patio
Friendly service and parking is easy


The bad
Not open on Tuesday or Wednesday"}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Morning Glory in years, so decided to head down this morning for an early breakfast with our pup.  It was the perfect morning to sit outside and enjoy a fresh, flavorful and absolutely delicious breakfast.  Showing up on a weekday morning was the way to do it too...no wait whatsoever!  I ordered the egg white farm omelet with fresh veggies, goat cheese and fresh garden salsa with a side of country potatoes and a buttermilk biscuit topped with delicious strawberry jam...man, was that good!  This will definitely be added back to our regular rotation since the food is so tasty and the restaurant is pet friendly too.  Good service, great food and an absolute escape from the hustle and bustle."}
{"text":"My wife took me here on my birthday for breakfast and it was excellent.  The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.  It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better.

Do yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.

While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best \"toast\" I've ever had.

Anyway, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Coming from a guy who really doesn't love eating outdoor (most of the time its waaay too hot or \"too cold\" for Arizona people), this was better than amazing.

My girlfriend and I had the meal that comes with the eggs (farm fresh), bacon was as perfect as it could have been, potatoes were great, and the orange juice was tasty as well.

Cool place to walk your food down as well. Will DEFINITELY be back, soon."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend and dog came here on a Sunday morning at around 10:00. We were looking for some place new and fun to try and we came to the right place! Very cute place to get good food and some fresh air. There are chickens and big fields and lots of good picture ops, the wait was really long though we waited probably about an hour but it's nice to just walk around while u wait. When we did get in, we sat on the patio, I'm actually not sure if there was tables inside but there might have been. But our server (can't remember her name but she had dark hair and bangs) was really attentive, after waiting about an hour we already knew what we wanted. Their menu was decently sized and had something for everyone, I got the breakfast burrito and my boyfriend got the chiliquiles, and we got our dog a side of turkey sausage. it took about 30 mins to get the food out which to us wasn't bad because of how busy it was and how fresh the food was! It was very very good, just the right amount of spicey, pretty large portions I ate half and the side of potatoes and was perfectly full and had my other half to take home with me. The prices were fair considering how fresh the food is and the atmosphere and experience is definitely worth it. Although the drinks are self serve your server does put them on the ticket! Our bill came out to about $40 which I thought was a great deal. The only thing I recommend to this place was our table was right next to the restroom door and it was too close for people to get in and out. Also I was kinda terrified we were gonna get pooped on by the birds over head because the whole patio is pretty much covered with trees which is awesome but it would be great if they could get some umbrellas for the tables. Also the poor hostess at the front needs some buzzing table things to let people know their table is ready  or maybe a megaphone haha."}
{"text":"Fantastic Ambiance.
So so service.  I don't like that you have to get your own water.
Okay food.  I had some veggie/egg thing with truffle oil on top.  The best part was the turnips in it."}
{"text":"This small cafe in Corktown was a great weekday brunch place for my girlfriend and I. 

Only a few tables and some tables in the back parking lot. It's hot inside, so sitting outside was a great option. 

The service was friendly, and she never came to bother us while we were catching up on life. 

The menu consists of regular breakfast fare, along with some creative sandwiches on a hand rolled bun. 
I was disappointed that, although I love cheese and bread, I wanted to try to lay off the cheese and bread for today (if that makes any sense). However, everything on the menu (almost) was not gluten nor dairy free (granted, I did not ask for a gluten free version and perhaps I should have). 

We split two sandwiches and I could barely stuff it all in my mouth. The Western was an omlette with homemade garlic aioli and other mouthwatering goodness. The Monday special was bacon, brie, and onions (I added an extra egg). 

Our coffee was never ending and she always came out to refill for us. Our bill was $20 and out conversation was priceless ( haha)"}
{"text":"Beautiful country setting in Phoenix on an old farm. Watch closely because it is easy to miss as it is actually an old farm near the Legacy Golf resort at South Mountain. 
Very good home made breakfast with fresh ingredients from the farm. 
Orange juice was fresh and tasty. 
Eggs and bacon were very good. Biscuits and gravy were excellent. 
The setting was the star of this breakfast!
I would recommend ! You won't be sorry !"}
{"text":"When somebody says \"breakfast in Phoenix,\" this place instantly jumps to the top of my mind.

I'm always shocked when I hear that people have lived in Phoenix and never been here and some never heard of it. I suppose this truly is a \"hidden gem\" as people say. I generally make a point of taking any visiting friends or family here at least once. It really can't be beat; from the food, to the servers, to the whole ambiance, Morning Glory is top notch.

The entire place is outdoors, in the shade of large, beautiful trees. The food is made from fresh, local ingredients. Families and friends are sitting around enjoying the experience. People bike up, and some even bring their dogs. Local vendors can be seen at times selling honey, jam, oil, bread and music unobtrusively in the yard. You can even see and walk over to the gardens and chicken coops where some of the wonderful ingredients come from!

I hope this place never changes."}
{"text":"This is such a beautiful place, photo worthy and despite the reviews I read about the service not being great, I have to say I had a pretty good experience. We were greeted in about 3 minutes and after ordering, our food came out in about 15 minutes. The French toast was really tasty. They have a self serving drink station with water, coffee, lemonade and I believe there was also tea. I loved the environment +  it was baby friendly! We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Morning Glory Cafe is a hidden gem in the middle of south Phoenix.  While sitting in the cafe or garden waiting to be seated (it can be a while) the sounds of bird song fills the air and enticing aromas from the kitchen flow by teasing your nose and creating thoughts on what culinary delights will soon be filling your belly.  

The service has always been exceptional and the servers will always make sure you have a good experience.  One person that stands out in my mind as an example of how to keep things running smoothly is Cliff, he is the best!  He keeps the place cruising along at an unhurried, yet efficient pace with a calmness that is at the core of the experience The Farm offers.  

Give it a try if you haven't and keep coming back if you have.  This place is great for biking, bringing your well behaved dogs and just spending some quality time with family or friends."}
{"text":"Farm fresh food for decent prices? Yes please! Expect a long wait if you go on the weekends. Nothing fancy, just good, fresh food. Loved my Farm Omelet with seasonal veggies and goat cheese, biscuit was ok."}
{"text":"I'm all over the CSA idea and I feel like this is the next best thing.  We stumbled across this place on yelp and I'm so glad we tried it for breakfast.  It's breakfast on the farm!  

I had a omelette which I always shy away from because of overcooked, dried eggs - but there weren't at all.  I had a bite of their Monte Cristo - and since I never had one before - it was scrumptious.  They use fresh ingredients, mostly from their farm.  

Luckily we went on a Friday morning, as we heard the weekends get crowded.  Who would've thunk there'd be farms in the desert!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good food. Local food. Great breakfast place.

My favorite thing that I had was the bacon.

Service was great and it was a nice day outside. I felt like I was walking into a family reunion. It's definitely a place worth checking out."}
{"text":"the first time i dined here I was not that impressed but this mornings breakfast was excellent i had the monte cristo wife had eggs bene and our friend had the breakfast tacos which looked great as well service was  pleasant"}
{"text":"To begin, I really wish I could rate the food and the service separately. I would give the service a 1 and the food a 4. I had been wanting to go to The Farm at South Mountain for some time now and waited until the weather cooled down in order to go try out this place I have heard so much about. The organic farm, rose garden, picnic tables, shade trees, and the whole ambiance of the farm was wonderful. It was almost like we weren't in Arizona anymore. 
       As we approached the hostess she was clearly not the most patient of people. She stated that she was not going to wait long for people to come up to claim their table when she called their name. You practically had to run up there in order to get seated at your table, otherwise she swiftly moved down the list to the next name. I think allowing people a good 60 seconds to make it up to the hostess to claim their table sounds reasonable, don't you? To be fair, it was 12:30pm and I think they close at 1, but still...  She directed us to our table where we sat ourselves to view the menu. The server came over and promptly informed us that they were out of french toast, the Monte Cristo, and that you could not order bacon or sausage on the side. The only way you could get bacon or sausage is if you ordered an item on the menu that included it. Apparently they were almost out of that too! A bit ridiculous if you ask me. I ended up ordering the Blueberry Waffles which were absolutely phenomenal. The whipped cream on top was the best whipped cream I have ever tasted. My dining companion ordered the American Breakfast and asked for the eggs on the side, on an additional plate because he is allergic to eggs. Of course, the plate ended up coming out with the eggs on the plate with the rest of his food. Food allergies should be taken seriously. Obviously, the allergy note got lost somewhere along the line. I ended up eating his eggs, which were really great as well. I also tried the breakfast potatoes that came with his breakfast and found them well seasoned and very tasty. 
      My dining companion will not be returning to this restaurant. Normally after an experience like this I wouldn't either. I did really like the food & ambiance though, so I will probably give this place another try. I think I will come earlier so they don't run out of the french toast again! I really wanted to try that... I hope that I am able to revise this review in the future."}
{"text":"Wait time was horrible. Except the wait time everything is good. Food is good. Place is amazing. We live in North Phoenix so it's quite a drive from our place but worth it."}
{"text":"If  you're ever in the Phoenix area, this is a good place to have breakfast. And it looks like most locals go here too. I would've put 5 stars if not for the the tree leaves that keeps on falling on my breakfast plate as I eat.  It's an outdoor cafe, very  relaxed setting and serves great food. The eggs benedict are good and their biscuits as well. The service is fast!"}
{"text":"The first time I ate at Morning Glory Cafe, I was impressed; the second time I was less so. The Farm at South Mountain is a wonderful spot--a diamond in the rough. It has a broken-down rustic charm and is a great way to spend a Sunday morning or afternoon.

I'm disappointed to say that I'm disappointed with the Morning Glory Cafe. The service is just ok and unyielding (i.e. when my fiance asked for a side of chili the waitress said, \"no, we don't do anything like that here\", making it sound like an outrageous demand). And although I LOVE that the food is made from locally produced/grown animals/vegetables, it's a bit lacking in taste and high in price. $60 for one muffin, two breakfast plates, and tip? A little pricey for breakfast in my opinion.

Overall, the experience of the Farm at South Mountain is one you can't miss. My advice, though: bring a picnic. There are plenty of benches and picnic tables throughout the Farm."}
{"text":"Was visiting the area on business and specifically looked for a cafe with organic menu items.  The setting seems a world away from the city, but it took less than 10 minutes to get to the airport.  Parking signs direct cars to park across the street, so I did, but one can actually drive back to the Morning Glory Cafe.  I didn't mind the 4 minute walk as the grounds are beautiful.  I sat on the patio overlooking the gardens.  Since the waitress asked if I wanted something to drink, I assumed she would provide it.  She informed me that coffee, tea and lemonade were behind me and it was self serve.  No biggy - but all the cups were disposable, including clear plastic cups for water (not necessarily a huge deal if they didn't tout their recycling efforts and sustainability on the back of the menu).  The coffee was very weak... and I tried 2 different containers.  Boo! 

Service was good even with a packed patio.  They did use their farm ingredients in many of the dishes.  I ordered the white truffle scrambled egg & local veggie skillet, which came with sauteed cauliflower, peas, green beans, and a couple strips of spinach.  The veggies were fresh, but the dish lacked flavor.  Maybe I was expecting some fresh herbs or more seasoning?  

The setting is a 4, the service is a 3-4, but the food which is the most important part - a 3.  I would go back to try one of the other two restaurants.  Lunch on the picnic benches or a nicer dinner at Quiessence, with daily menu changes, sounds appealing."}
{"text":"This is a great place for quality, inexpensive breakfast and brunch 6 days a week (M-F 8am, Sat-Sun 9am-3pm -closed on Wednesday's). It is a small yet cozy cafe that can get filled up pretty quick at peak times. The staff are very friendly and helpful. My favourite is the 2 (overeasy) eggs, multi grain toast with potato rosti ($5.50) with a side of fresh jam. The eggs are always done to perfection. Also, when I am more in the mood for a healthy lunch dish I go with the Pan Bagna: Fresh greens, with a light drizzle of vinagrette, sundried tomatoes, black olives, vine ripe tomato, red onion and piave cheese served open faced on warm crusted ciabatta ($6.00). My only wish is that I lived next door so I could breakfast there more frequently.

{"text":"Came here for my birthday which was on a Wednesday in March. The weather was beautiful and breezy. There were some people but there were many open tables so we got right in. We also brought our little dog since we planned to go hiking after and wanted to bring her. It was nice to find a place to bring your four legged friend! Anyways, the first thing we noticed was the self serve coffee, water and lemonade. We actually liked this idea! The only thing that I had an issue with is that they don't mention that there is a charge for the lemonade. They really should have a sign or something that mentions this. While looking over the menu, we noticed that the trees above us kept shedding leaves which we really were not excited about getting into our meals when they arrived. The waitress was really nice and moved an umbrella over to shield us a little from the greenage dropping into our food. 
I decided on the monti cristo (over easy eggs, ham, and swiss cheese sandwiched between french toast with maple syrup) and my husband chose the cheese omelet with home fries. The monti cristo was soooo good. The only issue was that I noticed pieces of paper packaging still on my ham. It wasn't very much but it was a bit irritating having to peel little pieces of paper off of my ham! My husband was not impressed with his meal at all. He said the cheese on the omelet was nothing more than velveeta, the biscuit served with his meal was grainy and tough, and the home fries were not very flavorful. 
The prices were pretty high for breakfast and my husband said his breakfast didn't even fill him up. 
After breakfast, we walked around the farm a bit which was cool. The only thing we noticed was that there were no signs up next to each crop stating what they were. I would have liked to know what each was. 
To sum it up, it was a nice, peaceful atmosphere and I was happy that I could bring my little doggie. However, I didn't feel it was worth the price and being the fattie that I am, I really don't like to have distractions from eating my meals (leaves falling in my food, packaging on my ham...). I don't think we would go back unless our dogs wanted to go our for breakfast. Haha"}
{"text":"I wish i could give half stars, for me this is a 3.5 star place.  The location for morning glory is really nice.  Like everyone said, it is set on a farm and quiet.  It is all outdoor seating which was nice.  There were outdoor heaters set up so it wasn't cold. 

Everything is suppose to be organic, which I'm sure it was.  I can't tell the difference from real food and organic, I just like what taste good.  The food did taste good, but it wasn't anything special for me.   

I had the American breakfast.  Bacon tasted like bacon should.  Same with the eggs.  Came with baked potatoes which were ok, kind of bland.  There was no salt or pepper on the table. 

The wife had a monte Cristo.  That was good.  It used their French toast which by itself was good and as a sandwich was good.  You can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"This place is cute and cozy - decor and atmosphere are nice. I've been there twice and the food just doesn't cut it. On the recent visit for breakfast I had the omelette of the day and it was bland, flavorless and just plain average. 

The first visit in 2013 was disappointing in terms of service. But my most recent visit the service was very friendly and much more efficient.

Positives: nice touch with homemade ketchups and other condiments. Staff nice and friendly. Cute atmosphere.

Negatives: just not worth the price for average breakfast food."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quaint and scenic place to eat, this is perfect! Located at The Farm at South Mountain (along with 2 other dining options- The Farm Kitchen and Quiessence) It was a lovely experience. The food is good, service was good - it's worth a trip. The offer mimosas and bloody mary's too. They have a private table in back for romantic setting too, you have to call an reserve it."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the outside atmosphere with lushes trees, live chickens, and the lovely sitting wall. But I would only recommend this place for special occasions or times where you have all morning to grab a bite. The wait time was quoted at 30 minutes but it was really about 50 and the tables are not very comfortable once you're seated. You sit very close to the next table and the service is just ok- not spectacular. I would have enjoyed it more if they had additional shops or local stands out to look through! Beware of falling leaves while you eat though :p"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful atmosphere and delicious food. Our server was so sweet and went above and beyond to accommodate us. The beverages are self serve which is awesome. I wasn't super crazy about the roast of coffee that was being served, but that's pretty minor. I got a dish with a variety of fresh veggies cooked to perfection and the potatoes were on point. Such a cute place."}
{"text":"Everything was great here... Service, food, atmosphere, surroundings. Highly highly recommend, visitor or if you are a local. Make sure to go around the grounds and the shops."}
{"text":"Great! A little hidden gem! The Benedict is one of the best I've ever tasted! 

Also cute to walk around while you are waiting for the table!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok not worth the fancy price they charge and then everything is self serve no matter how busy.  Brisket was more fat than meat with the hash, omelet the meat was sparse very little cheese, eggs and tortillas was extremely basic.  No soft drinks and lemonade was not far from water with lemons for $2.25.  The farm setting was nice."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I had the farm omelette, which was made with spinach, fresh veggies from the farm, and goat cheese. The home potatoes were great, as well. Such a beautiful venue--you sit outside on a patio and look over the farm. My sister had the French toast and said it was wonderful."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely brunchy meal with some darling friends. We have fun trying new places every couple of months or so .. and Saturday's  adventure was the Farm.   Morning Glory  is a great little out of the way place .Seating is all outside and the view is near Maya's Garden and Quiescence. It has that \"local\" vibe , people are streaming in in their hiking and biking  clothes, families with kids and dogs in tow seem to have been here before.   We were quickly seated passing by a waitress with two platters with the French toast / Monte Cristo type sandwich . Big enough to feed a family of five..Holy Guacamole as my 2nd graders say. 
We settle in after getting ourselves  either tea, water or lemonade.. can't decide if i love or hate this... get your own beverage..  yeah I can get my own whenever I  want.... oh dang I got to get up again and get my drink ... 
I ordered the South Mountain Omelet which has the on site grown veggies from Maya's . Heavy on the zucchini   light on the goat cheese, very tasty.  A small but tasty biscuit came with it.   Friend enjoyed their egg sandwiches and all were happy and content. 

Light mental note --this is outside on a \"farm/garden\" there will be bright sun and we had a lot of flies. Off putting for some ..not us. 

Cute little place definitely going on my take mom here list. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Very nice venue but the food is only good and the prices are high for breakfast. Liberty Market is still heads and shoulders better in all departments save ambiance. This place is marginally more dog friendly because ALL of their seating is outdoors. 

If I was reviewing the food alone this place would get a solid two star rating. \"Meh\" perfectly describes everything we ate and drank. I had the monte cristo sandwich and it was... uninspired. Tasty but not $11 tasty. My Lady had one of their omelettes, it too was tasty but just not ZOMG fantastic. Their portions are small for a breakfast place and that's great, I just wish they'd charge a smaller amount to reflect that.  

 Still, it is certainly one of the nicest places to eat breakfast on a balmy Sunday."}
{"text":"The scenery was absolutely beautiful, the customer service was fun and had our food out in a timely manner. And for an outdoor area somehow they've managed to keep a majority of the flys and bees away, definitely a plus. Otherwise the food was fantastic, perfect portion for breakfast and all around delicious. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spots in the valley hands down! Food is delicious, reasonably priced, and service is quick and friendly! I had the Farm Burrito which was served hot and fast. The eggs were scrambled and served with refried beans, ham, and cheese wrapped in a homemade flour tortilla. The potatoes that accompanied this dish were superb! They were cooked up with some red and green bell pepper and onion."}
{"text":"Had the special of the day which was AWESOME. Really nice setting, you can walk around the gardens. Dogs are allowed so thats a huge plus! Worth the time to check out. Went with my family and everyone loved their meal."}
{"text":"This is a little hipster-style cafe, really popular in the area. I tried a cottage cheese omlette which was not the greatest, it was plain with no flavour ar all. However, will probably give this place a second chance when in the area. Their service is fast, and if you are paying with card and need machine don't wait for the server, you need to get up and pay on the counter."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Quiessence, so of course, I think the quaint farm setting at Morning Glory is lovely, and I truly enjoy the cuisine of Chef LaPrad (for those of you who don't know, both restauarants are on the same farm premises and LaPrad is at the head of them).  Needless to say, the food is far superior & fresher than your standard breakfast diner fare.  It is also better than many other Valley breakfast stalwarts, such as Matt's Big Breakfast (which is quite tasty, but pretty greasy and their menu is nowhere near as creative or interesting as Morning Glory's).  

The omelette I ate there a few days ago was, as ever, wonderful - the combination of fresh veggies with goat cheese and home made salsa verde was delicious.  That said, I was very disappointed when I visited this weekend, mostly on two accounts:

1.  The orange juice was not freshly squeezed; it was the Minute Maid style stuff most restaurants bring in pre-made.  This one surprised me because on my first visit to Morning Glory  the OJ was freshly made and natural.  This is a serious pet peeve I have with breakfast places - all too often at other places, servers nod and smile when you ask if the orange juice is freshly squeezed, only to bring you the usual packaged stuff one finds at the supermarket fridge.  It isn't that hard - were the oranges physically squeezed in the back or not?  For a place like Morning Glory that prides itself on organic ingredients, fresh produce, etc, there is no excuse to be serving this kind of OJ.  It's pathetic, and anyone can easily  discern the difference.  If I wanted this kind of juice, I would've gone to a corporate breakfast diner chain like Denny's or Ihop.  Come on.

2.  No pancakes on the menu, which was aparently tinkered with.   I'm pretty certain I had eaten pancakes here before....with them being such a fundamental breakfast classic, I can't figure out the warped reasoning behind not having them on the menu now.

Forget the pancakes....it's not a choice I would have made, but fine.  The orange juice issue, however, tells me their standards are beginning to slip, so I'd be careful if I was the manager.  This is how any restaurant's downward spiral starts: with complacency and lax standards.  I hate giving them a lukewarm review, but other than that, still a solidly recommended place."}
{"text":"Feeling like breakfast on a farm?
This is the place.

The scenery is picturesque.  I heard birds singing in the trees, horses neighing in the background & the sun was shining through the trees.  WHAT.  WHERE AM I.  This is not the South Mountain I am used to... thankfully.  This place is a little escape... a farm oasis in the middle of the desert.  Me gusta.

i had the South Mountain Omelette.  It had lots of tasty seasonal veggies, goat cheese & a little zing of green chile sauce.  I also opted for the seasonal fruit... glad I did.  Everything was so fresh.  I left feeling satisfied & happy, not overly stuffed like I do at most greasy breakfast places.  You know the ones.

Coffee, tea & water are self-serve.  I like that.  A lot.  Our waitress was very sweet.  A little boy ran out into the gardens & one of the farmers gave him a little squash.  What??  Is this real life???  I didn't think places like this still existed but I am so happy that they do.  :)"}
{"text":"Cute little neighbourhood joint. We ended up here after deciding the lineup at le petit dejeuner was much longer than we were willing to wait. Food was ok. Service was fast and efficient. Found the rosti to be a bit bland. Nothing to write home about but loved the fact that we got seated right away during prime brunch time on a Sunday."}
{"text":"We had a delightful breakfast here.  Be sure to pull into 'The Farm' and drive to the back.  We passed it up the first time around and then parked across the street before realizing we could have driven inside to a small parking lot.  
We then had a long walk through gardens and trees but it was nice.

Once there it was peaceful outdoor seating under the trees with birds chirping.  The food was absolutely delicious!  My husband thought his Eggs Benedict were there best he ever had.  The eggs were perfectly done.  I had the Monte Cristo French Toast which was great.    It was get your own drink service but the food was brought out to you.  The amount of food was ample as well so the leisurely walk back to the car was welcomed.

This was a little country oasis in the midst of the city.   If we are in Phoenix again around breakfast or brunch time, we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Good place but I am a breakfast lover and would say that it's worth going to but not the place I would make my regular hangout.  We came here twice in a three week span and had two very different experiences.  The first time was mid morning on the weekend.  Very busy as you would expect as it is very popular.  Don't necessarily park across the street and walk all the way up the gravel road.  There is typically a couple few spots right by the place so drive the gravel road and park.  The wait was an hour but we were ok with that because we wanted to try it.  We had the eggs benedict, over medium eggs and home made sausage, and shared the blueberry waffles with vanilla whip cream.  All very good.  The coffee and drinks you get yourself on the back counter.  The service was relatively good the first time even though you could tell she didn't want to be there.

The second time we arrived later on the weekend, still busy, but only a 15 minute wait.  Cool.  We ordered the blueberry waffle again, ham and cheese omelet, and the over medium eggs with bacon this time.  Get the sausage, the bacon was thin and greasy.  This time the server tells us 2 minutes before the food is delivered that they ran out of whip cream for the waffles.  We're like, ok fine.  I'll tell you what, they are much better with that vanilla whip cream.  The omelet looked like they ran out of cheddar cheese too because there was none inside and on top just a sprinkle, strange.  The server was a nice kid but absolutely didn't want to be there and wasn't attentive at all.  Not too mention the table was FUBAR'ed.  No exaggeration, if you pushed on the table table top with two fingers you could flip a drink over because it swayed a foot either way.  Nice.  Look, we were gentle with the table, didn't complain, just wanted the same food from the time before.  Not the case. 

Also, don't forget this is outdoor.  So keep that in mind if you don't like the outdoors.  Very pretty area."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful breakfast here! Friendly staff! Chicken Enchiladas were amazing! Love that the food is locally sourced! Our 3 year old enjoyed running around the grounds and checking out the chickens!  If your in the area this is a great spot!"}
{"text":"Went to the Farm at South Mountain and ate at Morning Glory Caf√© for breakfast on a Saturday it wasn't too busy. I had the Challah Bread French Toast and my Husband had the eggs benedict. Both were amazing. The French toast comes with 3-4 pieces of bread, topped with butter, bananas, raisins and syrup. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. The farm is so secluded and serene you won't know you are 10 minutes from sky harbor airport, totally another world."}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwich in the city. Without a doubt. It's perfect!

I usually get the breakfast butty or the Jimmy screech. They're all similar, really. All good. You can modify your sandwich too. But regardless of what you order, they're all perfect. Perfect bun, perfect flavour. I love this place."}
{"text":"Very disappointing went for breakfast, but they are closed until September 21st. Yelp said they were open."}
{"text":"In my past career life, I worked near South Mountain and during my lunch hour, I eagerly searched for cuisines to peak my interest. I'd overhear coworkers chatting about a \"farm\" and I wondered if I possibly worked with a bunch of former farmers? Then I stumbled past the Farm one day and experienced Morning Glory Cafe for the first time. That first time turned into many many more visits and I still try to make my way to the south side from time to time. 

Burgers. Yes, I do like burgers. It's an all American cuisine so therefore I don't think I should be judged. Well, the Morning Glory Cafe burger is tastilicious. It's so good I had to combine two words. The breakfast is scrumptious and they have a tasty brunch as well. Full of fresh ingredients, each item on the menu has its own unique taste. And the baked goods. Oh my baked goodness. Try the scones. 

The atmosphere is adorable and filled with character. Hidden in the middle of a \"farm\" you could pass by this little gem in the desert and never realize it was just past the main road. Whenever I enter, I feel like I've left Arizona and I've been transported to a little farm in California. I love the quaint feel the Morning Glory Cafe gives me. It isn't a big and open restaurant full of hustle and bustle. Instead, it's a small and intimate setting and I feel like I am having lunch at a friend's home on a Saturday afternoon. It was the perfect escape from the work day. Oh and I could get in and out and still make it back within the hour. 

So if you're ever in the vicinity of South Mountain and looking for a little escape from desert reality, give Morning Glory Cafe a try."}
{"text":"An hour long wait and two bites of vegan brunch. It was so bad, we had to bail. Shocked that this place was so disappointing. They brought mine out and took an additional 30 minutes for my girlfriends. We sat for an hour waiting. When it finally arrived, she took a bite and it tasted so badly that she tried another and said \"I can't do anymore\". We had just paid $20 a plate but took our loses and bailed."}
{"text":"Stop and smell the SUNSHINE and a hearty Brunch!  This is such a wonderful outing and the service is stellar.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast, fresh ingredients, friendly staff.

Daddy like."}
{"text":"I agree with Jessica F. I keep trying to love this place but there are other breakfast spots that I prefer -- save the ambiance. You really cannot beat The Farm setting. 

The breakfast tacos are good but (and the menu description says this) they come in HARD taco shells.

Definitely consider this spot to kick off a romantic, relaxing day and for out of town guests."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. Really fresh food and a really great view. I would assume all food prepared comes from the farm that you are eating at. Sure taste like it! Its great that they do pick up orders as well, i work down the street and when i have to be at the office on saturday/sunday mornings this is my go to place"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places to eat. But that was when I weighed 200 lbs. Now I follow a very low carb diet, and there is not much on the menu for me. The omelette automatically comes with potatoes and a biscuit. They have NO low carb options to substitute for carbs, and the waitress acted like I had asked her for a bar of gold when I asked if they could do sliced tomatoes instead of potatoes. They could not, by the way, because tomatoes aren't in season. Despite the fact that I had told her I cannot have carbs, she offered fruit, which--duh--is carbohydrate too. I expect people who serve food for living to actually know that! They also didn't offer to charge me less for my meal and leave off the carbs, nor did they suggest any other substitutions. Bottom line, if you have special dietary needs, don't bother with this restaurant. It's the only one in the valley that has NOT been helpful in accommodating my diet, and no omelette is worth $10.95 without at least a side of something. The price of the coffee was outrageous as well, $2.75 for plain jane coffee, and not a packet of Splenda on the premises. They also ran out of coffee. Give me Starbuck's any day, for that price! As for atmosphere, we were seated under a tree that kept dropping crap on our table, hair, and food. The waitress forgot to bring the OJ my companion ordered--all the other drinks were self serve buffet style, meaning you got to stand around in a line and wait to serve yourself. Morning Glory is definitely no place I will go again."}
{"text":"Super impressed by the area it made me forget I live in Arizona. The restaurant is seating outside only, but it wasn't as hot as you would think. There was breeze and I think it was because of the trees and grass. It really is a beautiful place to sit down and relax.

The food was SUPER delicious! I had the green enchiladas with egg and potatoes on the side. Every bite was better than the next! My friend had the farm omelette with egg whites and I had a taste as well. The taste was fresh and the goat cheese gave it that extra yum flavor. I also had a mimosa that was good, but a little overpriced for the size and there was nothing special about it. They also have a self serve station for water, tea, and coffee which I thought was a cute unique touch to the restaurant. 

Another plus was the customer service super friendly people. I will be back for sure to try one of their many other menu items."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! I had the breakfast sandwich and it was delicious! You have to get the biscuits too. Everyone loves their food and the staff was friendly and helpful. We came on a Sunday morning around 9am and had to wait a little. We stopped by before heading to the airport and they were so kind and let us store our luggage in the store. The store is super cute and they had live music! This farm is a must before leaving Scottsdale and I'm so happy we did!"}
{"text":"I have loved Morning Glory cafe for YEARS. The grounds are beautiful and while I've eaten at all three of the restaurants at the Farm I love the Morning Glory Cafe most of all because I can sit in the grass nearby while I wait for a table to become available (yes, there will be a wait, especially on weekends) and I feel like I'm not in the dusty Arizona desert anymore. 

I've also come to MGC for Mother's Day for two of the past three years and it's almost become a tradition for me and my daughter. However, this last Mother's Day really (really) disappointed me. 

When I arrived we were told there was an hour wait. OK... No problem. I was expecting that (at least) and any other decent place would have a similar wait on Mother's Day. However, the issue was bigger than just the hour wait - the hostess who was calling people's names off the waiting list had such a faint voice that I couldn't hear her call my name - even though we were sitting right in front of her and I had gone up to ask her 10minutes prior if our table was ready. (You would think she would recognize me if I had just gone to talk to her and was sitting right in front of her but she seemed either clueless or overwhelmed).  As a result - we were passed up and FOUR other tables were seated before us. After figuring out we had been passed up I went back again and asked if our table was ready and the hostess didn't even apologize. I'm sorry but when you have over 50 people waiting at a time for their table, you can't put someone with the voice of a 9 year old in charge of calling names. I understand it's a farm and a loudspeaker would kill the ambiance but at least get a better system in place for making sure people get seated after they've waited so long for a table. 

Finally we were seated, and drinks were self serve so we immediately got water/coffee. The wait staff was completely frazzled at this point in the morning. They were stopping at tables for no longer than 2min at a time and making beelines between tables and the kitchen so you couldn't even get their attention without causing a scene. 

We ordered a good 15min after being seated even though we knew exactly what we wanted to order. An HOUR later we still didn't have our food and my 5 year old daughter (who normally has to be bribed to eat) started crying. I asked her what was the matter and she said \"I'm so hungry!\" Not exactly the kind of thing a mom wants to be dealing with on Mother's Day. It was so sad the table next to us started offering us food off of their plates to give to my daughter (how embarrassing).  The waitress walked by a few times and I said \"Is our food almost ready? We've been waiting over an hour.\" Her response was \"Yeah, so has everyone else\" and walked away. 

Finally I called our waitress back and I said \"We ordered a cup of fruit. Can you at least bring that? My daughter needs to eat something.\" She came back with the fruit cup which my daughter inhaled and about 15min later we had our actual breakfasts (which were very good and well-made as always. Food never disappoints here).  I will say, that to \"make up\" for the wait, they gave us a complimentary dessert which was a nice gesture in the end but the whole experience has made me question whether I will go back for any special occasions. 

Reason being - I've noticed the Farm grow in popularity over the years but there hasn't been any real improvements to their service. They still run the place as though they are getting the same amount of traffic as 5 years ago and that is obviously not the case anymore. 

They could have done a better of job of getting us seated at the right time - or of getting a snack for my daughter if they knew the main breakfast was going to take longer than normal - or of telling us when we put our name on the list: \"it's an hour wait for a table and another hour wait for food to be served\" - so we could make a better decision as to whether we should stick around. 

They need to find a way to keep it low key and quaint without putting people through the kind of experience we went through. Maybe a reservation system is needed for breakfast? Limit the number of guests? Idk, but they certainly shouldn't just leave people to wait over 2.5 hours to have their first meal of the day - especially when the majority of patrons in the mornings are families with young kids. 

Again, isolated incident, but can't say that their seating system or wait staff are any more organized on other days of the year. Wait times for a table can be up to 30-45min on any weekend but normally food does NOT take over an hour to arrive. 

Note: they have a separate Mother's Day brunch that you can purchase advance tickets for, and those have scheduled seating times. I have never taken that option because my daughter typically doesn't eat a lot and it would be a huge waste."}
{"text":"Parking options limited. Outdoor seating only. Get a table w/ an umbrella for shade and protection from falling tree things. Service was slow and we spent 2.5hr total here (for two ppl). Food was delicious. I had the omelette and the gravy made all the difference. Potatoes were tasty. Bloody Mary was okay. The strawberry jam was excellent. Would I return? Yes - if I had nothing else to do and was willing to sacrifice 2+ hrs of my day."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Peter Cetera - Glory of Love)
Today it's very clear, as we're both eating here, 
there's so many things I want to try
I will always review it, I will never leave you alone. 

Sometimes I just forget, try things I might regret, 
just break the eggs and I'll have it over easy. 
I don't want to lose the yolk, 
I could never eat it alone

I am a foodie who will try all your dishes,
I can give you a review you're dreaming of. 
We'll brunch forever, knowing together 
that we ate it at the Morning Glory Cafe!

Morning Glory Cafe is one of the gems hidden in South Phoenix area.  It's literally a huge garden and picnic area.  Perfect for a day outing with the family and friends.  I usually go after a hike at South Mts. since its right down the street or around the area.  Walking past the picnic area and organic gardens you wouldn't think you're actually in Phoenix; except if it's super hot out!  

Brunch!  My favorite meal of the day when I can get it!  This time around I ordered their Eggs Benedict, which they called the Morning Glory Benedict.  Poached eggs, spinach, and ham on two muffins with hollandaise sauce; seems pretty simple, but damn I love it!  Also free self serving lemonade and ice tea -- load up!  

There's something about having brunch right outside over viewing the farm and picnic like scenery.  It's relaxing yet you feel connected with the natural setting.  Someone pinch me.....Ouch!  Okay back to my office....sigh!  

Needless to say, Morning Glory Cafe, if I could sing like Peter Cetera that's my anthem to you.  The place is sweet and cute.  No mimosas this time around, but look for me on the next round! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The morning we visited was a bright and sunny one.
It was a perfect day for an outside breakfast. We were their first guests
at five til the hour.
    Taylor was our high energy server and she seemed so excited that
her words came fast.
    The Back to the Roots dish was an amazing medley of yummy veggies with scrambled eggs on top. There were carrots, onions, yellow squash, zucchini, bell peppers, mushrooms, broccoli, and cauliflower. This came with O'Brien potatoes and a biscuit.
     The All American came with scrambled eggs, thick bacon, and potatoes with a biscuit. I added some serious sausage gravy to make my biscuit perfect.
   The ambiance here is unique and enjoyable.
To reach this place, turn into a dirt road with a sign for the Farm then drive back as far as you can. There's parking on the left.
   It's said that the restaurant will be slammed by 9:30 AM and I can see why.  This is not an inexpensive place but it is the place for good food and a neat environment."}
{"text":"Took one look at me and seated us by the restrooms.  I expected that.  Eh.  The food was delivered quickly, the waitress was on point and I enjoyed my Eggs Benedict.  It is Oct  so eating outdoors is perfect.  Really liked this place."}
{"text":"The Monday Classic is one of the best sandwiches on earth. But everything I've ever had here has been excellent. Service is generally pretty good."}
{"text":"This is a perfect Sunday brunch spot to enjoy outside weather with exceptional food. When you're waiting for your table, you have the opportunity to walk around the farm where various wedding venues are stationed and a fun gift shop. 

For brunch, check out the Monte Christo and chicken enchilada morning special!"}
{"text":"Great place for someone like me who misses the farming community of rural Vermont.  Great breakfast options.  Downside?  Get your own beverages (Coffee, juice, water, tea, etc.)..."}
{"text":":( I really wanted to like this place. I thoroughly enjoyed the farm, but I will review it separately. We were greeted by a busy waiter who quickly pointed to self-serve drinks (coffee, tea, water and lemonade) and ran off. We helped ourselves to some coffee and lemonade before we received our menus which stated that each drink was $2.75. I ordered the white truffled scrambled egg skillet (white truffles are my fave). I did not detect one bit of truffle essence in this dish. My fiance ordered the Cowboy Breakfast. It was like watered down chili with and egg on top. No great. The concept is great, but the way in which the food is prepared is super disappointing."}
{"text":"If I was rating the food alone, I would give them 4 stars. But unfortunately the service we experienced was horrible. 

I ordered the smoked trout board and subbed roasted veggies instead of the bagel. My dish was wonderful and I'd highly recommend it. 

The service, however, will keep me from returning. 

We expected to wait before we arrived, so that was no surprise. We had a party of 6 and a baby, which is already difficult with a restaurant that doesn't take reservations, and Morning Glory tends to run long wait times. We made the best of it and enjoyed some mimosas while wandering around the grounds and enjoying each other's company. 

They gave away the first table to a group who had been waiting for less time than us. Once we got to our table, it felt like we were an afterthought to our server. She rarely checked on us and didn't seem to care about our experience. The food took a very long time to come out, some of which didn't actually ever come out, and then our bill took over a half hour. They tacked on automatic 20% gratuity, which we felt was a bit absurd considering our experience

If you're thinking of coming here for brunch, consider going elsewhere or just ordering takeout instead."}
{"text":"I was here with a friend this morning - yummy.  It's pretty quaint, was lucky enough to arrive as someone was leaving - so total wait time was all of 5 minutes, if that.

Had some fab breakfast sandwich thing with the egg baked into the bread with a side of rosti.  My gf had the same, sans ham.  Also delish from what I understand.  Was totally seduced by the orders arriving at tables around me.

Sundays are pretty busy, but free street parking and the nice staff will keep me coming back :)"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a romantic setting or a special occasion. Took my friend and mother here for Mother's Day. A very relaxed environment with live music and food is really good. Ate the \"Morning Glory Cafe\" for Brunch."}
{"text":"After going to a FABULOUS Yelp event (OYE at The Q /Quiessence) I waited for the opportunity to revisit The Farm at South Mountain. With out-of-town guests wanting to meet for breakfast the perfect timing arose. 

Just pulling onto The Farm I felt transposed into another place and time. With a farmers market and artists exhibits surrounding me I headed for The Morning Glory Cafe'. The staff was so accommodating (giving driving directions to my lost party), friendly and engaging. 

The menu selections ranging from Omelette's, Eggs Benedict and glorious muffins my taste buds were perked. Whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner try this haven - you will be so happy you did."}
{"text":"Our local treat for breakfast on the weekend. It's usually a bit of a wait after you order, but it's well worth it. 

The sammys and breakfast is delicious.  A nice homemade touch on everything (you must try the homemade ketchup.  It's out of this world and I loooove ketchup). 

The service can be slow but so don't go if you're in a rush.  

All in all, super cute and delicious food."}
{"text":"Beautiful outdoor cafe where I am finally okay with going somewhere filled with families and aren't bothered. Seriously though, PHX area is overflowing at the brim with families out to eat everywhere so it was awesome to find a delicious, fresh, local breakfast option where I wouldn't lose my mind over all the screaming children. While MGC does cater to families each table feels secluded and you can take in the nature and beauty of the farm, not to mention eat and chat in peace. Another reason for picking MGC is their use of local sustainable ingredients. As a vegetarian I think its really important to support local farmers so I am happy to see this trend picking up in AZ. I enjoyed the white truffle egg skillet with local veggies, it was phenomenal. Being veg I can sometimes get shafted by just eggs and toast dishes or the occasional bland omlette but this dish was so flavorful and full of deliciously chopped veggies (I know I saw some potatoes, cauliflower, bell pepper and green onion to name a few). I would considering bumping my fav breakfast dish 'eggs florentine' down a notch for this skillet."}
{"text":"Love this place!   Ate here with out of town guests.  I had been here years ago and forgot how nice it is.  Of course, over time they have really made it even nicer than I remembered.  Food great.  Atmosphere wonderful.   We went mid-week to avoid the crowds.  I'm sure this place must be mobbed on weekends.  I'm not a crowd person nor do I like waiting long for a table.  As such, I only go to places either very early in the day or on weekdays to avoid being frustrated as some posters have mentioned.  The crowds mentioned speak to the greatness of this place in my opinion.  Will go again in a couple of weeks with other guests.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Monte Cristo French Toast was yummy but coffee was not good. Watch out for small leaves falling from the trees above and make sure you get a lid for your drinks."}
{"text":"An unusual breakfast place for Phoenix. Surrounded by greenery and covered by shade; dining here offers a good degree of seclusion and peace, despite being very near to the city's core. We were seated right away and treated to noticeably kind service. The food was made with what tasted like quality ingredients, and in the end, we left as very happy customers."}
{"text":"Was here for a Breakfast Club UYE.  What a wonderful setting for breakfast.  Not many menu choices but we all found something to eat and nobody had any complaints about how it came.  Our waitress was very nice.  After our meal several of us strolled around the farm grounds."}
{"text":"Great Place to have a Breakfast in the morning. We sitting outside under the Trees. Delicious America Breakfasts."}
{"text":"Went to the Morning Glory Caf√© with the Breakfast Club UYE and had been excited to try this place out for a while. Morning Glory Caf√© is down at The Farm at South Mountain, if you haven't been, you really sound go, it's such a beautiful place, it was a perfect breakfast spot!

After we were seated we were told that we can get our own tea, coffee, water, which was easily accessible. I ordered the Farm Burrito , scramble eggs, tepary beans, chorizo & cotija cheese in a flour tortilla served with farm home fries! That was a delicious breakfast burrito and the home fries where yummy too!

I truly enjoyed my experience at Morning Glory, it's a beautiful spot within the Farm and look forward to coming back to try out more of their breakfast items!"}
{"text":"Coming from California and found this beauty on Yelp. I, along with four others, went on a busy Saturday morning and the hostess sat us down immediately. Our waitress Taylor was amazing. We got the hot cocoa, mimosas, self serve coffee, the farm burrito, French toast, the special of the day, and Julia's enchiladas. Everything was delicious but the overall table favorite was Julia's enchiladas."}
{"text":"I was here over the weekend with friends. It's a nice small cafe in a neighbourhood full of expensive furnitures hops. We had to wait briefly for a table. (Well, my friends did; I arrived late.) The staff were friendly enough. The other patrons were also really friendly. It seemed like everyone knew everyone else. The whole place had a very nice vibe to it. Anyway, the food is great. My friends got sandwiches, I got a regular-ass breakfast. Everything tasted pretty damn good. The Agent 99 sandwich in particular is worth checking out. It's definitely a place i'd go back to, which I can't say for half the brunch places that have popped up in the city."}
{"text":"Based on all the positive reviews I was looking forward to having my birthday brunch here.  In the end, it was quite a disappointment.

We had a reservation for 10 people, plus two infants.  When we arrived, on time, they had given our table to a walk-in party of 11 and told us we would need to wait.  After asking to speak with the manager and several conversations later, plus 30minutes of waiting, they tried to seat us at an 8-top.  There was no way we would all fit, so after all this, they dragged another table over so we could all comfortably sit. 

The waitress was nice and it wasn't her fault, but other than that, the experience was not a good one.  The food was mediocre at best, they charged us for the drinks (coffee, lemonade and tea) that they have set up and tell you to help yourself but never mention the price!  The owner was there and knew what had happened with our reservation and never said a word to us.

All in all, I would NOT recommend this place at all!  Sad, because the location is beautiful."}
{"text":"Very friendly family owned breakfast spot! Open Monday-Friday6:00a-3:00p. Limited menu & I got the Denver omelette which was yummy but they don't offer hash brown, home fries or potatoes of any kind.  They offered sliced tomatoes instead of toast for this gluten free girl! I will be back!"}
{"text":"If you're into nature and good food, you've got to check this farm out. The food is great, staff are friendly and abundance of greenery!

This place is good for dating, family gathering, little inspiration, or lone time. There's enough seats outside with shades."}
{"text":"This is such a great breakfast brunch cafe (on the grounds of The Farm at South Mountain) surrounded by all the beautiful plants and vegetables they grow. It is also one of the more beautiful outdoor patios on this side of town.  

 I work down the street and was craving one of their yummy egg burritos. Stopped in to order to go and out! I do recommend coming when you can sit and enjoy the outdoors. Everything on their menu is worth a try. Come early though! They close at 11am!"}
{"text":"The best word to describe this place is 'Charming'.  I love sitting on the patio, enjoying breakfast while enjoying the atmosphere of the trees and the singing birds.

The breakfast is fantastic.  Today I had the chicken enchiladas with 2 over easy eggs on top and green chile verde.  I think the tortillas are homemade.  So good. 

If you like chicken fried steak, they have it as a special every now and then, and it is the best I have ever had.

They close for the summer, but we will be back in the fall.

Only negative thing is that they have SO many good dishes, it's often difficult to decide what you want, especially when you're hungry!!"}
{"text":"\"Hi there. Do you have high chairs?\"
\"No. We don't have high chairs.\"
\"Um, ok thanks. Bye.\"

Not family friendly. 

How sad."}
{"text":"Excellent locally sourced food. I ordered the delicious breakfast burrito which was too big for me to finish. The ambiance is amazing as you sit under large mesquite trees in a very welcoming environment. There is only seating outside, but they have a number of outdoor heaters to keep you warm. In the late Spring and Summer, I'm sure the shade trees make it a nice reprieve from the heat. The staff is very friendly and accommodating making suggestions on drinks and menu items. I like the self-serve drink stations so that you don't have to wait for coffee. If you're visiting Phoenix, don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Loved breakfast here this morning. A little hard to find, but worth the effort. My husband had the special, and I had the farm burrito. Everything tasted incredibly fresh and homemade. Good coffee and delicious freshly squeezed oj. I loved the beautiful scenery too. We would absolutely come here again."}
{"text":"I like the concept of eating at a farm.  And Morning Glory brought that concept to reality.  The food was fresh.  But I felt it was a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"plan on spending couple hours exploring. Totally worth the visit. You can park in front or back and get to cafe very easily. Beautiful place. Food was filling, I had biscuit and gravy plus bacon and oj. My friend had back to your roots meal and everything came out perfectly. Staff was friendly and environment was lovely. Greeted well and left happy. :)"}
{"text":"This is our go to breakfast spot. Great food, good atmosphere.  Small place, tends to be a long wait time on the weekend so get there early! There were three of us today and we were forced to sit in a two seater. The one waitress said she'd give us the table next to us but the other waiter gave it to another couple. A bit of an inconvenience but it's usually not an issue."}
{"text":"After having to park across the street, lugging our stroller and baby all the way we barely made it before they closed. We were denied a table and watched other folks get called off the wait list... some of whole ended up being no shows. We asked again if they could squeeze us in but there denied us again."}
{"text":"Great spot, perfect place to bring anyone! My only gripe is it is ALWAYS busy. Plan on waiting at least 15-30 minutes for a table, ESPECIALLY on the weekends."}
{"text":"1. enjoyed brunch with mom and dog
2. a lovely morning place just gorgeous and wouldnt even know it was in this area
3.  got coffee while we waited for seat sat in the quiescence area. just lovely outside
4. side note have to come for dinner, drink by the fire pit outside
5. had mamosas and french toast, mom had bloody mary and spinach and eggwhite omelet--mine was awesome
BLOODYMARY TOO SPICY and egg white omelet was bland-otherwise we BOTH AGREE WE STILL LOVE the atmosphere!
6.walked around and noticed SPA AREA, ART GALLERY, homegrown veggies, and even wine TASTING  party nov 22"}
{"text":"1 hour for breakfast food is unacceptable. And that is 1 hour from when we ordered it. Not to mention the 8 minutes it took for a server to greet us after we had sat down. Been here twice now, both times good was mediocre at best. Service 1st time was ok and this time was terrible. Rude, unfriendly and unapproachable. As cute as the whole farm is sadly we won't be back or recommending this place to anyone. 

The chilaquiles said red & tomatillo (green) sauce, only got green. Nothing mentioned by the server if that was okay. Home fries side was suppose to come with the peppers and onions, and there was none, just a plate of over seasoned and not crispy home fries. Don't waste the time."}
{"text":"I was far too embarassed about my first visit to the Morning Glory Cafe to do a proper yelp.  My advice: don't take vitamins on a empty hangover stomach then allow your breakfast buddy to order really jiggly Eggs Benedict.  Every bump to the table was pure torture for hypersensitive gag reflex. But despite my unflattering visit to restroom trailer, I absolutely loved the food and knew I would be back.

Today I managed to convince my husband to go to the Farm for breakfast, which is a minor feat in and of itself.  But I am happy to report that the breakfast was just as awesome as I promised my hubby that it would be.
- The setting is beautiful, green, and soothing
- The beverages are far above average.  Coffee that doesn't get bitter as it cools and freshly squeezed orange juice.
- The staff is friendly and wonderful.
- The meal comes out ridiculously quick.  It makes me wonder what takes so long at other breakfast joints.  
- The food is divine.  The omelets are the best omelets I have ever eaten with fresh ingredients from the farm within sight of our table.  We even heard the chickens while we were sitting there because it was early and the restaurant was nearly empty.  The rosemary potatoes are perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The hubby was equally impressed with his simple breakfast of eggs, bacon and pancakes with real maple syrup.  He even noticed that the portion size was perfect and that substandard breakfast restaurants compensate for mediocre meals with a greater quantity of food.
- The meal is a bit pricey for breakfast, but I didn't mind one bit.  I can't afford regular visits but I really wish I could.  We paid $37 for two meals, two coffees and 1 screwdriver (not on the menu, but they have the ingredients).
- I do have one complaint, but I'm not sure if it's really a complaint or just a personal preference.  I hate biscuits.  They taste like dehydrated unbaked dough and I have no idea why any human would willingly eat one.  Morning Glory Cafe's biscuit is as horrible as any other I have tried.  Maybe for you biscuit-eaters out there it may actually be decent.
- I felt like a humungous dork for doing this, but we talked about the breakfast for hours.  It was incredibly tasty and we kept discussing it to verify that we both experienced this perfect breakfast and to reinforce our experience."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday morning after dropping my car off at a nearby mechanic and had 45 minutes to blow. Was greeted promptly at the door and seated (pretty empty at this point at 930). Ordered the Monday Classic sandwich and coffee. Sandwich was on point, especially with homemade ketchup and hot sauce. Accompanying salad was also quite good, nicely dressed. Coffee was terribly weak, but was at least hot. Servers were friendly and attentive, quick at coffee refills. Tables were fairly packed by the time I left around 1015. Some of the other reviews mention cash only, but I was able to pay with debit."}
{"text":"I have farm envy. This is the most perfect location I've found to date. Upon driving down the lane you see one quaint restaurant with a bunch of picnic tables, an event and wedding party area and a photography studio. Continuing down the dirt lane there are plots for different fresh produce, cacti, and ultimately two more restaurants. 
     Morning Glory is so cute. Self serve drinks, all outdoor seating and a casual, fresh-aired, relaxing environment. We got seated immediately before the church rush, grabbed hot coffee and soaked up the morning sun. I ordered their farm omelette after battling and eyeing up the brioche French toast. The omelette had broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, spinach and cheese covered with fresh tomato salsa. The salsa had a nice spicy after taste and the omelette was so thick and well made. Their biscuits are flaky, buttery and delicious with a slice of grapefruit to add a little tang. This also
Come with seasoned breakfast potatoes. My brunch date got the \"pork is the new black\" omelette and was on food cloud nine with the sausage gravy over the top. 

Everyone should check this little spot out. Have a picnic. Drink a mimosa. Buy a cacti. Support local!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times for breakfast and always enjoy it!

Food is good.
Menu has nice variety.
Service is always good.
Atmosphere is good.

Seating is all outdoors.  Plenty of heaters if needed."}
{"text":"Service was good, weather was great.. That's cuz it's November! Coffee could be better and the omelette was decent. I was really looking forward to this place being all that it was suppose to be, but it was a little bit of a let down :( ... I'm not one to bash but the food coulda been a little better, omelette didn't have much flavor, potatoes were a little salty, and the French toast was a little rubbery... Over all the place is nice you can't complain when you have Arizona winter weather, while most are in snow jackets and boots I'm wearing t-shirts and shorts ... ;-)

I'll Probably won't be back but it was a nice experience, I'll most likely be at the Waffle House next weekend. Lol... I sure do miss the Grove Cafe - it's closed but they are having a charity event Dec 14 for Salvation Army Christmas Angels - 100% of the proceeds go to the charity! Now that's sweet!!"}
{"text":"My family has been going out to Phoenix for spring training for 30 years now, so we've seen a lot of what the city (and surrounding areas) has to offer, and I don't think I'm alone in saying that it gets a little monotonous. Super chains and greasy mom and pop shops permeate the market, and it gets to feeling like the fresh food revolution hasn't really hit the greater Phoenix area yet. But then you stumble across places like the Farm, and you get a little glimmer of hope that you can get a great meal here that doesn't leave you feeling about 20 pounds heavier-- it's possible people! It really is!

The setting itself is not what I've come to expect from Phoenix-- the Farm is lush with trees, has a bit of a funky Santa Fe vibe, and IT'S NOT ALL BROWN. At the end of the long driveway is Morning Glory Cafe, set amongst flower beds and underneath tall trees. It did seem to be all outdoor seating. 

We were seated immediately and our attentive server took our drink orders (two mimosas, obviously), and we both ordered the eggs benedict on the recommendation of our waiter, who said the hollandaise sauce was particularly good that day. And it was! The dishes had just the right amount of it, and left you feeling full without leaving you ready to burst. Well cooked and well executed. 

I definitely recommend this restaurant for a change of pace, and a breath of fresh air!"}
{"text":"We came here for my friends birthday, it's a great spot for a nice brunch on a spring morning. 

There were 6 of us, I personally ordered the Farm burrito, and added chorizo to it. It was flavorful and huge that I couldn't get a handle on and had to eat with a fork and knife. 

Service was ok, very little interaction with the staff as they take your order and they're gone until food is out. We got our own drinks and coffee which at times we had to wait in line. 

One thing I noticed that there is a discrepancy on their menus between the online menu and their menu offered there as prices for some of the items differ 

 https://www.thefarmatsouthmountain.com/wp-content/uploads/morning-glory-menu.pdf?011107

Also, keep up with the 21st century morning glory folks, the fact that you do not split checks is one reason that I may not come back with a group of friends however I 
Will come back another time if it's family and one check is presented."}
{"text":"Flew into Phoenix at the buttcrack of dawn and needed some breakfast to get  out of a zombie state. The Farm at South Mountain was just the thing. The farm is so quaint and peaceful and wonderful to walk around. Breakfast at the Morning Glory was perfect. I had the breakfast special enchiladas, which where flavorful and filling. My partner had the brioche french toast and was so content (and he considers himself a french toast connoisseur). Sitting outside under the trees was awesome, there was a rooster waling around crowing his little head off, and the service was attentive and friendly. Coffee was good too! Definitely the spot to go for a breakfast or brunch!"}
{"text":"The wait was about an hour, but it's a popular place so that was understood. They hostess didn't say that we could have gotten drinks while we waited. The food was par, nothing really stood out to me. So that is probably 1 star right there taken away. The other two comes from the service. Terrible, I don't care if you hate your job but don't show it or get another job. Our waitress was hardly around, didn't ask us about our food, took forever to get the check and couldn't even force a smile."}
{"text":"Got to say one of the best brunches I've had in AZ in my long search for such a place after moving from cali and being surrounded by gems like this one. 
If you want quality fresh tasting food straight from the ground to the kitchen and then to your mouth this is the place. Brought my out of state mom for her bday she was in love, as a beach person she loves the outdoors and their outdoor dining did the trick for her. She even stated she would have never guessed she was still in Ph Phoenix. Between the 3 of us we ordered the monty crisco (my moms fav and so hard to find these days), the veggie skillet, and an omelette. None of us wanted to share! For the slightly urban hippie I feel I am meant to be I'm in heaven here.
I will be back again and again and promise to try the bloody mary."}
{"text":"What a cute little place to have breakfast! 
I just recently attended a bridal shower brunch here and it was so cute!  
The food was super tasty, I had the creamy corn porridge with maple glazed sausage and cinnamon sugar roasted apples. I took a chance on it, it sounded like it had a 50/50 chance of being either really good or really heinous! And boy was I glad when it came out and was soooo good! 
This place could be 5 stars if the staff wasn't so lax and a little more attentive. This was the whole table (8 ladies) first time coming to this place, we were not instructed that drinks were self serves for the basics (water, coffee, juice) we had to figure that out on our own, and no one at our table was asked if they would like a mimosa or any other drink other then the self serve stuff. 
I do look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast and brunch spots! They have a variety of yummy food selections. I usually have the omelets or fruit crepes. But I've also had the turkey club and build your own burrito, super yummy as well! And I always have their mimosas, love them! The staff are all very nice and knowledgeable as well. Great spot!  P.S. Every Sunday, there's a farmer market in the parking lot next door. Awesome!!"}
{"text":"I love every place on South Mountain. I've been wanting to try a Monte Cristo for awhile now. The wait was well worth it. Massive flavor explosion in the mouth. Finished it off, chased it with fresh lemonade, and seriously wanted to order round two. For sure will be back next week for that second one."}
{"text":"This certainly isn't a spot I'd go every week but for a special occassion (family visiting, etc) it's a great spot to grab breakfast or brunch.  The farm is a lovely setting.  If you haven't been there before there are a few restaurants on the property.  This one is in the far back.  I found the food to be very good (better than the other casual eatery at the front).  The ingredients are super fresh (you can see the veggies being grown next to the restaurant) and the portions were sized appropriately.  

The cost is on the high side for a breakfast but again, you're paying for atmosphere as well.  Give it a go but expect a long wait on weekends."}
{"text":"This place was really nice, the food was good and the portions were big. It is pricey but I think that it includes everything the outside experience the fresh food items and just the real farm feeling"}
{"text":"Showed up here after we couldn't find any seating over @ Gilead cafe, which is right across the street from this place. 

Morning Glory looks like it's been crammed into someone's first floor house, and the kitchen happens to be at the back and it is tiny! This place is pretty cozy, and the service was decent, although we had to flag our waitress down a few times for refills.

The food is great, I got the special which was sausage & waffle with peaches. The sausage patty was the star, kind wish there was more of it, but it packed quite a punch in terms of flavour and it wasn't dry. The waffles felt a bit airy; but it wasn't bad. I was disappointed in the peaches though, because they looked like they were the Del Monte Canned peaches. 

Supposedly this place is the unofficially an extention of College's Aunties & Uncles, without the massive line. (You can see it on the article going downstairs where the washrooms are located) 

It is worth checking out, if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Helen Y. I love the atmosphere at the Farm at South Mountain. However, the Morning Glory Cafe left much to be desired. 

I didn't mind the wait, as that's typical during weekend brunch. I especially loved that we were lucky enough to get a table on the outside of the layout so that I could keep my bike near me while we ate. Unfortunately, there is no good way to lock your bike up while on the property from what I could see. And this isn't just because I'm overprotective about my bike (though we all know I am).

The service was fairly good. Our sever kindly answered all our questions and dealt with our crazy bill splitting. Our meals came out in a reasonable amount of time and all at the same time too :)

On recommendation of the server, my debate between the spinach mushroom omelet and the eggs Benedict ended with the Benedict. I probably would've rather had the omelet or some a la carte items. For some reason the eggs Benedict just seemed overly spiced to me, and I love spice. The home fries didn't look or taste right either, though I've seen pictures of them looking delicious :-/

As far as beverages go, the revolution individual herbal teas are the awesome. I didn't even know revolution made those. LOVE. Also loved the way my friend's mimosa came, with a small carafe of orange juice and a tiny bottle of sparkling wine. Individual sized things are also the awesome.

One other small note... crayons for the tables would be awesome if you always use the white paper as a tablecloth!!

Will I come back again? Probably. There were a lot of items on the menu that looked delicious. I had a piece of the apple-wood bacon and it was heaven."}
{"text":"My wife and had breakfast at the Morning Glory for the first time and we were not impressed. I had the American Breakfast consisting of 2 scrambled eggs, 2 sausage links and country potatoes. The eggs and sausage tasted \"ok\" but the potatoes were very greasy. The charge for this dish was $13, way to expensive for what you get. I also ordered a small hot chocolate for $3. My wife ordered the Chef seasonal special which consisted of a medley of vegetables and 2 eggs over easy. The vegetables were were very soggy and greasy. This dish cost $14. She also had a small cranberry juice which cost $3.50. As much as we paid for breakfast I expected a much better tasting and nutritious meal. Needless to say we were very disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday Brunch in late December.  It was crisp around 9am, but not to cold, the Sun was out, and the outdoor heaters were humming, so it was enjoyable.  

All seating, we could see, was outside, so plan to enjoy the elements.  We were seated quite promptly, and handed two menus by our very attentive waitress Candice.   Coffee, tea, lemonade, and water are self serve, but not complimentary.  The coffee was nice, but found lots of grounds in my cup.  

Selection was quite large, with plenty of options, savory, sweet, hot/mild, etc... We decided to compliment our choices.  I went with the \"Back to your roots\", because of the saut√©ed vegetables with a \"buttermilk biscuit\", and added the gravy on the side.  Sadly, not the Combo I should have gone with.  Mr. Man, due to my savory choice, chose the \"Monte Cristo\" with bacon syrup, a winner on all accounts, savory/sweet, with bacon syrup and powdered sugar.  How can that be wrong?  It wasn't. 

The results: 

BTYR:  I had high hopes for this one, seasonal saut√©ed veggies with eggs, potatoes, and a buttermilk biscuit!  Scrumdealyumptious!  Sadly, expectations were not met.  The veggies and eggs were delightful, light and saut√©ed/roasted veggies, with perfect eggs.  That's where bliss ended.  The potatoes were bland and limited 'breakfast potatoes' you'd find at Denny's or elsewhere, not a knock on Denny's, just expected more from a \"Farm Fresh\" offering.  Freshly shredded hash browns and/or Dutch fries would have been a great touch, not the frozen fried lackluster potato offering presented.  

As a southerner, I'm partial to my \"buttermilk biscuits\", they should be light/fluffy and biscuit sized.  The \"biscuit\", was more sconish than biscuit, and dense, not airy like a \"buttermilk biscuit\", should be.   The biscuit gravy, forget about it, the roux was poor consistency and greasy, with some decent sausage chunks.  Might I suggest some southern cooking websites to work with, on presenting an improved gravy product, less grease more 'roux' for the gravy.  I'll bring in the grandmother, if needed.  

Suggestion:  Cheese drop Biscuit(s) 

2 cups Flour
2 tsps baking powder  
2/3 cup of buttermilk/milk
8 oz cheese
3 oz butter/margarine

Mix, drop, bake 400F - 15 minutes.  Light, airy, delicious!

Monte Cristo:  Awesome!  Can you beat toasted/griddled brioche bread, filled with Ham, eggs (over easy), and cheese, dusted with powdered sugar, surrounded by a pool of syrup, doused with bacon pieces?  No you cannot!  Mr. Man shared this delicacy, but gobbled away.  It was delicious!  Definitely worth a return showing.  

We're giving it 3.4 out of 5, can't go 3.5 due to the rounding up challenge.  Love the atmosphere, it's fun and playful.  Farm fresh is pushing the envelope in our book.  The potential is there!  Will be back to take on the Benedict and Huevos  Rancheros, will pass on anything biscuit and/or gravy related until the beatings continue and morale improves."}
{"text":"it wasn't busy at all when my friend and I got there. we walked straight in. the food was good. My friend got the special which at the time was an omelet with pork ( -1 star because it was they tiniest serving of pork, ridiculously small) and I got the huevos rancheros. friendly service, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cutest place for brunch! Make sure you get there early because this place is popular! I ordered the monte cristo and it was not only delicious, but the ingredients were fresh and the portion was huge! After I stuffed myself, I had to walk it of! Thankfully it's a cute little farm with vendors. Beautiful way to spend a Saturday."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! A must try! I was visiting the area with my mom and we stumbled on it through a different app on my phone. I checked it out on here and saw that it seemed worth a try. Everything we got was so good we came back the next day again! They had some breakfast staples like Your standard bacon, egg, and potatoe breakfast but all the egg meals came with the most amazing biscuits! The potatoes were awesome too very well seasoned! They have some items that were a little out of the box as well such as the porridge we tried which was also delicious. The place was so good we went back again on Saturday. The wait was a little longer this time but again worth it. Both of our servers were very accommodating and the self serve drinks were good too for those of us who drink a lot of coffee or Iced yea. The last reason to try it out is among all the chains this quaint place was in a garden of flowers! Must try!"}
{"text":"They are open now!  Pleasant dining experience (minus the hot weather and flies).  Outdoor seating only and pet friendly.  Seasonal menu is fresh and food I had was really good!  Very fresh eggs.  One of the best breakfast I had in a while...  4 stars for food.  5 stars for being original, eco-friendly and supporting local growers."}
{"text":"My husband and I took his parents here for brunch on a Saturday morning.  All in all, it was a positive experience.  When we arrived we didn't feel like we were in Phoenix!

The pros:
-The staff was really friendly and helpful
-The food was delicious 
-The patio is dog friendly
-We didn't wait long for a table

The cons:
-I am not sure how I feel about the self-serve beverages 
-While most of the staff we met were friendly, our server seemed rushed and frustrated


Overall it was a good experience and I would go again."}
{"text":"The Morning Glory is one of three restauraunts on a desert sanctuary near South Mountain in Phoenix. It is a truly special place, with a massage center, little chalets, an artists' colony, gardens (yes, various plants grow in the beautiful Sonoran desert). I could, but won't, go on and on about the scenery and the vibe of the place. Suffice it to say that the Heard Family, of Heard Museum fame, bought this acreage many years ago, in order to preserve its beauty. Recent owners have only improved on the site.

The restaurant itself appears to have an indoors and an outdoors section; we sat on the beautiful patio with ample shade and hummingbirds. Beverages (water, tea, coffee, and lemonade) are self-served and refills are endless. The menu is seasonal and rotational, varying with the availability of produce on the farms. Breakfast is heavy on eggs, though I had savory crepes with shrimp in a bechamel sauce with fresh garden herbs. And bacon. 

This location reminds me of why I love the desert, though I never forgot."}
{"text":"They had us the moment we drove up the bark chipped driveway, through the arbor, and up to the patio with red checked table cloths.

the day before, we had breakfast at La Grande Orange, and my husband was sure I couldn't top that experience...but Yelp did not disappoint!!

I had the Monte Cristo....slow roasted Black Forest Ham, thinly sliced, and served with an egg-over (had mine over hard...it's a yolk thing) with swiss cheese and sandwiched between brioche french toast....delightful!

Hubs had a sausage omelet with veggies and hash browns....

To speak to the prices...I honestly don't think that paying $10-$11 per breakfast entree is exorbitant. Especially when you realize that they are serving food made from mostly organic, and all premium sources.There is a price involved when a restaurant stays true to a seasonable and sustainable food source, and I'm willing to pay a few bucks extra for \"slow food\" vs. fast.

the $9 Bloodies were a bit steep, but by the time I had mine plus half of my husbands, I was as happy as can be:)

Warning: only visit the Morning Glory Cafe when you have time to relax and enjoy....uptight people need not attend...be prepared to stroll through the Artist's Studio and Maya's Farm....we stayed so long we almost went to lunch at the Farm Kitchen!

We look forward to coming back for dinner at Quinessence next time we visit Phoenix.

Big love to Wayne Smith for creating such a delightful venue!!"}
{"text":"Adorable, laid-back brunch spot. Seating is quite limited (although in the summer there is a small back patio), so you have to time your visit carefully. I have meant to come here a few times but it was full and I ended up at neighbouring Gilead Cafe instead (which is also delicious, with more seating). Came on a Saturday around 12:30 and there were lots of tables. Note that there is no A/C and it's open kitchen so it gets warm... but smells great. 

They have a nice selection of teas, but I was already so hot so I went for a large glass of freshly-squeezed OJ which hit the spot. The specials are on the blackboard and there is a small menu of well-priced sandwiches and egg dishes (most $6.50-8). I had the omelette, which had goat cheese and freshly grown ___ (some green vegetable that I had never heard of before). It was flavourful and light; I think they use 2 eggs, the portion is not huge. It came with some whole grain toast and a small side of rosti where the potato is very finely shredded. Yum! Best part - the homemade ketchup. It's a must-try if you ever come here. My DC had the waffles with sausage and mangoes. Interesting combo. Looked great though. Service was efficient and swift -- we were catching a matinee at Soulpepper Theatre and were in and out in just under 1 hour."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  We were in Phoenix for Spring Training & it was my birthday, so after carefully reviewing yelp, I chose Morning Glory for breakfast. It was perfect!!!  The farm was darling, the cafe couldn't have been cuter, the service was great & the food was delicious.  I had the Farm Omelet, with a side of granola. The granola was so incredible, I had to buy some to go. My kids had the French Toast (yum) and waffles, which they devoured.y husband had bacon & eggs & said it was great.  We ate outdoors, and afterwards we went into the cute gift shop, toured the gardens and visited the farmer's market.  Possibly  the most perfect morning ever.  Thanks, Morning Glory!"}
{"text":"This is a tiny but cozy cafe that I unfortunately had a negative experience with which has made me avoid them ever since. really its all over a  silly BLT I ordered one and when I bit into it I realized it had Apple Butter on the toast and it completely turned my stomach. Ever since I have not gone back which I really only have myself to blame because they must have more then a BLT on their menu!?! 

But regardless I have never really been a fan of cramped spaces when dining, I need sufficient room to eat and relax. I'd also like the luxury of not having that awkward stand off for a table with some elderly european lady. I will say that I smell some of the most delicious and curious smells escaping this small cafe and they do intrigue me some. 
Perhaps I will give them another try and let you know how that goes"}
{"text":"09/30/12

Had brunch here with my aunts and Mom.  While they placed orders for the American Breakfast, which consisted of two Hickman Farm eggs, over medium, home fries, a buttermilk biscuit, and applewood smoked bacon ($8.95) and the Rustic French Toast, whose description read rustic bread, apple butter, candied pecans, and warm syrup ($8.95), an aunt and I walked over to The Farm Kitchen to order a couple of sandwiches.  When we arrived back to MGC, we were surprised to find a bustling cafe, since it was a very warm afternoon.  However, it's always nice to see local restaurants busy any time of the year.  :)

Mom and I always get the Monte Cristo, or the French Toast, and I swear every time we order the toast, it always looks different.  The best version we ever had it here was the first two times we tried it, years ago.  The photographs were already taken down long ago (?), but no matter- we still remember how great they were.  The first time, I asked if we could have bananas added, and so we were presented with a lovely plate of French toast with caramelized bananas, mixed berries, and pecans.  The second time, the kitchen ran out of bananas, so we just had blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries, and chunks of candied pecans.  The last time we visited, we were told absolutely no additions could be made, but Mom wanted to try it, anyway.  Suffice it to say, she wasn't happy with the product.  So, I was surprised when we arrived and was told it was ordered.  It took awhile to arrive, but I must admit that when it did, my aunt and I enjoyed it! I didn't see much of the candied pecans, though... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/morning-glory-cafe-phoenix?select=-wT5mZbSdPEuVjHRrusuRg#-wT5mZbSdPEuVjHRrusuRg

The American Breakfast was a sad sight to see... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/morning-glory-cafe-phoenix?select=ikrbRBUgz1Q-qYiH2ao_QQ#ikrbRBUgz1Q-qYiH2ao_QQ  Two thin strips of bacon, ONE egg, a tiny biscuit, and home fries.  Are you kidding me?  I justified the price of the dish by telling my aunts everything on the plate was organic and/or locally-produced.  I've yet to ask what the verdict was on this dish- stay tuned!

Great atmosphere, not so much the heat.  Will come back once the weather cools!"}
{"text":"This is a small and cozy hipster brunch place that is great to relax and enjoy the day.  Be prepared to wait for both a seat and for your meal to be served.  There are no line-ups out the door for a spot at brunch so it is an acceptable wait.  I like to think that the food takes a long time because they take care in making it.  The service is so friendly and it really feels like a wholesome place.  I really feel the love in this place.

So what makes it hipster?  The fact that you're sitting on a church pew and mismatched chairs, and the fact that the ketchup is homemade and isn't a bright shade of red.  Their sandwiches are delicious, whether it is grilled or on a soft bun.  Their eggs are nice and soft and fluffy too."}
{"text":"I really struggled between 3 and 4 stars for this. The farm is awesome and it was a perfect day. We came here for a baby shower/brunch and were able to sit in the back on the grass. Everyone was excited we got some sun and were able to sit outside in February with such great weather. 

We recognized the restaurant was busy, and no one was in a rush, but it seemed like our waitress couldn't handle the stress of brunch as well as having a larger party. I know I can be pretty harsh when it comes to serving, but when you spend over 10 years doing it yourself, you know how things could and should be done.

We had the menu in front of us for not even a minute and she was asking what we wanted to order. No drink order...no introduction...nothing. I had to prompt her that we were good to order drinks first -it being brunch and all we mostly opted for bloody's and mimosas. The bloody was good and refreshing. Not my favorite that I have had around, but not bad. Mimosas were good sized and had freshly squeezed OJ. 

When we finally did decide to order, we kept it pretty basic. The menu isn't extensive so that's easy. We all had a variety of things including the American breakfast which was nice and simple with a great little biscuit. Someone had the biscuits and gravy as well as the hash and others had the waffles and other stuff. Generally, for taste, everything was good, but it was cold on our half of the table. Having waited a bit, we all just kind of ate and commented that although it was good cold, it would have been awesome hot. The people who had hot plates had nothing to complain about. 

Getting the food was another story though -that took quite a while which made it annoying that some plates were cold and others were hot. If you knew you had to bring it out as it came, then I would rather one person have a hot meal and me have to wait for my hot meal as well. 

Now this is where I am a bit more sympathetic: having to split a bill. Some tables can be really annoying and make it a tedious task. Generally POS systems make it fairly easy to split things off of the main bill (if they did 10 years ago, then there's no reason it shouldn't be even better these days!). We asked to have our bill split because she didn't do it from the start. Someone even asked her to make sure she did it from the beginning so we could avoid this at the end. She went around and wrote down what each person or couple had and it took FOREVER to get the bills back. No worries for the most part as we enjoyed being outside but still. Once we got them, they still weren't split correctly! At this point we each just paid whatever piece of paper we had in our hands. Luckily gratuity was already added-but it was 20% right off the bat (FYI).

The silver lining, I guess, was that our waitress also over ordered for our table so we got a free farm omlet which was yummy and a free mimosa. 

I was SO excited about this place so I know I need to go back and try it again. Plus they offer so much else as far as dinner or snacks. The hype has to be genuine right?"}
{"text":"Tired of our usual Sunday brunch spots (one of which was Le Petite Dejeuner), we browsed Yelp, hopped our bikes and headed farther east than usual. The neighbourhood here was dead quiet during this time of the week and this was the only building on the block that showed any activity at 11 am. 

Most of the reviews you read here are spot-on - Morning Glory is a small, unassuming cafe that has decent service, but good food in small portions at prices that won't leave a hole in your wallet. The fact that the kitchen is itty-bitty and that there is only one cook limits how quickly it takes to get your food. The poor circulation here will also ensure that you smell like grease by the time you leave!

The goat cheese and arugula omelet was delish and the rosti reminded me of Richtree's. I took a chance and ordered the pan bagna - tomato, red onion, olives, cheese, sun-dried tomato and greens on a ciabatta ($6.50) - which turned out to be an amazingly good surprise. I'm not often impressed by bread, but the ciabatta was definitely fresh - light and springy. I savoured just about every bite of it and will definitely be coming back for more ... we just wished that we knew about the quaint little patio in the back earlier!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast this morning with my friends. This joint is typically our go to breakfast place in King East. I do like how cute the place is. It's small, so come early or else you'll be waiting during the peak breakfast/brunch hours. 

Atmosphere: like I said, place is super cute and small. We unfortunately sat near the door and it was freezing for all of us who had to sit closest to the door when it opened and closed. For some reason the door doesn't fully shut so the server was trying to help us out by keeping the door closed with the newspaper stand. Good effort but it wouldn't close!

Service: Service was good. The place is small so you don't need that many people. There is about 3 that work there. One that serves and 2 who are in the kitchen. It's nice that the kitchen is in the back so you can see the chef cooking away but I kind of leave the restaurant smelling like food! The ladies came by a few times to top up my coffee. Coffee is key so I liked that! I know some reviews mentioned the food took long. I felt the same but kept in mind that there is only one cook in a tiny kitchen in the back. 

Food: everyone enjoyed their food. My friend had their omelette of the day: arugula pesto goat cheese and she said it was good. The others had the Jimmy Screech which is a havarti and ham sandwich with a mixed green salad. They all enjoyed the food. I had the typical breakfast. 2 eggs, rosti (which I absolutely love) and toast. I added a side order of bacon and it came with 5 slices! Guess it's a good thing because it is about $3 for a side order of bacon. I think the food is good, cooked perfectly and fairly priced. Also their homemade ketchup is delicious!

I will definitely be back at Morning Glory, just during the early hours so I don't have to wait for a table. Seating is limited here!"}
{"text":"Great food. Kid and dog friendly. Great place for a weekend breakfast. We always bring visitors here. Outdoor casual seating. Favorite was the chicken enchilada breakfast."}
{"text":"They just opened a couple of weeks ago now for their season while relies on good outdoor weather. Although it was very warm by the time my friends and I finished our breakfast, which we began at 9:30am, it was a great eating experience. Granola with fruit, French toast, corn porridge and my omelet were all enjoyed! Looking forward to going back another time when it gets cooler weather there in the Phoenix countryside, or as close to that as we can get and still just be a few short miles from the city.
It is a pet-friendly place. Tables set aside for people wanting to sit with their dog and enjoy their meal. Cool!
We must have it hit lucky as we got the last open table when we arrived at 9:30.
The man who runs the greenhouse is a fountain of knowledge and will explain exactly what to do with the plant you buy so that it lives a long life, so be sure to check that out, along with walking the property. Just enjoy the outdoors and you will swear you are not even in the Phoenix desert.!"}
{"text":"It took a while for the food to come out, but I actually didn't mind because I got to enjoy and take in mother nature and the cute setting of the cafe (and that's a big deal coming from a typical fast paced/no patience for slow movers Jersey girl). Coffe and tea is also a serve yourself station so that kept me occupied while waiting for food and was a smart move on the owners' part (one less thing for the already busy servers). . Great cafe outdoors. Takes a while for the food to come out but it was packed.

The Cowboy Breakfast Chili & Eggs (AZ Power Ranches Beef, Local Tepary Beans, Melting Cheddar Cheese, Two Over Easy Eggs, Sour Cream, Fresh Cilantro, and Griddled Bread) was really good. I really liked my Spinach and shiitake mushroom omelet as well. The prices weren't too bad either with all things considered."}
{"text":"We got there a little after 0800 and had a lovely breakfast. It was not crowded when we got there, or when we left after strolling the grounds around 0930.

I can't imagine what it's like in June, or after the monsoon starts, but I'ld be tempted to find out because our food was *that* good. And everything we saw going to other tables made us want to ask strangers if they would share a bite."}
{"text":"It was quite a glorious morning the day we went to Morning Glory Cafe. The air was crisp and cool, and since we ate here on a weekday there was plenty of seating available. I love the atmosphere of The Farm at South Mountain but had always eaten at The Kitchen so it was on my checklist to try out this breakfast spot.

I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo. It was a huge portion, filled with fluffy eggs, potatoes, chorizo, refried tepary beans, cheese and pico de gallo. All the components worked well together, and while I enjoyed the addition of chorizo, I'd probably skip it for next time since it was an additional $2.50 on top of my already pricey $12.95 burrito. The plate also had sour cream, mild salsa, potatoes, and a slice of grapefruit. 

We brought the pups along since it's a dog friendly venue. They enjoyed hanging out and taking in all the sights at the farm. They have some mega chickens here that are larger than my dogs. Tricki was very intrigued!"}
{"text":"Finally was able to make it here for breakfast. My opinion, I will NOT be back. As we were walking up to the place, I said \"O now this is the kind of place we should be taking our out of town visitors.\". Well, on 2nd thought, NO. We went today, a weds, there was no wait and we were seated promptly. We were informed that the beverages was self serve as far as coffee, water, tea and lemonade goes. We started with tea-dislike, then lemonade-dislike. And did I mention we self served ourselves in a 12 oz cup with a price of $2.75, WOW! If it was to our liking, Id say that is still steep for a self serve drink in a 12oz cup. He had the monte cristo, which he liked but was not blown away for the price. I had the french toast and it was only ok. I also ordered a side of sausage that i DISLIKED and it was $4 for I think 2 links, WOW. And once our food came, the flys were EVERYHWERE. I kid you not when I say I couldnt wait to get outta there. I left very disappointed, and hungry. Will never return or recommend. But hey, try it for yourself, you may like it. I just think it was too high priced for what we got."}
{"text":"I had known about the Farm, but in all my years living in the valley (I'm a Phoenix native, so there's a lot of years there ;), I had yet to go.  We had a \"Mommy Day\" planned (two out of the three are/were pregnant and the day consisted of breakfast, mani/pedis, and finished up with a baby shower.) which started out at MGC.  

The second pregnant pal suggested we go to MGC for breakfast and everyone readily agreed.  When we arrived, our orders were taken swiftly.  I must say that they are very accommodating at MGC.  I had asked if I could order hard boiled eggs instead of scrambled/fried for my breakfast and they were more than happy to oblige my breakfast revision.  

My only quibble is the fact that we were not aware that you had to pay for the self-serve beverages.  After trying/disliking the lemonade, I went back for ice tea.  Thankfully, I was only charged for one.  

Can not wait to go back once MGC opens back up this fall!"}
{"text":"I was on vacation and found this beautiful ranch, I had their delicious soft airy waffle with eggs & bacon and a mimosa. It was all perfect with shops around while you wait and nice people. A fun place to be."}
{"text":"Awesome food cool atmosphere.  Short walk down a path well worth the trip.  Recommend this place it's unique."}
{"text":"What a find! I used Yelp to find the nearby Cam's for my car, then walked here to get a bite.  The eggs, toast, and rosti breakfast ($6?) was quite nice!  The bread was actually _good_ thick, tasty bread.  The rosti (fried mashed potatoes) was nice, and the eggs were perfect.  The atmosphere was a bit loud (small space, traffic, talkers, music), but still enjoyable. The service was friendly and efficient.  I chose not to use the wi-fi, but it was available.  I did not sample the coffee.  No teevee. :)  Casual place, with just a smidge of hipster class.   I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Lovely ambience and delicious food .. Perfect for weekend brunches , lush green grass , trees , chirping birds and great food .."}
{"text":"Eat your eggs prior to visiting the chicken coop - you have been warned!  Our resident avian expert deduced that their red flesh bald patches were due to pecking each other rather than mange or being bird flu hosts, but that would have scared me off the eggs even though they were probably more decoration than layers.  Well, it would have been a shame to miss the terrific eggs benedict (good hollandaise, not too tart) and S. Mtn. omelettes (made with fresh vegetables from the \"Farm\" portion.  The lemonade didn't taste fresh squeezed, but I can't say much about others' food since we fell upon it so ravenously that we didn't offer any tastes.  The waitress apologized for the long wait which I hadn't noticed because of the good company, pleasant surroundings (except for air conditioning unit whine), and self-serve beverages.  Come to think of it, that was an appalling wait for breakfast fare - maybe the sudden intake of food, advancing heat, or charm of the outdoor setting went to Hostage Gastronome's head, and he left a 30% tip!  I didn't mind the extra few dollars, but felt he sent the wrong message that it's okay to capitalize on one's popularity without providing sufficient staffing.  I'm glad they do offer this alternative to the generic and/or commercial - just get more kitchen help!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast omelet I have ever had.  I had the pork is the new black omelet.  The gravy on the omelet really made it fantastic.  The biscuit was lite and fluffy and the potatoes were also so tasty.  My other colleague had the huevos and they also looked great and he said they were fantastic as well.  Third colleague who doesn't eat meat found them to be accommodating and prepared his meal without meat.  He seemed to like it as well.  Coffee was also good.  Keep in mid it is a working farm and there could be some noise and some activity happening."}
{"text":"Not obvious where it's at from the road (it's tucked back deep inside where it says (Farm At South Mountain) on the sign.  Cool atmosphere, birds chirpin, dogs running around.  Get your own coffee or water.  Food is farmed right there so everything is fresh.  Had smoky apple bacon, scrambled eggs, homemade biscuit, and russett potatoes which was mixed with beans or something, but REALLY good flavor.  If your near sky harbor, ya gotta go to this place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Holy cow, we brought some friends (who are visiting from put of town) for break fast on the morning of valentines, so delicious. The outdoor seating is beautiful on the farm with produce gardens visible from the tables. They had brought propane heaters as it was cool and cloudy. A truly unique dining experience with delicious food. We look forward to going back for lunch and dinner for sure! Fyi, many of the drinks are self serve."}
{"text":"This is one of my regular spots for breakfast when entertaining or meeting up with friends.  It's the perfect place to go after a morning hike on South Mountain to fill up on some of the richest (or simple, if you prefer) breakfast/brunch selections you will find.  Seriously, I'm not into it, but the french toast monte christo sandwich is an amazing fix for the heart-attack prone.

The setting is absolutely unassuming and casual, with plastic chairs and self-serve coffee.  And yes, it is on a farm with 100% outdoor seating.  There's even an occasional breeze that may blow mesquite leaves onto your plate.  But if this sort of encounter somehow does not relax you, or even bothers you, then I suggest going next door for a wonderful massage at the spa.

Seriously, this is what you need on a casual weekend morning, before heading back into a stressful work week on Monday.  Go here if you haven't already."}
{"text":"I feel kind of bad giving this place a poor review, but I honestly wasn't super impressed with my meal or experience dining here. And honestly, I have had better experiences both during this trip and in general.

The pros were that it was early Sunday morning (around 9:30 a.m.) and there was no wait or line to get in. It was also relatively close to where we were staying in Regent Park so it was walking distance. The second pro was that we had six people and could be seated right away. The place is very small so we had to push three tables together to make it work. We were given water and our server did take our drink order almost immediately after being seated, so that was good. However, after she delivered our drinks, she disappeared and we had someone else wait on us the remainder of our visit.

The cons were mostly the food and price. While the food was OK, it wasn't anything amazing and was also pretty expensive for what you got. Someone in our party ordered the breakfast burrito which sounded heart and big, but was actually quite small, didn't come with a side and was almost $8. I ordered the granola and yogurt bowl which was around $8-9, didn't come with the maple syrup it said it would come with, and I couldn't tell our server because she disappeared. The fruit was simply apples and blueberries, so nothing super delicious or revolutionary or even seasonal. Also, I ordered a side of scrambled eggs and it was $3! FOR EGGS. 

Our final bill, with six of us was $91. That is almost outrageous for a mom'n'pop diner-type restaurant for breakfast if you ask me. Nono of us left very full or happy and I can guarantee we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and the natural surroundings love the laidback attractions and good food."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM and $$$ i don't feel that i need to say much else.

except get the monte cristo, the bacon and french toast and more bacon is amazing."}
{"text":"The food and ambiance was nice especially on a perfect day in Phoenix. The Man and I waited 30 minutes for our table while drinking the self-serve lemonade which was more on the tart side. I ordered the waffle with a side of bacon and the man ordered the Monte Cristo. He slightly enjoyed his but should have subbed the ham for bacon. My waffle was nice but not as fulfilling as I'd like but I really enjoyed the fresh blueberries and strawberries atop. 

This place really lost a star because there were soooo many flies!! They should think about putting in a fan or something because it was very annoying swatting away flies every 7 seconds. Would like to try the Farm for lunch one day though..."}
{"text":"I love this place. If it was closer to where I live I'd eat here everyday. It is oh so amazing. Let me lay it all out for you...

a) It's cheap. As a broke student, I love places that I can eat the tastiest of brunch foods and afford it. 

b) It's kitschy cute. And that's my kinda jam. When I took my Mom here she liked everything but the decor cus it reminded her of the 70s. Whatever Mom. I personally found the mugs to be adorable. 

c) It's not busy. Wait. Let me clarify. It's not busy on weekdays. Never have I ever come on weekends cus word on the street is that it's crazy busy. But come weekday? No wait!

d) I love a good sandwich. Order a sandwich here if you like sandwiches.

e) Good tea. Good juice. Enough said.

So yeah! Yum! Go! Oh but don't go if you're in a rush. Just cus sometimes it takes a while. A small price to pay. Worth it? Absolutely."}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  I'm a breakfast guy so I should know.  I think I've had breakfast just about everywhere but I never thought about having it outside on an Arizona farm.  Nice time for the family, great atmosphere, very kind wait staff.  You're on my shortlist Morning Glory Cafe.  Can't give it 5 Stars.  It took a little too long for the food and it wasn't quite as hot as it should have been.  Still, a total win."}
{"text":"This was our first time here even though Ive lived nearby for almost 3 years now. The atmosphere is great. We went kind of early, around 9am on a Saturday and it wasnt very crowded. No wait at all for a table. Love the free serve yourself beverage bar. We started with a lemon poppyseed muffin, which was probably the highlight of the meal. The muffin top was sugar-coated and delicious. My fianc√© ordered the monte cristo, which we had high hopes for. While the french toast bread was great, there wasnt much cheese or meat on the sandwich to properly proportion it to the 2 thick slices of toast. I had the omelette with the gravy sauce which was very good. Only wish it had more delicious gravy for the roasted potatoes it came with! There were plenty of other menu items i would like to try and seeing how this place is nearby and not too expensive i definitely think we will be back!"}
{"text":"I come here quite often because the location is amazing. The Farm is so beautiful! The food is okay. The servers are a bit rude though. Well the ones I've had so far. It's a bit weird to also do the self serving drinks. Am I really just tipping you to deliver my food?"}
{"text":"As I walked in I was greeted by the waitstaff right away with a big smile! I ordered freshly squeezed grapefruit juice and their eggs with hash and multigrain toast at the reasonable price with tax of $10.78. 

Food:
Hash brown was nice and crispy, multigrain toasts were out of this world, with pumpkin seeds, and eggs were cook to perfection!
I was advised to try their \"secret family\" ketchup and it was so addicted and delicious!!

Great ambiance, great place, will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"We were 6th in line when the restaurant opened this morning.  Everyone was seated. After waiting 20 minutes no server had shown up yet. Everyone else had been taken care of. Another couple came in and they were greeted by the server brought flatware. Twenty five minutes and 4 more people. After 30 minutes we left. Servers were standing behind counter and talking. No one ever came to the table. The other reviewers were correct. Not worth it. We went to Cracker and Co. instead. Will not go again."}
{"text":"Great experience! Loved the ambience (outside with nearby heater), the food (delicious breakfast!), and the whole unique experience of being on a farm and walking around afterwards. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I was shocked by the quality of this place.  I went in early May and found that they only had outdoor seating with no misters/fans which made having brunch in 90' heat unpleasant. 
The trees were shedding into the food (there are things known as umbrellas).  The bucolic country ambiance I found nice (though not for everyone).

The food was totally pedestrian. I could cook everything myself and do a better job.  The one of the poached eggs was cooked all the way through.   The cowboy chili and eggs weren't great (the meat in the chili was really grainy and tough).    I had the breakfast tacos, and it was fine -- the chorizo wasn't as good as you can get in the valley.  The self-serve coffee and lemonade was nice.   But there wasn't anything write home about.

In summary this is a low 2* review (I reserve 1* for places that can make you sick)."}
{"text":"In the tradition of this weekend, I liked the food here and pretty much have a lot of negative things to say about the service.

The good:
- it's not that busy but it's still busy enough
- the food is good; Laura LOVED her special omelette with sweet potatoes and goat cheese. I liked the hashbrowns and the meats are from Rowe farms.
- the homemade ketchup is GREAT. It's spicy and sweet.
- the coffee is fine.
- it's cheap. Two breakfasts for 22$.

The bad:
- there is only one cook and the food takes forever.  This in turn leads to long ass wait times for table turnover.
- they don't have a system for having people wait. We waited outside for forever for a table and they finally sat us in the worst seat in the place next to the kitchen and the cash register. There were two free tables when we sat down and people who arrived after us were seated at a much better table. This was the epitome of annoying to me and the staff seems like they don't know that this was wrong.
- I generally thought the staff was pretty terrible.

Funny story:
There was a woman who accosted Laura M at the parking meter and shouted a crazy rant at her.  It was pretty offensive so I'll leave it out of the review but pm me for details :) it was kinda hilarious and I am not sure if she was a real nutter or if this was performance art.  It involved a lot of fist pumping and a (possibly) fake English accent.

Would I go here again?
I wouldn't make a habit out of it but I really liked their ketchup. I might try to make that ketchup at home and if I succeed then I would have no reason to ever come here again."}
{"text":"Yes!!! 

This is the place where you want to have your brunch on a Sunday morning after a heavy drinking night or even just to get off the centre-core a bit.

If you are NOT the type of person who spends his paycheck on over priced restaurants to feel happy about his/her miserable life (we all know who those people are - right Mr. Ford?) than this is really the place for you.

I have been here multiple times and compared to other \"hype\" brunch places in T.O. this is my favourite: tasty and cheap (not going to get into specific details of what type of salt they use for their food and if their eggs are coming from friendly-happy chickens or not - I leave it to those other peps I have mentioned above. What you get is good food, friendly ambiance, and a low price tag. 

Now get yourself out of \"this is the cool place we all go\" kinda mentality and try this one!

Morning Glory - I swear by it! (not the movie though)"}
{"text":"Rude guests.  Old man his wife and grandkids passed us to get to the front of the line. He said we were walking to slow. What an example for those kids. ."}
{"text":"It's kitchy overpriced breakfast spot.  Limited menu, bad service and small portions.  Mom wanted to take us there as something special for Sunday morning. 

We ate and thankfully weren't riding together, so we stopped about 3 miles down the road to get something else to eat as we were still hungry.  

Staff couldn't keep the coffee carafes full.  Patrons brought their dogs, who didn't like the other dogs so our breakfast time was spent with a ton of barking back and forth. 

Self serve beverage is great, if it's free - which it is not and for the prices, should be. 

The facilities were upgraded port-o-potties.  At least there was running water and electricity, right.

This place could be so much better. 

Oh and PS - staff needs to make a sweep of the grounds/dining area. Huge dead and squashed bugs (yes plural) on the patio blocks in not appetizing and probably bad for all the dogs that visit too."}
{"text":"What a gem!!! So beautiful!!! Ignore the neighborhood this place was so worth the trip. They have done a fabulous job with the property and the staff. Our food was . Definitely kid friendly also."}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant, very relaxed. I had the breakfast burrito, which was delicious. The bloody mary was also extremely good. I really enjoyed the atmosphere - the area was beautiful and it was extremely relaxing.

The coffee was good and it was nice to be able to just head over and fill up whenever you needed it."}
{"text":"Mmm! I had such a delicious lunch here yesterday - Turkey and guac sandwich (without the turkey) (also has cheese, lettuce, tomato and their homemade garlic aioli) which came with a great side salad! Their guac is INCREDIBLE :D Everything here tasted so fresh at a very reasonable price :) I'll be back to try some other brunch/lunch options!"}
{"text":"The reviews are pretty much right on. The parking across the street (don't drive in the ditch thinking it is the driveway), the long walk down the gravel road (something my Father would not be into), to the bark path and hard to read signage. 
We went on a Thursday around 9am and shared the place with one other couple. I had the Monte Cristo Breakfast and it was awesome. My wife had the South Mountain Omelet and it was fresh and tasty. The goat cheese along with the salsa verde made the omelet.
The coffee was luke warm at best. I asked our server if he could freshen it up a bit, he took it and threw it in the bushes. He said that is what they do on the farm. He returned with a fresh cup. The coffee is not spectacular at all, marginal at best. He was a good server with about 5 tables by the end of our meal.
I am not a fan of the limited beverage selection there. I understand if they don't want fountain drinks there, but they should have an old time Coke machine for those that like soda. Either that or a self serve beverage tub with ice.
All and all it was a good $32 breakfast. But not something that would draw me back again."}
{"text":"The food is great but the price is high. I absolutely LOVED the Eggs Benedict. The Monte Cristo was delicious; would have been better with potatoes. Nice ambience. It was cool and the birds were chirping. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Morning Glory (along with the Farm Kitchen, the other more casual dining spot at the Farm at South Mountain) re-opened on September 9th after being closed for the summer. We missed being able to go there for breakfast, but on the other hand, would not have been happy or comfortable sitting outside with a hot breakfast in the broiling Phoenix sun and my thighs sticking to the plastic chair. Right. So, it's a good idea that they close for the summer. But I digress. 

I have three reasons for my update: 

1. The Monte Cristo sandwich was still delicious (those farm-fresh eggs and cheese are so good!), but the bread that was so crispy and artisan last time was soggy and too syrupy this time. Note to chefs: the bread is what makes the sandwich complete, so get it right. 
2. The chicken fried steak (served with creamy gravy and rosemary potatoes and topped with one of their delicious, farm-raised eggs) was ridiculously good. The batter was light and crispy and the gravy was the perfect creamy and pepper complement. Try it. You won't regret it. 
3. When the server offers you a muffin or pastry after taking your order, don't accept unless you want to pay $2.50 for it. We fell for that trick and ended up paying for an orange muffin that was ok but kind of filled us up before we got to the good stuff. 

Definitely still amazing, and definitely still worth checking out. I don't think the lunch spot (Farm Kitchen) is as delicious, so if you're only going to pick one of the two, definitely try Morning Glory. Of course, you could also opt for Quiessence, the formal restaurant at the Farm, which I still haven't tried but hear is awesome. A sign at the Farm said they are now open for lunch and afternoon snacks. But, again, I digress."}
{"text":"Beautiful place but I guess they forgot they advertise themselves as a restaurant. We have gone many times before and always get the pork omelette. For around $14 it was of decent size and very tasty. Today that we visited, we waited for around 30 minutes for a table which was fine because of the scenery. When we ordered our usual we received a plate full of potAtoes and the omelette was nowhere in sight, I thought they had brought the wrong order. Then when it was put down I saw this tiny omelette that looked like they only used one egg. The biscuit was bigger that the actual omelette. In that case, just name it home fries with a side of omelette. We were so disappointed that we had to fill up with coffee. Im sorry but the place cannot forget that people go there to actually eat. I regret not taking a pic to prove why we were so insulted. The worst part is that I looked around and everyones plate looked somewhat decent. While the little bite i got was delicious, we wont be going back. I recommend looking up other places if you are planning to actually eat. The star is for the nice farm and the rooster that was walking around."}
{"text":"Love it love it! Perfect place to take the family or a nice date for a morning breakfast/brunch.  The property is massive and the restaurant stands in the back of the property.  On the south end adjacent to Morning Glory, resides a quaint gift shop that sells little trinkets and sauces.  Usually the wait isn't too long, but just being able to sit and view the beautiful property will make time pass and you'll be seated before you know it!  

I love the juevos rancheros here (eggs prepared over easy) the mimosas are delicious and if you get the Bloody Mary make sure to order it spicy! I used to love Bloody Mary's but for some reason they've all been made very thick and I didn't like that.  After the BM I had here, it made me like them again but I will probably only order them here from now on.

The Farm as a whole is a wonderful place.  You can visit here if you just want to have a picnic.  It is simply a peaceful place where you feel time freezes for a moment and you actually forget that you're in Arizona for a bit.  Keep up the amazing work!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this restaurant is the setting/environment. It's all outdoors and since the weather is perfect it's an amazing patio. They are dog friendly too so a plus if you like pets as there were many many dogs there. Got the veggie omelet and the berry waffle. Both were just ok. The portions were on the small side for the price but I did enjoy how fresh the food tasted. I was sooo excited for the biscuit but that too was very small. Like half the size of a normal biscuit. I'm a germ freak so I did not appreciate the serve yourself drink as I saw many people dipping their cup into the ice instead of using the scooper that was there. Our server was attentive and helpful since I had never been there before. Will be back again since the ambience was perfect. They also have live music on the weekends!"}
{"text":"our group always stays @ the legacy golf course, so this gem is by far a spot we will hit time and time again!  i had the monte cristo, and i will always have the monte cristo...for some reason the farm reminds me of sonoma county, specifically my aunt letizia's house in sonoma.  the coffee, the mimosas, the biscuits, and ambience are quality!  can't wait to be back to the farm & morning glory!  we'll have to try one of the other restaurants there next time too!"}
{"text":"Best breakie/brunch food EVER! The food is great and the organic coffee is yummy. My Fiance and I are having our wedding at the Farm and specifically wanted a brunch wedding so that we could eat the yummy breakfast food."}
{"text":"We arrived at about 9:45am on a Saturday. Just in time! Our wait was about 20 minutes to be seated but the wait time was much longer just after we got a table. Next time we'll try on a weekday or early morning.

Self service beverages were nice before we got a table. My first coffee was tasty but the refill looked like an oreo blend, guess I got the bottom of the pot.

Our food was tasty. Priced accordingly seeing as produce and proteins are sourced locally. A great majority of the dishes are served vegetarian with the option to add Shreiners meats for a $3 or  $4 upgrade.

Our food took 40 minutes to arrive after we ordered. We then waited another 15 or so for the check. The view was great though and temperatures were perfect for late summer. I just felt bad holding a table for a while when we had been ready to leave.

I almost feel like counter service would be faster and more efficient for the space. Seeing as beverages are already self serve and a food runner brought my meal, I have a hard time supporting a great tip for my server when they are only responsible for taking my order and bringing the check :/

Overall I'll certainly be returning to Morning Glory, but I'll need a snack before breakfast."}
{"text":"We had an excellent breakfast here in mid February. The weather was sunny with a slight breeze- perfect for enjoying the outdoor seating area (no indoor seating). We got the root vegetable and eggs dish, the breakfast burrito, and the challah french toast, all were delicious. Would have been nice if they put the syrup on the side instead of pouring it on the toast, so if you don't like the french toast to be really sweet ask for the syrup on the side. The farm itself is really beautiful!"}
{"text":"Most deserved of the calories I consumed at Morning Glory Cafe after hiking the entire Mormon Trail. My group of 10 lucked out with not having to wait since we arrived after 12 and they close at 1. Plenty of seating was available with space for us to be comfy. The outdoor setting added to our fun, long-awaited breakfast. The entire place is a beauty!

At first we were told that the self-serve drinks were free.... but not so much after all of us had gotten up and picked a drink and our waitress told us wrong. $3.50 seems a little outrageous for lemonade/tea/coffee. Besides that issue, we loved the meal. All of us got something different off the menu. My \"Port is the New Black\" breakfast was absolutely fabulous. I'm not a fan of ham for breakfast so it was no problem to sub for extra sausage. 

Since we were a group of 10 we were unable to split the check. That signage is quite clear on the menus. It's understandable that a small place doesn't want to split for more than 6"}
{"text":"...recently my interview travels would take me to Phoenix/Scottsdale, a place I'd never really considered before, but a place with a job that just seemed \"right\" and a number of fellow gourmands, foodies, and chow-hounds who really reached out with their recommendations and offers to meet up for meals - a great group, each and every one.  With days jammed packed this short trip would actually prove to be a little tricky in planning but after getting a general feel for the local logistics the restaurants fell into place nicely with breakfast, lunch, and dinner planned strategically each day along with a few snacks.  Beginning first with breakfast, just as my trip did, there were three proper sit down breakfasts in The Valley and the first took place less than an hour after I hopped of the plane at The Farm at South Mountain.

With bags packed light and my car easily obtained the drive to Morning Glory Caf√© would be a straight forward 15 minutes from Sky Harbor Airport and arriving at the large farm I proceeded down the gravel path through gardens of streaming sunlight that I quite simply did not expect to see in the \"desert.\"  With signs delineating the location of the caf√© (and the oft raved Quiescence next door) parking was found under a shady tree and checking the thermostat, 87 degrees Fahrenheit at 8:45am) I hopped out of the car and walked down the path to the restaurant only to find the patio approximately 1/3 full.  Greeted promptly by a thin young woman and subsequently by the elderly gentleman who would be my server I was told to \"sit anywhere you like.\"

Selecting a seat in the shade as my pale Midwestern complexion certainly was not ready for an hour in the Arizona sun it would be mere moments before Cliff would stop by with the menu and a bucket of condiments to inform me of the daily pastry special and to ask if I had any questions.  Requesting a coffee I was informed that the coffee, water, and tea are all \"help yourself\" and suggesting I'd need a minute to browse the menu I was told to take my time.  

With the menu concise but full of excellent choices largely consisting of locally sourced meats and organic produce I spent a few moments weighing my decision and with my choices made I motioned to Cliff who stopped by to take my order and warn me \"you'd better be hungry\" before departing for the kitchen.  Undeterred by his warning I next proceeded to the coffee stand where biodegradable cups and lids were provided for both water and coffee and after getting a cup of each I returned to my seat where I sipped the thin and mildly acidic locally roasted Caf√© Cortez coffee while awaiting my appetizer.

Prebaked but still warm, the first item to arrive at my table would be the pastry of the day - a Blueberry Muffin nearly the size of my fist and bespeckled with crystals of cane sugar.  First tasting the muffin as it was and then gilding the proverbial lily with salted California Dairies butter the muffin would prove to be quite impressive in its density but also in its fluffiness as the medium-size blueberries burst with flavor within the buttermilk batter with tinges of cinnamon tickling the palate.

With coffee refilled and a short wait as the patio filled another pair of tables with locals (and regulars judging by the greeting) Cliff would arrive perhaps twenty minutes after I was seated with the main course - the \"Farm Monte Cristo\" consisting of two thick slices of fluffy rustic French Toast sandwiched around slow baked local ham, two over easy eggs, and melting cheddar cheese.  Apparently expecting me to be overwhelmed by the size Cliff offered me a \"good luck and bon appetite\" before stepping away and with that I set out to douse the amalgam with warm organic maple syrup and take a bite; a bite that more or less redefined the Monte Cristo for all time as the bread was not the least bit oily but rather light and fluffy with a nearly croissant textured interior and slight yeasty notes mellowed by the syrup and the powdered sugar. Moving next to the ham-young, fresh, lean, and salty - and then the sharp cheddar and creamy eggs the flavor was in a word \"perfect;\" salty, sweet, creamy, crunchy, and at the same time surprisingly light.  It was not only the best breakfast item I had in Phoenix, but the best sandwich I've had in a very long time.

With Cliff returning surprised that I'd finished the meal and offering me a \"good job\" I joked (well, not really joked as I really did go for pastry and pizza afterward) that the sandwich \"wasn't that big, but it was THAT good\" and thanking him for the service I requested the tab while getting yet another coffee to enjoy while I checked my mail and another cup to go.  Noting now that the experience of such a great sandwich, setting, and service is not \"cheap\" ($23 with tax and tip) I can say without a doubt that if I do end up in Phoenix long term Cliff will not make the mistake of underestimating my capacity again because without a doubt I'll be a regular."}
{"text":"Wonderful little out of the way place. Easy to miss from the main road, but a treasure to find! The food was awesome! Fresh ingredients that taste so REAL (for lack of a better word). I would've given this place 5 stars IF they had inside seating, but they don't. Eating outside on a farm is nice, but the Arizona heat and farm flies, made me take away a star! Yes, there's plenty of shade, and they do their best to bust the tables quickly to keep away the bugs and pests.

The food tastes just like everything was grown right on site, as it should, because it is! The fruit was beautiful and juicy and sweet. The eggs were fluffy and delicious. The best was the waffle! OMG crispy but fluffy with the right flavor! 

This place is a must if you're in the Phoenix area. Great service, beautiful scenery, and delicious food at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place food was excellent and the restaurant sits on the back of this beautiful farm.  Our family had a really good time and we will be going back soon."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, my partner and I trekked a bit of a distance to go to this place. It looks a bit shabby, but we thought what the hell - with the good reviews the food must be good. It really wasn't and we were SO disappointed.

First: They forgot our order and came after a while to ask what it was. Really??

Second: They brought juice in a glass that had such a big chip on the top, that we had to be careful to avoid putting that aide in our mouth - sharp glass edges and all.

Third: My partner ordered his eggs scrambled, but they came whole and well cooked. We didn't complain, because anyway they were taking ages to notice us or for anyone or come by.

Fourth: I ordered their special omlette of the day (mediterranean) and it had such a strong after taste of some cajun-like spices that I couldn't eat it. Pity because I usually relish my eggs, and have never had them so funnily flavoured.

Fifth: We kept signalling for ages for the bill, but the servers were busy chatting behind the counter and didn't notice. Two servers in a small place like this shouldn't be so slow.

So all in all - terrible experience. Bad food, bad service and bad cutlery. SIGH. Waste of a good weekend morning. AND it's cash only!"}
{"text":"Awesome fresh ingredients, great fresh-baked scones, and an awesome location at the back of the Farm at South Mountain. 

Morning Glory cafe has amazing omelettes--the Greek and Farm are my favorites. They also have delicious french toast.

If you have friends come in from out of town this is the ideal place to take them for a Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Not from Arizona, came from California. We found this place on Yelp, decided to try it out ! Their food, service, and environment was phenomenal! For a busy Saturday morning we were seated immediately. If you're going to splurge on food, this is the place! As a group of four we each ordered something different. None of us were disappointed. The special of the day was a smoked pork omelette with jack cheese and you could taste the smokiness flavor !! I had the farm burrito, added chorizo for a few more bucks, it was super tasty!! Definitely going back before leaving Arizona!!"}
{"text":"I've brunched here a few times, several years apart. each time i receive exceptional service and amazing food as well as great scenery! 

i recommend the eggs benedict and the farm-stand omelet.  and why not order a mimosa while you're at it!  most dishes are around $10/$12 and the mimosa was $9. they have self serve containers of  fresh squeezed orange juice, water and coffee. 

you can park across the street and walk through the pecan grove or go totally rogue and drive right up to the cafe. i recommend walking, better experience. you can also visit the cafe store and purchase queen creek olive oil (awesome) and my personal favorite, chocolate chip coconut macaroons. 

this place is great, especially if you find yourself sick of the endless subdivisions and pavement that is phoenix."}
{"text":"While searching for a breakfast spot, that was not to full and near the airport we came across this little gem.

The food is simple and good. I got eggs with cheese and I was happy that my food wasn't soggy with oil or over done. The buttermilk biscut was a treat! 

The mimosa was a surprise and a bit overpriced. They give you OJ in a glass and a small glass bottle of champ to mix your own. The upside is that one my second one (yeah I roll like that) I just added the extra bottle of champ to my leftover mimosa and the OJ was a little treat for BCBP. 

The service is laid back. You get your own coffee and the server will do most of the rest. The guy waiting on us was cool and overall I was happy.

The location is fun. There are chicken you can go and see and it feels like you are tucked away in another place. It doesn't feel like AZ because of all the green.

Just an FYI if you suffer from allergies, when I was there the pollen was raining down. Take your allergy pill beforehand!"}
{"text":"Great patio and it doesn't feel like you are in AZ. The self serve drinks and coffee was a little annoying but the food was very tasty. We shared the apricot scone and I had the special, chilaquiles with chorizo, beans, guac and sour cream. My guy had the trout omelette that was served with home fries and a biscuit. They first didn't offer jam so he  had to ask for it, doesn't seem like they are well staffed on a Sunday morning. This was my 1st time here and we went early ~9AM and I suggest you do the same as there was a wait as we left the restaurant. It's a   short walk as there is not right in front but it's cute to see the farm/greenhouse and little open businesses. Will go again as it is cooling down in AZ but I don't really see us coming in the summer, maybe for brunch after a hike at South Mountain."}
{"text":"Amazing place to go for breakfast!!! I've been here several times and the food is always amazing. The service is very quick and friendly. I highly recommend the Monte Cristo, it is definitely the best item on the menu. Just a heads up, there is parking right in front of the restaurant. It seems confusing because there are signs by the street directing you to a dirt lot across from the property."}
{"text":"This was hands down the best breakfast I have ever had.. the food was outstanding, it tasted so fresh and everything was cooked to perfection. I had a breakfast sandwich special which was absolutely incredible. My parents had the chilaquiles and the huevos rancheros which they devoured. The service was great I will be back here many many times."}
{"text":"The Morning Glory Caf√© is located at the far end of a very long drive through some really nice land at The Farm at South Mountain.  The area really takes you out of the city and makes you think there might not be civilization beyond the tall trees surrounding it.  It is a peaceful oasis in the midst of a bustling metropolis.

One note to save you some walking - as we approached the are on 32nd Street, there was a sign pointing right that said \"Morning Glory Caf√©\" and a sign pointing left that said \"Parking.\"  We turned left, parked, and walked down the long drive to the restaurant...where we found parking available for the restaurant.  Don't get tricked by the parking sign and park in the little lot across the street.  You can go down the drive and park closer to the restaurant itself.

The restaurant was fine overall; nothing terrible to talk about, but nothing amazing to talk about either.   The restaurant is outdoor seating only; there is no interior dining room so if you don't like to sit outside this probably isn't the best place for you.   One issue I encountered while we were there was that the trees (which there are a lot of all over) were dropping little leaves on us whenever the wind blew and they would land on our food.

The food itself was just okay.  It came out REALLY fast (and the restaurant was not slow that morning) which means that most of the food is prepped and ready to be nuked and served.  I had the \"Cowboy Breakfast - Chili and Eggs\" and it was a bowl of chili with two over-easy eggs on top.  Nothing fancy, just that.  Definitely not a lot of thought toward presentation or elegance - and, I get it, I ordered the Cowboy breakfast on a farm I shouldn't expect French Laundry... but, based on that dish and my overall experience, I don't think I'll be going back and if I did I wouldn't order the Cowboy Breakfast again.  There just wasn't anything interesting or special about it.  It really struck me as a turn-and-burn dish.

The beverage setup was a little strange, but I actually didn't totally mind it.  Coffee, tea, water, and lemonade are self serve up at the counter and the server just counts your cups at the end of the meal.  One positive to being able to fill my own drink was that it was never empty because I didn't need to wait for our server to stop by the table for refills.

Speaking of servers, we didn't end up leaving that much of a tip because when you arrive, you find your own table and you get your own drinks.  The server stopped by the take our order and dropped off our food.  Other than that, we didn't see her until she brought the check over.  Honestly, I did half of the work myself by getting my drinks so we didn't feel like a large (or even normal) tip was necessary.

Overall, Morning Glory Caf√© was alright, but I have better restaurants to spend my time in."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and excellent customer service but my meal was completely underwhelming. I ordered \"the American breakfast\" eggs, biscuit, sausage and home style potatoes. Scrambled eggs are what they are hard to make them bad so that was fine but my biscuit didn't taste as fresh as expected, the sausage was dry and over cooked and the potatoes had no flavor at all. Cute place but at $12 a plate I had higher expectations of the food."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast!  Love the monte cristo, the breakfast enchiladas and the eggs benedict."}
{"text":"This restaurant allows dogs, but is not \"dog-friendly\". I went with 3 other adults after a hike on South Mountain trails. We had our 2 dogs with us and when we put our name on the list, were told it would be ~1.5 hr wait. As the crowd dwindled, and about 1.75 hr had gone by, we realized we had been selectively skipped on the guest list. We learned that there was limited seating (3 tables) that were \"for parties with dogs\". We eventually spoke with a manager as the restaurant has ample outdoor seating (with numerous other open tables at that time) and we were seated fairly quickly. She did provide service recovery, but it was really hard to get past the initial disrespect we experienced. I don't intend to return to this establishment and won't be recommending it to my friends. My expectations would have been better aligned with the experience if I had not been expecting a \"dog-friendly\" brunch. The Farm itself is a neat recreational area with open markets."}
{"text":"We met friends there for a breakfast al fresco. I've been to the Farm in South Mountain several times. Over the years, I've attended a wedding, shopped their produce stands, visited their art studio, breathed some fresh air and picked up organic greens and chicken eggs. Back to my Morning Glory impressions! Located in back, we drove to its parking lot. We sat outside and ordered juices, coffee and hot cocoa.  My 8oz cranberry juice at $3.50 , l thought was a bit pricey especially when it is served in a disposable plastic cup. I expected a \"greener approach\".  
I chose their breakfast special, a meddley of sauteed veggies (bell peppers, squash, potatoes, onions...) topped with over easy eggs.  My friends chose the Montecristo brioche sandwich and my hubby chose the All American breakfast.  Montecristo was a two thick slices of brioche, folded eggs and ham bathed in syrup. All American was eggs any style, sausage, biscuit, cubed potatoes. My \"special\" was not special. Veggies were overcooked and oily, soggy.  I was looking forward to eating locally grown produce but their kitchen killed it.
Four very average breakfasts, 1 coffee, 1 cranberry juice, 1 hot cocoa later, (all served in non recyclable cups), including tips totalled $86. Morning Glory is out of line."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: cute.
Walking around was just great and made the wait go by so fast. The little farm area next to it and picnic area is so adorable! The food was also great. Just what you expect and more! Coffee was alright and its self-serve. A little pricey for self-serve coffee. The monte cristo was yummy! I would definitely go back. :)"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday morning for brunch with my dad on my birthday and I thought it was really special. The farm is pretty, it feels like you are out of Phoenix for a minute. The food was excellent! We shared the cowboy eggs (or something like that) and the french toast. The cowboy dish was amazing, it is a big bowl of delicious, well seasoned, slightly spicy chili with two over easy eggs on top and two pieces of toasted and buttery bread. I thought it was a real gem. The french toast was also very very good. I am not super into sweet breakfast, but I might make an exception for this. The toast had a crispy outside and a soft inside, was covered in syrup and some kind of flavored butter, and topped with nuts...it was crazy good....I only deducted a star because it was my first time coming there and the place is a bit expensive, but there is no question I would come back here again. In fact....I want to go back right now!


Oh, Tip: I saw the parking lot across the street from the farm and parked there BUT it is a long walk from there to the restaurant and there is closer parking...just not a ton of it."}
{"text":"We ate here for brunch on Sunday.  My brioche french toast was the best french toast I ate ever had.  It wasn't to sweet or too dessert-y like some can be.  What makes this place so great is the environment.  It really feels worlds away from Phoenix.  Its transitioning into the cooler weather now so i like how they had the heaters on.  The only reason why I knocked off a star is that the prices are a little high and you have to get your own coffee and water.  I ordered hot cocoa just so I wouldnt have to serve myself."}
{"text":"You can't beat the ambiance. Nice patio views of the Farm. The food was great, even my husband couldn't find fault. I will be adding the Morning Glory Cafe to my list of favorite brunch places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"If you want a picnic feeling it would definitely satisfy your interest, but like any picnic.... bugs, foliage, smells, dust and that's just what your food will be topped with once they bring it to your table. The food is average, nothing you can't order at your local chain dinner. It's something you might want to experience and try once but I'm not falling for the hype!  If you decide to go, dress comfortably, you're outdoors and it's Arizona."}
{"text":"Let's establish something before you read my review; I'm a tough critic on breakfast joints since my husband cooks the best breakfasts around! 

You're paying for ambiance and serenity when you eat at Morning Glory Cafe, which is sometimes worth it. Today was a beautiful day to eat on the patio with friends, however, I found the food overpriced for what it was...and not just because I'm a cheap-ass, even my DINK friends thought it was pricey.  The unlimited coffee was pretty nice, though I heard average reviews from the other 8 people in my group on their food. My taco shells with eggs were good, but I could make something just as good at home for half the price. 

The grounds are simply beautiful though (5 Stars for them), so you're paying for the luxury of enjoying their beautiful farm and fresh produce. We walked around and looked at the chickens, strolled the vast lawns, and perused the gift shop. Overall a nice way to spend a Saturday morning in the beautiful weather."}
{"text":"This is the way food is suppose to be.  Fresh from the farm.  Eggs taste like eggs and not bland, OJ is fresh squeezed, all their food is out of this world, and service is awesome.  Definitely a breath of fresh air."}
{"text":"Busy, busy! On a Saturday around noon, Morning Glory was slammed with hungry diners and the staff was visibly frazzled. I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich ($6) made with cheddar, gruyere and havarti and sliced tomatoes plus a side of rosti ($2). The sandwich prices seem reasonable ($5-8) until you realize there are no sides included - luckily there is a menu of sides to choose from (greens, rosti, bacon, etc.)

While the sandwich was decadent (three quality melted cheeses AND tomatoes, plus the light rye bread was crispy and sufficiently greased up), I had to subtract a star for the pitiful rosti. Though it tasted just like rosti should (perhaps the addition of paprika would spice it up, just sayin') the portion was pathetic - just a few shreds of potato that barely stuck together and definitely not $2 worth. I was anticipating a nice little hash brown patty rosti like the kind at Le Petit Dejeuner but this rosti definitely fell short. The worst part was that two of us got rosti and mine was the better looking of the two!!"}
{"text":"Amazing and friendly staff. We loved the Jimmy Screech and we have been coming back ever since! It was cheesy and we loved how the egg was in the middle of the sandwich. Though I would as to go light on the dijon as it was a bit strong. 

My wife had the french toast and it was delightful! 

The food is always on point and fresh and the coffee keeps on pouring. we loved the atmosphere and it was so close to the Body Blitz Spa!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. We thought we were going to a cafe but found this little jewel. The breakfast was as good as the atmosphere. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great breakfast/brunch spot on the east side of downtown.

Restaurant is really really small, so be prepared to wait for a table, and to smell whatever is cooking in the kitchen.

The service is acceptable, but nothing spectacular.  Food is generally quite good, as is the value.

Had a problem once where a group of us tried to get a table and were asked rather rudely by the staff to wait outside (it wasn't waiting outside weather).  We left feeling they didn't want our business, however I did follow up with the owner about our experience and they were quite apologetic.  It was probably just bad timing and the fact that the space is so small (it can get crowded fast).

Not my favourite brunch spot in Toronto, but well located and never a bad choice.

Closed Wednesdays (found that out the hard way)"}
{"text":"TOTALLY KEWL little place!  Who woulda thunk this farm would be pretty much in metro Phoenix?  There are several restaurants on the property and the only one with breakfast is MG located at the far back.  So don't make the mistake we did and stop at the first one - keep on going til you can't go no more.  And be prepared that all the dining for this place is outside under some large trees.

Prices were a little higher than other places BUT you have to consider that they are using a lot of fresh produce grown right there so that's worth something.  I seriously LOVED the biscuit - homemade, tender and very slightly saltyish.  It was fantastic.  Not a huge fan of the self-serve coffee and juice thing but it definitely is efficient for the servers.  Service was great.

Take some time afterwards to walk around the perimeter and visit the little shop and pick up some fresh veggies."}
{"text":"The Morning Glory Cafe was ok. The greeting staff was great, however it did take twenty minutes to have someone finally take our order and I had to say something to someone to make that happen. That aside, the food was great. They don't offer sodas, but the self served water, lemonade and tea was cool. It's an average place on a farm like setting."}
{"text":"We drove up this morning and were a bit confused to find the cafe closed. Several other people were there staring at the deserted cafe and wondering where the staff was. We had all read this message on the cafe's website:

\"From 6/4 to 6/19 Morning Glory will only be Open on Weekends.\"

Wouldn't you think that means they are still open on Thursday June 2nd?  Apparently, they meant to say \"closed weekdays starting 5/30\", but aren't so good with the English language.

Oh well, it's a beautiful farm and almost worth driving out here just for the scenery. Ok, not really. If you are reading this, Morning Glory owners, please learn to communicate your seasonal closing dates  correctly next year."}
{"text":"All I can say is, \"wow.\" 5 star food, 6 star location/scenery, just an incredible dining experience for a crisp, Sunday morning. Yes you have to get your own water/coffee and yes the service is a bit inconsistent. If you can't get past that, then I recommend Denny's. They're all over the place. If you can dig a relaxed pace in a very serene, almost bucolic setting in the middle of the desert with the best monte cristo I've ever had, then head over to Morning Glory. Can't wait to try the dinner restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a delicious and relaxing breakfast at this hidden oasis in Phoenix Arizona. All of the dishes at Morning Glory Cafe are made from locally grown ingredients and the menu changes seasonally. Service is good and prices are fair. They do close for the summer beginning in early June and reopen early August. I look forward to coming back the next time I'm in Arizona."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Whenever you would like an outdoor place to enjoy and eat in peace I highly recommend it here. Their food is always fresh, and hot. The waitresses are always nice, and friendly and constantly checking on you."}
{"text":"S found this place on Yelp and suggested I try it out during my visit here in Arizona.

The Morning Glory Cafe is located at the Farm at South Mountain which has their own organic farm on premise. Their hours are limited to serving breakfast - but, oh my, do they do breakfast good!

I ordered Chef Manuel's chicken enchiladas topped with two eggs over easy. I know, I know - it's a cardio slam, but it was worth every biteful! The enchiladas were filled with an herb roasted chicken breast that was savory and moist. The tomatillo sauce that topped the entire dish was one of the best I've ever had - a little bit of tang, but oh so flavorful! I sat savoring every single bite!

The beverages are self-service. The coffee, tea, orange juice and lemonade are available."}
{"text":"Overpriced. I got The Cornelius sandwich and the boyfriend got the Jimmy Screech. The side salad that the sandwich came with was barely there. The portion was overall small for an almost $10 price tag. The place's small, but quiet cute with some \"vintage\" decor. It could use some more ventilation because my jacket and hair smelled liked fried egg and ham for the rest of the day. Unfortunately, I won't go back."}
{"text":"This is such a cute and cozy little breakfast spot. It is on a quiet farm with patio seating. The atmosphere was lovely. They have a self serve coffee, lemonade and water station which was super convenient. 

We ordered the Chilaquiles and the American Breakfast. If you like breakfast nachos, you would absolutely love the Chilaquiles with chorizo. It's just enough spice too! 

The American breakfast was perfect. Scrambled eggs, farm home fries with peppers and onions, bacon and a side of biscuits and gravy. The bacon and home fries were the star of the dish! I wish the gravy would have been a little thicker and for the biscuit to be softer but overall, it was pretty good. 

The bloody Mary's were absolutely delicious! We just had to get seconds. 

We are excited to come back and try more things from the menu!"}
{"text":"Great place, totally didn't mind that it was a $40 breakfast for two (we had a mimosa, coffee and oj, which added a lot to the bill). If you dont' load up on drinks your bill won't be so bad. The food was exceptional and the atmosphere cannot be beat. So nice on a beautiful sunny day with 74 degree temps. Really gorgeous.  Go before 10 am on a Sunday or it will be totally crazy busy.  Overall a great place and we'd go back."}
{"text":"Great small local cafe for a bite to eat. My boyfriend and I came by on a Saturday for brunch as another restaurant we wanted to dine at was closed for the day. We were greeted by friendly staff and given menus promptly. We both ordered the BLT, grilled cheese, and a cup of daily soup (butternut squash). For drinks we got an americano and a mint tea. The cafe has a friendly, local, warm vibe and even though we arrived at 12:30pm to a fairly empty restaurant, the place was packed by 1pm. Overall, great sandwiches and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"A quite delicious breakfast/brunch spot with outstanding fresh food.

Mimosas are very good, bloody Marys are a little heavy on the horseradish for my liking. Coffee is ok.

Outdoor seating only and out door heating for chilly mornings.

If you're in the mood for a nice breakfast nook of a spot with \"can't go wrong\" dishes, this is a place to be."}
{"text":"I do love the atmosphere out here - very fresh in the glorious outdoors. But the flies.... ew. The food is well-prepared and the selection is marvelous. Love the homemade granola, the flavorful omelets, and the coffee is terrific. Good service too. But remember you're outdoors and there are bugs."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. When the weather is cool, this outdoor place is perfect. The food is great, I love the Money Cristo. And the baked goods are delish. Great brunch spot. And you can play corn hole in one of the open areas!"}
{"text":"I liked my breakfast and so did my partner but I do find the \"help yourself to lemonaide or ice tea or water\" a bit misleading.  I saw the sign that it was 2.75, but I dont think a lot of people do so they end up paying for drinks they think are free.  I had an egg white omelette with mushrooms, mozzarella and marinara sauce.  The home fries were good and the biscuit was tasty( although small).  My partner had the classic american breakfast and it was advertised as 2 eggs, but seemed like a lot more.  We ordered a muffin that was tasty but once again I had an issue.  The menu said 2.50, but we were charged 2.95.  The mistake was fixed once I pointed it out, but how often has that happened?"}
{"text":"What a unique and scenic place to dine in Phoenix! Definitely not your typical Arizona desert landscape. I've been here twice now and I think it will be a go-to spot, in the non-summer months, to bring out-of-state guests. Reminds me of a Cali vineyard - so I think it's kind of cool to show visitors that places like this exist here in the Valley.

The first time you come here it can be a bit tricky to find because you have to pull in and drive all the way back the the dirt road to the gravel parking lot. Once you park, you can walk down to the cafe. The cafe has all outdoor seating so don't expect AC or any other indoor accommodations. I've never used their restrooms so I'm not sure what they are like or even where they are located. They do have lots of shaded tables but it still gets hot so I really recommend coming as early as possible. On my most recent visit, we arrived at 9:30am and by the time we left around 10:30/11am it was already pretty hot! (It's May.) Because of this, their hours of operation are very limited and they close early (11am on weekdays and 1pm on weekends).

Delicious sweet and savory breakfast options. Talk about fresh, this is legit farm to table dining as I believe they even get their eggs from the chicken coop which you have a direct view of at your table. You can even walk over and check out the coop if you so desire (I haven't yet).  Self serve water, coffee, juice in coolers at a little station. In terms of the food, I've only tried savory items but next time I plan to splurge and try one of their sweet dishes.

Both times I've dined here early on a weekday so it wasn't busy and there was no wait. I've heard it gets busy on weekends. The service was pretty good but also not super speedy either time. I think this is the kind of place you're expected to sit, chill, enjoy the scenery, and maybe leisurely catch up with someone. Not a place to come if you're in a rush.

It says it's child friendly but I'd be reluctant to bring my toddler: a.) because of the sun and heat; and b.) because I can almost guarantee they'd want to run through the garden and fields - which is probably ok with management (?) but would most definitely result in a dirt fest. Then again, I am reluctant to dine out with my toddler just about anywhere!

I dream of hosting (or at the very least attending) an event here on The Farm at South Mountain's gorgeous grounds. I'm going to go ahead and add that to my bucket list! 

Come here if you want to escape the desert and experience a unique farm to table breakfast."}
{"text":"Absolutely adore this place! I always want to go whenever I'm in town cause it's just picture perfect. I've been to the farm for lunch before and morning glory was the best farm to table breakfast. 

I had the waffles with fresh berries. The waffle was light and airy and just a touch of sweetness with the berries and syrup. The breakfast sandwiches were delicious! Great portions and love the self serve coffee bar. 

Service was great. Beautiful view of the farm and love the outdoor seating of the picnic tables to take it all in. A perfect way to start the day."}
{"text":"3.5, but the grounds and surroundings make me comfortable rounding up.

We went here for brunch in January, and I had the South Mountain Omlette at the Morning Glory Cafe for bunch - the goat cheese was generous, creamy, and tangy.  And the salsa verde was drizzled so that I got a little in every bite.

My companion got the veggies with truffle oil, which were super tasty and served in a very hot skillet.  The portions were pretty generous, even though everything was a couple dollars more than I thought was necessary.

Especially since you have to get your own coffee and water.  

Also, it was a nippy winter morning, and the fire-stick-heater thing by us wasn't lit.  We had to ask twice before someone brought the warmth back.

That being said, though, I would absolutely come back for brunch on a lazy weekend, and take my precious time lounging in the garden patio, checking out the scenery and being serenaded by happy chickens."}
{"text":"Ughhhhh, what an awful experience. The Farm is beautiful though so five stars for that. The wait was 1 hour and forty minutes. We only waited because we had a cold, Land Lubber visiting from snow country. We sat at the picnic tables soaking op the 97 degree day. Or at least she did. We were hot. 

Then, after waiting all that time we were told to get our own drinks.The drinks were self serve, huh? We then waited 40-50 more minutes for our food to be delivered. There were all types of issues with the food. In fact, what they did was a bit unethical in our mind switching ingredients in the special and not telling us or the servers until it hit the table. They did not inform the other wait staff either. We watched other servers taking orders for a dish that they supposedly ran out of it. But the catch was, they did not really run out of it. It was all very confusing and strange. The chef and managers here need to work on their communication skills. 

I ordered the Best sandwich and it was not aptly named.  My food was cold. The only reason I did not send it back was because after waiting almost 3 hours I was starving. It was not good at all. It lacked any type of flavor and again it was cold. 

We had a lot of other dishes on the table to try.  The biscuits and gravy were also cold. They did bring us a new one on that one. I must say, they are actually pretty good here. After complaining, my two friends finally got their dish after they said they ran out. Still am confused on that. Did they really run out? If so, how did they make it? They did say it was very good. 


I gave two stars instead of one because the other dishes were said to be good and the place has really nice ambience. The servers are also nice. It was not their fault. They tried to make up for it and seemed sorry. I think we would have preferred a comp though. ( And I never ask for that.)

All in all, I would never wait almost two hours to eat breakfast ever again and the food is expensive for what we got. I have been wanting to try Quinessence for awhile. I might give that one a try some day but pass on the Morning \"unglorious\" experience."}
{"text":"Beautiful oasis in the midst of everything. Food was excellent and it was a calming spot on our way to the airport."}
{"text":"Good Morning Y'all!  It's breakfast time!  Wake up sleepy head and let's go to the Farm at South Mountain for some Morning Glory, ie good breakfast.  

Morning Glory is one of 3 restaurants on the Farm at South Mountain.  As you may have guessed, this is the restaurant that serves breakfast.  I bring all my out of town guests here that like to get up and have a nice breakfast.  The atmosphere can't be beat.  All the seating is outdoor/patio seating.  When you are sitting back there, you completely forget that you are sitting in a farm in the middle of Phoenix!

I usually order lite breakfast items like a couple eggs and a toast, but I've tried the French bread there and I enjoyed it.  My friends have all enjoyed their meals as well.  I also enjoy their coffee.  

For the novice, you will find Morning Glory all the way at the end of the drive onto the Farm.  I would recommend parking in the spaces at the end of the drive instead of using the parking lot just east of 32nd St.  You can take a walking tour around the section of the organic farm adjacent to Morning Glory.  There's a chicken coop right there and you can see some of the produce.  The green house to the east of the chicken coop.  And you might find that the artist's studio is open that day, it would be west of the chicken coop.

The patio seating is friendly to dogs, but don't take your dog beyond the perimeter of the restaurants.  Maya's farm is an organic farm and you can't take dogs in the area where the plants are growing!  Watch out for the signs that warn you if you bring your pooch to b'fast with you.

Morning Glory is a solid option for breakfast.  I especially like to invite visitors there for breakfast.  You will like it too.  Trust me."}
