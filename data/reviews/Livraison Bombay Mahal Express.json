{"text":"Ordered a few times: naan breads are ok and the rest is adequate. Last delivery got bad: their prices did not match their website and were even higher than their prices on \"just eat\". Also \"with naan or rice\" apparently does not apply for deliveries...and there was a hidden delivery fee, i. e. its a scam. Never again for me. (Also, no-one speaks french)."}
{"text":"The food was decent, however, the wait for delivery was over an hour AND they forgot one of the 2 mains that we ordered. We called, the owner apologized and said he'd send over the food and a refund in about 25 minutes, which sounded great. Over 45 minutes later, the food still wasn't at our house and when we called to ask, the owner said that the money and not the food was on the way over, and that we had never asked for another order, and was extremely rude. Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Solid Indian Take-Out.  While this is not my preferred Indian take-out spot on the Plateau, it *is my back-up. The thali is reasonably priced, and the selection of dishes is usually pretty fresh. Their samosas are also reliable.  Definitely worth stopping by if you're in the neighbourhood and hankering for some curry."}
{"text":"Warning: HOT HOT HOT! Had takeout chicken biryani last night and it burned my south asian khatta desi garam masala conditioned stomach. My sister and other desi friends love the overbearing spice effect though. For me, I'm a flavour and balance person and I thought the hot aspect strongly overshadowed any other flavour spectrum of the biryani. Great of you are a fan of super hot desi food. My favourite in montreal is still Student Tasty Biryani."}
{"text":"I really like their thali for takeout. It's cheap, delicious and filling. I really like the curry chicken and vegetable curry and of course the daal."}
{"text":"Service?  It's like they are running a monopoly.    First I was told there is a 25$ minimum.  This does not help since I am home alone.  Good luck to singles out there, who are probably a large market.  So I say I'll call back and add an extra thing or two. I call back, boom, need to take my number to call me back.  10 mins go by.  They call back.  Apparently they can't deliver to me because I'm too far, even though they have delivered before.  Done!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight (we got takeaway) and the food was delicious. The staff was friendly and very kind, and the young guy serving me suggested we get delivery next time to save us some hassle. I would definitely eat here again. My favourite dish was the veggie pakora - they were a little salty but quite good.  Of note, when paying debit you are prompted to tip and are not given the option of zero tip - I don't usually tip when ordering takeaway so I feel this was a little unnecessary."}
{"text":"We hadn't had Indian food in a while and Namaste was full, so we walked a bit more to Bombay Mahal. The location is fairly small, but there's a least 6 tables in the dining room.   We got butter chicken with extra naan and a thali. The food hit the spot. The dishes were greasy and flavourful, perfect for rice and naan to soak up. The mango lassi we got was the only correct answer to the spiciness of the food. And it was cheap!! For 7.99$, you get a thali with two vegetable options and one meat option (I got lamb). These come with salad, a samosa, rice and two slabs of naan. The salad was a bit wilted, but who cares when everything will be mixed with creamy butter chicken! I do recommend choosing the thali instead of a \"single dish\" menu item. The butter chicken was at least 3$ more expensive than the thali, with less variety and smaller total amount of food.   It was a quick and very satisfying meal! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery when we were too lazy to head to Little India for some good Indian food.  Prices were fine and the food was great.  It did take about an hour to show up so in the future I'd probably be sure to call well ahead of time.  Really good samosas, delicious lamb madras and the butter chicken was nice too.  Also went to their location to eat in but as there was a street fair we couldn't get a Thali plate but got some nice containers with chicken biryani, butter chicken, samosas again and good mango lassi.  Very inexpensive for a good meal."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cheap north-Indian thali. No need to venture out to Parc Ex. You can get it fresh right here in the Plateau! There are a few meat options (butter chicken, lamb, etc.), and a few veggie options (dhal, mix veg, palak paneer, channa masala, etc.) and it's all delicious. It comes with rice, chapatti, and samosa. They have loyalty cards - so stamp away! They used to have students discount, but that was discontinued for some reason :(. I usually pick up the food myself, so I can't speak for the delivery option. There's limited sitting there. The staff is friendly and the fragrances are sensational! They now accept credit cards - not only debit / cash.  This is my go-to Indian take-out place."}
{"text":"ça aurait été 3,5 en fait Je ne suis pas du tout une experte de la cuisine indienne, c'est seulement la 2ème fois que j'en mange. Mais c'était vraiment très bon !! Nous avons pris à la livraison et c'est arrivé en seulement 20-30mn. Les portions sont assez généreuses, ce qui fait qu'un poulet au beurre + un agneau korma nous feront 2 repas (à 2). J'ai vraiment aimé, c'est une belle découverte :)"}
{"text":"Really yummy! Any of the Thali dishes are delicious! Came here with friends and we ALL ENJOYED it a lot! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great, reasonably priced Indian food. The staff is quite nice, depending on who is working, and the samosas are fantastic."}
{"text":"Okay at best. Was visiting montreal and needed a late dinner. Called this place and hey said they had seating as well as take out.  There was a bar with stools. Not what I expected. The food was meh. Geared towards college kids who don't know any better. Our dinners were luke warm and dry. I expect that was because it was late. But that speaks to quality control. Anyway I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Biriyani one of the best in Montreal. Delivery time is also good in the lower plateau area.   The only downside would be that it's expensive for the type of food and environment.   Overall a positive experience."}
{"text":"Are you freaking kidding me? Not only is it CASH ONLY for delivery in the year 2014, but there is a 25$ minimum required; it also didn't help that their attitude was so off the charts rude either. Just suck it up and go to the Jean Talon location cause this place certainly ain't worth it. It's like, -20 C out there tonight and all I wanted was some GD palak paneer, way to kill a dream Bombay Mahal Express, way to kill a dream."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! We got take out and ordered a broad range of the menu. Everybody loved it and we all kept commenting on what a great place this is. I had the Shahi Paneer and it had an incredibly creamy rich flavor I've never tasked before.  I live in LA and eat a lot of Indian food, I'll be craving this back home."}
