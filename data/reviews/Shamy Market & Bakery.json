{"text":"Love this place I had a Shamy cheese it was so delicious can't wait to come back again. Workers are also very helpful and nice."}
{"text":"This family owned Middle Eastern market has desserts, warm and cold snacks including pastries filled with spinach and cream cheese, rolls filled with cream cheese sweetened and flavored with rose essence, parfaits, hot tea and other Middle Eastern favorites as well as hookahs and accessories for sale. They warm up the snacks in a brick fire oven. They also have a grocery store on one side with everything from Middle Eastern yogurt drinks cheeses, honey, produce, and other Middle Eastern foods. Lana at the front register was super nice, great customer service. Inside it's roomy and very clean and very well-kept. Well deserving of your time and business."}
{"text":"I like the store, it's run by the owner and I had a nice talk with him and his nice family. The best thing is the food, it's awesome, I can't get enough of their bakeries."}
{"text":"Awesome service, great food, and a good selection of ethnic groceries to choose from. The \"pies\" they sell are super tasty, especially the one with cheese! I'll definitely be coming back here for breakfast or lunch when I'm wanting something quick, easy, and delicious!"}
{"text":"I really liked how friendly and helpful they are. They explained their menu in details as it was my first time there. The food is clean and delicious. Most importantly food has an authentic mediterranean taste. I would definitely recommend their meet flatbread which I believe it's Shamy Safiha."}
{"text":"Awesome bakery! They make authentic middle eastern baked breads that are delicious. I ordered when I arrived and it took about 15 minutes. Everything was super fresh. Calling ahead is a good idea if you know what you want to order and save time. It's family owned/run and everyone was really nice. They also have a big variety of middle eastern grocery items that are comparably priced to other local markets. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, store is beautiful and clean, and a huge assortment of items to choose from. Most importantly, the service is absolutely top notch. I highly recommend Shamy."}
{"text":"Been there few times already, the meat pie and cheese pie to die for. Totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great new Middle Eastern store and bakery; I came across it as I was looking for new restaurants in Mesa. The market side has a lot of ME food products on the shelves. They also have a fridge and freezer section where u could find frozen veggies, frozen bread and even Paratha's and chappatis. You will also find different types of cheese. 

There are also some fresh fruits and veggies. The selection is limited so far but you can get some essentials such as tomatoes, cucumber, fresh mint, etc. 

The bakery section is pretty big and they make different types of manaeesh. They have about 10 different selections. Today, my husband and I decided to try the mhamra with cheese, the meat pie, in 2 different styles, Syrian and Lebanese, as well as zaatar. Manaeesh are kinda similar to a thin crust pizza pie. The dough tasted really good. My favorite was the zaatar and Lebanese meat pie. The mhamra is a spicy chili paste and with cheese, it tastes somewhat like a delicious spicy pizza. 

Service is excellent. The owners are very nice and very welcoming. I am always very excited to see more Middle Eastern stores open in the valley, especially on the east side! We will be visiting again very soon."}
{"text":"I was in the area looking for a breakfast option and nothing was open. I walked in because they have a bakery, but had no idea what I was coming in to. The cashier Sali helped me pick a bakery item, the cheese boat, and she and a cook from the back made it quickly and it tasted great. I also got some chocolate filled biscuits from the market. Great place. Fast, clean and friendly. I appreciate you! I should have gotten more than one boat!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Manaeesh (Mediterranean pie with dry thyme olive oil and sesame seeds) also the meat pie and cheese are amazing! All freshly made to order. I you can't travel to Lebanon, Syria or other well known areas in those regions to taste this then you're in luck. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The bakery in Shamy makes the best pies and sweets, we had cheese and spinach pies, and baklava and everything was super delicious"}
{"text":"Great authentic middle eastern food. Excellent service. I enjoyed their various bakery products. Their market has good varieties."}
{"text":"A grocery store and Middle Eastern bakery all in one! Shamy (Pronounced Sham-mee) has ridiculously cheap, freshly made flatbreads and pies, as well as freshly made desserts. We ordered a few flatbread items (Zataar with cheese and Safiha armani) and a spinach pie. 

The breads are all made fresh on the spot in their brick oven and only took a few minutes to make. The zataar with cheese had a great balance of the zataar spice with cheese and the flatbread was lightly crisp. The safiha armani was also tasty, with an even layer of well seasoned ground beef with vegetables. I enjoyed the spinach pie as well. It had a generous amount of spinach with a tangy flavor (I think maybe there's some pomegranate in it). The flatbread was $2.99 and the spinach pie was a whopping $.99. :D

We browsed in the grocery section too, which had lots of unique candies, cookies, herbs, condiments, and syrups (Just to name a few). 

What really set this shop apart from others is the very friendly service. When we entered the shop we were immediately greeted and the lovely lady at the counter explained to us the menu in detail and was very open to answering any questions we had about the menu or any items sold at the store. 

So for great service, reasonably priced delicious food, and unique items in their store, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great little market/bakery and the flatbread was delicious.  We tried the Zaatar & cheese flatbread and the Safiha Shami flatbread and they were both very tasty!  Also tried the dessert chocolate/nutella flatbread and it was delicious.  All very fresh and different than I've ever had anywhere else.  We also shopped around and they had some great cheeses and baklava/desserts that we got to go.  Highly encourage anyone to give them a trie, and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Authentic Syrian cuisine at its finest. I once bought traditional Knafeh for my work to try and they all loved it. Friendly staff who are willing to help meet your needs. Did I mention, you can buy your middle eastern produce and products there too!"}
{"text":"This place is family owned and the family is so sweet and so helpful!!! I cannot wait to come
Back and try their baked goods and especially their Syrian desserts!!!"}

{"text":"My mom and I found this market while shopping at the Big Lots near the Fiesta Mall shopping center. It is family owned and has all sorts of food and home items from the Middle East. It also has a bakery. My mom and I ordered some food and it was excellent! The price of the bakery food is awesome as well. We also bought some middle eastern treats. They were delicious with our tea and coffee.

We will definitely be going back. The family who runs the store is really nice and helpful. The food is excellent. This is such a unique store. I highly recommend checking it out."}
