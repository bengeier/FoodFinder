{"text":"This is my new favorite spot! This used to be some shady italian place but after renovation it turned to a cute little cafe. I couldn't resist going in. I was greeted by the nice owner and the interior was nice! I had the iced coffee, which was very nicely prepared, and had the pork donburi. Tasted quite awesome. I will come back and try others."}

{"text":"This place used to be an Italian café. I'm not sure when it changed hands, but I don't think it's that long ago. I noticed it because of its cute name (neko = cat)! The owners are a young couple (you can spot their child's high chair in the dining room). 

They designed Café Neko to be a \"comptoir asiatique\", a sort of café/restaurant where you can stop by quickly to grab ice tea and ice cream, or sit down for a good meal. Their meal menu offers mainly udon noodles and donburi (rice bowls with meat, veggies or tofu on top). They have a few uncommon items, such as black sesame rice krispies. Interestingly, they also sell vegan kimchi, which I take is kimchi made either without fish sauce (the only animal product used in kimchi-making) or with vegan fish sauce. Prices are affordable, but some items seem a bit more expensive. For example, a single homemade mochi was priced at 2$. 

We were on our way to an appointment, so we just grabbed homemade ice tea and milk tea. Their summer promotion offers these at 1$ and 1.50$, respectively, so it cost 2.88$ total! So cheap!! Both drinks were nice and refreshing, and not sweet at all. The iced green tea, in particular, was almost bitter, which is actually pleasant if you like tea a lot.

A nice spot! We're looking forward to go eat there!"}
{"text":"We stopped by super quickly for a morning iced milk tea and a breakfast pastry as our AirBnB was around the corner, and it was lovely. The place plays great music (Hayao Miyazaki was playing when I came in and my heart immediately belonged to Cafe Neko). The Hong Kong iced milk tea I got was hand made and it was probably one of the best I've ever tried. The owners (I assume) are a lovely young couple who even had their young baby in strapped to their chests which was sooooo cute, and they made everything for us by hand and to order. I made sure to leave a nice tip for them, I appreciate the artisan quality of what they offer. Definitely give this place a try if you're ever near the plateau in Montreal, and definitely try the Hong Kong iced milk tea."}
{"text":"Ordered from Café Neko though foodora so I can't comment on the setting or service. I had the BBQ pork rice bowl and it was delicious! The pork was cooked perfectly and the dish had a really nice balance of flavours. I also tried their sesame noodles, but they weren't to my taste - I found the dish to be a little too bland. I'd definitely recommend this place though, and look forward to trying their other rice bowls!"}
{"text":"OH-EM-GEE!! Adorable and scrumptious Japanese food. Place opened about 2 months ago and thanks to Yelp I discovered this spot while searching for an easy fix for my hunger in my neighborhood. The Plateau never ceases to surprise me with cosy eateries and refine food. My motivation was lured towards the salmon tataki rice bowl. Very fresh. Decided to have a dessert for a change and I did not regret my little green tea tiramisu. 

P.S.-They have weekly specials which consist of, I think 3 choices."}
