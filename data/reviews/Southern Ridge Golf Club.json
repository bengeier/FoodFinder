{"text":"In a market that is known for it's golf this course leaves a lot to be desired. My wife and I are avid golfers and we love to take advantage of Groupon deals for golf in the area. We purchased this Groupon for $50. This gave us a day of golf, cart, range balls and lunch. So let's start with the range. Keeping in mind that the range is not the most important thing about a golf course, it still does matter. The range had NO grass besides where you were hitting from. It was like hitting balls into the abyss. After we finish up there we move on to the 1st hole which is across the street and down a sidewalk. You would expect signs leading you to the first hole but there was not. Fortunately the guy in the pro shop was aware and came out to tell us as he saw us asking others where to find the first hole. Now to the course itself. This course was in horrible condition. I understand that we overseed during certain times of the year here but never have I played a course during this time that was in this poor of condition. First off, there is dirt everywhere around this course. The sand traps were hard as a rock, it was almost like hitting out of cement when we landed there. But viewing them, it looked like an old dried up river. While on the course it was so loud! Keep in mind we played on a Sunday, yet they had guys out there seeding??? On a Sunday? Really? Back to the noise factor...I understand they can't control the residents that live on the course but some trees might help filter out the noise and keep kids from throwing water bottles onto the golf course. This happened on the 2nd hole while we were playing. In the middle of swinging, all of the sudden there is a water bottle plowing into the fairway. Nice... Over all the course was just awful. The worst I have played in the valley. From the huge dirt patches throughout, to the dead sod all around that has been neglected to the dried up lake beds for sand traps, it just doesn't add up. When you decide to put your golf course on Groupon and try to get business I would hope that you would make sure your course is in WAY better condition. We will not be going back. It's unfortunate because the course has potential. The buildings are updated, and the infrastructure is nice. Heck the bathroom on the course was one of the nicest. Unfortunately the playing area was just horrible."}
{"text":"Pretty rough shape and ugly to boot. Most muni courses better than this one.  Lots of dirt - ugly.  Fairways clumpy,  Course is boring.  One water hole.  Zero doglegs.  Minimal bunkers. Can't think of a reason to play this again or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Great little spot to eat that is not a typical chain restaurant. Good food and customer service driven! Awesome burgers and chicken sandwiches and the ONION RINGS ARE AWESOME!!!! Very affordable. Stop patronizing the Laveen chain restaurants that serve the frozen food (yes that's you Applebee's)."}
{"text":"First, the staff was wonderful.  However, the course was horrible.  We heard that it was recently purchased, and the owner is going through an improvement period. That doesn't change the fact that were was standing water throughout; the greens were terrible (back nine better than the front); the tee boxes were 35% weeds and the fairways ... well, it wasn't good. It's an $18 round at best.  Give it another year and hopefully it will improve."}
{"text":"I don't know what course Matt played in 2011, but it wasn't this one. Maybe over the past 2 years the clearly serious neglect of the course has taken its toll. Jeff C and G.G. were spot on. Not sure why G.G. gave it 2 stars. Here is a very simple way to identify what you're about to be in for: What is one thing that you find at every tee box, on every course - hint has to do with cleaning your golf ball. Yup, a ball washer. There was not a single ball washer on the course - not one!! There were, however, two 5 gallon buckets (I forget at which holes) that had water in them for you to clean your.......club? I'll tell you this, I wasn't about to put my hand in there to wash my golf ball. Heck, I didn't even stick my club in it because it was so nasty looking.  Folks, this course was bad!! Bad, bad, bad. From Jeff's comments about the driving and the abyss, to the score card which, by the way is BACKWARDS - yes, backwards. You might tee off on the #1 hole, but you need to keep track on your score card starting with the 10th hole!  Like Jeff, I too used a Groupon which came with lunch as he mentioned. I got a \"Bratwurst\". Why did I use quotation marks around Bratwurst? Simple, that's what the snippy little girl behind the counter called. Last time I checked, gray was not a color of food one should be eating. I took one bite, and into the trash with the rest of it.  I'll tell you something else, I received 2 of these Groupons for my birthday. I took my brother-in-law out with the first one. The second one, well, let's just say I'll be telling my folks a little white lie that I used it but in actuality, I didn't even waste the ink or paper to print it out. It is now in cyber heaven (or in this case, cyber-hell just like where this golf course should be)..............  I have no idea how Matt gave this place 5 stars and called it a good mix of everything. Maybe compared to Putt-putt...........mmmmm, no, not even compared to Putt-putt could I give this place 5 stars. That would be an insult to Putt-putt,  In case you're still thinking about this place to play let me end with this: we played in early December. It hadn't rained out here in weeks (imagine that in the desert) and yet, there were 4 holes with standing water from the edge of the green to about 30 yards out.  Nuff' said................"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the course. Was disappointed they don't have a walking rate but the course is fun. It has 6 par 5's which is pretty rare. The greens needed a little work when I played. The condition overall was very playable. Good tee boxes, decent fairways, good sand. Not too pricey."}
{"text":"Southern Ridge is an exceptionally friendly golf course. Although the driving range is bare and dirt covered, the course is very nice and player friendly.  The holes weave throughout the homes and cotton fields. The par 5's are lengthy and the par 3's play true to distance.  In the past, the clubhouse had contracted with a great bbq vendor and the smell of smoked brisket was overwhelming.  I highly recommend this course for all levels of golfers and the deals you can find online can't be beat."}
{"text":"Golf courses in the summer time in arizona are a bit tough to grade because of the severe water restrictions most courses have in place. Most really nice ones take a step back in terms of course conditions while the ones that are affordable during the peak part of the season can be barely playable during the dog days of summer. Southern Ridge Golf course or as it was formerly known as Bougainvilla is unfortunately on the latter side. The value is here (I think we paid 15 a person on GolfNow) but Its hardly worth it. Aside from a few lush patches of fairway there is alot of hard dirt and gravel all waiting to greet you if hit one off the fairway or in a \"sand\" trap. We played in the heart of the summer and course conditions aside the layout is a bit of a head scratcher. It seemed like the par 3's were a bit lengthy yet the 4's and 5's werent all that long or challenging. Oh and not to mention a nice long par 3 to start off the back 9. Huh? If you have to play a course in this area try Vistal or Aguila, both slightly more expensive but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Our church group had an outing at Southern Ridge. They really did a great job in helping us get it organized. The rates were very good and the customer service was excellent in every way. The restaurant section did a great job of getting all of us our food and drinks after our round. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Update: We called back the very next day about situation a few days later we received a call back, took longer than expected to hear back but GM Nick was very understanding and professional about the situation at hand. We appreciate that he took time to review everything he needed to. We've yet to return but have been asked for a second chance.     WE WERE ATTACKED by an employee's S/O.  My boyfriend and his brother went golfing Sunday, there was absolutely no water to be found on the course for starters. It may have not been a very hot day compared to summer but we're still in Arizona doing physical activity AND there's a sign prohibiting any outside drinks or food at the entrance. Well then their carts run on gas and about half way through their game my boyfriend and I make over 14 calls to the clubhouse and the restaurant combined because the light gas went off and we were afraid we might get stranded out there. No answer. We make the decision to drive back to find out that the clubhouse closes at 3pm and that's why no one answered. Justifiably upset a complaint was made (cuss words were used but never directed at anyone as per what I heard) to which the manager, Yvette Posey, replied to by calling my boyfriend a fat-ass, he exited the building with every intention on making an official complaint at this point. Upon making our way to our car YVETTE'S BOYFRIEND starts to verbally ATTACK and yell at my bf and his brother, also proceeds to call him a fat-ass as did the employee and girl friend of this man. Once Yvette decided to exit the restaurant to continue to yell at my boyfriend (needless to say very unprofessional for any employee) this woman's boyfriend proceeds to PULL A CLUB from his cart and SWINGS A DRIVER AT MY BF AND HIS BROTHER BOTH all while this woman is yelling at my boyfriend inches from his face and they continue to both yell insults at him. IF YOU'D LIKE TO BE ASSAULTED BY THE EMPLOYEE'S BOYFRIENDS AND FEAR FOR YOUR LIFE THIS PLACE IS FOR YOU."}
{"text":"This was a true value for 25 bones on fathers day. Very tough and well thought out course with a good mix of everything including old pokes in front of you making the experience last all day. I shot a 90 (18 over on this par 72) and had a blast with my dad and talking to the guys who work there. Good ambiance, great golf, 4 sets of tees to play off of like a championship course. Not a ton of tight holes where you can hit it 3 blocks over with a slice. Check it out before it gets too hot, wait..."}
{"text":"THE WORST EVER........................................................................................................   OMG $36.00 plus for this.. If i could give a negative i would.. Never I mean never have I ever played a course that was worse than this for any money.. This place should pay you to waste your time. The fairways or what once maybe fairways are all weeds at best,, When you did find a patch of grass it was under water,,  Tee boxes Again the worst. If you want to play a golf course that is dirt ,, dirt , and more dirt with 30 yard wide weed filled fairways, a driving range that is again weeds and the driving area is yes wait all DIRT   Now let try me find something nice to say about this place. Still trying, Still trying, Still Trying, Ok i will say the breakfast i had was good, The restaurant was clean and the woman nice, If I wanted to golf never if I was across the street and wanted breakfast and a cup of joe,  I MIGHT come back  If you have a chance to play this track, My words to you is either stay in bed save your money or find ANYPLACE other than this. This course should really be embarrassed to even be part of Golf NOW.   THE WORST EVER  .."}
{"text":"Decent course for being in the middle of a neighborhood in phx. Not very friendly mngt. Did not feel welcomed in the slightest bit. Nor was he helpful. I returned the cart after 9 holes and he told me to drop it off in the correct area. Very poor customer service. The whole time, there were no other ppl around. I was treated like an annoyance.   I dont want special service or treatment but i know when im not welcome.   Side note- the marshall was present, courteous & helpful. The greens were clean. Fairways were nice, not perfect but good.   For all the other options in phx, i wont be returning here."}
{"text":"I haven't tried the food here just yet - but the value of this course, as well as the play are well worth the visit.  I consistently use the driving range for practice at a lower than average cost while the accessibility and play of the course are a major upside.  I was pleasantly surprised by the hospitality and accommodating nature of the General Manager - Martin Nelson who went out of his way to ensure the best Customer Experience during our first stop here (more to come)!  Glad to see this course is pushing to resurge in the south mountain/Laveen area!"}
{"text":"I recently just moved to Phoenix from Denver and played here about 1.5 months ago. I played about $16 which was unheard of back at home. Lol there's a reason why. Tons of weeds and dirt everywhere! Not the best conditioned course for sure. But for that amount I'm definitely not expecting a 4 star course. It wasn't challenging enough for me. All par 5s are really par 4s. This is only the 3rd course I've played since moving here, so I'm looking forward to finding a great course without breaking the bank too."}
