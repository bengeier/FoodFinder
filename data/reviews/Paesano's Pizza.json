{"text":"I live across the street from Paesano's, and I have to say, they make a pretty good pizza. It's an old school thick crust, heavy with toppings and cheese. The pricing is pretty fair too.

Why only 2 stars? Because they're always closed! Honestly, they have the most inconsistent hours that I've ever seen! Some nights, they're closed at 7:00pm, sometimes, they're open later than that. I'm not certain what time they open, either, because their hours aren't posted at the door. 

Many times, my pizza craving has had to go satisfied by franchise cardboard offerings because Paesano's doesn't want to be open when their customers want them to be.

They are conveniently located, and tasty. It's just too bad that I can't get in to order a pizza!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza - always a favourite at the office.  Made in an old fashioned stone oven.  Thick and delicious!  Shaw Go Wifi while you wait for it to be ready."}
{"text":"Went on whim one day and the guy working the front of the restaurant was extremely friendly and made sure he would be able to get the pizza done tout de suite like I'd asked, even asking for my phone number so he could call me to better convenience me. Now that's service! The pizza itself actually had the gooiest, freshest cheese and vegetables, and was definitely a great quality deep dish pizza. I would return but...? 

Giving them 3.5 for the quality of the pizza, but the establishment itself never seems to be open. I'm not sure if they're renovating, or closing down permanently, so."}
