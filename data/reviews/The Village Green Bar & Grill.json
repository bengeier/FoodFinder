{"text":"Great old school bar. Burgers are fantastic. The service is good .the price point is good for Middleton. Will be going back again."}
{"text":"I go almost every Wednesday for their \"French Dip\" which really is an Italian Beef and sweet potato fries.  Both are the best around, bar none!!! I've been going for about 12 years and the food is always fresh and delicious. Great atmosphere, typical Wisconsin Pub and everyone is friendly and service is great. I always take out of state business visitors there for lunch and now have return visitors always asking to go back to the pub. Highly recommend this place for great food at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Decent food at an affordable price. The exterior has no curb appeal but don't let that fool you. Village Green will satisfy your eating and drinking needs."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for what it is, a very friendly, neighborhood tavern.  The food is mostly fried and greasy but served with a little slice of love.  The specials are excellent and the value is top notch.  Want to watch a game?  They have a few big TV's and are very accommodating.  

If you are looking for high-end, posh dinning, this isn't your place.  Madison has plenty of excellent choices in that department.  This place is homey and will serve you a solid burger and fries, with a starter of wings and variety of homemade soups for a pretty good price.  Come in and see these guys, they do it right."}
{"text":"best cheese/bacon burger in town;; service is normal :: beer prices are good:: draft beer is never flat like toros and Original Joes"}
{"text":"Classic neighborhood bar.  Good strong drinks at good prices. I think the bar food is great (try the spudsters!)"}
{"text":"The very definition of a Wisconsin bar.  Good food and they make one of the best old fashioneds I've ever had.  I wish they were open on Sundays too."}
{"text":"Yummy food! Great service! Family friendly atmosphere! Great Prices!"}
{"text":"This is an OK place for Friday Night Fish Fry.  My daughter likes the Hush Puppies and Spudsters.  There is no choice of fish - you get deep-fried cod or nothing. The price is reasonable and the waitstaff is friendly."}
{"text":"The Village Green is a Wisconsin bar with Packer memorabilia, formica tables and mismatched chairs, and better than average food.  It wasn't the best burger I've ever had and the fries and mushrooms were frozen.  The corned beef sandwich was fresh but not fantastic.   But it was adequate and I'd return if I had a hankering for WI bar food.  
I felt like I'd been here before the minute I walked in - the menu and atmosphere were indistinguishable from other taverns I'd been to.  Their tap beer selection was good and its obvious they do a lot of business.  If this is what you are looking for, they do it well!"}
{"text":"A total dive but the burgers are seriously amazing. Bar tenders were friendly and the beer (limited) was cheap."}
{"text":"Want a burger?  Go here!  Price is a little on the high side for some of their dishes, but if your looking for a casual place to grab a beer and burger, this is the place."}
{"text":"Went there often as a child and loved it! Went back again with my son and both had burgers. Same awesome taste as I remember as a child! I haven't been there for 10 years and seemed like just yesterday I was there... friendly staff and still a pinball machine!!"}
{"text":"4 of us visited the Village Green for lunch after spending time at the National Mustard Museum. We ate here based on other Yelp reviews, particularly the one saying that the burgers are amazing. I am sorry to say that I disagree. It was all OK, but I had the double cheese burger, and the beef just tasted too salty to really enjoy. It wasn't dry or flavorless, but the flavor wasn't what I would expect from \"amazing' burgers. The others tries a variety of foods - and there is a wide variety on the menu - and everyone thought their food was OK. It just wasn't much more than OK."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers!!  The double cheeseburger special was out of this world!!  Totally accommodating to our hockey team!!!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Ordered two Friday night fish fries to go for $20.99 before tip. 

It comes with your choice of potato (potato salad or fries), two hush puppies, slaw,  and three pieces of cube shaped cod. 

They are generous with their fries.  The fish has the perfect amount of beer batter and is fork-flaky tender. Very good!  

The Staff is very attentive and friendly,  even for just s take-out order. 

I saw they have a basket of chocolate chip cookies by the cash register that patrons helped themselves to!  Very cool and quirky place :-)"}
{"text":"I was in town for a wedding and my brother searched yelp for a 4+ star eatery. This was the only one. For a good reason. 
While it is agreed that the place is not very good to look at, the food and service was exceptional. The atmosphere was very typical to a college pub on a weekend, though it was not very busy for a Friday night. 
I ordered the Big Daddy burger and it was among the best I've ever eaten. It is 2 patties, I believe quarter pounders, standard toppings lettuce, tomato, pickles and (super fresh) onions, 3 types of wisconsin cheese, mayo, ham, summer sausage and bacon. All with a knife through the crown bun. All for only $11. The fried cheese curds were also the best I've ever had. The clam chowder wasn't the best I've ever had, but it's worth noting that they don't skimp on the clams. The kids ordered chicken strips, and devoured them. I sampled some gumbo, the prime rib sandwich and sweet potato fries off of my sister-in-law's plate and they were delicious as well. 
The waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. There were televisions in the dining area as well as the bar area to watch the local baseball game. Heck, they even let me charge my phone b/c it died trying to find the place from my hotel. 
I suppose the only negative is that the women's bathroom was very crammed. My 13-year old daughter told me it was very small, even for her. 
There were video games there too, but the kids wanted to get back tot he hotel to swim so I' can't comment on their quality other than they are there.
Overall, the amount of food for the money is unlike anything I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"Great flat top grilled burgers, a must go for a cold beer and burger. The staff and regulars always make for a nice visit."}
{"text":"Nice little neighborhood bar with a laid back feel to it. The staff is super friendly and  I like that draft beers are always served with a smile. I'll be back to try the burgers!"}
{"text":"Good bar food. The Friday fish fry is hit or miss. Decent tap beer selection. Service is always very good."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for a burger! Ridiculously tasty. I've had a LOT of burgers in my life and nothing compares. The place is dive-y but it adds to the experience. Friendly staff. Decently priced. My only wish is that they had a bit more seating outside for the warmer months - Very limited. 

(I also recommend the fried green beans and spudsters.) Soooooo good!"}
{"text":"Went for the Friday fish fry - surprisingly good.  Batter was crispy, light, flavorful (beeer?). The fried green beans were nicely done, and the dipping sauce had just a bit of kick. Nice beer selection.  Casual, lots of families."}
{"text":"The Village Green restaurant was an excellent experience. I went with a big group of people (most of them intoxicated) but still had a wonderful time. We all got our drinks and food very quickly. My bacon cheeseburger was exquisite. Very good place for a cold Wisconsin evening. Keep it up Village Green I'll see you again in the future."}
{"text":"From the off-putting green bar front to the mediocre food served slowly in a 1962 paneled basement, this place screams its suckiness at full volume. Nothing is fresh, including the burgers, which are described as \"the best.\" Not hardly, pre-formed tasteless meat pucks would be about right. Locals may love it because it's close and their taste buds are already damaged. I don't know why anyone would go here twice."}
{"text":"Hard to pass up the Road Kill Burrito.  Ask for the bucket of sauces.
It was as good as when I tried it ten years ago as it was last week.
I don't think much has changed around here in 30 years, but that is definitely part of the charm.  I have heard the fish fry is good, but I have never been there on a Friday night.  
Lunch crowd has a lot of regular guys, quick and friendly service, prompt and hot food.  
Don't go looking for the lobster.  Go for the specials, burgers, beer or the burrito!"}
{"text":"A bit awkward. Kind of like the snack bar at a summer camp. Very nice people in there and the drinks were good. Decor was lacking, but I cant fault it much for that."}
{"text":"I've been living in Middleton for about 9 months now, and I'm giving the Village Green five stars for being excellent at what it is: a small, local bar with great service and interesting patrons.

To us, the Village Green is the place we go when we want to get out of the house for a drink and some company. Once you've been there a few times, everyone who works there begins to recognize you and seems glad to see you. They have a small menu of yummy fried items (Spudsters!), great burgers and sandwiches, and daily specials (love the French Dip on Wednesdays). All the food is cooked right behind the bar, and they keep their cooking equipment impeccably clean. They make good drinks and have a small but respectable selection of draft beers that meet the needs of both craft beer lovers and Miller Lite-types. Bartenders are not afraid to do a shot of whiskey with you, and many of the regular patrons will buy you a drink if you chat with them. 

The Green is owned by two brothers who are almost always there, cooking or bartending. The place is closed on Sundays, and rarely stays open past midnight - it's just not that sort of bar. Go across the street to Hody for late-night drinking. Any other time though, I promise you'll find the company much more enjoyable at Village Green."}
{"text":"I've been told they are known for their burgers, but their menu hosts a smattering of great bar foods. Chicken wings, chili, seafood gumbo, fish, chicken in many forms, salads, and even some kids menu options.  I decided to try their cheese curds (great!) and the friday fish fry.  The hush puppies were too dry.  I'd recommend staying away from those.  The fish was good, but the next visit will be their burger."}
{"text":"We were so excited to check put this restaurant tonight, but we were very disappointed! We wanted a good fish fry but the cod.and the fries were all overcooked and tough! The cod had a strange taste to it as well. Add to that a poor waitress who ran away from the table as soon as she could each time she approached us. We went because the reviews we read were all good. So I write this to warn people. We complained and were told that they were sorry and we should try it again sometime. Beware!"}
{"text":"I was there on Friday May 27th.  I started with the Clam Chowder Soup which was good then I had the Tater Tots and by God, they had cheese in the middle.  My sandwich I had the Turkey, it was ok.  My biggest problem is that the portions were for \"polite\" people.  I wanted a meatier meal.  My eldest had the Patty Melt, a good sandwich but again needed to be bigger."}
{"text":"After the hype about their burgers I was really looking forward to trying the food here. 

The meh: The hushpuppies were 1/2 way decent, but nothing extraordinary. Edible. No honey offered with them though.

The ugh: With the all of the acclaim their burgers get, you would think that they were doing something special here. They aren't. The burgers are frozen patties and look like they're right from Sysco. The reason that people are probably saying they're so good is because the patties aren't cooked within an inch of a briquette. Normally I would say that's a good thing, but when you're making me a burger from an unknown origin handled by who knows how many people....needless to say, medium rare frozen beef patty is doesn't = amazing burger in my book. 

I can't say that I would visit again. There are far too many amazing hamburgers on the west side made with real beef from local butchers to waste my time with this place.

UPDATE: I've spoken with a couple of people that are thinking it may be a fluke that I ended up with frozen patties the time I was there. Apparently they have a machine there that they make their patties with. I'm going to have to revisit in the near future to investigate."}
{"text":"A true Middleton bar food staple. Juicy burgers served on a piece of greasy wax paper have never tasted better. Definitely would recommend for some guilty pleasure food, a beer, and some sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  Craptastic.  The food isn't fresh. Sandwiches and burgers do not come with fries or anything.  Service was REALLY S-l-o-w and the place had like 3 other people so it wasn't like they were busy.   Atmosphere was awful.  Think your grandparents basement......."}
{"text":"Excellent Friday fish fry!  Their beer batter fish is crisp,tasty, and not at all greasy.  The hush puppies were equally good, but the fries could use some work. Our waiter had a great personality and not only provided good service, but interesting trivia such as the fact that our meal had been prepared by Steve Miller's son (of The Steve Miller Band fame).  
  Reasonable prices, nice-sized portions, good service, and really good food--we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love it
Though i got a lil too drunk and shit my self
I cant blame the staff
Met my ex wife there not the time i shit my self
I'm a really big fan of the vodka vodka vodka granted that's like not a special or anything
They were also pretty cool to let me know that they were also pretty cool to let me know that my fly was open"}
{"text":"The server said to eat a burger. I did. It was ugly, but sure tasty. The spicy (?) pup chips with it were perfect. Great hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Classic burger joint / dive bar that has been around forever and has not changed a bit since I started going there a long time ago.   Prices are great.   Service is excellent.  Burgers are definitely the thing to eat.   Tap list is great (especially for a divey bar in Wisco).  Definitely worth stopping by for a burger and brew if in area."}
{"text":"Classic flattop grilled burgers. The Big Daddy is quite a challenge to fit in your mouth, but well worth the effort (delicious!!!). My wife and daughter both had double cheeseburgers with bacon and wanted to come back the next day for more! Wait staff very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Ok. We loved this place. If I lived here it would be my go-to neighborhood bar and grill. Fortunately, we're only a couple hours away so we can make it a few times a year. Not fancy but that is just fine by us! I talked my husband into trying their signature burger the Big Daddy. I got him to order it because I said I'd help. Yikes! It is A big burger but it tasted great. One of the most flavorful burgers I've ever tried so being large wasn't just a gimmick. I recommend splitting it. I had the prime rib sandwich which was good, real prime in thin to med slabs, not lunch meat, seemed a little small sitting next to big daddy but was really just right for me portion wise. Tried the pub chips w blue cheese sauce. Other reviewers were correct that this is the best blue cheese ever. Period. Service was great and prices reasonable. We were at a table across from the grill at the bar which I recommend. Watched everything being cooked right in front of us on the flat top. Don't let the exterior fool you. It might look a little like a garage on the outside but it's what is on the inside that counts!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a super fancy place, keep looking...this is your typical neighborhood tavern and it made me feel like I was back home in the Milwaukee area.  The best burgers in Madison...hands down!  Good fries and cheese curds too...they had a number of other dishes that sounded yummy too.  Super friendly staff.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great local dive. Cheap beers and a few TVs for watching games. Large open hall for dining, but the best seat is at the main bar. With a built in open kitchen and flattop grill to smell the burgers cooking! They have some tasty daily specials too on the menu."}
{"text":"The Village Green is a Middleton staple- it's not to be missed! They have great burgers, and you absolutely must try the nachos. They use real tortillas and fry them- they are delicious! It is a bar, but they have a large restaurant side where you can just walk right in and slide into a booth. Parking can be tough to find, but it's typically a quick sprint around the corner."}
{"text":"Its Friday night...cold and snowing.   What  is there to do? Head to the Village Green.   Enjoy the Friday fish fry and yes, an ice cold beer.   So lets start with the service.   It was very good.   I walked in at 5:06pm, was immediatly greeted and placed my order within a few minutes.        By 5:10pm I had 3 pieces of hot cod, french fries, 2 hush puppies and coleslaw.   The meal was better then expected and exceeded expectations.   The Village Green is a traditional Wisconsin Tavern that has great service.   I am looking forward to next Friday already!   I forgot to mention that they have a decent selection of on tap beer.   I tried the Winter Skull, pretty smooth!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday night at 5:45. Plenty of open seats. No wait was a bonus. The server was prompt and friendly. Quickly brought drinks and appetizers. Cheese curds were very plain with thick heavy breading. Forgot the dipping sauce, but quickly realized her own mistake and brought it out. Known for burgers yet they were pre patties frozen burgers that had lost their beef flavor long before it came to the table. Only tasted the fat & grease. The toppings were fresh. The bun was good. The fries were average. I'd go back, but try something different."}
{"text":"Service was great, so my main complaint is the quality of the food. Should have known based on the bar focused set up. 

We got a bacon cheeseburger, chicken breast salad, beer battered fish sandwich, and cheese curds. Everything tasted like they were frozen to fryer. The burger was like it was from a grocery store; and the first one came severely undercooked. The only redeeming quality being the generous portion of bacon.

The salad was clumps of lettuce, onions, and dry chicken breast. Croutons were okay, but there was nothing special.

Finally the fish sandwich was very bland. It was kind of dry, and it was not good.

For the price, there was no side included on the sandwiches, like fries or anything. Oh and the $5.99 curds? Probably from a grocery store, and in the smallest quantity I've ever seen. You can find somewhere better if you're only going for food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger. Very good food with friendly 70s kinda atmosphere. Definitely will come back for roadkill special on Thursday."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. A completely unassuming, actually kinda creepy looking place on the outside, that was a complete surprise on the inside. I had heard about this place for several years but was skeptical-I mean look at the building, I would think. Lesson learned-do not judge a book by its cover. The interior is nothing special either but the place is somehow warm and comfy.

The service was outstanding, the beer selection pretty decent. 

We started with the chicken wings which were fried to perfection. I was disappointed that they were not covered in hot sauce. The wings were good but lacked some flavor for me.

My mom and I split the double cheeseburger with grilled onions. I'm not a fan of American cheese but we went for it since this is what this place is known for. It was delicious. Now this is not a huge patty with all kinds of great toppings so if that's what you're after, go elsewhere. But you will not be disappointed with this cheeseburger. It's two thinner patties (but somehow the thing still feels like a ton of food). The grilled onions were absolute perfection.

My sis had the patty melt which she absolutely raved about. We split the spicy pub chips as a side. The burgers and sandwiches don't come with a side but they have a wide variety of options to choose from to order separately. The spicy pub chips were flavored nicely but not spicy by any means. Nice yummy homemade potato chip type things. Highly recommend. It's served with one of the best blue cheese sauces I've ever had-huge chunks of blue cheese. 

Definitely check this place out when you're craving some unhealthy goodness!"}
{"text":"The Village Green is a place where you walk in and are like \"this is different\". Go on in and definitely get the cheese curds. Also known for their burgers and all are pretty good. Full bar, good food and the kids loved the sloppy joes!  Great place to get a beer and burger!"}
{"text":"Love the food 
Its a perfect place to chill 
Trust me You will Love everything thats on the menu 
Burgers Amazing 
Wings sooo good 
Sauce is really good 
Beers just right
Sweet potato fries are out of blunts ."}
{"text":"This place may not be much to look at but the food is good. We ordered the fish sandwich and the spicy pub chips. The fish sandwich tasted fresh and was cooked well. The pub chips were tasty and the blue cheese sauce that came with it was excellent. They have some good beer on tap to wash it down. I will come here again."}
{"text":"BURGER HEAVEN.  I finally found the perfect burger in Madison (Middleton).  This burger is made to order...perfectly cooked, perfect size, perfect fries.  The Village Green is a typical Wisconsin old school place....strange outdated decor....but it contributes to the charm.  Locals at the bar, friendly staff, and scent of all things fried in the air.  If you like your burger \"with\" then don't forget to ask because it does not come with the standard lettuce, tomato, onion (grilled- yes....or raw)....get it!"}
{"text":"Went there to eat for lunch. I got a salad with a reuben sandwich and my fiancee got the sloppy Joe sandwich and some seafood gumbo. The food was really good and our waitress was really nice and friendly. I would definitely go back to eat here again."}
{"text":"As others have already stated, I am rating this for what it is...a bar and grill, not a fancy 5-Diamond restaurant.

I chose the bacon cheese burger with grilled onions and some french fries; absolutely delicious!  The burger is juicy and tasty...I add some ketchup and mustard for good measure!  I sat in the bar area and had no problem getting service.  The bartender is quick and attentive; the place was packed and one bartender had the bar crowd and the sitting area crowd.  I also ordered a Capital Winter on tap and it was poured perfectly!

I have been in the area for three years and I consistently return to the Village Green as the best burger in the area.  I like the simplicity of the burger and bun.  The meat is delicious and the bacon adds that extra umph!!!!  Also they have nightly specials and I try to target Tuesday (Sloppy Joes) and Thursday (Road Kill Burrito)...both are great!

Quick, consistent service, very tasty food and a friendly atmosphere; you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Grant burgers, cool dive bar atmosphere. Good fried items and fish fry. Nice beer selection at a reasonable price. Patrons are friendly, the right kind of crowd. Sit at the bar and have a good time."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and it's a place you can always count on. The fish fry is ok/good but the cheeseburgers is what this place is about! I tend to tell them no pink sometimes they are a bit underdone for my preference. I personally wouldn't order the fish fry again the fish reminded me more of fish sticks rather than light flaky beer battered fish. The coleslaw was really good tarter sauce great and French fries are legit. The bar is usually full but I can always find a table. The staff is consistently friendly and attentive I've never had bad service here and that means a lot to me! If you want a great old fashioned cheeseburger with great service check this place out! The spudsters and battered mushrooms are worth a try too I love them! My mom always plays the old school pin ball in the back"}
{"text":"Sloppy Joe was pretty bland. I had the spicy chili, good flavor. Fries were good. Def will go back and try burgers there."}
{"text":"This place is a must every time I visit Middleton to see family.  Great no frills, classic Wisconsin bar atmosphere with plenty of wood paneling and no nonsense food.  The burgers are fantastic, some good beers on tap.  Time and again, I leave happy and full."}
{"text":"The Big Daddy Burger is simply the best burger around. Period. Very laid back, casual place. With other places competing with each other who is \"cooler\"...Village Green just is without trying. An American and Wisconsin classic. Hope this place sticks around forever."}
{"text":"We came here on the recommendation of a friend that it was one of the best pub burgers, and he was correct! Simple but delicious with just the right amount of grease and a LOT of flavor. The burgers were very small though, so make sure to get an appetizer or side. Decent tap selection, but the decor left a bit to be desired."}
{"text":"Fantastic! A trip back in time....$5.00 cheeseburgers, speedy & friendly service, ( and I never say that ! ) 
We had the homemade potato chips & fried green beans that were very addicting.....the burgers were served on waxed paper which was nostalgic, but so tasty! Wisconsin beer on tap that doesn't cost  $8.00 a pint.....way to go Village Green! Located in downtown Middleton, I'd return the next time I'm in town. Great food, better prices & the ambience? I wouldn't change a thing!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the food is awesome, the decor is cool vintage and I've been coming here for 35 years. Great selection of tap beers as well. I can't believe I only have 8 check-in's...I suppose I shouldn't make it egregious because I could probably have 10 more. I had a cheeseburger with American and grilled onions the other day. I had been getting the fish sandwich and I forgot how good this place is. Crispy and crunch outside crust and a perfect medium in the middle. I'd go here everyday but I don't think my cardiologist will let me."}
{"text":"Here's what you need to know:
1) The burgers are amazing
2) Nothing else.

Put your computer up to your ear and listen to this:

Mrfmmmfrrrmffmygffffgfgfjingawddd

That's the sound of me making love to these burgers.

I wouldn't care if they stopped serving everything else on the menu, beer included, I would still give this place five stars. If you don't agree with me, you are wrong and you should feel like a bad person.

One time, I came here with my cousin who has a lazy eye. Eating a burger CURED HIS LAZY EYE. One time, I found a $100 dollar bill on the chair, and when I tried to return it, the waitress GAVE ME ANOTHER $100 DOLLAR BILL. One time, I came in wearing my lucky black socks, and when I came out THEY TURNED WHITE. You can use the burger grease here as currency in most Pacific Island countries. They have TVs that show only your favorite shows from when you were a kid. The beer here doesn't give you a hangover, it only gives you awesome dreams where you are flying over the graves of everyone who made fun of you in high school.

So yeah, A+"}
{"text":"The Village Green restaurant was great. I was having a tough time figuring out what to order and could not decide. Then, my good buddy George recommended the Prime Rib Sandwich and I could not be more impressed by the choice. I was in love at first sight when I saw this sexy sandwich. I wanted to scream at the top of lungs and express my love for this prime rib. Waitress was great and pin ball machine kept the kids in check. 

P.S. The cheese curds gave me a semi."}
{"text":"Love the fish fry. Love the people there. The owner was giving out candy for Halloween and gave my kids extra. We liked him so much we ate there for the first time. The only thing is, the place could use a little updating. However, despite the outdated appearance, it had a certain charm. The owner struck me as a stellar guy. An old timer that is part of why Middleton is the fine place it is today. You can tell he loves his employees like they are his own kids. Fish, fries, burgers and such."}
{"text":"The Village Green is a Classic Small Town Tavern... That's that. The Double Cheeseburger came on a soft white bun. The patties were well seasoned - something many burger joints can't seem to figure out. My burger came with American cheese. Although I could have specified Swiss or Pepper Jack - but I'm glad I didn't. The Village Green burgers sort of yearn for American Cheese. I ordered my burger medium-rare and Bazinga... It actually came medium-rare. If you follow my reviews, you understand that I'm a stickler for properly cooked burgers. Few burger joints get this right - So when they do, it's worth noting. 

Companion had a Bacon Cheeseburger. She claimed it was tasty... Given companion isn't really a bacon cheeseburger sort of gal, this was high praise. Although she did enjoy it with the Classic Wisconsin cocktail, an Old Fashioned. Said cocktail may have improved  her review."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Middleton, so we've been exploring the restaurants in the area. We've only been here once, but I can certainly say I will be back for more! 

We came here on a Friday night, around 6pm and picked our own seats. On Fridays, their special of the night is their fish fry, which me and my boyfriend both got. We also ordered a half pound of wings and some mini corn dogs to start off with. 

Corn dogs and wings came quickly, and were piping hot. Maybe I'm just very partial to corn dogs, but these were delicious! The wings were also well flavored, and just spicy enough to enjoy. Next time I'm getting a full pound. For myself. 

The Fish Fry was delicious, crispy fried cod, and a huge side of fries. I am not the biggest fan of Cod, because I think too often it is not cooked well, but this place hits the nail on the head! The cod was flaky, and tender. Not dry at all. The three pieces were a little smaller than I expected, but they were extremely filling and I was struggling to finish my last piece. But I finished it like a champ. 

Overall, good service and great food. Good for families and larger groups too, as it is more of a casual dining spot, with kid-friendly foods and plenty of adult drinks on the board."}
{"text":"Love the village greens food. If you want an amazing burger cooked to your liking, come here. Service is ok, atmosphere is old school which is fun. Prices are kind of high considering sometimes you don't even get a plate  overall though yummy place, nothing too terrible to say."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger after a couple cocktails, so off we went to Village Green.  I ordered the double cheeseburger (may have been the gin talking) and convinced my husband to order the patty melt so I could try that as well.  We split an order of fries, which was the perfect size for two people.  I definitely would have been fine with the single because this burger was huge.  Nevertheless, it was delicious.  My only complaint is the bun - the plain white bun was no match for those two meaty patties and it just fell apart immediately.  Oh, and they don't have cheddar cheese.  His patty melt was equally delicious and a bit more flavorful than my burger.

Local WI atmosphere, fast service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Simple local spot with great food and even better service. The wait staff was not only extremely attentive, they were also quite easy on the eyes! Food was really fast and really good. I'm not from the area, but I'll definitely repeat next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with locals.   Great burgers .  My favorite though is the Road kill burrito  served every Thursday!!!   People are friendly and the owners like having fun."}
{"text":"This is more for visitors such as myself because the locals already know where to get the good burgers. Funny thing, one of the patrons in one of the other local bars we visited later that evening tried really hard to explain why the Village Green is such a great place. 

He is convinced that Wisconsin is the only place anywhere where bar & grills are allowed to have their grills close to the bar in open sight of patrons. And of all the visible grills in Wisconsin, Village Green's is the closest and thus the best.

Well, I tried to let him know that I have been to dozens of places like this in the country, but he wasn't having any of that. But it is true that the grill master is right there for you frying juicy burgers with the freshest toppings. Grilled or raw onion, local cheese, Farmers Market vegetables.  Also, they'll put bacon and egg on your choice but they'd prefer to put on some fried summer sausage as well. 

Not the biggest burgers I've had but perfectly flavorful and juicy, it was plenty. Also have spicy chips with their homemade blue cheese dressing. Or have two orders of chips like I did."}
{"text":"We came into town on a Friday and when you do that in Wisconsin you have to try the fish fry. The Village Green is supposedly noted for theirs so we decided why not. My wife and I both ordered the same normally a mistake in itself as we like to try the others dish. We after our wait we received the food and were not overly enthused. It was not what we expected and instead of the proverbial \"writer home about it\" when you are blow away we have to just say so so. The wait person never even asked how our meal was. Another no no"}
{"text":"First and foremost, their burgers are INCREDIBLE and that is reason enough to go check it out! 

I would actually give this place a 3.5 if that were possible. I docked it because it has a limited menu with mostly fried food, not many healthy dining options, but then again I'm not sure why anyone would go there for anything other than a burger. It is also definitely a dive, the bathrooms are a little scary, but the burger ranks right up there with the best in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Quaint little townie spot downtown Middleton.  Nice divey spot for a beer.  Inside smells like old people and moth balls, but they have outdoor seating.  The menu is very bar foodish, but they make it very well.  The chili wasn't the best, but it was good, and the fish sandwich was quite good.  That's right, I had chili and a fish sandwich, a strange combo."}
{"text":"This place is a simple, solid sandwhich joint. Its clean, old faahioned and has good wifi.
The service is quick and friendly. Food ia good, not extrordinary but the whole package will make this place someqhere i hang out with friends late into the night.
Glad to find it in Middleton."}
{"text":"You know how everyone has a few places that if they're feeling down, it's sure to cheer them up? The Village Green is one of mine. They make my platonic ideal of a bar burger. No chef-y custom grinds of pasture raised beef on perfectly shiny brioche buns topped with local arugula and hand-whipped basil thyme aioli here. Just a basic burger with a nice fluffy bun (wherever they buy them from), a good sized quality patty, cooked right and assembled with care and attention. 

I've been coming here for years and was shocked when they started bringing your burger in a plastic basket instead of the piece of wax paper they used to. I was worried they might be getting a bit fancy but nope, the plastic baskets haven't ruined the burgers."}
{"text":"Good prices and a nice selection.  My bbq pork sandwich was spot on.  I mean, it wasn't \"Memphis bbq\", but it hit the spot for a lunch out with the guys.  One lunch buddy got the reuben which looked excellent.  The fries were fresh and tasty.

The decor is throwback 70's - wood paneling and banquet table type seating, but that's why you come here.  The prices are very reasonable for what you get - you can snag a sandwich and fries for under $10 and leave satisfied.  Service was quick and friendly.  

Sure, there's better ambiance at other places.  And yeah, there's better food at other places.  But Village Green has a unique charm that will invite you back time and time again."}
{"text":"this place is not bad, in fact i rather liked it. 
the prices are good and the food is decent. i rather go here than a big chain where i would pay more for similar food. 

There's a bar area and a section with tables. Definitely a mixed crowd-young singles, EMTs on a break, middle aged singles, older couples, and families. kinda cool. 

the Village Green offers new glarus and cap brewery on tap, as well as other stuff i cant remember. We were there on a Saturday night and my husband got the special, double cheeseburger with fries for $6.95. I just got the regular burger, and it was about $3.50. the burgers looked like the frozen variety, but they were kinda tasty, really.  

schlitz in a can $2 all the time, big screen tv

for me a downside was that the place was a little smoky, i guess there isn't a smoking ban in this city yet, however, it is possible to sit outside. 

the server was pleasant and efficient.

cash only"}
{"text":"My friend was really wanting a bar burger.  I suggested we head into Middleton.  She also wanted outdoor seating.  I said, let's drive by Village Green to see if they have tables set out.  They did and we stopped.  We both got a burger.  Mine was a cheeseburger with raw onions.  Hers was a bacon cheeseburger with fried onions.  We split an order of onion rings (not a date night for either of us).   My burger was cooked beautifully.   We both felt like we made a good choice.
 Our server checked with us several times.  Only negative is that you have to head to the bar to pay the tab and not the server.  My friend has mobility issues and would not have been able to get up the stairs on the side of the building we were on.  But I handled both our payments."}
{"text":"This place is laid back, friendly and consistent. The food is great. In fact, I have yet to find a cheeseburger that can rival theirs, it's the burger for which I hold the standard for all others. Don't forget to get a Bloody Mary while you're here...it's similar to Canada's caesars, light, salty and delicious!"}
{"text":"A little weird that my burger at the bar was served plateless, basically on a placemat. The Pepper Jack cheezeburger was really good. Ditto for the \"spicy pub chips\". The prime rib sammich was a bit small but very good. Wife liked it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a \"locals\" place with cheap drinks, delicious food that's bad for you, and no frills, but family friendly atmosphere, this is the place. Kind of like having a drink and chatting with neighbors in your uncle's basement. Clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Go soft and juicy burgers!  I dream and crave these burgers.  Basic cheese burger with pickles and they special mustard."}
{"text":"First, the positive: Really Great tasting burger. Laid back atmosphere that is not pretentious. Only negative is that it was pricier than I'd expect. $12 and some change for a burger and fries with water."}
{"text":"\"The Green\" has the best burgers in the Madison area.  It's simple bar food, but done perfectly.  They know what they are doing here and they are doing it good.  The Nachos are pretty awesome too.  They deep fry tortillas for the chips.  If you can, get a spot at the bar.  It's good times.  

I don't eat fish, but some of my friends and my girlfriend do, and they like the fish fry on Fridays.  I'll stick to my cheeseburger."}
{"text":"As many yelpers have said perfectly...the Village Green is the idealistic neighborhood tap.  I hadn't been in over 10 years, and walking back in the place looked exactly the same.  Some would call it a bad thing, but I find it endearing.  We've been back a few times now and love going with friends for a casual Friday night.  Great specials (love the Friday fish...but be prepared to eat only fried food).  My all-time favorite is their summer sausage reuben...if you love reubens you cannot go wrong with this jewel!  Fries are always hot and fresh and service is always friendly.  One of Middleton's best kept local secrets!"}
