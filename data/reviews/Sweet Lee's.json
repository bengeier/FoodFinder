{"text":"I used the shop's catering services to put together a sit down dinner for 8 during the Holidays. Lee and Greg were wonderful in putting together a terrific menu within my budget. They delivered on time (to Laval, no less), and the food was excellent. The desserts in particular were amazing. I was extremely impressed, and would order from them again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"It's almost worth stepping inside just to have a look around the place. The metal-tiled ceiling, the lamps in glass jars, the wooden benches and panels, it's enough make this spot stand out from all the other cafes and bakeries on Wellington - and there's lots of them.   Then, of course, there's the selection of baked goods behind the counter. Always so much to choose from, I couldn't possibly try everything on offer, it all looks delicious. And yet, most of what I've had so far isn't actually all that great. The maple cinnamon roll seemed too dry, and I couldn't pick up any of the maple. The chocolate croissant was all gross and soggy on the inside...  Now I mostly come here for their bread, which is excellent, but the whole place seems a bit expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"Pâtisserie,  viennoiserie et baguettes délicieuse. J'aime beaucoup quand je passe devant acheter leur petit gâteau moelleux au chocolat et aux différentes saveurs."}
{"text":"They had so many great looking pastries and products that there is no way to try them all without multiple visits.  They had lots of common as well as exotic cookies. I think it's one of their strong points. I tried both their Chai cookies and espresso Cookies and they were exceptional, chewy and fresh. Hell..I'm not even a fan of cookies.  Their version of smoked meat sandwich was good. Not amazing..but good. The pasta Salad was good -not the basic stuff sold in many places-. I'm sure their other salads are just as good.  Their Croissant stuffed with Raspberries was heavy and felt a bet doughy and soggy -not soggy bad-. I'm just used to Croissants being lighter and crispier. However, as many Yelpers pointed out, it's a big hit with many people.  The reason there is a different line for the coffee, is because it's actually a different business setup in the same shop -St.Henri's cafe-. St.Henri's Lattes are good and the roast their own coffee so it's fresh. You get a discount off your latte if you buy a bag of beans.  Seating is nice inside and the place is well lit. Service was very friendly.  The combination of these two places under the same roof that are artists at their craft is just wonderful. I wish more businesses did this.   Overall, it's a great place if you want to have a tasty breakfast or lunch followed by a great latte. Mostly food oriented places tend to have average or below average coffee or milk based coffee drinks. Having St.Henri's means you're in good hands.  Parking is mostly paid street parking."}
{"text":"Had the cranberry cookie, and hazelnut/graham cracker mini cheesecake tart and both were amazing! Special shout out to the extremely helpful and friendly staff who waited on us -- I've become accustomed to slightly irritated staff at other bakeries (ahem au pain dore) so it always feels like such a luxury to be treated with patience and kindness. Thank you Sweet Lee's, we will be back and often!"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful little discovery that really hit the spot.  The pastries and the savouries from sweet Lee's were delicious and the cappuccinos were so good we had to have a second one. It was nice not having to ask for a double shot in order to get A tasty coffee. We sat on the terrace this time but inside looks quaint and cosy also"}
{"text":"trop sucres, service désagréable, trop cher"}
{"text":"OMG les croissants sont divins, moi qui allais à Première Moisson, plus besoin. Mais laissez vous tenter par un café du Bistrot St-Henri. J'ai trouvé le concept très intéressant, deux entités compatibles sous un même toit."}
{"text":"I've so glad to hear of this accessible location. I used to go to the bakery when it was in St. Henri - that's true love as it was really out of the way. I had to take STM and walk to get there. So aside from the open air markets & bazaars I'd rarely partake of these treats.  I will now make it a point to indulge myself more often."}
{"text":"It was one of those days when I found myself sitting at home wondering where on earth I could get something sweet in Ville Emard when Yelp offered me this quaint little bakery a 5 minute drive away. I drove over and was pleased to find such a cute and rustic bakery in Verdun with lots of options! I was greeted by a super friendly lady who took her time explaining everything to me (there were so many things to choose from!)  Eventually, I grabbed some cookies and a couple slices of cake/brownies/whatever else my eyes which are bigger than my stomach wanted and came home to excitedly share my findings with my husband. Although everything looked super delicious, we found that some items were either way too sweet or that certain items were extremely decadent (ie. a couple bites and you're done). Overall, variety and service was awesome, but I found myself wishing that there was a Premiere Moisson nearby or something of the sort with items that are guaranteed to be delicious.   Would I go back? Maybe..but not for anything too decadent...Maybe a croissant or something along those lines would be better here! (FYI, we also tried the croissants and were pleased with them).  Overall, A-OK! :)"}
{"text":"Awesome place for great sandwiches & delicious desserts. Well priced & nice ambiance too. There also happens to be tables & chairs right outside their shop."}
{"text":"Loved the Sweet Lee's/St. Henri Coffee coffee shop! The coffee (I ordered a flat white) and the treats from Sweet Lee's (broccoli Quiche) were the perfect snowy day lunch. Lunch time (12-2) is quite crowded! I was able grab a seat in front of the window and enjoy my treats and a book while people watching. Very low-key- great location to get work done! Free and reliable Wi-Fi and utility plugs to charge up and it's across the street from the De l'Eglise station on the green line."}
{"text":"Super bon muffin ( j'ai pris pomme et érable) et super bon biscuit ( chocolat noir et amande)! Les desserts et les cafés doivent etre payés séparément,  mais tous est excellent :) mon latte (avec design de feuille en plus) était excellent et le thé ( et sa présentation) était excellent aussi :) j'y retourne c'est certain!!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed. Great coffee, nice baked goods.  Handy place when you only need a snack, and you don't want to buy a baked good that's overly too greasy."}
{"text":"Location: In the heart of Lasalle.   Space: I LOVE it! It's very rustic, with wooden benches, red walls, and a funky metal-tiled ceiling with of course, shiny new displays. The food stuff is immediately to your left, while the coffee/beverage station is to your right. It can be a little confusing when you want to order though - there wasn't really an order to the line, and I wasn't sure if it started at the cash or immediately at the end of the counter (i.e. when you walk through the door). It also wasn't clear to me if you have to order your drink separately from your food, or order at the same time, pay at the food cash then move over to the coffee station.   Food: First of all, everything looked bloody amazing. They had huge cookies, brownies, pizza, bread etc. Since we were taking our order to go (no room to sit), I just ordered a dark chocolate +espresso + cinnamon cookie that was to die for. It was so incredibly fresh that the big chocolate chips were melting in the bag. That worked out well because the chocolate froze as I walked outside so I was able to pick it off the bag and eat it. What? Don't give me that look!   Service: Good. I really wasn't in there that long to elaborate so I guess I'll just have to go back. There's a brownie with my name on it =-)  Verdict: Go! But be warned, I think the hipsters have already taken ownership of the place."}
{"text":"Joli petit endroit où l'intérieur est partagé avec le Café St-Henri, qui s'occupe des breuvages. Sweet Lee's offre des petites pizzas, des soupes, des sandwiches, de la boulangerie, entre autres.  Pour ma part la salade de pâtes aux épices indiennes était succulente, le potage à la courge et le sandwich jambon-brie très bons. Les prix sont vraiment raisonnables et le service est chaleureux. Joli spot tranquille, mais populaire, dans Verdun."}
{"text":"Best cookies in Verdun! Not hard to beat as Verdun has no really good sweet shops. Still friendly staff and delicious cookies."}
{"text":"Upon the barista's recommendation, I tried the cookie with cranberries and white chocolate chunks. But everything looked super yummy, and I was teased by the big brownies, tarts and muffins. The cookie was $2.30 including tax. I still can't decide if that's pricey...  Let me tell you that my 3-star rating is mainly based on the quality of my cookie experience! I didn't order anything else. The cookie was soft, and there was a nice balance between the tart cranberries the sweet white chocolate. For some reason I was expecting more- something sweeter, even. Maybe even a warm cookie! It was underwhelming.  The cafe itself is lovely. So are the staff; very friendly and conversational. There are glass jars with lights in them dangling from the ceiling. The walls are a warm red, and if you look up, the ceiling is embellished in silver. Students type away at their macs, and middle-aged Montrealers peacefully sip away at their lattes. The park benches are a nice seating idea.  BIG TIP: When you enter, look to your left; they have discounted goodies there!"}
{"text":"Calling all cookie lovers and addicts! If you love cookies, THIS is the place for you. Their cookie flavors are beyond amazing and unique. I've already had several kinds, but they are never disappointing. I think it's about 2.50 for one cookie and they also sell salty scones, pasta salads, sandwiches, and quiche. I'm not too crazy about the other stuff they offer, but the cookies? YES! It's attached to a cafe so if you, like me, like to combine coffee with cookies, it's a beautiful advantage. Grab your coffee from across, grab your cookie and then enjoyy. Oh and they have pastries like croissants too I believe. Nice place to quickly grab mini breakfast or snack. It's right by de l'eglise metro!"}
{"text":"J'adore le Sweet Lee's et il est proche de chez moi, un gros plus! Les brioches à l'érable sont délicieuses, et les pains sont aussi très bon. Je n'ai pas eu la chance d'essayer les muffins parce que je prends toujours les brioches ;) Ils sont annexés au café St-Henri, il faut donc commander et payer aux 2 endroits si on veut un café et une brioche, un peu bizarre lorsqu'on est pas habitué. Le seul point négatif, qui n'est pas de leur faute donc on leur pardonne, c'est que les grandes tables sont souvent utilisés par des gens seuls, alors lorsqu'on arrive avec 2 enfants à l'heure de pointe, on doit souvent prendre pour emporter au lieu de manger sur place.  ZeroWaste tips : ils vous mettent le pain dans votre propre sac avec un sourire lorsque vous le demandez."}
{"text":"Delish treats, super delish coffee, what more can you ask for? Verdun is really going places.  So the deal is that this is a shared space with sweet Lee's and a coffee joint. I'm not a huge fan of the whole pour over thing, but if you are, look no further.  Great atmosphere, clean and bright."}
{"text":"Sweet Lee's, c'est PLEIN DE BON MANGER. Boulangerie surprenante, je dirais. Non mais pour vrai, un croissant chocolat noir et noisettes pour déjeuner, c'est si cochon, mais si bon. Imagine le croissant chocolat noir, noisettes et gâteau au fromage... J'ai même pas osé essayer.  Y a des tartelettes et des gâteaux et des tartes super intenses, des merveilles pour les yeux que j'ai hâte de mettre dans ma bouche pis toute.  Y a évidemment des pains de toutes sortes. Pis des coupes de fruits. Pis on peut acheter de la sauce a spaghetti.   Mais vraiment, l'idéal pour moi, c'est de s'y installer le matin, choisir son croissant du jour et l'accompagner d'un bon café du Saint-Henri, avec qui Sweet Lee's partage le local. Une union gagnante. JE SUIS CHARMÉE!"}
{"text":"The baked goods are delicious but way overpriced for what it is. The bakery is badly devided to the point that when you order, people rudely cut you off although you've been there for a good five minutes waiting to be told \"ahh well\" by the staff there no appologies nothing. They are also closed on Mondays and when inquired about that i also got a rude and beligerent answer \"well the bakers need a day off don't you think?\". I think this bakery has the most arogant self righteous workers. The products are delicious indeed but the staff needs to act more professionally. I firmly recommend redesigning the bakery so drinks and good are served at the same counter and that a queue line with a \"start\" sign be put in place to make sure the rude and ubeducated people wait their turn."}
{"text":"A cute and wonderful bakery with great service! I love the atmosphere and of course, their delectable pastries! The store is shared with a coffee shop and the weird thing is that you need to pay separately for your coffee and pastry! Otherwise amazing stuff to be had there! A must go in Verdun!"}
{"text":"This pastry shop located side by side with Cafe St Henri on the Well in Verdun is surely a great place to grab some delicious baked goods. This place is always buzzing and seeing that they share the space with the cafe, you can grab a coffee at the same time but truth be told I've never been able to actually grab a seat here; the space is small and busy so seating is limited. However, I will always stop in for one of their croissants! I've raved over their croissants to everyone! What makes them so good is that their croissants are not only stuffed but also topped with all kinds of goodies; I've had them all and I'm happy when a new seasonal flavour (like maple) pops up. As an avid coffee lover, they have an espresso chocolate croissant that is sinfully good too. Perfect flaky pastry, healthy filling and toppings always add texture and great flavour; definitely stop in if you're in the hood."}
{"text":"Ohé, ohé! Sweet Lee a maintenant un nouveau local rue Wellington! Très bien située, sur une artère commerciale et près du métro, cette petite boulangerie--pâtisserie vous surprendra avec leur bonnes gourmandises! De plus, elle partage son espace avec un petit café. J'ai essayé le thé du Labrador, très réconfortant en ce jeudi matin glacial!"}
{"text":"Les patisseries de Sweet Lee's sont absolument à tomber par terre . Autant visuellement qu'en bouche, elles sont réellement impressionnantes. Dommage que la salle à manger ne soit pas plus confortable, mais la terrasse à l'avant les pardonne durant l'été. Petit plus : le Café offre des boissons avec du lait d'amandes, génial ! :) seul hic (et c'est un majeur) : les employés du côté café sont probablement les baristas les plus bêtes que j'ai jamais vus. Après au moins 10 visites, je n'ai pas pu apercevoir un sourire. Dommage !"}
{"text":"Sweet Lee's is indeed sweet in its own way. There are two stands in this coffee / bakery shop, the Saint Henri one and then the stand of the sugary treats. As a result you line up twice, once for coffee and then to get your snack, so I had the feeling I'm in some tiny supermarket and things seemed a little be chaotic. Otherwise everybody working behind the stands is super nice and attentive. The space behind the stands is not very big and extremely well utilized, the small tables are really next to each other. The Sweet Lee's production looks more like home cooked and it has some interesting, and attractive pastries. I chose the molasses cookie with cherries and ginger, yummy, but too sweet for my taste. The Saint Henri cappuccino paired well with my cookie. Would I come back, most probably not, as this is not my primary choice for coffee on Wellington street and also because coffee for me is a sacred time to relax, I found this place a little bit too noisy."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this shop for two years now and still pretty much into it: that's how good they are.  Ambience is really good, when you get inside the shop, it is divided into two: right side for coffee(st henri), the other for pastries and sandwiches.  St. Henri tastes really like...well, coffee! I always get an extra hot Mocha whenever it's cold and an Iced Latte during the summer. Staff are wonderful, very accommodating and friendly..make one hell of a coffee, too! Sweet Lee's offer a good chunk variety of cookies and sweets, my favorite is the cowboy and mint chocolate cookies as well as the triple chocolate cake. They also sell bread and sandwiches, great place for casse-croute: try the one with smoked salmon, I kid you not, it's delicious!!!   This place is my go to place because it's rustic style gets to me, I find it really homey. I could sit there for hours and read a novel or journal. You may also sit on their terrasse out front during summer and catch up with friends. Which reminds me, a friend tells me it's a bit pricey for her here but I feel like you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Can you imagine a place where everything is absolutely delicious, the staff is very kind and the ambiance is nice? This is it! I've tried the scones salés, the breads, the croque monseigneur, the quiches, the soup, the muffins, fondants, cookies... I'm never disappointed! Verdun needed and deserved a place like this!"}
{"text":"On my way back home after running errands in Verdun I found a new gem on Wellington Street; Sweet Lee's, a bakery and coffee shop with seating area, had just relocated from St-Henri to Verdun. I stopped in my tracks, admired the baked goods in the window and I could not resist; I had to investigate this new place! A café mocha and an amandine (almond croissant) later, I found myself very pleased by the quality of the food and the beverage; the croissant was tastier and chewier than I had expected. The decor was also very charming; red walls, wooden panels, doors and fixtures, light bulbs encased in jars suspended from the ceiling and booths made out of varnished park benches. And oh boy, finally a decent coffee shop at proximity, right on the corner of De L'Église Street! My dream came true!  Sweet Lee's has all to please; good food, good coffee, good location and welcoming atmosphere. I recommend and I will be back, more often than my wallet recommends, I think!"}
{"text":"What a cute little spot in Verdun!  When we got there, it was nice and quite and plenty of tables. But by the time we were ready to go, the place was packed!  They share the space with a coffee/tea shop.  It was a little inconvenient to be in two separate lines but I understand. Quite clever of them to set up shop like that and share the rent.  The pastry case was full of amazing ladies o king treats. It was difficult to decide but I chose the almond croissant and a blueberry muffin. The croissant was pretty good but the muffin didn't taste right. Some of the reviews mentioned that some baked goods were not too sweet but I felt like my blueberry muffin was actually kinda salty.  There are so many things that looked really good so I won't hold that against them. Will definitely come back to try other items."}
{"text":"Great selection! Croissants are good, and so are their muffins. Convenient there's a place selling coffeee (st.henri) right next to it. Wifi and a nice place to sit down and work or have your breakfast!"}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé cette boulangerie/café.J'ai moin aimer l'emplacement des 2 comptoir.Le décor est très agréable avec les banc de auditorium(aréna mityque à verdun.Café et pâtisserie délicieuse7.5/10"}
{"text":"We came here looking for dessert and got ourselves a chocolate  fondant. The sweet thing about Sweet Lee's is that they have different kinds! I got the marzipan one, while my friends got the raspberry and another kind I don't remember.  All of us enjoyed our respective choices, which was great. I don't drink coffee so I can't write about that but I can tell they're quite serious about that here because they have a massive, separate ordering counter for coffees with the most beautiful retro looking coffee machine.  What I really like about the place, beside the fondant, are the decor and ambiance. It's nice and airy, and while brightly lit so you could chill out there with a book , you don't get that unpleasant cafeteria feel. I would go back next time I'm in Verdun."}
{"text":"Finally! A proper bakery and sweet shop in Verdun! I stepped into Sweet Lee's a few days ago for the first time and was immediately impressed with the vibe and offerings. With soft cookies, quiches, crumbly pies, sandwiches and salads, along with an amazing coffee/health bar on the other side, Verdun has scored another amazing spot to satisfy your sweet tooth. Literally sitting across the street from the majestic church on Wellington Avenue, Sweet Lee's is steps away from metro De L'Eglise as well.  You cannot go wrong coming in here on a cold winter's day to indulge in a cookie and some tea while stealing an hour for yourself to read a book or catch up on your email. Love it!"}
{"text":"Sweet Lee's / Café St. Henri is heaven.  Not a slice of heaven...heaven in the shape of a big, tender croissant piled high with cranberries and blueberries, and an expertly-poured latte in a sweet turquoise mug.  Seems like last year you could find Sweet Lee's pastries across town, but the tides of pastry distribution seem to have changed, and now I need to haul myself to Verdun to get my fix.  And I do.  I really cannot imagine a better combination. Amazing coffee. Amazing pastries. Lovely, warm, quirky décor. (The bathrooms have special lights on the outside, so you can easily see from your seat if they're occupied or not! No waiting awkwardly and deciding whether you ought to knock!) Friendly staff. Prices are a bit spendy, but you're paying for the best quality you can find in the city. Really, I can't find a fault even if I try. Love, love, love."}
{"text":"Trendy place with deserts, coffee, and some interesting lunch options. I picked up  2 pies, which were fine but on the pricy side. I would go back to have a light lunch and just chill with a friend."}
