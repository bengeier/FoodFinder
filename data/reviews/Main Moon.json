{"text":"WARNING: If you order from the Chinese Restaurant in Stow called, 'Main Moon', make sure to bring your metal detector. There was piece of metal in my food. The food was return with the piece of metal and the lady at the counter apologize and said that they would make another one. YEAH - Right!!! When we refused her offer, but accepted her apology and asked to be refunded - that's when she started negotiating. You ask, 'What does that mean?' Her comment, \"You and your family already ate some of the food and we will not be giving you a refund for what you ate or even partly what was eaten. I'll give you your money back for the pork fried rice and the pint size shrimp Lo mein that wan't touched.\" This is the second time that there was something dangerous in their food. The first time it was a huge fish bone that pierced the roof of my mouth. I couldn't close my mouth until it was removed. Then to add insult to injury: She hands us back $8.20 - That's right, my life is worth a mere $8.20 in her eyes. Other customers were there when we returned the food. Hopefully, they went home and checked everything out before eating. I will be posting this FOOD WARNING on facebook and calling the health department on Monday and sending them these photos. I really like Asian food, but will not be making any more purchases at this restaurant (if you can call it that). There's other places to eat that may be a little more expensive, but worth it in quality and safety. Another store, in Stow, that doesn't know anything about great customer service.

What is great customer service and how should it have been applied in this situation? Answer: Oh my, please except our deepest apologizes. We will be glad to remake the meal, if you would like, or give you a full refund. We hope that we can earn your trust back, because we don't want to lose you as a customer.

Does that cover it! I do have pictures :("}
{"text":"Good little joint. My first rule is \"if they speak broken english, the food will be good\", that's the case here. I've been going there since they opened, and never had bad service or food. I have seen rude Americans that didn't have the patience or politeness to deal with somebody that speaks broken english, and seen them throw a fit. Try it, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food madison! I've tried them all and make the 15 minute drive every week :-)"}
{"text":"Best hot n Sour soup and hunan chicken in Stow for sure."}
{"text":"The food is barely acceptable, the service is not! We have a fairly low threshold for Chinese food in the Madison-area and Main Moon does not rise to the occasion.  I was literally yelled at when I asked to have tomatoes added to my pepper beef. Seriously, I felt like  I had encountered the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld:   \"No tomatoes for you.\"  You can find the same quality elsewhere for a lot less attitude."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food near Kent. Orange chicken is my favorite!! Must order!!"}
{"text":"Great place! I know their decor is off-putting, but I feel like this is an undiscovered gem. Staff is friendly and if you ever eat there and not get just take-out, they seem to go over-the-top with portion sizes and are very happy that you are sitting in there eating. I always get steamed tofu or beef with the garlic sauce. All the veggies are perfectly steamed and the sauce is just the right type of spicy. Did I saw tofu? Yup! I actually eat tofu from them and it's great!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times always dine in. Food is better than average, a very good value, and never crowded. I will continue to be a customer."}
{"text":"Good enough for carry-out in McFarland on a cold winter's evening.  Ready on time, never had a wrong order, and they're at least reasonably friendly.  Would be better if they delivered, but not sure there's a huge demand for it in our tiny burg.  They also have a lunch buffet on weekdays for around $6."}
{"text":"We went in for the lunch buffet, and this restaurant really missed the mark. The food was bland, cold, and the trays were not refilled in a timely manner. We didn't see anyone wiping down tables, either, and there are boxes of supplies piled up in the entry way. We had to prepay as well, which I feel doesn't incentivize the workers to provide any sort of customer service."}
{"text":"How could anyone say anything less than 5 stars for Main Moon? Their crab rangoon is unparalleled in the Madison area. Literally everything from there tastes amazing and is made with high-quality ingredients. I live on the west side of Madison and have been known to drive the 20-30 minutes to McFarland just to get Main Moon. It's amazing."}
{"text":"For take out Chinese food this place is pretty good 
Eating there is not as good for some reason 
Food is way too hot!
Take it home or sit around while it cools off a little!
Fried rice could be better lacks taste
But if in the area this my favorite place to take home Chinese 
General Tso's shrimp is one of my preferred meals"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this place.  Unfortunately crappy Chinese food restaurants seem to far outnumber the good ones.  I tried this place seeing the good reviews on here.  I'm glad I did.

I always order the same thing when I get Chinese food: Chicken with Broccoli.  Simple?  Yes.  But as a kid when we ordered Chinese takeout, this is what I always chose, so it's sort of nostalgic.  

Main Moon's Chicken with Broccoli tasted fresh, and had just enough sauce without being overpowering.  It was just what I was looking for.  The fired rice was spot-on, too.

Staff were very friendly in our brief interactions.  They do offer dine-in seating, but I've only ever had take-out.  When my yearly craving for Chinese food hits, this will probably be the place I continue to choose."}
{"text":"Main Moon is hand's down my favorite place to grab Chinese in McFarland, but really anywhere. No matter what time of day, day of the week, or week of the year - it only takes 15 minutes to get your food. Freshly made each time too. Don't order from the pictures, order from you heart. The staff is so friendly, I'm thinking about proposing in the near future, as I hope to be a part of their family like they've been a part of mine. I just can't even talk about the lunch buffet, I'll start tearing up with how amazing the deal is. Andddd, I just shed a tear. Yum yum yum in my tum tum tum. Miss you, Main Moon xoxox"}
{"text":"Have any of you ever had Chinese?  I could have bought frozen and it would have been more authentic.  Surprisingly, they had a steady stream of people picking up take out.  Apparently no one in this area has ever had real Chinese. 

Ordered spring rolls, nothing special, similar to frozen section rolls.
Main dish was sweet and sour shrimp.  No veggies, pineapple, everything I expect with sweet and sour.

I ate it, I was hungry.  Won't be back though."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, large portions. It's great if you have a craving, but not the best. The dumplings had a really think dough (more like bao) and the shrimp in the Lo mein tasted odd."}
{"text":"First time eating here & was very impressed!!!! The food was amazing! Very clean & loved the decor.
Finally, we've found our new Chinese restaurant :)
Thank you!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 2.5 stars if it were possible.. because it's OK, but not really.

New to the area, Boyfriend and I spotted this place as we were getting to know the area and decided to try it out, since it's the first Chinese food we've seen so far. We decided to go ahead and order our staple Chinese food so that we could compare it to what we usually ate in Philadelphia -- roast pork lo mein for him and chicken fried rice (with no onions) for me.

Boyfriend mostly enjoyed his lo mein. He said it was a little less crunchy than what he was used to, and the sauce was a little sweeter, which he wasn't a fan of. Slightly greasy, but that's what we were used to from our Philadelphia favorite, so it could easily be overlooked. 

My chicken fried rice wasn't really much to write home about, I'm afraid. It was slightly less greasy than I was used to, so yay there. But it was really bland. Since I requested no onions, all it was was rice, chicken and bean sprouts (although, since bean sprouts are an absolute must for me in fried rice, I was very happy to find them there). I doctored it with soy sauce and garlic salt, and that helped somewhat.. but it was just very uniform and boring. No real flavor anywhere. 

This place will do if we've got a crazy craving for Chinese and can't find it elsewhere, but otherwise I believe we'll continue looking."}
{"text":"The best \"fast food\" Chinese in the area. Consistently good, they always get your order right, it's very fairly priced, and always tasty."}
{"text":"Good chinese food is hard to find, at least for me. When I found out about the \"Main Moon\" I said to myself, \"Why not!\". It could only lead to another disappointment in my long list of chinese restaurant failures.

To my surprise!, the Main Moon has had consistent good quality food since I started eating there several years ago. I would highly recommend them to anyone that is looking for a good Chinese takeout meal."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible... Do not eat at this restaurant! We arrive at the restaurant with the intentions of eating there. We were seated and as we were being seated the waitress put a table covering on our table which resembled a transparent garbage bag. We all looked at each other in amazement. We started by ordering our drinks.. all of us asked for water the waitress came back with bottled water. We all wanted a glass of water we did not want to pay $1.50 for bottled water. We ordered our food it came out sporadically. They forgot two of our orders and we had to go ask about them. After our food came no one came around to ask us if we needed anything they just brought our bill. Very poor service very poor customer service and the food was just blah. The bathrooms were nasty the soap had been water down and there was dirt on the floor
Please stay clear of this place I beg you!!!"}
{"text":"Take out Review

Phone Order - the young lady on the line repeated the order back and was careful to mention that I requested no onions in our fried rice.

Potstickers - well browned, but did not make the 7 mile trip home well... thick mushy corporate tasting.

General Tso's Chicken - Hubby was happy with the taste and the heat.  The breading was plain, but there wasn't much of it and only a few pieces were over done.  Easily enough to feed a family of 4.

Chicken Fried Rice - MIld and plain with very tasty small chicken strips.  Some sprouts, but no other vegetables or egg.

The menu is quite extensive and this location is halfway between home and the Bow Wow Beach dog park.

This was OK for take out... I'll update when we have a chance to eat in :-)"}
{"text":"I've been ordering food from Main Moon in Stow for several years and have eaten in a few times. There are numerous menu options and the typical wait time for picking up an order is 10 minutes. I've had a few dishes from them that I like and my current favorite is kung pao chicken. The staff has always been personable. The only reason I took off a star is because it's not gourmet Chinese food but definitely worth the price you pay. A typical meal I order there lasts me (2) meals because you are given a large quantity of food."}
{"text":"Awful, awful, awful...  The worst of the worst of the cookie-cutter Chinese restaurants.  Food without flavor, a menu without imagination and a staff of such profound indifference it's hard to tell they're even there."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this Chinese place because it's local, the staff are friendly, they accept coupons from other Chinese places, and the service is fast. I get takeout here at least once a month and never regret it. They've never gotten a single order of mine wrong, and they always offer me a smile when I walk in the door. This is your average Chinese-American food place that every little town has, but I've never had a bad experience with them and the service is fast and cheap."}
{"text":"Tried this because it's local.  Terrible, bland Chinese food.  Not much else to say.  Will never return.  My wife wanted me to mention her sweet and sour chicken, which was battered fried chicken pieces with a side of sauce in a bowl.  When she asked where the vegetables were (like the picture), she was told there is a piece of pineapple in the sauce and that is what comes with it.  As promised, we looked hard into the sauce and found one very small piece of pineapple.  Bon Appetite."}
{"text":"This past week my husband and I ordered take out. On the phone the woman spoke very good english which was great and resulted in our order being fully correct. We ordered crab rangoon, fried pork dumplings, general tso, and curry chicken and onions. Crab rangoon needed more filling. Fried pork dumplings were super sausage-y (my husband loved them). General tso's wasn't spicy enough for me. It had no spice factor at all. And my husband was hoping that the curry sauce was a little thicker. Overall, great taste though. We will order carryout again."}
{"text":"I was really surprised at how bad the food was.  Service was fine, but literally the worst Chinese I have had.  Very bland."}
{"text":"Awesome menu with a ton of choices. Have been getting carry out here for years. Their combo meals and prices are very cheap for the amount of food you get. The General Tsos and Sesame chicken are my favorites. The fried rice and egg rolls are also top notch."}
{"text":"This was one of the most horrific dining experiences ever!  We waited over an hour to get our take-out order.   While we were waiting to get our order, we watched another customer actually leave with an incomplete order just because they wanted to take food home to their children and had already waited over an hour and a half. Terrible, terrible, terrible!  We will NEVER order from here again."}
{"text":"There is a group of us from work that come here regularly.  It is just your typical neighborhood Chinese restaurant.  The food is good to very good, but nothing special.  But it's in strip mall next to Acme, what do you expect.  The lunch specials are a bargain - I can get a lot of food for less than $6.  The lady who works there is nice, the service is quick.  Yeah, it looks a little divey, but the place is clean.  What's not to like."}
{"text":"Best lunch deal in town! $5.55 for General Tso! Comes with generous portion of chicken, fried rice, and soup! Good breading, good sauce, perfectly cooked fried rice with excellent wok flavor. Main moon is my go to place for American Chinese food in the area."}
{"text":"Main Moon Chinese Restaurant, dine in or take out, provides me with one of the great mysteries of life:

How it is that Americanized Chinese food from Stow, Ohio tastes better to me than 99% of Americanized Chinese food from Chinatown, San Francisco?

Conversation between my sarcastic-ass Dad and me regarding Main Moon:

Sparky:  I bet this really sucks rotten, raw eggs compared to what you are used to eating, Katie.
Me: Actually, this is far better than almost all of the Chinese restaurants I've ever dined at in San Francisco.
Sparky: What in hell are you talking about?  You really are nucking futz, Kate - you used to live in Chinatown!
Me:  Most Americanized Chinese food in San Francisco sucks, Dad.
Sparky: But, it's Chinatown, Kate!  It's CHINATOWN.
Me: By the way, Dad - you do know that the movie Chinatown takes place in Los Angeles, not San Francisco - right?
Sparky: It doesn't take place in Stow, Ohio, either.
Me: I know it doesn't make sense, but Dad, trust me... if I took you to a takeout Chinese joint in San Francisco you wouldn't like it.
Sparky: I highly doubt that to be true.  Come on!  Do a Jack Nicholson impression for me.
Me: Dad - they put peas in Wonton soup and use beef broth instead of chicken.  Everything seems to come with egg in it.  Like scrambled eggs.  And, I once found part of a chicken foot in my Lo Mein.
Sparky: But, it's CHINATOWN, Kate.
Me: Look, I'm not saying that the authentic Chinese restaurants are better than this...  I don't think I've actually been to an authentic Chinese restaurant besides for dim sum.  So, I don't know.  But, as far as Americanized Chinese food - I won't eat it in San Francisco except from one place... and, even then I only get one particular dish.  Main Moon, rocks, though.
Sparky:  It's Chinatown, Kate!
Me: Stop saying that, Dad!  People are beginning to look at you funny.
Sparky:  Do the Jack Nicholson and I'll stop.
Me: ...
Sparky:  IT'S CHINATOWN, KATE!

Maybe it is that they don't put peas in their wonton soup.  Perhaps there is something to be said for ala dente Wontons and Lo Mein.  Maybe it's that I ate the meal with the Chinatown obsessed (it IS one of his two favorite movies) Sparkmeister.  It's actually such a shame that I think Main Moon is so tasty - as after his antics I don't know if I'll be able to return anytime soon.

If he'd been quoting from his OTHER favorite movie, I know for sure I'd never be able to show my face in this restaurant again...

\"Guess what I am now...  Pppfffffttttttt!!!!   A zit!  Get it?\"



(And, if you don't know that quote I am highly suspect of you.)"}
{"text":"One of the first thing I was told when I moved to Ohio is that there is no good Chinese food. I've tried a few places and felt disappointed and then I went to Main Moon. 

It was really good! I've only tried a few of their items but their dumplings are great as is their fried rice. It's not greasy or too salty like some other places. The customer service was good but you have to order ahead of time on weekends or you could end up waiting 40 minutes for your food...

it might not be the most authentic Chinese food but it is exactly what I expect when I order take out. Delicious candied chicken!"}
{"text":"I went in for lunch buffet and was a kinda disappointed, the buffet was well stocked it but most of it was cold. It's at a good price for a buffet.  Ok Chinese place in McFarland."}
{"text":"Good food...can't say that I have ever really had bad Chinese food before but I still haven't after coming here.  They have great deals on lunch specials...between $4 and $6 mostly, with fried rice and a soda."}
{"text":"I have yet to receive a bad meal or bad service here.

Edit 11/25/15:
I think they go through owners or management on a regular basis. Just as you're getting used to a face, new ones pop up. And this latest incarnation needs help.

Had shrimp lo mein and General Tso's chicken. The general Tso's sauce was ketchup at best. The shrimp in the lo mein was rancid, made the entire meal a waste."}
{"text":"I'm here almost every week the young boy screamed ate about my order when I asked him questions I ran out of there in tears without my free pop 16 yrs never been treated like that not returning if he's still employed there"}
{"text":"Good food, and great portion sizes. Every time I order it's usually ready within 10 minutes. The staff is always really nice, last time I was there they even gave me a cute little calendar with my order.  it's a good place to go when you need some quick takeout."}
{"text":"I really do love this place. It's my favorite little Chinese place and since it's in Highland Square its super convenient for me. Their delivery is quick but picking it up is quicker. I absolutely love their potstickers! The chicken with broccoli is my go to but my family swears by their sweet and sour chicken. 
I always hear the complaint that its hard to understand the people over the phone but to that I say get over it. They make good food and speak pretty slowly so just take a second to really listen and there are no communication issues."}
{"text":"Really nice staff and great food.  The food selection is very Americanized, but this place really hits the spot if you are in the area or if you are a McFarland resident.

The price is right and good portions too."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chinese restaurant.  The portions are large, the prices are cheap, and the food is great.  Their sweet and sour sauce actually tastes sweet and sour, their fried rice isn't burnt to a crisp, and everything is just plain tasty.

It's not quite as local as the other chinese places in kent, but after trying all 3 this is by far the best."}
