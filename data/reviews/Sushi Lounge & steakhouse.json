{"text":"I walked in here and quickly found myself the one customer present on a Saturday night.  I was still recovering from the flu and just wanted something small, light, and healthy.  But the married couple who were running this charming little former Sonic Drive-in turned sushi bar would have none of it.  They spoiled the hell out of me while I was there, and the food was all very fresh, original, and delicious.  Don't let the cheesy drive-in look deter you from this little gem.  It's the only Asian restaurant  I know of in town, the healthiest place to eat in town, and after three days of hiking in Boulder City, the only good restaurant  I ate at in town."}
{"text":"The food here is incredible. We ordered a few rolls from the menu but told the chef surprise us and they brought awesome rolls, green mussels all so good. Couple that run the place are super nice. Our new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Great having sushi in boulder. When i walked in all said hi. To really make the place pop the lights inside to bright maybe a little music t.v.  So I ordered calamari to go and a sushi roll. Sushi roll good but I only got  4 small strips of calamari, though it was good just to small of amount. For sure will be back again so cool to have sushi in boulder but lights for sure to bright. I hope they do well in boulder and waitress was way nice."}
{"text":"Oh yeah sushi in Boulder city If you live here and you haven't tried it you need to go ! The food is fantastic The owners are great and to all you super crossers coming through excellent place."}
{"text":"The eel rolls were outstanding and everyone was very friendly.  Plus, I am thrilled to have a sushi restaurant in Boulder City."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! It may look like an old, abandoned Sonic, but the food is great. The Salmon Sashimi is one of my favorites. It had a unique, zesty sauce. The Sweetie Roll is also great for those that like baked rolls filled with cream cheese, like Japanese lasagna."}
{"text":"I really cannot say enough great things about this place. I am a California native and as such have been to several sushi places and places close to the ocean. This place has the best sushi I have ever had, bar none. With no ocean anywhere in sight I cannot understand how they get such amazingly fresh fish. I have been to Yummy Sushi in Henderson, which is highly rated, the fish their was well...fishy. Here at Sushi Lounge I did not have one piece of bad fish. I had the heart attack, a fried roll with spicy tuna, hot pepper, and cream cheese. I had the spicy garlic, with spicy tuna and garlic sauce, and I had the \"Mexican\" with crab, shrimp, and tuna.  All were amazingly good and to watch the chef prepare the meal was fun. I also had fried rice, it was only $0.99 and it was easily the best fried rice I have ever had. Fried rice is one of my all time favorite dishes, I eat this out probably 7 or 8 times a month and this really was the best I have had, there is not even a close second.  We ended out meal with sliced pineapple that had a creamy sweet sauce on it. This place is really the tops for Sushi both locally and perhaps that I have ever had and that is saying something from someone who frequents the beach as much as I do in California"}
{"text":"Charming little place with an extensive menu of sushi rolls, sashimi, fish and seaweed salads and hibachi meats. We came for dinner and I totally pigged out on the teppan yaki filet mignon and shrimp. I want to come back for the bento lunch!  Plus they have all you can eat sushi! I am so thrilled. We have been dreaming of a good sushi restaurant in our little town for a long time. We we be coming back, that's for certain!"}
{"text":"Like any good former Seattleite, I'm a bit wary of hole-in-the-wall sushi places (especially in the middle of the desert), but what is a girl to do when she's on the road, in the middle of no and where, and has a jonesing  for some albacore?   Suck it up, sis, and give the yokels a shot.   Glad I tossed the dice (viva home city!) Truly impressed. Service was prompt and courteous and the food was GREAT!  They do have an all-you-can-eat offering for around $22, which is fair for most, but I typically can't do that much damage. Instead, I had the angel roll and the candy cane roll, and both were phenomenal. Even the presentation was very nice, as you can see from my pictures. While he prepared my rolls, I had hot tea, miso (not too salty), and a complimentary salad.  I've almost got Danny the chef talked into using brown rice. We'll make the drive for our sushi, if he does. Turns out that Yee, the kid who waited on me, is from my neck of the woods - Tacoma, WA. When the lunch crowd dwindled, we had a lovely talk. I would have eaten more, but I was absolutely stuffed.  Good job, little town of  Boulder, hang on to these two."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful!  Do not let the appearance fool you, the food is great!  Once we pulled up our first words were \"wow this place is sketchy\". But because of so many positive review we decided to give it a chance.  Man was it worth it!   At first it seemed to be closed with an open sign blinking on, so we called and they said \"we will open for you\" after that they were wonderfully pleasant host.  We had the Alaska roll and hey sexy roll along with the hibachi chicken all of which were delicious."}
{"text":"By far the worst sushi experience of my life. My wife is allergic to avocado so when we ordered I made sure not to pick anything that listed it as an ingredient. I also informed the staff of her allergy to which they noted on our ticket. For an appetizer my wife chose calamari because we love it everywhere we go. The calamari came out after about 20 minutes wet and soggy. It was truly disgusting. We sent the dish back and after another 10 minute wait (we were the only people in the restaurant) they brought one of the 3 rolls we had ordered, except the one they brought was covered in avocado. Upon receiving the roll we politely requested the check and refused the rest of our order to go. I paid for the entire meal, even the food that had not yet ben delivered to the table and we left. The waitress then offered us 2 complimentary all you can eat coupons that I highly doubt we will ever use but I can appreciate the customer service which is why I gave 3 stars instead of 1. I also forgot to mention that when they brought us our dishes, hers was covered in what appeared to be dried up soy sauce and the fountain drinks had a strange twang to them. possibly stale 2 liters"}
