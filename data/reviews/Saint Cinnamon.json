{"text":"Pineapple and strawberry bowl was fresh however, the sandwich i got only had meat on the \"display side\". Another way to screw you out of your money. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The Location-

Saint Cinnamon is located in Les Halles de la Gare in the Underground area across from Hotel Bonaventure.  The train station is also within the Underground area as well as chocolate and pastry shops, food courts, small stores, and flower stalls among other things.

French Breakfast On the Go in a Library Atmosphere-

What I liked is that you can order a \"reasonable\" standard fare breakfast and eat it family style in Les Halles de la Gare seating area which is painted to look like an elegant library with a fireplace!  The tables are family style so you can put the tables together or pull them apart.

FYI-US Dollar was worth $1.28 in Canadian Dollars-good deal!"}
{"text":"This Saint Cinnamon is located in Les Halles de la Gare, which is attached to the train station (Gare Central). What I love about it is that it is open on Sundays. A lot of the food places in Les Halles de la Gare are closed on Sundays and so if you need a snack to bring on the train and you're traveling on a Sunday, you have less choices. Luckily, Saint Cinnamon is consistently good. 

I love their sweet and gooey cinnamon buns, but I also like their sandwiches, wraps, paninis and salads. Their food is all pre-made like at Cultures and they just warm it up when you order it. Salads are in big bowls and they just get some out for you when you order it. I enjoy their bean salad (has carrots and bell peppers in it) as well as their pasta salad. 

Sandwich and salad combos run about $10. Regular-sized Cinnamon buns are about $4 and mini-sized ones are slightly less, but they are significantly smaller. I always go for the big ones, lol. 

Staff are nice."}
{"text":"This place is similar to the Cinnabon in Ontario.  I got the enable brioche which is identical to the maple Cinnabon.  The icing was delicious but the inside the bun was not as good as Cinnabon's version with white icing and sugary sauce they have in between the swirly bun.  Quite surprising where Toronto beat Montreal on pastries. I will try a different brioche next time."}
{"text":"One of the best little breakfast spots I found in my visit. Fair prices and an amazing pastry case. It was difficult deciding what to get!

The service was okay, and I understand the early morning rush can be stressful. Still, I got my tea and Pecan Roll pretty quickly. The roll was hot and delicious - very sticky, but with great flavor!

There's lots of seating nearby, so this makes for a convenient stop."}
{"text":"I'd rank this between 2-3 stars.  I bought a crab wrap to eat on the train and it was lovely. However, the Saint Cinnamon bun that I bought was extremely dry and lacking in the flavor profile expected for Saint Cinnamon.  I was very disappointed in the end as was hoping to scratch that itching craving for a gooey gooey Saint Cinnamon bun."}
