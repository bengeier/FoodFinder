{"text":"Sammy's has got good pizzas. We always get the donair pizza (lettuce, tomatoes, onions, beef and donair sauce). No cheese or tomato sauce on this one. The only problem is it tastes terrible the next morning."}
{"text":"I feel bad that I ordered pizza from Sammy's on a night I didn't want to cook and it was -40C with the wind, but despite the horrible weather I received my donair pizza, and veggie pizza from a frozen but pleasant delivery man. It takes about 45-60 min for delivery, which they will warn you about on the website, as well as by phone. I can say with confidence that the hour wait is worth it. The pizzas had a crispy outer crust with a bit of chew on the inside. The toppings were plentiful and they actually made sure when I requested half the cheese they normally put on it, it happened! Will be going back to Sammy's for my lazy days..."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza, lots of cheese and toppings and really good crust."}
