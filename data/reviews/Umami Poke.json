{"text":"Tasty Poke, Lots of Options, Good Value  I didn't know there were so many options and toppings for a poke. It was fun to customize my bowl, based on the \"Always Lit\" -- a classic. I'm super-sensitive to the freshness of fish, but I was happy that the tuna tasted fresh.  Friendly, helpful service in a bright, clean place mean that I'm looking forward to returning to try other flavours."}
{"text":"Came here since I passed by the area, and first time trying a poke bowl. The different things you put in it makes the taste that much better! Super friendly staff and willing to make accommodations. Will definitely come again when I'm in the area! Yummy healthy alternatives:)"}
{"text":"All their ingredients are most definitely mouthwatering. I usually would go for rice as a base but decided to try their Zoodles (zucchini noodles) for more of a healthy choice.. with spicy mayo tuna and some of their toppings (which they have many to choose from)... It was absolutely delicious. Every bite was so refreshing. To the point where I was thinking - Why didn't I ordered the large bowl?   The restaurant has a relaxed atmosphere. Decor was cute and reminded me of kicking it back on a beach.. The staff are super friendly and attentive. All-in-all, a very good vibe."}
{"text":"Very good poke, a lot better than most of the other poke spots in the city. Fish to rice ratio is really good and it's not drenched with sauce. I've gotten most of the variations and they're all really good (tofu, salmon, tuna). The zoodles bowl is surprisingly very filling and same with the quinoa bowl. If you've never had poke before, I'd suggest coming here to try it for the first time."}
{"text":"Coming into the shop I was right away blown away at the decor; it was actually such a cute shop with that west coast relaxed beach vibe and a lot of IG worthy shots. You can tell the owners really out their love into it. The food was the better part. They have a good selection of choices all which are pre-marinated in different sauces and you are able to try them all. I was able to make a half and half bowl which I thought was a great option and honestly the marination is what made this poke bowl soooo goood. Definitely one of my top picks for poke"}
{"text":"Visited Umami Poke twice since they opened. Loved their poke bowls, they definitely supercedes other poke shops in Toronto. Umami has a small but great variety of flavours options. I've tried their \"Always Lit\" and \"Jammin Ginger,\" flavours and they both tasted amazing. The fish was fresh and were big chunky pieces! The selection of toppings add texture and brings out the \"umami\" in their poke!"}
{"text":"Once you step foot into Umami you already feel so welcome and cozy. Loving what they did to the space.   I got Salmon and tuna with zoodles,  edamame, enoki mushrooms, seaweed salad, sesame seeds, & crispy onions.  Everything was so fresh I loved it! It tasted amazing would totally come back and try other combo   This is the first place that I know that offer quinoa as well for an extra dollar"}
{"text":"Came twice in the same week and the food is just amazing. Not only that, the staff was great and welcoming. Came in with my baby and even though they don't have high chairs, it's easy to sit and accommodate the stroller on the side. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh!  My colleague brought me here for lunch today as it is a new spot in the neighbourhood. The interior is fun and the menu is very easy to read and figure out. I got the rice base with shoyu salmon and all the fixings. The staff were incredibly friendly and went out of their way to walk us through everything, check in with us after we finished and brought us another round of fresh water even though it was self serve!  To all the vegans out there... there is a vegan option! They have zoodles ( zucchini noodles) as a base option and tofu for the \"fish\" part."}
{"text":"I loved my ginger tofu poke bowl!  Umami is a great addition to the area for a delicious lunch or quick dinner fix.  I loved that the concept is make it yourself because I always read the premade choices and always want to swap out items and make substitutions, etc.  There was tofu, tuna and salmon with different sauce pairings. She let me try the tofu varieties before making a decision (lucky she did because I almost chose the spicy flavour without noticing).    You can have a base of either quinoa ($1 extra), zucchini noodles (\"zoodles\") or rice.  I had half zoodles half rice so that it would be filling but still a bit lighter.  You can pick unlimited veggies and toppings (except that avocado was $1 extra - totally worth it).  They also asked if you wanted extra sauce, which I did but it didn't feel too saucy/salty but I appreciated that they checked before drowning my bowl in sauce.  For tofu, the small size is $8 and the regular is $11.  I opted for the regular given the marginal price difference and it being my dinner.  However, the small size could be a filling lunch portion.  With the addition of avocado, my meal was about $13 with tax, which is great value for a delicious and relatively healthy dinner."}
{"text":"YUUUUMMMMY!!! If you like sushi you'll love this place. It had its soft opening Thursday March 15th 2018. Great fresh, flavorful food. Super friendly staff who want you to leave smiling. All dishes are customized to your taste buds. Choice of Salmon, Tuna and Tofu with varying levels of heat. Regular bowls are $13. The only thing they need to work on is the speed as it was a long wait BUT it was day 1 so i'm sure they'll get into the swing of it quick. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Hi, I've gone here and I had quite an okie dokie time. Was very flavourful... Will maybe go maybe again. :D"}
{"text":"Best poke place in town! I've tried a few other ones and Umami has the best tasting sauces. The fish was fresh and portions are very filling."}
{"text":"I loooove love love poke, and this place does NOT disappoint!!! The flavours are all distinct and enjoyable. The decor is sooo chic and cute and I love the whole Hawaii theme that really ties the food back to its origins. And the array of drinks and options just makes me happy overall, it's good to have a choice of something to drink that ISN'T just pop.  Definitely try the molten lava challenge if you're into spice, it's definitely something that brings the heat.  Steve and Jessica, the owners, are also SUPER HELPFUL, and will walk you through making choices. I appreciate your good cheer, even during the bad weather lately!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to this place after seeing their instagram molten lava challenge, and thought we'd have to give it a try. Upon arrive, we stepped into this cute poke shop with lots of cool decor and seating arrangements. Its surprisingly spacious and bright inside. Steve and jessica (the two servers/current owners) were super friendly, explained all the other different flavours they have and even let us taste test them. I loved the nutty Hawaiian and the spicy salmon. But the coolest thing is that they let you customize your bowl to your liking. They have rice, quinoa, and zucchini noodles as base, then you choose your fish, and theres just so many selections of additional toppings you can have mixed in. After trying them all we ordered 2 molten lava bowls and a spicy Hawaiian bowl.   I usually love spicy food but oh man the molten lava was SPICYYYY. Its very similar to the korean spicy noodles. The first couple of bites were extremely delicious, but the heat quickly builds and youre left with tears streaming down your face. Nevertheless, i loved the flavours. Especially the spicy seaweed salad on top!! Yum!  Overall i would def recommend this place. They offer delivery through ubereats and other companies as well. Super delicious and great prices will get me come back for more for sure!"}
{"text":"Flavours, flavours, flavours! Can't get enough of all the delicious and unique flavours that Umami Poke has to offer with their salmon and tuna (choice of tofu available too).   My favourites include Always Lit (a creamy avocado dressing with some heat - similar to the taste of dynamite rolls) and Jammin Ginger (gingery, sweet and spicy goodness), and I've noticed their flavour board always features something new. The fresh and unlimited toppings are a huge plus!  The place is spacious with a relaxing, coffee-shop vibe that will make you want to dine in. I also love all the touches to the decor that pay homage to Toronto. The owners are super friendly and caring, and I've noticed they take the extra time to welcome first timers to poke which is awesome.   Will come back again and again."}
{"text":"Stopped by Umami Poke today, really enjoyed the vibe.  Loved the flavours and all the amazing toppings. Definitely a great value for the money. Will come back soon."}
{"text":"Umami Poke is a new poke place a few minutes away from Summerhill subway station on Yonge. I dropped by on a Tuesday at around lunch time and was pleasantly surprised by the food and staff!   The atmosphere of the store is nice! They have a neon sign that is definitely picture worthy and 5-6 tables if you would like to dine in. Scattered throughout, there are decorations that remind you of the beach or nature.   As you enter Umami Poke, you are greeted with smiles from the staff and decisions to make regarding your order. The concept of the eatery is a build your own poke bowl where you choose what kind of base you would like first (either salad, Japanese rice, or noodle). Next, you chose from the fresh poke selections to put on top of your base of choice. I had a hard time choosing which poke to select but decided to go for the Shoyu the 6ix (with salmon). I believe their daily poke offerings may change from time to time or they may have a special for the day. Either way, they are clearly listed as you decide. Once the poke is selected, you can choose from a variety of toppings including crab, seaweed salad, cucumbers, red onions, etc. Once that is complete you can add final toppings to your own  poke bowl. A small fish poke bowl will set you back $10, while regular poke bowl will cost you $13.   For my own poke bowl, I opted for the rice base and added my additional ingredients and toppings. The fish is definitely very fresh and the marinades they use on the fish are very flavourful! Probably has one of the tastiest compared to other poke places I've tried!   Staff were very friendly and attentive making sure they got your order right. Since I dined in, the staff even came around to ask customers how they thought of their poke bowls.  Overall, great addition to the neighbourhood and fresh and flavourful poke! The only downside is that the cost is a bit pricey."}
