{"text":"I come to this bakery quite often. They offer cakes, cookies, muffins, cupcakes, bread (even gluten free), pancakes, eggs, sausage, bacon, sandwiches, pastas & fish and chips.

I usually stop by for breakfast on weekends or a sandwich for lunch. The staff is frendly and the prices are good."}
{"text":"We cane here around 11am on a weekday. The waitress that works here is a star. She runs the bakery and works as the waitress as well. She is obviously very busy but still so friendly. The breakfast here was good. Average portion size. The bakery had so many tasty freshly baked treats to choose from!"}
{"text":"I went to this cafe one time to use the Internet.

They were polite and helpful. The food was decent.  The all day breakfast was appreciated. The Internet was fast.

I has a bit of a 1970s feel which isn't for everyone."}
