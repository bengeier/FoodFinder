{"text":"Great space and the service is good. Food is so so, but stick to beer. The wines are headache inducing crap priced like real wine. Spent over $400 with 6 friends (food and wine) and ordered about 5 bottles of wine over the evening. One was so bad, it was like tangy cool-aid. Kitchen: get better wine."}
{"text":"Kitchen is the new kid on the West end block. It looks much bigger and swankier from the outside than it really is. Drink prices are comparable to the Beaconsfield down the street, and they serve dinner till about 11PM on the patio.  the bartenders are friendly and they have no cover, local dance nights on the weekend.  If the Beaconsfield was the answer to the Drake, Kitchen is merely an extension of that thinking."}
{"text":"Once upon a time I looked forward to patio season so I could chill with my friends on the patio at Kitchen.  The staff were awesome and the food WAS good.  they used to have this awesome vegetarian sushi that I craved.  It's no longer on the menu... needless to say I won't be going back.  Sucks."}
{"text":"The Kitchen is a great lunch spot. The menu is varied to please all appetites. I've tried the sandwiches, pasta and chicken. All good stuff. A real gem."}
{"text":"Huge portion, great price, great service, great good! If you are looking for a quick and quiet lunch or great catering, small or large, try this place!"}
{"text":"LOVE The Kitchen!  Our office orders lunch everyday!  The menu is packed with delicious items and easy to read.  The prices are too good to be true.  Delivery is available.  I have to say, the best part of all - is the SERVICE!  Every person I encounter from The Kitchen, whether on the phone, or in person is so friendly and helpful. We love The Kitchen!"}
{"text":"The Kitchen is one of Las Vegas's hidden secrets. We almost order it everyday for lunch and every item on this menu is amazing. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a great lunch on a budget. Great people great food!"}
{"text":"Great food. I've never physically been to their location but I do get delivery for work at least 1-2 times a week. Food is always consistent and the staff is great! Delivery is always here within 15-20 mins so your never waiting hours to eat. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Not very impressed. The food seemed to be tasty according to the menu and there was a variety to choose from. Not! My mouth was watering  for no reason. I was mad I wasted my money and time #disappointed. I will not recommended this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I was having work done on my vehicle at T&M Automotive not far away, and stumbled upon \"the Kitchen\" on Yelp when looking for somewhere nearby to have lunch after picking it up.  The Kitchen is a relatively small storefront establishment open from 8 AM to 3 PM M-F (closed weekends) that was empty when we ventured in for lunch.  If you want to visit this restaurant, the name on their building is for their catering company, \"Soirees Caterers\".    They have a large selection of lunch items; over 20 hot and cold sandwiches & burgers, wings, pizza, strombolis, calzones, and some pasta dishes.  Plus a few dessert items, fountain Coke products, and canned Pepsi products.  Since their menu is larger than we expected, we ordered a sandwich and a salad to share so we could try different items.    We tried the Bleu Cheese Chicken Salad $7.50- Grilled chicken breast, candied walnuts, cranberries, bleu cheese crumbles, & tomatoes; served with a raspberry vinaigrette dressing and a warm breadstick.  This salad usually also has apples, however they did not have any that day.    The salad was fantastic.  The seasoned chicken breast was grilled in house, then chilled.  Very good!  And all the other components of the salad were fresh and flavorful.  The raspberry vinaigrette was especially good.  I would definitely get this again (and I bet it's even better with the apples!)  For our sandwich we ordered the \"Kitchen Sink\"- $8.50.  Their menu says that it is their Best, so we had to try it.  The Kitchen Sink comes with roast beef, ham, salami, provolone, grilled onions, sweet peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, oil & balsamic vinegar, served with a bag of chips.  The sub roll was soft and the sandwich was delicious.  I would also order this again.  I was very pleased with our experience and just wish it was more conveniently located for me."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food! This spot is near to where I work and I have eaten there 5 times since finding it a few months ago. (That's alot because I mostly bring my own lunch to work.)  Love the cobb salad, and the breadstick on the side is so yummy I think I'll have to try the pizza some time.  Good dough yo!  Today we ordered delivery to the office and we all had burgers.  Oh.My.Goodness!!  A great hand formed burger with a strong cheddar cheese on top.  Add the fresh veggies and buttery bun and you have the making of a solid burger!  Comes with fries for $6.25.  Go to lunch spot?  FOUND."}
{"text":"Went to The Kitchen for the first time, the food was delicious and everyone was extremely friendly. The man who helped me, James, was helpful and patient. Service was quick and there was a lot to choose from. Definitely recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! On route to Red Rocks I yelped food in the area and this gem popped up!! It's located in a industrial park and they also do catering business. We were warmly greeted and reviewed the menu on the top wall area but they also have menus on the table if you need something closer to read. I ordered the Vegetarian Panini on grilled sourdough. My husband had a grilled cheese and was asked what type of cheese which was nice to have choices!! We also had two bowls of homemade split pea soup and tatter tots. My sandwich consisted of mozzarella, Havarti, sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts and roasted red pepper. I found the sandwich to be flavorful, good sized and the sourdough bread added a great taste!! Great atmosphere and bathroom was clean and smelled kind of like warm cinnamon!!  Awesome mom and pop place off the strip a bit and our total check came to $23!!"}
{"text":"I'm personally not looking to spend $25 on lunch out everyday, so The Kitchen is my go-to.  It's in a little industrial complex that's newer and very clean. Small, maybe 8 tables, but never packed. It's an italian deli type shop with sandwiches dominating most of the menu. The employees are nice.  The prices are pretty amazing. A big sandwich (that I normally can only eat half of) is around $6.75. Can of soda is a buck. While I wouldn't define it as \"gourmet\", the food is good quality and is clearly prepared with care. Work lunch? In the area and hungry for some satisfying eats on a budget? Kitchen it is!"}
{"text":"What a lovely hidden treasure!  A small establishment with a variety of meals available at a VERY reasonable price!  I had a large burger, fries and my friend had 1lb of chicken wings. Each of our entrees was a generous portion of food and came out to less than $6.50!  We had a dozen zeppoli for dessert, and they were delicious and coated with powdered sugar.  The entire dozen was only $1.50!  The staff was super friendly and they have been in the food service business for 28 years (they also are a catering company)!    This is a wonderful place to grab lunch and they are open from 9am to 3pm!  Another great thing:  They deliver for free for lunch!  If you haven't been, think of it as a treasure hunt for a delicious and affordable real food (not fast food) lunch."}
{"text":"Quiet little lunch place.  Clean but small dining area.  Good honest food.  Nice group of people running the place.  Good eats and cheap!  Hard to spend more than 10 bucks for lunch. Haven't found anything super special here but found nothing bad either.  It is a solid choice for lunch that gives you no surprises."}
{"text":"Ordered Philly steak. My sub of choice. I only get meat, cheese and sweet peppers. This was not my favorite but still pretty good. Meat and cheese was on point. Bread was decent an tasted fresh. Price was $7.50 which included sub and bag of chips. They gave me a soda by accident, large size at that. Place was clean and employees were great. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Was visiting Las Vegas on a business trip. My company has an office close to The Kitchen. Stopped by for lunch twice in the same week. On Monday had a tuna salad sandwich on wheat with a 'generous' order of tater tots. The bread was fresh baked. The tuna salad was solid with fresh lettuce tomato and red onion. The tots were fried to a perfect crisp. The lunch was so solid I recommended my colleagues come back later in the week on Thursday. Next time ordered the egg salad sandwich on wheat. Again, the bread was fresh baked. My coworker mentioned to me that he noticed the egg salad wasn't scooped out of a container, yet made fresh. The tots were yet again solid."}
