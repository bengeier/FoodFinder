{"text":"Do you like large portions of greasy Mexican food from a mom & pop shop?  If so, then Betito's checks off all those boxes for you.  It's located in an extremely depressing strip mall, even by Phoenix standards.  The shops used to be anchored by a Basha's supermarket, which failed.  Betito's is in the storefront that used to be a failed Quizno's, right between a failed Dairy Queen and a failed Heart Attack Grill.  In other words, good parking is readily available.  The menu consists primarily of combo meals.  There's a helpful photo of each and nearly all of them are $7.40 or $8.40.  When they conceived the menu, there must have been a sale on the stickers for '4' and '0'.  I ordered the cheese enchilada and carne asada burrito combo, with double rice in lieu of refried beans.  There's a weird little condiment bar that had a few sauces, peppers, onions, and cucumbers.  Yes, cucumbers... they were actually refreshing.  The sauces weren't as appealing, and the green one was very hot.  My food came in a styrofoam box that weighed as much as a kettle bell.  The prices aren't super cheap, but they don't cheat you on portions.  The real star of the meal was the carne asada burrito.  It was filled with tender beef, guacamole, and pico.  No filler.  The rice was good, too, except there was so much of it.  It was soft with a subtle tomato flavor and a few diced vegetables mixed in.  The enchilada would have made the Heart Attack Grill proud.  It was layered, not rolled, and the cheese, oil, and bland tomato sauce pooled in the styrofoam, overwhelming the shredded lettuce that was garnishing the meal.  The place sure seemed authentic.  Most of the clientele was Hispanic.  A spanish soap opera played on a small TV.  Some of the combos come with a Coke in a glass bottle.  And the cashier was very nice to me.  They charge a $0.60 fee on debit/credit card transactions, but she offered to waive it before I even knew it existed.  My advice is to just order the carne asada burrito, not a combo.  Pay cash.  And take pride in supporting a local small business."}
{"text":"With the small price range you pay for a huge portion, Betito's is the place for your mexican food craving! I've been to other mexican fastfood, but nothing beats Betito's Carne Asada Burrito and Soft Taco!"}
{"text":"Despite the Google reviews that said the positive Google reviews were fake I decided to give this place a try. I got the #34. The beef taco was ok. The carintas was garbage. The worst carnitas I've had. The beans were no better than Taco Bell's and the rice got tossed in the trash. Salsa bar? They dont give you chips. I guess you have to pay for them. I put some salsa on my already bad carintas and it made it worse. Are the postive reviews fake? I suspect so. Or people just really love food that taste like it belongs in a dog's bowl."}
