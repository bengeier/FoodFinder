{"text":"I don't get the complaints, everything I've had here has ranged from good to excellent. They might be a little heavy handed with the fish sauce in their pho but it works for my tastes. I recommend their rare beef and meatball pho, egg rolls and spring rolls are good too."}
{"text":"my boyfriend I stopped here for carry out last week.  we got dinner for two which included wonton soup, crab rangoon, short ribs, cashew chicken and Mongolian beef.  we got some extra soup; chicken pho.  first, the soup.  the wonton tasted like it had been sitting for awhile.  the wontons were wimpy, like they were water logged.  the chicken pho was delicious.  we reheated the broth then added the noodles and some cilantro and a squeeze of lemon.  the egg rolls were ok, nothing special.  the entrees tasted as though they were reheated, not cooked fresh.  which isn't surprising since while we were there we kept hearing a microwave beep every few minutes.  we wanted to like this place  especially since we live close by.  unfortunately we won't go back"}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten here in a long time but a friend had some takeaway. Found a GERMAN COCKROACH in the rice!! I feel obligated to let other people know cause that is just nasty."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Vietnamese food in Lake County.  The owners give personal service and prepare the food just like at their home.  They offer a full menu including breakfast.  They serve Vietnamese coffee, made one cup at a time, which can be hot or iced.  Meals come with unlimited Vietnamese tea.  Our favorites are, Pho, Bun, Savory Crepes, Breakfast Sandwich, and VN Spring Roll.  You will not find better authentic Vietnamese food in the area.  Golden Sea also has a full standard Chinese menu which is of the same high standard."}
{"text":"We have ordered from here twice because they are right around the corner from our house - they give you tons of food but most of its way over fried.  The bourbon chicken was ok but slightly fatty and the general Tsos was really just breading.  I would not recommend anything breaded! I'm sure we would order again but I can't see craving it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Vietnamese food this side of Cleveland! The menu is quite extensive, offering a full selection of Vietnamese and Chinese foods. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well. My boyfriend and I are big fans of non-chain restaurant take-out foods. We have their number on speed dial!!! (If only they delivered!) We are weekly patrons there!  It makes my week to eat food from there! They even sell big bags of Lotus loose green tea, which I love!   The owners are really nice and prepare their food fast and with a lot of care. They have a lot of options for vegetarians! One of my favorites from them is the Singapore noodles with tofu. And the Pad Thai is excellent, too. I have it made with tofu or shrimp and no egg, extra spicy. The crab rangoon is always crisp and creamy and the Vietnamese spring rolls are super, too! I recently ventured to the Chinese side of the menu and ordered up some Kung Pao tofu, extra spicy. I've never had tofu prepared that way and I loved it! The tofu was deep fried, with lots of peanuts, scallions and the red sauce was on point! One small gripe is that their fried rice is a bit lacking. They only put fried egg in it, nothing else.   My boyfriend really enjoys the Vietnamese Grill with noodles, shrimp and beef. It all comes on a bed of noodles with chopped up eggrolls, cucumbers and carrots on the side. And a clear sweet/sour sauce to drizzle over all of it. He also raves about the Vietnamese Rice Soup with beef.  Tastes like Grandma made it. Great comfort food!   He recently tried the Pho noodle soup for the first time. The owner stressed that beef was raw, you must cook good! That was a little tricky, getting the thinly sliced raw beef to cook in the broth. After many microwave attempts, we just put it all in a pot on the stove, which we should have done to start with, but we were really HANGRY! So, the Pho is not a take-out friendly item. I would suggest having this as a sit-down meal at the restaurant itself, which we plan on doing in the near future.   I look forward to exploring their menu every time. Everything we've had from them has been excellent! It's really nice to have options other than the typical Chinese take-out foods, in this neck of the woods! We have big love for The Golden Sea!!!  Amen and hallelujah!!!"}
{"text":"Over priced for sure. They take a really long time as well. I'm not too much of a fan of anything on the menu"}
{"text":"I can't speak for the Chinese food but the Vietnamese food is awesome!!! The Vietnamese crepe is so delicious and could be a meal itself or split between a few people. Her pho has so much flavor and depth... Truly a Lake County gem. I've never been disappointed with my experience here... It's just a husband and wife that run it so sometimes it's takes a few minutes longer so if I'm in a rush I'll call my order in ahead and she has a table set and ready when we come in for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Golden Sea is a really solid Asian restaurant in Lake County. The service has always been great and the restaurant itself is very clean and welcoming.   The Vietnamese menu items that I have tried were all very delicious. The Vietnamese Grill really stands out. It was one of the best Asian dishes I've had in the area. I've tried some of the Chinese dishes as well and each one was very solid but they don't compete with the Vietnamese options.  I would definitely give Golden Sea a shot if you are craving some Asian food."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Very tasty food and vegetables are nice and crisp. The food is not smothered in sauce to cover the flavor . Love getting food and great service from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Yuck.  Just yuck.  Seems hard to mess up 'run of the mill' pre-prepared Chinese food... but somehow this place managed to get it done.  Overly fried, drenched in breading, dry fried rice, and very weird and awkward feel when you walk in to pick up your food.  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I can only speak for their Kung Pao Chicken which i have to say is an incredible rip off for what you're getting in return.  The quality of this food is extremely sub-par which would be okay if it weren't $9 dollars!   That was the deal-breaker.  Also, the Kung Pao Chicken and even the fried rice in no way shape or form consist of the typical ingredients used to make these relatively simple dishes.  Actually, they were lacking ingredients which again sirens loud of a rip off.  Tasted nothing even near just being okay. I will not be revisiting here again.  I grew up near a multi-ethnic Asian community and am somewhat knowledgeable with these kinds of foods.  I wanted to go back there and try the Pho but I've already lost faith in this place from eating what I consider to be the worst Chinese food I've ever had."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in here on Christmas Eve to get carry out.  The restaurant inside was nice, clean.  It was a bit dated, but overall decent.  We ordered dinner for two which included wonton soup, eggrolls, crab rangoon, short ribs, cashew chicken and Mongolian beef.  We also ordered chicken pho soup to try.  The eggrolls weren't anything special.  The crab rangoon was ok.  The short ribs were the best part of the meal for me.  I really enjoyed that.  The cashew chicken and Mongolian beef didn't taste fresh, it tasted as though they were reheated leftovers.  While we were waiting for our food we kept hearing a microwave running and the \"ding\" of when it was done.  So, that shouldn't have been a real surprise.  I've had better leftovers from other takeout places that I've reheated at home myself.  We won't be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The best asian cuisine around the owners so nice the sesimi chicken is the best they recently changed the menu to better incoperate vetmanese foods there soft vetmanese eggrolls are awsome with there penut dipping sauce  the beef pho is good you put the raw beef in and the broth cooks it so good. If you want a variety of appetizers get the flaming appetizers you get a little of everything in a flaming pot with can be used to sear and heat up your food. I am really looking foward to the hot spot apparently it's a giant cooking pot for up to 2 people where you make your own soup? and you get beef chicken shrimp and other things I can't wait to try it. They also have great deals on king crab legs. Also if you want crawfish this is the place to get them I love going to New Orleans for crawfish bakes but this is a few miles alway."}
