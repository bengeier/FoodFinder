{"text":"I suppose I should have read the reviews before I came here. That's on me.

I wouldn't say this place is terrible, but it's not all that great. Sorry.

I had the chicken shawarma pita sandwich. She asked if I wanted spicy chicken or regular. I asked for spicy. The chicken is in warming trays rather than being freshly cut off the spit. This chicken was not spicy. Not at all. It was very heavily seasoned with Indian/Pakistani spices. I'm guessing garam masala. It had an intensely savory taste, but no heat. I just found the taste overwhelming compared to the other flavours and the chicken almost looked and tasted more like beef than chicken. It was truly odd. I'm not sure what the \"regular\" chicken is like, but I don't think I'm coming back to try it out.

The sandwich was poorly constructed and it was a complete faff to eat. Mess, mess in my office. Mess, mess all over my dress. Shame. Who's going to pay my dry cleaning bill, yo!"}
{"text":"Ugghhh Always awkward to be the first reviewer, but here it goes. I went into try out the place as Im always trying to find new shawarma spots in Brampton. I ordered the Spicy Chicken shawarma with some of my favorite toppings. I was pretty happy with the taste of the Spicy chicken as the spices worked well with my choice of toppings and sauces, and was something different from other places (Almost like tandoori chicken; probably the desi influence). My biggest beef with the experience was the fact that the chicken was on the draw side. As someone that has had undercooked chicken shawarma before (terrible experience), Im happy that it was cooked thoroughly, but I have to be honest. I shouldn't have been surprised as my meat was taken from a warming counter with pieces of meat only inside and not cut right off of the mound of meat rotating like you get from some places. 

Nice little spot with GREAT PRICES and Im sure ill go back around lunch time with the hope of the meat not being dry. All this place needs to do is if they are gonna store meat in a heating counters is to store the meat in its drippings or some sauce. Ex: Chipotle gives you meat from a heating counter, but its been sitting in liquid so it doesnt taste dry. 

Keep in mind that three stars is \"A Ok\" and four starts is \"Im a Fan\" as I am really on the fence between ratings."}
{"text":"Cold food, vegetables looked wilted. The rice was off the charts oily and spicy, and the place was empty. You think with the lack of customers they could have cleaned the restaurant, everything seemed---- STICKY!"}
{"text":"Well I went in to hope to get a decent size portion but NO! I went at night the lady barley wanted to put any meat or topping on my dinner. If I asked for something extra like more onions, she made me feel guilty. 

 So I tried in the day. And again another tiny portion. I asked for more Tabbouleh  and they actually picked up one strand of parsley. 

 When I notice cheap spots that don't want to give a good portion.. I leave and never come back... I did that with the last 4 places that were in this exact location prior.

 I AM DONE HERE!"}
