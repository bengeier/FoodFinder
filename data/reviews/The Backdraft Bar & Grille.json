{"text":"I've been here a few times. The hoagies are pretty good for bar food. The nachos are pretty lame. I would usually rate this place a 3 stars, but lately the service, or lack there of, has been a joke.   The last time I visited, my fiancee and I chose our table and ordered some drinks.The waitress gave us the special rundown for the night and then left saying she would be back for our food order. Twenty minutes later I urged my fianc√©e to pay for her beer so that we could leave. I'm not the type of guy to remind a waitress to do their job. I prefer to leave and not give the business my money.   Finally the waitress came back and my fiancee was able to pay for her beer.....I should mention, the waitress was NOT coming back for our order, she tried to ignore us and walk by to the jukebox to pick a song she wanted to listen to. Absolute joke. I don't take it personally, but I get so mad that there are people like this woman that are given jobs that they clearly suck at. Anyhow we left hungry, but it was better than wasting money supporting that type of staff.    I'm sure we will be back since we live very close, but this service is also the reason we only go once every several months."}
{"text":"Alright, so here's the thing about backdraft....they have hands down the best *eat in* Hot bbq wings I've had in my entire life.  Now, that being said, I have had some fantastic wings in my time.  40 wings and a pitcher of beer special down at Smokin Joes? Yes please!  But the first time I had these Backdraft hot BBQ wings I was blown away.    These wings aren't tossed in the sauce, but the sauce is instead wonderfully drizzled over top of the crunchiest morsel of happiness you've ev... You know what, stop in, order the Hot BBQ wings and a beer, rest your elbows on the strangest, yet very comfortable 'eblow-rests' in the burgh.    Now to add my disclaimer.  I've told people about how awesome the wings were, ordered some takeout, and had people question my opinion with the results.  The other flavors are still good, but certainly not mind blowing.  Also, the time the wings sit in the styrofoam will wreak havoc on the happiness factor.    I have not had the Reuben (which makes me a little bit sad), the hot pepper cheese balls are about what you'd expect and the burgers are average for a bar....but the first bite into those hot bbq wings will change your life...  This review was brought to you by Mr. Bluejay and the letter W."}
{"text":"Everytime we decide to eat here, there is an error in our order. If they don't mess something up, the wings are dry and there is never enough meat on the hoagies. Not worth the steep prices! Don't make the mistake of wasting your money here!"}
{"text":"Love it there! Everytime my husband and I go ALL of the bartenders are so nice. Food is amazing. It's a little expensive though.  Every time my husband and I go we spend around 50-60."}
{"text":"My wife and I were there last night to celebrate our daughters 40th surprise birthday party. The atmosphere, service, crowd, DJ, parking, restrooms, doorman, etc etc etc were OUTSTANDING!  We will definitely go back for dinner and drinks as prices, service, were above and beyond expectation. THANK YOU to EVERYONE !"}
{"text":"This is the best bar/grille by me! I just moved to Brentwood and got coupons in the mail for this place. We went and it was empty. But had a good vibe and good people. The waitress was amazing and very helpful. The food was just as good! We will be going again."}
{"text":"Most overpriced and cheap bar in the south hills. $5 for a half dozen wings that were half covered in sauce. Requested more sauce and I had to bring my wings over to prove it. Their answer \"we only give one ladle of sauce with our wings\". They did finally comp the extra sauce. But then I get to hear the kitchen staff say \" we can just take the sauce back if he's not going to pay for it\".  If the cook had just tossed the Wings enough, there would have been no problem. It's obvious the priority here is to cut corners and be cheap. This is not my first experience.  The potential of this place is off the charts, but obviously the owner is too cheap to realize. Charging me $.50 for sauce cost them $50 in more business tonight."}
{"text":"Updating my previous review, because they have been making some positive changes for 2017.  Nonsmoking now.  And new menu coming soon.  In addition, they have done some remodeling and the place is looking great.  It's still nothing fancy, but it is a great little neighborhood bar that has a decent selection of beer, good food, and a nice atmosphere to gather with friends."}
{"text":"I like the Backdraft, I really do, but for a neighborhood bar it has become way to expensive. They have great food and always a familiar face, but for North Baldwin it has just gotten way to pricy! However I love the non smoking, hands down the best decision from ownership! I still go here but I have scaled back due to cost! My wife and I had two appetizers and a few drinks it was over $50, that's just crazy."}
{"text":"Pretty cool vibe. This is the definition of a yinzer bar. Full of bar food, smoke, beers & pens fans cheering. There are TVs everywhere plus a big screen. There's a backroom with pool tables, darts and basic game machines.  Stopped in because per livingpittsburgh, Thursday is backdrafts wing night for .50cent wings. However, it seems as if the wings are .50 everyday and .40 on Wednesday. We had fun watching the pens game and ordered wings, fries and perogies. I ordered honey mustard & my bf ordered honey BBQ. The food came out in no time. The food was good, but average. Also they charge .50 for ranch.... Small cups and not even homemade (tasted like Kens)  There are a few reasons for the 3 stars. it doesn't seem like there are servers. We sat at a booth and then decided to grab menus from the bartender. No one came by to take our order so we went back up to the bar to order. Also had to head back to the bar for drink refills.   The wings were OK but again very average (in size). Also, instead of tossing wings in sauce, the sauce was just poured on top. Some wings barely had any sauce.  If I lived in the area I would most likely come back. Again, the vibe was cool and the crowd seem fun. I seen someone's loaded nacho and it was huge! Eat at the bar to get full service. Also, keep in mind smoking is permitted. Its a large bar so didn't seem too smokey, but if you don't smoke I'm sure it wouldn't be your cup of tea."}
{"text":"This is my \"go to\" place for wings in the South Hills. I have tried all 16 flavors and love all of them. The hot garlic and the sweet and sassy are very good. The Backdraft has eat in wing specials on Tuesday and Thursday.  The rest of the food is also very good. The menu is very large and has typical \"bar food\" items. The Reuben and Scuba Steve Hoagie are excellent choices.  This place can get very busy especially on the weekends. They often have live bands playing or a DJ. All in all it is a great bar and restaurant to try."}
{"text":"I pass this place all of the time. One of my neighbors told me that the place was changing the menu and undergoing renovations. I decided to check it out. I took my 2 young adult sons and headed over for dinner.  My youngest son decided not to eat but my oldest ordered the Buffalo Grilled Chicken sandwich. I can't eat anything spicy but my son really liked the sandwich. It was a huge piece of chicken and they don't skip on Buffalo sauce. The chicken was cooked nicely so it was still a little juicy.  I ordered the 1/2lb cheeseburger. I think it might be more than a half a pound. It was huge. It was seasoned perfectly and cooked nicely. The bun was big enough to cover most of the meat and it is served toasted.  One of the downsides is that we drank soda and iced tea. They both tasted awful. They need to clean their lines. So if you go eat there go for a beer."}
