{"text":"I can eat breakfast at any time, so I always love the places that offer it all day long.  It's small, and only open til 2pm, but the the food is excellent, great prices and generous portions.  The potato pancakes are amazing, but they sell out quick, so get there early if you want to try them."}
{"text":"Heavenly!! The pecan French toast is out of this world! Some sort of cinnamon sugar and pecan mixture on top that breakfast lovers must try to believe. This place should have a line around the block, but we were the only ones there! My8 year old  proclaimed it the best food he ever had! There are so few breakfast places in the Brentwood area, JT's is a gem! It's a cute, clean environment inside as well. From the outside that is not obvious. If you are near rt. 51 in that area, give this place a try."}
{"text":"I love me some good diner breakfast food, and I have to say JT's is absolutely terrific! Usually Hot Metal Diner is our go-to breakfast spot, but since they've closed 885 we were looking for somewhere a little easier to get to. I'm surprised I've never heard of JT's before, it's so good!

We went around 12:30, so a bit after the mad breakfast rush. We were only one of two tables in the restaurant, but it's easy to see that if they get busy getting a seat might take awhile. It's not a very big place, but I think that adds to the charm of it.

I got the fritata and my husband and I split a short stack of pancakes since we read in other reviews how good they were. I'm so happy we did! They were some of the best pancakes I think I've ever had. They're thin like a crepe but still taste fluffy like normal pancake. The fritata would have been plenty of food on it's own though! The egg, veggies, cheese and sausage concoction covered my whole plate and came with a side of Mancini's toast. It was delicious. That paired with the pancakes was the perfect combo of sweet and savory for breakfast. I was so full I had to get a box to take the leftovers and unfortunately didn't even touch the toast.

One thing that really excites me about JT's is that they have Cream Dried Beef! I've never seen Cream Dried Beef offered as a breakfast item anywhere else in Pittsburgh. I love getting this when I go to my hometown in the middle of the state. Unfortunately it's only offered as an occasional special and I didn't look at the special board until after I ordered my fritata, but I'll definitely be coming back until it's a special again!

If you're looking for a new breakfast place, JT's is totally worth trying. It may take me a few visits to know for sure, but I think I might like it better than Pamela's."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this local diner for a while. I have heard some very good things about it. I knew the place was small and would be cramped. Sadly, I was very unimpressed with the food. 

My wife had steak and eggs, the eggs were not cooked all the way, the steak was overcooked. 

One daughter had the sausage and egg sandwich, it was bland. Other daughter had chocolate chip pancakes. the pancakes are very heavy, not fluffy. 

I ordered the frittata which was okay. A lot of good ingredients but very bland flavor.

We left wishing we would have went to one of our normal breakfast places like Frank &  Shirley's or Bob's Diner."}
{"text":"So yummy! It is a local diner that feels family owned. The food was delicious, and it wasn't expensive. Also had a nice atmosphere. Can't wait to go here again!"}
{"text":"We were in the area furniture shopping and my husband found this place here on Yelp. I was a little nervous at first since the place looked like a bar from the outside and when we got inside. We got there around 12:30 and I believe they closed at 2, so there was no wait and only a few people in there. The menu was a decent size and the food was delicious. My husband got a breakfast sandwich and I got an omelette, which included potatoes. (I can't remember if his included them or we ordered them separately.) My omelette was great, but the potatoes really stood out to me because I feel like it's hard to find good flavorful breakfast potatoes these days. I was so pleasantly surprised by this place and we'll definitely be stopping back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"5 stars all around home cooking is great cook sandy is friendly and wonderful a must come too place ."}
{"text":"OMG.  I ordered the so called \"Potato Pancakes\", eggs over medium, and bacon crisp.  I ordered a Diet Coke.  The drink was so flat, no fizz.  The meal came and she said here's your special.  I asked for apple sauce, it was very good.  Now the meal - the potato pancakes were on the bottom, then two nice size slices of bacon, with a thin slice of cheese and the two eggs on top.  Eggs were runny and not over medium.  Bacon was half cooked, texture of rubber, no flavor and a far cry from crisp.  Potato pancakes were moist and a bitter flavor.  I would recommend serving them crispy, fresh and eliminate add in flavor.  It is what it is.  I paid for the meal, stood up to leave when the table nearby was being served - OMG, crisp good looking bacon!"}
{"text":"JT's is a small, family-operated diner right on Brownsville Road across from the Whitehall Plaza.  They are open for breakfast and lunch.  The staff is very friendly and food is good.  The JT Omelet is my favorite.  The fare on the TV is rather mind-numbing and the syrup is just corn syrup, but they are generally quite busy, so many customer don't count these major issues."}
{"text":"Coffee tasted like dirt. Didn't bring out the whole order when cooked. Then gave half of my order away. By the time I received the rest of my order the first half was cold. And they forgot my toast. The food was meh."}
{"text":"For a hole in the wall restaurant. They get it. You can feel the love they put into the food. I had the #20 veggie burrito the use of real eggs in this dish and not liquid eggs makes this diner very happy. My wife had strawberry French toast with fresh strawberries. Needless we will return to this gem."}
{"text":"A nice little place good food good prices service is great.  Pancakes are different but good pecan french toast was great so was the western omelet."}
{"text":"The best place for a filling delicious breakfast. I love JTs, the only way it could get better is if they were to move to a bigger location. They always do a great job and I've been there probably 20 times."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite diners in the south hills. Open for breakfast and lunch only. It is very much home cooked food and super nice staff. The food is tasty and plentiful. I go for the omelets and haven't been disappointed yet. This is what a local diner should be."}
{"text":"One of the very best places in The Burgh for breakfast. Their Western omelette is delicious and very filling. Also a fan of their potatoes and bread. Place is very small so I get the food take out."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is just what Pittsburgh needs to challenge the imperial-like rule of Pamela's Diner.

The only way I learned about JT's Diner was by word of mouth, and I'm so glad I listened. Though a greasy spoon, it's full of heart and charm.

Most orders come with local, thick Italian bread that is always crispy or family-secret pancakes. Let me stop and mention the pancakes in more detail - they are not your regular buttermilk frisbees. They are a pancake/crepes hybrid that is simply delicious, not overly sweet and sinfully dense. My boyfriend demands that these pancrepes be a part of every visit we make to this diner no matter time of day.

It's not just all about the pancrepes either. The eggs and omelettes are fluffy and filed with fresh ingredients including ham off the bone.

Every meal is a very generous portion and leaves you satisfied if not asking for a take home container. Though aged and a little rough around the edges, this diner is my new go-to for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant. Best diner in Pittsburgh. Great food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Living in the south hills my whole life had been looking for a local place for years. Found JT's about a year ago...

My wife and I eat here 2-3 times per month. Food is homemade, nothing frozen or canned. Weekends the potato pancakes are awesome!!! Take 2 potato pancakes, layer with ham carved off the bone, cheese of your choice and eggs - sour creme and apple sauce on the side. Lately they have been offering one of the pancakes as a zucchini variation - luv'em!!! 

Omelets are generous and well stuffed with ingredients, home fries on the side (I am sure to order mine well (brown edges) - otherwise well cooked  without much color as many people prefer them. Toast is make on the grill, no toaster for this diner inspired restaurant - oh, did I say it is 2 large slices of Mancini's Italian bread? Yummy.

This weekend I ordered the fritatta special. Sweet or hot sausage, onions, red peppers, mushrooms and salami with cheese. Very good. O\"brien potatoes (homefries with onions & peppers) and of course the 2 hefty slices of italian toast.

On the weekends is very busy - usually short wait. Tables are a bit cramped together, but hey - it is a \"small\" local joint.

Can't go wrong - if you are looking for low-cal fare, not here..."}
{"text":"Almost one of the only places for breakfast in Brentwood. Huddled in a storefront along Brownsville, this joint is very small and crowded during the weekend. It's only open until two, but they serve breakfast all day.. Unfortunately, it's breakfast like someone else's grandma would make for you (rather than your own).  Nothing I had was great or remarkable.  The toast was a little greasy and definitely made on the griddle. My eggs and short stack were ediable.  If you think Pamela's is the greatest breakfast spot in the world, you'd probably be satisfied.  However, this was not cutting it for me.

The entire time, most of the staff was sitting at the table next to us, watching tv, being a little loud.  I understand it's a neighborhood establishment and probably a family one, but I really didn't want to spend my breakfast listening to the chatter.

If you're close, it's convenient if you catch it at a lull. My parents love this spot so take my opinion with a grain of organic, sustainable, fair trade Himalayan salt. I would like to blame my yuppie tastes on this review, but honestly, I'd recommend Eat N Park over here. Take the drive to another staple."}
{"text":"Overall this was a good experience. I had #6 with french toast and bacon and my companion had the same except with pancakes. We had coffee and split an order of potato pancakes.  The eating area is small but in a cozy way.  It isn't trendy like Thai Cottage but about the same size. I really liked the setup.

The coffee was very good as well. I like it black so really appreciate good tasting coffee.  The potato pancakes were tasty, and especially the bacon.  The french toast was fine and used good bread.  The flavor was subtle.  

The only complaint was with the pancakes.  They didn't appear to be done and my companion could not eat them.  Odd since the pancakes are very thin and looked done on the outside.  We didn't complain though so I didn't factor this into my rating of 4 stars."}
{"text":"Ate there 6wks ago and have been meaning to review..

11:30 on a Saturday and only about 1/4 full.

Ordered the breakfast burrito and coffee. I never would've imagined that the burrito was the size of a football. I tend to eat a lot but this was obscene and a challenge for me. The eggs were fluffy, ham was good too and the tortilla was stuffed. Must've been at least 6 eggs, probably 8 or 10.
Can not find anything close to that for under $10. I've stopped looking for breakfast on weekends or when family visits, we'll go here. I won't eat at Denny's when I'm close to home again."}
{"text":"Great homemade breakfasts, love all of them especially with their ham off the bone.  Great coffee and Italian toast too.  It's a little cramped and small inside but I guess that's part of the experience.  Would give it a 5 for just a little bit more comfort.  But I'm definitely a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Kay and I required nutrition for a last-minute X-Mas shopping mission weeks ago, and we found it in spades at the modest Brentwood staple known as JT's, a suburban canteen my own father has sworn by for years. As I would find out yet again, Dad is rather tasteful and wise.

We had little time to dally, so I ordered myself a Ham Off The Bone Sandwich. Accompanied by brilliant, kettle-boiled housemade potato chips, the meat was soft as cream cheese and as flavorfully fatty and brackish as the best brisket. American cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, and a fluffy envelope of an omelet-style egg were bookended by prodigious butter-slathered slabs of Texas Toast. I should have stopped there for an easy 5 out of 5 would have been in order. 

A weirdly doughy short stack of chocolate-chip pancakes played the role of dessert (and they are dessert to me). These flapjacks required a good deal of syrup to make them edible, so...no, I can't say I was taken by them nor will I state that they were fit only for the family dog. The bittersweet chocolate chips also elevated them slightly as they so often do with anything they bless. A complete tosser they weren't, but pit 'em 'gainst Pamela's in this jousting match and JT's gettin' knocked off of the horse. 

Be mindful that JT's is a bit cramped in terms of seating. Thankfully, we came by on a slow weekday afternoon just an hour before they closed, thereby avoiding a wait or a rain check. I'm sure weekends are impossible here, and those surely maddening mornings are deserved, JT's being a rock-solid hash house among hash houses that Guy Fieri would likely fall in love with.

P.S. The service was adequate on all fronts."}
{"text":"I was only there once, the food was average and an older guy, possibly the owner thought it would be okay to sit at our table, spread out his newspaper and sip his coffee. I hope he enjoyed himself cause we sure didn't."}
{"text":"Horrible.    After receiving our breakfast my girlfriend and I were very unpleased with it and asked for new food or something different.  The owner came out and said that's how it's served like it or leave and made me pay the $22.35.  Never going back.  I have eaten there many times before and everything was wonderful. After the rude discussion with the owner I will make my own from now on.  Worst place ever!!!


Side note.   I wrote this review over 2years ago and never hit post.   So when I opened Yelp for the first time in a year I had to post it."}
{"text":"When it comes down to it, I guess I diner's true value is in the food. And JT's has good food. My omelet was very good and full of flavor. The side of Italian toast was thickly cut and had an airy texture, so it wasn't too heavy. My wife's poached eggs were good as well, as was her side of toast (one slice raisin one slice cinnamon). If the review was based solely on the food, it would be a 4 or 5.  If it were based solely on atmosphere and service, it would be a 1. 

My omelet was filled with flavor, but not with double ham, as I had ordered. In fact, there was barely any ham and only 3 or 4 mushrooms. My Italian toast was perfectly airy, thickly cut, and dry - the way I like it and ordered it. But that was after they grilled it with butter and I had to send it back, and wait 10 minutes for it again. My wife's eggs were poached perfectly, but that was after sending the first plate back. Clearly stating \"extra well poached so there is no runny yoke,\" the kitchen didn't even bother to try. They were barely even passable as light, almost like they just came out of the chicken' a$$. Her toast was dry and toasted well... after the first order, which we had to send back also, because it was just thrown on the plate in a puddle of water and was soggy like toilet paper from said chicken after it birthed her first order of eggs. 

As a result, my omelet came out first, ten minutes later the rest of our orders came back correct. Since I'm chivalrous, I waited to eat. Thus, cold eggs. 

With all that said, the food was still good. So I have to admit I probably would be back. I just hope the kitchen has more respect for the order next time."}
{"text":"I was introduced to JTs last week by a good friend of mine. I had the #5 and it was delicious. All it needed was a little bit of hot sauce for kick. The Mancini bread was a perfect addition to the food. You definitely get your money's worth as there was easily enough for two meals. Highly recommended!"}
