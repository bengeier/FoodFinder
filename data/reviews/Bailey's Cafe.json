{"text":"Cute little shop. Great coffee especially the Americano. Friendly owner. The sleeves are reusable and made out of coffee bags. Nice touch. They don't have too many baked goods but offered tasty biscotti samples."}
{"text":"Made a stop at Bailey's on a Sunday afternoon. It was a pleasant visit, the owners were super nice and talkative! The Americano was super dope..! Not sure what the origin/blend was but it was flavourful and fruity.   Hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Bailey's Cafe is located about a 30 second away from the intersection of Dundas/Bathurst. The small coffee shop offers a selection of coffee based drinks and several baked goods. I stopped by on Saturday morning around 11am and the cafe was not busy. The staff there was super friendly and nice and the coffee was great too (got an iced americano).   Overall, small cafe with a relaxed and friendly vibe. Would totally return if I am around the area!"}
