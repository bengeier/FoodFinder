{"text":"Absolutely not authentic Malaysian food if you really know Malaysian food. Nasi lemak they served me was sweet and not coconut rice, fried kuay teow is like HK style fried hor fun, satay is not satay at all. Shouldn't call it a Malaysian restaurant."}
{"text":"Lots of room for improvement here, but that's a good thing right? Three (2.5) stars means things can only get better otherwise it will go outta business very fast.

Your laksa is not laksa at all, it's definitely not Asam laksa... It resembles curry laksa and Singapore laksa but it's nowhere close, but you made it tasty enough and sort of one-of-a-kind laksa that I would actually encourage people to give it a try. Call it Markham Laksa maybe, a new breed. ;-)

Other dishes tried by us Malaysian bunch all came back with pretty negative remarks unfortunately. I'll let my friends write their own reviews but from what I have heard, your nasi lemak is way off with the rice and other ingredients as if you never tried the real nasi lemak.

All that said, we still want to see you succeed, so 2.5 stars (yes sorry you don't really pass) to encourage you to bring your dishes closer to authentic Malaysian DNA."}
{"text":"You pay for what you get. While the restaurant is a bit difficult to find, it is a favourite amongst my gym going friends who live in the area. I have heard comments that the food is too sweet or not authentic but to be honest each time I have asked for them to alter to my specification and they have been delighted to do so. 

For a place like this you don't expect much in terms of decor or service but yet it does just fine. I would def come back if I'm in the area because it was quick food and while it is a bit food-courty there are no food courts nearby and I'm certainly not going to drive to First Markham as this is much closer to my gym and home."}
{"text":"I really liked Malaysia Grill! It's not much to look at from the outside -- it's in a strip mall next to a laundromat just off of Highway 7 in Markham Village -- but I hope it succeeds as it's very close to my house.

The dishes I had were Thai, so I can't really speak to the Malaysian fare offered here, and I know very little about Malaysian cuisine anyway.

I had the coconut rice, which was VERY sweet. This probably isn't for everyone, but I liked it. For an app, we shared chicken satay with peanut sauce. The sauce was delicious and the chicken was tender and juicy. For the main, I had the red thai chicken and they nailed the sauce.

All in all, I was impressed."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this local place, so like a previous reviewer said - maybe my expectations were just too high? They did a great job with marketing before opening, but then the food did not 'deliver' against expectations for this rich & flavourful cuisine. Hopefully they can fix their Laksa issues before it's too late for their business. The Na si goreng was ok, but nothing to write home about. They should study Restauran Malaysia in order to improve and to make people chose their restaurant  before driving to Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Better pad Thai at food court. Too sweet, no veggies other than bean sprouts. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Would give 3.5 stars if I could.  Tried the following: gado gado, Singapore laksa, and chicken curry roti canai.  Was pleasantly surprised!  Curries were peanuty and flavorful.  The laksa noodles were nice and chewy  and the broth was great too.  Gado gado was yummy too!  Not sure how \"authentic\" it is but it's definitely tasty. Will have no problem going back when the opportunity comes up."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken pad Thai, Singapore laksa, and the tamarind beef. I found all 3 dishes very good."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with Malaysia Grill. I walked by this new restaurant while waiting for my doctors appointment and overall I would say that I found Malaysia Grill to be a great little restaurant. 

I ordered the Satay Beef to start and it was delicious, especially with the signature peanut sauce. It was a wonderful way to start the meal. Next was the mutton curry with roti and I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of the curry. There was plenty of mutton and potatoes in the dish that I needed to order extra roti to finish. 

I will be coming to Malaysia Grill again and would recommend it to anyone in the area. I found your fusion of malay/indian/thai to be very delicious and not your traditional tastes. 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"His restaurant is NOT closed. They just changed the name to Chef Lynn. Same owner and same food. Thai/Chinese and Malay food"}

An authentic Malaysian, Thai and Singaporean just off Markham Main Street?! Not really....

Offers Weekday Lunch Specials from $6.99 till 2:30 pm.

Chicken Rice? Laksa? Pad Thai?   Char Kway Teow?

Maybe I came with a high expectation and left a little disappointed.

Singapore Laksa ($9.95) was overwhelming sweet with no hint of spices even when I ordered extra spicy. A few piece of white meat chicken and Tofu fish cake as protein. Where is the sambal paste? For $10 portion size is small with hardly any ingredients.

If I just rate Malaysia Grill based on my Laksa, it would be a 2 star. 

I might come back to try other dishes..... and would do a update."}
{"text":"In my opinion, Markham is in need of an inexpensive Malaysian / Thai food place that is not a food court for lunch (we already have a food court option at First Markham Place).  To make the point stronger, the one on Markham Main Street and 16th Avenue is expensive due to the small portion.  So I am glad to discover Malaysia Grill.  Malaysia Grill is not at a prime location, because it is on a back alley.  It has average seating, average atmosphere, average food and average services.  What is not average is the pricing of the lunch specials.  I ordered a Pad Thai ($6.99) from the lunch special menu.  It tasted home-style authentic but not well made.  In fact, it tasted like food court food in downtown.  The flavour was one dimensional and not bold.  But the portion was big.  It came with a bottled water, which I greatly appreciated.  At this price level, the value is 4 starred.  Food alone, the Pad Thai earns 2.5 stars on my book.

This is a perfect example of you get as much as you pay for.  As a value lunch, it is A-OK.  Besides, there are many selections on the lunch menu.  I would gladly try other things out."}
