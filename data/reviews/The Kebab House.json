{"text":"Great little shawarma place in the middle of Lakeshore Village.
The food is surprisingly good and not very expensive at all.
Their \"2 Shawarma wraps for $7.99\" is an amazing daily deal that they have.

Worth the walk from Humber :)"}
{"text":"Ordered again from this little unknown gem. 

It's literally a husband and wife joint and I've only ever gotten takeout for obvious reasons, but the portions and taste are amazing value. 

I had the chicken schwarma plate for $9.50 tax in. 

The chicken was delightfully tender and moist. They give you AMPLE sauce. The salad is good and they are very appreciative of your business!"}
{"text":"had an 'entertainment book' voucher so thought we might try the kebob house...when we got there, the proprietor informed us that they don't honour the voucher...we did stay and had a decent meal, but would not go back..."}
{"text":"Dirty and do not accept anything but cash. Would have been nice to know before I ordered and had my order ready. It's 2017... Seriously? You can't get a POS system."}
{"text":"Driving along Lakeshore we were starved for lunch, my boyfriend decided to take me somewhere he used to go when his office was close by. We pull up to the Kebab house and I wasn't immediately impressed because of it's outer appearance , but I have learned not to be too quick to judge ;) we got 2 HUGE portions of salad/rice/chicken and 3 drinks for $22.00 which was not bad at all because it was absolutely delicious and enough to feed 4 of us! The chicken was juicy, crispy, and straight up perfection and the sauce they put on top adds a great spicy/creamy sweetness to the mix. Will def be back if we are in this neck of the woods!!"}
{"text":"So my friend ordered a shrawma and I ordered a Gyro. There was pineapple on mine?! And instead of tahini, hummus, garlic mayo, or tatziki, all he had to offer was mayo. The pita was stale. And the place is DISGUSTING. If you look up you will see the grease dripping down from the ceiling. Grease everywhere, I should have walked away when I saw the poor state of sanitation. So gross."}
{"text":"Had the lamb shawarma for lunch.  Price was decent for what you get but the lamb was quite salty and oily which made it hard to finish.  Tom Cruise has been to this place and he has the proof on his wall which I found neat."}
{"text":"I usually go to Osmose or Paramount for shawarma, but this place is within walking distance of my home so I decided to give it a shot. For the price and quality, I would definitely go back for my shawarma fix. You can get two for $8, but one is more than enough. Not the fanciest joint ever, but you should never judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"I don't know but when we lived nearby (about a few years ago), my husband used to go in there once in a while and get us beef shawarma sandwiches.  They weren't the greatest since the meat didn't seem like it was cooked on the spit; however, it wasn't the worst either because it did have a lot of garlicky flavour, it was real meat and tender and the toppings were always fresh.

OK so fast forward to present day.  I had the worst craving for a beef shawarma but there was no way I was going to drive out to either Tarboosh in Mississauga (best ever) or Armenian Kitchen in Scarborough (second best ever) and I've just dismissed Ali Baba.  Then I remembered this place so I figured I can't really go that wrong.  

When I walked in, I saw a huge spit of chicken shawarma. I would have ordered that but it looked like it was a lot of dark meat and I'm not really a fan.  I asked the gentleman if he had beef, which I just assumed he'd say that he ran out since there was an empty spit.  To my surprise, he said he had some.  I figured maybe it was all shaved and ready to go so I ordered it.  Then I see him slicing something off the spit and it looked like raw gyros (the colour of Spam) but then he put it on the grill.  I so wanted to run for my life but he was really nice and I had already committed to the order - luckily it was only $5.00+.  When I got back to work, I was reluctant to eat it but I took a few bites and it was nasty.  Although I don't like gyros and doner, I've had it many years ago but this had a way more mushy texture - I kind of felt like I was eating grilled Alpo.  It was very greasy to the point where my fingers were getting oily just from holding the pita.  I'm not sure if the hot sauce was oily or if it was from the Spam.

They must have changed ownership because that was NOT anywhere close to what we used to order a few years back.  It wasn't cool how he serves a gyros/doner thing and tries to pan it off as beef shawarma.

Anyway, 1/5 but I'll post it as two stars since (a) the gentleman was nice and (b) I can see people liking the chicken shawarma.  Plus, I saw some samosas there and they looked pretty good - should have just got a couple of those ..."}
