{"text":"Be carefull , double check if they are open or not before come maybe for nothing. 
They don t respect their open sign and they close when they want. 
They write everywhere door sign, website and else, they close at 2 am but I came yesterday at 1 am, they look at me like l m crazy to come so late and said we are closed.
l will prefer to stay out of this restaurant, if they can not even respect their own open sign, how l can trust what they put on my plate."}
{"text":"They do not know how to operate a resturant. I spent 3 hr here waiting for my food. Stay away from this resturant if you value your resturant experience."}
{"text":"Really great Chinese style BBQ and lamb soup. BBQ has many great options. Many vegetarian options as well if you have vegetarian friends.  The cripsy sugar- coated durian is a must try for any durian lovers!"}
