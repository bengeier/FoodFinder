{"text":"Breakfast was good. Good variety. Dinner was fair almost a Denny's feel. Bar is very cozy."}
{"text":"Good food but a little pricey. Staff was very good and saw to all our needs with a cheerful smile."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant inside of the Fiesta Resort Conference Center. It deserves it's own entry here on yelp. Now we didn't get to have the complete restaurant experience here due to it being late, and our only reason for being here is a flight missed connection.  I have to give 2 thumbs up for the service in the lounge area with a smiling face by Jenn the waitress. She had to work late with the rush of hungry travelers, but she didn't seem to mind.  I had a soup and salad. On the menu it said \"Chef's Famous Chicken Tortilla Soup.\" I had to try it and wow...it's the best I've ever had anywhere. So, here in our situation tired, hungry, and stuck...I discovered the best Tortilla soup ever. I wish I had the recipe. If anyone ever gets graced with it, please let me know. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I arrived early for a seminar and decided to pack my gullet and break my fast. I will start with the most distracting part of my meal--a pesky fly which would not leave me be.  Okay, the hostess is gracious and highly presentable but is not fluent in English, which posed a minor, short-lived inconvenience.   I selected my seat and the manager visited me promptly to ensure I was satisfied with my selection. That was attentive?  My server was on the manager's heels to take my order, coffee and the breakfast buffet. The coffee and cream was at my seat by the time I returned to my table. (Umm, fly? I'm STILL swatting it away.)  The ambiance is quite nice and I especially like the stained glass decor, copper art accents and lure of the fairly lush patio.  What's that sound track playing overhead? Gratefully it is faint enough to not be distracting.  My service was not overly attentive, I was passing my time and preferred some solitude.  The buffet selection? Well, coffee and juice is included (I dont drink juice) for $14.95. (That fly? Wow, it is riling my ire.) two kinda of scrambled eggs, the plain is (did I read 'janky?') WAY overcooked. (I took a food science class in college and the proper way to cook scrambled eggs is slowly with a low heat--it should come out soft and a little 'wiggly.' This was NOT that.) There was also some scrambled eggs with a selection of nightshades. I could not eat the 'home fries' night shade potatoes. The sausage is good, not overcooked, with a touch of striping from the skillet. The bacon is of a thicker cut and cooked to a 'just crisp' y texture--i do not like flimsy bacon. There is a selection of dry cereal and hot oatmeal with 'sides' to doctor it. I got some of the plain yogurt and doctored it with nuts--healthy alternative. There is a small selection of fresh fruit to choose from. There is also a selection of breads and a toaster, butter and jams.  Coffee? Acceptable, served with (real) cream.  Overall, my breakfast was/is a fair a reasonable option."}
{"text":"Seated right away and given water. That was it. No server. Table next to us apparently succeeded in making drink order but never received them. We left. Went to Philly's Sports Bar nearby, which was really good."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for a free drink at the bar. Again, not one to turn down free alcohol, I walked down to the bar. It was a cozy setting with low lighting, multiple booths, and an S shaped bar. I think the S shaped bar is most frustrating and least productive: inevitably, you will have your back to someone at the bar, which is awkward and not conducive to conversation, if that's your thing. The beer selection wasn't bad. I had a local IPA that was tasty.   I was hungry so I got the chicken quesadilla. It was awesome! A very large portion size with huge chunks of chicken and fully stuffed. The guacamole and sour cream on the side added creaminess and a coolness to the dish that was much appreciated. Its gotta be the best quesadilla I have ever had as bar food.   The breakfast the next morning was good as well, but rather limited on fresh fruit selections and \"healthy\" items."}
{"text":"I'm assuming this is pretty standard for a hotel restaurant to not be amazing, but this one was mediocre at best. Underwhelming service, unimpressive food, small menu and pretty pricey at that. I'd say take the shuttle to a different restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Tomorrow morning we will be trying the breakfast buffet. Tonight we both had fajitas and the were delicious, the best I have had in years. Thanks to the wait staff for taking such good and friendly care of us during our meal. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am staying at the hotel and I've been eating the spinach salad since I'm on a healthy diet. It seems its the only thing I can eat but the burger, fish and chips was enjoyed by my boyfriend very much. The staff is super sweet and very nice."}
{"text":"For a hotel restaurant I'd have to say it was excellent. I'd also advise locals to go for the specials. The prices were fairly inexpensive for what was served and the drinks were generous. I opted for the Prime Rib special and it was very good. The sides were likewise excellent. The vegetables were crisp and perfectly cooked. The mashed were not overloaded with unhealthy junk. The breakfast buffet was extensive and the server immediately presented me with a To Go container when I told him I was pressed for time. I'd say give it a shot."}
{"text":"Sometimes I have good experiences here, I have also had terrible experiences here.  They tend to be more good than bad though.  I typically sit at the bar area.  They have a full bar with several beers on tap and various wines.  They serve typical bar food and some dinner entrees.  It's a-ight.  They have a decent happy hour with cheap drinks and 1/2 off appetizers.  The baja fish tacos is my go-to selection.   The service tends to be quite slow as there is usually just a bartender and one server for the entire room.  It's not a bad option if you just want to stay at the hotel and don't necessarily want to eat in your room."}
{"text":"20 mins for tea, the place was not even busy bad service good food!"}
{"text":"I've stayed at the Double Tree 4 times and eventually get stuck eating at thier restuarant once per trip. I never have a problem during breakfast. They have a large buffet and an interesting enough menu. Some of the morning waitresses are on their game. The oatmeal was tasty and accompanied with brown sugar and raisins. The bowl of berries was fantatsic. However, this place just fails at dinner. Flavorless hotel food, slow service and a general disinterest in customers (especially later in the evening at the bar). Steak has been tough, pasta bland and break microwaved.  I suggest sticking with breakfast."}
{"text":"We were here because of a conference being held here.  Restaurant was fine. The service was very lack-luster, but it's summer (slow) and I assumed she was new to waitressing. Turns out she isn't, she just isn't very secure with herself & doesn't understand customer service. More afraid of \"getting in trouble.\" (verified by the manager who came over later).  They ran out of their happy hour wine, so our friends waited 20 minutes for the manager to \"get a new bottle.\" (not exaggerating that time, actually 20 mins). Guess she got one, then realized it wasn't going to be cold soon, so finally they upgraded the wine but served at HH pricing. Good move after such a long wait to get a glass.  Unfortunately, when we asked for another glass, we were told \"they are out, the manager won't let me give you more of that one.\" In other words, the manager didn't want to pour anymore of the upgraded wine at HH price. Okay, so we ordered the red HH wine instead.   We ordered the prime rib special. It was \"fine.\" No complaints, but everything was very average. Part-way through dinner the glass got knocked over on accident, more full than not. We asked to get another, they made it VERY clear we would have to pay for it since it wasn't their fault it spilled....  Well they were right, but we were the table that waited 20 mins to get the first one, then were told we couldn't have any MORE of that one... In terms of food costs, how much is a few ounces of a cheap bottle of red? It lacks logic, unless they are being beaten up about budget.   I ran to the restroom to wash the red wine out of my clothing. My friend asked if they had a towel or something at the front desk, explaining wine had spilled all over me in the restaurant. They gave her a Shout wipe, which really helped. She went back to get a couple more from the front desk and was told, \"We can't give out any more,  they are expensive. You can but them if you want.\" (hear the theme?)  She charged the little shout wipe packs to her room for I think $2 each!    Basically, I feel like what is most important to this place is survival, and they aren't doing well. The focus on the customer isn't the priority - feels like someone in the hotel's management is makiing decisions based on penny-wise, hammering fear of losing (more?) money into all the employees, thus missing where it dings the customer's experience."}
{"text":"Gloria is the best! She is so attentive and friendly. We were at the hotel for a conference and are at the restaurant. Gloria made our visit memorable"}
