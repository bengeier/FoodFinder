{"text":"Amazing, better than any Indian restaurants I've tried in Calgary, spicy butter chicken and great fish pakora.  You guys should open  restaurant"}
{"text":"I work on 17th and I am also new to Calgary.. So I am always on the look out for new great places to have lunch and dinner. I have been in Calgary about 9 months now.. And have tried 5-6 East Indian restaurants, and Green Chili is my favorite. Take out, or sit in.. It's always great and the staff have always been lovely.  The prices are fantastic for the proportions you get, I always have enough for a huge lunch, and dinner as well from one take out order. They also have a very good app that you can use to order on, which I've had no issues using. Good job Green Chili... Mmm!"}
{"text":"Because I'm Indian, we don't often go out for or order Indian in, but this week we were lazy and craving some Indian food. We ordered the chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, dal makhani, rice, raita and 2 garlic naans. With tip the bill came to $60. Honestly, the food was excellent - flavourful, a tad spicy (ask them to reduce the spice if you don't take it), and authentically North Indian. I prefer it to Moti Mahal which is just around the corner and is heavy on the cream and is so rich I usually go into a food coma afterwards. Plus, the value for the price is amazing. We've eaten 4-5 meals out of this one order (Indian for breakfast, lunch and dinner and lunch again!). I really hope these guys stay open. Their lunch buffet is also excellent. Been there twice and would go again!"}
{"text":"Used to order delivery from Green Chili on 17th Ave weekly and had nothing but great experiences and good food.  About a month ago, we ordered and tool a large bite out of my vegetable samosa only to find that it was a meat samosa.  As a vegetarian, I was absolutely horrified that I had ingested beef.  I called at once and was told that they were sorry and that they would put 10% off my next order on my file and send me vegetable samosas right away.  Wanting to give them another chance, I just called and tried to place an order and asked to use the discount that had put on file for me.  The same gentleman that had helped me the night of their mistake refused to give me a discount stating that he sent out the right samosas and that was all I was entitled to.  

As anyone who is a vegetarian is aware, it is very important to not eat meat and not something that it just brushed under the table.  It is not just a mistake and should be treated a little more seriously then just a mix up!

Will never order or eat at Green Chili again.  They have the worst customer service!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the bad reviews.  We have tried several Indian Restaurants in the south and not one is as good as Green Chili.  The dishes are delicious!"}
{"text":"really nice atmosphere, good halal food. reasonably priced, place is a little small but they make the best of it. great customer service. love the buffets"}
{"text":"Excellent food with loads of spice. The prices were not the best for the portion size but not overpriced either. I would highly recommend Green Chili to anyone in the neighborhood but would not drive across the city for it. Fortunately, having four locations makes it quite easy to access wherever you are."}
{"text":"The food here is consist and and good if you want something really spicy get the vindaloo!! Their lunch buffet is awesome too! Only gave it 4 stars cause of the hours and the price!"}
{"text":"This place is dripping in awesomesauce! Every dish is full of pleasing flavour and aroma. My only issue is the heat could be turned up on the vindaloo... nonetheless, it's delish!"}
{"text":"I've never tried this location, but the small take out one on mcleod trail and about 75th is great. Spicy if you want, but never just for hot sake. Vindaloo is the one for me. Masala chicken is a popular one too. Pass on the rice. Gets dry the next day. Just get naan."}
{"text":"I've been to the Green Chili at Crowfoot and loved it, so naturally I would try the one closest to me this time.

We got there at about 6, so it was empty, except for 2 people waiting for take-out. Service was quick and very friendly.

We ordered 3 curries, lamb vindaloo (I would recommend lamb over other meats as it is fattier and meant to tone down the heat), butter chicken (a guilty pleasure), and a prawn one (forget the name). Along with 2 orders of naan, and some rice.

I noticed right away that the food wasn't very hot, merely warm, so I suspect it may have been reheated as a leftover from the lunch buffet. I know curries can't be made fresh to order from scratch, but I expected a bit fresher, or at least a bit warmer to give us the impression it was fresh. Our vindaloo had a great amount of spice, our butter chicken was a bit short on the chicken part, and the prawn curry was great. Naan was delicious, and we had just enough to take home leftovers for my lunch the next day. I asked for another order of naan to go (but they did cheap me out a bit) 

I did also notice that prices and availability differed between online and the menu in store. Prices were about $1-$2 more expensive in the restaurant than online. Which is strange. 

Overall, pretty good (A-OK) I'd go back but probably just for a buffet and not for dinner."}
{"text":"Well, I recently had this Green Chili open in my neck of the woods.

Ordered take-out, was on hold for about 5 minutes before I could order, went when it was ready and the cozy restaurant was almost full. 

Food was ready when I got there, owner and waitress were friendly.

The food: just ordered 2 entrees, Butter Chicken was delicious, but chicken was quite dry. Lamb Vindaloo was yummy, not as spicy as I expected, and had too much vinegar as it had a very noticeable taste of it. They were very generous with the servings, as well as the naan. 

Oh, and they charged the correct web prices unlike the one on 14th st whose prices were $1-$2 more in-store than on the web.

Overall, I'd go back. Will update on re-visit and see quality of food then."}
{"text":"A big fan the staff very friendly and helpful, food is very good I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We get take out from here often and we are never disappointed.  If you are not familiar with the menu then  try a lunch buffet because the variety is great and you can try everything.  All of the dishes are great and the owners are not offended if you ask for your dish to be spicy.  This location is small and always very clean and the staff are friendly and accomodating."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Calgary by far. Very consistent."}
{"text":"That undescribable feeling you get when waiting for a food delivery. Phoned in and ordered Green Chili Authentic Idian cuisine while the boss and I were enjoying a lazy Sunday.

We decided to order the Prawn Bryanni, Malai Kofta and Veggie Appitizer platter which came with vegetable pakoras, samosas, and paneer pakoras. 
Simple but enough food for both of us. When it arrived, it was hot and fresh. The delivery man was really nice. We grabbed plates and ate up. The flavor was all there and we enjoyed everything that was ordered. Definitely worth keeping the menu in your stack of delivery menus."}
{"text":"Don't even try it. Food was horrible. We ordered pad Thai ( noodles were soggy and tasted horrible) we couldn't even finish 1/4)"}
{"text":"We ordered take out here. We showed up when told our food would be ready, but it was cold when we got it home. In our meat dishes we had about 5 small pieces of meat in each one. The rest was lots of greasy, under seasoned sauce. Lots of sauce is nice, but when you're paying $14 for an entree you should get way more meat. The naan and rice portions were small for having so much sauce as well. Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered twice , once we payed cash , food was ok , 2nd time I payed Visa , my card
got Skimmed , never again"}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food I've ever had. The goat curry is my favorite. My friend told me of this place because he works there and it was every bit as good as expected. Really friendly service! I'll be back."}
{"text":"We've only gotten take out a few times, and the only Indian food restaurant I have been to in Calgary so far.  In any case great food; love the Korea."}
{"text":"Was a little weary about this place at first but my bf really wanted to eat here one night and I'm a little on the fence when it comes to Indian food but I thought we'd give it a go. The butter chicken was wonderful!!! I was pretty pleased with the whole experience. We ordered for pick up and since they weren't busy it didn't take long at all. Good portion sizes for $14, we had left overs the next night. My bf always gets the Malaka (or something like that) Chicken and says \"it's mint everytime\". One thing I would recommend.... if you don't like spicy, tell them to make yours mild or else they'll cook it SPICY! Other than that it was great and we'll go there again."}
{"text":"I am a huge Indian food fan, so when this Green Chili location opened up I was raring to try it!  I have only done take-out, but the interior, although a bit cramped, is well decorated and has a great atmosphere.  They have a lunch buffet Monday- Friday and Sunday 11:30 to 2pm.  I am always receive a friendly greeting when ordering and picking up.  Their samosas are not the best I have had, they lacked some flavour.  The chicken korma was not my favourite either, it was weighed down with too many spices, as well as the naan was too oily for my liking.  The other 5 dishes I have tried were all quite good, the tikka masala is a must try!  The saffron rice and roti are perfect!  A huge meal from here usually costs around $45 for 2 people.

This is one of the few Indian restaurants in the NW area.  Since I manage to still stuff my face every time I order from here and the convince of the location being a plus, I would highly recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"This is the second location of Green Chili that I've tried.  They only offer takeout and delivery.  

I walked in to order and didn't receive the friendliness greeting, in fact the man at the front ignored me at first.  Eventually he acknowledged me and I ordered my food.  He said it would be about 45 minutes, I said I would come back.  I returned promptly, my food was waiting for me.  I paid and left, no \"have a nice day\" or \"enjoy your food\" from the guy.  When I got home, which is about 15 minutes away, my food was already cold.  Thank goodness for microwaves!  The taste and flavour of the food was good. 

Its safe to say that I probably won't order from here again, the food was good, but there are other places I'd rather go."}
{"text":"Went for take-out on a Thursday night.  Staff were friendly.  Food was good for price point.  Recommend the Lamb Vindaloo.  Spicy yet you can still taste the layers of flavours put into the dish.  Lamb was very tender.  Beef Curry was a bit dry for my liking and not as spicy as I would have hoped.  Naan was a bit thick and too greasy.  Vegetable Biriyani and Aloo Gobi were average...good but not amazing.  I'd go back again!"}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet, takeout.
Was definitely a good value and they were generous with Naan bread.

I don't go out for a lot of Indian food but I would definitely return here when I get my next craving."}
{"text":"Used to get delivery often when I lived in the area.  Samosas are quite good."}
{"text":"Another Calgary gem hidden near the motel village."}
{"text":"Just had take out. I must've admit pretty damn good. It showed up hot, and it was hot until I finished eating. Butter chicken was awesome so was the tandoori chicken the naan, and The cheese pakora. And the basmati rice was perfect. 
That's the whole truth on takeout."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch and had the buffet. Thankfully I was wearing pants with an accommodating waistband. Each dish was flavourful and had nice spice. I enjoyed the spicy mango pickles, naan, butter chicken, lentil and eggplant dishes - actually everything on the buffet was excellent. The service was attentive and I could tell they were proud of their offerings. I will certainly recommend and return."}
{"text":"My friends and I went for my birthday. 
We ordered the chicken curry, butter chicken and some spicy goat thing.

The naan was burned, the chicken pieces were really big and dry. But the sauce was to die for. 

The goat dish that we had was amazing, the meat was very tender and full of flavour.

The service was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Another neighborhood classic, I like this place!  Its takeout only which is too bad as I don't like to get takeout because of all the garbage.  So I've eaten at Saigon Y2K more than is healthy and here only twice.  

I like the butter chicken and lamb korma.  Those are my favorites.  I like both, especially the Korma more than other places I've been in Calgary.  We've had some other lentil and vegetable dishes and they've been good too.  Real naan is a must, yum."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of food in the buffet, friendly service.  The restaraunt is a a bit small maybe 8 tables at the most.  If you happen to be nearby and see there is no line up check it out."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite take-out places in Calgary. I honestly haven't even seen the inside actually so I'm simply rating the food. They are always quick and the food is very tasty, although very mild if you order as is."}
{"text":"Food poisoning warning!!!! We went in here for a sitdown meal but didn't like the atmosphere at all and the tables are squished way too close together, everybody was obviously ease dropping on us and as we are the only Caucasians in the place it was uncomfortable, plus the whole restaurant is just far too small. So instead I sat my kids at a table and asked for a take-out menu and the owner was obviously pissed off that we were just ordering takeout, he's probably worried that we were going to mess up his place setting. I was really surprised by the prices..... I am used to not pay more than $12 for a lunch entrée, but these prices were $16-$19 per entrée and that doesn't even include rice! Rice was three dollars to for $5 per serving additional. +4 dollars for bread! I was planning on ordering one entrée each but at these prices I said forget it so I only ordered butter chicken and lamb vindaloo and rice, and the bill came to $45! It shouldn't cost $45 for 2 lunch entrées. Plus the owner obviously was either very racist against whites or just hates his job and his life, he would barely give me the time of day and was absolutely no help when I asked him where to find things on the menu, just flip it over and slap it briskly with his hands like he was hitting somebody in the face. Absolutely no interest in ever returning here. Also when I got the food home, just like other online reviews have mentioned, hardly any meat at all. Five chunks of chicken in the butter chicken but it's mostly just a load of crap sauce that looks like ketchup. Five small chunks Of lamb in the vindaloo and nothing was as spicy as it should be, all very bland. Quite disappointed.Plus I was sick for 24 hours afterwards and I know it was from the food poisoning because I didn't eat anything else that day. Gross."}
{"text":"Slooooow takeout. Add 20-25 minutes onto whatever time they say the order is going to be ready.   If you're looking for efficient service, order your takeout from the McMahon location and skip the drive to Crowfoot.  Oh, and not even an apology (which could have went a long way)."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised at the extent of the buffet, considering this establishment's small size. I enjoyed the pakuri and the beef very much. The Butter chicken was this (and just about every other) establishment's real attraction, though, and they really delivered with that.

I greatly enjoyed the food. As a buffet, they provide everything I could ever want for lunch, and the naan was excellent and in big enough supply that I could soak up all that great butter chicken sauce.

Prices were fair, and the service ... well ... about as good as can be expected.

I recommend this place if you are hungry and need your Indian food fix (and are in the area). I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Even though we live in the area for many years, we had never visited Green Chili, always just driven by. We wanted to try an authentic Indian restaurant and last weekend we did. Amazing experience, so good that we actually ate there again a few days later.

We tried the combination platter for 15 dollars which is a good deal in itself, but more than anything it gives you the opportunity to experiment with different dishes which is what I want to do.

The first time I ordered the butter chicken and the chicken vindaloo (which was really good but a bit too spicy for me - so if you don't like really hot dishes - skip this one).
The manager saw I was struggling with the heat, so he offered to bring me a different sauce, so I tried the curry - which was just perfect. You get amazing naan bread and tasty rice with the platter, a little serving of salad and dessert. 
The second time I repeated the outstanding butter chicken, but this time my other dish was chicken Tikka Masaala. So, so yummy. Perfect.
The ambiance is nice and classy - the music relaxing and the service outstanding. Definitely highly recommended to connoisseurs of Indian food and persons who want to try something new. We will be back often .

Edit: August 2017. Unfortunately I must report, the food has been rather lacking these days. The chicken in various dishes is tough, I think to cut costs the owners decided to serve old. frozen chicken. No matter how much you marinate/ braise it - the chicken remains tough and not pleasing.
Also the chef has been adding too much salt to the spices. Last time we were there is was simply awful.  The Naan Bread is still yummi, as are the mango lassies.
I hope the administration changes their money saving policy and orders good chicken, so we can return.
Anyway the only reason this place still gets 4 stars if because the manager Shuwik is one of the best in the city. Great customer service and always eager to make patrons feel perfect at this location."}
{"text":"What an interesting concept: An Indian on-line restaurant that delivers Indian fare right to your door. 

I didn't think it could get better than this when I decided to try these guys out over the weekend.

Unfortunately, the idea is a lot better than the food they actually deliver. When the food arrived, it was so greasy that I could barely distinguish one dish from the next.

The food was WAY too greasy and a little too spicy to enjoy. And trust me, if I'm saying it's too spicy, it's because it really IS too spicy.

Greenchili.ca was a one time deal for me. Been there, done that, never again."}
{"text":"5 by 5 all around.

The food is tasty, hot and fresh in the buffet.   Bang for the buck, can't beat the value.   

I enjoyed a lunch buffet with two guys from work who were new to this particular Indian cuisine establishment.   Food was totally a 5 by 5.   Papadams were unique with almost a medium ground corn in the flour and lightly seasoned for an extra pop!

The waiter was great, and I didn't like asking for an extra pitcher of water for the table.   However, it did come promptly.   Prior to that,  fresh Naan appeared at the right moments.   I would give the service a 4 by 5."}
{"text":"We had a quick dinner before golf last week, and were delighted at the quick in, print, courteous service an great food all in one.  Wouldn't hesitate to go for a longer dining experience also."}
{"text":"Been only for lunch buffet , never left disappointed.
Clean, fresh, tasty, good service"}
{"text":"Went here after walking out on Saigon Y2K and their holier than thou attitude. The guy in front was warm and friendly and assured me I would enjoy everything I ordered. I ordered the Jeera Aloo (potato dish) Saffron pulao (rice with saffron) and Naan bread. The Jeera Aloo was a little on the salty side, but balanced with the rice which was slightly bland. The naan was perfectly warm, chewy and crispy. There's better Indian food in Calgary, but all in all it's not bad and the service was a vast improvement from their neighbor! Wish they had seating.

ETA - One hour later: BLAH! I have the worst tummyache after eating the above from this place. And yes, I can def. handle exotic spicy foods. I'm that person that snacks on pickled jalapenos while watching TV and eats salsa full of scotch bonnets without batting an eyelash. TUMMY OF IRON! Do not recommend this place anymore."}
{"text":"I will not recommend this place.  We are very familiar with the Indian foods & flavors. And we been to many Indian/Pakistani restaurants but this one was the worst!
We went there for a Friday lunch buffet.  First, I was surprised to see very few options in buffet and then after trying their foods we didn't go back to the same Dish as none of their foods taste good.  Butter chicken with watery Gravy, so yuck & smelly and also stinky tandoori chicken.  Also no flavors in veg. dishes.  I tried to fill my tummy with their Naans which was over salty but it was hot so not too bad.  
And then the worst part was when we were still there trying to work on our plate and the lady server came up with the bill & machine. And left it on our table until we paid & left.  Hello, we came there hardly just 15-20 min ago & you came with the bill.  
She didn't bother to ask if we were done eating or if we needed anything else.  Almost all empty tables & hardly someone in your restaurant & you wanted to get rid of us too ????  
What a waste of our money & time. And you don't show respect or value to your customers / guests....
People please don't waste your time & money there."}
{"text":"We went on a Monday night and it steady but not packed and still pretty quite. The service was very good. We had vindaloo beef and butter chicken. 
Flavours were good but the chicken was a little dry. Vindaloo was great."}
{"text":"First timers.. wanted it to be a 5 star so that we could come back again and again in the cold winter months to warm up. We love Indian Cuisine.
Observations:
Very tight space - the restaurant was not even full and I felt cramped with a table occupied behind me.
Huge menu - omg, love options but this was overwhelming, all the pages of choices.
Service was friendly but unsure... server needed some confidence.
Table cloth beyond the top glass - dirty. Fine dining the menu states on the front?
Something now and then could be heard beeping. Not good. Fridge? I hope not a microwave.
Ordered chicken Korma, hubs' choice. Too mild for me but ok. Sauce great flavour for as mild as what it was. The chicken needed seasoning but for hubby it was fine. No salt/pepper on tables.
His beer (Kingfisher - their house beer) needed to be served colder.
Garlic Naan very good. As per another reviewer it was greasy but buttery greasy so I loved it. It was so good, I took a second order home with me.
Coconut rice - normal rice with shredded coconut thrown on top? Not what I am used to but this could be their style. Would try a saffron rice next time.
God forbid if anyone orders a blender drink in the restaurant - your convo will be put on hold for a few minutes. LOUD!
All in all, would return for takeout. I hope that my chicken that seemed pre-cooked was not microwaved to heat... the dishes here are far too expensive for that.
For 2 people, you can share a rice dish, order of Naan bread and a meat or veg dish and leave satisfied and not ultra-broke."}
{"text":"It's a decent place, but leaves something to be desired. I get the naan, and it's great tasting, with a nice soft / crisp texture. Dipping that naan into a bowl of butter chicken just oozes satisfaction as far as my palette goes. It's just that they must load the sauce with MSG because I am just BLOATED after one plate plus the naan. I have to really hold back so I can chase down some tapioca dessert, which I typically love, yet I get the feeling it's not made fresh daily? Well, I walk out of there like I'm about to explode! Man-oh-man, if could just get my butter chicken free of MSG, wouldn't I be a happy man!!"}
{"text":"It's suburban wonderland of Indian spice!  

I found my self in the deep north west of Calgary, right in the middle of Crowfoot and it was time to hit up my yelp app to find some appealing takeout. Green Chili, you sound like the place to go! 

 I walked in past the small but nicely laid out table arrangement for the eat-in folk and inquired about their take-out options. For the most part, their take-out takes about half an hour but they would be able to wrangle me up some butter chicken, rice and naan in 15-20. Awesome! Let's do it!  5 - 10 minutes later I had my food. Way to go, Green Chili!

The rice was coloured with bits of yellow and orange.. I don't really know what this is all about. It all tasted like rice to me, but hey, it looks kind cool!

The butter chicken has a nice, mild touch of spice to it and it good and rich. I found the chicken pieces were maybe a little on the dry side, but there's more than enough sauce to dip it in.

All in all, Green Chili was an unexpected suburban delight!"}
{"text":"The good. The food is great just like all of the cites Green Chilis. 
The bad. The service is extremely poor. From entering the door to getting our food, bearing in mind we ordered straight away was about 1 hour. 
There was only one other couple in the restaurant at the time so it wasn't an occupancy issue!
Upon paying with my visa I noticed that the POS machine displayed my visas pin number in clear text so I cancelled it immediately. Definitely something fishy going on, and I see that someone else had their card skimmed there."}
{"text":"Food is good but they can be stingy on the Goat curry dish. The goat tray in the buffet was just sauce with a few minuscule pieces of meat. We asked if they could bring out more goat and they did, but only a tiny amount. There was butter chicken and tandoori chicken, but goat was the reason I chose the restaurant and I left disappointed."}
{"text":"A bit more expensive than their neighbour(New Dynasty), but delicious all the same.  Green Chili serves the best mango lassis in the NW, creamy but not too sweet.    We always go for the Sunday lunch buffet and there's a good selection of salads, mains and sweets along with a side of naan.  The basmati rice is served in a large rice cooker on one side of the buffet table.  Buffet items include pappadums, garden salad, daal, pakoras, tandoori chicken, butter chicken, beef curry, goat curry(my favorite!), and gulab jaman.  Nom, nom....  I have dreams about their goat curry--meltingly tender morsels in a wonderfully spiced sauce, accented with chopped coriander.
Naan is a bit greasy, though.
     We've always eaten in, so we can't comment on the quality/efficiency of the takeout."}
{"text":"We were jus googling the Indian cuisine restaurants in calgary and got to find this place and gave a try. That was on friday evening. Not much crowd. And nt many servers. Only two for the whole place.Of course that's nt a big place too. I dont think it can accomodate a big crowd. Ambience was good with a tv and dim lighting.
There was a mini bar too in it.
The cutlery and plates were clean and neat. I have seen many ppl were coming in to carry out their food ordered from the restaurant.

Food was good. But compared with the typical indian food, it wasn't that great. Overall tasted good. 

Fish pakora that we ordered was a way over the expectation and tasted good. 

Even though we mentioned it to make it more spicy, we didn't get the desired spice in it.

Prices were reasonable and worth food."}
{"text":"Like Indian, but tired of all those top-of-the-line types? You know the ones: wow you with their Roganjosh, hit you with that Garlic Naan, kick that Vindaloo to 11?

Look no further, this is NOT one of those places.

About as average as Indian food gets. Meat was dry, spices were moderate, interior was clean, and staff were pleasant.

It's Indian food for people who would definitely probably maybe hate going to India.

THREE STARZ."}
{"text":"Greasy, overpriced food that was cold on arrival. The garlic naan was made with chunks of garlic that put a bad taste in your mouth. Poor quality malai kofta with not a lot of kofta and too much pale, greasy sauce."}
{"text":"A - List. Highly Recommended. Wow! This place is tiny and somewhat off the beaten path. But once inside the aromas of awesomeness will captivate you. I was greeted with a big smile and very prompt service. The butter chicken and korma were excellent. I hear the safron is out of this world. The bill for 2 for 2 main dishes, side rice and 2 orders of bread came to $36. If you are looking for small business perfection, here it is! One of the best kept secrets in the NW."}
{"text":"A-List. Excellent food, solid service. These guys know how to cook. Worth the walk or drive."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the modest exterior, once you get into the restaurant it is spacious and modern, with some excellent friendly service. Went for the lunch buffet, while the number and types of items in the buffet are fairly standard, the quality was excellent. And the fresh made garlic naan we were served was some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Vegetable pakora and Palak Paneer (spinach with paneer cheese) both had a strange raw curry spice taste. My dining companion commented on the dryness of the pakoras, wondering if they were reheated buffet leftovers. The service was freindly but, even though we were the only customers, inattentive. The waiter amused himself at the bar, chatting with visitors and using his cellphone, oblivious to our attempts to catch his attention so we could pay and leave."}
{"text":"I had the occasion to dine here last weds for the dinner opening.
The outside of this place in a divey strip mall indicated it was not much, boy was I wrong! 
Let me start by saying the INSIDE was spotless, and tastefully decorated. The customer service was excellent also. Now the food:

Delightful with a capital D. Let me provide a list of our tasties we split between the two of us, with leftovers to take home:

Aloo Nan,
AlooGoobi (excuse the spelling)
Butter Chicken,
Coconut Rice.

Very nicely done. I will be back to try their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"The buffet has grown in variety since we were here last, with goat curry among the recent additions. Liked the vegetable pakora, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, and lamb tikka masala. The naan is a bit on the oily side, but it tastes good. Dessert includes gulab jamun, and their mango lassi is among the best in Calgary."}
{"text":"Much better than I expected going in.  Afghani Paneer Tikka was excellent!  Dal, saag paneer and koftas were spot on.  The nan was standout!  Place was dead on a Sunday evening though...Prices were a bit high I thought though..."}
{"text":"Zero stars !!!!! Tried to go here twice over the last 2 years sat in restaraunt for 2p mins both times no service ...... Decided to get take out today ........ Was 90$ for like 4 things and they forgot rice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Who the f forgets rice in Indian food !!!! Then called oh come pick I it up ....,..... F that !!!!!!! This place has sucked for 2 years !!!!! Bad reviews from now on !!!!! Get bent you guys suck !!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been to almost all of the downtown Indian restaurants.  Each one has their own specialty but none of them are \"the best\".  We tried Green Chili one evening and were delightfully surprised.  

We ordered the standard Butter Chicken but also picked up the Shahi Paneer which is a cheese type of dish. It was so flavorful and the portions were great for next day left overs.  The rice and naan were both fresh.  The best part was the price.  Green Chili came in much less than other Indian places.

Green Chili has become a staple of our Indian take out.  The service is friendly, efficient, and there is lots of parking in the back."}
{"text":"Well.  

First, it's rare to have any restaurant under new management to show concern and attempt to reach out to an existing customer base to ask for another chance. 

Let me say that in every way this newly managed Green Chili restaurant deserves a 5 STAR rating!

Food - fresh with incredible flavour.  Better than before...wait...no...WAY better than before. 

Service - Honest and sincere with a genuine desire to satisfy the customer.  Rajesh, great job man.  

Favorite dishes - order the Dal Makhani (lentil dish)...just do it and thank me later.  Aloo Gobi is great.  Chicken Tikka Masala has the perfect blend of heat and is a favorite.  Every dish we ordered was exceptional. 

Overall, if you live in Walden or anywhere in the south give them a try.  There are some very well known Indian restaurants in the south (M.M) but all of my guests and friends tonight agree...the food here is actually better.  The wait times are reasonable.  The service is reminiscent of a family friend welcoming you inside their home. 

5 STARS."}
{"text":"Last night was the 2nd time I have ordered take out from Green Chili, and I have to admit I'm a big fan!! The butter chicken was out of this world good, and I really love the veggie samosas. We've also ordered the Aloo Ghobi and the Beef Korma, everything is always delicious. Our food was ready in 35 minutes and my only complaint is that it's a bit expensive. You get a lot of food for your money though, so if we have enough for lunch the next day, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Stopped by the one in Nolan Hill and our food is was delicious! The butter chicken is just spicy enough, and the coconut rice is fresh and simple!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm. Green chili left a bad taste in my mouth recently. Bad chili. 

Lazy night in with my boyfriend and as per usual we caved and choose delivery. I placed the order for all our regular favourites. I've been using the iPhone app since I found out about it, and it usually works great, it keeps your address and payment information on file and automatically pays for the order. I submitted everything, was charged, and received my confirmation email indicating I would receive my order within an hour. 

An hour and 40 minutes later a very grouchy delivery man arrived demanding a delivery fee of $6 to be paid. OK- I have no problem paying this fee, but why so angry at me? I simply placed an order for delivery via an online app provided , and it's not my fault if it didn't include a delivery charge. After paying him he handed me the bag and marched off. Upon getting inside I noticed we were missing our 2 orders of rice, and missing our requested pops. 

We immediately called them to let them know of the error, and whom ever was working literally argued with us for 15 minutes saying we never ordered those items, and we were sent the correct order. I told him I had an online order confirmation, an online receipt, and a paper receipt in front of me, so I am sure he could see what I had ordered but for some reason he was refusing to acknowledge that they made a mistake, and was unwilling to correct it. Finally I asked him to then break down my order of how we arrived at the total of $60, when he was forced to admit my items were missed. 

You would think a normal reaction as a business would be apologetic, maybe toss in a free appetizer or 10% off next time coupon. No, no, he then starts telling me that if we want the rice we need to come pick it up ourselves. After arguing with him for another 5 minutes about paying a delivery charge, the order being super late, the fact that it was their error the whole time to begin with, and the fact that I was charged for something they did not give me, he gave in and said they would deliver the items.
  
What gives green chili? Why the fight over some rice and pop? I think rice is kind of a staple when eating Indian food, soooooo......

I don't know if I'll order from here again to be honest, I was made to feel in the wrong when I wasn't. I love their food don't get me wrong, but you cant treat people like that."}
{"text":"I have ordered take out several times on my way home from work. This is a small place but in a great location by M&M and Cobbs Bakery.  Food is tasty and flavourful but they have got my order for coconut rice wrong a few times. When I called to mention it they said sorry but didn't offer to fix it the next time I returned. Bring fair, thought they were having an off day. Next time I went to pickup and mentioned the mix up, they brushed me off and said that what's listed on the receipt is what will be in the bag.  Trusting this, I went home only to find no coconut rice again even though I paid for it.  I'm fairly easy going but this peeves me off as I've been let down twice. 

My usual items here are muttar paneer, aloo gobi, butter chicken and garlic naan. I love the daal- yellow lentils- could drink it like soup that warms my heart. Sadly, I  noticed a steady decline in taste, texture and quality over the past few times. Once, it wasn't even hot and tasted like it was reheated from a giant batch made a few days prior. 

I really wanted to continue liking this place more than the score I provided but they've lost my business. Service is important!!! You can't get by on food taste alone."}
{"text":"I live a block from this Green Chili location and make it in for the lunch buffet two or three times a month. I can't speak to dinner service since I've never eaten dinner there, but for lunch, it's become what I consider to be the best buffet in town.

What sets Green Chili off from the competition (and that means the also very good Moti Mahal across the street) is the variety and novelty of items on the buffet. At, for example, Surya, the buffet is exactly the same every day. At Green Chili it NEVER is and almost every time I have eaten there- and I've been dozens of times- I get to taste something entirely new. Today was especially amazing. They had their Chicken Kadai on the buffet, which is rich and hot, they had a preparation of potatoes and cabbage that was outstanding and that I'd never seen before, and they had something called Kadi Punjabi, which is not on the menu (that's another amazing thing: the buffet has things not on the dinner menu) and which was a sort of stuffed veggie dumpling in a delicious, creamy sauce. Other days I've had and enjoyed a fish curry, goat curry, superb aloo gobi, Hakka chili chicken, a spicy fruit salad (you have to experience it to understand it) and lots of varied items. It's always a surprise at Green Chili and best of all, every thing is absolutely delicious. Including the ample, complimentary naan.

Add to all this- the only Indian resto I've seen in Calgary that regularly has ras malai on the buffet for dessert."}
{"text":"Ate here when it first opened. Seems the quality was saved for month one.
$14 for butter chicken, five pieces and a tin tub of sauce. $7 for rice. 
Food is tasty, but how hard is it to screw up sauce?
It's highly doubtful we will return. Snack sized portions just don't cut it for this price..."}
{"text":"So. We found ourselves in Calgary for a conference. After 3000 miles of flying, we wanted something local, spiritd, but unfussy. We stopped in to a number of small local restauraunts, but when we went in to Green Chili, the rich mix of aromas said \"This is the place.\"

It IS Indian take out. There are no hovering waiters. Just the heavenly spice smells, flashes of fire from the stove behind the kitchen door, a cheery cashier to take your order, and perhaps a hundred choices.

We ordered naan, vegetable pakora apetizer, goat curry, and palak paneer.

It's 4 star because - take out. Sorry. Would I go back? Try to stop me!

Naan: hot and plenty.
Vegetable pakora: basically Indian tempura, each ball was a harmonious mix of bold flavors, including the namesake green chili.
Goat curry: BIG tender chunks of meat in a sauce that would be enough on its own
Palak paneer: A brilliant green bowl of rich flavors, not a hint of the dreaded gray soup most restauraunts settle for."}
{"text":"I'd love to be able to rate their food but we never made it that far!

Wow, I'm a fairly tolerant person but the experience with the Crowfoot Green Chili pushed me over the edge.  

I called in an order for delivery and was told to expect the food in just over an hour.  Not sure why it would take that long to prepare and make the five minute drive but none the less.  Five minutes after the original call I redialed to make a slight change and add a few items.  The first thing the person who answered said was \"I don't have your order, you must have called the Crowchild location\".  Like I just said, I REDIALED my phone which I tried to explain to him.  He insisted he didn't have my order and it must have been another store.  To humor him I called the Crowchild store and of course they didn't have my order.  I called back to Crowfoot and after being abundantly clear about  my name and address he started yelling that he didn't have my order.  Fine, not a problem.  Don't want my business I'll go elsewhere.  But to insure that I don't have someone showing up at my door with food an hour later I make one last attempt to confirm he had the order so I could cancel it.  Now he finally listens and comprehends that its a delivery order, and goes on to ask if I want to still add the items!!  WTH???  You've just yelled at me, told me I don't know who I called and still expect me to order??  Sorry but I think not!

Honestly couldn't care if they have the best Indian food in Calgary I will NEVER patronize them again."}
{"text":"I was having a craving for butter chicken and thought I'd try this place out as it was very convenient on the way home from work.
The location itself is hard to get to if you are travelling westbound on Bow Trail.  You sort of have to pull a U-Turn to get into the plaza.  Additionally the restaurant isn't large and has a buffet in it.  When I arrived there were several bags of take-out which I assume means they were a popular take-out/delivery place.  
I had also ordered some appetizers and naan bread.  The food was ready when I arrived and the service for payment was quick and efficient.  Service with a smile.
When I got home, I was quite disappointed in the size of the portion of butter chicken.  I also felt the flavourings were just \"blah\".  The chicken was dry and not flavourful at all.  The appetizers were quite nice but it's deep fried!  Everything tastes good deep fried!
Sadly, I will not return."}

{"text":"Had to change my review due to the last several orders being disappointing. I do believe they are under new management and that might explain things...

My husband and I loved this place. We ordered at least once a month for the past 2 years. We always got our favs: veggie samosas, butter or korma chicken, various vindaloo dishes and cheese naan. They seemed to have changed their recipes and not for the better (cheese naan is no longer cheesy! whaaaat!?). The prices also went up and they got rid of their free delivery over $50. I no longer feel the food is worth the $60 it costs to get this to my door. That being said, their lunch buffet is still a killer deal and good food and the only way I'll be enjoying Green Chili from now on."}
{"text":"I ordered take out and it arrived within the time they told me it would be there. The delivery guy has cheerful and friendly and the food was awesome! I ordered enough for leftovers and it was all still very good for the following night! I now have a Indian takeout close to home!"}
{"text":"This is a takeout ONLY restaurant just so you know.

2 chicken dishes, bread, pakoras, and rice came to $50 !!! And their interac pay terminal is set up to harass you for a tip !!! Sorry, I'm not tipping when its PICKUP and  exorbitantly priced!!

The food itself was AVERAGE. The dishes, in my opinion, were spiced properly, however all were too oily, and the chicken dishes had literally about 7 chunks of gumball sized chicken ---  for $13 ?!?!?!?

I just cant recommend this place mainly because of the prices, and the only average food."}
{"text":"What happened Green Chili??? Why have you done this to me? I feel like I have been spat on by a friend.

It's been awhile, I know that, but, why have you decided to go total mediocre on me?
Your service is slow, the last few times we ordered take out from you, we both felt awful afterwards, so this time we ordered hoping that you wouldn't poison us.

No poison this time, but the food has just lost all oomph. Everything was bland from the samosa to my navrattan korma, where you were really skimping out on the main part of it. The vegetables. It was like a mixed bag of corn and peas with one sliced mushroom and one cube of cheese that you diced into sparrow size pieces and smothered in the sauce in hopes I wouldn't notice.

It was also pretty dead in your dining area when I went to pick up my order. I think people are catching on."}
