{"text":"Fantastic fusion food. Their sushi is spot on: not just the regular sushis you find, but a nice variety all freshly made. Their Thai steak is also delicious, you have to try it."}
{"text":"We visited from out of town and ate here on two occasions.  One time we had their grilled salmon, which was tender and delicious.  We also had their Asian style chicken and two salads.  All was fresh, tasty, and well worth the prices.  The service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Worst service ever in the area.
Food is terrible.
Certainly wont last in this neighborhood.
Need bilingual staff and hostess...and smiles would t hurt either
Just a waste."}

{"text":"Good food and ambiance. However when the bill comes beware... There is an 18% tip included, wether you like it or not & TVS/TVQ on the sum that includes the tip. Ask yourself: is that legal?"}
{"text":"Tomahawk steak was delicious, well seasoned and prepared correctly. Tuna tartare was presented beautifully. Enjoyed the outdoor seating. Staff was very accommodating. Service was attentive. Enjoyed dipping sauces that accompanied the steak."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by one of my colleague but she warned me that people their are not very comfortable with seeing people from other ethnic group!! . I went there anyway and I think the food was amazing, the service was excellent but the customers their made me feel really uncomfortable and they kept starring at us from the moment that we entered the restaurant until we left and I think it was because we looked different and we were the only men who were not wearing kipa.I will recommend to order for take away before you arrive if you don't want to have the experience that we had."}

{"text":"The food is very good, the service is great. 
But they don't take AMEX (American Express) so for business meetings it was a hiccup."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Malaysian chicken, tender,  with a  tasty sauce.
I wish they would get rid of the music, or at least lower the volume."}
{"text":"Chops is a kosher resto located not far from snowdon metro. It's easy to find parking. Because it's certified kosher don't expect it to be open on a Friday night and Saturday night schedule does change depending on the season. The place has lots of sections which I find practical for special occasions. The down stairs is surrounded with good TV sets and music is not loud. The staff is super friendly and I recommend asking them for there opinion on what to order. I personally don't recommend sushi on a sat night since they don't accept deliveries on Saturdays. 
I don't agree on the ethnic comment. I've seen people of all ethnicities and with or without kippas (head cover). Everyone one is welcome there. I agree that there is a larger concentration of religious Jews but what do you expect when you have a handful of kosher restaurants in a city this large. 

I've been here several times for special events and find the price point a bit high but kosher meat is usually a bit more of expensive. Usually I would take the Krispy beaf. Flavours are nice, not spicy and quantity generous. Some people ordered the plate of pasta and complained of lack of flavour. Others found the grilled steak very good. 
This time I talking to some people and discovered there is a burger that's not on the menu. I orders it! Ask for the price because u shouldn't expect it to be cheap and for good reason. This burger is huge, stuffed with all kinds of flavours. A nice touch was the slice of roast beaf it added a smokey taste it.  I also asked for spicy spice on the side to add a bit of a kick. This burger was dripping and oozing so dry it's not!  The fries are an excellent choice but I had mine replaced with a salad, a great portion. It wasn't over seasoned or soggy. 
If you have room for desert just remember that it's a kosher meat resto so don't expect to find dairy items on the menu. If ur lactose intolerant then ur at the right place. Even the \"milk\" for ur coffee is non dairy. This is commonly found in kosher meat restaurants."}
{"text":"Surprenant, on ne s'attend pas sur ce coin de rue à trouver un restaurant de cette qualité exceptionnelle. Le steak était spectaculaire et savoureux."}
{"text":"We came for Chinese not steaks.  Wonton soup was a \"10\". Good broth and as good a wonton as I've ever had w ground chicken. Healthy portion w four wontons. 

Spring rolls were a \"5\", average. 

Malaysian chicken was a \"9\".  Incredibly tender w excellent flavor. Only negative was appearance as the sauce seemed to congeal a bit when I was done. 

Orange beef was very good, although I would prefer a little less breaking.  

Chicken fried rice was excellent.  Didn't have dessert.  Service was good."}
{"text":"I actually enjoyed my food. So if I come back I would get the exact same thing. 
Appetizer was the Sushi salad with only tuna. Main meal was the tuna tartar and the dynamite maki with only tuna. And to drink I got the strawberry shortcake martini with no cream. 
My hubby got some other maki rolls and said he didn't really like them. 
A big negative about this restaurant is that it is very overpriced for what you get.
There is also an 18% service charge included on your bill.
It is a kosher restaurant."}
