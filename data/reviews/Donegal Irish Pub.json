{"text":"Do not try the Gas lamp Schooners terrible beer! opt for the Molson tastes better and only a few bucks more but worth it on Mondays.  The staff is always an issue here. My bro and I went on Monday for wings Our server was great. Came last night with a friend just to chat and have a drink. I thought our server died. Like seriously we wanted to leave for like a good half an hour and had no idea where she was.   The girl I had on Monday was awesome I missed her name though. She helped me prank my brother she was awesome and soooo good. Staff also seemed happier on Monday. Might be all this rain though."}
{"text":"I love this Irish pub, the staff are always friendly, they have TV's everywhere so you can watch your sport, and Strongbow on tap! I have tried to eat here 3 times, and 3 times I had a problem with my food that was supported by the staff. Even the manager came out and talked with me and took care of a few items but like everywhere in Calgary they have growing pains too. I still love the place but for the meantime I eat at home and drink there :)"}
{"text":"In the past month food has gone down hill!! The fries suck/ they won't cook and come out raw. Tonight was the worst a 3 inch hair in my burger.  Yuck and f'n groose. Have you noticed that I have 78 check ins. I  know what I'm talking about. The food is really hit and miss"}
{"text":"I have visited this establishment 3 times now and I must say - this place is almost worth going to just to see how bad the service is. It is that bad. On my last trip, I enjoyed a delightful 40 minute wait for 1 bottle of beer.  What takes so long to get a bottle of beer? Does the bartender make the waitresses blow him every time they go back with a drink order? The staff have been consistently rude and downright incompetent. It is such a shame - this is such a nice place, one of the best looking irish pubs that calgary has to offer. It's a great though if you're looking for a quiet place to go to though, there is virtually nobody in here every time I have went. ( I wonder why). I give this place another year before they file bankruptcy."}
{"text":"Recently went here in the middle of the week and was pleasantly surprised. While the menu is the same as Kilkenny/Seanacie (sp?), their wings came out fast and hot, and for really cheap. Our server was not too attentive and they didn't accept debit but all the staff was friendly. They seemed to know all the regulars by first name.  Regular menu was alright but the wings were good!"}
{"text":"Came here for $5.00 burger night. Can't beat the price. The food was ok. Would have been better if the bacon in my burger wasn't burnt plus the service was spotty. We had a new waitress. She was super sweet but messed up our drink order and was slow to serve us our drinks, dinner and receipt. The manager brought over a free drink for us to make up for it. Not bad but not great. Probably wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Well,  I tried it again. Not sure why.   Their beer is overpriced, even the house beer is 6$ a pint. Reg domestic is all $7 which seems high, considering many places offer their house for $4 and domestic for $5-6. But besides that, the staff is rude.  Friends arrived 35mins before a football game, and asked to have the tv changed. When we arrived, 10 minutes later, it still hadn't been, (there was a ceremony prior and we wanted to watch) and asked again. Eventually, it was 10 minutes after the game had started, and we asked for the manager, 5 minutes later, she changed the channel and didn't even apologize for the 50minute wait to get the tv changed. She shouted across the restaurant \"YOU'RE WELCOME\" in a snotty attitude. They put it on an awful feed which would cut in and out because they couldn't put it on HD because of the \"people watching the Oilers game\". But they couldn't explain this to us until hal time. She promised to do it at the Oilers game (1min left and down 5-2) but then waited another 20minutes.  So yes, it was very frustrating.   I can assure you I will NOT be returning, if they want repeat customers they have to give them respect. It wouldn't be so hard to come over and apologize, maybe buy us a round? after all we did wait 50 MINUTES and 5 requests to get the channel changed. But instead we stayed, drank, and had a $200 bill.  They won't be getting my business any more."}
{"text":"Don't bother, sub-par food, took an hour and fifteen for our wings, managers don't care."}
{"text":"I have never had worse service in my life!!! Our server was so rude it was painful, everyone at our table was friendly and she was such a b*#ch to our entire group the whole time. I am constantly traveling for work and eating out everywhere and this is the first time in my life I have not tipped my server."}
{"text":"Donegal is the best pub in YYC. They have the best daily specials - you cannot beat a $5 fully-loaded gourmet pub burger anywhere. The staff are phenomenal, Friendly and efficient. Colin, Gail, Jordy, Meighen  and Kelly are the best bar staff anywhere. You cannot go wrong here. Amazing people, great atmosphere, it's like Cheers."}
{"text":"Had the chicken pot pie it was amazing and 25c a oz house beer was great my beer cost less than my wife's diet pop she wasn't to impressed with that but the steak sandwich she had was really good she told me good service as well"}
{"text":"I really did give this place a chance. Three in fact. Service there was abominable. The first time, I ordered a drink but they didn't have or were even aware of what Drambuie was. Pretty common alcohol .  The second time I ordered food, it took a long time getting to us and it was very sub par.  The third time I went in late, around 1am, with 1 friend, and we ordered 2 beers (Canadian). Nobody else was there. We waited somewhere around 30 minutes for the beer. ...Ya that was the last straw. I never went back and don't plan to.  Although, I am a fair man, to it's benefit, they do have 1 cent dry ribs that are completely worth going for. Just don't order anything else and hope the ribs come within the hour..."}
{"text":"After a long day where nothing was going as planned I stumbled upon this gem of a place and I'm so happy I did. Great staff that made 3hrs fly by in a blink of an eye :)"}
{"text":"I am used to the quality food at Kilkenny, so recently wanted to try this 'sister' pub in the group. We were a group of five, two had the Thurs.night special, steak both ordered medium but received very well done and tough. I was expecting a quality Caesar salad and received a very dry Caesar with few ingredients.  Also I ordered a cranberry juice which was so watered down that it was basically coloured water. The staff was good enough to explain that it was 'on tap' and they couldn't do anything about it. I changed my order to a coke. Soft drinks are expensive here.  One of our group enjoyed the wings. Having other good choices along 17th Ave, three out of five of us would not return."}
{"text":"Decent pub food, and part of the \"Calgary Best Pubs\" chain. I think they are a chain as there are 5 or 6  irish pubs with different names but the same menus. Limericks Kilkeny, Dixons.   Anyways, what does it for me with this place and why others seem to enjoy it is the staff are generally friendly and welcoming. Like a bar where everyone knows your name.   Wing nights are decent (25 Cent mondays), Wednesdays its a pound of wings for 6.50, and a bacon burger with fries for 6.50 (Can you get that at wendy's across the street, with a beer order no less?)"}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Started waiting for 30 mins just to get a glass of water. Followed by another 20mins just to get a beer. Followed by the waitress bring my food and dumping it all over my table..... worst worst worst....."}
{"text":"Music is way too loud and tv in the booth was kind of odd. Nevertheless, good service and you can't go wrong with $0.09 wings!"}
{"text":"One thing to cheap in mind before going here is why you are going here. Obviously going on a Monday night means you are going for the cheap wings. My co-workers and I go there often and have always had a good time. The servers, expect one a while ago, are friendly and pretty quick. It helps that we go around 11pm when they have slowed down a fair bit.   The wings are small but also very cheap. Last night I put back 50 wings with ease and enjoyed all of the flavour selections. Personal recommendation is sweet chili or honey garlic. I would caution anyone away from \"Spuds skin\" pizza! That is the worst pizza I have ever eaten, they use mashed potato as the sauce.   The servers are also not enforcing the drink/wing ratio at all which is nice, who wants to get drunk when the focus is on wings? The place is loud but has a lot of TV's so I will not be bringing a date there anytime soon.   Oh and last note, I used the washroom for the first time there last night, something I try to avoid in pubs, and it was spotless and smelt so clean, very impressed."}
{"text":"Average pub experience with plenty of room for friends.  I went to Donegal's pretty late on a Thursday night. The place was quite empty so we managed to get a spot on the patio. I opted for one of the gas lamp beers and was pleasantly surprised by the taste. I didn't try any of the food, so I'll have to update if I go back. I saw the deal for the breakfast advertised, so I might give that a go. The menu itself had items you would expect and seemed a little overpriced.  It's your normal pub without anything too special."}
{"text":"Went here for wing night last night and our service was terrible. Had to wait 10 mins to finally be greeted by our server, by that time we were ready to order our wings and drinks. When the server finally came over we told her we wanted to order wings too she said \"there will be plenty of time for that later lets just start with drinks\". So we ordered our drinks and had to grab her before she ran off to get our wing order in too. We waited another 15 mins before our drinks finally came and over 45 mins before our wings finally came. She did not come by once in that period to advise us \"the kitchen was slammed\" I had to be told this by another server when I went up to the bar to find out what was taking so long. Either way, wings should be fast on wing night as kitchens should be well prepared to cook large quantities of wings. We finally got our food and wanted more wings and beer, another 15 mins went by before finally getting our beers and we told the server not to bother with our 2nd order of wings. Not once did a manager come by for an apology or an explanation nor did the server care enough to keep us informed. Will not be returning to this pub as they do not have any care for customer service."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere as for a GF meal.... It's difficult and requires some work. There is no GF menu and nothing labeled on the menu as Gluten Friendly. You can order wings but they are blanched ahead of time. So it requires a call a day before hand and they will leave some out and bake them. Super nice to offer to do this.... Also, be wary of the onion, they cook/marinade them in beer, which isn't mentioned on the menu. I ordered lettuce wrap, Sans peanut sauce and hose sauce with a side of ranch and added chicken. Was delicious, however it was $20 and I was still starving. The manager was super helpful, but really wish they could make this an easier place to order from."}
{"text":"Their fish tacos were advertised as 'lightly seasoned basa fillets' and were actually so deep fried that I could barely find the fish in them. The avocado mango salsa was great and these could have been way better if the fish was actually fish. Other than that the service was fine but I think the beer is over priced."}
{"text":"It is a chain pub, standard large Irish deal. Often go here for breakfast (they have a $5 weekend breakfast deal) the food is okay, good for the price. The service is sometimes a bit spotty."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go for beers. I have been here twice now and the staff is always friendly and checking to see if your drink is topped up. They are quite friendly and overall it's a great place to go.  The interior of the place is really neat. I haven't tried the food yet but I will the next time I go. I'm hoping they get Beamish beer in because I hear it's an amazing Irish stout fitting for the place."}
{"text":"Donegal Irish Pub has made the best of an unbearable situation: being smack in the middle of the torturous C-Train construction zone, their business must be suffering. Solution: 1 cent wings. That's right. Each wing is worth one cent. The kicker to this near-free promotion: sky-high beer prices. Granted, its only two or three dollars extra, but when they have a wings-for-drinks policy (enforced to a T by the apathetic staff), the savings on wings quickly turns just as expensive as a regular pub that it doesn't take three hours to get into during heightened traffic. Not to mention that one cent gets you pretty mediocre wings."}
{"text":"Heard about the reasonable breakfasts on the weekends. Bacon and Eggs, eggs Benny - bring it on PLEASE, for only $5.99. So, we went to check out this great price and were pleasantly surprised.  Food was piping and I mean PIPING HOT and brought out by the Chef himself (it wasn't busy). Well, I did try the Eggs benedict ,eggs done just right , medium, bearnaise sauce was tasty and homemade hashbrown's that were awesome!!. The Hubby had his usual , Bacon and Eggs (with sausage) said I had to taste the sausage, it was very good!!  The highlight of our visit was the server (can't remember her name, sorry..) but she was really from Ireland and was telling us how people ask if she is really Irish or just putting on...so I told her 'Say yes, I'm putting you on'' as an inside joke. She was super fast, friendly and checked with us lots on how everything was. Loved her and wanted to bring her home in my pocket :) Overall, we'll go back for those breakie's for sure. Gotta love Piping Hot :)"}
