{"text":"Such a cool spot in such a random area. Awesome decor, cool bartenders, and good beer. Plus, good music when we were there. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I could have sat at this bar all night simply for their choice in music.  Yeah yeah yeahs... Spoon... Imagine dragons...   Just a cute little bar within walking distance to our hotel."}
{"text":"some call it \"home base.\" others say \"all roads lead to map room...\" anyone living in the warehouse appreciates these truisms.  you'll always see folks you know, and you'll escape the folks (on west 6th) you don't wanna know.  closing time is especially fruitful, or so i hear ;)  it's great during the day too, to grab food, watch a game, or chill on the patio day-drinking in summer.  the pizza really is the hidden gem."}
{"text":"I don't feel like my previous review is unfair.  I'm still ticked about the fact that a bartender added extra money into their tip, but whatever.    But to say they wouldn't get my business again is lie.  I love their pizza.  I order it, pick it up, and make sure the tip line and total line are clear and can't be forged into different numbers.    The pizza brought me back.  I will always be cautious though."}
{"text":"\"I really liked the food,\" my daughter said when I asked her to rate the map room.  \"The pizza is tasty and has interesting toppings (like meatballs.  We definitely have to come back\"  The service was great.  The range of beers on tap is laudable....a darn good dive bar!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, good prices, good atmosphere. Just moved downtown, and I can definitely say I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I am from Cleveland and really miss the Map Room, especially Dina, she is the best! The manager Reggie is also a cool dude. Any bar that has awesome pizza and lets dogs hang out is cool with me.  Dont go to map room chicago though, different owners and the worst place EVER."}
{"text":"Pizza is good here, but it is almost impossible to get a drink. The bartenders spend more time socializing with each other than they do serving customers.  I try to avoid this place for that reason alone."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great service and fun atmosphere! Definitely would recommend to all my friends!"}
{"text":"A bit of a dive bar, but fun for what it is. Loud music, good beer selection and casual crowd. Feels slightly like a college bar. Limited food selection, so if you come hungry, make sure you're drunk."}
{"text":"Used to love getting food from here since they're right next to work. The prices are okay and they give great portions..well, GAVE great portions. In the last two weeks, they've shrunk considerably. Same prices, smaller portions, and the new portions are not upped in quality. Loved you guys, but I don't like getting ripped off."}
{"text":"I've heard of Map Room many, many times.  But being the proud Clevelander I am, I never knew exactly where it was.  This is coming from someone who drives down W. 9th EVERY DAY on my way to work.  I just assumed it was somewhere on the west side, and I'd find it eventually.  Little did I know, I would get to experience this hidden gem sooner than later.  Through the suggestion of my group of friends, we stopped in to watch the Browns home opener last weekend (following a successful first tailgate at the Muni Lot, I might add).  I felt like I was finally admitted into the super-secret Map Room club.  Many thanks to my friend Gar for showing me the light.  We sat in the dark bar, watching the Browns, eating pizza and enjoying some beverages.  Our entire group of six was able to sit (together, too!) and we weren't approached by the usual douches and chotches that typically frequent downtown establishments, especially during a major sporting event.  The service was good, the atmosphere was great and I was able to actually enjoy the company of my friends, instead of merely staring at them or screaming at each other in order to communicate.    After such an amazing first experience, the likelihood of my returning to Map Room is about as sure as the Browns starting the season 0-3."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, great pizza. Definitely one of the best places downtown for a slice or four."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in Cleveland, located directly across the street from my apartment building. It truly has a neighborhood bar feel, where everyone knows your name...and your drink! The bar has lots of dark wood and maps covering the walls, hence the name. If you are coherent enough to appreciate the decor, you will notice the sporadically placed English telephone booth, motorcycle, and airplanes hanging from the ceilings. While I am not a big pizza fan, all of my friends swear by their recipe. It is supposedly the best in Cleveland, deriving from the pizza served at a nearby restaurant in Little Italy.  If you are looking to escape the over-hyped, overcrowded, and overly trashy scene on West 6th, head one block over to West 9th and find comfort in the laid back scene at The Map!"}
{"text":"Went by last night to catch the end of the cavs game. It wasn't too busy on a Monday night. The bartender was chill. Got us drinks and food promptly and made some jokes. It was a nice experience. I will be sure to come back more of them when he is working.   The cheese bread is the best thing ever. Please don't ever change the recipe because nobody does it like you. Also, thanks for having blue moon on draft."}
{"text":"The Map Room is a great little place on West 9th street. You get a good crowd of young business professionals with good prices. The TV setup is good, as we normally  come here after the Browns games. The pizza is probably my favorite downtown. I'm a huge Angelo's fan in Lakewood, but when downtown I try and pick one up here. They have a great selection on beers and the place is just a cool atmosphere. Check it out."}
{"text":"If you're staying in downtown Cleveland, your pizza options are limited. Vincenza's closes at 6:30p (I guess Clevelandars don't eat pizza for dinner). With Crust, you're guaranteed at least an hour plus wait. Most of the other places don't do delivery. Those that do deliver, have awful reviews. Gillespie's was a short walk from the Renaissance hotel. Awesome BBQ chicken pizza. Cheesy bread, extra cheesy. Salad, nothing to write home about. But, this is a bar that makes great pizza, why would you (or why did I for that matter) order a salad? Never mind, it doesn't matter. What does matter is that Gillespie's makes some tasty pizza. Go get you some."}
{"text":"Delicious food & great prices! I ordered a large Stromboli & large deluxe pizza around $25. I called in order and picked up. Ready in about a 1/2 hour."}
{"text":"I really can't decide whether to go with 2 stars or 3, because it's really borderline.  Map Room is just OK.  An unenthusiastic ok.  Every time I order a draft beer or mixed drink here, it comes in a plastic cup.  Can you just invest in some glassware?  The only benefit to this is that I have occasionally been able to put the cup inside my coat and walk home with it.  Bartenders here are either rude or standoffish.  I've never had one who said anything friendly to me, engaged in conversation, or made a helpful suggestion.    The pizza is supposedly really good, but it also makes the entire bar, and therefore my clothes when I get home, smell like pizza.  Every time I have wanted to eat something here the kitchen has been closed.  I will inevitably be back here because it is so close to my bf's apartment, but it will only be when it's too cold to walk farther."}
{"text":"We went bar hopping and stopped here since our hotel valet suggested it. We just had a couple of tacos and the pretzels. Both were very good! We also had a couple beers. The bartender was pretty attentive, which was nice. We would come back."}
{"text":"This place is a breath of fresh air in Downtown Cleveland, an area whose bars are often part of a different type of \"scene\".  I've stopped in for happy hours and for quick drinks before hitting some of the larger (and louder) bars in the neighborhood and always find myself wanting to stay longer or go back.  Plus there is almost always street parking nearby, which is a huge bonus near the otherwise crowded West 6th.  This place feels like it could be your neighborhood bar -- and it obviously is for some (lucky) people.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"The Maproom is the ultimate downhome bar with great characte. The staff is always friendly, and inviting. They have a great beer selection, nice televisions that always have a game on.  Why I give this a full 5 stars is that the food is the secret weapon. Their pizza is phenominal, and has that straight out of Little Italy taste. The selection is pure Cleveland at its best, from Polish Boys to Friday Fish Fries. IF you are in Cleveland, and looking for that cozy neighborhood spot that sits in the heart of the city, stop in for sure."}
{"text":"I've had two pretty bad experiences here, so I likely won't be coming back. The first of my visits, we ordered food, waited over an hour for it, and after a few encouraging words from different servers and bartenders, we were told it just wasn't happening and we should leave. Not. Cool.   The second visit was before 8pm on a Friday night with barely anyone else out on the street or in the bar, and began with the bouncer checking my ID, skeptically looking at me (I had a pixie haircut in my license photo and my hair has since grown...as hair does), asking me a bunch of questions to keep me in conversation and standing there, double checking my ID, and finally letting me in. We all got a beer and just stood around the bar--not a rowdy group, not a sketchy group, just some people enjoying a beer--but that bouncer kept coming in and eyeing me. WHAT THE HELL, DUDE. Hair grows, I tend to look young, but I'm not trying to trick you. Seriously. Cool. Your. Jets.   The projector screen cutting off part of the bar is also pretty weird to me.  I'll never come back here willingly. After getting turned away because they couldn't keep up with business one night and then being watched because a bouncer didn't trust me for God knows whatever reason, I find this place pretty unpleasant."}
{"text":"Walked in to see pictures of JFK and pope John Paul 2... looked down and saw  puppy. I knew this is my 2nd home in Cleveland.... Irish pub.. daughter loves their pizza.. Guinness on tap... I'm not a night owl nor ever drink more than 2.. but this place is relaxed and good for conversation... daughter and friends watch Philly  eagles here... her friends also loved the pizza... across street from Constantinos market... another favorite"}
{"text":"I was ready to give the Map Room 4 stars based on their pizza alone, but then we decided to come here again the next morning for \"brunch\". We had about 10 people, and the place had maybe 2 other people in it at the time, who already had food. After we ordered and a lengthy wait, people's food started to arrive at very different times, and in no particular order. From the first dish coming out to the last dish being served, I would say that it took over a half hour. How are you supposed to eat a meal as a group if that happens?   Even worse, the bartender didn't care one bit. How does a large pizza come out a full half hour before a bagel and egg sandwich? Even an uncooked veggie sandwich took 30 mins until it came out, which is pretty ridiculous. But the worst moment came when I ordered a calzone. The menu had nothing listed next to the calzones, so I asked if toppings were included. She told me, \"Anything you like\". So I got 3 toppings placed inside. I came to find out once I got the bill, that it was $1 per topping, which the menu, and their bartender, failed to mention."}
{"text":"Total dive bar. Bartender was an idiot and didn't even know how to make shots!! We had to teach her, and she was rude on top of that. Strange clientele - 90% dudes"}
{"text":"One of the best reasons to check out Map Room is, of course, the fact that the bar tender looks like Matthew Fox. Can I get a halleluiah? Don't worry, I don't degrade myself by hitting on him; we usually just stare and drool.   The second reason to check it out is that it is basically a warehouse district bar for the rest of us. It isn't overflowing with hussies or hoodlums. Their food certainly looks amazing (I have never tried it) and they have crazy cheap ($5) nightly specials.   Also, it is a great place for professionals to meet-up after work, and to be introduced to a special someone. ;) I should definitely get a second job as a matchmaker."}
{"text":"The last two times I was here the following happened:  1.  Rude bartenders who purposely overlook you at the bar and then when you try and get their attention they either make a snide remark to you or continue to ignore you  2. Food came out burnt  Done with this place"}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to get a great tasting pizza and a good beer. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone that is visiting the Cleveland area, or someone who simply hasn't been."}
{"text":"I was 1/10 of the group Mark S. mentioned and just wanted to echo the awful service we received. We had friends who needed to leave for the airport 1 hour and fifteen minutes after we arrived to the Map Room. They ended up asking for their food in a to-go box and then nearly cancelled their order because they had to leave. No one ever heard an apology or any word regarding the untimeliness of the kitchen and when we asked, we were met with a curt attitude.   I waited an hour for a bagel sandwich. The bagel wasn't even toasted. I don't get it.   Their pizza was good, but I wouldn't go here again based on my experience with the kitchen & waitstaff."}
{"text":"I went to the Map Room my first night in Cleveland, and since then it's been one of my favorite bars. It's never too crowded, and the people there are interesting, friendly, DON'T CREEP, and aren't falling down drunk (for the most part!) Drinks are cheap and the selection is good. I like being here at the start of the night, I like being here at the end of the night!  Their pizza is also very good - I do wish they had individual slices, though, and my late-night self wishes the kitchen didn't close so early.   Anyway, check it out! Definitely worth a stop or two. A night. Every night."}
{"text":"Good bar in warehouse district. Pizza is sneaky good. Nice beer selection. Went here two nights in a row when visiting Cleveland. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Great place when you want to go downtown, but don't want the drama of the W.6th nasties.  Nieghborhood atmosphere in a downtown setting.  Good place for the \"young professional' crowd.  Totally agree with the hot bartender statement.  drool.  Food is awesome too.  A fine gentlemen once shared a pizza with me there after he politely moved my car since I was too intoxicated to do myself.  In fact I did not even know this man, yet trusted him with my keys.  Perhaps my recolection of 'awesome' food can not be trusted. Also one time I saw people wearing snuggies there.   They have a juke box too."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game! Pizza and apps are good - typical bar food on the menu but nothing I had was bad. Pizza is very popular here. I stayed p the top level but heard they had a bottom level as well- there wasn't much room on the top when it gets crowded for a game. Good variety of bottled beers and beers on tap."}
{"text":"I live right by here so I come here quite often. It is fun on the weekends, but I really like it as a place to grab a quick bite to eat and watch sports during the week.  Out of all the places to go and drink downtown, this is probably my favorite. It is nothing like what you will experience on West 6th. Its usually quite calm here, and just a cool place to mingle with your friends. When people visit me from out of town, I usually take them here, and when they come back, they always ask if we are going back to the Map Room.  Drinks are reasonably priced here, but not cheap. Service is okay...some nights can be better than others, but for the most part the bartenders are friendly.  The food is typical bar food, but it is priced right. They advertise \"the BEST pizza downtown\", and it is, but that doesn't mean it is that amazing.  Overall, a great place to hang out, meet friends, and enjoy a couple of good beers."}
{"text":"Another dilemma for me.    + Nice outdoor table  + Great pizza which ---  - we were fortunate to learn about as I had no idea standing in the dark bar that this joint served any food at all.  I asked if they had any food and the bartender said the pizza is good.  I am thinking oh boy, bar pizza this is going to suck but we had one hour to leave to the airport so we said OK.  Suggestion, make a big pizza sign and tell the wait staff and bartender to actually smile and show some enthusiasm.  I bet you sell $500 more in pizza a day if they do.  - Introduction or Greeting was not pleasant.  We wanted suggestions on local beers and what was on tap and the gal looked pissed off and disinterested.  I am a salesman so I roll with the punches and try to help emotionally drained people along to the point where they at least acknowledge you are a living human being just like they are.  We had a nice beer on tap with a light citrus flavor but I forget the name.  I would go back knowing what I now know, but a well dressed middle aged male is not really welcome here."}
{"text":"Map Room has good pizza and is a great food/drink stop to any night out downtown.  I've been here a handful of times and have yet to see any other item on their menu come out of the kitchen at any time of the day.  They also have a reasonable selection of beer on tap and prices are quite fair for downtown.  If you're lucky, you can grab a seat at one of the two couches in the back by the fireplace during Cleveland's innumerable cold months. For the summer, the outdoor seating area is a great spot to sit, relax and get your fill of vitamin D.  As other reviewers have noted, it can be hard to get good service here, especially as it gets busier later in the evening."}
{"text":"This is the bar of Cleveland. If you come to Cleveland, you must go to this bar. It's a closing bar - end your night here and you know your night was successful.   It is a great bar to get trashed at, and has hands down the best pizza in Cleveland. Get the chicken bacon ranch - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Map Room is my time of bar.  Laid back and unprententious.  Don't get me wrong; I do enjoy crazy nights at packed bars with loud music and big dance floors, too.  But more often than not, I prefer a quiet bar with good beer, good food, and good conversation.  Map Room comes pretty close to hitting the mark.  The atmosphere is perfect in that it's very casual.  This is a great place to go to for a relaxing drink after work.  The food is pretty decent- better than the overly greasy slop that many places serve. Not culinary artwork, but who expects a 5 star meal from a bar?  The beer selections is pretty huge.  I went here craving a woodchuck and they were unfortunately all out.  I asked the bartender for a recommendation as a replacement and he really had no idea what to offer.  This is why they only get three stars.  Your bartenders need to know their drinks.  Especially in a bar with countless beer offerings, patrons who want to try something knew should be offered great recommendations, not a look of confusion."}
{"text":"Great za, plastic cups and some booty touching??? Yea that right. Butt touching. Come me here for Thursday night football and Adam and al got their butts touched so bad. The police got involved and to this day the butttoucher is still at large. So to wrap this up come on down to map room for great people and great times....but watch that butt ;)"}
{"text":"I am knocking this down to a 3 star because of the service. It was AWFUL today.   Went in around 1PM with 2 others. Us and 2 men sitting at the bar. The bartender was quick to order drinks but then had to flag down to order food. Then once we had our food she was gone, nowhere to be found. Had to find her for the bill and then again to pay. Overall bad attitude and slow.   When we left, nearly an hour 15 minutes later, it was still the same people in here. There was no excuse for the awfully slow service.   If you're on a lunch break, I'd skip this place. You certainly won't get in and out in under and hour."}
{"text":"An oasis in the desert of douchiness that is the Warehouse District bar scene. I lived next door for two years, and would \"lock myself out\" for an excuse to come here.   Go on a weekday, or earlier in the night. It loses some of its charm when it is jam packed. Pizze is the best in downtown CLE (although, that's not saying a whole lot), and everything is solid and affordable. Definitely pub grub, but good pub grub."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza (for Cleveland), but try their calzones!  They're better than the pizza in my opinion.  Very cool space, and a nice atmosphere- I love the fireplace!  Relatively inexpensive, too, compared to most other restaurants in the Warehouse District."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've never had the food but I hear it's average. The beer selection is amazing and it's a fun, easy-going, dive atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'd been on the fritz since the cold onerous months before this winter started to catch up to me and put a permanent itch at the back of my esophagus. I decided I was going to gamble the chance of whatever bug was trying to burrow further into my body and was making me, for weeks now, on the verge of falling ill finally overtaking me and attempt to kill it, and everything in my body along with it, with gin and brandy. I walked into the Map Room around 8:30 and ordered a double brandy with a few plops of crushed ice and went over to the dart board and threw a few solo rounds. Some girls walked in and for a while they cackled and talked in high nasally voices and the pieces of their conversation, which became the loudest thing in the place, I was forced to overhear were about their friend's marriages and their insights as to what certain people's, known to them now only through the avenues of social media, lives were like. I decided to start in on the gin and took it with a splash of sprite and a little bitters. The girls left after about an hour and I played the juke box and sat at the bar with my elbow resting on it and my hand holding my head and I must've looked in bad shape because the bar tender had to ask me more than once if I was okay. I assured her I was fine but that I was just getting over a cold. She made sure to use precaution after that when handling my empty glasses. For a nice long while it was just me and the bartender and the songs I selected and an unceasing stream of booze lowering and rising again in my glass and it was very nice. I continued to drink to the point of having my all nerves comfortably dulled and my mind eased and well-lubricated. I finished off a few beers and left. The place was starting to get busy. Business types were ambling around and standing in circles and not noticing me what-so-ever and that's was by all means fine by me. I did attempt to start some conversation with a group of them but after a while of some ever-looming political speak I gleaned there'd be irrevocable differences of opinion between us so rather than push any topic I'd figured it'd be best to go in all good graces. I paid my tab and left. I felt as though I'd been almost getting sick for three weeks and it was a relief to wake up the next day with a hang over that after wearing off left me feeling completely fine."}
{"text":"I have grabbed a few pints here.  Great local bar, good crowd, good vibe.  I wish it was closer to my side of town."}
{"text":"Craft beer & pizza are the main draws to the friendly neighborhood bar. A great place to watch a  game as the crowd really gets into the home teams. Super long bar with several side tables available for seating, along with a fireplace located in the rear of the bar. We had several craft brews followed by a White Pizza topped with ample Jalapeno slices. The pizza arrived in a timely manner and was fresh & hot. The bartender was knowledgeable about the craft beers available which is important to me. The tab for the evening for 4 pints of beer & the pizza was $26 and change, which is decent by any downtown standard. If you are looking for a bar to have some afternoon fun or just finish off your evening, I highly recommend The Map room. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for beer and pizza with some friends. They have a pretty good beer selection and drinks prices are very reasonable. Nice food menu that was mostly comprised of pizza, but also had Strombolis and appetizers. The meat lovers pizza we got was delicious. Only negative was the mozzarella sticks- which were very obviously frozen store bought, but for three dollars I can't complain. This is a very cozy bar with inexpensive drinks, and good pizza. Definitely a place I'll stop by frequently."}
{"text":"I dislike writing negative reviews but this place is ridiculous. This review is about the SERVICE, not food or drink. Went to Gillespie's last night and for the second time in a month, had NO service after ten minutes of waiting. They were not crowded. In fact, only two people at a table. There were two of us and the bar had enough patrons that there were not two seats together. We could have asked someone to move but didn't feel like it. The bartender/waitress clearly was not busy and spent alot of time talking with patrons at the bar, barely moving. We were seen by her when we walked in and made eye contact a couple of times. She continued to serve a drink, here and there, but most time just spent talking. Basically, she was not overwhelmed by business. Same thing happened previously less than a month ago. I used to like the place so I don't know  what has happened but I won't be going there again."}
{"text":"The new husband and I planned a weekday downtown the day after the Fourth to handle some post-wedding business (and have some tourist-like fun).  Yay for us that Groupon ran a few downtown deals the few weeks before this day, leading us to places we never would have found otherwise.  One of those deals was for Gillespie's Map Room - $12 for $25.    We were psyched to think after we handled all of our courthouse/government business we could unwind with some lunch and a beverage or two before heading to our other Groupon find, a Lolly the Trolley two hour tour, spending only $30 at the end of the day.  Sweet!  As other reviewers stated the vibe here is very \"neighborhood bar\".  The room is narrow with a long bar to the right, and tables lining the wall to the left.  We chose a table and ordered our drinks while we perused the menu.  The menu is very Cleveland, even sporting a Drew Carey polish boy.  It would have been MORE awesome if \"Cleveland Rocks\" was playing on the radio at that moment.  THE SNAFU: When the server delivered our drinks we mentioned that we had a Groupon.  We were immediately disappointed when she indicated that the Groupon was only for food, not alcoholic beverages.  We expressed our concern that the Groupon indicated only one food item had to be purchased and did not say \"alcohol exluded\". The wording implied very loudly that beverages were included as long as one food item was purchased along with.  She brought the shift manager over and he apologized but agreed that drinks were not included and said it was a mistake on Groupon's side.  We don't have a problem paying for our drinks, but the issue here is that the food is so stinkin' cheap that we hardly spent the $12 on two lunches and so the Groupon value would be wasted.    THE FIX: The manager was sympathetic and comped our drinks.  To get the most of our Groupon deal we ordered a pizza to-go to boost our ticket total, hoping that it would be alright sitting in the car during the two hour trolley ride we were about to take.  We ate the pizza when we got home and realize that THIS is where Gillespie's mojo is.  We LOVED the pizza and if we're ever downtown looking for a cheap lunch away from the crowd - this is where we'll go."}
{"text":"Why this place rocks my socks: - Damn good pizza (the cheese & crust ugh...drool) - Jackie O's Razz Wheat!!!! - Never fail to run into a Bridgeview neighbie - Chill/laid back atmosphere - Can always find a place to sit - There's a downstairs too! - So much fun during Browns season.  Only complaint is that the pizza takes seriously forever to come out and is a bit overpriced (drinks too) but the pizza's so tasty that it makes up for it."}
{"text":"As a visitor to the city, we ended up here because we were in the mood for pizza and, honestly, this was one of the only places open on a Sunday night downtown.  So happy we came.  There were fairly mixed reviews online - I have nothing bad to report.  Place is located in what seems to be a new trendy area called the Warehouse District, which looks great.  It wasn't overly busy when we arrived so we grabbed a table for two.    They had a great selection of draft beer that we sampled.  We also ordered a salad, which was as good as one can expect in a bar.  The pizza, however, was amazing.  And huge.  In fact, don't ever plan to get a pizza to yourself because it's massive.  We shared and still took home 4 slices.  Service wasn't overly friendly but they were attentive and got everything in our order right.  Overall, great value for the pizza and beer and a neat place in a seemingly cool area.  I would definitely come back to this 'dive bar' again (for the record, I don't think it's a dive at all..)"}
{"text":"The best cajun chicken pizza I've ever had. They have a great selection of beers as well. Even though we sat at a table we had to go to the bar to order anything. Which is kind of annoying. They have a lot of tables and as far as I could tell no servers."}
{"text":"I am definitely a big fan of the pizza here! My boyfriend and I had to go back to Gillespie's a second time during our three day trip to Cleveland! It was nice and quiet for lunch. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Warehouse District, by far.  Can't say too much for the drinks...I'm not a beer girl and when there's no decent wine to be had, I'll just stick with whiskey sours.  Luckily, Gillespie's does all this well (you'd be surprised who doesn't!), all while providing a somewhat low-key place to hang out while you try to regain your hearing after being in any one of the dozen clubs on W. 6th.  I don't hate clubs, by any means, but I do need a respite from time to time and Gillespie's is mine.  It can get a bit crowded, what with its super narrow interior and all, but it's also a bar so if crowds aren't your thing, avoid it."}
{"text":"Chill downtown spot. Warehouse young professional crowd. Good beer selection at a great price for downtown. $3 Heineken. And tasty thin crust pizza. I like it!   I stopped in to catch the end of the Cavs game with a friend. Also grabbed a small mushroom pizza. Bartenders were very nice and helpful. I honestly just loved the atmosphere. All wooden bar, high-top tables (my favorite), beer, and cool people."}
{"text":"Went here to meet up with some friends on a Saturday night and the atmosphere is laid back and low-key. Don't expect any club music from here even if it's located by the Warehouse District in Cleveland. Loud music is played here but they are classic ones like the Beatles and Journey. Mainly all rock.   Drinks are dirt cheap here like I order my regular captain cokes, it was $5! I believe they had a downstairs but it was closed for some reason so can't say there's more to say map room except that they have a full bar and a great selection of beer.   Nice place tohang out to watch a game or to chill."}
{"text":"The pizza is great!  I can't really say what makes it so good but its really satisfying when you want something more than greasy cardboard with rubber cheese.  Definitely the best pizza downtown. As for a bar, Map Room is great when you are hanging out with a fun group of friends and just want a place to hang out.  Map Room is almost perfectly lacking in any real atmosphere or personality - its just a good space to hang out with your friends and grab a beer."}
{"text":"I use to stop by this place at all hours of the day and night because it was convenient. I could walk right across the street and be home. Maproom gave me excuses to order a pizza from home and then walk over and have drinks until it was ready. A watering hole at it's best. Here are the down sides.   Douche bag central yucky ambiance trashy women full of more douche bags after 9pm and weekends game days are horrendous with more douche bags and more douche bags   Guys when I listed those down sides, they weren't referring to the staff. The bartenders have always been pretty cool. Map Room is simply a watering hole for W 9th residents and game day drunks from the burbs. The clientele is a mixed bag of nuts. I had the luxury of using Maproom when I needed to use it for getting stiff drinks, escaping reality, and drowning sorrows. Well, I could have done it at the loft in the Bingham but Maproom was more fun to do it at."}
{"text":"Stopped in a couple of weeks ago for the Yelper meet-up/Browns game (Thanks Cara!) and had a decent time in this pub.  We found ourselves downstairs in a private area with a couple of good-sized TV's for watching football.  I'm not sure if I would ever recommend heading into the basement again because the smell was a little off, and not just in the bathroom!  The main floor had a lot of atmosphere and was a good place to hang out though.  Pizza was filling, nice crust and solid toppings.  The Sauerkraut balls could have had a little more filling in them, for the most part I just tasted deep-fried breading instead of the full Sauerkraut flavour.  :-(  Uh, CHEAP beer though....holy crap, our tab came out to almost nothing.  Unless the bartender forgot to add on about 5 drinks or so!  Maybe we got a Yelp discount?  I dunno, but whatever it was, it was hard to beat those prices.  The best part of my time here at the Map Room was the look on a fellow Yelper's face when I pointed out to him how the girl behind the bar was pouring his Guinness....she plopped the glass on its bottom, turned on the tap and WALKED AWAY!!  Seriously??  No head on it whatsoever when she brought it over, I rarely drink beer and even I know how to pour a proper Guinness....  Good place to go and grab a beer (or five) and some pizza during a game, it was a little slow on Sunday, but I imagine the crowd is a lot larger during the week after work lets out."}
{"text":"I used to come here with some co-workers and it was good.  A little pricey for drinks, but they have a good drink selection and a good bar menu.  I also liked that it is not blaring annoying dance music, too, like so many bars around it.  As one reviewer puts it, it is unpretentious and I agree with that.  I don't see myself ever going back to this place, though.  Someone from this bar either stole my card, or the bartender closed my tab and gave it to the wrong person.  I find that hard to do since I don't have a very common last name. Either way I don't trust them anymore.  I started a tab one night, and forgot to close it, which was completely my mistake.  I went back the next day to pay and get my card back, and it simply wasn't there.  I had the bartender check every nook and cranny at the bar.  Sure enough someone else snagged it from here and made out like a bandit downtown.  Either the bartender took it, which is a harsh accusation I can't fully make, or they just gave it to the wrong person, or someone jumped the bar and ransacked the credit card collection.  I'm only coming back if a good friend convinces me to, or there's another work gathering here."}
{"text":"So here's the situation. Browns just lost to the Steelers. I have on a Browns shirt on and my boyfriend has on a Steelers jersey. We sit, we wait... and wait and wait. Not served because of his shirt? Really.  Meanwhile a customer buys us a shot and says \"you know what it feels like to go to the playoffs. Plus they aren't serving you.\" He even knew they weren't serving us.  Finally we say... hey can we get a beer to the bartender. She turns from her little sugar free Red Bull with an attitude and acts like we just ruined her night for asking her to do her job.   The interior of this place looks awesome. The pizza looked good. I really had good expectations for it. But we stopped in on this particular visit for a beer while traffic cleared out, something that was waaaaay too difficult for this bar. I just want a beer. If you can't do that right on a Sunday night, we've got problems... no wait, you've got problems."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good and the beers are cold.  But that's not enough to overcome the service issues I experienced.  I went one afternoon with a group of friends and the place was pretty empty with only three or four guys at the bar.  Granted, we were a group of about 15 people, so we suddenly brought the attendance up.  We just wanted bar service and a couple of pizzas--we didn't expect table service and the like.  The bar tender was the only person working front of the house and she was completely flustered.  I get it, a large group walks in and it might seem intimidating, but it didn't really require the barrage of F-bombs.  \"I'm going to get effing slammed, I effing know it!! They better effing bring me some effing help in here!!  I'm the only effing person here until effing 8 tonight!!\"  Eff, eff, eff, and so on.  She was saying this to the customers.    The bar tender seemed beyond disorganized and distracted.  She would take an order, start to fill a glass, and then take someone else's order, and start to fill that.  Every time anything distracted her, she forgot what she was doing.  The bulk of the customers had to remind her to finish their orders.  In my case, she greeted my wife and I, asked if we needed menus, and then took someone else's order before we had time to even say yes.  It was just a wreck.  We all tried to encourage her and tell her she was doing fine, etc... but she just couldn't pull it together.  Maybe there's more going on in the background that I don't know about that made it all justified.    My other problem is how this place is dark as hell.  We were there mid-day, it was bright and sunny out, yet we walked into a place that was darker than my basement.  If felt like I walked into a real alcoholic's bar.  One of those joints where it's always dark, allowing the hardcore alcoholics a chance to drink past their hangover free from the harsh light of day and the extra headaches it brings.  Dim lights are one thing, but this place was just dark--no lights at all.  I'll probably try this place again, at some point, but I just cannot recommend it at the moment."}
{"text":"Nice downtown dive bar. Nothing bad, nothing special. They have a nice little patio area outside and decent prices. Probably should be a 3 star, but the customer service was really good so I'll give it a 4."}
{"text":"I'm not much for nightlife, but if I were to go out with workers or friends, this would be my choice.  More professional crowd, no UFC on the tv, comfortable chairs, great music, and a gigantic airplane!"}
{"text":"Average bar. People seemed to flock here for pizza. They need more bartenders, or an area for walk ups to order. Typical downtown major city prices."}
{"text":"Great downtown bar. Prices are very fair nothing here drinks or food is overly expensive. There food here is actually very good too. They have hotdogs on their menu that are amazing as strange as that sounds. Their pizzas are outstanding and they regularly have dinner specials such as Fish dinners, Taco night etc...It's a must see in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"This a great neighborhood bar. The bartenders there are great, and it's a much more laid back after work bar."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Cleveland. Just don't try to call to place an order to go because the bartenders take the phone off the hook. Still, drive over and waited 20 minutes so I could take it home."}
{"text":"Cleveland Bucket List no. 4: Map Room chyeeeeck!  Three stars for the beer list, maybe three and a half. Two stars for the service. Five stars for the space (except for the bathroom - upgrade!). Lemme 'splain.  Thursday night, post -Yelp Science Fair: a small group wandered in and it was loud. Not \"turn it down, I'm old\" loud but \"WHAT?\" loud in a cavernous room filled with only maybe 10 people including staff. They did turn it down without stink eye, which was nice. Beer list was good, better than most, but not what I had built up in my head (which is, I admit, a beer nerd).   Biggest offense of the night?  Me to bartender: \"Can you recommend a nice Belgian?\" (I'd just had an Ommegang 'Rare Vos' - $6 for a 12oz bottle, yeeouch but friggin delish) Bartender: \"Um... We have Blue Moon...?\" Me: *indignant blink* \"I'll have another Rare Vos\" Annoyed beer snob is annoyed.  Sigh... I get it. You are where you are, Map Room. You need cute eye candy to bring in the dudes. But you know, if you have a beer list that goes beyond Coors, Miller and Bud, invest a little bit of time in training your staff about which beers are what. For every 10 people who drink Lite you might actually get a person that knows something about decent beer and just as quickly lose them by hiring staff that thinks Blue Moon is a recommendation for a Belgian beer.   This is Habby's review to give since she ordered it, but folks rave about the pizza - the one she received looked like a Tombstone I cooked when I was 13 and didn't realize our oven ran 50 degrees too hot.    Not impressed, Map Room. I don't hate you, but when and if I return I'll consider my expectations steeply recalibrated."}
{"text":"This is my ultimate cheers bar. You know, that comfortable, awesome kind of bar that always makes you feel a wave of happiness once you step in the door? You feel safe and welcome all the time?  And you can't beat the beer selection, people, vibe and prices.   I think it's really unique that Map Room changes with the times, but remains the same in many ways. I know, that kind of doesn't make sense--but it does to me.   They recently added breakfast to their menu and I can't wait to stop in to try it out. If you ask me, Sunday afternoons are where it's at."}
{"text":":  Great little hidden jem.Great music ,great drink prices and the atmosphere is eclectic and old world.Very old historical building.Friendly bar maid.Great after work crowd"}
{"text":"Great bar, good prices, and BEST pizza in town.  It's right across the street from my building but I would recommend coming from other neighborhoods to come hang out at this place. The staff is very friendly, and the atmosphere is the young professional downtown crowd without the \"bump and grind\" feel of West 6th.    If you want a table, get there early - this place fills up!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here before the Pats/Browns game. Great atmosphere. Not too crowded (ESP at 11. Game was at 1). Sat out on their porch. Their macaroni and cheese bites were to die for! Mostly awesome service.   The only reason I didn't give a 5 star was because one of the bartenders with brunette hair all the way to the right was more interested in talking and taking her shots with her boyfriend, even though I was standing right there wanting to be served. She had a very poor attitude when she finally came around too.   I didn't have a problem with any of the other servers, however! Would come here again. Def recommend."}
{"text":"where everybody knows your name... great neighborhood hang. patio on a nice day. worthy pizza. rock and roll. comfortable place. just go. it's all bar all the time."}
{"text":"Love map room! Great dive bar feeling and food is super cheap. The chicken fingers are yummy and 4$!  If you're looking for reasonable priced beer and cheap pub food, map room is your best bet."}
{"text":"Good place to call home if I lived downtown, ok food, good brew selection. The calzone was very good and the bar maid was friendly."}
{"text":"This place may arguably have the best pizza in Cleveland. Or at least top. Grab a pizza and a beer and enjoy. The crust is always good and the service is usually pretty quick. Also it's a plus that they are open pretty late."}
{"text":"Cheap beer but the rest of the drinks are kinda pricey they have good pizza but this place is kinda of a hole in the wall and you think it would be cheaper"}
{"text":"Put it this way.....when I come back to Cleveland, no matter how short my visit, no matter how many family members are vying for my time, no matter how jet-lagged I am, I ALWAYS make time to swing by Map Room for a couple beers and their ridiculous. amazing. delicious. heavenly. PIZZA.  Spent several years living on West 9th Street and doing the whole Warehouse District single-gal thing before I moved across the country.  Here's how my husband knew I was a good catch....MY kind of bar is Map Room.  Not Velvet Dog, not BarFlyy, not Funky Buddha (I know, kind of a blast from the past), not Wish (yes I said Wish....remember it???).  But the unpretentious, genuine, laid-back, unstupid kind of hole-in-the-wall (and I say that as a compliment) that Map Room is.  Girls who love this bar don't wear tops as dresses. Truly enjoy cold beer and sports.  Don't wear heels to Browns games.  Love a great juke box (which Map Room absolutely has).  That's MY kind of place.  Just doesn't get any better than this, people.  I completely agree with the guy who said, \"If I owned a bar, it would be just like Map Room.\"  Ditto."}
{"text":"Not bad, although I've only been here once. The atmosphere was dark, which I like, and the drinks were reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Went here for pizza with friends a few months back and have been meaning to write a review because I was so pleasantly surprised! I'd been having a tough time finding a thin crust pizza to my liking in Cleveland and this place nailed it! Perfectly cooked crust, delicious cheese blend, a just-right sauce. Loved the veggie pizza (the banana peppers added just the right amount of Zing!) the folks I was with ordered two different specialty chicken pizzas that they said were tasty.  Love the dive bar atmosphere and the interesting decor. Great prices. Good tap beer selections. Will definitely be coming back! Only downside was that the food took quite some time to come out despite us being one of two tables there for a late lunch. Was fine for us as we intended to throw back a few beers and catch up with out of town friends, but wouldn't go here if I didn't plan on drinking or having a long lunch."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place the short time I was in Cleveland.  Drinks very reasonably priced.  It's also one of those places you can sit out on the patio and talk to other customers.   Food is very good.  I had the Greek salad and it was very good.  No kalamata olives but I knew that when ordering.   Pizza also very good.  Would definitely recommend and go back again."}
{"text":"Oh Map Room...how I love your patio, pizza and beer!  Such a great, laidback bar in the Warehouse District.  In the winter, it's a great place to catch up with some friends inside the warm, welcoming bar.  In the summer, it's even better with a patio on W. 9th perfect for people watching.  They don't have a large menu, but the pizza is my standby.  They have a great beer selection and the bartenders are always helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Says online, including here on Yelp, that they're open until 2:30am. I went way out of my way to come at midnight and they were already closed. Super lame."}
{"text":"Neighborhood bar in the warehouse district. Brennan and Mandy are great. Pizza is phenomenal. Maybe best in the city. Great selection of brews. Chill spot."}
{"text":"My friend lives at the Bingham apartments across the street and says that the Map Room is one of his absolute Cleveland staples. We went there after a Cavs game around 10:30 to drown our sorrows in some beer and good pizza, and Map Room definitely didn't disappoint. Despite being somewhat crowded, we were able to get a table, order drinks, and get a delicious pizza!  They had some decent beer on tap, not the largest selection but still good. They had enough TVs that we were somewhat able to watch all the March Madness games (some of the TVs were a bit small). The bartender seemed overwhelmed and needed help - it took awhile to get drinks but that's to be expected on a weekend night. The bouncer (I'm not sure his name, apparently he is there all the time), was so friendly and attentive even at that hour. He was constantly pre-bussing our table and asking us about the food.   I was overall pretty satisfied with the experience. You can tell it's a local bar where a bunch of fun regulars come to chill out. The music was great and it was a complete 180 from some of the places on W 6th."}
{"text":"If you're a woman who likes being harassed by a staff member, come here on the weekends .  The guy working the door makes inappropriate comments to my girlfriend every time she would come in. The things he has said when I wasn't there are even worse. I have no idea why they still let him work there as I've noticed I'm not the old only who has complained.  I used to come here all the time, but not anymore, which sucks because I live close by. The pizza is really good, but it often takes a while at night."}
{"text":"In an ongoing struggle to find Cleveland's best pizza, we've come to the Map Room. In an ongoing attempt to find a comfortable neighborhood bar, we've come to the Map Room. In both instances, we left underwhelmed and marching off into the sunset, yet again on our seemingly endless voyage.   The first floor of this bar is vastly airy and dark with airplane nostalgia strung about. The vast space and sky high ceilings are almost cathedral like. The basement, to be frank, smells funny. Very musty indeed. Kind of foul actually.(Probably from all of the vomit and urine filtering through the storm drains from the nearby West 6th hell holes). Either way, I don't recommend going down there if you don't have to. The drafts poured down there seemed to lack carbonation or a clean filtration system required for a proper pour. Somewhere in the distant rolling green acres of Ireland, cousin Seamus McFinegan wept profusely when I was served a flat Guinness.   The pizza? Perfectly acceptable actually. Just not divine or life changing or anything like that. Every inch of this pie is covered with sauce, cheese and toppings, leaving little, if any crust on the ends. This pie certainly goes well with beer. And I'd even recommend it if in the area. I just wouldn't go out of my way for it again."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered take out pizza from here and I think it's pretty good. The first time I ever had their pizza was at a friend's house who ordered a bunch for his guests. I thought it was pretty good and was happy to find out that it's right around the corner from where I live. The veggie is probably my favorite, though the BBQ chicken is also good."}
{"text":"Chill bar, lots of locals and a very hearty beer menu. Bartenders seemed to be quick, no complaints."}
{"text":"If I ever own or run a bar, I would want it to be exactly like this place, which oozes a drunken kind of class different than your usual Bud Light/wings type of joint. You know, the gin drinker's kind of class, when you have five gimlets after work, soak in the wood-paneled ambiance, sit on the comfy couches and stare at the cool fireplace, and then stumble home to watch DVDs of \"The Wire\" or whatever the 30-somethings are watching nowadays."}
{"text":"In town to grab a night's rest before continuing my journey to Chicago and tour the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame I stumbled upon this place after dinner. Great unpretentious place to grab a beer and share conversation. It was a quick walk from our hotel on a beautiful evening. If the place was on my hometown I would be a be a regular. It was a spacious place as well."}
{"text":"We r during craft beer week.  We were excited to check out the Map Room.  Unfortunately we only stayed for one drink.  Even though the bar was listed on the Beer week website the bartender did not know that they were involved.  The beer that was to be highlighted was not.  I do not drink beer but most of the bars have had fun drink soecials.  No drink specials and when I asked the bartender for a vodka drink she shad no suggestions.  She said you can gave any of the flavored vodka with whatever you want.  I wanted a suggestion as I am not a bartender."}
{"text":"When in C-town this is my Pizza go to!  I would not refer to it as a sports bar although I find myself here when a pretty important game is on.  I plant myself on the sofa just below the big screen near the fire place....LOL it's like bottle service set up with out the fee.  other most haves Mac and Cheese bites!  IF you see me check into Hopkins pick me up and I'll buy pizzas"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Cleveland ! Great hole in the wall atmosphere with decent drink prices but come for the pizza and leave happy"}
{"text":"The pizza here is so good.  I usually go here at weird times-Sunday afternoon, Tuesday night etc.  So I can't really comment on the bar scene but my friends and I have fun when we go.  The cajun chicken pizza is really good.  Service is good too except one time someone new was working and she didn't take anyones cards that opened tabs so we had to try and remember who had what then close our tabs and reopen them.  Understandable though."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to have a drink downtown but would like avoid the douche factor this is the place to go. Map Room is your  typical dive. The Pizza is EXCELLENT, the service is good, and you'll always find a good mix of people in there. There are some nights when they have live music but for the most part this place is a pretty chill atmosphere.   My only complaint is that their kitchen is not open past midnight. There have been many a night I have wandered in late craving a hot slice and sadly I end up back on W 6th at Panini's because the Map Room kitchen is closed."}
{"text":"seven minutes in  the boiling cauldron of fat  chicken wing delight!   OK, this spot has been open a few years now and it just gets better. I think that this is the best downtown pizza around. Thin crust, many options and \"designer pizza\" styles. No - not pizza with foie gras, truffles and organic hibiscus bulbs, but a few innovative versions. The \"southwest pizza\" with jalapenos is pretty damn good. The wings are hard to beat. Six for 3 bucks, always perfectly cooked. A bit more than the regular deep fried bar food menu. Hot dogs, brats, salads, sandwiches... Guinness on tap. The neon shamrock was my first clue... The Map Room's a good neighborhood watering hole. Non-horrifying bathrooms, and the barkeeps are always smiling.  Well done Map Room.  Well done.  Carry on."}
{"text":"Great bar to hang out at for drinks, and brings a great crowd as well. Bartenders are great. But the pizza is off the charts AWESOME! If you haven't yet, do yourself a favor and try it. The Chicken Fiesta, Chicken Alfredo, and Meat Lovers are my personal favorites."}
{"text":"Still awesome! Sean and I hit Gillespie's again yesterday after a morning of getting all sweaty and dirty cleaning a boat. We rolled in there in our work jeans and hoodies looking all nasty. But we didn't feel out of place at all even though there were some look at my trendy shoes/button down/sweater/I wear my sunglasses inside an EXTREMELY dark bar at 1 pm on Saturday kind of dudes. Whatever, I love the feel of this place - like all are welcome, come as you are.    So we had one of the large specialty pizzas again. This time we tried the Cajun Chicken pie. Wow. Again, out of this world! The sauce was this excellent tangy,mustardy,garlicky goodness. If you like pizza (come on, who doesn't?)- you NEED to get to Gillespie's."}
{"text":"Maybe the most underrated bar in the warehouse district. Great atmosphere on Friday/Saturday nights -- crowded but not packed like a lot of the places on W. 6th. Food is  GREAT -- particularly the pizza but I've also had some of their sandwiches at lunch time and they definitely did not disappoint. Beer selection is very good and service is fast and friendly. A definite stop for those interested in the downtown Cleveland bar scene."}
{"text":"Such a cool neighborhood bar.  Great service, great atmosphere, and great beer and liquor selection (carries Effin Cucumber vodka, Van Gogh expresso vodka, a ton of Three Olive Vodka Flavors, and Seadog Blueberry Beer!)"}
{"text":"Not sure if I would say that it's the \"best cajun chicken pizza\" I've ever had. Pretty cool bar though right downtown in CLE. Enjoyed being able to walk here.  Good beer selection. Nice bar atmosphere. Love the people.   I would come back to hang out and grab some bar food.  Oh yeah... the salad is just out of a bag with bag dressing so dont even bother."}
{"text":"Bad service. Not very attentive. Waited forever for a drink. And Titos is 6 bucks....Titos! A bottle is 20 bucks.   Oh well... On to another place. The pizza smells good though."}
{"text":"Tony did a really good job showing customer service here on game 6. Ended up starting a fight with one of the patrons and then ended up approaching another group and threatening them. I'd be terrified to let this guy represent my company in any capacity. Video to prove! EDIT** now I here from other employees and customers saying \"oh he does this all the time\" \"just Tony being Tony\" LOL fire this guy seriously if you were smart management LET HIM GO."}
{"text":"This afternoon I had a HORRENDOUS experience. I always have the kitchen do a specialty version of the hot ham sub they offer. I picked it up and walked back to my office. To my surprise when I opened it up, it was the exact same ham sub that they have on the menu-which was not what I ordered. So I walked back to the establishment, told the bartender what was wrong and she quickly went downstairs to have it remade. So I waited another 15minutes or so. This time when it arrived, I opened the container before I left. To my horror-the entire sub was burnt. The cook came from upstairs and watched me open the container-as if she wanted to see my reaction.The bread was black and so was the meat. It was not edible-unless you were a dog. Atleast the cook put the correct cheese on this time. I had no more time to waste so I asked for a refund, which the bartender did issue. After I bought lunch from another establishment, I called back to Maproom to speak with a manager. The Bartender told me there was no manager or supervisor. She then begins to give me excuses as to why it is difficult to prepare my sub despite me telling her I always order it this particular way. She continued to insist that there are no managers or supervisors so I asked her who hired her. She then hung up. I've always had great experiences at MapRoom this was by far the worst. The Bartender was unprofessional, nasty and rude. The cook was incompetent."}
{"text":"Cheap \"utensils\" (plastic), dark room, loud music, smokers seated right outside the entrance door with the door left wide open makes for a smokey reataurant, no tableside wait service....go to the bar for everything to be served by an obnoxious bar tender.  What's not to like???  Actually, I was impressed with the Stromboli, except the crust was completely burnt. Hmm...like I said, what's not to like? Not at all what I was expecting.  The \"restaurant\" seems to have a major identity crisis....it's reflected in EVERYTHING about this place."}
{"text":"Map Room has the best pizza I've had in Cleveland. It's a cute place - dimly lit - seems like a lot of regulars hang out here. When I went to get a pizza Sunday there were about 7 other pizzas waiting to get picked up! That's how good it is. I've heard a few of their specialty pizzas are amazing - can't wait to try those   During Browns games this place gets packed but not in the douche west 6th/Barley house way. You can actually talk to people siting around you and make friends at the bar discussing the game or doing shots. I look forward to spoiling myself with Maproom pizza every few weeks!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I've never been here before till yesterday! Where have I been!? Lets talk about the goodness:  The pizza. Enough said. That's it, shows over people. The pizza is delicious! I want it now, I want it for dinner and I want it for breakfast tomorrow morning. We ordered pizza to go and had a beer while waiting for the pizza. Our pizza came out before our friends pizza, so I just kept picking at the pepperoni. By the time we left, there was only 1-2 slices that still had pepperoni on them. Oops.   The beer. Cold, refreshing and so cheap! Honestly, don't think you can beat the price of a beer from downtown here.   The atmosphere. Totally fell in love. Walking up I was a little skeptical, but after walking in and sitting down I fell in love.   Honestly, this might be my new go to divey bar. Nothing better than some pizza and beer for a great price."}
{"text":"I'm not afraid to admit that I'm a pizza snob. Whatever. I'm originally from Columbus where, surprisingly, there are tons of great pizza places. I moved to Cleveland recently and I've been on a quest to find good pizza. I have found this particularly difficult and it's probably because I'm living downtown and don't get out of the city often. However, I finally made it to the Map Room today and was floored. Everyone on Yelp raves about their pizza but I was still skeptical before my visit (remember, I'm a snob?). Well, the reviews are legit. The pizza at the Map Room is excellent. Can't wait to visit again...found my new favorite pie in The Land."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great pizza. I'd go with the BBQ chicken pizza and/or the breadsticks as an appetizer."}
{"text":"I really love this bar. It's a gem of a dive bar in the midst of the club scene of the warehouse district.   My favorite things: 1) the pizza, which is always perfect and delicious and has the perfect crust (love the bbq chicken) 2) good beer list 3) random and amusing music 4) perfect place to watch a game, like when the cavs killed the heat tonight   It's really low key, and the service can be slow on a busy night, but if you're in the mood for a chill night, it's just perfect."}
{"text":"Good Vibes here.  I think everyone reviewing this place can vouch for this.  Which is why we keep going back.  Comfy bar to sit at and friendly people to talk to.   Last visit was for a Browns Game and Bloody Mary's.  Both were good, surprisingly.   I felt like I was at an extended relative's house where everyone knew each other even though they didn't.  It wasn't a bunch of 22 year old meatheads drinking vodka cranberry like the last time I was downtown for a Browns Game.  Just some nice people enjoying some beverages on a sunny Sunday afternoon.  I haven't tried the food yet, so my review is based solely on the friendly service and atmosphere.  Hard wood is nice, especially when I'm not the one cleaning the floors."}
{"text":"Pizza: 5/5, 10/10, A+ Best I've had in a while and it's right around the corner.  I'm glad I'm strong willed or I would live off it.  I went all out with a Pepperoni, Banana Pepper, and Jalapeño pizza.  It's greasy but not too greasy, good crust, good sauce, good cheese, and fresh, fresh fresh toppings, and good spices on top.  Cheesy Bread is also ridiculously good.  Beers: B+ Drafts are kind of small for a hole in the wall pizza joint and not cheap, but not expensive.  Service: C Meh.  Everything is done by the bartenders, so they have a lot on their pizza dish (ha!), but quite honestly, they could make an effort and I'd give them a A/B.  They walk back and forth at the bar without acknowledging the presence of someone wanting to hand them money in exchange for drinks.  Even a \"Hi, give me a second\" would suffice.    Summary: The service may be sketchy, but all is forgotten after the pizza arrives."}
{"text":"Downtown is not my scene. I don't like W 6th so this is a good escape if friends want to go downtown. It is a nice place to just sit and slug beer. The beer list is not good, oh well. The pizza is overrated. The little airplane that hangs from the ceiling creeps me out."}
{"text":"Beer and pizza; you cannot go wrong with that combo. Gillespie's certainly has beer. Beers on tap as well as an impressive amount of bottles, with many labels I've never seen before, facing out from inside the glass fridge.   The beer selection was a surprise. Pizza is why I came here. I ended up going with one of the simpler specialty pizzas: Deluxe - pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, onions, green peppers. I loved it. The crust, which I never really eat, was perfectly cooked and seasoned. There was a generous amount of all the toppings too. The base wasn't an extreme thick, but more thick than thin - perfect. They even cooked a really good pepperoni and olive pizza for my friend without dairy.   The rest of the place isn't worth talking about really. I like the map theme and the plane hanging from the ceiling. There's maps on the wall and map globes on the ceilings fans. Otherwise it fits the bill for your typical neighborhood bar, though it could use a bit of a dusting, some scrubbing and painting, and sweeping up of cobwebs."}
{"text":"The place hasnt changed since I moved to Cleveland in late 2008.  The pizza is still good, the drinks are strong and staff is friendly plus it a great place to grab night caps and/or pizza as you stumble back to Bridgeview or Bingham."}
{"text":"Such a great bar! The week days are really chill but the on the weekends the bar gets pretty busy. They have good beer prices and a pretty good selection! Their pizza is to die for and the rest of their food is pretty great too! Map Room has definitely become one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"One word to describe the pizza... DELICIOUS!!! Yes, it deserves 3 exclamation marks!!! The service is always great & when Taco Tuesdays are just to busy this place beats the lines of TT all the time, with better food. On top of generous drinks prices, they have a great selection of cocktails & beers as well. Check this place out if you already haven't, but I'm sure if your a Cleveland native, you've already been here... If not, get here soon!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to watch the Indians/White Sox game. I turned to yelp and saw this place was pretty close to my hotel, seemed to have solid reviews, and was only reviewed by locals.  IN  Glad I went. The pizza was nothing special,but I wasn't expecting much from Cleveland pizza. The tap selection was nothing special either, but the bottle selection was pretty solid. Prices were ridiculously cheap too. Seemed to be $2-4 for all bottles.   This is a solid chill place. Everyone there seemed to know everyone else, but I didn't feel out of place. There was a BMW airhead in the back and large airplane hanging from the ceiling. Oh, and the music was provided courtesy of my favorite satallite radio station.   If I lived in Cleveland, this would be my bar."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local bar!  They have a great vibe, great TV's and great pizza!  They are good at what they do, making pizza and sandwiches and pouring beers!    They have a great patio with sunshine all day too!"}
{"text":"Do NOT come here when there is a game playing. Any game. Ever. We happened to come for pizza when the Cavs were playing. It might have been a \"big\" game... I wouldn't know because I'm not too sporty - but it seemed \"big\". The boy acted like it was \"big\".   At any rate - I wanted pizza. He suggested we go somewhere else... although it was after 11pm on a Saturday. Not too many options - and we were already here. The bar and seating area was packed. It reminded me a little of ABC the Tavern because its long and narrow.   As luck would have it, a table opened up almost immediately after we arrived. And, the bartender was super attentive, even considering the chaos going on. Kudos to her. They had an awesome cider on tap! Bonus! I love draft cider.   So, the pizza... we ordered the supreme, or deluxe - or something of the like off the specialty pizza menu. It came out hot, saucy, and with super fresh ingredients. In fact, it was kind of amazing. Plus, it was after 11pm and I hadn't eaten all day.   I imagine I would really like the Map Room on a less chaotic day. Next time I go, I'll update my review. Overall, it had solid food, a great bar selection, and a nice feel."}
{"text":"I have been to this fine watering hole about 3 times, and each time it has not disappointed.  Last visit, we went mid afternoon in search of some \"bar grub\".  I ordered the Chicago Dog.  It was a slightly different take on the original, but the fact that the dog was grilled...woo-hoo!  Friend ordered the calzone, which was huge, tasty and perfectly cooked.  I observed others around us ordering pizza.  It looked pretty good.  I'm hoping that they add burgers to their menu.  If they can make a darn good dog, they probably will make a kick ass burger! As far as the libations, great place to chill out and have a cocktail."}
{"text":"Is it weird that I've never been here for what it is... a bar....? EVERY time I've come, I've pretty much had a craving for their pizza and have ordered a beer WITH the pizza. And, this is my go-to carry out thin crust pizza place when a) vincenza's below my building is closed and b) I'm not feeling super lazy - and by super lazy, i mean SUPER lazy, b/c it's about a mile from my apt!   It's a super hole in the wall bar, which I LOVE. Super chill. Located in the warehouse district. Dark when you walk in and pretty narrow. Stairs to go downstairs right by the front door, then the bar on the right and a handful of tables on the left.   Anyways, their pizza.... WONDERFUL. You order your food at the bar and when it's ready, you grab it at the bar and since they're super chill you get paper plates. I always get their veggie pizza- delish - black olives, mushrooms, green pepps, onions, banana pepps... all for 12.50???? AMAZING. I brought my parents here once, again- not b/c we were looking for a chill bar, but b/c we wanted some yummy pizza.  The only unfortunate thing is that, even when they are super slow, if you're eating there- it often takes forever for them to bring out your food... I'm ok with downing a few more beers while waiting, but sometimes it doesn't make sense why it takes so long.  LOVE this place and will continue going back for more. Maybe one day, I'll walk in to just drink - probably not tho. I love their pizza way too much."}
{"text":"The pizza here was great and the decor is top notch. I enjoyed the dark ambiance, but others may not agree. Great place to have lunch when visiting Cleveland!"}
