{"text":"Highly recommend not going. Ordered the breakfast wrap with bacon, it had a single egg, one slice of bacon, on a 6 inch wrap, for five dollars plus two dollars for the cup of coffee. The tomato they sliced and placed on the plate next to it was larger than the wrap itself... no hash brown or home fry."}
{"text":"Only diner downtown. Love love this place. You can get a great full breakfast for about 8 bucks! The pancakes, eggs, bacon, coffee, cheese, everything is so great! The staff has been there for years, and are so nice and willing to take care of you. They will accommodate you. 

I've been here for both lunch and breakfast. You have to try their pancakes and for lunch get a burger. You won't be sorry. The burgers are plump and juicy. And so filling. 

The menu is pretty large so there's a ton to choose from. Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the corner of 301 Grant St is Nicky's. This place is not accessible from the outside. You actually have to enter the office complex and head towards your right by passing the security and elevators.

The place is small, clean, and has fast friendly service. You can sit around a counter or at booths or tables. Prices are extremely reasonable and breakfast is served all day.

I was meeting a friend for lunch. Her favorite dish is the grilled cheese with tomato soup. I decided to go with grilled chicken salad with roll. You can pretty much get away with a meal for under $10.00 since it it a diner.

I was amazed at the size of my salad and believe me it was indeed difficult to finish. However, since it was light I was able to do it and the chicken tasted fresh along with the greens. My girlfriend loved her sandwich and soup.

Nicky's is only open during the workweek so parking can be pricey unless you use public transportation.

I did look over the breakfast portion which is served all day. They use jumbo eggs when making any of those dishes. Next time I will have to inquire about egg substitutes.

Located in the downtown offices of our US Senators across from Oxford Plaza, Nicky's makes a great place to go if you are dining on a budget."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch after visits with Senators Toomey and Casey staffers. First time eating here and I'm always in the Grant Building! Grabbed a cheeseburger for lunch and it was pretty good.
I couldn't finish it so I'll have the other half for a later meal. Really big and flavorful burger.
Everything on the menu looked so good I'll have to come back to work my way through it.
I'm told breakfast is really good too. Can't wait to find out."}
