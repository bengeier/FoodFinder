{"text":"Excellent food. I followed some of the recommendations and order their AMAZING pepperoni roll and Philly chicken hoagie. Also, I got a broccoli chicken pizza. All very, very good. Online order was delivered on time and hot!!  My new delivery place!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Convenient location. The wings are good too. I live nearby and stop there a lot. I haven't had any bad experiences."}
{"text":"Everything is so good here! Their chicken Philly hoagies are the best!!! And of course their pizza and wings. And they deliver! Super good!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had! Great and quick service and they also have a great mobile application with fabulous coupons!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery last night . Good quality pizza and steak hoagie . I think the pizza is one of the better ones on this area, cooked well with good flavor . Will recommend"}
{"text":"Good pizza, salads and hoagies. Burgers are decent, Wings not so much. Prompt delivery, and never had any issues with orders. Online delivery option is nice!"}
{"text":"We ordered from here last night, and this mornign woke up to a double charge from them running my debit card twice for our order. It seems they add an utomatic gratuity to ever delivery and not knowing that I wrote in a tip so the driver wouldnt get shorted. Then they ran my card all over again for the greater amount as well. When my business partner Richard Orr, called to straighten it out today the manager wouldn't help and said he had to wait for a call back from the owner.....then hung up on him. I am beyond livid and this will be the end of us patronizing this restaurant."}
{"text":"Giving it 5 stars just on food alone.  No place to eat there. There is a single table, but I think that's just for people waiting for carry-out.  Ok, the food. I had Fellini's Famous Roll(s), Chicken Bacon Cheddar and an order of fries.  Lots of chicken, good amount of bacon, oozing with cheese. I've had similar items at other places, but those were more bread and dough.  This had a good wrapping of fresh dough, sweet and a little chewy. Not tough, just a bit chewy. I liked it that way.  They included some type of white sauce, probably some sort of garlic dip. Tasty, but I probably should've asked for pizza sauce, which is my usual preference.  French fries were really good. Hot, fresh and no grease!!  A definite yes!  Next time I'm in the area, will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing white pizza! We also love the breadsticks. Def favorite pizza in Monroeville so far"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a couple of slices for the first time.m and the pizza is awesome. Slightly sweet sauce, thin golden brown crust with light bubbly edges, and the slices were hot and fresh, not reheated 3 times.  Friendly service. We will def be back for more pizza and to try some other menu items.   Update: 3-14-16****** Ordered a large NY style pizza pepperoni for pick up and it was awesome! Was ready in 10-15 minutes, and deliciously thin and crispy. Best part was it only cost 8.50!  Be sure to ask for NY style of you want it thin."}
{"text":"3.5 stars... This is one of the only pizza spots in town we hadn't tried out, so we ordered a mushroom, olive, and onion white pizza with a side of the hot cheddar balls and breaded mushrooms.  We requested delivery for 8pm and the (super kind and apologetic) delivery lady brought our order around 8:20ish. She explained there were only 2 drivers and they were extremely busy that evening. I honestly didn't mind, but might have, had I been hungrier. Her sincerity made all the difference.   The pizza was very good and I'd say the best part about it was the generous toppings. They were easily spread around and slices weren't cut completely even, but again, the toppings made up for it. One thing I noted about the taste was it seemed like they use a lot of herbs like Rosemary or oregano on their crust. It helped to bring out the flavor, although the dough was not the best I ever had. It reminded me slightly of Pizza Hut crust, and was just a tad too oily for my personal liking.   Breaded mushrooms and cheese balls were good and served with a marinara(?) sauce that was sweeter in taste than most I've had. I thought the cheese poppers were a little scarce both in quantity and quality (not the best I've tasted) for the 5.50 price. Mushrooms were decent and again, came with dipping sauce.   I would order again from here, but wouldn't be my number one choice. I think it has potential to get better, though. Bonus point for coupons that are offered via text, which we did not take advantage of on this occasion."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to stop and order food.  As soon as we walked in,  I had a bad feeling.  The restaurant is filthy and the guy who took our order was high on something.  He took our order and and overcharged us twice.  The total should have been 11 dollars.  First they charged us 16 and then 13. The women in the back kept screaming about how he undercharged us for a salad.  She argued with us and we showed her the menu. She still was bitching about the price.  My food was thrown in a bag,  not in a container. I got chicken tenders and fries.  His salad was chopped and was dumped into a container.  I wouldn't recommend eating here."}
{"text":"If you want cold Pizza almost two hours later, this is the place. I called after 45 minutes as was told that it's on the way. I'm pretty sure it was the owner. It arrived 65 minutes after the phone call. I threw it in the garbage. I've had it before, it's not that good either."}
{"text":"The food has always been great and reasonably priced. My problem lies with the fact that they charge you $1.25 to place an order online, and then their delivery charge is $1.85.  While we love this place, we never figured out our extra charges until we placed an order for delivery today and saw these charges. Completely disappointed in this discovery. Charging to place an online order. What time era is this business in? The delivery was quick considering we live less than a mile from here and the driver was extremely courteous."}
{"text":"Average at best. We placed an order for pick up. Their pizza is ok. We tried a meatball and veggie pizza and a chicken and a veggie pizza. Needed a bit more sauce and cheese. Also, I tried a buffalo chicken salad...possible the worst I've had in a while. The chicken barely had any buffalo sauce on it, though it could be because was unbreaded. I imagine you could get breaded chicken on it to add more texture and buffalo sauce. The fries were typical frozen fries, barely cooked, and droopy... :( plus, the salad was just normal, boring iceberg. Lastly, the service was also very slow, but they gave a coupon for a free pizza in the future to make up for it."}
{"text":"After ordering pizza from the same place for over 10 years, this is our new favorite for pizza delivery.  The true test of a good pizza is to try it plain.  If the plain is good, adding toppings will only improve it.  Have tried all 3 types of pizza and our favorite is the New York style.  The delivery time was reasonable and a little less than stated.  Most importantly, the pizza was hot.  Having to reheat pizza is just annoying."}
{"text":"My delivery order took 1 hour and 30 min. I felt bad for the driver. The person that took my order put down Riverview Avenue , when it should've been Drive. I was very specific that it was White Oak Farms Apartments. It wasn't the driver side since it was written on the slip incorrectly. The food was okay but I had to heat it up."}
{"text":"I tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt - but after numerous wrong orders - the most recent being Superbowl Sunday - and no resolution, I am done with them and will order from Veltre's from now on.  The online ordering is convenient but good luck getting the order right!    Superbowl Sunday I ordered online (it's printed from me, how can you mess it up??) and they not only got my calzone completely wrong (meatball ordered, steak delivered) but they put cheese on my wife's salad, who has a dairy allergy!  We called back and told them the wrong items (which I paid for with paypal, I still have the receipt) and the girl working asked for our name and address - then told us we would have store credit.  I knew better at the time but I took them at their word, and tonight when ordering was told that the owner doesn't do that and the girl working that night is no longer there.  This was the last in a long line of service mishaps that this shop has shown.  Sorry guys - I really liked the food when it was correct - but service is your industry, and that says a lot!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Visiting nearby and had to have a pizza. Used Yelp to locate Fellini's and ordered online a NY Style large pizza. Not only was the pizza delivered quickly the pizza itself was superb. They did the crust just right, and no skimping on the toppings. A must try!"}
{"text":"I've never had a problem with this pizza shop. Google showed they have had a lot of bad reviews. There are so many pizza shops in White Oak. I can not say it is the best but they are really good and decent priced. I've had the garlic spinach and plain. Tonight I'm trying the dirty pie which have a number of different cheeses."}
{"text":"Great yum pizza for a cute date night in with babe or just the girls.. Pizza , pizza party,pizza play date whatever yum pizza"}
{"text":"Defintely the best Pizza in the area. I would have never even found it, had it not been for this Yelp app. I have ordered from every shop within 5 miles of this place and will only order from these guys in the future. It's that good."}
{"text":"Great pizza joint in Monroeville. Classic pizza taste, great sauce, plenty of toppings, nice crispy crust. If you love pizza, you'll love Fellinis. Today was meat lovers, and one half cheese, half black olives."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza I've ever had. I even get it delivered and it's still hot when it gets to my door. They're quick with delivery and the food is good. Their gyro bites/mini gyros (I forget the actual name) are good, too- very filling!"}
{"text":"Average pizza at a decent price.  Would order again, but we are from NY and total pizza snobs.  The sauce, cheese and toppings are good quality but the crust is just mediocre and is a little to thick and bread like."}
{"text":"Have not had my pie yet. Bathroom is disgusting. My sons seat has cob webs on it. Table is tacky with grease. Dust from vents. Burt out lights. Glass door has dirt and more cob webs. But re all there is human poop on the toilet seat. The ceiling tiles show signs of water damage.. This place is dingy and empty. Don't come here for a date even if your on your last buck. I will update this 2 star. Review after tasting it."}
{"text":"Great place to order food from!!   The people I work with order from Fellinis Monroeville A LOT.   The food is always really good.  And it's not just the pizza -- their salads are fresh & very big portions.  Sandwiches have always been good as well.  The delivery drivers are always very polite & nice -even on the days when they deliver to my work multiple times in one day - again my coworkers order from Fellinis a lot!!!   Food always arrives hot if it's supposed to be hot - they are quick to get it to you.   Definitely recommend ordering from here!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza for the area.  I had a veg pizza with the garlic sauce.  It was very neatly made, fresh veggies, crust was tasty, and delivery was quick.  My go-to pizza when I'm in town.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"My grandmother and I ordered a large pizza, breadsticks, and a whole hoagie for $26 with a deal. Not bad pricing, very friendly phone operator and pizza delivery man. The hoagie was phenomenal (my gram wanted to call them to tell them how good it was), the breadsticks and pizza were yummy, the only reason I took a star off was because it took a little before we got the pizza, but we are understandable that there are other orders and things. Thank you Fellini's for being awesome!!"}
{"text":"I did not have a good experience with Fellini's in Penn Hills. I am not the type of person to even typically leave bad reviews like this but my experience was so awful I felt compelled to do so. For starters, we ordered our food around 830 pm and were told it would be ready in 15-20 minutes. I arrived to the pizza shop within that time frame and when I arrived I walked in to two employees (who I later found out their names were Kim and Cory) screaming, swearing at the two men working and storming around the shop. When one of the men asked if my food was ready yet the woman screamed \"no it's not f***ing ready\". Hearing this as a customer already turned me off to this place but I figured I'd sit and wait and see how long it would take. Shortly after that one of them stormed out saying \"if I even have to f***ing come back here I swear..\" And then the second woman followed saying \"I'll gladly get the f*** out of your way\" and they both sped off in a car together. Needless to say - whoever their manager is should maybe speak to them about how they carry themselves and how the way they act reflects on their shop. I was appalled that anyone would be acting that way in their place of work. Then, after waiting maybe an additional 20 minutes my food was ready. Brought it home and found that my pizza (cheeseburger pizza) was not finished. There was no toppings on it just cheese burger meat and onions and the whole crust was burnt. So after the whole drama filled ordeal while waiting for my pizza my order wasn't even correct and by this point it was almost 10 pm and my fiancé had to take the pizza back. The man (didn't catch his name) who was working made us a fresh pizza and gave us a 2 liter for our trouble but really that wasn't able to make up for this terrible experience. We will absolutely not order from here ever again and I think maybe the manager needs to reevaluate his staff and their ability to do their job appropriately and also maybe teach them how to respect their customers."}
{"text":"Pizza was horrible. Onions so burnt they were black strings and chicken tasted frozen. What a joke."}
