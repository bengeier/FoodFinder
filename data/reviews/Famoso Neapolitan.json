{"text":"Walk in to Famoso's new Annex location and there is no mistaking the kind of restaurant you have entered: a popular, loud hang out for students, families and friends alike. It's a casual place with daily deals (movies, cheap wine on Wednesdays, etc.), TVs showing Blue Jays' games and young staff working feverishly to keep up with the sit-in and take-out clientele.  It's got a pleasant, relaxed vibe and people seemed to be rather enjoying themselves.

Once seated in our booth, we perused the menu and our lovely server explained how the restaurant works: you write down your order on the notepad provided, bring it up to the counter and hand it in. You can either pay right away or begin a tab. Any subsequent orders can be placed through the wait staff. I assume this method is effective for those in a hurry, but it did seem a little odd considering how often our server checked in on us. She also expounded upon the \"red sauce\" pizzas made with Campania tomato sauce, fior-de-latte mozzarella, basil and pecorino romano cheese. (The \"white sauce\"pizzas are made with a garlic and olive oil sauce instead of the tomatoes.)

We opted for the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella balls for an appetizer, the funghi tartufo and San Andreas pizzas and, for dessert, the dolce and banana dish. As with any self-respecting pizza place, they had San Pellegrino on the menu so got an Aranciata (my fave) and a Limonata. My dining companion kindly took the order the counter while I scoped out the huge place before me. Famoso has really nice exposed brick walls, comfortable booths and, by my count, at least three staff members per table. There are a lot of eyes on tables and not much gets missed. The staff is universally nice, if perhaps inexperienced. It lacked a certain finesse, but made up for it in sweet charm.

Our appetizer arrived and I'm glad we asked for salt, pepper and chili flakes. The mozzarella balls were tasty, but the red sauce (which would appear later on our funghi pizza) was very, very sweet. For my liking, too sweet.  A dash of salt and some chili flakes were necessary and helped considerably. I was hoping for crispier prosciutto, too; as a start to the meal, it was pretty average. If you're going to get an appetizer, I would recommend you try a salad. They looked fresh and tasty.

Our funghi  tartufo pizza arrived fairly shortly afterward. It consisted of roasted white mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, truffle oil and parmiggiano reggiano.  Again, it was better with the salt and chili flakes.  The crusts at Famoso are a bit thicker than is the trend right now, but I liked the chewier texture. I only wish that this pizza had been left in the 900-degree oven a little longer as it needed a little more crispiness to counter the soft, melting cheese that was starting to soak through the crust. (A note: I took a slice of this one home and had it two days later. I have to say, it tasted much better as a leftover!)

Our second pizza - the San Andreas - was a \"New World Pizza\" with a white sauce, chili-lime marinated chicken and fresh mozzarella. It was then baked and topped with avocado slices, diced roma tomatoes, onion, cilantro, a drizzle of cream and a lime wedge. Certainly not traditional, but pretty darned tasty. The pizza seemed to have stayed in the oven just that little bit longer and had that nice char on the bottom. The lime juice provided a bright flavour and the chicken was tender. (I'd have liked a little more chicken, but that's a bit of a nitpick. It was a good pizza.) Were I to go back, I would steer my companions toward it if they wanted to try something a little different.

Finally, dessert. This was my favourite dish of the four we tried. A long, rectangular plate of roasted bananas coated in caramelized brown sugar, topped with pecans and caramel sauce and a scoop of ice cream in the middle arrived at the table and my eyes widened. This looked and smelled fantasti and tasted even better. The bananas were piping hot and creamy and contrasted beautifully with the crunch of the sugar and the chill of the ice cream. That dish was devoured in what had to be record time.

Overall, Famoso is...fine. There isn`t anything in particular that stands out but there isn't anything egregiously wrong with it, either.  It caters to a wide variety of tastes so it is sure to be a good option if you are going out with a group with varying tastes or dietary restrictions or preferences. Do not bother with the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella balls, but do not skip dessert."}
{"text":"gorgonzola walnut salad = NOT recommended
pizza = pretty good, but nothing spectacular
dolce banana = HIGHLY recommended

service was slow and unorganized.  but they were friendly, which made up for all their mistakes.

if you're debating between the nutella pizza and the dolce banana, go for the dolce banana!  it's got all the textures you're looking for: gooey sauce, warm and slightly crisped bananas sprinkled with bits of nuts.  and don't forget the cold gelato scoop on top. perfection!  nutella pizza was excellent too, but you'll regret not getting the dolce banana once you see people around you eating it."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place due to rave reviews from a friend. I do like this restaurant, but I find the food to be mediocre.  I ordered the lunch special: Margherita pizza,  and added mushrooms and cherry tomatoes ($1) for each add on.  I chose the tomato bisque as a side.  I found the pizza to be okay: the pizza was soggy,  and I would have appreciated it to be served a bit warmer than it was.  Great size though,  it was just enough to make me full after having the soup as well. The soup,  on the other hand,  was quite good.  The service was friendly,  and the interior is comfortable and not too noisy. I would come again, just because of the decent pricing and because I live close by.  However,  I will be looking for another pizza restaurant with a more  solid tasting slice."}
{"text":"The best pizza I have ever eaten and it was gluten free! The server was friendly too!"}
{"text":"Trying to eat a vegan pizza out in the streets has been a challenge for a while, but lately more and more places are realizing that they could gain a fan base with the vegans in the city if they would just offer options

Along comes Famoso Neapolitan! This place, with its weird ordering system (which to be honest we don't mind...) is very very accommodating when it comes to removing the cheese and add its vegan version. We can create our own style of pizza without any problems and the results are incredible
They also have amazing sorbets.  vegan pizza plus dessert in a non-vegan restaurant? *Heaveeeeen*

We also don't mind the low cost movie tickets that can be purchased with a regular pizza, the even lower ticket if you go on a Tuesday and in general, the goodies that come now and then

oh! and it's very child friendly which we love! :)"}
{"text":"Oopsie.
Went with the family - 4 adults, 1 toddler - and ordered one large pizza, 3 pizzettas [2 of them with salads] and a couple of drinks.  So far so good.
Then dessert: 3 separate orders of gelato plus an affogato [espresso with gelato] and an americano.
Again, so far so good.
And then the bill.
Kids get their scoop of gelato for free if they've ordered a pizzetta.
Considering the amount of food and drink we'd ordered, I just assumed that would be the case for us.
But no.
The toddler actually had to order the pizzetta and eat it herself - no sharing.
Hmmm.
We obviously ordered enough food to go around for all, and I think they mishandled this.
So, next time, we'll place our orders and put everything in front of the kid, and then make sure we get that scoop for free.
Game on!"}
{"text":"Been here so many times! Great place to catch up with a friend on a weeknight. Chill and relaxed atmosphere with great service!

Always good. Every single time I tell myself I will try something new and I just end up getting the Funghi pizza. Also salted caramel gelato is amazing. 

My sister had her birthday dinner here - hosted 12+ people on a busy Friday evening - and they were so lovely and accommodating."}
{"text":"I've been to this new spot probably a half a dozen times already, but the service is starting to do that sliding downhill thing that seems to happen to so many places after the first few weeks.

The food is good - gelato is amazing and a refreshing change from the obscene amount of \"fro-yo\" in the area.  Pizza is good - a bit underdone for me but still good.

Service is usually okay, although last time I went with my partner we were more than a little disappointed. I ordered the Sofia and asked for no mushrooms (I have an allergy) and no onions. I was told that the peppers and onions are pre-mixed and cooked so they couldn't do the sandwich without the onion - disappointing, as things seem a bit less fresh when they've been precooked (and this place is all about 'freshness'.)  I was told that no mushrooms would be fine.

When I got my sandwich it had mushrooms on it. There were tons of staff but no one came over to ask how our meal was, and the staff seemed to just be bumping into each other.  I picked the mushrooms off my sandwich since no one seemed available, and our server clearly saw them on my plate and said nothing.
Also ,we had ordered a pepsi and a ginger ale when we first ordered. I asked our server when our appetizers arrived about our drinks and she said they'd be right out. Then the mains came and we asked about our drinks again and she said she'd get them...sort of looking annoyed. Halfway through lunch and they still weren't there, so I asked again. Still nothing. 
Finally, I went up to the counter and let them know we were almost finished and still hadn't gotten our drinks (we had also asked for water which never came).  The girl at the counter apologized and said she'd make them right up.  I watched them sit on the counter a good 5 minutes before someone picked them up and brought them over (by that time we were done.) Then we went to pay and the drinks were on the tab twice.
It was an irritating experience to say the least. Overstaffed that leads to disorganization and a lot of near-mishaps via staff bumping into each other.
The food is also pretty pricey for what it is. They have some promotional days but mostly for alcohol like sangria, not for food. Maybe they need to think about a prixe fixe? And some additional appetizers that don't rely on the same dough they use for the pizza crust.
It's a shame, because the spot had a lot of draw, especially since I'm doors away. Unfortunately, they just don't have enough to offer, especially for a place with as much to choose from (in reasonable price ranges) as the Annex."}
{"text":"Famoso was the first place my boyfriend and I went to together. It is now the standard to which we hold other restaurants to when we dine out. The service was great. We were seated as soon as a table was available, we got our food and drinks in good time, staff was courteous and helpful and its a nice touch when the manager comes by to ask how your evening has been. We used a Groupon for our meal and weren't treated any differently, which we have been in other establishments. The ambience was perfect! The restaurant has an atmosphere that does allow for intimate dining with the music and lighting for dinner.

If I could, I'd be rating this place a 6/5. It's just that great."}
{"text":"Came in here with a Groupon and were given excellent service. Good atmosphere for a quick lunch/dinner.
Two of us ordered the pork meatballs appetizers and the Siciliana and Vesuvio pizzas. Both pizzas were really good but the meatball appetizers came lukewarm. The Vesuvio was a little spicy for my liking but was more flavourful of the two pizzas. 
I'd definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Vey tasty indeed!  Went here for the first time tonight with a friend and will be going back!  Love that Daiya cheese is an option.  I made my own pizza and the toppings were all fresh and delish.  Highly recommend and I know I will be back!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is excellent.  It's just as good or better than the trendier and supposedly cooler places such as Terroni and Libretto.  I'm not concerned if they're a small chain with a somewhat standardized system. It's quality, period.  And unlike the trendier places, they don't gouge for wine so the bill is actually reasonable, unlike most places in this city."}
{"text":"Awful.  Really overrated restaurant.  Poor service; they shorted us on the appetizers, and then claimed it was our fault for mis-counting mush which was supposed to be a piece of food.  Pizza dough is tough and under seasoned.  Everything is really over priced.  We've been 3 times, but we're officially done giving this place chances.  Never again."}
{"text":"This place is rad! Service is on point. Everyone is really nice and the pizza is awesome!! Seriously, that spicy oil is the tits. Do it. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I am not sure why, in a city with a vibrant and exciting pizza culture, this franchise that does exactly what franchises do best ( read homogenize and dull down) has relevance.  the service system is weird, the pizza just okay, and the offerings are just sort of interesting. the decor is nice, and the place is very.... well its the applebees of neopolitan pizza, by design, so, yeah its boring. 

i see this being a big hit in stouville, or ajax, but it feels very out of place in the annex."}
{"text":"Food was great and very inexpensive. 

We ordered the smaller size pizzas which were the perfect single serving along with a 9oz glass of wine. 

Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"We love this place.
Its cheap, food is excellent and they can accommodate small and large crowds. 
They have a tomato bisque that will rock your world. 
We've taken several friends and family members here and no one has ever been dissapointed. 
I highly recommend it for a nice casual feed."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night with a friend and it was pretty busy, we had to wait around 20 minutes for a table for two. I really enjoyed the décor and ambiance of the whole place as I walked in, it was very warm and pleasant. 

Famoso has a weird system where you have to order your first dish at the cash register instead of at your table, but can order subsequent dishes and drinks at your table through your waiter or waitress. They explain what you have to do if you are confused, but they never really explain why they need to do it. 

We decided to split the Mediterranean bread sticks, which are bread sticks that use half the dough of a regular size pizza, with dipping sauces. The bread sticks tasted the same as the base and crust of the pizza and were very soft and delicious, if a little heavy for two people.
  
I got an Abruzzo pizza which has sausage, onions, mushrooms, and mozzarella while my friend got the spicy Thai, a \"new world\" pizza with peanut sauce, chicken, carrots, bean sprouts, and peanuts. The Abruzzo came recommended by the waitress and was delicious, particularly the sausage. The Spicy Thai pizza was very unique, but I didn't think the carrot sticks really fit the rest of the pizza. It's a dish which has potential but requires more experimentation.  

The service was very friendly and we got our pizza a lot faster than we expected. 

Overall, it was pretty good value and I will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"My feelings about the staff and the ordering system seem to be consistent with all the other reviews here: weird, strange ordering system that still seems to rely on servers nearly as much AND incredibly nice servers. 

That being said, the food? Incredibly blah. 

My companion and I ordered two pizzettas: a Margherita and a Vesuvio (spicy salami). 

The first slice I took...and already the pizza was soggy and sagging from the toppings. What were they thinking? Thin crust pizza cannot be overloaded with tomato sauce, let alone WATERY tomato sauce. It was disgusting. 

I hate soggy pizza. 

After eating for 5-10 minutes, the rest of the slices proceeded to get soggier and then I just stopped eating them. 

Is it 'cause we ordered the half-sized pizzas and not the whole ones? I have no idea why that would make a difference, because proportion-wise, it should not have changed how much went on the pizza, the wateriness of the tomato sauce, etc. 

Really, really disappointed. So bland-tasting. 

A real shame too, because it's a nice lookin' place and the server we had was so darn nice."}
{"text":"I have been dying for Famoso to open in Toronto. When I first moved to Canada, I lived in Calgary and the Famoso on 4th was just down the road from where I was living. Now I'm settled in Toronto and there's a Famoso right by me again. Hurray!

Famoso prides itself in producing traditional neapolitan style pizza, which is entirely different to the New York style pizza that's more common around these parts. For this reason, the first thing the waitress will ask you (I noticed this in Calgary, too) is if you've had neapolitan pizza before. I guess they don't want people to expect one thing and get something very different. The second thing your waitress will tell you about is Famoso's unique way of serving you. You seat yourself (anywhere there's room) and there are menus at your table (as well as at the counter). You decide what you want and take your order to the counter where a barista (this is what they call them) will ring it in. You can pay then or leave your tab open. After that, it's full service. Your server will bring your food to your table, take any additional orders for food, drinks, desserts and bring you your bill (if you haven't already paid). 

We ordered a margherita pizza and a couple of desserts. The pizza arrived very quickly, which was great because we were starving. They're roughly 11\" in size, but they also do a half-size pizzetta if you're looking for something a little more lunch-sized or a single serving.

The crust was nice and light and very thin in the middle. Be warned: Definitely a knife and fork approach as opposed to hands. The gooey cheese, juicy sauce and paper-thin crust makes for a messy finger food experience otherwise. The toppings are fresh and tasty and the tomato sauce isn't too robust in its flavour. It provides a strong tomato base without over-powering the individual toppings or the cheese. Our margherita, despite being pretty basic by nature, wasn't at all bland or boring. They also have Parmesan and chili pepper flakes. These are a nice touch, but not necessary in my opinion.

For dessert we ordered the Nutella and banana pizzetta and three scoops of gelato. The Nutella pizzetta is pizza crust smothered in Nutella and dressed up with whipped cream. If you opt for the banana option, you'll get a folded pizza crust stuffed with Nutella and banana. This is very, very good in a basic comfort food kind of way. There's nothing altogether impressive about it, but it does hit the spot and is in no way disappointing. They have an assortment of gelato flavours, though the fact that these are printed right onto the menu leads me to believe they won't change too often. We went for salted caramel, cappuccino, and banana chocolate. All three were smooth and creamy, though the salted caramel seemed to melt extremely fast. 

Price-wise, we paid $31 (including tax) for the two desserts and Famoso's Pizza & Movie deal. This allows you to get a margheita and a free movie pass for $16 or, alternatively, you can add $6 to any other pizza on the menu and get the same deal. The margherita usually costs $11, so you're getting a bit of a discount, while other pizzas on the menu range between $11 and $15. For the desserts we paid $5.50 for three scoops of Gelato and $6 for the Nutella & banana pizzetta.

Over all a good experience but I'm eager to go back again and sample something other than their basic margherita. We actually ordered a second pizza (italian ham and pineapple) but it never arrived. We checked with our waitress and she said it had never been added to our bill and wasn't on the way, so we decided to just leave it (we decided we had more than enough for two people with a single pizza). She said they're still working out some kinks and confusion with the till and apologised. We weren't too bothered, especially since the girl who took my order looked to be getting some on the job training at the time, so I'll reserve my judgment for the second visit!"}
{"text":"I came here because I saw a sign outside that  offered Daiya cheese.  Which... is an extremely tasty vegan cheese.  I had a pizza, it was so loaded with ingredients though, and I didn't realize substitutions were an option.

I liked it so much that when I saw a groupon, I bought it, no problem.  I went with a friend and we ordered 3 pizza, one each and one to share.  I had the thai, peanut,  chicken and it was soooo friken, chicken good!!  My friend had the primavera, which is what I had the first time I went.  And then we ordered another primavera but I switched the olives and something else for  pineapple and arugula.   That switch turned out to be better than their choice.

We had all three pies, with the Daiya cheese.

This was an awesome eating experience.  It was dinner time, the place was packed and we took our sweet time eating.  I savored every bite.

The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, the place has a good vibe, it was a bit noisy but I think it was because of all the people.  Service is quick and efficient.  The food came quick. 

Besides my favorite pizza place - (Peter's Cajun Creole Pizza), this is now my second favorite pizza place in Toronto."}
{"text":"I crave this place all the time! Mostly for the fresh ingredients they use in everything they make. Their caesar salad is delicious- I always get a big one to share with my boyfriend. If I had to eat one type of pizza for the rest of my life... I would pick any pizza from their menu."}
{"text":"This has been a great place to check out if you want to just go for a coffee, dessert or a meal.  Service is incredibly friendly, and helpful, and food is there for you before you can even think about the time passing... 

The pizza is not greasy, and has a delicious thin crust with fresh ingredients! I tried the prosciutto arugula pizzeta with a caesar salad and it was all fantastic, and just enough to fill me up, without feeling disgusting.  Plus various desserts and gelatos make the trip to eat their worth it.  

I would definitely recommend people to check this place out, and its all at a reasonable price :)."}
{"text":"Famoso definitely does not have the best pizza in town, or even the Annex for that matter.  I found their food to be underwhelming.  The pizzas are smaller than other Neapolitan style restaurants, and they definitely skimp on the ingredients.   I also didn't like how you have to order yourself at the cash, it is slightly awkward and confusing.  They also seemed to have a crazy amount of staff so it felt really unecessary for the customer to be doing the work of the server.  

Since the restaurant is relatively new, and I love pizza, I was very excited to try it, but I felt quite let down.  To be honest I don't think I would eat there again.  

I would recommend Diverso by Ferrero instead if you are looking for pizza in the Annex."}
{"text":"Decent pizza for the price. Went there with a date, we had the Margherita (with added roasted mushrooms and cheery tomatoes) and Pepperoni. 

The Margherita could have benefited from a little more time in the oven so next time I'll ask for well done. Otherwise pretty good."}
{"text":"Appearance: The restaurant had a rustic feel dressed in a modern motif. Beautiful establishment. 

Staff: The staff was very courteous and quick. We were served with a smile and they were able to answer any questions we had accurately. 

Food: We both had the Margherita Pizza. It's a thin crust Pizza made in a modern stone oven. It was very well done and it is very well priced. 

Overall: Great food in a great place. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I went there last weekend for lunch, the staff were friendly and helpful in explaining their ordering system. 
We ordered the caprese salad, prosciutto wrapped mozzarella balls & the Sicilian pizza. I've had my fair share of caprese salads and this one was nothing special. The pizza was one of the worst pizzas I've ever had, it was soggy on the bottom and burnt on the top. BUT the mozzarella balls were a-maze-ing, definitely the highlight of our meal.
It wasn't the worst restaurant experience, but I don't ever see myself going back for round 2."}
{"text":"I echo a number of other reviews here.  Their pizza isn't spectacular.  I'm not sure how they won a Best Pizza in Canada award in 2010.  

It is definitely better than Pizza Pizza, 241, Gino's, etc.  But for the price, you would expect better.  I was hoping from something close to Queen Margherita or Libretto.  Maybe their suppliers out west (where they started) are better, but for a franchise who is VPN inspired, you would think they would have a better quality San Marzano sauce, cheese, and a better yeast.

I also wanted to echo those who mentioned that they have a bizarre ordering system.  First off, it's awkward.  Secondly, I'm never sure how much to tip because I had to write stuff down on paper and take it to the cashier.  I already did half your job.  Am I being generous by tipping 15% or am I a cheapskate?

I think they must have started out well.  I just hope they don't go the way of most franchised pizza places and slowly let their quality slide.

I will check in again next year in hopes of the Best Pizza in Canada 2014.  Somehow I'm sure I will be underwhelmed."}
{"text":"SOO GOOD HERE! I ordered a pepperoni pizza and a Nutella pizza for desert and this place is to die for the pizza is amazing. The bread is thick and they make it right in front of you! It is absolutely child friendly and has a fun and good menu! I recommend it 100%"}
{"text":"VERY disappointing to say the least. 
This review is strictly looking from a vegan perspective. I was walking down bloor street one day to see a sign that read vegan pizzas. Went in one day to try for the first time and I really liked the dining style concept and was instantly excited.
Then I open the menu and saw no area designated to vegan specifically, which was a shocker since if you have a sign on the street stating you have the best vegan pizzas wouldn't you want a section of the menu strictly dedicated to a vegan menu, at least have 1 pizza that you don't have to make substitutions for. 
Anywho, the ordering process took much longer than expected since making a vegan pizza with them is a difficult task. After spending much time ordering, the pizza came and it was just bland, nothing special. I consider the vegan pizza from pizzaiolo much better and you don't have to go through a long process or wait long either. 
Would never go back."}
{"text":"This place is good to go for a night out with friends. It's not somewhere I would go for a nice dinner, but I do have to commend them on having a chain that doesn't feel as much like a chain as I expected. The bellinis were pretty good, and the basil mojitos were quite good. My party all enjoyed their pizzas - I especially liked the crust - although they are a bit greasy and are quite large, so don't try to eat all of one yourself. The ordering system is a bit weird, but it wasn't off-putting. It's central, reasonably priced, and has tables appropriate for large groups, so it's ideal for a birthday or gathering. I'll likely return."}
{"text":"Be of Italian background, I can get very picky when eating at Italian restaurants. But Famoso really lives up to the hype. Located in the Annex, its a warm little restaurant with some great seating and even better food. 

There's quite the variety of Italian food to check out. I would especially recommend their pizza or sandwiches. The staff is super friendly and the decor really gives it a cozy little vibe. If you're looking for your next great spot to bring friends or a date, I would definitely recommend checking out Famoso Neapolitan."}
{"text":"After checking out the menu for my trip to Calgary, I was excited to see a location opening up in annex. Made my way over on an overcast Sunday and the trip was definitely worth it! 

Service is great on Sunday afternoons as they are quiet around lunch time. Very laid back atmosphere with a lot of wood themed furniture. 

The pizzetta is great as it is a nice smaller alternative to these otherwise overwhelming dish. Had to try the margherita as it is a classic. 

The dough is nicely crisped by the high heat yet retains a soft core which plays very well with the sweet tomato sauce and amazingly sweet mozzarella! All of this is balanced by the intense basil and my own addition of chili flakes. 

Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Family friendly and quick service. Deserts are great too. Love the mushroom pizza and Cesar salad. They switch up their gelato flavours fairly regularly so there is always something to try."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group including two small kids and they were quite accommodating. The custom way to order pizza was not confusing (some of the other reviews suggested it was so I'm just throwing out my experience). The pizza options were varied. I had a pizza with fior-di-latte, oyster mushrooms, and pineapple. I liked the option of oyster mushrooms a lot although the pineapple was \"crushed\" style and I prefer large chunks.

Overall a fine experience, good for the whole family and friends, though there are better options in the area for a date."}
{"text":"Étrange mélange entre un restaurant de moyenne gamme et un système de commande à la fast-food. Vous consultez le menu, à peine visible car imprimé  en noir sur fond brun, puis vous passez à la caisse pour découvrir le même menu illuminé. 

La pizza? Pas mal, pâte très fine comme la pizza napolitaine, des choix très variés et ça se mange bien. Consommation alcoolisée possible, chose rare pour une pizzeria en général alors commandez votre Birra Moreti pour être dans l'ambiance !"}
{"text":"While the staff are attractive young ladies, the service and system for ordering is fundamentally scattered. The food was sub-par especially considering the price. If you want plain food but hot girls and high prices come eat here. I would recommend any other Italian place if you are in the mood."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourite places to eat in. My wife and I always go for their 10$ lunch special, a margarita pizza and the tomato bisque soup. We love it! The inside of the place is clean and modern. The facilities are impeccable and the general cleanliness of the restaurant as well. The vibe is laid back and the speed of service is exemplary. If your hungry for a a great pizza and a chill environment, look no further."}
{"text":"I live close by so my boyfriend and I decided to try this place out. We ended up waiting about 15 minutes until being seated (nobody noticed us waiting for a good fifteen minutes). We ordered the mozzarella balls to start - they were mediocre (the sauce being the hit). We also had the capriccioa pizza. The pizza was flimsy, and overall I wasn't blown away by the flavours. It tasted bland, under seasoned, and the sauce was runny.
I've tasted better pizza, even from Metro. We weren't offered/brought any water during our entire meal. We had to flag down a waitress to ask for dessert (we saw \"authentic tiramisu\" on the menu and decided to try it). The waitress asked if we wanted the tiramisu with chocolate or whipped cream on the side and recommended we try the chocolate - so we said OK. The tiramisu arrived, drizzled with copious amounts of chocolate sauce AKA Nesquik syrup (the kind of artificial syrup you mixed into milk as a kid). It was very unpleasant and completely overpowered the dessert (which did not taste authentic). We felt the overall vibe was very rushed, 3-4 different waitresses came to our table so we didn't feel that \"personable\" experience. Initially stepping into this place, it felt like a low key pizzeria-lounge, but it was loud and amiss. Not a good experience unfortunately."}
{"text":"Famoso if you're reading this, please please please make the soups warmer, it was room temperature at best. It's such a good soup, it deserves the attention, this isn't the first time :("}
{"text":"Favourite pizza place in Toronto! You can't go wrong with the Primavera. The pizzetta with a side salad is the perfect meal. Bonus: Famoso caters to people who eat vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free."}
{"text":"If you are in the Annex and want to have a sit-down pizza meal... not sit on a stool or stand in the street with a sloppy greasy slice of Za in your hand, Famoso is a good option.

There's lots of seating and I like the booths.
The servers are very friendly but the ordering system here is confusing!

* The menus are at the table when you sit down.
* You are supposed to write down your order or go to the cash and tell them what you want
* They open a tab and a server will bring your bill to you at the end of your meal
* You can request tap water at the cash, but shouldn't they just bring us water?

Are the servers there for smiles or service? Or both? Too confusing!

We started with the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella balls for an appetizer.  
It looked different than expected! Smothered with tomato sauce and some sort of crust/pita for dipping.  The tomato was fresh and a bit tart.  I sort wish it was more cheese and less sauce.

We split a sweet BBQ pizza.  ($14) Good size for two people.
The crust was chewy and crispy.  Lots of BBQ sauce, I think there was chicken somewhere and lots of tomatoes.

The affogato was good.  Simple. Gelato with a shot of expresso.  ($6.50)

Overall, I like this place.  Sure ordering is a bit more work, but it's conveniently located, I can get a table when I'm hungry, and they have deals where you can get a movie ticket for $6 bucks with a pizza! 

Also, they do have interesting toppings for pizzas and the dessert pizzas looked like a whole lot of deliciousness."}
{"text":"Use to be way better 4-5 years ago. Overcrowded for the space and they need to update their table wait system.

Didn't bother even eating there when they screwed up our wait. Plenty of great pizza joints in town that customer service cannot wane: competition is intense."}
{"text":"They are friendly. It wasn't busy but the service is not user friendly. Specially at night and dim light. It was hard if you plan to make your own. You can go wild and write down all the selection  which it was a lot by the. Then you discovered you can't do it due fiscal limitations on how much you can put on. They offered to speak to the kitchen to help. Now I don't know how much they will charge due to I didn't get all what I ask for. By the way I tired the tiramisu. It was OK. I don't recommend it. I got the bill. It end up cost me  $20 pizza. I personally I don't think they put the much different topping than regular cheese pizza. I was expecting no more than $15. Anyway I learned."}
{"text":"Less than mediocre. I'd rather eat Amatos. I'll stick with North of Brooklyn for slices."}
{"text":"I love this place!  They have a big brick oven where you can watch them make your pizza.  It took a while for us to get seated, even though there was space, so I am not sure why there was a wait.  The pizza was really yummy though!  They also had a live band playing, which was really nice.  It's not a fancy place, but still makes for a nice date night."}
{"text":"Where's this love y'all?

I will confess outright that I have some minor bias, since this is literally the place that taught me what real pizza is (vs that cardboard stuff they serve in fast food chains), and the place where I first fell in love with said pizza. But the fact that it has this power and that even after some recent pizza-hunting it is still my favourite place I think makes this place fully deserving of my every star (and every friend that I've sent running to this place).

Food versus price score: 5/5
I always get a margherita pizza, usually with olives and/or mushrooms. Basil, tomato, and cheese. It can't go wrong.
Though admittedly, the cavoletti pizza (white sauce with cheese, dates, brussel sprouts, walnuts, honey, proscuitto) might have been (gasp) even better. The combination of sweet and salty and awesome was perfect. 
I've also had the quattro formaggi, which was also delicious.
Pizzas are not too greasy (as I've sadly found in other places), crust is thick enough to have bite while still being thin enough to be crispy. Prices are average $12-15, and it's big enough to split with a small friend, but I doubt you'll want to do that. Just pick (at least) one each and have some of each.
Oh, and I should probably mention. $20 off a bottle of the wine special on Wednesdays. Nbd.

Service & Ambiance: 5/5
Service is always friendly and was even completely chill about my friend and I staying well past closing. The decor is very chill in a wood-and-dim-lighting kind of way. And again. The wine. $20 off a bottle special. It might have (probably) made the ambiance more wonderful than it already was.

I will be back too often for my own good, and most likely on Wednesdays.

*EDIT: after a few more recent visits, I've sadly come to the conclusion that their pizza is not always consistent. Sometimes it is indeed a bit soggy, which is really a bit of a downer for pizza. Nevertheless, it is still my favourite pizza place around, in large part because of its Wednesday wine specials; after all, Italian food without red wine is only half the story."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Love the wood burning oven and how the pizza cooks so fast. Have never had to wait long for my food and it is always delicious. The nutella pizza for dessert is amazing too....my absolute favourite dessert."}
{"text":"We came here with a Groupon, and came on a Tuesday night.

Tuesdays: You can get a movie pass with your dinner for $6.  Not bad.
Wednesdays: Get $15 off some wine bottles.  Very not bad.

Ambience was neat: the strange thing is, you have to walk up to the cashier to put your order in.  After that, it's table service.  It's a neat place, like a sports bar mixed with Neapolitan style pizza, with pitchers of beer and bottles of wine available.  Based on that, I was really excited to be there.  Also, this place is loud.  It didn't help that this guy behind me was talking extra loud because of loudness.

Service: It was good.  She came and refilled our waters regularly and checked in on us.

Food: Inconsistent.  My pizza tasted good, I'd say 3.5 out of 5.  But I'd rather eat at other Neapolitan style pizzas around the city than here.  Picea, Libretto, Queen Margherita, etc.

After I finished my pizza, my wife couldn't finish hers.  So, I stepped in: pinch-eater.  Sadly, she never tasted my pizza, and when I tried hers: it was awful.  The tomato sauce had no taste, it was mushy, and had clumps of raw garlic and patches of salt.

In summary: Never say never, but the only reason I'd come here is if we were stuck in going there.  E.g. weather and every other place is full/unavailable, friends really want to go, etc.  Hopefully others have/had better experiences than we did."}
{"text":"- good substitute for libretto in the annex that does not require you waiting for over an hour just to get a seat.
- pizza was pretty solid. not orgasmic, but very very solid. 
- tried the margharita and the conforto (Italian sausage, roasted mushrooms, roasted red peppers) which was pretty dang tasty. even good the next morning for breakfast
- cool thing is that they have a pizza and movie deal where you can also buy a cineplex odeon movie ticket for just $5 or $6 bucks!!! 
- they have a gelato station at their cash with some really good lookin frozen awesomeness too"}
{"text":"They have an interesting menu. I had the thai spicy pizza which was like pad thai on pizza and the flavours didnt work for me. My friend had the korean bbq pizza, which tasted sweet so that didnt work for us either. Great ambience though."}
{"text":"Got takeout. Sweet Thai pizzetta, lactose free option. Loved the taste, daiya, dough, but get when you want something light (lool for pizza options). I was rather hungry though, so 4/5 stars. Will eat here again."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere! We went for the live jazz on Wednesday night. We loved everything about this place. It's a unique set-up where you walk up to the counter to order once you've decided, but the waiter brings your food to your table and the service is great thereafter. The food is very fresh and the make it all in an open kitchen. The pizza was delicious and the tiramisu was to die for! Will be back for more! Great jazz band!"}
{"text":"Just average to me. Its a nice place and all, but the pizza was just average. We got the korean bbq pozza, which was very intersting and tasty, but there was not a lot of meat, which was the only topping, meaning it was almost just sauce and dough. We also got the capriccio pizza, which was loaded with toppings, but didnt have much flavour on top of that. Im not doscouraging anyone from coming here at all; if youre in the area and hear good things, then by all means stop by. Im simply saying there are better pizzas for that price point."}
{"text":"Let me just say that I like Pizza enough to have purchased the paraphernalia required to make it properly at home so I'm an informed reviewer in this case. 

This place does NOT deserve the high score that it gets. I think that these kinds of places attract a biased review because they offer \"authentic\" Italian pizzas. Well, you know what, I think that pizza in Italy is overrated too. Italians may have invented Pizza but I think that North American's perfected the art!

The pizzas here are really uninspired and perhaps the purists among you think that simplicity and tradition are what's most important. Well, I beg to differ. I like inventiveness, unique topping, experimentation, and above all else, I like to feel that I get what I pay for. At Famoso, the prices do not justify the servings.

If you have a milquetoast palet and like bland pizza, this is your place. If you want a bit of adventure, then go explore the city and find some of the people who have a bit more passion for this kind of food."}
{"text":"My brother raves about this place and took me to the Calgary location. I figured I would introduce my roommate to it and we headed to Bloor St. The service was fast and friendly and our waitress was more than happy to give recommendations and discuss the drink specials. I got the Abruzzo pizza and it was delicious! Lots of topping and thin crust which I like and the 16\" allows for leftovers. The place was also super clean and the atmosphere while busy, was cozy and fun. I would recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"Nothing special here. It took about 10 minutes to be seated, which is annoying when I consider the fact that there was adequate staff and lots of seating.  Our host preferred to arrange silverware rather than walk and seat us at the empty table 2 feet away, so we could at least have a deink while we wait. Bad first impression to say the least.

On the upside, they had 5$ sleeves of beer and a few craft brew options. As someone who bakes their own pizza, my standards are higher and weren't exactly met. The dough was the right amount of thin, but lacked flavour and even had a little charcoal taste to it (maybe clean the oven a little more regularly?). The sauce was quite tasty though. I had the margarita pizza - I figured it would be best to judge it based on a classic. In terms of price, it was just slightly above average.

I wouldn't not go back, but it certainly wouldn't be my first choice. In short, the service was subpar and the pizza was just averagoso! ;)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here - not only for the amazing and fresh food but the staff are so good at what they do! I am always treated so well and the food comes out piping hot! 

The wine list is really good too!"}
{"text":"The food here is always great and the service can't be beat anywhere else in Toronto. I've come here with my friends, family and boyfriend many times. The ambiance is perfect for all occasions and I have celebrated a birthdays here as well. While they are known for their pizza, I would recommend giving the pasta a try as it is equally delicious. The food is also well priced, the pizzas and pastas are top quality yet not crazy expensive."}
{"text":"Just because the ordering system/service is different at Famoso Neapolitan, why do you guys gotta knock it down? Instead, maybe you Yelpers should just call yourself, LAZY! ...Just sayin. Oh and by the way, how we order food here isn't that different from Marche. Which has been around for ages. So I guess Famoso's customer ordering style isn't that different after all...

I had the half sized funghi tartufo pizza & half sized capreze salad. This pizza portion was larger than I expected which is always a plus. (I'm always pleasantly surprised by larger than expected! LOL!)  My complaint about the pizza is the sogginess in the middle. However, despite the larger than expected size and sogginess, it was damn tasty enough for me to finish the whole thing! And I rarely finish the whole thing of anything.

Ambiance and service was great. Casual, inviting and classy. The volume and choice of (house) music was perfect and the staff were nice and friendly.

I WILL BE BACK! Especially because there are definitely other items on the menu I NEED TO TRY! The prosciutto wrapped mozzarella balls, cavoletti (white pizza), the spicy thai pizza, the salted caramel gelato, the dolce & banana dessert and the banana nutella pizza.... Hmmm... Sounds like I gotta make at least another 2 trips back to try all that I want!"}
{"text":"The Hubster and I came here for dinner, forever chasing the Neapolitan pizza dragon. The pizza was fine. I had the Abruzzo with no cheese (they have the option for Daiya, but I decided against it). It was okay, but.. stay with me here... too many toppings. I just found it a bit overwhelming. The Hubster had the Diavola, which he greatly enjoyed. 

Service was friendly, and the place was packed on a Saturday evening. 

The place was fine, but nothing really stood out for me."}
{"text":"In my quest for the ultimate Neapolitan pizza, this place sits squarely in the middle of the pack. Pretty good but not great. The pizza was a bit undercooked and that gave it a gummy sort of texture that sticks In your teeth.  Despite that, it had enough structure to be picked up from the first bite- no soggy middle here!

It seems like they are trying to marry the taste and texture of Neapolitan with the split the difference, giving you with the heaping amount of toppings and thick with cheese found on standard pizzas.  I prefer the real deal."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic. Great, great pizza. I can't say enough about it. Fresh, quality ingredients, and every pizza on the menu is delicious. 

The have more traditional pizzas, as well as \"New World\" pizzas and there's something to satisfy every palette. 

The only reason they lose a star is the weird ordering style. You have to order at the counter, like fast food, but after you order there, everything else is full service from the waiter/waitress at your table. 

They also have great specials every night if the week. 

And it's super inexpensive for gourmet pizza. Do yourself a favour and come try it!

One of the best places to eat in the Annex!"}
{"text":"After having come here on two separate occasions, both for the lunch special, I'd give this place a 3.5 star rating.

I had the chance to try the Margherita, Quatro Formaggi, Pepperoni + Roasted Mushroom, and Italian Ham + Pineapple pizzas. It's hard to say which one was my favourite because they were all unique in their own way but I can definitely say that my least faourite was the margherita, because I felt it was under-cooked. While the crust was already starting to get burnt, the center of the pizza was still very mushy and had a slight flour-textured taste.  

The service was wonderful though, and I loved the way they did their presentation, which was to serve both the pizza and the salad on a wooden platter. The Napoli Salad was also a great touch that was more fresh and healthy than the standard Casear salad. I enjoyed that it had chickpeas and cherry tomatoes."}
{"text":"The Abruzza pizza was great, loved the flavorful toppings and the crust was nice and chewy! Only complaint would be that yes, the middle of the pizza was slightly soggy and not as crispy as I hoped. Otherwise, good pizza.

The fruity alcoholic drinks are also very tasty! :) 

I had no problem with the ordering system. My bf and I just sat at our table in the beginning and waited initially because it was our first time eating there, but we eventually figured it out!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is very soggy. It either requires you to eat a slice with two hands supporting it or with a knife and fork which I refuse to do. I was very disappointed with the quality of their pizza. The ordering system here is very stupid. Pretty much you are your own waiter/waitress since you write down your own orders and bring it to the front. The staff here are just food runners. Don't know how they expect tip if they really don't do anything for you."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Neopolitan pizza, desserts, salads and atmosphere in downtown.

I fear my fellow reviewers must be suffering from erectile dysfunction and channeling their frustration into Yelp reviews.

It seems that certified Pizza Napoletana restaurants are limited in which pizzas they may produce. I spoke with the owner of Famoso who explained that they're not subject to these limitations which is what enables them to create deliciously occult pizzas.

Seriously, where else could you possibly fathom finding Thai food on a Neopolitan pizza? (try it, it's good).

Desserts and salads are a must-try.

The establishment design is exemplary and the seating and ordering strategy is refreshingly unique.

I'm sort of a design and organizational strategy enthusiast, so maybe I'm just appreciating trivial details that others overlook, but I'd encourage you to give this place a try to decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Famosa is a decent little spot to just sit in and chill while getting fed pizza.

It's not the greatest, (and I don't think they claim to be), nor is it as pretentious like Libretto. It's just Neapolitan pizza that costs about $14 a pie with some decently chewy thin crust. 

I try and use the Margherita as a standard to compare pizza places, and this one was a little on the bland side. Nothing really to it, but still good enough to finish. 

Not much more to say about this place. It's good enough to go; with a decent atmosphere and friendly wait staff it's a laid back experience, but don't expect to be blown away by their pies."}
{"text":"Famoso Neapolitan Pizzeria is a restaurant chain with locations in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia specializing in the thin-crust style of pizza that originates from the region of Naples. They currently have 3 locations in Ontario (The Annex, Yorkdale + Waterloo).

I'm sure you've all heard me say many times that none of my childhood friends are foodies; my best friend E is probably the worst offender as he is pretty meat and potatoes.  So I brought him in tow with me to check it out.

The Annex location is located at the corner of Dalton + Bloor in the space that formerly housed the James Joyce Irish Pub.  The restaurant itself is quite open, with a waiting area which opens up into the restaurant.  To the left is the \"kitchen counter\" where you place your order; the servers here only deliver the food to your table.  You can opt to pay at the counter or at the end.  It's also the gelato counter where all the kids are peering through to see which flavor du jour they want.

Service here is what I'd call a team-effort?  It's sort of a half-assed Marché-style set-up but at least it will nullify any Yelp-style complaints about lack of service, since essentially there isn't really any.  I'm not sure what to make of the tug-of-war between upscale food chain versus self-serve fast food image that Famoso seems to be tackling.

It's definitely a great spot to go with a group with long booths lining the walls.  For those who want to catch some action, there are seats by the open kitchen where line chefs toss pizza dough in the air à la cheesy stereotype.  It's also where the huge pizza oven is.


On the table are menus and an ordering pad.  Stick with the beer/wine and skip the sugar-laden cocktails.  I opt for the Italian Greyhound ($9.50); you almost have to take fingerprints to ID this as a \"cocktail.\"

Keeping in mind the dime-a-dozen pizza joints that are coincidentally chains, I must say that I'd be perfectly happy dialing 967-11-11. Sorry, guys.

The highlight of the night was definitely the Sicliana pizza as it was meaty, flavorful, and saucy. The prosciutto-arugula pizza was disappointing as the raw arugula sort of just floated on top of the pizza and fell off every time I bit into it.  It may have been easier to handle if the arugula were semi-baked into the pizza.  It wasn't saucy either.  Kind of like eating a salad on top of flatbread.  The polpette al forno also weren't as moist a meatball as I would have liked though the tomato flavor was all there.  The prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella balls sounded grand and fancy but were not.  Tiny (golf-ball sized) and not anything to write home about.

At the end of the day, Famoso was definitely so-so and I don't think I'd return again for dinner given the better choices around the city.  Piola, on Queen West is a much better choice for casual Italian eats; it is also a chain but directly out of Italy and the food is much better value for your money.

*TIP OF THE DAY*  Engage with them on social media (e.g. tag them on Instagram in your photos) and receive a $20 voucher to spend on your next visit."}
{"text":"THE FOOD- My friends and I came here after catching a movie at Hot Docs. We were famished and excited about the interesting pizza choices. My husband & I split a Thai pizza. This sounded like a delicious, different pizza in theory, but the execution was disappointing. It had too many bean sprouts and carrots and not enough sauce and spice. Our friend got the Korean beef pizza and while the Hoisin sauce base was good, there weren't enough flavours to complement it, it mostly tasted like beef and salt. We did like the crust though, perfect balance between thin & thick.

THE DRINK- I had a Caesar, which was a pretty typical resto Caesar, nothing stood out about it but it was good.

THE SPACE- This is a big restaurant and we had no trouble getting a table which was a big relief after a cold walk.

THE SERVICE- This was one of the best parts of this place. My friend ordered a Pepsi and the syrup was off. They brought her a new one and when it still tasted wrong, the manager dug up a can and brought to her himself to apologize."}
{"text":"They have changed to table service. Great pizza and fantastic service - the pizzeta mini size was great for when I wasn't so hungry, too."}
{"text":"It's good. It's a chain, a Canadian chain. Originated in Edmonton. It's good. Feels like a nice middle ground between bland personality-less chains and fancy good atmosphere pizza places. Not pretentious good food. Good Caesars"}
{"text":"Despite the restaurant being fairly packed (on a busy Saturday night), my friend and I were seated right away. I ordered a salad and a single serving Margherita pizza. The food came quickly and our waitress was friendly. Even with a beer, my order came to about $20 which was a really good deal. The food was good! I'd like to try some of their sandwiches next time."}
{"text":"Famoso is ok and it is nice to have a pizza joint in this neighbourhood.

That said, there are few other pizza places in the city that I like that much more. 

I am more inclined to hit up this place when I get one of their half-off Groupons that pop up from time to time. If I could I would give them 2.5 stars, but that is not really an option.

In all fairness I am sure my girlfriend would give them at least 3 stars."}
{"text":"I always love the flavour of their food. Absolutely love the lunch special (a small pizza with salad or soup). Love that they do a different take on the Caesar salad - it's not very heavy and uses fresh cheese and ingredients. The pizza has a smokey wood flavour and its not overlay salty like other places. I'm craving it now as I write this review."}
{"text":"one of the best pizzas ive ever had

me and bf went in a bit less than half hour before closing and they still served us
- free wifi
- we got half off our appetizer for some reason (we got the flatbread w hummus and tzaziki)
- the pizza had the cheese stretch factor, tomato sauce was the freshest that i've ever tasted (got margherita)
- lots of vegetarian options with helpful icons
- waitress was so nice!

cons:
- the caesar salad wasnt anything special
- when we checked out my bf's full sized pizza was cheaper than my 7\" pizza with salad when it was supposed to be more bc we weren't informed about the special until we checked out

notes:
- it's a bit dark so if you have bad eyesight bring a friend"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with friends and had loved each visit. I have my go to pizza now, which is the Quattro formaggi pizzetta, while I share a new pizza with a friend when I go. The environment here is also very memorable. It is a cute little restaurant that I highly recommend visiting at least once.

Here's what I've tried so far:
1. Quattro formaggi pizzetta: 9/10. I thought this was amazing, especially because I love cheese. Highly recommend to my fellow cheese lovers. 
2. Primavera pizzetta: 7.5/10. I thought this was pretty good, although not comparable to the first.
3. Sweet BBQ chicken: 7.5/10. I thought this was also good, but not like the first. 
4. White chocolate panna cotta: 6/10. This was too sweet and filling. One bite was enough for me. I would not recommend this."}
{"text":"Disappointing. When we arrived there were 5 people in the place and initial service was far from efficient. Had to wave the server on to order a cool drink on a very hot day. Bills were incorrect. Give them credit for asking if everything was fine a couple of times while we're eating. Salads were good, but the pizzas lacked flavour and were only above frozen grocery store quality even though they were baked in a large pizza oven. Problem was that the oven was not wood- burning, so the oven does not do any better job than an ordinary one.
Glad to hear good reviews from other patrons."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza! And their daily special drinks are a special bonus. Every time I crave pizza, this is the place I think of and I drag one of my friends to come with me. The servers are also very nice and the ambiance is so relaxing. The best part, they have vegan cheese option for my vegan friends."}
{"text":"My friend decided to throw her husband a birthday party at this place because it is quite rustic and all. They got a stone oven in the back that cook up some tasty treats. I arrived early to the reservation and I am glad I did. This place without a reservation fills up fast even on a gloomy and cold Saturday. Just a head's up to others. 

We sat down at our reserved tables and I started to look through the menu. Given I am at at pizzeria, obvious choice would be pizza (even though their other offerings look just as good). So I ordered the 12\" Sicilian and glad I did. The crust was thin and the sauce didn't soak through such a thin crust. Further to this, the toppings weren't over powering in taste. There were just enough cheese throughout the pizza. I liked it a lot

The only comment I have is: There's too much noise and having a conversation can be hard. Will I come back? Most probably."}
{"text":"Maybe I picked the wrong pizza, but I realllllly wasn't impressed with it. Normally, I wolf down 4 slices easy. I didn't even want to finish my last piece. 

The flatbread was really good though - the tzaziki (? I always have trouble spelling this properly) and hummus were bomb. 

Saturday's are $5 Prosecco drinks. The Bellini and Mimosa were great but the one with strawberry was not that great. Tasted like I was drinking jam. 

It wasn't busy and they rushed to give us our bill. Literally came to the table and was like: do you need the card machine? Also, I just realized, she didn't even let me see the bill and already had the totals punched in.

I'd only go back if a friend wanted to, and I'd only get apps + the day's special drink."}
{"text":"Service and ambiance were nice. However, the pizza is pretty average.  Nothing spectacular for the price we paid."}
{"text":"We were going to check out another pizza place, but they were closed so we checked out Famoso. It's cafeteria style where you go up to the register and order your meal. That being said, there are staff members who travel around to tables to fill up your drinks, see how you're doing etc. I had the salad and personal pizza set; for $10, you get bang for your buck. The salad (with chickpeas...I forgot the name) was pretty good. I can't say the same for the pizza; it was just okay...nothing to write home about. As it was Saturday afternoon, I didn't get drinks; however, they do serve alcohol and pricing for bottles of wine are pretty reasonable for Toronto. 

Good for: pizza, salad, drinks"}
{"text":"very casual environment... i felt over dressed.. oops...
seat ur self and order ur self the first order...

drinks first..
liked the sound of their belini but it wasn`t available... disappointing.. so ordered the preseco, was nice.. we also ordered limoncello lemonaide, was perfectly tart and sweet...

prosciutto wrapped mozzarella in tomato sauce was very family restaurant-sy.. nothing to talk about.... arugula salad was quite good thanks to candied pecans and goat cheese..!

Pizza... oh... i wish i can say better things to say about the pizza, considering how they imported the flour and the oven from Naples... but.. i really thought it was mediocre considering the availability of all the great options nowadays...  
the chewiness and the sloppiness in the middle of the crust wasn`t there... was rather `wet`` in the middle due to the wetness of the tomato sauce...   mozzarella wasn`t really rich, it was just wet... in my opinion, the pizza wasn`t actual traditional, was a hybrid of.. this doesn`t mean it isn`t good.. i just expected something little more authentic... (i am comapring to my experiences in Naples for the perfect pizza)

Dessert takes the prize.. eventho the gelato was not creamy enough and too frozen to be considered `real gelato``.. still greatly flavoured... i LOVED the BC blueberry and basil Gelato, also the caramelized banana and vanila gelato dessert was def worth the calories..

once i`m back in Vancouver i will try the one on Commercial Dr, see if it`s any different, but if not i will be going to pizzeria Barbarella in Vancouver instead and Queen margherita or libretto in Toronto...
 
lastly, I did enjoy Tayo`s attentiveness THANK YOU..!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

My friend invited me to dine here back in October and it was pretty good overall.  We ordered a Margherita pizza to share, and it was the perfect amount because we both weren't that hungry.  It was the first time I tried this type of pizza, and it was mediocre - tasted like tomato sauce on flat bread tbh.  Our waitress was nice, and checked up on us often.  The decor had a nice aesthetic too - a kind of modernized diner.

The best part was that the pizza was a special and only costed ~$9.  Though the pizza was mediocre, I def. want to try out the other items on their menu.  This is a cool place to sit down and grab an affordable meal with a friend."}
{"text":"I would rate this at 3.5 as the location is convenient (close to Spadina station), lots of seating and great deals.

There are a few different daily deals here, I would suggest calling and asking as I didn't see them on the website. I got the daily deal which was a Pint (Mill St Organic or Tankhouse) and Pizza (Margarita only) for $15 which saves you about $4 compared to normal pricing. 

I would say the main attraction here is the prosciutto wrapped buffalo mozzarella balls, the sauce is really good and 'balls' tasted fresh.

The pizza was 'OK', my benchmark is Pizzeria Libretto so I kinda felt the pizza was undercook, the middle of the pizza was kinda 'soggy' and the crust wasn't very crisp, also oddly the pizza had a slight burnt taste although it wasn't burnt, may have come from the oven. 

Not sure if I'l be back again as it didn't fulfill my Libretto craving but it is quite convenient and won't have to worry about getting a table."}
{"text":"Pizza here is delicious! it's got a thin crust and is full of flavor. The place is modern, casual and can accommodate large and small groups. Very nice."}
{"text":"Been frequenting Famoso for a few years now and I can honestly say that I have never had a bad experience here. 

Excellent service, reasonable prices, exceptional food and drinks. 

The tomato bisque is the most amazing thing on the menu and every time I've gone to Famoso I've made sure to get a bowl. 

In terms of pizza, there aren't too many vegetarian friendly options. However, they can easily accommodate substitutions for anything. 

The have a decent selection of gelato for dessert, but their Nutella & banana pizza is to die for. 

I've taken many of my friends to Famoso and we've always had a great experience."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch special - 11.50 for a small pizza (7\") and choice of either a salad or soup. I got the Vesuvio pizza with tomato bisque soup and a ceasar and my bf got the italian ham and pineapple pizza with napoli salad. The food came super fast and the waitress was really nice! Atmosphere was great as well. They have a lot of drink specials that vary everyday and for Sunday, the 1oz ceasar was only $5! Woo!

I really enjoyed everything we ordered and the tomato bisque was simply amazinggggg. I wanted to order another one to take out haha. Overall a nice solid place for drinks and pizza!"}

{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner, Pre-opening night
Specialty: Pizzeria 
Menu items: Prosciutto Wrapped Mozza Balls, Pizzettas & Gelato

Famoso is both a pizzeria and a hang-out spot. It's the first retail location that offers great food and affordable prices with a unique serving style. Whether just in it for appies, a pizza, a glass of wine, gelato or simply coffee and dessert, this unique little spot with 2 locations in Toronto, Yorkdale Mall and Bloor West, offers that unique atmosphere where the customer decides his or her meal plan...not the restaurant.

So what is that exactly? It simply means you arrive on location, pick a table, and write down your order using the menus and note pad found on it.
Then, you head over to the counter and place your order. You can choose to pay at that moment, or start a tab if you feel you might be coming back for more.

Once your order is placed, all you then need to do is relax until your order arrives at your table. When I visited Famoso for their pre-opening night event, my first round consisted of some tasty Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella Balls, and of course, an order of a lovely Pinot Noir.

The dish looked more like a soup when it arrived, but once I took my first spoon of juicy goodness, the mozzarella balls were very present and took over the dish completely. With the added touch of basil and accompanied with some fresh house-made flat bread, this Famoso experience started off on the right note.

Next up, and in no particular order...the pizettas! At Famoso, the flour and tomatoes used in the pizza are authentic imported ingredients from Italy. The flour used is double zero caputo flour and the interesting part is that water is never added to the dough mix. I know this for a fact as during the event, owner Justin Lussier asked me to help him demonstrate how the pizza is made. Boy, was that fun!

Pizzetas are a small, personal-size version of the pizzas. What I love about this concept is that for smaller parties, it allows us to try different flavours. With rossa (red), bianca (white) or new world pizza options; we decided to try one of each! First up, the Funghi Tartufo...Roasted white mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, truffle oil and reggiano parmesan made this pizzetta a great second course.

Following next with the Quattro Fromaggi. A succulent and cheesy preparation of fresh mozzarella, smoked mozzarella, gorgonzola and pecorino romano cheeses. With the added touch of lemon, I named this pizza my favourite at Famoso.

My sister, who is always my partner in crime for these events, was a fan of Famoso's new world pizza...the San Andreas. This pizza consisted of a base of extra virgin olive oil, garlic, oregano, fresh mozzarella and chili-lime marinated roasted chicken, that is then baked and topped with fresh avocado slices, diced roma tomatoes, diced onion, cilantro, drizzled with light cream and served with a lime wedge. Need I say more?

Up next, and probably the favourite part of my Famoso visit...dessert!  Going up to the counter to order it, and also hoping the walk over will help me make room for more; we found ourselves with Famoso's gelato distributor, innovator and chief idea officer behind all the delicious concoctions at Famoso, Mr. James Boettcher from Fiasco Gelato.

The only place where one will be able to find Fiasco's gelato creations in Toronto, for now, is at any of the two Famoso Pizzerias in the city. The flavours are completely out of this world and so fresh. We had a delicious blend of the burnt sugar banana cioccolato.

The freshness of the gelato was so present, we could smell the bananas when it arrived at our table! Now that is something we have never experienced before.
Some other of James' unconventional gelato flavours included the fior-di-latte, key lime graham cracker and salted caramel.

And so our meal at Famoso ends. But before we can say arrivederci to the owners, I am once again reminded of why this place is such a neat and fresh concept to the city...is the freshness and craftsmanship of how things are made, including my goodie thank you bag, a beautiful basil plant. Thank you Famoso.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Great pizza! You can see them hand-toss the crust and marvel at the huge oven that they cook it in. This me and my boyfriend's go-to place for dinner. The pizzas are large enough to split if you're not looking for a huge meal. One warning - sometimes the crust gets bitter if the flour gets burnt in the oven - this happened once (I've been here probably close to five or six times) and they were pretty nice about it when we mentioned it."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Very cozy. The pizza was great. Thin crust and nice flavour.  I loved the Mediterranean flatbread."}
{"text":"Just stumbled upon this while looking for a place to eat in the area.

The nicest part of this place, the oven. Quoted from many of the waitresses who are trained to tell me this, but heated to 200 degrees so that it cooks my pizza in 90 secs. But really, the oven looks nice.

Like many who have reviewed prior to I, had to taste the margherita pizza. It was decent, good enough to order again.

Also had the pizza with arugula and prosciutto, this was really good. Both pizzas were decent size, good taste, and good value compared to other thin crust neopolitan (that word is another word i heard too much there) pizza.

I tried the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella balls, honestly wasn't too impressed. don't even remember the prosciutto until i looked it up.

The salad though was really good, had the gargonzola walnut salad. Don't know if it's all that healthy, but it definitely tastes good.

I like the fully stocked and not so pretentious bar. It kinda looks like a bar you have at home, just placed on the counter, nothing special. Not some huge display wall like other places. I guess it's to make sure you notice the oven. They had a good selection of beers and I had the St. Ambroise oatmeal stout. has good flavour that is good with pizza cause it's very dark, so cuts through some of the cheese flavor.

The service was quite good, came by more often than needed, but did all that was necessary in clearing.

I'd go there again."}
{"text":"So...last night we started off having greek tapas at bar neon and arrived for a typical Italian timed dinner. Our friends and been here for dinner and being pizza lovers we were excited to eat! The hosts were great...positive, welcoming and helpful upon our arrival. The wine choices were varied and my group...two new Canadians from the south of Italy in the last 5 yrs... NO PRESSURE...were pleased with the decor and the spacing of the tables. 

Having lived in Italy and always struggled to finish my pizza so not to waste I was excited to order a pizzetta (7 inches-4 good size pieces) which was excellent. Unfortunately my two native Italians were disappointed with their margaritas as the sauce was not cooked enough (raw) and had little flavour, which explains the rating. The service after sitting down lacked-lustre and was ok. All in all not terrible not fantastic. Maybe due to the later arrival the cooks were cooked by then"}
{"text":"The absolute best Italian Restaurant! 
I highly recommend Famoso to everyone!
I'm in love all the time. Always day dreaming about Famoso's food and drinks! And I always leave on cloud 9 because of how filling, delicious and phenomenal everything is! 
The most amazing pizza!!!!! My favourite is their pepperoni and mushroom! Fresh, tasty Cesare salad, mmm tomato bisque soup! Omg and even the garlic bread...mm amazing!
LOVE LOVE LOVE
I've always been IN LOVE WITH FAMOSO!!! 
Delicious hot drinks - like the Nutella Mocha Latte!! Great sangria!! DELICIOUS NUTELLA BANANA PIZZA DESSERT, GELATO and dolce banana mmmmmm
Great staff as well!
Thanks for always a great time!

Keep it up and never change!!!!
Please open another location closer to Woodbridge, Etobicoke, Toronto Pearson Airport, Mississauga, Milton, somewhere around there! Downtown is a pain to get to. Waterloo gets a little far."}
{"text":"Very nice and cozy atmosphere, great for date night! The place was busy even on a Monday night. We ordered two pizzas, Margherita and siciliana both were very well cooked with the perfect crispy crust. The servers were also very attentive and came to check up on us a couple times throughout the night. Will definitely be coming back shortly!"}
{"text":"So freaking awful ... ordered delivery and it was 40 minutes late... tasted weird and full of chemicals ... go to pizza Gigi ... would have but they only take cash ... so good!"}
{"text":"short review - good food, but a lot of weird touches keep this place from being in the upper echelon of toronto pizza

long review - came here with a group of 9 friends on a tuesday night, was seated immediately without a reservation (as opposed to some other thin-crust pizza restaurants) which was nice. there's a couple of tv's at either end of the room which is nice but a little strange for a restaurant i thought. we ordered from the \"feast\" menu, which is a special deal menu for groups larger than 5, and we ended up with 7 pizzas as well as 4 appetizers. the pizzas ranged from very tasty (proscuitto and arugula) to just average (margherita), but in general they were what you would expect for a neapolitan pizza. the appetizers were ok, but nothing to write home about (we had the proscuitto-cheese balls, olives, tapenade mix, and flatbread), althought the sauce for the proscuitto-chees balls was really tasty when mopped up with the accompanying flatbread.
although the food all ranged between average and excellent, there are too many things missing from famoso to give it a glowing review. in my mind the biggest error is the lack of delicious chili oil. while eating the pizza you end up with a lot of crust, and although its tasty, it's also quite dry and eating a large quantity of it is tiresome. in addition, although there's an obscene amount of people working at famoso, you still have to go up and order your food, which is kind of odd considering you still have a waiter. lastly, the atmosphere and the food itself are both not worthy of the price you pay to eat here.

overall, famoso is a place that's worth going to if you are in the area and need some thin-crust pizza immediately. otherwise, you should either wait in line at another neapolitan pizza joint or eat something else in the area.

caveat: didn't try the desserts or drinks, both of which are supposed to be good."}
{"text":"Absolutely loooooove this place. 

Very convenient location (near Spadina station) and it's pretty big so you'll almost always get seating. 

Came here a couple of times and always had such a pleasant experience. Servers were always attentive to us and I was even more attentive to the food. 

Spicy Thai Pizza (16.25): I actually got this with the Tomato Bisque which was cheaper than just getting the pizza. Very interesting pizza, although not my favourite. But I wasn't really sure what to expect when peanut sauce is on my pizza. Still it was really good, sweet and salty and nice crunchiness of bean sprouts. 

Primavera Pizza (16.25): I don't like onions or olives, but on this pizza... holy. It pairs really well with the olive oil too and artichoke hearts. Almost feels like it's completely healthy for you and thus you feel even more obligated yo eat it. The cheese is also the best part where when you take a bite, the cheese keeps stretching and you don't care how much of mess you look like. 

I've also taken a bunch of friends here and they love it too. I'm going to keep coming until I try each of the pizzas at least once."}
{"text":"A 3.5. I'll give it a 4 to balance out Steph's 3 stars so this rings in at 3.5 stars. This used to be the James Joyce, an honest UK style pub, near enough to the U of T but never became a cougar bar. Alas, the James Joyce is no more. Famoso moved into the spot... some time ago. I dunno. 

Anyway, a good place to get some pizza. Decent pizza. Not Pizza Pizza utter crap. Good thin crust. Good sauce. Place gets busy on weekends after 6. So come early.

Service is friendly. But I swear everyone working here looks like they used to work at Kinkos before FedEx reflagged it. They have this... look. But it's a nice look. I didn't at all feel like I'd get a variant of hepatitis for a minute.

It's a little hard to judge how much to order. I would say if you're all males order one pizza per. If you're a male and a female, order one pizza and an app. It you're a single female or two or more single females, message me. I have a friend for you."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me so long to write about Famoso but I LOVE this place. Since moving to the Annex this has been the go-to place to grab pizza in the neighbourhood. Despite being a pizza chain, it honestly beats out a lot of \"hip\" pizza places in the city. Everything on the menu is fantastic, the pizzas come out super fast, the atmosphere is really cozy, and the service has always been great. 

My favourite pizza is the Cavoletti (add avocado or caramelized onions). Great mixture of sweet and savoury with honey, gorgonzola, walnuts, brussel sprouts and prosciutto. Still have yet to find a better pizza! Also the tomato bisque is amazing. Kind of hard to fit in having that with a whole pizza, but it goes great with the lunch special pizzetta."}
{"text":"It was very packed and the staff were pretty overworked but were still trying their best to be nice and polite on a wednesday night. First time at this place, we decided to take it to go. Would've been nice to eat it fresh out of the oven within 5 mins but again due to the amount of people had to take it home to eat. The Quattro Formagi cheese pizza was VERY VERY GOOD. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Visited on a Wednesday evening. We were greeted and seated quickly. Friendly staff. Antipasto board was advertised with \"assorted italian meats\" but only came with one slice slice of prosciutto cut in half and 2 slices of what seemed to be pre-packaged salami. For $15 it was not worth it. Pizzas seemed a bit pricy as well. Pizza was soggy in the middle and burnt on the outside. Nutella pizza was raw dough on the inside and Nutella tasted burnt. Not sure if I'd visit again."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. I've been there several times (and loved it) but the ordering system is a little strange. You order at a counter and are then served like a traditional restaurant? Not ideal but the food is awesome."}
{"text":"I remember I stumbled across Famoso just last summer. Little did I know that I would be walking into what would become my first and very delightful neapolitan pizza experience. 

Larger scale chains would often do the trick for me whenever I needed a cheesy carb fix --- actually, I'll be completely honest, a nice ol' grease laden pepperoni pie from Domino's can still hit the spot.. 

BUT ANYWAYS, as I was saying...The Margherita pizza at Famoso was on a WHOLE 'NOTHA LEVEL. The sauce was neither too sweet nor too savoury, it was just right. There was a good helping of fior-de-latte AKA mozzarella cheese on top, but of course, I could have done with some more (I am a cheese fanatic). The crust was also surprisingly tasty and received some loving, which means a lot coming from me as I am usually one to abandon it.

I also ordered the Caprese salad, which was good but definitely not as desirable as the pizza. In addition, I had a helping of the Gorgonzola walnut salad, which was kindly donated by my sister. I would recommend it if you want an appetizer that will help a tad bit in making you feel less guilty (or just go with another pizza as an appy, cause why not? YOU DESERVE IT!)

So, with all this said, I just want to say thanks, Famoso. Your pizzas are the real MVP. I will be visiting again very soon."}
{"text":"Update to comment on the service at this place, which is abysmal. The self/table service combo is just weird, and the staff aren't very good at covering the large space. We went in the other day and were waving across the room with full arm extension to get the attention of the three servers hanging out at the gelato counter and got absolutely nowhere. We need a Libretto in the Annex!"}
{"text":"Popped into Famoso's for dinner without a reservation, and was seated immediately. The self-ordering service felt a bit odd, but the overall service was attentive.

I ordered the tomato bisque soup along with the margherita pizzeta (mini pizza). The soup was AMAZING, but the tomato sauce on the pizzeta was a bit on the bland side. I also tried the gelato and the lemon sorbet (on another visit), both of which were good.

Though I still like Libretto more, Famoso is a good substitute when I want Neapolitan pizza but not the hour long wait."}
{"text":"Famoso Neapolitan is a nice little place in the middle of Toronto. I was visiting Toronto, and I was looking for a quick bite to eat after a long day of exploring. There was a bit of a wait, as the restaurant seemed to be understaffed when I had come in. There were few waiters/waitresses. 

I ordered the Pistachio Pesto Primavera, the Famoso Salad, and the Siciliana pizza. I thought the Primavera (7.5/10) was pretty good, except for the fact that I could not taste the pistachio as much as I would've liked to. The salad (6/10) was decent as well, but i'm not sure if I would order it again for its price. I liked the Siciliana (8/10) pizza, and it was definitely my favorite thing that I ordered. I also ordered a double boozy lemonade LOL because it was the special for Thursday. This place has pretty good special deals on specific days, so definitely check those out before deciding on the day that you want to visit.

Overall, this is a nice, casual pizza joint that has a lot of variety on the menu. It is very dimly lit in there, and has a good ambience to have a meal with a significant other, or a group of friends."}
{"text":"Perhaps the cavoletti is a little bit overrated. The waitresses were really nice and accommodating to our group of 6 and brought us more than enough water. 

The pizza itself however was average, yea it was salty and sweet and had a good balance of flavors and it was a good size as well but many people here are saying it tastes amazing when I would simply say it just tastes alright. The middle of the crust was a little soggy and that wasn't very pleasant. The dates were probably the best part of the pizza as they gave it little bursts of sweetness that were actually very pleasant. There is also a LOT of crust on the pizza, I'm wondering if it's possible to ask them to maybe add a bit more toppings on it considering it is a 16 dollar pizza + tax...

I also tried the tomato bisque soup from my friends plate and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza - my favourite in the city hands down. Good drink specials and an amazing owner. I bring friends here every chance I get!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great staff! They Margarita pizza is outstanding- you should try it out."}
{"text":"Hmmm, where to start? The food (Margh pizza, with kalamata olives) was fast and fresh, the waitress was helpful and clearly liked her job - God, I appreciate good customer service. The pizza was, at best boring. The sauce is soooo important and it was plain - I expected more depth to it. No comparing it to Libretto, Defina or even King Slice. For reals. 
That said the place is well located and is likely great for the university-set."}
{"text":"We came here with a groupon. I really like Neapolitan pizza but this was just kind of ho hum. The ordering system is also kind of weird and just unnecessary. 

As for the pizza, the crust was tasty, though a bit off for the style. The middle got quickly soggy. My biggest complaint, however, was the sauce on the red pizza that we ordered. It was too heavy and watery at the same time. For the price point this just isn't worth it to me. The white pizza with brussel sprouts and bacon was better, but still not a great dish.

Not horrible or anything, but just not great, and overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. I love the tomato sauce and fresh basil.  My only complaint is that you have to walk over to the counter to order."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go - for the food and the staff! Their pizzas are always so delicious and piping hot when it gets to you. I've been to Famoso several times, and it's never failed to impress. If you ever visit make sure to get their white chocolate panna cotta - it'll definitely be worth the try!"}
{"text":"There is nothing wrong with this place but I also don't get the hype. There are lots of good places around to eat, and I wouldn't choose Famoso if it were up to me.
The pizza is good; maybe I'm just not as big a fan of thin crust pizza as some people as I would never go and search it out. The gelato is also good, but nothing particularly memorable to me."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I've been avoiding Famoso. Not because I dislike Neapolitan pizza (I actually love it) or because I'm never in The Annex (I'm there way too often for someone who doesn't live or work there). I avoid Famoso because who every heard of great Italian-style pizza from CALGARY?!?! That was my mistake.

Usually I'll get a Margherita pizza to test the waters but at Famoso I dove right in to the new Catalan pizza. A pepper based sauce, with roasted apples, spiced raisins, and pine nuts might not be the first topping combination I would come up with inventing a pizza, but it was fantastic and not too sweet. We also had the Abruzzo pizza, which I enjoyed (though not as much as the Catalan) but the large pieces of Italian sausage were just too heavy for the thin crusted pizza.

We spent a lot of time looking at their excellent dessert menu but in the end didn't order anything. Oh, don't get me wrong, things like a white chocolate panna cotta or a gelato brownie cookie sandwich looked amazing. But we were much too full.

Why too full? Because the Wednesday special was $10 off any bottle of wine. That's enough to encourage us to split a bottle on a work night. But the bottle of Valpolicella we ordered held a secret not mentioned anywhere on the drinks menu. Our bottle of wine was a full litre! 

I'm sorry I doubted you, pizza chain from Alberta. We'll be back soon for more great pizza and more litres of wine!"}
{"text":"I was there last week and the week before for lunch with 2 large groups. The service was great both times and so was the food/drinks. I'm vegan and I was happy with my different options both days (pizzas). Thanks!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!!!  I was impressed by the level of prompt service and a great attitude .  Very warm and inviting, waited only 4 minutes for a table on a Saturday.  The soup was great and the PIZZA simply amazing.  The toppings were fresh and the portion size just right.   Man I was impressed.  Great restaurant to get oven pizza."}
{"text":"Wow what a restaurant! If not only looks great on the corner in a very lively hip area but the staff and food quality is top notch . They have a traditional dome oven to cook very thin Italian piazzas and the appetizers are half off after 8:30!

Pro tip : sit at the bar so you can speak to the owner Dean who is a lil weird but definitely will make the trip memorable"}
{"text":"The pizza is great. Additionally the marinated olives have a great zesty flavor and work as an appetizer for the flavors packed into main courses. Double points for attractive vegan options AND at no extra charge.

The space is open, and the neighborhood definitely fits the \"open\" feel. We were there Wednesday night while some very tasteful bop jazz was playing."}
{"text":"I'm the Duke apparently! Sounds fancy but being a Duke of a restaurant really means that I'm a pig. Do you want to share me the title? 

This Alberta-based pizza place/restaurant is not your typical pizza joint - a bit classier. It has a neat concept and showcase their chefs as they make your pizza. You know they won't sneeze on your orders, how's that as a motivation? And they are good looking, seriously. 

You order at the front and it will be full service afterwards. It's an efficient system specially if you think and order slooow. You can't hog the server as you look at the menu like you're reading calculus book. 

My favorite? Goat cheese and arugula salad. The pizza is interesting - not good, not bad but interesting. I tried the smoked salmon and it had real, decent size smoked salmon ON the pizza. Awesome and I don't feel short changed.  

Let's talk about dessert.

Plain and simple, it's awesome. It's really awesome. They have a banana + ice cream dessert that screams the word delicious. Ice cream on top of a bed of hot bananas and sweet syrup... is award winning. 

Hey did you know that they also have gelato? 

I rest my case. Come and enjoy."}
{"text":"I wanted a Pizza for dinner , I was looking for a local pizza place and as it says in the website it's the community Pizza . I went and thin found out it's a chain.
I'm not sure if I'm going back 
It's not bad , but it's not the wow kind of an Italian place"}
{"text":"Pizza Margherita was to die for. perfect crust, just enough tomato sauce and of course, fior-di-latte...mmmm This is now one of my favourite places to go for pizza in the city. The atmosphere is casual and welcoming. Try their \"Birra Moretti\" ($6.25), it's nice and smooth. Goes well with a pizza. This place deserves 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"The actual pizza gets 2 stars. Crust wasn't crispy, it was more soggy, which means they never fully cooked my 2 pizzas. 

Dessert pizza (nutella and banana) gets 4 stars. Really tasty combo, but the pizza exterior should have been a crepe in my opinion. 

Given entrees at a restaurant should get more weight, I'm giving this place 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and the service is usually quite good. This is a good place for a date, but maybe not a first date since you have to walk up to the till to order.

The tomato bisque is reason enough to try Famoso! The pizzas are good but pricy. I recommend the capricossa!"}
{"text":"Great pizza in the Annex!

Famoso offers extremely reasonable and refreshing lunch options! I've never been here outside of lunch hours, so I can't speak much to the dinner service/food, but lunch has always been great! For about $12, you get a small pizza (which is perfectly sized for lunch) and a side of a salad or bisque (both of which are fantastic). 

The food here is always fresh and delicious, and the service is friendly! The gelato is also uniquely flavoured and a nice way to end a light meal."}
{"text":"This place wasn't what I expected.  Their service system is a bit casual for the prices they charge. To place your order for both food and drinks you write it down on a notepad and hand it in to the counter.  This made it feel a bit like a cheap chain restaurant.  Despite doing half the leg work, you still feel like you should tip your server (aka. food runner and the person who gives you your bill).  Drinks were on the expensive side, and the glassware was plastic.  

The pizza was however fantastic. We had the margherita and the primavera.  Absolutely no complaints. 

I give this place only two stars because without the groupon this would have been an expensive dinner;  two drinks+ two pizzas= $60.  The overall value simply isn't there.  I would only come back for takeout."}
{"text":"Was in Toronto for a few days and drove by this place - super glad I went in. I had the tomato soup and Margherita pizza and they were both phenomenal. It was probably one of the best soups I've ever had at a restaurant. The service was also great; friendly staff, very pleasant waitress. We stayed past closing time and had coffee and such and we never once felt rushed. We apologized for coming in late but they were really nice about it and said they didn't mind at all. Those gestures are much appreciated and to top it off, atmosphere and food are fantastic. Would recommend to anyone. Only downside is there isn't a location in Ottawa lol :("}
{"text":"Just ate at Famoso, pretty surprised it's only getting a 3/5 average on here.

Service was fine, and the food was excellent! The ordering system is a bit different but it really wasn't that much of an inconvenience.  Some of you Yelpers just like to complain about anything.

Was dining with my girlfriend who is a vegan, which sometimes presents problems in non-veg restos but it was fine here.

Got a wine special $10 off a bottle, the Napoli salad was delicious, we had flatbread and hummus - the flatbread was surprisingly delicious and a bargain at $1/3 large slices.

I got the Vesuvio pizza and loved it, GF got a Primavera pizza with Daiya (Vegan) cheese on it and she really liked hers two.

Prices were reasonable.  It was Valentine's Day today and they even had free Valentines Day cards in the bathroom for the fellas who forgot! We also got free gelato for Valentine's.

I guess the only thing I can compare Famoso's too is Pizerria Liberetto which I've gone to twice, and the only advantage I'd say Liberetto has is they have a fantastic in-house beer, but otherwise I liked Famoso more.  

The place definitely has a different vibe than Liberetto, a bit more family oriented, in the back there was a TV showing sports.  

Either way, great meal, nice staff, would definitely go back again and it's always good to find a place that can cater to meat-eaters and vegans."}
{"text":"Famoso Neapolitan Pizzeria is a growing pizza chain from Western Canada, where a handful of locations is opened. The Bloor St W location opened in 2012, and has since become a popular spot for pizza in the Annex. Famosa is best known for its authentic Neapolitan style cuisine, which makes no apology for their creative menu of fusion pizzas. Located on Bloor & Spadina, the restaurant features a decently sized dining area with an open concept kitchen. The interior composed of contemporary rustic décor with warm colours, and dark wood floors. They recently launched a new F/W menu with a small selection of new items including Mac & Cheese, Korean BBQ Beef Pizza, and Patate Pancetta Pizza.

We started dinner off with the Fire-Roasted Tomato Bisque - roasted Campania tomato soup topped with feta cheese, and served with flatbread. This was one of the highlights of the evening. The bisque was rich with flavor, as the tomatoes hail from Pompeii, Italy. The body of these tomatoes taste stronger, sweeter, and have less acidity in them due to the growing conditions of the volcanic ash that makes up the significant content of the soil. With some added crushed peppers, and Parmesan cheese, the aroma of the bisque was brought to its greatest. Definitely a must order if you want to warm up from the cold weather.

For the main courses, we decided to try out two of their newest pizza items from their F/W menu. Let's start with the Patate Pancetta ($16.50) - crème fraîche, rosemary, russet potatoes, fior-di-latte, mozzarella, pancetta, caramelized onions, sea salt, white truffle oil, Grana Padano, lemon wedge, topped with a fried egg. This was a very rich pizza with an assortment of ingredients including pancetta that is cured pork belly with similar properties to both prosciutto and bacon. This particular pizza can be considered  pretty close to a brunch item, as the center was topped off with a fried egg, garnished with a very generous portion of  caramelized onions, and russet potatoes, white truffle oil, and fio-di-latte mozzarella. A wedge of lemon was also provided as a taste only basis.

The second pizza we got was the Korean BBQ Beef ($16.50) - house-made Korean BBQ sauce, fior-di-latte, house-roasted pulled short ribs, green onions, cheddar cheese, house-made hoisin sauce, which had a heavy emphasis on fusion. With a mix of house-made Korean & hoisin sauce, the pizza was topped with Italian ingredients such as fio-di-latte cheese, cheddar cheese, and green onions. The pizza was intense with flavor and leaned towards more of the sweeter side as the bittersweet taste of tomatoes was absent from this combination. The emphasis on sweet soy and hoisin was captured instead bringing you one of the more heavier accented fusions in the menu.

Overall, the dinner experience was great, as we had a nice seat right in front of the wooden stove. We saw chefs prepping the menu, tossing the pizza, and eventually transfer to the 800C oven that will cook for approximately 90 seconds.

{"text":"Manga run at the labyrinth next door we found that their neighbor has become a pizzaria. After grabbing our treasures it was time to feed our stomach. We decided to try out the new and I'm very glass we did.

We ordered 2 full size and 1 small one.  They were the proscuitto and arugula, quadro formagia and a seasonal one with avocado, bruschetta and chicken. My sister grabbed a gelato coke float while my best friend and I got a Italian peach soda to drink.  Quick reminder, if you haven Italian soda please remember to stir first before drinking or the syrup which has settled to the bottom will be drunk first leaving a flavorless soda water left over.

The toppings are generous and tasty.  The crust is light and tasty while the base is chewy and thick enough that the pizza toppings and the sauce does not leak through it is thin that it does not feel like I am eating bread.

The seasonal pizza which name slips my mind was the best. The avocado, bruschetta mix and the chicken blend so well together it was absolutely delicious. The next time I go for a manga run I will definitely grab a pizza there again. I'm sure my sister and my best friend will agree as well."}
{"text":"The closest to authentic Neapolitan crust  i've had in Toronto. Great selection on the menu, decent portions, and a comfortable ambience for reasonable pricing. Check it out some time!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza + great ambience.  Good for date night or just to hangout.  I'd definitely go again!"}
{"text":"You can't get authentic Neapolitan pizza like this in Buffalo! Here the pizza is made quick to order and in the thin gooey fashion. The only confusing part is the ordering system - walk in and get seated, get up to order at the counter, then order additional items from the waitress. 

We started off with the Famosa salad featuring chicken, crisp sopprasata, carrots, tomato and greens in a sweet vinaigrette dressing. Between four of us we took down the pepperoni and mushroom (added smoked mozzarella), bbq chicken, and spicy Thai. The bbq was topped with cold diced tomatoes and the Thai pie topped with bean sprouts. All in all, a variety of pies are offered with both standard italian style and creative fare."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past 5 years, and the food has been amazing that whole time. The pizza crust and sauce taste amazing, prices are reasonable, and it has a comfortable vibe."}
{"text":"This is a great place to try pizza with more adventurous toppings (opposed to fast food), but the quality of the food subpar and some of the combinations of toppings didn't work too well together. 

They have a stone oven, but our pizzas came out pretty burnt, so we had to avoid parts of it. I think your experience here will highly differ according to the dishes you order and if you have an adventurous palate.

We also ordered charcuterie as an appetizer, as well as gelato for dessert and I thought those tasted better than their main dishes!

As for their service, it's self-ordering which can be confusing at first. My friends had to wait a long time because the waitress forgot to put their order in, but their pizza was stricken from their bill, so both good and bad."}
{"text":"Famoso has a warm place in my heart because it reminds me of home. Famoso has been a popular chain in Edmonton for the past couple of years, long before opening a location in the Annex.

Famoso is tasty and dependable. I love the fresh ingredients and simplicity of the food and love the vodka italian sodas!

The service has always been great here! PLUS they have a killer $10 lunch special! Om nom nom!"}
{"text":"I've read some reviews that compared this place with Pizzeria Libretto on Ossington. I guess they are comparable in some ways. Location is one of the things I like about Famoso as it is much more accessible than Libretto (I live uptown).

AMBIENCE & DECOR: I love that a large portion of the seating area is facing the neighborhood street instead of Spadina Ave. I came in on a late Sunday afternoon and I was seated by the window facing houses and trees. It was nice and (sort of) calming :) I also like how the \"main kitchen\" is located in the middle of the restaurant. I got to see the chefs in action, throwing pizza dough up in the air! AND I JUST HAVE TO MENTION THE WASHROOM. It's pretty fancy ;)

SERVICE: The baristas were courteous, friendly, and attentive. They provided top-notch service for a casual restaurant. HOWEVER... I was extremely disappointed of (what I assumed was) the manager of the place. He was the one who brought our drinks and he threw the coasters on our table! No smile, no apologies. He's  acting like he's a big shot or something. It was a WTF moment, especially after being treated nicely by the baristas.

FOOD: I ordered a lunch-size pizza/pizzeta (CAPPRICCIOSA) with a side salad (Blackberry Arugula Salad). The salad was amazing, love the dressing and the garlic pizza bread that came with it. The toppings were great but the tomato sauce was a little bland, too runny and undercooked for my liking. My pizza fell apart everytime I tried to cut a piece. My boyfriend ordered the full size CONFORTO and the portion was definitely comparable to Libretto's. The toppings were great, but again, the tomato sauce was pink and runny. He wasn't too fond of that either.

DESSERT: We didn't get to try the dessert, but next time, we would really love to try the Afogato :)

PRICE: I would say that they're slightly cheaper than Libretto. My order was decently priced at $14.50 and my boyfriend's was just under $14. 

FINAL VERDICT: I would probably go back if I'm in the area and/or craving for some \"gourmet\" pizza."}
