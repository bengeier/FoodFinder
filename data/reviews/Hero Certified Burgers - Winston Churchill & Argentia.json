{"text":"I tried the bamboo bun and it was a bit sweeter than a regular but.  So enjoyed the onion rings. Overall very good food and would eat there again. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are great. If you add the normal lettuce tomato, onion, jalape√±o toppings, the price won't add up.    The 6oz is juicy and meaty. I love that their burgers are fat, rather than flat.  This instance, my burger came quick and cooked perfectly.  There are several sauces you can add, I love the hero sauce and this time I added chipotle and mustard to that.  I really enjoyed this sauce combo.  I love their fries, they're not just an add on or side dish, they are worthy as a stand-alone order.  Thick straight cut cut fries that are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They are freshly made and I think they're not frozen.  They taste good paired with nothing, or if you want order any of the numerous sauces they offer on the side, for an extra charge.  Unlike other hero burger joints, the wait at this place was not bad at all! I came on a Tuesday around 6:30pm. Ample seats and the server was pretty nice.  Bonus tip: when I signed on their wifi, I received a promotion that you get free fries with any burger purchased. So I went back to the counter after I had already placed the order, showed my screen and without any problems, they honoured it.  So on top of getting free wifi here, you may even get a promo!!  Another thing, I saw the server working the cash this day deliver the meal to the family who ordered before me. Like it was a restaurant! I'm impressed."}
{"text":"Good poutine and freshly grilled burger, with fresh toppings.  Came in just after lunch hour so there was not wait.  Friendly store manager.  Clean sitting area..."}
{"text":"Great burgers!  I love the fresh ingredients they use. I highly recommend the poutine!  This location had a new side dispensary with TONS of different flavors, some I have never even seen. I recommend the fuze green tea. My favorite"}
{"text":"So folks, this was my first visit to Hero burger. This location has been around for about 4 months and had a licks burger at that location previously. It is right next to the jack astors and in the same plaza as the movies. I'll start with the good:  The say that their meat is free of hormones, antibiotics, etc (I didn't see anything about it not being frozen, however), clean, lots of seating, friendly staff. Open 11am to 11pm and interesting menu. I liked the idea that I could choose 4oz, 6oz, or 8oz for my burger and neat choices for cheese, condiments and sauces. You can even get a fried egg for 99 cents.   Ok so I am pretty picky about my burgers. The burger itself was probably a 2 out of 5. I like a burger that is ground chuck as opposed to a circular patty that looks and tastes like it has been frozen. It was fairly messy, soggy but I did enjoy the smoked white cheddar that came on it.   I got the 4 oz, hubby got the 6 oz and brother got the 8 oz which was just 2 of the patties that was on mine. The picture I took was of the 8oz. So 3 burgers and made one a combo so that we could get a poutine to try too came to 32 bucks. Note that the poutine was yummy. Good amount of cheese and gravy. Enjoyed the poutine much more than the burger.   The have milkshakes and what looked like blizzard type ice cream desserts on their menu but I didn't try them. They also gave a little serving of free soft serve ice cream since it was the long weekend.   All in all, I wouldn't go back but I gave it an extra star for choices, friendly staff and atmosphere. Wendy's is much better if you are looking for a fast food type burger."}
{"text":"This corner of Mississauga is quickly becoming the Mississauga corporate 2nd busiest site for Friday lunches.  Within minutes of walking distance of each other, you have 3 burger places (South Street, Hero, and A&W) and 2 of them are definitely aiming for the 'gourmet upscale' reputation.  To overcome the inconsistent quality of South Street, my colleague suggested we try the relatively new Hero burger.  Our arrival to the restaurant was a 'wtf' moment as a ridiculously large and ugly bull sat out front.  We should have taken that as an omen...  Inside is bright, clean, and still has that air of 'new restaurant'.  I'll give credit to the staff as their ordering and pleasant interactions made for quick ordering.  They really push the gourmet impression as it's mentioned multiple times that it's Heritage Angus beef patties that is hormone free and antibiotic free.  One thing we quickly notice was that their menu was composed of interesting choices to upgrade your plain burger.  It sounded good till your combo easily topped $15.  Talk about sticker shock for my colleague.  His beef burger started at $7.59 and with all the add ins... it doubled. I was a bit more conservative on my chicken burger ... $1 for red peppers seemed a bit extreme.  I ended up paying $12 still though.  I will say the price is pretty steep especially it's a fast food place.  Union Social restaurant has top notch food and it's a full service restaurant for CHEAPER to help put things into perspective.  Their burgers with fries is fully loaded with great toppings and also Ace bakery bread for only $13.    Onto the food... well, in concept, it should have been good.  The patty wasn't dried out like South Street but it didn't taste like a good burger.  Perhaps it was underseasoned or that the burger were just done without any nice grill marks (aka slight charring to give it some flavour).  It was just... chewy protein.  The bun was ok but not sure I'd pay $0.50 extra again.  My friend's bacon was bordering on steamed instead of crispy bacon.  The fries were not very good either.  They were hot but definitely under cooked and perhaps too aggressively salty.  So it was pale, limp, and too salty... not a good combo for fries.  For close to $30 total for the both of us, it was quite disappointing.  Sure, it's a nice atmospher and it wasn't a painful wait but the food has to come first. I rather head to Porta Via, Tangerine, Union Social, Sprouts, and A&W.  They're all are more affordable and leaves a satisfying experience."}
