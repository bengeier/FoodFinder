{"text":"Though a bit out of the way, the food at Salto's is worth the trip. It is always freshly made with care. One of the only decent places to eat in the area, Salto's has a cosy, but casual, friendly atmosphere. 

The owner, Sal, is always there making sure that you have everything you need. He always enthusiastically lists the specials of the day, which usually depend on the season and available incredients. 

His homemade lasagna is incredible, and comes in a HUGE portion, as does most everything on the menu. It's usually impossible to finish something without some help. The bread is freshly baked as soon as you order it and comes with house-made spicy oil for dipping. The prices are completely reasonable, especially for the quality of food. I reccommend the pizza, lasagna or spaghetti and meatballs. All italian classics, they do not disappoint."}
{"text":"The owner, Sal, and his son, Chris are really friendly and very accommodating. We had a party here and the space is great to host a gathering. The price is right, the food is simple and easy for large crowds. 
There are no frills to this place but if you bring along the decor and some cheer it is great!
Lots of street parking and TTC is on the doorstep. 
They love what they do and you can see it in their service and passion."}
{"text":"After craving pizza like an insane person for over a month, Salto did not disappoint. 

I ordered a Margherita pizza and a customized calzone with pepperoni, garlic, mushrooms and spinach. The tomato sauce was ridiculously fresh and the dough had the perfect gooey to crunchy ratio. 

Should have ordered 7 more, one for each day of the coming week.... oops?"}
{"text":"Pro tip: free parking on the streets ! Make sure you check the signs ! New renovations and new menu, but same great taste  The table bread here is one of my favourite things it's freshly baked in a wood fire oven and it's just so delicious when you eat it right away! Nothing beats some fresh bread! Another item we loved was the gnocchi ! It's made fresh in house. You can really taste the difference between pre made with preservatives vs the fresh ones ! We also loved the pizza we ordered. It's delicious and we are super fans of wood oven thin crust pizzas. The thing we wish this place had more of was the draft beer and cider options. Other than that the wine list was decent and a new cocktail menu is rolling out soon so we will be back!"}
{"text":"I live near this place but never really thought of trying out until recently. The place has a good vibe and a nice chilling space. The food and drinks are reasonable and service is good. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I have been a number of times over the years and keep coming back for the food and for the setting.  If possible, I highly recommend getting a table near the front window.  The food has always been delicious, but what I love most of all is the attitude of the servers to leave you in peace and let you stay as long as you like!  My only teeny wish is for a bigger list of wines by the glass.  This is a neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and drinks and even though not many were in there the food and service was excellent. 

They bring you bread with olive oil and balsamic to start. 

Every day of the week they have food and drink specials. $4-$6 beers. 

I had the sandwich (you get to pick 3 free toppings on it, and the list is huge)...the sandwich had fresh homemade bread....my girlfriend had pasta and it was excellent too. 

Come here for drinks and a good meal. Both portions were big"}
{"text":"Have lived in the area for years, but only came here for the first time recently, for a friend's birthday. The food was really good - they do a nice thin-crust pizza - but it was so loud! We were sitting near the window in front, maybe another area would be quieter? The acoustics were such that everyone's voice seemed amplified, and when an ambulance with sirens blaring headed north on Ossington, whoa! If we go back, it will be for take-out, or maybe try to find a quieter spot in the back."}
{"text":"Lovely!

We were only there to get a couple of drinks, but we fell in love with Sal and had to order a pizza.  Amazing!  Just delicious.

The atmosphere was friendly and casual, but clean and tasteful.  Gorgeous wood tables.  Nice people all around.

It's the kind of place I feel deserves my business.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing dining experience here last night. My boyfriend & I went out for his birthday and the two of us were extremely pleased with everything we ate! 
The complimentary bread is warm, fresh & homemade. We finished it instantly and contemplated asking for another round (glad we didn't because we were both stuffed after our meals)
Meat lovers pizza is divine as was the penne in an Alfredo sauce. 
Will definitely be returning to sample more  of the food on the menu. Or ordering takeout via JustEat
Thanks for a great dinner Sal. I'll be back for that lasagna!! ;)"}
