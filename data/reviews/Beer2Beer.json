{"text":"Came in from the freezing cold outdoors. They have mulled wine which was made fresh. Perfect on cold days to sip on some mulled wine and cozy up on their sofas."}
{"text":"For a place that calls itself beer2beer their selection leaves a lot to be desired. I think it was our fault that we chose to drink here despite the setup. One person in our small group is a wine drinker and ordered a red and commented this is the most vile stuff they have ever tried. This would have been OK had the service been any good. But nope that didn't salvage this spot either.
The person wanted to swap the wine order but nope no follow up nothing till we asked for the bill and bolted out of here. There are several better options nearby so I would stick to those."}
{"text":"This is a really great little joint located in the Kensington market. 

It has a cute vintage atmosphere . They have nice vintage couches you can sit on . 

Impeccable and friendly service. I felt very taken care of and acomodated . 

The prices are really great. Very affordable. 

I will have to come back here for sure. And I recommend you to as well!!"}

Came here for lunch on a Wed. The place was not very busy. 
This was my first time ever trying polenta, it's apparently better for your health than wheat. 

Pros
A gluten-free person's dream as their polenta based menu is naturally gluten free. 
ALL of their pizzas and pasta's are polenta based, which limits what you can order. 
Some great selection of local craft beer's including the owner's brand Duggans. 
Ham and mushroom pizza was quite unique, the crust is kind of mushy. They bake it in a little steel pan. 
Farmer's meal had a bit too much polenta and comes with sausage slices. 
The cider was a local brand which is awesome. 
The patio is covered. 

Cons
No AC so I was sweating buckets. 
Service was a bit unattentive, considering the place isn't that busy you would think it would be easier to get a hold of the server. 

Protip - The Polenta fries are amazing! 

Damage - $49"}
{"text":"This place =  Outdoor patio , comfortable couches facing outside , affordable delicious eats . I ordered the sausage polenta gravy dish (under mains). Large portion @only $12... If anything polenta could have been a bit creamier...still great though. My girlfriend got a bacon omelette that came with toast, tomatoes, and polenta fries @ $13.  Gravy was NOT lacking in flavor, will return."}
{"text":"A newly opened restaurant/bar in the Kensington area. The patio is cute. They don't have a very extensive menu, but they specialize in Polenta..... basically polenta in every dish. If you don't like polenta then you should avoid this place... actually even if you like polenta you should avoid it. The food was extremely underwhelming. 

We went with a group of 11, and we were seated inside. It was very dark and we were told we couldn't split the bill, but they would still charge an 18% gratuity fee. Service was fast and they were friendly enough. Food came reasonably fast. I think my group agreed to never come again for food within the first 5 minutes of eating. 

We would only come back for the patio & drinks."}
