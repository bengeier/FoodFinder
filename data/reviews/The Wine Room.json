{"text":"Service has went downhill recently. One girl responsible for taking care of the entire restaurant, kitchen is backed up making the wait for food close to an hour. Don't waste your time unless you have a good 3 hours to spare."}
{"text":"This is a lovely neighborhood wine room. The staff is friendly and I enjoy the wine tastings on Tuesdays. If I can't make it on a Tuesday, I usually get a wine flight: three 2 oz. pours of your favorite whites or reds for only $8.  What a great deal. 

Regarding the food, it's not fancy but its good.  I like the sunshine salad and the quesadilla (which isn't on the new menu, but they'll still make it for you). Once, a waitress even created a special cheese appetizer for me: goat cheese drizzled with honey and serve with graham crackers. It was amazing! I never would have thought to combine these flavors, but I'm glad she did. Now, I offer it to my guest when I entertain. 

 Also the wine expert on staff makes great recommendations on food and wine pairings."}
{"text":"First of all it is a wine room.  So that said, the wine I have had there has always been good..  The atmosphere is a welcome change from the other restaurants in the area. It is laid back, relaxing and very welcoming.  The patio is a great place to enjoy a glass of wine.  However, the food is a huge disappointment. We ordered the \" international cheese plate\". Easy right? Wine and cheese.  The cheese was served stone cold from the refrigerator!  How can you serve a cheese plate and not know that cheese, especially Brie, needs to be served at room temperature?  That is basic cheese knowledge.  Our sandwiches were fair, the bread they used was blah  sandwich bread -could have been bought from the bread isle at a local grocery store. Same with the roast beef- grocery store lunch meat.  I love simple food.  Great ingredients, simple preparations equal wonderful food.  This place is not that. The food tasted like I was having lunch at a friend's house back when I was 8.  Ok, but definitely not what should be paired with wine for evening out.  Small changes could really make the place a stand out in Afton Village."}
{"text":"Relaxed atmosphere. Great wine. Friendly staff. 
Our \"go to\" place mid-week for a light dinner or snack or just to enjoy a nice bottle of wine.
Always something going on - especially enjoy the entertainment on the weekend."}
{"text":"We went as a group after work and the service took forever! We also got the sampler platter, the other review about such a small portion is very true! We had 8 people there and got it for everyone, we each had a bite. We finished our drinks and went across the street to finish out our night."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointing. Service was awful. Mixed drinks were not drinkable. In the end, we didn't get the food we ordered and the waitress spent most of her evening gabbing to people two tables down from us completely unphased that we had been left without our orders ever arriving. 10 minutes before closing time she eventually brought half of our order (after waiting nearly 1 hr!) Overpriced and managed by a couple of kids this evening. Not a manager in sight.  Would definitely not recommend."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT place to hang out, have a glass of wine and listen to live music. We love the indoor and outdoor seating. Owner and staff are super friendly and attentive. They also have beer and \"some\" mixed drinks for those who want to hang out and don't drink wine. 

We haven't tried the food, as we typically come to hang with friends and have a drink."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere and good wine, however we were not impressed by the food. I posted a picture of the sampler platter-it was so small!  And the spinach dip was pretty much less than a serving for one person. All in all we enjoyed our time at the Wine Room, but I would just recommend going there for wine and not food!"}
{"text":"This place is too cute. The staff is super friendly. They have TONS of bottles for sale and the prices are on point.

As another reviewer pointed out, as a wine snob, you will probably feel a little limited by the selection but the atmosphere made it up to me. It is such a great place to hang out with your friends for a relaxing night.

They also have Lolita glasses for sale, which I love! And tons of other paraphernalia. Try the New Age, its a great summer/spring wine. Very light with lots of great floral tones to it."}
{"text":"Dear Wine Room,

I really REALLY wanted to be able to give you 5 stars.  I will keep visiting you to hopefully one day revise this review.  Positives:  I love the setup of the Wine Room.  Very quiet atmosphere, outdoor seating, lots of art, and wine related trinkets to look at.

Negatives:  I am a nerd and love trivia nights.  The trivia night on Wednesday at 8:00 was rather disappointing.  I arrived at 8:04 to be told that we could not join in because they already started (even though there weren't that many people playing)  I have faith that trivia night can be fun!!  Get a speaker who is loud and excited.  Maybe offer a free glass of wine or beer to the winning team...?

Service was excellent, and prices were standard.  I will give trivia night one more chance.

{"text":"This place is quaint. I enjoyed the wine and being able to sit and talk. We went at a time that was not as busy. They have a menu which is good because some other places do not serve any food with their wine. They allow you to order and run a tab. This place is worth me visiting again. They also have gifts for the people who enjoy wine. Their restrooms are very clean."}
{"text":"We met up with some friends at the Wine Room and was really looking forward to the experience.  The wine and atmosphere were great.   They had an acoustical guitarist outside and it was a perfect night.   
Unfortunately as many reviewers have commented, the food was sub par.  Even to the fact that the food is served in cheap plastic plates and silverware.   I wasn't expecting fine dining but their offerings were something that I could make myself at home (I could have done it better).  
Our entire party was disappointed in this and would make it really hard to return.  It's ashame because I think that they have a lot to offer."}
{"text":"Service absolutely horrible. After we finally ordered waitress never came back to the table. Went to the bar and got a drink and waitress stated everyone wanted her....that's why everyone was walking up to her...to order because she never comes back. Not a place I will return to."}
{"text":"I love coming here to meet up with family or friends, for a few drinks, an app or two, or even for a hearty meal. You can sit outside on the patio year-round, which is really nice in the fall!

The chicken jalape√±o flatbread and the sunshine salad are my faves!"}
