{"text":"Highly recommended. Very good and fresh ingredients. If u take out the disadvantage of express restaurant, everything else is great in there whether u wanna have sandwich or kabab. Well, for the kababs I would say its one of the best ones Ive ever tried. The owner is a nice person he said he used to have an art gallery before this business!"}
{"text":"Currently my favorite place to grab a shawarma! The portions are huge, so the higher price is worth it. The food always tastes nice and fresh and is well spiced.   It took me awhile to finally make it here as it is hidden behind Chicken on the Way, but when I stopped by finally, I was glad I did!  Now to try a few other things on the menu so I can expand on this review."}
{"text":"Remember the soup nazi from Seinfeld? I felt like l had stepped into a Seinfeld episode when l tried to order a koobideh kebab meal. The owner was upset that l had not called ahead and ordered this. He told me that if he got another order for a shawarma, he would stop and make that first and he also said l would have to wait about 20 minutes. I told him l would not mind waiting.  To make matters worse, l had noticed he had some fresh dates and l asked him how fresh they were......  So one would wonder why l would subject myself to unfriendly abruptness at this place.  Two words -  amazing food!!!  The koobideh kebab did not disappoint!  Tender, flavourful ground meat. Delicately spiced. On a bed of fluffy long grain rice flavoured with saffron and dried pomegranate, accompanied by grilled tomatoes and some pickled jalape√±o and salad. The meal feeds three easily and is super tasty.  It has been a few years since l last ate here and it's just as tasty as l remembered.   I'd definitely return, although I'd call ahead first. Don't want to tick the owner off. Yes, the food is that good.   It is a takeout only joint. And yes, l did end up picking up two boxes of the fresh dates after he offered me a date from his stash. They were fresh, as promised."}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place & finally got to try it.  There is no dine in, so you have to do take out only.   The story was that if you don't pay attention to the service, you will be satisfied. The owner is somewhat known to be an equivalent of Seinfeld soup nazi.  When I ordered the food, he was kinda curt, but not rude.  I was quite anxious to pick up the food & meet him in person. He turned out to be quite polite to my surprise!! Now I was just dying to get home & dig into the food.  We ordered 3 main dishes all of which came with rice. A minced skewer kabob, a steak skewer kabob, and a chicken skewer kabob.  The quality of the food was amazing despite the fact that it was made at least 45min before (it had taken us 30 min to drive back home) I could only imagine how this meal would have been if there was an opportunity to it as soon as the chef had finished cooking it.  A definite must try for Persian food lovers.

{"text":"The owner has really high standards for his food. He doesn't like people dining in the restaurant, only take-always. We love the meat platter, always very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Royal Kabab Express is a solid little stop for Kababs (Surprise!!) Shawarmas, Donairs, and plated meals of the like.  It's right next to a liquor store, making it a fantastic one stop shop for all you bachelor dudes looking to grab the necessary supplies for a night on the couch, watching hockey in your underwear. ...Don't judge me!  My first impression when I looked at the menu was \"that's pretty pricey for a Shawarma,\" but it all became clear to me when he started putting it together. These puppies are MASSIVE!  The menu lists the sizes a Medium, Large and Super. Be prepared for Gigantic, Are you Kidding Me?! and ARE YOU $&%*ing KIDDING ME?!?  I ordered a large chicken shawarma and another guy in line ordered a Super. Both our eyes bugged out of our heads when we saw these thing. Mine was a good 12 inches  long with the mass of a dying sun. I can't even imagine what the other guy was in for.  Make sure you eat this over a plate, have lots of napkins, a garbage bag poncho and a swimmers cap and goggles wouldn't hurt either.  There was no way I could eat this sucker in wrap formation. Try as I did, my final decision  was spill it's guts into a mound spanning an full dinner plate and proceed via fork 'n' knife! I ate as much as I could for lunch, saved it, ate as much as I could for dinner and I still failed to eat the whole thing.  So it's big - but is it good? Yah.. it is. As far as shawarmas go, it was pretty standard. Mostly tasteless tomatoes and lettuce, and it was loaded with so much pickled veg, sauces and spiced chicken that the whole thing because a massive mish-mash of flavours that I couldn't pick out and yet still desired something more. I resorted to drowning the whole thing in Sriracha and keeping on my merry way.  It's the kind of Kabab shop, (maybe a little cleaner,) that I picture The Avengers hanging out in at the end of the movie, but think they intend for it to be take-out only.  There is a small dining area with a table to sit at, except there always seem to be child booster schairs with Sharpie marker signs on them saying \"Take-out Only, No Sitting,\" or something along those lines. I don't quite know what you want from me, Royal Kabab Express.  \"Let's get in a cab I'll buy you a kebab! Now I can't believe That I'm sharing a kebab with the most beautiful girl I have ever seen With a kebab Ooooooohhh.\" - Flight of the Conchords"}
{"text":"Best shawarmas in Calary, I'm serious they are the best. Great taste, completely different from what I've tried in Calgary. On top of that, it's affordable.  The only down side is that is ONLY take out."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for kababs!! The guy prepares the best kababs ever, seriously. Just make sure you call a half hour before ordering to go. We usually get the kabab platter for two that includes beef and chicken kababs, and comes with rice, bread, and salad. Delicious....kabab heaven!!"}
{"text":"restaurant is dirty, owners family only one present. food was unclean, watched the place for 20 minutes and no one came by, shwarma was not that great."}
{"text":"This is an average quality Iranian restaurant. The way food is served and presented is authentic and traditional (huge portions of rice and big kababs) so it's a decent place for Iranians who are used to that kind of dining. But if you're not familiar with the menu and don't know how to order, you'll be disappointed by the lack of variety.  My suggestion is to share the food so you can get a good variety and don't forget to order some side dishes.   The food is also Halal."}
{"text":"Huge sonar   I had to get a medium cause there is no way I could eat a large   and it's only 8.99"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  If you want Kabob, try House of Kabob, Atlas, Shiraz, Teaspoon or...  I would give the food 2 stars, maybe 3 if I am in a good mood. But attitude matters just as much! We went to take Kabob to go, (This is a takeout place), and the owner treated us badly for not calling before we went there!! He said if I get any other customers while I am preparing your order, I will stop and tend to them! I feel punished for ordering food there :-))"}
{"text":"Wow!!! This place is fantastic!! Very reasonable prices and just enormous portions and just great traditional flavours. Ordering their Large Shawarma is like ordering a new born child, it is so large that you'll have to carry it as such and once you taste it you'll want to treat it with such love and affection. I may have even cuddled with it. I can't even begin to imagine what you'd get if you ordered the Jumbo but I can only imagine it as carrying a toddler. Great little find and they have now become my go to for shawarmas"}
