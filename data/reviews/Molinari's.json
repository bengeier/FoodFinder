{"text":"I've been to Molinari's many times and enjoyed my dinner each time. The menu has a nice variety. The staff is friendly and helpful. I look forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food and wine. Our waitress took a little longer than we would have liked to come check on us, give us refills or our bill. Overall, good place to dine at."}
{"text":"My brother and sister and I used their private dinning room for our Parents 50th Wedding Anniversary.  The staff was great in helping up plan the party.  The food was wonderful, everyone enjoyed the evening.  I would highly recommend Molinari's!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Molinaris is very relaxed and elegant. The wine list and menu are exceptional. Did you know Molinaris is one of the longest running private Restaurants in Mentor, Ohio? The bar service and the cocktails are exceptional! Ask for Justin, he has been mixing and perfecting cocktails and martinis for years. If you STOPin for lunch, order the Kobe burgers, good value and wonderful Taste!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Molinaris for Anniversary, Everything from start, to complimentary desert was excellent, I had cakes and steak, both items the best."}
{"text":"My first time eating at Molinaris.  Food was good.  Not much of a white wine selection even though their website list this as a highlight or the restaurant.  I had the mussels, they were tender but would rather of had them in a lemon wine sauce.  Had their Pasta Putenesca, was good.  My wife had a fillet and that was very good but the dipping sauce was kind of bland(chipolte butter sauce).  Our waitress was great.  I would go back again"}
{"text":"The calamari was very good as was my salmon. Three of the four in our party did not feel well during the night, two of them had the flounder. All three had bad stomach aches. 
The ambiance was old and boring. Our server was mostly attentive throughout the meal. I mentioned to her that the wine she suggested was not to my liking but shrugged her shoulders and walked away. 
The final bill, $193+tip, was a shock although it should not have been. We know what we were ordering but didn't pay close enough attention to the the cost. 
I have no desire to eat at this restaurant again, it's average in many ways."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good find in a Mentor strip mall.  For starters, the Kobe sliders are not to be missed.  Delicious and perfectly grilled.  And dare I forget the Tillamook cheddar on them...yum.  The Pasta Puttanesca is over-the-top rich.  Penne, chicken, and sausage swimming in a buttery tomato sauce.  So tasty but only for a few bites.  It was seasoned well but dare I say it might have been too salty.  The scallops and corn potato cake were equally delicious.  The service is very good.  Our server rattled off a bunch of specials, too.  The crostini served with whatever white bean spread that is is very yummy.  Wow.  Separate wine bar area with a pretty extensive wine list.  Make reservations on the weekend.  Molinari's is what I call \"new school\" Italian.  I admit, I have a soft spot in my heart for old school Italian (see:  Mama Catena's and Conte's) but I have to give Molinari's credit for dishing up some good food."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Molinari's to celebrate our anniversary. We contemplated going to a restaurant downtown, but we really enjoyed our our last visit at Molinari's so we decided to go again. We were seated immediately  and our knowledgable and very nice waitress got us drinks, and started us off with flatbread and a delicious white bean dip. I ordered a dinner salad and it was big enough to feed a family of four. It was fresh and delicious with just the right amount of balsamic dressing. My husband ordered the chicken for seasons. I was jealous. The chicken was cooked perfectly and accompanied with a light wine cream sause with fresh mushrooms, red peppers and artichoke hearts and the scallion risotto patty that came with it was beyond delicious. I ordered the filet with the madness, simple, but cooked to perfection. The meal was accompanied with fresh bread from the oven. We ended the meal with homemade lemon berry and passionfruit sorbet which was so light and flavorful. I would go there just for that alone. All in all one of the best meals I've had in a long time. My husband and I will be going back to try their brick oven baked pizzas."}
{"text":"Waited fifteen years, will be another fifteen years to eat again.....tasted like crap"}
{"text":"Wow I was so close to b the 1st reviewer. Hehe

Awesome food - the standard menu is pretty boring so listen carefully to the specials. That's what we ordered. Starter was mussel - outstanding. We tried beef liver, pork chop and salmon. All outstanding. Waitress is very patient, not very professional but I can overlook that. 

Great atmosphere and certainly worth the money. Try it if u r in the area!"}
{"text":"Not that great, overall. 

I made reservations in advance for my boyfriends birthday. We got there a bit early but thankfully they were able to accommodate us. We sat down and were offered their bean dip...if it wasn't offered I wouldn't have ordered it. Not the greatest. We ordered the Chips & Dip for an appetizer (beef kabobs and 'homemade' chips with a Gorgonzola cheese). I would never order that again. The beef was great but just two 2 inch pieces. Not worth $10.

My boyfriend had the Filet mignon and said it was the best he had so I was very pleased because I wanted him to have is favorite meal for his big day! I had the shrimp pasta. The shrimp were huge (isn't that weird to say?). However, there was a lot of water. Not my favorite thing.

The atmosphere was weird. We were 2 of the youngest people there (25 & 27). Our server was for sure new.

I'm glad I went to experience it BUT I wouldn't go back...not really worth $100."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here after searching on Yelp for a decent restaurant in the area. We came for my son's birthday and were blown away by the service and the great quality of food. We all ordered different entrees and tasted each others and each had a distinguishing appeal to the dish. The wine selection was good we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I enjoyed dinner, Italian or not. Client dinner large group, drinks, appetizers, desserts,  one of more expensive entrees. All good in my hood because I don't pay for a thing, client dinner, front table. Has to be the only decent restaurant in the unfortunate city that is Mentor. 

Waiter was good and shared specials for the evening with an entertaining amount of pomp. He was younger and gave me somewhat of a difficult experience because I was the youngest person at a table of nine. Timely service and preparation with each course, you will see, if not, go back again.  I would actually give this place five stars had the waiter not tried to challenge my elegance. Water under the bridge now and he filled my glass diligently."}
{"text":"Hated to have to leave this review, but it's honest. We won't we back. Interesting how the \"attire\" is listed as \"classy\" but it's in a shopping plaza and the inside reflects that of an old school diner. 
We sat at the bar -by choice as all tables we already reserved. Not a large place by any stretch but the bar felt warm and welcoming. The bartender was friendly and could read us the specials like it was frequently rehearsed (this was the most impressive part of our evening) he had asked if we wanted menus and go side tracked polishing wine glasses, so about 5min later we received actual menus. We ordered drinks and asked if we wanted bread to which we replied, yes. Another couple sat awhile later, whom ordered drinks and asked for bread (which I assume you get with an entree?) I also saw some water type things that looked like they were served with hummus, that appeared to go to out to all tables? Maybe not a delicacy you get that the bar?  We ordered the pancetta jumbo shrimp as app which is 4 normal size shrimp wrapped in pancetta and grilled. It was absolutely delicious, but came at the price of $12. Our entrees were, the steak and cake (petit filet, mashed, asparagus and crab cake) the steak could be cut with a spoon! So tender; but so dang salty!! The seasoning wasn't needed. My fianc√© liked the rest with no complaint. I got the scallop \"special\" with 6 small scallops served ontop 6 asparagus and a corn \"cake\" that wasn't cook all the way through. It seemed like a potato in the middle? The flavor was good but not as tender as should have been and the scallops were good but once again salty.  The bread was great and I was really thrilled to see they had \"homemade butter\" but it was very stiff and didn't melt nicely to the bread. We ordered 2 drinks each, our app and our entrees and paid $112 before tip. I guess just expected a 2 thumbs up meal and service for the price which is why we won't be back. Oversalted and underserved is our issue."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Found it on Yelp and glad we did. 
It was a Saturday night and we were glad we made a reservation. The food was outstanding. I had pork ossobuco from the list of \"specials\" and my wife had pasta Bolognese from the regular menu. Both were very well prepared and served. Out waiter did a good job.
The location in a strip mall would not inspire confidence but proves once again you can't tell a book by its cover. Inside the decorator did some interesting things to break up the space - pretty well done too - not genius, but pretty well done.
We found it a little boisterous - not overwhelming, but too much for a romantic evening. 
We had one bottle of wine (fair prices) and two entres, Total with tax & tip was a shade over $100 - fair price for what we got.
Although we had more that enough to eat, as we were leaving we spotted the  candy store/ice cream place in the same mall. (It's open to 11:00 PM! -  and we found out why.)  Okay, I had an extra 530 calories. It was worth it. I will cut back on breakfast, lunch & dinner today to make up for it. They make their own ice cream and have unique sundaes I have never heard of before. My wife had the peanut butter cup sundae made with peanut butter syrup! My brain is foggy and all I remember about mine is 1) I never heard of it before and 2) It was great."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good every time we eat. Plan to spend an hour or more. The service isn't super quick, but when you are dealing with a fine dining restaurant, the food is prepared pretty much from scratch and you can taste the quality. You are given a free \"appetizer\" of bean dip with 3 sesame seed flat breadsticks. Why 3? I've always thought that odd when there are usually two people at a table. Most entrees are over $20. Expect to spend $100 for dinner for 2. Especially if you have an appetizer, wine and/or dessert. I love the seasonal scallops with sweet corn potato pancake and asparagus. We love the crab cake sliders. They also bring out homemade  bread with 3 butters to try. It's so hard to not eat the entire loaf before dinner comes out. Molinari's is also known for their creme br√ªl√©e so make sure to try that as least once.

My mouth is so happy after eating here."}
{"text":"This use to be my go to place for a Kobe steak and lobster tail.  The last I went in I was told I could no longer have the pairing. I don't know if it was a seasonal reason  or what, but I was treated rudely. Won't be going back. The four stars were based on the quality of the food when I did eat there."}
{"text":"3.5 - Food
4.5 - Service

My parents love this place--mostly because my Dad likes that you can pick out your bottles of wine. Haha. So, I wasn't surprised that this was where they wanted to take the family for a Valentine's Day dinner while I was in town for my birthday. 

I don't think I had been here since high school, so I was curious to see what it was like on the inside and how the menu had changed. I'd say the interior looks pretty kitschy and disconnected. I'm not a big fan of the obvious nods to wine in the decor. It came across a little cheesy. And to be honest, the whole place could use a little update. But really, who cares. As long as it's clean and the food and service are good, I'm in! 

When our large party came in there was a brief moment of panic on the hostess's face when she realized we had a baby with us. I guess my Dad hadn't mentioned that on the phone when he made the reservation. But they figured it out quickly and we were seated before we knew it. 

I loved being able to go pick out wine from their bottle selection with my Dad. I learned a whole bunch of stuff about French wines that I immediately forgot after drinking too much wine at dinner. Haha. And our server was great. She didn't come across as super-thrilled to be there, but she was sweet as could be and nailed every part of our dinner service. For large groups that's not always easy. 

For dinner my BF and I ordered a caesar salad, the filet, and the bolognese all to share. The caesar salad was A-OK. Nothing to write home about, but delicious and very traditional. The filet was cooked perfectly, but I feel it was a bit under-seasoned for my taste. I like a nice, seared, salty crust on the outside of my filet, with a medium rare temp inside. I believe I got it with the mashed potatoes and then we also ordered a side of their risotto cakes--our server highly recommended them. They were really good, but still not something I would order vs mashed potatoes. The bolognese was really delicious, too. It was hearty, meaty, and the thick spaghetti is was served on was cooked perfectly al dente. However, I just feel like there was a little depth or richness missing from the sauce. Like, it could have used more slow, low cook-time? Or maybe it could have been better seasoned? Whatever it was, I couldn't really put my finger on it. But it also didn't stop the dish from being really good. 

Overall I really appreciated the efficient service for a large party and that all of our food came out together--perfectly cooked. I loved that I could pick out my own bottles of wine, too. However, I think the price can get a little steep for what you get. And I also feel there were way too many specials for the significant menu they already have. It makes me wonder about the quality of ingredients going into their dishes and how they're keeping everything fresh with some many items to choose from. But Molinari's is really worth a visit. And it's definitely a hidden gem in a strip mall!"}
{"text":"Come enjoy a shit meal made by felons and drug addicts, after done when you want to throw up go to the bathroom, if you find some of our line cooks shooting heroin in there you get 50% off your meal."}
{"text":"Its saturday night at 6:30pm, there is only a few couples here! Really weird because the food is so good. We had smoked salmon appetizer which was really tastey. I had the pork chop special. Soooo delicious. Lightly cajun rubbed barely could tell, and super juicy. Came with corn fritters and maple apples. Great choice. Husband had the ribs which was also very good. Sauce was more tangy/spicey not sweet. Huge onion rings and cole slaw. Had room for dessert...ordered creme brulee,  disappointing. Sugar on top was burnt tasting and the pudding part was overcooked. Husband has tiramasu which was excellent. Loved it. Pricey but food is worth it. Lots of interesting and different things to choose. Will definately go back!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, on a recent cold, rainy Saturday afternoon in Mentor, we found Molinari's, and what a nice find it turned out to be!  My wife and I shared the tuna cakes, served with asparagus and drizzled with a sweet corn and chive puree. The fresh, warm bread, served with three different butters, really hit the spot, as did the tomato basil bisque with asiago cheese gratings and croutons.  Excellent, light lunch.  Thanks, fellow Yelpers."}
{"text":"First off, the pasta bolognese is the best I've had anywhere.  It is the only thing I ever get here.  A sparse, but OK wine selection--you can go over to the shelves and pick your own bottle.  We picked a Rodney Strong Cabernet Sauvignon at a price point we were in for that evening.  It paired well with the pasta and also the filet my wife had that evening.  The atmosphere was nice and quiet for the evening so conversation was easy even though we were at a booth right by the bar.  Service here is always excellent.  We have never really had a bad experience here.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five?  They need to change up their complimentary bread and Tuscan bean-dip offerings just a bit--especially with a dining establishment which prides itself in their nightly chef specials.  If you're going to give out a few freebies before the start of a meal--throw in something out of the ordinary at the same cost of the usual bread, dip, and different kinds of butter--all of which are better than most places serve--but, for return diners, it would be nice to have that unexpected freebie that makes you say \"wow!\" at the end of a meal--that was money well spent.

They are a bit on the pricey side--but, you don't mind paying if there is value.

They have put in a pizza oven (which took away from their wine selection shelves), but we found the pizza to be a bit wanting--especially when you can get over-the-top excellent hand-crafted interesting pizzas from the Beach Club Grill about three miles away in Concord.

We go here a couple of times a year--we would go a bit more if the prices were just a tad less.  But, Mentor is a bit wanting in upscale restaurants that have a fairly decent wine selection without taking out a second mortgage.  

Not quite a \"special occasion\" place, but not a bad place to take an out-of-town guest or for when you want a little bit better meal than other local establishments.

Recommended."}
{"text":"Consistently one of the best restaurants ever! Chef Randall is a genius and Justin, the manager and bartender, is spectacular!!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I loved it! 

I'll be leaving the area and moving back to Michigan in a few days so I thought I'd check out the local favorite before I left for good and boy am I glad I tried this place.  I was told you need to make reservations so I called at 5pm to make a reservation for 6:30pm for one...seemed like overkill to me but I did it anyway.  

I packed most of my business attire and it has been scorching hot here so the best outfit I could come up with was jeans (very clean, nice fitting, etc...) and a very nice top.  I made sure to have make-up and jewelry, tried to make myself look as presentable as possible for a fairly nice restaurant.  When I arrived to the left of the entrance was a bright lit formal dining area with what appeared to be business people dining. I was escorted to the right of the entrance where it was dimly lit, dark wood booths and not a soul around! What? As a solo diner I'm used to being crammed in tiny table tops, in the back, by the kitchen, by a door but this was a first to be swooped away from the bustling well-lit dining area and shunned to the Siberian section of the restaurant.  I think my jeans put me in the outcast category.  Well heck anyway, I was there to check out the service and food so I decided to write off the darkened, lonely room offense.  '

I had the nicest waiter.  He was very efficient; I wanted to take him back to Michigan with me to teach the other servers a thing or two.  He rattled off the specials and when he returned I was craving of all things the Kobe beef burger.  Maybe the jeans I was wearing made me feel like burger time.  I also ordered a glass of Heavyweight Cabernet for $7.00.  The cabernet was full-bodied, fruity and very good.  I was so very pleased to learn that they could refill it with a half glass. I wanted a little more but not an entire full glass.  The 'No problem' attitude towards my request for an additional half-glass of wine made a big impression on me.  

Before my burger arrived I was served cracked pepper crackers and spicy bean dip...delicious!  I was also served a loaf of warm home-made bread (white) and tri-flavored butter - how cool is that. The butter had 3 different colors, cheese, creamy and pesto, I loved all the flavors.  

Alas, my Kobe beef burger arrived.  Huge amount of burger, melted white cheddar (wasn't sliced - was the real good stuff) and their home-made ketchup thinly spread on the bun. Burger came with home-made fries and a side of their home-made ketchup. Good Lord this was tasty.  I see that other people add pictures so I took a photo of this delicious burger but am not sure I'll be able to figure out how to post it.  

While I was eating my burger I noticed a couple was seated across from me! Glory be I had people in my section.  By this time the well-lit section was filling up with well-dressed people...probably the 1% LOL.  Ha, my fellow diners were a mixed dressed couple. One well-dressed (totally over the top 80's style well-dressed) older lady and one middle aged guy dressed in shorts and a nice top. Tsk, tsk those shorts have just banished you to dine with the other riffraff.  Who cares the food and service was awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent appetizers, wine list and dinner selections.  This place is for sure our favorite Lake Co. Restaurant!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm... just paid $30 for a wine tasting, a sales opportunity for wine distributors where they typically donate the wine or the cost is very low, where it was advertised we'd enjoy 6 wines and 4 snacks. The wine pours were about 1.5-2oz each, your typical tasting pour. The snacks were literally 2 bites each tops! One was A shrimp. One was A 1.25\" diameter meatball. One was A 1.5\" diameter pizza bite. One was A 1 oz. chicken skewer. These were all served on one plate and then we were asked to take care of our servers. We all felt bad for them and tipped them really well, but they never took an order or anything! Since the food had sat plated way too long before we ate it, it was cold. The inside of Molanari's is in major need of a remodel. This place is terribly outdated with its indoor/outdoor carpeting and cafeteria style chairs. The warm bread was good with their typical \"terrine\" of butters.  

I've always found this place way over priced for the creativity and quality of the menu, artistic presentation, atmosphere and over all experience. The food is decent, but the experience is not even close to being up to par for the price point. Typically they do give each table a very nice complimentary white bean dip and crisp flat breads. The wine selection is vast. The service is typically good. There is a party room for private parties. 

It's not horrible, but I cannot recommend Molinari's at this price point for what they are currently offering."}
{"text":"Great wine ! Love the staff! Perfect pasta and pizza! Also their bread and butter so yummy!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite restaurants until now.  The food was delicious as usual minus the appetizer but the service was horrible.  I used this app to make reservations but when I got there they said they aren't set up to take reservations from yelp?  They sat us and we waited forever for our drink order to be taken when it finally was we ordered calamari for an appetizer it took so long for us to get it it was soggy.   Dinner was good when it finally arrived but our waiter wasn't apologetic for the wait at all.  I am afraid to go back."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place. I ended up going there twice in the same week. The service was top notch and the food was wonderful. I was a huge fan of the Cesar salad with salmon. They also have the best deserts in the city. I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu. The GM also informed me they have a chefs table in the kitchen, I will be trying that as soon as I get a group together. If you're in Mentor this is a must."}
{"text":"Molinari's is a very solid Italian restaurant on the eastside. I have been a few times and tried different menu items each time and was very impressed. The restaurant itself is very clean and their service has always been on point. I would definitely give this place a try if you are looking for a nice date night spot in the Mentor area."}
{"text":"I am surprised by the reviews of this place.  I am from out of town and took my Aunt here for her birthday dinner.  I had my doubts the minute we walked in.  I was happy we were sitting in the bar area which appeared to be nicer than the dining area.  Service was very very slow, but she was friendly.   My Aunt ordered a Cosmo and the shaker was placed on the heater by the window.  I had a hair in my pre-appetizer that was some kind of bean dip.  Didn't taste like hummus.  Lastly I was aware of who the owner was and he just sat there on at the end of the bar.  He didn't go out and greet anyone.  Something I would expect for the price of the place and a Saturday night.  I did have to give the place 3 stars because the food was very very good.  My Aunt loved her drink, and I saved her mixing cup from the heat.  If the place is trying to go a little upper scale the wait staff needs a few lessons and the decor could get a major upgrade from the 80's.  Also, have a second bartender for a Saturday night - we ordered only the one drink due to how slow it was.  The booth we sat in sat low to the table my poor Aunt, (who is still young and not an old frail thing) had to get an extra cushion to raise her up.  Cracks me up they have the cushion.  The place has much potential based on the chef and cooks.  Not to mention the portions are huge.  My favorite was in the end(couple hours later and no dessert) we walked out and the hostess did not say \"Have a nice evening\". She didn't say anything!  In a nutshell, the food saved my score.  It was very tasty."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. A very nice upscale Italian restaurant. A lot of steak selections with different dipping sauce. The fries are hand cut served with a homemade balsamic ketchup. I had the stuffed pork tenderloin and it was moist and tender delicious. The mashed potatoes with mushroom were very good. The wine selection is very good and we had the Chianti with our meal. 

Overall great place to eat."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. I must say I am really impressed with the service and food. I had the scallops with corn potato cakes. It was delicious. My partner had the veal four seasons. It too was was wonderful. The server was extremely patient and manage to give us the long list of specials today. 

Definitely would be going back for more"}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends for New Year's Eve. The dinner itself was excellent-two of us got prime rib and one ordered the lamb.

We were probably amongst the youngest there (28, 29, and 30), and our waiter definitely treated us like we were not as important as the older customers. Perhaps we would have been apt to spend more money if our service would have been better from the start. He never even said \"welcome\" or \"happy new year.\" 

The rating definitely reflects the service, not the food."}
{"text":"We  have not been here for years.  They say you can't go home again. The food was decent, not the old place, but the main problem was the place was sloppy, from no one clearing tables to an open messy office to boxes stacked up in hallways. Also, the \"new\" room was totally devoid of charm. The owner needs to recharge his battery."}
{"text":"For a special occasion u can't beat the quality of service, food and price! Very good Italian food and they always have some interesting special to try, which is usually hard to pass up."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible food. Went today with my family for birthday celebration. Worst experience with food ever!!!!! Not coming back again. All meat ( pork, filet, lamb) was burned out on outside and bitter to taste. Something like you would get from cooking on dirty grill. Even smell was not appetizing.  Very sad. We used to like this restaurant."}
{"text":"We figured we'd give this place a shot after hearing mostly good reviews, but what a disappointing experience it was. First we ordered the calamari...soggy. Then they brought out the \"complimentary\" bean dip - probably free because no one would ever pay for it....bland and way too much rosemary. It tasted like a mouthful of pine tree mush. For our entrees my wife had the shrimp pasta and I had the pasta bolognese...big thumbs down to both. The shrimp pasta...bland, no seasoning on the shrimp, and looked like something that was thrown together with leftovers from the fridge. The pasta bolgonese...really soupy and the noodles were mushy. This place was also extremely overpriced. We really regret picking this place for our Valentine's dinner."}
{"text":"Used to like this place for special occasions, but it's been sliding downhill for several years now. When we got the \"Cheeses of the World\" and it turned out to be less exotic than you can find at Giant Eagle -- a plan cheddar, a dull brie, etc. -- we realized it had jumped the shark. It's time for a refresh with a new menu and a renewed commitment to fine dining."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Mentor! While it is pricey it is worth it for their quality of food & service. Here are some recommendations:

Apps: Smoked duck wings & caprese poppers (summer special)

Salad: If they have the special with gorgonzola croutons!!!! 

Entrees: Veal Four Season & Crab Cakes

Dessert: Tiramisu (THE BEST and I am usually not a fan)

I have tried many other food options and have never been disappointed with anything and their service is always on point."}
{"text":"Friendly, upscale establishment. Familiar foods with a unexpected pleasant twist. Desserts and homemade galato. House wines or you select. Recommended."}
{"text":"I have been to Molinari's several times. They have excellent food! I love the veal 4 seasons and the pizza's. Their Caesar dressing is excellent. Al the food is excellent. I love the hot fudge sundae. I love all the food. The service is always great. The employees are very friendly. They have extensive specials which I check on their website before I go. They also have a great wine shop where you can pick a bottle of wine and have it served at the table for a small corkage which saves so much money! cause other restaurants mark up the price 100%."}
{"text":"Ok, so after years of going to Molinari's for an always fabulous dinner experience all around, we have finally had the time in our schedule to go for lunch!!  Luckily there were some tables available since we didn't make a reservation, we also got there about 1/2 way into lunch, so if we go again towards the beginning, I might opt to make reservations just in case.  The lunch menu if as diverse as their dinner menu and it was tough making a decision!  We ended up starting off with salads, which are fabulous!  Then we got the always delicious and flavorful Kobe sliders!  We got a brick oven pizza, I do believe it was the Margarite pizza, which was thin crust, and light!  Not a heavy feeling in the stomach.  It was cooked to perfection!  The service was quick without being rushed, which is good since you can get in and out for lunch hour without watching the clock.  It was another great service and eating experience.  If you have never eaten there... you must put it on your list!"}
