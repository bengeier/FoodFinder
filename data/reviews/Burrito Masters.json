{"text":"I got the beef burrito and with every bite I have to spit out a piece of un-chewable beef. That is very disappointing and points to low quality meat. The toppings are ok and look fresh , other than the guacamole that looked a bit brown. I would not recommend getting anything with beef at this location. Get chicken or go vegetarian for your burrito."}
{"text":"One of the better local joints here for sure.  Came at Friday night around 6 and service was fast for me.  Ordered the steak and chicken mix combo, though slightly more expensive than other burrito joints but it's just as good .  Chips were fried to order and the ingredients looked super fresh in the bins.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I specifically asked if they used white meat for their chicken tacos and they insisted that they do.  I take my meal home to discover terribly seasoned, crumbled dark chicken meat.  It looked horrible, I was starving so I tried a bite needless to say it was awful and I threw it out.  So disappointing and gross."}
{"text":"Another day...another Mexican place. This was my first visit, I'm vegetarian so I ordered the veg soy burrito bowl, veg soy soft tacos and nachos. The burrito bowl and tacos were very good. The bowl was multiple layers, first rice and refried beans, then all the usual vegetable toppings including a really delicious sauce. The last layer was a flavorful fake meat (soy based) in a tomato sauce. It was really good and unique. I'm so bored of the same ol' chipotle style Mexican food so it was nice to try something different. The prices were reasonable as well and everything was made to order. The veg soy was made fresh (I could literally see them making it). I live close by and I'll be returning for another meal."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Just disgusting. One of the employees tried to stretch out the refried beans with hot water from a pan, right in front of me, then tried to put the runny, watery slurry on my burrito. I asked for fresh beans instead, and they said it would take an extra 30 minutes.  My husband also specifically asked for no onions on any of his food. What's the very first thing they put on his nachos? ONIONS.   After we got home and started eating our food, I noticed something oddly... hard? Tough? In my burrito that stuck to my teeth. After getting it out with a toothpick, I discovered it was multiple pieces of dried-out rice mixed in. They must've been letting the ingredients sit out all day.   Burrito Masters? Try Burrito Newbies. I could do better at home."}
{"text":"I don't get the haters. I love the burritos here. I get the halibut and steak bowl. It's a lot of food, fairly clean eating and it tastes great. The staff is pretty friendly and they have a great selection of Mexican pops that are delicious as well if you're so inclined. This is my favorite burrito spot in Oakville."}
{"text":"Average burrito at best but what is most disappointing is the careless attitude of the staff. With no one ahead of me,  I had to wait 15 minutes for a burrito that had ground beef from a warming container. The staff puttered around doing who knows what and any questions they asked on toppings was asked at least twice as they weren't listening to my responses... Beyond irritating.   Skip this for sure."}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for a great burrito and after going to burrito masters I'm sad to say the search continues.  The first thing I noticed when I went is was the overwhelming grease/oil smell - and it just opened for the day. Maybe they had been cooking all morning and the place wasn't aired out.  The food wasn't greasy so I don't know, just the smell was a bit off-putting.   I ordered my go-to steak bowl and was disappointed. First of all the only rice option is Spanish rice (which isn't my personal preference) but somehow it was totally flavourless and bland, but I did like that they are generous with the sauces and guac (free guac? who does that!!). The other major turn off was the steak - it's over seasoned in what tasted like taco sauce, and they're these flat, hard, tasteless (other than the taco seasoning), dry, meat nuggets.  I guess all the other sauces cover that up.  But like i said they're really generous with the toppings so if you're into that go for it.  I probably won't be back except maybe for the Jarritos; for now I'll be at Habanero Taqueria."}
{"text":"Update: Changing my review from 4 star to 3 star. We went here again the other night for dinner (previously had been at lunchtime) and there were different staff there. They were still friendly, but my food was wayy off. Knowing I loved the fries supreme last time, I ordered it again. The girl making my food literally said that she had never made one before because she was new. You would think the guy training would be watching and helping her but he was messing around with something near the back of the kitchen. She didn't know what to put on the fries, and she thought it was just meat and cheese sauce, so I told her I wanted all of the toppings. She complied and packed it up. When I got home, I noticed that the cheese sauce she made was very watery, and there was so much of it, my fries were like a soup. I think I will go back to try Burrito Masters again, but never at dinner time, which sucks. Clearly the guys who work the lunch rush are the owners and they care/know what they are doing."}
{"text":"I ordered a quesadilla and it was terrible. Soggy, oil dripping mess that I barely ate.  My husband had a burrito bowl which was cold and had some chewy bits.  Friendly kid serving me but we will never go back"}
{"text":"Ordered up a halibut burrito, but received a tilapia burrito instead. It seems that they think people can't tell the difference. There was no one to complain to as I'm sure the kid working there would not know or care to hear it. Aside from the soil tasting fish there was not much flavor of any kind. The only reason I didn't throw it out was because I was starving. The name of this shop definitely does not reflect the product. I will not be returning to this place.  The flour wrap they used was fresh and soft, that's about all I can compliment."}
{"text":"Skip. Skip right out the door and don't come back.  Ordered takeout from this place, and it was awful. Not only did it take TWO HOURS to arrive, but the burritos were an absolute mess. They were layered poorly, with all of the bean at the end, all of the salad-like crux in the middle and all of the sauces at the beginning. My bean burrito--BEAN burrito--had cilantro in it. Tip for restaurateurs: one does not simply put cilantro in an effing bean burrito, because it tastes awful. The rice was literally tasteless and had no seasoning in it whatsoever. The fries were cold. Oh, and they put the most spicy, vile hot sauce ever into my burrito. I do not like hot sauce. I did not ask for hot sauce. I did not want hot sauce. I think the concept of \"bean burrito\" flew right over the head of whoever made the vile abomination that I refuse to call \"food\".  Portions were an absolute joke. I had to check my receipt to make sure I didn't order from the kid's menu. My burrito was about half the size of my hand. They gave us no more than a cooking cup of fries.  Oh, and the price? 33$. 33$ for two bad burritos, a side of \"rice\" (aka grade D gruel), cold fries and two cans of coke (we asked for bottles). The coke was the only enjoyable part of the meal.   Neither of us finished. Even despite not finishing, I pretty much evacuated my bowels after eating this crap, because my body also did not recognize it as food. Please don't go here if you like Mexican food. Please.  Save your money. Save your butt."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of burritos and have tried many, many places. I've been going to Burrito Masters about once a week for the last couple of years and it's my go-to burrito place in Oakville. I have no idea why this place has bad reviews as I've never had a bad experience here.   Their food is fresh and there are lots of choices for veggies, proteins and sauces. The veggies are always freshly chopped, not like some places that keep theirs in bins for days on end. They don't skimp on the portions and guacamole is included in the price of a burrito... which is pretty much unheard of for a burrito joint. I love hot sauce and theirs has some good heat to it with lots of flavour.   The service has always been friendly and quick every time I've been in. One of the owners is usually there and they're both extremely nice. The place is always clean and tidy and the food prepared in front of you.   I will continue to be a regular here for a long time to come!"}
{"text":"Don't listen to the haters - this restaurant is AWESOME.  I don't have much experience with burritos. Where I grew up, our plates had meat, potato, veggie. Any burritos I'd had were from vending machines or quickie marts. When I saw this place on a local delivery service website, I decided to give them a try, despite being unsure of how much I would like burritos. I was trying to be open to new types of food.  I am SO glad that I ordered, and I have ordered at least once a month since. Their large burritos are HUGE, and they come with so many toppings. I have had the steak, chicken and shrimp burritos and I cannot tell you which one is my fave - I love them all. Just the smell of these burritos makes your mouth water.   You can choose whatever toppings you like, and the price is SO good - being a cheapskate, that makes me happy.  I've tried so many different burrito places now, and none of them even come close to Burrito Masters for taste and customer service. I even sing a stupid little song when I get delivery from them about how much I love their burritos (hey, don't judge, you'd understand if you had this deliciousness in your mouth).   I highly recommend them and dang, I wish they were open...I could use a 3am chicken and steak burrito right about now..."}
