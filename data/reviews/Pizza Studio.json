{"text":"OMG I just randomly stopped by here while waiting on some friends and what an amazing surprise! Great tasting pizza with a buttery crust and not expensive at all. I'll definitely be coming back here soon."}
{"text":"Four stars, Yelp? Seriously? I got suckered in on this one and it will take me a while to trust you again. Pizza Studio racks up the wins: Worst pizza in the known universe. Most indifferent staff in the history of paid employment. Most confident roach swaggering down the middle of the dining room. Thinnest iced tea. (It was actually water--perhaps someone forgot to unwrap the tea bags.) Dirtiest windows. I would say dirtiest work area floor but that wouldn't be fair--the dirt was actually on the open pizza boxes they had spread along the floor, presumably to save time on mopping. Or maybe decor--I don't really care.  Funny thing is, I would have overlooked everything else if the pizza were good. I take a foodie's pride in eating in places that make most people double check their door locks as they speed by.  In my first (and last) visit, I used the standard test for new pizza restaurants and ordered a pizza margherita. A wiser diner would have realized the something was amiss when there was no pizza margherita on the menu board. No worries, I thought--since all pizzas are made to order, I'll just build my own: original crust, tomato sauce, mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil (It's a good way to gauge the quality of a pizza kitchen--few ingredients, so each has to earn its keep, and no one thing overwhelms any other.)  The second and most cruel clue was assembly of the pizza itself. Thin crust, a layer of red sauce applied with the precision of a trainee, topped with a double handful of cheese. This was serious tonnage of cheese--enough for multiple pizzas and maybe some fondue for dessert. (For the record, this was the kind of cheese that comes in a brick at Albertson's, not some delicate creamy mozzarella with the slight sweetness that plays against the acid of the tomatoes.) Speaking of tomatoes, there were a few. The assembler was careful to space them evenly around the pie and VERY careful not to add too many, lest every slice have one. He assured me the basil came later, and it did--sprinkled on from an aluminum shaker after the pizza was expelled on its little conveyor belt from the metal broiler that serves as an oven. That's right--none of that uppity fresh basil like the left coast snowflakes like to eat, no sir. This was good old dried basil, the green sawdust of spices, good for storing in the camper to use for kindling when nothing else is available. After carefully applying a coating of some kind (Salad oil? Spar varnish?) to the exposed crust, the assembler presented it with the hangdog pride of someone glad to be working but somehow aware that a bad career choice lurked at the heart of this culinary darkness. If you're heading to Cityscape, avoid Pizza Studio and eat someplace nicer, like the snack aisle in CVS. Fortunately, you can avoid Pizza Studio in many places since it's a chain that has metastasized throughout much of the United States. I learned that on their web site, which promises that \"Our Chef-driven creations will shatter your notions about pizza...\" Which was true, just likely not in the manner they intended."}
{"text":"This was a awesome experience. I loved creating my own pizza with such different ingredients.  Since hubby and I like different kinds of pizza it was great that they were smaller and reasonable priced. Who doesn't love a custom pizza for $7.99. Next time we're in town we will definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Salad station guy was struggling to make my house salad with chicken; salad had rotton lettuce leaves.  Cheese pizza was good.  Strange ordering system, salad line, and pizza line.  We wanted both do had to wait in two lines.  Will go to Fired Pie next time."}
{"text":"Love this place.... Just like the one in San Diego as we hoped!  Thin crust, plenty of toppings, friendly service and a clean bathroom! Parking is an adventure but know it coming in and its worth it!"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA in DOWNTOWN PHOENIX!!! For the Price and time it takes to get your pie, its as close to Back to the Future Part 2 as your gonna get! My wife and I LOVE this restaurant and if we are lucky enough to be in the area we ALWAYS try to stop in for a bit! We have been going here for a few years now and have NEVER been disappointed! A true GEM in downtown Phoenix! We can't wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"I work downtown and I'm a very picky eater. In fact, I don't like pizza. Let's just say that I have a short list of places where I am willing to eat. This place recently opened and my coworkers and I made plans to check it out together. To my surprise I have a place to add to my list. DELICIOUS.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 was stars was due to chaos. With this place being new, they haven't really gotten the \"flow\" down. There are several stations that can help take your order but it's hard to realize that's what's going on. There are people back and forth all over the place trying to figure it all out, customers and employees. There is also not a good place to wait while they cook your pizza so everyone in passing is jamming through the people waiting.   Anyhow, let's talk food. You can order on of their predetermined pizzas for a few bucks less that the \"make your own\". Spend your few bucks people because they have CHOICES!. Four crusts, just as many sauces and cheeses, and piles of toppings. They even have some after items like balsamic glaze. I had gotten the rosemary crust with tomato and pesto sauce. I piled it high with things like artichoke hearts, Kalamata olives, and caramelized onions. I did also go for that balsamic glaze at the end. It was all sorts of interesting and great toppings that it was almost not like pizza.   I'm sure this place will get better as the workforce and its customer base get better at the ordering processes. I would definitely say that if you work downtown this is a definite \"add to the rotation\" place."}
{"text":"Holy cow, I was so impressed with the quality of food and the efficiency. We came in on a Saturday during Comicon. The line was nearly out the door but they knocked out the orders quickly. They have made us life-long patrons. Every time I am near cityscape and hungry, I am going here!   The chicken alfredo pizza was my favorite out of the five we tried,  They even have a gluten-free crust!   Thank you guys so much! Only change- accept tips!"}
{"text":"Great little place at CityScape. Simple menu. Subway-style build your own pizza and it cooks in minutes before you. While you wait, the artwork on display is a nice concept, as you realize the art is actually for sale by local artists in need. Dining here is a great spot for a good pie and to enjoy and even purchase some artwork if you're in the market."}
{"text":"Excellent Personal size Pizza with unlimited toppings for $8. Self service and the restaurant is clean & well maintained. I would definitely recommend this place for casual & quick dining."}
{"text":"Horrible service today. We had our team lunch this afternoon and they messed up our orders. One pizza didn't show up and they couldn't trace where it went. The other pizza was someone else's order. I don't understand how they could do such a mess up and not apologize or make new ones. Never going there again!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great prices, options, and service! Food is awesome and so it the atmosphere! If you are in a hurry, you might want to order online and pick up, as it can be VERY busy during week day lunch hours. They have a great rewards program too and they send you a FREE pizza for your birthday!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza but the staff are rarely friendly and they're usually short staffed. they are almost always out of something. Tonight they're out of traditional crust!!! On a Saturday?!!"}
{"text":"Nice snack pizza. Fresh ingredients, nice thin herb crust. Although my pizza maker could have given me enough toppings to fill my pizza a little better, the flavor was there and the price is right!"}
{"text":"Great little pizza they got here, was pleasantly surprised! Very reasonable prices and cool artwork everywhere."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and an amazing selection of crusts, sauces & toppings to create your very own masterpiece and be eating it in less than 5 minutes!   Friendly and helpful staff and clean and inviting setting.  11\" pizza was an ideal size for lunch and great value at $7.99.  Very impressed and I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Recently just took over this spot in downtown Phoenix, Pizza Studio offers up an excellent thin crust pizza.  I totally love this place.  For a non-New York pizza I would pick this place hands down, everyday over any other pizza experience.  You can build your own pizza with fresh herbs and a selection of toppings....including diced potatoes!  That was a tickle!  The décor is hip, bright and easy on the eyes.  There is outdoor seating.  But I do not want to move the focus from the pizza itself, because it is a hot refreshment on the palate."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good, personal size pizza and I was definitely pleased with where I stumbled. Great pizza, enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Pizza was phenomenal. We walked in, picked absolutely anything we wanted on our pizza and it was done within 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Came here several times pizza was awesome,visited on a Thursday around 3pm pizza was so bad it should have been thrown away, came again Friday takes to Rusty the employee told her pizza from the day before was not good ,no comment just a dirty look I asked when they make fresh pizza she said when it's ordered and walked away... Needless to say we will not be coming back"}
{"text":"I go here every chance I get! It's great pizza for a cheap piece, how can you beat that?! Not much more to say about it."}
{"text":"Ummmm...I order the unlimited pizza and my only protein was chicken. When ordered they only put 12 tiny pieces of chicken! I didn't ask for any pepperoni, or sausage, just chicken. You would think I would get a bigger amount because that was my only protein!  not sure if I want to pay for unlimited when they give you so little"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Pizza Studio yesterday. First time there, exceptionally clean and bright, food was delicious!!! Pizza crust was thin and tasty, toppings very fresh and plentiful. Had the Beast $10.95 10\" size with added toppings. Great value. Staff very helpful and served with customer first attitude. Will definately be back"}
{"text":"Never been to Phoenix and to find a Pizza place is always a good treat. Zpizza is a cozy place with good service(Alex-your the man took good care of us and even our tiny yorkie) but most of all delicious Pizza(Jeremey made this happen)and affordable! Worth a try and you can build your own pizza and ingredients are organic!"}
{"text":"Big fan of BYO pizzas so when I visited AZ and saw this joint, I thought I'd check it out. I thought I'd come in and see the usual but it was much worse. One of the ladies was very kind and pressed my pizza, the one who was building it, man haha. I get it, we all don't want to work but do you have to push that towards me? She didn't bother asking me anything. It was ok because I sort of knew my way around but when she stared blankly at my party who didn't know much, I got a little annoyed. She even tried putting my pizza in the oven BEFORE I was done. Also not enough ingredients compared to other places and no finishers.  2 stars not because of the bad service but because compared to other places, I could've definitely gotten more for the same price. And to the worker, I get it. I've worked in a pizza place too but nah, better get a poker face."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in a long time! For 7.99 you can choose one of theirs or load up as many toppings as you wish. This restaurant is on my weekly must have list."}
{"text":"This place was fast and delicious! Try accommodated 15 people during the lunch hour rush- all of our pizzas were fresh and delicious- thx pizza studio!"}
{"text":"The pizza was just alright, a little light on cheese, and sparse toppings.  The pizza came out really fast, but was a little underdone in the middle.  The taste and flavors were good though and friendly service.  I asked and the counter girl she said they do not make the dough there, not the biggest deal breaker for the concept they are doing.  The price seemed decent for all the choices and options for building your own pizza. I will probably go back and try it again sometime."}
{"text":"We  super loved pizza studio !  we  were here after work we ordered the beast pizza with  herb rosemary crust.  The  employees have a great attitude and friendly environment.  We parked underground garage  parking  and got our ticket validated.  also liked the local artisan art displaying  on wall.     Good deal.    Thank U !"}
{"text":"Good place for a cheap bite downtown. You can get as creative as you would like, or if your not creative the pizza artist can help you out just tell them what your craving, The have a gluten free crust and a whole wheat crust if your looking for a lighter fare. I think what I love most is that they are supporting local artist that display their art around the restaurant and the pizza studio takes no fee. How great is that!"}
{"text":"Pizza was alright as pizza goes. However they rang us up wrong. The tables and store were gross and dirty. The staff was not attentive and definitely were not interested in working. Close to arena. Good food for good price if you can deal with rest."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. They have a bunch of options for crust but all are crispy thin crust and you can select each ingredient you want on it.  You can make it healthy too!"}
{"text":"Best pizza we've had in Phx. Prices are awesome as well, they know how to get business. Can't wait to eat my way thru the menu. Cowabunga"}
{"text":"Love the new layout - much more customer friendly. Same great pizza and really cool staff. Have become a regular."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza and great service! Great options for those who love speciality and more classic 'za!"}
{"text":"Quite frankly we weren't expecting too much from this place but we were very impressed with our pizzas. For $7.99 you can create your pizza, it's like ordering a sub from Subway. You chose the crust, the sauce, the cheeses, and the toppings (as much as like)! What a novel concept. It doesn't take long before you are served your pipping hot pizza. Everything was so flavorful starting from the thin crust to the toppings, even the roasted corn was tasty. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Play the artist and create your own pizza masterpiece...Custom designed 11\" pizza for only $7.99 with as many, or few toppings as you desire, including premium ingredients like feta, goat cheese, artichokes, Kalamata olives and more....At no extra charge, including your choice of crusts.  They also have pre-designed \"Starving Artist\" selections for only $5.99.  Being the \"new kid on the block\" the concept of designing your own pizza has caught on and this is one of two chains opening in the Phoenix area.  Convenience-wise this place is in a prime location and already has lines out the door at times.  On my way back to the office, I grabbed a custom vegetarian pizza on a rosemary crust, to share with my co-workers.  The ingredients were fresh and tasty, and the resulting pizza was enjoyed by all, however the crust was a disappointment.  First, there was no discernible rosemary taste. Secondly, they cooked the pizza on a pan through a conveyor-belt oven, which left the bottom of the crust too soft for a pizza this thin.  Other similar chains are using fired ovens to cook your creations resulting in a crisper, tastier crust.  All in all, the design your own pizza at a low price makes it worth working this place into a rotation if you are in the area and/or on a budget.  But seeing Phoenix is one of the \"Top 10 Pizza Cities in America\" (Tripadvisor), there are far better pies to be found in the city."}
{"text":"Great pizza, amazingly low price, and nice people. They saved the last salad for me--that's about as much as I could ask for."}
{"text":"Tried to Pizza Studio for the first time during the \"first Friday\" festivities in downtown phoenix. It was about 8 bucks for your own personal pizza with unlimited toppings. They have several different options for the pizza dough as well, the rosemary dough was extremely good and I'm not even a big fan of rosemary but it really brought out the flavor nice. Basically you select whatever topping you'd like on your pizza and they make it for you. The staff was friendly and the pizza came out quick. It's a great bang buck!"}
{"text":"It's fun to create different pizza's. I've had 3 different masterpieces and all were  delicious. Experiment and be creative you never know what you might come up with because it's all just $7.99 regardless. Where else can you be this creative for $7.99  Staff is extremely helpful and restaurant is very clean which is a must in order to get me to patronize. Did I mention the Pizza is only $7.99......or if you don't have the creative juices flowing let the staff create your Pizza for only $5.99.  A must try next time your in the neighborhood....."}
{"text":"Oh wow, yummy! My husband brought me home his left over pizza last night and even with reheating it the taste was fabulous! It has mozzarella, bacon, pineapple and onions with parmesian on top. I can taste the difference with fresh ingredients and now I'm craving more!"}
{"text":"Sometimes customer service outweighs good food. A friend suggested this restaurant. The pizza was good but I feel taken advantage of after paying $1.95 for a cup to drink water. I told the cashier I wanted a cup for water. She asked what size and I pointed to the larger one. I swiped my card, filled my cup and sat down. Looking at my receipt I realized that I had just paid for a soda to use the larger cup. I asked the cashier about the charge. The cashier spoke with the manager who declined to make any adjustment. I know that that I should have paid better attention but I was also clear that I only wanted water."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I love the pizza! Been coming here since the week it opened and am frequently here for lunch. The service has progressively gotten slower with poor time management. Stood in line for 43 minutes today. The only reason I noted it is because I have a meeting to get to. The last 3 times I have been here have had worse and worse service. Again, love the food, love the concept wish it had better shift managers and service. Seriously contemplating not coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite to eat before the Dbacks game and was surprised by how cheap and delicious the pizza was! I will definitely be back for more and have already told some friend how good it was. The only thing is that I wish they served bottled beer or margs like chipotle...haha. But yeah make a stop, your wallet and tummy will be satisfied:) It was $5.99 for their regular topping pizzas and 7.99 for specialty ones. I had the Hawaiian pizza that was only $5.99!"}
{"text":"Excellent gluten free choice! Fast and yummy!"}
{"text":"After a couple of years of comparing the competition in the neighborhood, I keep coming back. I live here at Cityscape and am always struck by the friendly attentive staff. Today I spoke with Mgr. Les and thanked him for the excellent service that keeps me coming back. As a local resident it means a lot to me to know that the pizza as well as the experience will be solid every time I return. Thanks to the managers and entire team that has serves our downtown Phoenix neighborhood so well. Keep up the positive vibes!"}
{"text":"I visited Pizza Studio for their grand opening. Service was friendly, they were trying very hard to be personable, which I appreciated given how stressed they probably were.   The menu is straightforward and easy to follow. The starving artist pizzas are a great way to eat economically downtown. The margherita pizza was very good. It needed more sauce and cheese but I would order it again. The create your own section had lots of options: crusts, vegetables, sauces, and meats.   I give them four stars because it got a little smokey in the restaurant while we were eating lunch and now my clothes smell. Also, they call the pizzas 'masterpieces' which is cute- but I heard that word at least 100 times during our lunch.   I will definitely be back and will make my own pizza- and probably sit outside if the weather permits!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here while at Dave Ramsey's Smart Conference a few weekends ago. It was packed and it did not seem the staff was ready for such a large group of people. The line ran out the door.  However, that line was SO worth the wait. The food was really good, and the staff super friendly and nice. I will for sure go back again next time I am getting lunch in Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Really cool concept. It's like a Chipotle but with pizza. Really fresh ingredients and ultra thin crust which I love. It makes the feeling after eating pizza less terrible. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love it love it love it. I always get the pepperoni, bacon, and ham on firecracker. Only thing I don't like is even if you're paying for your custom pizza and ask them for more, they barely add any. Other than that. Love the pizza here"}
{"text":"I have always loved coming here but on a recent visit Jose did an exceptional job. He was very polite and he exceeded my normal expectations of the staff."}
{"text":"I got here just before the noon lunchtime rush. Some positives about this place, the line moves quick and your pizza is done quickly. You get to pick the ingredients on your personal 10-inch pizza. Or you can stick with a salad.   The ingredients are fresh and on display. The pizza is made before your eyes. The sauce is good and slightly spicy but the crust could've been crispier considering how thin it was. Instead it was a soggy mess.   Consider this place if you're in a hurry and craving a pizza."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple other pizza joints like this yet this still tastes the best. I'm a big fan of their rosemary herb crust. Delicious! Their toppings selection is near endless and I like the quality of the toppings opposed to others I visited. The pizza is cooked in no time! Just a huge fan of this place and glad it's in Cityscape."}
{"text":"Very fun and enjoyable experience. Generous with the unlimited toppings. Friendly staff. Clean and nice decor. I will come back for sure :)!"}
{"text":"The whole concept is similar to another pizza place I like however this one didn't do well in the department of putting ingredients on the pizza. Not sure if it's supposed to be like this or if the pool girl just didn't receive proper training.  I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza. She barely put any sauce or cheese on the pizza nor did she put any chicken or basil. It was as if she was suffering an economic downturn by putting scraps of ingredients on the pizza. No good! Where did the ingredients go???  Unfortunately it was disappointing and starved of the actual main ingredients. :/"}
{"text":"I'm reading the reviews and my experience was nothing like any of the positive ones, my pizza was under cooked, the dough was soggy, and the salad hadn't been washed. I'm wondering if I had a bad group of employees, but even the restaurant was a dirty mess. Unbussed tables and overflowing trash cans. It was my first time, and next time I'll just go to Fired Pie down the street."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad! We went on a rather busy night, so the staff seemed a little stressed. But we've all been there :)  Our pizza came out in about 7-8 minutes and it was delicious. I ordered the sausage & pepper pizza and my boyfriend ordered the chicken alfredo pizza. All in all, this a cool little spot to grab a bite with a friend."}
{"text":"the place was packed. we had to wait a while to make order and eat. I like the fact that I am able to see the crust being made and toppings added in front of me. I was able to point out what I want and didn't want included except that, olive is the only thing i omitted and had everything in. There is not much of a difference between an authentic Italian pizza except for the ambience. they have the same vending machine for soda and tea like on fast food restaurants. I would recommend coming on a different time."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Pizza was GREAT, and I can't believe the price is only $6 for a pepperoni or other standard one or $8 for one with whatever you want."}
{"text":"This is the chipotle of pizza spots and it just so happens to be right next to a Chipotle. I'm a vegeterian from New York City and I absolutely loved the pizza from here. I got a pie with the unlimited toppings and a fountain soda for $12 and that was including the tax. I got a bunch of sauce, cheese, jalapenos, peppers, pineapples, broccoli, parmasian cheese, feta, goat cheese and onions on a traditional crust. It took like 3 minutes for the pie to get heated up. It tasted amazing! I loved it. I will be coming back soon. The size of the pie doesn't matter when the toppings are unlimited. You will definitely get full if you make sure you stack the toppings up. Don't be ashamed to ask for more and more and more and more, I wasn't and I don't regret it."}
{"text":"Went to get pizza and they qere out of traditional crust. Since I did not want the rosemary or other crust they had, Inasked for the gluten free. The manager said I had to pay extra $2. I said I shouldn't have to since it was their fault.  The manager was rude and unapologetic. I left. Never going back."}
{"text":"Very tasty and creative make your own pizza. I will come here again! $7.99 is a great price. Nice pictures on the wall for sale in support of starving artists.  If you eat in, they bring the pizza to you."}
{"text":"I frequent here and thanks to the employees, every visit is a pleasant one.  I'm not quite sure why I have yet to write a review- as pizza studio is one of my favorite restaurants ever (there's proof of that on my ig lol). Anyway,  this visit was different than the rest- equally delightful but just a tad dissimilar.  The employee that fixed my pizzas name is Marianne (pls excuse me if I misspelled your name) and she is one of the managers of this joint!  No need to explain why I'm extremely satisfied with her service,  just know that deserves all the recognition in the world for being a kind human being.  And because of this,  I will continue to ALWAYS suggest pizza studio as a delicious pizza fix for both natives and Az visitors."}
{"text":"Stopped in here yesterday evening because I was curious as to the set-up since it looked identical to something I saw in Memphis. The service is moderate not fast, but the people are friendly and help you out. Everything is laid out in front of you which is dope... Loved the minced garlic and basil! $10 for an 11 inch pepperoni and bacon with drink, good bet I'll be back through here soon!"}
{"text":"For about $7 you can get a quick pizza to order for one.  Interesting flavors, many options.  My first attempt was a bit salty (whole wheat with flax seed, pesto, mozz, all meats and truffle salt).    it is what it is, a hip quick pizza solution while downtown.  Nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"I came here because i thought it was a cool concept and i heard that similar places existed in California. When i found out that this place opened up across from my office i thought i would give it a try. It was amazing. I got a custom pizza and loaded up the veggies. It was huge. Enough to share but just right to be filled until dinner time. Everything was fresh and everything tasted great. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Had my first experience at Pizza Studio today. I was curious to try this quick serve custom pizza. What was nice, everything is 10.95, nice and easy. With a choice of 5 different crusts and all kind of different toppings, you can easily get a great 10\" pizza in about 5 minutes. Mine today was hands down probably one of the best pizzas I've ever had and with some great customer service, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise in downtown Phoenix. They make,  serve and deliver a delicious, \"made to order\" pizza in 12 minutes. PERFECT choice for lunch. Priced right."}
{"text":"Great concept! Pizza was quick, staff was friendly and it was affordable! My only issue was the lack of cleanliness of the food line and how the containers weren't stocked... other than that, not a bad experience. Will return"}
{"text":"Unlimited toppings free of charge? Check.  Your pizza being made right in front of you? Check.  Your pizza ready in 5 minutes? Check. Friendly and awesome staff? Check. All of that for a huge 10\" pizza for only $10.95 is possibly the best value for lunch in all of Toronto. Pizza Studio checks off everything you want for an amazing lunch spot. This is a must go to."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with nice staff, a clean place and a good pie.       The rosemary crust was a nice change from any traditional pie."}
{"text":"Yummy! Our group of two adult chaperones and four students ate there on our first night in Phoenix. Everyone raved about their pizza while we ate and on our way back to our hotel. The customer service was excellent as well. The restaurant was clean, and everything was easy to find. I would gladly eat there again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's like the Chipotle of Pizza. You order what kind of bread you want (regular, wheat, gluten free and some others) and you pick your toppings and everything. I loved this place so much because I can't eat bread all of the time...and since they had gluten free options just made things so much more easy for me. I hope this place ends up in every major city in the country so I can enjoy it anywhere I go. It was awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place! Cool clean, good pizza, great price! Pizza Studio is committed to serving the community and proudly display the work of local artists. They even offer Starving Artist Pizzas, cheese or pepperoni- $5.99! No beer... Loves me some cold beer with my pizza... Pre-made docked crusts in varieties including gluten free. I like Rosemary herb crust but it's not available in the Starving Artist selection. Wish there was a wall mounted bottle opener- even for twist-off"}
{"text":"Recently had lunch here and Jose did an amazing job! He was very attentive and made the best pizza I've ever had here. I recommend coming here to anyone."}
{"text":"New restaurant at city scape. First time here, I just happened to run into it coming out UO. This is my second go-round. Built my own pizza with their whole grain and flax seed crust with EVOO, feta and goat cheeses, artichoke hearts, tomatoes and chicken. Nice and healthy lunch alternative. And not too crowded like most places downtown during the lunch rush, but I'm sure that will change."}
{"text":"Co-worker brought me here for lunch last week. Be warned they are crazy busy during the work week for the business lunch crowd. Be patient. Go early! Love that I can put whatever I want for the $7.99 unlimited toppings. Orders the Rosemary Herb pizza crust-delicious, but it could have been a bit crispier."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what could have made our experience better, but I am so thankful and my stomach is happy after getting a pizza made here. This is a very clean and quiet sit-down or take out pizza shop where you design your own pizza and they do it all in front of you, for you. Ingredients are fresh, they also have fresh and amazing cookies! If you sit down to eat, it's very comfortable and clean but this location there is also outdoor seating as well. What makes me happier is that they support local artists and all over the walls are pieces for sale (and they don't take any commission!). This is a must-try place if you're in the mood for some tasty pizza."}
{"text":"Great Pizza experience! You can create your own 11\" masterpiece with different dough options and great toppings. Price for Pizza´s is fixed @ 7$. I have had a \"Beast\" Pizza, which was good, possibly a bit too oily (but that seems to be due to the heavy toppings I selected).  Staff was friendly, athosphere was nice. Will come again for a lunch Pizza!"}
{"text":"Great new concept in Cityscape!  We stopped by for lunch on Friday and were quite impressed. I love the make your own pizza concept and see that many others in the neighborhood do too.  We split an Island pizza and thoroughly enjoyed it - nice atmosphere, friendly staff, great prices and good food.  What more can you want?"}
{"text":"Ka-boom!  5 Star lunch spot and it's all about the \"fire cracker crust.\"  I feared the worst when I got in a long line at this Pizza Studio; however, I got in and out in less than 20 minutes.  As with Mod and & Pizza, this is the \"subway style\" pizzeria where you can design your own pizza and also pick from several pre-designed combinations.  Only Studio is far better than the other two for three reasons.  First, it's an 11\" pie.  Yay!  Second, you can pick from numerous crusts including traditional, something healthy sounding, and --my favorite --the fire cracker crust which is salmon in color and mmm spicy!  And third, you can order on line in advance.  I ordered a custom pizza with red sauce, mozzarella, black olives, mushrooms, and Italian sausage.  I timed the whole thing from order to pick up and it took just 5 minutes! (The other 15 minutes was spent waiting in line).  The pizza was superb.  I probably could have stretched it into two meals.  Instead I had to stretch into my pants the next day!"}
{"text":"For $6+tax, you can get a predesigned pizza.  I've had all of them, and they are all very tasty.  Or $8 and you can add whatever toppings you want.  This is to pizza what Subway is to sandwhiches and Chipotle is to burritos.  Fresh ingredients, rapidly assembled, getting you out the door and eating your food within about 7 minutes of ordering or less.  For a great price.  Is it the BEST pizza in the world?  No.  It's GOOD pizza though, they way you want it, served piping hot/fresh, at an incredible price.  And then enjoy your pizza on the grass of cityscape, or in an outdoor chair, listening to the fountain or people watching.  It's as good as it gets in terms of VALUE."}
{"text":"Loved being able to order online and have it ready at a specified time. I walked in and went to the online order pickup counter... It was ready, already paid for and no waiting! The pizza was very good and just how I ordered it! Some reviewers suggest getting already formulated pizzas. We make pizzas at home so are familiar with various combinations of toppings."}
{"text":"Good pizza. I was really hungry and the personal 11 inch pizza filled me up. It was nearly perfect. Only thing I wish is that every bite, the ingredients tend to fall off. Very tasty nonetheless"}
{"text":"It's new, it's fresh, it's a good value, and the service is great.  What is not to love about this new Cityscape lunch spot?  One evening last week I saw that this place had just opened- seemingly out of nowhere.  The next day some coworkers and I went here and were impressed.    It's all very straightforward, you can build your own for a certain (very reasonable) price and get unlimited toppings, or you can choose from one of their pre-made pizzas.  Several others made their own 'masterpieces', but I wanted to only get my feet wet so I had the Starving Artist Marghareta.  Mine came out really good (have posted a picture of it), but I wish I had just built my own and loaded on the toppings.  One of my colleagues said he felt guilty by the amount of meats he loaded his pizza with.  Another boldly claimed that this was his new favorite lunch spot.  We took a menu and shared it with some others in the office, and I expect that we will return often.    We showed up at 11:00 and there was a healthy but fast moving line, so one might go early to avoid a longer line.    The price is right, the service is great, and I don't see how you can go wrong."}
{"text":"yum yum yum yum, options yum yum yum yum, location awesome, food yum yum yum yum, options, unlimeted toppings, only 7.99 yum yum yum yum, great customer service. been twice. once last year and again this year. vegan & vegetarian friendly. no problem pusing stroller through line. love fire cracker crust. section for kids to have bday party. nice casual date night, family night spot. only complaint no baby changing stations:-(. other than that yum yum yum yum."}
{"text":"Any pizza is a personal pizza is try hard and believe in yourself. That's the motto at most places because the personal ones are too small and the small are just a little too big for one. Here at Pizza Studio, perfect size for one and you don't leave hungry or embarrassed that you just ate a WHOLE pizza.  The starving artist pizza is usually my go to. Simple, easy, quick and best bang for your buck. But if you're willing to fork over a few extra bucks and customize your own, you can add as many toppings as you'd like.  Don't take my word for it but try it for yourself. Great place for lunch if you work downtown and are sick and tired of Jimmy Johns and Chipotle."}
{"text":"I was on my way to Potbelly's but then noticed this little pizza place inviting me in. It reminded me of Mod a bit, but had it's own take on unlimited fresh ingredients.  My pie consisted of gluten free crust (+$2) and vegan cheese (+$1) along with extra tomato sauce and a slew of fresh ingredients that included sliced red onion, caramelized red onion, roasted red pepper, small cubed potatoes, broccoli crown pieces, bell pepper, artichoke pieces, mushroom, black olives  and crumbled meatballs. Oh! And after it was baked I chose fresh arugula as my topper. WHEW!!! Next time I think I will go a bit more simple with the ingredients so my tastebuds will be more focused.  Overall, I liked the restaurant. It was casual, well-organized and exciting to have so many crust, topping and topper options.  If I'm in the area and have a hankering for a light pizza this pizza shop will be on my list."}
{"text":"Pizza Studio offers quick, efficient cafeteria style ordering and pizza that is on point.    I was thrilled to find out Pizza Studio serves gluten free tapioca crust that tastes just like regular pizza crust ($2 surcharge). The red pizza sauce was just right, not too sweet and not too tangy. Pizza Studio allows for unlimited variety of toppings but each topping is rather skimpy. I tried the tapioca crust with red sauce, mozzarella cheese, onions, pineapple, roasted potatoes, kalamata olives, basil, garlic powder, and Jamaican jerk seasoning. The pizza took approximately 8 minutes to cook. The flavor combination turned out well and the pizza crust fared into the next day without getting soggy.   The staff was patient and helpful with order placement, ingredient sampling, and recommendations. A thin crust pizza normally costs $8 for a regular pizza with unlimited toppings and $10 for a gluten free pizza.     Pizza Studio is definitely worth a trip if you need to pick up a quick bite."}
{"text":"LOVE this concept of a create-your-own pizza place, similar to like Subway, where you go down the row & tell them what you want on your pizza!  I really like that there is NO add'l cost for add'l toppings!!!  ....I've also been to FIRED PIE Pizza at Park Central Mall, which is the same concept, & if I were to compare the 2 places, I would pick FIRED PIE over Pizza Studio.... I felt that the toppings were skimpy at Pizza Studio vs. FIRED PIE, which seemed more hearty. Also, FIRED PIE has a better Pesto Sauce vs. Pizza Studio.  - MC"}
{"text":"second time trying out this placeout . You can build your own personal pizza and its cooked especially for you. perfect crust, thin and crispy!"}
{"text":"A Quick Stop For Delicious Pizza...  The next time you're on your way to a sporting event or a concert in downtown Phoenix, Pizza Studio is a brilliant choice.  Thin crispy crust -- choices choices!  With your choice of 5 uniquely flavored crusts as your canvas... here's your chance to tap into your inner artist.  If you like a little kick in the pants, go for the Firecracker crust -- made with crushed red peppers. The rosemary herb crust offers an earthy balance. Or the Whole Grain & Flax Seed for a healthy omega boost. Lastly, it's hard to find a Gluten-Free crust that doesn't resemble cardboard --- so I was pleasantly surprised when I could hardly tell the difference between the Gluten-Free and Traditional.  This ain't no Subway...  While the Pizza Studio concept is similar to Subway -- in that you choose your ingredients as you go through a line -- when it comes to ingredients, Pizza Studio really stands out. The toppings are all fresh, and they come from local farmers whenever possible. Roasted broccoli, corn, and red peppers... carmelized onions, and crumbled goat cheese... REALLY?   You won't find these kind of ingredients at any other \"fast food\" establishment.  Or leave it to the pros...  Maybe your creative juices aren't flowing, or maybe you're just plain \"hangry\" (angry-hungy). Take the simple route and enjoy one of the \"Starving Artist Selections\" -- they're perfectly awesome.  I loved the \"white pizza\" for example. A rosemary crust brushed with extra virgin olive oil and piled with sweet caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, kalamata olives, freshly grated mozzarella cheese and fresh arugula. I feel the need to \"customize\" things... (it's a sickness) so I added the turkey fennel sausage and pepperoncinis. POW! Just the kick I was looking for.  Rock on Pizza Studio... I approve!!  With food and love, -Ashley"}
{"text":"The positives:  it is really fast, it is at City Scape, the thin crust makes you feel less guilty about eating pizza for lunch.  Much like Gadzooks, this is the latest company to copy the Chipotle fast casual concept.  They have starving artist pricing for a select number of pies, and if you want to mix it up and customize your pizza you have a huge number of toppings to choose from.  Good for either take out back to the office or for eating there.  One warning, if you don't care for extra oil on your pizza, ask them to hold the extra coating they put on the crust.  I found it to add more grease than flavor, but when you are craving a fast pizza (there's no Little Cesar's downtown anyway) this is worth a try when you don't have the time for Piazza Locale.   The negative: is that it's hard not to finish an entire pizza at lunch and no dessert offerings."}
{"text":"In between court and clients I love to eat here for lunch. You can make your own pizza from scratch and they have a lot of natural ingredients and healthy choices. It's about $9 to make your own but once in a while is ok for lunch. I approve."}
{"text":"This is the \"chipotle style\" pizza place.  Go down the line and just tell them what you want until it's done.  For fast food, this wasn't bad at all, would have liked it crispier for my taste, but still pretty good.  Awesome prices, great ingredients (but not always consistent).  Beware the lunch hour rush if you work downtown.  Bonus...order online!  Sooo much easier.  I will def make this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"I do love these create your own pie places.   The look of the place is modern/hip. Pretty quaint spot right in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  The thing is, I'm a little spoiled after eating at Mod, my favorite of all the pizza restaurants in this style. For one, Mod beats it's competitors by showing love for military and vets by offering them a nice discount. Hint hint.  Still, this place isn't bad at all. I'd eat there again over the neighboring restaurants near Cityscape."}
{"text":"First time I had Pizza Studio was in LA. And I loved it. $7.99 for unlimited toppings is just a great deal especially when you put everything on your pizza. Which I do... and it's a heavy pizza.  Basically, it's like Subway of pizzas. You are at the counter and you just tell them what to put on it. The sauce, the meats, the veges, the whatever. You can even put two layers of meat on it or put the 5-6 different kinds of meat on it altogether. I basically had a chicken, sausage, bacon, ham, salami, pepperoni, sweet sausage, (insert all available veges toppings), goat cheese, feta cheese and parm cheese with pesto sauce on flax seed whole grain crust. It was massively epic.  I'm glad they opened one here because I swear I was not aware they had on in downtown Phoenix. Now this will be my Go To place for food if I'm ever in downtown. Why spend a lot of money when you can spend $7.99!!!  One thing weird that happened was they gave my pizza to someone else so I had to get back in line to remake it. So make sure you be on the look out for your pizza when they call out your name! It will save you the time and hassle."}
{"text":"It's decently good and a solid value at $8.68 for the pie. I'm giving three stars because of their lack of attention to detail. I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza, an item that is preset with the toppings it's supposed to have. I didn't stand over them to watch the creation like I would have to if I was picking out my toppings one-by-one.  I should have. My pizza lacked any basil and ranch. It's fine, I'm not super butthurt about ranch and basil, but I just think they rushed me through and I'm a little irked by it.   Next time, I'll stand over and watch them make my pizza to ensure they get it right."}
{"text":"I have lunch here all the time! Love it! I get to create my own pizza! The cheese they use is my favorite and the pizza also tastes great when reheated."}
{"text":"Even though it gets busy during lunch time there food still has great quality and they have one of the best customer service in restaurant establishments that I have gone too. Defiantly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here before a basketball game with my two children. We were greeted immediately and with a friendly attitude. They helped us even though we were very indecisive.  The food was delicious and came out quickly. Even though in the heart of Phoenix, the price was fantastic for what we got.  Loved the atmosphere and ambience of the restaurant. The art on the walls was really good (and for sale with all of the money going to the artists).  I would definitely come here again if we are in the area."}
{"text":"I came here with 6 friends around 8pm. The worker there was sitting down talking to a friend and mentioned they were closing soon even though the door said 10pm.  After waiting a few minutes,  she decided to take our orders. Before we started ordering the same worker said \"are you guys all gonna order?\" in a rude tone. We all said yes and she looked annoyed.  I didn't wanna deal with her attitude and laziness so I went to chipotle next door"}
{"text":"Love their flaxseed and whole grain crust! It doesn't puff up as much as the traditional one does, but the seeds offer a really satisfying bite.   I also love their unlimited toppings for $7.99. It's a really good deal, and you can always ask for extra servings of whatever you like. They even had roasted zucchini along with a solid variety of meat. It's super customizable, so you should be able to pick a combo you like.  The portions are perfect - one individual pizza was filling but not sickeningly so. Definitely recommend this place for a quick and cheap meal."}
{"text":"AMAZING.. self size portion pizzas that are super fresh and fast. The \"originals\" are only $6 for an 11\" pizza. Only took about 7 minutes to make and cook.. the staff was very friendly and did a great job to satisfy. A must try!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a late lunch while working downtown and the place was pretty dead, which was great for me. It was my first time there so I wasn't really sure what to expect, although I had been to Mod Pizza before and heard/thought it would be similar. This place has more crust options, but I didn't really see that as important. What I wanted was min n match toppings. The olives, sausage, and roasted red peppers were great but the pepperoni was dry and tasted like grocery store generic brand. The guy at the counter was not particularly helpful and seemed inconvenienced as he and 2 or 3 other employees were yucking it up about who knows what. I saw that they put the pizza in what's basically a giant toaster oven. Not good. It was crispy on the outside and soggy in the middle. The consistency sucked. However, the pizza was pretty big just for one person so I had to debate whether to box the rest or throw it away - it was just okay and so I threw it out. In light of the other places to eat downtown, and the staff behavior and pizza consistency, quite honestly I probably won't be back. Ill make the trip to Mod Pizza or just go somewhere else for lunch."}
{"text":"This is a pizza that is set up like Subway you can have it your way really fast and really good several types of toppings several types of crust several types of sauces all fresh and delicious reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. The employee on duty was the most rude,Aggressive, disrespectful, and unprofessional person I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Refuse to give corporate's phone number. yelled at me in front of my children.I've had better service from the door greeter at Walmart"}
{"text":"Great pizza; great prices: friendly staff, clean restaurant. They hit all the marks as well as fast!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was definitely fresh, but lacked flavor either in sauce or cheese, but I do love flavor so maybe I'm bias. Anyhow, I still ate most of it!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pizza Studio several times now and I can't believe I haven't written a review yet...  The first time I went in I wasn't sure how things worked, but the employees gave a quick intro.  It doesn't take long to realize though that the place pretty much runs like a Subway but for pizza.  The ingredients are fresh and the pricing is very reasonable.  You can get your own personalized pizza and a drink for around $10.  The line always moves quickly and the pizza doesn't take more than a few minutes to bake.  The crust bakes perfectly every time...a nice think crust that is perfectly crispy around the edges.  This is a must try for a good lunch downtown!"}
{"text":"Pizza redefined!! This is not a usual pizzeria .. This is pizza made to amaze!! If you like slightest of pizza, this is a MUST visit!! Cost is minimal and you make your own pizza!! The story starts with the thin crust bases .. They have 5 options in crust.. And then unlimited toppings and it comes out so good... All for 7.99 and it's delicious!! Pesto and basil made it taste like heaven!! But yes you can chose whatever you want as little or as much you need!! One pizza is sufficient for 2 or may be 3 since its 6 slices.. A little bigger then a traditional medium pizza! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Salad bar is always closed, cheese slides right off the pizza, overall cheap pizza. Subway pizza over pizza studio"}
{"text":"This place is great and I'm so glad I found it so soon!! The employees are so friendly and happy and willing to help and serve you. I am gluten-free, so when I asked for the gf crust, the lady actually asked if I wanted her to change her gloves for my allergy...that type of competence and willingness is RARE.   It's only 7.99 for a make your own 11 inch pizza, which if you only get one topping is ok, but it's for unlimited toppings. So in theory you could get like all the veggies, all the seasonings, all the specialty meats and everything for only 8$...which is awesome.  The flavors are great and it's a little more unique than other places (they have cool flavors and jerk seasonings and tangy seasonings, etc)  I will definitely be returning and can't wait to return.   It's really rare to find places that actually offer and honor and want to serve gluten free customers.   THANK YOU!!  Give it a try and get lots of toppings so you get more for your money :).   Update: went back the next day- still great!"}
{"text":"My choice of toppings!  I like their perfect thin crust! I am enjoying every bite to taste their strong topping flavor instead of taste pizza sauce.  It was fast to bake my pizza.  I am looking forward to eat leftover pizza tomorrow!  Price is good.  I will be coming back when I am in Phoenix, AZ for vacation."}
{"text":"We got there just after 11am, so right before the crowd got in. When you enter, there are couple menus on the wall that explain how to get your pizza. The pre made pizza's are 5.99 or you can go for the unlimited topping for 7.99.  When you figure out the crust and sauce or pre decided pizza, think subway. You get in one of two areas where they start your pizza. You tell them what you want and move along, unless its the unlimited topping than you stand and point out what you want. I got the White pizza, but decided I wanted mushrooms and red onions so it ended up being the unlimited. There is no sauce on this pizza, so keep that in mind when ordering as I like extra sauce on my pizzas.  Than while paying and finding a seat, they pop your pizza in the oven, when it comes out they top it with parsley and than walk around yelling your name until you raise your hand and say PRESENT! lol Kidding, but you do have to raise your hand to get his/her attention so they can drop your pizza off. A couple of times I felt sorry for the guy because he would weave in and out of everyone, go outside yelling these people's names because they weren't paying attention.  My coworkers got The Island, Margarita and two shared a veggie pizza, not sure what it was called. For those with a \"healthy\" appetitte, one pizza to yourself is just fine. I was nice and full. But one can be shared between two people just fine.  The decor was nice, red and grey. There's more inside seating around the corner, you don't realize it because of the soda machine. It looks tight but it works. The people making the pizza was nice, the cashier couldv'e been a bit more engaging or even plastered a smile, twice two workers walked by and asked how our pizza was. One guy was concerned because there was 5 of us and only 4 pizza's, I guess not a lot of people share but it was nice of him.  Will definently go back."}
{"text":"Fast service, friendly people,  pizza was OK nothing special taste kinda like pizza hut to be honest.  Good for a quick meal though"}
{"text":"Amazing garden pizza, made perfect. Loved how organized and clean and friendly everyone was. Will be back."}
{"text":"This must be about my fourth time here and I'm comfortable giving a high rating for this quick custom pizza outlet in the west half of City Scape in downtown Phoenix. Food and service are consistently good and I get the impression of quality ingredients. It's a true value meal at about $8 before beverage for a very filling meal that should really be sufficient for two of less ravenous appetites. Pizza Studio sets a higher standard for \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"Wow! Best pizza I've had! And it's amazing that this is a fast food place popular for lunch as the pizza goes through a machine that cooks it in about 2 minutes Napolitana style. There a great standard configurations like the truffled mushroom that I had or you can choose your own unlimited toppings for the same price. You have your choice of crust also. The pizzas come in 7\" and 10\" sizes. They also have salads and desserts."}
{"text":"I love everything about this! I love pizza, you can make your own masterpiece by choosing anything and everything from the crust to the sauce, to the cheese, to all the toppings in the world. They also offer online ordering which makes picking up your food so easy. Just show up and get your pizza box and you're good to go. And their pizza's delicious, really. I hope they open a Pizza Studio on the west side at some point. I can only visit the one Downtown and I'm hooked! So good!!"}
{"text":"Decent taste but the service is no energy. No personality or helpfulness and at these \"build-your-own\" type places there is an expected fun/playfulness craving when you stop in. I will not return."}
{"text":"Was in the area...kept dreaming of this since Cali.  Today, I ordered: Firecracker w/pesto sauce, mozzarella, goat, feta, fresh grated Parm slivers, fresh garlic, onion,  mushroom, green peppers, jalapeño, spicy sausage, pepperoni and finished with fresh basil.  This is located in the heart of downtown in Cityscape.  Love the simplicity of this place and the friendly staff."}
{"text":"The pies here are create your own and fast in coming out. The employees are super friendly, Eric was considerate and efficient."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast and yummy!! Love this place. Been here prolly about 1/2 dozen times. I like their \"Starving Artist\" menu...$5.99. I either get the Veggie, Island, or Margherita...Love them all. They do have a \"build it yourself\" for $7.99, but I'm fine with the $5.99 pizzas. They have salad with house dressing for $2.99 and I Pepsi products. (blak!..LOL). It's not gourmet, and I'm fine with it. Perfect for a quick bite at lunchtime!!"}
{"text":"I hate to be so blunt, but all the Chipoltle-style, make-your-own, all-the-toppings-you-want pizza-joints, (Fired Pie, MOD, Pieology) they should all eat THIS pizza. PIZZA STUDIO.  Why?  More flavor. It's that simple.   The sauce is not just better, it's delicious. My topping choices are not so unusual so as to make a difference between these restaurants (alright, if you insist: extra sauce, sausage, mushroom & onion) so I guess that makes the sauce the difference. Oh, and it's $1 cheaper.   Citicenter, by Chipoltle, across from Starbucks. Dee-Lish-ous!!!!!!!!  Go!!  9/26: I just tried a new pizza parlor in Arcadia, they lost my order, found my order, $22-for-large, DID NOT COMPARE TO PIzza Studio!  Google \"crave\". All right, I get it for you:  \"feeling a powerful desire for something\"  I CRAVE PIZZA STUDIO!"}
{"text":"Great concept. Get to build your own pizza but gotta be honest the bottom crust was to soggy and we only had a few meat toppings.  This was even after we waited a couple minutes to eat it.   Will try again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat! I even don't mind driving half an hour to get it ^.^ the food is so good, the staff is so friendly, and I love looking at all the artwork."}
{"text":"Looks like Pizza Studio has an all new staff qnd they look like total slobs and eat their own pizzas right in front of the register. Where's the management? How about some pride in the appearance of the business and staff. Standards have lowered and that will effect the overall service and food quality. Management reach out to me and let's address the issues. Maybe with some insight we can see a return to a well polished and attentive staff."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of when I used to work at Little Caesars in college. Our manager would allow us to make our own pies, and we'd just fill them up with toppings, and each time to no avail. At Little Caesars you can add every single topping that they have, and you'll still end up with a pizza with no flavor. And that's Pizza Studio in a nutshell."}
{"text":"Ehhhh... mixed feelings.  This is right across the street from my work. One day I was hankering for some pizza but I was having a crazy day and did not have time to wait long for it. I did not want delivery either. I saw that they have an online ordering service, so I gave it a try.  They have a crazy variety of toppings. As a vegetarian, I was psyched to see how many vegetarian combinations I could make. I ordered one with tomatoes, roasted broccoli, mushrooms, roasted potatoes, fresh garlic, banana peppers, and mozzarella cheese. On a rosemary crust.  I go to pick it up and it is almost ready. The kid behind the counter could have had a bit better of a personality. But he didn't. *shrug*  Once it is ready, I practically ran back to my office. The pizza looked decent. It tasted decent. Nothing spectacular though. And I was disappointed that the middle was a bit soggy.   There are other quick pizza places by my work. After my lukewarm experience with Pizza Studio I think I will give them a try next."}
{"text":"I liked it.  Went here with a friend without reading any reviews.   The BBQ pizza was good and we split a salad.  Proportions were solid and the food was good.  The crust was incredible.  Way better than expected.   Go before noon as the line will be crazy long."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here before a concert because it was one of the few restaurant without a crazy wait time. Pizza Studio is another type of build-your-own pizza chain.   They didn't have a very big selection of toppings and were out of parmesan in shakers. They were also very understaffed, but again I feel this could have been a lack of knowledge about the events downtown. I don't know if it was because of the influx of concert and baseball game attendees, so I am not holding them totally accountable for those issues.  I'm giving Pizza Studio three stars because regardless of the staffing or topping options, the quality and taste of the pizza was just average. I had the gluten free pizza with broccoli and garlic (pictured). It wasn't very good, taste or texture wise. The cheese tasted overly processed and the pizzas (both regular and gluten free) were soggy upon arrival.  Additionally, the bathroom was absolutely disgusting. I'll spare the details suffice to say it was enough to make you lose your appetite."}
{"text":"This place is really good and I love that there are so many different options. They even have some healthier and vegan options. The staff is friendly and helpful and the pizza is always delicious."}
{"text":"It's pretty clean and the employees seem pretty enthusiastic when greeting everyone. I have been here twice and both times got the margherita pizza. It's good for what it is. Pretty good value...comes to about 6.49 with tax. 3 stars because both times my pizza was given to me without basil."}
{"text":"I love pizza. If I had to eat one food everyday for the rest of my life, pizza would be my choice! And for $8, Pizza Studio served up the best pie I ever tasted. I don't eat meat, so I put together a veggie masterpiece with tomatoes, mushrooms, mozzarella, caramelized onions, crushed garlic, olives and roasted red peppers topped with goat cheese and a pinch of truffle salt. The sauce was a blend of tomato and basil pesto on a firecracker crust. Service was fast and friendly even during the weekday lunch rush. I think I'm in love..."}
{"text":"Solid pizza at a great price. Nice floppy thin crust, perfect for folding. Build your own with different options of: crust, sauce, cheese and unlimited toppings. Everything was fresh. Place was clean. Guys that were working were: pleasant, polite, and helpful. I was looking to grab something quick in order to return to my hotel room to watch MNF. This hit the spot perfectly and it was only $8.65! If pizza was good for you, I'd definitely return this week. Who am I kidding? I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. What a great concept! I was complicated (like always) and had half meat lovers and half Hawaiian. I am terrible at making decisions so Pizza Studio is a dream come true for me. My coworkers and I came for the lunch and the line moved quickly. The service was impeccable. At one point someone ordered gluten free crust and an employee had every pizza maker put on new gloves. At Pizza Studio, they truly go above & beyond."}
{"text":"Pizza was a little burnt on the edges, but delicious and was the perfect size. My only complaint was the men's room was out of paper towels"}
{"text":"This place is like Subway, but for pizzas. They have a set price of $10.95 ($12 after tax), and you choose your sauce, crust, and unlimited toppings, though you only get a bit of each in anticipation that you'll be choosing a lot. Each pizza is made fresh to order, and only takes a few minutes to make. Pizza is thin crust, and the mix and match gives great pizza combos! I recommend the firecracker crust and the garlic alfredo sauce if you're a fan of stronger flavours."}
{"text":"Abysmal. Seriously, abysmal. One star because their pizzas cook in 2 minutes, in case you view that as a highlight. With so many exceptional options nearby, don't bother."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, it had just recently opened, and apparently something was broken, because it took 30 minutes to get my pizza.  I decided to wait a while and give it another try.  The second time it was much quicker, and good, not anything to write home about, but the price of $4.99 is very reasonable for downtown.  Third time it was still relatively quick, but I noticed a visible difference between my pizza and my friend's pizza as far as toppings (we both ordered the veggie).  Her toppings were barely visible, mine had more, but I specifically asked to throw on a few more mushrooms, and my pizza maker complied.  The fourth and last time we visited, we both received VERY sparse toppings (less than before), and we both asked for more of the veggies, to at least, you know, cover SOME of the pizza (seriously, I think I got maybe 10 very very thin slices of mushrooms).  My friend's pizza maker was rather rude and said no very abruptly, and then added, if you want more veggies you need to get the unlimited toppings price at $7.99.  My pizza maker was nicer, but essentially said the same thing.  No thanks.  It was a nice idea for something cheap and quick, but will spend my $3 more elsewhere where the food is better."}
{"text":"Went in today for an afternoon lunch and ordered a custom creation. I liked the variety of ingredients. However, green bell peppers are my favorite topping and here they are  chopped into tiny little diced squares, so I asked for extra and still didn't get as much as I wanted on my pizza. I usually don't eat pizza crust but here it was light and chewy so I ate the whole slice. The freshness is what makes this worth the money. It also comes out very fast and service was good. Nothing special about this place, but I will come back for more if I am in the area and in the mood for pizza."}
{"text":"Like Chipotle- made to order but pizza.  Choose your crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings.  Great fresh ingredients.  Fast line.  Problem- undercooked.  WAY UNDERCOOKED.  Unable to eat with hands, had to use fork.  If you use your hands all the toppings, cheese, and sauce slides off the slice.  Crust in the middle was still doughy.  Went with group, everyone unhappy :( will not go back because of the other bad reviews are the same."}
{"text":"So nothing gets me more mad then a struggle to get to the business itself. I can easily get over it once i am there and the service and food are worth it. This place is on a normal day and night is one of those places that is worth going the extra mile to eat there. Luckly for this night i was across the street at a phoenix suns preseason game. Since the game was a blow out and it was only a preseason game i decide to leave early to go across the street and enjoy some delicious pizza. It was a Tuesday night and i looked up what time this location closes. The website said 9 on this particular night. I decided to leave the game at 835 since it should only take ten minutes to walk across the street. As i leave the game early with a friend who i am telling it will be worth his time the pizza is amazing and we cross the street we finally make it. As i approach the location i look at my phone to make sure we made it in time its 850. Right before we walk in my friend says \"it looks closed.\" We walk in and the doors are still open as they should be there is still ten minutes in there business day.  As i approach the counter the girl says oh we are closed. I asked her why if the business hours are till nine. She told me because the business was dead and nobody was coming in. She said sorry and proceeded to clean behind the register. As me and my friend leave and walk back to are car we are so mad. I vow never to return to this location if u don't understand common business and how to serve the public professionally. I will also never recommend this location as u never know what you are going to get. Don't have business hours if you are not going to go by them."}
{"text":"Great concept but the crust is tough, and the cheese is bland.  It. Is nice that you can order online for quick pick up.  Tried it a couple of times and have no plans to go back."}
{"text":"Stopped by here while visiting family in AZ :) This place is basically the chipotle of the pizza kingdom hahaha  It's 7.99 for a build your own with unlimited toppings. Best deal ever and awesome taste! So happy find out this chain has locations in CA so will be going to that one very soon!"}
{"text":"Will not go again.  Used to be one of my favorite places downtown to eat.  They had messed an order up before, (gave me one pizza that wasn't mine, but I also didn't check until I go to my location)  this time I ordered on line at 1130, paid, said I would pick up about 1200.  Recived my receipt, got there at 1205, was finally acknowledged, and they couldn't find it, was told well it didn't come through.  I just said I wanted my money back, the manager came over found the order in they system, so obviously it came over, and said it would be credited to my accout in 2 days, we shall see.  No apology given, nothing.. poor customer service, if they had been busy like usual, I might be more understanding, but they were not."}
{"text":"Great pizza anyway you like it, I chose traditional crust with pepperoni, roasted red peppers, bacon a slather of basil pesto and extra cheese, all for a cool $8.50 with tax...in downtown Phoenix for lunchtime eats you can't beat that."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Super friendly service and pizza was so good and cheap!! Will come again for sure!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! 11 inch personal pizzas for $8.50... unlimited toppings. The pizza came out quick and was delicious. Highly recommend and will be coming back her many more times."}
{"text":"Pizza is just about the right size for a quick lunch, try the firecracker crust, not real spicy but has some taste to it. Only down side is crust is a little soggy for me, not a deal beaker but a little crisp to the bottom would be better.  Neat idea and pretty tastey all the way around."}
{"text":"Good pizza and very friendly employees. I'll try it again because it was decent, crust was good, and I think deserves another chance. I came on a Friday evening, the restaurant was clean but smelled of cleaning products the minute I walked in. Not very appetizing. Ordering the pizza was very easy, and the employees had great recommendations for a pizza made my way. I love the concept of my own pizza, baked quickly and ready in minutes. I will make sure to say \"easy on the olive oil\" next time because it dripped everywhere. The price was perfect. Looking forward to coming back, and I'll know where to park (for free!) for the fastest access to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I honestly didn't feel like dealing with dinner tonight .  So, I decided to visit this spot since I haven't had a chance to check it out.  When I walked in there was only one customer ahead of me. Easy to comprehend menu that has build your own pizza or you can choose one of their specialties for $7.99 which is quite reasonable.  Service was efficient, quick, and polite. The pizza itself was pretty good for a thin crust pizza and it was a pretty good size to boot!   Sure, it's not gourmet or artisan per say, but it beats calling the typical delivery places right?"}
{"text":"Stopped in during a lunch break while downtown. I have the Beast - basically a meat lovers - and a Pepsi for about $10. Good stuff, reasonable price. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of these fast-casual pizza places (Fired Pie, Mod Pizza, and Pieology) and tried Pizza Studio before going to a concert at Comerica Theatre. I was surprised to see they don't have an actual pizza oven, but rather the conveyor belt kind. I went with the original crust, marinara sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, and meatball. They also top it off with Italian seasoning. They brought our pizzas out in boxes, even though we said dine-in. Had to ask for plates/pans to eat on. The pizza was very good. The crust is not as crispy as the competition so it's easy fold in half like New York style pizza. Very tasty indeed. I tried some of my b/f's BBQ Chicken Bacon pizza, but the BBQ sauce was very subtle... you barely knew it was there. Not impressed with that, but the toppings were good."}
{"text":"Quick, easy with several tasty options. I love Alfredo sauce pizza and there are limited options that are this quick and easy in Phoenix. $8 for a personal pie and unlimited toppings is hard to beat. Always pleasant and clean."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza I have had in the Phoenix area.  If you are downtown, this is a must to stop at.  You can build your own with a ton of variety with gluten free and vegan pizza options.  The staff is super friendly and fast.  Wish I had a photo to share but I gobbled it up to fast!  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Very nice, very professional, very good build your own pizza. Short wait, polite employees, comfortable atmosphere. Yum!"}
{"text":"I have visited this place twice and both time the pizza is of the chain. I highly recommend the beast but everything has been good thus far. The staff is always friendly and smiling. The facility is clean and prices aren't bad. Definitely see myself being a regular at this joint!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great staff and yes the pizza is delicious! Coming from a Chicago gal thats saying something! Perfect lunch spot."}
{"text":"Good fast pizza.  Inexpensive for \"fast food\" that's decent.   Whole grain flaxseed crust covered in vegetables (Caramelized onions, roasted peppers, brocolini, tomatoes, zucchini)"}
{"text":"$8.50 for an unlimited topping 11 inch pizza. Perfect as a light dinner for two people.   Step 1: Choose base: regular, gluten free, flax, rosemary, or firecracker.  -We chose the firecracker. There was so much taste and the perfect amount of spice.   Step 2: Choose sauce and cheese. The server basically chose it for us - tomato and mozzarella. I don't know if there were other options.   Step 3: Choose any and all toppings. The toppings looked fresh and plentiful. We ended up with artichokes, olives, chicken sausage and a bit of bacon. We also got a dusting of truffle salt. I couldn't really taste it, but it's probably because of the other super flavorful ingredients.  Step 4: Sit and wait while your pizza bakes.  Step 5: Devour with a plethora of napkins nearby.  Verdict: It's TASTY, but very messy. There are forks and knives nearby if you need. The base does end up being soggy if you put too many toppings on. I'm guilty of always putting too many toppings on. How could you know when you're presented with so many options? I'm not great at making decisions like this. The pizza tried to be crisp. It really did. But alas, it could not be so this time around.   I really enjoyed this pizza joint. It was clean and the service was friendly. I'll be back again, especially since it's centrally located in the Downtown core."}
{"text":"Fast, casual pizza that you can customize to your liking...several different crusts, veggies, meats, and seasonings to choose from!  You can put as many different toppings on as you like all for $7.99.  The pizza is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza Studio is a great addition to the 'build your own/unlimited topping pizza' movement that seems to be sweeping Phoenix (or maybe the country... or maybe the WORLD!). The service here was great, very friendly and helpful. The concept (like many others in town) is you choose your crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings on your own personal pizza (11 inch thin crust). They have many options and seemingly limitless combos you can make. I had the rosemary herb crust with tomato and pesto sauces, mozz and goat cheese, garlic, tomatoes, roasted onion, roasted zucchini, bacon, basil, and arugula. It was extremely tasty and delivered to my table within 5 minutes. Also, it only cost 8$... and I brought half home... so a pretty great deal. How does it compare to other build your own joints in town? I would say much better than Fired Pie (both in flavor and selection) but not as good as My Pie (the one owned by Crust) which I thought had better overall flavor and gets points for being locally owned. Now, I would probably frequent Studio more than My Pie based on proximity to me. Regardless, if you're in the downtown area and feel like some quality personal pizza (and not some crappy Totino's), head to Pizza Studio!   PS They do validate parking for 2 hours PPS it's super weird that they don't have a phone so no calling this restaurant with questions... odd stuff."}
{"text":"So we were at a convention this past weekend and we wanted to get lunch. We've heard a lot about Pizza Studio and we decided to give it a shot. We took our orders, it was farley simple. We gave them our names when we went to made the orders. We were sitting at our table, we noticed my friend's pizza coming out, the runner yelled out Kristina,  his recipe said Kristian. The runner then gives my pizza to some random guy who said it was his. The random guy wrapped it up in the paper and ran out the door. Not to be racist or anything, but the runner was Mexican and so was the guy who took my friends pizza, the food runner had a pretty thick accent, I'm thinking he may have been in one it, just saying. Anyways, my food came out and it was pretty good. When my friend went up to confront them, they said we're going to make you another one, it's like they knew they gave it away and instead of informing him, it looks like they were going to make him one and not tell him they \"accidentally \" gave it away to the wrong guy, they weren't even apologetic. The food was great, but it seemed like they didn't really care that they gave my friends pizza away and it seemed like they wanted to cover it up by making him one and hoping he didn't notice."}
{"text":"I love speed and convenience here.  My favorite pizza is off the Starving Artist menu is the island pizza.  The Margherita pizza is good too.    There is also the option to create your own pizza with unlimited toppings for 2 dollars more, but the one time I did that I didn't like it very much.  Too many toppings proved to be overwhelming so I recommend trying one from the starving artists menu if it is your first time since the combinations are tried and true."}
{"text":"I went for my second visit on Thursday, and it was just as good as the first time. I do want to eventually try one of the menu pizza options, but I can't help but load it up when you tell me 'as many toppings as I want'. This time I tried their rosemary and herb crust, love it! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"If in town and looking for a good pie, look no further.  It isn't the best I have ever has but it's very good.  They have a order as you go style system and the staff was real good about explaining the different options. First the crust, I got the firecracker, which is traditional with spice. (Great) The sauce, tomato base with a touch of garlic, followed by some vegetables and all the meats.  My version of the supreme and I would eat it again.  However, because they have so many different choices I would create another masterpiece and bet it would be equally tasty.  All in all if with your family or alone it is affordable and gives everyone the opportunity to make what they want with the cleanup."}
{"text":"First time here. Clean, quick, and friendly service. We did two different build-your-own pizzas, which both were delicious! The crust had a nice crisp and char to it, and floors all blended very nicely. Good atmosphere, with paintings from local artists displayed on the walls."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for a conference and I love pizza. Loved the buffalo chicken pizza for a quick, delicious and inexpensive dinner. Really wish I had one these in my city."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to stop for pizza after skating at CitySkate. It's just steps from the outdoor rink and faces the festively lit courtyard and splash pad.   We had our skating club pizza party there (kids and adults) and it was easy for all our members to get just what they liked on their custom pizza. The seating area in the back has a long padded bench and it's easy to push tables together for a group of 15-20. It was a Thursday so it wasn't too busy and finding seating was easy.  The manager and counter staff were friendly and helpful making it a fun experience. The pizzas were all very good and I liked that they were thin crust and fast to cook. The drinks were all self service which was perfect for our group. I was also surprised at how good the chocolate chip cookies were.  Side note: They display and sell the paintings of local artists and take no commission. If you are a local artist this is a great place to display your paintings or photographs."}
