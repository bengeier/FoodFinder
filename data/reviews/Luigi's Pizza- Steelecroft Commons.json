{"text":"I wanted to like it, but it fell flat. 

First of all I told the girl who answered the phone what size (a large) and what toppings we wanted on our pizza. She responded by asking me if I wanted an extra large or a Super. I restated that I wanted a large, then she asked what I wanted on it, apparently not catching any of what I said. We ordered 2 toppings, nothing fancy.

The crust was undercooked. A big no no when you've got thin crust pizza, It needs to be cooked to stand up to toppings. Also there is a delicate balance when it comes to how much sauce, cheese, additional toppings on a thin crust in particular.  There was just way too much everything. The pizza was heavy and soggy. The flavor itself was alright. I'd give it a C+, but the undercooked crust and too much topping made this pizza an overall disappointment. 

I've heard people say that it's better if you eat in. Perhaps I would try it again, but the lack of good customer service plus crappy pizza was disappointing."}
{"text":"Ash h is on crack. Maybe the best new york style in charlotte... Dont order extra cheese, you won't be able to expel the deliciousness for a week, if you know what I mean. 

But for real, good sauce, good cheese, good dough. Hard to beat."}
{"text":"Best calzone I have eaten in the Charlotte area.  Lots of ricotta.  They are always pack full and they don't skimp on the meat (I like to get pepperoni and sausage).  

Pizza is real good.  I haven't been to NY, so can't compare.  They are huge.  The smallest pizza box won't even fit in my fridge.

Philly sub is awesome and of course, loaded up!

Oh yeah, garlic bread with cheese is a great...really cheesy with butter and garlic!  Mmm!"}
{"text":"My family has been a fan for years. Pizza is fantastic, as close to \"New York Style \" as you can get here in Charlotte. Portions are huge, you definitely get a lot of food for the price. There is a reason why they are still in business after all these years, and why they have more than one location. They have a great selection of other items as well, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"As far as Charlotte pizza goes this place is prob one of the best.  That being said, they market themselves as NY pizza.  I am from NY and this is def NOT NY pizza.  The pies are big but way over priced.  Their sauce is borderline horrible!  We ordered a chicken parm hero and got a deep fried chicken breast with no seasoning on some soggy bread and tasteless sauce.  I will prob continue to go there for the pizza on occasion but I wouldn't recommend anything else."}
{"text":"I don't recommend this pizza experiance. Bought a veggie pizza, wasn't satisfied, called and was transferred to Tony and discussed my dissatisfaction. He offered to replace the pizza. I talked with my family and we decided to get a cheese pizza. I arrived 30 minutes later and returned most of the veggie pizza and the replacement pizza he showed me was floppy and didn't look appealing. I asked for my money back and he said no. He was aggressive and loud and was insulted I didn't like his pizza. I reacted poorly to his aggressiveness and gave him the bird and left."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza in south Charlotte.  There really isn't a better option."}
{"text":"Good NY style pizza.  Not the best.  Disappointed that they don't make homemade ranch.  

The service is fast and always ready when u get there.  They don't deliver contrary to some sites.

Their pastrami sub had excellent flavor but was light on the meat...I guess all pastrami sandwiches aren't piled high?

Great to support a local pizza place.  Will go back but not my first choice."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and almost  like it better heated up at home. Great cheese steaks also Nuff said!"}
{"text":"Its a hole in a wall, nothing special, the pizza is not good at all and forget about the pasta .  They use canned products so i don't think it's worthy price wise , like i said it is a hole in a wall."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte, nobody else is even close!  These guys do it right; everything from the bread the ship in for their subs to the perfect, thin, NY style pizza.  I would eat here everyday, but I would be as big as a house...  I love this place!  Really nice people as well.  You can tell they are a family business the moment you want through the door."}
{"text":"Used to love this pizza place. I think maybe it has changed owners or cooks. Went out of my way to go here before Christmas after not having been in a few years and was very disappointed. I ordered pizza slices and a salad. The pizza slices were dry, very little cheese and dried out tomato sauce. They looked as if they had been in a refrigerator for 2 days then attempted to be reheated. The salad was a dull iceberg lettuce and a plastic pack of salad dressing. My husband ordered a philly cheese steak sandwich that was tasteless as well. Never again."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza but pricey.  Taste great but not worth the price u pay. Service is ok a little slow and rude sometimes."}
{"text":"Crust tested like, and had the consistency of cardboard. Still looking for neopolitan pizza....desperate"}
{"text":"Classic ny style pizza in Charlotte. Luigi a displaced Italian splits his time between stores but it doesn't affect the quality ... This place is top notch."}
{"text":"OK, I still LOVE the pizza.  

Unfortunately, my non-pizza-loving hubby ordered a meatball sub and was really disappointed at the scant amount of meatballs.  \"All bread, no balls\" was how he described it.  He said it was tasty but that he'd request extra meatballs next time.

I ordered a \"side salad\" with a slice of their DEEE-LISH pizza.  Their idea of a salad consisted of a heaping bed of pale iceberg lettuce, tons of black olive slices (which I don't like, but that's my problem), and one thick slice of tomato.  Really? 

I will come back again and again, but just for the pizza."}
{"text":"I'm a Jersey girl who grew up a few miles outside of New York, so I grew up with and have always loved NY style pizza.  When I have pizza from Luigi's, I feel like I'm back at home.  The first time I visited Luigi's and waited for my to-go order, the owner (originally from Italy) introduced himself and offered me a small piece of pizza while I was waiting.  He said he wanted me to taste the pizza fresh out of the oven.  So delicious - I return again and again for a little piece of home."}
{"text":"OMG!  Finally a great Pizza in Charlotte!  Absolutely great service and perfect NY Pizza.  You can tell from the moment you walk in and smell the aroma of great food and see the owner hand tossing 20\"er's into the air, that this will be amazing.  Hot, perfectly cooked with just the right amount of topping and sauce, the flavors of my pepperoni,  sausage and onion pizza were on top of a perfectly cooked slice!  Look at my picture and tell me the last time you could properly eat a pizza in Charlotte!??  A perfect crunch to my folded slice and then....yum!  My wife had a chicken salad and loved it.  Overly ambitious with a 20\", I now have a midnight snack!

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand all the hype here. My wife and I ordered takeout, got home ready to have this amazing experience we heard about, and we were severely disappointed. Pizza was undercooked and EXTREMELY greasy. We threw the whole pie in the garbage, excluding the two bites we ate from one slice. If this is what pizza is like up north, count me as one happy southerner."}
{"text":"Good pizza! Not always the best customer service, but the pizza is worth just popping in and out. They seem to be out of some very basic supplies such as, lids for cups and containers to take out parm cheese. 

Other than that, the pizza is good and worth a try!"}
{"text":"Legit thin crust/NY style pizza. Born in raised in CT, grew up on New York and New Haven pizza, and this is a taste of home every time. Go to is two slices with sliced meatball on top. The buffalo chicken sandwich is also on point. Do it!"}
{"text":"Trashed the pizza that was given to us...First they messed up my order, then they don't want to admit that they messed up. Manager gives us a credit after going back-and-forth about their mistake... I tried to use my credit that is owed to us and the employee at the register (AMY) claims we already used our credit when we never did....Talk about awful customer service....  And the managers don't want to come on the phone to handle the issue that his clerk has caused. Will never come back here again... terrible service"}
{"text":"Ordered the Lugis special pizza...first time here. Did not taste like NY Pizza at all. Pizza was bland and like watery (not a yummy oily watery, but literally watery). I gave it 2 stars because when the pizza got cold it tasted better  (also had to add enough crushed red pepper and oregano to give it some taste). Anyway, we tried it and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great and affordable Italian,  $50 for a family of 4. Good deal.  Had to wait a little because they cook everything from scratch."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed I had high expectations because of the good reviews on here. First, I had call wanted to place a delivery order, but they inform me that they do not deliver so I decided to pick it up.  The fried ravioli were ok, it has a thin cheese filling. The garlic knots have a good flavor but the texture however was kinda spongy.
Now let's talk about the pizza, it is so bland! I can't even taste the sauce nor the cheese. It kinda reminds me of the pizza from my middle school cafeteria,which it also taste a slightly better than this place. 
I would not return. sorry !"}
{"text":"This pizza is probably the closest to ny pizza as you can get.  I love the taste. The crust is a little hit or miss, not because of the taste but sometimes it is so absolutely thin that you can't pick it up like you would a slice in ny....but it's not a deal breaker by any means!  I have found myself finding any excuse to justify me driving from monroe to Steele creek to have 2 slices there and get a pie for home.  Now I'm craving it, great!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite pizza in Charlotte. I found Luigi's when I first moved to Charlotte and lived in Steele Creek, now I live uptown and make the regular trip down on a weekend for their pizza. As a New Yorker it takes a lot for me to like a pizza and they do it right!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a strip mall luigi's make so damn solid ny pizza.  The pricing is spot on and their meals are awesome as well.  Typical pasta dishes and pizza just like at any solid pizza spot.  Alway's great to order and get some takeout when i am too lazy to cook."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. The past three pizzas have tasted like the ovens were not properly clean. What happen to the quality? After being a loyal customer for a year, I gave this place three chances and all three times, I got a pizza that tasted like the oven was not cleaned or scraped. Now I have to find better place for true NY Pizza."}
{"text":"The staff in the Steele Creek location are remarkable.  Friendly, courteous and very helpful with meal selection.  They made us feel as if they were delighted to have us as guest.  When I see great customer service, I'm sure to acknowledge it.  I've eaten here several times and it has never been a disappointment.  I had my niece visiting from out of town and she's never experienced authentic Italian pizza, so I had to delight her taste buds.  She was stunned at the size of this 20\" pie! Before it was delivered to the table, she was pretty sure she'd consume four slices! She made it through 1 1/4 slices.  The prices are reasonable. For the pizza (xtra cheese added) , two bottled waters and one fountain drink, my total was 27.00.  That fed 3 with leftovers! (winning)  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Been to both locations here in Charlotte..by far the best NY style pizza. I will never order from anywhere else."}
{"text":"Best pizza anywhere near lake Wylie.  Real NY style.  The only down side is they don't deliver.  But if you like NY style pizza it's worthy.  Also have great subs and wings."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong. I love pizza! thin crust, thick crust, I doesn't matter as long as it has flavor. This pizza does not have flavor. 
Even the Stromboli was... meh! 
It's one thing to make a huge pizza (bravo!), but it's quite another to make it taste better than tomato paste on a cracker. (The cheese adds no flavor)
So, if you're just looking to fill your stomach, one slice is plenty. If you want to enjoy your pizza and plan for the next time you'll order it, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Best pizza I ever had. I was worried about moving from New York to north Carolina and not being able to have real NY pizza but man we found this place and man its amazing. Friendly staff, love that the owner is actually involved in cooking and everything. If I could eat one thing forever without getting sick or fat it would be luigis pizza."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza spots in Charlotte. Excellent pizza, I always order it well done, I like mine crispy.  The sauce is great and I think they use a semolina flour, which makes the pizza way better.  Great place to hit with the kids.  Atmosphere is plain old pizza parlor and you have to get your lazy butt out of the chair to get your order, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Both locations produce great pizza and have a friendly staff. The slices are giant! Also the crust is cooked perfectly, so that it it's slightly crispy and complements the pizza..the jumbo is enough for two meals for a family of 4"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, if you're down for thin crust. Nothing spectacular, but not disappointing. You'll get a legit pizza. Enough said."}
{"text":"Always consistent. Perfect NY style crust. Flavorful sauce. Call ahead and avoid the line. Friends who have ordered sandwiches have been pleased."}
{"text":"Always good and always on time. Pizza is very very much like New York pizza and it's dang good. The staff are plenty nice and the place is clean. Not to mention they order the food from a real Italian food supplier (I used to work for) so it's spot on."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good , I like there regual pizza however I do not recommend there Sicilian pizza because the crust was hard and over cooked . The sauce was good on it it had a nice olive oil flavor . I also enjoyed there egg plant parm sanwitch I had that and it was very good but it could of had a little more sauce ."}
{"text":"We just moved from Chicago... so high standards for pizza. This was pretty good stuff. We would order again."}
{"text":"Best slice around. Authentic NY Style pies up to 20in and also Sicilian pizzas. Casual for eating in or to-go orders. Worth the drive from Rock Hill."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever;) know the owners, great family and I've always enjoyed eating slices the size of your head.. don't stop there they have awesome sandwiches.. and my kids love the pasta dishes as well, when they're not dousing Parmesan on cheese pizza:) love this place 

We also order for our company meetings;)! Everyone loves it"}
{"text":"Always good, I have to laugh at the naysayers! Luigi's is consistent. We have been going there for seven years. Never disappointed. Terrific pizza, always fresh salad, tasty Italian sandwiches. Keep up the good work and don't worry about the wanna be's."}
{"text":"Luigi's is one of the dozen or so Pizza places in and around the Steele Creek area.  I've ordered from them several times mainly because of their proximity to my residence as well as to the awesome bar at Hickory Tavern just next door.  

As a far as the pizza is concerned, Luigi's is good.  There isn't anything uber special or unique about their dough or sauce.  They have the typical varieties and they bake the pies just the way I like them.  

The only challenge I've ever had with them was with their side condiments.  They had red peppers and parmesian cheese on the tables but didn't offer or provide to go packets.  I love my red peppers and not having them definitely left a bad taste in my mouth.

Will I go back? Sure. It is next door to my favorite watering hole."}
{"text":"All I can say is \"wow\".  Wasn't too sure about the food when we first walked in but glad we stayed.  Pizza was tremendous and delicious but the garlic knots were the best I have ever eaten.   I have eaten a lot of pizza especially being from NY but this was one of the best here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This location is great! Love their sun-dried tomatoes and fresh garlic pizza.  I love their anchovies but it's a little too salty sometimes and sometimes it's just perfect.  Love the service and their huge slice of pizza for such a fair price! Their side salad with oil and vinegar is my must have with my slice of pizza every visit."}
{"text":"Have lived in Charlotte/LKW area for 7 years and this is the best pizza in the area. Best I've had since moving from NY. We normally call ahead and the food is always ready when we get there. Excellent salads & garlic knots as well."}
{"text":"Definitely true New York pizza! The slices are huge and knots are delicious! The prices are just like New York pizzeria prices. My husband and I usually eat for right around $10. We are so glad to have a piece of home down in the south."}
{"text":"Wow!  As close to NY pizza as I have had in  charlotte.  We got pizza by the slice and be warned that the slices are huge!  One was plenty.  We got one cheese, one meatball and one Buffalo Chicken pizza.  All were delicious.  Just the right amount of cheese,  thin and crispy with a perfect crust.  I just wish this was closer to my home!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible! Nothing is homemade, everything is from the freezer. The guys who run this place are pigs, and treat their employees like trash! One time my family and I were in there an the guys working kept talking about how they would pleasure themselves in the RESTAURANT bathroom, what the heck?! Do not recommend. Mod Pizza in Rivergrate is so much better!"}
{"text":"If your a pizzeria using the NY reputation. Then please have a NY menu.  We were all dumbfounded to know there was no alfredo nor a la vodka pasta dishes, not even beef patties available.  They only had spaghetti and meatballs and baked ziti, couldnt add chicken to it. The dishes were also in the small to-go plates not the large ones and that was a disspointment as well. For the price id expect. The large to-go plate.  In the past we ordered a pie with extra cheese.  But the extra cheese.....i dont know where they get the idea extra cheese means sprinkle a little something in the center. But again...if your going to represent a ny pizzeria then please provide as such. Extra cheese means.....extra cheese. The pizza should be white. 

The pizza tastes good..however 9 times of 10 its a soggy pizza. I dont know why i keep going back. Its just close by.  But if you have a chance to go to Lorenzos in ballantyne. Then you will see what i mean. Business is business but its frustrating as a customer to walk in to a ny style pizzeria and not have the same menu options nor quality. And yes im from brooklyn,ny."}
{"text":"Real New York Pizza in Charlotte!!  Steele Creek store is excellent, South Tryon by Walmart isn't as good."}
{"text":"The pizza here is good, but not worthy of the hype. Yes, the slices are huge and you get your money's worth. No, the pizza isn't the best in Charlotte. I think it needs more flavor/seasoning as the pizza is bland. I prefer Mod Pizza and Marcos Pizza in Steele Creek. 

FYI, the philly cheese steak is decent, but not better than Penn Station."}
{"text":"I have to update my review of Luigi's. While it absolutely breaks my heart that they do not deliver it is probably best for my waist and wallet. However, ordering pick up is almost as easy as delivery because they stick to the quoted time exactly. Every time I order they quote me 15 minutes and my order has often time been ready at 15 minutes on the dot from the time my phone call ends. Sometimes the pizza is ready earlier, though never late. That is the sign of an efficient restaurant!
The pizza is always hot and delicious and the personal pizza is way more than enough for one meal. They also have ginormous calzones and stromboli. I love their tiramisu! Everything we have tried there is so delicious they are worth the drive, even when I feel like being lazy and ordering delivery."}
{"text":"We had the Pizza, Garlic Knots and side salad. The side salad was nothing special, but the garlic knots were great.. lots of flavor, served hot with a side of Marinara. 
The pizza was excellent. A little overcooked, making it a little more crispy then we would have liked but we will certainly be back again.
There is a lot of seating but it is cramped. If you get ANYTHING larger than a 16\" Pizza, it FILLS the table. 
Overall, very good. We will likely go back."}
{"text":"The pizza IMO is some of the best in Charlotte. Me and my son go often enough that they know how we like our pizza cooked (WELL DONE!). Louie, Tony and Pablo make the pizza right every time ?. Try the Steak sub and the Italian Sub they are very good also. I wish they stayed open later for those late night pizza runs but realize the staff have families also. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Le sigh. I miss the Luigi's that used to be in Dilworth, right next to the Teeter on East Blvd. I miss their giant, cheesy slices with just the right amount of grease and crispity crunchity crust. When Luigi's left their spot in Dilworth, I think I shed at least a few tears. But alas, here's how it went down last weekend when we were driving around Steele Creek...

Hubs: \"So, you're hungry, right - what are you in the mood for?\"
Me: \"Mmm, I don't know. Something quick would probably be best.\"
Hubs: \"K, how about Chick-Fil-A?\"
Me: \"Ehhh, no. I'd love a big ole slice of pizza. Let me get out my Yelp app.\"
Me: \"Stop the car, I see Luigi's! Done. Pizza. Thanks.\"

I popped right in, grabbed a slice o' cheese to go for $2.25, a cup for water and stuffed my face while we made our way back north. 

A few things to note about this location:

1) There is quite a bit of seating, and naturally, kiddos love pizza. Lots of seats, lots of pizza, lots of kids. Just sayin'. 
2) If you want a side of anything with your 'za (ranch, marinara, etc.) expect to pay for it. Literally. A side of ranch (requested by another patron) was $.50. While I understand the need to cover costs, it seems a bit silly (until people start abusing it, I suppose). 
3) Don't even think about trying to scam soda into your water cup. You shouldn't be doing it anyway (just buy the damn soda if you want one), but there is a big, bright sign that threatens back payment if the Luigi's staff sees soda in your clear cup. Again - a bit of overkill, but I get it. 

Luigi's - please come back to Dilworth or South End or somewhere closer to Uptown so I can further stuff my face with your delicious slices!"}
{"text":"This was probably one of the best pizzas by the slice I've had in Charlotte.  We stopped in on a whim to square our stomachs before a party.  When our name was called and these giant surfboards of pizza came out we all kind of freaked out a little bit."}
{"text":"Tried a medium with pep, black olive.  The meat was ok but the sauce was a little bland and so was the crust.  Reminded me of Sbarro/mall pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza is the real deal. This is as good as any pie I've had in jersey, NYC, or philly. So if you're a transplant like me, then I'm tellin ya it's just like pie from home! And huge slices too. Just like home."}
{"text":"I'd have to say i am a snob when it comes to pizza considering the fact that i grew up in CT where pizzas are made in a brick oven. These pizza places in the south could never compare but this is one of the only few places I'll grab some pizza from. They're consistently good here. However, i will admit there has been a time or 2 where I've ordered from them and the pizza dough was beyond rubbery and chewy. It was a workout and a half trying to eat through it."}
{"text":"This is our favorite lunch pizza spot.  The slices are huge.  They need 2 paper plates.  Perfect new York style.  Crust is thin but holds up under generous cheese and toppings.  The shop is very casual , order at the counter and fill and refill your choice of drink.my only complaint was we order a large to go .  Not only was it smashed in the box it was undercooked.  So we strictly eat in and are never ever disappointed.   The key is to eat in."}
{"text":"We often order take out pizza from Luigi's. The cheese pizza takes like something you would find in New York. The crust is delicious and thin and the food quality is very consistent. Best pizza in the area! The service leaves a bit to be desired."}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. Ever. !!!!! Seriously great size and flavor and the garlic knots are awesome too. Friendly staff. Fast food but not too fast. The only negative thing I can say is... 30 cents for a water cup... Whyyyyy?"}
{"text":"Got a couple of pizzas to go. Order was on time. Got the 20\" size. So big they have to fold over the outer edges to fit in box.  This is an authentic NY style pizza. Thin crust.  Not crisp though. Very good. This is the best pizza in the area.  We usually go for a quick slice (which is huge by the way). But the whole pies were excellent."}
{"text":"Luigi's is still the best New York pizza in Charlotte and with two locations, they are killing it. This is the good sh... stuff. Thin crust, large sized slices that are bigger than the 9 inch paper plate. The kind that you have to fold in half and still support because the \"spine\" isn't strong enough by itself. Cheezy, drippy, goodness.

I'm told that they also have a great cheese steak and there are some other cooked items. I wouldn't know. For me, it's all about the pie."}
{"text":"this is the worst restaurant ever!!!! the managers and staff are horrible in every facet of their job! i have called the store for 3 days in hopes of making a complaint with the manager. i was finally able to speak the owner luigi and he was nasty and did not care at all that i was an unhappy customer. his customer service deplorable to say the least. do not patron this establishment."}
{"text":"Best pizza that we have found in Charlotte. This coming from someone who grew up in New York and a wife from Chicago. However, the WallMart location makes a better pie (pizza that is)."}
{"text":"Having lived in NY for the first four decades of my life, I know what good pizza tastes like. And I know how hard it is to find in other parts of the country. That is why it's nice to, every once in a while, stumble upon a good pizza joint in a state not named New York.

Luigi's makes pretty good pizza. The crust is not too thick and not too thin. The sauce is okay.  The amount of cheese is impressive- however, the consistency (too gooey- not enough elasticity) tells me it may not be real whole milk mozzarella.  The prices are good and the pies are enormous. A small pie is equivalent to some large pies at other establishments. 

Overall- good and satisfying pizza. And from a place NOT located in NY!"}
{"text":"I LOVE their Italian sub here.  So good!  

On top of that, it's a very clean place with great customer service.  They are quick with getting your meal out to you, and the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have ever had.  I always compare any pizza place to luigi's.  The toppings are fresh and the taste is wonderful."}
{"text":"Never have i !!! I decided to wait til today to write this review until i calmed down from the situation that occurred here last night. Myself and my significant other  was on a hunt for a really good pizza so we decided to try this place out. I ordered over the phone for a pick up and they informed me it would be ready in 15 to 20 minutes. My daughter and myself went in to pick it up. When we came in a guy behind the counter jokingly stated (laughing) hey what type of fur is that you have on? I replied and smiled its a rabbit fur! He laughed and said hey i didn't know their were black rabbits as he laughed and ran to the back and said hold on let me go ask someone in the back i have no clue who the guy was from the back if he was the cook or what i really don't know, he then came up in the front with the other guy laughing again jokingly mam there is no such thing as a black rabbit, again i replied yes they definitely exist. It was all fun and games until he then stated where in Africa?? So black rabbits in Africa?  Whoa, no longer was anything funny to me anymore once that statement was made i then told myself let me sign this receipt so i can get out of here, so my daughter apparently the entire time this was going on took it upon herself to show him pictures of black rabbits so in awe and shock he stated as we were going out the door oh well they look good for a black rabbit?? Oh boy i am just so appalled by all of this! When i came home i was telling my significant other about it and he to was upset about all this taking place and excuse my french but it is no way in hell he could not know the things he was saying was very offensive and pretty much racial slurs, in the way he referenced and comparing a black rabbit must be in Africa as well as the comment about oh well that looks good to be a black rabbit. So much more happened from my significant other calling to ask about this entire situation and the guy on the phone who stated  he is  the owner/manager of Luigi's, how you as a  Manager/Owner of an establishment would allow everything that happened last night to happen and or take place. With all of this being said i hate this even happened i can't even give an actual review on how the pizza taste because we threw the pizza away because we were all in such disgust!!!!"}
