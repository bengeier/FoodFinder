{"text":"Gregoire's was a local institution in the town of Ste-Martine until they moved to Mercier a few years ago.

I remember stopping for a steamie (hot dog) and fry with my grand mother when I was a wee boy. At the time it was a little hot dog stand, much different than the current version in Mercier.

Gregoire's is not a large fast food joint. You can get the typical stiff like hot dogs, hamburgers, fries, etc. You can also get clubs, chicken sandwiches and other stuff.

The service at the counter is great, really, it's great. Usually one of the owners or relatives are at the counter. I don't know how they do it, but they make you feel like they care. Care about what you might ask? I don't know, but that's how I feel.

Now the food. I really find it over priced and nothing special really. Hot dogs are nothing special, same type as those you buy at the grocery store. Hamburgers are good, but no better. They are also on the small side for the price. The poutine's are a step up. The fries & sauce are good, and the cheese to fry ratio seems adequate, but again, high in price for what you get.

Overall, it's an ok place to go if you're in the area and in a hurry. For myself, the only reason I go is when I'm out voted by the group I'm with. It's not because it's terrible, it's because I feel there are better options close by for the same dollar value."}
{"text":"Drove out from Montreal to Mercier to try their famous poutine and the whole drive I kept thinking; this better be good... It was!
Was it worth the drive? Not sure. But if ever I am in the area, this is definitely where I'd go for a poutine. The ratio of sauce-fries-cheese was great! So much cheese and the fact that they slice it, ensures you get cheese in every bite.. Yum!"}
{"text":"I know this place is one of Mercier's best known joints, but I don't see it.
I had 2 dogs and of course, as usual, had to try the poutine.
It wasn't awful, but the sauce wasn't up to par, and the fries seemed a little raw.
Maybe, I just went at the wrong time, but I won't be rushing over there to quench my poutine craving.
Go and judge for yourself but you can't say I didn't warn you:)"}
{"text":"This place is always full anytime of the day. But..... It is actually very good if your crave greasy stuff like hung over food! Hot dogs and poutine= nailed it!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are in the Mercier area and want to chow down on some seriously delicious Casse-Croute grub, this is your place. Hell it's worth the long drive we took. Club Sammich AWESOME. Cheeseburgers AWESOME. French Fries AWESOME. The place is spotless; the service is great and friendly, lots of seating room, but the lunch lineups can bust the block. The food is fresh, no frozen crap here and the menu is HUGE. Some of the best Burgers & Fries I've had in a long time. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast! Served from 8 to 11 every day. Had the Western Omelette with poutine cheese. Very good! Will come back."}
