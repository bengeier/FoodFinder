{"text":"I am pleased to see this addition to the neighbourhood. For my first visit I had a spicy tuna roll and a dynamite roll, and both were a good size and tasty. The rolls should have been assembled with more precision as they were a bit messy, but the ingredients were fresh and tasty. I really like the squeeze of lemon in the dynamite roll. This is my new cheap sushi grab in the neighbourhood (especially after Yuzu No Hana gave me food poisoning recently)."}
{"text":"This is a Korean fast food joint that sells Donburi and sushi. I went here for lunch on a weekday and ordered the spicy BBQ pork donburi.

Honestly, I thought it would taste great, but the meat tasted like it had been defrosted after being frozen for a long time. It was hard and I had to chew it several times to break it down. The spice was also disappointing as it tasted like MSG and there was no other flavour to it other than the Korean spicy pepper paste. The rice was also hard and had some  clusters to it that was hard to break down.

Although the price is great, I don't think I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Great chef and staff. While there are many sushi spots in Downtown Toronto, this is my go-to spot. Food here is great, I really love their Salmon/Avocado rolls and their Spicy Salmon rolls. This place has both takeout and catering service, and also offer discounts at the end of the day - a very nice gesture from the restaurant. Definitely a hidden gem in Toronto."}
{"text":"Soooo apparently the sushi owner sold the business and it is now operating under the name of Kimama (without the Sushi). It is now a Korean fast food joint selling popular rice dishes. Boohoo no more sushi.  So much for finding the sushi marche sushi chef. He's yet again gone missing. Lol. 

Previous original review of Kimama Sushi: A neighbourhood gem tucked away on Mercer street. It's not that noticeable from the street but once you've had some of their sushi you'll be back. Great sushi and sashimi and the chef throws in some extra stuff too sometimes. The chef used to own and run  Sushi Marche in Leslieville which I  used frequent often.  Now the chef has moved to this location. So happy to have found him again and will be visiting soon."}
{"text":"This place make THE BEST KAMIKAZE rolls for sure! I am an absolute fan of this place and the staff is always nice and friendly. Unlike other sushi places, ingredients are fresh and new, never felt like having a left-overs or day-old food. Also, seems like they really care how the food is presentable and taste good. Despite the fact that the menu is a bit pricey, I would definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"Sigh... I'm really torn on the rating for this place. I'd give it a 3.5 but it's hard to decide between 3 and 4. Seeing how I've rated some really good places as \"4\" I don't think I can give it to this one.

Generally, I look for value at these types of casual take out places. It has to be cheap and accessible and with a decent taste. When I first discovered it, I was really happy because it was exactly that and I was happy to support a small business in the area. Over time though, I noticed that they're closed occasionally... I understand sometimes it's not the owner's fault but it makes it kind of unreliable, if you plan to go there and it's closed. One time it was for a hydro issue which is understandable but another time the owner just wanted to take time off over holidays.  Again, it's not a big problem but it doesn't help overall.

At first they had two portion sizes, small and large. For me, a small would be one meal and large would be dinner + leftovers for breakfast (so 1.5/2). That was very convenient for my dinner take out option as it was cheap and small. Now, they changed it to one size which is huge and way too much for one person (imo). Also the new container is the translucent round type that's hard to open/close. The price has also gone up and I can't attribute it to min wage as I think it's only one person working (the owner?). For this price, I'd much rather go to a sit down restaurant with a friend rather than have this take out stretch over two days.

Now the food quality... well, to me it's okay. It's similar to what I'd make at home if I were to make the same dishes. It's nice that they have japchae noodles as an option as well. There's definitely places that make it better but for take out, it'd be okay if it was also a good value. I think I'll still stop by once in awhile but probably not as much nowadays."}
{"text":"Craving sushi and didn't feel like making dinner so tried this new hidden mom and pop sushi joint that just opened up around the corner from our place. Spartan layout with one communal table which we shared with another couple who had ordered the $35 dinner special. Best for takeout and catering (order ahead since there is one sushi chef so you don't have to wait if you are in a rush). If you have time the sashimi and nigiri are def worth the wait. Nice selection of popular Japanese unsweetened iced teas (green, oolong) and soft drinks that are hard to find nearby...otherwise they offer complimentary self serve iced lemon water."}
{"text":"This place is great! The chef is super friendly and makes high quality, fresh sushi at a good price. You can tell he takes great care and pride in his work. 

It may not look like much from the outside but the fish there always been fresh and high quality. Been there over a handful of times, ordered different things every time and have always been pleased with the food."}
{"text":"Ordered the $100 omakase for take out. It came with rolls only, not a single piece of sushi or sashimi. The rolls were nothing special either, got a bunch of California rolls, avocado rolls and cucumber rolls (yes they give these cheap rolls for omakase). I think the only roll that was kind of special was the kamikaze roll,   all the other rolls were just rolls you couldve got at any ayce places (actually maybe even worse because there were not any dragon rolls, just plain spicy salmon/tuna rolls).

I guess for compensation they gave us like 6 gzoyas for free. But they were like cold leftover ones.

The tray we got was not worth the $100 at all and it was no where near omakase. Would never come or order from here again, what a scam."}
{"text":"I've ordered Kimama Donburies twice on Uber Eats and I'm a huge fan! I've never been to the physical location but it seems like I might have to since I can't stop thinking about the donburies here. 

The first time, I ordered BBQ Beef Donburi on rice and it was pretty filling (especially for $12+tax)! I tired some of my friend's who got the Chicken Teriyaki Donburi with rice and glass noodles and I regretted not getting the glass noodles because it was soo good!

The next time, I got the Spicy BBQ Pork Donburi on glass noodles and it was really yummy - I've been craving it since!!"}
{"text":"Been here for lunch twice now and both times got the spicy pork bulgogi ($11.99), which is very good, a bit of sweetness but also has a pretty kick if you like spicy.  The portion is also very good as well, lots of meat in the bowl unlike in a small bento box."}
{"text":"I tried the chicken teriyaki and spicy pork donburi; both were juicy and flavourful, portions were good. 
The kimchi side dish was a nice add on, its light tartness complimented the richness of the meat quite well.

Lastly, the service was excellent! I asked for more meat and got more meat (no extra charge). Reason might also be because it was after dinner time and we were probably the last customers."}
