{"text":"This place was great. It get's full at lunch. I had a cheese steak, wish I took a pic before eating it.  The Philly cheese steak was amazing, it had meat, and onions.  ALOT OF ONIONS. That's no complaint though, that's the flavor. My complaint is the \"hygiene\" of this place. I get it, it's full. But c'mon. Clean it up a bit! They try, I know. But when I got there, the table was dirty. Otherwise, it was amazing, and I would totally go back."}
{"text":"HUGE: Fan, Hoagies, Value.  Is it retro-fitted, sleek, modern? None of that.  Here's what you get and I'll take it every time.  The place may look old, but they keep it clean. I've never gone in and found neglected tables, trash on the floor or super sloppy drink station.  The hoagie menu is simple, hot or cold.  I really enjoy the Supreme and Texas Ranch(hot).  The chicken salad is a little sparse.  Maybe that's why it's good.  They used the rotisserie chicken they prepare all day.  The tuna is good too.  I am Southern, mayo is in my dna.  Most sandwiches don't come with it, they usually suggest it. You may want to ask for it. The guy at the counter is friendly, knowledgeable, and bilingual.  Fast friendly service? SEXY!.  As for value for the price of a giant at a competitor you can get 2 large here.  ($13 bucks for a deli sandwich is steep anywhere.)   They have that great chicken and some pretty good sides as well.  And the garlic bread does dive cooking proud.  You can get a really good meal for under $10 bucks.  I go for the sandwiches, not the chip selection.  Yes, the neighbor slightly sketchy but I've never gone in and not seen policeman either dining or coming and going.  This place deserves a try just on consistent quality service alone."}
{"text":"The subs are the best! A bit pricey,  but good food. The neighborhood is definitely improving.  Check out the crime stats on charmeck.org if you don't think so.

Neighborhood just won 2014 City of Charlotte's  Neighborhood Leadership Award for embracing diversity.  Only six similar awards were given out and this neighborhood earned one of the six!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food with great people. The wait is worth it and it is constantly busy but that's how you know it's good. Love the chicken breast hoagie and Greek salad."}
{"text":"This is a delicious, fast, and inexpensive hoagie shop near NoDa. We've only gotten sandwiches to-go as the ambiance isn't fantastic, but if you need to find a large meaty sandwich for your husband like I was, then you should give it a try! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food amazing price.. lost a star for menu selection and not having a good chip variety.. All in all amazing phillys and great customer service.. also a awesome hangout lots of servicemen eat here!"}
{"text":"Subs, Heroes, Hoagies call them whatever you want The Steak and Hoagie Shop has the best hoagies in Charlotte. This is a Greek restaurant and sandwich shop where they make their bread fresh.  The bread is so warm, soft and full of flavor that it is the perfect compliment to the fresh meat and ingredients that makes these hoagies so good.  You can also get Gyro's, Panini's and other Mediterranean style food here, but the best things to get are the hoagies.  My personal favorites are the New Jersey, which is very similar to a Philly Steak and Cheese, except it has better cheese, more onions, a delicious olive oil.  And the Italian, which combines the fresh bread with delicious meats and a great olive oil sauce, to make the perfect hoagie; big, full of meat and cheese (on the Italian they use provolone, my favorite) and delicious.  If you like hoagies then you need to try this place, they have several locations around Charlotte, but my favorite is the shop on Eastway.  Get a half gallon of sweet tea, and you are ready to have the best lunch ever."}
{"text":"Great prices and one of my favorite places to get a gyro. Love the pita and the sauce ratio! Next time I'll have to try the cheesesteak since it looks like there are great reviews for that sandwich."}
{"text":"So far I've had the chicken pita & the gyro. Both are good. My only qualm is that it's never hot. With all the added stuff which is delicious, it cools down the temperature of the meats. Well whatever, I'm still going back. Its more of an observation than a complaint since I like it so much."}
{"text":"The good ole Philly Cheesesteak with peppers & onions is a sure fire bet. This place loads up on meat compared to other sub shops, and the bread is fresh and delicious. The service here was quick and friendly ... I'd defintiely stop back in if I was back in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent food, always fresh. The staff are always friendly and welcoming. The Greek salad may be the best I've ever had. I often get the chicken pita on a hoagie roll and that is also very good. I do not know where they get there bread from but it always perfect. Best pasta salad in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Five stars because cheese steaks here are among the very best anywhere.  Italian hoagies, meatball subs, and salads are all great.  My fave is the Supreme steak, topped with pizza sauce (red gravy), shrooms, grilled onions, and cheese.  Roll is also fresh and tasty.  Delicious!  Just as yummy as a pizza steak from Tony Luke's in South Philly.  I keep returning to the Steak and Hoagie Shop because It's one of the very best lunch spots in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love this place! I grew up on it and recently moved nearby. The guy at the counter is always SO friendly. Their Grecian platter is one of my go-tos when I'm trying to not drown in carbs, it's under $10 and so much food. The black and blue sub is awesome too. This place is always busy with good reason why, but don't fret because they are super speedy at getting people in and out."}
{"text":"Good food, Great service!!!! Steve and the staff make you feel welcome and makes you want to come back!"}
{"text":"Finally!  I hate myself for driving by this place many times and then complaining about how I could never find my go to sub shop in Charlotte.  Seven years later Steak N Hoagie is my spot.  The chicken breast sub is yum.  Warm with mayo and vinegar giving it a bite ...perfect lunch sandwich.  The steak philly is great too.  $15 for two lunches (sandwich chips plus drink) Thanks SNH!"}
{"text":"Ok so old school steak sandwiches and rotisserie chicken spot. Yummy ! And they have those deli style hot and cold sides  must try . Nice staff . Good salads 2 ."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my go to spots for lunch.  Gyros, cheesesteaks, subs, and sides are all really good.  There is usually a good crowd but they take orders and turn out food really quick."}
{"text":"I love this place and have been eating there for as long as I can remember. Just walking in, the smell is divine and it is my favorite mushroom steak from any restaurant."}
{"text":"One word...Nasty. I just recently moved to the university area and I was craving a Philly cheesesteak. I tried this place and I was highly disappointed. Only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because the pasta salad was great. The sandwich however was terrible. Hard bread, barely enough cheese to cover the meat, and the meat was dry and hard. I asked for mayo on the sandwich and I don't even think it was on there. When I got home I added more cheese, and A1 sauce just to make it edible. I won't go back."}
{"text":"When I need a delicious meal quick this is my go to. Steak' N Hoagie has always excellent service and I've love their fresh bread and vegetables."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Charlotte to get a steak and cheese. Everything is fresh. Great customer service. Quick. To top off the delicious, great experience, it's affordable. A must go!"}
{"text":"Great service and the subs are phenomenal haven't tried the other foods they offer only the subs.."}
{"text":"Excellent LARGE subs! Greek owned. TIGHT parking. Rough neighborhood. Divey."}
{"text":"The absolute best sin shop in Charlotte.  Huge subs with lots of meat.  I love the Greek salad with chicken. So filling and great prices.  I wish I could eat here every day. This is always my first choice for food.  My wife loved the steak and cheese.  Daughter loved the gyro."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sandwich shops I've ever been too, the chicken breast sub is probably the best sub I've ever tried. Steve and the rest of his staff always make me feel welcomed and take care of me in a timely manner. This is one of Charlotte's treasures."}
{"text":"Oh my God!! This place is stellar, phenominal! Better than really! Been going here for about ten yrs. Love italian subs and used to alternate between steak & hoagie & jersey mikes. Jersey mikes substantially increased their prices in 2011. Then I started going to Harris Teeter thru 2013 because Steak & hoagie is substantially out of my way. Started back here last year. I don't care if it's 8miles away!!! No sub shop in Charlotte can even touch Steak & hoagie! Got the rottisorrie chicken w/two sides tday 1st time. Omg! The chicken is highly seasoned &!crazy tender(white breast & wing). The sides of potatoes and broccoli & carrots equally delicious!! In conclusion, I will drive 8miles for this food any day of the week! Also very, very reasonably priced. $21&coin for 2 13inch meatball subs and white meat chicken dinner w/2 sides! Ridunkulous!!! Soooooo...good!!!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the Steak and Hoagie / Grekos at Sharon Amity and Monroe until they closed due to road construction 2 years ago. I had seen the one on Eastway but its not the greatest part of town and about 5 miles from my business. Today it popped into my head and myself and 5 coworkers decided to try it. This place is going on the lunch rotation! Rotisserie Chicken - awesome, Greek salad- excellent, roasted potatoes- greasy and delicious. According to coworkers the chicken parm sandwich and cheesesteak were also good as was the Grecian chicken. They didn't have the Teriyaki chicken today but if my memory serves me it was fantastic. The prices are from 1995. 1/4 Chicken 2 sides and garlic bread $5.85. Great food, large portions, very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Had to stop by when i saw philly cheese steak in neon lights from the road. Yes its in a bad part of town but most gems are hole in the walls and this is a great one. I had the original with just cheese onions and meat and it was one of the best ive had in charlotte. The greek potatoes where a great compliment to the meal and for right at 8 dollars for a 13 inch sub your not going to find a better deal."}
{"text":"Best Phillysteaks around town! The service is great and fast. I always get the New Jersey cheesesteak because I love the vinegar flavor to it! The proportions are very filling usually have half my sub when getting it and save the other half for later."}
{"text":"The best philly steak subs out. Prices are great and the food is fabulous. Easy to get to, service is awesome and make sure you get the cherry drink...."}
{"text":"I believe this place is fairly new; or new to me.  I was pleasantly surprised by the selections available.  The prices are reasonable as well.  Grilled chicken strips...what a surprise.  The food was quite tasty.  The meal comes with two sides with a variety of options from which to select.  Service is quick and friendly and you may wait 5 minutes or so for your plate to be ready.  The Steak' N Hoagie Shop is a nice change of pace to the typical fast food establishments.  I look forward to trying other options."}
{"text":"ok, if you're looking for a quick fix from a New York or Philadelphia sandwich shop,  this is a place to hit. they also offer rotisserie chicken meals with healthy veggie sides and they are DELICIOUS!! subs, hot or cold are very good as well so here, is money well spent!"}
