{"text":"Disappointing I tasted chicken thali and the chic curry lacked salt and taste. If you are looking for authentic SriLankan food, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try out this spot, as it recently opened and there's been a big hype surrounding it! Unfortunately, This was the worst kothu roti I've ever had. It tasted old, dry, and stale - and the flavors were just plain missing. To be honest, I won't be coming back here. Would much rather eat at Saffron Spice Kitchen on Queen street!"}
{"text":"Had the string hoppers combo. It didn't look like much (it comes with a side of plain rice noodles with a sort of red colour) but all the dishes were very good; (very) spicy, tangy, satisfying and a unique flavour profile I haven't had before.   Service was quick and super friendly - I think perhaps family run?  Would come back- not sure why reviews are so critical!"}
{"text":"Had a chicken kothu, veggie kothu and mutton rolls here today. It was all really good. I have eaten kothu at many places and this is the real deal. Love that I now have easy access to a good kothu place downtown. I will say I preferred the chicken over the veg kothu - I prefer my veg kothu tossed in soya curry, and this veg kothu is tossed in a sort of potato curry instead. It wasn't bad, just not the kind of veg kothu I prefer. Loved the chicken kothu - chicken was tender, perfect level of spice. Customer service is good - they're really busy so it must be touch. Mutton roll was as good as any I've had in Scarborough. Hopefully they open more chains!"}
{"text":"I had the worst chicken kothu here! Old / spoiled ingredients. Overpriced garbage. The fish cutlet was stuffed with old ingredients as well."}
{"text":"Got a chicken kothu and veg kothu, the wife warned me that they smelled a bit weird but ignored her advise and proceeded to eat them. I should have listened to her and read the reviews first, they food was tasteless and made me a little sick. Avoid"}
{"text":"This place is located in a building with about 2 other food establishments in a kind of a mini food court. This place is the first in line and is accessible, right off King St with no stairs. Its close to King Station and Streetcar stop. King street is closed to cars for at least a year so you can park on the next closest street or parking garage. I ordered the Chicken Kothu Roti and Sweet & Spicey Onion Bun. The Roti wad okay but I should have ordered it mild instead of medium, it was too hot. I had to eat it slowly. The bun was also spicey, so I tasted more spice than sweet. I wouldn't get it next time. The portions are very generous and the server was nice."}
{"text":"Kothu Roti wasn't like what you get in Scarborough. Bland, not enough curry or meat mixed in. Not sure if they are catering to a more genera taste, but the Kothu Roti beside at the Office Pub is even better than this, although the best Kothu Roti downtown right now is probably at The Office Pub at John and Saffron Spice"}
{"text":"Been here few times since opening, initially I found it was decent.  But now all you get is poor customer service and quality! The Asian lady behind the counter is useless. I placed my order on Ritual one Saturday early afternoon got to the place in about 10 min.  She did not start making my order until I got it as she was busy getting get mac on to some older man about her age.   Also, I could not find the chicken in the Kothu Roti... Overpriced Roti than an actual Kothu Roti."}
{"text":"The Mutton Kothu Roti is fantastic. They will cater spice to your tolerance, so you just have to tell them. Service has been good whenever I've been as well."}
