{"text":"Love the food here!  The chicken and broccoli and general tso are my favorites! Good portion sizes!"}
{"text":"Exactly what you want in a Chinese delivery. Big portions, on time and plenty of fortune cookies."}
{"text":"This place is always busy.  It is your typical Chinese fast food.  I get General Tso combo, always consistant and tasty.  Mega helping, you can share....."}
{"text":"Seriously 8 dollars for a side of broccoli,  Red Dragon threw it in for free!  Yay Red Dragon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place for quick Chinese take out.  Service is always fast and good.  I usually get Beef & Broccoli and my husband like the Sesame Chicken and Crab Ragoons.  Portion sizes are huge........always to much for us to finish.  Great flavor of the brown sauce and fried rice.  Not to crazy about the egg rolls but spring rolls are great!  Price and menu is what you would expect from any other take out Chinese joint."}
{"text":"Ate lunch at their Renaissance Drive location today. Food had little flavor--it's like nothing was distinct. Even the vegetables had little flavor. The beef and chicken were both strange: they were both sort of mushy and had none of the typical texture. We had their Subgum Pan Fried Noodles CHEF SPECIAL. The pan fried noodles seemed like they were freeze dried and then reconstituted. 

The people were quite pleasant and the service was good.

It's a take-out place. They don't have normal plates or utensils. It's all Styrofoam plates, plastic bowls, and plastic forks, knives, and spoons.

The food at Thai Emerald (in the Northcross center behind Target) is MUCH BETTER even though it's Thai food. Or you can go to the  House of Taipei chinese restaurant just north of the 77 freeway at exit 25. Both are a little more expensive but well worth it!"}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood Chinese takeout restaurant. They are fast, efficient, always give copious amounts in their portions, fairly priced, and dishes are very consistent in quality.  The fried rice could be given a bit more thought as it too often tastes undercooked."}
{"text":"We have had Chong Chin on three occasions.  The first time was excellent.  The second time was meh.  We ordered the same exact dishes, but I believe we got a different cook.  The third time was excellent again.  Their delivery guy is awesome.  Super friendly.  He always says helloooooooooo! with a big smile.  He is the only delivery guy I've ever had that walked right into my house.  He actually remembered us on the third visit.  We had just closed on our house and moved to a new neighborhood.  He gave me a hug saying congratulations.  The only bad thing about him is that he never has a pen so make sure you do.  LOL"}
{"text":"I really like Chong Chin. The staff is wonderful. The lady who works there is so friendly and always remembers you. The food is consistently good. I get sesame chicken and it's always delicious. Portion sizes are generous. The dinner portion size is enough for 2 meals. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"We love this place!!

they remember me every time I walk in the door!

prices are right in the ballpark and portions are generous!

best for take out - no real atmosphere for eating in......"}
