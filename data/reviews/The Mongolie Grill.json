{"text":"We frequented this place in the early 2000's but got away from it as we moved away from the downtown. Seems everyone stopped going. We went on a Saturday night at 5:30 and was one of two tables there. Should have walked out when we had the chance. The place has the same decor and it's suffering from a need of a make over. The food was fine but you make your own so you can only blame yourself. I will note that the pineapple had no flavour so there is one product they could get fresher. I will note that my food had a funny after taste and I can't place blame as I am not am sure of the cause? The grill? The cook? A sauce that was odd? Don't know. I will say we won't be back.  I would not waste your time either it's not the same place we loved 12 years ago. Head to the great Thai place 2 blocks west on 11th. It's worth the walk over."}
{"text":"The first time I ever went to the Mongolie Grill was on a first date not long after moving to Calgary.  I don't really remember how the date went because all I remember is being wowed by the fact that I could CREATE MY OWN STIRFRY and have somebody ELSE cook it in a restaurant!  How awesome is that?  I love everything about the premise and, in my mind, it will always be the original do-it-yourself stirfry place.  

The reason I knock the rating to 3 is because I think that they really need to step it up.  With other restaurants stepping in and jacking the idea, I believe that MG needs to do 3 things.  1 - get a facelift.  It looks exactly the same as it did 7 years ago - not very cozy, kind of cold, thoughtless decor.  2 - Don't let raw meat & seafood sit out in the main area.  It just doesn't seem tip top clean to me.  3 - I guess this goes with 1, but clean up the cooking area...sometimes walking by looking in, it just looks dirty.  People want to see spic n span where their food is being cooked! 

However, the stirfry is wonderful, portion control is great in this age of supersized everything, and you always know exactly what you're going to get (unless you majorly fudge up the sauce!)

It's trusty like the dog I've never had."}
{"text":"I have wanted to go to this restaurant since 2003 and finally went on the weekend. I was not disappointed. 

I like the large selection of vegetables, noodles, meat, spices and sauces. You can make your dish as savoury or sweet as you want. Mongolie Grill caters to both the experimental food critic and the picky eater. I like to try new things and I was pleased at the selection of seafood and vegetables.

You can put on as much or as little as you want. So you're not paying for a big helping if you're not extra hungry.

It is a casual environment so no one is eyeing up your outfit or purse. I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I like this place alot, because you get exactly what you want. There's no stupid gimmicks and the food is always tasty.  We usually go on a weeknight. Theres parking directly behind the building and on the street, so there is ample parking on weeknights.  You get  rice and rice paper plus a choice of a soup with your meal. The great thing is you can eat as little of as much as you want. Usually for Lunch my wife and I are under $20 if we eat light. Our record is $48 not including tip for dinner. So it's reasonable for what you get. Most dinners out for us always run $60 plus."}
{"text":"I live 4 blocks from here and have never been. Boyfriend and his GM go all the time and they love it. 

After a day of shopping around and getting halloween stuff and pumpkins to carve, we were trying to decide on dinner. Although both of us are cooks, we rarely cook at home because our kitchen sucks. We didnt want pizza or chinese or anything fast food-ish. Knowing I had never been he suggested we go to Mongolie Grill. 

There was about 4 people in the restaurant. Our server was quick to grab the drink orders and soup orders. Boyfriend got 2 bowls of the hot and sour soup and I got the corn chowder. Both really good soups.

So we went to get our mains, and he explained what to do. I got snap peas, baby corn, mushrooms, white onions, beef, shrimp, shanghai noodles, minced garlic and honey garlic sauce. He got an array of things and I didn't keep track of what he got. 

Boyfriend explained to me that they deliberately cut the veggies and meat portions bigger so that they weigh more and therefor you pay more. 

It was interesting watching the guy make all the food, I was slightly worried that boyfriends stuff would get mixed with mine, but it didn't and it it was good, and arrived hot and was so fresh. 

I loved that I could pick my own ingredients and not something off a menu. 

Now that boyfriend knows I like this place, we'll be visiting it a lot more."}
{"text":"The Mongolie Grill is officially one of my favourite restaurants in Calgary. Imagine my disappointment when I went to the one in Dalhousie Station only to learn it's been shut down. But hey, at least there's still this one!!!

So I have an inside trick for you all. The BEST sauce in the world can be made at Mongolie by adding one scoop of honey garlic sauce, one scoop of chopped ginger, one scoop of chopped garlic, and two scoop of the spicy Thai sauce. Just add all this on top of your fully-topped bowl and i guarantee the taste will be PERFECT!!!

Personally, I like to wrap the contents of my bowl with the rice paper sheets. They become perfect little roll creatures that please my body to the core.

What I like best about Mongolie is that their food is healthy. It's unheard of to go to a restaurant anymore and know EXACTLY what is on your plate, but at The Mongolie Grill, you most definitely know because anything that's on your plate, you put it there yourself!!!"}
{"text":"$$$$$$$ very $

Food is fine, but v expensive. Not worth the groupon or living social coupons. A spoonful of food cost $10, so easily cost $20 to $30 per person. STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"Good as usual. Once again,  I was the high cost for the group,  but it is worth every penny. 

Service was great and very attentive.   Bravo Mongolia Grill"}
{"text":"Not much has changed here. Still too expensive for what you get. Plus for the price I would expect a nicer atmosphere and staff"}
{"text":"The place is empty during the lunch rush and that tells part of the story.

OK I am not a fan of building your stirfry and paying $16 so somebody can flip it in a big wok.  I mean it can seem like fun but I rather trust professionals to mix the right amount of water chestnuts, peanuts and black bean sauce.  My dish was severely underwhelming (lack of sauce I think) but I should fire myself. 

Alright getting past the fact that the idea is it can seem excitting to build your own lunch it is expensive.  You pay by the weight and noodles and beef are the same price, same as adding sauce or vegetables.  what this means is that it can add up to $15-20 for a plate.

You know what take your money, run to chinatown and I can promise that just about every place will give you a much better meal for less than $12.

PS the decor and ambiance of this place is severely dull. Inside it looks like Bob's pub, dark, same low tables / bar, and no cultural reference to the style of food they are presenting."}
{"text":"The service was pleasant, food quality was good and there was a very good selection of meats, vegetables and sauces to choose from. You fill out your bowl and pay by weight. We went during lunch hour on a weekday, but it was pleasantly not too crowded. 
Going back again."}
