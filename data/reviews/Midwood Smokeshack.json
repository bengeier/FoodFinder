{"text":"Lunch for two was a little pricey, we had pork sandwich with fries and a chopped brisket sandwich with mac & cheese which came to $26, They did let us try the bacon wrapped jalapeño which was spicy but really good. The brisket was good, but  was a little dry, and the same for the mac & cheese. The pork sandwich he said was very good and it must have been it was totally gone."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this small version of the full service restaurant in either Ballentyne or Plaza Midwood.  Special burnt ends were very tasty.  Get there early for prompt service, if not it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"There were a number of flies in the restaurant with some landing in the food. The bbq pork was too spicy. The chicken was chopped like the pork. I had hoped the chicken was whole and small portions could be ordered. Only half whole was available. The flies may keep us away."}
{"text":"Without fail, brings a smile to my face with every first bite on every visit.   I've said for years this place had the best bbq in Charlotte, although my visits were rare due to the location.  I thought I was living a dream when they opened a mile from my house.  Now I try to limit myself to once a week.
The smoke is something you just don't get this consistently anywhere else.
Almost every time, I think to myself they must have screwed up the portion size.  I'm a big fella, and I always leave stuffed.
A lot of reviews say it's pricey.  For the quality, size and most importantly, the knowledge they put into smoking meat, it's a bargain in my eyes.
The crew is to notch as well.  The guys are very approachable and accommodating.  While it is a walk up and order kind of place, they are always checking on you and typically bus your trays.  Great management and training all around.
5 stars on every metric I can think of.
You may run into an oddball issue here or there, but if you don't like this meat, then you don't like real bbq. This is exactly what it's supposed to taste like."}
{"text":"Awesome brisket and some of the best wings I've ever had in the US. Wings are smoked but get there early - they might run out!  Service is super friendly!  So glad they're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I've gotten to go orders here twice now. Since they just opened there was some confusion but the training staff stepped in quickly. The food was excellent although a cuban sandwich should have sliced pork and not chopped but it was tasty none the less. The fries I had with the sandwich were limp and soggy. Hopefully that will get better. I also had a chopped pork dinner with bbq beans and slaw tge day before which was very good. My son had a brisket sandwich with mac and cheese and he said it was excellent.

As has been already posted, you order \"cafeteria style\"  and then take a seat with no wait staff.

Personally considering you pretty much serve yourself i think the prices are a bit high but thats just my opinion. The location is good but there is stiff competition in the area but Im sure they'll be succesfull."}
{"text":"Super! Service was immediate. First time here and the server explained everything clearly. Had the lunch special Burnt Ends. It was excellent with their Mac & Cheese side. The biscuits are amazing! I definitely will return. Great place to eat and hang out! I also met Paul, the owner. A really nice guy. He told me that they smoke their meats with 100% hickory, no gas. The taste is truly amazing. Come support this new business."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!! I will probably be selling my smoker tomorrow. Tried a little bit of everything and there wasn't a bad meal to be had. For sure our new go to place!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch there and enjoyed the pork bbq plate.  It is pretty close to eastern nc bbq which is my favorite. A little on the pricey side probably because of the rent, but worth a visit."}
{"text":"Man, I really wanted to like this place! I've lived around here for three years and they are the third restaurant to occupy that space, so I wanted to see them succeed. But having eaten there today, I won't be returning. Pulled pork was meh, ribs meh, bbq beans meh, mac 'n' cheese awful (dried out and flavorless), beer selection terrible. Go right across the street to Queen City Q. Way better."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Midwood Smokehouse! Absolutely great food - and might I say the portion was beyond what I could hold. We will certainly be back. The customer service was 5 star!"}
{"text":"Brought my wife the other day and tried the brisket sandwich.  The staff was helpful and patient with my wife as she usually asks a lot of questions.  Abilene is still my favorite."}
{"text":"I visited the original Midwood on Central and both times I gave it a crappy review. 
Recently this location was opened near me and I thought I would give it a shot. 
This time I tried the pulled pork and she had ribs.(Other times I had brisket)
The portions were a good size, a bit pricey, but expected in this area, 
The pork was cooked well and had nice texture and was fairly moist, but did lack smoke flavor. Overall not bad. The sides...beans were good, had some meat in them with onions and a nice flavor. The mac and cheese was ok, but not great. Kinda lacking flavor, but still edible. The ribs were good, not great, but a nice portion for a half rack. 
The service, not table side, was confused. I guess they are still learning. The people behind the counter seemed not sure what to do and were kinda falling over themselves. They ran out of mac and cheese and we had to wait til it came out of the oven. 
Overall, better that previous experiences. I really wish yelp allowed 1/2 stars cause they were a little better than 3, but I'll go a four since they are new as a benefit of the doubt on the service."}
{"text":"I'm always excited to try a new bbq place in town, but I was very disappointed. I was hesitant to write a critical review because this is a new location, but I decided to for 2 reasons. One, this is only a new location, not a new restaurant. The restaurant is established. Second, the critique is not on service. Service at a new location may deserve some grace to work out kinks with new staff, but my critique comes down to a management decision. I ordered wings and they were the smallest wings I've ever been served at a restaurant. In fact, I've never bought grocery store frozen boxed wings that were smaller. So management made an intentional decision to serve these wings. It was a mistake. If these wings were all the restaurant's vendor had to offer, the better decision would have been to decline and wait on bigger ones and not sell any wings at all. Maybe offer a free side or soda to compensate customers who wanted wings with a promise that wings would be available the next day. This would be better than to risk creating a poor first impression on new customers. I can judge you on what you did serve, not what you didn't serve. Wings are a popular item at bbq restaurants, so more care should be given to what is served. Also my son and my brother in law and sister in law got bbq pork and it wasn't good enough to be distinctive over the other local bbq joints. A much better option is just across the street."}
{"text":"Midwood Smokeshack is a fast casual version of Midwood Smokehouse.  They seemed to have the same menu items at the same price.  You just order at the counter, and they prepare your dish right in front of you from the assembly line of items.  To us (and other customers in line), it seemed like all of the 6-7 employees behind the counter were new.  Nobody, or very few of them, seemed to know what they were doing.  It took longer than it should have to get through the line, and then there was confusion behind the counter about what containers to use, sauces to add, etc.  The woman ahead of us had a to-go order and she was getting frustrated that they were taking so long to bag and ring up her order.  I know they haven't been open that long, but I think it's been at least a few weeks, and it felt like opening day.  

The portions of food were generous, and everything tasted almost as good as when the server delivers the fresh food to you at Midwood Smokehouse.  My only disappointment with the food itself was that the bacon wrapped jalapenos were a little too crispy, like they had been sitting out under the heat lamp for too long.  But the mac & cheese was fresh and creamy out of the oven, and the smoked meat (despite sitting on a plate for awhile while everyone tried to figure out what they were doing) stayed warm and tasted delicious.  

I was surprised that they didn't have BBQ sauces out at the condiment bar.  Even the Midwood Smokehouse on Central Ave has started offering squeeze bottles of their sauces at the tables.  We each got a tiny half-filled ramekin of a sauce of their choosing with our dinners.  Like I said before, they give you a large portion of meat and, unfortunately, just a tiny bit of sauce.  I had to go up to the counter to ask for more.  Again, it seemed like there was confusion behind the counter.  

Anyway, the food was delicious, and it could be a five-star experience in the future if they offer sauces to their customers and get their act together a little better."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!! I always get the Well Fed where you choose four proteins and two sides. The Brisket is to die for, and the ribs are fantastic!! The collard greens are my favorite side but the mac and cheese is awesome too!! Come hungry and leave full and happy!!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Took my mom after a doc appt. I mention that because, we wouldn't have seen it, otherwise. It's off the road in a busy little strip of grocery and other restaurants near the YMCA. 
 It's super casual and friendly with a nice variety of entrees ( first time ever, that I saw a [delicious] Cuban sandwich on a BBQ menu:-) and sandwiches that you order at the counter before you seat yourself. 
  We got 4 meals and two drinks and cookies for under $50.00 and will surely return. 
 It's also relatively new and not that busy on weekdays, so, go now!"}
{"text":"I love brisket, was in the shopping center and gave this place a try...
Highly disappointed, since all the reviews were great and I have tried their location on Plaza Midwood.
Went for the Pitmaster Brisket Sandwich, asked the kid helping me, to do it Half lean and Half Fatty. Asked for fries and then saw the corn muffins while waiting to pay for my order, and decided, hey why no...
It took a little too long to place and get the order, no idea why, it was only 5 patrons  in the restaurant including me.
When I sat to get my food...they forgot the pickles on my sandwich, and when I had the first bite, it was barely warm.
Try the muffins, were overlooked and salty, and for the love of God greasy...and the fries... salty too.
It probably that I was simply very unlucky tonight, but I will be driving either to Ballantyne or Plaza next time I am craving MidWood.
BTW, where was the manager checking on people's food?"}
{"text":"Went there last Saturday night. Tried the two meat combo, brisket and ribs. The ribs are not baby back, traditional on the bone type of bite. Not falling off. I actually prefer them to want to pull the meat from the bone on ribs. St. Louis style.  
The brisket was better. And I like the fatty/moist burnt end. They were accommodating. Amount of meat was a little small. Sides were generous. Cornbread a tad greasy. But overall good value and good food. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This new location of the Midwood Smokehouse just opened 2 days ago. It is in a great location with plenty of free parking. It is more casual than others. You walk in and order at counter area where food is located. There is no wait staff. There are draft beers on tap as well as bottled beers. I didn't think the draft choices offered much variety.  Soda dispenser is self serve. The menu seems much like other locations. There were a few blips as new staff gets accustomed to new restaurant. I think the bbq pork needs a little more tweaking to reach the excellence of the Central Ave location. Also the bowls for chopped salads are too small. It's impossible to eat without pieces slipping over the sides. The seating us spacious with.options outdoors also. I certainly hope this location is successful."}
{"text":"Two visit review... first time moist smokey brisket was perfect, excellent flavorful collard greens and creamy mac and cheese. Ribs were fair either overcooked or kept in warmer too long. Second visit ribs were the same and burnt ends were unfortunately sawdust dry. Collards were undercooked but had good seasoning. Id return for the brisket alone but I hope they can improve the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this new location and concept in Matthews. I really like the more fast casual approach. The pricing is around what you would pay at the other local BBQ restaurants with a server. The BBQ is some of the best in Charlotte and they have an excellent beer selection.

I had the pulled pork plate which includes two sides. The pork had a ton of flavor and you have the option of 4 or 5 different sauces. I had the collard greens which were excellent and the baked beans which were nice and rich. They were letting people sample the cornbread which was super moist and flavorful. They also let us try the bacon wrapped jalapeños which were nice and spicy. They also had several taps for craft beer and a good bottle selection. Hopefully they will have some beer specials like Queen City Q across the street."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ places around. If you are looking for a place to eat where you won't be hungry an hour later, well look no further. Today I decided to try the Cuban sandwich and let me say this is one of the best I have had in the US.  Anytime I want to have leftovers for about 3 days I will get the combo platters. Great place to eat!!!"}
{"text":"Smoked chicken is fantastic. Big fan of the pulled pork, the bacon wrapped jalapeños, and best of all, the sweet jalapeño corn muffins. Those muffins alone warranted this 5 star review. Collard greens are a must have. Like the other Midwood locations (or any bbq place in NC for that matter) you can skip the brisket. Their Cuban sandwich is really good too!"}
{"text":"First time here and I'm pleased with the service and meal. I got the brisket sandwich, jalapeño wrapped with bacon and Cole slaw (mayonnaise based-they have vinegar too):

Large amount brisket. The roll was fresh.

Got welcomed by \"welcome to the shack \" Clean tables and surface.

Some tv's to check out sports.   

I'll be back and would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Daily special was an art masterpiece of brisket avocado pick de gallo and smoked onion on an onion bin. Melted in my mouth. And the beans YUM with burnt ends!"}
{"text":"I start this review saying we're familiar with the other locations of Midwood, and always enjoy them. So I'm comparing them against themselves... we love the fast casual (no waitress extra cost), however the pulled pork was just not nearly as good as the original or Ballentyne location. Not that's it's not good, it just is when you are used to the higher bar they set for themselves this isn't quite it. The sides are great, mac and cheese very good.. if you are sensitive to spice I would say the collards are quite spicy and I didn't like that there was no option of a non spicy BBQ sauce, lime maybe a BBQ mustard or something along those lines. Overall, if I want BBQ I'd go to their other location."}
{"text":"My wife and I grabbed lunch here yesterday. We were really impressed by the sandwiches and the sauces that came with them. We had the prime beef brisket that came on a brioche type bun that tasted like Texas toast. The greens that we had as a side were excellent as well. This is definitely on our revisit list and probably will become a standby. Can't wait to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Mmm mmm mmm!  I'm hooked!  For someone like me who claims to not be a lover of BBQ this place makes me say I LOVE BBQ!  One word you need to know when you come to this place: BRISKET!  It is deliciously smoked to perfection.  
I first visited Midwood a few weeks back on my son's birthday.  This is probably the busiest time for me work wise so I needed a tasty dinner for the family to take home that would be somewhat memorable.  Midwood fit the bill!  I was greeted by everyone behind the counter with reassurance I had chosen the right place.  Welcoming smiles across the board.  I opted for the \"well Fed\" meal which gives you 4 portions of meats and two sides.  I added a point of chicken as well.  While the chicken which was tossed in a mustard base sauce was tasty I won't mess around again and will go straight for the brisket.  My kids called it 'bacon like meat'. Probably not the most appetizing description but the taste was out of this world!
The collards are tasty with a nice kick and the beans are insanely good!!  Did I mention how good the brisket is?!  I mean it doesn't even need sauce good!

Way to make me a BBQ believer!"}
{"text":"Best brisket ever!
Loved all the sides (except Green Beans) Texas Combo was De-Lish!
I wish they would let you mix the sauces when you take them to go (half one, half another), we asked for that & they acted like they had no clue what we were asking. And Instead, gave us four very large cups of two different sauces when we would have like to try them all or mixed two so we didn't have so much to take with us. now we have a ton of sauce that we'll never use. Oh Well.
Just don't like to be wasteful.."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I recently tried it since it is new and got the Abilene Press (smoked brisket, gouda and bbq remoulade) with mac and cheese for the side. Both were tasty and the customer service is really good too. I get this order every time I go, but I still want to try more of the sandwiches, salads and baked beans!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently moved down here and my best friend was visiting from Massachusetts.  We had not tried Midwood yet but meant to, and thought this was the right time.  

When we came in, the smell of delicious BBQ is present immediately.  It was wonderful.  They were a little backed up as they were filling a large to-go order.  No big deal.  The guy at the \"order here\" section asked if we wanted a sample of brisket while we waited.  My friend and I are big BBQ fans and would not foolishly turn down such a nice offer.  After trying the sample, I immediately changed my mind about what I would order.  I got a \"two meat combo\" of Carolina pulled pork and lean brisket with BBQ beans and mac and cheese for my sides.  I've had BBQ all over the country and Midwood hangs with the best of them. The brisket was the best I've ever had.  It was moist and flavorful and not fatty like other examples I've had.  The red BBQ sauce was epic and I put that on everything.  My wife had the chicken with cornbread and mac and cheese and my friend had Carolina pork and chicken with the mac and BBQ beans.  We all ate incredibly well.  This will be a regular haunt for my wife and me, and now I'm trying to convince my friend and his wife to move down to North Carolina too!"}
{"text":"The BBQ is \"ok\", but I wasn't overly impressed. The fries were cold, limp, and tasted like they had sat in grease for hours. They were disgusting. At 5:30 they were out of the majority of their sides & we were told they had no intentions of carrying hush puppies at this location, which I consider a southern BBQ establishment fail.  Overall we were extremely disappointed, as we had hoped Midwood would be better than Queen City Q across the street."}
{"text":"Dude! This Cuban sandwich I just ordered to Togo and is AMAZING! I walk in after getting a hair cut next door and as soon as I got home and had a bite I had to call this guys with my food in my mouth and tell them that it was the most amazing thing I have ever tasted! Well done job! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here when they first opened and it was awesome. Last Friday ordered takeout online. Shortly after I ordered I received an email stating order received and would get another with pickup time. I did, stating ready at 2:25. I was about 10 minutes late and arrived as the only couple was leaving. The two young men were friendly and polite and I was offered a free soft drink for my wait since order wasn't ready... after 10 or so minutes my order was ready. My son got smoked chicken, which was dry, husband got pulled pork, which was too vingery, other son got BBQ chicken and had no comment, but barely ate half. I got a sandwich that was so sloppily put together I did not eat. I won't be back.

*I updated the stars due to excellent customer service- they reached out to me right away. Thank you, Leslie!"}
{"text":"Update: I'm SO bummed this location closed!!

If you need a good, quick bite and BBQ is what you're craving, this is the spot! Great for families, it's very relaxed and you order your food at the register. Haven't been disappointed with anything I've tried! The pulled pork is really good! Also a great spot for a good to-go order when you're in a rush!"}
{"text":"Service was fast and effective. Not a huge menu but what you'd expect at a rib and BBQ place. You order when you walk in and the order is filled by the time you get to the register.

We split a rack of ribs. These are St. Louis dry rub style. Excellent! We had coleslaw, mac & cheese and fries. The fries were a bit salty fir our tastes. The other sides were great. 
They have 6 or so beers on tap. Soft drinks and ice tea. 
Place was clean with decent music to match the ambience. 
We will return"}
{"text":"We just had lunch here and let me say this place was top notch! We got the\"well fed\" and got double brisket, pulled pork, and pulled chicken with coleslaw, baked beans, and French fries. Everything was juicy, flavorful and smoked to perfection. We got Mac and cheese for our son and tried it of course, and it was amazing! The only thing we regret is living in Florida because we don't have one! Friendly staff and decent priced for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"I am so excited to have this BBQ spot right near my home! The customer service here was amazing. The only note I have is to keep fresher foods at the hot plate."}
