{"text":"Love the decor and ambience, and the scallops and bacon app was delicious, but the cocktails were watered down heavily with melted chipped ice and large ice cubes (even when I asked for very little ice in my manhattan). Next time, I'm ordering at the bar to watch them pour the two ounces. My wife's rye and ginger was served with flat ginger ale. C'mon guys, what's up with that?"}
{"text":"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much but I was surprised how perfectly my steak (rib eye) was cooked and how tender and not overly seasoned.  Place was packed and had to sit by the bar, but the chatty waitresses made up for any inconvenience. ..if any. Comparable to 40 ouest without the price tag and fake people."}
{"text":"I must say I was quite disappointed with the fact that the restaurant does NOT take reservations for dinner after 6pm on weekdays/weekends.So your reservations are only valid if you dine between 5-6pm.  So I took the chance to go without a reservation, and the end result was a 45 minute wait(Standing!)Keep in mind this was only for a table of two people. The hostess was not very helpful. Why this location is NOT open for lunch on weekdays, is quite surprising while the others such as The Keg downtown Montreal does provide lunch!  I'm not impressed with restaurant that has this good of a reputation(In other locations!) My suggestion, if you don't mind the extra drive, you're better off going to the one situated in downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"Great food, Louis was a great bartender. Great cocktails like the house made Drunken Cherry and great beer, Kissmeyer Nordic Pale Ale was available when I visited.  Louis is a great bartender and even threw in a taste of some dessert!  This was definitely one of the highlights of my work visit to the Montreal area!  I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I took my cousin for dinner to thank her for helping me with my service to seniors in the area of housing. I wanted our dinner to be fabulous and it was! The staff were professional and attentive. Our food was excellent, starting with our salads and ending with a lovely mini cream brûler!"}
{"text":"Third visit.  We had the best waiter, sorry I cannot remember his name. My scallop appetizer was very good, my husband's Caesar salad was disappointing and he hardly touched it.   Mains:  filet mignon pretty good, fries very good.  Prime rib:  tasteless, as was asparagus accompanying it.   Won't go back, not worth it."}
{"text":"You can't really go wrong with The Keg. It's never an earth shattering culinary experience but if you are in the mood for steak it does the job fairly well. Noise level in this restaurant is very high and it has always been crowded on all my (3) visits so far. The upstairs terrace is nice in the summertime. Inside is rather dimly lit and noisy. Food is good, wine is fairly priced but could use a revamped wine list with more choice."}
{"text":"I love the Keg!! Ate a lot! Escargot pretty good, preferred it in the shell though, but with the garlic cheese toast, a perfect pairing. Onion soup and surf and turf, just what I expected. But the billy miner pie exceeded my expectations! I'll return on my next trip to Montreal!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my bestie on a Friday night, and had a great time. My friend had arrived before me, but didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated (Friday at 6:15). Our waitress was just the sweetest. It had been a long week, so I was deserving of a large glass of white wine (haha), and she recommended a great choice. My friend had their ahi tuna, and I decided to try the lobster and shrimp salad. It. was. delicious. Probably one of the best salads I have ever had! The shrimp and lobster were super fresh, the dressing was delicious, and the salad had all of my favourite foods - avocado, beans, and mushrooms. Yummy!! The ambiance was great, one of those nicer restaurants you can bring your kids to without feeling out of place. Sometimes restaurants hand you the bill with the underlying reason that \"it's time for you to go\", but our waitress told us to enjoy and take our time, which was nice not to feel rushed. That being said. I shall be back...for that salad! ;)"}
{"text":"Totally recommend going here for a great night out. I have been there multiple times and have always had great service and great food. Is perfect for a romantic night out or even a fun night out with a group of friends. Prices aren't too high and you definitely get what you pay for, love it."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, service and atmosphere. If you want steak, this is the place to eat it. Well worth it!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing as always and the drinks were perfect! Only thing I have to complain about is that I waiting 5-10 mins at the bar to get another drink! I have came just to drink ya the bar before and never had any issues, not sure If it was new staff or something but very weird!"}
{"text":"Went here for our second time this last New Years Eve to get the evening started. A note, on busy nights they fill up fast, so if you are a group I would advise calling in a reservation. Luckily for my fiancé and I, we came early enough that we were immediately seated without a reservation! The service was great and the waitress knew the menu well and gave great recommendations. We had a great dinner with some wine and champagne before heading out fully satiated and ready for some more champagne chez nous. I've been to many of this chains' locations in Montreal, Toronto and Whistler and I have never left disappointed!"}
{"text":"Looking for a nice steakhouse-style dinner my wife and I were on the lookout for a great place to go.  Where did we find the answer, well none other than Yelp of course.  Located close by and what appeared to be a very nice environment we settled on The Keg.    When walking up to the restaurant, which is attached to a mall, we were not expecting too much on the inside.  However, when you enter you are immediately reminded that you are dinning at a steakhouse. With tall ceilings and dark lighting, the mood was set for a relaxing and intimate dinner.  The décor was modern without being overdone.  The restaurant felt cozy and inviting while have a small touch of masculinity.   We sat down at our table and our server promptly came by and got our drink order.  My wife got the white sangria and I a local hefeweizen. Both of which were remarkable and tasty.  Not being hungry enough we just got meals.  While waiting for our food we received complimentary bread.  It was good but noting to write home about.  When my chicken came to the table it made my mouth water and I was eager to eat it.  The chicken itself was cook perfectly with a crispy skin and a juicy and succulent center.  Served over a bead of asiago rice with a sweet chili sauce over the top.  The flavors overall were great, a nice play between textures and the sweet and spicy.  Overall, a very good dish and something I would recommend to anyone who is looking for something a little lighter but not lacking any flavor.   The major drawback to our experience overall was the service.  Other that being prompt when we first got there our server kind of fell off. She was never rude or impolite, however, while waiting for another drink and the food we noticed her just standing and chatting.  Overall experience was good, just a few minor things that could be cleaned up and honed in on."}
{"text":"Surprised they don't take reservations. Food was good but you must be a steak lover to fully enjoy the experience. I am not big on steak but figured I should still have that since it's what they are most famous for. It was quite nice my manhattan ny cut.   Will not be going back as I am not a true beef fan and being that prices are on the higher end.:."}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant. 1st time in Canada for me and this was a good 1st impression! From the front desk to the food was A+! I had steak and potatoes, my fiancée had ribs, fries and cole slaw. We both enjoyed our meal! Can't wait to comeback when it's hot in their summer! Lol"}
{"text":"Over the years of going to the keg, I've never had a steak not cooked to perfection. They also give reassurance if you've indicated any allergy to the waiter, 2 min later someone else comes to ensure that they're prepping the kitchen to account for this allergy. It's very comforting for those who're worried about this."}
{"text":"we went a night or two after they opened.  the interior is very neat, it should have been since it cost almost 9m to make the space.  I love the bar staff very friendly and beautiful.    i ordered let the server order me a steak and it was perfect (the rib).  the rest of the party steaks were not cooked to their liking but still enjoyed them.  you must try the ice cream cake... AMAZING"}
{"text":"My first time here could not have went better.  But here I am, my second time around at the Keg. I must say that it was on a saturday night at 6pm. We were 5 people waiting for a table in the dining room.  They told us it would take about 90 min. Nothing wrong with that, don't mind waiting for a table while drinking at their beautiful bar. But the people I was with accepted a table at the bar instead, being that the wait would be 10 min. instead of 90...  Things were looking up when they offered us a table in the dining room because someone else preferred to be in the bar to watch the game,  even better!  But after 45 min of waiting and all these promises,  here comes the same guy telling us now that it was all a mistake on his part, that we couldn't be seated in the dining room area!? So the table we initially had accepted at the bar was gone and so as the other one in the dining room!   So he offers us a round of drinks and appetizers.  And promises us the next bar table available.   What a fiasco!  Fridays and Saturdays are quite complicated days to get a table here. I think you need to reserve before 6pm, otherwise, good luck!  The booth tables at the back of the bar are not meant to have a full dinner on, way too small, very akward and annoying for everyone.  Can't fit much on there, especially if we all have drinks and water (which apparently you need to ask for, the days of bringing water all around seem to be gone, here)  Not a good experience,  especially when you end up paying over $400 to get under cooked vegetables,  watered-down drinks, tough fillet mignon,  and a seating fiasco to boot!  Pretty but not well orchestrated."}
{"text":"I just went to the Keg on friday, I was given a gift card from work so i decided to go spend it. Everything from the service to the food was great, especially that it was extremely busy. When i came to pay with my gift card, i am told the balance is at 0$. The card was not properly activated from the website it was purchased from. It was quite upsetting to hear this. However the wonderful manager there, Alicia was super nice and understanding. She took the card anyway and said she'd deal with it on her own. Because of this i am changing my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars. Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The steak is tender and juicy. We had a good time here. I recommend the rib steak the most. Since my aunt doesn't eat rare steak, we ordered medium cooked rib steak under the recommendations. It seems that this cut will allow the steak to be cooked more without being tough inside. Overall, it was a great experience and I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Short and to the point... The Keg serves up delicious food, all at a reasonable price considering the portion sizes. Add amazing service and this place is definitely a go-to. You can chose between the louder, more business-casual bar area or the regular dining area for a quieter evening. There is also an upstairs, which I think is for larger groups. There is something for everyone!  Quick story... I ordered the rib steak, medium rare. It came more towards medium. The waiter noticed, without even being prompted and offered to replace it. The steak was still excellent, so I declined the offer. Instead, to our surprise, the waiter brought us a huge piece of mocha ice cream cake for dessert, as an apology for the inconvenience. That is a defining feature of a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Great ambiance on the terrace with a fireplace. Didnt enjoy my overall experience with the waitress wasnt engaging or friendly enough didnt make the evening special . My filet mignon was cooked the way I askwd but laking flavor.. Usually I polish my filet mignon but not this one. Not impressed.. Lacking flavor with their vegetables and sauces.. At least there was wine to put it all down. Washrooms are downstairs which is not convenient when on the second floor but you can take the elevator to go faster lol."}
{"text":"A friend brought me the the Keg a few days ago and I think it was an okay restaurant. The decor (and the waiter!) were super nice-looking. Very spacious and a good ambiance. It was pretty busy, we waited maybe 20 minutes at 6pm on a Thursday to be seated.   I found the service to be excellent, the appetizers very good, but the main meals were so-so. They serve warm, delicious bread, which was great. The apps we ordered were also very good, and served with another type of bread, which was amazing! The apps were garlic butter shrimp (cooked perfectly) with cheese and mushrooms stuffed with crab (this was probably the highlight of the night!)   For our main meals, neither of us ordered steak, so maybe it would have been better if we had. We ordered two dishes which we shared. The first dish was seared sesame tuna. It was served cold over a coleslaw with a sesame dressing. The tuna itself was very good! The salad was not very substantial. I don't think that the dish would have been filling enough had we not ordered appetizers.   The other dish we had was like a chicken 'surf and turf.' It was chicken served with shrimp, scallops, and crab, over mashed potatoes, and asparagus. The mashed potatoes and asparagus were very good, but the chicken was really nothing special; rather bland actually. The shrimp seemed over cooked, surprising, because the appetizer shrimp were perfect. The crab was okay. I didn't try the scallops, so I can't comment.   Overall, I would return for drinks and appetizers, maybe to check out the bar or summer terrasse, but I think I would go elsewhere for meals. I may come back and try a steak, though, considering it is a steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and ambiance ! Enjoy the rooftop in the summer but try to reserve in advance during those months!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly staff,  can be jammed on the weekends. Food is good but the draft beer isn't great the 3 times I've been there I've had to switch to bottle beer. I would go back as its a cool place. But I've just been handed the bill after finishing my food without asking. Strange thing is I wanted to have a few beers, not now !! Off to the olde orchard I think !!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times always good as is the service. No surprises - if you want a good steak cooked and seasoned properly, this is the place to get it."}
{"text":"Première visite à ce steak house dans l'ouest de Montreal pour un souper d'affaire avec des clients.   Je suis arrivé plus tôt que les autres et j'ai décidé aller prendre un verre au bar en attendant. A mon arrivée à la réception il devait avoir au moins 10 jeunes filles habilles en robes noires qui parlaient tellement fort que j'avais peine à entendre ce que me disait l'hôtesse au sujet de ma réservation. Très mauvais première impression et j'espérais qu'elles étaient tous sur le point de se trouver quelque chose a faire avant l'arrivée de mes clients. Les jeunes serveuses jouaient avec une petite fille de 3-4 ans.  Au bar j'ai du attendre plusieurs minutes avant que quelqu' un ne vienne me servir puisque la préposée au bar elle aussi jouait en avant avec la petite. Il ne semblait pas avoir personne en charge pour voir à ce chaos a l'entrée. La bar est très sombre mais quand même un beau décord moderne tout neuf. Ensuite a la table nous avons eu un service un service exceptionnel de la part de Phanny qui a sauvé la soirée. Les deux entrées de crevettes et calamars étaient excellentes. Pour ce qui est des viandes mes invités et moi même avons été très satisfait. Le filet mignon et les coupes NY ont été grillés tels que demandes. Une excellente carte de vins est disponible. Pour ma part je trouves les prix trop élevés mais au moins contrairement à d'autres endroits, nous n'avions pas a commander nos garnitures a part a prix ridicules. Le stationnement est facile."}
{"text":"The Keg steakhouse location on the west island is really nice and upscale. The staff are very well organized in handling the customers as they arrive. We had a reservation for 5:30 and were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. We were not impressed when they told us we had be out by 9pm. We understand but do not push us before we even get seated. Not a good start. We started out with house fresh mixes salads. Well when you find the core of the head of lettuce that is brown and cut into your salad sure displays poor quality control and was turn off. The server did take the brown core pieces away. A few minutes later the manager did show up at our table . He was apologetic  but then he start making excuses. The steaks arrived which mine was suppose to be medium but was partially on a rare side and was not hot but warm. But the bake potato was cold . At this point our server was no where to be found . A few minutes into our meal the manager did come by to see if everything was ok. I did ask him to  touch my potato to see first hand that the potato was cold . He was hesitant at first but when he did touch it he immediately agreed and stated that this was unacceptable . He said he would get me a hot potato. When he did return he stated that he was not happy with our experience and was taking it off the bill. That was the right way to handle the matter . That being said the kitchen staff and chef should understand when someone is spending a lot of money for a steak and salad they do expect everything to be perfect and not sloppy. We will give this location another try and we will update the review . Tonight The Keg was a miss !"}
{"text":"TLDR: Fun place for a 5 a 7 and for parties in the West end.  Great 5 a 7 deals of well-made cocktails and food. You can't go wrong with the cocktails. I've tried the dark and stormy, tequila cinnamon, bloody mary, and much more and they were all well balanced. If you prefer virgin drinks, their Virgin Mary has quite the kick to it. Their wine and beer lists are also nice.   Let's discuss the food: Their nachos are vibrant in colour and flavour, and I recommend topping them with chicken. The fried calamari comes with fried red bell peppers and fried slices of jalapeno for some extra flavour. Their house salad is great for people who are peckish but would rather drink their calories than eat them.  Service is efficient, even when involving large groups.  If you're looking for a more sophisticated place to hold your gathering in the west end, instead of a pub, this chain is for you."}
{"text":"This is a great chain of steakhouses. I've been to the one in Toronto and it was excellent. When I saw my hotel was close to here I had to go. First off the service is fantastic. From the check in to the waiter everything was great. Now on to the food I love the mushrooms Neptune they are very good for stuffed mushrooms. I didn't order them but saw many get the nachos and they looked amazing. I ordered the classic prime rib which comes with a salad and I ordered the wedge. I love dressing and a lot of it and it came with the right amount and was very good. The prime rib was cooked just how I ordered it medium rare and was so good. As far as sides I've only had the twice baked potato and it's always so good."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game. Steaks are meh but the appetizers and lobster keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food with beautiful ambiance. The location of the restaurant in Montreal makes it very nice."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Best Keg location in the city. Been to the others and always am disappointed. Each meal I've had at this location has been better then the last. The service is top notch and not to mention walking in on a Saturday night and waiting less then 5 minutes for a table for 4 - can't be beat!!"}
{"text":"YUM! Delicious steaks, sides, appetizers and very interesting drink menu. The ambiance is amazing, and the service was great. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came for our 14th anniversary food was excellent service was great and the restaurant is beautiful and you dont even know that is attached to Fairview shopping center."}
{"text":"This Keg is better than your average steak house. The patio upstairs is great in the summer. A nice view of the Holiday Inn. The steak is standard, but the bar menu has interesting items. Caution! The portabello mushroom burger is actually vegetarian."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were awesome as usual.  Only issue I had was when bartender ordered the waitress to clean the glasses...and then proceeded to complain to Manager about issue...all in front of me and my friend.  Honestly, not a cheap place to visit - I don't really want staff's issues discussed while I am trying to enjoy myself.  I was not impressed with this and hope she learns to be careful when and where to be bossy and try to score points with the Manager."}
