{"text":"We have been customers of this place for 4 years and were once extremely happy with the food and the service. Unfortunately the original owners sold it to someone with no restaurant experience and the service has tanked. As I write this I am waiting for a delivery order that was ordered almost an hour and a half ago, and I was told we would get it in 30 minutes. I am trying to call but their line has been busy for 10 minutes. Also, they haven't updated their web site with the daily specials in a month. They appear to be falling into chaos."}
{"text":"I called in a big order for me and my coworkers a few weeks back. Around a dozen sandwiches or so. The girl that took my order on the phone was rude and didn't seem to know the menu and how substitutions and add-ons work. I went over the order with her at least 3 or 4 times, every time she missed something as I read it back to her. That should have been the first omen I picked up on to steer clear of this place. 

So, the girl tells me it'll be ready in about 30 min. I work close by, so I give it 15 min and then head over. I have never been to this place, so I thought I would pop in and check the place out while they finished up my order. As soon as I set foot inside the place, I noticed it was empty. Not a single patron during lunch time. Another bad omen in my book. I see a girl at the register, so I walk over to her. She barely mustered a \"Can I help you?\" but did not manage a \"Hello\" in any way shape or form. When I told her who I was and what my order was, she almost barked at me that I came too early and that it wasn't ready yet. 

The sweaty old guy that was making the food had a real sourpuss of a face and kept giving me the stink-eye as he slathered condiments and layers of meat onto hoagies. You could tell he made the food out of spite. Mmmm, sandwiches made with hate. Is there anything sweeter?

All in all, it took 45 min to make my order. 30 of which I spent at the joint, being uncomfortably stared at. After all that time, I just wanted to get out of there. I grabbed my bags when I was called, asked if there were napkins with the order (to which the girl said yes) and got the hell out of dodge. 

I got back to work and went through the order. NOTHING was marked and there were NO napkins. I had to open each sandwich to see what it was and hand out crappy paper towels along with them because we got shafted on napkins. Not cool. 

My sandwich was okay. I did a \"build your own.\" Hot pastrami, mayo, yellow mustard, lettuce and tomato. Hard to screw up, right? WRONG. One half of the sandwich had what I ordered, the other half had... Thousand Island Dressing? What the hell? Yeah. it's like the old man started with the Thousand Island, realized he screwed it up, and instead of tossing out that hoagie, decided to stick with it like no one would be the wiser. The half that was made correctly wasn't too bad. The other half I couldn't even eat. I picked at the pastrami a bit and then threw it away in disgust. Most of my coworkers seemed relatively satisfied, but they all ordered pretty basic subs with cold-cuts. However, one of them ordered a Philly Cheese Steak that we all agreed was the most awful looking sandwich ever made. It was soggy, the meat was unrecognizable. It looked like hamburger meat or chopped liver and not the ribeye beef we were expecting. I took a few bites and it tasted even worse than it looked. 

This place is never getting another penny from me. It's a shame too, 'cause some of the pics people posted here of the sandwiches actually look appetizing."}
{"text":"Okay, so aside from the name... which was TOTALLY the reason we pulled in here to eat... this place is great! It was quick! Has outside seating if wanted. Their specials are awesome! I completely enjoyed their southwest chicken wrap (Ron got that, and I ate it... LOL), and their Spinach salad! I can't wait to go back to see what other gems they have on their menu!"}
{"text":"For me it's all about the food here! I really love the different options in subs that you have! And the fact that you have the ability to build your own sub. Like the fact that menu is New York inspired!"}
{"text":"The best sandwiches in the valley.  Always perfectly fresh, hefty amount of meat, great bread and custom made just the way you like it.  All around an excellent experience."}
{"text":"I love Bite Me Subs! We order lunch for our office from here and every time I get something different and I have yet to be disappointed. We always have it delivered but the phone service is great and delivery guys are always happy to see us (I love delivery guys with personality) I think the food is really good quality for the price and the portions are huge. We ordered breakfast a couple times and that was even great. Give them a shot."}
{"text":"My life long love.....shhhh please don't tell anyone! :)

The first time someone asked me \"Do you want Bite Me?\" My mouth hit the floor, eyes wide from shock and disbelief, I said....\"usually I prefer dinner and a movie first but you can't say that at work?!?!\"  They said noooo its a sub place just try it, everyone's ordering for lunch. Hesitantly, I locked in my order...

Long story short......If Jesus were to create a sandwich and infuse it with Rainbows, Sunshine, Children's laughter and Puppies ....It would be a Bite Me Sub! 

My regular is the Philly Cheese Steak 9\" Sub, No Mushrooms (Eww fungus) and a side of fries......G rated: DE-LICI-OUSSS!.......R rated: Mouthgasm 

Not liking Bite Me Subs is the same as not liking Sunday Night Football, Cold Beer, Summer nights on 4th of July, Bonfires  & Apple Pie...Not American!"}
{"text":"First timer. Not a fan. 
Took 10 minutes to make a sandwich, plus they just slapped some bread with mayo, lettuce and chicken and called it a good sandwich. 
Plus a salad? Could be better!
$9 - not worth the money. 

Sowwy."}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty good but they literally never answer their phone to place an order.  My co-worker has called six times this morning over an hour time to order our office breakfast.  I guess we will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times for lunch with my friends/co-workers.  My best friend really likes this place too and she is very picky. While they don't make their own bread everything I have ever tried has been good.  The place is clean, and the staff has always been friendly to me.  As a side note they do have the best fries."}
{"text":"Ive had bite me subs deliver to my office many times; they always had my order right and the food was always packaged well along with napkins, ketchup, etc.  I like ordering tuna or spicy chicken sandwiches;most sandwiches come with fries.  The bread is always fresh... Try their cheesecakes, yum yum!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Best sandwiches in Arizona.  Great customer service and always fast"}
{"text":"Second round on this neighborhood sandwich spot. AND or the second time the staff was in the middle of a back and forth private joke. Not the time or place to be goofin around. I ordered a ruben with slaw on it, the sandwich came soggy on the bottom and could have been avoided if was constructed different. Just a lack of care all around. Could be good with a little effort."}
{"text":"I kind of have to be fair since I have only been here once and a sub place need usually more than a one time visit to see if it was the sub that you had. I did have the canal street as it seems that this was the most popular by way of reviewers. But I did not considered it earth shattering as some would have led you to believe. It was okay a little good at best. Bread-good, ingredients-plentiful and fresh, flavor-dull to bland. Over all It seems a nice place and okay price, not as cheap as some think or maybe they haven't ate at many places, it is fair and about similar to other sub places. Base on just the one sub, I would have given it a 2 star but I think maybe it was my taste. I was planning to go back and try more subs before I wrote this review, but I am feeling lazy and uninspired to do so. So it is 3 star, definitely better than the chains and for a couple of dollars, give your taste buds a treat. It is on par with other sub places, nothing stands out to me anyway."}
{"text":"My personal favorite sub shop in the Tempe area. The subs are money! I love the service I get everyte me I go in, I have not had a bad experience yet. I suggest Bite Me to anyone who is looking for a good sub. The owner is a great guy!"}
{"text":"I'm so lucky to work in walking distance of Bite Me Subs. I've been here at least twice a month for the last year. I mostly get salads but have also ordered the turkey wrap which is a perfect light sandwich lunch (I say light but it's huge). When starved and feeling like I needed a few more calories in my life I had the Philly Cheese Steak - awesome! 
But back to the salads. They use fresh crisp romaine, cucumbers, the tomatoes on last weeks salad were amazing. I had the Cobb and its perfect amount of veggies and protein. Only 4 stars because they could improve with their dressings. 
Everyone is super friendly. Next time you are in the area I suggest you skip the Arby's and cross the street to BMS."}
{"text":"I love their Reuben I get it all the time. Reasonable prices and they usually make a big sandwich w lots of meat on it. I got their cobb salad once and it was ok. The service is ok. I usually just get it to go. They are closed in Sunday's wish they were open because sometimes I work on the weekends."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my all time favorite sub shops! I always get the philly cheese steak and it is one of the best I've had. The staff is very friendly and the service is fast. Highly recommend going here when you get the chance."}
{"text":"I gave this place a second try but I won't be going there again. I asked both times for my sub to be toasted and they didn't. I have no interest in a floppy Philly. You can get a better Philly literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"Great subs and great service. The Chelsea is a classic. Sandwiches are a tad pricey, but they are worth it. I've always loved this place. I just wish it was open on weekends like it used to be. Maybe one day ownership will decide to resume that."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and prices are fair. My office regularly orders from them and they are always quick to deliver!"}
{"text":"To start, the subs are good. But then again, it's pretty hard to screw up a sub. Lots of fresh sliced meat piled high on our subs which is nice. They don't bake their own bread, so who knows how fresh it really is. The place was dead and yet there were several dirty tables. Then they had the classic rock blaring from the back and a tv blaring in the dining room, so all I heard was loud chaos.. Rather annoying. If it weren't for the fact the food was decent, I'd prolly give them 1 star."}
{"text":"I feel kinda dumb for not noticing this place. After all, it's in my neighborhood and almost in walking distance; so there is that, and also the fact that the food here is stellar. 

The first thing that came to mind, after taking a bite and restraining myself from proceeding to stuff my face as much as possible, was the quality of the ingredients. I ordered the \"Stormin Norman\", which came with roast beef, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, cherry peppers, horseradish, and mayo.

Now try getting that at Subway!
Or maybe Circle K's pathetic attempt at sandwiches across the street. 
Or maybe the Arby's across the street. 

If you do....OH FOR SHAME! :)

I'm looking at over 15 different choices on a stylishly done menu here; and its clear that the local owners here are bringing that east coast flair into our desert. That, and I guess I like the colors and the look of chalk letters that aren't chalk. Or maybe they are? I don't know, but for so many great things to choose from, I must thank them. 

I hope you do as well. Spending your dollars at local businesses helps our community. You also get an experience with uniqueness and culture-BECAUSE you don't see Quizno's on the Food Network-or in real life for that matter. Ha! 

I will be telling everyone I know about this place. I think I've learned my lesson: \"Pay more attention to whats around me!\" :)"}
{"text":"I just moved from Philly a few months ago. I've tried cheese steaks from several places and so far, this place has the best one. The staff here is super friendly and the food is served hot and fresh, really fast!"}
{"text":"The place changed ownership recently and has gone down hill ever since. I was a regular customer for both delivery and eat in. The staff used to be friendly and always remembered who you were. Deliver used to be prompt and correct. The last sandwich I ordered here was not only  made wrong but took an over an hour to be delivered. Saturdays it is hit or miss as to whether they are open or answer the phone. Sad to see a great little neighborhood place sink into oblivion."}
{"text":"soooooooooo glad i gave it another shot.

i LOVE roast beef sandwiches. especially roast beef sandwiches that are RARE and have a lot of meat on them!!!!!!  the cheddar cheese is really good, the horseradish mayo could be spicier...but the sub roll it comes on is delicious and didn't fall apart. i hate it when that happens.
the stormin norman (minus tomatoes and peppers) is absolutely fantastic and i want to eat it every single day. for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Very good basic turkey sub from the make your own sub category. I got a massive 12 inch sub (see pic) with great quality turkey piled high and fresh, crisp vegetables on good bread, including cucumber slices. The twist to this place is that they start with the bread and then put the cheese and veggies in the sub and lastly throw all the turkey on top of those two items. Kind of like a reverse sub sandwich. It's unusual at first, but the ingredients are solid and soon it seems like your wondering why every sub shop doesn't build their subs this way. An extra $1 for a bag of chips and this was a filling lunch. Get the 9 inch if your not that hungry, but for a dollar more, buy the large and save half for later (if you can)."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good sandwich if I do say so my self!! Went here with co workers for lunch and had the Broadway Joe, it's a pastrami, corn beef, 1000 island dressing melted Swiss and slaw. I could eat this Sandwich nearly every day, flavors are out of sight and the portions are big. Looking forward to going back next time I'm in town so I can try another item."}
{"text":"It smells like sewage in there due to a trap that needs replacing. It is literally about 100 degrees inside the store, especially hot in back. Inproper food handling and just poor attitudes all around. I worked there one day and am forever traumatized. I've had many food service jobs and this place was the worst.  I have been unable to get paid, and had to fight to get my food handler's card back. First the owner Sue told me I could pick up my check and food handler's card on Friday. I went Friday to pick them up. Then I was told they were both mailed. The next day I called and spoke to an employee who confirmed I had been lied to, and my food handler's card was there. So I went to pick it up. It is now 4 days later and I have not received my check. Why should I have to fight so hard to be paid the minimum wage I worked for? I was supposed to be cut tips that day but never received those either. This company needs to figure out that when an employee does a job for them they must be compensated with a wage. I hope no one else gets ripped off by these awful people."}
{"text":"First of all the horrible, sulphur smell that knocks you in the face as you walk in is disgusting. The Thai place next door has the same problem, so obviously they need to take that up with their landlord. Overall, this place is \"Eh\" at best. The staff has no clue about service or the menu. I asked for suggestions and the cashier proceeded to prattle off the sandwich description. Not helpful. I asked for mustard on my sandwich, the guy acted like it was the biggest inconvenience ever \"But I have it already set up (big sighhhhh)\" My step son ordered a sandwich without tomatoes, there were tomatoes on his sandwich. I also think we got over charged somehow, because two combos ended up bein $25. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I got the New Yorka & a side of fries, which was pretty good. However, a few other customers were overcharged & not all orders were coming out in the order they were taken."}
{"text":"In short: Subs, Service, and the Price were all disappointing.

I love a good sub, nothing like biting on a nice crispy role with just the right bread to meat ratio, topped off with crunchy greens and fresh veggies, served with a nice smile at a good price.  This place had none of that.  The bread was doughy and felt more like a dinner roll, there was enough meat but everything was too salty. My sub came with some cream smothered slaw on top.  Didn't even ask me if I wanted anything else, or explain any other options in toppings to me and seemed to be annoyed when I said hold the mayo and 1000 island.  BTW, they put 1000 island on EVERYTHING!!!  They also seemed mildly annoyed that I wanted different toppings.  It cost about 7 bucks for a 9 inch sub, with the meal it's almost 10 as a meal, not worth for a lunch break in my opinion.  Much better service, food, and deals out there."}
{"text":"This is normally a great little spot... I walked in today and there was such a strong smell. It actually smelled like sewer. I was really taken back... not enough to leave but close! My club was just as good as I remembered it though. I will be back, hopefully next time the smell will be fixed!

UPDATE..: I have been back twice now and they are definitely back on track. This is a great little gem! If you are looking for good affordable food! You must try this spot!"}
{"text":"We've been here multiple times and although my boyfriend always gets the tuna, I've tried something new every time. This tuna sandwich is the best in Phoenix. Idk what the put in the mix but it's amazing. So far my favorites are the Suzie Q with bacon, and the Cuban. Everything is amazing, all the way down to their fries. We try to come here once a week, and I take all my friends who haven't had it before. Great mom and pop sandwich shop, with very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches.  Better than subway for sure!  I go here at least once every couple weeks because it is in walking distance from work.  I've had a few of the regular sandwiches, some of the hot sandwiches, and breakfast also.  I've never had anything that was disappointing.  If you're in the area and want a sandwich, stop in and support a local small business.  It's good!"}
{"text":"At work today and order from Bite Me Subs, my lunch arive very quickly. I had the chicken sandwich, so sloppy good, loved it and huge portion of fries.  What I really want to give two thumbs up about is that my food did not arive in styrofroam! I hate that stuff.  They use a carboard tye of container wich is so much better for the inviorement. In this day an age no one should be useing styrafoam any more.
KUDOS BITE ME SUBS"}
{"text":"This is the second time we ate here and it was still bad. we had 2 salads delivered to our work and were so disappointed. The chicken wasn't blackened like the menu says and the flavor wasn't that great. The lettuce was wilted and the dressing was horrible. I called to let them know about the horrible food and the girl on the phone just defended they make everything fresh. I told her we were disappointed and would never order from them again. The total was also $19.35 - for 2 salads and a drink and the delivery driver didn't even bring a receipt of the break down, I feel ripped off."}
{"text":"Thank goodness these nice people opened up this great sandwich shop in the valley. Bite me has by far,the best Philly cheese steak in town.Real shaved rib eye, luscious white American cheese, grilled onions, and whatever else you like on your cheese steaks Sue and her staff are happy to pile it on for you.To the earlier reviewer who said they have bad rolls....do you know what a good one is? Just because those chain shops have 8 different bread choices doesn't mean they know bread, they just have choices.Bite Me's are perfect. Nice and crusty but soft throughout with the perfect bite. All of their sandwiches rock, The Stormin Norman, The Manganaro, heck, even their burger kicks butt.Be sure to check out their daily specials on Facebook also, they never disappoint either. I had a southwestern Reuben there two weeks ago that was so good, it made me question the old school Reuben for superiority. Imagine 1000 island and chipotle mayo had a baby and pastrami took a bath in it. Trust me, for Tempe, Phoenix or even NYC or Philly, this is a great place to get a sandwich. I hear they cater too...."}
{"text":"They are lucky they know how to make a good sandwich because the old man who is making the sandwiches has maybe the worst customer serviceskills I've seen anywhere. I asked to substitute something on the sandwich I ordered and he shook his head like I was such an annoyance to him. So not needed..
The rest of the people that work there are pretty nice though."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this spot. Been a few times & it's always been tasty. Sandwiches are always dressed/topped well & there's a good selection. Plus, i can get fries instead of chips! A good lunch place that im glad is nearby my office."}
{"text":"No extra meat option for subs. And the amount of meat is minimal. Seems a bit rediculous. I am willing to pay for it and they have the meat.... But I can't get them to put it on the sandwich and change me. Seems like a bad business plan."}
{"text":"My experiences with them have been good until the new owners took over.
It took them over an hour to deliver to me. They forgot my fries and drink. My sandwich was cold. I was offered a credit for my next order and took it. You would think happy customer still. NO! I called back to get my credit and the new owner wouldn't honor it. Said he fired the lady that gave it to me for stealing and would not honor credit she made. I asked what does this woman have to do with me not getting what I paid for. 15 dollars and some change for a cold sandwich and the lesson to never take a credit always get your money back!!!"}
{"text":"Well you guys are just the worst. Don't advertise that you're open if you can't answer your phone!!! I've called three times with no answer!!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches very fresh and I love the carne asada fries. Definitely not your chain food, food ;)"}
{"text":"Just had their Cuban sandwich and it was the best I've ever eaten. Very fast and friendly employees. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Bite Me Subs is a favorite go to lunch spot since my office is just a few blocks away.  I love, love, love the Southwest Chicken Wrap - it's delicious!  The roast beef sandwich and the Cuban are also fantastic choices. I frequent this place during the work week and I have gotten my co-workers hooked on this place as well.  Chicken wrap and baked Lay's and it's a decently healthy lunch.  Although if you are looking for a little splurge, their chocolate chip cookies are amazing.  Good for delivery too if your office isn't too far away."}
{"text":"Great local sandwich shop that caters to the greater Tempe area. That creative combinations of sandwiches are delicious!!  I highly recommend trying their lunch or breakfast."}
{"text":"I normally go here during lunch, mainly for the subs. Well today I go an try a salad. Chicken finger salad. Nice looking salad, I say looking is because as I sit here at my desk lookin at this salad because the staff failed to give me silverware or anything to eat with. Wtf .. stick to the subs unless u like see food lol"}
{"text":"This place is so good.  The owner is the Vincent Van Gogh of sandwiches--a true artist.  Unlike Vincent, she really cares that the sandwiches are made in the traditional manner.  The people who work here are happy and want the customers to be satisfied.  The bread, meat and all the fixin's are done in high quality fashion.  We have become regulars."}
{"text":"A pretty run of the mill sandwich place.  Now in their defense I'm basic so I got a buffalo chicken wrap, nothing special.   Chicken was good and sauce was tangy.  It was not constructed well as you can see in the pic.  

The price is slightly above average for me for the wrap.  They are super friendly there and have an extensive menu which includes breakfast stuff. 

I prefer it over subway I will say and I'd rather support local biz than a chain."}
{"text":"For my lunch today I was driving down the road to find a new place to eat. I came across this place and I would highly recommend for all sandwich lovers to come here! I forgot the name of the sandwich I had but it was soooooo good!! The bread was fresh and soft. The veggies were delicious and the sandwich was seasoned perfectly.
Oh!and as soon as I walked in I was greeted and the entire staff was really friendly. I will definitely be coming back, and I also noticed that they deliver :)"}
{"text":"Cuban was on point! I called my sandwich in on a Monday and came to pick it up and it was made quickly and I was helped the second I walked in. The worst thing is when someone makes a Cuban and deviates the typical recipe. Bite Me did not deviate and I was really appreciative of this! 

The only thing that concerned me was that it was pretty hot in the building itself but it was clean and seemed like they were just letting the cool air in from outside. 

Go to Bite Me!"}
{"text":"I thought I'd give Bite me a try since it's close to home and I'm trying to find a great sandwich joint.  Showed up for a late lunch to-go around 3pm and ordered the Rajin Cajun specialty sub.  I got home opened the to-go box and was surprised to find my specialty \"sub\" on a cheap ass hamburger bun?!?!  Not only was my sub on a hamburger bun, but a soggy bun at that; half the bread fell off making a huge mess.  

I gave two starts because the combination of ingredients worked well together, even though I definitely wasn't wowed by it either.  The french fries were pretty tasty too.

Bottom line, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with my friend Ian and ordered the Philly Cheese Steak and it was amazing and the people inside were nice as can be, they all knew Ian by name when we walked in, and the price is real nice."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place until a month or so ago, one of the guys came into our office and dropped off a menu so we decided to give it a try....yum!! I love that they have really unique daily specials for both sandwiches and salads, and they're great about posting the specials on their Facebook page most mornings. VERY fast delivery, which is always a plus when you're hungry and too swamped to leave the office. You have to try the Susie-Q - turkey, sprouts, cucumber & cream cheese on sourdough. WOW!!

2 reasons I did not give a 5-star rating - one is because you can't order online.  Sometimes when the phones get busy it's just easy and convenient to be able to hop on the website and order lunch while you're pretending to listen to your customers ;)  but mostly it's because of their roast beef sandwich aka Stormin' Norman....umm can you say RARE??  I have never been served such rare roast beef before in my life and when I called & asked about it, they said that's just how they serve it...hmm. At least warn people, I understand some probably like it like that but I would bet money that I'm not alone in being a bit grossed out & caught off guard by it. Had the roast beef been more well done and less bright pink I know it would have been delicious, especially with the horseradish mayo that comes on it. Other than that, I have yet to be disappointed in any of the other menu items I've tried!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time today. Service was wonderful. Staff was friendly and helpful. Restaurant was clean and didn't have a smell like previous posts had suggested. I ordered the Philly Cheese steak with everything and added jalapenos. Delicious!! It was exactly what I had been craving. I defiantly will be adding this to the list of lunch stops when needing to go out."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great sandwiches, good Cobb salad, the avacado wrap they occasionally offer is good too. Service is great - everyone who works here is beyond nice. I've got to try their breakfast burritos!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Two words, Canal Street.  Get it, eat it, LOVE it.  I have been here probably 20 times in the last 4 months.  Just can't seem to get enough.  If you don't mind spending a couple more dollars than you would at that joke for a sub place, what's it called, oh yeah, subway, then go to Bite Me Subs.  So much meat packed into that sandwich, you will have a hard time eating a 12\" sub.

They also have other great items like Breakfast burritos, skillets, and burgers.

You will be greeted by a friendly smile and quick service followed by the best sub in town.

I say thank you to Bite Me for this hole in the wall sub shop, I will see you all again soon.

On my last note, I do feel the need to address one complaint I read from Dar C.  REALLY???!!??  You complained cause you didnt grab your own plastic-wear after getting your salad.  It just happens to be right where they walk over to hand you your food.  That sounds like your own fault.  To give a bad review because YOU messed up is just stupid.  Maybe you need to stick to ordering subs and let them make what they make."}
{"text":"Stopped by here when we were in the area based on some Yelp reviews...probably would've drove right by it otherwise.  This sandwich shop is located in an old building and could really use some updating but that's about the only negative I can say.  I ordered the Canal Street and it was delicious.  The bread was incredibly fresh, as were the veggies, and the meat was piled on.  Definitely a great sub.  The hubby enjoyed the Chicken Caesar Wrap and the daughter enjoyed the Buffalo Chicken sandwich and fries. No complaints all around.  Service was quick and friendly too.  I would definitely return if in the area."}
{"text":"Had the philly cheese steak... Awesome!! I would have given 5 stars but didn't get to try anything else on the menu..."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years now. One of the hardest things for me to find was a great little sandwich shop that I could be a regular to. Well, I found it. What sets them apart from the others? Simply, the meat. The bread is store bought, so they lose a point for that, but the fixins are always fresh and flavorful- but not like the meats! When I bite into my super Turkey Sandwich, I taste turkey. Above all else, the turkey. Usually, for me, I find the sauces and the cheese can actually over-power the base flavors of the protein. But not these guys. And it's such tender, thinly shredded turkey at that. Mmmm. 
Staff is friendly too. Go bite you a Bite me"}
{"text":"I've been coming here about once a week lately. The food is extremely good. Today I watched somebody make my sandwich with no gloves on, right after coming out of the restroom. When I left I just put the entire bag in the garbage. Last time I checked, gloves are a requirement not an option. Just kind of grossed me out. Get with the program. Bad form."}
{"text":"I don't understand the other reviews because my experience was great.  My sandwich was so delicious I went back the next day and ordered it again.

I decided to stop because I love the name of the place and I love subs.  I ordered the 12\" Philly Cheese Steak with green peppers, onions and no mushrooms.  The cheese was incredible and melted throughout the entire sandwich making it creamy and delicious.

Pricing is fair and the restaurant has plenty of seating.  I would recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"I'm assuming they're under new ownership but nevertheless service is poor with much longer wait times than in the past. I waited for 15+ minutes when I was one of two customers in the shop. Turns out they never even put the order in even though I had paid for it already. Will not be coming back ever again and I expect it to be closed soon enough."}
{"text":"What a great sub with 8oz of meat!  This place puts Jimmy Johns and other sub places to shame.  Great service too and I did not have to wait long.  Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, AWESOME BURGERS, and wonderful breakfast...that's a great combo, but you add in fast & inexpensive delivery, it's a COMPLETE winner!  My co-workers and I order at least once a week and have never been disappointed.  They're a small, family owned business too...all the more reason to frequent.
Thank you, Bite Me!  You make us happy!!!"}
{"text":"I love Bite Me Sub's.  The food is always fresh. The sandwiches are creative and flavorful. The staff is attentive and friendly.  If you are looking for one of the best Cuban or Philly cheese sandwiches, look no further. Excellent sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a work lunch! I do all the ordering for the Monday meeting luncheons and I am very happy with this place! Everyone int he office can find something they like, be it a sandwich healthy salad or a greasy burger. The best part is they are on time. We have to start our meetings  promptly at 11:30 a.m. and I need the food to be here a little before so we can get situated before calling into the conference line. 

On top of all that, they are very inexpensive. Since Jimmy John's has raised their prices ridiculously we had to find a new affordable place near by and we have found a winner."}
{"text":"A must try. Bite Me Subs offers amazing subs that can satisfy any craving. I have tried almost all of the hot sandwiches and they are each phenomenal in their own way. I almost get it once a week for lunch and every time I finish my sandwich, I always question myself why I did not get the 20 inch instead. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! We love getting breakfast delivered on Saturday mornings!!! My two favorite subs are the Cuban and the Broadway Joe!! Hands down the best subs I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"Ate here once. They have a great Cuban sub. Went to grab one today and had no less than 5 employees completely ignore me - 3 of whom were facing me - so I left without acknowledgement. As I was leaving the parking lot, I noticed the two guys who were behind me in line getting into their car. I'll assume they were ignored also. Tempe is inundated with sandwich shops these days - good luck! (*sent while eating my Firehouse sub)"}
{"text":"This is a cool little shop that tries hard to please its customers and make quality food. There's some things on the menu they make very well and others that aren't so good though."}
{"text":"Ohhh my Dayuumm,,,

Ok, wasnt here for a salad, or a burger or come here only for the restroom...,,, I decided on the hmmm a SUB... 
Staff were tentative, and \"the old guy\" making the samiches was genuine.. 

The Food:
The Cuban.. toasted sub wuth Ham, Pork,, yes Pork AND ham in the same samich,, along with crunchy pickles and some mustard spicy or not,,, but wow,, the flavors blended very nicely,... 

Price was comparative to the amount of FOOD most definitley..
Will be back,, It will be a coin flip of Sub Factory and this place... 
Next trip will be the philly, and if the mushrooms are fresh, then sub factory may have to be archived away..."}
{"text":"Bite Me, rules!  We have ordered from this place on several occasions since they opened and none of the guys at my shop have ever had a \"sub\" par sandwich.  Always meaty and delicious!  My favorite is the Canal Street, but I also like the Cuban, the Broadway Joe and the Philly Cheese Steak.  Service has always been super friendly and usually fast.  We have them delivered on occasion, and only once did it take longer than expected, but I understand they were swamped at the time."}
{"text":"Average sandwich place. Sub-par service. Why on earth would someone want to talk to a rude employee only to then wait 10 minutes for a sandwich. If you ask me there are far better options in town."}
{"text":"I love the food here, so I try to arrange my schedule to allow me to eat here at least once a week.  The subs are so much better than the big chain store crap.  Always freshly made, and enough meat to actually taste it.  All the workers are friendly and service is quick.  I especially like the cheese steak, you just can't get them this good anywhere else.  Try them, you will like them."}
{"text":"Place used to be great with friendly staff. New owner/staff are not near as nice/customer service oriented and the food has suffered, also. I used to go about once a week, but have only gone twice under the new ownership. Not sure if I will go back at this point."}
{"text":"Bite Me Subs is down the street from my office and is the preferred go to when I'm in the mood for a sandwich at lunch.  I've had hot and cold subs (and sandwiches on their whole wheat bread). They have different daily specials but there is so much variety on the regular menu, I never get bored with the same old thing. Staff is friendly, food has always been fresh and is higher quality then some of those other generic-chain sandwich shops."}
{"text":"Bite Me Subs is a great place!  They pile on the meat.  There is no microwave or frozen products.  Everything is fresh and made to order the way you specify.
 Asada fries are bigger, fresher and cheaper than all the ---ibertos.  The 9 inch sub is big enough to share or take home half.
Looking forward to going back for more pastrami and corned beef and to try everything on the menu.
Tables to eat outside.........."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  It's a good sub shop, authentic.  I always get the Philly and fries.  They have sriracha, which is a must for a good sub.  Easy to bump into people you know b/c everybody comes back."}
