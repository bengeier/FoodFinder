{"text":"I was craving a Greek Salad.. Thought this would be the best place too go.. Mistaken. The service was slow, despite the fact we were the only two people there. The menus were sticky, unclean and my partner didn't feel comfortable to eat there. I was over charged for a simple medium size plate of salad.. Never returning. Two stars, because I got a Greek salad and didn't get sick."}
{"text":"We stopped by and had excellent service. We had the combination plate for 2 and it was an awesome deal.  Everything was fabulous the rice was amazing the hummus was creamy and very tasty and my fiance who is Mediterranean the baklava was the best she ever had.  Everything was fresh.  They also have belly dancing and an open Mike night... the best Greek food I have had sine I was in Greece."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place is in business.  There was nobody there for dinner, the waiter was incompetent, the food was mediocre, and the owner was rude. I will never be going back there.  It was a Friday night, and some friends and I wanted to go Salsa dancing, so we figured we'd go here and just get there early for some dinner.  Bad idea.  The food was mediocre, but the waiter was so incompetent it became funny.  He told us we could order sandwiches from the lunch menu, but forgot to tell us that it didn't come with the usual hummus or house salad - only french fries - until the food had already come. We ordered 2 shwarmas and 2 felafels, and he brought 3 felafels.  When he went back to get the shwarma, apparently they were now out of it, but we could get gyros (pronounced in the most non-authentic way ever).  We got the salad instead.  When ordering drinks, he had no idea what grenadine was or if they had it, even though there is a full bar. .  Somehow he managed to split the check correctly!  Onto the dancing:  the lessons were pretty good, form 9:30 - 10:30, split into 2 different groups. There was a decent crowd and a DJ, although I wasn't fond of the DJs mix of music.    The worst part for me was that the when I took my glass from dinner up to the bar, they would not give me water, or even a glass of ice, insisting that I had to pay the $2 for a bottle of water. I've  heard this is illegal in AZ, but even if it's not, it's still bad business practice.   After getting annoyed with the bartender, he finally gave me some ice so I could go fill up the glass with warm water from the bathroom.   I'm sorry, but especially when there is a $7 cover for dancing, and when the air-conditioning was not keeping up with the amount of people, you have to offer water. That is non-negotiable to me.    The cherry topper was that when I asked to talk to the manager (who I think was the owner), letting him know that he had to make water available if he wanted people to come for dancing, he said in a rude manner, \"If you can't afford $2 for water, than you can just leave\".   So we did, and I will never go back. I hope you never do, either."}
{"text":"I was so shocked at the amount and quantity of the food here that I couldn't even say anything and just left as quickly as possible.  I ordered the \"Olive Branch vegetarian feast\" for $14.95 and were served: one dollop of hummus, one dollop of babaganoush, three of the smallest grape leave rolls I've ever seen and three pices of over-cooked falafel. And a single pita chopped into quarters. The babaganoush was inedible; the falafel was the worst I have ever had. Take my word, this is one of the worst restaurants I've ever been in.  The only way they make money is by hosting salsa dances. Which brings me to the kitschy decor (vast, open dance floor with that blue plastic-encased lighting. I posted a picture, in case you want to see the whole uninviting effect."}
{"text":"Best little spot for Mediterranean food and an oasis of good cuisine in a desert of fast food eateries. I came here with a friend when on a trip to the area. We both have restricted diets (she's gluten-intolerant and I'm lactose-intolerant and vegetarian). It was one of the only places that we found that offered lots if options for each of us that we also flavorful and satisfying. I love Mediterranean food and eat cuisine from the Middle East and Greece all the time, so believe me when I say this has got to be one of the best Mediterranean spots I've ever been to.  I had the vegetarian plate which was baba ganoush, hummus, falafel and salad (also dolmas but i'm not crazy snout those so i just asked for extra salad). It also came with warm pita bread. I usually just pick at baba ganoush, but this was hands down the best I've ever eaten. It was smoky, but not overly so. Creamy and delicious with a little olive oil for extra flavor. My friend also enjoyed it. The hummus was incredible as were the falafel. You could taste how fresh  everything was and that it was prepared with care and love.   I should also note that when we wandered in, there was a group of women practicing belly-dancing, how cool is that?!  The waitress was very kind and cheerful and though we didn't have much time, we were able to sit back and enjoy our meal, but also get moving once we had to.  We ended up coming here the next day for a snack. I got the arabic tea, which in my mind is a sign of authenticity. It was expertly prepared and tasted like cardamom. Yum! We met the owner, who was lovely to chat with, as well as one of the waiters who was very attentive.  I would highly highly recommend this place. It was thoroughly enjoyable and completely unexpected. In chatting with the owners and wait staff, sounds like they offer a lot of events to the community (salsa nights, other festivities, etc.) and they have a coupon/special too, which sounded like a really good deal that I would have totally taken advantage of had I been local.  Most of all, what I will re-iterate is FRESH, FRESH, FRESH! Key part in some very tasty food."}
{"text":"Heres the thing about this place: the price. When we walked in the place was dead and as soon as I saw the menu I knew why. The prices were laughably high. If I wanted to pay $40 a plate I would go to Kierland or Downtown Phoenix, not a hole in the wall in tempe. The food was actually good, but i was left hungry at the end. I could have gone to Chipotle and had better food and enough of it to last a week for what I paid for this scampy meal. Management needs to take these reviews seriously or I can't imagine how long this place is gonna be in business."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. The food is OK, the baba ganoush had too much garlic and the grape leaves were chewy. Not worth the high prices. The place was completely empty at 5pm on a Sunday, but neither our table nor the one next to us was clean. I tried to redeem a restaurant.com coupon and the owner refused to accept it. I have used these coupons numerous times at other establishments without a problem. He was rather unreasonable and stated that I was at fault for not displaying the coupon when I first walked in. Apparently he had some issues with the company. I tried to explain that I had nothing to do with that and he still refused my coupon. I will not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place only gets one star because the rating system doesn't have negatives. How is this craphole even still open? This was probably the worst restaurant I have been to and I sorely regret ever eating there. I may barf just thinking about it. Think of a category that I could rate, like decor, and I will give it a -10000. STAY AWAY! Someone give me the number to the health inspectors."}
{"text":"A Greek restaurant with salsa dancing you ask?  Random, I know.  We were the ONLY FOUR PEOPLE there for salsa night, and the food wasn't much to crow about either.  I went here a few months ago with some friends all psyched to do something different and check out their Friday salsa night.  We were the only ones there and the salsa band never showed up.  I guess THEY got tired of coming too.  OK, I think there were 3 others there, and they played a bunch of CDs for the 7 of us there.  But still it wasn't what we were expecting.     We arrived early - 8:30 or so - for dinner and planned to chill out until the crowds started arriving and the dancing started. And we waited.  AND WAITED.  We still danced (or tried to) and made fun of the amateurish murals on the wall, and the non-stop news going on in the background (yes Kristin, they were still playing the news).  Finally we couldn't take it anymore and left.  As for the dinner, the food was OK.  There are definitely better Mediterranean places in Tempe to be had.  Wanting to not dance on a full stomach, we decided to go for gyros.  Even though they had a series of gyros and sandwiches listed on the menu - they apparently don't serve them for dinner, even though that's never indicated on the menu.   So we ended up ordering a bunch of lackluster appetizers:  falafel, dolmades baba ganoush and hummus.  Not bad, but not really great.   The service was kind of bizarre too.  The server had to go back to the kitchen to check a few times if they could make this dish or that dish - as if they didn't have the ingredients.   Maybe we visited on an off night.  But something rubbed me the wrong way initially about a Greek restaurant with salsa dancing.  Now I know why..."}
{"text":"Konichiwa,  Just let me start off by saying there is nobody on this earth that enjoys a good hole in the wall better than me.... And this dumpy Lil spot has been staring me in the face everyday as I leave the gym across the street. I imagined a Greek family right off the boat probably owned the place and put out incredible, authentic dishes. I was right in one area... The guy who helped me was an outgoing, energetic, nice Greek dude.  Unfortunately, atmosphere- blows... More unfortunately, food- horrendous. Even worse- SEVERELY OVER PRICED. $15 for a TINY piece of chicken with some outrageously oily rice and a nasty oily, weird, vinigery salad... I ordered to go, however if I would have looked in the box before I left I would have asked for my money back.   I hate to post a negative review on such a little restaurant, but it's very necessary. Had I known I would have avoided the place."}
{"text":"I had had a heinous week at work, been ill, and just wasn't up for the noise of Monkey Pants when Hubby wanted to meet me for dinner with the ulterior motive of a visit to Pets Inc. So I suggested we try the Olive Branch. What a sad place this is. First of all, when I entered, there was only one other couple there. I thought, \"this is never a good sign,\" but I dreaded the migraine I might have from the Pants. So I sat, ordered a Bombay Sapphire and hummus with lamb, and waited for Hubby. It took a while to get my gin because the waitress had to ask several people if they had Bombay, and then it was far too strong when I got it. The hummus was pretty garlicky, and the lamb was just OK. It was supposed to have been topped with toasted pine nuts, but it was almond slivers instead. When Hubby arrived, we ordered a sampler dinner for 2 upon the suggestion of the waitress. Hubby had wanted gyros, but they stopped serving all sandwiches at 6:00, and they apparently were incapable of making a gyros platter for dinner. We were quickly served yet another plate of hummus (wish we could have had another option for that), and a salad with Romaine, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, cucumbers, and way way way too much dressing. The main dish had 4 kabobs each with a different meat: chicken (quite good and moist), lamb (my favorite), kafta (hubby liked it , I hated it), and beef (we both liked it). They were served on a bed of mediocre rice and accompanied by mixed veggies. We took our baklava dessert that came with our dinner for 2 deal home, but I wished we had left it on  the table. It was not very fresh and too chewy.  The food was all edible, and some items were pretty good, but we'd had everything better elsewhere. The pathetic atmosphere made it all worse- the bizarre TV programming reminded me a bit of Bollywood stuff I'd seen at an Indian place, but with big hairy Mediterranean types taking off their pants. I was aghast at first, hoping my eyes had not just been drawn to some god awful amateur porn, but thankfully the nudity was limited. The decor is pretty tacky, with a mural likely done by a relative with marginal talent, and kitschy statuary that only old people from the old country seem to find attractive.  Should've gone to Monkey Pants."}
{"text":"One of the staff members was friendly and went out of her way to accommodate.  However, that doesn't go very far once you get the bill.    I would hope for all honest, hard working business owners to do well.  However, I have to warn people... They will come around and give you re-fills on ice tea and then when you get the check, BLAM-O!  You find out they are charging you $2 for each one.  This is definitely not the norm and not what one would expect.  Especially at a place like this.  That is why I'm giving them only one star.  I would not recommend this place at all for both food or alcoholic drinks.  A very tiny shot of tequila is around $8.  I held my plate up for the waiter to take, but he didn't.  He's probably about as good of a waitperson as I would be if I ever gave it a try.  That's why I've never attempted it.  Bless his heart, maybe he will get better.    The decor is not that great or very comfortable, but maybe they just can't put the money into it right now.  I suspect they won't be there for long anyway."}
{"text":"Over-priced, crappy crappy crappy service and the WORST part is the owner! He defines pompous ignorance!!!! Would not go to this place EVER for ANY reason! Not even to use the facilities!!"}
{"text":"The tables were unstable. The water tasted bad. The food was horrible. It's far too over priced. I got the manicotti and the inside just tasted fake and awful. Seriously nothing good about this place. I'm pretty sure the tomato sauce is the same kind they use in those Lunchables pizza kit (I would know, I used to eat those when I was a kid)"}
{"text":"I was impressed by the food and staff. I showed up at almost 10pm on a Tuesday in February. Of course the place was empty and I believe they actually closed at 9pm, but the owner (I assume) welcomed me and my friend warmly and was extremely personable.  Love and care was put into the dishes prepared for us which were pretty standard Mediterranean selections: -Village Greek Salad (no lettuce) - the feta cheese was so incredibly fresh and moist I couldn't believe it. So much flavor in this dish. -Vegetarian entree - hummus, baba ganoush, falafel, grape leaves. Again, everything so fresh and delicious, and truly felt the dish was made personally for me. -Baklava - so flaky and delicious, and have i mentioned fresh yet. Nothing seemed like it had been sitting around or pre-made or pre-purchased.   Atmosphere - this was definitely an experience. We spent dinner with the Lebanese TV channel in the background. I'm not complaining it was a unique experience. I'm sure on other nights this place is hopping with dancing and hookah smoking.   I went with 3 stars because I'm not sure everyone else will have the same experience, or be able to look past the decor which was sortof bordello meets cafeteria."}
{"text":"If you are looking for delicious authentic Mediterranean food, this is a really good place. I felt I was at someone's house having dinner. It is very casual and the owner a very nice guy. Will come back here for sure on my next trip to Phoenix. I tried the lamb over rice with salad. Amazing taste and good portion."}
{"text":"Great food, and good service, but each time I've gone the \"Listening experience\" has varied.  I think I've had MTV a few times, a 24hr news station, and I'm pretty sure there was tejano music in the background, possibly in the kitchen.  But of course, I try to go places during their non-rush lunch hours, so folks that work there are in their \"wind down\" period when I'm there.    I really want to go here for dinner because they do belly dancing and live music, and on some nights they turn it into a full club with dancing and a DJ.  I can see the big dance floor and where the area is for the band, but it's hard to imagine what that might look like!  While I can only recommend it as a lunch place, I'm curious to hear a review from someone on it's late night fun!"}
