{"text":"Ordered this last night for supper, was really good. We had the 45.99 special.  It came with kefta, shish-taouk, filet-mignon, fattoush, fries, hommos, garlic sauce, grilled onions and tomatoes and a 2L of Pepsi. The kefta, shish-taouk and filet mignon tasted very good and were very tender. The fattoush was probably one of the best I've had in a restaurant. Everything was delightful. Highly recommended and not expensive for the quality. They also deliver!"}
{"text":"Grillade Laflamme is my number 1 restaurant since they opened!!!
They have the best Lebanese food in town, the price we payed for the food is very reasonable compare to the great quality they offer!
We ordered few times from them and I've never been disappointed :))
We had food delivered on Xmas for 30 pers, everything was well decorated, and the food is fresh to order.
my favorites is there fattoush with there baked crunchy pita bread,  the shish taouk sandwich is delicious, I like lots of garlic in my sandwich so I always ask for extra ;). U guys should definitely try there Kafka yum yum add to that the cheese rolls and kebbe ...
It's family oriented, they have  2 Tv, to keep the kids busy we ask them to put kids shows.and obviously the chef is a clean freak :))))))
there is few things I didn't try yet, will keep u up to date!
I'm gona stop writing , getting hungry!"}
{"text":"I'll have to update my review.

We ordered from them a few more times and the grub is pretty good. Make sure to ask them to separate things for their salads (like their fattouch) so that it's not soggy by the time you open it.

The meat is tasty and we tend to order their big combo plates.

I'd still say their weakest item on the menu is the shish-taouk though.

Prices have gone up."}
