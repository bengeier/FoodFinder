{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places to go for coffee, or a beer or glass of wine and lots of chilled, rustic but classy atmosphere.
Great meeting spot for me and my motorcycle buddies before a ride. 
Beer and wine selection is excellent (I'm a proud beer and wine snob).
The coffee is great (also a coffee snob)
The wait staff is not only awesome - but they're also a bunch of cowgirl hotties. 
Janey's is ALL about atmosphere and top quality food and drink.  The food menu is definitely limited - as their kitchen is extremely small - but everything is fresh.
I'm not a big review guy - at all. More prone to give a bad review than a good one, but Janey's is a special place."}
{"text":"My favorite place for a coffee or a night cap in the Cave Creek area.  The ambiance is great, with a variety of indoor and outdoor seating arrangements for various group sizes.  The staff is always extremely friendly and you can tell they do their best to remember people's names and drink preference if you come in regularly.  The beer selection is solid, the food is simple but always surprisingly full of flavor and made to order."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food,coffee & bar drinks. Very comfy place to relax in the outdoors or inside on a cooler day. Staff makes us feel very welcome, even in Christmas Eve!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon and sat outside! The sandwich was delicious and loved their black-cherry black tea - yum! Fun local place that has live music."}
{"text":"This place is a little tricky to find but definitely worth the effort. Their sandwiches are made with Boar's Head meat and generous fixings. The side of fruit actually includes berries. The drinks are high quality; I prefer the fresh brewed ice tea. The decor is boldly rustic with a strange mix of heavy materials harvested from the wreckage of a late 1800's southwestern mining town, and well balanced with the feel of a high class bodega from that same time period. A garage-sized door behind the bar opens up into the landscape of our beautiful Sonoran desert.

They also offer live music performances at night.

Check 'em out!"}
{"text":"It was okay, not the best EVER like the reviews stated.  It was pretty empty when we arrived, only one other table with 3 patrons already eating.  The lady at the counter was SUPER nice and friendly. We placed out order and went to sit on the patio.  Apparently there is no live music until much later in the day (we arrived there at 9:00 AM on a Sunday).  The patio was kind of messy and unkept.  We waited about 25 minutes for our simple breakfast burrito and breakfast sandwich (long wait considering we were the only people there).  The breakfast was very good but the atmosphere was kind of bland.  Wish they would have stated online that the live music did not start until much later in the day because that was one of the main reasons we went there.  We will most likely not go back because there was nothing \"special or unique\" about the place.  (and breakfast was $32 for just the two of us)"}
{"text":"The pizza was made to order and delicious but by far the strawberry margarita was fabulous. Great lunch for everyone in our party."}
{"text":"I've been helped by Anna, Rowan, Tatum and Jack at this rustic coffee shop. Have never had a bad experience. They change out their beer taps frequently and have amazing coffee. The food is delicious too. All the staff is friendly and relaxed and always have tasteful music playing. 
THIS IS A MUST TRY DESTINATION!"}
{"text":"This place is just right. It has a rustic feel and great service. Coffee and sweets are great. Under new management, the owner is wonderful. All around, a great place to hang out and chill. We love it!!"}
{"text":"Great patio, atmosphere is nice, music was ok, service was non-existent.  On a Sunday night  the place was quiet, but service was completely non-existent.  Ordered drinks at the bar.  Had to wait several minutes for the staff to remove themselves from the bar stools to get drinks.  And that was the best service of the night.  Our food was served one order at a time, with over an hour between the time the first and the last order were served, even though all 5 of us order at the same time.  To top it off the point of sale payment system allows a minimum tip of 20%."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this gem in Cave Creek.  The coffee is excellent, atmosphere is warm and inviting and the service is friendly.  I wouldn't dream of asking for more, but there is more.  They also serve food and judging from the delicious sandwich I had (a ham and swiss on multi grain, grilled, of the \"build your own\" variety), I will be back for more as soon as I make it out to Cave Creek again.  The patio area is a lovely place to enjoy the sun in a true desert setting.  We enjoyed watching birds (Cardinals, Cactus Wrens, etc) and also got to meet the owner's dog, a sweet and laid back afghan strongly resembling a stuffed animal."}
{"text":"I've been hearing good things about this coffee house in Cave Creek so when a friend suggested we meet there I was all for it. Easy to see furniture store Big Bronco and Janey's is behind it. Very good coffee and I'll come back to try the food.  Comfortable place to just hang out."}
{"text":"Janey's is a casual cafe/bar/coffee house/restaurant. They have a great atmosphere, live music and indoor or outdoor seating.  The employees are attentive and friendly.  They offer a wide variety or breakfast, lunch, dinner and appetizer items.  All the food we have tried is very good!  Excellent Cave Creek vibe!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a quick salad and iced tea, followed by warm coffee cake! I just came in to use the free wi-fi, and got a Janey's salad and iced tea. The salad was very fresh, used green lettuce, vegetables and sunflower seeds. Enjoyed it so much I sat and worked for a while longer, then ordered hibiscus iced tea and coffee cake. The coffee cake was gently warmed, and served with a luscious side of fresh fruits - a very nice surprise. The hibiscus tea was brewed fresh, and quickly. 
This would be a very nice place to come in the evening, and try some of the interesting wines or beers, sit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful desert just outside."}
{"text":"Got breakfast burrito and breakfast sandwich was fantastic!!!! Highly recommend trying it out!!"}
{"text":"Great place food is awesome .. Good coffee and large beer and wine selections 
Food is awesome. I get the Ruben quite often"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this little gem as we are looking for C4 - which has apparently closed its doors.  Service was friendly, coffee was good and the view/patio was out of this world!  Hope to be back again soon..."}
{"text":"Experience the restaurant for the very first time due to a birthday party. Sat outside for several hours enjoying appetizers , and drinks. The occasion was a 50th birthday party which meant the service was going in all different directions very very accommodating for the 20-plus people we had outside on the patio. The food range from chicken salad wraps to breakfast burritos. I had the pleasure of enjoying the Reuben sandwich for which they added hatch chile which gave an incredible flavor. My wife enjoyed the chicken Caesar wrap and many Sangria's that had sensational  blueberries blackberries and strawberries, all I can say they were just awesome!!! Some of us ended up inside relaxing an oversized leather chairs enjoying the Charming bar atmosphere. I would highly recommend to all to enjoy this experience and asked for my new friend Julian to take care of you!!"}
{"text":"I have only been here once. But definitely plan to come back again. Coffee was very good. The place was very relaxing. Love the patio tables. Great place to hang out and read a book. Staff was super friendly. PB&J was yummy and served with fresh delicious fruit. mmmmm yummm!"}
{"text":"Very cool place. Had live music on a Saturday morning. Seems like it would be fun at nigh too. Staff was friendly. Lots of locals frequent here."}
{"text":"Very pleasant and at least during the day quiet coffee place, which from my experience is rare."}
{"text":"This place is okay, but nothing special. They have a great atmosphere going but should really just invest in an actual cook because it is very obvious the children bussers make the food, and not even in an actual kitchen. How do I know this... you can see in the kitchen and back dishwasher area. I love the manager who is always friendly, but I just really wish they would get a cook and pave the patio."}
{"text":"Janey's is simply the best. We walked in and felt like we could relax here all day - and then we did. The coffee drinks are all delicious not to mention all the beers on tap. We enjoyed personalizing our oatmeal and yogurt at breakfast and later our paninis from the amazing lists of options. Everything is fresh and made to order.   The decor is very authentic Cave Creek.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great service and great coffee. Today they were testing a potential new item, a green chili breakfast burrito and I had the pleasure of being a tester. One word, Fantastic! 
Please put them on the menu, please."}
{"text":"Love coming here on a weekday morning for a coffee and breakfast sandwich or pastry.  Service is great, small, quaint and comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times - Great outdoor seating - Generally Quiet, Food service very pleasant - a little slow for service but everything is made to order.  Priced $8-$13  ish for sandwich or salad -"}
{"text":"Was my daily (and sometimes twice daily) fix for a year or more. Can't ever get enough of this place- everything is delicious. The coffee and espresso are rich and toasty, the lattes are creamy and sweet, and the chai is the absolute best stuff in town. The staff is super friendly, they discount my drinks frequently and occasionally, it's on the house. Pays to be a regular, I suppose. 

My favorite coffee place in Cave Creek or Scottsdale. Worth the trip, every time."}
{"text":"Service is bad, very bad. When you walk in they look at you like they want to chase you out. I said hello to the server, the reply was \"be with you in a minute\", after 10 minutes he proceeded to take another customers order who just walked in the door (obviously a regular) then went back to ignoring me. It was obvious he didn't want to be there, and therefore neither do I.  I am not asking for royal service but that was blatant  discourtesy.  The cafe across the street is better choice!"}
{"text":"Too bad ...beautiful
morning, meeting friends, great seating area outdoors and so disappointing...
Took 45 minutes for cold food no flavor and the bell pepper and mushrooms that we thought would be cooked in the eggs were raw and thrown on top. 
Waitress was sorry very apologetic and  refunded for food. Was a bummer because it could've been great with just a cooking staff."}
{"text":"Saw Big Pete Pearson at Janey's in Cave Creek on Friday night. Really nice setting, great wine, beer and coffee/tea selections. Their patio is really beautiful - you are sitting in the desert with huge boulders watching a band and enjoying our cool nights with a couple of outdoor fires. Very comfortable, reasonable cover for the quality of the band. Big Pete was really fun to listen to. We will be back soon and bring our friends and family!"}
{"text":"Great beer, great coffee, great food, cool people, great music (live & streaming). What could be better! So glad I found this place, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is at a really lovely location in Cave Creek. They have inside and outside tables. The coffees are great, really tasty and the perfect strength. The staff is very nice and you feel home as soon as you enter. I would recommend the Frozen Dirty Chai, on the secret Menu. ;-) love this place."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks on the patio and set back far enough from all the commotion. 40+ crowd which is a great change of pace. Great beer selection. Only flaw was the charcuterie plate w cheese wasn't that great. Would prefer smaller plate and better quality. Would highly suggest a visit. Live music is above average and you can actually hear yourself talking."}
{"text":"Janey's was a great find for lunch. Wonderful, comfortable, unique atmosphere; friendly hosts; and tasty eats! We had a Janey's Famous Sandwich (aka build it your way) and a Turkey Waldorf Salad. Both were excellent and fresh tasting."}
{"text":"A nice place to catch a little music on the patio."}
{"text":"Love the outdoor seating and live music. 
5 stars for the atmosphere. 3 stars for the food and service.
Asked for decaf herbal tea options but was told they weren't sure which teas were decaf. What the heck? The manager/owner came out and gave me a decaf option after I stated I didn't want to order unless I know if the tea was decaf. My tea was weak and not steeped long enough. They used leaf leaves instead of bags. I did like that. 
Ordered the oatmeal with fruit and nuts. It was ok. Super hungry after hiking and waiting so long for the food. I did eat it all. The bowl they served my oatmeal in had 2 large chips in it which I found extremely disturbing. 
Service was ok though they weren't very friendly at all. Nobody was. 
My husband ordered a breakfast burrito and it took 30 minutes before it was served. 
Nice for atmosphere but skip the food ;-("}
{"text":"Small place, few breakfast choices but good and delicious I had breakfast sandwich simple but made right way no grress at all, satisfying Angela had oatmeal with fruits that she also enjoind, it not fancy at all place, but I really enjoyed patio"}
{"text":"What a great atmosphere! Fun and cozy at the same time! Great staff, very helpful, beers suggested were wonderful."}
{"text":"Cool, laid back breakfast place (and bar with music later in the day) with The Best oatmeal I've had.  The oatmeal itself was tasty, but it also had blueberries, almonds, pecans, cranberries, strawberries and bananas loaded on it.  Extremely good!  Add great service and coffee to the mix and you have a real hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"All about the music for me here. Beer and wine fine...breakfast is worthwhile ...but sitting outside on warm evening listening to live bands is such a pleasure!"}
{"text":"Our favorite quiet spot in Cave Creek. Don't tell to many people about it. We don't want it to get too crowded.

Nice healthy menu and service with a smile. I have been very pleased with my food on each of my 5 trips here."}
{"text":"Very nice surroundings, great dry soy cappuccino."}
{"text":"This place was adorable.  They have live music every day, and pretty good bands too, but unfortunately we only came by after paddle boarding nearby for a beer and some snacks.  Will definitely need to return when in AZ again!  I had THE yummiest beer--the \"Hibiscus Pale Ale\" by the SanTan Brewing Company--and it was a lovely deep pink shade!  One of the first pink beers I have ever had, and so so good.  The family also got the Veggie Board and we chatted with the girl behind the bar.  She was so lovely to talk to and gave us a ton of things to do in the area.  Overall, very happy with this cute and cozy dive spot."}
{"text":"Parking is extremely limited. When I tried to give feedback to the owner, he didn't care to listen to me. \"If you don't like it, go somewhere else.\" So, I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for food, live music, and fun! I have sang, dined, and hosted events here. As a hypnotherapist here in Cave Creek it's nice having great local venues."}
{"text":"Stopped for a coffee and their was a $10 cover per person at a coffee house! There was a band playing outside. Sounded ok i guess. Just didn't feel like spending $20 just to walk thru the door."}
{"text":"I love Janey's. The service is always friendly and it has a great vibe. It's a great place to bring my computer and camp out for a while doing work that would be far less fun without this spot. Every time I'm in town I come here, and it makes me forget that I'm not a local."}
{"text":"Strong coffee with free refills, incredibly friendly staff, good breakfast and a really cool, comfy environment. This is a great place to relax and sip coffee.

I got the breakfast sandwich with bacon, egg and horseradish cheddar on sourdough. It was tasty and the horseradish cheddar gave it a nice kick. I tried my brother's oatmeal and it was among the best I've had.

Looks like a cool bar with craft beer and there's live music on weekends which I'd like to checkout. Overall a really cool place in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Stop what you're doing and go get a breakfast burrito from here ASAP- large enough to split and the homemade salsas are delicious!! The coffee is also great and the atmosphere is really neat."}
{"text":"Since discovering this place a few months ago, we have visited multiple times. What a gem in the heart of Cave Creek. I have and will continue recommending to visitors as it definitely beats your chain places. We have only gone for coffee (which is delicious) and their yummy pastries. They have a full bar and offer small plates and live music most days/nights. Very accommodating for kids. Adorable patio for when the weather cools down. The owner is usually there - super nice guy! This place is GREAT!"}
{"text":"Setting:  Spent the day with the neighbors and found this gem while walking around the area.

Ambiance:  Great view of the Sonoran desert while sitting on the patio.  The inside is very relaxing with comfortable seating and a surprising bar.  We ended up staying for a couple hours losing track of time with only ordering drinks.  The mood and feel is somewhere you want to shut your mind off for a while.  I would highly recommend for hanging with friends, flying solo, or even getting work done.

Food/Menu:  We only ordered drinks on tap while the ladies had smoothies.  Everything was great with no complaints.

Service:  Excellent service with no complaints!

Overall:  Small businesses thrive on repeat customers.  Whenever we are in the area, we will be sure to stop by and relax for a couple hours."}
{"text":"We were driving thru Cave Creek on 4th of July..just for the heck of it.  Came upon Janeys..and it was really neat.  Great atmosphere..and we eventually want to see live music.  My husband had beer..I had wine.  My only complaint is that wines are pricey.  Would be nice to have a chardonnay under 8 dollars."}
{"text":"I like this place, it has a nice setting and a great vibe. I went there on a Friday and they had a great blues band and the place had a lot of energy. They have a couple tasty beers on tap, my only complaint would be slow service."}
{"text":"Wonderful coffee and tea, delicious foods, a comfortable atmosphere, and friendly people! It's a great spot to hang out with friends, grab a quick cup of coffee, eat lunch/dinner alone or with friends, and/or work on your laptop. It's hard to find an environment where you drink delicious coffee/chai all day, eat a delicious lunch, then meet friends for a glass of wine and dinner over live music. I can't recommend Janey's enough!"}
{"text":"Left a prior disappointed service review and to my surprise the new owner responded and extended a nice offer for me to return as the service has been much improved with the new owner. Looking forward to returning to the wonderful atsmophere it offers."}
{"text":"This was our first time to stay in Cave Creek. I did my research and saw the good comments regarding Janey's. It is set back in off the street, so you need to watch for it. Parking is good, staff very friendly, the iced latte and regular coffee were good. They have a huge patio to relax outside with rocks, trees and 10 heaters. We weren't disappointed."}
{"text":"Janet's is absolutely adorable. The inside ambiance is hip, fresh, and somewhat rustic. There is a patio where you can sit outside and enjoy views of Black Mountain and a flush of cacti. Every weekend there is live music. 

I tried the loaded oatmeal-it was divine. You can choose what you want on it. This selection includes fruit, berries, nuts, granola, and a number of sweeteners. I would highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Great locally owned coffee shop and has evolved over the last four years I've been going here into a cool music venue. Music from local artists every night of the week. Wine tastings on Wednesday nights.  Pub boards are awesome, coffee is great, and they have a full bar. 

By far my favorite spot to hang out in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Nice place in cave creek area. nice outdoor and live music."}
{"text":"This is our favorite spot in Cave Creek! This is a home away from home.  If you are in the area stop by for a beer and sandwich."}
{"text":"There are a remarkable number of indie coffeehouses in Cave Creek/Carefree for such a small area, but Janey's is hands down my absolute favorite. The coffee is superb - beans are supplied by The Roastery of Cave Creek - and always hand-crafted perfectly to your specifications. The food is delish, always fresh and made when you order, not before. They have a lovely, well-edited wine selection, including a Riesling I was pleasantly surprised to also see offered at Zinc Bistro, and some great beer on tap. Stop by Thursday nights for local music, or weekend mornings to enjoy chats with the locals around the outdoor fire (in the winter, of course!).

It is important to me to spend my money in locally-owned, family-operated business whenever possible, and that's another reason why I love this place. It is truly a family labor of love - all of them work here, and you'll see them all circle through if you sit there long enough. You're apt to be there all day if you sink into one of the overstuffed leather armchairs... Free wifi so you can work if you're so inclined.

The highlight of Janey's, other than the great coffee, food and bar, are their two affable Afghan hounds, Moses and Ghandi. While some people come by just to play with the dogs, I suggest you at least enjoy a cup of coffee while you do so : ) Bring your own pooch too - Janey's patio is a great doggy hangout!

Yoga Breeze was doing a full moon yoga session on the patio in warmer weather, and hopefully that will resume when this Arctic freeze we're experiencing ends.

And by the way, if you can't handle a little dust on your car a la the dude from Glendale below, you probably shouldn't be coming to Cave Creek. But I think if dirt parking lots don't bother the owners of the multi-million dollar homes in town with vehicles to match, you could probably let it slide, too. If not, there's a $5 car wash up the road."}
{"text":"This place is under different ownership from when we came 3yrs ago. They have made it even better than it already was. The live music every night is fantastic. And the Dirty Chai with Coconut Milk was the BEST I've ever had in my life. I wish that I lived locally (one day)"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Best oatmeal I've ever had. Owner is a super guy. Going back tonight to check out the live music. Full service bar. Great Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Live Music, coffee, yummy food Saturday morning!! Three  separate musicians  took the patio and played guitar with a saguaro cover hillside as a backdrop. Excellent variety of music. Very causal friendly environment."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop! Although their chai lattes need a little work, they used to be amazing but have gone down hill lately... other than that v good! and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here. I came for a show. The local band, Fillabusta, performed there.

Good News: 
The band was great! 
The atmosphere is a cool - vibe mix of Coffeehouse/bar/restaraunt, the bathrooms are clean, stocked, & nice. 
The location is beautiful.

Bad news:
Slightly understaffed for a busy Friday night. No waitresses outside, you have to go to the bar to order/get refills... 
Customer Service lacking. The girls are so busy they can't focus on a good customer experience.
The pizza was terrible. Too much bad quality cheese, doughy & chewy yet still burned on the bottom.
Also, no plates or silverware for your pizza, you're at a bar, not a restaurant...wait? Isn't this a ...
Which is it?"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic pace to have some drinks, relax and listen to music. I do wish they had a better food selection. I've not tried the coffee, but I love the wine and beer. We would come more if there was more of a dining option. I don't think they have a kitchen.....just a microwave."}
{"text":"I have not had the pleasure of trying any of their coffees, but ALL of the breakfast sandwiches are excellent and they come with fresh fruit!

If you're looking for a coffee and excellent breakfast sandwich in the morning, Janie's is the best in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Coffee shop w dozen beers on tap.  Great for the coffee drinking Harley contingent."}
{"text":"We make it a necessity to visit Janey's every time we're in the area.  The chai the best, especially when enjoyed outside on the patio, perfectly located with an awesome view."}
{"text":"Enjoying a great L Mother's Day Cavecreek. A Musician is setting up to play his guitar's. Wha great way to spend the afternoon relaxing in the desert."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some breakfast before driving back to Cali. 
I had a breakfast sandwich. You choose how you want your sandwich by filling out this sheet. They offer various breads and cheeses. For my sandwich, I chose multigrain bread with horseradish cheddar cheese and ham, bacon and egg. Great sandwich. Comes with a small side of fruit. The horseradish cheddar really adds a kick. 
For drinks, I had a mimosa and an iced latte. Love the mimosa. Good pours. The iced latte was okay. I probably should've gotten a flavored one so it would be better. 

Overall, it's a great place to have some drinks and a light meal. Sandwiches. Salads. Dessert. Coffee. Wine. Beer.
They also offer live music some nights. Love the rustic decor. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped by Janie's for breakfast after a local hike. I had lunch there previously. I asked if they had gluten free bread and was told no, but they did have corn tortillas. Perfect, I ordered eggs with the corn tortillas, but when it was delivered to the table the tortillas were wheat. The cook came out and stated rather tersely that they don't have corn tortillas. Maybe someone should tell the staff that people who request something they think may be unusual, may have a health issue.  Fortunately, I caught the problem before I had a bad reaction to it. 
I'll never be back."}
{"text":"This place is a gem in Cave Creek, obviously great coffee but also full bar and tasty, quality food. Live music often with a great patio to hang on. Owners and employees are friendly and cool - check it out!"}
{"text":"Great find. Great ambience but..really meager pour on martinis. I ordered their well vodka for  a martini and it was a 3oz pour, which is pretty small.It was $7. At nearby Venues in carefree, during Happy Hour, their 6 oz. martini to the brim with the Well vodka is $7. I am very eager to go back as their wine is good and reasonably priced but since I am a martini drinker, I may not go back. A shame."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Cave Creek for coffee or an after dinner drink.  The patio is amazing for Arizona mornings and at night the music is great to unwind after a long day.
I love their selection of drinks but I appreciate their almond milk the most.  Hard to find almond milk at most coffee shops.  My favorite breakfast is their amazing bowl of oatmeal loaded with berries, bananas, nuts and seeds.  An amazing meal to start the day.

After dinner drinks are great with their full bar selection of liquor and coffee drinks.  Cannot wait to go this week."}
{"text":"I simply cannot say enough good things about this place!

Great atmosphere inside or outside. Staff is super friendly and accommodating. 

This is a great place to go whether you're looking for a great cup of coffee and something for breakfast, or afternoon/evening cocktail and meal."}
{"text":"(written by susan) We went there for the blueberry waffles (friends said they were great!) - we were not disappointed....this is now on our list of places to go when we visit Cave Creek. Hubby also likes to come in early in the morning for coffee with friends - it is a great gathering place. Friendly staff and good service. I would recommend."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite coffee shop.  They also have a bar and great music in the evenings and on weekends.  The patio is nice, but it's cozy inside too during a rare AZ thunderstorm."}
{"text":"It's a really nice spot in Cave creek if you like Coffee, wine or good craft beer on tap. Make sure to stop in to this little gem."}
{"text":"Fantastic food wonderful outdoor seating wireless and good tea.  What more do you want. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This is the best little coffee shop in Cave Creek with beautiful views and animal friendly! Thanks for having @freddiethepig and me here this morning;)"}
{"text":"Second time I've come here and I live all the way up in Bend Oregon!!!

Love this place, super friendly staff, delicious food, lovely atmosphere and very affordable!

I'll be coming back anytime I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is a great coffee shop in cave creek! We came here on a Friday morning and there were only a few people here. There were cute, comfy armchairs to sit in, which I loved! The place is very cute and eclectic. Their bar looked like it had a good selection of craft beer, but we came for coffee! I ordered a vanilla iced latte and it was very good. It wasn't super sweet and had a nice flavor. We shared a Cobb salad and a roast beef sandwich. Everything was very fresh and yummy! The roast beef was high quality. It came with a side of fresh fruit! The owner was super nice! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Had a great time with friends.  Great outside area.  Listened to a very good Blues band.  Good selection of Micro brews and wine.  The owner and staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a bite to eat after hearing this was a local favorite.  The service was a bit on the slow side, although friendly.  The salad was disappointing and the winded kicked up and started blowing dust and debris.  The food was left unfinished and I went elsewhere for lunch.  Was it just the salad and an off day?   What did I miss?"}
{"text":"We have lived here for years and have never tried Janey's, it just doesn't look like much from the outside to be honest. We went the night the
Sugar Thieves were playing and there was a $10 cover, but Mark let us in and we told him if we stayed for the band we would pay. We STAYED for the band. Lovely customers and staff, and good drinks. We did not eat (already dined at another location) but we will be back (the pizzas looked great!) I think we have been missing out, and plan to become regulars!"}
{"text":"I stopped here at 6:30 AM so I was the only one there while I had my coffee and pastry. Such a pleasant environment. Strong coffee and plenty of seating inside and out. If I found myself in the area for an extended period of time, I'd visit often."}
{"text":"This place is great!! I love coffee, but I'm also super picky about coffee, so when I first came to this place I was a little nervous because I thought they wouldn't make the coffee the way I like it. But they did! It was amazing! I got an iced mocha and my friend got an iced chai and both were delicious! It's so good that on several occasions I have gone completely out of my way (driving 30 minutes out of the way) to go get a cup of coffee"}
{"text":"Great little place. The people are friendly and the food was great. Sat outside for breakfast. The loaded oatmeal was awesome. Unfortunately I left my back pack there and did not realize it until we were in Sedona. I called and they had it and held it till that night when I could pick it up. Great place. I would go back! Thank you"}
{"text":"This place is so quaint and cute. I came in the morning, around 9, and it's slow but very nice atmosphere. I ordered the ice dirty chai at the recommendation of a friend, and I'm so happy that I did. It's got a really strong coffee and chai flavor, and I love that they use the powdered chai instead of the liquid! Boosts the chai flavor for sure. 
I also ordered a cherry danish \"for here\", and they served it to me with an array of fruits on the side as well, which I wasn't expecting. It was a pleasant surprise, and the cherry danish was amazing as well! 
Overall a great place, and I hear they have an awesome night life, too. Can't wait to come back sometime soon to see what the night life is like!"}
{"text":"We visited this establishment on a Wed night  (June, 2014).  Found a large wine selection but the bartender was not a good communicator and lacked enthusiasm for what he does.  He did let us sample our choice tho at our request before making our purchase.  Settled for the Red Sangria and ordered the Pub Board.  Neither were all that good especially the Pub Board, very disappointed from what I had seen there earlier and prices were high.  After 2 glasses of wine and the Pub Board it cost $30.00 which I thought was very expensive.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Dusty, dirty..ick! Don't wear white, that's for sure. They need to pave the patio and wipe the tables indoors. Fairly expensive as well. They will only give you one refill on sodas..who does that in AZ..get real!"}
{"text":"Nice little place tucked among saguaro cacti.  Yummy Belgian waffle adorned with fresh fruit.  Cappuccinos rounded out the breakfast nicely, too.  They have live music at reasonable times, too!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good cup of java in the AM!  Loved the \"crawl out from under your rock and greet the sun\" atmosphere.  It is casual desert living at its finest.  Good service and people."}
{"text":"Definitely my go to place after work! Great beer, wine and spirit options and awesome staff. Also have live music which is always changing. Almost every night of the week they have something going on so its always interesting to come by. I would highly recommend if you are ever in the cave creek area."}
{"text":"Great spot for food, drinks, and entertainment. The staff is great and its a cozy spot for just chilling"}
{"text":"I stopped here while visiting Cave Creek and found it to be a very nice place, it's a coffeehouse but they sell spirits too. I only had coffee but found that the inside and especially the outside seating options were nicely appointed. Outside was tranquil and bordered by saguaros and I could see jack rabbits and birds having a jolly time in the Sonoran brush."}
{"text":"I just stopped in for lunch and ordered a BLTA with Iced coffee.. Friendly professional service, drink was perfect! Sandwich was delicious! I like the payment options especially being able to select the standard tip percentage or custom tip. Thank you for a wonderful experience, definitely will be back with friends."}
{"text":"Cool, eclectic coffee shop in the heart of Cave Creek. The have a large outdoor seating area with pretty good views.  Not strictly a coffee shop, they have breakfast and sandwiches and such, but they also have live music most nights, and they're a full service bar! Trust me get the oatmeal, it's the bomb, and it's probably good for you.  I love Janey's,  it's just a cool, quaint, place to chill, what ever time of day you drop by."}
{"text":"Love this place. We come here for coffee or breakfast when the weather is nice. Just came for wine and to listen to music and it's great."}
{"text":"Been a regular here for years. The dirty iced chai, wonderful staff and owner, and the awesome live bands make for an incredible little coffee shop in Cave Creek. The atmosphere is truly unique and one of a kind."}
{"text":"This is my favorite favorite favorite place to eat, drink, read & work in Cave Creek. There is always an awesome band on the weekends. I love the Sunday afternoon music; there is a either a soloist or a duo strumming a guitar and singing - ahhh just perfect. I highly recommend this gem. Oh and their 'Wine Wednesdays' are an awesomely unpretentious way to expand your knowledge of that delectable drink.  Overall this place just has a wonderful vibe."}
{"text":"I'm from California but have been all over the US to different cool little bars. My dad lives in Cave Creek and i have been to a lot of places in the area. Best beer selection I've seen so far and a really great atmosphere with live music on the Friday night I went there. My new favorite night spot when I come o"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite relaxing late night after I done with my business. All bans playing here so cool, different kind of music. I am normally NOT a fan of Decaf Coffee, but here IS the best Decaf Late fresh and YUMMy...ambiance at night at the Desert,under full moon have you ever imagine hangout with your best friends:))
Love this place."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere here at Janey's. If you want drinks and live music, this place is great. Nice outside seating and some good options.

Stay away from the food at all costs! Really terrible."}
{"text":"We love this venue.  Its a little treasure in Cave Creek.  Don't let the \"Coffeehouse\" sign fool you.  They have a large selection of beer and wine.  The patio is amazing too."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go enjoy a margarita. The owner makes the best margarita. The food is very good too. Always meet nice people. Enjoying a sandwich and beer. One of my favorite local spots. I feel very comfortable eating alone. The breeze that gently comes through the rooms is fantastic. The patio is a great spot to listen to music and enjoy the beautiful AZ sky."}
{"text":"OK THIS IS LONG OVERDUE. We first visited with friends from the San Francisco area while showing them the area. We are new to Arizona (1 year) moved from the SF area and have visited Cave Creek several times before finding this GREAT lunch spot. Great sandwiches, attentive service and the bartender (owner) is wonderful. The outdoor area is quiet and far enough off the main road to make the time spent very enjoyable. AGAIN THIS IS THE REVIEW PROMISED MANY MONTHS AGO (our friends goofed). Keep up doing what you are doing and see ya next trip up your way. Bob/Vets"}
{"text":"A good friend brought me here about a year ago to have breakfast while out on a ride This place is situated off of the road behind a furniture shop so keep an eye out as it is not visible from the street. The decor is very industrial, lots of steel and iron work. There is limited seating inside but a ton of space to sit outside and enjoy the live music and fresh air.

Now I've been here a handful of times, with friends, my kids and date night and I can tell you that every single time it's been somewhat a disappointment. This place has all of the makings to be such a great restaraunt/bar, but it desperately lacks consistency and overall management. 

Example 1: On almost every single visit the person taking orders has no clue what it is they serve or how to work the point of sale system. Takes so long to get a coffee or a food order placed. 

Example 2: We sat around today for a simple breakfast buritto... 30 minutes...in the meantime they brought the wrong coffee orders and had to make them over again. When we finally got our breakfast , I noticed something very different about the burrito. All of the vegetables were completely cold and raw... Never seen that before and inconsistent from past visits.

Example 3:  In total there are about 4-5 people that work the breakfast hours. I've never really seen this place to full capacity and am puzzled as to why the employees dont come out from behind the counter to check in on customers , bus tables or upsell on food and drinks. I mean, the customer makes there own order, the customer seats themselves, the customer picks up their own order, the customer has to get up and get their own knives, forks etc.

I really hate to be so hard on the place, but it could be so much better. I'm so laid back too and hate say anything negative about a business in my town , but I really hope things change for the better so I can change my rating."}
{"text":"What a very cool, quaint location. It's off the road so you could pass it. Nice indoor/outdoor seating and full bar with two serving sides. Good selection of beers (hopefully rotating handles) and wines.

I only had a cappuccino today- no food, but their menu looks filling. A bit expensive but it is a small business. The capp was too hot initially so I waited approx five minutes to enjoy.

The barista asked what kind of mocha I would like in my capp, which I never been asked before. Guess I should've asked what the options were. :-)

I'd like to come back to hear the live music they have throughout the week, and to try the food. 

Nice social place overall."}
{"text":"I have been here about six times, and now that we own a house close by, it is some where we visit every time we come to Scottsdale.  The views of the saguaros are amazing from the outdoor seating!  I mean amazing!  I believe it is a family that owns the place, and the mom (by the way gorgeous) and the dad and daughter (also gorgeous) run it like a family business.  I felt welcome, comfortable and the food and drinks are great.  I have only enjoyed breakfast and lunch thus far, but hope to enjoy an evening with music at some point."}
{"text":"We simply love this place.  Great food, friendly atmosphere and staff that aim to please.  The patio is a nice place to hang out and enjoy coffee, food or even a drink.  Dog friendly too.  I keep on coming back."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Build your own yogurt, oatmeal and breakfast sandwiches -- so good. Delicious drinks (the chai was really tasty). Great place to post up and read a good book. Very friendly and personable staff."}
{"text":"Great experience! Was looking for breakfast after a Saturday morning hike. Read rave Yelp reviews and remembered friend likes this place on weekend evenings. Great casual coffee cafe with live music on the patio. So happy to have found this gem. Warm,friendly staff. English muffin breakfast sandwich was on small side. Get breakfast burrito if looking for bulk. Relaxing,happy,quality cafe."}
{"text":"Have to take a moment to reflect on the evening last night at Janey's.  Found the location in my search to see Chuck Hall.  A quick look at yelp indicated all the strengths I look for - excellent coffee, open patio, light fare, and full bar - combined with the musical styling of one of my favorite local guitar players and we had the makings for a memorable night.

While enroute,  encountered a moderate thunderstorm right over cave creek.  Not sure how are evening might be impacted.  Found the location and arrived as a local yoga class was ending under light rain - nice people.  Met Jake behind the bar who quickly greeted us and helped with food and cocktail choices.   Pub board was great - loved the olives, the warm pretzel and fresh fruit.  Build your own sandwich was fresh and tasty. 

Rain cleared, friends arrived, and blessed with a temperature drop of about 25 degrees, we settled into the patio for drinks, cigars, and fantastic music.  Sitting on the patio with the Sonoran desert backdrop, full moon, ideal weather - I did not want it to end.

Later met Mitch and Sam.  Outstanding hosts.  Sam is an alchemist with the lattes - I believe our group finished off six of them - the two \"spiked\" versions were my favorite.  The coffee was fresh and flavorful and went down like butter.  Mitch and Jake helped out our ambitious crew with a round of tequila shots and provided friendly and gracious service all night.  

This was my first night at Janey's, but it won't be my last.  Looking forward to catching Hans Olsen here the next time he is on the schedule."}
{"text":"We've lived here for over 2 years and recently discovered this quaint place when C4 shut down.  We've been here in the AM and late at night and we love it!  The breakfast food is delish.  You have to try the poptart or their cinnamon bun.  Their hot chocolate is also tasty, and not too sweet.  The prices are very reasonable.  I prefer this place to Starbucks.  In the PM the live music is awesome.  The ambiance is relaxing no matter what time of day you come."}
{"text":"Coziest little bodega I've ever seen. First time here on a Wednesday they're offering half off on pizza, wine tasting and live music. A fine selection of local brew on tap and the staff is wildly friendly. I went with the pizza however they offer most breakfast items even at night. I would highly recommend the vegetarian pizza with pesto, top notch with a homemade taste. I will be back here, it is a treasure."}
{"text":"So good we came back the next day! Vanilla latte was delicious and my americano was rich and smooth! Their breakfast sandwich and burrito we splendidly simple. They use fresh high quality ingredients! Yumm. The seating outside and inside is relaxing with dessert backdrop."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that is a discovery and a hidden gem. Nestled in the crook of a dirt parking lot and the backside of a hill covered with Saguaros. The only hesitation I have is to never share the amazing little secret by writing this review. 

The staff is young, hip and extremely friendly. The coffee is sublime and the food is fresh, simple and delicious. Almost as though you were at a friends house and Mom shipped up something in the kitchen. 

The decor is western rustic with a touch of modern industrial. They play live music on the weekends and at night it transforms into a truly hip local pub. 

I have been coming here for some time now and I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great place breakfast and a coffee. They are a counter service place with friendly staff. The breakfast menu is build-your-own style. Choose from a breakfast sandwich or burrito, a waffle, oatmeal or yogurt parfait. On the scale of fast to delicious, they are on the yummy side. This isn't a place to grab something quick to eat if you are in a rush. Coffee was great. They also have beer on tap and a wine list. It seemed like there were many locals here on the Saturday morning that I visited. Also, they are dog friendly!!"}
{"text":"Great little spot in Cave Creek and a really good alternative to those big bars in town.  It's got a really cool vibe and feel to the place and a good selection of interesting craft beers, which is why we go here.  
The menu is primarily sandwiches, which are good but slightly overpriced.  They have a nice patio and the signs indicate they have an interesting group of entertainers that play here, although we have not been there at night to check it out yet."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  You get a small chart and must tick off the garnishes for your breakfast sandwich or oatmeal.  The food is always good.  The coffee is delicious.  The service is great.  We keep going back for more!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Like others, discovered Janey's while looking for an alternative to C4 (Cave Creek Coffee Company) up the road which has closed.  Only been here once, but based on my limited experience, most of what you read in the other reviews is true.  Great coffee, best \"loaded\" oatmeal where you choose all the add-ons that you want (fruits, nuts, etc.) on a sheet of paper, free Wi-Fi, cozy/relaxed atmosphere, rustic decor, super-friendly service, live music (free on Saturday morning).  Ideal.  What more could you want in a coffe shop?  Oh, ok, there is also a full bar for later in the day..."}
{"text":"So much fun! A coffeehouse, bar and outdoor music venue. The food could use a lift...haven't been for breakfast yet.  They also have different types of entertainment which is refreshing. Wednesdays are wine tastings, live music on Thursday, Friday and Saturday plus yoga and wine one night."}
{"text":"Love this place! A little slice of country and amazing staff. All very personable and make you feel at home. The live music is a nice touch. My favorite place to grab a quick coffee and to also hang out and grab some drinks and food!"}
{"text":"I've been there a few times for breakfast and a few times for drinks. It's a cool joint for live music. The crowd is friendly, very local feel. Terri took my order for a mocha and oatmeal. She took an order before and after mine before any drinks were started. When she called to me that the drink was ready I politely mentioned that I had ordered it iced. She literally ROLLED HER EYES AT ME, said nothing and continued to busy herself. When the iced version was ready she merely held it up and continued her phone conversation. No apology for the delay or a smile to smooth over her rudeness. The oatmeal was delivered by an adorable smiley girl named Tatum. It was as delicious as I recall. The \"plain Jane\" is $6 and comes w four toppings of your choice. I had black and blue berries & almonds and walnuts. The toppings were fresh the portions generous. Terri came to bus our table, said nothing, no smile. I stopped taking it personally when I saw this was her interaction w all the customers. I am sorry if she was just having a bad day. It's a cool joint but I won't rush back."}
{"text":"I'm a local. I love Janey's, great atmosphere, good beer and great staff. Stopped there on Friday night to get a beer and a bite .... Was greeted at the front door with a $10 cover charge .... Really...now this is Cave Creek ! If you can't attract customers with your ambiance, venue, product and service time to make a decision."}
{"text":"This place has a fantastic layout.  With a a huge expansive patio,  and an industrial inspired design. We came for breakfast, and I ordered the burrito with eggs,  bacon,  and all the veggies. The presentation was visually pleasing,  but the overall flavor was pretty average. There was a good helping of veggies and bacon in the tortilla, but the horseradish cheddar was sparse which was disappointing as it was the most distinguishing component of the wrap. I wouldve liked to see some more flavor overall such as more of the cheddar, more spice,  or more of a sassy salsa,  but overall good quality and satisfying. 
The service was fast and friendly,  and the coffee had a nice robust dark flavor. I only wish it would have been balanced out with some citrus notes. I'd come back here again as its a good spot for a leisurely cup of Joe outside. I'd just like to see them step up their wow factor."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place! It's hidden, it's quiet (in the morning), and the people are great. I look forward to coming back at night to check out the live music they have each night!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  Everyone running the place, from the employees to the owner, are very nice and accommodating!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice for breakfast and it never fails; great coffee, great customer service, great food! The staff are super friendly and make great suggestions. I hope to take advantage of their nighttime entertainment, drinks and fare."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere.  Super casual and they really paid attention the details.  Nice outdoor patio area too.  My husbands says the bathrooms are great too!  Very friendly staff and the keep the place very clean!!   I ordered the loaded oatmeal and after eating out a lot lately it was exactly what I needed.  Lots of fresh fruit, nuts, flax seeds.  Very filling.   Husband got the breakfast sandwich on sourdough and swears it is the best breakfast sandwich he has enjoyed in a long time!"}
{"text":"We love Janeys!  We had Janeys Standard Breakfast with mushroom, tomato and spinach scramble with smoked gouda...The fresh fruit was berries...inspired!...They have a rustic outdoor patio and they were playing classic rock over the PA system...We loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Love the vibe and atmosphere! Was sitting outside on the couches and got offered some blankets to use while staying; how nice!! The live music is great and the staff is super nice! Definitely coming back! :)"}
{"text":"This  place is so good. I had the breakfast sandwich and my friend got the oatmeal and fruit.  The owner is very friendly. The hot tea was delicious. The owner Julian Corles is very friendly and kind. The food is fast and yummy. We will be back. The oatmeal is too die for."}
{"text":"Just a great place for breakfast/coffee in the morning, live music and drinks in the evening."}
{"text":"Nice Patio atmosphere, dog friendly and good pizza! 
Was there for a light dinner and a drink with a group of 7 on a Wednesday a week ago and discovered they had a Wine tasting flight on Wednesday's that looked great and we will go back for it one Wednesday. 

Pizza was really good and they have live music most evenings. 

Went back for Breakfast this AM and it was OK, but not to die for. Coffee was meh...... but we were stopping after a hike with the Pup and the dog friendly patio worked for us!!"}
{"text":"Must have caught them on a bad day, because we've had better here. It wasn't crowded, but service was slow. But worse, the food was mediocre at best, as well as overpriced ( even in this area ). I hope they up their game, because we liked their outdoor eating area."}
{"text":"I loved the place, food, drinks, desert, and attendance are perfect. You need come here!!"}
{"text":"Last night was our last visit to Janey's after several other unsuccessful tries. 
Had to pay $5 just to get in for a very mediocre band. No service outside. It is a fight to try to go inside to get drinks, leave your credit card as hostage. Back in to order terrible food & wait on yourself. The Rubin had zero meat on it! Took it back & they said they had new help in the kitchen. Well, how about someone checking the orders as they go out??  They were very rude about it. The Cobb salad was awful with what looked like yesterday's scrambled eggs sprinkled over the top!  The pizza was a total joke with mainly crust & a few sprinkles of veggies. 
I could have stayed home & had far better service, food & entertainment. 
This place is a joke. 
If you don't mind waiting on yourself, paying too much, poor food, & trying to pay to leave then this just might be the place for you!!
There are far better options in Cave creek than this place. 
Don't worry. We won't be back!!!"}
{"text":"Why I'd go back: to grab a coffee and study or sit outside and enjoy a beer with a friend

Great place to go if you want to sit and read a book during the day and enjoy some coffee or grab an Arizona brewed Four Peaks beer with a friend.  Nestled back off of Cave Creek Road, the atmosphere is low key and inviting.  

The only thing I tried here food-wise was a turkey panini that was good.  Not amazing but for the price and my hungry stomach it filled the need.

One of the last things worth noting are the friendly and genuine staff.  You do not feel rushed and their interested in talking it up a bit if not helping another customer."}
{"text":"To be fair, my wife and I came to Janey's and only ordered an americano and a latte both of which were just ok. It's seemed like a pretty cool environment.Old time bar look on the inside and lots of outdoor seating. Everyone was very friendly. It just seemed a little pricey. It wasn't a bad experience, just not an experience that left me wanting to come back for more."}
{"text":"It's hard to review this place based on one visit, but it seems pretty cool.  The prices were definitely higher than I prefer, but I guess they must be able to get away with it.  I had a coffee and a sandwich and chips, I think it was like $15 or something.  The building is pretty cool, it has some really comfy chairs, and a few hightop tables, and then a huge outdoor area where I'm told they have live music.  I'd really like to come back at night and hear some music."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in cave creek. It's a bit hard to see from the street but there is a sign with an arrow. Parking is on dirt road. 
We were there for a music venue so it was a crowded night with lots of people drinking. Although it's a coffee house, they have full bar with lots of food options. We chose to share a quesadillas which came with salsa and sour cream. The veggies weren't grilled; they were chopped raw veggies and it was very refreshing in the quesadillas. It had lots of flavor.  Highly recommend. 
Although I didn't get to try any of their coffee or breakfast entrees, I will be back."}
{"text":"It's set back from the road, so watch for the wooden marquee sign.

The place is cozy inside and equally relaxing outside. Cushy chairs, secluded nooks, and service counter to be right up front with the action. Free Wi-Fi is bonus and the signal reaches to the patio.  

Here's the best part: they serve coffee AND wine!

Nice place for a quiet moment or to share laughs with friends."}
{"text":"Cute place. Have been a few times. Can bring your dog, have dinner & listen to good music for"}
{"text":"Food is great and so is atmosphere and live music but the wait staff need to get off their butts and do some work I had to get up to get my drinks and order my food and get my bill and then they had me an iPad with a minimum of 20% tip on it . Wait staff need to get off their phones and do some actual work."}
{"text":"Cute place, nice decor, great bathrooms, coffee is alright too.  Nice staff.  Dirt parking though, and I get that it's Cave Creek but still, some of us like to have clean cars.  This is a necessary stop on a trip up to Cave Creek."}
