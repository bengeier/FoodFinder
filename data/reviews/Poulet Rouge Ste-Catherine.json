{"text":"Had a greasy food craving at 11pm. We stumbled upon this place. We ordered the poutine with chicken by using the Casa deal app. It cost us around 10$ included tax. You have the choice of adding 2 toppings on your poutine. The server recommended us the corns and sweet onions. They served a pretty good portion. We shared. Really good, the chicken was tender and they grilled them fresh in front of you. I was so glad i got to try this new place. Thank you for satisfying my cravings :)"}
{"text":"This is a new place that just opened on Ste-Catherine right next to Concordia. You first choose your type of dish and I got the poutine then you choose your flavour and I got spicy. The service was good and students get a 10% discount. What's good is that you get to add as many toppings as you want to your dish which makes it even better. The grilled chicken was really good, the fries can be crispier in my opinion but overall the taste of the poutine was really good. There's also some seating too. Overall it is a good place in a great location and I'll come back to try something else."}
{"text":"Tried out their poutine and chicken bowls with some friends the other day, and it was delicious!! The BBQ fusion flavour is a go-to if you don't know which flavour to choose. For around 10$, you get a good portion of chicken and depending on what dish you get, you can choose 2 or more toppings and sauce. 

The place is clean and sleek, the staff are super friendly and the food is good and worth the price."}
{"text":"Ordered this for delivery to our hotel room late night. Wow!! Yummmm!! The chicken dish was delicious. They cater towards a healthier meal and they deliver. You would think healthy would decrease taste to some extent but not this place. Their dish was absolutely delicious!!"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Clean little fast food spot near Concordia. Perfect for students.

FOOD: The food was delicious, especially for a fast food spot. Another plus side is that this is considered to be a \"healthier\" option in terms of fast foods. I had the Rouge bowl with rice and spicy chicken and it was quite good. I will definitely be coming back here when I'm in the area and need a quick bite.

PRICE: Prices are very affordable. Average price is about 10$. Quality is pretty good and taste as well. You definitely get a bang for your buck here.

SERVICE: The staff was friendly. When I told them about a \"bloody\" chicken piece that I had, they were very accommodating and were happy to replace it with 2 additional pieces."}
