{"text":"We were very pleased with our first dining experience at this community diner. We arrived about 315 which is past  the 3pm deadline for certain menu options. The waitress confirmed we were good to order from that selection regardless which was a nice surprise. My husband had the roasted chicken with au jus, green beans and potato gratin. I had the roasted beet, kale and goat cheese wrap. We both loved our meals and found our server Ashleigh attentive and pleasant. Only a 12 minute drive from our home so we will certainly be back! I definitely recommend if you're looking for a low-key dining experience but creative and yummy food !"}
{"text":"Food: 9/10 Atmosphere: 9/10 Service: 4/10  Been here more than once, the food is great and the service has been great in the past however our visit today was disappointing. The server was unpleasant and projecting her grouchiness unto us during our meal. For example, she brought the wrong dish for one of our group and upon bringing it to her attention, she said \"well, that's what you ordered\". In this case, we knew she had brought the wrong dish but even if the customer was wrong, you don't speak to the customer like that. I would give them another chance and avoid being seated in this server's area.   Summary: a grouchy server ruined an otherwise very nice experience."}
{"text":"I have been to Hot Rocks numerous times, for date nights, nights out with the girls and for New Years celebrations with my beau.  The food has been good each time I've come (the Gnocchi dish is awesome) and my beau has never complained of the food either but I've probably enjoyed it more than he did.  But each and every time we've been to Hot Rocks, we've left complaining about the service!  The wait staff are very rude, have bad attitudes and have zero customer service skills.  They are not interested in even pretending they actually give a damn or putting any effort into being friendly or making the experience a pleasant one.  This is the kind of thing that just ruins a nice evening out.  One evening while I was out for a few drinks with some friends, my friend ordered nachos which were served to her a little on the dark side (any longer and they would have been black).  She requested a new plate but the second set came out just as dark.  On the third try they finally came out the way they should have originally served them.  My friend was in no way rude, she simply did not want to pay for or eat burnt nachos.  (Instead she sat there with nothing in front of her while everyone else ate). The waitress could have pleasantly apologized or brought her something for the inconvenience or adjusted the bill, but we got nothing but attitude, irritated glares and a little bit of huffing from the server as she walked away.  Body language speaks volumes.  Another night my beau and I were out for a New Years dinner for two. Although I understand New Years is busy, and you can accept that the wait staff and chefs are under pressure and a little stressed, I really don't see it as an excuse for poor substandard service.  Up to this point the food had been almost as good as usual and we had just had the usual bad service from a waitress with an 'I don't give a damn' attitude.  But what really got me was when we were half way through our dessert and the waitress approached us and asked us if we were told that 'We had to be out by 8' when we made our reservation!  (we probably had another 15-20 minutes) Are you kidding me?  We had not ordered any thing else and we were not lounging.   And there were a few unoccupied 4 seater tables in the restaurant.  We were halfway through our dessert, had not requested coffee and the next step would have been to take the bill and be on our way.  We found her approach very rude and left in awe that she actually bothered to even asked that rather than just wait for us to leave.  When we go out for a sit down dinner we are paying for the 'dining experience'.  Not just for the food on our plates.  And my money and time is no less valuable than the guest who will dine after me.  We have had more than enough 'experiences' at this place to make us go elsewhere for good food.  We will not be returning to Hot Rocks.   There are plenty of restaurants with good food AND really good service, it's just unfortunate that Hot Rocks can't nail both."}
{"text":"Love this spot. They have the best pizza in Whitby, it's always a great atmosphere and my friends & I always come back!"}
{"text":"- Food was great - Large variety of menu items, have tried a few different items all which were great - Staff is very friendly - Very cozy and classy environment"}
{"text":"Dining in Durham is getting better all the time, there are a few places trying to bring a good dining experience to the 'remote' region. :P Hot Rocks has decent food, great service and a really nice atmosphere.   The place is always busy and has a nice, clean, modern decor that doesn't distract.  We tried the vegetarian nachos and goat cheese medallion, which were both excellent appetizers, but served on some new square-glass tableware they were trying out which was way too big. It looked nice, but you have to be somewhat practical, two apps took up our entire table!   I enjoyed the pizza, it was the Spicy Cajun with blackened chicken,  sweet potato and a drizzle of garlic aioli on top.  The pizzas at Hot Rocks are probably the best in the area, they are really good.   The rest of the menu looks quite yummy, they have a large assortment of pastas and meat dishes, but disappointingly, no vegetarian options right off the menu.  They are happy to modify their menu, but that is never as good as some well-thought-out veggie options.  Great place, I'll go again next time I'm lost and wandering through Whitby."}
{"text":"We have been to Hot Rocks numerous times and it has always been a positive experience. Unfortunately our latest visit was quite disappointing. The menu has changed but there are many new dishes on the menu that sound quite appetizing. Three of us ordered the Jumbo Shrimp for $17. This is from the Before 3 menu therefore smaller than the dinner version. The menu reads: Marinated in lemon & thyme / charred baby romaine / bacon lardons / mustard vinaigrette /charred lemon / breadcrumb gremolata  The ingredients were right up my alley and I envisioned a plate with a small mound of well charred romaine topped with shrimp and drizzled with mustard vinaigrette, a healthy smattering of bacon lardons sprinkled with the gremolata.   We received our dishes and shot looks of consternation at one another. Three large shrimp, not JUMBO sat atop of two very large hearts of romaine (not baby romaine as stated on the menu) that were not charred at all. The bacon lardons were actually bacon bits that were hard as hell. The mustard vinaigrette was nowhere to be seen and we did not witness a breadcrumb on the plate. I forgot to take a photo to share but I will warn anyone that even thinks of ordering this plate to reconsider.  We paid $17 each to eat three shrimp and we left the romaine on the plate. To add insult to injury, two of us experienced one shrimp with a strange flavour (past prime). A terribly bad dish with an ridiculous price.   When we left I noticed that the cooks were very young...19, 20 perhaps? Nothing wrong with that if a chef is present to oversee but that wasn't the case. Learn what a lardon is, charred, gremolata, read your menu and present as stated boys!  I doubt that we will return. My Mother's non-alcoholic drinks were deducted from her bill. My sister and I were not offered any compensation as we had alcoholic beverages. By the way, the Charcuterie plate was definitely not made in house as stated on the menu."}
{"text":"Best casual restaurant in Whitby. Varied menu high quality and tasty cuisine. Staff is super nice and friendly... They have a nice quiet little patio too. My fav spot!"}
{"text":"I've been in Whitby for 11 years before I finally gave this place a try. I had been to the sister restaurant a couple times and decided to finally give Hot Rocks a try. Well in a short time, I've been there 3 times - twice for dinner and once for lunch. When you walk in and smell the wood burning oven, all you want is pizza, which by the way, is very good. I had a seafood pasta which was fantastic, and the charred Brussels Sprouts are incredible! This restaurant has quickly become one of my go-tos."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here and our server remembered our orders by memory. Food was timely and tasty. Nothing more to say really, if you haven't gone please go."}
{"text":"I have often heard about this place, but I had no idea where it was! When I saw it on the Whitbylicious website, I figured it would be worth a try finally to celebrate my birthday with my husband.   The atmosphere is nice. Dark, but not too dark. Kind of classy, without being pretentious. It was very hot inside, which I can only assume is from the giant wood stove as you first walk in. Wear something light.    The seating is a little tight. We were kind of jammed into a corner and were surrounded by two groups.  Service was friendly and attentive.  We both ordered the same items from the Winterlicious menu:  The appetizers were 3 mini crab cakes which were really nice! The hint of heat made these perfect. They come with a grilled slice of lemon.   For the main course we each had a rare 10 oz ribeye steak with roast potatoes, rapini, carrots and asparagus. My steak was cooked almost perfectly. It was a thin steak, so a couple of spots were closer to medium though. My husband's was mostly medium rare to medium. He let the server know and turned down her offer for a new one. She ended up comping his beer for him instead which was a very nice gesture! The veggies and potatoes were delicious and the steak had great flavour.   For dessert we had the chocolate strawberry tart. So good! Despite looking really rich, it was actually quite light. Perfect after a heavy steak dinner.   We'll definitely be back to try the pizza. It looks amazing!"}
{"text":"I liked the ambience much more than the food. I ordered the pizza and it tasted dry, a bit tasteless and not very fresh.  I should've known better, coming to Whitby....."}
{"text":"Good food, great service. Our waitress was pleasant and very attentive.  She didn't chat a lot because she was very busy. Atmosphere was relaxing and clean. The prices are on the higher end but worth it. Pizza is very tasty. Their curry nachos was pretty good."}
{"text":"The last time I was at hot rocks, I had the most interesting and delicious pizza experience.  If i had written a review that time i would have given it 5 out of 5.  Oddly, I hadn't been back in quite a while until just recently.     This time I ordered the Macedonian  pasta with a starter green salad.  The salad was unique... but not good at all. It was waaayyy  overdressed. It tasted like every ingredient had been pickled  and then doused in lemon juice. I couldn't handle more than a couple mouthfuls before I gave up.   The pasta... looked good.... sounded good.. but again was overdressed. There was so much dried basil in the sauce.. and instead of a light pesto.. The dish was swimming in oil. I'm not kidding. It was more like oil soup with penne noodles.    I'm was supremely disappointed.  But I will say the service was excellent. The server did come by and asked how everything was but I didn't have the courage to send my food back...   Not saying this place doesn't know how to do pizza... and maybe I came on a bad night..  but I would be wary of ordering the pasta and salad."}
{"text":"I've been going to Hot Rocks for years and have always had enjoyable experience. Don't be deterred by the strip mall location, Hot Rocks has great ambiance inside and the food really is creative! It can be hard to find quality, local dining in Whitby so I encourage everyone to try Hot Rocks and support local restaurants.   My mom, sister and I went for a late dinner on a Tuesday, the restaurant was almost empty and very quiet (to be expected). Service was friendly and attentive - it helps that my sister is there all the time and knows everyone.   I loved my entree! farro rice with seasonal vegetables plus edamame. It was the perfect portion, really \"light\" but also very filling. I ate every bite! I was truly impressed with this \"refined\" vegetarian entree - let's be honest it was rice and vegetables but did feel very elegant.   Hot Rocks is family friendly but would also be a good date-night spot too! Free parking!"}
{"text":"It's an odd name, I know, but as soon as you walk in, you realize why: there's a large, stone pizza oven behind the bar. Mystery solved! Time to go home.   Kidding!   My aunts and I went out for dinner and dessert. We've been here for fam jams before and we keep coming back. The service and quality of food has not changed, even though the ownership has changed. This place has a great atmosphere; great for a date or a girls night.   We started with the Curry Chicken Nachos. As expected, it was piled high with multi-coloured tortilla chips and oodles of toppings. There were toppings throughout, not just on top. The chicken gave a surprise kick when it was hidden amongst the delicious mole sauce, scallions and cheese. The guacamole and bruschetta made this the best nachos ever. I'd come back just for these.   They tried the Orzo, Pork Belly Special, Curry Chicken Linguine, Chicken/Sausage/Shrimp and I went with the Atlantic Salmon. It was exactly what we expected: Perfection. Each dish was flavourful with a twist. I've always loved that they'll mix ingredients I'd never put together and it's fantastic. The pasta dishes were HUGE and there was no shortage of meat and veggies. The aunt that had the Curry Chicken Linguine kept trying to share it. The aunt that tried the Pork Belly didn't realize how fatty it would be, but soon discovered why I almost ordered It: moist and full of flavour. My salmon was good and flaky, but it could've been a little bigger. I'm a saucy gal and I would've liked more of the lemon-horseradish yogurt. Mmmm. All of the accompanying veggies were fresh and cooked perfectly. The specials are always something that will try to steal you away from with you've already picked from the menu.   Their wine menu isn't huge, but they have everything you need, from local to imports. They have some delightful in house cocktails as well, but they're a little pricy. Their beer menu could use a little love, but did have 1 craft beer on tap when I was there and I hope they get more in the future.    Even with a change in management, this place has remained the same: Dang good. I was worried when I found out who their sister restaurant is, but my worries have been put to rest. The service is professional and efficient and the food is excellent. I just hope they can keep this level of satisfaction. I've been seeing a lot of negative reviews since the new management came in....hope this isn't a trend! Fingers crossed!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Hot Rocks didn't go over so well unfortunately. When we found out that they shared owner's with Brock House we were very interested.   We had 2 drinks, calamari, and truffle fries. The calamari was overdone, heavily breaded, and greasy. The fries were also greasy and underdone.  The service was mediocre, staff was slow with the bill but friendly.  The environment is nice enough. We were seated at the table directly across from the kitchen which was very loud.  Overall, the experience could've been much better."}
{"text":"I've been to hot rocks twice now, and the second visit was even better than the first. We started off with the Hawaii Five O pizza, which was really good. I asked for the calamari to be prepared gluten free and they were excellent - nicely seasoned, not overcooked and served with a wonderful chipotle aioli. I had the lamb shank - nice, tender, flavourful reduction, with cauliflower garlic mash potatoes. My wife had the Caesar salad and the beef brisket - the salad was very well done, not overpowering or over-sauced. The brisket was also really good, flavourful and with enough fat left on it to keep it tender and not too stringy. The wine list features a good selection of very reasonably priced choices. We left pretty full and pretty happy. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here as we saw they were participating in Whitbylicious, and we were glad we gave it a shot! This restaurant is small and in a plaza of a residential area. We never would have tried this place on a whim if we were driving by.  I got the set menu, which was a spinach and arugula salad, rainbow trout, and a chocolate raspberry torte. It was so delicious, and the portions were perfect. I didn't leave feeling sick from being so full!  My mom got the short ribs with gnocchi and she couldn't stop raving about it. I tried one of her gnocchi and it was so delicious and packed with flavour.  I definitely want to go back to try the paella & a bunch of the appetizers looked really good, so did the pizza. The mussels also must be really good, as I saw so many orders coming out from the kitchen! Will definitely be returning when in the area."}
{"text":"This place is just awesome! Food, drinks, service- everything is so good!  Have been there few times and definitely will come again. Very glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"The experience of cooking meat on a hot rock was rather interesting but overall it's a little on the pricey side. I also ordered an Australian lamb shank which was ok."}
{"text":"Superb food. Fantastic service. We like to go here for our anniversary but have not been able to go for a couple years.  We were not disappointed. Hot rock was excellent and the pizza even better.   Well done see you again soon."}
{"text":"One of the best hidden gem family, neighbourhood restaurants in Durham.  Off the beaten track so you may not ever see this place.  But above average food in terms of taste and uniqueness.  I'm not in the area that often now so not there in a while."}
{"text":"Incredible place for our monthly ladies lunch.  Looking for places like this to have a monthly Accounting meeting as well.  It's been years since I was here last but it certainly did not disappoint. As you walk in it is hard not to order that wonderful, thin  crust pizza. All four of us enjoyed it to the extreme.  Go on in & enjoy"}
{"text":"One of Whitby's hidden gems.  I remember coming here as a kid.  Our family decided to have a fathers day lunch here since we couldn't recall the last time we've been to Hot rocks. As soon as we walked in, I remembered how cool this place was. \"Creative Diner\" is what they advertise and that's definitely what it is.  Co-owners from The Brock House = good quality food.  I had 2 starters; which was enough to satisfy me.  Fried Mac and Cheese was good.  Balls of Macaroni dusted with bread crumbs.  Wasn't as cheesy as I hoped and to be honest; I think it's outclassed by St. Louis' Bacon wrapped Mac and cheese.  Next, I had the P.E.I. Mussels (curry) and they were so so so so so delicious.  Nice and creamy, not spiced too strong and the mussels themselves were cooked to perfection.  It was topped with some kind of sweet potato garnish which was a nice touch. Now the best part about Hot rocks is the appetizer \"Hot Rocks\" (which my mom ordered).  You're basically served a hot plate and a choice of app to cook yourself. My mom ordered the beef tips. I had to sneak a piece, it was amazing.  Would definitely recommend that if it's your first time coming here.  Their salads are very good too.  Crisp lettuce, just the right amount of dressing. The restaurant itself is hidden away in a small plaza (Manning/Anderson) in the corner. Do yourself a favour and come here for lunch.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Previously I've eaten here and the salmon was not as fresh as it should have been. This time however, we ordered an arugula and beet salad, a shrimp appetizer and a custom pizza from their brick oven.  The food was tasty and generally the portions were fairly decent.    The service was excellent and very prompt.  And the ambiance is always on the cozy side due to the lighting and the huge pizza oven."}
{"text":"The food here is overpriced...and I have to say it was one of the worst tasting restaurants I've ever been to. We ordered the MVP pizza which I took a couple of bites out of and couldn't eat any more, something about it tasted weird and I think even Pizza Pizza taste better for a small fraction of the cost. Also ordered the \"hot rocks\" appetizers and the meat has no flavour to it at all, even after dipping it in the sauce it came with. Also tried the spare ribs and it was super salty and not edible. Service was also a little slow. We sat in the patio and there was a crazy amount of mosquitos attacking us. Would not recommend this place at all."}
