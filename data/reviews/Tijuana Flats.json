{"text":"The food at this place has always been an excellent service was good at one time however the only suggestion I can make to the owner is whoever is taking the order needs to do a better job of explaining what comes with the meal and what they put on it"}
{"text":"Alexis and Britney have been great. This is my second time here today and both of them are still providing superb service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced. I ordered quesadillas it did not come with sour cream or guacamole, they charge extra for that. I asked for salsa for 4 people and the waitress comes back with a small cup of salsa. Food is very ordinary. We used to love the Tijuana Flats in Florida, this location is totally not worth it. Bye Bye Tijuana Flats, I am not coming back."}
{"text":"Recently opened in Gastonia.  Staff was very friendly and attentive and service was fast.  Upbeat decor and good family atmosphere.  BUT the food was mediocre at best.  Burrito appeared to be large, but mostly tortilla.  Paid extra for steak, at best had 7-8 little pieces of steak.  Mostly filling, lettuce tomatoes etc.   For the money, I'll stick with Moe's from now in."}
{"text":"This about to be a date night spot starting ASAP! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu!  #TacoTuesday for sure! This was my first yelp event and I have been soooo impressed.  The prices are good too so that is a huge PLUS! I love the atmosphere out here as well, it is very laid back and relaxing."}
{"text":"Not a bad experience. Extremely friendly staff. But if you want to break it down Tiajuana Flats is a \"Mexican\" style restaurant from Orlando Florida that claims to be Tex Mex. 

If your from the west coast and know what Mexican food is you can stop reading now, this place isn't for you. If your from Texas and know what Tex Mex is you can stop reading now, this place isn't for you. 

Now if your from the east coast you might love this place. The portions are large. They have a good 20 items on the hot sauce bar (yet oddly no salsa, has Florida written all over it). Burritos, Tacos, Chimichangas, nachos, etc. The rice seemed to be pre-packaged not fresh.  The re-fried beans seemed to be out of a can but they were not spiced up.

All the flavors are good, tasty, just neither Mexican nor Tex Mex, but Florida Mex."}
{"text":"My second time here and the second time we have had slow service.  Easy order 2 kids tacos, 1 kids burrito, and 1 order of nachos. Still waiting after 15 mins. The food has been good, just slow service and a poor design on ordering. There are other places to go, we'll go there next time."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with any choice on the menu. Tacos are big and the nachos can be shared. Burritos are a must have. Definitely a place to return to again and again."}
{"text":"Was hungry for Tex Mex and decided to give this place a try. Placed our order, repeated it, they repeated it and still got my wife's wrong. Then it was cold. I also have a hard time paying for salsa to go with my chips at a Mexican restaurant. Probably not coming back."}
{"text":"I was familiar with this chain from FL. Food is very good albeit a tad pricey. Hot sauce bar is great."}
{"text":"Service was great. Everyone super friendly. The food was great best tex-mex spot in charlotte !! I will be back soon !!"}
{"text":"The people  that work here are very personable and helpful.   I took my two older kids here and they both gave a thumbs up.  Their sauce bar is interesting in that you can find the right sauce to compliment the chips or dish.   Glad to see something good come to this location!"}
{"text":"Burritos are average because they are good but don't stand out when compared to other Mexican theme places. Chips are the star of the menu because they are super fresh.

Management is wonderful, upon telling them it was our first time, they gave us some free samples.

Wonderful customer service makes me want to give it more stars. But, you don't go to a restaurant because of the people. The food isn't bad, just unremarkable (other than the chips). Honestly it would be a great place to share some chips and beer while waiting for a movie or something similar."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I could cry. Tijuana flats is my favorite quick eats restaurant and there's now one down the street from me! Delicious! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The sweet chili sauce is mixed w the peach sauce is the best. I really hope this place takes off since I've seen businesses come and go at this end of east blvd."}
{"text":"Love Tex Mex. This was very bland. Had fish taco and it had a roll of fish (it was tasty), cabbage and sauce. The chips, salsa and pica de gallo were very bland."}
{"text":"There was a month where I frequented this location once a week and I occasionally still go here for everything from the tacos to norrito bowls. There are weekly specials and the food always tastes fresh. Though you will have a bit of a wait from the time you place your order to the time it is delivered to your table it will satisfy your needs. The online ordering system is convenient if you want to order ahead of time and my order has always been accurate. The featured area is the hot sauce bar which has a variety of mild, sweet, or spicy flavors. Tijuana Flats is my go-to when I am not sure what to eat and I've always been happy thus far. The employees have been friendly and only good experiences!"}
{"text":"Tijuana Flats offers excellent customer service. You're greeted with a smile when placing your order. The food is delivered to your table. The sauce bar is great. The prices are reasonable & the food is very tasty."}
{"text":"I use to love Tijuana flats back in Florida when it first opened its first few locations. It was good. Tried it here in Gastonia and it was overpriced small portions and worse quality than i remember. Come to find out they franchised this restaurant so that explains why they cheapened it up so bad. Qdoba moes or chipotle are better and a couple of them even cheaper too."}
{"text":"I LOVE Mexican and Tex-mex food, so I'm pretty critical about any restaurant in this category.   I found the food lacking flavor. My burrito was a bit mushy on the inside, probably due to the fact they use a stewed chicken mix (some places call it chicken ranchero, chicken tinga, chicken re√†l) rather than freshly grilled chicken. Salsa, although fresh, tasted like plain crushed tomatoes. The chips were over-salted, perhaps to make up for the salsa.

I will say the service and hospitality was fantastic!  They saw us approach with a baby carrier and opened the door for us.  Also because they were not too busy, they offered us full table service rather than ordering at the counter, which was much appreciated.

Not sure I'll return because of the food.
Other options are much tastier....Moe's, Qdoba."}
{"text":"Love the Atom Bombs! Love the Hot Sauce Bar!! 
Online ordering super fast and easy!! Sonny was great!!!"}
{"text":"First time writing a review on here and I'm glad to say it's a solid 5 stars! I tend to typically stay away from Tex-Mex restaurants but I decided to try something different before the year ended. You walk in and are immediately greeted by friendly staff, they could tell it was my first time here and were happy to explain how the system worked. The food was great, I got bean and cheese flautas, it came with a side of guacamole/sour cream and queso. The portions are also really good for the price! Honestly the customer service here was what earned them my five stars! They were very attentive and accommodating! I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"My food was alright. But this place gets 5 stars for service. I didn't catch her name, but the lady with the shaved head provided some of the best customer service I've ever had at one of these fast-foodish chains! If you see a girl that fits the description, you'll know you're in good hands!"}
{"text":"This is the WORST food I have ever eaten. HORRIBLE!  24$ is Waaay too much to pay for 4 little fish tacos and 2small plastic cup beers. 
I will Never go back. I'd can't even rate it because you don't have negatives. But it wouldn't let me continue until I rated! . Very. Very. Disappointed"}
{"text":"The food was average. The hot sauce on the hot sauce bar lacked heat. The sauce that had a tear face on it just tasted like black pepper.  Over all not impressed. The staff was great. Order food they bring it to your table. The food wasn't bad but it didn't blow me out of the water either. I ordered a veggie burrito but I had to add veggies to it! Otherwise it would have just been rice and beans. I really wanted to like this place. But it was eh. Probably won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Average higher priced fast food joint.  Both the burrito & cheese enchiladas were lots of tortilla & sparse on the real ingredients.  Full service after you order & only after you take your cup to the counter & ask 2 people for a refill. (Although,  it looked they were having a good time in the back.) Hope they figure it out!"}
{"text":"They catered lunch at my work and everyone loved it. Multiple people stated it was the best lunch ever brought in. They went above and beyond what normal places do.  We will definitely call them again!"}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming a go-to fast casual option for me when I'm in Dilworth. The food is fantastic here. The menu at Tijuana Flats has great variety, definitely more than any other fast Tex Mex style restaurant. It extends beyond the usual staples of tacos & burritos, including enchiladas, chimichangas, tostadas & horizontal lambadas.There are also a variety of ingredients, the food is not over-seasoned and everything is well prepared.

With Tex Mex, we all pretty much know what we're getting, burritos, tacos, some mixture of meat, beans, lettuce, salsa, corn or flour tortilla, etc. However, this place has something different...

The most valuable appointment in the restaurant is the sauce bar, a counter with a host of different sauce choices. Now some might say, \"Poo-poo! Who needs all those sauces? Those are just for show,\" or \"I don't even like sauces.\" However, and I mean no disrespect, those people are pinheads. 

I'm unsure how many sauces there are. Maybe around 20, 25, a thousand. I went to college for Literature so, don't know much bout numbers 'n ciphers 'n such. There is a sauce for just about any particular taste bud. Some are mild, some are murderously spicy, some made from haba√±ero peppers, some from chipotle peppers.  There are green sauces, red sauces, yellow sauces. Sauces for bosses, sauces for hosses, sauces in vases. Some are as sweet as a candied treat and all complete any meat with or without added heat. You get the drift.

I guess for the churchy types some of the sauce names are NSFW or not kid friendly. Don't like it? Go to Taco Bell and get you some boiled horse meat. My apologies, I should never encourage anyone to go to Taco Bell...ever.

All this talk of sauces should not shortchange the food, which is outstanding. You can taste that the veggies and meat are fresh and everything everything is prepared to order. Wheat tortilla alternatives are available for good colon health or whatnot. And of course for a cheap pig like me, the portions are healthy at fair prices. Wait, what? The meals are definitely the star, but they have to share double billing with the sauces."}
{"text":"This restaurant is now CLOSED. Second time a store closes seemingly overnight without any notice whatsoever. The store just north of Charlotte also closed in a very similar fashion about two years ago."}
{"text":"It is a great place to go get food and the people there are nice and loud  but overall I would go here because the food is very good"}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe, friendly high energy staff - we were greeted at the ( she opened the door for us ) by the General manager. Food was quick and delicious - I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food for what it is worth, especially since it is the only take out meal my one year old will eat. 
My favorites are the fish taco and the bean burrito. Definitely worth a try if you're in the neighborhood and don't feel like dealing with the cantina crowd."}
{"text":"Decent food but overpriced and you get nickeled and dimes everywhere.  Add one thing or another it will cost you.  Also no free salsa with the chips?  Better options out there at a lower price point."}
{"text":"Inconsistent in every way.  I have been here quite a few times now and both the service have ranged from terrible to excellent.  The food is mostly average, about as good as taco bell.  I don't mind this because I enjoy taco bell on occasion.  However, the food will inexplicably be awful sometimes. Once the lettuce tasted completely foul and another time the onions were awful.  The service is the same way. I have ordered a takeout order about 10-15 minutes before arriving and then had to wait an additional 10 minutes for my food once I got there.  I would just as soon go to taco bell where the food and service are more consistent."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, fun setting. I personally did not care for it. Service was outstanding though! Great people work there."}
{"text":"Great taco meal deal on Tuesdays!  Love the trio appetizer (guac, cheese, salsa & chips).  Wait staff are very friendly & helpful."}
{"text":"First time here...came on a recommendation from a friend who was visiting from Florida.  I am a big fan of Mexican, but would say I had an average experience. The service was great but the food did not leave a remarkable impression. I did like that they used mahi in their fish tacos. My fiance had a beef burrito which she thought was okay.  The sauce bar was unique and gives you a good selection to please your palate.  Also, I felt the food was a little overpriced.  I'll give the place a second try..."}
{"text":"I have come here several times now (alone and with folks) for lunch and the service is always fantastic. I dont think I have ever seen a guy cashier/server, but the ladies are genuinely very friendly and make sure your drink is refilled, etc...many times they run to the door to open it for you. Food comes out fast and hot. Very clean.
Tues and Thurs are great days because they have combo deals for under 6 bucks which is drive thru pricing these days. 
I tend to get their chicken and black bean dos tacos...its enough for me to bring a taco for dinner because they are huge. The menu has calories mentioned which is nice and there is some customization. Portions are great.
The hot sauce bar took a couple of tries to figure out what I like, but they have a great selection...I really like the Brutal Bajan, the Ricon Heat, and the Tropical Curry one, but they have really mild ones if wanted. 
They're a favorite lunch option for me."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday here was a great deal, and I like the multitude of hot sauce options. The tacos were a bit bland sans sauce, but I know that is purposeful so that the sauces can shine. The girl who greeted us at the door was super friendly and eager to help, and the girl busing tables was also excellent - very polite. 

Top tip: if you are adventurous but have a low spice tolerance, DO NOT think to yourself \"oh, the super spicy one with the death face can't be that bad, I'll try it.\" You will regret it."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION!!
I've been to other Tijuana Flats and this location is by far the worse! First off the customer service is terrible. Young college teens that just don't care basically. They forgot a part of our order, good thing I was still driving out of the parking lot so had to turn around and go back. Worse part was we came home started eating the chips and salsa, I went for my taco and THERE WAS A LONG PIECE OF HAIR IN MY TACO !!! DISGUSTING !! It wasn't even just on top of the taco is was all the way from the bottom of the meat hanging on top. It was so gross !! NEVER GOING BACK TO THIS LOCATION. STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"So we came here for our first time on \"Tijuana Tuesdaze\" and it was absolutely delicious. The place was packed, but the lines moved quick, table was ready, food came out in a good amount of time and the service was good. They have a hot sauce bar which you can try all these different types of hot sauces which is cool. Tacos were a big size, and tasted fresh all the way around, shells, meat, toppings etc. Definitely coming back to try there burritos, which I'm sure will be fantastic. Overall great experience, and definitely recommend"}
{"text":"We've (me + 1) been 3 times now (each time, during the week, around 5-6 p.m.).  We are still fans!  The chicken is fresh, the customer service is excellent.  The people that work there are pleasant and helpful.  This is about equal or a step above Moe's (and I am a fan of Moe's).   But, since discovering Tijuana Flats/Concord Mills location, we haven't been back to Moe's.  The place is clean and the menu offers quite a variety."}
{"text":"I came in with a few first timers, we weren't greeted at the door and given menus, when we took our order our cashier was Anna, she was good and seemed like she knew how to take our order efficiently. I'm at the manager on duty which was Justin, he took the initiative to grab our appetizer when I told him we were sitting outside, as always the quality of the food was amazing, and Anna came outside twice while we were eating to check on us, we asked her for a refill and everyone was very friendly! Thank you flat heads, even you guys in the kitchen. The megaJuana's were a lot bigger in my day though, we used to stuff them up with the cheap ingredients to make them almost overflowing, which were either rice or lettuce. I asked to get it grilled and they grilled it really well, it tasted amazing. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Yahoo! T-Flats in Ballantyne! 

Super stoked about this. We're from FL and missed having one close by. Taco Tuezdayz- YAH!! 

Food was delicious and consistent, as always. To the reviewer who mentioned no salsa.... did you totally miss the sauce bar? You have TONS of options, and if you go with Smack My Sweet A$$ it's not hot and delicious on the chips. 

Food was yummy and service was over the top.

For those who are new, T-Flats is delicious, casual Tex Mex. They also serve beer and (I think) sangria. 

Way to go ya'll and welcome back to South Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"Presentation and staff friendliness are top notch!  I've attached a photo of my dinner, aside from being photo perfect, it tasted as good as it looks!  I've been to many authentic Mexican and Tex-Mex restaurants, but this place takes the prize!  Alexa who is the manager when we were there, is what my impression of what a good manager should be, kind, efficient, helpful and courteous.  I highly recommend this eatery...."}
{"text":"Average place for dinner. Felt like an upscale Taco Bell. Food was just okay but left me desiring more. Sangria is good. Salsa bar was really cool and diverse - lots of options! Fun fact - you can add meat to your queso if you want!"}
{"text":"This Tijuana Flats lives up to its Florida origins. As a new Ashevillian transplanted from central Florida this is the closest TF within a 2 hour drive. Clean, friendly and delicious. It fills the void deep down in my soul I've been missing since moving to Western NC in 2014.
My go to is the dos chicken tacos, only because you can't get anything close in Asheville. Want a meat free version? Try it with beans instead of meat. The queso I could eat by the gallon. Their burritos are the size of my arm, as delicious as they are huge. My only complaint is they discontinued black olives as a topping. 
Love hot sauce? Try the hot sauce bar. 
I am biding my time until they open a location in Asheville."}
{"text":"I had the chimichanga and it wasn't very good. The seasoning was bland and l was looking for some bold authentic flavor. It tasted like a subway version of a chimichanga."}
{"text":"I read all of the awesome reviews and perhaps this was an off night for TF. My hubby and I each had the blackened chicken bowls which came with rice, black beans, jalape√±o, onions, guacamole, sour cream and cheese. My bowl just had chicken, rice, jalape√±o, and sour cream. My husband had the works. We both found the rice and chicken to be very dry and lacking in the southwestern flavor that one might find at Chipoltle. Overall, it was average."}
{"text":"This place is great for \"fast food\". It was my first time there and the staff was so super friendly and helpful. Thank you for being family friendly and for my wonderful surprise free father's day meal! I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The wait to order the food is insane!!!! The cashiers seem to spend 5-10 minutes with each person! We were third in line and it took us almost 30 minutes just to order. Food came out wrong! There was no chicken in my \"chicken bowl\" couldn't get a refill and the food didn't even taste good! I'll stick to chipotle!"}
{"text":"Good food and well priced. If you get an appetizer of chips and dips you can get a fresh order to take home with you! On both of my visits I got the veggie burrito and it was good each time. I love the fun sauces on the hot sauce bar. I know I will be going here rather then Moe's whenever I am craving quick and fresh Mexican food. PS. The service here is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Tex-Mex spot in Charlotte. The food was incredible, and so was the service. Gracie did an outstanding job of making sure my meal was perfect. Will be back! 10/10"}
{"text":"I Love Tijuana Flats! Great place to have a location at. The food is always good, and they always have specials. 

I remembered they had a $5 bowl this month and that's what I usually get. So after doing some shopping at the mall, my daughter and I decided to stop here on our way home. 

I got my bowl and she wanted nachos. Very filling for dinner. I got mine Powelite style, where the dairy is reduced or fat free items. 

We always try sauces to see what we're in the mood for that day. As we ate, it got busier. This location is hiring as well."}
{"text":"I use to frequent this restaurant when I lived in Orlando Fl.  It was always one of my favorites.  When it opened up here I was excited to see not much has changed.  The service is fantastic and everyone is overly polite. The Hot Sauce Bar makes every visit an adventure and the chimichanga (wet on all sides) is amazing.  I have to go back asap."}
{"text":"Wrote a prior review on this place but just wanna follow up.  This right now is my favorite burrito spot here lately.  The burrito is just really well made and isn't hard on my stomach.  So right now, this is my go to burrito spot and that's saying a lot.  Cause I crush burritos on the reg"}
{"text":"Food is great as was it was on East Blvd and Hwy 51 before that. And Florida locations. Service is just slow. People were nice.  I assume most everything is precooked. Only 5 or 6 tables of people. Why so slow. ONE In Orlando is very busy and food is relatively fast.


We really want this place to work. Love the food. Call me for any help needed."}
{"text":"Checked out this new place last weekend for a late lunch. I was excited to try it as I love Tex-Mex of any type. The wife however... not excited. 

I was thinking this would be a typical full service place, but it's an order at the counter and they'll bring it to you place. Okay. I can roll with it. Ordered the blackened chicken quesadilla while the significant other got the mahi salad. A side of guacamole for both was worth a try as well. 

After ordering and paying, I noticed an awesome and HUGE hot sauce bar. 10 minutes later I found 2-3 sauces to try and they were hollering my name for the guacamole. Nice, large serving with warm chips. Chips were a bit flimsy but okay overall. Guacamole was pretty good. Huge serving. 5-6 minutes later unheard my name again and out came our entree. Quesadilla was pretty good. Nothing spectacular but solid.  Wife really loved her salad that was served in a whole wheat shell. Hot sauces were a nice touch and I went back to that bar a couple times. 

Overall a nice addition to East and should do well now that Longboards is gone. Certainly a better option than Noe's.... I mean Moe's. I'll be back- probably for takeout."}
{"text":"Not sure why another reviewer claimed their portions were small and prices high. For the heaping amount off nachos I got the price was very reasonable. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful and the hot sauce bar is so fun! We even bought a bottle to take home. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is really great! Freshly made and healthy ingredients. The staff is just as great. All smiles and super friendly."}
{"text":"The food here is tasty, and you get a good amount for your money. I really enjoy their blackened chicken quesadilla. They are really more of a taco joint; serving things like burritos, quesadillas, chimichangas, and enchiladas.  I really have to give props to the employees and the excellent service they provide. Every time I enter the restaurant I am greeted and the employees always have suggestions if you can't decide on something to eat. 

Last time I ate there, I ended up waiting about 15-20 minutes for my food, which was an unusually long wait for that restaurant. The manager, Rosie, walked up to me, apologized for the wait (there was just an error with their system)and then refunded the money for my meal! I did not voice any complaints, they chose to do that themselves.That's what I call excellent customer service! Shoutout to Rosie and Joey for making my day that much better!

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone by UNCC who wants tasty mexican food with excellent and friendly service."}
{"text":"First time with my husband. We were expecting something different. If people would know how different will be a nice customer experience...
The only cashier asked everything like we were regular guests. Good just fine. Ordered the \"Flautas\" with chicken and husband a bowl. My flautas had a few cut pieces of chicken served with onions lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, sour cream and guacamole. (No chips with my order). It is another normal place where we go only once. 
If you like hot sauces with chips, it's your place..."}
{"text":"10/29/15

Full disclosure...after the Back to School Yelp event 3 months ago, I had my doubts about the quality of food at Tijuana Flats. I even compared Tijuana to Taco Bell! I know, I know...A little drastic right? I'm sorry Tijuana and I hope you will accept this apology letter in the form of a Yelp review :).

At the Back to School Yelp event, we were gifted a 10 dollar credit that expired on October 31. I don't really visit the university area too often so it took me a while to use my gift card. I visited on a Thursday. Before planning my visit, I took a quick peek at the menu and had a couple of menu items in mind. I definitely like that the menu offers nutritional information. When I arrived, the cashier immediately informed me of the Thursday special, a burrito, chips, and a drink for 5.99. I considered the special but still kept in mind the menu items I thought about before I arrived. The cashier was totally patient with me. I asked a lot of questions and went back and forth with my decision. Finally, I  decided to get the chicken and bean tacos on a wheat tortilla. I made myself to the sauce bar and tried out the siracha hot sauce; it was delicious with just the right amount of spice to compliment the tacos. My refried beans were a bit too smooth for me. I like texture, so I welcome a few chunks and lumps in my food :). I was satisfied with the overall flavor of my meal and would definitely go back.

P.S. Tijuana sells wine and beer which definitely sets them apart from Taco Bell :). Drink specials vary."}
{"text":"Delicious food and polite staff. Been here several times and it's always a great meal. I usually get the Chicken \"No-ritto\" Bowl or the Chipotle Chicken Burrito w/ chips. The sweet tea is pretty good too. This particular location gets a bonus nod for the wonderful art."}
{"text":"Delicious food and polite staff. Been here several times and it's always a great meal. I usually get the Chicken \"No-ritto\" Bowl or the Chipotle Chicken Burrito w/ chips. The sweet tea is pretty good too."}
{"text":"I am from Florida and always eat at one when I visit, but now I don't have to wait to visit! 

I got the chicken and bean quesadilla and it was so fresh and delicious! The hot sauce bar with smack my ass and call me sally sauces are awesome! 

I'll definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"Great food ! Great service ! Great price! All food never frozen - fresh salsa. Great for everyone."}
{"text":"I don't know why the bad ratings. We've been consistently pleased.... never disappointed! Favs are Taco Tuesday and burrito Thursday!"}
{"text":"Everyone in here is very kind and helpful. The food is exactly what I expect. I enjoy having a variety of burrito options and I'm thrilled Tijuana Flats is back in the area. This is not Chipotle. Chipotle is delicious too, but variety is awesome. People complain over the silliest things. I'm just glad there are more options other than fried food or big chains coming to Concord Mills. And I'd like to see Tijuana Flats remain the the area! I'll continue to be a regular. 

I typically get a bowl to avoid the extra carbs in the tortilla. The contents are always good and the sauce options are great!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is Better then Chipotle! Everything is fresh & delicious. I think I order from here at least 2xs a week. First and foremost you definitely get your money's worth, because the burritos are large and filling. I struggle finishing just one. Also I recommend ordering there cheese sauce its great with the chips. Customer service is also wonderful, everyone manages to keep a smile on your face from ordering by phone, in person, and waiting. I forgot to take a picture of the food but did take pictures inside the restaurant because I loved the theme they had going on, very funky and modern. Will update photos next time!"}
{"text":"Really bummed about this place. I've been a huge fan ever since living in Central Florida. We drive all the way from Charlotte to Gastonia for our Tijuana flats fix ... it's been good at times but the past 2 times have been awful. Service is always good but I've seen a major lack in quality/taste of food. Not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"I am SO thrilled that Tijuana Flats is back in Charlotte! They just opened at their East Blvd location yesterday after previously having 3 locations in Charlotte a few years ago. The new TF is in the building on East Blvd. that was previously Italian Pie. I believe Tijuana Flats is superior to Moe's, Chipotle, etc. The freshness of their ingredients is evident. From the black olives to the jalape√±os, you can tell they pride themselves on using fresh ingredients. Be sure to try many of the sauces at the hot sauce bar (my favorite is Smack My Ass and Call Me Sallly!). 

The service here is also always remarkable. Even though you order food at a cash register, your food is brought to you and guests are frequently checked on at tables as well as offered drink refills. I did notice, though, that the staff at this location is super eager to help since they're brand new. It was almost a little overwhelming but I'm sure that will settle a bit after time. 

It'll always be 5 stars for Tijuana Flats from me. I am so excited to have TF back in town and in such a convenient location."}
{"text":"I'm just in love with Taco Tuesdays! Have been going to Tijuana Flats since living back in FL (where it originated). I would suggest that they have more options for different tacos. All in all, I will be returning."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Great food at great prices and excellent service! I have gotten chimichangas, tacos, and tonight I tried the atom bombs! Like a jalapeno popper only wayyyyy better!! I really want to highlight the wonderful guest service at this store...Charlene and Lauren were helpful, friendly, funny and NOT ROBOTS!! I cannot stand going somewhere and being read a script by the person serving me...nice to see some great personalities! The girls were greeting guests immediately and not being overly aggressive with asking if we needed anything! Charlene told me about her favorite hot sauce which was delicious and not too hot! She also let me know about the offer where I donate $5 and get a bottle of hot sauce!!!!!! 5 stars all around, I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"To call this place Tex-Mex is tantamount to  treason. Ordering process was clunky. Not easy to tell pricing -- ended up getting uncharged $4 on my burrito for things like rice and beans that are standard fare at fast casual chains like Chipotle or Moe's. Food quality was average -- certainly didn't merit the premium pricing of a $12-14 dollar burrito. Staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Couldnt wait for TF's to open, was soooo disappointed with Longboards, what a waste of good location. Am a Dilworth native and used to think Wads was large as a kid, surprised that TF seems much smaller. 

Have been to TF's 3 times now and really like this place!
As others have commented, the hot sauce bar is great, from left to right, mild to hot, some really interesting flavors to discover. The staff is great and is what will keep me coming back again and again, well that and their Tuesday special Taco Tuesdaze, 2 tacos, chips & drink for $5.  

Cant brag enough about the staff, you can tell they appreciate everyone that comes through the door, and their attention to detail, should keep everyone coming back."}
{"text":"The family and I decided to check this place out. Service was expedient and friendly.  Loved the hot bar and maybe my palate can handle some heat. The ones with the frownies didn't reflect the grimace.  Lol. Food was good and priced right.  The kids meals are hearty. All and all we will keep in our rotation."}
{"text":"Basic, good tasting Tex mex food. Very similar to Moes. For the price, it's worth a visit though! The staff is very polite, quick, and helpful for new comers. The sauce bar is a nice added touch too."}
{"text":"Can't beat Tex-Mex food at a decent price. I've been here several times and I ALWAYS get the chicken flautas. Guess I could try something else, but why? I order it JOLT style; jalepe√±o, onions, lettuce & tomatoes. It cubes with a side of queso, guacamole and sour cream. The fajitas are crispy on the outside and full of Tex-Mex deliciousness on the inside. The meat is tender and flavorful. The toppings make my tummy happy ! I was even impressed that the University location offered teachers a FREE entree during winter break...WINNING! A big fan of this place...I'll definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"We tried this place after looking at it on Yelp. The food was really good and the customer service was great. The people were so friendly. The food tastes great!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent. They have great, friendly employees. Food was pretty good. Cool, chill atmosphere. Good place to go grab a bite with friends."}
{"text":"I've been to this location as well as the one near Concord Mills. They are both slow. If you want fast food to go, I would recommend calling in your order or placing it online. Who knows, maybe it truly takes that long to make flautas? 

As far as the food, I have no complaints. My son loves the Philly cheesesteak flautas. I also love their queso. I will continue to come here, I just know to order ahead if I don't want a long wait."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and the store looked very clean. My chicken quesadilla was very blah. The chicken tasted and looked exactly like the Tyson short cuts you find in the grocery store, with some type of cheap sauces tossed in. The fillings were meh and the queso was flavorless and very runny. I will probably not go back. The decor and layout was pretty cool though."}
{"text":"Too slow and completely disorganized staff. Last time there for me. I waited 20 minutes for a cheese quesadilla   That's never okay."}
{"text":"I LOVE IT!!!  I haven't had Tijuana Flats since I lived in FL so I have to get it whenever I'm in N.  Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this particular location of Tijuana Flats.  I used to go to the original location in University Area, but that was several years ago, so I stopped in a few days ago for lunch - here's the whole enchilada on Tijuana Flats... 

Parking:  This place is located in the heart of the Ballantyne Corporate Nonsense, and the particular plaza/shopping center Tijuana is located in is tight, and cramped.  Take your time coming and going, as this area is super busy, esp during lunch times.

Food:  I ordered the steak burrito in a flour burrito and added sour cream & queso in addition to the usual assortment of tex-mex fillings.  After waiting a few moments for my burrito to be prepared and brought to be, I was surprised to discover that it was better than I remebered.  My one complaint would be that the steak was somewhat bland, but otherwise the burrito was decent. The chips it was served with were just OK to me - certainly nothing to write home about as they weren't warm.  They've also got a unique little hot sauce bar to take advantage of as well.

Service/Ambiance: The service was super friendly so def no complains there.  The place def feels clean, and contains plenty of seats/tables if you want to eat there.

Tijuana flats is good not great.  Its biggest problem is that there are several other burrito spots in the area that are as good or better.  With that being said, Im sure I will be back as its another, decent lunch option."}
{"text":"Went to a Yelp event and the food was amazing!!! The staff was very pleasant. There's a hot sauce bar (even though I don't do hot sauce, I found it very interesting). The Sangria was DELICIOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Tijuana Flats and was happy to see one in the area!

Check out their deals on Taco Tuesdays and Throwback Thursdays! If you're on a tight budget but want to get out for dinner, those are the days you'll want to go to Tijuana!"}
{"text":"Flats is the place where you get to choose about 20 hotsauucs great food great beer on tap don't drive by stop and get you a toco or even better a lot of tocos"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Tijuana Flats and it will probably be my last. I asked for a burrito bowl and the waiter said they do not have that, but they have nurrito bowls. That's fine, I get building your brand, but maybe without an attitude. I got my order to go. I asked for no beans since I'm allergic and I still got beans. I gave my food to my roommate when I got home.. At least she approved!"}
{"text":"If this could have a 0 star it would. This was the WORST experience ever. I used to come all the time and had the best experience. Tonight. No. Terrible. Horrible. First let me just say my husband and I ordered the trio appetizer and the kid that brought it out basically threw it in my lap. Then I got the steak tacos they were decent but kind of cold. My husband got he carnitas burrito and said it was good. At the time of our order we said we wanted the cookie dough flautas to come out 15 mins later. I didn't realize it would be 45 mins later. We got them after the back \"forgot\" about them. We got them and they weren't even hot. This was just the food. The dining room floor looked like it hadn't been swept since last year. The tables were nasty. After tonight I'd rather go to Taco Bell. 

Ok so we decided to give one more chance and I'm so glad we did. It was back to normal but better. I will be back now that they've made things better. The staff was friendly and helpful. Food was fresher and the store was cleaner. As always Chandler was incredibly helpful!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and great experiences both times.  

I'm going to mention the ordering process like every other Yelper before me.  Its odd. Its not what you expect.  I've seen people walk in the door, look around and walk out.  I've seen people walk confidently in, just to be turned around and given a menu back at the door. 

This is how you do it, so you can avoid all the looks. 
1. Walk in the door
2. Grab a menu from the nifty menu holder thats located to the right of the door
3.  Follow the weird beer & wine lined path that leads around the perimeter of the store counter-clockwise until you reach lighting where you can read the menu
4.  Decide what delicious food you're going to get.  
5.  Add Churros to your list.
6. Continue your journey to the registers where you'll speak to the nice employees about what you would like to eat.
7. Tell them your name
8. Find a seat
9. Peruse the hot sauce bar
10. Find your seat
11. Listen for your name to be called and the delicious food to be brought to you.

Phew, 11 steps.  

I've ordered the chicken flauta's both times that I've been here because I like chicken, I like guac, I like queso... therefore this is my food.  I'm hoping that I'll branch out more next time, but odds are I'll get suckered back into ordering my flautas again.

The churros are amazing.  If you followed my list, you will know this.  

I like that the staff is very attentive, you will not want for a refill while you're here.  But if you haven't been here before, and you didn't follow my list (shame on you), it may be a bit confusing at first.  But don't worry, they don't laugh at the newbs."}
{"text":"I've only had burritos and those are pretty good but they don't really blow me away. I don't like that you have to pay extra to have something like salsa to dip your chips in. I generally prefer Moe's to Tijuana Flats but the 20-50% student discount here makes it a lot more competitive."}
{"text":"The truth is that I love Mexican food. I could eat it daily - more than once a day, even.

Tijuana Flats serves Mexican food. It was definitely Mexican food. But just how good?

My Norrito (\"No + burrito\") bowl with chicken had all one expects to find in such a bowl: chicken, rice, beans, pico de gallo, and guacemole. 

It wasn't quite as warm as desired. I would prefer the rice, beans and meat be hot enough that mixing with cold guac & pico won't cool it completely.

And I don't like red onions. The pico de gallo is laden with red onions. Kudos to the manager who suggested getting no pico, but asking for tomatoes and extra cilantro.

The salsa was hearty and rich, although nothing too exciting. The tortilla chips were fine, not as good as numerous other restaurants.

What differs this place from other slightly-fast Mexican places:

-You order at a counter like others, BUT then a waitstaff takes over every step of your dining experience.
-The hot sauce bar is extensive.

Me, I prefer a salsa bar to a hot sauce bar.

Conclusion After One Visit: 
It's only minorly different than Moe's/Qdoba/Salsarita's/Chipotle, mainly in that they bring the food to you and continue to wait on you once you've ordered."}
{"text":"First off its a really cool building. That's where my positive experience ends. The food was bland. The service was great and the staff very friendly. We were just really disappointed in the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Tex-Mex style grub that is always flavorful and filling but they give too many tortilla chips to \"fill out\" your order.

Decent selection of sauces are available as well, so if you enjoy a bit of heat it's there for you, but nothing too hot unfortunately.

The dine-in experience is too crowded and loud though and you'll find that children may be put off by the hustle and bustle.

Staffing is weird at this location...the employees walking around performing table service are always upbeat and helpful, while the counter staff...no matter the person, come across as bored, distracted and indifferent. Making you feel your order may not have been taken properly...and on occasion, it isn't."}
{"text":"One of my favorite to go Tex-Mex chain restaurants! I ordered the chicken bowl and chose the toppings I wanted...I like that they don't charge extra for guacamole! They were super quick and also added chips (which some places don't when you order the bowl). The restaurant was clean and staff was friendly. The only downside to here is they have a hot sauce bar versus salsa bar! I just skipped it and if I eat the chips I eat it with my bowl but I know paying for salsa is a negative for some."}
{"text":"Disappointed - I was served a glass of Charlotte's finest on tap water.  I have to say that is nasty in & of itself.  The table behind were regulars which meant that they continually paid attn to their drinks while ignoring us.  I was excited for an alternative to open that was a bit more cas than Cantina. Tortilla Flats was just a half step up from Moe's.  Unimpressed & uninspired by the burrito."}
{"text":"The food and service was good but the dinning space in my opinion was a little so small."}
{"text":"Ah not to thrilled with the quality of the food here, to me it felt cheap and chipotle is much better in my opinion and less pricier.  Awesome sauces tho food was nay to me."}
{"text":"Was here for a Yelp event. What a selection on the menu. Don't forget they have their Tuesday-Tijuana Tuesdaze special- Two Tacos, Chips and a drink for only $5.49. Did not want to forget their Throwback Thursdaze  for only $5.99.

Fiesta time here at Tijuana Flats. Glorious food and delicious too.
Chips with three dips all freshly made. All time favorite is the Guacamole.

Was not prepared for the Atomic Bomb that totally blew me away. Felt like a cartoon character with stem coming out of my ears after biting into the jalapenos poppers. I do not have an iron stomach or gut. Bring it the water hose. It was not so bad after the first bite. By the second and third bite I did not feel a thing. My immunity built up to the hot and spicy stuff.

The entrees were delicious. Chicken Tacos and Beef Burritos. Top of the evening with Churros and Cookie Dough Flautas.  Got my sugar fix for the evening.

Excellent service by the entire wait staff. Coming over to check if we needed more drinks and how the food was."}
{"text":"I'd been waiting for this place to open and was so excited to have a Tex mex place so close to home. I thought it was going to be more of a real restaurant, but it's sort of a glorified Taco Bell, order at the counter and wait for your name. More of a lunch place rather than date night out. I ordered a fish taco and it basically had McDonald's fish mc bites in them. Tasted bland. My boyfriend had a steak chimichanga which he thought tasted watery and bland. The margarita was good though. Staff was nice. Atmosphere was cool. Would give this place another try, but would definitely try something else."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to give Tijuana Flats a try and it fell flat.

Nothing special here and certainly nothing authentic other than a myriad of hot sauces.  A warehouse feel with open ceiling, hard cement floor and hard walls that resonate any conversations or noise emanating from the place.  We could not talk across the table with each other mostly because of a table of four in the booth behind us.

Menu is the standard array of tacos, burritos, chimichangas, quesadillas.  Also beer and a couple of desserts.  Not much going on here.

Met by a greeter who shared her favorites.  I wish restaurants would simply stop this practice.  It is cheesy and sometimes their favorites are simply the most expensive items on their menu.  Not so at Tijuana Flats, but her favorites were the jalapeno poppers (trite and found everywhere) and the quesadillas (no big deal).  Wow!  VERY impressive.

We entered this cave-line atmosphere just after 11:30AM, so it was pre-lunch crowd, a crowd which never materialized.  Another clue as to how popular this place is.  But even with a less than full capacity crowd, it took about 20 minutes for the kitchen to get our meal out.  So...not a place to go if you have to grab a quick bite.

There was an electronic special board flashing a couple of specials, one of which I ordered, the two double shelled tacos, exterior shell soft tortilla, interior crispy corn.  They were good and filling as they had cheese spread, meat, lettuce, tomato and cheese in them.  I had one steak and the other ground beef.  The ground beef was the best, lots of flavor.  The steak was so-so at best.  Very little flavor and for a dollar more, not worth it.  The ground beef was better than Taco Bell.

Wife's quesadilla was what you would expect.  How can you screw a quesadilla up?

I asked if Tijuana Flats was a California creation, because of the name and because they have, and push, whole wheat tortillas.  If you have not done whole wheat style of tortillas or breads, think about skipping them both.  In order for whole wheat to be somewhat edible it is loaded with sugar.  And even then it has the flavor or cardboard.

I once had a dinner cooked by a friend that was whole wheat tortillas stuffed with mashed sweet potatoes and baked...which was not only hard to eat, but was certainly horrible.

If you want to make your Tijuana Flats experience an even more  miserable and blah experience, go for the whole wheat.  Yucky for sure.

We won't be back, but some people will find it OK, so gave ti two stars as we have seen better."}
{"text":"This is the best Tijuana Flats I've been to. The management and staff were really attentive and the quality of the food was really good. I definitely plan on returning to this location."}
{"text":"I'm guessing from the crowd on a Friday evening that some people like the food, but we didn't. Over priced and not nearly as tasty as the menu descriptions would lead you to believe. 
Everyone was nice, the long line to order went quickly. The meals we ordered just weren't satisfying. My daughter couldn't even finish her quesadilla. We tried it, won't be back."}
{"text":"After visiting both this location and the Concord Mills one several times, I can definitely say that this one just has friendlier folk! You can tell by the median review score that the food is going to be good. Somewhere between a ho-hum family diner and the straight up counter culture atmosphere of places like The Common Market, Tijuana Flats falls comfortably in the middle.

Kind of a punk-rock vibe with harsh-neon colors everywhere. This one also has some UNCC Forty-Niner's flair to it as well which is greatly appreciated. The place is always clean and one thing I've noticed, no trash can to be found, the staff takes care of all that. They've found a comfortable hybrid between \"Order at the counter/seat yourself\" and \"Check in with the hostess/full service\" that works really well. You still order at the counter, but the peeps will be out and about making sure everything is to your liking, refilling drinks, and picking up trays for you.

Last night's visit I got the Flautas, and before we start, these AREN'T Taquitos. Flautas are the fluffy 'cousin' of taquitos, made with a burrito sized tortilla and are rolled with the whole tortilla while taquitos are rolled with a folded fortilla. Debate over, this is easily my new favorite at Tijuana. You get a nice crisp shell with all your fillings tucked tightly inside. Be sure to check out the hot sauce bar, even the whimpiest hot sauce patron should give some of the medium options a try (maybe stay away from the one's labeled like they're a death wish).

And of course, I got to mention that these guys give back often by supporting charities with fundraiser nights. Good on you guys, the fundraiser we had last night saw 20% revenue go towards SHRED for Gabe and Luke, a local CLT charity helping Families with extraordinary medical needs.

Can't wait to come back! While it looks like the Concord Mills location has lost most of it's customer service 'steam', this place is always ready and willing to please!"}
{"text":"Maybe I need to eat in to experience the food at it's best but my to go was blah. Also they have way too many sauces with to many descriptions that are confusing. Plus the to go containers for the sauces are smaller than froyo sample cups. Less is more guys"}
{"text":"For my 1st experience here, it was not good.  

I will start with the positives, the staff is friendly.  

Now the rest:  Reading the reviews, there seems to be a common experience of not knowing what to do when you walk in the door.  This is the 1st mistake of many made by Tijuana Flats.

The next mistake is the ordering process, the burrito comes with nothing and you need to pick your toppings, the issue is they do not list all of the toppings.  You have to ask if you can get guacamole or rice or vegetables.  

The worse of the issues is the taste of the food, everything tastes canned and not fresh.  For example, there is a lack of salt and lime in the salsa.  

All this being said, TF is overpriced for canned food.  If you are on E Blvd and are craving Mexican, go to Cantina 1511.  

Most places that have moved into this location have not survived, as of now, looks like TF will be another one that does not stack up to the competition on the same road."}
{"text":"The ice was the best part. I was very disappointed. I sad the chicken chipotle salad and my husband had one chicken and one beef tacos. We both sadly thought Taco Bell was better. I haven't eaten Taco Bell in over 6 years and that is how good it was."}
{"text":"Good food, ok price. Never been here before, so having someone come to me and answer questions was a nice touch. Kind of like the process better at Qdoba or Chipotle or Moes where you can watch them build your buritto so you can direct them exactly what and how much ingredients to include, especially when you're particular (picky) about that stuff like I am. Here they make it out of sight in the back and bring it out to you when it's done. Lost 2 stars because I asked for pico and there's an extra charge for it which I didn't know; cashier should have mentioned it when ringing up. I had to ask for an itemized receipt before knowing what I was charged for. Manager said he refunded the extra charge to my card but didn't give me a receipt, guess I'll check if it's on my card or not... Also, when my food came they included some plastic utensils, one of which was soiled, a fork looked like it was stabbed into some food that wasn't mine. They've only been open a couple weeks so I'll probably give them another chance to see if there's any improvement."}
{"text":"Heard great things about the one in Orlando and finally got to try the new one that opened here. It was delicious and would definitely recommend and go back to again. They have outside seating which was really Nice and the employees were so super friendly!"}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Tijuana Flats. It was my first visit and by no means my last! IT WAS GREAT! If you have not tried this place you must. It is small and quaint with a lot of atmosphere, very hip. The staff and service were top-notch and the food was great. I like Mexican/Tex-Mex food but don't eat it a lot because I don't care for the other Mexican restaurants around town; most of them are average to blah.....not this place. I love the hot sauce bar and the creative tag lines on each sauce. I can't wait to go back to Tijuana Flats, in fact I just may take my husband there this evening. Twice in one day, it's that good!"}
{"text":"No different from Taco Bell ! I had higher expectations. I will not be returning ! I don't even want anything else from here ! They have good crushed ice !"}
{"text":"First of all, the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating.  However, the food was just okay. I ordered a salad and guacamole. The salad was wet and wilted while the guacamole had no taste at all. I could tell the guac was handmade but not one ingredient tasted as it should have.  Very bland. On a positive note, the iced tea was terrific."}
{"text":"This is a perfectly nice fast food Tex Mex place.
Order from the cashier and have the food delivered to your table. 
Very friendly and attentive staff made several visits to check on us.
Nice outside patio seating"}
{"text":"A friend and I recently went, since we had a buy one get one coupon. Thank goodness for the coupon as I would never pay $25 for four tacos and a couple drinks. The tacos were just so so, nothing special. The queso for the chips was nacho cheese. If you are thinking of going here Id highly consider salsaritas heck even Taco Bell over this place. If I had to name a positive I guess Id say the soda was good and cold? What a failure this place is."}
{"text":"I love this place! They serve beer and have a really cool hot sauce bar, on top of some amazing Tex-mex. my favorite hot sauce is the don't be a chicken shit followed closely by the jalape√±o smack my ass and call me Sally. Those are not jokes they are the actual names of the sauces. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I think their burritos could be better. Go with the chimis or the enchiladas."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was great. Taco Tuesday is what I will be doing going forward. $5.50 for two tacos, chips and a drink. Nice quick family dinner out for understood $25. Our experience was great. There was one employee who went above and beyond to make sure we were good even after we got out food. Everyone was nice. Service goes a long way in my book."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been compelled to write a review but here it is! THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!! Like most people, my wife and I have eaten at moes and salsarita'sas well. But this place for one sells alcohol (beer, wine etc), AND THEY HAVE A HOT BAR :). I LOVE HOT SAUCE, and this place gives you a BOATLOAD of self serve hot-sauces to choose from. The food is served in nice portions. Nice as in just the right sized
portion. I like chipotle and all, but their portion sizes will leave you feeling just about half past dead. But back to Tijuana flats, they have a nice sized menu, nice little beer selection (corona, Samuel Adams, Dos Equis , Foothills brewery etc etc). Their queso and nacho combination is really good to. Just be advised that their chips come litely salted and peppered to add more flavor. One last thing, Monday's and Wednesday, they have drink specials on just about all of their drinks. Just go! Trust me, you'll love it!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch . It has an awesome vibe and amazing burritos. Bring the milk cause it's about to get spicy. Great hot sauce bar selection to chose from . Pretty good price for lunch . Definitely beats chipotle."}
{"text":"I really like Tijuana Flats, but I don't loveeeee it. BUT if you are a hot sauce lover then this place is like your Mecca. There are a TON of sauce options all available at a sauce bar, from the basics to twists of honey and ginger, etc. there's a lot to choose from. My husband, the king of hot sauce, approves heartily. Overall to me however, it's just average yummy for some quick tex-mex. I like the chips & salsa, don't like that I have to pay extra for them. The entrees and apps are a little blas√©, and I wasn't a huge fan of their taquitos, which are usually one of my favorite dishes at a place like this.  Overall good service, fun atmosphere.... but I'd rather have Chipotle all things considered (even though it irks me to pay for chips there too haha.)"}
{"text":"Well one could say that the University area now has more of a lock on the faux-Mex cuisine thanks to Qdoba, Chipotle, and now Tijuana Flats popping up all within walking distance of each other.
 
Thanks to a yelp event last year, I visited the now-defunct East Blvd location so I had a notion of how the place works and how the food tastes. This location seems a little smaller than the East Blvd location but definitely still has most of the attitude, and I mean that in a good way. TJ's walls are covered in graffiti art, sassy bumper stickers, and staff pictures. It's definitely a good fit for the university area.
 
I'd been eager to stop by ever since its opening and thanks to a severe taco craving, I made a visit. I was immediately greeted and walked up to the to-go order side. The woman taking my order informed me of the day's special- it was Tijuana Tuesdaze (which I already knew and means two tacos, chips and drink for under $6) so I put my order in for two chicken tacos and decided to go for the guac on the side (which is extra, duh!). As I waited for my order to come out, I got to see the famed hot sauce bar. Seriously, if you fancy yourself a hot sauce fan, TRY ALL THE SAUCES. There's plenty of seating inside to not make you feel like you're sitting on top of anybody else and there's also a small patio area out front.
 
The staff seemed really upbeat and willing to break down the explanations for any menu items. I witnessed this first hand as two people were completely confused by their chimichangas and the 'make it wet' (TWSS!) option. As for beverages, they offer the standard soda/tea options as well as margaritas, sangria, and beer.
 
My order came out and the guy who brought it to me made sure he read it back and confirmed my order. I opened up my container and was pleasantly surprised by how neat and delicious everything looked. Be not concerned, for the taco special they do not skimp on the taco size! Everything tasted just as good as I remembered and I will be frequenting Tijuana's on Tuesdays and any other time the taco craving hits!"}
{"text":"I tried out Tijuana Flats for the first time thanks to a yelp event. As a fan of Mexican food, I'm always willing to try as many places as possible. This place has a different vibe than your typical Mexican place. You won't find the typical cheesy Mexican restaurant decor at this place. They have brightly colored graffiti art covering the walls and tongue-in-cheek wall art. 

As part of the yelp event, I got to try the tijuana trio, jalapeno poppers, chicken soft tacos with rice and black beans, chicken flautas, beef burrito, and cookie dough flautas and cinnamon sugar churros.

The tijuana trio (salsa, guac, queso) is a great appetizer. The chips are lightly seasoned and the guacamole is surprisingly delicious. I say 'surprisingly' because sometimes chain Mexican restaurants can make bland guac. Not the case here, though. I didn't try the salsa or the queso because the guac was holding my taste buds hostage.

Jalapeno poppers were delish but HOT. Don't think because there's fried dough, sour cream and cheese that the heat is diminished because it is not.

The chicken soft tacos and black beans were good but the rice was a let down as it was over cooked, as in crunchy rice pieces. This may have been due to the size of the event and having to prepare a large amount so quickly so I won't knock it too much. 

Chicken flautas and beef burrito were OK but not anything I'd order on my next visit.

My favorite part was dessert. The cookie dough flautas (with chocolate syrup) were decadent and I'm still thinking about them. SO GOOD and I implore you ORDER THEM if you go. The churros were good but I've had better at other establishments.

Overall, I will be coming back and trying out the other locations (there are more TF locations coming to an area near you in NC!)."}
{"text":"Y'all this restaurant is awesome, let me tell you why:

SERVICE:
  The service here is phenomenal. I have never encountered a rude employee or unpleasant experience. They remind me of chic-fil-a employees but more genuine. Every time I come, they always ask me if I would like an infant sling for my babies car seat. They ask me!!! I don't have to ask them, or find one myself. Although it is a quick service restaurant, they are very attentive; bringing refills, stopping by the table making sure everything is good, take trays etc.

FOOD:
  Food is pretty good. All I have ever had are the tacos here because taco Tuesday (will write about that more in a minute). But the fish tacos are my favorite but they also have 2 chicken (chipotle and blackened), beef, steak, and refried/ black bean. They also have it where if you purchase a large dip (salsa, queso, quac) it is endless. They bring you a container of it, but will bring you more to take home or eat there if you like (with more chips)!

VALUE:
  For the money, this place is awesome! I love coming in Tuesday's for taco Tuesday (like mentioned above) this includes 2 tacos (extra for steak and fish), chips and a drink!!! Add on a large size of salsa and I can easily make two meals out of this. They also have throwback Thursday which is a burrito, chips and a drink for $5.99, but I have yet to come to this (not really a burrito person).

CLEANLINESS:
  Every time I come here this place is either very clean or there is someone out here working to make it that way. Like I said earlier, they are in the dining room a lot so it just makes sense that they are cleaning it while they are out here.


SUMMARY:
 This place is awesome, and hard to find this level of service, quality, and value at a quick service restaurant. I am very impressed here and look forward to trying more of their menu."}
{"text":"Overall a pleasant experience. First time trying this place out & went for the Taco Tuesday promotion. Unique & eclectic setting with a great playlist. Thoroughly enjoyed the sauce bar. Ordered mega tacos & between what was advised & what was received I'd like to have had a shell busting portion size, this is my only criticism. Would recommend for a quick tasty lunch bite."}
{"text":"I've seen this place somewhere on the south side of Charlotte and always wanted to go but never made time. I finally got to go because now it's 10 minutes away from my home at its newly built location in Concord :)

I've been hear at least 3 or 4 times in the last two months and every time, the food has been great....no really!! Lol. The wall art is really funky and creative and the staff are all really nice and helpful. I always get either a steak or chicken norito bowl. My ultimate go to.

Love this place!"}
{"text":"I like SalsaRita and Moe's much better. I like to see the item I'm adding to my meal. I felt rushed ordering. Not my kind of place."}
{"text":"Affordable and really great tasting food ! The employees go above and beyond every time we've been there! There are specials through out the week. We go at least once a week! 
I recommend the bangin chicken tostadas and the burrito special on Thursdays ! The hot sauce bar is awesome too with chips !!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since had been here and it was even better then before. Customer service is as good as it gets!  Food comes out quickly, correctly and delicious.  We tried the queso and it Uh-mazing!!  Look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I went there last Thursday around 6pm and the place was packed with a line out the door. I liked that there was a server waiting at the door to hand you a menu to look over why you waited. The biggest downside was the line and how long it was taking them to accept orders at the cash register. It was obvious that it was more the people ordering than the cashiers. I got my food to-go and I was extremely surprised at how quickly I got it. Also while waiting for my food, I watched the manager, a lady that I didn't catch her name, multi-task like no ones business. She helped everywhere and seemed like she was everywhere. As for the food, I agree with another review, it should be compared more to Chipotle or Qdoba and I thought it was delicious. I got the Bangin Chicken Burrito, \"Wet\" with queso and it was huge and still tasted good after the drive home. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great service! Great music! Great food and really cheap! THE ICE IS AMAZING!! ice ice baby!!"}
{"text":"So this was an interesting experience as I came over with a co worker to try it out as she was tired of moes and I am always down to try out the new guy when tacos are involved.  They have just opened up I wanna say just a couple weeks ago and you can tell they are really trying to impress and to be honest it seemed a little over the top as we were just about to finish ordering when apparently a new customer was about to walk in the door and the girl taking our order barked an order to another employee who was sweeping to hustle over to the door to greet the new guest and open the door for them.  The poor girl must have been terrified of not accomplishing the task and literally stopped sweeping and ran over to the door completely flushed and breathlessly greeted the customer who seemed startled at the approach and a bit confused as to why it was so serious it was quite comical although its concerning as this seemed to be the general mood of the store that all the hourly employees were walking (and running) on eggshells afraid to mess up. 

Anyway, after ordering I guess I missed the part where they asked about salsa because when my food came out and there was none to go with the chips and no salsa bar in sight (although there is a hot sauce bar with a ton of options I just didn't want to dip my chips in hot sauce constantly but hey maybe that's your thing) I asked the girl for a side of salsa and she replied with \"well we generally ask that when you order but ill get you some if you would like me to\" - why yes yes I would like salsa as that is what I just asked for lol. 

I don't know guys it was just kinda a weird experience which I think was mostly due to them working out some kinks from being so new or something I guess but the general attitude of the place left me thinking I would probable just stick to moes where it feels a little more laid back and the salsa comes free and without reprimand."}
{"text":"Tacos Tuesday's are the move at TFlats! Great service and friendly staff. The hard shell tacos are great size, filled with tons of meat and cheese. Queso as a side is consistently good and you get plenty of chips. Hot sauce bar is tasty and fun to try different flavors."}
{"text":"I was so happy to see Tijuanas come to Charlotte as I was a big fan in Florida and Virginia Beach. For this specific location I was especially impressed. The server was super friendly and attentive. I could tell they put a lot of attention to the food being prepared carefully too.  We always get the black bean flautas so I can't speak to their burritos, but GET THESE. Crispy tortillas that you can smother in queso, guacamole, lettuce, onion, tomato and sour cream. We split these with a side of rice and beans and add a side of chips and salsa which is a generous portion. All that and a drink was $12. This is by far my favorite fast food Mexican place as the food is consistently good and I'm over the cold burrito line other places offer. 


Finally I think when evaluating restaurants, it is important to assess it based on what type of place it is trying to be. Therefore comparing Tijuana Flats to Cantina 1511 isn't even fair as they are offering two different dining experiences.  TFs is fast food that is tasty but adds some extra perks to the regular grab a bite places, such as a more playful and entertaining ambiance (and nice patio outdoor seating), options for alcohol, and servers who bring your food, refills your drinks, and clears your table."}
{"text":"Very friendly and engaged management.  Food was okay, but not great.  Clean eating area.  I had a chicken burrito.  Maybe try something different."}
{"text":"I've visited TF a couple of times now.  Both times the service has been outstanding, the food was delicious and the hot sauce bar was amazing.  Go and thank me later."}
{"text":"As always, the food didn't disappoint. I tried something new this time, and got the burrito. I didn't have to wait long at all, and the customer service was great! Will be coming back again when I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times have been really good.  This latest time, my coworker's meal was messed up but they went out of their way to make it right.  The food is great, the service is good and the price is right.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Meh.... Been here twice.   Very underwhelming.   The entire model needs to change.   When you have a price point of $9-$14 for lunch you need to provide higher levels of service. 

1- stop handing menus at the door. This confuses people in thinking they can sit down and order.   Everyone says \"oh, I guess I have to go up to the counter to order\".  

2- this leads to ringing people up before the meal, and if you pay with credit asking for a tip before the meal has even started.  Both my visits deserved no tip, although I left 20%.  

3 - don't make customers get up and go to the counter for a refill.   You are very quick to offer a drink while reading over the menu, but why must the service stop at that point.  

4 - the overall food quality has decreased significantly since the corporate take over.   Chintzy amounts of meat, up charges for everything.  Overall a worse food presentation.

Overall, if you want $9-$14 for lunch, you need to act like it, and serve quality food."}
{"text":"Amazing food and incredible service! Taco Tuesdays are my favorite. Shout out to Brandy who is always super sweet and attentive!"}
{"text":"Being from Orlando I never thought I would be able to eat here on a regular basis! I really love Tijuana flats! The food is yummy and the people are nice!"}
{"text":"First and last visit this evening.  I ordered one chicken enchilada and one cheese.  I choose the blackened chicken, as I was told that it had more seasoning.  Both were cold and bland.  No flavor whatsoever  The meal came with tortilla chips.  They lacked crunch as well as flavor.  Definitely not what I expect for Tex-Mex .  There was a hot sauce bar, but it was all bottled hot sauce, no fresh choices or salsa. There were TINY paper cups that held about a teaspoon of the sauce, definitely not user friendly for dipping.  After a few bites of cold flavorless food I left and headed over to Chipolte.  For 0.10 cents more I soon was enjoying a fresh flavorful warm steak burrito.
The store was very clean and the employees were all very friendly."}
{"text":"Had a very enjoyable experience. Upon entry, the manager held the door for us and asked if we had dined with them before. (No.) He then showed us a menu and explained how to order. Cool, I like instructions in a new environment. We sat at a table and someone took our drink order and brought them right away. Small but decent beer selection. I had a can of Dale's Pale Ale = aaah refreshing! They plan on having 3 NC craft beers on tap. The guacamole = good. The salsa = just okay. The queso = good but a bit runny. I like that they put salt and pepper on their chips. My Fresh Salad with steak and fresh jalapenos was great with the avocado dressing. At first I was a little scared of the whole wheat tortilla bowl, but it was delicious, crispy and not greasy at all. Service was on the money. The hot sauce bar is a cool feature and the decor is insane (in a good way). Love the mural of what my kids called the \"Frankenstein Zombie\". Really nice selection of kids meals. If my kids are a barometer, they ate everything and they rarely do.... In a nutshell (or maybe taco shell), good food, even better service."}
{"text":"I guess I'm just not the Tex-mex,hipster spot type. I was willing to try anyway. I went for the simple staple Quesadilla with steak. My honey who loves this type joint had a burritto. Between the two of us, neither thought the food was very good. The steak was minimal for the price and the flavor was as bland as possible. The guac, ugh the guac was uneventful. I was suprised that I didn't hear, \"Welcome to Tijuana Flats!!!!\" like the carbon copy does. I really wanted to like this place but just couldn't. I will say that the decor was interesting and cool. The staff was quick and informative. This is probably a great spot but for $25+ I need to taste the great in the food and this just didn't have it."}
{"text":"Not at all impressed with the food. The tortilla for my quesadilla was overcooked, and my granddaughters taco was bland. The staff was nice and the decor is cool."}
{"text":"I eat at TF about once a month, and have had nothing but good experiences. The Tuesday and Thursday specials are a good bargain, and the food and ambiance are certainly a step above Taco Bell. Certainly not fancy, and I am not a big fan of their sauce bar (I have tried several varieties and still haven't found any I really like), but it is a consistently friendly environment with good food, which puts it in my food rotation."}
{"text":"Great food , healthy alternative to fast food . I have never been disappointed with my meals every time I dine for lunch or dinner . I prefer the rice bowls and they are quite tasty and refreshing . If you are counting calories and want to go the healthy route they have you covered with some dishes that are vegan or low in calories . The owners and managers are attentive to your needs , I have no complaints !"}
{"text":"Mixed emotions! My husband and I love Tijuana Flats- we would drive to up Concord to eat at there when the one on East Blvd closed. So, we know what to expect from this restaurant. We have been to this new location in Ballentyne 5 or 6 times since it opened and it has continued to decline on each visit.

The food is good. Very fresh. 

But the service really needs some work. We are use to great customer service, drink refills, salsa refills, anything you need.  The people seem very nice, nothing against them. They are just not trained in the Tijuana Flats way. I hope this changes because we want this restaurant to be successful!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped yesterday and ordered a Chimichanga to go.  When I got home I discovered a burrito in my bag.  What?"}
{"text":"We love coming here once a week I have to admit it's mostly on Tues. or Thurs for their deals on tacos or burritos.  We also enjoy seeing the same employees each visit Kayla usually is the one that helps us out when we order she is so patient with the kids.  Like tonight we put the kids names in for our order and tonight they couldn't decide between the two so she put both names in.  Sure enough they called both names when the order came out the kids loved it.  And let's not forget the food is awesome too!"}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos in Charlotte. It's clean, staff is friendly, service is fast. Been going here twice a week for almost a year and never had a bad experience. The guacamole is also delicious and the sauce bar has good spread from mild to super hot. Can't beat the price on Taco Tuesday and Throwback Thursday...."}
{"text":"Erika and Nikki were such great hosts. Tijuana flats held a yelp event for us tonight and it turned out great! The food was so fresh and yummy. Chicken flautas were my favorite. They have the biggest selection of hot sauces I've ever seen!!!!! This place is brand new and right across from the hospital in the university area! Great for college students, reasonably priced and super fun and clean atmosphere! Take 85 to Harris blvd, it's tucked down in a shopping center! If you like Mexican it's a step above moes  little patio if the weather isn't as hot as it's been! Ahhh just wait for fall!  get your booty into Tijuana's you'll be happy you came. It's quick and tasty and the staff is sook friendly"}
{"text":"Not a fan of the food. The decor was very cool, the staff attentive but nothing majo about the food. Save your $ and go to Moes"}
{"text":"We just moved here from California and we are trying to find a good spot. Today we went to Tijuana Flats in Concord, NC and it was delish. I will have to say the service was exceptional everyone was great. The stand out for us was Kayla she is spot on with her customer service. Thank you Kayla for the great experience!!"}
{"text":"Just went here today for their soft opening. It was great, everyone that was working there was really friendly. The menu is great and there are a lot of options here. The burrito is HUGE. I also got the bowl which was very filling and I saved half for dinner. My favorite part of it was their hot sauce bar. I love hot sauce and there was so many options which was great. We also got a starter with queso and guac which the queso was pretty delicious. I loved how they had a soft opening and they had free meals so they just get feedback and learn what they need to improve which is awesome because they actually care about their customers and how to make it better for them. I will def be going back again."}
{"text":"Food was OK. I came for.lunch and order blackened chicken no borrito which is borrito in a bowl made with rice, meat and toppings. The food was just average was not impressed. The chicken was very bland, small and almost thought I had a vegetarian bowl. The staff was polite but stood around in a circle talking to each other most of the time. They say its a full service but when you walk in you have to.order and pay at the counter. The food is made i n the kitchen where u can't see it unlike other places. I don't know why they call themselves waitress and request a tip when they dknyo do anything. Kinda confused at the concept. This is a fast food joint that's like Chickfila having waitress?!?! Maybe this place is better at night. I don't know. They have a lot of beer and drinks optionsm prices look good! I would suggest trying this for the beverages. Also they have a lot of hot sauce a to try and they are good and you can purchase them to take home. I probably won't revisit. Not impressed and food was just OK. I will say bathrooms were very clean!"}
{"text":"Good food, great price, even better service.  

In town and looking for something different, this place is a winner.  The manager met us at the door with a smile, explained the menu, and welcomed us.  The person at the register was super friendly, took her time to explain what came with what, and was overall great.  

An awesome experience, and a place I'd repeat."}
{"text":"Ok, let's start off by saying the food is delicious. What makes this place really shine though is the customer service. The people who work here are consistently friendly and helpful. They're always asking if you need anything, holding the door open for you, and are generally pleasant. I have two young kids who tend to be messy in restaurants. Every time I go to clean up after them, the staff insists that they will take care of it and not to worry. This location also offer free kids meals on the weekends (Concord Mills does NOT, FYI).  Child friendly restaurants are always a win in my book."}
{"text":"An amazing experience all around! Service was unbelievably great from being personally greeted at the door (not yelled at impersonally like when you visit a similar establishment that rhymes with \"Joe's\")...to the sincere and very helpful young lady who took our order, down to the very end of our visit when the staff made sure our cups were full for the road and bagged us up some chips and salsa to go without us even asking! Then there was the first-timers complimentary salsa, chips, and hot-sauce tasting tray, all delivered and explained by what I assumed to be the restaurant manager. Food and atmosphere were awesome and the price was right making this a spot I'd love to return to again and again! Glad to toot the horn of a great establishment when it is so richly deserved! @tijuanaflats, y'all keep doing what you're doing...because you rock!"}
{"text":"This place rules. Try the hot sauce bar (highly recommend the bee sting habanero and honey hot sauce!) Great service also."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch to go. I ordered the chicken flauta. Large portions and very tasty. I was surprised at how large the entree was. Awesome customer service - attentive, friendly and courteous. I like how they repeat your order back to you when they bring you your bag. The place was pretty full for a Tuesday afternoon. I'd return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend sings the praises of this chain, and he's not wrong. The food is delicious and the ideas original. This new location is on point! Service is amazing and very convenient location right here in Ballantyne. Great work again Tijuana!"}
{"text":"Can I give them 10 stars?? My fiance and I tried this place for the first time last night and we were overly impressed. 
The menu has TONS to offer at very affordable prices. Check out their daily specials!
The food was delicious and plentiful portions... have I mentioned the affordable prices? All natural/very fresh ingredients too. Can't beat that!
The service was outstanding. It's so refreshing to go out someplace where the staff is friendly and helpful. I love it when I go somewhere and the people I interact can put a smile on my face. This is that place!
The hot sauce bar is great. Tons of choices, self service and way better than any hot sauce I've had before and I LOVE hot sauce...I eat it on everything. 
Thank you for the awesome service and amazing food last night guys. You guys definitely earned repeat customers and we will be sure to spread the word!"}
{"text":"Okay food with 5 star service - it's not what you would expect from a fast casual restaurant but they have possibly the best service I have ever receive in any restaurant in Charlotte. 

Waitress greeted  us at the door and while it's self seating and order at the register, she took the time to walk us through the menus and tell us their special - $5.49 for two tacos, a side if chips and a drink! (Every Tues) I also noticed they have a burrito special on Thurs $5.99 for a burrito, chips and a drink. Both great deals. The employees continued to check on us refilling our drink and getting us anything we needed. When trying to find a place to throw out my trash when we finished, an employee assured me they would take care of everything . That statements sums up my experience at Tijuana Flats.

As for the food, it was generally okay. However, the guacamole was so good that at $3.99 for a large container with chips, I don't think I will ever buy it from the grocery store again!  The salsa while not traditional Mexican style, which I typically prefer, I thought was great too. At $2.99 for a large container with chips, again I think it would be crazy not to pick this up over the grocery store kinds that can cost more than that for salsa alone. The tacos were as good as any other fast casual restaurant but nothing that would draw me back there on their own. Not bad just nothing special."}
{"text":"I was ecstatic when I saw this location was opening, as I was a fan of the now closed Huntersville location. 

Food-wise it is just about as good as the other location was, with a few minor differences. The tacos are large and served either in soft or hard shells with your choice of the typical fillings and toppings. No complaints here. The flautas used to be my favorite but here they aren't as good as I remembered. I think part of the problem is that they were very sparse with the toppings, such as lettuce, onions, etc. What little there was was under the flautas instead of on top, so the heat (and grease) kind of wilted everything. The tostadas were the same way, with very little in the way of toppings. The chips and salsa are outstanding, to the point of it's worth getting an extra order just to take home with you. Don't get me wrong, what food I did get tasted great but just not exactly as great as I'd hoped.  

Service is fast once you order. You order at a counter and then they bring it to you. The order takers have been very friendly and accommodating to any order modifications each time I've been. Here's a hint...if you're a teacher, military, police or fire, you get a 10% discount.

I almost forgot the hot sauce bar. They have about a dozen kinds for you to sample and little cups with lids for you to use if you're taking out. It's pretty cool. 

I'm still a fan. It's on my way home from work so I'm sure I'll be hitting them up for takeout quite often."}
{"text":"The inside is generically wacky, as if designed by Martha Stewart after taking peyote. It's complete with made up meal size names, mexican style popart, multi-colored lights, Sugar Ray playing on the radio (yes it was). Customer service is on par with Chik-fil-a, as I had my water filled up and trash taken away, granted I was the only one there at 4pm on a Friday.

The chicken and bean burrito wasn't bad. I did not NOT like it. It's the first burrito I've ever had with olives.

It's great if you want to bring your kids somewhere before grabbing a drink with your bros at Icehouse."}
{"text":"Hot Sauce!!! So many options to choose from. A little secret is I typically make a few trips carrying sauces back to the table.  Unfortunately the location near me on East Blvld closed. I needed to run an errand in the university area so made sure I visited Tijuana. 

Enough of feeling sad for because this place is with the drive. The customer service exceeds any expectations. Some of the best customer service you will find. Greeted at the door and you walk up to the counter to order. So many wonderful options. Fliautas, Burritos and many other options. How do you decide? You can't go wrong but make sure you get the queso and the guac. After you order go grab some hot sauces and sit at the table. The friendly staff will bring out your foods  Very  attentive and happily will refill your drinks and make sure you are taken care of."}
{"text":"I remember there was a Tijuana Flats up in the university a few years back, don't know if it is related, but I did miss them during lunch times at the office.  East Blvd is a good new home for this tex mex restaurant.  They do things a bit differently where you order at the counter and they bring it out to you once the food is ready.

The atmosphere inside has tons of stuff to look at, especially the crazy celebrity photos on the wall near the register line.

Definitely should try their hot sauce bar with stuff ranging from okay to \"death\".... I just like looked at their hotness markings cause the death icon is a black smiley face with two x's across the face's eyes.

I had the \"no\"rrito chicken bowl with everything on it.  Pretty darn good and decent kick - I could have added more heat, but decided to play it safe that evening.  Also had Tripple C Brewing's Baby Maker on tap so I was a pretty happy camper after dinner.

Servers and cashiers are super nice and really check on you if you need any refills or plates cleared.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch to try the place out.  I left unimpressed.

Once entering, I was a bit confused.  The ordering counter is in the back with tables in front of that.  An employee greeted me and gave me a menu directed me on where the line forms.  

The entire restaurant is a bit dark which is odd considering how much colored lighting abounds in the place.  Even the ordering counter is dark.  So you place your order, give your name, pay and someone brings out your food to your table.

I ordered a chicken burrito bowl and an order of chips and queso.  There are like 20 different kinds of salsas on the hot bar for your choosing.  The 3 I tried left me craving more heat even though they said \"Hot\".  The burrito bowl and queso had two things in common....lots of salt and they were both kind of meh.  The burrito bowls at Chipotle and Picante are much better than this.   

The queso at TF looked and tasted like it came out of a can.  The chips were the best thing in this order and started using them with my burrito bowl.

Aside from that, the staff was friendly and helpful and they have 2 craft beers on tap here, currently one from Lonerider and one from Triple C.  There are lots of other bottled beer selections.  

Overall, staff and beer are not enough for me to want to come back.  I'll stick to Moe's up the street."}
{"text":"Decided we wanted to try this place out on a Sunday for lunch. Me, my wife, and 7 month old strolled in and had to walk right back out. They weren't very busy yet and only seemed to have 2 high chairs which were already in use. For what seemed like a popular place I would expect more than 2 high chairs for family's but maybe that's just me."}
{"text":"Service and staff - superb
Food  - super awesome

visited TFlats today for lunch with family.. ordered chimichanga (megajuana chicken), Bean taco and cheese quesadilla.. the quantity was good and loved the taste. will come again..must visit for tex mex food..will recommend megajuana"}
{"text":"I loved this place! The staff is always a delight to interact with. The food is always outstanding and I am in love with the hot sauce bar! I order the burrito bowls and am never disappointed in them. On top of all the amazing food the decor is dope! I have been to these chain in Flordia and never a disappointment."}
{"text":"All you can eat chips and queso.  You can come with a group of four and each chips and cheese for about $1/person.  You can get this and order food and drench it in queso.  I accidentally spilled queso coming from my chips and queso on my burrito bowl.  It was unavoidable but it improved the burrito bowl.

Eating here is a great idea - plenty of food and a simple tex-mex style.  You need to make sure whatever you are getting has queso on it.  This is the must have flavor ingredient in my opinion.  Without it the burrito bowl would have been a flop.  The flautas are a crowd favorite.  Easy to dip and plenty of comfort.

Everyone working here is nice.  Beyond just hello, but super helpful.  I am convinced they are brainwashed in some sort of service industry cult.  I wish everyone at every restaurant was abducted by this cult.  They aren't creepy helpful, they are just the right amount of helpful.  Excellent management in my opinion if the folks are so cheery.

All you can eat chips and queso, all you can eat chips and queso, and all you can eat chips and queso.

They have a bunch of hot sauces if you are a chili head go nuts.  I literally mean go crazy - lose your mind with all the choices.  It is a bit overwhelming but the onset of insanity will calm you.

All you can eat chips and queso for good measure."}
{"text":"Went here for to get take out for lunch.  I had to call in my order because the website had a glitch although my co-worker was able to put his through.  When I went to pick up our food mine was ready however his was not.  The manager actually has to sort through a mile long chain of tickets coming out of the register to find it.  And then it took 25 minutes to get. 
We had gotten an order of queso to share and both agreed it was not worth the calories.  You can get better queso out of a jar at the grocery store.  My toasted burrito was not toasted hardly at all and the meat was dry.  In fact everything inside the burrito was dry.  He had ordered one chicken taco and one beef taco but the website had messed up his order and he received two beef tacos.  Both of which he said were dry and tasteless. 
We both agreed we will not return for another meal."}
{"text":"I would always pass by this place saying to myself I'll go one day.  Well that one day was this weekend with a friend of mine.  She had been to Tijuana Flats in Florida and I was a complete newbie.  The experience was great.  I ordered a veggie-bean burrito on whole wheat and it was pretty good.  The beans are not cooked in lard and for us vegetarians that's music to our ears.  I did end up ordering a side of queso for my burrito because I needed it to be a bit more saucy, personal preference.  I really did like the sauce bar they had ranging from sweet to super spicy sauces to add to your dish.  I would definitely go back there again and try something new because its a very chill place.  I found it to be a cross between Taco Bell & a traditional Mexican restaurant.  Anyone looking to try a new Mexican place with a bit of flare, I'd suggest you check this out."}
{"text":"My sisters and I checked out Tijuana Flats for an early dinner last week. 

Overall good experience.

Orders are placed at the register and prepared in the back. I prefer Chipotle's and Qdoba's right-in-front-of-you prep but okay...

Two of us had the Throwback Thursdaze special for $5.99. The other ordered tostitos (but she thought she was ordering a quesadilla).

The TT special consisted of a Tijuana burrito, chips, and a drink.

The burritos are customizable. I had mine in a hemp tortilla. Delicious.

The table we sat at was a rectangle for four. There was enough room on the table top but I felt like I could use a bit more elbow room between me and Sister One.

I was afraid of the famed hot sauce bar. Wussy old me tried ONE very mild sauce. The more daring Sister One tried a few of of the sauces including a Very Hot one. Sister Two and I laughed like loons at Sister One as she wiped her runny eyes and nose.

The staff checked on us every so often, offering refills on drinks, removing our trash, and asking if there was anything we needed.

A nice evening out and not a lot of money spent.

I'll go back."}
{"text":"Really glad they're here.  Enjoyed them in FL, now glad to have one close!  Staff was amazing, would return just for them.  Super kid friendly and helpful.  Super pleasant!  Restaurant was super clean and the food excellent.  Good value for the price paid.  We had nachos and burritos.  The hot sauce bar was really cool.  Something for everyone.  Great music, tv's, comfortable seats.  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Setting was pretty cool. Customer service was excellent staff Met me at the door. I give them 3 stars because the food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Is this the only Tex-Mex Restaurant that I've been to? I can't remember. Nonetheless TF separates themselves with an extensive hot sauce selection that the hubs can't get enough of. He's a fan of all things spicy (duh...he married me right?!?) but I can only tolerate a little bit of spice and a lot of sweet so I'm also able to find something here that's enjoyable. The list of items available to add to your burrito, taco, or burrito bowl are limited, but the quality of the items gain ground with true flavor. It's rare that you find true flavor in toppings nowadays! They even have beer on tap! Score!! The decor is crazy!! I couldn't imagine bringing young children here at night...hell I almost had nightmares with the murals seemingly coming out of the wall! But very cool though! Seems to be a mix between hippie chic and The Fan (Robert De Niro/Wesley Snipes). The only lackluster thing about this place is their chips...they could stand some improving....kinda meh. But service is great so just dunk the chips in the great sauces and call it a night!"}
{"text":"Nice and friendly staff. Very clean inside. The chimichanga was great all the ingredients taste fresh and real. If you eat in the staff will bring your food as well as take your plate when you are done. Great for kids as well. All at close to a fast food price."}
{"text":"I'm glad Tijuana Flats is back in this area! I hated that the other locations closed a few years ago. 

I went in today and got the veggie burrito. It was just like I remembered from other locations. The food was fresh and tasty. I love the hot sauce bar. The hottest sauce, which contains jolokia pepper, was hot but didn't make me hiccup like some hot sauces do. 

Tijuana Flats is a bit more upscale than other TexMex restaurants like Moes or Qdoba. For one, you get your burrito served on a plate, not in a wrapper. You order at the register, but someone brings out your food and they come around to refill your drink. It's kind of mixture of a fast food place and dine-in restaurant.

Overall, it's a nice place for lunch. Cheery atmosphere and good food at a good price."}
{"text":"Love Tijuana Flats... been eating at other locations for over a decade now. This new location's food is as good as the others. Service is great and lots of vegetarian/vegan options. Right now, they offer enchiladas as a limited time offer - they are so good, they should be put on the menu permanently."}
{"text":"Love TF. Extensive hot sauce bar, fresh food, huge portions. And kids eat free weekends! We recommend the flautas, nachos, and chimis, but everything is delicious. 

They are also a good company-- even way back when I first encountered them in their native Florida, they do fundraising events and other community building activities.

Large selection of beers, too! Excellent food, quickly served, with a fun and quirky decor."}
{"text":"The service was 5 stars. We were greeted to an open door and a welcome. We were then handed menus and given the daily specials. 
We came in with the lunch crowd and we were served quickly and accurately. Throughout the meal we were constantly checked on. It was hard to tell who was management and who wasn't, since everyone seemed to care how we were doing. I will definitely be back. The 2 tacos for lunch were amazing. And they have tons of sauces to top with from light to medium, not much for us that like them really hot. But still a good flavor with decent heat. 3 of us ate for 20 bucks. One of my new favorites on the blvd and cheaper than most. The easiest way to put it is chic-fil-a service with a tex mex menu."}
{"text":"Me and my husband came here and had a good experience. First time wasn't that great due to being charged left and right without being told. We walked in and the service at the counter was really friendly. I got the two tacos with beef with rice and beans and my husband got the burrito with chips. We also got the chip appetizers with the three dips. 

The chips and dips was good. The chips weren't that warm but that's ok. It came with salsa, guacamole and cheese dip. Out of the three I would say I liked the cheese dip the best. My tacos were good and filling. I liked the rice better than the beans. My husband liked his burrito but he's curious to try something else next time. 

Overall, we would come here again and you can't beat taco tuesdays."}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was pretty good.  The servers were staying on top of their service. Pretty good experience!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the ordering style of a Panera type restaurant. I would recommend the flautas with ground beef! Yum! My husband really likes the nachos. I had the taco salad with chipotle chicken. They offer margaritas, sangria, and draft Dos Equis! I really enjoy the sangria! Yum! They have a wall of craft hot sauces for every type of taste bud. They have delicious queso and guac! However, the best thing about this place... the dessert. For 2.99 you can get empanadas stuffed with gooey cookie dough complete with chocolate dipping sauce and dusted with powdered sugar. I literally can't stop thing about them! Please try them because you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The first time I ever had this place was in Ft. Lauderdale, the next time was to Orlando and the last time my husband and I were on our way to Myrtle Beach (from our home in Virginia) and we made a detour on the way down to go to the location on Duke's campus. All of them are excellent. So, when I was coming to Concord for the weekend, I'm immediately said I was going to stop here for lunch and take it back to my hotel. I was so disappointed! The lady got my order wrong for starters, but that's ok, we are all human. I got to my hotel, got settled, started eating my food and it was gross!! I get the same thing every time - the noritto bowl with blackened chicken + a side of chips and queso. The chicken was tasted like rubber. It was tough and way too chewy. I thought it was just a few pieces, but nope, it was all of it. I was so disappointed, especially because I don't have one local and typically will go out my way for it. My queso was soooooo cold. I don't know how they served me cold queso. I understand I had to get to my hotel, so it wasn't going to be steaming hot, but this was cold. Almost like it had been just sitting on the counter.  Once again, I was disappointed. I threw everything away and took a nap. A waste of money for sure. However, I recommend you try it because all my other experiences at other locations were great."}
{"text":"This was my first time in this restaurant. The decor is a bit odd inside and has some sort of neon glow. We stood in line and waited our turn to order. It's very similar to moes/chipotle. My fianc√©e and I both got the Tijuana burrito mine with steak and his with chicken. There is a decent little sauce bar with all sorts of hot sauces ranging from mild to insanely hot. I enjoyed that part! I didn't see any salsa and am not sure if that is included but we ordered a little side of queso. Halfway through the meal fianc√©e realized he was missing chicken in his burrito. When we alerted the manager she quickly corrected it and mad a new burrito. Overall this is decent but not really comparable to chipotle in my opinion. The food is pretty good though if your on this side of town."}
{"text":"Greeted by the manager who asked if this was my first time here, which it was. She explained the menu and how the dining experience works. It is casual dining and you order at the counter but food is delivered to your table. But don't worry, you still get 5 start service. Servers and mangers will still check on you to make sure you are doing well and if you need anything else. 

They have the largest hot sauce bar I have ever seen. Anything you like from sweet to HOT, all with very clever names. 

I ordered the bean and cheese burrito served wet. Couldn't decide between red or green sauce so I got both. All orders come with chips as well. And as a vegetarian it's nice to find a place that had lard free beans and everything is made fresh to order. 

Friendly accommodating staff, great service, food!!! 

They also have daily specials. Monday $2 beers, Tuesday $5.49 two tacos, chips and a drink, and Thursdays $5.99 burrito, chips and a drink."}
{"text":"Food here is pretty good. The main issue is the long, long, LONG!!! Wait times. I shouldn't have to wait close to an hour. That's ridiculous to me. Everytime I come its like I have to wait. Hopefully in the future this place gets better as I only have one more visit in me left."}
{"text":"They have a open feeling dining room with mainly 90's music playing. The volume is loud enough to listen to but not too loud to have a conversation. The staff were friendly and there is nice atmosphere to make you feel at home."}
{"text":"First and last time going to this place.  I have the steak burrito a steak taco in a chicken taco I asked if they had fillers in them. they said it was about 50-50. I had all tomatoes and 3-4 pices of meat. The meats didnt have any flavor at all. They say everything's made fresh to order if that's the case why was my food cold. Save your money and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"I found this place last year and have enjoyed a few different meals here. Great burritos! You can get them wet (with cheese) if you're not watching your calories. I also like the house margarita. Always seems to be very busy in here.  Ohhh also, the guacamole is Awesome! Get the large and take the extra home! The house margarita is a great thirst quencher.

Only COE I have.. parking is sometimes tight at lunch time."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. However i ordered a beef burrito with no sour cream and it came with sour cream. Also the burrito was not as good as Mo's. Its also annoying when you are trying to eat and employees are screaming peoples names out. I will stick to Mo's."}
{"text":"First time going to the restaurant was pleasant with excellent deals. Second time at the restaurant, we realized the catch. The food was awful and the service began to just be \"tijuana\" flat out annoying. Place was too rushed, salsa containers were WAY too tiny to dip the chips in, 90% of the salsas were WAY too runny and just gross. I could've made a better quesadilla blindfolded, tortilla shells weren't cooked well at all and instead tasted like cardboard. \"Blackened\" meat is just spices cooked on to add to the even more salty meal that you already have. Not to mention, the chips were terrible as well, salty AF. Don't waste your time or money. And P.S. their deals aren't really deals.. they are just overpriced to begin with."}
{"text":"New restaurant on East Boulevard. So far, so good! The mahi mahi salad is really fresh and tasty and loooooove the avocado ranch dressing. I've been here a couple of times now and the staff are always amazing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I basically live at this Tijuana Flats, and it has never not been good. They did change the menu recently, and the black bean and chicken flautas are no longer there, which sucks but I just get a combo with black beans and the problem is slightly solved. Customer service is always great, and I am always asked if I need refills or if there is anything else I need. They have discounts for college students and faculty, I'm not sure if that would ever include regular K-12 teachers like me, but the prices are low anyway so it's not a big deal. 

The only thing I don't really understand is the tipping protocol, I usually tip a couple of dollars but I don't know if they are being paid based on tips or if they are paid hourly. Also if it is your first time there, yes, they clear the tables for you, you can just leave your plates on the table."}
{"text":"Love Tijuana...I always enjoy eating here they have great tex-mex. I love the flautas...chips...guacamole...toastadoes...black beans...nachos...the food is great and always satisfies. The staff are always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend LOVE this place. So far we have had the banging chicken burritos and tostados (which have a bit of a kick to it), chicken taco salad, black bean and veggie quesadilla, guacamole and nachos (I love their nachos they also topped them off when we were leaving), side of black beans and rice (best I have ever had even attempted to go home and make it myself).

The staff here are always welcoming and curteous I love the new location  closer to our home. I will of course be back!"}
{"text":"We went here last night. I thought it was pretty good. I would compare it to Qdoba or Chipotle but if you're comparing it to a local Mexican restaurant it's going to be different. I got the Norrita readable and I was very satisfied. I thought it was an extremely reasonable price. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  Stopped in for the first time and they treated us like VIP's!  Amazing customer service.  The food was delicious. It's fresh and made to order.  They have a salsa/hot sauce bar - something for everyone. Will definitely return when in the area."}
{"text":"A very modernized take on Tex-Mex food, and not what you would expect in terms of authenticity (Which is not a bad thing by any means!). Love the localized theme for the UNC Charlotte crowd. They even offer a 20 percent discount for students. The food is great, and the prices are fairly reasonable. One element of this place I really like is their hot sauce bar. There's a hot sauce for everyone's palate, and they pair great with the tacos and burritos. I recommend their burritos! Get them wet if you order them, you'll thank me later...."}
{"text":"I ordered some food to-go here the other week and was really disappointed. I don't know if they axed enchiladas from the menu, but they weren't available to order online (and that is what I was craving). Instead, I ordered a beef and bean chimichanga. When I got home and started eating, it contained only beef, but I didn't want to have to go back and have them fix it because I was starving. The chimichanga itself was just ok. The size I got was the larger of the two portions sizes and it was basically just a huge flour tortilla filled with a lot of under-seasoned ground beef. There was also a random piece of chicken in there, which ruined the meal for me because I'm a really picky eater and hate the texture of chicken."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Tijuana Flats since they opened their first locations in the Charlotte area years ago. We currently go to this location in Gastonia since it is the closest to where we live in Lake Wylie. I usually get their Dos Tacos which has been my favorite for a long time but since I've been trying to eat healthier (the Dos Tacos aren't too bad), I tried their Lime Steak Street Tacos today. I asked for the avocado crema on the side which was when my food arrived. I loved how they only used one corn tortilla with each taco (most places do 2 because the corn tortillas tend to be pretty flimsy. These were a little thicker but not overly thick (just right). Each taco was stuffed with lime steak, cabbage, cotija cheese and pico de gallo. This portion was just right and much lighter than the Dos Tacos. The avocado crema was yummy and I confessed I ate it all! The lime steak was a little tough and did not have as much lime taste as I would have liked. It would have been nice if the entree came with lime wedges. But I ate both tacos and enjoyed it! Overall, this is my new favorite entree! The employees here are always very friendly. I especially enjoy the fact that kids can eat for free on Sundays! Definitely will be here again soon!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong when craving some Mexican food at this joint. We love Tijuana Flatts and I always try something different each time I visit. This time I tried their Kickin' Chicken Burrito. with their addictive queso cheese and tortilla chips. You have to try each of these items. Just be sure to ask for sour cream.

The Kickin' Chicken is covered in the Kick Ass sauce and topped with onions and green peppers. It was very tasty and will order this again. I'm definitely a fan of this place. The customer service here is excellent and everyone stops by to ask if you need a refill and if everything is good. 

5 stars all the way for this Tijuana Flatts location. Awesome place and never have a somplaint."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed this location.  The store is clean and the staff is friendly.  

They have two taco Tuesday with a drink for $5.49 and burrito Thursday with a drink for $5.99.  They both include chips and the sauce bar.  There are several flavors of sauces from mild to hot."}
{"text":"Great food and always a quick lunch or dinner. Everyone is friendly and helpful. Like that they bring the food to the table and check on drinks.
The hot sauce bar is great. Love the curry sauce."}
{"text":"This was my first time going there for Taco Tuesday! I love the chicken tacos and steak tacos! Mike and his crew were excellent servers!!! The drinks were on point as well!! I have found me a new taco spot!!! cheers to TIJUANA FLATS!"}
{"text":"This was myfirst time ever in Tijuana Flats. I was greeted with a hello and smiles. I was a little worried since ive never tasted anything from here. I was blown away! Ordered the Chipotle chicken chimcungha with verde sauce. They have a great selection of hot sauces. I recommend the BRUTAL BAJAN! Def will be back!"}
{"text":"Took friends that were passing through town and wanted something quick and fresh for dinner and we all loved it! The service was outstanding and the food was great! Prices are affordable and the concept of the place is well executed. It relates to other places like Chipotle and Qdoba but has a way larger menu and takes longer to get your food. It's more of a On the Border menu. We were really impressed and will be back again! Thanks for a quick, healthy, cheap and fresh dinner!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at TiJuana Flats and the customer service was excellent! I work in the customer service industry as well so I greatly appreciate good service. Rosie and her team we're lovely!!!"}
{"text":"Normally when I come to Tijuana Flats I have had good experiences but this time not so much. We ordered nachos (minus the toppings) and 1) there barely wasn't any Queso and 2) there weren't a lot of chips. We have ordered this meal plenty of times and hadn't had this issue before so unsure if it was just a bad day.

The service was amazing and people are constantly checking on you to make sure you are enjoying your meal. We could have said something but we didn't want to complain about the portion of our food since it tasted fine but I was a little upset at how much we paid versus what we got. I'll go again to give it another try."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Tijuana Flats and I think I'm just not impressed with the concept as a whole. The staff were friendly and the place was clean - but those are the only redeeming qualities. 

Things I didn't love...

1. The queso was yellow and bland - kinda tasted like Velvetta. 
2. The mix of counter service and table service was strange. I don't understand why a counter service place puts the soda fountain behind the counter. 
3. I'm confused about why meals come with chips but nothing to dip them in. No salsa or anything. And the hot sauce bar wasn't cutting it. 
4. The food was just bland and boring - the chicken was chewy and the carnitas were dry."}
{"text":"I've taken two groups of people here and it wasn't that great.... Cool vibe but not really a fan of any of the food I've (or others) have gotten."}
{"text":"After posting my first review the manager reached out to me and offered me a gift card for the service! Food is always good!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for cheap regional chain tex-mex.  They have a very extensive menu (chimichangas, quesadillas, tacos, burritos, etc).  They also serve margaritas and beer.  The bar of assorted hot sauces is a nice touch. 
If you are looking for Chipotle or Qdoba, this ain't it.  It's more along the lines of a Moe's, but with more choices.  
The queso is delicious, and they give you a generous portion, and a ton of chips.  I've tried both the tacos and burritos, and they are really yummy, and huge portions. 
My only disappointment was the refried beans.  They taste amazing, but the portion is maybe a couple spoonfuls....about the size of what you would get in a side of sour cream.  I really expected more. 
Prices are great.  It's really affordable, and service is quick."}
{"text":"Nothing very special and way too expensive for what it is.  The food wasn't bad, just nothing impressive and very fast food-like for the price.  They had many different salsas to try which is kinda neat. The service was good. Just would like to spend money like that elsewhere."}
{"text":"After reading previous reviews, and being a lover of all Mexican food, I figured I needed to check this place out. I was prepared to be confused walking in, as some other yelpers mentioned, but there was a woman who greeted me at the door and told me exactly how it worked. 

I ordered the \"pick dos\" and it was a great way to go! Had a taco and enchilada. The chicken and beef were equally seasoned and fresh, as well as the toppings (you get your pick of tomatos, onions, lettuce, olives, sour cream and jalepenos). You also get your choice of side. I went with the chips - again fresh and had a nice seasoning blend on them. 

They have a hot sauce bar that you can experiment with also, which is cool. I kind of wished that you got salsa with your chips or that there was a salsa on the hot sauce bar to go with the chips. I feel like it just goes hand in hand. 

All in all, great meal, friendly staff, and they offer a 10% discount for all public servants (police, fire, emt, and teachers)!"}
{"text":"My street taco was good but the Nachos were stuck to the paper. Very little chicken on nachos.  I think their blackened seasoning is just salt. Not good. People who work there are friendly."}
{"text":"If you love spicy food and some Mexican food then check this place out. I just went here and I was very impressed. I plan to return soon."}
{"text":"I have been twice since they've opened and I'm going for lunch today.  Very excited to have this place right beside my office.  Food was delicious and service was good.  Very cool and trendy atmosphere! HUGE selection of sauces...seriously try them all!!  When we were seated, we had at least four people greet our table before we even received our food.  That was a bit much and slightly annoying since I was trying to catch up with the work gals.  I'm sure they'll improve!"}
{"text":"Take my review with a grain of salt as my wife loved it. I think the place is just a bit lost. Service while polite, but never received the chips & queso we ordered and it seemed like there was drama going on (there's always some drama in restaurants, but better for it to take place where the guest can't see)."}
{"text":"When I get outside of my remote work mode, and decide to go into the office, I typically end up going out to eat for lunch.  One of our routine places is Tijuana Flats.  The staff is always friendly, and the food never disappoints.  I always go for the Beef Flautas (I can never finish this meal due to how much food they give you).  A flauta is a tortilla wrapped around a meat and cheese and then deep fried.  They give you a choice of flour or wheat tortilla - you get 6 pieces of the flautas that fill up the rim/edge of your plate (3 full flautas cut in half).  It doesn't end there - You get many fixings that you can pick/choose from (onions, tomatoes, lettuce, jalapenos, sour cream, queso, guacamole, etc.) All of these fixings are located in the center of you plate.  If that isn't enough, you can make a meal of it and get a drink with sides of beans and rice.  This is definitely a wonderful lunch with plenty of tasty food at a great price.

Tip:  Tijuana Flats has an amazing hot sauce bar.  You can be as daring as you wish to be!"}
{"text":"The Steak Flautas were delicious and I loved all the selections of hot sauce. I think it was the Jason's Mom or something that I had which was especially good. Props to the queso dip as well, this place deserves its high rating. It lived up to the expectations. Also appreciated the love for the troops, Murcia."}
{"text":"If some divine power came down from the heavens and said \"Lo, ye may not eat of the burrito of Tijuana or else ye shall perish forever\", I'd be all \"Guess. I'm. Gonna. Perish.\"

Srsly, this place is great. Get a carnitas chimichanga or just a blackened chicken burrito (both are yuge!). And if you've gotta sensitive little baby tongue like me, try the mae ploy sauce from their huge sauce bar. The chef is dope and always comes out to ask about your burritos. The rest of the staff are super friendly too, and I'm all about that. Also, the music is super great, from Journey to Arcade Fire"}
{"text":"My friends and I had such a wonderful experience here tonight! The workers were so friendly and helpful and the food was sooo good! We had a great conversation with the store manager who I expressed to that I wanted to try the cookie dough dessert so he personally went back and made it and brought it to us, it was so nice! I was so surprised and not to mention the fried cookie dough was AMAAZINGGG. Even though we live 30mins away we will for sure be back and I highly recommend, especially this location. Thank you again to the manager for making our experience special :)"}
{"text":"Wow! Tastes as good as I remember back in my UCF days. First off, its hard to come by establishments on East Blvd with ample parking so Im thankful they have a big lot. I love the casual atmosphere and GAWKED at the salsa bar as I walked up to the counter to place my order. I got a wet veggie burrito smothered on red chipotle sauce -- it was DELISH! Quite large, but I managed to eat most :-). The salsa bar was like a play place for me, as I love spicy food. I wasnt a fan of the vinegary sauces but I did enjoy several (cant remember the names at the moment). Service was swift and the wait staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Great menu, perfect for lunch.  Good service, friendly staff. I always enjoy coming here. Trying to work my way through the sauce selection. I don't think I'll make it to far towards the inferno selection."}
{"text":"The staff is trained well and treat customers respectfully. Also, it is kept clean and tidy. 

As far as food goes, there are some good veggie options, but I stick to the black bean tostada without cheese/cream. It's a solid dish and the chips and salsa make it great. My only complaint is that the sauces don't compliment much - a salsa bar versus a sauce bar would make a lot more sense."}
{"text":"We stop here pretty regularly and order black bean tostadas with no sour cream or cheese. It is a pretty large portion for very little money. The salsa is comes with is fresh and if you order extra chips, they are seasoned and you can make a full dinner or large lunch out of $9-10. It's vegetarian friendly and the staff at this location has been extremely nice and helpful. The one of Easy that closed was similar, but with poor management. 

It could be much better, though. The guacamole tastes like a frozen brand and the sauces do not really compliment the food at all. Some of them taste good, but a unique salsa bar would make much more sense."}
{"text":"Just barley a step above Taco Bell unfortunately. Cheap quality made food. The rice is dry, the guacamole is all lime taste and the salsa tastes like spaghetti sauce. I ordered the beef and bean chimichanga, more flour tortilla than anything else.

I wanted to like this place as Mexican is my favorite, but it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but the main issue I had is the restaurant is NOT kid-friendly as it purports to be. There is gratuitous use of curse words on the menu and displays through the restaurant."}
{"text":"We have wanted to check this place out for a weeks now. So mad we didn't come sooner. Great menu for our family of three. Awesome prices and the food was amazing. Chips weren't overly like most places. They were fresh and warm! Alexa the manager came over to our table and introduced herself to us and thanked us for coming in. That goes along way with me. The entire staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Thank you for coming to the University area. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Tijuana flat falls flat for me.  
They have some cool things/ideas going on but as a whole, they are not very good.  I hate to say that because I wanted to like them. 

I will say the service was super friendly but that is pretty much where the good things about this place stop.

The salsa is gross.  The cheese dip is melted cheddar and nothing great, the guacamole is bland.  I ordered the chicken bowl and the rice was so dry as well as the chicken.  They were both pretty flavorless.  I added black beans and there were about 3 in there.  

Overall, just a waste of calories and time.  I was 2 feet from Moe's which would have been a better option.  Seriously."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and always have a great experience. The manager is very hospitable and seems to always be working just as hard as the staff. The food is always tasty and fresh. I've introduced several people to Tijuana Flats and am happy to say that all of them preferred the food here over both Moe's and Chipotle. The sauce bar is phenomenal. I usually get the Norrito Bowl with black and refried beans. If you're vegan, you're in luck because their refried beans are vegan! There are specials on most days of the week and if you're a student you get 20% off your order.  If you're nearby, definitely give Tijuana Flats a try!!"}
{"text":"Good food but pricey! 

Upon walking in, I was immediately greeted. The staff here is exceptional! It was my first time dining here as well as my friend. Wednesday's are half price with student IDs so we jumped in the opportunity. 

I ordered a chicken quesadilla and a soda. Salsa doesn't come with the chips you get with your entree. $7. I asked if that was before or after the discount. It was after. Thank goodness we came on Wednesday because I couldn't imagine spending $14 on what I got.

The food here is pretty solid. The salsa was good. My quesadilla was warm and fresh. The chips were seasoned well. 

Overall, great service and good food. Wouldn't return though due to price. The area has so many great alternative options to choose from for a comparable price."}
{"text":"I just love Tijuana Flats!  Spent the weekend in the Charlotte area and while shopping and having general fun, I found this Tijuana Flats location.  I was pleasantly surprised this location was of the same quality as my favorite location in Greenville, SC.  Staff was friendly as expected.  The physical space for the location was much bigger than I'm used to which makes moving around much easier.  If I ever find myself hungry in Concord, NC again, Tijuana Flats will be my destination for sure."}
{"text":"Always good and fast.  A little pricey for what you get.  A great alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"All I will say is the I liked the refried beans.  Really, you ask? Yes.  After two visits and trying a few different things Tijuana Flats is not worth the money and time.  My first visit I ordered a Taco Salad, which was decent.  The bottom of the taco shell was filled with stale rice and and topped with a pile of lettuce and tomatoes and maybe 10 pieces of chicken. The chicken was cooked well, but nothing great. As for the salsa bar, or hot sauce bar, UGH! All disgusting in my mind.  Tonight, craving Mexican after a long day at work I thought I would give them another try. I ordered the duo, a chicken burrito and a beef taco. A burrito is warm with sauce and cheese on top, right? No, this was a cold flour tortilla rolled up, basically a rolled taco. The beef taco was decent, but had so much lettuce and tomato it was hard to enjoy anything else.  And, the most disappointing point of both the burrito and the taco was that both had no meat filling.  I had a spoonful of beef and maybe less than 10 pieces of chicken.  With Bakersfield so close and Moe's down the street TF will not be my go to Mexican in the area. Sorry, I so wished more for them."}
{"text":"Tijuana Flats is one of our favorite chain restaurants, and this location is always clean, the staff is very friendly and helpful, and we have never had to wait too long for our food. It's also very affordable--two adults can eat a good sized meal for about $15 total. We usually order the black bean nachos and they are always delicious."}
{"text":"A healthy option for Mexican food. I appreciate the fact that the menu lists the calories of each dish. We need more places like this. I just wish that I had enjoyed the food more!!!

It seemed to me to be very lacking in flavor. It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't yummy. Come on people, healthy food doesn't have to be boring!!

I was also disappointed in the sauces, yes sauces, not salsa. I'm a huge fan of freshly made salsas and they only offer a huge selection of hot sauce. :(

The restaurant gets 3 stars even though I didn't really enjoy it and I probably won't go back, I still feel like it deserves credit for providing a healthy option!"}
{"text":"A good quality burrito joint.  

The ordering process is a little confusing to the uninitiated.  Pick up a menu, and walk along the right wall to place a order at the counter.  You then sit down and they bring your order out to you by calling your name. 

They have a tons of different options for your burrito, so take your time and you can finding something you like on the menu

1 THING that you have to experience is : CHURROS.  They have amazing churros. OMG so good. I probably could eat 3 orders every time I go there."}
{"text":"Good cheap tacos with so many different sauces flavors, which makes this place stand out from all the other quick Mexican places!"}
{"text":"Not sure the hype of this place is valid. I just ate here at the recommendation of my sister, who praised this place. It was sub par and that's reaching. The queso was so thick and reminded me of velveeta with rotel mixed in. The quesadilla was small and cooked with sour cream inside which made it a warm nasty cream. The rice and beans side was actually really good but the 3 bite portion was a HUGE disappointment. This will definitely not be a place I visit again, ever."}
{"text":"2 tacos, chips and a drink for $5.49! #enoughsaid I ordered one crunchy and one wheat soft shelled taco. The soft shelled was chicken and the crunchy was beef. Chips were salted well and the salsa was great! J took my order and was awesome and the food came out quick! But the game changed once I hit the Hot sauce bar. 12 hot sauces to choose from makes Ryan a happy boy. Loved this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time at this location & the service was great! Someone is at the door greeting you when you walk in asking if it's your first time there & directing you where to go. The food came out fast & when you eat in they bring it to you. The staff is constantly checking to make sure your okay & if you need drink refills. Nice place for lunch or dinner and prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Went to this establishment for the first time and I have to say it was a let down. I ordered a salad with a side of rice with 3 corn tortillas(1.17 for 3) and I received 2 corn tortillas and a salad with the end of a bag of tortilla chips. Also when they bring you your food they scream your name and look for you. Then you raise your hand and if they don't see you you have to chase after them before they give your food to the wrong person. My boyfriend ordered a burrito and a taco for $12 it was a rip off. The only cool thing about this place is the hot sauce bat but that's all this place has going for it. Woman who took my order was flustered and rushed through my ordering process as though there was a line(there was no one behind us) .Will not be returning & will not recommend this."}
{"text":"Loved this place, tacos and nachos are incredible, interior was unique. Staff was very friendly"}

At this TJ Flats, you order your food at the counter and then from there it is full waiter service at your table. After placing your order at the counter, the fun begins....
This place has a hot sauce bar with all different types of sauces, varying in spiciness, and little plastic cups/shot glasses. Naturally, the goal is to take a shot of each sauce prior to your food coming out.  This isn't really pleasant., as you may have guessed...but it is fun and satisfying.

Now that my face and head were sweating, it was time to eat the burritos.  Nothing remarkable here.  Probably my biggest gripe is that the burrito wrap to filling ratio was way off.  The burrito looks massive, but it's primarily for show.  I ended up with a few sq. ft. of wrap left over.

Everyone was really nice and the hot sauce bar was awesome, but the food did not really pan out.  It's worth going if you want to play the hot sauce game, but aside from that, you would most likely leave Chipotle more satisfied."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! had a bunch of people and everyone was tended too! super nice and friendly environment!"}
{"text":"I lived in Orlando for about 5 years and frequented the flagship store quite often. 

Imagine my shock and surprise as I'm driving down East Blvd one day and see the \"Coming Soon!\" sign with the Tijuana logo on it. 

It kind of went beyond shock and surprise. It turned into excitement. Then there was giddiness. Then there was euphoria. And then I had to wait a couple of months for it to actually open....

BUT, YOU GUYS. SO GOOD.

Tijuana is one of those places you have to experience in order to \"get it\". Everything runs smoothly despite the appearance of chaos. The food is wonderful. I always end up getting a chimichanga. And churros. Fresh, hot churros. 

I want to wrap up my review with three little words:

HOT SAUCE BAR."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, my first experience was not good but I am so glad I gave them a second shot. I didn't like their nachos(I'm from Texas so I put queso on my nachos, not shredded cheese). I came in again for taco Tuesday and I must say, these are some of the best tacos I've had in Charlotte. The portions are really good for the price. I come here anywhere from 2-3 a month."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I haven't reviewed this place sooner! I've been here a few times to order to-go orders but had not taken the time to sit in until today... and I'm glad I did! The service spectacular! I'm not even exaggerating! Whoever does recruiting for this place got it right! 

Not to mention... the food is ALWAYS fresh and fulfilling! We came in on a Saturday for lunch and the guy behind the counter was VERY informative about all the toppings that came on the $2 tacos! AND THEY HAVE WHEAT TACOS! For two people, plus one drink and a Corona Extra and an a side of QUESO.... $15.50! SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!! 

I was already coming here but know that I'M COMING BACK!"}
