{"text":"Got food poisoning on my very first time here.  I realize there's a risk with raw fish and I know it can happen anywhere, but I don't think I can go back.  It was pretty bad."}
{"text":"You need to know what you like. I think the House Sauce had way too much seasame oil and makes the food unedible, but the House Spicy was perfect and mixes well with the ocotopus.

At ~$10 per bowl it's certainly worth a try and if you mess up your bowl it's not too bad. The customer service is fine and the enviornment is very clean and upbeat."}
{"text":"Great food! The only downfall is that parking is a nightmare and the lady behind the counter was less than friendly. The food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"Went for the first time and I really liked it! The bowl was really good. I liked the variety of toppings and the house sauce was delicious! There was no line or anything so I didn't have to wait and the girl that helped me was very nice and friendly. The reason I'm giving four stars is because I also got a Thai iced tea for a drink and I didn't like it that much. I tasted a bit watered down. I love Thai iced tea and always order it wherever they have it but didn't love it here. Other than that everything was good. I recommend and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is a great new location. The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the products. It was busy but the line went fast and smooth. And best of all it tasted amazing."}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday. Their food is super fresh and AHmazing."}
{"text":"Omg this is brilliant idea I wish they would do this with sushi just pick your ingredients and throw it in a roll. Fresh yummy and just enough to get you full"}
{"text":"Ok... the food is amazing!  Sincerely it is. However, my only gripe about this place is that they are skimpy with their servings.  I've been there three times and each time I order the same thing and each time I get less.  Example, today I got my usual large and they skimped on the edamame (one scoop not three), no wasabi (even though I asked for it).  It's just super light compared to the Chandler location. I don't want to say they were generous with their servings but they did not skimp.  Just a heads up... great food but you might not get as much as other locations."}
{"text":"Decided to finally give this place a try and I am so glad I did!! I got the regular size which was very filling. I chose the white rice with salmon and scallops, house sauce and all the toppings. It was incredibly tasty. I will definitely be back! They do not offer any non-fish options, which bummed my bf , but they are surrounded by other restaurants that he could grab something from so we were both happy."}
{"text":"Fresh, fast, cheap,  and very very ONO... I used to drive to the Scottsdale location  and was so happy I when they put one over here."}
{"text":"I love me a good poke bowl their food is amazing. I love the toppings and the variety. What i did Not like was the customer service. Not everyone but one girl was not friendly, she was rude while taking our order, did not smile and did not seem like she wanted to be there. Funny how the customer service really affects how you feel about the place. Don't get my wrong I love their food but they could really work on the customer service."}
{"text":"Today was the first time ever trying ahipoki bowl and this definitely isn't the last time. It's off of 7th Ave and McDowell, just a warning parking is a lil tight so be careful. The staff was very courteous and explained my options given that it was my first time. This location was very clean as well which is a plus. I got a regular size bowl with white rice, spicy tuna side of
Crab, edemame, greens and the spicy creamy sauce. Not to mentionThe portion size was perfect. A bit pricey but on all honesty is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Always fresh tasty food.  Love this place.  Plenty of variety to choose from at a very fare price for fresh fish and fixings."}
{"text":"Ahipoki Bowl is apparently taking over the valley. This is the third location of theirs that I've visited and now they're putting one in a half a mile from my house. Looking on their website they seem to have 4-5 locations \"coming soon\" in the valley.

I'm not a sushi person really but I've gotten into poke since trying Ahipoki and other poke places in Phoenix. Ahipoki is my favorite so far. I like their house sauce and furikake. 

This location can be tight on parking during peak hours but otherwise this is a nice spot. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and the food/menu is identical to their other locations. I've always found the food to be good quality and tasty. I'm sure I'll be frequenting this location in the future!"}
{"text":"As an out-of-towner, I ordered a poke bowl using DoorDash tonight looking forward to seeing what the poke quality in Phoenix was like.  While my DoorDash delivery guy was great, the food and restaurant experience was a nightmare.  They forgot to put the fish on, which isn't terrible but I kept trying to call their phone number but no one would pick up.  I sent feedback thru DoorDash and the restaurant called me back right away acknowledging their mistake and asked me to contact the DoorDash guy to pick up the fish.  I was confused why I would need to contact him, and they said it was because they couldn't reach him.. As we waited on the phone for the delivery guy to possibly contact me, the lady said she didn't want to get in trouble as they also had this mistake the other night and that her manager said she needed to hang up the phone call soon.  I was super confused and asked what they expected to do and she said she didn't know.

Thankfully the DoorDash guy went out of his way to pick up the missing poke and redeliver the order to me.  I also asked the restaurant if they would cover his tip for going out of his way and they reassured me they would.  Of course the DoorDash guy said they didn't give him anything, so I ended up tipping him again as he deserved it.  

It's such a shame as poke restaurants are growing in popularity and they really dropped the ball on customer service and quality. I really just got sashimi in soy sauce and an undressed salad.  Save yourself the trouble and avoid this place."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying out one of the recently popular fast casual poke restaurants and I was pleasantly surprised! 

The tuna tasted fresh and had none of that awful fishy aftertaste. I love that you can choose half rice/half salad as your base. The line moves quickly and the employees were happy to help as I went down the line and asked what certain items were (it being my first time and all!). 

The prices are a bit steeper than other fast casual restaurants, but that is expected due to high quality fish. My one complaint is that the portions of the veggies and toppings were very skimpy! I asked for edamame on mine and received maybe 8-10 beans. I understand having tinier scoops for proteins but for $9-12 a bowl load me up on all the cheaper cucumbers, greens, and onions!"}
{"text":"Finally a Poke place closer to home! 

Must say I'm impressed with the quality, cleanliness and staff here at Ahipoke. 

We started with a half/half bowl with 3 protein selections. 

You have the option of white rice, brown rice, organic salad or half/half. Proteins include tuna, spicy tuna, tuna luau ( my Fave) salmon, albacore, yellowtail, shrimp, octopus and scallops. Yes.... Avocados are extra but a must for me. 

Most menu options have the choice of 2-3 proteins but you can always add more! So we opted for 4 ( spicy tuna, tuna luau and a double portion of Salmon. 

Omg... Tuna Luau reminds me so much of the poke back in Oahu (citrus, garlic, sesame oil with sliced onions... yummmm) 

A choice of sauce or no sauce including house sauce, creamy spicy sauce, sweet citrus, garlic soy, wasabi and a couple others I may have missed. 

Many options for toppings to add ( with no extra charge) like ginger, masago, onions, scallions, edamame, seaweed salad, crab salad and some other items so you can make it as simple or as jam packed elaborate as possible. I went for the works and added it all and it was Amazing. 

It's not exactly like what I would get in Hawaii but the concept is great and the portions are huge-I actually shared my bowl. They have Thai tea on tap and it was pretty good! The staff are very nice and CLEAN. Unlike some other poke places I have visited lately..... 

Don't forget the Ice cream Macarons! 

This place is a must! Dinner and drinks for 2 with dessert for $20! Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy, can't wait to come back. Healthy food, great for lunch or dinner. Fish is all raw for max nutritional value. So happy it is here."}
{"text":"I love AhiPoki so I don't really have any thing negative to say. Staff at this location were friendly, the place is super clean."}
{"text":"I tried the ahi tuna and the octopus on top of brown rice. I thought the quality was decent, although definitely not the best.  Great place to stop for a quick lunch if you are in the area.  Also, there is a nice little area to sit outside to enjoy your bowl."}
{"text":"Love at first bite! I hadn't tried the ahipoki trend yet but figured it'd be up my alley since most of the ingredients are things I like anyways. I'm also a fan of the Build-Your-Own concept. So, no surprise, this place was awesome! Fresh, tasty, light but filling! I let the staff guide me with their recommendations & preferences which made the experience a bit more adventurous. The bowl was delicious & I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great quick, fresh and varied options! Super impressive for healthy and hearty at the same time!"}
{"text":"Ordered food from here on doordash and received half my order. Called several times after and nobody cared to answer the phone. MVP award."}
{"text":"So this place just opened and we decided to give it a try out. Very glad we did! I am not new to Poke and have eaten it at various other places. This little place is Fantastic! The best I've had in Phoenix. The ingredients are very fresh and tasty, a lot better than some other places in town. My only suggestion is maybe to increase some of the portion sizes just a tad and let people add as much masago and seaweed as they want? I know some things they do have to charge extra for.

All in all, great taste, great ingredients, great service, great location. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This is the latest place taking advantage of the customization craze that chipotle has popularized and that people seem to have forgotten subway has had for years. 

The restaurant's atmosphere is fast casual, similar to chipotle, and there is plenty of seating in the restaurant and in outdoor area in the back that is shared space. 

I was a little apprehensive about trying raw fish from a fast casual place, but it was actually really good. In the \"regular\" sized portion you get white rice, brown rice, salad, or half-and-half as your base, 2 meat selections, and a variety of options as toppings or sauces. I had the spicy tuna and salmon with edamame, pickled radish (which was amazing), cucumber, creamy spicy sauce, sesame seeds, and red pepper flakes. There is a larger option where you can choose 3 meats, but the portion size for \"regular\" was alright for me. 

They also have macaroon ice cream sandwiches which I will probably try next time I go. 

Overall, the food was good and the portion size was normal. At about $10, it's not an everyday lunch thing, but I definitely see myself returning."}
{"text":"Recently went here. The service was great and the employee made it exciting when I told him it's my first time having deconstructed sushi in a bowl. Rice could have been cooked a little longer, yet was perfectly cold. I went when it wasn't busy. And the salmon was very refreshing. My bowl consisted; white rice, cucumber, salmon, seaweed salad, edemame, ginger and masago (fish eggs/caviar)"}
{"text":"The worst thing I've put in my mouth in a very long time.
There was WAY toooooo much oil, no flavor and they dont know how to properly cut fish."}
{"text":"First time trying ahipoke bowl and it was delicious! My boyfriend and I split a large bowl with half salad half brown rice and it was plenty of food! Staff was super friendly as well and let us sample whatever we wanted. Also had great suggestions! 100% recommended for fresh, healthy, and quick food!"}
{"text":"This is a place that I would go to every day before or after dance class so I'm very well acquainted with how they used to be versus now. 

Nearly a year later and the girl who waited on me had such a poor attitude. She threw things into the bowl, gave me half scoops of fish (the scoops aren't that big to begin with), and over-drenched the salad with a ton of sauce (it's literally all I can taste right now). Normally a healthy salad, what I got today was a sad, anemic offering. 

As I'm sitting, writing this, men and boys are getting a warmer reception and smiles. That makes me sad because I'm über friendly and go out of my way to let people know I appreciate them. 

Anyways, for 10$, I think your money would be better spent elsewhere if you are looking for something healthy, satisfying, not drowning in sauce, and a friendly atmosphere (although, apparently if you're of the male persuasion, that won't be a problem for you)."}
{"text":"What a GREAT idea!!!

All the fresh ingredients put in your bowl, just like you'd make at home if you had all those amazing ingredients!

Restaurant is clean and staff was very friendly and helpful!

I enjoyed every bite! Yum!"}
{"text":"Whether you stopped by on opening day, lunch time, or dinner time the quality will always be the same, delicious! Thank goodness this location opened much closer to home because that means no more driving out to Scottsdale for this! Staff are always friendly, I've been here about a dozen time since they opened and there has yet been one incident that I was unhappy about. Parking lot is not as big as their other location, but that's not really a big deal for me."}
{"text":"There is no shame when I say I've gone here several times in one week. The food is fresh, and the price is awesome. Most staff is very friendly, but often times when I am ordering more than one bowl, the staff seems to rush me. I also wish they had a smaller size for kids, we usually end up just assembling a small size bowl to have to pay full price."}
{"text":"Of all the food phenomenons that have come and gone over the years, the poke craze might well be the most surprising to me.  Don't get me wrong, I love sushi and I love seafood in general.  But at the rate poke restaurant concepts are popping up, there will likely be equal parts sushi and poke stops throughout in the valley within the next few years.  Perhaps I've just underestimated the Chipotlefication of our restaurant culture or maybe people have just been clamoring for raw fish in a cheaper and more approachable way?  Whatever the reasons, the poke takeover is well underway and (for the moment) shows no signs of slowing down.  

Los Angeles based chain Ahipoki is just one of the many players in this battle for poke supremacy, with dozens of locations in CA, AZ, and WA and many more on the way.  Their newest AZ location on 7th Ave and McDowell has seemingly already caught the attention of the neighborhood.  Nestled in between Vovomeena and (ironically enough) Chipotle on the southeast corner of the street, Ahipoki is indeed Chipotle in raw fish salad form.  Choose your base, choose your raw fish, choose your sauce, and choose your toppings.  Customizable, made to order right in front of you, quick, and inexpensive.  On Saturday at Noon business was brisk, and I took the plunge.

Five steps to the process.  First, choose the size of your bowl.  Regular size (2 scoops of fish) and large (3 scoops of fish).  Large for me.  Next, choose your base.  I went with brown rice.  Next step, choose your fish.  I went with ahi tuna, shrimp, and salmon.  Next, choose your sauce.  I went with the House sauce (basically a mix of soy and a little bit of citrus).  Lastly, choose your toppings.  I went with crab meat, avocado, and furikake (dried ground up seaweed).  For my drink I went with their \"Tropical Drink\".  And lastly for dessert I went with a Mango Macaroon Ice Cream sandwich.  Total for all the food and drink came to $20.

Admittedly I probably was feeling a bit of seafood overload after awhile, but the quality of the fish was pretty decent.  The fish isn't sushi grade quality so you can certainly find better at most sushi restaurants if you're willing to pay a little more.  But not bad.  The house sauce added that little extra savory kick to the fish and of course avocado pretty much makes everything better in my humble opinion.  The Tropical Drink was much more mellow than I expected with mango being the most dominant flavor.  I also liked the mango ice cream sandwich.  Basically just a macaroon with mango ice cream in the middle.  Pretty simple concept, but it works.

Overall, Ahipoki is a worthy entry to the runaway poke train.  I wish the fish was of slightly higher quality.  But given how much that would drive up the price (not to mention stretch the thinning fish population), I can understand why they don't go that route.  If you're a sushi fan looking for a different take on raw fish or if you'd rather try raw fish in a concept more approachable and familiar than sushi, this Chipotle-style poke concept may be for you.  Someday I hope to try real deal poke in Hawaii (where poke originated).  For now, those in the valley in need of a poke fix have an ever expanding number of options, including Ahipoki."}
{"text":"The food is ok. I highly suggest tasting the tuna before you get it tho. Some taste good and one tasted like it had been sitting out forever. 
I'm from Samoa, born and raised. I know my tuna. I asked where they get their tuna from and the dude responded as if he was annoyed, \"it's tuna...\" I said, \"yea.. from where??\" He says, \"it's just tuna.\" 
Wtf kind of service is that. I felt uncomfortable and they were rushing all their customers to order. There was literally like 3 of us in line... why the rush..."}
{"text":"I love this place. Ahipoki Bowl is probably my favorite poke spot in Arizona. Their ingredients are always fresh, and their prices are reasonable. I always get white rice with salmon and tuna luau (delicious! You must have this one in your bowl). For the sauce, I always get the house spicy. I like that they are not stingy with their ingredients. The prices for extra toppings are reasonable as well. The service is good. This is definitely my go to spot after work. It's quick, healthy and affordable!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times it blew my expectations. Poke I always thought it was lazy sushi, but it turns out it was way better. You can customize it all as if you were at chipotle. The food always tasted fresh, and never had any fear of the day after raw fish."}
{"text":"I was very impressed!!! Very delicious I'm returning soon..so refreshing on a hot AZ day.. two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"So good, so fresh so delish, love this place. We make the drive over here sometime twice a week to get dinner"}
{"text":"My first time trying Poke.  I did the regular size (2 scoops) with half salad half brown rice. Got tuna and salmon, edamame, cucumber, avocado, house sauce, sesame seeds, and onion flakes.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the customer service wasn't that great. Ordering seemed...  rushed. And the guy asked if I wanted avocado so I said yes, only to find out later it was a dollar extra. Not a huge deal but they should probably warn people."}
{"text":"This  is such a great restaurant. I love the tastes of the food and the selection. Please open a branchnin arcadia. Thank you"}
{"text":"Clean and spacious location. Parking is kind of a nightmare during lunch so be prepared for that. I personally didn't like the tuna luau (tried based on Yelp recommendations) but the salmon was really tasty. I had the spicy house sauce but added some creamy spicy because I prefer the poke sauce to be a bit creamy. I like that they don't charge extra for toppings (except $1 for avo for a little scoop) and the scoops of fish were hearty. I didn't like that they use the same size bowl for large and small because my large order was completely smashed to get the lid on. Maybe a bigger bowl would be better? Overall, it's worth a visit!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my sister who invited me to lunch and picked up the bill. Glad she brought me here.
This place is a good find if you are a Poke fan. I went with the bowl and ordered the half brown rice and half white rice topped with tuna. You then pick your sauce and toppings. Sauce can be made to your spice preference. You then move on to the toppings. And then dry spices. 
I was quite impressed with the toppings and all the flavors seemed to come together and make for a great lunch.  The Poke gets a bit lost in the bowl and you get bits here and there but it is a great change to burgers, chicken and sandwiches. My overall experience was Plesant. Clean bathrooms, very modern fresh look and quick plesant service. I recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"Best bowl ever! Absolutely nothing like I've ever tasted before and I absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Ahi Poke Bowl 
I wish there was one closer to my home.
Gotta try the Tuna Luau...my fav!"}
{"text":"It's a little pricey, but I love this place!!! Their fish and side additions seemed fairly fresh and were very tasty. The restaurant is very clean and the people behind the counter were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"An \"okay\" Poke by American standard.

$10 bowel gets you two small scoops of fish/protein and free toppings, which includes flavored seaweed, edamame, scallions, etc. Guac is extra.

The fish is meh. Edible but not sushi/sashimi-grade.

Rice is the cheap kind and a bit soggy.

House sauce is overpowering and too sweet. I recommend the citrus soy sauce with garlic.

Nothing to get excited over, but it's cheap and filling; probably one of the better places in Phoenix.

If you're Hawaiian/Californian/Japanese, don't expect much."}
{"text":"I stepped in with only one ask: I am not eating any form of fish so would you be able to make a big bowl of vegetables instead of poke. And according to the menu I could chose base (rice or salad), avocado, fish and vegetables. I asked if I could have double avocado instead of one scoop of avocado and fish. The girl at the counter said \"no, we will charge you for extra avocado\" though I am not adding fish and it should be pretty simple substitute. All the time I had a feeling that the girl at the counter tuned me out. She was mixing salad with dressing when I asked if I can have at least more leaves since I am not getting fish. She didn't turn her head or stopped. Poor service. First time in Phoenix, first attempt to eat and a total failure. 

I had a pile of salad leave with dressing and a scoop of avocado. I paid $9 for this and didn't pick up.  Left hungry, upset and without money. 
9 dollars for leaves with dressing and half avocado beats even New York prices :/"}
{"text":"Went to Ahipoki Bowl for the first time today, and I loved it order 2 Ahi Tuna, Spicy Salmon and Shrimp, and Spicy Salmon over a bed of greans with house sauce and spicy sauce. It was fresh, great portion size and affordable. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had a half salad/half brown rice bowl with salmon, tuna luau, and octopus. There are a number of other toppings to choose from - pickled radish ads a nice crunch, as do fried onions. 

Places like this as starting to pop up all over and I for one welcome the trend."}
{"text":"I am so glad Ahipoki is finally in Central Phx! The location is great at 7th Ave & McDowell. Parking is a premium, snagging a spot just takes a bit of patience.

The food is so worth the tiny wait! It's fresh and they complete an order quickly. 

Josh and Monica make every diners' experience top-notch. The crew smile and are very pleasant. If you were meeting a friend or a colleague or doing a working lunch,  the place has nice energy.

Bathrooms are clean. Seating outside is available in an outdoor quad in the back or two tables are on the McDowell side. Even at 1 on a Saturday on this nice spring day, the noise is minimal.

I have been here 2X since it opened and will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Less than I got from other Ahipoki Bowl stores, and the girl who works there are rude! Definitely won't going there again!!"}
{"text":"Customer service was better they can still improve with some smiles. I went ahead and upped them to 3 stars because the first time at this location they were able to help my mom because they knew Spanish. Today they were helpful with my friend since it was her first time they were patient answering her questions and giving her suggestions. 
The food still has a great fresh taste so never disappointed there."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious ingredients make for a wonderful meal! Been here a few times and it never lets me down on flavor. They even have macaroon ice cream sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Soooo, I'm visiting from Cali, and am used to having five scoops of fish/protein on a large bowl anywhere I go. Here, the large includes only three scoops. The avocado is fresh, but each scoop is one dollar extra! Also, the sauces are limited in choices. Long story short, I ordered a \"large\" bowl, avocado (one scoop), one extra scoop of fish/protein, and a drink. The total was $17! The quality, cleanliness, and decor, is great, but the prices here are way off. Not coming back"}
{"text":"I went in today and my bowl was awesome. The house spicy sauce took it to the next level."}
{"text":"Went out to lunch with a friend of mine and we were both in the mood for poki bowls as they have become our new favorite food. I liked how this place offered you two sizes of bowls. I went ahead and opted for the large size and I got my choice of three different proteins. I opted for salmon, tuna, and yellow tail. I also liked the scoop of avocado that they offer and definitely added that to my bowl. To me avocado makes everything better! You then get to top your bowl off with an assortment of condiments and the dressing of your choice. I really enjoyed my meal and will definitely be back. The only reason I knocked off one star is because of the lack of parking. You really need to get there extremely early or extremely late in order to get a parking spot."}
{"text":"Ok, I just want to start this review saying that the food is freaking amazing!!ate at this location twice last week and both times were very good.
All the staff is amazing except for 1 guy
My 3 star review is because of one guy in particular. He is always wearing hat,long-yellow hair, dark skin. He is kinda rude and I it looks like he gets bothered if you ask questions about food and ingredients.Also, my husband and I noticed that he checks out girls in a very disturbing way..kinda creepy"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Everything is fresh and delicious, the kids who waited on me were super nice. The sauces were tasty and that pickled radish is amazing. Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Love this place the food is fresh......Certainly one of my Fav lunch spots in PHX...."}
{"text":"I haven't had the chance to have much poke because my s/o doesn't eat any seafood, but but this Ahipoki Bowl has been my go-to place for seafood cravings.

Location: The location is the best part--there are so many places at 7th and McDowell that there is something that is sure to please someone in your household/party--Chipotle, Wingstop, Five Guys, New York Pizza Department, The Habit, Pei Wei, Mad Greens... and of course, Ahipoki

Food: The house spicy is a little oily, but it is delicious! The greens are fresh, and there are lots of different toppings to add. Unfortunately, the quality of the fish isn't the best. I haven't gotten sick from it or anything, but it doesn't have quite the right bite. 

Service: The service is fast, and although the staff isn't the bubbliest I've ever seen, they are efficient, and were super helpful when I was confused about the ordering process the first time I came in."}
{"text":"This location just opened a couple of weeks ago.  But the place is nicely furnished, very basic med store front and clean.  Since this was the first time I was at this location, I took a moment to review their process, sizes and ingredients available.  The person constructing my bowl was ok, but seemed bored at what they were doing (Granted, I'm sure it's not the most exciting job); but he wasn't rude which is fine.  Decent selection available, so I opted for the small w/1/2 Rice & 1/2 Mixed greens.  For my protein, I opted for 1 scoop of Spicy Tuna and 1 of octopus.  I had mine prepared to go.  The house sauce was good, although I had asked for all three of their sauces and only got the 1.  While I was extremely excited that they had toasted seaweed & seeds, they did not have nanami togarashi (spicy chili powder), so I got their chili flakes.  The price is good for the amount of food you get.  But, I been to other places where they charge you less and only get a little more with protein.  I would eat here or one of their other locations again.  The only negative component is the parking.  That is the biggest challenge.  Since there are a few store front dining options in this building, it gets very full quickly and can stay that way for awhile.  I would have to ding them on that if I could."}
{"text":"Good variety of fish and vegetable options, but the price is steep. Too many of the ingredients have an upcharge. For $10 for a small bowl, it should include all the ingredients. The chairs at all the tables have cushions, which I appreciate. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Omg this is EXACTLY what I wanted for lunch ! ONOLICIOUS ! I had the spicy tuna, octopus with brown rice, garlic soy, masago, edamame, wasabi,daikon sprout, chili flakes, sesame seed, furikake. EVERYTHING!!! ooh weee I had the green tea macaron and mango macaron too! Yum!"}
{"text":"First time at this location but third time eating at one.   Loved it.   Restaurant was clean and spacious with large communal outdoor eating area,  plenty of shade.   Plenty of parking in the back. Service was vey prompt and polite."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in my first trip to this restaurant. I wanted cooked items so I chose the shrimp and scallops. Both of them were mostly raw and the people serving saw no problems with it. Later in the evening, I didn't feel so well. I will never be going back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying a poke bowl, let alone Ahipoki Bowl. I must say it's pretty darn good. This location is very close to my college so usually my school friends and I will come down in-between classes. It's also a very clean location. (If you've noticed from my reviews I'm HUGE on cleanliness) we are able to work on homework and hold mini study sessions, they don't mind it at all which I and my friends are VERY thankful for. The ice cream macaroons are DELICIOUS! But most importantly the food is as well! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"They charge u for everything what starts as a reasonable price ends up inflated. If u are a true poke fan I would say not . The fish seems like it is all the left overs of what u would get sashimi from. People very nice but not impressed"}
{"text":"Overpriced, mediocre topping ingredients (+insane upcharges), and fish was still frozen when served. Not a fan"}
{"text":"The build your own poki bowls were pretty good! I like the idea of being able to pick your meats and toppings! Only thing I didn't like.. is it's a little expensive for the portion size."}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean.  This was my first time there.  Not knowing what to expect, let me first say I cannot eat raw fish.  So my options were shrimp and scallops for cooked protein.  I also do not like anything spicy, so I went with soy/ginger dressing.  It was good.  But I will say, I will not be back.  It just wasn't my thing.  Was very busy and the customer service was very good."}
{"text":"There is nothing special about this place, other than it's in Phoenix where people seem so thrilled at mediocre. There is no wi-fi...the parking lot is a major nightmare. Seriously, I'd rather drive the 405 in rush hour...an they seem skimpy with their sauces. So if you really want some Hawaiian food and you're in Phoenix, this might be your only shot."}
{"text":"If there is a competition for best Poke in America, the competition can stop at Ahipoki Bowl in Phoenix. Fresh ingredients, friendly customer service, comfortable seating and hands down the best Poke I've ever had. Their Tuna Luau is freakishly good as is their house blend sauce. Honestly you cannon go wrong with anything you order here."}
{"text":"This place has nothing wrong with it. Workers were nice, food was decent. Nothing really stood out. Standard poke, however it just didn't exceed any expectations. The fish was good, but wasn't great. The ratio of fish to rice is like most poke places; rice was plenty, fish was few. I probably wouldn't go out of my way for this place/chain in particular but would eat here if other people wanted to"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that if you think that this food was soooooo delicious. We get the 3 item mix with brown rice & salad, avocado, salmon/shrimp/tuna, & ALL of the fixings! Get a vanilla macaroon ice cream sandwich too. Oh, their Thai tea is pretty good, but the tropical drink is better."}
{"text":"This spot is pretty good. Visiting from Michigan, and this was the only spot open later on  a Sunday. Glad we stopped by before we left for the airport. The large didn't look that big but it was really filling. The price for everything seemed so cheap to me, and so much seafood on it. The poke was delicious. I definitely recommend visiting this spot. They also don't over charge for extras (except for avocados) which is pretty nice. They also offer some ice cream dessert if you don't want any poke."}
{"text":"Felt like a lite healthy lunch, so, thought I to myself, I should eat a bowl of poke. Poke is lite, healthy and tasty. I know this because I went to a poke place once.

This place actually fit the bill. It was lite. It was healthy. It was delicious. I had the house sauce on some random yelpers recommendation - tasty. I added guac because yum. I added everything. I got the large. I went all out.

Here's the thing. It was tasty, but it was NOT $15 tasty.

For $15 I could sit down and have a vast array of Superior eats. I could have the cheapest dish at an expensive sit down restaurant. I could do all sorts of things.

I'm not likely to go back unless it's on someone else's dime or I discover I'm Bill Gate's illegitimate son. Just not worth it until I'm rich."}
{"text":"3 stars in general, servers are friendly, flavor is good, portions are small, the large  bowl is really a medium and considering is fish still overpriced 15.00 for a couple ounces of fish is too much, place is clean and conveniently located , will comeback but not as a regular"}
{"text":"The food here is great but the staff is less than friendly. They neglected to tell us what they were up charges on avocado and yellow tail. They spoke among themselves in Spanish the entire time. And we felt as if we were interrupting them to order our food. Would've been nice to have  friendly and courteous staff."}
{"text":"i really had a great experience here. for a quick lunch it is super delicous. it also has quick and efficient service. it is a bit pricey once you add on a few things. however for the ingredients and quality. it is a fair price. i got as much stuff as i could and all the different flavors are outstanding. i will br back again soon."}
{"text":"Best Poke place around! Highly recommend it to anyone looking for some great food!"}
{"text":"This place was great! It's so nice to be able to get healthy \"fast\" food.  I like that you have the option to get half salad and rice, but I do wish the rice could be sushi rice instead of plain white rice.

For my protein I got the salmon and tuna luau.  I thought the flavor and quality of both was great.  They have a ton of toppings and my favorites were seaweed salad, masago, and sprouts.

I ordered the iced green tea.  It was unsweetened, which I liked.  It also tasted different than other green teas I've tried - more flavorful somehow?  Anyway, I liked it.

The interior was clean and modern and quiet enough where you could comfortably talk to whoever you are eating with.  The employees were friendly and prompt at preparing our food. We had a great lunch here!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place!  The poke bowl is so good!  The ingredients are fresh and the place is always clean!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Healthy and fresh alternative. Hawaiian fare for those seeking seafood. Choose your rice (brown or white), choose your seafood protein, then garden toppings. So yum! Just look how beautiful it looks! 4 stars because they don't have a lot of drink options."}
{"text":"Quality of food wasn't very good made me a little sick. Food was overprice and the service was blow average"}
