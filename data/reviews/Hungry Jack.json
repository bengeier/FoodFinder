{"text":"Decent food for a decent price. It's a typical hole in the wall type restaurant/bar, but you get what you expect in that regard when it comes to the surroundings, furniture, and ambience. All that said, DJ Val was awesome - good mix of 90s hip hop (which in itself was a funny mix for the type of place this is, but welcomed and enjoyable nonetheless).

Addition: DJ Val ended up playing 80s punk/hip hop as the night progressed."}
{"text":"We went into this restaurant tonight at 5pm and it was like walking into a blast furnace.  We asked if their air conditioning was broken and she told us it was on.  No wonder we were the only ones there at supper time on a Friday night.  The waitress asked us if we would like drinks and we asked for a glass of water.  She replied with we don't serve tap water. After looking over the menu I asked for soup of the day in which the waitress replied,  sorry we don't have soup today.  I then asked for jalape√±o poppers and the waitress replied,  sorry we don't have poppers today. After we finally found something on the menu that they had,  my husband asked where the washrooms were.  The waitress told him that the washroom was out of service.  He said 'you're not serious' yes she was. Apparently they have been waiting on a plumber to arrive for 2 days.  She told him if he just had to pee just don't flush.  How discussing.  Needless to say I would never recommend this restaurant and it's obvious that others feel the same."}
