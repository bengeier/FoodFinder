{"text":"meh. the food was okay, just not as good as i had hoped. when i went there with my mother for dinner, there were only a few other people. the service was fantastic, but the menu lacked variety. i ordered the cream of spinach soup and vegetarian manicotti. the soup was decent, but the manicotti was really plain and boring. one of the things i did really like, though, was the free basket of bread with butter that they gave us. it's delicious!

overall, i wouldn't really want to come here again."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. Good value. The salmon with cream sauce was delightful and the chick pea salad was very tasty and interesting. The dressing on the dinner salad was delicious and the French baguette was superb. The servers were very accommodating and attentive. The ambience was just what we were looking for."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant is great, the waitresses are very kind and helpful. Best part is, they don't even know about yelp so it makes me believe their honesty in service. 
The food is well priced but nothing to rave about so I would recommend coming here at least once"}
{"text":"We were looking for some French food, and the food here was very good addition to being well priced. Very friendly staff too."}
{"text":"I searched this place out while on a business trip to Montreal. My main criteria was that it be reasonably priced and well reviewed on Yelp. 

I love this restaurant. I went twice during my three day trip: once by myself, and once with a large group of fellow conference attendees.

They have a set menu that includes soup or salad, an entree, and a dessert for around $30. The wine was also very reasonable, and good.

The food is great. The tomato bisque was lovely, and the fish with veggies was perfectly seasoned with butter and lemon. The dessert of poached pear was fine, though the pear was served cold when I expected it warm. 

The large group dinner included many people for which English was their second language, and the staff was happy to translate from French to English. The orders came out promptly, and when there was a mistake (the woman next to me mistakenly ordered the wrong dish because of language issues), they replaced it pronto.

The staff are funny, attentive, and down to earth. The prices cannot be beat. The food is simple but delicious. 

I will go to this restaurant every time I am in town."}
{"text":"Standard but special.

Enjoyed the stuffed chicken and the gazpacho. Coffee washed it all down nicely. 

It strives to be French and it certainly achieves such by the decor and view of Vieux Montréal outside the windows. Staff was accommodating and tolerant of my family's absence of français. 

To go au jour is the best bet for this joint."}
{"text":"So/So - Alsatian restaurant doesn't quite pull it off, very touristy. Satisfying portions, but average food.  Lots of other places around that are much better."}
{"text":"Dinner on a Thursday night in Montreal, here for a conference, a reunion with old and good friends.

We picked this place because it was only a short walk from the hotel and had traditional French fare.  The place is lovely on the inside, stone walls, very quaint and rustic.  I was initially turned off by the menu- I have an instinctive distrust for plastic-coated menu-books with lots of pages and pictures of the food. . .

However, the food was excellent.  I started with the escargots which were buttery, garlicky, chewy goodness.  Then onto a nice green salad with lovely fresh greens and a creamy dressing.  The duck confit was very satisfying-- a good leg/thigh with melting meat and crispy skin, served with sauerkraut and juniper berries.  Finally, a molten lava chocolate cake with a caramel center with ice cream.

The staff was so friendly and polite.  We stayed until closing, talking and drinking wine, and they didn't rush us at all.  For a place that might seem like a tourist trap (cheesy menu, rustic theme), the food and the vibe is wonderful."}
{"text":"Great French restaurant. Very quaint, love the exposed brick. Carrot soup was excellent. Entrees (poached salmon and seafood dish) were very comforting. Also, we appreciated the owners attention and understanding how to make us feel welcome with small children. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice place. Friendly staff, good food, and reasonably priced. Came in from NYC and felt welcome."}
{"text":"Decent place. Not your typical French as Alsace is on the German border .. Lots of sausage, sauerkraut and cabbage infused dishes. Reasonably priced, very quant, very helpful staff. I had the duck, average, my wife had the traditional Alsatian dish, sausages in a pot with cabbage and sauerkraut . We liked, didn't love. Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for lunch, and it meets expectations. It's a quaint French restaurant in the old port area, with a varied menu and a fair amount of kitschy decoration.  There was only one server doing all the work for the six or seven tables of diners while I was there, and he was very attentive.  
The \"table d'hôte\" for lunch is a good deal - app, main, dessert for one low price.  It also makes it easy for the restaurant to be prepared and serve quickly.  I had the salad, poached salmon with bok choy, and poached pear for dessert.  The wine was a bit pricey for the small glass he poured, and I would have preferred more choices for dessert.  Overall, a nice experience for lunch."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE!  We came on a Saturday for dinner because it's recommended in the Frommer guide; however, it was a mistake.  The food was mediocre, and the desserts were terrible.  The duck pate and escargot was good as appetizers, but everything else went down the drain.  The biggest disappointment was probably the service.  We had a waiter who spoke very well in English, but their prix fix menu was confusing, and the \"dessert of a day\" was some watermelon.  You have to pay extra for all other desserts, but we didn't find that out until later.  We ordered a salad, broccoli soup, veal pasta dish and croissant sandwich.  The salad was just a regular salad so nothing special.  I make better broccoli soup than them.  The pasta dish was dried and was in desperately need of more sauce.  Do yourself a favor and find another traditional french restaurant!"}
{"text":"nice liver dish
nice vegetarian dish
Friendly staff
Good price for a 3 course lunch."}
{"text":"No wonder Lonely Planet recommends Le Bourlingueur as the sole place to eat in Old Montreal.

Situated in a quiet corner of the old city half a block from the basilica, you could be well excused for missing it while walking by. Yet it would be a great loss for your taste buds and your wallet.

Bourlingueur's selection of table d'hote meals leaves you gobsmacked: everyone's taste is catered for. None of the stereotypical French pretentiousness and complexity either.

Even an uninitiated eater will have no trouble understanding the menu and seeing how, with main courses so well priced, he can afford a starter.

My goodness is that a good idea. Finally a portion of Escargots comme-il-faut. No cheese on top, just snail-ey goodness and garlic. Restrain yourselves or you'll eat the serving plate together with your escargots so delicious they are. 

The poached salmon is simplicity made dinner. Just a skilfully cut slab of fish, with a delicate cream sauce and a purple cabbage garnish that complements the salmon perfectly. Delicate tastes mingling together, begging to be savored at length. 

The stew was, on the other hand, a symphony of strong flavors in the sauce and the earthiness of root vegetables competing to please the lucky eater. It was absolutely delicious.

What do you mean, it comes with dessert? You must be kidding me. It's old Montreal after all, where business is business and tourists are scared. No sir, we're totally serious.  

Their dessert selection is wider than their menu suggests. For us they had a citrus cake, a cheesecake and baked apple. Everything was delicious, but the cheesecake was my favorite.

Skip the expensive wine list and go for the house wine. It's cheaper, and it's a nice Italian (white and red). $25 a litre, which is almost wine store cost.

Three people eat 2 starters, 3 table d'hote, 3 desserts and a litre of wine for $125 including taxes and an absolutely well-deserved tip. On a budget, you could eat like a king and spend like a miser at around 20-25 dollars apiece.

In Old Montreal, it's unheard of. Let's hope Bourlingueur stays as it is today."}
{"text":"Arrivé depuis Paris.  Nous avons trouvé LA table française.  Salade/soupe plat dessert café pour un prix tres raisonnable. Serveurs acceuillants, ambiance calme.
Le poulet fourré est exceptionnel!!!! A ne pas manquer"}
{"text":"Excellent. The service was wonderful. Never feel rushed. They got us in on last minute notice on a Friday night and stayed open well past closing. Would go again on next trip to Montreal   Food was yummy as well"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very quaint interior. Food was very good but was tainted by the POOR SERVICE.  In my book, the food can be outstanding but if the service is bad, the dining experience is ruined.  We would possibly give this restaurant another try if we were guaranteed a different server."}
{"text":"We ordered escargot (snails with garlic and butter), beef stew, lamp stew, duck leg and quiche of the day ,which was onion ,set dinners. Tasted very good at a reasonable price. Waitresses were very friendly. Unique desert: baked apple with cinnamon in Orange juice. The meals came with coffee or tea (a wide variety of teabags to choose from)"}
{"text":"Good food for the price and it's in a good location. They have a price fix menu which comes with delicious salad. I had the cod for my entree, escargot to start, and profiteroles for desert."}
{"text":"Wonderful salad and carafe of wine for lunch. Our waitress was so welcoming.  Great way to start our weekend in Montreal.  

The atmosphere was perfect."}
{"text":"Decor/Ambience: It's quaint and we were hoping that we'd stumbled upon a cute little gem of a restaurant on the first day of our trip. Upon entering the restaurant it was odd as it took awhile for us finally to be acknowledged by anyone and then once we were actually seated we picked up on the odd vibe. As mentioned by other reviewers, there is no music and the overall feel of the dining space is awkward as all conversations can be heard. There were numerous moments where a noticeable silence took over and I felt I could hear the people next to me chewing (or maybe I was just that hungry)!

Service: AWFUL!!! Our waitress seemed very sweet, but it was obvious her attention was elsewhere. We were seated and it took a good 15 minutes for our order to be taken. It then took another 10 minutes for us to finally see a glass of water. We found ourselves deep in conversation and then realized another 20 minutes had gone by and our waitress was MIA and no appetizers were in sight. Although another waiter passed by our table a few times and even cleaned the nearby table no one seemed to notice or care that we were left totally abandoned.  We figured we'd give it another 5-10 minutes before we gave up, but could not even spot our waitress during that time. 

Food: While I see other reviews describe the food as \"disappointing\" I cannot even comment on the bread because after waiting for nearly one hour we did not even see a simple bread basket! We finally reached the point where we just walked out and left since the waiters were all MIA and from what we could see from the one table that had food next to us, it did not look to be worth an hour wait. 

Needs overall improvement!"}
{"text":"This is a wicked place for a casual meal. Great service and the food is amazing. Most meals come with an appetizer, coffee or tea and dessert to finish off. 

I had the beef and macaroni stew, and started with a cold tomato based soup. I was a bit hesitant on the cold soup, but on a humid day, it really helps to perk up your appetite. 

The stew was good with a hearty serving size and a rich broth. However, the meat was a bit tougher than what I was expecting.  Overall, it was satisfying. 

I ended the meal with the creme custard and a nice cup of coffee. 

Highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"What a gem in old montreal neighborhood.  you'd never expect such a charming, affordable french restaurant that delivers such high quality dishes in the most touristy neighborhood.

Had the watercress soup which was probably potato-based.  My fish of the day (turbot) was cooked perfectly and topped with capers.  So tender and flavorful.  Husband had the calf liver in onion sauce and it was heavenly.  Tasted almost like beef with none of the livery taste.  Onion sauce had a very intense, beefy flavor.  We shared the orange cake and a slice of sugar pie for dessert."}
{"text":"Very nice little restaurant! We came here for lunch one day and loved it. The restaurant and decor were very charming, and the service was excellent. We both had the beef stew and it was fantastic. 

The cheesecake was ok, but not great. Still, we would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"how this restaurant received 4 stars on yelp is BEYOND me.

bread - a basket full of hard stale bread.  you can tell it has been sitting out for hours.
 
escargot - i've had better, not that flavorful

mushroom soup - where were the mushrooms? more like tastleless pea soup

fish of the day was bass - first of all the other waiter mistook it as catfish. second of all, it was VERY bland.

pork chops - dry and again, VERY bland.

their \"famous\" carrot cake - nothing special.

what the dilly yo yelpers???  

+1 star because our waiter was nice, but definitely a waste of time and money in my eyes."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, although a bit kitschy, like someone else noted here, too.  Food was good, but nothing impressive.  Very decent prices.  Decent service, didn't have anything to complain about.  If I come back to visit Montreal again,  I would try something else, rather than going back to this place.  However, if I wanted decent French at somewhat lower cost, this place would fit the bill."}
{"text":"I ended up going to the restaurant because I was looking for a nice meal that wasn't going to cost my left arm on my last night in Montreal.  This was perfect.

I called ahead and made a reservation for two but we ended up picking up a third on our way.  The restaurant was slow that night so it was a non-issue but based on how friendly the staff was I don't think it would have been on a busy night.

I ordered the salmon with cream sauce. It came with a salad and desert for an incredibly reasonable price. I had a couple glasses of wine with my sister and our new friend.  The food was perfect.  My salmon was cooked just right and was just the right amount of food.  The deserts were even lovelier.  I split my poached pear with my sister's hazelnut pound cake and it was great.  You will get a lot of delicious food for your money here. 

Our waiter was wonderful.  He was very helpful and incredibly nice.  He chatted with our table a bit and explained a few customs to me that I hadn't quite figured out yet.

I will be back.  I loved this place."}
{"text":"Great little bistro in Montreal. The deal is the inclusive meal, inexpensive by Canada standards. Quality food served calmly by an attentive staff. Pumpkin soup a bit bland, green salad was fresh and tasty. The turbot was cooked perfectly with nice rice and veggies. Escarole and Jambon (ham) gratinee was a nice blend of cheese and cream sauce. Dessert was not memorable; coconut cake and black cherry cake, ehh. Value to quality was memorable. Yelp steered us well again!"}
{"text":"We found this place by just wandering around Montreal and checking Yelp reviews and I'm so glad we picked it! This is a very intimate restaurant and the staff is very nice. Our service was a bit slow, but our waiter apologized for forgetting us by giving us extra wine, which is always a nice gesture. We both ordered beef stew and it was one of the best meals we've ever had; the flavor was perfect and the beef was incredibly tender. Our dessert of strawberries and cream was such a nice ending to our meal and it was overall a wonderful experience. I highly recommend Le Bourlingueur if you're looking for a traditional French meal or you're looking for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"OMG I LOVE IT HERE!!!!!!! I just got back from vacationing in montreal and had to yelp about all the restaurants I had to try. I LOVE IT HERE!!! the city is amazing! and the food is awesome!!!! 

If you go here to visit, you must visit this place and get their garlic butter escargot, and the canard or the beef stew!!! both dishes served with fried potatoes and its not french fries! its a whole baby potatoe fried! its good, try it!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant must have been having an off night because this was my most disappointing French dining experience ever and I don't think I am that finicky. Service was on the slow side, although we were only 1 of  3 tables seated. Meager side salad. Fish of the day: cod, although flakey, was the most unimaginative preparation of baked fish I have ever had - flavorless, with bits of carrots and broccoli on top???  Chutney or a nice salsa on top would have been nice. Bok choy: overcooked to the point of mush - prefer my veggies al dente, thank you very much.  Bf was kind enough to give me a couple bites of his palatable manicotti to erase my negative entree experience :-(.   Dessert failed to save the day, as alas, even the carrot cake was mediocre."}
{"text":"A great little restaurant, with very friendly service and an interesting menu highlighting some Alsace style food.  The German influence is apparent in the menu and definitely welcome.  The style of the food is completely unpretentious, very satisfying, and a little hint of home-cookedness.  

I went twice in four nights in Montreal.  Good value, and everything from fish to escargots to duck was cooked absolutely perfectly."}
{"text":"This was my new year's eve dinner before the wine and champagne came out. Le Bourlingueur wasn't my first choice, but I'm glad I ended up going here. I was expecting to spend about $80 a head for dinner that night, but this place was was pretty cheap. For about $40 per person everyone got an appetizer, salad/soup, entree and dessert. The menu was completely in French, but the waiter was able to translate very well what our options were. It was really tasty food, although my appetizer was pretty intense. I started with a goat cheese appetizer, a salad with a main course of scallops and dessert was an inverted apple pie with vanilla ice cream with coffee.

The appetizer was really tasty, but it was an awful lot of goat cheese for one person. I probably could have stopped eating after that, there was just too much cheese. The salad was nice, not amazing, but good after the appetizer. The scallops however, were delicious! They were piping hot and came with rice and green beans. The dessert was supper yummy and went well with the coffee they served.

I'd probably order the escargot next time I go, everyone seems to rave about it. Overall though, great price for the food, quality and service that you get."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with exposed stone wall. They serve comfort bistro French food. The mains come with soup or salad and dessert.

For dinner, we ordered the escargot, beef stew and pork with apple sauce. They were just ok. I found the stew to be salty and the pork needed more apple flavor. 3/5

For dessert, we ordered the sugar pie and profiterole. The sugar pie was not my thing. 1/5  The profiteroles was good. 3/5"}
{"text":"I chose this place for TasteMtl because of the simplicity of its menu. It was straight forward and the price was quite reasonable. 19 bucks for a French 3 course meal! Talk about a deal!  

So I went with my boyfriend and friend, we ordered 3 different main dishes. But for the appetizer it was the same : French onion soup. The soup was very delicious, I wouldn't say it's the best onion soup in Montreal like it was advertised on the website, but it was  nonetheless appetizing.  My main course was sauteed pork with mustard sauce. It had a mild sour kick and the pork was so well cooked. My friend had a vegetarian \"lasagna\", that was quite filling. It had so much cheese that I was actually glad I didn't get it. I would have been so full to the max and sleepy. My boyfriend had an amazzzzing tilapia with capers. I think his dish was the most simple and mild in terms of taste. 

For dessert I had a small slice of nutcake with pudding while my friend had some sort of pear with sauce. All in all, service was extremely attentive and friendly and the food was satisfying. Check out this restaurant if you want something low-key for atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went for dinner the evening we arrived and choose it because it looked cute and was close to the hotel. What a great find! The food was outstanding - green salad, beef stew, and catch of the day. Staff was extremely friendly. When we accidentally toppled a glass of wine, they replaced it at no charge - how nice. On top of great food and service, the pricing was reasonable. If back in Vieux-Montreal, this a a definite stop again."}
{"text":"We were so disappointed by the food because the place is quaint and cute.

Decor/Ambiance 4/5
French Bistro type look with a small assortment of tables. We sat near a large window looking out to a cold Montreal Sunday afternoon.  Our table was really unsteady, but the waiter fixed that right up.

Service- 4/5
The waiter was great and provided good recommendations. However, I couldn't help but notice that the two waiters confused the fish of the day. 

Food- 1.5/5
First, the bread was stale and hard. Second, the soup looked putrid and tasted bland. Third, the escargot was just ok. Pork medallions- dry and tasteless. Carrot cake- mediocre. 

Bottom line- What sucks is that the waiter was so nice and cheerful. What also sucks is the food."}
{"text":"I went here with my husband and friend for dinner this past weekend. I ordered the spinach soup, the stuffed chicken and cherry cake for dessert. 

The service was very slow because there was only one waiter. The food was okay at best. My soup tasted good but had a very weird chunky consistency. The chicken wasn't fully cooked at its end but was still tasty in the cooked areas... And finally the cherry cake was good but the top was burnt. 

I feel like this establishment cold be so much better if they weren't under staffed and if they played music in the background. It was SO quiet that we were afraid to speak while eating!"}
{"text":"Un restaurant français sans prétention à des prix plus que raisonnables, c'est assez rare dans le Vieux-Montréal. Le Bourlingueur en est un et il ne m'a jamais déçu. Une carte simple et diversifiée, sans esbroufe. De par les origines alsaciennes du proprio, la choucroute garnie est toujours bien servie, sans flafla. La soupe froide à la tomate est savoureuse et l'on en redemande. Le décor est chaleureux avec ses murs de pierres plus que centenaire. Bref, ce n'est pas le Toqué, mais c'est très respectable comme petit resto de quartier."}
{"text":"The fish special I ordered tonight tasted like boiled water and it had the consistency of a microwaved dinner. It was served on a uninspired bed of overcooked red cabbage and frozen cubed carrots. Just Awful, I couldn't finish it.

The waitstaff was very apologetic and offered carrot cake and chocolate cake as well but the carrot cake was mediocre at best. It was dry and the topping was salty.

Overall, very disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here is okay, not bad, but not something I would rave over. Our table ordered the duck confit, poached salmon, Alsatian sausages, and the salmon lasagna. We got our food in a  \"Table d'heur\" or set menu where the main dishes were accompanied by either soup or salad and dessert. So we pretty much tasted a good cross section of their menu.

They have very good wait staff, sadly, I think that they are understaffed. We had dinner here when there were two other large groups, and the staff were having a tough time keeping up. To the point that they forgot the coffee and tea that is supposed to go with our dessert.

This establishment can improve by renovating their bathrooms. Otherwise, the dining area has a very clean & bright atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing!  5!  Bang for your buck!

I went here during the christmas break with family.  Wandered the old city to find over-priced food.  having living in france, I could not bear to pay something more than what it would cost in euros for a relaxed, bistro/cafe style dinner, prix fixe.

So we walked into here, and lo and behold reasonable prices.

At first I didn't expect much, but with the arrival of fresh warm bread, then the salad, and finally the entrees I was surprised.  I got the confit and my parents got the liver.  Very typical french meals.  My duck as nice and tender, could've had some sauce, the liver was delicious!

This all came with a dessert, but we upgraded a la carte to the creme brulee. 

With a bottle of wine, family of 3, was only 80.

In addition, one of the servers there was extremely friendly.  I could even tell he was from Brittany from his accent.  When I asked him I was bang on.  

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great french food and resonably priced near the waterfront. Great meal which included main course, soup or salad, desert, and coffee."}
{"text":"Très mauvaise première impression pour ce restaurant....

C'est un dimanche midi que nous nous y rendons avec mon chum. Le semi-menu annoncé à l'entrée annonce des prix attractif dont 7,95$ pour un mijoté. C'est donc sur cette note positive que nous décidons d'y rentrer.
L'ambiance est à la bonne franquette  mais la salle est vide et peu chaleureuse.Je m'attendais à un genre de restaurant de routiers c'est-à-dire bonne cuisine tradi et prix raisonnables, nous sommes tombés sur tout son contraire.

La serveuse, nous amène à notre table et nous donne les menus et là tout change !!!!! Boeuf- carottes environ 19$, poulet fermier 17$, les entrées au moins une dizaine de dollars et pas de menu de brunch.

Consternée par la publicité quelque peu biaisée (pour ne pas dire mensongère) mise à l'entrée du resto et les prix assez élevés, je décide de rebrousser chemin... pour finir au McDo....

Soyez prévenus, surtout pour les Français de Montréal, si vous voulez manger ce genre de plats autant aller au marché puis vous les cuisiner vous-même ou attendre les vacances et la bonne cuisine de Mamie !"}
{"text":"Didn't think it was anything special. I actually have a headache from trying to eat 
the hard baguette the sandwich was on."}
{"text":"A great, wholesome meal.  The waiter/owner was very attentive to our celiac daughter, and I appreciated that thoroughly."}
{"text":"Quaint little spot in Old Montreal that I found myself at dining along on business a few months back.  This place had definitely more of an intimate, romantic date kind of feel, so maybe I wasn't able to appreciate the full ambiance of Le Beourlingueur, but I still had a fine dinner!  

I started with the Carrot soup, which I loved, for obvious reasons for those who know me.  I then tried their special for the night, which was a pot of Sauerkraut and different kinds of homemade sausage.  The food definitely had a much more German feel than French, but it made sense after the waiter explained the part of France that their food represented, which has a heavy German influence.  I enjoyed my meal, however I found myself wishing that I would have ordered something more classically \"French\".  

Beyond the food, the service here was fantastic, very attentive and knowledgeable!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food! A quiet little spot, we booked it here in the rain last night for a late dinner after dodging some crappy food downtown. The staff didn't seem thrilled that we walked in at 9:30 (supposedly closed at 10) but they sat us for dinner anyway. The boys were a little mortified at how quiet the restaurant was, but to me it was a nice change of pace from the crowds and noise of downtown (I also used to work in a library...) 

My dietary restrictions are essentially paleo-pescetarian, and there were plenty of choices for me here, as well as my two meat eating dining companions. The meals each came with a soup or salad, the broccoli soup I had was fantastic and perfect for the rainy weather outside. I heard the boys talking about the dressing being really tasty and not too creamy, they seemed pleased. The fish I had was tasty although I'm not sure how it was cooked..I would have preferred it grilled or baked or something, but it was a little bland. Luckily the leeks and mustard sauce covering it was delicious and the seasoned veggies were the perfect side. Dessert was included I think, but none of us wanted the actual dessert that came with the meals. I have no idea what I ordered; it was the only choice NOT translated into english, but I saw 70% chocolate and was sold. It was like a little ice cream stuffed pastry or something, not too much and very reasonably priced. 

Great food and the service was good, although the staff was not super friendly...maybe they were just irritated at us for coming in so late. Although another table of 4 walked in after us and they sat them too, so I didn't feel as bad. Definitely on the romantic side but a very cute little spot for friends or family gathering too!"}
{"text":"I visited Le Bourlingueur one night a couple of months ago after catching the light show at Notre-Dame Basilica a few blocks away.  I really appreciated how authentic the experience was (I'm pretty sure my girlfriend and I were the only patrons that night who weren't speaking french).  To me, that's a sign that the locals enjoy the place too (which lends some credibility to it if you ask me).

I had the Duck Confit (Le confit de canard), and a bottle of the Trebbiano Chardonnay.  The duck was delicious and the wine was decent, though I somewhat regret not trying one of the French bottles.  

If you're like me, and you can't stand tourists (even when you are one yourself), this is definitely a great place to visit."}
{"text":"I've visited Montreal 3 times and have dined at Le Bourlingueur at least 4. We love this place! With a great location in the heart of old Montreal this place could easily get by with inflated prices and sub par food and service (ie La Sauvagine) However that's not the case, Le Bourlingueur serves Alsacian French food, that's wonderful and reasonably priced. I find Alsacian food somewhat of a German inspired French. Everything we've sampled there has been great. The place is comfortable and cozy with friendly service. The perfect place to have a nice dining experience in Old Montreal without breaking le banque."}
{"text":"Friendly service, cozy and nice atmosphere.
My friends and I spotted this place on the list of restaurants that do the mtlàtable specials (3-courses special) for $21.

For the entree, I got the millefeuille which was layers of beetroot and goat cheese. It was simple but yummy! The server also gave us some bread as it is a french restaurant. However the bread was hard and did not seem particularly fresh.

I got the salmon burger as the main but was disappointed. The salmon patty was good, but the bread was not fresh. The burger was a bit dry and when I asked for more mayonnaise or any spreads, they didn't have any. The burger was accompanied with a simple green salad. The salad did not have enough dressing though. It was a very home-meal style kind of dish. They can definitely improve!

However, the desert was yummy. I got the pain perdu. My friends got the chocolate mouse with raspberry, but their portion were small.

We also ordered some wine but there was some confusion with the price. The wines and their price were not on the same line. So, when we got the bill we were confused. The waitress showed us the menu again, and pointed that out. Honestly, we felt cheated. For the price of food and wine, I don't think it was worth it. I probably won't go back again."}
{"text":"Another don't miss in Montreal.  It's located in old Montreal in a lovely old building with big exposed beams.  I can envision eating here in the cold because there is a fireplace in the dining room.  I started dinner with a Kir which was very good, and my Husband had a beer.  We both had a mixed salad which were good but unremarkable.  I had the Sole special which was excellent.  My Husband had the Salmon which was also very good.  Both came with some sort of mixed vegetable and rice sides.  Even the side dishes were fantastic.  I'm not sure what the veggies were but I could have happily made a meal of just that, they were so good.  I also had a glass of the riesling with dinner which was very nice.  I had the Nut cake in a cream sauce  for dessert which was wonderful and my husband had the Strawberry mousse.   The service was very quick and the whole bill came to $69 including coffee.  This is a gem of a restaurant where you will have a great meal, with terrific service at an amazing price."}
{"text":"Had a very nice meal Sunday evening, the restaurant is very quaint. The server was blasé.  
The black board specials were not explained very well, it may have been a language barrier or compete indifference on her part but she failed to help us understand the preparations when asked. She droned in expressionless monotone \"there is lamb, a salad with ham and the lobster'.  Then complete silence pad and pen at ready.

So, we ordered off the regular menu:The seafood de mer, duck confit, and cod were all delicious.
If I am in Montreal again I would go back.  The setting and food were good.  Waitress perhaps a a bit tired or stressed out."}
{"text":"This is one of weirdest places I've ever visited:
- the dining area is well designed and carefully decorated, but restrooms look like in the gas station on the freeway
- most interesting part of the menu is written on the black board and not translated into English
- they serve beautiful snails, but have no good alcohol to match
- for the desert, my wife got a sandwich with ice cream. Literally a ball of ice cream between two pieces of bread. 

I've enjoyed my main course (lamb with mash potatoes - quite good), my wife didn't like hers (mackerel with caprese on top of it), and my daughter couldn't finish her pasta because first it was too hot for her, and then it became tasteless.

Can't say that it is a bad place, and the snails were quite good, but they definitely have room for improvements"}
{"text":"Solid Provençal cuisine. Liked the elegant south of France ambience. Very much like a Aix en Peovence cottage with stone walls and flowers. Was a bit disappointed in the bread - not proper bakery bread, just little toasts. Menu was not extensive and included 5 or 6 quiches."}
{"text":"Endroit très charmant, nourriture délicieuse!

A refreshing little gem that highlights some of the traditional German-influenced cuisine from the Alsace-Lorraine region as well as offering the usual French fare found at most restaurants in Montreal. The cheese plate had a standard selection of goat, triple crèmes, and blues, but from smelling the tantalizing aromas of the escargot from a nearby table, we would have gladly traded! My calf's liver \"meunière\"and onions was served table d'hôte, or prix fix, which meant that for around $20US it came with a creamy cauliflower soup, white wine spritzer aperitif, and an absolutely decadent carrot cake. The liver itself was phenomenal - tender, flavorful, and seasoned to perfection. Service was comme çi comme ça as we had to place our orders for wine multiple times throughout our meal, but all wrongs were forgiven when our waitress brought us freshly baked baguettes right out of the oven. The little loaves were so buttery, light and fluffy I could have just eaten them alone for a meal. Délicieux!

RLB epitomizes the best of what Montreal dining as to offer - quaint, uncrowded bistros serving authentic, savory, and relatively inexpensive French fare. J'adore!"}
{"text":"Restaurant de cuisine française correct.
Bonne table d'hôte (entrée, plat, dessert, café), même si le choix des dessert est restreint (vous n'avez pas accès à tous les desserts de la carte, même avec un supplément).
Néanmoins, il manque quelque chose... Je ne sais pas quoi...
Le service est hésitant, le vin plutôt cher et on vous substitut volontiers votre bouteille par une autre.
Tout juste le temps de finir votre assiette qu'elle est débarrassée, pendant que les autres finissent la-leur.
Les tables sont plutôt petites et l'on se retrouve vite à l'étroit... L'assiette pour mon pain, c'est retrouvée sous mon assiette de salade...
Nourriture testée :
Soupe à la tomate = très bonne
Vol au vent aux fruits de mer = très bon
Camembert à l'érable = bon
Dessert = pomme au four à la cannelle = très froide
Bref, on mange plutôt bien mais on se retrouve loin de l'ambiance française...
À la carte se trouve une choucroute."}
{"text":"I only ordered an appetizer, so I can't speak too much on the food. From the other dishes I saw, both the food and serving sizes looked good. I had the cheese plate which was a bit modest, but just what I needed for a snack. 

I found Le Bourlingueur to be surprisingly reasonably priced even though it's in the middle of a major tourist district. All of their entrees are about $20 and come with a salad/soup, dessert, and coffee which is a good deal to me. The servers were also attentive and nice, even though they were quite busy. Not a bad place to find yourself for a tourist break. Plus, the window seats are a great place to people watch in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Slow horrible service and subpar food. Seriously, worst service ever!!!! We walked out after 20 min.  AVOID this place like the plague!   

My french onion soup was burnt on the top. As in BLACK crisp burnt.  uneatable and disgusting, they tried to hide it by simply pushing it into the bottom of the soup hoping I wouldn't notice?  I showed the waiter and he said nothing. Seriously one of  the worst service and food I've ever had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"unpretentious, great french food... best part was they included a starter (soup or salad), Dessert and Coffee with the entree selection.  * Le Bourlingueur means The Traveler in French, perfect of this intimate little place located in the tourist part of old Montreal, just behind the Notre Dame Basilica.  It is ideal for a nice romantic dinner."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place for dinner our first night in Montreal, and if you're a fan of French food this is the place to go. 

Everyone enjoyed their meals. My dad got the sausage trio, my mom the quiche, my brother spaghetti and meatballs, and I got the seafood shell gratin. All were well prepared and the ambiance and service were fantastic. 

Mine was very rich but that's just there nature of the dish."}
{"text":"Restaurant trop cher pour ce qu on y sert ,service super lent ,bouffe plus qu ordinaire .N y allez surtout pas conseil."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

It's a price fixed listed on the menu itself next to the main dishes section.  Soup or salad, entree, dessert and coffed or tea all for $19.60.  I got the soup, celery potato that day.  Tad too celery-y for me so I gave it to my dining buddy.  I got the duck confit as state above and the skin was still crisp in some spots, tender and fall of the bone in other spots.  I want to have this all the time and learn how to make it.  My dining buddy actually picked up the leg bone and chomped off the rest of the meat I couldn't get hahaha.  It comes with a bed of sauerkraut which is a bit strange but it's Alsacetian food here (hence the German influence).  I got the roasted apple, meh.  Coffee was good.

My dining buddy's: garden salad starter, basic, nothing special.  Entree of cod with wild rice, bland overall, almost tasteless.  The veggies it came with were mushy.  The flan-like dessert was soooooooo good.  Halfway through the first beer, there was a friggin fly in it.  When shown to the waiter, he simply shrugged like \"Yea, and?\"  He didn't even comp the second beer.  Lost major points with me there.

All in all, duck confit and flan dessert thing, all for a really good price but that's probably about it."}
{"text":"Finally!  A resto that reflects the historic flavour of Montreal.

Dope:
- Cheese plate
- Rabbit pate
- Liver with onions
- Cod in mayo
- Chill and helpful service
- authentic French decor

I'm hella Bon Vivant, mofos."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices
Super nice people
Excellent main dishes

It's seriously all about the mains. I got a beef and carrot thing on macaroni while my dearest got some sauerkraut thing that was one of the evening's specials. Accompanied by a bottle of red wine, it was pretty fantastic. It made us seriously glad that we stopped in.

We had ordered a mushroom soup and a salad to start but neither was all that exciting. Dessert wasn't all that noteworthy either but honestly, between the super warm and friendly service and the savoriness of our mains our visit was more than worthwhile."}
{"text":"Really more of a 3.5. 

Quaint, charming and lovely restaurant. Good and amiable service. 

Their food has a home-cooked style to it - it's not particularly pretentious about food presentation, but it's confident in the quality and taste of the food itself. My brother ordered the duck leg (which was amazing and so tender) while I had the chicken breast stuffed with goat cheese.

All mains come with soup/salad and dessert. Please do yourself a favour and pick the lemon tart! My brother was a bit disappointed with his almond cake, but I definitely loved my choice.

Their wine menu was a bit odd, in my opinion. Maybe I'm not used to it, but I had to ask separately for the menu for wine by-the-glass. The menu had no description as to each type of wine - they were simply labelled 'Riesling', \"Pinot Grigio\", etc. Would have liked to know where it's from, from year, etc. I still enjoyed my wine, but it doesn't make sense to have to ask about each wine one by one."}
{"text":"We ate dinner. It is a lovely building and the service was great. I had the fish of the night and my husband had the seafood pot. Both were very good, but not quite as spicy as we had at other French restaurants. It was good and the presentation was okay. The price was wonderful. I would go there again."}
{"text":"August 2013: Fish special for lunch. Good french (Alsase) food, reasonably priced. In a party of three, everyone was very satisfied with their meals.

October 2013: I returned with visiting family and stopped in for lunch. Once again, tried the white fish special, and once again, great food. My Dad tried the duck and was interested enough in the unique flavor of side to put in a question to the chef. Two days later, my visitors mentioned that Le Bourlingueur was the culinary highlight of their week-long visit to Canada."}
{"text":"I was really excited to take my sister here for her 18th birthday.  56 Reviews and 4 stars I thought for SURE it would be supreme.  I thought wrong.  I ordered soup which tasted like green pea colored baby mush. My sister ordered the salad which consisted of lettuce and a few decorations.  The entrees came out.  My sister got the duck entree which had 'OK' sauce, but literally, where was the duck?! Very small portions.  I ordered the fish special on the board.  No flavor whatsoever.  It was so disappointing. I NEVER add salt to my food, and that's all I was doing every single time a plate came out.  For dessert we had the cheesecake - which was NOT cheesecake.  It was some sort of whipped cream in the shape of a slice of cheesecake.  By this time, my sister and I had to crack of laughing because what else could we have suspected at this point.  The beer was good.  I would ONLY recommend the beer.  Everything else was overpriced and had no taste.  I felt like I was at a nursing home where they tried to make the food LOOK delicious even though it doesn't have ANY flavor because it doesn't matter anyway because many elderly lose their taste buds at that point anyway."}
{"text":"Dined here my first evening in Montreal and it set a wonderful tone for the whole trip. They offer wonderful prix fixe menus. I started with the escargot in garlic butter and it was mop-up-your-plate-with-the-fresh-baguette delicious. My main course was the coquille des fruite des mers (seafood in a shell) which was also fabulous. Dessert was walnut cake which was good but nothing outstanding. A full carafe of wine (ordered because I didn't realize the conversion--a half litre is really enough for two people, take note!) was reasonably priced at $25.  Service was excellent; he even patiently gave me recommendations of places to go around town when I asked questions.

Absolutely a must to dine at again when I return to Montreal.  Run, don't walk there (but call first for a reservation, it is a small place).
Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a romantic dinner with excellent service from the owner at this charming restaurant in Old Montreal. We felt like we were dining in France! We chose the cheese plate for starters along with the dry red house wine. We chose fixed price meals--spinach soup and a salad preceded  baked turbot and grilled salmon both served with rice and perfectly cooked zucchini and a broiled tomato. Dessert was coconut cake and carrot cake  ( a tad dry) served with decaf espresso coffee. We would highly recommend to others and would gladly return ourselves to this gem."}
{"text":"Even with my trusty Garmin navigation buddy I had some trouble finding this treasure.  I'm a real sucker for escargot and ordered that instantly.  The waitress informed us about the $25 special that gives you an appetizer, soup or salad, entree, a glass of wine PLUS dessert!!  An unheard deal in this area!  

The snails arrived piping hot with a basket of bread n' butter.  I swore that my tongue had its first orgasmic encounter as I struggled to chew slowly and savor while sopping up all the remaining juices with the French bread.  

Beef stew, as recommended by other yelpers did not impress.  Inconsistency of this dish was evident as the larger meat chunks were not as moist as the smaller ones.  The gravy, carrots and potatoes helped this along for an average selection.

Glazed leg of duck, on the other hand, put me back on track! The skin contained the ideal combination of a light crunch with  dark duck meat revealing its soft and tender qualities.  Perfect!!

Dessert finish slowed down the race for 5 stars as the carrot cake was dry and cold.

This place is a definite must for anyone visiting Montreal.  I actually caught a glimpse of Jerry Seinfeld chatting with his friend as I parked my car.  How cool is that??"}
{"text":"Hungry for a late lunch, we stopped into Le Bourlingueur after finding out that Le Petit Moulinsart down the street was closed for good.  

Dining room was empty but service did not disappoint.  We were greeted and shown to a table close to the window, perfect for people watching in Old Montreal.

We ordered the L'express du Bourlingueur ($11.95) which turned out to be an onion tart, accompanied by soup of the day (asparagus), green salad, dessert of the day (strawberry shortcake) with coffee and tea.  Others in my party ordered Les escargots a l'ail ($7.95), La salade verte ($5.95) and La soupe a  l'oignon gratinée ($9.75).  We washed it down with a couple of white wine spritzers ($4.95).

Food was mostly good.  My onion tart could have been a tad warmer but the meal was an exceptional deal since I got an appetizer, main and dessert with coffee for $12.  In a touristy area like Montreal, I was expecting to be gouged but pleasantly surprised by the fair pricing.  Friendly, accomodating service is also a plus.

Le Bourlingueur is a good option in the area and glad we found it as a Plan B."}
{"text":"A very very fine meal, kind and informative service. Would go back again. I enjoyed the Alsatian sausage and ham mit potatoes and awesome kraut. Salad and carrot cake desert were very tasty too. He 'table' price was worth it and reasonable."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on my last trip to Montreal. We stumbled upon this lovely corner restaurant in the Vieux Port. The hostess was ever so pleasant. She seated us next to a window and were greeted promptly by our waitress who explained the table d'hôte deal where you get a soup, salad amd desert with your main course. Which, at 15 CAD is a good deal. But I opted for just the beef stew over noodles. The beef was absolutely tender and flavorful. Thr flavor of the red wine shone through. My only complaint is that I ordered sausage and potatoes for my son which ended up being really a hotdog and potatoes. Otherwise a great place to be hungry in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Our dining experience here was a bit mixed. Since we were a large group, we got to sample a considerable chunk of the menu. Overall the food was a little lack luster. Nice presentation, good portion, but just not as well rounded in taste as I expect when dining out. 
All starters disappointed to some degree: the mushroom soup did not taste of mushrooms, the gaspaccio was a little bland and the salad slightly limp. 
The main courses were a bit better. Especially the cream sauces on the fish and seafood dishes were very nice. But the goat cheese chicken was dry, and the red cabbage lacked vinegar and was therefore bland. 
The baked apple for desert was scorched and served cold. This was nicely complemented by the beer which was served warm.
Overall I have to say that I could have prepared most of the dishes myself at better quality, and that is not what I go out to dine for. Especially at French restaurants I expect a bit more inspiration and a treat for my taste buds. 
Overall I still give this three stars because the food was relatively inexpensive and service was good."}
{"text":"My fiance and I stumbled upon this wonderful bistro during our first visit/day trip to Montreal and we LOVED every moment of our meal here!

For $35 CA/person, we each ordered soup or salad, appetizer, entree, dessert, coffee or tea and about 3 glasses of white or red wine.  Certainly a steal for fine dining, especially after having lived in places like SF or DC!  On top of that, we each received a complimentary cup of French onion soup.

Together, we ordered the escargot, rabbit pate, duck leg and smoked salmon.  The escargot was warm and buttery and just melted in our mouths.  The pate was kind of like cold meatloaf - I myself am not a huge fan of pate, but when in Rome...why not?  I ordered the duck leg for myself and the portion was great, as it came with squash and potatoes!  My fiance ordered the smoked salmon - and he says it was the best smoked salmon he's ever had!  

For dessert, we ordered the apple pie and coconut cake.  I would loved to have creme brulee or another typical French dessert, but they were not part of the deals.

The sauvignon blanc I had was crisp and subtle, meanwhile my fiance's cabernet was mild and went very well with the food!

This was probably one of the best meals I've ever had!  Service was excellent, too!"}
{"text":"Awesome! I am usually very skeptical about eating in tourist areas, but this was really good. Quaint tables, friendly staff, and delicious food. We tried the escargot, French onion soup, glazed leg of duck, and carrot cake. The French onion soup was really the BEST (as they advertise). Tons of flavor, not too salty, loaded with cheese. The duck was also cooked to perfection. Love how the entrees come with soup or salad, dessert, and coffee or tea. Perfect amount of food for the price. 

We highly recommend this oasis in touristville!"}
{"text":"Incredible!
This was down the street from where we stayed and we read about this restaurant in a Montreal tourist book (yes, we brought one of those touristy books with us on our trip! We also made sure we read it in the middle of the sidewalk, so everyone could see, to be funny). This place was so accommodating and the staff was really friendly We were running late for our reservation so our B&B called for us and changed our time. When we arrived, we were greeted with a smile, even though it was 30 minutes before closing time. We weren't rushed at all.  I ordered the shrimp dish was was recommended by our tourist book (haha) and it was amazing. LOVED it. \"M\" had beef stew with carrots and red wine sauce. Excellent! We ordered from the Table d'Hote and had a bottle of wine, for about $80. Very reasonable and the food was excellent. We would highly recommend this place to anyone dining in old Montreal."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in my yelper pals..  No way this place deserves a 4 average. Onion soup was mediocre, salad had just mixed greens and onions.  My \"shrimp\" and scallops in cream au gratin was not good at all the shrimp were just bigger than brine shrimp all overcooked and cheese dry and cold on top. Carrot cake (free) desert was not worth the price.  The waitress was nice though. Wife liked her liver.  The salmon was dry and the sausages looked like raw hotdogs. Stay away. Very tourist-trappy"}
