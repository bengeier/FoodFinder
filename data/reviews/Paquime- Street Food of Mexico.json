{"text":"This place is a little glitzy for a taco joint but the ribeye tacos are out of the world great.  Would eat them everyday if I had a choice."}
{"text":"We tried this last night for the first time. Place was very clean. Lighting was minimal, it seemed really dark inside. We both ordered the fish tacos and an order of chips and salsa-to go. Fish tacos were amazing, they had a tasty orange sauce on them. There are three tacos in an order. Plenty of well seasoned fish on each taco. The tacos came with lime wedges, extra orange sauce and a green salsa, and a grilled green onion that I wasn't sure what to do with. The chips are made in house I believe, they were delicious. The salsa was really good, not spicy(which I like), and not super tomatoey. It was more orange in color and it had a little sweetness to it. I don't know if it's standard for each order of chips and salsa, but a large container of awesome guacamole was in our bag too. We will definitely be back, I need to try the ribeye tacos that everyone else is talking about!   I returned a few days later to try the ribeye tacos. I ordered the ribeye tacos and chips and salsa to go. I ate the tacos and some of the chips. Later that evening, I was going to eat the rest of the chips and salsa, when I found an unidentified object that looks like a fried bug or bug part on one of my chips. The business was closed when I found it, so I brought it in the next morning. One of the chefs was the initial person I showed it to. He couldn't tell me what it was. He brought in another employee from the back kitchen, who told me it was a piece of potato. Sorry, does not look like potato to me! He asked me if I wanted another order, I said no. He asked me if I wanted my money back, I said yes please. I had also brought back the containers of salsa and guacamole. The employee proceeded to open the containers, then gestured to them, as if a refund was out of the question because the containers were not full. Well no sir, I unfortunately did not have the pleasure of finding a nasty 'something' in my food until I had already eaten some of it. There was half of the container of chips left, and half of the salsa and guacamole. Which is beside the point. The employee just kept shrugging his shoulders and pointing to the containers. I asked if there was a problem issuing a refund, and he just said 'well', and pointed to the containers again.  I told him to keep his money and his food. He told me I could try coming back later. I walked out after he said that. I didn't bring the food back to get $4 dollars returned and 'get something over on them'. I'm not in the practice of trying to get food for free, which is what he was insinuating. I brought it back because I thought a food business would care that they served something questionable. Stuff happens in restaurants, but make it right. I have my ideas of what it is on that chip-make it right. I will definitely not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"I discovered this place while driving to Long John Silvers, don't get me wrong, I love that place but I changed my mind last minute and ended up here. As I go through the photos on yelp, I seen that they had elotes (Mexican corn on the cob) and was excited! (Also their tacos looked good) but I got the super nachos and the corn in a cup. What a disappoint that was! The corn in the cup was super runny and soupy, the cashier asked if I wanted lime and I was like sure but however there was too much. The lime flavor with the soupy crumble cheese corn on the cup was a turn off and that's surprising because I believe the \"recipe\" of the corn is simple, too simple to mess up yet I was proven wrong. This is the first time  I was actually dissatisfied with corn in the cup that I only took 3 spoonfuls. Even in Los Angeles at the Garment District where they have street food and the corn in the cup, it isn't made THAT watery. After that I was hoping the Super Nachos would redeem this place but it turned into a flop as well. I did notice the Nacho Cheese machine but still went with it anyways because I never really experienced anything bad from that machine nacho cheese. I stress about the nacho cheese (lol) because it did leave a nasty after taste, you would only experience this after taste with cheap cheese. They could of least hooked it up with whatever cheese they use at Taco Bell, come on now. However the steak was good and the guac was good on the nachos, I was pretty much hungry at this point so I split the nachos in half and ate them regardless. We ordered 2 corn in the cup and nachos (she says it can feed 2 but..I think 1 person) 2 drinks, came put to 21 dollars...I wish I could go back and change my mind to continue in route to Long John Silvers. I believe this place just opened so maybe in the future I will come back and try their tacos."}
{"text":"Great place for Street Tacos! You definitely will be full once you leave this place. The workers are very kind when you have questions to ask. The only problem I have is the seat placing. There isn't enough seats in the restaurant so sometimes you're forced to eat outside or take it home. The tacos are worth it though! Great place to eat! Will come again!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent! Good prices under $10 . A little bit of  everything on the menu. They have soups of the day and you can ask for a sample. Really good  place to have eat. Modern decor with an at home feel."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican fare! Friendly, clean, & high quality. Chefs are in view of the dining area, fun to watch."}
{"text":"Come here with my teenage son often who is a carne taco expert consumer. He loves the ribeye tacos as do I. Also the fish tacos are really fresh. Each day has a soup special. ALL are good. I didn't know that street food of Mexico included a variety of soups (very affordable) you'd see at more mainstream restaurants but I'm sure glad they have it! Two different flans also."}
{"text":"The ribeye and fish tacos are AMAZING.  But do not overlook the tortas and breakfast burritos.  The chorizo is one of my favorite choices.  I haven't yet tried the pan dulce, but the ice cream is the best ever.  Clean,  Friendly,  Stylish.  Go to Paquime NOW!  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Good food, good price and great service! The ribeye tacos were delicious. My husband had the paquime torta and didn't leave any bites! The staff is so friendly, definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I work down the road and I eat here once a week. The place is always clean, the service is good most days. The food is what keeps me coming back! Yum!"}
{"text":"Tacos were great! Soup was great! Very friendly staff.  Marcelo went out of his way to give me recommendations."}
{"text":"Really pleasantly surprised!  Great fresh flavorful food. Welcoming environment and friendly responsive staff.   I had the fish tacos. Street size portions. Very yummy with a great presentation!  I can't wait to come back and try some other stuff off their menu!"}
{"text":"Finally a semi-fast food Mexican restaurant that has fabulous authentic food and modern, stylish, clean decor along with awesome service.  The menu has a specific street food of Mexico focus and executes on that very well. In addition to street tacos, burritos and tortas served on white plates, they have bakery desserts, ice cream and super delish popsicles.  This is our new favorite fast food spot for Mexican food in the valley."}
{"text":"I seriously could eat here everyday!!!!!  Once again Rib Eye tacos are bomb !   The soup is always delicious :)  And today we added the super nachos .... Huge!"}
{"text":"Wonderful yummy food of all kinds! I love this place. The whole staff are absolutely the best at what they do! Do not forget desert- Caramel Flan is my fave!"}
{"text":"I love paquime so much. Everyone who works there is very kind and tolerant to all teenagers after school. The food is always great and I have never seen an order gone wrong. There is something for everyone there. I always recommend it to my family and people are addicted."}
{"text":"Driven past this place a few times with intentions of stopping in one day. Today was that day and my taste buds and tummy were glad that I did!  The restaurant is small but super clean and nicely decorated. Definitely not your typical taco place.  I had the ribeye tacos and they ask you how you want your steak cooked when you order. The order comes with four tacos garnished with a slice of avocado and finely chopped cabbage on a flour tortilla. Aside from the really nice presentation which I'm totally a sucker for, the tacos were ah-maze-ing!! They obviously use quality ingredients and it was totally worth the $7.50! I will most definitely be back to try out some other menu items!"}
{"text":"Thier customer service needs work.  My to go order was sitting there for five minutes getting cold while the girl cleaned tables, filled napkins and walked by it several times.  Their workers kind of seem oblivious to getting hot food out quickly.  They did remake the order, but this isn't the first time this kind of thing has happened.  Just make sure your on top of them to get your food."}
{"text":"This place is adorable. Great daily soup, good prices. Pleasant find! Sweet treats and Popsicles too!"}
{"text":"First time customer: The place is nice,clean and plays good music... Food: I got the Rib-eye steak tacos which were pretty good nice and fresh meat Seasoned!!...BUT...The Salsas were a very very BIG DISSAPOINTMENT!! No Flavor!! No Heat!! I  NEED MY SAUCES ON POINT!! Please UPGRADE...PS I will still be back to try the other menu options tho haha"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food and environment here!! Salsas were delicious! I had the Sunday Pozole, definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"After talking with the owner I have decided to update my review.  I did get my order replaced and was very happy with the food.  The owner made an exceptional customer recovery and was very understanding and helpful.  He did offer me the apology that I thought was due and I am now a happy customer.  Thank you Paquime for making it right.    Staff is not well informed in their own products not vegetarian friendly.  I went today for lunch and the place was really packed which at first I thought was great because it meant the food should be delicious the inside tables were all full so I did my order to go.  After ordering the Vegetarian Paquime torta I waited 25 minutes for my order to be ready.  Once I got to my work I noticed that my torta had meat.  I wanted to call the store but the receipt did not have the phone number listed.  The rest of my break was spent calling the store.  When I explained this ordeal to the employee she laughed, just plained laughed.  After a few minutes the manager, Bania, got the phone, she told me that they did not have a vegetarian torta since the Paquime comes with pork. I told her that their menu  reflected otherwise, since it listed the torta as a vegetarian option and that is the way I ordered it  after asking the cashier what came with it (which the girl that took my order did not know) and I did not think it was funny that her employee laughed.   Bania, then said well what is the problem with your order then?  I explained to her that I just wanted to inform them about the mistake that was made but that I did not appreciate that her employee laughed and that noone apologized and by now my whole lunch was over and I did not have anything to eat.  The situation was not handled profesionally, and yes I know I could have just taken the meat out, ate the darn thing and everyone is happy, but I wanted to inform them about the mistake so it could be avoided in future.   This place did not impress me and will more likely stop me from going again."}
{"text":"It says street food, but don't be fooled. It is quality food from a talented chef. Highly recommend the carne asada nachos, but bring your appetite."}
{"text":"I had lunch wit my bf here . The place looked pretty pack . Very small dinning area . It's seems like A/C wasn't on it felt hot inside. The food looks more delicious on website. For a full blooded Mexican I felt like the meat needed more seasoning. My corn torn tortillas were a bit hard. For the Size of the tortilla I felt like my tacos weren't full. It's true what they say you get what you pay for. First time and last time."}
{"text":"This place is promising. It has been around for over a week only. I order the sopes and they were simply delicious. The place was very clean, I did not use the restrooms so I can not comment on those.  I am super picky about restrooms if a  place has dirty restrooms I will never go back. The cashier was very kind. She was Patience and explained me everything. There was a gentleman welcoming you and going table by table asking if everything was ok. Talk about service right? ...Great! Something makes me think he was the owner. They have Pan Dulce, and the basic street food as they promise on their advertisement. Also I loved the back sign on their shirts....\"We can not sell happiness but you can buy our Strawberries with cream which is pretty much  the same thing.\" I thought it was hilarious.....  I will definitely go back and will try the flautas.....  One recommendation...the containers by the salad bar are extremely little. You need bigger containers or zip-lock bags for take out orders. I took out my order and it was difficult to bring home  the delicious Cebolla curtida , pepinos and zanahorias, home.  Question...are dogs welcome to the patio sitting area? This area is full of pet lovers. If you allow them to bring them to the outside sitting area you might have more customers.....having a water container for the dogs is an marketing strategy  to  target pet lovers customers.  Congratulations and welcome to my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Omg there agua fresca that had cucumbers was SOOO refreshing and the service was really good to!!!"}
{"text":"There are some great Mexican restaurants in Sunnyslope but Paquime serves a good niche.  It's a great take out place but also a great place to dine in, with very modern and clean interior. It also serves up some high quality Mexican food: tortas, tacos, oh and the super nachos! Just too much good stuff to name in one review.  You really can't go wrong.  To finish it off, try one of the paletas or pan dulce for dessert."}
{"text":"Order at the counter and you'll be served at your table. Great tacos and a small but awesome little salsa bar. The chips are not good though. I wish I had not ordered them. A different soup made fresh daily. Nice dessert selection includes traditional pastries, cakes, flan, ice cream and fruit bars. One of my favorite neighborhood go to places."}
{"text":"get the ribeye tacos. the best tacos I have had. ever. I cannot stop going there and I tell everyone. best. ever."}
{"text":"My wife and I moved here at the end of August 2015. Before we relocated I started using Yelp to bookmark the places I thought would be good, Paquime Street Foods was one of the first and we have been eating here 2-3 times a week ever since, why? Because it really is authentic street foods of Mexico, except that the restaurant is sooooo clean and the people that work there are so professional and neat that its actually better than eating at a taco, torta or antojitos cart in the dusty Mexico streets, I can say that because I was born there, and plus its true.  Our favories so far have been the potatoe and cheese soup on fridays (get there early cuz it runs out), it tastes just like the one my nana and mom make, the only thing I would add would be some corn kernels. The rib eye tacos are way better tasting than any taco I have had in phoenix and taste as good or better than any taqueria in Mex., get em on flour tortillas. And my wife loves their tostadas and flautas, her favorite are the shredded beef ones. Weve also had their pozole, their broccoli soup is the best one ive ever had and i like to add a bit of Tapatio sauce to mine. We love their pork tortas, breakfast tortas and mexican hot dogs. For dessert, their pan dulce is so soft and sweet and one of the best crafted breads ive had, their flan is one of our favorite and their esquimales are also bigger and better tasting than the paleteros on the street in Mex.  In conclusion, this place is too legit, and we will continue to eat there regularly as long as they keep serving great food in this extremely clean and inviting environment."}
{"text":"Great experience. Clean and real good food. Had the ribeye tacos and nachos. Tacos were light and fresh. Tender steak. Was a bit suspect of the \"neon\" yellow cheese spread when it came out, but was presently surprised when I tasted the rich homemade cheese sauce. Didn't try the fresh pastries or ice cream. Go check this place out!!  Support local!!"}
{"text":"Great tasty food, reasonable prices.  I really enjoy going here - the food is always fresh, and they have an excellent assortment of sides and salsas.  There jicama slice alternative to the tortilla on their street tacos is a nice change up if you don't want the carbs.  There is not a lot of fatty fried food preparation here.  Their Cubana Torta is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Came across this place when looking for a quick lunch. The pollo tacos were great. I would definitely go back and try more."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. A lot of these trendy \"hipster\" wanna be taco joints in Phoenix could take some pointers from these guys. Well done Paquìme!"}
{"text":"I brought my family here to have posole because we have heard great things of this place.And let me tell you it was an awesome experience.Great food and good service.I would be coming back to Paquime restaurant.Dunlap and Central SE corner."}
{"text":"Still love this place. The food is awesome. Ribeye tacos are the best, and the chicken chipotle soup has a nice kick. Wish they served it everyday. I'd probably come more often if they did. It's really affordable."}
{"text":"Have been twice.  Very clean, cool space.  Have liked all the food I've tried.  Haven't found the one dish that is \"my\" dish but I shall faithfully work my way through the menu till I find it."}
{"text":"Hot dogs and tostadas are amazing and definetly has a traditional flavor delicioso  !!!! The tostada wad super fresh."}
{"text":"Love this place! I highly recommend the orange agua Fresca, carne asada super nachos, fish tacos and everything else on the menu. Wonderful, prompt service and they even let you sample the soup of the day."}
{"text":"Honestly the best tics we've Ever had. Had the rib eye tacos, wherever you are this place is not too far away. Fabulous!!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here on Yelp, I had the ribeye taco.  It was not clear from the menu board, but it came with four small tacos - rather than one large one.  Each contained a generous amount of meat, and it would be easy to split between two people.  There were a few different options for desserts and they looked great.  I will definitely split an order of tacos to save room for a dessert next time.  Tip:  Try the apple slices (not on the menu board).  They have some kind of thick fruity coating on the skin that is part tart and part chili - something that I have never tasted before but left me wanting more."}
{"text":"All I can say is amazing! This place has everything I've been looking for. Great food and horchata..not too sweet not too watery! ^_^!if you're in the neighborhood stop in and grab some!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican food places to eat. The service is unbelievably good and the fish tacos are simply delicious. The pastry and ice cream selection are always fresh and top notch. A frequent lunch spot for my colleagues and I!"}
{"text":"First time at Paquime and it was fabulous  had the ribeye tacos.  They were cooked perfectly.  The dish has so much flavor.  The place is adorable.  Staff was very attentive.  This place has so much charm. So happy it is in  Sunnyslope."}
{"text":"Better than Mexico ! (and a much shorter drive). The ribeye tacos are great, but for authenticity you can't beat the tacos al pastor. One bite and I was right back at that little neighborhood restaurante I used to go to in Tijuana when I was in college. Torta (pan) was soft and fresh and the made to order skin-on papas were a nice touch. This may be the best Mexican food in town."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for street tacos!  Carne asada steak tacos and soup of the day are a great mix!  The flavor of the meat is outstanding and the salsas are excellent.  Not the quickest turnaround time, but then again, it's a restaurant that takes pride in their food and it's all made to order.  Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and I have a few comments.   The atmosphere is more modern than your extremely Mexican restaurants. It meets a younger generation feel with the mason jar lights and the title on their walls. It's clean which is a must when I come eat.  This place is a Order at the register and sit and wait for your meal.   Menu was small and a bit pricey, but I can understand produce can be expensive some times. However with the price comes quality...the taste was wonderful. Certainly taste fresh, this is nothing like chipotle where the food sits there. It was clean and the fact that they had roasted yellow chiles--captured my heart.   Their presentation was 5/5 starts. Like my boyfriend says, \"you eat with your eyes first\" and it looked delicious. I throughly enjoyed myself here and will be back again"}
{"text":"Delicious food! I got the rib eye tacos and my Pop got a burrito. The tacos were prepared and seasoned perfectly. I would have liked the tacos more if there was more meat and less fat pieces but over all they were spot on for flavor. The addition of the Chile was enjoyable. Pops burrito was enough for two people. We will be back and I'll try one of the Tortas. Its very small and busy with very little seating. So come early or go later in the day to sit comfortably.  This is my new favorite place to go!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places! Food incresible, friendly staff and good, clean environment!  To top off everything, INCREDIBLE FOOD!"}
{"text":"I went in one day to get a menu to see if this would be someplace I would like to try. I was very impressed, staff was clean everything and the place looked spotless and the food looked good. The next day my husband and I tried it. Maisee helped us make our selection. She was super friendly, very knowledgeable of the food and very sweet. We chose the fish tacos and the four flautas. The food was amazing! Thank you for the suggestions, Maisee! This place is a hidden gem we will definitely be back frequently to try more food and I highly suggest others give this place a try."}
{"text":"Love the food!! And coffee.  Grate service.  I'll recommend and I will go back for sure. I got a flat to go, recommended by a nice girl which it was so good.. Thank you"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to get tacos. I highly recommend the rib eye steak tacos with a side of horchata :)  The meat has so much flavoring in it! My mouth is currently watering thinking about their tacos. This place is a must! It is also very clean inside! Check it out now!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous semi-fast food place! Had the tacos pastor, every bite was better than before. Fresh, clean, tasty."}
{"text":"friendly staff great cooks great food very clean place no complaints then u top it off with s delicious scoop of ice cream"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Rib eye tacos (7.49 for four) and flautas ($7 for four) were SO good. Condiment bar was awesome and everything is so flavorful. Best Mexican food I've had in a while and tastes just like Mexico!! Will definitely be coming back many times! Also their soup and ice cream was so good! And it's affordable!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Had few different items, from carnitas to rib eye tacos, super nachos the beans.. mmm.. can't wait to go back and try other items.  Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is my third time eating here, its excelente!  Tonight I had the lentil  soup and carne asada torte, both muy delicious and freah tasting.  Just asked my wife sitting across from me, will we come back?  She said, \"It's in the rotational now, of course.\""}
{"text":"I love Paquime! Nice, friendly environment, A thorough salsa bar and Quality food for a great price. One word: Volteados."}
{"text":"Carne asada burrito, super nachos with carne asada, and the pozole are the way to go!!! They also have an amazing salsa bar."}
{"text":"We absolutely love coming here! They are so friendly and their food is great! I've tried every homemade soup on the menu and love every one. I always also get a pescado taco, which are great! And their ice cream is a must!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, but you have to get there before you are hungry. Super slow service!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING ribeye tacos!! These are a must!! The avocados, guacamole, sauces, and tortillas are incredibly fresh and soooo yummy!! They serve coke products too!! (Yay for me!)"}
{"text":"This was my favorite place to eat when I lived in Phoenix!!! I highly recommend it! My favorites were the breakfast burritos, Pastor street tacos and the soup of the day. The horchata and baked goods are also fantastic. You really can't go wrong with this spot. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is place is the TRUTH.   Best quick Mexican food around this area. Hands down.   All of the flavor combinations in their dishes are well done. Salsas are all absolutely flavorful and complement the food, rather than overpower.   The food spice ranges on the spectrum from mild to freaking hot, which is really awesome as well.  Great staff. Quick service. Go here."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place.  Everything is SO FRESH and homemade! It's wonderful that I can get the tacos in jicama instead of the tortilla. Prime Rib tacos are beyond delicious! The carne asada loaded nachos are sinfully good!  Ever since the first time I've eaten here I have been back at least once a week and I always bring someone new and they always LOVE it too! Do yourself a favor try this !!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend yesterday. This was my second time eating at Paquime. It's a great little spot to get a good Mexican lunch for a very reasonable price.  I ordered their Paquime torta with pork sirloin, avocado, and jalepeno. It was a decent sandwich, but was kind of small. But it was $6, which is very hard to beat elsewhere. The staff was friendly and helpful with our questions.  The best part for me was the massive sugar cookie they have. It's huge and delicious and to top it off, it was $0.59 (I think). Get outta here! I'll take 12 please!   This is a once every few months kind of place for me. But I enjoy it every time."}
{"text":"This place is not over the top, but if you happen to be hungry and in the neighborhood head over to this place for some tasty tacos!  Everything is flavorful. Not the best I've had in the valley though.   Food Guy Out!"}
{"text":"This is the highlight of my week. Post gym, ribeye tacos (medium well), two green salsas, green onions slightly grilled, pepper heavily grilled. The meal is done to perfection without fail."}
{"text":"No breakfast all day, sadly!  They stop at noon, so chorizo also becomes unavailable.  The employees were very nice about it though, especially the goateed gentleman who seemed like the supervisor/manager.  The lovely Mexican pastries that greet you are very affordable, though the flan is a touch expensive at $4/$3 (depending on the type).  My fish quesadilla was somewhat small, about the size of a Taco Bell one.  It was beautifully crispy with good flavors and actual texture, but was also $7.50.  It came with a small scoop of guacamole on the side.  My large slice of cheesecake from the pastry case was 99 cents, and had a very light texture.  The yellow cake like top layer gave it a good chew, and it was very creamy too.  I ate the entire thing, and I feel it balanced out the slightly small quesadilla in terms of overall value.  Atmosphere is okay, with wood and brick.  I can see why people are comparing it to Chipotle.  I definitely appreciate that they're trying.  The restroom was very nice and clean!  There was a strange chemical or burning rubber smell in the air when they were grilling something though.  Very unpleasant.  It was interesting to note they had a pretty strong Caucasian clientele coming in while I ate, so hopefully they will stay part of the neighborhood.  One of the employees started cleaning the glass right behind me just now and the Windex smell is really awful.  I'm going to be slightly generous with my stars and boost them up to 4, since they're a solid 3.5 and I really appreciate a slightly more upscale (clean, new) \"fast casual\" restaurant choice in the neighborhood.  Their dessert choices (pastry, cut fruit, ice cream, popsicles) really help set them apart from the competition."}
{"text":"This is a fun place and the food is fantastic period. So different, our third time here and the BEST fish tacos I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Delicious. They will mix & match tacos for the same price as a normal taco meal (~$8) We got 4 tacos, 4 beef flautas, and a cucumber aguas frescas for ~ $20. I was pleasantly surprised to see cotija and crema on top of the flautas."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible, I've had almost everything here and it's delicious, but the best part about this place is definitely Sariah the cashier! Her customer service skills are amazing! She makes the whole experience worth it"}
{"text":"The ribeye tacos and nachos are probably the best I've had in Phoenix. Plus, the chorizo breakfast burrito is a great start to any day. My daughter loves the fact that they have massive multicolored cookies for 59 cents!"}
{"text":"Had the Cubana torta and it was pretty good. I like the little kick of jalapeño in it. There was so many things I wanted to try, everything looked so yummy."}
{"text":"One word: Delicioso!   You gotta try it! All the ingredients are fresh and everything is made to order. The restaurant has a cool modern look and very clean. The staff is always friendly and happy to make suggestions. They will even offer you a sample of their daily soups if you're interested (and trust me, you are).   Be patient while they make your food. It doesn't take too long, but the chef it making it fresh for you right there chopping and grilling it up. It takes longer than similar restaurants, but trust me, it's well worth the extra few minutes (like maybe 3 extra, be patient).  Since you have 3 extra minutes to kill, check out their little garnish bar -- salsa, avocado sauce, radishes, carrots. Everything a traditional taco stand would have! Pick a few to try.   The Paquime salad is gigantic. It's piled high in a nifty lookin' bowl. Beware, the dressing has a bit of a kick -- it's not so spicy you can't eat it, but the spice builds with each bite. But it is so tasty you probably won't be able to stop eating it anyway.   The street tacos are simple perfection. I've personally had the ribeye and their are flavorful and juicy. Add a little salsa, their avocado sauce, or a squirt of lime. I'm drooling all over my keyboard...  And when you are done get dessert. No better way than to end the meal with some of their amazing traditional Mexican desserts. But don't take my word for it, once you see the cakes, pastries, and ice cream there is no way you can pass them up."}
{"text":"I'm soo happy this place in doing well! It no joke deserves ten stars!   The staff - Amazing, knowledgeable and helpful! Five stars  Food- FANTASTIC! They have a soup of the day which is always amazing. Unique yet traditional Mexican street food. Full of flavor! Everything! Nice portion sizes, and although the menu is on the smaller side I have yet to be bored.   Beverages- So fresh! Amazing options!  I promise that you will not be disappointed! I have a feeling I'll be back on a weekly basis!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner and got the veggie tacos. So savory! Highly recommend. Even the chips, salsa, and guac are great. Fun Spanish music was playing, mixed in with some Christmas tunes. Want to go back, especially to try some of those tasty looking pastries. Service good. The gals at the counter were happy and enthusiastic."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's really good food and drinks. They have a well stocked salsa bar. I love the micheladas with a corona. I get it very time! Small place that gets really busy but they have the outdoor patio. Definitely glad I was recommended this place and I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I AZ. Great prices, amazing food and awesome desserts. This is my new \"go to\" for Mexican food. This is good on the go or to ear there and they  have a patio. Leave room for ice cream"}
{"text":"The ribeye tacos are the best!!!!!! I eat here weekly. They have awesome soup as well!"}
{"text":"Service: Place took well over 25 minutes to prep my order, while the same girl that took my order had already sat down to eat her flautas lunch. Why did this take so long???!!  Food: Fresas con crema were creamy, yet light, we got it with the works which included oatmeal, pecans and shredded coconut! Simply delicious!! Tacos al pastor were flavorful, but the meat it self was too fatty. Mi Milanesa de res torta was divine!! This Milanesa was breaded just like any real Mexican torta would be, super authentic and to the point, goodies in it included avocado, lettuce, jalapeños and tomatoes, simply delicious!"}
{"text":"Incredible, authentic Mexican food.  They have breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The food is incredible, but make sure you don't pass up the desserts.  They have bakery items and gelato & paletas!    The aqua frescos are excellent as well. You won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"This place is great! I totally recommend it.  It's super clean  and has a real urban/modern feel.  Delicious food! !! I'm telling everyone about it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Super clean, friendly staff and delicious food! The location could be bigger but nonetheless it's worth stopping by. Loooove it!"}
{"text":"One of my go to spots as of recently. Love the decor of this Paquime, and the agua frescas are delicious. I am stuck on the Paquime torta, but the tacos are also amazing as well as the rolled taquitos. Highly recommend trying this spot if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Was craving Mexican food and found this little gem. I ordered the pastor tacos, 4 for $9 which wasn't too bad. I also ordered a side of beans, and chips and salsa. I wasn't sure why the chips were $5 but she gave me a big plate with salsa and guacamole. The tacos usually come with pineapple but I didn't want that. I did request queso fresco and it was free which is cool because that's usually an up charge. Overall, the staff was very friendly. The restaurant itself was small but really cute. The food was fresh and delicious. I'd definitely come back and recommend this place."}
{"text":"I just ate there for the first time. Probably the best fish tacos that I've ever had. Small pieces of fish, with a light and  crispy batter that was different than what I'm used to.  I tried the Salsas from their salsa bar, and they were smokey with deep and complex flavors. Both different from the other. A little pricey, but they have fresh-brewed iced tea and biodegradable Packaging and containers. Maybe they could have been a little more friendly, but the place was clean. They also serve beer."}
{"text":"My new favorite taco shop.  The pastor and ribeye tacos are so flavorful and delicious.  The salsas and grilled chile huedito are also perfect compliments.  Dont forget about the mexican hot dog Very tasty."}
{"text":"Great fresh & healthy 'fast food'!  Friendly staff.  Hopefully they open more around town soon!:-).   The guac is awesome!!  Fun refreshing drinks & yummy home made desserts and ice cream bars!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place with my aunt and boyfriend after reading Yelp reviews, and so glad we did! The food was  really fresh and flavorful, and the restaurant was clean and seemed well cared for. Staff was pretty friendly too! Would highly, highly recommend the esquitas!! Delicious food, will definitely be coming back. #fatisfied"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it was amazing! I suggest the street tacos. They have many different types. They also have good pistachio ice cream . I would recommend"}
{"text":"Very dissapointed with customer service. I noticed my last 3 visits others were served before me who had arrived after me. My meals were quite lengthy in time to receive although I ordered different items each time and they were quite simple. Upon discussing why this was happening I was told because if someone else has an order easier to prepare they may do them first. Well, some of us are on time constraints and don't wish to be treated in such a poor manner. I will not be giving them anymore if my business.   Just received this from Yelp. Guess someone complained and can't take the truth.

{"text":"The rib eye tacos are amazing!!! And that mango paletta is for WINNERS!!! So worth my drive from up north.   Go, go now. No, really GO!"}
{"text":"Goodness gracious this place knows how to cook up some mean tacos. Try the Volteados. I hardly ever go for pork, but the way they melt the cheese on top of the pork, then combine the dish with avocado and delicious hot salsa is an absolute party in the mouth. Nice authentic feel to the place too. Latin music playing and everything is written in Spanish. However, it's also got your good ol' white people Mexican food restaurant vibe. Lots of seating, cute servers, and a nice millennial atmosphere. Absolutely one of the best Mexican joints in PHX."}
{"text":"I really shouldn't be reviewing this place because I only have been once and only had soup...but I couldn't help myself.  The concept is absolutely hip.  Super cool.  The menu looked amazing.  When I first arrived I thought \"7.00 for a taco?\"  That was for THREE.  The wall menu doesn't indicate that and I suggested they fix that.  They have pastries and ice cream and I sampled the Pecan ice cream and it was amazing.  The young girl that works there was a wealth of information and very very nice.  She offered me a tasting of the soup within seconds of me walking in. We will definately go back!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Cool ambiance. Very clean.  Chips are terrible though cold and chewy. See if you can get a substitute. The cook said they make them in the morning and serve them all day...."}
{"text":"As mex goes, this is a bright spot in the land of many choices. Ordered the street corn for the missus and the rib eye tacos for me. The corn is cupped and with a kick to it. Authentic flavor and something different for a change.   When was the last time you were asked \"how would you like your steak done?\" For tacos no less! Ordered medium rare as it was a to-go. Sadly, I took a little peek at the 4-some, and they didn't make past the parking lot exit, devoured. Mucho sabor!   Try everything. Whoever owns this place, knows what they're doing.  Probably one of the best Mexi's around. Worth a trip."}
{"text":"This is a spectacular place on the corner of Central and Dunlap Avenue in the Sunnyslope neighborhood of Phoenix Arizona. It is a hidden gem that is quickly gaining great and well deserved acclaim for the unbelievable quality of food and the welcoming nature of its staff. With a limited liquor license you can also enjoy some beer and wine with tacos and Tortas. In cooler weather the outdoor patio is an unparalleled way to enjoy the food and beverage.  Start out with some papa-nachos, Fish tacos, volteados tacos and a Mexican hotdog.  Finish with a Napolitano flan for desert..o and try the watermelon agua Fresca.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"After my second visit I knew they deserve 5 stars sooooooo good great salsas one of the best I have ever had especially the salsa u get with the \"chips n salsa\" Ingredients are fresh great flavors and they have homemade ice creams and pastry that being daily made for amazing price"}
{"text":"Food is very very good.would love to come and eat here with my friends and colleagues during our office hours as well as weekends"}
{"text":"Nothing like the place,  love the food and my kids love the ice cream! Beat experience here."}
{"text":"Overall a decent place for mexican food. Most of the tacos are good with the al pastor being my favorite. The carnitas and chicken were a bit on the bland side and the rib rye was good but not the carne asada I'm used to."}
{"text":"Love the place, dessert and pan dulce looks really good. The staff is friendly. It's in a nice location and I expect the food to be good as well. It will take about half an hour to get your food despite the fact that there are only two other groups here, but if you have time, enjoy!"}
{"text":"The ingredients are fresh, and my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed their flavors. Also, any place serving free dessert samples is a win."}
{"text":"Paquime is located just south of the hospital in Sunnyslope. And it is definitely worth putting in your rotation.   It is a order at the counter and sit down joint like 90% of today's new restaurants but the difference is the chef will actually bring you out your food. It is relatively small inside but there is a little patio as well.   The food is the best part. The cream of zucchini is amazing!  Excellent flavor and little pieces of zucchini and corn. So so tasty.   The Flautas were topped with an avacado salsa, tomatoes, cucumber, lettuce, cotija cheese, and radishes. Basically a salad on the side.   The carne asada burro was also done right. The meat was fresh and well seasoned. The burro had beans and avacado as well.  Everything here was made fresh and taken an extra couple steps from your average place. There is also a salsa/condiment bar that is excellent.  Some places have 20 salsas that are all mediocre.  Paquime has three that are delicious.  The avacado salsa is amazing.  The arbol salsa is savory and spicy.  The verde salsa is also spicy and fresh.    I will be back and recommend you try."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great atmosphere, fantastic food. Every little detail of the food and atmosphere has obviously been meticulously perfected. The employees are professional and  take great pride and ownership  in making the guest experience rock."}
{"text":"Took them 24 minutes to deliver one plate of Ribeye Tacos.. They were alright, but the first time I went I got the burrotote and it tasted so much better!"}
{"text":"This place is going to be one of my new stops on my lunch rotation. Usually work in this area a couple times a week and now this just made it that much better. Hello Gourmet Tacos and then some!  Inside is very nice and rather modern looking. The menu items are written on some clear glass behind the counter and the soups of the day are displayed on a hanging roll of brown paper on the wall. Just place your order and find a table. You can see them cooking it in their small open kitchen.  Seating is somewhat sparse and there is an additional area out on the patio outside. Noticed a lot of people calling in their orders and picking them up once they were ready. This area definitely needed a place like this to pick things up a bit.  So far ... Ordered the Rib Eye Tacos on my first visit. They were perfectly cooked and were packed with flavor. Next tried the Mexican Hot Dog and the Torta Cubana. Very good and was too full afterwards for dessert. Today tried the Burrotote and some PapaNachos. Don't forget to check out the killer salsa bar with everything necessary to kick things up a notch.  Food is always very fresh and they use high quality ingredients. Been here several times and have not had a bad experience yet. Nice!  Too many cool things on the menu to list them all. How about fresh desserts made out of fruits, several kinds of flans, ice creams and yummy bakery treats to cap off the meal.  Service is very friendly and polite. Place is starting to get really busy and there can be small wait during peak hours. Did I tell you about the Soup of the Day? They will give you a sample to try while you wait.  Going to round up on this fine establishment. WOOHOO!  4.75 STARS"}
{"text":"We just recently found this gem.  The food is so fresh.  We've had the tacos, soups, and corn.  They also have the best chips around town.  Our new favorite place!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience!!! Talk about feeling right at home. Paquime \"Street Food of Mexico\" not only satisfied my need for authentic flavor but blew my mind with a beautiful setting and hygienic restrooms.  Had a rough time picking a dish due to the fact that everything sounded and looked soooooo good! But went with my gut feeling and indulged into the chicken flautas. (4 hand rolled taquitos, fried to a golden brown and delicious state,topped off with Mexican cream tomato onion avocado an avocado purée to die for and some queso fresco)  Paquime thank you for making my first experience an unforgettable one. The flan Napolitano took me back to my grandmas kitchen making me a firm believer that \"Paquime\" is true authentic Mexican food.  I will definitely be back with company in hand."}
{"text":"I'll make this review short and sweet just like this place.  Food is amazing no joke better than any place near this side of town.  The customer service A++++  Marcelo the Manager I believe, is soooooo nice, respectful and always treats the customers great.  If you are ever near this place stop by and thank me later."}
{"text":"Amazing rib eye street tacos and perhaps the best flan of our lives!  We'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"I like the service the staff provides and the restaurant is always kept very clean.   I have been here about ten times and I've never had a bad experience. Great for a nice lunch.   Be aware though -- there is very limited seating in this restaurant."}
{"text":"First time eating here and I'm impressed with the food. The presentation of the meal was beautiful with the modern feel. It was amazing to look at as well as the taste was very flavorful. I had the pastor tacos and chicken flautas, they both came with a great sauce on the side that added to the flavors. The place had a modern feel to it than other Mexican restaurants that I have tried with great lighting and friendly staff. Paquime is a very clean restaurant from the looks of it which is a must and I definitely will be coming back! Great variety of different menu items kept simple."}
{"text":"My wife and stopped by the other day and as soon as we walked in they offered us a sample of the zuccini soup with corn. Best soup I have had in a restaurant in very long time. In fact we ordered some and took some home it was that good! I had the ribeye torta. It was incredible of course, meat just melted in your mouth. My wife had the chicken ensalda salad. She loved it! I will say that in the last 16 years of living here and eating at many Mexican Restaurants. This is now my favorite! This is a must have for any foodie. Great staff! Super clean restaurant..........A true diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the hype is for this place. It's very hipster if that's your aesthetic but I digress.  The restaurant itself was clean which was nice but the salsa bar was literally empty. We were scraping the bottom of the pale for any salsa. It didn't have any chiles and the salsa cups are tinyyyy.  This place is expensive also. 4 steak tacos for $12 better be the bomb.com right? No sir. The meat tasted weird, I don't have any other description for it other than weird. It just didn't taste good.  I'm not sure how you can mess up cilantro but that tasted janky too. Did not taste fresh or even like cilantro.  The tortillas left a nasty film that coated the roof of my mouth.  The only positive was the frescas con crema had very fresh strawberries.   We went here on cinco de mayo because tacos are a must on such occasion and we were severely disappointed."}
{"text":"A really cool spot at the southeast corner of Central and Dunlap. Clean, very bright from big walls of glass facing the street and parking area, and simply but very tastefully decorated, this eatery serves upgraded versions of popular Mexican street foods: tacos, sonoran hotdogs, tortas, burritos, etc. The hot soups are really welcome on cold - and even not so cold - days, and there are ample desserts such as flans and cakes to satisfy any cravings for sweets. Good prices and very friendly service, though some items such as papanachos or elote en vaso (you have to ask for this; it was not in the menu during my last visit) may take a bit of time to prepare."}
{"text":"Curious to try this place as I saw them working on it for weeks.  Walked up on a Saturday morning around 11... greeted by the sound of... is that Bret Michaels singing \"every rose has it's thorn?\" on the loudspeakers.  Took away from the \"street food cred\" immediately for me.  Walking in you see a nice display of baked sweets in a glass display case.   Mine was a little dry but nice.  Service was extremely prompt and friendly throughout the experience, if even a little over eager?  As I waited for my meal, I looked at the black and white pictures of old school Mexican street eats, and Bret Michaels turned into Journey, then REO Speedwagon, only to be topped by Peter Cetera and Cindy Lauper.  Not sure what Mexican street these guys played on.  My lunch came on house baked bread which was very nice, potato chips were homemade and excellent.  Salsa bar has limes and cool cucumbers which contrasted nicely with the appropriate heat in my Torta Huevo con Chorizo.  I sat at 2 tables and all chairs, most tables and corners of floors were covered in crumbs.  I was the only one in the restaurant.  The first table was cleaned off quickly for me.  I am mixed on this place.  The ambiance was disappointing but the food was very good.  I guess... wait for it... every rose has its thorn?  Barump."}
{"text":"While greasy taco shops have a special place in my San Diego heart, this is a welcome step up. The food is fresh, high quality, and delicious! The ribeye tacos are pretty much my go to...I get them about every other time. My second favorite are the esquites which is way easier than trying to eat the corn on the corn. I get the toppings on the side which they never give me a hard time about. Overall, the approach of the restaurant is to provide fresh quality Mexican food with a sustainable approach. This place is definitely one to keep on rotation!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Kinda small but it actually helps the atmosphere. Nice and new. Amazing service. I liked a lot of things about this place. The kitchen is actually in front so you can see what's going on. Guy cooking is wearing a chef coat and looks highly professional.    Food was great. Still need to try out a few other things. Glad I stopped by. Will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"This is a really good place to eat. I go to a group meet hear once a month. Last year one of the members of this group asked if we can continue to use Paquime as our meeting location because the food is amazing, the staff is courteous and fast with the orders. I really like the place, it's really great to find such a good location with fantastic food."}
{"text":"I love this spot. Best steak tacos I've ever had. Awesome service too. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love the salsa and fresh choices! I am coming back for sure and worth the few miles drive.  I got the medium spicy salsa which has the pepper flakes on the carnitas and chicken tacos. I also like that their tacos are on corn for lighter and GF options. This place reminds of a more modern Baja Fresh which had great salsas, especially the chipotle."}
{"text":"Great place. Very modern take on a small mexican spot.  You order at the counter and then they will deliver the goodies to you.  I had the Esquites, the mexican corn, I was confused and ordered this one instead of the street corn.  The Esquites comes in a container, not the cob.  It had a little bit too much mayo for my taste, but overall it was good.  Next time I will have it on the cob.  I had a couple of tacos and they were very good.  There is a salsa bar at the entrance.  The desserts were super delicious, I had the flan napolitano, which is my favorite, almost cheesecake like consistency.  And the Tres Leches cake was also yummy."}
{"text":"Possibly the best $4 sandwich I've ever had I've been trying to think of a better one. Lentil soup was terrific as well. The place is clean staff is nice and friendly prices are reasonable and food is very good. Drip coffee is surprisingly good too I think they get it from the coffee shop next door."}
{"text":"\"Street food\" is my favorite kind of Mexican food. There's nothing more awesome than the cheap, simple, bite-sized tacos you buy at a roadside stand in Mexico or Tucson (an extension of Mexico). Phoenix has its share of roadside stands...but they ain't no Tucson or Mexico. Awesome dirty hole-in-the-wall places where employees don't speak English? Phoenix has tons, and they are great.  Tortas Paquime is a chain of five or so small restaurants focusing mainly on the torta. I didn't realize it growing up, but Mexicans know how to make an awesome sandwich. Honestly, the only sandwiches I get really excited about in any global cuisine is the torta. \"Street Food of Mexico\" is a new concept from Tortas Paquime - a clean, fast/casual restaurant that sells street tacos, tortas, aguas, and other offerings typically found at out of the way restaurants in low-rent buildings.  The food is really pretty good. I had the hot dog, which is not as good as the Sonoran hot dogs found in Tucson, but respectable in its own way, and the Rib Eye tacos. The tacos were simple enough that they can almost be considered real, bonified street tacos, with the meat being the main ingredient, and some avocado thrown in just to make it more awesome. Actually, they kind of straddle the line between street tacos and fancy tacos.  The cucumber agua is superb. They also had horchata and jamaica, and while I love me some horchata and jamaica, it's hard to pass up on cucumber agua. I never see that!  Paquime does sacrifice a little bit of authenticity so as to make white people feel a little more comfortable. There's not necessarily anything wrong with that - the spirit of Mexican street food is still alive in this food, even if it is served amid the bland, yuppie decor typically associated with worthless faux-Mexican schlock like Chipotle and Cafe Rio.  This is a quality addition to the Sunnyslope area. There are definitely better, more authentic Mexican places in the area, but this is not a bad concept at all, and it's executed pretty well."}
{"text":"The spices are different than what I'm used to - it grew on me as I ate. Fresh food, Mexican bakery items (and frozen dessert items, too) - good value for the money Definitely need to come back and try some more of their menu items!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, homemade chips and bread.. nice interior.. friendly service"}
{"text":"Real simple review... if you love tacos .. try this place .. Taco selection includes: Pastor Camaron  Pescado Ribeye Voltedos  Barbacoa  Carnitas  Pollo  and Vegi   all served by courteous staff in a clean environment   What is not to like?"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, we had flautas and torta cubana, they were awesome, very friendly staff and great atmosphere! Highly recommended  !!"}
{"text":"Quality food, presented beautifully, in a very clean restaurant.  Awesome cucumber drink, a must try. The rib eye is a must to try, fabulous flavor, love it on the tostada, with beans and delish cheese, wish I didn't tear into it before I took this picture.  Lol  Fish tacos have great quality piece of fish, they just need to make sure oil is fresh.  Employees are wonderful, very sweet, helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"Wow'zer this is my first time here, and love the freakin food! I had the Ribeye Tacos. I like the interior design, very clean here.   Get here before lunch hour. Place gets flooded."}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican Cuisine joint! I had the rib eye tacos cooked to my preference (medium rare) with shredded cabbage & fresh avocado. The creamy green sauce was paired perfectly! They have a whole different spin on Horchata which I enjoyed thoroughly! My wife had the barbacoa tacos and polished them off. Our kids loved their wonderful pastries. The staff is nice and pleasant. This quaint little restaurant is very clean, up to date and well worth it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great tacos. Clean environment and atmosphere.  I had the ribeye tacos. They were very good."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican joint !  And it's super clean . This is the \"Mastros \" of Mexican street tacos ."}
{"text":"Wow this place is wonderful.  While I working at JCL Hospital I happened to walk to the outside mall and found Paquime.  Not only did I eat this almost everyday for lunch I had everyone else at the hospital addicted to it too.  I ordered the fish and shrimp tacos with the chips and fresh homemade salsa.  Unbelievable.  First time for me that the salsa hands down tasted better then the guacamole.  OMG I can't forget the soups.  If you are in the area this is a must go to.  It has a small eating area, beverages (I think beer) and sorbets/ice cream.  Nice, quaint, clean restaurant with plenty of parking.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Very spacious area with great service. There is a beautiful display of fruit with colorful fruit drinks."}
{"text":"Chicken tacos not on the menu but are to die for!! They come with a dollop of guacamole and a convenient potatoe chip to shmear on the tacos. Perfect filling!!!"}
{"text":"I used to really like this place, despite being a little over priced. But after the poor service from my last few visits, I'll never go back again.    Here's what happened the last time. Last Sunday (Sunday September 25, 2016) I tried to call my order in but no one answered.  I checked their hours and yup, they're supposed to be open.  I had to drive by on my way somewhere else so I stopped by but 30 minutes after they're opening time the doors were locked and they still weren't open.    A young lady comes to the doors and says, \"We need 10 more minutes to open.  He's not ready yet.\"  So I wait and when I get my order, it's all wrong.    I gave Paquime plenty of chances because I liked the menu but have lost my patience for people who don't respect customers enough to provide good customer service."}
{"text":"The food is great and made with one ingredient that many leave out....LOVE. The staff is always friendly, great to talks with the chefs. Prices are extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"Wow, I was pleasantly surprised by this place. We were in the Sunnyslope area  around lunch time yesterday and as we were contemplating our options I saw this restaurant right in front of us. Of course, I get the scoop on Yelp first and I'm interested. I was really impressed upon walking in and immediately knew that we would be ordering. Everything seemed so fresh, clean, modern and professional. The menu was intriguing and we saw many worthwhile options for us. In the end, we picked up the items that would travel the best and not be too messy in the car. The kids were happy with their meals and I loved my torta. Unfortunately, my wife thought her breakfast burrito was a bit mushy, but she still thought it was tasty. Might hold the beans next time. The gentleman that helped me at the counter was extremely pleasant. Overall, a very nice experience and we'd gladly pop by again when in the area."}
{"text":"We love Paquime! If you come for breakfast, the breakfast burrito is a must. Dinner, the Paquime torta is killer and everything is fresh and made to order. Can't say enough good things. Great value for the money, too, and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Everything was SOO GOOD !!  Great way to finish off our stay in Phoenix ! Sarahi was extremely helpful !  & super cute interior !!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late \"birthday dinner\" for my partner and his sister.  Lots of vegetarian options and the staff were very friendly!  Our orders didn't take too long to come out and they didn't seem to mind us hanging around after the meal (we were there a while).  Overall, I'd definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"More beans than meat in the carne burrito. And potato chips instead of real tortilla chips as a side. Not impressed. Maybe I will order something different next time clean facility. Friendly cashier."}
{"text":"Not bad, good variety of different traditional items, very modern and clean. However, big disappointment with the elote en vaso. It tastes sweet, like canned corn. It's a bit of a slap in the face to the traditional elote carts in the streets of Mexico. They would never serve this crap. My girlfriend and I drove all the way down just for this and we couldn't even finish it. Literally left a bad taste in our mouths. I hope the owner/manager reads this and makes the necessary adjustment to this particular item. Just imagine eating sweet corn with mayo and little salsa Valentina. Just doesn't do it justice."}
{"text":"The Ribeye tacos were very good.  But make sure you look at the paper menu to order it has more detail about the food.  Just a different type of Mexican food, always looking to try something new.  The desserts looked really good, but I was too full to eat!  Should have tried something to go.  Also had a taste of their potato soup, it has green chilies, very good."}
{"text":"Nothing but great things to say about this place. The manager is 17 year old who is very personable and made sure I liked what I had ordered. The food and the experience and was enough to give this place 5 stars. Try the agua frescas."}
{"text":"Great food always. Wife loves the veggie tacos using Jicama as taco shell. Best cochinita pibil that I have had and I have had it at nearly every restaurant in the valley that serves it. Great on tacos--you just have to ask for it or--on a torta.  Then top of the meal with fresas con crema. Now if I could just convince them to open up a Paquime's closer to me near New River."}
{"text":"The best mexican food from all Arizona. My favorite: torta milanesa, torta cochinita, ribeye and pastor tacos."}
{"text":"The ice cream is amazing!!! The tacos and tortas are great as well and the staff is very friendly. I recommend all my friends and co workers to go."}
{"text":"Try the jicama taco shells! Some nutritionally sound choices can be found here. I like to have the chicken tacos this way. Every menu item I've had had been good, and everyone who had come here with me has felt the same way."}
{"text":"Some of the best \"street\" mexican i had.  Good tacos, great guac.  The mex corn was super yummy."}
{"text":"Great find. They don't usually take reservations, but they did for our big group. Small place and really good. Chicken Sopas (which I'd  never had) were good. Ice cream is really good but the pistachio is really strong, so ask for a taste first ;)"}
{"text":"I love the flautas the most. They make me happy. Also, the salsa bar is on point. The end."}
{"text":"The concept and the food are fun.  Had a mix of tacos. All were delicious. Hard to pick a favorite, but rib eye was excellent.    The juices were unique and amazing."}
{"text":"I'm a huge nacho fan. So I order them all the time.  To say the least I was not let down. Lots of toppings and cheese and crisp chips. I will be back to try other items because I was so happy with the nachos. Plenty to feed 2 people all day long. 2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"Amazing low prices for fresh really good food.  This is a clean casual little place were you order at the counter and seat yourself.  As we were ordering the cashier hands us some cream of zucchini soup to try. It was a nice surprise and I have to say it was really good.  We ordered two plates of tacos the 1/2 Lb Ribeye (4 tacos $6.99) and the Pescado (3 tacos $7.49) Both plates came out nicely presented with a Grilled Mexican Onion, Blistered Chili, and Sauces. Everything was tasty and everything was fresh. They have a condiment bar and I really enjoyed adding the pickled onions to the Ribeye taco.  This place seems very solid."}
{"text":"This place is great! The tacos here are good and the lentil soup is delicious. I have yet to try any of their desserts but they all look amazing- including the frozen items. The place is always super clean and take out is fast if you just want to swoop something up and go home."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a quick bite at a great price. I tried the bacon wrapped hot dog and 4 al pastor tacos. The 4 tacos were about $9. Not bad for an eat-in restaurant. The service was great. Very friendly. They do serve beer, but I didn't have time to stay and have one."}
{"text":"Great value for your dollar!  Made to order. And super delicious.  We had ribeye tacos, burro, and tostada... Chips and salsa.  We are definitely becoming regulars.   Call ahead and save time :)"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food I've had in a long time!  Great atmosphere and customer service!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by after seeing all the great Yelp reviews. I had the ribeye tacos and chipotle chicken soup. The ribeye tacos were excellent! I felt that the portions were generous for the price. The chipotle soup was very tasty and light enough for me to eat all the tacos I ordered."}
{"text":"Clean authentic Mexican food! From the tacos to the burritos you can't go wrong.. The fresh Mexican juices are excellent. If I were to make a remark that would put Them at a 5 star rating I'd say they need to serve a bit more meat on their food.. Especially the tortas. Other then that it's A+ all around!"}
{"text":"Really good carnitas!  Pickled Onions and salsa are out of this world! The restaurant is really small but really nice decor and super clean."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. This is not like your typical \"bertos\" Mexican food. Everything I've had has been fresh and delicious. Their tacos are amazing and have lots of flavorful meat and toppings. The papa nachos are super cheesy and spicy and great. Their esquites (corn with mayo and cheese off the cob)Barr delicious. The burrotote is really good and has lots of meat. They have delicious green salsa and the zucchini soup is amazing too! I've never been unhappy here."}
{"text":"The ice cream is so smooooooth! The customer service here is so great. Come check them out. Marco is great."}
{"text":"Um..lets talk about my new addiction and how I crave this place on the daily! I usually hit up Camelback road for some grub, but my belly was telling me to try something new, and I'm glad I did! Paquime is legit and reasonably priced. I love the pescado street tacos and their fruit popsicles. They have everything you would want in Mexican food and it is authentic. If you are having a sweet tooth, they have a pretty unique bakery as well! I am glad I found this place (:"}
{"text":"I am confident that this place will garner a fifth star with subsequent visits.  My problem is that I can never make it past the bakery counter.  My sweet tooth always takes over and by the time it is satisfied I haven't the appetite to try the more savory options.  This place maintains its authenticity while creating an atmosphere that would rival anything put out by Fox or Upward Projects."}
{"text":"This place is da bomb and with it pretty much being right around the corner from me a much better alternative than Fillintheblankaberto's.   I'm not really much of a fan of Mexican food to begin with but this place is getting a decent amount of my business. As one reviewer alluded to in an earlier post the ribeye tacos are just crazy good. That same poster mentioned something about the cucumber drink so I sampled that to see for myself. Now I have visions of ribeye tacos and that cucumber drink dancing in my head. To me this place is fairly new. It took me over a month to force myself to stop ordering those damn ribeye tacos so I could sample some other stuff. I'm still testing but I tell you what. Between all the different food choices and desserts, I could probably eat here every single day for a good month and be cool with it.  Oh, yeah. The staff there is hella cool. I hope they continue to stay on their A game.   Big ups \"place around the corner that I can't pronounce the name of\" keep doin' the do!"}
{"text":"We went to Scottsdale over the 4th of July weekend and got a chance to eat at Paquime after a round of golf. The place is small but cosy and very clean. You order at the counter and they have several offerings including: sopes, tacos and tortas. I had the torta ahogada and my wife had the sopes; both tasted fantastic and the price point was great. We finished off with the tres leches cake which was equally great. I will definitely return,"}
{"text":"First stop in a quick search to find some food when I landed in Phoenix was here. Luckily we came here an hour before they closed so we got to eat their food. So right off the bat, saw that they had Pastor. Great. My go to. However, when I looked through their torta menu they didn't have a pastor torta. Luckily, when I got to the counter, the person who took my order hooked me up and got to add that as a torta. The torta itself was not big, however it was tasty and definitely packed a punch as far as the flavor profile. There was a nice kick to it as well which set apart from other pastor tortas I've had previously.  One thing that I have to say about this place was that the menu being displayed on a glass and then with a white background made it a little hard to read the prices and such. Everything seemed like it was a double unless you read it straight on. That was one problem that I found that maybe I just didn't agree with it.   This place is definitely a lunch spot or something really simple. I found that their salsa bar was really wide ranging and that there were a lot of options. I really like the simplicity of their modern design as well as their simplistic view. The staff was friendly and even though we came while they were cleaning up they happily filled our order and let us eat there as well. I definitely recommend to try this place if you're just looking for a low-key type of place and a quick meal."}
{"text":"I stopped in because I saw on yelp that they served elote, - usually a delicious ear of corn slathered in mayonnaise, rolled in cojita cheese and sprinkled with chili powder and lime juice. I was terribly disappointed when they brought to my table a paper cup filled with a cloudy liquid and a glob of mayo floating in it. When I questioned him, he said that they no longer serve the corn on the cob. Now they serve a small cup with a little bit of corn kernels at the bottom, and the rest of the cup filled with cloudy water, with a glob of mayo and a little bit of crumbled cojita cheese. It wasn't good.   The tacos however were great!  The ribeye tacos were simple but delicious. diced ribeye, cabbage and a slice of avocado on a small corn tortilla. The Volteado taco was especially wonderful. A  small corn tortilla topped with a little heap of a wonderfully flavored pork and a slice of cheese, then the whole thing is flipped over face down on the grill so the cheese gets crispy and toasty, then topped with an avocado slice.   The red hot sauce at the little salsa station was exceptional as well. it was really spicy and velvety smooth, It was even kind of creamy. Judging by the creaminess and richness of it, I'm pretty sure it has some heavy cream in it.  The rich salsa paired with the simple clean tacos made for an amazing meal.  After my meal I bought a churro from the pastry case. It wasn't good. It tasted old and was really tough and chewy.   Oh! And when I first walked it, the girl at the counter gave me a sample of the soup of the day. It was cream of zucchini, which sounds kind of weird, but it was great as well. it was creamy and rich with corn and bacon in it. I wasn't in the mood for soup but it was definitely delicious. Service was friendly too.  I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the weird corn water and old churro, but it was an overall good experience. I would highly recommend the Volteado tacos and Paquime in general."}
{"text":"The food here is so fresh and so delicious. I love their sauces and salsa bar. Their homemade fresh fruit Popsicles and ice cream are out of this world. Love their fresh light wheat tortas. All their soups are great! Ya gotta get here. You can bring your dog and sit on the patio even. What a gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice small place, with a modern feel. Great service.  Ordered Torta Paquimé ($5.49) and one Asada ($5.99) to go. Cashier was very nice and friendly. Explained to me all the details about Torta Paquimé, which turns out you can order hot or cold. While I waited for my order I listened to her describe some of the menu items to other customers and it was kind of cute : P  Place looks very neat and the cooks wear uniforms and look very professional.  Tortas were delicious. I liked the Paquime a little better. Tortas were cut in half and neatly kept in place with a pick. There come with chips and were in a cardboard box. Overall I am very impressed with this place and will be back soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I went out to get tacos for lunch. What we got were rib eye, fish and barbacoa tacos that were extraordinary. We were pleasantly surprised and can't wait to go back. Terrific!"}
{"text":"Finally! Hands down, the best mexican food I've had in a long long time.  We had the Ribeye tacos and some homemade flan.  Everything on the menu looked great."}
{"text":"I knew the other locations but never tried this one is tge same owner but it's a better place guys at counter greeted us with kindness even though they were closing in 15 minutes thanks for that we were so hungry we had the super nachos and they were fricking awesome thanks guys wr will be coming back for some tacos god bless your business"}
{"text":"after a pool party, we were starving and since i had heard so many great things about this place from co-workers...Paquime would have to be tried!  i think it's a local chain. the store manager told us they have 4 other locations in the valley. but they make everything you eat in house. the ice cream, the baked goods...everything! we were excited to try their fish tacos.   they have a few selections for non-meat eaters and will make most items with fish instead of meat. there are a couple of fish/meatless dishes as well. the menu is simple, but extensive. and everything looks/sounds delicious. our latest kick is no sugar and very little/no carbs....which is too bad because their baked goods and ice cream and palettas looked amazing.   i had the fish tostada. it was about 5 bucks but came loaded with avocado, fish, and queso fresca. i'm never sure how to eat a tostado, except with a fork and knife. in any case, it was delicious. with the added verde and rojo chile and a few jalapenos.....man oh man was i in \"street food\" heaven.  i tasted the wife's fish tacos, which i should've gotten. they came in 3's and although loaded...didn't simply crumble apart when handled. the taste was amazing and luckily we adhere to the \"20 minute and full\" mantra, because we could've ordered another 3!  a great \"mexican street food\" restaurant without going down to the west side or rocky point!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious but there are not a lot of choices for vegetarians. I had the bean and cheese burrito. It was tasty but TINY (it looked like a big flauta) and came with a couple waffle fries. For $6 that was a rip off. I also had the elote (they called it \"eskites?\") Which was pretty authentic but I wouldn't order it again, too much mayo. The decor *is* nice, and I guess that's what you pay for. The service was TERRIBLE. We walked up to the counter where one women was counting the drawer and the other woman watched and weren't even acknowledged by either of them as we stood and waited in front of them. After a while I greeted them and then the one watching politely told me they'd be with is in a minute. I get it if they are training or something but it happened again when we wanted to order desert. A new cashier just stood there pressing buttons on the register for almost 2 whole minutes. The service staff are in no hurry to help you. The old fashioned ice cream was heavenly and I would go back for desert (only)."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and had their ribeye tacos at the recommendation of a friend. Very tasty!  Will definitely return and try their other tacos soon"}
{"text":"Fast fresh and authentic!  Had a yen for elote (they call it esquites) and added a quick tasty lunch. The carrots and the avocado salsa were perfect. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Horchata and carne asada super nachos!   Ordinarily I have no problem passing up horchata, especially given that I prefer to get my calories from food over drink, but this horchata is too good to pass up!  And, the super nachos? The best nachos around!* Loads of chips with enough cheese to go around and a generous serving of your meat selection (I encourage carne asada) with a scoop of guacamole (pickled jalepenos upon request). It's such a big serving, it is easily enough to share.  *I prefer \"fake\" cheese over shredded cheese on my nachos. I believe cheese preference can make or break nacho satisfaction."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this week, and I have to say the food was awesome! I got the pork street tacos, hubby got flautas, and I think we finished eating in 3 minutes flat. It was SO GOOD. they have a bunch of Mexican pastries and ice cream, which I will be trying next time I go in."}
{"text":"I have been into this restaurant 2 times.  The food here is off the hook delicious.  Friendly clean upscale for a low street food price!"}
{"text":"Sooo good, the only thing they're doing wrong is not having more locations. The selection of food and desserts is amazing, I stop by at least once a month"}
{"text":"I had the burros, which is actually a mix of 2 carnitas and 2 shredded beef, and they came with a scoop of guacamole.  They have a fixins bar with various pickled items, salsas, and limes.  I recommend the pickled onions, and the green salsa is very good too.  A great value, being that we often spend more at taco bell which isn't even in the same realm as this place.  Everything was made to order and very fresh. Next time, I will definitely have to try the amazing desserts they offer which included homemade popsicles, ice cream, pastries, and cakes, they looked sooooo good!"}
{"text":"For anyone who wants to elevate themselves beyond Chipotle or Filabertos.    Came in around 3 pm. Clean , friendly staff, clean bathrooms and cool a/c.. what more could you want !   I ordered a burrito with a side of Chips / Guac.   Guac was fresh , site made, chunky and perfect. Burrito was great as well, meat taste freshly sliced and seasoned. The Tortilla was really fresh and good as well.   My son wanted ice cream and was in heaven.   Salsa bar was great with a variety of items.  Really enjoy this place and need to go more often."}
{"text":"Amazing with great prices. My wife and I have eaten here 5or 6 times. Today I tried their new shrimp tacos and my wife got the Barbacoa tacos again. If u don't come here to eat your taste buds may never forgive you."}
{"text":"The food here is great!  Good prices and selection.  Menu is authentic and has a lot of variety!  I will definitely be back again! We got the carnitas tacos and the carnita torta!"}
{"text":"Went with friends on lunch today.Awesome place to eat. Recommend others to definitely come here and have great meals."}
{"text":"Awesome food! We come here exclusively for these ribeye tacos! Well worth the twenty minute drive on our lunch hour."}
{"text":"We came here to binge on street tacos and they don't disappoint.  The place is a bit more upscale and trendy that your standard, authentic taco joint - don't expect to find buches or cabeza or any other yummy but nasty bits here, and in place of gritty carne asada meat you'll get \"ribeye\" tacos.  It's all really good though.  The pescado (fish) is generously portioned and high quality, the barbacoa was flavorful on its own and the ribeye was great with their slightly spicy red sauce."}
{"text":"I never give 5 star reviews but this place earned it.  I came here last Saturday with my two kids.  Service was good and they were helpful when my kids spilled their drink by accident.  I got the barbacoa tacos and they were delicious.  My kids got the bean buritto kids meal and both said it was the best bean burrito ever.  We also got the chips and salsa and the salsa that comes with the chips is fantastic.  The guac was also very tasty.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"What a great find!! First off, the decor is really cool and modern. The staff was incredibly friendly and enthusiastic about the menu. And the food is fantastic. I had the Barbacoa tacos (4 of them). The meat was tender, and they came with a huge scoop of really good guac, a house-made potato chip and a grilled onion and jalapeño. Nice touches. The cucumber lemonade alone is worth a return trip. All in all a great little spot and I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Please don't go down in quality paquime... Came here today and was disappointed. My favorite go to spot is becoming another spot becoming cheap and careless. I had the flautas and were so over cooked, I was scared to eat with the sharp pieces falling apart. They gave my husband half a chile...usually a full size one. Carnitas were dry...smh. What's going on??? I know places have their bad days...we'll return but please read this and win us back!! :)"}
{"text":"Really enjoy the food here it's super casual and fast,  love there chips and salsa and I'm super picky ! I tried there cream of zucchini soup it was really good , and there ribeye tacos have a lot of flavour I wish it was closer to me I would go at least twice a week;)"}
{"text":"This place is better than awesome. Why I hear you ask, let me tell you.  Amazingly friendly staff - a chef that puts time and effort into presentation as well as fresh ingredients and made fresh daily tortillas and chips, lovely interior and did I mention the ice cream and cakes.  Better than 5 star"}
{"text":"ALWAYS DELICIOUS! The Asada Súper Nachos are amazing, high quality ingredients and you can taste it! This place truly never disappoints."}
{"text":"Wow! Had to come try after the great reviews. Its all everyone had raved about. Hard to find a good and authentic Mexican restaurant that's both clean and delicious. This hits it out of the ball park  My wife had the flautas that were made to order, not from a freezer. I had the well reviewed rib-eye tacos, excellent!   We also had a couple cups of esquities, shaved corn in a coup with cheese and hot sauce. If you never have tried it, live a little - it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Staff is so nice and willing to answer questions. I had the tortilla soup, and it was delicious! The flautas weren't as great, hence the four stars, but overall a very great experience. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Hipster interior where they serve Mexican street food- interesting. I wanted to try this place after reading the great reviews, plus it is in our neighborhood. The interior is very clean, decorated nicely and good looking pastries showcased in a glass case right in the front. My husband and I each ordered the ribeye tacos. The verdict? Meh. The meat had no spice at all. Everything was generally flavorless. Had me thinking we should have ordered the barbacoa which I avoided because I didn't want too much spice. I'm married to a Mexican man and have eaten delicious Mexican food- I know what is good, what is bad, what is ok. This place is \"just alright\". We prefer good food over good décor. Nice, but will not be back. There is an amazing Mexican place just south of here 7th street. Worlds better. We will stick to that."}
{"text":"Burros and tacos are legit, especially the al Pastor! Fresh ingredients, cooked to order."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. Best mexican food i have had since i have been in the states. I was looking for a little piece of home and i have found it here."}
{"text":"Normally I would rate this place much higher but they forgot about my order. When my sister went up to the counter to ask about her order, they forgot hers too. I got tired of waiting over 20 minutes for soup so I asked for my money back. I hope this isn't a sign of things to come."}
{"text":"Great little place for lunch!  I've eaten there twice and love the selection, flavor, and speed.  In the summer, I plan on coming more often for the selection of Popsicles and ice creams.  Service is good.  I can definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food which is rare to find in Central Phoenix. The salsas are delicious as well as the tacos, tortas, tostadas and flautas. Reasonably priced and super clean!  The pozole is also on point."}
{"text":"EDIT:  We have returned since writing the first review and it was not good. I got the super nachos and boy, were they gross!  They used that cheap Velveeta processed cheese and what tasted like cheap pre-cooked defrosted chicken. It was awful and left me nauseous. I hope they fix this place... -------------------------------------------  Wow. I can't believe how great this place is! From the second we got in the door, the staff greeted us and made us feel so welcome! They could tell we were new and offered us samples of their sopa  de dia. It was simply put: AMAZING! And I'm not a soup person. Soup is for old people and I never order it. But this was so good I got some to go.   I recommend the fish tacos  and the ribeye  And my fiance said the veggie tacos were surprisingly flavorful.   For dessert they have a frozen mango with chili and lime that tastes better then you get in mexico. For real!  Can't believe this place isn't packed 24/7"}
{"text":"This place is a welcome addition to the area. Not the norm for Mexican food, and not to be missed! The menu ranges from tacos and burros to fresh fruit ice cream bars and juices. We've been here once already and ready to keep trying something new each time. Flavors will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I've been back a few times and the food is consistently excellent. The staff is friendly too. You will not be disappointed by this place!"}
{"text":"So good! 3 shrimp tacos and a beer for $10. Fresh pastries, ice cream, fruit bars, soup of the day- everything made on site."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly refreshing. I've eaten at many restaurants in the area and wasn't expecting the nice clean feel when I walked in. Everything is fresh made to order. I ordered a burrotote which is a carne asada burrito with beans, cheese, cabbage, & guacamole. I watched them make it after I ordered it. I also ordered a Mexican sweet bread which was pre made in a glass display. I didn't love it as much as the food. Overall though, it was a good to-go order experience."}
{"text":"The decor was nice, a few seating along the window wall. When I decided on the torta the young boy who took my order stood out. In a bad way. It felt like he didn't want to be there. And when he handed my receipt he flipped it at me. Was this a magic trick? Was he showing off? Whatever it was, it was rude. Than I was reaching for my debit card, he slid it across the counter. DA fuck?!? My hand was right there.   When the cook brought my food, he was nice and smiled at me. A neighbor was eyeing my food and when our eyes met, he gave me the nod of approval. LoL  At first, the pork torta was wayyyyyy to salty. Than I had a bite with bread and it brought the saltiness down. With cucumbers and carrots, it turned out pretty good. The cucumber aqua was VERY delicious.  Will I be back? The rudeness of the young boy says NO. The food? Maybe."}
{"text":"Great tacos with a flavorful sauce,  must have when visiting Phoenix. Prime rib medium is the way to go. The homemade ice cream or flan after your dinner was a nice touch. Could of had a little more meat on the tacos only complaint."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with some friends for dinner based on a recommendation they had received. For an \"order at the counter\" restaurant, I was very impressed!    Located at Central and Dunlap in a strip mall. Its a really nice space. Very clean with a pretty extensive menu for the type of place this is. One thing I always like to mention is a clean bathroom, spotless here!   I had an order of chips, salsa and guacamole for an appetizer and for my entree I had the rib eye street tacos. To drink I had a Mexican bottled Coca-Cola. They have a variety of bottled beverages as well as a soda fountain.  They also serve beer.   We all ordered and took a seat outside.   One of employees brought out the guacamole. It is served with a huge portion on fresh chips, a bowl of salsa and two large scoops of fresh guacamole. Salsa was excellent, the guacamole was pretty good, it just needed a pinch of salt.   There is also a self serve salsa bar with all the traditional fixing of a Mexican restaurant like this. Pickled carrots, jalapeños, onions, etc.   Next came my rib eye tacos. I was immediately impressed by the presentation. Four street tacos and served with a grilled onion, grilled jalapeño and some sauces. These tacos were bursting with flavor and didn't require anything added. Fresh,  tender rib eye cooked to order (medium) for me. I highly recommend trying these.  My friend who also ordered these was equally impressed.   Another friend ordered the fish tacos and he said there were outstanding. Fish tacos are served three to an order.   Be sure to give this place a try. I can't wait to return and try more of what they offer!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very tasty street tacos, maybe a little overpriced but we will be back for the Jicama \"tortilla\" alone which is awesome for weirdos who are trying not to eat carbs.  I enjoyed the pastor and the asada a lot more than the ribeye.   Very clean inside and the staff was very nice."}
{"text":"I always have the tortas and fresas con crema!!! My husband likes the steak tacos or burrito!"}
{"text":"By far the cleanest of Mexican restaurants around, they care about appearance. Food is good, too. They have soup du jour, all the ones I've tried taste good. They're better at tacos, but tortas are decent."}
{"text":"Tacos here are premium made that goes good with lime drink and the flan or ice cream is a good dessert to end the meal with! The place is very clean"}
{"text":"Good place, had a bad experience when they first opened and just came back because I was in the area. Very very impressed with how far they've come. recommend the pastor tacos the pineapple adds some awesome flavor."}
{"text":"It's like high class, fancy, \"street food\" . LOL If that makes any sense. The plating/ presentation is beautiful.  The food tastes good. A little more more than I wanted to spend but I would come back."}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday and split a Cubana Torta and an order of taquitos with my daughter. Both were delicious. While there, they handed out free samples of their ice cream bars-mango and strawberry. Mango was good, but the strawberry was amazing. Yet, the hot hats was our favorite menu item. Taking the teenagers and grandpa tonight."}
{"text":"Best tortas I've ever had. Clean and very welcoming. Chose Paquime over wing stop! Perfect for a date. The steak torta with with chipotle sauce is a great combination."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Super tasty and authentic Mexican with a twist.  Everything is delicious from the Mexican tacos to the flautas.  Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"If you want fresh... made to order tacos with high-quality ingredients, then look no further. My coworkers and I make it a point to visit a couple times a month. Be sure to drop in and give the place a try. Oh... and the strawberries with cream... amazing. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food! I wanted to try something new on my visit to my hometown and this isn't your typical fried Sonoran-style food.  I got three rib eye tacos that were topped with onions, white cheese, and chunks of avocado with a strawberry lemonade. The tacos were really good, fresh, and fairly priced and the lemonade was amazing. I wasn't sure what to do with the large grilled green onion that came as garnish. There were a lot of bakery and frozen items available for dessert but I was too full to try anything. I would definitely frequent this place (especially since it's right next door to a coffee roaster!) if I still lived in town. I'll be craving this place until I visit again!"}
{"text":"If this is street food, then I have been visiting the wrong streets when I am in Mexico.  The ample portions of food here are fresh and tasty.  There is something on the menu to please all appetites.  Small appetites have as many options as large, and almost everything can be prepared as a vegetarian dish.  In addition, those who do not eat gluten can substitute Jicama for the tortillas.  Yes, that's fresh, sweet, crunchy Jicama.    They serve salads, tortas, tacos, tostadas, and burros all day.  They have a breakfast menu of egg tortas and egg burritos too.  The front case is filled with pan dulce, churros, angel wings, crescent breads, galletas, pasteles and a version of an Italian cream filled horn.  The price on these little pastries can't be beat.  Most were 50¢ with the most expensive in the case at 99¢.  The fancier deserts were in a case next to the register.  They had tres leches cake, and 4 kinds of flan.  They also had large cups of fresh strawberries, and Mexican sodas.  Another case was filled with frozen fruit bars and mounds of ice cream."}
{"text":"UPDATE: We got 4 orders of volume to go, and they took 40 minutes. There is no reason street tacos should take that long!   Modern space and lots of varieties of tacos! Each order comes with 4 tacos so that's actually a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"This place is legit! Everything is fresh made and delicious. I got the veggie torta and a horchata. Amazing"}
{"text":"Oh, how I wanted to love this place . We always want to support the businesses in Slope.   On a positive note, the horchata was excellent - not too sweet. The also have a great looking menu with tortas, tacos and cool apps.   Unfortunately, the execution was horrible. We had to throw away both orders of elote (one of our favorite dishes). The corn was rubbery and SLATHERED in mayo. Also, no lime included. No lime with the elote? This was the very first time in my entire life I have had elote I didn't like. They need to send their cooks to Gallo Blanco to check out good elote.   After seeing their PapaNachos dish on Facebook, we also ordered that. The picture showed cheesy waffle fries with jalapeños. Yes please! Like the elote, they were extremely disappointing. No jalapeños - just cheez wiz on waffle fries. Boring, soggy and gross.   We didn't finish any of the 4 items we ordered and left extremely disappointed. I'm being nice giving it 2 stars. With so many good options around (Reyes, Gallo, etc), they are going to need to improve quickly to stick around.  Maybe their cooks need more training - not sure. I would skip this place for a bit until they get this figured out."}
{"text":"I really appreciated the help on the menu with pronunciation. The food was as good as I'd hoped, the professional appearance of the staff was a clue as to how well the meal was presented. And it was GREAT!"}
{"text":"All I can say about this place is wow. The ambience is super nice. It's a really clean restaurant with a nice modern vibe, a little atypical for good Mexican food, but it works.  I had the ribeye tacos and let me say that these are the best tacos I've had in Arizona. It was $9 for four. I like that you can get them cooked to order. They came out really quickly and were awesome with all the different salsas. The salsa bar here might also be the best around. I finished my meal with a paleta and it was the best paleta I've ever had- not too sweet, and just full of fruit. They make them there and you can tell.  I will definitely be back and I recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner here the other night and it was delicious! He had the ribeye tacos, and I had the sopes platter. We finished off with one of their super yummy tres leche cakes. The ingredients were all fresh, and everything was very tasty. The iced green tea was also very good.   The dining area is very nice, everything looks clean and modern, they had a mix of different sized tables for large and small parties. Staff was super friendly and helpful, and happy to make recommendations for items to try."}
{"text":"Jewel in the heart of Sunnyslope. Chic little restaurant for a quick bite. I had the barbacoa tacos (4) which came with fresh made guacamole, grilled scallion and a grilled pepper.  Everything was exceptionally prepared and had just the right amount of flavor and heat. I highly recommend this restaurant if you find yourself in Sunnyslope looking for a new exciting place to satisfy your love of Mexican fare."}
{"text":"The food is good, but I feel that it is over priced. The tortas are tiny and not too impressive. The price you pay for a torta is a lot, especially considering los reyes is up the street from them and have tortas thrice the size of theirs.   the burrito and other food looked fine, i didn't get to try anything else, but my torta and I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Paquime is actually a neat little concept, combining many traditional Mexican foods with items that are often not found in our mainstream Mexican restaurants here in Phoenix. And I'll openly admit, if I'm going to be buying some of this stuff, I feel much more comfortable obtaining it from a place that has to adhere to strict health codes as opposed to some shady looking dude on a trike near my place of employment.  Personally, I don't care what people say about \"authentic\" food. It doesn't always have to be consumed in a dirty restaurant with a non-working AC and clogged toilets. Paquime actually looks clean and modern, so I definitely don't have any complaints there.  Actually, my girlfriend and I dined here a year ago and had completely forgotten about it. I think we went in expecting something incredible, only to be a bit letdown by her soggy sopes. Nevertheless, I suggested that we give them another try after they keep popping up in my Yelp searches.  I ordered four tacos that they allowed me to mix up. Al pastor, barbacoa, carnitas, and bistec, which I guess is kinda/sorta like carne asada. Overall, the tacos were fine, but a bit of a mixed bag in terms of execution. My favorite was the barbacoa, which had surprisingly good flavor. The carnitas and bisect were both offensively cold for some reason, which is probably why I never found our first experience memorable.  My girlfriend ordered a Mexican hot dog, which I actually thought was pretty decent given that it was my first one. She claimed it was good, but obviously not the best she's ever had (which was probably obtained from one of the shady dudes I previously mentioned). We also ordered some esquite, which was okay, but a bit too watery and soupy for my tastes. It appeared that they were skimping on the actual corn itself, which is a big no-no.  Overall, I think Paquime is a place worth trying. They seem to be trying to cover a lot of different ground with their menu offerings. Probably a bit too much. But hey, they're getting great reviews, so they're obviously doing something right.   Recommended to try out."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly and nice atmosphere.  The most important however, the food is fresh, healthy and well presented.  Definitely  a place to come back."}
{"text":"Their ribeye tacos are delicious. Their presentation of the meal as well as the culinary accoutrements accompanying the dish are well made and well flavored.   Their flan was not too sugary and therefore hit the spot. However, I prefer mine more eggy.  Anyway, they sell all sorts of Mexican gastronomic googahs like pastries, ice cream, and Popsicles.  Over all, it's a piece of swank at inexpensive prices on Dunlap. This business, singlehandedly, will jump start the gentrification of this seedy area."}
{"text":"So its a nice lil spot but i think the prices are sort of high. 4 lil street tacos is like $8bucks wtf! Um noo, ill find a taco truck for cheaper. Service is good, and its a very clean layout. Probably wont be coming bak, portions is too little for the price"}
{"text":"Great local and authentic Mexican food. Lots of great menu items that are new to us Gringos, like Tortas, Sopes, and Helados.  Great selection of fresh Mexican bakery items, too!"}
{"text":"Whoa.  This place is seriously delish.  My family hiked north mountain and we were very hungry afterwards.  A quick search took us to Paquime to try it out.  The place was busy.  Service was pretty slow but everything is made to order and worth the wait.   We sat on the patio but there is plenty of seating inside.  The chips/salsa/guac were excellent.  We tried burritos and a couple different street tacos.  Salsa bar is great!  The food is awesome and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tacos volteados my best favorites tacos, must come an try out and you will be hook. Best place to eat"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and cheap. My boyfriend and I shared the carnitas tacos. He got the Cubana torta and I got the Paquime Tostado. They were all tastes good. I have to say the Cubana torta was probably the best though. Staff were also very nice and friendly. Definitely have to come again. Btw, they also have desserts such as cakes, Popsicles, and ice cream."}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of a coworker. We walked in and we were immediately greeted by a young lady who offered us a sample of the soup of the day. (How did she know that I LOVE soup!). The Lentil soup was delicious! I ordered a cup of that with the ribeye tacos. The order was delivered quickly. After devouring the soup I could hardly wait to tear in to the tacos. They did not disappoint! The ribeye was melt in your mouth tender. You guys have got to check this place out!"}
{"text":"I tried the cream of zucchini & I must say: it's a new fave. I wonder if there is a location closer to Chandler nevertheless I will be back here. By the way, they have flan!!!!"}
{"text":"We are so thrilled to have such a clean modern spot for delicious Mexican food in sunneyslope! Everything was so fresh and plated very nicely. Friendly clean staff. We will be back many times. So much to try at a good price!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst super nachos I have ever had! Cold, pour on canned cheese,  no salsa or Pico, all toppings plopped deep in the center leaving soggy chips in the middle and naked chips everywhere else. I felt sick after eating them about half way, I will not go back, nor would I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good food.  My husband and I got a Cubano sandwich and 4 tacos to share. We got the Carnitas, Pastor, Barbacoa & Ribeye Tacos; all were significantly better than what you would find standard in Phoenix but my favorite were the Barbacoa and Ribeye Tacos.  The Cubano came served with platanos (which were AMAZING) and was super good. My husband and I love spicy so it may be too much for anti-spicy people, but it had a fabulous marriage of flavors. The sandwich was both complex and familiar. Don't forget to use a little of the sauce the sandwich comes with!  We both cleaned our plates and did not use any of the salsa from the salsa bar (the food didn't need it!)  One of our favorites in Phoenix. We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"We get breakfast burritos here almost every weekend, love the chips and the Pozole is very good.  My favorite pastry is the molasses Pig, if you do not see it in the case, they will usually have some in the back that are fresh, and who doesn't like  a pig without all the fat and calories anyway!"}
{"text":"Good place to have \"authentic\" Mexican food. Love the fact that they have the pan dulce right when you walk in. They also had good Spanish music playing rather than some cheezy Spanish music you would normally hear at restaurants."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Staff is friendly and helpful.  The place itself is cool looking and they keep it clean.  I had the pork tacos (3 to an order) and they were delicious!  Interesting spin on Mexican food--tastes fresh and is not overly filling.  Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town or in the local area. The ribeye taco rule. Great prices and friendly service. They cook to order so takes a bit longer but worth it."}
{"text":"Paquime Street Food is in the Paquime family from Tortas Paquime. They're all great and make their bread fresh. This cute place is great whether you're craving Tortas or tacos.  I had the beef milanesa on wheat bread.  The sandwiches is packed with tomato, lettuce, and avocado. I love to enjoy it with a sandia agua Fresca (watermelon). I also like their pastor tacos"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great customer service!! Ribeye tacos, barbacoa tacos and mexicana torta, all made fresh and delicious! Clean restaurant and friendly staff. Tastes like food we had in Mexico from street vendors!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing, local and fresh! Ordered the carnitas and pastor tacos. So much flavor  and the salsa bar is a bonus. Will definitely be back to try some other favorite dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"I eat A LOT of tacos. This is my new favorite spot. Great menu. Great service. Great salsa bar. Just not a lot of tables so might need to get it Togo."}
{"text":"Holy shiiii-take mushrooms this place was good.   I had the RIBEYE TACOS. Generous portion of steak topped with cabbage and avocado. It comes with a side of liquid quacamole (probably more traditional), chipotle (think smoky flavor) salsa, a roasted poblano pepper, and a roasted shallot.    There is a salsa/pickled vegetable bar where you can grab different toppings for your food. I especially loved the pickled carrots and onions. The cucumbers were not pickled, but they were well marinated with oregano and vinegar.    We also started with some CHIPS AND GUAC/SALSA.Guac was filled with delicious ingredients (very chunky, like Chipotle's, but better).  I wasn't a huge fan of the salsa but it was certainly flavorful.    We took a generous portion of chocolate strawberry tres leches cake home. I'll dive into that after I run a few miles. :)  My only complaint?  I asked for my meat mediumand it came well done.  Can I please just have this every day for the rest of my life?"}
{"text":"Everything that I saw come out of the kitchen looked delicious. In previous experiences, tortas had always consisted of way too much bread for the amount of meat, sauce, etc. The torta was a very light bread, nothing too dense or heavy and didn't overwhelm the rest of the meal.  The contents of the torta were flavorful and filling.  Definitely a place to stop in and try something new and different."}
{"text":"I love this place. Whenever I want authentic food, quick and convenient I stop by after work. It's always clean in there and the staff is helpful. I usually get the ribeye tacos (highly recommend), because they are my favorite.  Today I tried the flautas, which were good but I much more would rather have the tacos. I enjoy it every time I go. I would recommend anyone to stop in."}
{"text":"Very clean, bright, and inviting little spot. Ordered the rib eye tacos, delicious. Ordered the kids cheese quesadilla for my 2 year old and he gobbled it up. I snuck in a bite and the cheese was extra tasty, and not bland. Got 2 paletas for dessert and they were fantastic."}
{"text":"Paquime is the epicenter of the Sunnyslope Sunday Breakfast dilemma. Next door is the coffeehouse that has better coffee and the Blueberry Spiral Rolls of Delight. But Paquime has three weapons to suck a really hungry person in:  1. Breakfast tortas! The chorizo breakfast torta is pretty much the best breakfast idea in the universe, beating out now-familiar breakfast burritos. It has chorizo and maybe beans and definitely peppers, and it will make smoke come out your ears.  2. Full menu served at breakfast time. So if you need fish tacos at 9 a.m., you can have fish tacos at 9 a.m. (There is also menudo on Sundays.)  3. Best Mexican pastries I've ever had. I'd gotten a little jaded on the Mexican-pastry front, but these are fresh! And huge!   Now, the reason you want to go here, rather than to the much divier -bertos across the parking lot is that both the food and the environment are rather more chi-chi (while still being quite affordable). All things -berto's are for when you want a honkin' big burrito on a foam plate, with a plastic fork, before you go to Lowe's (or after a long night at the bars). Such moments exist, and they are real.  Paquime is for when you want a quietly civilized meal, with quality ingredients, on real plates, but the prospect of hauling yourself to Gallo Blanco is too onerous, expensive, and precious to contemplate. They also do take-out, should you prefer your civility at home but not want to fire up the skillet."}
{"text":"I have a serious weakness for salsa bars, the bigger and more options the better. Paquime did not disappoint! I tried 4 different salsas with the verde (as usual) being my favorite. The guacamole was fresh and delicious and the nachos were HUGE and used that real nacho cheese, like the kind you get in the movies.. Yum.  I also had the tostada and added the carne asada which was so delightful I could have eaten pounds of it. The service was fast and the super clean and new on the inside. If you find yourself in Sunnyslope stop in and have a taco! You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Clean place, service was alright.  They did customize my breakfast burrito for me, which is a big plus.   Had the rib eye instead of bacon or chorizo.   Ribeye was bland and dry....   if was marinated and fresh, they would have got 5-stars.    Salsa bar was awesome, all four salsas were good.   Their fries are amazing.  Cheese on the burrito was great too... almost seemed like baseball game nacho cheese.     Worth trying this place for sure."}
{"text":"My Husband and I stopped for a quick lunch. Ordered the Super Nachos. It was so yummy! Enough for two.    The place has a modern Mexican flare! Not your local grungy taco joint. This is definitely a step up but has very reasonable prices.  We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Eloté was amazing (however did take a while to come out) The Mexican Hotdog was super yummy. Also, I love their strawberries con crema omg so good! Love that this restaurant is so close to home and it's absolutely a must try."}
{"text":"Amazing Authentic food! I had the barbacoa street tacos and could have easily ordered seconds due to how delicious they were. The restaurant we very clean and I love that I could see our food being made. The employees were very friendly. We had an over all great experience."}
{"text":"I been eyeing this place since they open. I finally try it out and was not what I expected. The cashier seem confuses when I ask about what kind of bread they used for their hot dogs. She end up giving me the wrong information which I realize when we got the food. On top of having to wait about 25min the kids meal burrito I also order was cold to the point the chess they used in it was falling out of it. I did send it back and they gave me another one the second time around the burrito was so hot it burn my hand to even touch it. I was not about to give It to my child and have her burn her mouth so I end up take it home. Overll all I honestly didn't like this place at all. Beyond  disappointed not just me tho I over heard another customer complained about  waiting way to long for a little container of soup."}
{"text":"Cute trendy taco spot hidden in a corner of a shopping strip.. Def worth stopping in!!  Had the fish tacos, crispy flaky.. Delicious .. Served up like art..   The salsa bar has the cucumber, lime and salsa verde to round out the taco plate..  Must try the cucumber agua Fresca.. Refreshing and not to sweet!! Very good!  Give this place a chance u will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I dont know what all the hype is about this place, I was not impressed.  I had the ribeye tacos as everyone seemed to rant and rave about. I cant do the same. The tacos were small and funny to say i had more avocado then meat? Most of the meat had so much fat i could have made 2 more tacos with it. I left hungry and ended up eating at another place. $15 and im still hungry? I dont think so.  The meat was not seasoned and had no taste to it. I mean the avocado sauce had more taste than my meat did. Thank god for limes and sauce otherwise i wouldnt have tasted anything. Im so disappointed because the pictures looked great, reviews were great but this was just simply a let down. I have my fair share of taco places that are cheaper and can totally kill this place, but who am i right?   I will never be back. They offered me a free scoop of ice cream if i showed them my review. I dont think they would wanna offer me free ice cream after seeing my review in a sea of good ones.. lol  But i have to be honest. This was a waste of money, i REALLY expected more.. Im extremely sad because it looks so good and its so close to my house.   Oh and be warned most of the pictures on yelp of the food, they do not have anymore. I didnt see a lot of the food shown on yelp on the menu and i kept asking the lady and showing her if they had it. Unfortunately almost every item she said they dont serve anymore."}
{"text":"WOW!  This place is fantastic.  Its not at all what I expected-it far exceeded my expectations!  Tucked away in a strip center the restaurant is modern, clean and the staff exceptionally nice and helpful.  We went for breakfast on a Sunday but I think they were serving the entire menu as well.  The food may be Street food of Mexico but it is some of the best mexican food I have ever had.  The plating is exceptional and the food looks as good as it tastes.  The menu has items for everyone - meat eaters, vegetarians, vegans.  I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"The day is beautiful not to hot nor cold the sun is beaming down like a smooth heat lamp to ease the day into night . So I decided to finally try this place since I literally live right around the corner from it (pacquime) I remember when I first saw it being built about a year or so ago by the looks I thought it'd be nice to one day go check it out well finally I've tried it and was disappointed explain yu ask . Well the register girl was rude as if asking for a sample of the juices was like pulling a tooth . And the food was salty as if adding salt is trying to hide a horrible taste or something this includes the salsa the avocado was the kind you'd get from the super market isle that was know good . Any how I I'd go to this place on your own risk . Don't say I didn't warn yu specially if yu have high blood pressure . Yu need to be healthy to eat at this place with all the salt thy put in there food."}
{"text":"My partner and I have never been here, so with my aversion to breakfast food we tried it out this morning. D E L I C I O U S. We came in and told the lady behind the counter this was our first time, she promptly told us about the menu, the best sellers, and then handed us a sample of the soup they had for the day. The soup was so on point. We ordered Chips after our initial order was placed and were pleasantly surprised that it came with fresh guacamole and a salsa that wasn't available at the condiment bar. Everything was so yummy! We will be back! Thank the gods this place is 3 minutes from home! (The breakfast burrito was chorizo, beans, eggs, and cheese - so good! Would recommend. ) I got the flautas and they were covered in creme, cheese, and avocado! To die for! Try this place out, no regrets shall be had-especially if you have a horchata!"}
{"text":"We came here on the hunt for Mexican street corn in phoenix and found not only that, but we found a place with delicious and truly authentic Mexican snacks and food. Absolutely amazing! Great service as well."}
{"text":"Burrotote was delicious  Ribeye tacos were amazing  Volteados tacos were one of the best things I've ever eaten"}
{"text":"Wooo i can say they have the best flautas ever! And really good customer service!"}
{"text":"Had to give this place a go after seeing it today while out and then reading the posts. Dragged my husband down to Sunnyslope to check it out and was really glad we did. This is a fast casual restaurant with rather limited seating, BUT the food was really fresh and delicious.  We were given a sample of the lentil soup (different soup each day) to try and that was the kickstart of what was to come. The soup was homey and savory with the lentil cooked to the point that there was still some toothsomeness but were creamy. I would go back for the soup alone.  We also ordered the esquites, fish tacos, and rib eye tacos. Everything was freshly prepared and brought to us. I was confused by the term that the corn is shaved, but it really just meant it was not on the cob. The esquites could do with less liquid in the bottom of the cup, but the cotija was briny/salty good and the hot sauce provided a nice contrast. The portion could easily feed two.  As for the tacos, I might have been very content with the rib eye tacos had I not sampled the fish tacos. Those fish tacos were fabulous- crunchy, flaky with a great chipotle crema. Loved that. The rib eye tacos had generous portions of steak, were topped with creamy avocado slices and came with a chipotle sauce and avocado sauce. After tasting the sauce that came with the fish tacos, I was dunking there. That sauce had a little heat and some tang that was excellent.  Unfortunately, we did not have room for dessert so I cannot comment on that. I will say that the service was good, the place is clean, and the food we had was freshly prepared and flavorful. The menu is more extensive than you might think and we will definitely be back.  **Please note, this place really is not like Chipotle. It is MUCH better than Chipotle. I hope they branch out further north but in the meantime, I will make the drive."}
{"text":"The Mexican hot dog always hits the spot. I just wish we would have came earlier in the day in order to try the soup of the day, but they ran out. I've tried two other soups and they were fantastic. \"mental note, get here early\"."}
{"text":"Amazing the first time two days ago.  I'd given it a 5.  We loved the freshness, friendliness, and generosity.    But today,  it's just alright.  We were not welcomed with joy.  The sweets and ice cream are obviously the same from the other day.  The aqua fresca is too sweet and not authentic.  Still like the barbacoa:)"}
{"text":"This place is fab!  Can't wait to come back.  The fish taco was my favorite of the three I had, but the other two (pollo and pastor) were a close second.  The presentation was beautiful.  The clincher was the popsicle I had for dessert (mango!)!"}
{"text":"This was flat out amazing!  Hadn't heard of them before, but while hiking North Mountain I yelped tacos while at the top. This came up as close by and open.   We went as a group of four. We tried the tacos(rib eye), burro(carne asade), torta and a burrito. Chips and salsa were ordered as well as a side of their corn.  Chips were among the best I've ever had in my life. Light, crispy and just salty enough. Salsas were really tasty and had varying degrees of heat to choose from.  I had the four tacos and they were ridiculously good. I was stuffed full but considered more just for the terrific flavor of them.   They had menudo and I was given a sample. It too was  superb. I grilled the guy at the counter and found everything, including the baked goods, were done in house. Picked up some treats for the kids and while they look great, I'm guessing they'll taste even better."}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times for lunch and each time it was fabulous! The place is kept clean, the presentation of the food is beautiful, and the decor is modern. The prices are reasonable and I am in LOVE with the ribeye tacos.   Customers should be aware that this is a small place so it can be difficult to find a place to sit if you have a large group or if you go when it is busy. This is not a deterrent for me! I will be back again!"}
{"text":"We have Paquime Pay Day at work. I love the fish tacos. I can't get enough. The food and service is amazing."}
{"text":"Yep love their tacos! This is our go to for street tacos. Pescado, ribeye and carnitas are definitely favorites. Don't miss the soups ... wow yum! This place is a great deal and the food is so fresh. We like the fact it is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Oooooohhhhh, so good. We came in the morning around 8:45 AM in order to ribeye burrito with avocado instead of guacamole and the ribeye medium and man it was good delicious yummy and yummy again. We had a cucumber water and orange water, both good. We got papa-nachos and a bean burrito kids meal and it was just way too much food for all of us and we even halved the burrito. I would come back here again, and again!"}
{"text":"Really clean more modern looking place which is always a plus. They have pan dulce, flans, ice creams by the scoop as well as paletas and mangoneadas in addition to their regular menu items which consist of taco plates, burritos, tortas, soups of the day, nachos to name a few. I ordered the short rib tacos, pazole, cucumber agua fresca and a guava paleta. What I liked was that I can chose how well done I wanted the short ribs to be cooked! Medium please! Thanks! Everything was absolutely delicious! There's a tiny salsa bar. I really like the pickled onions from the bar and the fried yellow chile that came with our taco plate! I didn't even get a chance to take pictures cause I wanted to devour it fast! I really liked that there was a patio too with an umbrella for shade. Gonna go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Loved the Mexican hotdog, ribeye taco, breaded fish tacos, bean and cheese burrito and their salsa.   The ribeye taco is tender beef that is seasoned very well and comes in a flour tortilla.   The fish taco is also amazing and comes in a corn tortilla. It's breaded and also very tender.   The Mexican hotdog is wrapped in bacon and topped with mushrooms, pinto beans, tomato and guacamole sauce. The bread is butter toasted, sweet and soft. The different ingredients in the hotdog mesh very well.   The order taker/cashier was very friendly, kitchen staff is accommodating and all keep their restaurant very clean. I will definitely make a trip back here!"}
{"text":"Looking around Yelp for something special in the area while traveling and my family and I enjoyed the photos and reviews for this spot, so we stopped in for dinner. Not sure why, but we had an awful experiance. Was extremely disappointed with the staff, quality of the food and experience overall.  Family of six and no one enjoyed their meal and said we should have gone to Del Taco after eating here.   I ordered the ribeye tacos and they looked good, but the meat tasted awful, was super thin and cut up into very small chunks with a bad taste to it and even the tortilla tasted bad.  The fresh avocado was a nice touch, but this dish was a total fail!  My wife went with a mix of tacos. She said the barbacoa was very oily and could have used salt, chicken was very peppery and tasted like it came out of a bag and like be hated the ribeye.  The kids meals that come with a drink and side which is cool. We got quesadillas and unfortunately they were not good. The kids did not eat them and said they tasted bad. Sampling them to see what was up, my wife and I both agreed they were super super salty. $7 x 2 fail on the kids meals.  My son got $10 nachos with no sour cream.  Then when it came it had no beans and sour cream and when I told them that this was not what context (very politely) they argued with me and said I never said no sour cream and I said no beans. My son and I both were pretty clear at the register no sour and perhaps they heard no beans. The nachos were awful! The cheese wiz with peppery chicken that tasted like it was pulled out of a bag. The chips were very greasy and really did not work for nachos. This was an epic fail and I am very surprised this place has such good reviews considering everything we had was bad."}
{"text":"D.F. food is not common in Phoenix. Pacquime has fresh, high quality ingredients, done in the Mexico City style of Mexican food. My coworkers and friends are regulars. A must try"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food at a reasonable price. The restaurant was super clean. The salsa and guac was super fresh. Fish tacos and pork tacos were excellent. I will be back for more. The only problem was that I didn't leave room for dessert."}
{"text":"Higher quality than the other restaurants in the Paquime chain. Amazing flautas, tortas, pozole and tacos. It's 'cuisine', in an atmosphere that's humble but not chain-y."}
{"text":"Absolutely love love this place. Go here maybe once or twice a week. They have this cucumber drink, must try.  It has lime, cucumber and pineapple in it. Delicious!  Very yummy tortas and soup as well.  Not been disappointed. ..."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for the first time. We ordered a ribeye burritotote and the two small burrito plate ( I got green beef chili on both because I don't care for pork.) My husband wanted to try the Mexican hot dog, it was okay but didn't compare to our favorite spot. We decided to share our meals so we got half and half. Now I know  how delicious and tender the ribeye is. We had chips with salsa and the best  guacamole I have ever tasted. The chips were really good, I'm pretty sure they're homemade. The chips also came with a basic tomatillo salsa it was okay.  My favorite was the guacamole it was so good my husband who really doesn't like it ate some. And for dessert we tried the ice cream, a scoop of chocolate and a scoop of pistachio.  The ice cream was really good reminded me of gelato. I would recommend coming here try out the ribeye in either taco or burrito form, chips with guacamole and salsa you won't regret that. They also carry beer for $3 a bottle or a michelada which was okay needed a little bit more chili but was good with our meal."}
{"text":"I loved the ambiance of the place, as soon as I stepped in. The restaurant is neatly tucked into the corner of a plaza, and has a clean, modern aesthetic with lots of yummy desserts on display, including homemade popsicles. At first glace at the taco menu, I gawked at the $7+ prices. \"These tacos better be enormous or made of dinosaur meat,\" I thought to myself. The host clarified that the prices were for an order, which includes 4 tacos. I ordered two orders, carnitas and barbacoa.  Unfortunately, the service was extremely slow. I ended up waiting half an hour for my to-go order, with myself and the two ladies in front of me constantly checking up on our order since the wait was so long, and it was not just mine. Finally, the host gave me my order, which turned out to be cold! I was so disappointed and sad. For that I need to remove one star. I really don't want to, but all that wait for cold tacos! Of course we ate them anyway, and they were OK. It would've been better fresh though!"}
{"text":"The Ensalada Paquime was soooooo delicioso!!!!!! It was filling and will make you want to come back for more!!!"}
{"text":"I always passed by Paquime when I was working in this area. I finally stopped one afternoon for lunch.  That display of Mexican pastries caught my eyes before even hitting the counter to order my food. I had the Pastor tacos. It was filling and flavorful. You can watch them grill in the open kitchen. It took them a bit to prepare the tacos. If you are in a real rush, skip here. I'm not sure if they still offer to Yelper but if you write a review you get either 1-scoop ice cream or 1 free medium drink."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place on my way home for a while and finally I was hungry enough to go in. At the end I was full, but not too happy. The chicken and carnitas tacos I ordered were somewhat dry and not too fresh. The decor and food presentation is casual yet elegant and it does feel like a Mexico city joint, but the food didn't stand out. So next time I'm driving by and I get hungry again, I might give them another try. But I wouldn't go out of my way to do that."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! Once you try the ribeye tacos, though, it may be hard to try anything else. Every dish I've had has been delicious, even the daily soups. The ice cream is served in very generous portions and the pastries are a treat as well. I get full off the tacos but if you have a large appetite (like my boyfriend), you may want to order something with it."}
{"text":"I love coming here. If I want good fast quality Mexican food, then this is the place. My friend recommended this place to me after telling him that I miss eating tortas from back home. I was sold with my first torta on my first visit.  I come here so often that one of the girls knows me by name now.   I haven't tried the whole menu yet, but I do love the Paquime torta, carné asada torta, and ribeye torta. The cucumber drink is delicious too. I will also buy their deserts; pan dulce, tres leches, choco flan."}
{"text":"1st time here, came with my Hiking Club after a hike. Had the fish tacos with no bean paste on tortilla have to say one of the best places for fish tacos.  Cute little restaurant. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"3.5 the restaurant is very clean with good service but this place lacks a full menu.i understand theyre a different style than filbertos but they need to appeal to the masses.which is what keeps this place from becoming popular"}
{"text":"Kinda sad at the food one of my kids received. She order potatoes with cheese. I sat and watched the cook scrap the bottom of the pan with a small plastic spoon and put the lumpy cheese on her potatoes. I asked them to put more cheese on it and they scraped the bottom a couple more times.   As we were waiting they could have made more cheese and if they didn't want to the least they could have done was tell us there isn't enough. Especially when you take the lid of the pump off and scrap the very bottom in front of the customer.   On a good note...the cucumber drink and the corn is good!"}
{"text":"FINALLY! Authentic semi-fast food mexi! So yummy! They even have pastries and ice cream!   Salsas are excellent too!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food! It's been difficult to find good food that satisfies my cravings but I finally found my spot. This place is beautiful, clean and delicious."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!! Everything I've tasted is amazing!!  Been to their sister one on van Buren so glad they're close!!"}
{"text":"My wife loves it here, but it wasn't \"that delicious\" in my opinion. The staff is welcoming and kind, the prices are OK, but let's just say I've had way better not too far and for better prices."}
{"text":"I accidentally walked into this place while heading to the coffee shop next door. I got a sample of some bodacious corn chowder and bought a chorizo breakfast burrito. Accidents can be good."}
{"text":"We tried this little place on Sunday and it was off the hook...fabulous. Ribeye street tacos and a carne asada torta. They brought around samples of their lentil soup while we were waiting for our food and little samples of their fresh fruit popsicles at the end of our meal. Both of them were delicious.  Great addition to this part of the neighborhood at Central and Dunlap. We will be back to this place often to try other menu items and also their sweet corn."}
{"text":"Taco craving satisfied at this bright clean spot in Sunnyslope. My hubby and I had the Rib Eye and Carnitas Tacos. Plenty for a light lunch. We were drooling over the pastries but needed to staunch the sugar cravings today. We will be back for a torts and some creamy pastry on our next stop. All of the accompaniments were tasty and plentiful. Great zippy salsa!"}
{"text":"This food is delicious. Fresh tasting and full of flavor. Check it out. Yum! I highly recommend the ribeye tacos. The guacamole that comes with it is divine. I love the little roasted onion and pepper side too."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a little over a year now. I always get treated with the best customer service. I keep coming back because of the service and nice people that work there, not to mention their amazing food. All the waitresses are very polite, respectful, and courteous. Marcelo, knows me very well there. I have the utmost respect for him. He is truly a hard worker, and is very good at his job. I would hire him for any position at any company. I can already see his potential. Eating there feels like you are eating your mom's home cooked Mexican meals. It gives you a sense of reminiscence. I recommend this restaurant to everybody and anybody!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  My wife and myself drove past the restaurant for several months, until my wife decided to stop in to buy some Mexican bread.  The Mexican Bread was fresh, tasted very good, and was cheaply priced.    A few days later, we decided to stop by for dinner.  My wife ordered the Vegetable Tacos made with a gluten-free shell from Jicama.  I ordered the Pescado (Fish) Tacos.  I must say, the food was AWESOME!  It was seasoned very well and the presentation was great.  My wife also tasted the Agua Fresca (Hibiscus) drink and loved it.    I ordered a slice of Cheesecake.  It was very different from the normal, American Cheesecake and is now my favorite!  We will definitely be back for more great food."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick bite with friends before class..... omg, place is amazing. Horchata was so good!!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I go in to get food, the staff is very friendly. It's clean. They have great pastries and dessert. My favorite is the breakfast burrito. They also make their own potato chips. They also make their own soup and have a different one each day."}
{"text":"Everything here is fresh and delicious! You have to try the Agua de Pepino (cucumber drink) and the tacos. Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"At the hospital, searched for a place to grab a quick bite to eat.  Wow!  What a gem!  Clean, keenly decorated, attentive service, fairly priced, delicious tacos, and a much-needed beer.  They have a great menu with loads of variety.   I highly recommend this place for a casual nosh."}
{"text":"The food tasted amazing!   The interior of the place is very modern, clean, and hip! They have a nice donut/pastry display right when you walk in. Good strategy from the owner since that makes people like us who come in, think about maybe saving some room for some sweets after! They serve tacos, sopes, elotes, to flan, aguas frescas(which includes: horchata, cucumber, and Melon flavor) and ice cream just to name a few! A place where you can get everything just in one place if you don't wanna drive out to get dessert.  What me and my sisters ordered: -Flan Napolitano -Ribeye tacos(medium rare) -Barbacoa tacos -Carnitas Tacos -Horchata -Cucumber drink  Right when we ordered, I've been eye balling their flan and I asked the guy at the register if it was good and he said that it was his fave, so I had to get it and try!   All the tacos that we ordered were very tasty and yummy! Even the presentation was beautifully done! Each taco plate comes with 4 tacos, a whole grilled green onion, and a cooked yellow jalapeño pepper served with green and red hot sauce on the side. For me, I am a very detailed oriented person, so I take into consideration of little things like that! Even my sisters were telling me to make sure to eat the grilled green onion as well since it was tasty(make sure to dip it into hot sauce for some extra flavor)!  There is also a side bar of condiments(carrots/cucumber/red onions/lemon etc.) which is unlimited to cater to your taco needs! =)  The drinks tasted very authentic! I especially love the cucumber drink! Not too sweet, but juuuusssssttt rigghhht. Oh yeaaaa, just how I like it!  Even entering upon the women's restroom, it was very clean! I know this might sound weird, but I like the picture that is hung inside the lady's room! =X It's an elder lady in the picture selling elotes which is my all time favorite Hispanic treats!!!! Mm mm mm good!  At the end, I saved the flan for last, and MY GOD!!!! The first bite, I literally just died and was reincarnated! I swear that first bite was love at first taste! My sisters looked at me weird when they heard my crazy commotion and wanted to try as well and they agreed with me but not too wildly crazy as I was, but they did the, \"mmmm omg this IS REALLY GOOD!\"  Overall, me and my sister/friend wanted to come back here before we go back home to CA but didn't get a chance to since it would've been out of the way, but when I do come back to AZ to visit my sister, I will for sure come back here to try more! =)"}
{"text":"I love this place! The ribeye tacos are amazing! I can't seem to order anything else yet because I like them so much! I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It took my husband and I awhile to find a good taco place and Paquime is it! We felt like a fat kid in a candy store unsure of where to begin with their menu. My husband was a little intimidated because it is all in Spanish but they are super helpful to describe what each item on the menu is. We highly recommend the volteado taco. So much yummy flavor! Their salsa bar is always neat and clean, we love the salsa aguamole and salsa roja. Make sure to save room for dessert there is so much to choose from. We will have to keep coming back to try more of their menu because we have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ate at Paquime for the first time on Sept 22, 2016 with an ethnic lunch MeetUp. 12 of us.  I asked the employee at the counter, what was the favorite menu item that their regulars come to order time and time again.  He said very affirmatively, the rib eye tacos.  I said I'll have that.  I wanted mine rare.  My rib eye tacos came RARE indeed, and they were delicious.  4 for $9, menu says you get 8 ozs of meat in them.  Although rare, they still had a hint of the charbroiled flavor in the meat.   MeetUp member sitting to my left ordered the same rib eye tacos, but \"medium rare\".  To my eyes, they were \"well done\", not even pink.  I showed him my rare color.  He said his tacos were good, but was \"not overly impressed\" with them, which he considered could be his fault.  I said if I did not get what I ordered, I'd send it back, but he did not.  Person sitting to my right ordered the fish (red snapper) tacos.  He thought they were so delicious.  I felt three 4 inch tacos for $8 wasn't much food, but then again, the fish is red snapper (they said), and not tilapia.    The corn chowder soup was really good, but everyone who tasted it, agreed, that it needed more salt.  I also tried the broccoli soup on another day.  That had enough salt!  It was really really good!  I went back on another date to try the fish tacos.  Yes, they were really delicious, but for both the fish and rib eye tacos, I keep replaying what one Yelper said about this place, copy and pasted here: \"So its a nice lil spot but i think the prices are sort of high. 4 lil street tacos is like $8bucks wtf!  Probably wont be coming bak, portions is too little for the price\".  His little review got the most \"useful\" votes, many times the others.    According to Yelper posting in  2015, the rib eye tacos were only $7.49 then, now $9.00 for four 4\" corn tortillas.  When I posted on our MeetUp that I kept thinking about, that I do not see \"value\" here for the price, either, person sitting to my right who ordered the fish tacos said \"what we were served were \"street tacos\". That's their size. I found the ingredients and presentation way above average, so I would definitely go back. The prices? We're paying for better food quality, not size of portion....my 3 cents\".  I said to him \"You might like The Mission in Scottsdale, cos you get even LESS for more money ($12 for only three 3\" meat tacos, no sides), but it is really tasty.  I told him I like paying for better food quality AND generous size of portion BOTH. Two of those places is Kyber Halal and it's sister restaurant Tahoorah Grill's Sunday buffet.  Otherwise I would give Paquime 5 stars if I paid $7.49 for the rib eye tacos.    Today, I spoke to the Paquime manager about rib eye tacos being $7.49 last year and $9.00 this year.  He said that the price of ribeye tacos will go UP again, SOON, cos it is costing them more and more money to get the ribeye, and they are losing money.  He dared me to find cheaper rib eye tacos anywhere in the Phoenix  area.  I bought the Flan Napolitano $4, because a Yelper said it was the best flan she ever had in her life!  I agree, couldn't remember a richer flan.  But there are two kinds, Flan Napolitano is baked, and in the pictured take-out clear container.  The other one is more orange in color, and she said is boiled, and comes in a clear round sealed container, called Flan Casero $3 (Casero = homemade), which I did not try.    I will come here again to try the other tacos, and the $3 \"boiled\" flan.."}
{"text":"Drive by daily on my way to work. Stopped with the hubby tonight after a DBacks game.  We were hungry, but not 'starving'...so we didn't want a heavy, cheese-laden plate with rice and beans.  I like a \"little of this and little of that\" so we ordered two different kinds of tacos, since they come 4 (of the same kind) to a plate. They are perfect little street tacos and made fresh to order, so don't expect your order in 2 minutes.  Fresh grilled accompaniments are included on the plate... a yummm mild pepper and grilled green onion. They also have the salsa bar, it also has the grilled peppers, pickled parrots and jalapenos, 3 different salsas, pickled red onions, limes... just good, fresh stuff.  We got the al pastor and fish tacos.  Both my husband and I agreed, they were tasty...full of flavor and freshly made.  We'll be back and we are looking forward to trying other menu items.  On the way out we smiled and said it was our first time in and that we would return.  The cook over-heared and pridefully smiled and said 'excellente?!'  Yes... excellente!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent little South American eatery in Sunny Slope. The food is fantastic and the staff very friendly.  They have a wide variety of favors to choose from so there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place while traveling. Tacos volteados and ribeye tacos were amazing. Green tea pomegranate was quenching in the 90 degree fall day."}
{"text":"Love the food and the new concept from Paquime. Something that caught my attention was the jicama wraps with meat instead of using corn or flour tortillas. Awesome taste and feels a lot healthier when you eat these awesome dishes."}
{"text":"amazed. came with my daughter just being adventurous while in town during the Dream City Church conference and wow - fresh food, great flavor, sweet environment, solid customer service... certainly a nice way to get \"street mexican food\" without being worried about it being too \"street\" - just a sweet spot with fantastic food. i am not a vegetarian but i tried the jicama slices subbed in for tortillas on a taco - and loved it. yeah... we'll be back. wish they had these in SoCal. thanks paquime team! (note: they actually messed up on my order and overcharged me a bit - i didn't notice until THEY pointed it out and made it right. they earned some trust in my book with that.) #betterbyfarthanchipotle #mynewfavoritemexicanrestaurant"}
{"text":"Went back a few years later and more unforgettable experience then the last .  I had the cubano torta that was out of this world. My mom had the barbacoa tacos that were better than any other i had in the valley . From this moment forward , we will be regulars . Best kept secret in my opinion ."}
{"text":"A friend took me here because he was raving about the Ribeye tacos.  Let me just say they were amazing.  By far the best tacos I have had here in Phoenix.  Everyone should definitely come give it a try.  Happy 4th of July!"}
{"text":"I was so thrilled when I found out they opened a paquime just 5 minutes away from my house, now I don't have to drive to the one on 43rd Ave and indianschool . The ribeye tacos are to die for freshly made to order. Strawberry and cream with nuts are my favorite and the fresh waters are delicious"}
{"text":"Great food. Trending location. Wish the parking and seating options were a little better. I get the bean burrito every time with their homemade chips and love it."}
{"text":"This place is just wonderful.  I grew up in Phoenix and visit my parents and friends often.  My wife found this place on Yelp and we took my parents to it on our last night in town for our last trip, and boy was it good.  My wife and I got two different kinds of tacos so we could sample more items, including swapping between us.  They were excellent.  My parents got the same burritos and not only did they love them, but my wife and I finished my mom's and we also loved them.  And boy, do they do Tres Leches cake right!  We're definitely returning here the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I stopped in today for some take out for lunch, the place was immaculate and the staff was very friendly. I immediately was offered a sample of soup when I walked up to the counter. Soup was great, got a Cubana Torta and some soup to go. Took a good sampling of the different salsas and went home. The bread!!! OMG the bread was amazing tasted fresh baked. The torta, while not heavy and greasy like Los Reyes was super filling, light and filled with high quality ingredients. I'm stopping myself from going back and getting the hot dog, elote and tres leches cake for dinner. I will not rest until I've tried everything on the menu, I've already made plans to take my friend here this week. If only they had tequila, maybe someday...lol"}
{"text":"If you love street tacos with authentic flavor than Paquime is for you. The portions are great and the quality is top notch."}
