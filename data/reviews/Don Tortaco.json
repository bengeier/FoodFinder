Ive been here for about 20 minutes and the customer in front of me is still waiting for his food. The last customer that came in got her food before anyone else. Wtf? Theres dirty tables and sticky floors. We finally got our food... Well 80% of it. Glad we checked before we left."}

I've eaten here twice because I was broke and starving and after both times I've regret it. If I want my food covered in oil i would have taken my plate to auto zone...
  Your better off going to Faustos Mexican grill. It's right down the street off of Rainbow and Robindale.."}
{"text":"This is my absolute go to place for late night snacks! I love their Carne Asada burrito. I always tell them extra guacamole !its so delicious and very filling. We also love their carne asada fries . They load it with perfectly cooked fries and and lots of meat. Perfect for any hangover cure. They even have a drive thru which I like a lot . Also customer service is excellent even though their English isn't all that good, but they always understand and serve my food with a friendly smile. If you love Mexican street food I recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food I ever had. The burrito is wet, and tasteless. The torta is tasteless also. Even the Pepsi taste weird. And the price is way too expensive for food served on disposable plates. Even Green Burrito inside of Carl's Jr. taste way better.

If you see a line at this place, they are waiting for the Starbuck next door. Don't be confused by it."}
{"text":"This place is super good! I love their shredded chicken there! I always get chicken tacos and they always got the spot! They have great customer service as never forget anything I order.plus it's nice and close to home !"}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place after going to another Mexican Restaurant, around the corner on Losee, and finding absolutely no chicken dishes! They said \"we only serve beef and pork\". And I noticed said place was also pricey!

It was late and I wanted Mexican food, with pollo, so put in the old internet search and saw this 24 hour restaurant 900 feet away.

I ordered the number 7,  chicken enchilada and chicken taco combo.

The food was flavorable, just a tad salty. The beans were good. Not like the slop you get at some of the 24 hour restaurants. 

The portions were large. It was definitely worth the $7 charged.

I will definitely come back here whenever I'm back in Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"Amazing Fajita's with homemade tortilla's, great carne asada fries and good salsa. For the money it's the best fast Mexican in Vegas."}
{"text":"Meh. I wasn't too excited about trying this place out after the bad reviews, but my Dad wanted to do drive-thru. It was ok.  We still prefer Roberto's. The beans were better than Roberto's; not runny like Roberto's. Not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Major attitude from staff! Left the drive through telling them thanks a lot for the horrible service and drove down to Roberto's. Does this company have a corporate office? Do you even care that your staff is driving away business?"}

{"text":"Omg best Mexican food I've had in a while. I wish I could go here more often! The quality of food is phenomenal, and the quantity is huge.

I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone that's looking for good Mexican food!!!"}

{"text":"Horrible Food extra grease and non melted cheese"}
{"text":"So this is gunna be a long one. 

Love the chimichangas here (if I get it with carnitas, the chicken is too dry). I think they're pretty amazing but the customer service is so bad that it makes me not want to come back. There's one guy in particular who's always there and who seems to have an attitude any time I ask for alternations (ex: carnitas instead of chicken, sauces on the side) which makes ordering unpleasant. 

The last time I ate here I got some enchiladas in addition to a chimichanga. I was with two other people and when I ordered only two plates he was like, \"Only two plates?\" and said it with an attitude. It was rude, but I shrugged it off. I just wanted my food and I didn't want any drama. They brought the food, but then one of the people I was with took a bite of the enchiladas, and it turned out the enchiladas were gross. So she (one of the people I was with) took it up there and asked if she could switch it for something else and pay the difference. She was very polite and patient, and even did it discreetly so the other customers wouldn't hear the exchange. 

The man flat out refused. He talked about how nobody had ever said they didn't like his food before (which I doubt, you work at a food business). He straight up said no. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. How rude he was being. How rude he had been each time I had come in. But this was so over the top and more extreme than anything else he had done. Finally, after a few minutes of arguing, the person I was with finally got upset and the guy tried to backpedal and offered to get her the chimichanga (which she had asked for in the first place). But at that point we were just upset and wanted our money back. 

Never in life have I experienced something like this. The guy took personal offense just because we didn't like his food. I find that to be both unprofessional and ridiculous. We were paying customers, didn't like what we got and wanted something else. It was simple, but he blew the entire thing out of proportion. 

This experience, despite how much I like the chimichangas, has made me not want to return. Treat your customers right. Don't be rude when they ask for alternations (people have preferences and allergies. It's not a big deal if they ask for a different meat, or sauces on the side). And please, for the love of God, don't take it personally if someone doesn't like the food. This isn't your home. This is a place of business. We pay money to eat here. 

Decent chimichangas. Horrible customer service. And I don't care how good any food is, it's not worth it if I have to deal with horrible employees."}
{"text":"The cooks must have not been on there A game,

The carne asada burrito tasted undercooked and the meat didn't taste good almost tasted like it's been sitting there for a day, I admit the burrito is decent in size portion in which most people may not eat the whole thing,

The prices our decent, not too expensive and not too cheap,

We also had a bean burrito which honestly looked disgusting but who cares,  goes in one hole comes out they other ;)


However this place gave me and my friend the runs don't know if it was the carne asada burrito or the bean burrito

Which had us feeling disgusting, avoid this place

Your better off eating at chile verde or faustos"}

So one night, craving a shrimp cocktail from Roberto's, but already home and not wanting to leave my comfy pjs, I decided to come here. After ordering I was asked to park in the front of the restaurant, as well as the two cars that came in behind me. My food was brought out, 20 minutes after pulling to the front, and incorrect. I proceeded to wait another 15 minutes! When I got home (I live 2 minutes away) everything was cold. So my company very unhappily ate a cold dinner. Next time I'll throw some jeans on and go to Roberto's."}

Call up to complain, told them repeatedly I no longer had the receipt, she said no manager in the store, but that they'd remake the meals. I get into the car and drive back over. The twit in the drive thru demands the wrong meals back which I didn't grab as I flew out the door. She refuses to do anything, I then demand my money back as we now need to get dinner elsewhere as we can't eat rice. She demands the receipt which I'd already explained ad nauseum that I no longer had. She's treating me like I'm in the wrong when it was their no English comprehending illegal who screwed up. We'd eaten there several times in the past but will no longer give them business."}
{"text":"Great California burrito. They always get my order right. Great Mexican food, for Vegas, that is."}
{"text":"I went to this location tonight. As an avid Don Tortaco customer I expected the same service I would get from any other location. I was the only person in the restaurant at the time and I stood for a few minutes waiting for someone to come up and greet me. I saw them in the back eating and chatting and they looked at me a few times. After standing at the front for 10 minutes and no \"hi\" or no \"be with you\" or even a \"Go away we don't wanna serve you\" I asked one of the workers how they were doin and as soon as I said it he turned his head and started speaking in Spanish to someone in the drive through! I've never been so completely disrespected in my life, this isn't the first time these people have been rude as they seem to have something against you if you look Hispanic but don't address them in Spanish. I finally ended up just walking out after 15 minutes of standing there like an idiot and 3 more minutes of just plain disbelief. As someone who also works in food service I can't believe this establishment would allow people like this to work in their store and represent them. I'm so disgusted. When I got back in the car my daughter asked me why I didn't have food and I had to tell her \" I guess we will go somewhere else, these guys don't want to serve me\". What a terrible experience for both of us and what a bunch of low life, piece of shit scumbags. Don't support a restaurant that treats people like this. Don't go here!"}

Plusses are that it's open 24 hours and there's a drive-thru. For the lazy night owls. Or if you're like me and work late swing shifts and have a very limited number of places to get food from. 

Admittedly I'm not a big Mexican food connoisseur, so I just ordered some chicken tacos and an order of chips and guacamole. The chicken tacos were greasy, as to be expected. But the shells were HARD. Not crunchy or crispy, just straight up difficult to bite. Only ate half of one and threw it out."}

FYI everyone if you say no pico de gallo you better open your food before leaving. They have messed up my order twice before this. I finally drove back and made them re-make it as I stood and watched their every move. Then I asked for a refund. I'm normally very easy-going but enough is enough of pico de gallo!"}
{"text":"I still call this place Roberto's Taco Shop even though the cheap LED sign says otherwise.
     \"Don Tortacos\" is a very adequate and cheap alternative to high priced Mexican food;  knowing the area, there are quite a lot of them around. If I were to compare this place to other Roberto's Taco Shops, I would have to say that  this specific joint can't hold a candle to any of the franchises around the Las Vegas area.
     The quality of the food just isn't as great compared to sister franchises, and I really have no idea why. I could have sworn that restaurant chains were suppose to have the same recipe. One of my complaints is the very soggy refried beans they serve; the texture is unappealing and it's really more liquid than solid. I thought I was eating bean soup when I first tasted it. I also don't appreciate the lack of servings. If you're a Roberto's regular, you should know that the restaurant is very generous with their serving. This specific joint is not. I mean compared to other Mexican taco shops you still get a lot more, but it just doesn't live up to the Roberto's name.
     I don't want to sound like absolutely hate the food here, I actually like this place. I go here fairly frequently, given that I feel like eating Mexican food. There are a lot of things I like about this place. This specific taco shop's employees are really nice and helpful, and they're not dicks about hanging out 2 hours after you eat your food. This is also a great place for pre-drunk snacks, post-drunk snacks, and mid-drunk snacks. It's even next to a PT's Pub; get drunk then get fat. It's an amazing combination!

I suggest the Carnitas Fries, it's not on the menu but they'll make it for you. It's like an untouched potential."}
{"text":"Meh. Can't even follow simple order of sauce on the side. 
Super disappointed in the 2 options for Mexican in this area. I'll travel for better food!

Now that I've tasted both items.... 1 star. Lacks flavor. At least throw some salt on it!!"}
{"text":"yo estube este fin de semana en las vegas y pues me recomendaron este restaurant y esta super yo le doy un\" 10\", su comida esta super  y los 

burritos de carne asada, y de carnitas estan super"}
{"text":"Roberto's, Roberto's, oh how do I love your greasy, authentic goodness that is classified as Mexican food. When I lived in Las Vegas, I went to school not to far from this location, and Robert always did me good during lunch period. And, if not then, then after-hours. Oh, how I miss stumbling in to Roberto's at 3am for some of the best drunk food I've ever experienced. If you want light (as light as you can get at Roberto's), go for the taquitos with cheese and guacamole, and mix the red and green sauces at the condiment bar. My personal fav would have to be the made-to-order carne asada burrito with cheese and guacamole added also with the mixed red/green sauces. I miss it just thinking about it. One time, I ventured off and tried the breakfast burrito which was as equally tasty, but I know that the carne asada burrito missed me so I had to go back (what can I say, I'm a sucker for love)."}
{"text":"Delicious, Hot, Mexican Goodness! For being a small shop, they go BIG at Don Tortaco. I'm not gonna lie, I can barely walk right now. The burritos are epic and stuffed full of meat and veggies, and the sauces provided inside (haven't gone through the drive-through yet) are exquisite. The gal who took our order spoke perfect English and was very friendly.
Now my one gripe is with their chicken burrito. It tastes great, but they for some reason take two big pieces of chicken breast and just stuff them in there, which makes it very difficult to eat! If you order this I strongly recommend asking them to slice that chicken up a bit first.
They have ala carte items that range from $4-$6 or combo plates (very filling), of which most are about $8 after tax. Very modestly priced because the dishes are, despite being a fast-food type joint, easily $16 restaurant quality.
Up to this point I have seen what appear to be some very unfair reviews, and I must say that I strongly disagree with them. If you are a good person with a positive attitude who just happens to live in Southern Highlands (maybe by accident? fate?), and you like Mexican food, this place is worth a fair shot.
But if you are one of \"those\" people, just go to Taco Bell... Its right next door. ;)"}
{"text":"Inspite of the lackluster reviews, I Decided to try this place out because its 24 hours and close to my house. So i get to the place around 5am. The drive thru is not very well lit besides the menus and its a very quite and vacant area when you pull in. I wanted to just test the place out so i didn't order anything to big or crazy. I Went with just 3 Carne Asada Tacos.

I pulled up to the window. The guy took my money i think about $8.50 and i proceeded to wait a good 5 minutes at the window. I Have no problem waiting cause usually that means its made when its ordered. Order came up and i told the guy i want red and green sauce and jalapenos. He looked at me and said very matter of factly YES OK.. Was kinda funny.

So i get home thinking they are probably going to be some wimpy little tacos, As i open the box i'm amazed at the huge size of these things! Loaded with lots of meat, pico de gallo and guacamole. They tasted as good as they looked and i will definitely be back. I'll remember to take a picture next time. i just wanted to dig right in!!"}
{"text":"Food is decent but oh my god does the drive thru suck. No matter what time I go they're not very pleasant in the drive thru but its exceptionally bad early in the morning because sometimes I stop for a breakfast burrito on my way to work. The guy who works around that time he does not greet you on the mic. You wait for like 4-5 minutes for him to say anything and when he does he says \"Yeah?\" then you tell him what you want and he just stays quiet. So you're like okaaayyy?? you pull up to the window and he takes like another 4-5 minutes to come to the window, doesn't give you your total or repeat your order nothing. Last time I went I asked for condiments and they told me they didn't have any and he looked annoyed with me for even asking. If the customer service was more professional and not so miserable looking/sounding I would have given this spot a solid 4 stars. Fix your shit."}
{"text":"The food is okay, not the best like another locations I have been in. The personnel is kind of rood specially the female cooked, and the say the restroom they have inside is not public and that they do not have a restroom for customers. They sometimes send you to the PTS nextdoor, but the PTS doesn't let you use their restroom either, they say that Don Tortaco has a restroom. I will not be back after all that struggle over a restroom."}
{"text":"Being from San Diego, I definitely have a good eye for taco shops. I've been hitting up another taco shop near this location at lunch and was just OK with their food. After coming to Don Tortaco, i doubt I will ever go back to the other spot. Their California burrito is a proper Cali burrito (although i recommend adding guacamole and removing pico), their tortillas are bomb and their spicy carrots are actually spicy and tender. Hot sauce is good. Overall, this place is exactly what I'm looking for in a local taco shop who can make carne and other items just like home."}
{"text":"I grew up in Cali and did 15 in Phoenix.  Lived on Mexican food.  Thus place is so BAD I had to return my overcooked taquitos, BURNT, served with runny guac. Ugh.  My Chile relleno burrito could have been made better by 9 year old white girl.   Gringos stay away, this is the worst Mexican  food I've ever had, next to the tomain piosened beans I once had"}
{"text":"Horrible service, not friendly cashier. Also food so greasy & I got super sick...never eat there again"}
{"text":"I've been here twice at night and I'm not sure if that makes a difference but the two times that I have ordered the nacho's, I received the SAME disappointing platter. First, where are the chips? What I get are crushed up crumbs that are supposed to be chips at the bottom of the nacho's. Second, the meat is not hot. Like it's been sitting in warm water, drained and added to your meal when your order has been placed. I will give a compliment to the delicious  guacamole but that's about it."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos-euphoric! Regular burritos-heavenly. Chips and cheese-dreamy. I haven't had a single thing here that wasn't just what I was looking for (if kind of greasy deliciousness is what the mood calls for). The service is pretty standard. Nothing to complain about.  Just what one would expect."}
{"text":"Gave my family food poisoning on 5/29, so officially no reason to go back. Service was always poor when I'd go in the late evenings. The guys seemed like they'd rather be anywhere else. Too bad.. it was convenient to have a Mexican place near me. Unfortunately there are no Roberto's around here."}
{"text":"This the hands down the worst Don Tortaco I've ever been to. If you have a quick craving for some quick Mexican food, you're better off driving an extra 2-5 minutes to Roberto's down the street. 

Potions are so scarce and the wait time is horrendous. I dropped in on a Tuesday afternoon and there was only 2 other people dining there and there was no one in the drive thru and it took them 10 + minutes to take my order. There was no one else in line. 

If I could give 0 stars, I definitely would."}
{"text":"This place gets 2 stars cause the food is decent.  The biggest problem I have with this place is they can never get my order right. I always check my order before I leave but the burritos they always screw up. Can't really tell what's in it until you take a bite and I'm not about to unroll a burrito before the leave the restaurant.  Maybe I'll be going back to Robertos"}

Or the slightest trace of melted cheese when I cook my nachos at home my cheese melts the cheese was cold and hard on the top. Upon coming in there was another couple that had sent there meal back twice for failed of freshness"}
{"text":"Sometimes ill hit this place on my way home from work. Stopped the other night and ordered a chili relleno burrito. How do you fuck up a chilli relleno burrito? These guys can. Scorched tasting beans and rice and a chilli relleno that was frozen still. Basically a watery scorched tasting burrito that leaked all over and had a frozen chili in the middle. I threw it out of the window i was so pissed. Wont go back ever. Hopefully no one does. Place sucks."}
{"text":"We were so excited for this new location to open up, closer to home and with a drive thru. But it's been a hit and miss from opening day. So, I guess we'll stick to driving a little further down on Blue Diamond and stick to the location located between Buffalo & Cimarron (with no drive thru)...even though we're literally at the corner of Durango & Blue Diamond and this is our closest location. So since day 1 that it opened we've had some hiccups with our orders...but this particular day a few days ago was the last straw for me. Came through the drive thru on Tuesday March 14th ordered the 3pc taquitos with guacamole and cheese.. make it home which is literally around the corner open up my food and first reaction I'm like WTF?! Like are they serious? Who in there right mind prepares and bags up something like this for a customer. Like come on! I was so infuriated that I drove back through all the construction that is currently going on, on durango (if u live in the area, you know it's been a nightmare) I ended up going into the restaurant and there were a few gentlemen inside (Caucasian) so I didn't want to make a big deal even though I was upset. Myself being Hispanic...the lady at the counter/cashier immediately saw that I had my bag which she had just handed to me not more than probably 10 minutes prior...asked me what I needed...no hi..how can I help you. Not a good start considering how bothered I am to begin with. So I tell her, that I just came through the drive thru ordered taquitos with guacamole and cheese...got home opened up and this is what u all gave me. I open it up to her and she looks at me and responds...okay so what's wrong with it? I'm like are you freaken serious, that infuriates me even more. I ask her to look at the picture behind her on there menu..and ask her if my order looks like that....she now rolls her eyes at me and starts arguing that, it's not going to look like that because that's a professional picture. Okay, I get it...I don't expect it to look just like the picture but come on, so I ask her in Spanish ...again because I'm trying to be as discreet as possible. If she thinks that packing up and order like this to a paying customer is acceptable. I ask her if she wouldn't be upset if the tables were turned and she was the paying customer and received a dish like this if she would be content. Instead of offering a quick solution like a simple...we can make another order for you..she just continues to argue with me. And now in Spanglish, there's some English and Spanish in there so I'm like okay, you obviously don't care and see that I was trying to be discreet with you as to not draw any attention from other patrons. Because I'm not trying to feed into the stigma that unfortunately is sometimes placed upon hispanics. But her ignorance just feed more into that. I ended up just asking for a refund and will just stick to the other Don Tortaco location further down the street.  I ended up going to the other location got taquitos and it was night and day difference as you'll see in the photos. The 3pc was from the Durango/Blue Diamond location (next to McDonalds) and the 5pc from the location on Cimarron/Blue Diamond (Pizza Hut shopping center)"}

{"text":"They are open 24/7........they better watch themselves.......why?!?!?!?!? Because
I wish I could just go in this place, casually unplug the salsa/veggie bar and roll it out the door.......yep I just said I want to steal their cooler.

I would make it an extra island in my kitchen or just replace my bedside table....I could eat the yummy goodness of carrots, green onions, salsa and radishes LIKE A BOSS! lol!

Within walking distance I could go to the gym but instead my tummy yearns for the love of Don Tortaco......yep I went there.

What I REALLLLLLLY wanted to order is The California. The first time I ordered it the language barrier lead me to believe is was going to be kinda like a carne asada loaded burrito. I only eat red meat once a week so here goes my treat..

I WAS TOTALLY WRONG AND IN LOVE.

THESE BURRITOS ARE HUGE, PIPING HOT but the tortilla has a slight grill crisp.

So slurping and yumming all over myself after taking a bite.......I took control wrapped it back up and walked home.

I was like a secret prize I needed to open and see what was inside, I walked faster and faster into a run.

I get home to grab a plate and a knife to cut it in half and I also save half my lunch 
for my hubby to try.

I cut it in half and WOW was I surprised! THERE WERE thin french fries! Loads of meat and a light cheese and some veggies and pico. At the moment I wanted to cry of guilt but also of sheer LOVE.

Lol......now that we are past that. I usually just get a veggie burrito which has beans, perfect rice, I asked for no cheese, lettuce, and pico. 

All their items have a small spice \"kick\" but it's more flavor. I LOVE hot sauce the hotter the better but hubby said it had \"a good kick\" or he would not have eaten it :)

I love Fausto's, hate Roberto's, my fam got sick at Casa Don Juan, and Mi Casa is just not the real thing."}

And they were just as good if not better the 2nd day.  I also had a taste of the carne asada burrito-and yes, that was also a 10."}
{"text":"So I always drove by this place bc i thought it'd be one of those Filibertos, Humbertos, or something-bertos. But it turned out to be surprisingly delicioso!!! BTW Flour tortillas r the closest to the ones in Mexico! :)"}
{"text":"Went in to get dinner for the family around 4:30ish. Ordered my food and when I went to pay the guy behind the counter didn't know how to use the credit card machine. I stood there for about 5 minutes while my food was being made, while he called another store or someone else to figure out how to use the credit card machine. He hung up and asked if I had any cash. OF COURSE I DONT. THATS WHY IM USING MY CARD."}
{"text":"For fast Mexican food, I love Don Tor Taco over Roberto's. The meals are made to order and are great portion size! My current favorite dish is the Chili Verde (pork). This is sooooo good!! They effort and time put into making this dish isn't easy, so it's not available everyday, but when it's made, you better try it before they run out!! I also
Love their chips and cheese. The chips are made to order!! My only problem with this place is that the spicy carrots are mushy. I don't like them cooked that way."}
{"text":"Drive thru quick Mex?  YAAAAAASSSS.  Is it the best Mexican food in Vegas? No, but that's not why you come here.  Rolled tacos with tons of guacamole, phat burritos, this amazing shrimp plate!  That's why you come here!  It's good and quick and cheap."}
{"text":"So this was my first place I tried out here since moving to town and I have mixed emotions...the gal working was SUPER sweet friendly and helpful...just was SUPER slow service.  I was patient but the people who had been waiting a while to even place their order were definitely annoyed.  I ordered a Bean and cheese burrito to keep it simple and it was delish! Took a while, but was fresh and the tortilla was fresh and a little flakey- nom! Also, the place is super clean- no fear of food poisoning here! Lol 
So if you're not in a hurry and have some patience this place is worth the try!"}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday the food was really good the 2 burritos I got were really big and when I'm talking big I mean big enough to fill you up the rest of the day the fries were good as they were fresh and crispy and they give you alot of fries. The cheese quesadilla was good but way too much cheese but it was still good the only negative about this place is that if you want to go to the bathroom you have to go all the way through the back of the kitchen but other then that this will be my go to spot to eat at when I'm craving Mexican food."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place.  I ordered the menudo, and was very disappointed.  It had no flavor. I added 3 slices of lemon, 1 cup of salsa, 2 small packs of salt. It then tasted a bit better.   My friend ordered camarones a la diabla.  He described the sauce as tasting like can tomatoes sauce with chile. It looked watery to me.  Horchata was good. I will not come to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I love eating here normally I go to the one down the street because the customer service and food is always on point. Unfortunately I went against my gut and wanted to use the drive through on blue diamond and Durango. I asked for no meat because I am a vegetarian and literally they were so rude at the window. When I received my food my bag was sealed tied at the top which makes it impossible to open and keep everyone behind me waiting so I head home come to find out my fries are FILLED with asada. I'm just mind blown my whole meal is ruined and I don't even have the energy nor do I want to go back to tell them they made a mistake. I'm all about understanding mistakes do happen in the F&B industry but it's sad I don't even feel comfortable telling them they made a mistake bc of how rude they were in the first place. Never using this place again."}
{"text":"Getting a food here is like getting a jackpot. It depends what you get when you getting food here. And night time people are very slow they take forever to make your food. They are very lazy.  food is not that great it's okay. It's pretty expensive."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the fact they were only days open but the service was terribly slow and they messed up our food. It took 25 minutes to get 2 chile rellenos, a quesadilla, and 3 lengua tacos. The tacos were ordered with no pico specifically yet they had more pico than meat, and we also ordered two other tacos of a different protein that were left off. The man waiting before us looked upset when we got there. He waited at least another 15 minutes on top of whatever wait he had before our arrival. There were a few positives that hopefully can be expanded to all of the food as well as service. The horchata was delicious, as was the quesadilla. I would go back for those but I don't know if I'm willing to wait 15-20 minutes for it. I hope they work on the service so we can try again!"}
{"text":"Food is not that great. 
Roberto's is better. 
Definitely not worth the money, I can make better rolled tacos for a lot less."}
{"text":"I have kids so a drive thru is a plus! I always get the carne asada tacos. The best!!! I love this place I come here at least once a week and the food is always good. It's worth the five minute wait in the drive-through."}
{"text":"One location wasn't open 24 hours even though it said 24/7. This location has a sign that says Breakfast Burritos $2.99 until noon but cashier wouldn't honor it. Said it was until 11 we pointed out the sign and she said the sign needs to be changed."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, comparable in taste to Robertos. Same feel about the place too. I like it. Their green salsa is great."}
{"text":"They are rude. Kept my change that was owed back to me, not that I need it. It's principal. Asked for rice and beans in my carnitas burrito and they gave me cheese and sour cream. I'm done with this place and I'm gonna tell the whole world! Lol."}
{"text":"I was in town for EDC and if you've been to EDC you know that most of the food you consume if any is drive thru fast food. 

So before heading back to LA I was determined to find mexican food to fill me up b4 my drive a! I stumbled upon this restaurant and I ordered a chile relleno and enchilada plate it came with rice and beans. I also ordered a side of chips and cuacamole and to drink I went with a jarritos! All for about $14 

The portion matched the price. Plus the salsa bar was good. It had those pickled carrots I LOVE!!!

The staff was friendly but were distracted watching the Mexico game. I had to remind them about my chips and guac. But no problem. I would have prolly be watching the game also. Overall the food was delicious I will be back next year!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for almost 3 months  and the service and quality of the food is going down at rapid speed. However the price seems to never be the same . Overcharged yo many times here . The guy in the back that That doesn't speak English seems to put anything together no matter how old the fries may be or how old the taco maybe. It's a gamble every time I go . The rude guy at the register is ether talking on the phone to his family so he doesn't  get the my order right or his family is in they restaurant and he is spending time with them . And seems to be mad when I walk in to interrupt. He needs to look for a new job because he never seems happy . When he messes up on your order he makes you pay to replace it . The worst customer service and food is getting older and faster prepared. I would love to spend money there more often however I can't , please get new workers that look like they want to be there  and me and my family will spend our hard earned money with you mr or mrs owner"}
{"text":"Very authentic! I've received fast and accurate orders. Only gave 4 stars because some menu items are a bit greasy but that's the real deal, right?"}
{"text":"My go-to place for breakfast burritos. I call ahead for two breakfast burritos with just eggs and potatoes and its ready when I get there in about 5-10 min. Almost too much to eat, but after a hard morning workout it really hits the spot. Staff is friendly, too. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Authentic? For real? Ordered a chimichanga. Have been struggling to get a steak knife through it and its pork! Ordered pork because its pretty hard to mess up. Maybe its frozen/microwave. Anyway... rice, zero flavor. Actually kinda brown like they got grease in the white rice and forgot to make spanish rice. Carnitas.... zero, no flavor or spice, dry and tough like jerky. Beef and chicken tacos too. Everyone is unhappy.  Expensive dissapointment."}
{"text":"This is like the go to Taco shop. Definitely fast food, food is just ok. It's close and convenient,  but not my top pick for Mexican food.  Carnitas plate is the best thing I've eaten here."}
{"text":"Excellent food, better prices then Robertos  and super clean building. The staff does seem to have some attitude, but I'm there to eat,  so I rank them on their amazing breakfast burritos and super nachos!"}
{"text":"Cheap delicious eats, generous too.  Ate rolled  cruncy 5 tacos for $6. Also chicken enchiladas with rice and beans with a taco..mmm like that red sauce is poured generously on my enchiliada. Salsa bar is good portions  with limes."}
{"text":"bomb fucking carne asada fries when youre drunk after a barty! everyone should know about this place"}
{"text":"The food was good although I wish they had ground beef.. The store was clean as a  normal fast food enviroment . The TV was in spanish so I couldnt  understand much that was being said. The staff was not real friendly or engageing although they stayed busy even though there were very few drive thru customers and no walkins while I was there..I was the only dine in customer my whole time there.. maybe timing...."}
{"text":"No comparisons to the local Fausto's , but I think it's better than robertos down the road... which isn't saying much."}
{"text":"pretty good!  I was a huge fan of the refried beans but not so much of the beef taco...the meat was a little bland.  The cinnamon rice drink they had was awesome!  I will give it another go round."}
{"text":"The best I meen the best adobada tacos i ate in my life....... Is acrross the street hahah... For real its a must"}
{"text":"I finally just have to take the time and write the review. This place has let me down over and over again for the last few years. Yes, I know I'm being gullible. But in a hurry or a pinch, I'm always hoping that just this one time will be good. It never is. 

I'm a gringo. And I owned a respected Mexican joint in Washington from state. I have the urge to go in there and teach the Mexicans how to make Mexican rice. The problem is, they'll have the best rice in town, but the rest of it will still suck. 

Just don't spend your money here. It's never good."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad. Definitely better than half baked burrito I got from somehow the only stoner white kid in the entire Roberto's staff the other day. Place was awful. 

When you're at the counter ask the cashier what her name is. If it's Isabelle, she's the only staff member I have ever seen handle food without washing her hands ever. 

All an all an average experience."}
{"text":"Their rolled tacos & burritos are good. Not the best but good and consistent for a neighborhood drive through taco shop. Their guac is more of a sour cream based guac but still good. They have a little salsa bar inside with green & red salsas & spicy carrots & radishes. A big plus is that they're open 24hrs. Their breakfast burritos are huge, delicious & very filling."}
{"text":"1st day open !! Fast great food!! Huge portions and good w pricing. Free condiments. Drive thu and also open 24hours"}
{"text":"One of my Vegas go to spots is Don Tortaco, so you can imagine my shock and sadness when I saw that this location was no longer there.

I'm not saying I started to weep uncontrollably, but I may have shed a tear or two.

Then my ever caring and super observant wife said,
stop being a big baby,
as she pointed to their new location across the street.

Then she said how nice it was that the new locale has a drive thru.

And just to show you how much she knows your truly,
the last thing thing she said was,
you better mention it was me who found it when you do your review. 

Oh my dear better half, of course, I'll make sure to mention you."}
{"text":"First of all... I wish I could put ZERO Stars! Don Tortaco is a Rip-Off, \"Wanna-be\" of ROBERTO's and they are just stealing money from Roberto's Brand and market share!  Roberto's actually puts Meat in their food and gives you great food at a value! Don Tortaco's does NOT! THEIR Chicken Enchiladas are a JOKE! THEY HAVE ALMOST NO CHICKEN! I WISH TORTACO's ALL WENT OUT OF BUSINESS and that the REAL DEAL, ROBERTOS bought out the LOCATIONS! So tired of being ripped off! F%@k Y%u Tortaco!"}
{"text":"When this part of Las Vegas was still under development,
Don Tortaco was still Roberto's
and one of the few places to grab a quick bite.

Times have changed
and now a bevy of eateries
can be found up and down
South Rainbow,
but they remained my go to spot.

Recently,
Don Tortaco moved from one
side of Rainbow
to the other.

And I guess I can't really blame them for the move.
This new location is bigger,
better lit,
and now has a drive thru.

The food is as good as ever
and provides yours truly tasty
late night nachos
when binge watching
or when wanting to start 
the day off with a hearty breakfast burrito.

So to close,
Stay gold, Don Tortaco."}
{"text":"I stop here when i need a quick bite after working late hour shifts. its a great place if your hungry and need it late after midnight kinda time."}
{"text":"Food is ok at best. Service was not the greatest either, like she didn't even want to take my order. Lastly the plate I ordered had sour cream on the item. I got no sour cream whatsoever and they also wanted to charge me $1 for a spoonful. Just not good business. Plenty of other places I can eat and I think I'll do so."}
{"text":"Decent pricing, particularly on the specials: $5 will get you a breakfast burrito with chorizo and egg, while just over $6 will get you a plate with two huge lengua tacos. Not bad at all!

Salsa bar has several fresh options as well as carrots, onions, and cucumbers. Bottled traditional sodas are available in a cooler by the register. Service may or may not speak even basic English, which is a little alarming- \"Add cheese, please\" should not require you grabbing the cook to translate."}
{"text":"Yelp search produced 3 Don Tortacos within the 5 mile radius, yes they are that popular, and I'll soon know why. This is the closest from my place, a non descript stall in the middle of the compound, and my hunt for a Mexican style street food is on!

Two items I had tried so far: the lengua taco which is average but worth a bite; meat is tender but overly moist that it is actually bland, and therefore requires additional seasoning and salsa. On the other hand, the carnitas plate is the \"Don King\" and I meant it on high regard - 4 1/2 star just for this dish. Both comes with rice and beans and let me just say they are tastefully spot on hmmm hmmm.

Why three stars? Because of high marks on food, in slight contrast to the service which is one off that I would expect - on my first visit here, they can't offer me a cup of water because they run out of it, yes, my throat stayed parched from the 100 degree outside. Despite that though, I shall return..."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos $2.99 before 11am. DONE. A+ Bye Roberto's!!! I am adding additional text here because yelp says my review is shorter than normal and since Don Tortaco's serves above average sized burritos I don't want my review to be shorter than most. Peace out!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great take-out Mexican restaurant.
It is clean with great staff. The food is excellent and service is fast!"}
{"text":"This Roberto's is a very clean location, but is not very busy.  They also don't have a drive-thru.  They don't have a lot of tables to eat at either.  They are very nice at this location and have a good understanding of English.  Another plus is that they offer the shrimp burrito, but a lot different than other locations.  They offer it with a lot of cheese sauce inside.  After your meal, you can shop in the Sahara Pavilion, which has a lot of nice shopping in it, including a very nice Borders that is the largest in town in way of books."}
{"text":"I tried to order a California burrito with chicken. They tell me they are out of chicken. I said fine ill take a regular California burrito. 10 minutes later and a drive home all I have is a plain chicken burrito I tried calling twice they don't answer the phone - I'm very sad I really wanted cheese pico and fries in my burrito"}
{"text":"Really quick great food. The drive thru took some time but that is because they make it fresh!"}
{"text":"Roberto's is ok and has plenty of options, but at the end of the day I would rather go to Fausto's or Phat Phranks.  They have better prices and make the order the way you want without any confusion.

We order from Roberto's a few times and asked for no onion or no pico etc.. and they managed to mess it up too many times.  Love the location, but will drive further for someone who understands what I want."}
{"text":"I'm seriously disappointed in the service. The food is fine. I mainly go there because they have a drive thru, but these last two times have made me so frustrated that I'm never eating here again. All I wanted was a bag of hot carrots to go with my tacos. I asked for them at the speaker box and at the window. The lady forgot them the first time. The second time, the guy told me that I had to pull around and come in to get them myself. Excuse me, but wtf? Why would I go to the drive thru, and go through all that if I still had to get out of the car? If I'm going to get out of my car, I'm taking my happy ass to Roberto's next door where the food is better anyway. Bottom line, it's about convenience. If the food were better, maybe the service could be overlooked."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times now and they have messed up EVERY single time. Do yourself a favor and go to Fausto's on Rainbow."}
{"text":"One of my late night stop when I stay out in blue diamond area!"}
{"text":"This place is the reason I have a 4 pack (if you look really hard) instead of a 6 pack. 

I promise myself that I'm not gonna stop for chicken tacos on my way home, but I can't help it. 

Myfitnesspal says they've got similar nutritional info to a Quest Bar, only they taste like actual food (tacos are actual food). 

The taco Tuesday deal is out of sight too. Chicken tacos are $.99 on Tuesdays. 

I could eat 5 of them (and I have). 

The late night guys are so nice too. 

It's got a 24 hour drive thru."}
{"text":"This place gets a four stars because its a quick and easy place to get a quick bite to eat especially if your on a hurry, and doesn't want to goo to a fast food joint. Also being open 24/7 is also a plus."}
{"text":"I think the only reason I haven't written a review for Roberto's is that I try so hard to pretend that it doesn't exist.

(This location is now known as Don Tortaco, although the staff told me - at least I think they did, through the muttering - that it's the same as Roberto's. I know that nothing has changed menu-wise or decor-wise.)

I've been to this Roberto's/Don Tortaco's three times. The first time was about five years ago. I had the cheese enchiladas. They were like a nasty gravy with two lumps of cheese log. My mouth felt all gaggy not long after eating them. Shoot, there go my dreams of 24/7 Mexican right around the corner.

\"No, you have to try the burritos!\" 

That's what everyone said. But my first experience was so bad that I wasn't going to risk another visit, and I'm not really a fan of places where people make excuses for the food based on the one thing the restaurant (supposedly) does well.

Years passed. I finally had a burrito at another Roberto's. It was more or less inoffensive. More or less. Hmm. Okay.

Encouraged, two weeks ago I had a (bean and cheese) burrito at this location, and it was... okay. I could see eating it in a lazy moment... if it were quite late and I was quite tired and I was very hungry, and in this case all of these factors were present. The burrito lacked any fresh ingredients at all, but for the price, no surprise, and there is a sort of salad bar with salsa, whole spring onions (?), carrots, and so forth with sandwich bags and little plastic cups if you want to dress your takeaway up. Wilty and grubby, but something.

So, a week ago I found myself in similar tired/late/hungry circumstances, so I popped down the street for another burrito, cheese enchiladas, and a bean tostada. (The last item alone took several minutes to order as the staff seemed to have as hard a time conveying information in English as receiving it.) I figured that since the burrito wasn't so awful last time, I'd give everything a chance.

The look of the cheese enchiladas has vastly improved. The taste has, too, but it still wasn't good. I had three or four bites before I asked myself what the heck I was doing and stopped.

The bean tostada was composed of possibly the grossest tortilla-based product I've ever put in my mouth. The tostada shell was chewy, like a Rice Krispies treat, and covered in what I will call \"bean-based muck.\" A little shredded lettuce was sprinkled over that. I'm not sure how I got to the second bite, but I certainly went no further.

And the burrito was just like someone had scraped some room temperature refried beans straight from a can onto a day-old tortilla.... except not that good. Again, two bites. One to taste, and one more to confirm that indeed all three items I'd ordered were just plain yucky.

I got to think about this a lot the next day, when I stayed home from work to catch up on my sleep, what with having been up all night in porcelain-based penance for those eight bites.

I'm never eating here again. Why? There's a grocery store right across the street. Forget tired/hungry/late - I will never be so lazy to eat food this bad again."}
{"text":"The flavor and quality of carne asada and cheese is far better than Fausto and Roberto's. Plus the drive thru is a plus.  I had the carne asada nachos and the burritos several times and they have great flavor."}
{"text":"Meh. This is a repurposed Roberto's and let me tell you, it does not compare at all. It's ok or whatever, but... meh."}
{"text":"I've been a regular at this Rainbow Blvd Location for years.  No more.  Not only did the prices go up but, the quality has gone way down.  I just at the worst chimichanga I've ever had.  Bland and flavorless, greasy, because the temperature of the fryer was too low.  And the place looks filthier than its ever been ...."}
{"text":"Definitely the rudest customer service you'll receive in town. Slow and always get your order wrong. I've tried this location multiple times and they always mess up such a simple order. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Love the food. Basically obsessed with it. They have Mexican sodas which is awesome because I'm allergic to corn and Mexican soda is made with real sugar. The adobode is off the charts."}
{"text":"1st off this place is not called Robertos but Don Tortaco! 2nd I called in my order so that I wouldn't have to wait but lucky me I got the new guy who didnt take down my order correctly. So here I am writing my review as I wait for my food. Got home and my carne asada plate had corn tortillas and not flour! That might seem minor to some but I can't stand corn tortilla. First and last time coming here!!!"}
{"text":"I order the plate with beans,rice and two tamales with red sauce it was a bomb really good first time going there very nice employees its small place but, I will totally go again!!!! Yummy....."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Piled high food. Quick and fast service. I never have had a hard time ordering. I'm never upset with an order."}
{"text":"I've been to this location tons of times and everything has always been great. This trip was the exception because within a few house of my 3 year old eating half of a shredded chicken burrito he started projectile vomiting. He's never thrown up in his life until this burrito so now I'm a bit skeptical but the 2 breakfast burritos and menudo had no effect on any of the adults that ate there. I'll be leaving chicken out of my future orders for sure."}
{"text":"True, authentic, delicious and cheap. We had the steak and eggs. They allowed us to have rice and beans instead of toast and hash browns. Fresh cooked beans, fresh Salsa Mexicana. Cheaper than Denny's across the street. Open 24/7"}
{"text":"great Mexican food spot! we order lunch from here all the time we just call in our order n it's ready for us in 15 min."}
{"text":"Carne Asada fries under $9. It is the same portion as Roberto but $3 cheaper! It taste the same and 24hrs too. I found a replacement."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here! Nothing better than some fresh, humongous, delicious burritos or tacos. I enjoy the salsa bar every time I go here. Check out the specials, they're always good."}
{"text":"Feeling really irritated! Wow!!! The girl that work there tonight was really pathetic! Who goes to a Mexican restaurant and gets NO CHEESE on their carne asada fries?! I told her 1 carne asada fries with no beans then 2 carne asada fries with nacho cheese added to the order and what do I get when I get home and open my orders.... no cheese in my carne asada fries then I call to tell her then she hangs up on me, called back to let the manager know so they can get someone that can hear and understand English when other people order... my kids was very upset and disappointed!"}
{"text":"Last time I ate at Roberto's was over a year ago, had the carne asada burrito and threw up half way eating it."}
{"text":"Everyone is always nice. Quick service and never and bad meal. Fresh food and definitely under budget. Will return over robertos or any other chain"}
{"text":"They added Chicken and Shrimp Fajitas- Really good, very fresh.  Large portion, enough for 2 meals. I've eaten here a few times now and everything has been very good."}
{"text":"WTF?  Today i ordered by phone for pick up because that was easiest for us.  That's how we do at Robertos.    Maybe there's a language barrier between me and the lady taking my order but I really think they should learn their menu in English before taking orders by phone.  Or maybe they got lost in translation between the lady who took the order and the person who put our order together.  I don't know!!

I ordered Carne Asada fries NO BEANS!!   And plain Nachos with cheese.  First of all, the Carne asada fries clearly had beans.  Omfg the nachos were a joke.  I will post a pic, so refer to that.  It's tortilla chips and it looked like they just melted shredded cheddar cheese on top.  The cheese was really hard.  Really???  Mexican restaurant with no real nacho cheese?  They had to melt shredded cheddar cheese which hardened by the time we got home.  

back to Robertos we go.  What a waste of space in southern highlands."}
{"text":"I was at Lake Mead & Rancho and stopped into the gas station that this Roberto's is at and got a chicken Burrito $3.37 wt tax = AWESOME & fast. In South Beach that same Burrito would sell for $9. Just one more reason to be glad I moved outta that place!!

The guy who made it, in his haste to put out fast, did wrap some of the paper into the shell but whatever, it came out. The chicken was plentifull and very moist & delicious. The next time I will have to go wt a supreme wt sour cream & cheese. 

I'm glad there is not a shop close to me bcuz I can see me going there several times a week. Good stuff!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking something fast and good these's the place to go also is few block from my home , is clean , tacos al Pastor are great!!!"}
{"text":"The tacos and the burritos were top notch. Both soda machine and the Agua Fresca machine were not working but still they sold us drinks. I don't understand that but since the food was so good I give the place 4 stars. 

They have Carne Asada fries. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ever eating Don Tortaco. Restaurant was empty for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Literally, not one soul eating there except me. 
Flavor shots machine was not working for all the flavors (no lemon) but not a big deal. What got me was the food. It was the most bland Mexican food I've ever had in my life. Even the salsa. I'll probably try it again, but all in all, compared to Roberto's Don Tortaco is sub par."}
{"text":"When I have consumed too many alcoholic beverages and need some grease in my life this is where to go. Everything I've ever gotten here was delicious and they have a glass window so you can watch the cook prepare your food if you want. I'm partial to the Carne asada fries myself and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is fairly clean when you walk in which is a good start. I had a shrimp burrito. It was a little spicy, but it's good heat. The burrito itself was about a 3.5 out of 5. Not the best but still enjoyable. I love squeezing lime and adding salt to it. It helps bring out flavors! I wouldn't recommend it if you can't handle a little spice! The burritos are a big size as well, I think it was heavier than my leg! They have your standard sauces, I got the red one. It's pretty spicy too but delicious! And my favorite part to every Mexican place, all the cucumbers in the world. Just grab a little baggy and load it up! This location is open 24/7 so if you're not feeling like robertos, it's a good option!"}
{"text":"I've  given the drive thru location three chances now. Past two times the food was cold and tasteless. I couldn't even finish it. Tonight I asked the employee to please make sure it was hot. He was very nice about it. But, now the chimichanga is soggy. It's SOAKED in the juice from the shredded chicken. Very unappealing.Service is totally going downhill here. Always hit or miss!"}
{"text":"Clean place to sit down and eat or pick-up. I go here a lot whenever I'm picking up food for my friends at work because they have a drive-thru. The speed is similar whether you use the drive-thru or come in but it's just more convenient to finish getting ready in the car lol. 

Their guacamole is really fresh and they give you a good portion size, it's like 2-3 tbsp. The flour tortillas are also very fresh too! Oh and also when you go through the drive-thru you can ask them to packet up the salsas, cucumbers, jalapeño, or any of the other condiments. 

Highly recommend this place for their fresh food, friendly service, and clean dining area."}
{"text":"Failed to update you on this review. Took me this long after attempting to cook some 2 day old meat we neglected to cook. Cooked it had that odd smell. Than it hit me. It was the smell of the meat of the carne asada fries we had that night.
 I neglected to mention more importantly that I got sick as a dog from eating the meat!!"}
{"text":"Chicken tacos give me the shits but TOTALLY WORTH IT"}
{"text":"From 3/7/15
This Don Tortaco is located in the Sahara Pavilion and is open 24/7. We came here for some nonTex-Mex Mexican and got exactly what we expected. It's a cool little place, with a decent amount of seating. The cool factor about this location is it is a side door adjacent to PT'S pub, so when you're done drinking you can come in here to soak up all the booze you consumed.

I got the number 8 which is the tamale meal, and my boyfriend got the chimichangas. I enjoyed my food, the tamales were great, the beans and rice were tasty. I like the fact that they put cheese on the beans and what I think might be parm to top them off with too. 
The service here is quick, and the staff is friendly. I will come back here for sure to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Lady at the front has no idea what's she's doing, breakfast burritos have a sign that say 2.99! She charged everyone 4.75. I added red sauce charged a 1.50 on the receipt it said extra veggies!.  And the food had me hugging the porcelain God all day."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, his roommate, and I went there last night around 1-2 am because my boyfriend's roommate saw the place on his way home and wanted to try it out.
Right when we got there, my boyfriend and his roommate immediately started joking around about the name and about how catchy it was. We went inside and only saw one guy working. I think he was the only one handling everything, such as cashier, drive-thru, cooking the food, etc. It took him a while to get back to us and get our order but I really think i's because he was the only one handling everything and there was someone in the drive-thru when we got there. Anyhow, he got back to us, my boyfriend and I ordered a chicken chimichanga, and about 10 minutes later, it came out. I should've taken a picture, but it was delicious. What was different was that the tortilla was like deep-fried or something I believe. It was crunchy and the chicken was so soft and moist. Really good food!
The environment was very friendly. The walls are painted bright green, bright orange, and bright yellow which made it much more welcoming. And a plus is that it was not cold in there, the temperature was perfect. (It is always cold in Roberto's and the people working there were always giving us looks like they didn't want to be there and they didn't want us to be there....) Here, though, he seemed to be the only worker, he was working late, and he was still friendly to us.
We really like this place and I'm sure we will definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 stars because  the food is good, for what it is. But the service is horrible. Forget trying to get a specific  order. I.e. extra anything or hold the whatever. I feel like I need to speak  Spanish to order here, and when they don't understand  you they act like it's your fault. Not worth my money or time."}
{"text":"It's one thing to mess up a drive-thru order but when the customer calls to let you know do not be rude. Very poor customer service. It already wasn't a favorite for Mexican food. The items are too greasy and the rice is often dry. Definitely not giving them my business again."}
{"text":"I've finally got a 24hr Mexican grill spot less than a minute drive away from my house  don't get me wrong though, Faustos is super close also, but this place has a drive thru. For the lazy or busy. Like me sometimes 

Upon entering, the place is just as you'd expect a Roberto's taco shop to look like. Literally it looks identical to the Roberto's up Boulder hwy; Nothing special except their tables and chairs got a makeover, and it seems a bit cleaner. 

We opted for the carne asada fries and California burrito because we normally get that at The other Mexican spots and it was just as good. Fries were crispy and carne asada was well cooked. Honestly, this place is not that different and their food and menu are the same. Food tastes good & the portions were really good, too. They have the Horchata, Tamarindo, etc. drink machines so you can refill unlike some other places, but it's not as fresh, so there's your trade off. Still good! 

SO, for late night eats or if you're just craving some Mexican food and you're too lazy to go to Roberto's or Fausto's, old Henderson got a new spot that's open 24/7!"}
{"text":"So happy they just opened this location close by my job! The Carne Asada nachos are amazing, one of my favorite Mexican restaurants! Love how nice the cashier was. Def love going here on my lunch breaks."}
{"text":"We love the tacos but I feel like they changed their guacamole recipe as it is so bland now. Hopefully they fix it! Other than the guacamole, their chicken tacos and carne Asada tacos are addicting!"}
{"text":"One thing that distinguishes this DT from the other locations around town...

Drive Thru! lol

This DT has a freaking drive thru and I love it! Don't expect the usual drive thru spiel when you pull up here though! lol Usually there is a momentary awkward silence, followed by, \"what do you want to eat?\" lol

Otherwise, it is pretty much a standard Don Tortaco. Good solid food, tummy stuffing portions, and all at a very affordable price. This is a newer location on Rainbow, near Warm Springs. You can find it near Cheeburger Cheeburger and just south of the Firestone Auto.

It is what it is...and I like what it is, so I'll be back for more.

Yay! I'm a fan.

4 stars."}
{"text":"This place is right next to my house. I use to go to Roberts but they have no drive thru like they do at dons. My favorite item at this place is the cheese quesadilla."}
{"text":"As far as \"fast\" Mexican food goes Don Tortaco is my favorite in the area. The wait times are longer but that's okay with me since our food is always hot and made when we order it, even the $1 tacos. The only negative about this place and reason for 4 out of 5 is because they seem to be understaffed pretty regularly and the dining area needs to be cleaner."}
{"text":"This wire was in my bacon breakfast burrito!! Do NOT eat at this location !!!
NOBODY was able to speak English when I returned with the wire!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since day 1 of opening. They use to be great. For the past couple of weeks they have become difficult on their coupons. They offer coupons online but when you bring it to this store, there is always an excuse why they won't take it. 50% off any meal for example. Last week they said it was no good. Not sure why....  I clicked on redeem coupon and they said it's not good. I refreshed the page and showed them the EXACT coupon. Then they accepted it.  This time the coupon wouldn't load. The sales rep behind the counter took my phone and persistently clocked on the link over and over and over again. Causing the link to crash.  If you don't want to accept the coupons, DON'T offer them!!"}
{"text":"It's nice that they have a drive thru for when you are on the run but the food is really not worth it. I have stopped there twice now and both times there food just has no flavor. I asked for some green sauce with my meal and they gave me such a small amount it was silly. If you want some tasty Mexican food made by some great people go down the street to Fausto's."}
{"text":"I always get the carne asada plate and its really good. Food is pretty much identical to Robertos, maybe slightly smaller portions. I usually choose this over Robertos because of their fast drive thru. No complaints here, decent Mexican food! 

I can't believe someone said they would choose Taco Bell over this place... I mean c'mon, really? haha No thanks!"}
{"text":"Love Don Tortaco especially the drive thru locations. Food tops Robertos (they always burn their chips!). Anyway this location in particular would get more stars if the guy at drive thru would at least ask if I wanted any sauce or sides. He never ever does. The other locations always do!  Love the Southern Highlands & Blue Diamond locations the best."}
{"text":"Don Tortaco- authentic and fast! I'm giving it five stars because it's open twenty four hours. This location reminds me of several Sunset Blvd locations in Beverly Hills in Cali."}
{"text":"I really despise how you are obliged to rate an establishment with at least one star in order to write a review. Anyways, that is my first rant. 

Second- YELPERS BEWARE OF THIS BUSINESS! We've ordered from this place a couple times, always by drive-thru. Here and there they would mess up our order, and I concur with the other reviews about a sassy lady at the drive-thru window. But being that it is cheap food, we didn't complain.

Last night was the last straw, and the last time we are going to any Don Tortaco. 

Husband ordered, and paid the \"lady\" $30.25. The total was actually $21.25 but he only had a $20 bill and a $10 bill, and he gave the cashier 25 cents so that his change would just be bills. Handed the said lady the cash and the quarter and she closed the door. Of course my husband waited and stared at her. He also noticed that the cashier DID NOT put the money in the drawer, but off to the side. So he waited, and then the cashier opened the window and asked if he needed anything else. Husband responds, \"yeah I need my change, $9. SHe then proceeded to state that he shouldn't have any change because according to her, he gave her the exact amount. Again my husband said no, I gave you $30.25, so I need my $9 change. Cashier again said and tried to argue with my husband, until she called someone and this person then counted the money and gave the change to my husband. 

Okay we get it, when people give you more than the total, and then give you change, it's kinda tricky isn't it? But you're a cashier and I'm pretty sure your job is to count the money you're receiving, and then PUT IT IN YOUR DRAWER, NOT set it aside. I can only imagine how many customers this person has done it to. People tend to just grab their food and go, and heck I don't even count my change at times. 

Again, NEVER going back. Get your s*IT together."}
{"text":"They're good for a late night fix, but it's isn't anything out of the ordinary here in Vegas. The food is average as well as the service. It's good, but not great."}
{"text":"We usually love this place! However, our most recent was very upsetting. We went through the drive thru and the man at the speaker asked what we want. I gave him our first item which was nachos. He said \"drive up\" and turned off his microphone. We pulled up to the window and told the girl that we wanted to order more than that and he came around the corner and said very rudely. \" What do you want\" I told him and paid. We got home and began eating our taquitos. Toward the end my husband noticed that his chicken smelled and tasted extremely sour! The smell was just as bad as the taste. We ended up going back and letting them know that it was clearly old and rotten. He said if we can't give back the entire order he would not refund us. He told us not to come back and go to Roberto's from now on."}
{"text":"They take a long ass time and charge for sides when inside the store it's free. We only come here for hangover food when we don't mind the crappy service."}
{"text":"No, just.... no.

I've heard other locals sing the praises of this place for years, but my return to this place was filled with nothing but regret.

'You ordered wrong - you have to try their burritos!\" -- \"not all stores are the same, you have to go to a good one!\" -- \"It's really good if you are drunk!\" -- are just some of the qualifiers I was offered as to why people like this place, but whatever they are currently calling themselves, be it Roberto's, or their increasingly appearing new moniker of \"Don Tortaco\" (believe me, the menu, decor, and food are identical), these places are the lowest common denominator of food.

Last week I caved in to the pressure and decided to try their burritos - as reported, they weren't as wet and revolting as some of their other offerings, decent for the price, but then my wife and I both became violently ill and suffered stomach cramps (and you can imagine the rest) for the rest of the weekend.

Sure, Roberto's/Don Tortaco might be \"great if you're drunk\", but people do a lot of stupid things when they are intoxicated, and that's no reason to recommend these activities on Yelp.

Stay away."}
{"text":"Called to place a catering order.... guys answered and said trays come in two sizes.... I asked what they were, he said he didn't know and he didn't have time to explain it to me, that he was busy!  Wow! Guess you don't want my business! I will never BOTHER them again!"}
{"text":"A Don Tortaco with a drive thru? Sounds great! Unfortunately, this place is terrible. I have been through the drive thru twice. Both times the wait was about 15 minutes. In drive though minutes, that's like, forever +1. This is with zero to Maybe one car ahead of me. The second time i went I was overcharged. They did correct it, but how do you change someone for 2 things when they only  order one thing ??? Do yourself a favor and go to the one down the street near Buffalo."}
{"text":"Excellent, delicious food! Found this establishment while vacationing in Las Vegas. Great little place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Best way to say it.
Robertos with less flavor.
Nachos were great but they over do the beans.
I love they have Az tea for sale. 
Fast service. Smelled great too. Not stinky."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a one, because their customer service sucks and they don't serve their food at good quality. The employees are not the friendliest, and they give off the energy of being annoyed every time I go there. Whenever I order a burrito, it's very loose and not tightly wrapped. I also order the chips and cheese, and they tend to burn it to the point that even the styrofoam melts. It's close to home and it's 24 hours, that's why I go to Don Tortaco. I wish they would improve on their quality of food and customer service."}
{"text":"Whoever the guy is that worked at the drive-thru window TONIGHT at this location needs to be fired. Worst customer service, EVER. First off, he sounded like he hated his job from just how he spoke through the speakers. I asked for  6 rolled tacos with sour cream, guac and cheese. He gave me 3 without the sour cream. I didn't realize I had such a complicated order (rolls eyes). The guy even repeated my order and STILL got it wrong. He grabbed my payment and shut the window on me so fast that I didn't get the chance to let him know he forgot about the sour cream. Then he completely ignored me after I sat in the car hoping to get his attention. 

This isn't the first time this has happened with the SAME a-hole. Take your money a couple buildings down the same complex to Robertos!! They will actually treat you like a paying customer and their food is MUCH tastier anyways."}
{"text":"I'm from socal and had to try this place out from the local rants.  Yes my carne asada burrito was good but it just didn't do justice in the flavor department.  However their condiments was quite on par and I enjoyed the pickled carrots very much...maybe I'll try the carne asada fries next time I drive through."}
{"text":"It's like the fast food version on a taco shop. The food is good and prices are cheap but it's not your good  authentic Mexican food. The service is fast and the customer service is good. You get good portions of food for how cheap it is as well."}
{"text":"I was on a road trip and they delayed me because of bad cow disease.....The food was ok flavor wise, so I won't rate them as low as I Should, but I got a bad burrito and \" MONTEZUMA'S  REVENGE \" to put it nicely. 

  I'm not sure if their normal kitchen practice is not checking their meat, but it delayed my trip and I wouldn't recommend them.  It may be ok ???,but just seems like a quick stop, take your chances kind of place to me. 

I think you have to eat at palace more than once to really tell how good or safe they are. I definitely wouldn't eat there again, unless there is a zombie apocalypse and no where else has power."}
{"text":"I started coming here about two months ago and visited on a weekly basis until just recently. I walked in instead of drive thru this time, and when I came in there were three male workers talking amongst each other behind the register (which was totally fine at the moment since there was no one inside the restaurant nor anyone in the drive thru when I came in). They glanced at me and then continued talking. I politely stood at the register with my wallet out ready to order, but for some reason they kept talking away. Eventually after looking at my watch seeing that 4 minutes had passed I immediately walked out. Never coming back."}
{"text":"While the cashier is moody, the food is awesome. My boyfriend and I ordered so much food. We ordered the taquitos, carne asada fries and some of the best tamales I've had in a while. And I usually don't eat beef tamales. I definitely suggest the fajitas! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've visited this Don Tortaco several times for midnight food runs (they're 24/7). It's your average fast-food Mexican restaurant with everything you would expect: tacos, burritos, carne asada fries, etc.

In the handful of times that I've gone, I've never had any problems. They can be a bit slow at midnight, but I imagine they only have a couple people working, so it's understandable...especially if the line is multiple cars long. 

Overall, if you're craving good, fast Mexican food, Faustos is vastly superior...but they close at 11PM. Well done, Don Tortaco."}
{"text":"After moving here from LA and living there for 30 years I think I have a sense of a good Mexican spot and this place isn't on top of the list but it isn't the worst. I ordered 10 tacos here. A mixture of all the meats they had available. I was surprised it came out to almost $30 and it was on a Tuesday,. Where's the taco Tuesday love, Don? The tacos were pretty big and I understand why they were almost $3 each. But It was difficult to eat because the tortilla kept coming apart. Usually tacos use double tortilla and these were a single tortilla so I just gave up and ate it with a spoon.
 I love their sauce bar filled with 2 different sauces (red and green salsa verde), cucumbers, green onions, limes, raddish onions and jalapenos. My opinion is anyone can make and sell tacos but the thing that will separate yourself from the competition is the house sauce. If you can make a great sauce I will be forever loyal to you. Their sauce was average, nothing that popped in my opinion. I wanted a kick. A sauce that made your eyes wide open when you poured it on your food and take that first bite while nodding your head in agreement that the sauce has taken you hostage to it's flavor. The good thing is that it's open 24 hours, so if I need a hangover remedy at 3 a.m. I know where to go."}
{"text":"Just went through the drive thru for a breakfast burrito and the dude that took my order couldn't be more miserable with his job.   \"What do you want\" \"drive up \" \"4.71\" and threw my burrito at me lol!!!! Damn son.   Awful personal skills and customer service.  I won't be back"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, the service is horrible.  I won't be coming back to this place again.  I asked for a cup of water at the drive thru and they told me no.  Not that it cost something, just no. I would have paid for it for a small amount.  With service like this I'm sure it will be closed soon.  Don't waste your time, go to a place where your business is wanted."}
{"text":"First time here, Carne asada fries are  AWESOME!!!  The quality and quantity is great. Definitely earned a returning customer.  Satisfied!!!"}
{"text":"Like other Yelpers who have reviewed before me, pretty much a replica of Robertos. Same options, same flavor, same prices, only difference is their drive-thru. Small salsa bar inside too. I ordered the #4 two cheese enchiladas and the flavor was severely lacking!!! But the carne asada burrito was delicious, and we also had a torta which was ok to. Open 24/7"}
{"text":"At first I was reluctant to try since it was at a gas station but went for it. For $4 I was very full and very happy with my meal. Ordered the Machaca Torta.... pork with fried egg, guacamole, on the best torta bread. Soo DELICIOUS! 

Open 24/7"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this location since it first opened. The food is fresh, good and at a great price! Yum!"}
{"text":"For being fast food I absolutely love love love Robertos especially on my 3am drunk fast food runs!! 

I usually order there Carne Asada soft tacos there so delicious from the tortilla to the carne to the guacamole to the cilantro everything on it is delicious. If I don't get that I'll get there carne Asada nachos those are sooo freaking delicious!!! And huge huge portions two people can eat 1 order of the nachos that's how big they are.I have never been disappointed when I eat there.

I always take my friends here from outta town after the club or bar and they all agree Robertos is the best fast food place ever!"}
{"text":"I love the carne asada or the chicken nachos!

Great price and a whole lot of food!"}
{"text":"Meat is not seasoned do not waste your time at this location others are better. I ordered the carne asada fries it was very bland no flavor at all"}
{"text":"This Roberto's s pretty much the same as all other Roberto's.  But, they have free hot carrots, radish, and cucumber at their salsa bar.  Yum!

$2.50 will get you a bean and cheese burrito that will fill you up.  For Vegas, that is an excellent value.  If you're in the area, try it."}
{"text":"*Breakfast burrito w/bacon & sausage. 
*Bean and cheese burrito. 
*Three rolled tacos w/guacamole& cheese.

I will order one of the three things from any given Don Tortaco around town, usually when I'm
drunk on my way home or when I wake up feeling like death from drinking the night before. There is something special about this particular location though. Maybe it's the fact that they're always consistent, they are close to my house or that they made this super yummy green chili salsa at the salsa bar that I haven't ever seen at any other location. Either way, I love this place. 

My only gripe would be the employees aren't the most friendly. But the drive through access allows me over look that. lol"}
{"text":"I love a Mexican food place with no pretenses and a $3 set of taquitos. I was starved before my nail appointment at Polished next door, so I stopped in for a quick bite. I ordered the taquitos with the guacamole topping them, and let me tell you, that guacamole might have had some crack cocaine in it because it was so good. It wasn't like traditional guacamoles--a touch more spice and I might even venture to call it an avocado dip vs. a guacamole. But I still liked it. 

I also liked their little drink machine. I had some kind of Hawaiian Punch magical red drink that I adored, despite its sugar and red-40 contents. I don't know if I would return based on its distance from where I live, but it is 24 hours and has a easy breezy simple vibe that is great for food emergencies such as this."}
{"text":"Came here to just try it out, but then their food just blew me away! The service is way better then Roberto's the workers actually serve with a smile! The drive through is really convenient. Awesome experience overall and I would defiantly come back again!"}
{"text":"It's by my house I thought better than McDonald's, well no drive thru line ok got my order all wrong when I got home I noticed the quesadilla I ordered with chicken did not have chicken so I called and no one answered for like a hour, my husband had to drive back over to restaurant"}
{"text":"My family's favorite fast food Mexican spot in Henderson - better than Fausto's and Roberto's! The service is great for dine-in, but expect a little longer wait in the drive thru (compared to Taco Bell/Del Taco). The wait is worth it! Favorites include the #14-Carnitas Plate, the #17-Camarones A La Diabla (spicy   shrimp), and the Chicken Tacos. My Dad swears their carnitas taste like the traditional Mexican spots all over L.A.. I love hot spice of the shrimp, and the hubby devours the chicken tacos doused with their Green Salsa (medium spice).  They also serve dishes for the little ones: cheese enchiladas, bean & cheese burritos which is a huge plus for a busy family. 

I had to take a Star back because a couple times their Red Salsa was inconsistent in spice level, but it's still delicious!"}
{"text":"Cheap, but not even a bit authentic 
You can taste the greed of whatever corporation owns this tasteless chain.
Any buffet at any casino slopes out, better grinds than this generic spot.
Compared to this place, Roberto's tastes like the president of Mexico's, own grandmothers handmade recipes!
Avoid at all costs..,,"}
{"text":"I won't say much about how many times I had to repeat my order.  I can understand why that might happen.  

What is absolutely unacceptable to me is the horrific lack of customer service by the guy at the drive thru.  I've gone here a few times when he was working the window, and every single time he acts like a total (a) hole.  Tonight was the worst.  I truly have never come across someone so openly angry about doing his job.  I felt extremely uncomfortable bothering him by being a customer. 

If the owner of this store reads these reviews, please look at who was working the drive thru at 10pm tonight.  Someone needs to retrain him in appropriate and acceptable customer service, because I promise my family will never visit this location again if he does that to us one more time."}
{"text":"After a long weekend, there's nothing like hitting the taco shop for a quick treat.  Roberto's is no different.  This one is close to my neighborhood so I frequent it quite often.  Those of you who go to Roberto's know that a lot of em aren't that clean, and this one is getting there.  But right now it's not so bad.  

Not-the-cleanest-place-in-the-world aside....this place has GREAT food!  Our fav is the nachos with carne asada.  They take a plate of tortilla chips, smother it with cheddar and Mexican queso then put a HUGE serving of steak on top.  It also gets the guacamole and sour cream treatment.  So amazingly ONO!  Too bad it's a bit greasy...and they tend to not give you enough chips.  The ratio of meat and cheese to chips is a little off....like only 1 layer of chips for 4 layers of chees and meat.  No matter though when you're hungry and it tastes good.  And it only sets you back about $6, and can feed at least 2 folks.

Another one of my favs are the tortas, sort of a Mexican sandwich if you will.  You can choose to put shredded chicken or beef, carne asada, machaca, or carnitas in them.  The chicken and beef ones are $3, and the carne asada and carnitas ones are $3.95.  Anyway, the meat goes on one of their oval shaped Mexican buns (which is grilled to make it crispy) and gets the fixings of some lettuce, guacamole, and salsa.  They're pretty good, but watch out because the meat can be hot!  I nearly burned myself the last time.

They also got a lot of different combo platters as well, all ranging from the $4 - $7 range.  They have tacos (the shell makes em great), enchilada, burritos, rolled tacos (taquitos to you), all kinds of stuff.  Their big attraction is their salsa bar though.  They got your basic mild green tomatillo salsa, and their hot red salsa.  Don't get them mixed up on your first visit like I did years ago!  Red is HOT, no Pico Di Gallo!  Both go with your food quite well.  They also have pickled carrots & onions on the bar (so nice), along with fresh cucumbers, green onions(still uncut on the stalk!), and cut limes.  The gf's kids love the Mexican drinks on tap with unlimited refills if you eat in: Horchata (their fav-it's like Cinnamon Milk), Tamarindo (tamarind), Pina (almost like pina colada), and Jamaica (tastes like Jamaicans, just kidding!  it's actually Hibiscus tea).  The drinks compliment your food in a way you wouldn't think it could.  

Most Roberto's are open 24 hours a day (could be the reason why a lot of em are surrounded by bulletproof glass at the counter-keep off robbers) and they serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Their breakfast burritos are killer!    The service may not be greatest or the quickest (sometimes the person taking your order doesn't know much English) but that's no problem.  Just say EXACTLY what you want from the menu the way it's listed on there.  The people at the one I go to are nice and courteous and treat us like regulars (well...because we are I guess).  

Don't forget to check your mail for the Valpak envelope, there's almost ALWAYS a coupon for Roberto's.  The last one I got had a beef taco for $1, and 5 rolled tacos (with tons of cheese and guacamole on top) and a 20 oz. soda for $5.50.  Very good for the price.  So the next time you get a craving for some fast Mexican, forget Taco Bell and go for some Roberto's!"}
{"text":"Ok, now granted, it's been two years, but the reason I'm doing this review is more for myself than anything...  I'm trying to organize all my favorite eating places, and by reviewing them, I have a place where I can log-in to remember them.

What I can offer, although it HAS been a while, is that the Tortas were always VERY good.

My ex-girlfriend turned me onto them, and I discovered how hard it is to find good tortas (Mexican sandwich - basically pita bread, asada, rice, onions...).

The tortas here are very good, even for a low rent food joint like Robertos. 

It's cheap eating at it's best.

Even though in Vegas you have a multitude of options, this is a place where you can get good mexican tortas, for quite cheap.

It was always our place to go, when we wanted to eat off the strip (get in and get out).

Hope this helps."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great customer service & good food. The steak quesadilla is huuuuuge and it comes with sour cream and guacamole. Def my fav.."}
{"text":"It seems like Roberto owns most of Las Vegas, being that there are over 80 or so locations of his taco shop all within a 15-mile radius. It's perfect, because wherever you are, and whatever time it is, Roberto's is open and ready to serve your drunk ass full of lip-smacking good Mexican food.  And it still tastes amazing when you're hungover, or completely sober. 

I find myself constantly craving their carnitas tacos.  Wow, did I just drool as I typed that?

Must try:
Carnitas Tacos- tender, salty, and juicy shredded pork, cheese, guacamole, hot corn tortillas... I think I need one STAT.

Carne asada fries-  Oh yes, they went there.

Honorable Mention: Breakfast burrito with bacon

Any location will do just fine.  Just wish they had one in LA.  Is that too much to ask for?  They're open 24 hours a day, and most shops also have a drive-thru. It's fast, cheap and soooooooo good.

Note: Anyone who says they've gotten sick from Roberto's probably got alcohol poisoning.... not food poisoning."}
{"text":"I was in town for my birthday and I happened to have family members that lives in Vegas. They wanted pizza and surprisingly I didn't want that. My mother and I saw this amazing place and decided to try it. I hate guacamole with a passion! I order carne fries and it had guacamole on it. Omg I tried and was in heaven!!!!!! That was the best guacamole I've EVER had. When I come back in town I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Asked for some Tapatio, she said 95 cents extra.  Fine, never going back to this one."}
{"text":"We buy here a lot cuz we love their burritos. But yesterday July 20th around 5pm, they served us VERY SALTY adobada. I'm not sure if they don't have premade meat or what. But ny husband told me, maybe the cook was in a hurry and he accidentally put a lot of salt in it cuz he's by himself. I don't know but I am very disappointed. Too salty!!! Like exaggerated saltiness. We can't bring it back no more because we got it to go. But I'm giving 2 stars because of the previous good burritos. Less 3 stars for the inconsistency of the taste."}
{"text":"I'm having a hard time coming up with anything good to say about this faux Mexican-food joint. 

The meat is shredded and then cooked so much that it turns dry, chewy, and clumped together. It was virtually inedible and I had a very difficult time managing to get three of my eight taco's down. Wait, these should not be called tacos. Tacos do NOT feature deep fried shells, hand-fulls of cheese, half-a-head of lettuce, and meat products resembling dog droppings. Needless to say, I didn't finish my food.

It has \"Taco\" in the name but what they make are not tacos, rather something resembling food i would only reserve for my worst enemy. 

You couldn't pay me to return. I can't fathom how this place is part of a chain. Then again it's open late and probably gets most of its business from the drunk crowd. Steer clear if you're looking for a descent meal."}
{"text":"Used to really love this place as it was our go-to every Friday night. The last 2 Friday's we get home & our order is all wrong! Switching to Roberto's next week!!"}
{"text":"In love with this place and everything I've eaten there. Green salsa is AMAZING! Breakfast burritos are top notch. Lunch and dinner are just as good."}
{"text":"I have been patronizing this business for 3 years. (I deleted first review, this is an update 12/27/17 ) Our family members go there about 3x a week.   The one man who comes to the drive thru is rude and when he incorrectly charges you he tells you too bad or leave. When the menu board says an item is $2.70 and then it rings up at $3.40 I have a problem with that. Take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 breakfast burritos w/sausage, they were good. Not to long of a wait, just a short wait but what do u expect from fresh food you gotta wait for it. But there was not another person in line. Placed my order pretty fast and waited a few and left. Service was nice."}
{"text":"Thank you for the diarrhea Don Tortacos!

Basically, we came here after JF and I ordered the carne asada fries. The price was the same as everywhere and the actually plate wasnt lovely nor was it delectable. I hate the carne asada here! It was over cooked and no bueno! Customer service was decent, and they have a little salsa bar.

The next morning I wanted to die. It was horrid.

No Mas Tortacos!"}
{"text":"Were it not for my insatiable craving for carne asada fries, I would have never ventured over to this \"local\" side of Sahara Avenue.  This Roberto's is located right next door to PT's Pub, and I mean RIGHT NEXT DOOR.  Like, they share the same door and same wall.  So, as you're sitting in the tiny restaurant of Roberto's, enjoying your food, you'll definitely feel the bass of hip hop music bumping next door.  Or, if you're lucky enough, you'll be able to listen to every word of a horrible rendition of Babyface's \"Everytime I Close My Eyes\" during karaoke nights.

So, how were the carne asada fries, you ask?  For $7.10, I thought they were on the pricey side.  They weren't as good as you'll find in San Diego, but good enough to whet my palate until I visit SD again.  The SO had them for the very first time and was intrigued with the whole french fries thing.  I didn't care too much for the huge dollops of sour cream and I thought the fries could have been served hotter.

What was annoying about the service was that the guys behind the counter were working at the pace of snails.  And while people were waiting in line to order, the cashier was just chatting on his cell phone.  How rude!"}
{"text":"Please can anyone explain me why they are like ignorants over there? Every time I go there , they are just so rude and bogus. And 80% of the time I get what I did not ordered.. terrible service
AND the food is cheated 
This is my 2nd review about those guys...
People BEWARE"}
{"text":"Why are you using LATEX GLOVES to prepare food!? It is unsafe for people with latex allergies and the fact that you don't tell people or act confused when people ask what kind of gloves you use is ridiculous. STOP USING THOSE GLOVES you are increasing the risk of sensitization to latex for your workers. You can use plastic gloves or nitrile!!!!"}
{"text":"STOP USING LATEX GLOVES! It puts people at risk including your workers!!! By not telling people you put people who are allergic to latex at risk there are safe gloves for food prep such as plastic or nitrile!!!!!! I'm going to Roberto's from now on they use nitrile"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the staff is friendly. I've eaten here before and wouldn't hesitate to eat here again.
It was good going in, let's just hope on it's way out I don't experience, as another Yelper phrased it \"Montezuma's Revenge\". Lol :-D"}
{"text":"I always order the California Burrito without pico. The carne asana in the burrito tastes a bit dry sometimes but overall it is usually very yummy. 

Also, the service is great. One particular time my friends & I came here after the club & one of the workers gave us a free drink & free chips because one of the girls in our group was borderline puking & looked like she was going to pass out.

Because this place is 24 hours, has friendly staff, cheap & affordable, & gives huge portions, I give it 5-stars!"}
{"text":"Terrible food and even worse customer service! Will not be coming here again. I ordered the carne asada plate & the meat was cold. I was in the drive thru line & I asked for a little big of carrots and they said I had to come inside to get it. What a joke."}
{"text":"This is located attaching to PT's Pub. As many have voiced it is better drunk. Most of the time the beans are way too runny the meat is flavorless and its just bad mexican food. Ive had it at fairs and at several locations it is just bad juju"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food. Not the healthiest of menus, however this place has great customer service and the food. I really love the chicken tacos and they shockingly have great wings and fabulous ranch. 

They also have amazing breakfast burritos. For a chain restaurant this place is A Okay in my book!!!"}
{"text":"Nope! Go to robertos! Rude food sucks...no thanks..nothing close to robertos! The guy was rude and the restaurant was warm!!"}
{"text":"I came here today at around 7:30 am for a quick breakfast.

I ordered a carne asada burrito, which came out awesome. The meat was pretty juicy and the burrito definitely wasn't lacking any ingredients. I ate half and saved the rest for lunch.

I asked them to deep fry some green onions for me, which he did. They were great side dishes along with the pickled carrots, onions, and jalapenos. The red sauce was also good.

However, I only gave them 3 stars for three reasons. One, when I showed the cashier my 10% off card, he said he didn't know how to do it. I told him to just take 10% off my bill, but he just said the same thing. I just said whatever. I would have only saved 57 cents.

Two. There is no bathroom in the place! I mean, it is pretty small, but since there are seats and tables available for eat-in customers, I don't understand why there wouldn't be a bathroom. It's an essential in a Mexican restaurant.

And three: there were no plastic utensils at the condiment area. I'm not sure if I needed to ask for them, but in other locations they have them ready for you. I had to attack the entire burrito and stop halfway to save the rest for lunch. A knife would've been helpful in this case.

But otherwise, the food was just as I expected of a Don Tortaco's. I'll come back, but only if I really need to."}
{"text":"Great Mexican fast food served fresh anytime you want, day or night.

Location is inside a gas station along with a couple other food vendors. I'm usually here after a long night out with friends or just need to satisfy my craving for Mexican food since it's near the house. My usual is either their Chicken Chimichanga, Carne Asada Nachos, or Carne Asada Burrito. Never had a problem with waiting for food or their lack of fresh quality.

The staff during the night is real fun to talk to. Since I'm known to come in with a slight hangover, we enjoy joking around with one another when they aren't busy cooking. I'll take this place over Robert O's anyday."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to the establishment. My first visit I ordered a special they were running; carne asada & shrimp burrito. It was delicious! It was the unexpected surprise that every diner wants to have when they take a risk on a new special!!! $8.95 +tax is bit much for just a burrito though. I understand it may be because of the size but let's be realistic cut the size down and make the price more reasonable. 

My second visit had me quite excited to try something I hadn't had. Since the first trial went so well I had hoped the second would go just as smooth. I ordered an adobada plate. Maybe I should've stuck to what I already knew. To say I was disappointed would be putting it mildly. The adobada was burnt and full of fat. It would've been seemingly edible had there been any pieces of meat that weren't charred or full of fat. The beans tasted as though they were from the can. The rice was disgusting and not just because it was cold but because it was tasteless and bland. The lettuce was about the only thing that was consumed in its entirety.

What a disappointment. I would have given them 1 star but because my first experience was well I decided to give them another star."}
{"text":"Let's start this off with the fact that good ol Don Tortaco is walking distance from my house. I need to state that to explain why I frequent the place so much when I'm too lazy to go further. 

That being said, there is nothing about this place that particular stands out as a noteworthy. I mean, don't get me wrong... The food is good. But that's just it... It's good. Not great. Not amazing. No orgasmic. It's good. The stuff falls under the same ranking. For the most part, they're pretty all right. I mean I've had moments with some of them getting an attitude if my order is particular, but for the most part they're alright.  

I wish I had better things to say, but it is probably exactly what you would expect from the outside looking in. It's a step above Taco Bell at the end of the day. Wait... Prices are good though. I can say that at least. If nothing else, the price is right?

Take this, and do what you will."}
{"text":"Place was very clean. Service was friendly, Food was very good. The breakfast burritos are very good.   
My mistake there is a location at 1 block north on Rainbow and 215. I thought this one was it."}
{"text":"Most discussing generic Mexican food chain ever!!!!!! Food has no flavor. Service sucks! Lady at the counter was rude. Never never eat here"}
{"text":"Years ago Roberto's used to be the place for fast food semi authentic Mexican food. This place was a favorite in college to get full quickly. Now it seems they have lost some of their luster and is not as flavorful as I once remembered. I still come for the Carnitas, Carne Asada Burritos and some times the Chicken Tacos. As a night owl I like that they are open 24 hrs!"}
{"text":"Late night, and you've got to get a Mexican food fix? Roberto's Taco Shop is your best bet.

Haven't been to one since I moved from this area over seven years ago. I would, daresay, Roberto's has gotten more commercial with their shop design and uniforms, and it's gotten cleaner... but the food has not been sacrificed in the commercialization.

Ordered their Machaca (#8) - Boy, is this good. A little too much salt, but a great dish for only $5.35! Flour tortillas were hand-made and home-made, and above average size.

The BEST Mexican fast food I can think of in Las Vegas! Compared to Lindo Michoacan... five stars for sure!

As everyone knows that read my reviews... I love Chile Relleno. Don't think their Chile Relleno is adequate... but their other dishes... Burritos, Carne Asada, Tacos are superb. I'm just very particular about my Chile Relleno."}
{"text":"Not thrilled at all. Had to try but back to Faustos it is. Bland food. Service only plus."}
{"text":"Rolled chicken tacos and Carne asada fries everytime. Drive through, quick fixes at affordable prices."}
{"text":"Love this place.. We come here after work every Tuesday and I'm always so happy and full. Great service, every time we go the guy always takes good care of us. Carnitas nachos are my new favorite!! Green sauce is always on point!"}
{"text":"A perfect copy of Robertos. Good food but Robertos was already in the area, a one minute walk from each other. The only thing different with this place is it has a drive thru which is a plus."}
{"text":"The shredded beef chimichanga was awesome! I will bring my whole family back here. I am so excited to have found this place. They even have chicken nuggets on the menu for those picky toddler eaters."}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews are so negative? Food is good, friendly service, no frills & 24/7.

I always, always get the California Burrito and it's consistently good. Asada, fries, with all the fixins neatly rolled up for your enjoyment, what's not to like? You got the crunchy fries, meaty meat, and cheeeese! The food is always really hot and comes out in a reasonable amount of time. The red & green salsas they have also adds a lot of flavor - only complaint is that the red \"hot\" salsa is not very spicy.  

Price is good and portions are on the large side. However, they do not give you the pickled carrots through the drive-thru, which is a bummer. Overall a great go-to late night Mexican food that's conveniently located for the Mountain's Edge community."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. I was just trying the taco Tuesday today and let me say I should have went to taco Bell over this place! The food was flavorless, no taste what so ever even with salsa they give you. NO FLAVOR. The taco was a lettuce taco not a chicken taco. My kids wouldn't even eat the food from here and they are not picky kids."}
{"text":"I ate here dinner service 4th of July. I ordered Carne Asada. The carne was cooked to perfection in less than 8 minutes. It was juicy and tasty! Applause to the guys who worked that night! I also ordered a large horchata which I was disappointed with due to the powdery substance that hadn't been mixed well. I really wanted a lengua plate, but this small joint didn't serve it. But I still left the place very satisfied."}
{"text":"Will not eat here again. My food was very tasteless IE: not seasoned at all. I also found a toothpick inside one of my taquitos. Not very happy and not returning again. Wish you better luck than me?"}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 stars the first time I came, but that was the only time I've been here that they deserved more than 2 stars. Here's a typical day in the Don Tortaco drive-thru:

\"Can I get a half pint of rice?\"
\"An order of fries?\"
\"No, a half pint of rice, please.\" [Enunciating clearly]
\"Do you want carne asada fries or regular fries?\"
\"No, rice. Arroz.\"
\"Oh you mean RICE.\"

Then the rice is old and stale.

Ask for extra limes, and they'll give you two lime wedges. Ask for sauce, and they'll give you the tiniest sauce cup you've ever seen in your life.

Today was my last visit when I ordered a bean and cheese burrito. When I got to the window, the girl (the only one who works here who's worth anything) said \"Bean burrito, no cheese, right?\" I told her I did want cheese and she told the girl who took my order. Got home and - no cheese. I went back to just get my money back so I could spend it somewhere else and the manager (I believe) was chewing gum in my face. Real professional, lady. Disgusting. I will not be back. They've messed up enough times already.

Side note: I found it pretty fitting that when I went in with my messed up order, another guy was coming in with his messed up order too. They just can't get anything right."}
{"text":"This place is f*ing disgusting. Soggy fries, soggy burritos, soggy tacos, hard rice & dry meat. Disgusting. Only thing good is the juice. Hire new cooks please. If I could give 0 stars I would've..."}
{"text":"Go about 1250 feet south and you'll find a Roberto's that is miles better."}
{"text":"Finally, something that's open 24x7 in the far SE part of Hendertucky! With a drive-thru! Having had a bad experience with Roberto's I avoided this place for months since it opened thinking it was just another Roberto's clone. But in the past 2 weeks we've picked up 5 different orders and while the menu may be similar to their competition, the food is much better. 

Carne Asada nachos. Fausto's up the street is better but not by much. And these nachos can be picked up without leaving your car which puts them ahead of Fausto's. Want carne asada quesadillas? No problem. Chicken tacos and chicken enchiladas? Yes, and unlike the competition they won't be swimming in grease. and actually taste good. 

They have an app / website that you can pull up to see the menu and get coupons. And the drive-thru is sure convenient. When you crave tacos at 3 am, it's nice to have this place close by."}
{"text":"If you like greasy tacos incomplete orders and waxy cheese give this place a try. We were so excited to have a new place open but were quickly disappointed. Trust me just drive half a mile up Horizon and go toFausto's for a much better meal."}
{"text":"I waited for 15 min in the drive thru and when I got home they didn't give me no napkins or plastic ware for my Carne Asada fries. I opened it up and it didn't look appetizing at all...fries were hidden underneath and were super soggy. Just wayyyyy to much meat & looks disgusting."}
{"text":"I honestly have no idea why I always get the worst customer service here. I always tip good and am friendly. This morning at around 4:30 close to 5 I went through drive-thru and ordered two fries with guacamole, pico de gao, and beans. As I went up to the window I gave the cashier my debit card and about 10 mins later I get a notification on my phone from my bank that my card got charged twice. After the long wait, I asked the guy why my card was charged twice and he said \"because I took it off the chip reader too early\" .... ok? So I asked if it charged my card twice as it says on my bank account and he sort of stuttered and said \"I don't know\" mmmm ok. Then to top it all off, I asked if I could get some limes and he said \"you can't get limes through drive thru only red and green sauce\" what?! I just drove off at that point. This guy had tattoo sleeves and was in his 20's I believe. I didn't catch his name as he was really rude and rushing for no reason, it was 4-5 in the morning. Absolutely lazy and does not understand customer service. These type of things have happened to me a lot between this location and the one on Blue Diamond. Please do something about your rude and snarky workers. I do my best to tip more than average and still get the backhand. I think after this I am done with Don and I will not recommend it to anyone like I used to. And honestly, it's majority of your workers but he really put the icing on the cake. Please do something before you lose more customers. I now didn't pay two meals, I paid for four (only getting two)."}
{"text":"I was craving a Bacon Breakfast Burrito this morning and thought I will give Dontortaco a call and pre-order my burrito so I wouldn't have to wait, I mean isn't that what phone ordering is for?  So, I call place my order and the female that answered said my burrito would be ready in 5 minutes - no problem since I am more like 10 minutes away, but this way I am guaranteed my order should be ready and no waiting.  Right ?

Well, when I pulled in front of Dontortaco, there are all these new signs \"Under New Management\".  Ok, I think hope for the best but I didn't think there was anything wrong with the old staff. 

Anyways I walk in and the usual staff is no where to be seen and its all new peeps......I walk up to the counter and the women and man look at me questionably ( I don't see my burrito anywhere on the counter - like I usually do).  I said I am here for my phone order and the women begins to ring my up while the man begins to make my breakfast burrito.. How can this be when I phone ordered it right ?  I asked the women is my order not made and she says \"NO\" at this point I tell them to forget it since my whole point of a phone order is not to wait.   

I walk out with no burrito and still hungry....so much for \"Under New Management\" they SUCK @ !!! 

So don't expect your order to be ready if you phone it in."}
{"text":"So disappointed in the food. The tortillas appeared to be made in house and were the only truly edible part of the meal. I ordered the shrimp plate (probably the most expensive item on the menu) and not a single shrimp was edible as each one was terribly rubbery. The rice and beans were nothing to write home about either. I wouldn't eat there again but I might get an order of \"homemade\" tortillas to go!"}
{"text":"It's actually a Don Tortaco,but same difference. Food is of quality you'd expect from Roberto's.place is clean and fast."}
{"text":"This place is horrible, greasy food, horrible customer service, portions are smaller and smaller, the overall quality is just lacking. 
Update 10/26/2017: I cant believe I cae back, portions are smaller now, this place is complete garbage. Bad service, bad quality, good lord..."}
{"text":"They messed up on our order and had the nerve to try to argue and go back and forth with us saying we didn't say it correctly. We ordered chicken rolled tacos and were handed beef enchiladas. How? Don't argue with the customer when English is something you clearly struggle with... They charged us more for the wrong item and didn't pay us the difference when they finally made the correct lower priced item. Never again."}
{"text":"Look no further. This is your only choice for the best Mexican food in Vegas. I've been to many all over the valley and this location has them all beat!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am a regular customer of Don Tortacos and I prefer the food here vs Robertos. Today I had an awful experience at the drive thru. The usual lady was not there today it was a different lady with a Mohawk and she was very rude. I was scared to ask her if she can give me cucumbers and I finally had the guts to ask and she gave me a negative facial expression. I was going to provide her direct feedback but I think this would be more effective."}
{"text":"This is the second time I ask for vegetarian and get meat in a burrito. I'm actually not a \"real\" vegetarian but prefer not to eat meat. 2 times In 3 months I get meat in my burrito and NO salsa in the to go bag. The employees are usually not friendly and the only reason I go to this place is bc the Robertos literally 1 BLOCK AWAY doesn't have drive thru but seeing as how I get the wrong order I might as well pay the extra dollar around and wait an extra 5 minutes for the right one at Robertos!"}
{"text":"This place was filthy. Girl behind the counter asked me 4 times what my order was after already putting it in. Someone told her that the trash can was full and she said \"OK.\"  No one clearing tables, no one cleaning the trash, the food came out wrong. Just a miserable experience. And it wasn't busy, so no excuse.

I've only ever been to their other location, I'll never come back to this one. Can you imagine what the kitchen looks like if they can't wipe tables?"}
{"text":"Service was about the same speed as the other \"made fresh\" mexican joints in the area.
Handy that it is open 24 hours in case you need a burrito at 3 am.
Drive through is a nice option in case  you have the puppied in the car and do not want to leave them to back in the Nevada heat while fulfilling your burrito cravings.
I had a breakfast burrito, it took a lot of effort to order in the drive through, I figured it was the speaker and mic, but seeing the other review it might just be a communication issue.
It was good, wrapper was not as stale and stiff as Robertos, and the filling was not as tasty and substantial as Faustos.
It as a decent burrito, waaay better than taco bell if you need a drive through."}
{"text":"Food has always been good here they can use a little bit more help when busy I got the number1 to go. The breakfast burrito is good also. Don't understand all the complaints I have never had an issue with wrong order or wrong price. So far I have had the bean tostadas the chicken Taquitos, breakfast burrito , and chicken tacos on Tuesday. la comida es buena."}
{"text":"The new girl and the cook with the glasses and baby beard are the worse team of employees ever !!  This girl gives me the wrong food, I wait an additional 10 minutes for 1 taco, 1!!! Then I get a tortilla and no meat then I get it \"fixed\" with not even an ounce of meat for a carne Asada taco, then I beep again then the guy comes to the window all mad talking bout whats the problem ? She neeeds to get trained #1 and #2 and sucker needs to learn to cook and fix his portions. I would fire them both in a heart beat."}
{"text":"It's somehow impressive how incompetent this location is. I ordered 2 hard shell beef and cheese tacos, carne asada fries with no sour cream and beans, chips/guac and a Mountain Dew. I went through the drive through and waited 10 minutes for my order...and somehow, someway they managed to screw up every single item I ordered. I received a Dr Pepper, Tacos with lettuce and fries with beans. The guacamole was technically correct but was a liquidy mess. I didn't have time to unwrap every single item so I only caught the drink being wrong, but needless to say I am never returning here again."}
{"text":"I realize- You get what you pay for, when it comes to super cheap food let alone 'fast food', but this was just unacceptable for my standards anyway.
I pulled up to through the drive-thru today (a Monday morning 7am) craving a ham breakfast burrito. I know they're 24/7, so I knew they'd be open.
I waited for 2 mins or so then said, \"Hello?\", about 3 times until finally someone said, \"Yea?\". 
I proceeded to order my ham breakfast burrito, then made it clear I would like *NO CHEESE* please... 
He then said ok and as soon I was about to drive off I kid you not I heard him speak Spanish to I'm assuming the cook, detailing my order from what I can understand and saying, \"for this stupid dude/guy\" in Spanish. (Yes I can understand a bit, my fiancé's Mexican lol). To be clear in no way shape or form did I sound ignorant or angry when ordering! 

Fast forward to me waiting 6-7 mins for my burrito WITH NO cheese..right? 
I get my burrito, paid $3-something (they have a daily morning special for breakfast burritos). 
Get to work to eat my burrito and sure enough-
There was A LOT of cheese stuffed in! ..great. 
Just sad because I still ate it, I just have digestive problems when it comes to a lot of cheese, 
but what if I was someone with an allergy? ? 
Oh well. You get what you pay for right? 

Good morning to me.
I won't be back."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in North Las Vegas!! Very friendly staff!! I do feel sorry for the Subway and Cony Island restaurants on the sides because Don TorTaco takes all the customers because the prices are well worth it!! Everything is made fresh right in front of you and is so very delicious!! My favorite is their shrimp burrito and fish tacos!! I'm going to miss that place!!"}
{"text":"Great value for good Mexican food.  I like that it's convenient and ope. 24 hours, the burritos were the highlight for sure, while the nachos were a solid send place.  If you're looking for something a little.off the beaten path, this is a good find."}
{"text":"I LOVE Roberto's!  I can't find the location I would frequent when I lived in Vegas because there are SO many of them, so I'll just write about this one.

They are open 24 hours, 7 days a week and is the spot to go to after a night of partying!  I love their breakfast burritos (with sausage) and their carne asada FRIES -- SO delicious!  ALSO, they have those spicy carrots -- I usually fill up a whole sandwich baggie full of them -- they are so GOOD.  They are the only taqueria that I know of that has huge sliced spears of these spicy carrots and not those wimpy canned bought carrots.  

Roberto's is one of the top reasons why I miss Las Vegas.  And PT's coming in a close second."}
{"text":"I Love this place, same basic food as Roberto's, but a little cheaper.
 Clean, very polite, would have gotten 5 stars but every now again the oi isn't quite hot enough, living a little stale taste in the fried items, which is pretty much what I live on.
 I tip each time, and I get more gaucamole now than ever before! :)"}
{"text":"Went here on my lunch to order a carne Assad's burrito. I work overnight/graveyard and was curious because it is a 24 hr place. Was helped by a young man with some tattooos. Ordered my cranes adada burrito and it was filled with literally crane Assada ONLY No beans or cheese. I know better that they're supposed to put beans in there. Maybe they didn't want to make any not sure but it is a 24 hour place so why wouldn't you have some made already?? Anyways I'll be visiting the one by my house on Decatur and Cactus fuck this one."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and had no problem. It's close to my house but today will be my last visit to this location. 

BEWARE: The guy that takes the orders wears the exact same gloves to run the register, handle money and make the food without changing them. At one point he took off his gloves to make a burrito!!!!! I know his hands were all SWEATY from having those gloves on that long. I see the reviews saying that they're rude here, however, I didn't have that same experience. They're pretty nice but STILL.... you CAN NOT handle money and food without changing your gloves, that is just disgusting and unacceptable. 

I'm a little concerned at how long has the limes, cucumbers, pickled carrots and etc have been sitting out though. The health department should take a surprise trip out here. I have no doubt they've got a lot of health code violations. 

BUT..... if you do decide to come here, maybe you could tell the guy to change his gloves before preparing your food or just pray over your meal In Jesús Name that you don't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"If I could put negative stars, I would. I never had a MAJOR issue with this place in the past, maybe a wrong order here and there but I learned to let it go. I hate complaining, but as a person who works in customer service, I really can't stand when people come to work with a bad attitude!

I went here the other night after work and ordered through the drive thru. I order my usual carne asada fries and as I pulled up to pay, everything seemed fine. The lady working the drive thru was just so unpleasant. She had to reach a little bit harder to grab my card through the window, and she started shaking her head. I even took off my seat belt so I didn't have to make her reach out far. As she handed me my food, I then ask for red and green sauce, and she had the nerve to roll her eyes so far back... I was livid after she did that! As she handed me the sauce, I said to her, \"Are you really going to roll your eyes at me like that?\" And she just walked away from the window. My blood was boiling and I wanted to go inside and complain, but figure that they wouldn't have done much about her attitude. Someone like that should NOT be helping people. What a joke!"}
{"text":"Carne Asada fries beat Robertos, hands down. Loaded with steak and fries are nice and crispy. Service is good too."}
{"text":"I called and tried to get the major cross streets for this restaurant and couldn't be helped due to the lack of English . I was trying to get the 99 cent taco Tuesday deal but was told that since I was 8 minutes late I couldn't get it . So I asked for any deals they had for Wednesday and he told me no even though it says 499 carnitas burritos and a drink every Wednesday  . I decided to go anyway because I was really hungry and it was late . So I found the place on my own. I went through the drivethru and while waiting for the car ahead of me I redeemed the $1 off coupon . I mean at least it's something . So I got to the window and gave the guy my phone so he can see the coupon was redeemed . He looked confused like he didn't know how to put it in next thing I know some random worker comes up to my window and he's talkin to the guy with phone . Scared me half to death . After a minute he looks at me and says I can't use the coupon because it was already redeemed . I TOLD him that I had just redeemed it while waiting in line and that I hadn't used it before . And you know what he told me ? He said that the cashier had to push the button ON MY PHONE with HIS OWN FINGER in order for it to be valid . Apparently whoever is watching them on the cameras has to see the guy with their own eyes to push the damn button on my phone in order to give me a dollar off my tacos . This was a terrible terrible visit and I'm hoping they get a manager or something because I can't believe how ridiculous the workers are in this place ."}
{"text":"Roberto's is my favorite taco joint in Las Vegas.  This is the location we typically go to, but there are locations all over the valley.  Some locations are nicer than others, but the food is consistently tasty.

I normally get the carne asada plate and split it with my boyfriend.  There's usually enough for the both of us to make 4 or 5 tacos from it.  The steak is always flavorful and juicy and it also comes with beans, rice, and lettuce.  The flour tortilla that they give has a great taste to it - I could eat it alone.  We always get the chicken tacos too.  They make the taco shell fresh so its crispy once you get it.  They pile on the cheese too (my favorite part) ;)

I go here often and whole heartedly recommend it if you in the mood for some fast authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"This was my New Year's discovery while in Vegas visiting the rents. 

You would never expect to get such authentic and yummy food from a chain.  I just wish they would open a few in LA.  

Chile Relleno was excellent!"}
{"text":"Ordered 5 rolled tacos. The fact that my guac was brown should of been a sign to throw away. But I was exhausted after work and hungry. So I ate it anyways. 5 hours later I woke up with the worst case of food poisoning . 
Do not eat here!"}
{"text":"Good food! Great prices! And large quantities! What more can you ask for? Drive thru even with quick service."}
{"text":"Had a beef burrito and a chorizo+egg breakfast burrito to go. The beef one was as good as expected and the chorizo+egg one was amazing AF! The red salsa was a mehh but the chorizo burrito was too good to have another flavor added into it.
Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I've come here several times and always get the same things as now I'm addicted to the carne asada nachos and the chicken tacos.  The food is cheap, good and the service is good and quick too.  I love the little carrot and jalapeño bar too"}
{"text":"Great service, great food better than any other Mexican restaurant I've been to.  Their carne asada on the plates aren't too grease, I'm very picky when it come to meat but this one pass my expectation.  Also their condiments looks good and fresh as well. Will definitely come here again...."}
{"text":"The food is decent. But the cashiers are always SO RUDE!! Also if you pay for extra meat in your burrito (3.50 additional) theyll just put the regular amt of meat. The soda machine drinks taste like the staff here never clean out the fountain. I also dont understand why you have to pay for a refill on a horchata if pepes tacos has the horchata machine out for self-serve. I honestly only come here for the carne asada fries and the cashiers refuse to split them for me and my son. He is allergic to guacamole and it would be more convenient for me if they would just split them for me rather than me getting the guac on the side."}
{"text":"This Roberto's is the best Roberto's in Vegas. The lady that works weekdays behind the grill has got to be the patron saint of Mexican Food. 

There seems to be a Roberto's every three blocks in Vegas (which is ok with me) but this one always has fresh food and consistent portions. They always cook fresh.. some Robertos will pull pre-cooked food out of a pan when you order something.

I come here at least three times a week. They have Chicken Nuggets for my son who is going through the \"Peanut butter, Peperoni, Chicken Nugget\" phase of his life.. I hope it is a phase...

It's also super clean. I see them cleaning/recleaning all the time."}
{"text":"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhh....

I'm not a huge fan of Don Tortaco to begin with, but after drinking with some friends that live nearby on Saturday, it sounded SO delicious!

We came up around 5 or 6 on Saturday, and it was completely dead.

The kid taking orders had no idea what he was doing.  I asked what came on the super nachos (which are like...$7 and change), ordered the super nachos with no guac (allergy) and no meat.  Somehow I got charged $8 and change for the \"asada nachos\" which is not what I ordered.

Fella ordered some kind of carne asada sandwich, and a rolled taco...the kid charged us extra for cheese and beans when we didn't want extra, we wanted only cheese and beans on the taco...so...for 3 tiny items, we paid $19.  

The food was not that great at all.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night and wanted to give a quick review.

The restaurant was clean and bright. The staff were all neatly dressed in uniforms and the service was very good. The food was made quickly and I was in and out in under 5 minutes.

I ordered a California Burrito to go. The burrito was very good IMO, better than average. The Carne Asada was tender and well seasoned with no fatty, chewy or gristle pieces found- pretty high quality meat and well prepared. The meat to potato ratio in the burrito was good. It wasn't all french fries like some other places I won't mention (cough-DelTaco-cough) I added some Salsa Verde from the condiment bar which was good as well, mild and tasty.

The burrito with tax was under $6- a great value for a filling high quality burrito with plenty of meat. Probably weighed in at a little over a pound in my estimation. 

I'll definitely be back to try the tacos and more."}
{"text":"4:15 am

On our way home from the ER and we were starving. Don Tortaco to the rescue! 24 hour authentic, hot Mexican food that doesn't break the bank. It was amazing and this location has a drive thru!! We crawled into bed with full bellies this morning. I will most definitely be going back here."}
{"text":"By far the worst don taco place i been to never will  i ever go back to this place so lets start where  the fd up
#1 i ordered  carne asada fries and extra meat and cheese  what i got was not extra meat and no extra cheese i opened  the box to only see only a handful of food i can littearly  hold the fries i got  in one hand very disappointing i ended up giving  food  to dog 
#2 there slasa was so watered  down just  disgusting never will go back to these  place  again inside was dirty one counter  guy and a line full cars so they rush to make ur food 
Se pasan de verga"}
{"text":"Absolutely love coming here for there rolled tacos and their bacon breakfast burritos. And between 6am and 11am the breakfast burritos are 2.99 which really nice for the weekends so that I may need my family for under 10 bucks."}
{"text":"I ordered a Carne Asada burrito and it was full of cubed boiled meat, not the fried steak. Yuck! What a bland gross mess."}
{"text":"Service is slow, food is mediocre. Burritos only come with meat. Rice is extra beans are extra. 
There is now 3 locations opened on blue diamond. 
Cashier taking drive thru orders was very friendly and speaks perfect English."}
{"text":"I stopped by because I was on a rush, I ordered a California burrito, asada meat, pico de gallo, French fries and cheese.  It wasn't bad, I ate it, but definitely not the best Carne asada burrito, probably won't be eating here again soon."}
{"text":"Best taco I've had in a while! Messy but delicious! Totally worth spilling on my jeans. Chicken taco!"}
{"text":"Okay first off the food was not good.. it was my first time trying this and PLUS THEY charged my account twice.. had to call them a couple of times because they wouldn't give back my money literally took almost a month.. I honestly wouldn't try this place if I were you guys.. your better off making your own"}
{"text":"It's quick and cheap but it's also tasteless. I got the carne asada taco and the 3 rolled chicken tacos with guac. How can something this bland be called Mexican. The rolled tacos were worse than the frozen ones you get in the supermarket. Totally tasteless. I'll go to Taco Bell right next door next time!"}
{"text":"Came here around 10pm drive thru and everything was great! Ordered the 5taquitos special and I loveeed it ! Hubby ordered a carne Asada burrito and enjoyed it. The cashier could of been a little happier but the food was delicious and that's all I care about lol plus the green salsa is bomb now! Last time I came a few months back it wasn't the best. I'll definitely be back sooner than later"}
{"text":"4:06 am Las Vegas food is sooo good!
#10 carnitas plate mmmmm
Carne asada taco mmmmm
Fresh and fast food!"}
{"text":"Not the first time here but probably one of the last. 

Supposed to be comparable to Roberto's but I think a step down for sure. 

Ordered two chicken tacos, they were both burnt to a crisp. I could hardly eat them with how hard the shells were. 

Ordered a Carne Asada burrito for my girlfriend and she liked it. 

Chili Relleno I ordered for my mom was subpar at best as well.

Spent $21.00 on a few items and disappointed with most. 

I wouldn't really recommend this place. Mehhh."}
{"text":"I have kind of gotten hooked on the place, and the workers all know me by name now. I'm here at least once a week if not 2 or 3 times. Love their chile rellanos & chile rellano burritos. Their carne asada chimichangas are perfect and my roommate loves the carne asada burritos. Their ben & chez (bean & cheese) burritos are huge and filling and like $2.50. Love their red hot sauce & the carrot/onion mix and radishes. Occasionally you get some tough meat, but the majority of the time it is super tender and flavorful.

Wish YELP would finally update their records with the new (its only been Don Tortaco for like a year +) name."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Today I went to order and was waiting for someone to take my order and another guy comes up behind me and the girl on the other side of the counter took his order first and then ask me if I was ready to order. WTF!! I told her I was ready to order when I was standing there. Then she laughs at me and starts speaking Spanish to the cook and the guy who came in after me. They all start laughing. I will not be coming back to this place nor will I recommend it to anyone who asks."}
{"text":"There's no reason to go to a knock-off Roberto's that does everything half as well, when there's an actual Roberto's like 500 feet away. How is this place even still in business?"}
{"text":"We popped in late one night and it felt like a truckers stop. I mean it is...but it was busy in there!

The food was still as good as I know Don tortaco to be, but wholly goodness did 2 taco salads take FOREVER. It was late, we just came from the airport, hungry that I damn near wanted to go back there and make that stuff myself. As busy as it was, I only saw one guy working the back and then the 1 lady working the front.  Although the cashier was seemingly nice, I felt like my mood and time of night needed to hear thank you for waiting. 

None-the-less, there must be a reason there were only 2 workers and it being pretty busy was a fluke...or not. They did their best since we didn't wait for an hour for 2 taco salads...so I'm looking at it from the bright side.
Food quality was still good and my taco salad still tasted good. So mission complete.

I'd recommend going to the Craig location IF possible as it feels more family friendly since this location is connected to a gas station and transients cruising around. Or you can opt for the ither joint with a pink rooftop if you know whst i mean. Other than that, it was actually waaaay cleaner than I expected. Three stars because it wasn't like I was getting anything spectacular and the wait made it even more questionable in worth.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I would go here above any other fast food taco shop in my area.  I simply don't understand why people would subject themselves to Taco Bell over this place.  The chicken burrito is ridiculously huge, cheap and all you need for lunch.  I guess you could take some of the bags of hot sauce from TB over here if you wanted to be all extreme about it :P  I also like the carne asada burrito.  Huge. Ghetto.  Cheap.  Filling."}
{"text":"Roberto's is our first stop directly from airport every time we come into town! ....and almost daily there after.
 Best Carne Asada Burritos ever!
Would love to bring home a suitcase full of them back home to Seattle! Have yet to find a place at home that makes them this good!"}
{"text":"I was in need of a quick lunch so I was like what the hell.

They had a special for Tacos de Lengua.  I personally have never had Lengua, but I figured other people eat it must be okay.  I just had to get over the fact that it is tongue.

Anyways - the tongue tacos were muy bueno.  I am now a fan of tacos de lengua.  

This place is pretty much a Roberto's - maybe a little cheaper.  Over all - the place was not the cleanest place.  It was a little suspect even.

It's fast and it's cheap.  the food was decent.  I would say - stop by in a pinch, but I wouldn't go out of the way to eat here."}
{"text":"Really like their sausage breakfast burrito and nachos.  My husband loves their carne asada nachos.  Good service, good food, reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"Love going here late night. Great service. I've been going here for the past 6 years whenever I have a late night craving. Friendly customer service.

I enjoy carne asada fries the most from here. I have tried other menu items and they are good as well."}
{"text":"Fast service. Carne Asada fries were delicious, meat tasted like steak and not that mushy stuff, onions tasted fresh, guacamole was put generou. Clean restaurant. Condiment bar fully stocked. I mean how long does a review really need to be? I think people should be more concise."}
{"text":"Tried it once, I'm going back to Roberto's right around the corner.  Apparently going through the drive-thru at 3PM really pisses off the young lady working the window.  The only verbal communication from the cashier was to tell me how much I owed - No greeting and no goodbye from the staff.  I'll gladly take my business elsewhere since my patronage is not appreciated here."}
{"text":"Use to love his place I'd drive across town for this place untill they got new management freakin charged me $26 for 3 burritos with no meat. I get beans cheese rice avo sour cream and French fries. Why do good things have to change ?? The original burrito I get is $2 and some change why did they start my burrito off at $5.75? Don Tortaco is going to lose some very loyal customers. While I was there an old lady said she had been coming there for 8 years and was mad that she had to wait 15 minutes befor being told they ran out of her order. They are messing up everything in there."}
{"text":"Really goood. Better than Roberto's.... really tasty fast and worth the trip. Definitely going beck. beware the pico I'd hot (how I like it)"}
{"text":"Let's face it. You didn't seek this place out because you heard that it was the best place in Vegas for Mexican food. You came here because it was close to something else you were doing and you were hungry. I ordered a carne Assad torta and it was cheap and tough. $3.75 got me chewy, tough bread and gristly, tough carne that was chopped so fine it fell out of my bun like a dry sloppy joe. The restaurant seats 12 and if you order something, you get access to the restroom with the \"out of order\" sign out front. This is where you eat out of convenience and not necessity, I knew that and wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"My first time here today so maybe this is a bad day.  But, I had to clean my own table to sit and my tacos (and meat) were to hard to eat. The beans, cheese, and lettuce were good so I ate them. The employees were super nice though"}
{"text":"This is my Mexican food go to spot when I'm in the area, I love the tortas and burritos."}
{"text":"Honestly if I could give this place zero stars I would. I ordered some food from them chicken taquitos and they were frozen in the inside. After one, I started throwing up!! When I called back the lady told me it was because I took 30 minutes to pick up when it didn't. When I called back she proceeded to argue with me instead of us finding a solution. She was very rude and nasty and this place should be closed down. It's NASTY!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for fresh and delicious Mexican food! Burritos here are awesome and not to mention the nachos. The restaurant itself is very small but the staff is very friendly and the food comes up fast, also they are open 24/7."}
{"text":"I work in the area and although have driven past many times I had never noticed this taco shop. Today while at work a few coworkers and I were wanting to pick up some grub for lunch so a friend suggested Don Tortacos. The best idea of the day was calling in an order which was promptly prepared for us. The services is great and their food looks and taste impressive. The items ordered were carne asada fries, hard shell carnitas tacos and a carne asada burrito.

My burrito was Amazeballs, I swear it must have had at least two pounds of carne asada meat stuffed in it. I like my meat, I can handle my meat however this seemed a bit of a challenge for the first time in my life. 

This burrito was so good it made me horny. I was stimulated, I was aroused, I was wanting it over and over this day. I made love to my burrito with every flavorful bite and swallow. 

I will be back for sure, as I want to try other things on their menu that look irresistible. 

Food price is reasonable, friendly staff, a great salsa bar with those yummy spicy carrots and green salsa.

I will be back for sure as it has left me yearning for more! I am a dirty little whore for this place."}
{"text":"Damn.  Somebody shut this place down!  IT's a farce. It is TERRIBLE!
This is BAD food!    THe cheese enchilada was a tortilla with grated cheese in it and it wasn't even melted...just grate cheese.  I cut into the beef burrito and water poured out.  It was like boiled beef and green pepper sin there.  THe refied beans had no flavor and the rice had not flavor or color. ZERO flavor .  I havd chips and quac n chees too. Again, the chees was just grated cheese thrown on top.  the guac was 5 out of 10.  I asked the boss if he ever ate here- he said every day- I sad this food is horrible. Could I plese get a refund of some sort since I only took 5 bites.  He said no...he had never heard any complaints-  Just look online at the stellar reviews- he siad.  Well, I see it has 3 stars.   I should have checked online BEFORE going there.  Still  Resturants usually give you a refund if you complain and don't actually eat the food. I demanded my $2 tip back though.... $2   I gave him AHEAD of time in the hope of getting a little special attention.  The food took about 2 minutes to make so I guess that was the special part.  I'm so mad at this place.  I did say as I left \"Well, maybe it's me.  Have a good day.\""}
{"text":"the first thing i noticed was that it was very clean. eerily quiet. the two men behind the counter had beady eyes and wide smiles. very patient in waiting for our order. i ordered the chicken taco and enchilada with rice and beans. my girl got the rolled tacos meal with a large horchata. para aqui i say as im handing him $12. pretty decent

after sitting and chomping on carrots and cucumber for some moments we decide we dont want to stay and ask for it para llevar. they got kinda upset. as we get the food and start collecting salsa my girl over hears them talking shit in spanish. i wouldnt normally mind but she was very offended especially since there were other mexicans in the dining area. 

we didnt say anything but quietly left. 3 stars for being one of the only taco shops in the area with decent food. 

im from san diego and eat mexican food all the time. barely do i ever get a hint of disrespect."}
{"text":"Decent for late night eats. Good prices with everything under $10. Open 24 hours! 

Reminds of SD style taquerias more than Norcal ones. Rolled tacos (taquitos) and carne asada fries lace the menu. You can get pretty much everything topped with yellow cheese. Would've preferred queso fresco. 

Carne asada fries ($10), were just ok. It's really hard to top SD's carne asada. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/don-tortaco-las-vegas-2?select=rmf0QtLhfAWP3UZfYGmv9g#rmf0QtLhfAWP3UZfYGmv9g)

I got a lengua, adobada, and a fish taco ($7). The fish was a fishstick. First time having adobada (pork marinated in red chili sauce) kinda reminded me of al pastor. The lengua was pretty gamey, even for me. Free refills on drinks, washed it down with a horchata/jamaica/sprite mix. Still couldn't get all the gaminess from the lengua out. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/don-tortaco-las-vegas-2?select=X7KzJ5Y-pXoXw6oTurmkUQ#X7KzJ5Y-pXoXw6oTurmkUQ)

2.5 but rounding up since I didn't get the runs the next day."}
{"text":"Dont expect too much about the food because is just OK but the price is cheap enough. So lets go just for standard tacos. The decoration its not classy but you have a free bar of jalapeños and some pickled veggies all you can eat."}
{"text":"I'm so glad they opened this location in Henderson! It's about time Don Tortacos came around these parts. They just opened so it's really clean on the inside. 

I really enjoy the fact that they're open 24 hours so if you want a breakfast burrito for lunch or dinner, it doesn't matter what time you order it. I like the quality of their adobada fries the most. It's delicious and they always make the fries extra crispy for me. You can never go wrong with some Mexican food in your system!"}
{"text":"I'm allergic to dairy. I don't eat meat. I just ordered a bean burrito and a side of chips and guac. 
I get a beef and chicken burrito. And chips smothered with cheese. I don't understand how the fuck you can fuck up that badly. Especially after you repeat my order to me, and then make sure again at the window when I pay $10. If I would've taken a bite of that burrito I would've broken out in hives. Instead of offering a refund or offering to make a new order they argued and told me I had to pay if I wanted something else."}
