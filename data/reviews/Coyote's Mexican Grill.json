{"text":"Went there last night with a group of friends, the atmosphere was nice..BUT WE ALL GOT FOOD POISONING ALL 6 OF US! It had to be THE SALSA, because WE ALL GOT SICK! This place has a serious bacteria problem! I will never go there again & you shouldn't either unless you would like to spend your night puking & shitting your brains out, then go for it!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent, nice new atmosphere! Service is  always friendly. At times amusing in that almost everyone that works there speaks broken English. But the orders are served fast.  Prices AND portions are great!"}
{"text":"Our first time...great service, great food!!  Our bartender Josh made sure we were taken care of and the food was exceptional. Fresh Mexican food is hard to find. Will definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"Best everything in town. Love the staff and margaritas are delish. Karaoke on Saturdays really makes this place even better. It is packed and great for the family!"}
{"text":"Just visited this newly opened restaurant for the first time.  I lived for 10 years in New Mexico so I am always looking for good Mexican food.  I am happy to say that we had a great experience.  The Margaritas were really good and huge( and they are not very expensive either) I ordered a medium margarita and it was 28 ounces!  They served some sort of cole slaw with the chips which was a little weird.  The salsa that came with the chips was good, but I like mine a little chunkier.  I ordered chile rellenos with beef.  The flavors were excellent!  I tried bites of my wife's fajita chimichanga and some beef taquitos and both were good as well.  I am a sucker for Mariachi music so I am really hoping that they have that going regularly.  I am looking forward to my next trip!"}
{"text":"Great place, food , service and huge drink menu!  One complaint is the booth benches. Im only 5' 1\" and these seats were very narrow i dont know how a tall person would sit in these booths. Very uncomfortable! It would not stop me from going back and asking for a table though!! The other small issue was they didn't have enough ingredients to prepare my drink which was straight off the menu so it ended up not being mixed very well and was too strong! Thay accommodated me without an issue. Everything else was very impressive!!"}
{"text":"This is what you expect when you go out for basic american mexican.  And its good, with great service, tasty food, a nice environment, and a very convenient location.

I wanted to reach outside the burrito and combo box this time.  So I ordered one of the chicken specialties that frankly reads more like a gourmet and authentic mexican dish.  It did did not let me down and was exactly as explained in the menu.

Lots of large hand cut fresh vegetables, lots of chicken, and a great sauce with a kick.  Their guacamole is also a must and their plentiful chips are excellent.  

Again, service was great and we never waited on a thing."}
{"text":"Really, really good food. Quick service. Kid friendly menu. Good prices. Slight issue with language barrier, but the staff is so kind."}
{"text":"Went for first time last week. Very clean. Food was good but not as described - more fillings and different toppings came then listed on menu. Fries were amazing as was fried ice cream. I will go back but will verify what is in/comes with order so there aren't surprises. (such as broccoli, peppers, mushrooms and onions in my seafood chimi!)"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a classic Mexican restaurant this will definitely hit the spot. There's a huge open bar if you're looking to just stop in for a drink or margarita. They have lots of seating inside so can get kind of loud, but that kind of adds to the atmosphere. Not to mention the fact that the sometimes have karaoke nights or will bring in live performers, this place is always a blast. The menu is huge, but the main stand out is something that you don't even have to order. Coleslaw will automatically be brought to your table with chips and for some reason it works really well with the salsa.  If you're in the mood for a fun night with some Mexican food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great, not like your typical Mexican restaurant. I think this place is a little hidden gem. Best cheese dip I have ever had and I loved the odd coleslaw mix to dip the fresh tortillas in! Everything we ordered was delicious including my margaritas. I also like that they have \"light\" live music to enhance the atmosphere. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by finally - have been by this restaurant so many times.  Located in the side of a strip shopping center. If you are reading this review, do yourself a favor and stop - the food and service is simply outstanding!

I had the Burrito Mexicano - grilled pork, mushrooms, broccoli, onions, peppers and tomatoes wrapped in a tortilla, covered with guacamole and sour cream. Veggies were tender and crunchy.  The pork was outstanding. The portions were enough to feed several. 

One of the best burritos I have had anywhere in the Cleveland area. Also at the table, a Vegetarian Quesadilla. Perfectly prepared vegetables wrapped between a tortilla with cheese. The slaw and  salsa provided prior to the meal added great flavor and spiced up the meal. 

Stop here for the food - stay for the good Marguerita!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican food! We ate at the bar and Josh was a terrific bartender! He made us AMAZING hand made margaritas!! (I don't like pre-made mix)  I had the green vegetable enchiladas with a side of black beans!! YUMMM!
GREAT LOCAL GEM! 
Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"A hotspot for a quick lunch when I'm in the area for work.  Typical Mexican fare, which isn't a bad thing.  Unfortunately I cannot try the margaritas when I'm on the clock...

What I can tell you is the service is prompt and attentive. The food is reasonably priced and although not the best I've ever had, certainly not bad by any stretch.  They have a nice little lunch menu (that I wish would be expanded a bit, but it's ok) and the food comes out faster than you can say \"more chips please!\""}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant around! The chips and salsa are amazing and the blueberry margaritas are out of this world!!"}
{"text":"The food and service here are outstanding.  We had the fajitas tonight the coyote special. The amount of food we had in addition to the quality was superb.  I believe our servers name was Victoria she was excellent.   This is one of the best Mexican restaurants in all of Ohio.   I can also say that I go to a lot of Mexican restaurants in New Mexico and Arizona and I highly recommend this restaurant even in comparison to the great restaurants there."}
{"text":"I judge tex-mex by how they prepare their veggies and this is where Coyotes excels. They beat everyone else out there on quantity and quality. Get the veggie fajitas and you will be rewarded. The complementary chips are also very crisp and they also hand out cole slaw as a chip dip which is a surprising good match."}
{"text":"This is our favorite local Mexican restaurant.  We enjoy the chips and salsa + cole slaw.  We have all found our favorite dishes here.  Pretty standard Mexican restaurant offerings.  Prices are good."}
{"text":"My friends and I ate at coyotes once and I don't think I will go again any time soon. The food was mediocre and was covered in cheese sauce. One of my friends ordered something for dessert because he had already eaten, and it did not come out until all of us had already eaten our meals. The service was not good, the food was okay, I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place pretty much sucks... the only thing I enjoyed was my queso. Every time I try and give it a new chance, it never comes out good. Yesterday I had the pollo benidno (sp) dish and the presentation was awful. It was a small piece of chicken that only took three bites. A scoop of rice that I got maybe 10 bites out of with cheese sauce on top. For 9.99 a fish...I don't think it's worth it. Go to El Camino in Aurora!"}
{"text":"Lived in AZ for 8 years.  I am slightly critical of Mexican food because of this.  Coyote's isn't perfect, it isn't just north of the border Mexican fair.  But, for Ohio Mexican, they are really good.  Best Tamale I have had in Ohio so far (Other than my own).  I don't understand the slaw with the chips and while their salsa is good, I wish it had a touch of heat.  I get that doesn't fly in this area so, it is toned down.  LOVE their tortillas!  They are always nice enough to give us a bag when we ask.  (I would and have tried to pay for them)  Great tacos, enchiladas, carnitas and Carne Asada.  The servers are great and we have never had a bad experience there.  I can't wait until it isn't just my wife and I so we can try the Guacamole cart!"}
{"text":"I'm just here for happy hour! LoL However, this place is cool. Great drink selection, cold draft beer and big tequila list. Happy hour runs 2:00-6:00 with nice margarita specials. The service is wonderful and the food being served around me looks dynamite! 

Bar tender gives you chips and salsa which helps the Corona go down. Big place with plenty of seating and friendly atmosphere. I will definitely be bringing the family back for dinner.

Ok....went back for dinner and it was good. Large menu of great Mexican food! Soon as you sit down they bring your table chips and salsa. Along with the salsa they give you coleslaw (different but good). Everything is fresh! My wife got the steak  fajitas that were awesome. I got the chimichanga and son had a chicken quesadilla, both just as good. The guacamole and refried beans were ok. 

The atmosphere is friendly and the establishment was very clean, including the bathrooms. Waitstaff is on point and restaurant is kid friendly. We live close by and this will be our stop for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here 3 times in the last 5 weeks and the food has been consistent and very very good.  We have ordered several different dishes and I have ordered the Carnitas twice!  They are the best I have had anywhere.  The service is average to slightly above, but the quality of the food and margaritas keeps bringing us back!"}
{"text":"We were referred by a friend from Arizona who lives right on the border. She knows Mexican authentic food. This was a great experience. Great food."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!! My family got take out, and that food was well cooked and packaged. So I would say that suggests dine in is even better. I am surprised that Plaza Agave still survives down the road, this spot is much better. 

I will say though that calling in an order was rough - I had to scream in the phone. But when we picked up it was calm and quiet?? What's up with that. Also the complimentary salsa tasted strongly of oregano and tomato (of course). So I felt like I was eating marinara sauce and chips... Uhhhhh weird. 

But anyways, olé!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had called in a take out on Saturday night and were treated very RUDELY by the bartenders. The wait time to pick up order  was terrible and would not recognize us for 15 minutes .Too busy serving drinks. AREN'T ALL CUSTOMERS IMPORTANT? Second time this has happened. We are done going there."}
{"text":"We have been here about 8 times since they have open and always get a good meal for the price.  They also have great happy hour drink specials including a giant margarita (15 or so flavors)for five bucks.  I've been getting the shredded beef enchiladas, which is definitely the most authentic Mexican dish I've ever had in Ohio. Lastly good friendly service and a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Prob a 3 1/2, coulda been a 5 but the fried ice cream was not freshly fried and the margaritas were weak and sweet. A little more heat (flavor heat) would have improved things. Overall everything was fresh and tasty. Steak fajitas were solid and plenty of meat. The carnitas were excellent."}
{"text":"So I almost passed this place up when I saw the 3.5 star review.  That would have been a huge mistake. 

We took a chance, and we were richly rewarded.  This is a traditional Mexican style restaurant, with exceptional attention to detail and great service.  

I had the Paradilla, and my lovely bride went with Fajita Chimichanga.  The food was fresh and hot, well seasoned and quickly served.  The shrimp from the paradilla was so good, I popped them in my mouth directly, rather than swaddle them in a tortilla.  

It may not be Barrios, but for traditional family-style Mexican, it's the best I've had in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I always love a place that gives you unlimited free chips. That's an extra star. They give you the regular salsa and the chips and coleslaw to start. If you ask they will bring out the hot salsa which kind of sucks. I ordered the guacamole and queso which is awesome but expensive for the amount you get. For an entrée I got the chicken chimichangas. I realized the sauce that they put on them is the same queso that I just paid too much for. Next time I will just ask for extra sauce on my chicken chimichangas and eat that with my chips LOL. Save that extra money and still get all the dips! 

My mom ordered one of the beef enchiladas and it was nowhere near as good as the chicken chimichangas. Would not order that again. But we will be going back!"}
{"text":"I didn't go to this place for the longest time because I saw its Yelp rating. Let me just say that the 3 star rating is very misleading. The food was really really awesome! Lots of food for not a lot of money. Go here eat here it's super delicious.

PS Barb is a racist who doesn't understand what a lunch special is. Don't listen to her one star review. This is authentic Mexican cuisine made by the people who know it best. If you are also a racist don't go here, just go fuck yourself."}
{"text":"Went last night for an after dinner drink with my husband. When we walked in we were greeted immediately, which was nice. We sat down at the bar and the bartender introduced himself as senior Josh and asked us what we would like to drink. I had a patron margarita which was good and my husband had a beer-negro modelo. We were then given a bowl of chips,salsa and cole slaw. Good salsa and slaw chips should of been warm.
Overall great service. 
******The atmosphere needs some work.The lighting needs a lot of work. Very dingy.
We arrived around 9pm after dinner time frame and they need to play more bar music then Mexican music."}
{"text":"Seven ladies went for lunch. Had great service and very good food. Waiter brought chips, salsa, and slaw. Can't go wrong on those. I had a seafood soup. Included shrimp, mussels, calamari, scallops--so good. The others had burritos, salads, ceviche, tacos. All were very good. Fast lunch. Clean and friendly. Bar drinks available."}
