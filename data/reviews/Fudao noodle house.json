{"text":"Clean,  nice,  friendly environment, not too many fancy options, simple  and easy and very economic"}
{"text":"very good price! about 8 bucks for a noodle soup, and unlimited noodle refill. flavour and service are ok. pulling dishes into the noodle soup is a fun experience."}
{"text":"Cheap. Fast. Tasty. This place was everything that I expected. I went with a friend of mine on a Thursday evening and it was packed! The weather was getting a little chilly so the food here really hit the spot. Food wise it was decent for the price. The amount of toppings we received was not a lot but it did fill me up. The broth flavor was mediocre. I ordered the shredded pork & pickled cabbage soup and sadly the pickled cabbage flavor was not as intense as I would have wanted. Will definitely come back but for the mean time, packaged ??? will have to do."}
{"text":"You have a line of people ahead of you but if you don't mind waiting, it's worth the meal. You can't beat their noodle soup on a cold day. I got their Fudao original for $8.49 which their price is a very decent and the food is generous."}
{"text":"This franchise noodle place is okay. Price was reasonable, extra noodles free by request.  The only thing I didn't like was the quantity of ingredients that you get to put in the noodle.  I wish there was more green vegetables or Asian vegetables.  They're probably churning these trays out in an assembly line back there as they're all pretty identical to the last exact 2 pieces of vegetable per dish."}
{"text":"Quick efficient service  And great value for all the food Extra noodles are unlimited!  Had the shredded pork soup with extra beef and will definitely be back to try the curry soup."}
{"text":"We walked past this restaurant in Chinatown on a cold November night and it looked pretty busy so we were inclined to go and give it a try.  After reading other reviews I guess we got lucky and did not have to wait for a table on a Thursday evening.    After we were promptly seated, we were then given a paper menu and a pen to mark our orders.  You choose your soup base and it comes with 10 free toppings (mushrooms, corn, mussels, bean curd, ham, quail egg, black fungus, shrimp, fish cake, and zha jiang), pork slices, spinach and UNLIMITED NOODLES.  All this can be yours on a cold winter night for $8 plus tax and tip!   I got the tomato flavour soup base and it had a nice tang to it and it didn't seem to have too much MSG in it as I wasn't overly thirsty after dinner.  We also got the popcorn chicken and Taiwanese sausage off their snacks menu.  The popcorn chicken was crispy, warm and wasn't overly oily.  The Taiwanese sausage was savory with hints of sweetness.   Overall the flavours aren't anything to write home about, but I would still 100% make a return visit.  Winter is coming and having a cauldron of delicious broth and unlimited noodles makes it a lot more bearable."}
{"text":"Service was not very good, didn't refill our water once and dropped trays of side dishes in the table stacked on top of each other and walked away.  Toppings were okay, only 3 slices of meat included.  Probably would not come back as there are better options"}
{"text":"I was so into trying this place but found the food pretty mediocre and arranging of toppings on 8 tiny dishes seemed gimmicky and didn't do much to change the eating experience. My partner had the original noodle and I had the spicy one. It wasn't too savory and it just seemed like a fishcake, some corn, small slice of ham, boiled egg and seaweed would be things we could toss into a noodle soup at home too."}
{"text":"This place was recommended as the superior bubbling rice noodle place downtown and I had to try it to compare it with the competition.  When you walk in you're greeted by ample table seating, and also a window facing bar by the window.  The soup bases are what you expect, and I picked the spicy, while others had the tomato.  The soup is not too spicy, and we stuck with the standard ingredients.  Portions seem to be better than the other places, and the service was fast and attentive.  Will come back again for the quintessential rice noodle experience."}
{"text":"I am glad to eat this rice noodle with many kinds items mixing together, great for health. I remarked about the less boisterous atmosphere compared to the Japanese and Korean noodle places we've been. Also I noticed that there was no liquor license, and no one that I could see even ordered any kind of drink. Water is provided and Chinese herbal tea is available as well as soft drinks. That was a pleasant chang"}
{"text":"Amazing deal and cool presentation. Soup noodles are $8.49 (original) to $8.99 (tomato, spicy). You get a vat of boiling soup broth, with noodles on the side and the toppings laid out beautifully on a tray. You can't choose the toppings but they were plentiful: quail egg, 1 shrimp, 1 fish tofu, ham, meat sauce, fresh bean curd, Chinese fungus, corn, mushroom, veggies, 3 slices of meat.   I love these lai fun noodles, these are hard to find and they are my favouite!  The original broth was flavourful, not too salty.   We didn't order any appetizers as they looked small."}
{"text":"I love noodles. Fudao is taking a simple concept and stamping out meals with precision. It was great to see everyone at Fudao slurping the noodles all at the same time, and enjoying it to the fullest.  We went for the standard broth, with one person asking for a vegetarian version. The server asked the chef and a custom Thai curry broth was served. Bonus point for that! We ended up swapping and exchanging toppings from the cute box, and I ended up with most of the meat which was delicious! If you are eating one order, it may not satisfy you. Consider getting the popcorn chicken as well. It was a combo of white and dark meat and was a nice crunchy item to slather with the house made chilli oil.  Service was prompt and courteous. We remarked about the less boisterous atmosphere compared to the Japanese and Korean noodle places we've been. Also I noticed that there was no liquor license, and no one that I could see even ordered any kind of drink. Water is provided and Chinese herbal tea is available as well as soft drinks. That was a pleasant change."}
{"text":"Fudao is my new favourite noodles place downtown! It's conveniently located in the central parts of Chinatown. And based on my experience, it's best to visit during a weekday for dinner than between Friday to Sunday, or else you will definitely need to wait in line. There was a Friday that I went at 9PM, it was packed even after we finished eating. ITS THAT CRAZY, for noodles.  Eating at Fudao is super simple. On the sheet of menu/paper they provide, just follow their instructions. Step 1: Pick your soup base that ranges from mild to spicy. Step 2: If you don't want their signature noodle, pick whatever else you like.  Most people order their rice noodles that come in a stone bowl with the noodles and 10 toppings served on the side. The best part about this restaurant is you get free noodle refills if the first bowl doesn't fill you. And secondly, if there are toppings within the 10 you don't like, you can exchange for something else more suitable to your tastes. But to be honest (after eating at Fudao twice so far), some of those toppings I still have no clue exactly what they are.  My most recommended soup base is the Fudao Rice Noodle in Thai Curry Soup. For someone who doesn't eat that much spice, this base is perfect. Although it has one chili sign next to it, it's not too bad at all. While you dump in all the toppings and noodles to fill the bowl, the curry soup simmers and mix together everything deliciously. The curry soup gives a kick to your meal yet it blends in well. Fudao is best eaten when the weather is cold too. I also have to give credit to their noodles as its really well done in terms of texture and chewy-ness.  Two interesting things I would say is that sometimes it's quite difficult to find back all the toppings I've dumped into the soup since they are so small. But it's also fun to dig around for them, it's like exploring for treasure in an ocean. And secondly, the background YouTube music videos and songs they always play is super hipster! First time there it was all rap, and second time it was top billard R&B and Hip Hop."}
{"text":"Service was good before but now I see that the owner is not really on site and the service is utterly horrible. Food is decent for the price. Barely any protein in the noodle soup tho, just there for the carbs."}
{"text":"Yelp did not disappoint!  Based on the pretty consistent reviews, we decided to come try this place out.   Busy for a Sunday night. Various broths to choose from... extra rice noodles if one portion isn't enough for you... The price is definitely right!    We tried one non-spicy broth and one spicy.  I preferred the spicy one.  There was a solid variety of toppings/ingredients for your soup.    I thought the service was pretty good. I liked the lemon water too.   I will come back in the winter!  It will surely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Great and affordable Chinese noodle place! Usually these noodle houses have bland basic soup bases, but I absolutely love Fudao's! It's very flavourful and reminiscent of pork or beef bone soup. Best part is the unlimited noodle refills! The noodles are a very nice rice noodle with a bouncy texture. Would definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Looks like adding toppings and noodles in your choice of soup yourself is a new trend nowadays. Tried it for the first time tonight and I have to say that I quite enjoyed the experience. Toppings were fresh and there's free refill of the noodles. We ordered the original rice noodle, the rice noodle in tomato soup and the cold cut chicken in chili sauce - all were pretty tasty. The soup came out boiling and the toppings were the same for the two different soup bases. Our server recommended putting the raw meat and mushrooms in the soup first, then the remaining toppings, and the noodles last. This is a nice alternative to hot pot.   The only issue I can think of is that if you want to pay by debit or credit card you'd have to go up to the cashier and there is only 1 card machine for it. There was a group of people that paid individually and I had to wait 5-10 minutes till it was my turn."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 3 times and we just keep coming back. The biggest thing here is value, you get SO much here AND you get free noodle refills all for $8.99. Of course, we also usually get a snack to go with it and we found the seaweed salad (not the Japanese type FYI) to be one of the best value snacks as well. The second biggest thing is taste, the spicy noodles are just the right amount of spicy, the pickled cabbage soup has just the right amount of tang. All of them are really delicious. I would say that the curry soup is a bit oily but that's to be expected. It can get busy so smaller groups are better and don't be surprised if you need to wait during rush hour. Still a shorter wait time than any ramen place tho so it's definitely worth it. It does seem to be heavy on MSG tho so I do get pretty thirsty afterwards. But I can't stop coming back!"}
{"text":"Very good portions for $8. The soup stayed hot throughout my entire meal which I really enjoyed.   The soup is very flavourful.  I got the spicy and sour soup and my boyfriend got the spicy pickled pepper soup.  Both delicious.  The spicy pickled pepper soup is rather spicy so be careful is you are not good with spicy food.   We ordered a cold dish and a snack.  Too much food for 2 ppl, TBH.    The staff there is very friendly and attentive.   The place is very clean, which is an important feature for me.   I highly recommend you to check it out if you enjoy hot pot and ramen noodles.  This place is like a mash-up of it.   It gets pretty busy during lunchtime."}
{"text":"Walked by this place earlier today (3pm). Saw quite some people in there so decided to give it a try. First I was quite impressed on their service. If you go to Chinese restaurants on a regular basis, you will probably be like me, never expect much on service. But they WOWed me. They have a very simple menu. I asked the server what he recommend, he's clearly deliver the message and explained everything on it is good. I ordered the spicy noodle. It was really authentic. Reminded me of the noodle I had in Yunnan province 10+ years ago. The manager (could be the owner) saw me taking pictures of the menu, approached me ask if I'd like to see their new menu coming in next week. Smart! I took a picture of their new menu too. What they also did smart is putting all the ingredients on the side for you. So you clearly see what are there. They give you guidance how to put in what to put in first etc. I felt the overall experience is pretty good. The only thing I think might be a bit off for me is the soup I had is bit salty. Other than that, I am very happy with this restaurant. Will come back in the near future!"}
{"text":"Unlimited food and soup! That's how they bring you in but honestly you'll be filled with the first bowl. It wasn't the best I've had, but was filling. Customer service was alright."}
{"text":"Toronto is getting a craze of noodle houses! Came in on a weeknight on a warm spring day and we were very lucky that there was no line. Seated immediately and was prompted with some salty peanuts as a snack. Menu is not extensive which is good for indecisive people. There was maybe 8 soup bases to choose from, and many add ons/ small appetizers to share.   I choose the regular soup base which was very flavourful and not milky in texture (unlike dagu's soup base which i find a bit more rich and milky). Each noodle soup comes with 10 ingredients ranging from fish tofu, shrimp, tripe, veggies, 3 pieces of meat (i think it was lamb), quail egg, bamboo shoots and a couple of other ingredients. Once you recieve the bubbling soup, you immediately dump your ingredients in so it can cook for a longer period of time. very similar concept to hot pot but just not all you can eat! haha Once you get your soup you are also provided with a bowl of rice noodles. I find the noodles here super chewy and tasty. It is already somewhat seasoned even before putting it in the soup! Noodles are also unlimited so if you're not full with one bowl you can keep ordering more and more noodles!  As side dishes, we ordered the seaweed salad. Not the typical sushi seaweed salad, a thicker and more real tasting seaweed seasoned with some seasame oil and green onions. Very tasty and fair for the price (4.99 for a good size dish), and also the popcorn chicken. Nothing too much to rave about the popcorn chicken but it was a nice added touch to eat while waiting for the noodles to come.  Service was fast and super friendly. All servers could speak english and would great in recommending what to order. They also have a promo right now that if you spend 25$ or more you get a free chinese pop (taste like c plus) haha. Cash and debit only though so be mindful of this. Will definitely be returning when craving a hot bowl of noodle soup!"}
{"text":"Yunnan style noodles or Crossing Bridge noodles are the new ''it'' thing for me now.  This restaurant in particular was at the top of my radar because of all the five star ratings.  Located in Chinatown, where quality and sanitation can be - you know - ''sketch'', I was even more excited to find a diamond in the rough.  The restaurant is very clean.  This is true even when they are busy with hoards of diners, many of whom have to line up outside for at least 10 minutes. This resonated well with my germaphobic soul.  My bf got the original broth and I got the spicy-sour peppered broth. Both were very flavourful, though I preferred the original, which felt lighter to boot. You can up the ante in flavour with some additional sauces on the side, though the broths are completely fine without them.  Also, I wouldn't say the 11 free ingredients were exciting additions and I honestly wished it was possible to get free refills of meat.  However, the free refills of noodles was differently the gimmick for me.  They only have medium-thick round rice noodles, which are not my preference and they softened too quickly for my liking, but if you're a hungry hippo, you're just damn happy to get more noodles for zero cost!  Overall, we like the free noodle refills, affordable pricing, and level of sanitation. That's saying a lot because my bf usually reels at Chinese noodle soups. Will we be coming back? Yes. Hopefully they introduce different types of noodles in the near future for flat noodle lovers like me!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and it's become a staple!  Really good broth and noodles, I think the texture is more my preference than Dagu, the other rice noodle joint not too far from here. Dagu has thicker noodles that are more on the soft side whereas Fudao has thinner, slightly harder noodles. I also like the toppings here better and the soup is not overly salty. It's lower price point as well and I feel its better quality.  The servers are pretty nice but it gets crowded."}
{"text":"Unique and authentic noodle house known for its hot pot noodles. The noodles are reasonably priced. You could get a great meal for less than $10.   The noodles and a selection of 10 items comes on the side. The soup base comes in a hot pot. Part of the fun is you cooking the noodle and the various items in the hot pot.   I would recommend getting a spicy soup base. The original (which I have tried before) was slightly bland.   I would recommend coming early as it could get busy."}
{"text":"Good food & good service. It was quick and easy to order and the staff were accommodating to my food requests...I don't eat pork and beef so they gave me seafood and veggies instead. Love the place ...will def go there again."}
{"text":"Fudao noodle house is my go-to place for a piping hot bowl of noodles with an abundance of toppings and flavourful broth. My favourite is the spicy pickled pepper soup, which they list as spiciest broth they have. It's the type of spice that builds up as you eat it, but can't stop because it's so delicious. They offer unlimited noodle refills, though just one serving is usually enough for me. The toppings include pork, spinach, quail's egg, ox tongue, corn, shrimp, fish tofu, squid, seaweed, and more. It's a great value for just $9.99.   I also got the squid skewer, which was absolutely delicious. The seasoning was a little spicy, a little sweet, and only cost $2.99 too!   They give a complimentary bowl of salted peanuts when you arrive. There was also a promotion when I was there where we got a free drink for our order over $25. The service is pretty quick and there's rarely a wait for tables.   I definitely recommend this as an alternative for other popular noodle houses like Dagu, which often has a long line. This place has better food, a cleaner environment, better service, and less of a wait."}
{"text":"This place is nice and populated by Chinese people that enjoy this Yunnan classic dish. The Crossing Bridge Noodles is basically your own little hot pot Noodle, which tastes fresh and delicious. Great place to come on a cold winter day.   It's also quite affordable so Im sure I'm going to be coming back!"}
{"text":"My favourite place for eating in my whole trip to Canada, free bowls of noodles, the soup was delicious and I swear the fried chicken was the best entrance. The waitress were so polite and every moment in there I felt welcomed. Ps: the prices are fair for what you receive."}
{"text":"First of all -- the WIFI password is fudao888 -- now the review..  Very clean inside, friendly staff, reasonably priced.  Seems really popular when I went -- it might be because it's relatively new. The decor is alright. The dishes are neat. Washroom could be cleaner, but above average for the neighbourhood.   The menu is simple and straightforward. Expect noodles, get noodles.   Pick your noodle base and it comes with ten toppings. The ten toppings come separately from the soup and you put it in yourself. They advise to put the meat and mushrooms in first as it takes a bit longer to cook those through. Hold off on putting in the noodles last! It really fills up the bowl and absorbs the heat.  Keep in mind, soup and rice noodles are free refills! So ask for extra when you're done if you're feeling extra hungry. You can also swap any of the toppings (or even get ten of the same topping!).   Don't forget about the appetizers. I think they're well-priced with respect to the noodles. Noodles + multiple appetizers for under twenty dollars? Great! I got a popcorn chicken which was pretty good; woulda personally liked it a bit saltier."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoyed the experience eating here. I did not know what to expect when we walked.  ---About the food---- Basically you order the type of soup and they bring out a huge cauldron of your soup base. You get toppings placed in small dishes and you can add whatever you want into the bowl and leave out whatever you don't want. You also get noodles on the side so there is a lot of customization.   Overall, would definitely come here again to try out their other types of broths! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Delicious delicious delicious! It's very busy and there's a line at the front. But it's worth the wait. The price is so goooood! I ll go back again.  It's a filling meal."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a bang for your buck, and you're also into noodles, Fudao would be a perfect place to go. This restaurant specializes in Chinese noodle soups, but also has some snacks and appetizers on the menu. You start off by choosing a soup base which comes with several different toppings along with plain noodles to add into your sizzlin' soup. You can order additional toppings as well if you're willing to pay extra, as the restaurant has a lot to choose from!   I went with the Thai Curry soup, the regular default toppings, and noodles, which was was really good. The soup was flavorful and had the toppings (including corn, meat, vegetables, bean curd, etc.) gave the dish a lot of variety - you can view my picture below to get a sense of all of the toppings since I don't know what they're all called. The prices are very reasonable for the large portions you get in each bowl. If you're still feeling hungry with soup left over, you can actually get unlimited refills of noodles for free! How amazing is that?! I couldn't finish my first bowl, so I didn't have a need to order a second, but I can see how this would definitely come in handy for someone who is able to handle a large amount.   Overall, Fudao Noodle House was an excellent choice for noodles around Chinatown in Toronto. The interior design is cute, the restaurant is spacious and casual, and the service is pretty good for a Chinese restaurant. I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect as we decided to eat here after seeing the lineup of the the place we wanted to go- best decision ever!   It's freaking $7.99 for unlimited noodles+soup and 11 free toppings. If you want to add \"premium toppings\" it's $1.99 extra for a fair amount. I tried two of the soup bases, spicy and sour + spicy pickled pepper. I recommend the spicy and sources the pickled pepper didn't have much flavour, just spice.   The servers explained the menu and answered all of our questions, and at the end of our meal- they took the effort to thank and greet us in Vietnamese (they were Chinese or Korean)"}
{"text":"Clean, fast service and fresh food: very nice set up and quality if you crave noodles...wish they had also other specialties. Very good, would recommend if you in Spadina avenue. Will be back next time i am in town!"}
{"text":"Recommended by my brother, came here once and had a great experience. Service was efficient and the food was delicious and at a reasonable price. Nothing to complain about! Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I simply can't believe how cheap this place is!! For $7.99, you get a soup base, an assortment of toppings and a large bowl of noodles that you then proceed to mix together to get a yummy bowl of rice noodle soup.   The quality of the ingredients is a bit of a let down: I got some romain lettuce for my soup (since when are we supposed to boil romaine??) but hey for $8, I can't really complain.   However, I'm slightly sketched out by their soup base: having tried origination's MSG and fish oil free soup base, I have a hard time believing that the soup base here that is oh so flavourful does not contain MSG... Anyone have any opinions on this?"}
{"text":"I have been here more than 3 times. Highly recommend the popcorn Chicken and the noodle. The service was great and the environment was clean."}
{"text":"The service is not bad, but need to be better. The noodles are really good and it's interesting to put all the dishes into the soup."}
{"text":"Comes with 10 side items + Free noodle refills. Totally worth it for $8.49.   I work close by and it's the perfect place to have some warm and hearty soup."}
{"text":"I was actually en route to a different place for dinner when I walked past Fudao Noodle House and decided to eat here instead. I was intrigued by the concept of having noodles hot-pot style. You're given hot soup in a stone bowl, 10 toppings (3 slices of meat, lettuce, mushroom, quail egg, tofu skin, etc), and noodles. **And the noodles are unlimited!!** (After eating the initial portion though, I was quite full.) I picked their original soup, which was very peppery but flavorful and delicious. For under $10, you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"New place to get the famous 'crossing the bridge' noodles.  I have tried a few other places in Chinatown and they are all good but this one is now my favorite. Well deserved 5*.  You get everything in small plates and add it into your soup as the legend. It's delicious.  Everything is clean, with a friendly staff and service.  Highly recommend to anyone who wants to get noodles soup."}
{"text":"So many rice noodle/\"crossing the bridge noodles\" have been opening up in Toronto! Fudao was recommended to me by another friend and boy was I pleasantly surprised. The price point is lower than other places I've been to, and the portions are generous!   One thing that I really appreciate about Fudao is that the soup is not overly salty. They give you lots of toppings, and there are also many options for side dishes, which I found to be authentic."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for noodle soup.  If you like thai curry then I would recommend getting their thai curry soup.  All soups come with various meats and vegetables which can be substituted if you ask the staff.  If you run out of noodles you can ask for more with no extra charge.  After my first visit to the place I have added it to my must visit regularly list."}
{"text":"They offer vegetarian broth. That's high point!!! Free noodle refill is great!!! Price also nice!!! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Having been here several times since my first visit, I would rate this actually a star higher. I've tried the tomato, spicy, curry, soup bases and they are all pretty decent and flavourful.  I usually get an extra order of noodles to finish off the remaining food and soup. The great thing I learned (from other reviews) is that they allow substitutions. This is great if you don't like specific foods or you really love one of the sides.  Would recommend, especially since the price is below $10."}
{"text":"This noodle place offers \"crossing the bridge noodles\".  This dish (noodle itself is just rice noodle) is from Yun Nan Province in southern China.   The dish has 3 components.  First, a large bowl of BOILING soup (you have 7 choices of soup). Second, a bowl of cooked rice noodle (no flavour). Third, a tray of small plates of ingredients (raw vegetables, raw pork slice, mushroom, seaweed) that are ready to be added into the boiling soup.  How to eat this? Put small plate of ingredients into boiling soup. Raw meat and mushroom go first. And then raw vegetables, fish cake, corn, etc. At last, add the rice noodle. Wait about 30 seconds, once raw meat is fully cooked, you can indulge the dish!  This dish is very simple. What makes one stands out is the SOUP! And I have to say this place has the best soup/broth! There are another two similar noodle places in Chinatown that also specialize in crossing-the-bridge-noodle, and a number of them in uptown, this is one of the best I have had among all.  Tips: don't expect to finish the dish in 10 mins, because the soup is sooo hot. Also did I mention they offer unlimited noodle and soup refill?"}
{"text":"Noodles are quite good, and nicely presented. It's similar to other Yunnan noodle's I've had in Toronto, but definitely a great novelty factor (and great taste!) if you've never tried them.  Decor and ambiance was also run of the mill modern/chinese restaurant. In terms of side dishes, they were a bit hit and miss: - shredded potatoes are great, nice chili oil - roast squid was less great, a bit too chewy"}
{"text":"Nice noodle house free refillable rice noodle. It's come with a set of 10 toppings, rice noodle and a soup base. Food is nice and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Toronto is home to many noodle and ramen places and Chinatown is no exception! Fudao noodle house features a very simple menu with soup bases and add-ons on the front and appetizers/snacks/drinks on the back. If you're a fan of free refills on noodles and customizing you dishes then this place is perfect for you. Here's a rundown of my experience:  Food: To start, we ordered the Spicy Duck Tongue and Cold Cut Chicken with Chili Sauce after it was recommended by the server. Duck tongue is never my thing so I tried a little bit of it to taste and was impressed by the seasoning on the tongue. The tongues were sitting on a bed of seaweed, which complemented the sweet and slightly spicy tongues well. The cold cut chicken was definitely a banger as it was extremely tender, the sauce was very flavourful, and all around, was a pleasant experience to eat while enjoying some hot noodle soup. While it did taste good, admittedly the portions were a little small for the price I was paying and would have appreciated a bit more.  I got the Fudao Rice Noodle in Spicy Soup. The base was amazing! I'm typically not a fan of soup bases, with the exception of Vietnamese soup bases (a little biased here), but this soup base definitely had the right amount of seasoning, the pot it was in kept the temperature at a consistent level, and the spiciness was at a great level. I enjoyed the customization of the soup the most as it came with 10 toppings on the side and you got to choose which toppings to put in! (OFC, I'm a glutton so I chose to include all 10 toppings in my soup). The noodles were also very tasty. I like my noodles not too wet or not too dense and this was the perfect balance. I really enjoyed how I could get free refills on my noodles so I'd never leave feeling hungry, but lowkey this could be a bad thing because it's carbs for days! Personally, I didn't finish my one bowl of noodles but if you have a HUGE appetite then this would be the best bang for you buck!  Atmosphere: The restaurant definitely utilizes the small space to its advantage and surprisingly fits a lot of tables. It's nice for casual eating and the black decor goes well with the brick/ yellow walls and brown flooring. There may be instances where some groups might be sharing tables, but the atmosphere is so lively that it shouldn't be a problem. Overall, the  feel of the restaurant is suitable for those who prefer eating alone or with company - either works!  Service: The service was great! The servers were extremely attentive and prompt when we requested any additional utensils, refills, or toppings. However, when we came in, we were greeted in another language (assuming it's Cantonese or Mandarin) which was a little confusing. I guess it's natural for the servers to be used to a Chinese demographic eating here but it was a little unsettling being greeted in another language and not understanding what your server was saying.  Price: We paid $7.99 for the Spicy Duck Tongue and $6.99 for the Cold Cut Chicken with Chili Sauce. The portions were a little small for the price, in comparison to the noodle dishes - I wish there was more. The Fudao Rice Noodle in Spicy Soup came to $9.99 for the soup base, 10 toppings, and noodles with free refills. Personally I think this was well worth the price because of the free refills on the noodles and for having such a good base with diverse toppings.  Verdict: Overall, Fudao Noodle House is a great establishment to enjoy your fix of soup on a rainy day, as part of a social gathering, or if you're just simply craving something hot. There's about 7 bases to choose from and if you want extra toppings, there's an add-on option. The cold dishes, while small in portion, were delicious and I would definitely stop by to try the other dishes. I am giving this place a 4 star rating only because of the smaller portions on the cold dishes and the initial unsettling experience when the servers assumed we were Chinese speaking. Despite this, I expect to return and try out the other soup bases and appetizers. Definitely worth going to if you're ever in the Chinatown area."}
{"text":"Highly recommend for a quick and filling bite to eat. Each order of noodles comes with 10 complimentary toppings including egg, seaweed, mushrooms, corn, shrimp, etc). If you run out of noodles, no problem! Additional bowls of noodles are free of charge! Just ask a waiter to bring one and simply drop them into your hot soup to warm them up. I highly recommend the thai curry broth. Very aromatic and flavourful!"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed by the service and food. To be charged $1 to use the debit machine is a bit much, and should be posted on their menu, not on a scrap of paper under the door handle.  I was given lukewarm water and when I asked for the herbal tea in the menu, I was brought a can... when I clarified I wanted tea she asked me if i couldn't just have water.   The food was ok, but a bit bland. Even after i added chili oil. I got no information as to the ingredients and the clams were very dry and hard.  On a street with so many options, this one didn't meet my expectations after reading so many glowing reviews."}
{"text":"Fudao Noodle House is a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown, Toronto, which is mainly serving rice noodle in soups as well as some small snacks like Taiwanese sausage and BBQ squid skewers, and cold cucumber.  I had a lunch at FuDao Noodle House on my second day in Toronto. I walked around Chinatown in Toronto. By accident, I found FuDao Noodle House. I have arrived this place around 12 pm. There are no so many people inside the restaurant. I quickly found a table and began to order my lunch. I have ordered Lamb + Tomato Soup base rice noodle. After waiting for a few minute, the server brought 9 small cold dishes on the table. About 5 mins later, my super boiling Tomato Soup with rice noodle came out the kitchen. The way of eating the rice noodle is to put all the small cold dishes and rice noodle in the super boiling Tomato Soup. My tomato lamb soup base rice noodle was ready. The soup was tasted awesome and delicious. It was a great experience having a lunch at Fudao Noodle House in Toronto Chinatown. Cheap and Yummy."}
{"text":"Fun concept, good value for big eaters, but ultimately just really bland food. Even their spicy broth was not particularly flavourful, and the ingredients they provide don't seem particularly fresh or well-thought out, so much as a random assortment of things. There are too many alternative options in this area for a second chance!"}
{"text":"We were walking down Spadina and ducked into this place solely because we were hungry and freezing - it was -26 out today! LOL  We ordered the curry soup noodles, the popcorn chicken, the squid skewers and the chicken in chili sauce. The squid skewers were OK... the popcorn chicken was good... but the real standout was the curry soup noodles - so flavourful - and it was served in this nice, oversized bowl with enough soup and noodles for two people. And it was very reasonably priced at $8.99.  Good food, decent service and fair prices - what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Fudao Noodle House   Brand new place. Only been open for a few months. It's similar to hot pot, but on a smaller.    Location: Between Dundas and College on the west side of Spadina. There's a few on street parking, but you can always park at the green P on Baldwin at the Kensington market. I believe it's $5 after 6 pm. 3.5/5 stars   Atmosphere: Not a big place, but can probably seat 30-40 people comfortably. No loud music playing, they did have a tv tuned to CP24. You can hear it in the background, but not loud enough to drown your conversation. Decor is simple. I did personally like their mural with the logo. 4/5 stars   Service: I must say, they have excellent service. They had 2 servers and a backup, who I believe was the owner. Very helpful in ordering they type of broth you should order. Did not have to ask to refill our drinks, they automatically did it. Since they are new, I wonder how long before the service dies down? I hope it doesn't. 4/5 stars   Food: When you order the soup, it comes with 11 sides which can be added to the broth. Put the raw meat first so it can cook in the hot soup, then add what you want. There are a few different broths, we had the pork and an original, they were not too salty, but also nothing special. They do offer more noodles at no charge. I also ordered a spicy skewered squid. This was a little disappointing. The squid was cooked right, but the flavour was off. It looks like they grilled it with this teriyaki sauce and sprinkled cayenne pepper on top. Didn't taste good with the raw peppers. They should have mixed it with the sauce. Overall, nothing special with the food. 3/5 stars   Price: I think it is a little overpriced, since their main dishes are soups. But the extra noodles is a nice touch. And I think you pay a little extra for the experience. 3/5 stars   Overall: It was an ok place to eat. Clean little place. Would come back to try other flavour broth. 3.5/5 stars  Follow me for more pictures on:  Instagram: 905japes Twitter: 905Japes"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get cross bridge noodles in Chinatown. The price is very reasonable for a very filling meal. The soup bases are all very flavorful, and the noodles have great texture, not to mention the unlimited noodle refill. Great for a student budget.   I usually get the shredded pork and pickled cabbage soup. Usually, the meatiness of the soup would be covered by the pickled cabbage taste, but here, you can distinctively taste the pork, and it's delicious. I've also tried the spicy and sour soup, but that one tasted a bit more artificial. You get a standard set of toppings in little dishes that you mix into the boiling cauldron of soup first, followed by the bowl of noodles. The noodles gradually soak up the flavors from the soup. One order of noodles is more than enough to satisfy most people. The popcorn chicken and smashed cucumber in garlic sauce are good choices for sides.  This place gets quite busy with students, but there's ample seating so the wait time doesn't get too bad. The tables are quite close to each other, so getting in and out can be a bit uncomfortable for those with the inside seat. Other than that, not too much complaints. It's by no means fine dining, but it's hearty meal for a good price."}
{"text":"As a noodle lover, had to try this place out. I've been to a similar concept noodle place and ordered the same soup base - pickled vegetable. I found the toppings to put into the noodles were right up my alley which made the experience more enjoyable. The soup came piping hot which is always nice. The best part is obviously the free refills of noodle which at this visit, I didn't really order an extra order as I usual do. However, I still enjoyed my meal. The service was quick, toppings had a good variety of items (meats and veggies) and soup base was tasty. I will be coming back here for a quick hotpot-like noodle fix!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after shopping, great prices, lovely atmosphere. The staff was very pleasant and the food was great. We got their regular noodle special for $8 and loved the display of the sides."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday and quite enjoyed this place.  I ordered the original broth with the regular set of 10 ingredients and it was really tasty. It was fun putting in the ingredients one by one and preparing my own meal. And then equally fun to taste each ingredient directly from the soup when it came time to eat it.  Though the idea of making your own soup with \"10 ingredients\" sounds like a fad, I would totally come back as the broth was very flavourful and well worth the price.   Definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"The beef bone noodle is delicious and lemon green tea was really tasty. But it could be more than one piece of beef bone or just a bigger piece."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this place. The soup was good, toppings were enough even though it doesn't seem like much, meat was definitely not a generous portion. Altogether it still tasted good though, and the soups are only $8. For appetizers I tried the Taiwanese sausage which was pretty standard. The Taiwanese popcorn chicken however I would definitely skip."}
{"text":"FYI: They get pretty busy during normal dinner hours (and honestly even a bit before then) so prepare for the wait or come early!  I came down with a nasty cold during my business trip to Toronto so my friend took me to this noodle soup place that she found on Yelp. Oh my goodness....we need one of these in Philly ASAP.  PROS: C'mon, 10 free toppings and free noodle refills for less than $10?? HECK. YES. The soup base we both got, shredded pork with pickled cabbage, was delicious. Super flavorful and had the right amount of sour tang mixed in with the savoriness of the pork. The noodles were cooked nicely but I still recommend putting them in as soon as they hit the table since they come to you already kind of clumpy. The soup base comes in this big cauldron like thing still boiling. You put the raw meat slices in first then load up on your toppings. My favorite was probably the quail egg and their fish cake (that's shapped like a fish lol). The fish cake is probably one of the best I've ever tasted. I got hints of sweetness mixed in with the savory fish taste of the cake. Absolutely delicious.   CONS: The wait is sort of insane. We came on a Thursday night and by the time we left (around 6:30ish I think), the line was starting to form and it was going out the door. Granted, there's not much waiting room in the actual restaurant itself but I would still recommend getting there early or going at off peak hours!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service. Both the employees and the owner were very helpful and friendly in serving us. The food is also great for the price (~$9-10), especially their lunch menu. I would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Toronto or someone looking for a new place to get soup noodles."}
{"text":"My new favorite cheap eats! Such a good deal...you can get a bowl of noodle soup for under $10. The soup will come in a hot pot bowl and you will also get a bowl of noodles plus a container of 10 items. (BTW...the noodles are unlimited) The flavour of the soup is fantastic. I do recommend the original. The spicy version is a little too spicy for me plus there are a lot of chilly flakes which leaves a bad taste when it gets stuck in your throat. They can get pretty busy especially during lunch time. I recommend this place over Dagu on Dundas!"}
{"text":"To combat the cold weather, a hot steaming bowl of rice noodle soup would do the job beautifully. Honestly the original soup base was a little too salty and the tomato soup tasted a tad artificial in the flavor, BUT it was no biggie since the belly and soul were completely satisfied! Also, it was fun to choose from the 10+ different toppings/ ingredients provided. I just dumped everything into the soup to make it more hearty.  For $10-ish, it was good value for what I was getting."}
{"text":"Newly obsessed with this place. Good value, excellent presentation and taste. Love the spicy broth and the shredded potatoes. Will be back to try all the other snacks!   They do take reservations, you just have to be persistent with calling. I reserved on a Friday afternoon for dinner the same day."}
{"text":"Perfect for a chilly night! Unlimited noodles to satisfy your carb needs and leave the restaurant with a belly full of warm and delicious broth.   The standard soup base + 10 toppings is $8.99. We tried the spicy base and the pickled cabbage base - both were pretty good. We didn't come home feeling parched like we would from other MSG-heavy soups at other restaurants - a good sign!  You can also add in extra meat for $2.99 - we added in lamb to ours but it was just a few pieces (4-5) so best to leave your lamb slice cravings to a hotpot AYCE place instead of here.  We also tried a cold chicken appetizer - this was similar to a hainanese chicken with some spicy / peanut sauce on top. Great app to pair with your soup!  This place is an affordable dinner option that's perfect for the cold weather. I personally like a lot of veggies in my soups, which I thought this place lacked. The 10 toppings had a good variety but it was only a little bit of each thing. But if you're in the mood for good broth and lots of noodles, don't count this one out."}
{"text":"I love this place. Its It's where Pho meets Hotpot. You pick your broth then add your rice noodles and 10 free ingredients. The side dishes here are great as well. I loved the seaweed and sausage sides. Two people can have a great meal for a total of less than $35 including taxes and tip."}
{"text":"Much better, easier and more filling than the hot pot style places, as each one gets his or her own huge (really huge) bowl of many things to put in. Ingredient are fresh and good quality. The tomate-base soup is my favorite.  Not five, as it is good, but not out of this world neither. I left OK, but not particularly eager to return or list it on my favorite places to eat. The renovated place of the restaurant looks really great. Behind the curtain (downstairs) is such a contrast... sad they did not revamp the whole place, not only the eating room."}
{"text":"The food is okay, interesting concept. However, the service is terrible. I'm rating based on the experience overall. The servers are so rude, unhelpful. I understand that it's a busy place, but they didn't make any effort to make it any better.   Portion size - good Flavour - good Service - terrible"}
{"text":"If you want hair or plastic pieces or bugs on your food - all found on our food tonight on our table, come here. Their original broth was bland. Services are average as per Chinatown standard, the waiters seemed too busy and rude to care about their dirty food. Would NOT come back."}
{"text":"Excellent presentation,very cool to have 10 little small dishes with the noodles. All you can eat noodles and soup for only like 8 $ plus tax n tip.  Nice little side dishes at a great price too.  Absolutely go there if you are in chinatown!!"}
{"text":"I honestly could eat here every single day (ask my boyfriend). I usually get the sour and spicy soup along with a side of the squid skewer.    Not giving it 5 stars because it's not the GREATEST food ever, but I think it is extremely delicious and well worth the price :)"}
{"text":"It's kind of like the best part of hot pot, but portioned out for 1 person. And the price is perfect. Just get it....so good."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?  Their noodles!  Comes in different broths (over 5 to choose from) that come in mild to very spicy. Each soup noodle comes with 10 different toppings you can add to your soup and start off with one dish of noodles. The good thing is...you can order more noodles if you want for free!   The broth comes in a mini pot that is enough for one serving. You can opt to share with someone else if you don't feel like you can finish the whole order yourself too!  I thought it was a neat concept with the mini pot and the ten toppings that come with each order. I ordered the signature broth which is mild and I thought it was very flavourful. The noodle was nothing that I haven't tried before. It's the same noodle you serve with duck called \"lie fun\" in Cantonese (if you know what that noodle type is.   We also ordered some side dishes on the side. Ranges from $3-$6. I thought the tentacles was not a good choice because for the price we paid, the tentacles were really small and not that plentiful. I liked the cold chicken a lot and the popcorn chicken was okay.   LASTP TIP?  I suggest coming here to try the noodle broth more so than the small dishes. The small dishes weren't really the main selling point to this restaurant. You can opt to order one broth and order more noodles if you want to save money and share with someone else!! The soup noodles are around $8.50-$9."}
{"text":"During a particularly cold winter night, we were walking down Spadina and literally couldn't stand to be outside anymore so we ducked into this place. What a pleasant surprise.  We ordered the rice noodle in Thai curry soup and added the beef slices as an add-on. We also ordered the popcorn chicken to start.  The noodle soup is excellent and really hits the spot on a cold winter night. It comes in a huge bowl so it's best shared. The popcorn chicken is good.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The food are great and is fun to add everything to the soup.  My kids love this type of rice noodles.  The duck feet and the spicy/sour soup are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Came here to confirm the legitimacy of the reviews. Very reasonable pricing but don't expect for super high quality ingredients.  The taste of the soup base were nice and cute presentation. Restaurant is very clean since it has just opened.  Portions are good for its pricing, noodles and soup are re-fillable. Would definitely come again for light dinner."}
{"text":"Fantastic small place with low prices.  Simple menu with check off what you want.  Loved it all for under ten bucks.  Service was fast and helpful."}
