{"text":"I've been watching this restaurant get put up for months now and took a friend to lunch today. 

The place seems to have a nice patio but we ate inside. I was told to pick any table but a lot of them were crumby and needed wiped down. I had to wait for the hostess/ server to come and tell me that since she and the cook were the only ones there and there was no signage to tell me that. 

Tea is listed on the menu but it doesn't  say whether it's hot or iced. Either way, my friend asked for iced tea and we were told they didn't have iced. The waitress said they didn't even have teabags. 

So I got the $9.50 steak philly and subbed onion rings for fries for an extra $0.75 (which is actually pretty cheap) and asked for no mushrooms. My friend got the $7.50 hamburger since they only have Swiss and White American cheese. He said he asked for it plain and with bacon. I don't remember if he did or not, but the burger came out with the tomatoes etc. The waitress was nice enough about taking it back and they made him a fresh one which came out right away. 

His hamburger platter was overpriced and so was my sandwich. 

The patty was obviously a frozen one, and while the quality and temperature of my sandwich were good, the flavor fell flat. 

Bacon on a hamburger should not cost as much as a side of bacon ($2.) $2 for a 16 oz fountain drink seems kind of steep too. 

I appreciate the fact that new businesses are moving into the neighbourhood, but if we drop $23 and some change on Lunch with no alcohol involved, that's too high a price point for the area."}
{"text":"It was my first time here & it was quite nice! The food was slow but good, and they apparently do a good amount of take out service. There was a constant stream of people in and out for food. The atmosphere was nice, the place was clean and the owner walked around and made sure we were happy with our food and drinks - we were!!"}
{"text":"Best thing on the menu here is the Corned Beef, but honestly there are tons of other places where you can get better. That aside the food is average at best. The burger I ordered had a weird after taste, then another time I ordered shrimp Alfredo. That was a real bad idea. The shrimp looked like it was from a can, and the sauce came from a can as well. All bad. It's a good place to get a beer and shoot a game of pool. But I wouldn't recommend coming hungry."}
