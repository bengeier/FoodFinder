{"text":"Family owned, friendly staff, a whole lot of simple flavorful dishes. A definite hidden gem on Albion and Islington. I usually do takeout and boy do they pack it up!"}
{"text":"I based my decision to come here based on the reviews. I was extremely disappointed at the lack of honesty these reviews left. 

We ordered chicken spring rolls, coconut milk chicken soup, green curry, cashew chicken with vegetables, and white rice. 

The spring rolls were oily and the chicken was dry. The green curry was flavourful, chicken was dry. Cashew chicken, cashews were burnt and the chicken was dry. The white rice was overcooked. 
The coconut soup was too sour and the chicken was dry. There was big chunks of mushrooms, they were still cold and seemed like they were just thrown into the soup.

I informed the waiter that I was unhappy with the soup and if there was anything else I could get in exchange. He replied very rudely that because I tasted the food and they have to throw it out I had to pay for it.
I agreed to pay and asked for a different soup. 
The owner came out shortly and starting yelling at me that they made their food fresh and if I didn't like her soup I shouldn't have ordered it because I wasted her time and her food since they only cook when there's orders. Which I don't understand since I had agreed to pay for the food. Well, she immediately ruined my appetite. Very unprofessional. They didn't come to the table for the whole meal and didn't refill our drinks. We had to approach them to pay the bill and get take out containers. 

Overall a horrible experience, do not recommend. I am never returning."}
{"text":"This is a nice Thai restaurant. A great option in the area. It is a family run restaurant. The mother is very kind and friendly. The son helps serve but is not focused. You may need to flag him down for more water. That being said the food is very good. I especially enjoy the pumpkin curry. There aren't a lot of great sit down restaurants in the area, so it is a nice option."}
{"text":"Ordered 5 Pad Thai, some curries, and spring rolls. Curry and spring rolls were pretty good but the portions on everything were tiny for the price and quality. There was more curry than rice. 

The pad Thai was horrible, there was no tofu, no beansprouts, no eggs, and no peanuts, unlike what they show on the website. Just sickly sweet noodles with 2 shrimps and a few rubbery pieces of chicken each. Will never be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This was a tough one. I actually had this review saved and tossed-and-turned between a two or three star rating. In the end, my experience could have been a lot better, but I get this is a small, family run restaurant (one star). And, the food is delicious (you can imagine the family cooking for you...another star). But that's about it.

I was in the area and didn't feel like any big-chain type of restaurants, so thanks to Yelp, the search brought my bf and I to a small, unassuming plaza.

This restaurant was EMPTY when we arrived. I was a bit apprehensive (as in would the food be fresh?), but I was hungry and we were promptly seated by a young man. It quickly appeared that he was the son of the owners and I thought what a good son to be helping out his family on a Friday night. He had a computer station in the back and it seemed he was part-time studying (or something else) and part-time serving. He wasn't the best server.

Food. The fresh spring rolls were TO DIE FOR! At the end of the night, I thought if I ever came back here, I would just order these spring rolls and that's it. Fresh, still warm and the skin was soft and chewy. We also put in an order for a Vegetable Soup, fried whole fish with vegetables, and a Lemon Grass Pad Thai. The rest of the food was okay...but I have to say it was \"clean' food. What I mean was that the fish and pad Thai were not doused heavily in sauce, which is the way I like my food. I didn't feel heavy after eating.

When we were eating, a HUGE group of 20 came in and I overheard something about \"we made reservations yesterday.\" Then, the \"mother\" came out and started pulling tables together to make room. I was thinking to myself, couldn't you have done this ahead of time?

Overall, I would recommend this place for takeout. In-house dining can be frustrating because service is non-existent. I get the son sees this as part-time, but he seemed agitated at working. We were lucky that we had submitted our order before the big group, otherwise, our food would have been some time to come out. 

I can't begrudge a small, family, owned restaurant, especially when the food is good. I would consider takeout. And it doesn't seem like there is another Thai restaurant in the near vicinity, so this is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Food here is very good, i personally love their chicken pad thai! My family also loves their beef pad sew! The mother gives excellent service, although when the son serves you he doesnt really pay much attention so you'd have to ask for refills. Overall great thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love this gem... Best Thai in Toronto IMO..

If they ran it more like a business in sure you wouldn't get a seat because the food and cooking is really good.

Service sometimes is slow and if they are busy remember it's a small facility business."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I was expecting the food to be good but it was really bad.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We got a restaurant pick up from here a few weeks back. We went for Veggie Cold Rolls and a Veg & Tofu Massaman Curry. Veggie Cold Rolls were really good. The stuffing was good and was seasoned great. Veg & Tofu Massaman Curry, which is a Thai-style Massaman curry made with coconut milk as its base, potatoes, white onions, and peanuts) was good too - nothing amazing but good enough. Overall, a good meal within $20. The staff is okay - not too friendly but good at their work. The speed of service was good - probably just took about 15-20mins to get the entire order ready."}
{"text":"This place is a best kept secret!  Hidden in a small strip mall in Etobicoke, it's a cute little restaurant owned by a Thai family (who have really cute kids running in and out of the kitchen)  The dishes are made from scratch with really fresh ingredients.

We ordered the thai fresh rolls with vegetables, which were perfect.  Shrimp crackers with nary a trace of grease, with an excellent peanut sauce with just a hint of spice.  Pineapple rice was good, mango salad had just the right tang and texture and the onions were nice and mild.  Coconut rice was aromatic and creamy but not soggy.  The only thing that could've been slightly better was the stir fried garlic beef - it just didn't do anything for me.  

The food takes awhile since it's from scratch, but well worth the wait!  The decor is pseudo tropical with lots of bamboo hovering around the edge of the walls, but it works perfectly.  

Dinner for 4 of us was $80."}
