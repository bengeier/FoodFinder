{"text":"We came to see the Cavs game with fellow Cleveland fans. We were not disappointed. Great beer and appetizers."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and game day specials and prices. Plus great daily and lunch specials. Also the staff is friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"Went there on New Year's Eve. They had a limited menu of food. We got the spinach and artichoke dip, which was great! The bartender took care of us and was fantastic. I was expecting her to ignore us as we were at a table and not the bar, but she did a wonderful job. Very attentive and welcoming. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"A local spot with staying power. Unique eats, good draft selections and specials. Owned by locals who know what it means to have a local gathering spot in the area. Always ask about their food and draft specials."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall that went by previous names and many other owners is now another great place to hang out. With a small at home setting and friendly staff like the waitress Bekah your sure to get a good drink and some good food. Although I don't know the number to the joint, I should have provided an accurate address."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've tried a bar called \"Sports Fanatics \" to watch an Indians game.  Hip hop music playing very loudly the whole time.  No sounds from the  game.  The song playing right now says \"I want to fuck you\" for the chorus over and over.  The bartenders are so slow and could not care less about service."}
{"text":"There is nothing, I repeat nothing 'fanatical' about TRYING to watch an Indians game here.  This was my second attempt to watch baseball at \"sports fanatics\".  Sure, they have team stuff on the walls and the bar staff wear ref shirts but let me tell you: you will not hear a game here.  Instead- you'll get hip-hop, Top 40 music blasting from the jukebox.  The songs include such sport-themed lyrics about \"I wanna fuck her\", \"smack it on the dance floor\" and other game time pep songs.  If you want to be a bar that plays top 40 music & has TVs on in the background - go ahead, people enjoy that, but don't refer to yourself as a Sports Bar when you can't hear any commentary about local sports games.  The bar tenders might want to drink a cup of coffee or 2 before their shifts: apathy & indifference to non-regular customers isn't a way to get more than a 10% tip."}
{"text":"Bouncers beat the crap out of a family member because he went to smoke and they thought he was walking out on his bill even though 8 people who were still at that table told them otherwise. Also Willowick police watched security cameras and confirmed this and fact that barmaids were stealing patrons cash off of the bar while heads were turned. Truly a white trash hole"}
{"text":"Great place!!  We're in town from California and wanted to find a local place to watch the 49er game.  Joyce, the owner's mom, was super nice and put the game on for us in a quieter room in the back.  Pretty good pub food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere food and beer selection. The cheerleader outfits are very outdated and not a very good gimmick."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood bar/restaurant. Bar for obvious reasons but plenty of seating away from the bar if you wanted to take the kids. Locally owned, great staff good basic menu including apps, burgers, pizza, sandwiches, wraps, etc etc. Tuesday is wing night (.50) good happy hour deals daily. No complaints."}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out while on business in the Cleveland area.  The reviews all seemed so positive, especially with the draft selection.  Well, I was highly disappointed.  The beer selection was lame.  Cleveland is really growing around the craft beer industry and I expected to find some good local choices.  My best option was a Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold, which I can get just about anywhere.  This tap seemed a little warm.  

Now, just so the Clevelanders who read this do not think I am biased, I grew up close to Cleveland.  I attended many an Indians game and was fortunate enough to meet Mark Price back in the day.  I even spent a lot of time at Richfield Coliseum watching the Force and the Crunch.  So I am not some guy from Cincinnati coming into town to bash on the Cleveland people.  But, if you are going to call your place Sports Fanatics, you should have more options on the televisions.  All but one T.V. was tuned to the Indians game where they were getting trounced by Seattle.  The other tube had a replay of the Cavs game from the night before.  There are more than those two sports going on right now.  How about some Stanley Cup Hockey Finals?!?!?!

I also agree with an earlier post that the servers wearing Cheerleader Outfits is a little outdated.  It did, however, show off some of their impressive ink."}
