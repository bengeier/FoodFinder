{"text":"Recently opened nice little place. The food selection is good and not too exhaustive. The quality of food is amazing., We ordered the kabab Chelo and it came with salad, enough rice and the presentation was great. We also ordered the lamb shank. The meat was falling off the bone.Very juicy and nice presentation ! Definitely a recommended visit for any persian food lover in Mississauga !!!!"}
{"text":"We recently discovered this little Persian restaurant that offers some of the best Persian dishes on the planet!!! If you eat Persian you know there are no authentic Persian restaurants in Mississauga. There's a couple of restaurants in Oakville and Burlington but not much in Mississauga. Shahyad is located in Mississauga about 10 minutes from Square One. It is owned by Persians so this is real deal not an Afghan owned place that tries to pass as Persians, the food is different if you are well familiar with Persian food...(it also helps if your spouse is from Iran!!!). We ordered two gheimeh stews, two koobideh meals and my favourite appetizer kashke bademjoon. To drink we bought our usual carbonated doogh. Entire bill came to
$45 considering all of these portions. I think the price is reasonable considering how tasty and fresh the food is! For example the koobideh comes with 2 beef skewers, salad and a generous portion of rice. It's not a question if we will return back, it's when, and I know it'll be very soon. I love this place and I am glad it's in Mississauga!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, as authentic as it can gets. Simple cafe and appeared to have quite a list of items to order. Very slow evening when I was there so i felt totally comfortable with eating the lamb chops with my fingers. Good fluffy rice and nice grilled lamb. Salad was sad but wasn't in the mood for it so no loss."}
{"text":"I am rarely in Mississauga but it was on the drive back that we where craving some Persian food. This place was cheap! The koobideh kebab is only $7.99 and comes with two beef skewers with rice and salad. The place looks like hanging on by a thread since its not very appealing to sit and eat in (which we did) but the food portions, price and taste where adequate."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The meat was tender and tasty. Get the homemade Ayran for sure."}
{"text":"Tucked into a corner inside a plaza. Looks like a flashback into a persian movie, which I think, makes it all the more interesting. 
Coming to the food. I ordered the Soltani - a combo of barg kabab and koobideh. The kebabs were juicy and flavorful. The rice served along was okay, although I would prefer to have real butter alongside instead of the served margarine. I also ordered the homemade 'ayran' - a buttermilk drink.
The owner was kind and all smiles. Would recommend for anyone looking to have some tasty Irani kebabs."}
{"text":"My iranian husband and inlaws and I ordered takeout from here. We should have known it was a bad sign because their kitchen looked filthy. It was the WORST ghormehsabzi ever, it was a pool of oil. The chelo kabob was waful, the minced beef was PINK in the middle, and everyone knows ground meats should always be cooked through. The order came to $47 (3 chelokebab 1 ghormehsabzi). THE WHOLE FAMILY HAD DIARRHEA."}
{"text":"Small, decent, family run Persian food. The food taste authentic, and quality is good. I'm glad to have found probably the only Persian restaurant in Mississauga"}
{"text":"I live pretty close to the little Iranian town south of Yonge/Steeles in Toronto. I used to get Iranian food frequently so I have a good sense of what to expect. Sauga has a lot of middle eastern food but I believe this is the only Iranian place in town. It does not disappoint.

I've had Iranian kebobs many times so I'm not sure what to write other than \"it's legit\". The meats are grilled right. Prices and portion are what I expected as well.

For those who haven't tried Iranian food, you have your kebobs of various cuts of meat (lamb, chicken, beef). You can also get lamb shank or chicken with rice. They also have a few stews which can be quite exotic for those who haven't tried. The essence of Iranian food is probably saffron, which is what gives the food that pungent flavor. The seasoning is distinct from Afghan/Greek/Lebanese/Pakistani/Indian kebobs. I recommend it. Iranian is my favourite of all middle eastern cuisine. Glad it's available in Sauga."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, but the service is not.
You have to know exactly what you want other wise the cashier would lose her patient :)"}
{"text":"Its pure iranian food.  I could make a comparison between bamyaan and this place.  The only difference is that the spice Level was mild.  rice was all basmati plain boiled White. Staff was friendly, could see alot of persian people sitting and enjoying food. Kabab had 85 percent veal and 15 percent lamb which made it unique. I would definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Good quality Persian food. Everything taste freshly prepared and made to great balanced Iranian taste.
Have been passing by this place for a while, and never got to try it (place looks small and a bit out of mode from outside). But when get in, you find a little cozy place with high quality food and friendly staff. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"My first time here, I ordered Gheimeh.
Very disappointing. No meet in it and was cold and far from a typical gheymeh. I should have asked for kebab but in mediocre places, one never knows what kinda meat you get. I told them it's my first time and it was a very bad experience."}
{"text":"Delicious koobideh plate here. Served with rice,  salad, BBQ  tomato,  but definitely the star of the plate here is the koobideh. Well seasoned, juicy, fresh and perfectly cooked. Excellent kebab dishes, friendly service, huge portions, and very reasonable prices. This is a must visit every time i am in Mississauga, and I will go out of my way to eat here. The staff is so friendly and helpful in suggesting the dishes too. Definitely going there again when in the area."}
{"text":"I've been a bit hesitant to check this place out since it looks really small, is relatively a new spot, and there was only 1 review.  However, I'm glad that I took a risk!

There are quite a few Afghan/kabob restaurants in Mississauga, so it's easy for Shahyah Kababsara to get overlooked.  Unlike the other places, Shahyah Kababsara is Persian.  In fact, I believe it's the only Persian restaurant in town!

I ordered the Sikh Kabobs which is supposed to be a spicier version of their Koobideh which is basically kofta kabobs (ground beef).  It came with 2 kabobs, a large portion of rice, and a small side salad.  

Tip:  They actually squeezed quite a bit of white, creamy dressing on top of the salad.  So if you're counting your calories, ask them to omit the dressing OR for it to be put on the side.

Other friends ordered the Lamb Shank, 2 pieces of Chicken Thighs, and a side of Tandoori Bread which was good.  Those dishes came with Berry Rice as opposed to just plain rice.  Portion of Lamb Shank was on the small side, but then again, it was only $10.99.

Everything I had tasted fresh, but in comparison to Watan Kabob, the spices used at Shahyad Kababsara aren't as 'in your face'.  The rice is fluffy, but not as tasty as Watan.  Overall, there's definitely less salt used at Shahyad.  

And aside from the spicy green sauce that they provided to us, on the side, I don't believe anything on the menu is spicy.  My Sikh Kabobs certainly weren't.  So this is a good place for people who don't or can't handle spicy foods!  

Overall, I think the only thing they need to improve on is their menu.  There was only a menu posted above the register and there aren't any descriptions.  Furthermore, menu online seems more descriptive and extensive than menu at restaurant.  For example, online menu says they have a few desserts, but they only had cookies.

Would definitely go there again to try other things on their menu! 

Note:  Parking lot is around back of plaza.  CASH/DEBIT ONLY!"}
{"text":"I came here a few days ago with a friend and we ordered koobideh; these were probably one of the best kebobs I have ever had - juicy and tender with a nice charcoal like flavour.  Like most Iranian/Afghan food, the serving size was as large as ever. Similarly, The cashier was very kind as well. The only thing I was unhappy about was the 20-25 minute wait time - perhaps I came at a bad time. Nonetheless, I would give this place 4.5/5 for the quality of the food, the cleanliness, and the very nice decor! Well done!"}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and also part Iranian. I'm my biggest critic. In Chicago we have about the same amount of Persian restaurants there as Toronto. This place is not what I had imagined. What is the word I am looking for........Elegant. That is not what your are going to get. To give credit, the owners are super nice but I was a bit turned off with the quality of food. You go to Iranian restaurants for the food. You go there to be killed by their kindness. What I was in for was not that. I was disturbed when the owners argued in public with each other. Yes it was in Iranian. But, you know there are others in this world who know Farsi too. Take your conversation way in the back. I hate to say that, I truly do. On to the food. I ordered Chenjeh. It was some kind of meat. Not sure what. Definitely was not sirloin. On to the rice. If you are Iranian you know Basmati rice. The Basmati rice did not exemplify attributes of an aromatic kind of rice and not flavorful. What the heck! My meal came with Salad. What about bread or pita? I ordered a coke. My glass was chipped. No quality control, I guess. I didn't even bother asking for another glass. The owners were too busy arguing amongst themselves so I hurried and got out of Dodge. All in all it was Meh. I will say, this is the only Persian restaurant in Mississauga. So if you want to find others of better food quality and decor, go to Toronto."}
{"text":"The koobideh is plain. Not very flavourful. Not enough rice. Salad is ok, basically iceberg lettuce and a few pieces of tomato and cucumber. The owner lady is rude and the place is not appealing to sit. Does not compare to other persian restaurants."}
{"text":"Small, cozy restaurant. Nice open fire grill. They can cook amazing things on that fire. Be sure to order some kabobs. It's always tasty on an open fire."}
