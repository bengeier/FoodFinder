{"text":"Food is great I've been vegan and gluten free for a while and heard about the selection of food they had very hard working people if something isn't go your liking you will not leave u satisfied today I ordered a chicken philly cheese steak on gluten free bread I liked it so much for lunch I got it for dinner as well I was craving a chicken steak sandwich and this place is beyond phenomenal if you haven't done so check them out!!"}
{"text":"I love the chicken cheese steak with extra sauteed onions & green pepper. So delicious! The bread is so fresh!! I live far but its worth the drive. I recently tried the collard greens and mash potatoes both were very satisfying!! The smoothies are flavorful I always get one to go for my drive back home. I am considering trying the BBQ wings next time!"}
{"text":"Some of the best vegan takeout I've ever had! Lots of choices and all are delicious. Depending on the time of day and the amount of orders they have received, it can take a while to prepare. Its better to call ahead. Definitely worth the wait even if you don't.
Kind of wish they had a restaurant so I could eat in sometimes."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get non-healthy vegan food. I almost feel like it's cheating to eat here because they have so many options that are all like traditional American bar food, like a philly-stake, which is greasy and yummy.

The chili nachos are good and when you order them the chili is separated from the nachos as to not saturate them.

Be warned, this place is hard to find if you are not familiar with Charlotte, ask for detailed directions when placing your order. Also this is pretty much pick up and delivery only.

If I lived closer I would probably eat here more often, but it's good I don't, I seem to spend about $15 here on a meal."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but I'm trying to transition. And zizi's is one of the reasons why. The food is delicious and made to order and the staff is very kind. 5 stars for Zizi's"}
{"text":"I am not a Vegan but I appreciate delicious food!

I went to Zizis Vegan to Go and ordered the (soy) chicken cheese steak with sauteed onion and green peppers. The chicken cheese steak is great for Meatless beginners like myself who is trying to stay away from eating meat. The sub is made with soy meat and the white cheese sauce is vegan. I tried soy chicken before but Zizis soy chicken is the best; I couldn't believe it wasn't meat! If you're interested in meatless meals Zizis is the GO TO vegan takeout restaurant. Checkout the pic of my sandwich (prior to adding my ketchup) lol

The collard greens and cabbage was flavorful!! Don't go home without one of them or both lol. You have to try the mash potatoes BUT it's NOT POTATOES it's mashed cauliflower. Delicious! The mash cauliflower with Zizis brown gravy is perfection. The mash cauliflower is lite and fluffy. It's not like the heavy mash potatoes dishes I'm used too. I also tried the vegan macaroni and cheese. The vegan mac and cheese had a few kernel corns in it. It's wasn't my favorite dish but it's pretty good. 

Smoothies are Greeeeaaat!!! 

This place is awesome!! The location is far for me but the food is worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"We are down visiting Charlotte from Pennsylvania and were in search for a good Vegan meal, but instead we found a GREAT one.  I had the Vegetarian Delight and my brother had the Chicken Parmless.  We did call ahead to order, as some other yelp reviews suggested, and the meals were ready when we got there.  The people working there were very nice as well.  All around a great experience."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place and I go almost every weekend. It's the best vegetarian restaurant I know of hands-down. I have now tried everything on the menu at least once and I haven't been unsatisfied yet. The prices are a little bit high, but that is to be expected with a full vegan menu.  I recommend this restaurant to everyone, vegan and meat-eater alike. Everyone can enjoy what they have to offer."}
{"text":"This little place is amazing it has decent menu for being all vegan and includes smoothies and desserts everything my group of 4 had was amazing!!!! Don't know why the bad reviews.... I wish there were more vegan places by me especially good ones"}
{"text":"The first time I had Zizi's was actually to pair up the beer I was going to have at the Wine Vault. I got the buffalo chicken to share with my boyfriend, he got the philly cheese steak, and I got the spicy southwestern. Considering we were craving something fried, savory, and very mock-tasting, it was perfect! I couldn't believe how similar the textures of the meat were compared to the real thing (my boyfriend and I completely switched gears from meat eating to straight vegan a little more than 2 months ago). Anyhow, as we were eating and savoring every bite we were just so thankful to have found a vegan place in general here near Concord which is where we recently moved down to from NYC. 

We have been back to Zizi's several times and yeah I have to agree it's definitely not the kind of food you should be incorporating in your daily diet, hence, the fried-ness, saltiness, etc... Yet that is just the choice you have to make. You could choose to only have this food every once in a while to satisfy your fried cravings and you will be just fine. I also like the fact that the place is very humble looking. I know that to a lot of people they'd rather just say it is straight up sketchy but I prefer to describe it was unpretentious. I like that. Also the fact that it's a \"mom and pop\" shop so to speak, small, private owned, local, etc... The prices are good and I love their huge Vegan Pyramid displayed in the shop. I give Zizi's 4 stars for what they were trying to go for and for the effort they took to getting there."}
{"text":"Well I was pretty excited to discover an all vegan restaurant with delivery, there really isn't anything else like it. Having said that, it took them over two hours to deliver a simple order, and the food we had been anticipating was hardly worth it. The buffalo chicken sandwich was completly soaked through from the sauce and nearly disintegrated in my hands. My boyfriends tempah steak was small in comparison to the huge mound of cabbage and rice that filled his to-go box. And the smoothies were melted with hunks of fruit swimming around and milky in appearance. The best they could do was $5 off. I've been a vegetarian most of my life and I'll just stick to making my own meals from now on. Their service was so-so from the second we placed the order. I would only reccomend them if taco bell quit substituting beans for meat in their soft tacos."}
{"text":"Great vegan food but some kind of nasty smell came with this. Both meals had this strange small and taste and stick with us for 1-2 days. Not sure what chemicals or products are being used but I would not recommend. Keep it 100% natural!"}
{"text":"I am new to veganism (3 years) and I moved here from the seattle area.  So when Zizi's opened I will admit I was skeptical, being from a place where GOOD vegan food lives.

But let's just say I now have a \"zizi's problem\"  ...I eat there every time I can.  Plus, I find myself going out of my way to \"find myself in the neighborhood\"  

I even took some of my non-veg friends there, they had no idea the stuff was vegan.  The food is just that good!  

Highly highly recommended!  I suggest any of the entrees, but if you are in a rush...my preferred quick sandwich is that Chicken Philly sub.  Pure Comfort food!"}
{"text":"Ok y'all !!! I think I'm In love !!! I drove from  south Charlotte after work just for the vegan Chicken Cheesesteak(I've been craving it forever, ever since I had it at this vegan restaurant in CT). Anyways, I made a couple of substitutions, I opted for the spinach wrap instead of the hoagie roll and added grilled mushrooms and peppers and a bit of Siracha to each one of my bites. It was PERFECTION!!!! I don't think I want to know how many calories that wrap was. I literally died and went to foodie heaven !! I also ordered the fries(seasoning was yummy) and the collard greens(good but nothing beats my mom's greens lol). 5 stars ! I will be back !"}
{"text":"Would love to give this place 4, or even 5 stars, as vegan places are few and far between, but unfortunately I was unimpressed.  Will try again sometime, and hopefully it will be better.

Service was OK.  Not terribly friendly, but my order came out quick enough.  Decor is nonexistent as this is takeout only (not even benches outside).

I was going somewhere, and didn't feel like I had the time to tuck into one of their entrees, so I just got their Chipotle Tofu wrap.  This was possibly the most boring, poorly assembled wrap I have ever had.  It was just fried tofu chunks, a few large pieces of lettuce, couple of small pieces of tomato, and some BBQ sauce poured over it.  As I said it was poorly wrapped, and when it started coming apart, I got BBQ sauce on my hands and shirt.  At $7 this is ridiculous, especially considering it doesn't come with any fries or anything (even though they do have fries).

Now if I were to rate Zizi's based solely on this wrap, they would get a 2, maybe even a 1.  But reading other reviews I'm sure that their entrees are much better than this wrap (flavorwise and structurally), not to mention that this was so poorly made that I am convinced that it was a new employee or something along those lines.  Regardless, for whatever reason, I still have faith in you Zizi's, and am giving 3 stars until I can make it back for one of the entrees."}
{"text":"I was surprised by the take  out only but it works. Quick service and it was hot when I got back to Hville where I was staying. The Tempei steak was great and the mac & cheese was amazing steamed veg too. Good seasoning and price."}
{"text":"I found out about Zizi's on Twitter a month or so ago and had been looking for an excuse to get down to CLT to give it a try.  Luckily, two of us in the office here at the architecture firm for which I work needed to make a trip to Charlotte to visit the site of a future renovation job.  Knowing I am vegan, my coworker suggested I look up a vegan / vegetarian restaurant for us to try while we are in town.  I saw my chance...

I had the 'chicken' salad sub, which was something like Gardein cubed up and mixed with Veganaise, (lotsa) carrots, green onions on a great soft sub roll (it is also available on whole wheat bread) and topped with a bunch of very fresh baby lettuces and juicy red tomato.  I also got the fries which were served nice and hot and were perfectly seasoned.  My friend got the crispy 'chicken' whole wheat wrap with veganaise and said it was excellent as well.

Zizi's is quite close to the big blue Ikea store just off I-85 which you can't miss.

Note that they are only open (currently anyway) Tuesday - Saturday from Noon - 8pm."}
{"text":"As a vegan in the university area of Charlotte, I do have to get creative when eating out. So, I was very excited when I discovered Zizi's. I've eaten here several times. I really love the Philly. The eggplant curry is also great and the collard greens are fantastic.

However, the customer service really leaves something to be desired. Whenever I call to place my order, the lady on the phone is very rude. Also, they have a very poor concept of time. There have been a few times when they say \"it'll be ready in 10-15 minutes\" and I end up waiting 45 minutes to an hour for my food....and that's for take-out... It's way longer if you get delivery. It's the closest vegan restaurant to me, so I'll still eat here from time to time, but the poor customer service is enough to make me not want to give them my money anymore."}
{"text":"I cannot remember the last time I had buffalo anything thanks to the wheat and dairy and meat all up in it. But tonight I had the buffalo chicken philly on gluten-free bread, and Oh. My. Gawd. It was so incredible. GF breads have a tendency to be meh, but this one wasn't bad...especially when smothered in onions and faux chicken and buffalo sauce that actually tastes like buffalo sauce. 

The sandwiches come solo (and their fries aren't gluten-free...what up with that??), so I ordered a side salad. One friend who also got salad reported the balsamic vinaigrette was delicious, but I was so stuffed from the sammy, I didn't have room for my salad. My other friend got something faux-meat with mashed cauli-potatoes with gravy and mac and cheese, and he raved about it. 

The restaurant was hard to find (it's not by the Wal-Mart, but in a tiny strip on the other side of the KFC), and it wasn't even obvious where it was when we were nearly on top of it. The inside was really hot (outside in August was cooler), so we stood in the sun while we waited for our order, but it didn't even take the 15 minutes we were quoted, and they brought the food out to us when it was packaged. Excellent customer service, and even the customer in front of us couldn't stop raving about how much he loves this restaurant. 

I will definitely be back the next time I come to town. It's not often I have the opportunity to choose from multiple offerings--with zero alterations regarding my GFV limitations--and it was such a pleasure to not only have so many options but to enjoy the one I finally settled on."}
{"text":"Seriously THE BEST VEGAN PLACE! I moved to Charlotte a week ago and I've already been twice. I've had the \"ribs\" and the \"chicken\" philly sandwich and both were to die for. My roommate got the chicken salad sandwich and it was amazing as well. The MAC and cheese is hands down the best vegan Mac I've ever tried. Thank you for being open and offering wonderful creations."}
{"text":"Yummy Vegan Brownie and  the Cauliflower Mashed Potatoes were amazing!  Traveled a couple hours away to try the place."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in Charlotte for the week and prefer vegan restaurants. It was fairly  easy to find off the expressway. It's a cute place. Everything is made from scratch. They offer plenty of GF options. Our wait time was about15 minutes but worth it. It's a tiny place with little seating but were able to eat inside since it was past the lunch rush. No public restroom."}
{"text":"Affordable, compact but sufficient place right close to ikea (~1 mile). Perfect if you are vegan/veg. For the meat lovers, give it a try!"}
{"text":"i just stopped by zizi's on friday to check it out. i got the avocado/hummus wrap. it was quite delish!!! my strawberry smoothie was very tasty but wasn't very cold. which means they don't water down their smoothies! i will definitely visit again. i recommend you call your order in and then pick it up."}
{"text":"I had the beef tips and they were pretty good. I would go back but I thought it was a little overpriced ($12 or so) for the amount of food that you get."}
{"text":"I love ZiZi's. The food is amazing! I like to get the BBQ \"chicken\" wrap or the \"Rip Tip\" wrap. I think you will really enjoy the food here... even if you're not Vegan!"}
{"text":"I am new to the vegan food scene so this was my first time trying an all vegan restaurant. I ordered the Philly cheese steak (seitan beef), some fries, and the vegan cherry cheesecake. I got mushrooms added onto my philly. 

The taste of it was very different and took some time eating but overall it was pretty good. The sandwich was hot and filling. The fries were alright, nothing special. The cheesecake was amazing!! Taste better than the regular kind. 

I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant to try more things, it was small and clean and the service was nice."}
{"text":"We were really excited to try zizis and were not disappointed! My So got the buffalo chicken sub with cali mash, his was the better of our two meals by far. The seitan was very moist and not chewy with lots of flavor. I got the mango tofu and a extra side of greens. My favorite was the greens, so tender and packed with flavor. The mango tofu was just alright, rice didn't have much flavor and the tofu was much like rubbery stuff I make often at home. The mango was the star if the dish, spicy and tart. Would definitely go again, getting the buffalo chicken next time though! 

I will add that the service made me feel a little unwelcomed at first, but she warmed up after I asked a couple of questions and showed a little bit of passion towards the food. 

Lastly, I was thrilled that the food was SO hot. Temperature wise I'm a bit of a snob, but she did us right."}
{"text":"Thank God for vegetarian fast food!! Just because you're a vegetarian doesn't mean you wanna be a health freak all the time... and amen to Zizi's for coming to the rescue! Totally vegan menu with top notch ingredients to fulfill your comfort food craving.

I would probably eat here every day if it were closer. The location is not so great. Zizi's is located in a small brick shopping strip on Hwy 29. If it's your first time visiting, beware: there is no store sign visible from the road!  I usually make a stop here anytime I visit IKEA. 

Zizi's is carry-out and delivery only. Make sure you call ahead, food is always made to order and usually takes between 10-20 minutes to prepare, depending how busy they are. 

Decent sized menu for such a small location. My favorite are the sub sandwiches. The wheat bread they're served on is soft and chewy, mmmm.

My Favorites: crispy fish sub, philly cheese steak, chicken cheese steak (or the buffalo version if you're in the mood for something spicy!), chicken salad sub or wrap, soy chicken nuggets, berry blast smoothie, my boyfriend's favorite is the tempeh blt wrap with hummus

Not a big fan of: meatball sub, desserts"}
{"text":"Great service and the food is the bomb my husband and I just moved to North Carolina and it's so hard to find vegan places to eat out at while doing errands and what not. The wings and falafel are our favs! Will continue being Zizi's customers.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend (AKA Groupon) told me about ZiZis and I decided to give it a go. In a land of bbq, it's nice to see a vegetarian/vegan option out there. They are a carry out place and located right next to the WalMart (I had to turn around since I am old school and don't dig the whole GPS thing)

I got the cajun tofu strips and faux meatball sub since I figured they would be safe bets. I ordered out around lunch time on the wknd and didn't want to get an entree (and really couldnt decided since everything sounded amazing) The tofu strips packed a lot of flavor which I was happy about since I am a snob when it comes to spice and say the more the better. The meatball sub reminded me more of a chicken philly with the consistency of the \"meat\" and it was a bit soggy for my taste.

I will definitely be going back from hearing rave reviews about it and the variety they bring with their menu. They need ZiZi's #2 closer to Uptown!"}
{"text":"saw so many great reviews, and was sadly disappointed. first, the cashier was not at all pleasant. like no, \"hello, how are you\". & then was just blah from the time I ordered till the time I paid. 

*note they do not have a children's menu\"

then, the food. we got 2 go green burgers and a veggie burger. the go green burgers had absolutely no flavor. I thought it was just mine maybe, then tasted the other and nope, no flavor. I ate green mush with no flavor. the mush part I was ok with because I have made vegan burgers and know the consistency of them. but no flavor. 
the veggie burger was mediocre and actually reminded me of the veggie burger I've gotten at TGIF. 

then we got a mac n cheese and cauliflower mash as sides. seeing as we paid $4 each for the sides we thought (our bad for assuming) we'd get $4 worth of sides. we got $2 worth of sides at best. tiny little containers not even filled. 

mac n cheese really had no flavor to me, but the cauliflower mash was good. my favorite thing of everything we ate.

service wasn't pleasant, food mostly had no flavor, and sides are priced super high for what you get. 

maybe because vegan restaurants are hard to come by everyone likes this place. but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"We had the veggie burger and the grilled veggie sub with fries and they were really good. Fresh and tasty, we will return!"}
{"text":"I liked this place. It was nice to have some fried vegetarian options. I had the Cajun tofu strips which were great and fries."}
{"text":"I've bookmarked this place sometime ago and honestly didn't know when I would get to experience it as I don't live in the area and wasn't interested in taking the drive all the way to the area unless I had something to do that way which would be a reach.
Well that all ended when I went to have my hair braided and my stylist sent her new salon location which is in a suite in the area. I didn't realize I was in the area until after leaving the salon STARVING I pulled up Yelp and typed Vegan and my bookmarked choice of this placed appear as 4 minutes away. I was super SIKED and immediate went by. The cashier was sweet however when I started talking to her saying it was my first visit a man came from the back stopped cleaning the deep freezer and came out to the lobby to walk me through the menu and let me know the top items in each category. I was overwhelmed but hungry so I opted to start with a Pineapple smoothie and asked that they add Kale, I also chose the Philly Cheesesteak. I finished my smoothie by the time my cheesesteak was complete which I had wrapped to go. I wasn't starving anymore but once I mapped my way home and saw the RED all over the map (traffic) and the 1 hour and 10 mins home I decided to unwrap my philly and start digging in while parked and more while sitting in traffic.
The sandwich was super HOT and tasty. I am still getting use to the meat alternatives with Vegan eating as I can just have veggies and be happy but I still need protein so I'm taking it where I can get it.
I would like to try some other items so I'll be back when I get my braids redone for child birth next month. I'll update my review with the newness.
Overall very welcoming, clean and friendly place with an extensive menu and very busy as people we calling in and walking in back to back while I waited."}
{"text":"It's a little hole in the wall but a definite treat. I'm glad I found it. I tried two dishes: vegan steak and cheese and buffalo wings. I wish I ordered more wings. They were delicious. The food is a little salty, but I found most of the food in Charlotte is. Don't let that be a deterrent. Stop by to have your palate delighted. Next time I'm in Charlotte, this spot will be my only go to restaurant. I want to try everything."}
{"text":"Great food! The soy nuggets taste really similar to actual chicken nuggets. The lentil loaf is great too."}
{"text":"BEST VEGAN FOOD on the PLANET.

When people go in and ask which dish is good, I just can't help but laugh and say EVERYTHING. This chef has perfected the art of creating vegan meat. I LOVE everything and am addicted to carob shakes and the chicken parm sandwich. But the absolute best dish they make here is the southern fried chicken, yams & collard greens. The first time I had it, I went back the next day & ate it again.

I have not yet had the pleasure of eating here for breakfast or Thanksgiving, but it sounds deliciously tempting."}
{"text":"I was so hopefully of a vegetarian option however the girl up front was not very knowledgeable of different menu items, and did not give any suggestions. Sandwich was just . ok. Also not easily found. But maybe an off day. Ill probably give it another try."}
{"text":"This is the most amazing vegan food I have had to date. Such great food, it's hard to believe it's vegan. Will be back again, and again, and so on. The chicken cheesesteak is to die for. I kept looking at it again and again while eating because I couldn't believe it was vegan. A bagillion stars!"}
{"text":"I like the concept but as I sat and waited for my falafel balls and smoothie, I watched many customers turn around and walk away (due to thr lengthy wait). I had time today so I didn't mind waiting for my food to be prepared (although I didn't think it would take so long for them to make my items). For a (basically) take out only restaurant, they should probably find a more streamlined (i.e., faster) way to prepare the food (perhaps shrinking the menu or offering certain items only on specific days). Additionally they missed out on the sale of 4 smoothies (I counted while I waited) because they only had berry blast and strawberry (I really wanted to try their pina colada smoothie but they were out). The berry blast smoothie was really good (tasted like there was also banana in it) and the falafel balls were good as well. Whatever the white sauce was that accompanied the falafel balls was good as well. And, their prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"This place really wowed me!  I had the kale sub, excellent!  Strictly a take out place, but definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"BEST vegan/vegetarian restaurant! My meat-eater husband even loves it, so we grab food from here frequently. We love the falafel wrap and pizza steak the most, but haven't disliked anything we've tried. This is our go-to place for fast, yummy, and meatless food! I only wish they had a frequent shopper punch card so we could earn discounts or free food!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients.  Made to order. I'm eating my mango tofu as I write this it was that good.  JJ made my food and he was so welcoming and friendly.  I will definitely be coming back here.  Heard from people in the restaurant that the chicken cheesesteak was delicious so I'm coming for that next time!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Small takeout restaurant that has fabulous (vegan) food.
Brownies are not to be missed."}
{"text":"It's nice there's a place to get vegan food in Charlotte though the place is pretty hard to find.  I wasn't totally in love with the food, but when there isn't an abundance of vegan food available, even average food is like an oasis in a desert.  They are take out only."}
{"text":"This is really good vegan food. Our kids (6 and 5) loved the soy nuggets. My wife and I shared the Portabelo mushroom with a spinach wrap and the bean burger. We enjoyed the portabelo mushroom a little more but both were good. We are very happy to have found this place and will be going back again soon. Also, prices are great for this type of food and is even less expensive than most take out. No excuses take the healthy route for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Fantastic take out! Original recipes, with a great unique flavor. It's definitely not your same old boring boca burger. I've only had their chicken sandwich, but it was absolutely amazing. I can't wait to try more things on the menu. 

This place is mainly for take out. They only have two tables on the inside if you want to eat in. But the delivery service is pretty affordable as well as the food, so might as well eat it in the comfort of your own home."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while.  And while I'm not vegan, I do love all things vegetarian for the most part.  However, I'm not a fan of faux meat, so I didn't order anything of the sort.  What I did order was the Grilled Veggie Sub (on gluten free bread). My satisfaction far exceeds my expectations.  I had no idea this would be so tasty.  

I also ordered a smoothie and this is the reason that I only give this place 4 stars.  I phoned only minutes after they opened for the day and the young lady who answered the phone was extremely pleasant and helpful with my questions about the sandwiches, however when I asked for the Brain Power smoothie she told me that she had no smoothies for the rest of the day.  I questioned this a couple of times and she was able to whip up a Nyia's Island smoothie, which was quite refreshing.  My disappointment was that they have 8 smoothies on their menu, open at 11:30 and I called at 11:45 AM to be told they were out for the day.  I love fresh ingredients as much as anyone else, but that's a little extreme to only have 1 of 8 options.  Therefore, my only critic would be to make sure they plan ahead and at least have more than one option for the day.

Two thumbs up for taste and pleasant staff."}
{"text":"I'm from Michigan, but I visited this place while on a road trip recently, and I can't stop thinking about it. Probably the best vegan I've ever had. And I travel a LOT. I almost went back in and ordered more just to take home with me, and I'm still mad I didn't. I can see myself buying a plane ticket someday just to eat here, and I'm not even kidding."}
{"text":"Dang it, Zizi's! I did not want to be the big bad omnivore pissing in all the happy vegitarian's Cheerios. 

I wanted to loveyou so much that I finished lunch questioning whether I ever really needed to eat meat again. I purposely did not order a meat substitute dish for fear I would compare it to actual meat and not judge it on its own merits. But, man, my Mushroom Patty sub was capital b Bland. It didn't taste like mushrooms or carrots or spices, all of which your menu says are what make it. It DID taste like mayonaise (or probably Vegenaise) which the menu mentions nowhere, though I wish it did because I would have asked for it to be omitted. I even tried taking it off the sandwich so I could taste it apart from the bread, lettuce, onions and slightly underripe tomato. Still nothing. Sure it was filling but wheres the fun in that.

There were some high points. The wheat bread was delicious and the lettuce was some of the best i have had. I also appreciated that the onion were cut thin, presumably as to not overpower the minimal flavor the patty had. All this sort of amounts to the homliest girl at a party wearing a really killer dress, though.

One thing I know is that I'm going back for sure. I will consult with some friends who love Zizi's so much. I will find out what will wow me and I will order it. Because I know in my heart of hearts that they must be better than what I've seen."}
{"text":"I really loved the chicken parmless sub, which I ordered with vegan cheese added. Intensely filling, unlike many smaller portion vegan options elsewhere, and an impressive marinara. My partner got the buffalo chicken cheesesteak which neither of us were impressed by. The overwhelming amount of onions was most off-putting. The fries are just a standard crummy frozen fry, but they get the job done if you're a fry addict like me. I will definitely be back for the parmless sub, but feel nervous branching out with their other menu items."}
{"text":"Not much seating inside, mainly just for waiting on food to go. The food was really tasty. I do recommend ordering before you get there because it was about a 20 minute wait on my order, consisting of two entrees. I will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I recently went Vegan and have been craving chicken nuggets (of all the things to crave, right?) my boyfriend found this place online and picked up the nuggets entree and some macaroni and we were pleasantly surprised! 

The nuggets were crispy just as you'd expect nuggets to be, the \"meat\" on the inside has the texture and flavor of chicken as well, so good! 

The macaroni was creamy and had the consistency of normal macaroni and cheese, though it could use just a dash more salt the flavor is spot on! 

I don't know how they do it, but I'm SO glad they do!

We will definitely be back to try out the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Only take out but specializes in vegan comfort food. We got the Philly Cheese Steak and it hit all my nobbs."}
{"text":"Philly cheese steak was good. Avocado sandwich was bad. Too much \"mayo\", avocado had brown spots, lettuce limp."}
{"text":"My friend is a vegan and sometimes it can be quite difficult to find diverse menu choices for him when we go out.  I stopped by ZiZi's to pick up some dinner and actually had a difficult time finding it.  It's tucked away in the little shopping plaza right before you get to the Walmart on N.  Tryon. Once inside, there were actually so many vegan choices, it took a while to decide what to order!  This place is takeout only, but the wait for the food was 10 minutes tops.  Now that I have a menu, I will definitely order in advance.  Overall, the experience was very good, food was cooked fast and was quite tasty!"}
{"text":"Finally gave this joint a day in court.


Pros:

Generous portions. I got the fish and chips and my husband got the chicken salad sub and they filled us up quite nicely! 

On the sub, the lettuce was fresh, crisp and flavorful. Not like that horrible shredded iceberg lettuce you get on most subs anywhere else.  It really added a nice crunch to the sub. The sub roll was of adequate size and the faux chicken salad was delicious!

 My \"fish\" was not greasy at all and the flavor wasn't overly fishy at all.  

Cons:

Needs more side options. How about sweet potato fries or veggie chips? The fries were cooked just how I like them which means they 
might be undercooked for anyone else. 

It's only to go. I think a seating area, maybe even just outside would be a good idea. 

I would love to give this place 4 stars but the price would not permit. If our meals had been just a dollar or so less, it would have been possible."}
{"text":"It was our 1st time here. Changing our diet. It was Absolutely delicious!!  Going back today!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Zizi's was a hit and the eggplant curry was very tasty.  It's located off of N. Tryon and is pretty much a takeout spot.  They have many choice's on the menu, and I didn't have to wait long for my order.  I can't wait to try some of the other offerings on my next visit."}
{"text":"I am not vegan, but looking into it.  I had the avocado wrap, steamed broccoli, and mashed cauliflower w/ gravy.  It was really good considering nothing had meat in it.  Will most def. try again!"}
{"text":"I'm by no means a vegan or even a vegetarian, but this food is seriously so damn good I'm considering converting. I could this everyday, all day, forever."}
{"text":"I had the Spicy Southwest Burger.  It was delicious!  I wish you had a location in Matthews, NC!"}
{"text":"I ordered the super green salad, falafel, and brain power smoothie which was super delicious! The salad was super fresh and the falafel was amazing. I plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed several meals at Zizi's since discovering them through an article in Creative Loafing.  Lots of choices and portion size is good.   I've tried ordering in advance a couple times but it didn't matter.   They still prepared my order when I arrived,  which other than being strictly takeout,  is my main gripe--they are very slow.  I appreciate the selection,  location,  quality,  and attention to detail but I'm not usually operating on island time!  They could be so much better with a little more focus."}
{"text":"Had a falafel wrap.... decent.  Not the best I've ever had but good stuff in this meat filled world.  What really rocked my world was my drink...  some ginger blend I forgot what they called it.  It was a very interesting spicy smooth hot good drink!  Look forward to getting back to try more!"}
{"text":"I've been vegan for 5 weeks and by far this is some of the best food I've eaten on this journey. I ordered the chicken nuggets & fries, Mac & cheese, and cheesecake. I was NOT disappointed. The nuggets were crispy and tasted like real chicken!!! Both the Mac & cheese and cheesecake were good also. The staff was pleasant. My overall experience was GREAT. I'll DEFINITELY be going back again."}
{"text":"Food: LIT
Customer Service: Sub-par at best
Restaurant Appearance: Hole in the wall

Overall: The food outweighs the negatives...definitely recommend for vegans/vegetarians. Wide variety and taste great."}
{"text":"Small with bar seating for 4 and a small table for 2 but very good food. Will definitely return whenever we go to IKEA."}
{"text":"food was amazing. place is small... take out, ya know.... anyhew. had the rib tips and portobello in a glaze. absolutely fantastic. will come here again and again. just fyi, temporarily their phone is not the one on the website. picture shows the new one. call the one in the picture to order."}
{"text":"I like supporting vegan restaurants so I go here every now and then. 

This place is ok. A small take out restaurant with small, limited seating and no public restrooms (including customers). Customer service takes your order, but I usually feel awkward with them. 

If you're planning on buying a meal to fill yourself, plan wisely. Price point wise, I would consider it a treat every once in a while because it can be expensive depending on how much you're willing spend. I like to get full for my money but the more you order, obviously the more you pay. But sometimes I find a portion can have more to be desired. 

A sub sandwich (which is $6.50 to $7.50) is medium sized and will get you through your lunch break but I personally need a bit more to get satisfied.

The food I have tried and will rate for any curious customers:

Buffalo chicken cheese steak ($7.50): 
tastes delicious, spicy, cheesy, a little bit too oily because of the grilled onions but not too bad. Not big enough of a portion to fill me up but gets me through the lunch hour.

Chicken nugget entrees ($11) (which is different from chicken nugget appetizer): 
this is the entree so you get good portion (like 8 pieces usually for me) and very good sizes. It's served with fries. This is the only fulfilling meal for me when I buy it and eat it with rice I make at home.

Mango tofu entree ($11): I personally did not find the value of my money in buying this. Just tofu that was NOT soft, crispy, flavorful, just chewy and bland. Served with mango pieces on top of brown rice that was soggy from the sauce and at some points crunchy (and that was unusual and not pleasant).

Mac and cheese ($4): does not taste like cheese in any sense. I would say it's too subtle to taste anything. All I experience is the strange texture because of the pieces of corn added.

Mashed potatoes ($4): Very subtle but the gravy gives good flavor, but when I bought this there was not enough gravy."}
{"text":"We like to Yelp our way across the country, finding places off the beaten path to eat while we breeze through cities unknown. And you know how it is when you're driving long distances, the intestinal upset that occurs when you repeatedly fill up on fast food and sugar. As we approached Charlotte, our tummies begging for lunch, we decided to find a wrap place not too far from the interstate. And that's how we came to find Zizis, a fantastic little vegan sandwich shop with tons of GF options available.

We both had the falafel with veganaise, fries, and a coconut/almond milk smoothie and we left feeling full and good about having made a healthy meal choice. The place is just a little difficult to find, not easily visible from the street and tucked away in a shopping center that is perpendicular to the road. But once you find it, you'll find a tiny takeout shop with friendly staff and helpful information about the merits of a vegan diet. So you get lunch and you learn something!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Zizi's. First time, it was near closing time so I told the owner recommend something. I had a veggie burger. It was delish. Today I had seiten pepper steak with collard greens and yams. Everything was delicious! I'm new to eating vegan food. This will definitely be a restaurant that I visit again."}
{"text":"I am not vegan so 3 stars is a very high rating from a meat eater.  The good here is good enough that I would eat it again.

If you aren't vegan then I would stick with the curry and spicy items.  Although the cheese-steak is very close it isn't as satisfying as one with steak.

I don't know how much healthier the food is than the traditional alternatives, but the prices are very reasonable.

Where this place shines has to be the quality of service and the friendly proprietor.  I went in late on Sunday and he was all by himself hustling to get our order ready.  He had a very upbeat attitude and asked all the right questions to make sure we had what we needed for our order.

There is a little grocery section with vegan items on the wall.  I didn't get any of these but they are there.

Definitions of things used in vegan cooking were proudly displayed - it seemed this place was working hard to educate consumers on vegan foods.  As a non-vegan I really appreciated this.

The biggest downside is that this place is in the cut.  You can't see it from the road and if you don't already know where it is the GPS doesn't help you.  You need to pretend you are going to Hibachi express and then slowly go deeper into the parking lot.  You will then see Zizis with signage painted on the glass door.  I strongly suggest you use the street view of Google maps along with the normal map to get the exact idea of how to find this place.  We zipped right past it and ended up turning around at Walmart."}
{"text":"When I first came I thought this was vegetarian restaurant because clearly what was listed on front of the building (which is really no biggie) 

THE FOOD: 
The food is really good ( well what I had) I will get it again. I will go back BUT I WILL CALL AHEAD because I had I wait like almost 20 plus mins for my order. I will give them a second chance. 

INSIDE: 
 its really small I'm guessing that's why it's says \"Take-Out\". Only one long table inside with 4 chairs. And one table outside with two chair. The inside is very urban with a mixed of African and Jamaican decor, seems this is a African American business(nothing wrong with that, I like it). They have a sign for you to call ahead for your order.... I will do that next time lol"}
{"text":"I've yet to find a vegan restaurant that even comes close to Zizi's in regards to how real their \"meat\" tastes. I've only been there a few times, but I've had their \"chicken\" nuggets, parmless \"chicken\" sub, and their seitan pepper steak with their cauliflower/potato mash, and everything was very delicious. Definitely one of my favorite vegan places."}
{"text":"Been a long time patron of this joint. Zizi's is a great place for gluttonous vegans like me! Philly Cheese Steak?! Fish and Chips?! Ummm yes please! Try their brownies - you'd never know it was vegan! Very realistic and out of this world flavor! This would be a fantastic place for someone just getting into a vegan diet. It's not just brown rice and veggies y'all! Eat here!"}
{"text":"Fish and Chips were very good. Deff would get it again. Service was very nice and helpful. I had gotten lost on my way there and the staff was very patient with me and gave me spot on directions. 

I recommend."}
{"text":"I hate to leave one star. I love vegan food, and I was so excited to find a take out place in the middle of a hectic day. Unfortunately, my mother and I just walked out empty handed.
There was one lady working. I repeat, one lady working the entire restaurant; cashier, cook, everything. 
There were 3 people in front of me and more walking in behind me. The woman working was a bit frazzled- naturally so, since she was not only taking orders but also running back and forth from the kitchen to prepare food. 
After about 30 minutes of waiting, and after the lady in front of us was given an incorrect order, my mom and I decided to leave. $25 dollars wasted.
Also, there was no AC or restroom. Not the end of the world, but for a tiny establishment with many people waiting, it was very stuffy.
I'll try this place again, probably on a weekend to see if it is better staffed and more efficient. But other than that, I was disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!! We had the grilled veggie sandwich, Mac & cheese, berry blast smoothie, the collard greens were great! The chicken cheesesteak was the real hit. It was so good we turned right around and ordered another.  The veggie sandwich and smoothie were great also.  I wish we lived closer, we would eat from there all the time.  We loved it!!!"}
{"text":"i was quite satisfied with my buffalo chicken cheese steak sandwich. Buffalo taste was excellent and combined with the onions, soy chicken and whatever else was on my sandwich, it gave no impression of being vegan. i've had some crappy chicken want-to-be substitutes, but this was good. Most definitely will be trying Zizis again. It's the only real vegan option in Charlotte that seems to offer a nice variety of veganized food choices. 

i did not have to deal with ordering or picking up our meal since it was brought home to me, so no commentary on staff friendliness or what not. i will say, it is easy to pass up the entrance as we tried to go on a Monday (NOT OPEN ON MONDAY!) and turned into Wal-mart, giddy up, u-turn. 

So, Zizi's is one for one in my book, so far so good."}
{"text":"Came here today with a big group. It takes awhile for them to prepare so I would suggest calling in ahead. I love that this place exists in kinda the middle of nowhere part of town. I'm a meat eater, I think the best items were the simple ones like the avocado sandwich and stuff like that. But I did really enjoy my 'Turkey' and gravy, although the turkey part was slightly cold. I got the cauliflower mash and it was pretty awesome, the mac and cheese is also vegan but I couldn't taste any of the 'special' seasoning that it was supposed to have. Tasted a bit bland.

The carob shake was amazing. I would definitely come back here and try some different dishes."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to zizi's for the first time..so much that I could barley get out of the car.. Dramatic I know, but I have been a vegetarian for almost 6 years and I have NEVER been to a vegetarian or vegan restaurant before. I must say this was a great place to have a first time experience at!! I LOVE that it is vegan take out, it is so hard finding good places to eat when you are a vegetarian. I liked this place so much that I ate here 3 days in a row..my plan is to go down the menu and try everything. So far I had tried that chicken parmless sub, chicken Philly sub, chicken nuggets, citrus rib tips and the mac-n-cheese. (Not all at once don't judge me!) I loved everything minus the mac..but that's because I don't like corn and there is corn in it. Other then that, I would eat here everyday if I could. My non-vegan boyfriend even loves the food here and that says a lot for someone who loves chicken! I highly recommend Zizi's, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came on a Saturday evening with some friends before they closed. I had mixed veggies and cauliflower mash and it was awesome. They have so much here that other vegan places in Charlotte don't offer. This place is a must go for vegans here! They also have smoothies and TONS of food options that are gluten free, soy free, and other allergen conscious options."}
{"text":"come back to nj!!!! i miss all the good food u had, buffalo chix cheesesteaks, chicken cheesesteaks, chicken salad sub, meatball sub, general tso chix, salads, desserts, and soooo much more that i miss pigging out on!!"}
{"text":"Shown is the kale & mushroom sub but it didn't give me flavors ! Added onions & peppers but it was lacking so I added vegan mayo which amped it up also got a side of fries which were great but I visit Charlotte a lot so I will be trying other menu items"}
{"text":"This place is not playin'. Everything that I have gotten here has been fresh and delicious. I'm glad to find somewhere with such an extensive vegan menu. It is in kind of an awkward shopping center but it's really not too difficult to navigate. The staff have been very friendly each time I have been. I'm excited to try more of their menu in the months to come! Definitely call ahead though because everything is prepared made to order."}
{"text":"You MUST eat here, vegan or not. The food is absolutely incredible!! 

Wow, we were really blown away by how delicious everything we tried from Zizi's was. We ordered pickup and the place wasn't too busy, so everything was ready within 20 mins or so. 

We ordered the Cajun tofu bites, buffalo chicken cheesesteak, spicy southwest and tempeh BLT subs, with a side of seasoned fries and Mac & cheese. The tofu bites were sooo tasty! A perfect snack for anyone who loves tofu or might be looking to try it for the first time. The seasoning was great and the tofu was fried crispy, my favorite! My bf LOVED his cheesesteak and devoured the entire thing. He thought the onions were too stringy though and would have preferred less.  My sister and I split the other two subs and both were great. We both really loved the spicy southwest compared to the tempeh BLT. I've eaten many tempeh BLTs and thought this one was pretty basic and could have used more flavor in the marinade. It was my sister's first time trying tempeh and she enjoyed it. 

The seasoned fries were delicious but hands down, the best thing we ordered was the Mac & cheese. Now I have eaten and made countless Mac & cheese dishes, vegan and with dairy. Zizi's was without a doubt the best vegan Mac & cheese I have ever had!! I even enjoyed it more than the best dairy Mac & cheese I've eaten. It was creamy, cheesy and so deliciously filling. I would order an entire meal of just their Mac & cheese, I was that impressed. 

Do. Not. Skip. The. Mac & cheese!! 

Fair warning, the aluminum container our fries came in sliced my thumb open. Be careful opening them and order Zizi's ASAP!!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan by lifestyle but I love vegan food (go figure) and this is some of the best in Charlotte.  The Philly Cheese is delicious and just plain fun.  The chicken salad is awesome.  I really like that the menu items are named for familiar dishes even though, of course they are meatless.  The seitan in the Philly cheese gives a very satisfying texture and mouth feel.  The location is little bit out of the way for me or I would go more often..."}
{"text":"I am vegetarian and have never eaten meat in my life. I love this place. I have no idea what the real stuff tastes like but if this is what I have to \"settle\" for, I am A-OKAY! A couple of times, my philly cheesesteak has been a little watery. But it's not a big deal when I think about the fact that I can get healthy, delicious, vegetarian-friendly options. As a vegetarian, and someone who LOVES cheese, I think it'd be great if there were a cheese option other than the vegenaise stuff. Not saying it's bad but I'd really love some real cheese on a philly cheesesteak. I usually just go home and throw some on there and melt it anyways though. I would suggest ordering ahead of time, if possible. It usually is about a 10-minute wait and their waiting area is very small. It can be hard to find the first time. If you're driving north on 49 (N. Tryon), it's tucked in the back of the shopping center on the left past the Wal-Mart & Taco Bell. 

Other than those few small things, it's fantastic :-)"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZINGGGG!!!!! 

One of the few (like 3) 100% vegan restaurants in the Charlotte area! And I must say, this one ran neck and neck with Bean cuisine for awhile, but Zizi's takes the cake!!! Or cheesecake shall I say! Because that's what makes this place #1, the cheesecake here is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! It was soooo good a friend and I went back 2 days in a row and another time later that week! And every time we went we had like 2 slices each!! (Crazy right?? No it's really that good!!) and as a vegan it's so hard to find a delicacy like this and it actually taste like the \"real thing\" (and yes I used delicacy because...well IT IS!!! Try it!) and for a price you can't beat!! 



I'm making it my business to try everything on the menu and will come back with an updated review 

But so far I've had 
\"Chicken\" parm- FABULOUS!! (Try it with veganaise) 
\"Chicken\" Phillly -GOOD
\"Philly\" -GREAT
falafel wrap- FANTASTIC 
Mac and cheese - INCREDIBLE 
Cheesecake- OUT OF THIS WORLD (duh)
Fries - GOOD (can't go wrong with seasoned fries) 
They're hummus is yum, and so is their vegan mayo which is made there!! 

The atmosphere there is so enlightening!! I swear I learn something new about plant based foods every time I go! Almost every wall has a flyer, poster, or quote that's so enlightening. 


Seating. Now space is definitely limited. A few stools inside, and a table and 2 chairs which is sometimes outside. But I mean it's a take out place so it's meant to do just that! 

Timing. Just being honest, don't think you're going to walk in there place your order get your food and leave. This isn't fast food. No. You can't rush perfection!! So call in 15-20 in advance! Everything is made fresh and trust me it's worth it !! Just go on in, ring the bell and bam someone is at your service. 

But really... ring the bell (coming from experience) because sometimes someone is not always at the front. 

But overall to conclude this essay I would totally recommend this place!!! I have no complaints nor have I ever had a negative experience.. the employees are always so friendly and really seem to care about what they do!  

So give it a try!!! Vegan or not 
But really GO VEGAN!!"}
{"text":"I visited Zizis and found them to be crowded
And unprepared for their customers. I waited more than 5 min to even be acknowledged and then when I ordered my first selection, they were out of it. I selected my second choice and they were out of that too. I heard one customer ask for the status of her food as she had been waiting a while and she was rudely told that there are a lot of people waiting. In addition, they were out of napkins. Horrible first and last experience coming here. Very Unwelcoming and unprofessional"}
{"text":"Stopped by this amazing place on a road-trip from Maryland to Georgia. The vegan wrap I got was so incredible that I had to go on the way back to try something else and sure enough, it was equally amazing! Never thought I could enjoy some of the entrees they have (like BBQ chicken wrap, Philly cheesesteak) since I became a vegan but I was fortunately proven wrong. Wish there was one of these in MD!"}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch for my first time with a friend and being a vegetarian enthusiast I was very disappointed . Getting to this place was a huge hassle but what's worst was the service .. I ordered a Philly cheese steak sandwich with mushrooms and onions with a fry . When the food arrived I had my sandwich without the mushrooms or veganaise as I requested when I went in to
The store I informed a person that did not take my order of the mishap
She rudely stated we charge extra for what was missing on my sandwich but the person that originally took my order admitted to the mistake the lady was so rude and unfriendly that I didn't even want the meal she killed my appetite and I returned the food the lady gave me a refund and coldly told the nice person that originally had taken my order to throw my food away. So basically they lost what would have been a loyal
Customer over rude service and refunded 10  bucks instead of correcting a mistake that cost 1.00 I hope the owner of this place discusses the importance of customer service with the rude lady that spoke with me if they don't they won't be in business long not to mention the location is hard to find all I can say is best of luck to this business I spent my money elsewhere.."}
{"text":"So delicious! I'm visiting from CA, and this is super tasty vegan food! I highly recommend the Mac n Cheese and Buffalo Chicken cheese steak"}
{"text":"My food was pretty good... nothing to write home about. I think I should have ordered something else. Next time. 
I got a juice also. It was supposed to have ginger in it... and some other things.. I'm pretty sure this is mostly just carrot juice. It's also ok tho. Next time."}
{"text":"I order here every weekend without exception.  One of the only places around Charlotte with decent vegan options.  I've tried all the entries, and prefer the BBQ tofu and eggplant curry.  Their salads are all great, as are the cold teas and desserts.  

What sets this menu apart is the subtle, simple flavors.  The BBQ tofu, for instance, comes with plain brown rice which does an excellent job soaking up any extra BBQ sauce that hasn't cooked into hearty tofu squares.  There's no overloading food with salts or dressings.  I could easily eat here daily.

Some of the entries are hit and miss.  The fake chicken nuggets taste way too similar to real chicken nuggets, and one of the steak dishes resembles bologna (eww), but on the whole I'm happy to have sampled everything and was left with a positive impression on most dishes.

It's a simple pick-up/delivery place, so don't plan on eating there.  It's also prudent to call ahead because the meals take some time (10 mins or so depending on the item)."}
{"text":"After a failed attempt at finding Zizis on Sunday, I managed to locate it today for lunch!  I ordered the Baked Chipotle Tofu wrap.  I wanted to add avocado, but they were out.  Once I got back to the office, I inhaled the wrap without ever taking two looks at it.  DELICIOUS!  I will definitely eat here on a regular basis.  I wonder if they deliver to my office?"}
{"text":"We ordered the falafel balls, spicy southwest sub, buffalo 'chicken' cheesesteak and blueberry cheese cake for dessert. I've had way better falafels and I won't order these again. We did enjoy the buffalo 'chicken' cheesesteak and the cheese cake. The best texture of imitation chicken I've had."}
{"text":"We have been on the road for three days now, moving from Scottsdale, Arizona to Carrboro, North Carolina. Zizis made us the best meal we had along our route. I had the BLT wrap with hummus, and my husband had the Philly cheesesteak. We each had a smoothie. All for around $22. What a bargain!"}
{"text":"Great falafel and vegan ice cream!"}
{"text":"Great place to have vegan food in the university area. Their mango tofu rice is delicious. Plus try vegan brownies. Food tends to be a little bit oily but a great place for takeouts."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! I am not a vegan nor a vegetarian, but the food they make here is far beyond garden bland. The texture of their faux meat is pretty good and the food is packed with flavor. 

This place is really small, and mainly just a take-out place, but they do have a few tables if you insist on dining in. 

I am giving this place a 4 out of 5, because it takes FOREVER to get your food. I recommend calling in your order ahead of time, otherwise you could be waiting for a while."}
{"text":"The mac n cheese is good. The pepper steak actually taste like steak. OMG first time eating here and I will def try again. The smoothie was great also."}
{"text":"This place is great. Friendly staff, great food. I got the Philly cheesesteak and my friend got the veggie burger- both were very good. Was visiting from out of town and will definitely come back by here on my next trip!"}
{"text":"I've tried zizi's twice while visiting Charlotte.  The food is ok.  I am vegan, and it's great to find vegan options, but this place is kind of disappointing.  The food is kind of middle of the road tasting.  Last time we ate there, my husband and I both felt sick afterwards.  The people that work there are not friendly at all.  Both times I've been, we had to wait a really long time for our food.  If you want to try a great vegan place in Charlotte, go to Bean!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome service. The workers at Zizis are very friendly. I've been there three times now taking my vegan friend. Once on a groupon, once on a living social, and once with no discount. The food all three times has been delicious and I've tried multiple basic dishes on the list. I've also gotten a smoothy with each purchase. I would recommend to them to increase the size of the smoothies, ~$3.50 is a lot to pay for a cup even though it's a natural smoothy. 

They are a surprising five star establishment in my opinion. The reason I won't give them that fifth star is because of their seating situation. They are basically a \"take out only\" type place, which isn't a secret but it's deffinately disappointing. The only option for seating is one two person table outside. Their location is mostly the reason for this. There is no room inside to put any seating so unless you want to eat at the counter you better hope no one is sitting outside or you have multiple people."}
{"text":"Everything is so delicious! So easy to order, because everything is vegan. I want to come back and try more of their menu items. But our first visit here was great. Buffalo \"chicken\" wrap, veggie burger and lentil loaf. Sides of fries, cauliflower mashed potatoes with gravy, seasoned beans and mac-and-\"cheese\"."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm not vegan or vegetarian yet, but my friend has started her journey. We decided to try out this place as it is near our job. I got the Italian \"sausage\" and peppers sub w/ fries and i swear I thought I was eating meat,  that's how good it was. She tried the \"chicken\" and broccoli and really liked it. If you are vegan/vegetarian, transitioning, or just want to try something different you should definitely try this place out. The only downside is there was no AC and it's a long wait for food so call ahead"}
{"text":"Vegan food with a Caribbean twist?  Yes sir!  I've been here a few times; the only reason I don't come more often is because it's about a 30-minute drive.  The digs are quaint and homey but the food they produce is kind of outstanding.  The Soul Burger is delicious as are their wraps.  The smoothies are okay; although they taste a bit processed even though they claim to use real fruit.  Otherwise, love the food here!"}
{"text":"Finally I made it here!  It is hidden in a shopping center near walmart and a bit tricky to find, it doesn't even have a sign.  But it is totally worth the search! Like a magical treasure hunt that leads you to the emerald palace.

I have been craving some vegan comfort food and this place is all about that!  yup, even us vegans need some yummy belt loosening comfort food.

First of all the guy working the front was super friendly and helpful.  I was so overwhelmed by the options I thought I was going to have to order one of everything but he helped steer me in the right direction.  I walked away with the buffalo chicken cheese steak and a side of mac & cheese.  My eyes were bigger than my belly and it filled me up with leftovers to spare.  I like it hot and the buffalo steak did not disappoint.  The mac & cheese was great as well, they put corn in it which I thought was a nice touch.

Truth be told I'm addicted and will surely be back for more!  Thank goodness I don't live closer or it may become a problem.

Thank you zizis for satisfying my vegan taste buds and belly!"}
{"text":"I don't care if this is one of the only vegan restaurants in town - the food I had was terrible!

I tried a little bit of everything since I was traveling for work and had a larger than normal budget.  Chili?  Ok.  Chicken nuggets?  Flavorless and tough.  Chicken wings?  Burned and hard to eat since they come on a stick.  (to make them more chicken like? weird!)  Avocado salad was ok, but it's hard to mess up a salad.  The worst item out of the many things I tried was a southern plate of some sort.  I literally had one bite of mach and cheese and collard greens and threw it away.  Along with everything else I'd had one bite of.  It was utterly disgusting.

I wish any vegan restaurant well, especially in the south where vegan food isn't all that abundant, but seriously!  Serve some better food and show people how good vegan food can be!"}
{"text":"Great food. It is however take out only do be aware. But the food is worth the trip definitely!"}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying I am not a vegan.  My brother in law is a vegan and recommended this place to me knowing I had tried veganiam in the past.  I had the Philly Cheese Steak here and it was pretty good, but the fries were sub par.  When I was picking up the cashier was very friendly, but the atmosphere is awkward, very awkward to the point I would never dine in.  I gave this four stars because I want to order from here again, and also when I was a vegan I found it difficult to find places I could eat at.  I could go back to being a vegan and eat from this place every day.  If you are a vegan and especially if you live close you need to order out from here. I will try this place again."}
{"text":"The rib tips, mac & cheese, collars greens, and yams were delicious! The pepper steak was just okay as it was a bit dry... It took about 20 minutes to prepare the food, which isn't bad at all. I would recommend that you order the food in advance to avoid the wait time. I wish that they served more veggies (e.g. greens) with the entrees. Based on this experience, I would return for more delicious vegan food!"}
{"text":"Found this place online and thought of my vegetarian friend instantly. Turns out it is nestled in university area right near Walmart so we had to try it out ASAP. We showed up to the little hole in the wall which had 2-3 tables where we sat after we ordered. They were out of one type of soy meat that day so our group ended up ordering the chicken parmless, Italian sausage and peppers, and an avocado sub. We also all got smoothies which were super fresh and amazing! I drank mine while waiting on my food. We took the food home afterwards. It took about 15 minutes to make so calling ahead is probably a good idea if in a hurry. I was shocked how much like meat the \"chicken\" looked and tasted. I also enjoyed what I tried of my friends' meals too. I can't wait to go back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"My mom has been vegan for about 40 years now and she never fries anything which led me to be surprised that Zizis had so many (in my opinion) fried items.

We've eaten here a few times but:

I really wanted to like Zizis and I really wanted my daughter to like it too because we really are trying to eat healthier and we really don't eat much meat.

My daughter only liked one thing: the \"chicken\" nuggets. I tried one of the nuggets. Tasteless.

The BBQ tofu with rice wasn't bad but it would have been better with greenery (salad greens, raw spinach, something!) for the price.

And then I started thinking about how I could make my own BBQ tofu with rice and salad greens at home (several servings) for what I paid here for take out. Not good.

So:

While I realize they're not McDonald's, I think a small side of salad greens could be included with quite a few of their menu items for what they charge. Even salad greens as a garnish...

No seating and so-so food does not make another visit likely."}
{"text":"Right by the IKEA in Charlotte, which makes this location A+ for me. Picked up a dish and brought it to the IKEA cafeteria to eat it there before shopping.

The lentil meatloaf was very, very good. For sides, I had the greens (yummy) and mac & cheese (probably in the top 5 for the best mac & cheese I've had). This place is great! Looking forward to my next trip."}
{"text":"I had the vegan chicken cheesesteak with the brain power smoothie bit was pretty good. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Tempeh BLT and Pepper Steak is so good! Was looking for a good vegan place while traveling and was not dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Lawd! I've died and gone to vegan heaven. It's a shame that there aren't more vegan friendly places around Charlotte but that's what makes places like Zizis stand out. I'm still exploring their menu but so far some of my favorites are there \"fish\" and chips, \"meat loaf\" and \"chickn parm\". Man o man! The flavor of this food is amazing and I'd be cheating you if I didn't tell you to order the fries with the \"special\" seasoning. Normal fries just won't do! Biggest tip of all is to CALL YOUR ORDER IN. It'll save you some precious wait time because it takes longer than a minute to make amazing vegan food! Thumbs Up!

Sincerely,

One Happy Vegan!"}
{"text":"We got carry out from here last weekend (2/17) and it was a good experience. We both got the \"chicken\" cheesesteak and neither of us had any complaints. It was just so good. I'm interested to go back and try other options."}
{"text":"It's so hard to find vegetarian food, much less vegan. Im from out of town, but I eat here every single time I come to Charlotte. Buffalo chicken cheese steak is my favorite. This spot is a hidden gem. 

Edit: I have now been coming to this spot for quite some time. Unfortunately, as time passes, this place gets worse. The food is still good, but their employees are in a constant state of confusion. When I went in today, they were messing up everyone's orders, and my order took 40 minutes when I called ahead and they said 10. They need some serious customer service intervention."}
{"text":"For a take out only it freakin rocked. Smoothies and amazing diversity on traditional dishes. Totally vegan and extremely clean foods. 
A true Vegan jewel hidden in the Charlotte Sprawl. Well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"The chicken nuggets and fries are the best in Charlotte, vegan or not! I'm still exploring the menu, but so far I have really enjoyed every dish I've tried. I hope they can open more locations in the future. Delicious food!"}
{"text":"Let's not kid ourselves, this isn't vegan health food. This is get your mock meat sandwich on and be happy food. I've tried a few of the veggie entrees and they're just not what ZiZi's does well. Go elsewhere to get a plate full of wonderfully cooked veggies. Go here when you want something a little fried, a little sinful. I've tried several different things on the menu now but the real winners are the chicken tenders, the buffalo chicken sandwich and the spicy wings. I could eat the wings daily, seriously. 

Please call your order in ahead of time. You don't want to sit in their hot waiting area on a summer day (feel for the employees) and speedy isn't the name of the game here. The delivery service is outsourced and while handy, makes the process take even longer. 

I do hope they look into a better, easier to get to location."}
{"text":"So this place was a bit hard to find but once you find it you're golden. Started with the mango, pineapple smoothie and I also tried the 'berry blast'. Both were deeeeeeeeeelicious.

I don't know how much healthier the food is than the traditional alternatives, being that my 'meat' came out oily but it sure was yummy. The prices are very reasonable and on the low end. Approx. $11.99 for an entree with two sides. The food came out fast.

I ordered the rib tips and mac & cheese and collard greens. Being from the south I wanted the mac & cheese to be a bit creamier but the collard greens were very flavorful. Ahead of me in line were two women raving about the \"best tea they've ever had\" from Zizi's but I'll save that for next time."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Drove from Houston for a bite. Worth the trip!!!  \"Chicken steak\" sandwich is brilliantly done. My wife had a spicy wrap that hit the spot and the summer berries smoothie truly refreshing. I'm going back soon"}
{"text":"Tried this place out today after class. I got the buffalo tofu wrap, it was amazing!!!! Also got a smoothie with flaxseed. Loved that they had almond milk as an option, most places just have soy milk as a dairy milk substitute. This place has a couple tables but it's more of a to-go place which is perfect for me! :) The wrap didn't come with a side which I thought was kinda strange, but it was enough for me... Could kinda get expensive if you don't think just a wrap is enough to eat. Definitely try this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Vegan comfort food, fast!

I was excited by the prospect of an all vegan take-out place, so I had to stop here on my latest road trip.

Despite some of the reviews about order time, my order was prepared faster than expected. In only about 10 minutes, a lunch entree of seitan pepper steak, mac and cheese, and collard greens was done. 

How did the lunch serve up for $13? The pepper steak was the best. Soft, savory and flavorful. The brown sauce was delicious. The mac and cheese was pretty good, though not the best I've ever had. The collard greens were decent enough, but nothing too special (no flavor complexity). Either way, it was a good balance, as the dish needed something green. 

Overall verdict? The $13 price felt a bit high to me given the portion size. For a lunch, it was good food, but not completely filling. I know hot vegan food, especially made fast, is a bit of a luxury, but for a place that specializes in take-out, the cost/amount of food is my only minor complaint. 

With that said, I'd still recommend Zizi's to any vegan or daring omnivore in the Charlotte area. Call ahead, as it sounds like your meal make taker longer than mine, especially if it's a busy time."}
{"text":"Zizis is a great vegan spot I always go for the southwest sub and the fries are the best I love fries. Just make sure to call ahead if you don't want to wait. Also they have a pretty good brain power smoothie."}
{"text":"Visited Charlotte for a couple of days and this place is awesome. Highly recommend. No frills but good food. Meat eaters will enjoy this place"}
{"text":"B.y.c.i.. Bring your cup of ice! No ice machine,  no beverage options very limited. But  food was good, can they please turn on the air..it was hot as hell..my friends and I will come again."}
{"text":"There is nothing like a good smoothie! Initially, I requested the energy smoothie they were out. So I opted for the brain power. The smoothie was good but at $4 I need to be SuperSized not given a 6oz cup :-(. I will try them again but if quality does not equal quantity no more ZiZi for me!"}
{"text":"This place is very small inside. I'm sure many others commented that as well but I wasn't expecting it to be that tiny. 
The staff was ok and the place was clean. There were a few other people inside when we stopped in. 
We ordered a few things to try and I conclude that the sandwiches are quite \"meaty\". If you want something hearty, filling, and packed with flavor. I recommend getting a sub or a wrap. 
I also think the sandwiches are good enough to please a meat eater."}
{"text":"Hooray, they found a new delivery service that rules! 40 minutes, on a Sunday night, during a slightly scary torrential downpour = A+.

I've honed in on my favs. Fried fish sammich - delish - nori-wrapped soy protein, breaded and fried to perfection. Fish and chips use the same tasty \"fish\". 

Chicken salad - perfect. Lots of finely shredded veggies, dulce, vegannaise. I can't replicate it at mi casa, so he's got some secret ingredient in there.

Entrees have all been way yummier in person than they sound on paper - Chicken Parmless is ill, General Tso's is insane (a special, tho, so not always available), BBQ tofu super tasty. Buffalo wings still completely delish, I order them every time - they come with a subtle white sauce, some magical combination of vegannaise and lemon, maybe - perfect.

Hours have become more lunch friendly (11:30 on) and they're now open Sundays. Sign up for the weekly email and get coupons, deals, and specials (last week, tempeh sloppy joes! Dude!!)."}
{"text":"I find myself some nights just thinking about that day I found ZiZi's Vegan Take out. It's hard for me, I think I have separation anxiety. If I could have them ship me food to LA (though we have many veggie and Vegan choices, I hate the drive and traffic to get to them). When not traveling, I find myself preparing a lot of my own meals. I pine for those great dishes and amazing flavors. I have no doubt in my mind that I will visit This establishment my next time in Charlotte. I do hope that next trip I'll be able to find them a lot easier due to some new signage near the roadside.  Thanks for the great food and memories."}
{"text":"Had the turkey with mash and mac n cheese.  Loved it!  Definitely want to go back and try the citrus rib tips, and the philly sub.  Prices are fair: sandwiches ~$8 and entrees ~$11.  Fyi you will finish the entree in one sitting if hungry.  They also have a $4 cheesecake that tastes like actual cheesecake, whoa!  It's on the sweet side for me, but I tend to like lighter sweets.  If you liked dairy cheesecake at any time, this vegan version really hits the spot as an awesome dairy-free nom.

11/11/17 edit since I tried some new dishes after I'd written this review: 
Philly sub - flavor odd, pass.  
Citris Rib Tips -yum, maybe little too sweet
Eggplant / chickpeas - good, 2nd fav after the turkey."}
{"text":"First time having it and oh man it was good!!!! Makes me considering being vegan. During certain hours of the day there is a wait. But honestly it's worth it. Doesn't even seem like I'm eating vegan."}
{"text":"That Is You Ain't It!? Sitting Right There Wondering Where You Can Get The Best Vegan Food In Charlotte. Smile For Me Real Quick, Go Head You Know You Wanna Do It!

{"text":"In Charlotte on business. I've been eating Vegan for about 2 weeks so I was super excited to find this place. My rating is strictly for the food and Not the service. I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak per the recommendation, which was excellent. I also, got Cauliflower Potato Mash & Gravy. I'm not big on mashed potatoes but was told it was a popular item and was very good. 

The place is absolutely take out, no real place to eat, which is fine. However, I wanted in line about 10min to get my order in, was so slow and not a very good process to take orders. I was advised it would take about 20min for my order to be ready, which is fine as everything is made fresh. I left and came back and after 25min asked for my order and the gentleman that told me 20min asked if I already ordered. They forgot my order, and he then stated it's okay the philly only takes 2 min to get ready.  So by the time I got out of there was almost 50min. All I got was thanks for your patience. 

The food is great, but I would absolutely call in ahead as it's painfully slow."}
{"text":"First off, this place is take-out only with no seating area, so bear that in mind. It's also very tricky to find. As far as food goes, we both ordered the eggplant curry. You could tell they used high quality ingredients that were prepared well, and the portion was hearty (which was good, because we were pretty hungry). Flavor-wise, however, it was bland. It was undersalted and, in general, had very little flavor (even when ordered \"spicy,\" which wasn't spicy so much as slightly cinnamon-y). The folks running the place were very friendly, and I like supporting small, local businesses, especially vegan- and veggie-friendly restaurants. I think with a little bit of refinement, the food here could be great."}
{"text":"The spices placed on the dishs drives your taste buds wild. Love this place for a quick snack on the go."}
{"text":"OMG, YUM!! Started with the peace and blessings juice. So good! If you don't like beets, avoid this one. I loved it. I also got the Cajun tofu bites. Delicious!! Spicy but perfect! I also got the eggplant curry. With this being a take out only place I was nervous about the transport back to south Charlotte. It was packaged perfectly and was hot when I got home. So delicious! A lot of flavor. I also got a side of Mac and cheese, so delicious! Seriously can't say enough how delicious everything is. I recommend it."}
{"text":"I am SO glad I found this place! Food manages to be amazing as well as super healthy, and the service is just fine- they're just a small staff and busy, people! Jerk chicken, falafel, burgers... all SUPER GOOD. Such a pleasant surprise - food is crazy good! What a great hidden gem- will be back!"}
{"text":"Grabbed food here with my fiance on Sunday evening.  It was ok.  I am all about the vegetarian/vegan movement but was a little disappointed (maybe my expectations were a bit high).  I ordered the bbq tofu with brown rice and my fiance ordered the eggplant curry.  His dish was definitely a little better than mine, but mine was a little boring.  Cooked tofu slathered in bbq sauce and rice on the side.  The tofu was a little rubbery also.  We also got a smoothie which was good, but there was a large piece of banana in it that wasn't blended.  I'd definitely try it again if I was in the area, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to eat there (like I did on Sunday)."}
{"text":"Zizi's is the best food and best value in Charlotte. I really like the vast options and tasty techniques used here. I will never pass through charlotte without popping in and grabbing some sustainable delicious food. food takes about 10 minutes. smoothies 4. Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite vegan place in charlotte.  Was there for a conference and i got my vegan fix from this awesome place.  Loved the avocado wrap they had. It really hit the spot. If you're vegan, this is the place to go. I also had the falafel wrap and it was yummy."}
{"text":"We're on lent and needed a place for a restaurant that doesn't serve food with dairy products, we found Zizis which to our surprise the food was really good. This will be on our frequent stop list."}
{"text":"I almost just want to let the picture speak for itself. The gluten-free bread was so hard it only covered about half of the burger. The bread tasted like it was pulled out of the freezer and then microwaved before assembling my soul burger (probably what actually happened because it was so extremely hard.) It was absolutely ridiculous and I really just had to laugh at the whole thing. How in the world could somebody have the heart to serve something of poor quality and so disproportionate? The right thing to have done was to just say that the gluten-free bread wasn't available. Anyway, I'm glad I saved 200 calories. :) 

The soul burger was obviously made from scratch with blackeyed peas, yams, and collard greens. While creative, it was on the dry side, had a smear of what looked liked VeganMayo, and had no condiments in the bag or offered to me.  It also was playing hide and seek with me underneath all of the lettuce that was piled on top. Lol

I only came here because it was a Tuesday, I was hungry and on the road, and Bean is not open.  Anyway based on this experience I definitely would say do not come here if you are gluten intolerant because of the poor quality of the bread. For everybody else, just don't expect to be wowed."}
{"text":"The limited special General Tso was delicious, a tasty way to celebrate the special day! Happy Belated Father's Day to all the Dads/Fathers."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant which happens to be a vegan restaurant. The food is good, as well as this movies, and the fresh juices. If I could afford it I would be here every day."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to dip into this vegan spot \"in the cut\". On their menu, there are many options to choose. Noticed that the prices were a little \"bigly\" for takeout but I guess you are paying for convenience and awesomeness. So I decided to try the Soul burger and fries. Both items were consumed with great pleasure. I will be back - noticed that they have the options for you to call in or delivery."}
