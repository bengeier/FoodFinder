{"text":"I have enjoyed all the food I've tried at Rum Diaries. My favourites are the salt fish spring rolls and jerk chicken poutine... Yumm... Thursday live music is also great for a nice night out in Durham."}
{"text":"The food here is really good but it's hard to enjoy it when the service is absolutely horrible. This place is severely short staffed and clearly needs to hire more people for the kitchen. We waited an hour for our meals, 20 minutes for our drink orders to be taken and for some reason different bartenders made the same drink completely different. Our server did the best that he could but it was evident that there was too much going on. The wait times were unacceptable and this place needs to find ways to improving their workflow. If you have time to WASTE then I would suggest this restaurant. If not, go to an establishment that can handle customer traffic."}
{"text":"Was here 2 nights ago for a friend's bday. The waitress took over half hour to introduce herself and bring us water. Keep in mind this is a Wed afternoon and the restaurant is empty. 
The group was late and there were only 3 of us. When we requested to be served drinks we were denied and literally had to beg for a drink. 
While ordering our food the waitress did not know what's the soup of the day... Her excuse was she just got in... Keep in mind this is an hour and a half later since we were seated. Also, the host of the group ordered some appetizers to be served and the waitress wasn't aware that there was a pre order. 
Not trying to bash the waitress here but be on top of your game... It's your job to be. 

As for the food it was pleasing to the eye but terrible on the pallet. The only food here that was good is the wings and spring rolls. I ordered the stuffed snapper which  was dry and rubbery, as for flavor there was none. The curry in the cassava mash was terrible... Tasted like some curry powder diluted in water and thrown over the mash. 
My fish was only warm partially which is strange as the orders came out pretty quickly. Makes me wonder if the food was even prepared fresh. 

Do not recommend you go here at all. The food is definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Great food! I had the Braised Beef Short Ribs which was full of flavour. For dessert we had the waffle and vanilla ice cream which was way better than I was expecting. My only complaint is that the service was kind of slow, other than that, it was a good dining 
experience."}
{"text":"Our waitress did her best but service was slow & meh. Food was worse than bleh. Cold AND burnt food...
Drinks were inconsistent, appetizers didn't come out together, when/if mains finally came out, they were cold. By the time the food arrived, people around us were asking for take-out containers. 
Come for dine-in, end up with take-out."}
{"text":"Food: The chef does a wonderful job at incorporating Caribbean flavours into each dish. 

The Callaloo Dip was thick and creamy. It's a tasty spin to regular spinach dip. 

The Seafood Gumbo was made with fresh mussels, shrimp and scallops. We were impressed with the freshness of the seafood. The curry sauce was a perfect blend of curry and Caribbean spices. 

The Jerk Chicken Coconut Linguini was delicious, packed full of spicy jerk sauce that had layers of intense flavour.

*The portions seemed a bit small and I wished the entrees came with some bread to soak up all the sauces. 

 I highly recommend the rum cake which was rich, moist and packed with sweet rum flavour. The rum butter drizzle on top took me to cloud 9.

There's an extensive drink menu featuring various rums. 

Service: our waiter was very attentive and friendly. We came on a weeknight for dinner and there were only a few tables occupied. 

Atmosphere: modern, chic, romantic

Family-Friendly: kids menu for $7 available, *although it would be better if the meals included some veg 

Price:  This place is more upscale so menu prices are set a bit higher with appez around $11-15 and entrees around $20-30. I would recommend this place for special occasions or a night out for drinks/dessert."}
{"text":"I came here once with my partner and our baby. We ordered the jerk chicken poutine - the sauce was too much and they took it back. We had a few drinks and I ordered a curry seafood dish. It was Trinidadian style curry, with generous pieces of lobster, shrimp and scallops - all cooked to perfection. The serving was large - I took it home and it was lunch the next day. That being said, I'm West Indian (not from Trinidad) and I'm not a fan of Trini curry. Even though I didn't like the curry itself, I really liked the seafood.

 We came on a Thursday and there was a live singer who sounds exactly like John Legend. The ambiance was fantastic.  

It's a beautiful restaurant and the patio is nice too. The service is a bit slow, but I think it's because they cook their food fresh to order (at least my meal tasted like it was cooked fresh to order). 

I would return."}
{"text":"Thursday evenings are great! Happy hour from 6-8pm. Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I would NEVER go back to this establishment again! Wouldn't give them even a penny of my money! After attempting to \" give it one more try\" my last experience was even worse than the four previous.  Rum diaries knows very little about good customer service.  From having to send food back to making group reservations and having to wait for at least an hour to be seated to never having a meal show up that was correct then feeling chastised by management?! No thanks.  I'll spend my hard earned money elsewhere.   Rum Diaries...where the customer is never right!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I drove to Rum Diaries in Ajax, paid $20 cover and the toilet is too nasty to use. All levels of wrong. Wet floors and toilet paper all over the floor.  Spoke to the manager and they blamed troublesome patrons. The manager  mansplained that women's washrooms are dirty and that any janitor would agree. I womansplained that I've been in far more ladies rooms than him and it's up to mgmt to keep it clean. He continued that he couldn't understand why women would want to use public restrooms in the first place. He also encroached on my space and I told him I did not want to engage him any further. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Went here with a couple of my girlfriends, one of whom had dined here before about a month ago. First of all, she's not exactly a foodie and second, she's not a big red meat eater however she kept raving about their Braised Beef Short Rib. I'll get to that shortly. 

We went on a weeknight so the place was empty, though we heard that Thursday night is one of their busier nights with live entertainment. Although we were one of very few tables, the service was still very friendly. We had a server named Sheantelle whose knowledge of the menu item were impressive. She also shared with us her top picks. The bartender was also very knowledgeable and honest as a friend of mine was wanting a drink with less sugar and was asking for any kind of alternative. He was honest and explained to her that with that particular drink, it would be impossible. Coming from the hospitality industry and having dined at 4 and 5 star restaurants, we appreciated this feedback.  The service alone I'd rate 5/5. Now, come the food reviews. 

**Update** Went here last night and Cameron served us.  He was the only server last night since it's a slower night.  Although there were more walk-ins that came in later in the evening, Cameron was able to tackle the floor.  After a mix-up with our Shrimp Platter order, he was completely understanding and still left a positive vibe for the unfortunate incident (shrimps were undercooked and cold). My rating of 5/5 for the service still stands.

[Appetizers & Sides] 
Jerk Chicken Poutine - One of the best I've ever had and I try to stay away from potatoes due to the sugar levels but I couldn't resist. If I had died from a diabetic coma after this poutine, I'd die happy. Normally when it comes to poutine, I'm all about the cheese curds and the gravy. This had neither. They used white and yellow cheddar melted with a spicy chicken gravy and of course, jerk chicken. The jerk chicken was perfectly seasoned and I'm guessing it was grilled (to perfection). I'd go back just for this poutine. Although listed as an app, the portion was more like a meal portion. Definitely something I'd recommend if you're just feeling peckish and are wanting  to try something a little different. 5/5

Callaloo Dip - Pretty much a new favourite at RD. First off, where else will you be able to have dip with callaloo? On top of the delicious appetizer, it was accompanied by tortilla chips and fried naan which was amazing especially when it comes out so fresh.  Four of us shared the dip and even had a some dip leftover so Cameron was generous enough to bring us some extra fried naan.  I'd personally go back for this dip. 5/5.

Fried Plantain - A staple side for any Caribbean restaurant.  Although the presentation was very nice, was really nothing spectacular.  The slices were thin, though, nicely fried.  I prefer the slices to be a bit thicker and even on its own (ie. minus the rum butter sauce). 3.5/5.

[Entree] 
Lobster Mac & Cheese - I was personally expecting chunks of lobster baked in with the Mac & Cheese but you actually get a lobster tail. Wasn't the biggest tail size and the Mac & Cheese itself was nothing spectacular, though, we still enjoyed this dish. Paying $21 may be a little too much but it's acceptable. 4.5/5.

Braised Beef Short Ribs - As with my friend, red meat is not my first pick but because she herself kept raving about it as well as our server, we had to try it and I am very happy that we did. The Flintstones sized portion was slow braised to perfection that the meat literally fell off the bone and melted in your mouth. It also had just enough fat, though, it was still quite lean. I'm sure if I was able to see it in its raw state, it probably would've had a nice marble look to it. Not only was it perfectly braised but it was also braised in rum and molasses. The entree was also served with a large serving of sweet potato mash and grilled vegetables. All of which were also nicely cooked. They were also simple yet flavourful. The portion size is definitely worth $21 if not more. 5/5.

Southern Fried Chicken Supreme Breast (aka Chicken & Waffles) - Now, I'm a big fan of chicken and waffles. One of my go-to spots in L.A. is actually Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles.  But seeing as RD is obviously a higher scale than Roscoe's, it'll be a little different.  The difference is that the chicken was breaded but more with bread crumbs. The meat was white meat which was quite juicy.  The breading also had a nice crisp to it.  However, the chicken itself lacked a little bit of flavor but then the spicy maple syrup complimented it quite nicely.  The waffle was freshly made and was light and quite airy.  The dish also came with a side of vegetables.  The portion of the chicken was pretty small and personally, I didn't feel that the price was worth it (even though I was treated for the night). 3.5/5.

I will definitely be coming back here and this may very well be one of my new go to spots out in the East end."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. A party of 10 people for a birthday party and over the course of 2.5 hours,  no more than 2 people ate at the same time due to the kitchen being unable to coordinate our orders to come out together. The birthday girl was served 30 minutes after everyone else had finished eating (and at which point the restaurant had converted to a night club for the evening). The servers had an attitude, and even shoved the birthday cake at the guest of honor. Management was apathetic and unapologetic. Blank, stone faces were the only greeting anyone received. To top things off, our servers were completely oblivious. One server took the initiative to bring 3 glasses of water to our table for 10 when we were initially seated and proceeded to ask, \"did you all want a glass?\". Some guests later ordered cocktails and the server came back 30 mins later and asked if anyone wanted to order a drink. Just a sloppy, ridiculous establishment that completely ruined what was meant to be a special evening. The worst part is that they do not care. I'll be glad when this place is \"Closed Permanently\"."}
{"text":"Well, I have been to Rum Diaries a few times a month for a year now - its local for me - so time for an update.

Plenty of opinions.  I will try and approach my review differently, to let you know how to best use this place.  From there you can give it a shot and see what you think.  Fair?

The best night I recommend you give a try is on a Thursday to start.   You have 1/2 price Rum Cocktails on Thursdays from 6-8.   I have attached the menu.   I must say Carribean Restuarant or otherwise, they do a pretty good job of supplying an interesting Drink Menu.   They use a variety of Rums, and I say they make a good drink.  If you have a date, I recommend you try one of their Martini's - Caramel Martini, Pina Colada Martini, or if you want to clear your sinuses with a kick try a drink with some Ginger in it :) 

What makes Thursday a particularly good date night as well is half price apps (the wings do well, they have a good cajun dry rub).  If you make it to about 8:30, the specials are done, but they have Live Entertainment that I would describe as good, not over the top loud, just nice mellow vibe.  So, half price drinks, half price apps, and a calm vibe of Entertainment.

The other night to try is on a Saturday.   They have a consistent party every Saturday - RnB, Soca, Reggae.   DJ Smooth B and rotating DJs.  They have these nice huge heat lamps outside as a summer bonus.

There are many options across Toronto, but if you compare the effort, Rum Diaries compares well.  3 things to look for music, atmosphere, and drinks.  I strongly recommend you start with a Thursday first (take a date).   If you like what they are doing there (I do), check it out on a Saturday.

Write back here what you think."}
{"text":"Food was good very tasteful!! The wait time was super long for the main course!! Service seemed to be good !?"}
{"text":"Was not a fan of this place. The service was slow, the ambience was moody, and the food was OK. Took about 45 minutes for us to get our jerk chicken poutine that cost about $20. The jerk chicken didn't actually taste like jerk chicken and the gravy was not very good. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Oh me oh my you need to drop by!

The restaurant itself is nice, it looks nice from the outside and inside matches the outside views. Just a heads up, the service is a little on the island time but the servers seemed very nice. This is not a restaurant to eat at if your in a rush. Although, you may wait a while, on Thursdays there is amazing live music being played and he is good! Awesome voice. On the table as well were a list of different country rums categorized by countries and there were a few places where I was like oh really? You need to try some rum if your up in this restaurant/lounge- hence the name!

The food was good. I started off with the callallo Dip and wow! That dip alone secured my next visit! After that our main courses came. The flavour was on point for both dishes. I originally ordered the Braised beef short ribs and my husband had the Jerk Pork. We took a few bites and ended up switching. Mainly because I'm not a port fan and that was what it's braised in. Like a true champ, he gave up his dish for me and I'm so glad he did! He loved the short ribs and i really enjoyed the jerk pork! It was juicy and not dry and the Jerk on it was a great burst of flavour. My only one complaint? I could of done with some more spice! 

I will for sure be back, on a Thursday because I loved the vibe and the music. I saw multiple thing's on the menu I need to try and you best believe I'm coming back for that Callallo!!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday evening with a large party of approximately 20 people. They will not seat you until at least half of your party is present. So basically you are standing around near the entrance/bar area until this happens. 

As mentioned in numerous reviews, the service is very slow. The staff clearly could not handle multiple tables/groups. We spent alot of time trying to get our wait staff's attention. 
 
On to the food:
Jerk Chicken Nachos  - $16  (score: 0/5) 
These nachos were a joke. Sadly, there were three orders across the table. I could make better nachos at home with my eyes closed. Where were the plantain and cassava chips as stated in the menu description? It was all tostitos. Why were there peices of lettuce scattered as garnish. Haha. These were the type of nachos were there wasn't enough cheese, or toppings, layered throughout the entire platter. Once you get through the top layer you basically have naked tostitoe chips. There was hardly any jerk chicken in it as well. 

Spring rolls (Ackee and Salted cod) - $16 (score 4/5)
These were really good, however it was only 3 spring rolls cut in half diagonally. Not enough spring rolls for the price. 

Wings (Dry Cajun rub) - $14 (score 3/5) 
Nothing special. Can't go wrong with wings. 

One member of our party mentioned that the Jerk Chicken Coconut Linguini was really good.

Around 10:30pm, they will start to rearrange the tables, to open up the floor. The DJ will start to setup his station, and this place will shortly turn into a club/lounge. Coat check is $3, and I'm pretty sure there is a cover charge (not sure of the fee, since we were already there for diner) The vibe is old/new reggae, R'n'B, etc.

I was really disappointed with the extremely slow service, and the nachos. The main entrees are all overpriced. I would prefer to eat at the local jerk chicken / carribean spot, rather then come here. 

I would come back hear not for the food, but later on in the evening for the club."}
{"text":"Revisited  Rum Diaries tonight because a friend of a friend was singing there.  When we got there we were told there weren't any seats available on the patio where the singing was going to take place.  We were told if we stayed at the bar they will let us know when seating will be available.  We sat at the bar hoping to get a drink, we waited 20 minutes and still not served.  There were three to five people serving in the bar at different times.

There were other patrons there that I observed without drinks too.  I guess they had the same problem.

We decided to go outside on the patio where there were lots of seats available and not reserved.  We waited to be served for another 15 minutes.  Listened to couple of songs and headed over to Mackenzie Pub near by where the service was wonderful.

I will not ever venture back into this establishment."}
{"text":"Short story.  Went for a groupon of 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert.  We went for a 6pm reservation on a Friday.  Had friendly and and helpful service that checked in on us occasionally in between courses.  Food arrived at a decent pace though it could have been quicker but nothing to complain about.  Food was amazing.  Everything was cooked perfectly and the jerk taste had a great kick without overwhelming you with spice or completely taking over the taste.  No complaints at all on any of the food.  Good rum selection of all kinds. Tried 2 cocktails which were good and expected.  Atmosphere is ok at this time but we were not there for music or anything like that so it was ok that there basic restaurant background noises.

Details.  Even though I live in Toronto I pass by Ajax every few months and saw a groupon for this caribbean dinner for two.  The restaurant and menu looked interesting enough so we decided to try it.  For $55 regular groupon price you get to choose 1 app, 2 entrees, and a dessert from this menu.

Appetizers: jerk chicken, calamari, and banana rum mussels
Entrees: chicken and waffles, jerk chicken linguine, veggie rundown, and jerk pork
Desserts: rum brûlée and golden rum cake
They also have an extensive rum selection including various cocktails made with rum and a small separate seasonal cocktails selection to choose from.  

Finding the place in Ajax wasn't hard and they have plenty of parking.  At least for the time that we arrived for.  We've read reviews about the place about how bad service has been to big parties and how slow it could be when they were having their music playing late at night so we chose to come 6pm on Friday.  When we arrived there were a few tables that were  full but obviously and not gotten into their busy period yet.  We got a nice booth table from a very nice and attentive server who answered all of our questions without any disdain or even a hint of a grimace.   She took our orders and brought out the drinks first. 

We ordered Tropical Fruit Spritzer and Pineapple Mai Tai. The tropical Fruit Spritzer tasted more of the guava and the rum and could have used more mango but was exactly what I had wanted to go with the food I was having which worked out great for me.  The pineapple Mai Tai my girlfriend ordered tasted like it sounded.  It was perfectly sweet and blended all the flavours perfectly and was what you expect when you order a Mai Tai.

We chose to get the Spiced calamari as our appetizer.  It was covered in a delicious marinade that was kept light and thin enough that it didn't taste overwhelming fried.  The jerk mayo that came with it complemented it perfectly and gave it the kick I wanted from jerk mayo.

We got the Jerk chicken coconut linguine and the Buttermilk chicken and waffles for our entrees.  The linguine was heavenly.  The sauce coated the linguine perfectly and hit you initially with a sweet creamy coconut feeling that melts you and then nails you with tangy kick from the jerk seasoning that just brings you back to the sweet creamyness that takes you in circles of deliciousness.  I am speaking as someone who doesn't even like coconut that I was still a huge fan of this dish and kept stealing bites from my girlfriends.  I got the chicken and waffles myself and may never be able to eat the dish so easily ever again.  These were the lightest waffles I have ever had.  Even though the waffle that came was your basic size from a waffle iron already split into quarters I picked up a piece and didn't even think I was holding a piece already.  The waffle was light and of course quite crispy on the bite but still contained waffle softness below it.  Not the softest I've had but it would be hard to have any more softness while keeping it that light.  The waffle itself was a good amount of sweetness and went really well with the maple syrup which they had also jerked.  The jerk taste in the syrup was not as strong as it had been in all the previous dishes mentioned and could be missed if you've been eating those dishes immediately before eating the syrup but went very well with the waffles and chicken themselves.  The chicken was so moist and tender and also fried light so that I could taste jerk chicken and did not taste oil and grease any more than if the chicken had been baked.  Even after tasking that heavenly linguine I don't regret choosing to eat the chicken and waffles except that I may regret not being able to eat this dish anywhere else without disappointment.

We chose the rum cake for our dessert.  The cake was strongly flavoured and matched very well with the ice cream which I assume was vanilla but I think was some variation of vanilla like french vanilla but not quite that.  They worked very well together and the cake went down great despite being full from all the food.  The cake was moist and on it's own was good if a touch heavy but went down real easily combined with the ice cream.

Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday and was excited to try out the chicken and waffles.

They were not as good as expected but not bad if you live in the area.

The party room was a decent size and fit our whole party which was great.

It seemed others enjoyed their dishes more than I did so perhaps if I come again I will try one of their top offerings.

The staff here is nice and looked after our larger party quite well.

Disclaimer: my visit was three plus years ago so my review may be dated if new staff has been put in place"}
{"text":"Came for a bachelor party, and was blown away. I must have tasted 6 different  dishes, and 3 dessert and not one of them fell short of AMAZING!

The service is on Island time, but the servers are kind and considerate and very helpful. 

I plan on coming back again and again"}
{"text":"I strongly recommend you do NOT make birthday or celebratory reservations for this place!!!

I made reservations about 2 weeks in advance for my birthday. The only time available was 10pm.
I asked many questions about the reservations as it is a lounge/resto and these things can be tricky to deal with when you have to move tables for people to dance. I asked if we would be rushed or moved by having our table so late in the night knowing they would be turning it into club/lounge by midnight.
I was told the only way I would have to move is if they happen to put us in an area that is on the dance floor. If not, than we would be free to keep our table for picking on appetizers, ordering drinks, etc.

When I got to RD at 9:55, I was told to sit at the bar and our table would be ready soon. 10-15 min later no table. My bf went to ask which table were they seating us at and apparently they were waiting on this party of over 20 people to wrap up so we can have the table. I was upset by this b/c I did ask when making reservations how they plan on accommodating my party if a large party before us is there and plans on staying all night. I was told \"It should be fine. Shouldn't be a problem.\" 
We didn't get our table until near 11pm!!!
I had a party of 15 people too. So, we were all bunched around at the bar waiting to be seated for about an hour.

Once we were seated, everyone ordered. Mixed opinions on the food. Some people said it was mediocre, while others really liked it. I personally liked the Lobster Mac n' Cheese and Beef/Chicken Satay Skewers that I tried.

They rushed our party through eating and then told us close to midnight that we need to leave the table so they can give our table to another party...
Ummm what??? You sat us at our table an hour late!!! Once I expressed my frustration, they left my party alone for the night. The following day my girlfriends told me they tried to order me a slice of cake to sing me Happy Birthday but they were told  the kitchen is closed. Huh???
We're not asking you to bake a dang cake... we are asking you to slice a pre-made dessert you have in the back that we will be PAYING for and it wasn't late in the night when it was requested either.

Other than those disappointing factors, it turned into 90's hip hop and rnb night so the music was great!
The prices are average compared to a  Moxies or Milestones.

I would go back for a random club night but never for an occasion."}
{"text":"Came here before a party as we were a bit early (located in Ajax).  We just wanted some drinks.  It's a huge place that has a big patio at the back.   It seems like a busy and lively place later in the evenings (we were there about 6:30pm-ish) and it was a bit empty.  We sat on the patio and ordered a round of drinks.  The server we had was very friendly and we did get our drinks in a timely manner.

If I were in the area I would probably come back and chill here.  We didn't try any of the food so I am curious about that.  I'll update my review once I do!"}
{"text":"The main dishes here are good. The deserts are just so-so. Maybe I don't have the Caribbean palate.

The music and atmosphere here are great. Really my type of place. I've always been well taken care of on every visit.

{"text":"I've been here a couple of times before and both times the service was an issue. This visit, my final time here, they've sunk to a new low.

I came here tonight with a couple of friends to see a friend perform on the patio. As we entered, she was walking by and we exchanged greetings. The hostess saw us but didn't say anything. Several servers passed by and didn't say anything. After a few minutes, I asked the hostess if we could sit on the patio and she said there were no seats out there but she didn't offer us any options. I asked her if we could sit at the bar and she said yes but didn't say or do anything else.

We made our own way over to the bar and had a seat. Five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes, TWENTY minutes and not a single person greeted us or asked us if we would like a drink. HELLO, we're sitting AT the BAR! There were at least three servers and a busboy(?) working the bar. We made eye contact with them several times and were still ignored.

The band started playing out on the patio and we could see several vacant seats and tables out there and only one had a reserved sign. We wandered out there to listen to the band and take some pictures. A gentleman walked past us and sat at one of the lounge sets. We asked him if it was reserved and he said no, so we joined him. Another ten to fifteen minutes passed and still not a single server greeted us. We were totally ignored.

After listening to our friend sing a couple of songs, we left. It was clearly obvious that we weren't going to be served. It's hard to criticize them for bad service when there was NO service.

Strike three!"}
{"text":"I don't know how to start and if what I have to say will fit the allowed characters. 
I will give you a proper sequence of events.
~ Bought a Groupon voucher. Told myself , this is a good opportunity to check out the place. I am all for supporting local businesses.
~ Hubby and I set out to go one night . We entered the place, and saw place is big , a few occupied tables. First impression - didn't look good that the receiving area was full of folded napkins, and stuff. Didn't look professional, Cant they do that in the back room?
~ We were greeted by a waitress in her early to mid- 20s and were seated. As with any Groupon voucher, I always tell the server ahead of time that I have a Groupon voucher. So when I did, she said: \"Honestly I haven't seen that groupon voucher\". I was stunned to know that she was clueless or not informed. Arent the server supposed to know what is included and excluded in that voucher? Server didn't even make an effort to know like ask her manager . In fact they should have a menu ready printed for the Groupon voucher users.
~ Hubby and I ended up checking my Groupon app to see what we can order.
~ We placed our orders Jerk chicken nachos - a good portion , Jerk linquine which was good and the chicken and waffles - this was okay but the veggies tasted and smelled like fuel???!!! I didn't complain yet. 
~ then close to finishing our main dishes, the manager approached us and said the Jer chicken nachos was not part of the Groupon voucher. So hubby said the 
Groupon fine print said jerk chicken - it was vague. Come to think of it.. the appetizer section has Jerk Chicken Poutine and Jerk Chicken Nachos , which are possible selections. So we chose nachos only to find out it is not part of the voucher. Had the server known and was informed way ahead - then we would not have made the mistake of picking that. Mgr said only the poutine is included. So I told the manager can she just adjust my bill the nachos is $2 more than the poutine. Mgr said oh I cant do that. (I didn't want to ruin my \"date\" with hubby ) So she suggested that I take home the poutine and the nachos is addl to my bill!! OMG..My frustration was building at this time.
~ We ordered dessert. Rum Brulee . It came after a looooong wait. and when it came, I haven't seen a brulee that is runny.
~ when we were about to check out, the bill came again , after a long wait. I don't understand why it was taking them too long. Another frustration, why impose gratuity of 18% I was not even satisfied with the service. 
~ please check out photos and the gooey rum brulee

END OF STORY. 

Main thing that the owner of this restaurant should focus on is Restaurant Management. 
 -  IF you want to do a Groupon promotion, make everyone (resto staff) aware of the inclusion if you want to be too strict with it. 
 -  If you want to gain your marketshare in Ajax, then please your customers. I would have wanted to spread the news to my friends to check out the place , to support Ajax businesses. But I just felt so frustrated after this experience. 
 -  If you the resto manager know that you have fault in communicating the groupon details (and even the Groupon fine print was vague as well!!) - then give the customer some leeway and allow the price adjustment. What is $2 compared to losing your customer and future customers."}

This restaurant cannot handle Group reservation in a professional manner. Service was bad. Made reservations at least 2 weeks ahead of time. Server did not seem to know we had a VIP package. They did not know what their package include..VIP 4 appetizers on their website they insist it was 3..we did not get the bottle we order. We had to pull up the website to show them. We had to ask the server for the appetizer She was ready to take orders for main course. Not once did a manager come around to see if all was well...dang shame ..that is basic customer service. Cake brought to table with no knife, fork or plates. Plate and tea spoons came after.  We had to ask for a knife and only then were we given a dinner knife..and who eat cake with tea spoons. Chocolate covered strawberry another disappointment. Strawberry frozen solid..chocolate pale milk chocolate... Guest who was a chef thought it was so wrong...Where is the manager circulating to make sure guest is happy. Friends who came to have drinks and appetizers after 10pm made it there before and when our food was being served. We had plans to do bottle service and appetizers after dinner..we chose not to spend another dime. Please put managers on the floor with people skills. Never again..Keg is not far away."}
