{"text":"Sizzling Jaks is a great place for brunch or for a late night snack.  It's greasy food for cheap!  It gets busy on weekends, but I found that the line moves fairly quickly.  Service is quite reasonable considering how busy they are.  The best part about this restaurant is its hours - I don't think it ever closes.  Whether you're craving your grilled cheese with bacon at 4am or at 2pm, Sizzling Jaks will be open!"}
{"text":"I had the regular 2 egg breakfast, ham, fries, toast, coffee.

I really was not impressed.  The eggs were bush league.  It is not difficult to cook eggs over easy, but mine were 2 eggs combine into one small lump with hard yolk.  The ham was a thin slice of processed meat. Hardly any potatoes. The toast was some cheap wonderbread, it came out cold, and spread with margarine unevenly in clumps

It was 12$ including tip which I wasn't too happy with considering the poor quality of the meal.  Yes the staff was friendly and quick, but an egg breakfast is one of the simplest things a restaurant can make, yet they fumbled it up real bad."}
