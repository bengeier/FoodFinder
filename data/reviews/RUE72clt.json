{"text":"Rue 72 was set up at the Loch Norman Highland games over the weekend. After indulging in beer and fried Scottish food, it was nice to have something different for dinner. 

The truck was out of the two items that we wanted, so we settled for what they had on hand. We ended up with a Grilled Cheese sandwich and a Shrimp and Rice dish. The sandwich was unimpressive and rather small. Definitely something I could have made at home. The rice dish had a cheese sauce and shrimp. My fiancée loved it, but feeling \"meh\" about rice as it is, I was underwhelmed. But, I did give an extra star due to her enthusiasm. 

I feel that I wasn't able to experience Rue 72clt at its greatest because the truck was out of all the crawfish dishes. If they are at an event in the future, I will make certain to go earlier and hopefully be able to update to a higher star count."}
{"text":"I was finally able to catch up with Rue last week in the scorching heat.  I really wanted some grilled fish and Chef Calvin delivered in an amazing way!  I didn't know what to expect since most of their fish is fried but I ordered the grilled flounder with sautéed veggies and red velvet cornbread.  Man that grilled fish was amazing!  Amazing!  It was simply perfect and exactly what I was hoping it would be...flavorful.  I think a blackened seasoning was used and although the seasoning was a little heavier on some of the fish, it didn't ruin the meal.  The veggies were a great combination and the cornbread was different but good.  I will definitely add this truck to my favorites list."}
{"text":"Love the Tornado Potato! I'm not a big food truck fan, but this food truck is fantastic. The food is delicious! Can't wait to see you at other food truck venues!"}
{"text":"The Gouda mac n cheese had no flavor of Mac n cheese. The shrimp tacos and fries are delicious however."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would.... they were set up today for a private event in Cornelius, NC.  While I waited in line one man, who was waiting on his order, waited for an hour.  This was a small event of 200 people and they served at most 7 people in an hour.... After standing in line for 50 minutes I get to the front only to be told they aren't serving catfish today. (which is half of their menu) I would suggest you CLEARLY STATE on the menu what you are serving and work on your wait time."}
