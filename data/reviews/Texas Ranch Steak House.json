{"text":"I'll tell you my story.  I moved here from sc because of a job. About 6 months in I lost that job, but all along we have been eating at Texas Ranch.  When I lost my job they gave me one like family. 2 years later I'm still here. I eat here every day and still love it. My kids beg to eat here on my time off. I didn't want to post anything because I don't wish people to think I'm saying it because I work here. I'm posting my truth. Thank y'all!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 5pm on a Tuesday night.  No other patrons in sight, but it was early.  Greeter was friendly enough and waitress was prompt @ getting my drink and my order.  Onions rings (1/2 order was plenty) appitizer arrived quickly and were super yummy.  Salad was pretty standard, but serving was generous.  Ordered prime rib (super grisly but cooked correctly), baked potatoe was awesome!  Price was decent and staff were very nice.  I look forward to going again and trying some pasta next time!"}
{"text":"Although the decor could use some updating, the food and service is good... I was appreciative of their late hours, as I arrived a little late in the evening"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch Friday.  It was a pretty bad experience.  When we walked up to the hostess stand, she immediately told us to wait a minute and walked off...When we were seated we waited at a long time for service (the restaurant was nearly empty).  A waitress asked us if we had been waited on, and when we told her no, she said \"I wonder if they assigned me this table\" and walked off.  We finally got a waitress.  After we had our orders taken, we saw her putting out ketchup bottles, etc. on the tables before she even put our orders in or brought us drinks!!!   The service didn't get any better, we waited a long time, and my food sucked.  Kinda hard to criticize a cheeseburger and fries but I didn't finish them.  I would have loved another napkin and had to finish my burger with my knife and fork because I couldn't wipe my hands.   I didn't leave a tip for probably the second time in my life."}
{"text":"Interesting story. A friend referred me to this restaurant . And I was so hungry one day that I mistakenly left my wallet at home . Problem was, that I had eaten the food that I ordered . Oh crap! What was I going to do . So I mustered up the courage to go to the cashier which I believe she is part owner . What a wonderful woman and great spirit I told her that I lived not far and would return  with the money. I offered to do anything even wash the dishes but please don't call the cops on me ha ha ha. 

 Long story longer she let me go I went home got my money returned to pay as well as the waitress
The food was for breakfast and it was excellent. No complaints here. That was a couple of months ago and I'm writing the review today because I had the 8 ounce sirloin with zucchini and shrimp. I asked for the steak to be medium I must say fantastic Yumm. That's a local footprint for me and I'll continue to go back. 
 I have a thing about giving out five stars which is the only reason why this restaurant got four."}
{"text":"Great service friendly atmosphere and the chopped sirloin with gravy is awesome. That is just the start, the baked potato is one of the best i have had. Finished off with a warmed pecan pie which was great. This place is a kept secret and i expected to be busier than what it was. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Your typical comfort food, home town restaurant. Food was decent, service was good. Plenty to choose from on the menu, good for the whole family. 

Price was fair for the quality and portion sizes. This is a \"will return\" if in the area again."}
{"text":"They must have changed management. This service is HORRIBLE. The waitress was nice about it... but the food was late we waited for over an hour... this is a cluster Phuck. Several customers who came in after us were served first. I asked for a manager and she never came. The waitress continued to apologize. She forgot the biscuits... my daughters chocolate chip pancake was made half ass. After coming to this place for several years, I will NEVER come back. I'll be calling the city sanitation to check the kitchen as well. This is THAT BULLSHIT"}
{"text":"Went here with a total of 6 ... 4 guys and 2 women. Every one had ate here before except for me. So I had no clue where to start on menu. It was between breakfast and lunch hour. So a lot of choices to choose from. I got cheese bread with a sort of dipping soup. When she bought it out I had no clue it was mine. It looked nothing like on menu. It was 2 buns cut 4 ways with toasted cheese on top with spaghetti sauce is the dipping. Sent that back to get hashbrowns with cheese and onions, it taste like microwave plate of potatoes. Didn't want to bother the waitress because we have such a big party so I ate the hotel has a brown anyway ordered a salad to go .ato salad it was good I guess or by this time I was just hungry. I have not returned to give it a second chance. will do so I can update my review when I do."}
{"text":"Only had the breakfast from this establishment. The moms and pops specials are the way to go. For the price you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Service was great.  For $25 I expected more of a steak.  I have seen steaks like this used in Philly cheese steak or skirt steak but not ribeyes.  The seafood was okay.  Overall good but over priced."}
{"text":"Came here for a take-out breakfast for 3 as we were in the hotel across the street, and the sign said breakfast was offered.  Staff were super-nice, and while I waited I notice a pretty good client base for take-out breakfast.  The staff's camraderie was a treat to observe, they clearly like one another and care about the business.  The food was delicious, the only downside was the pancake breakfast for my daughter didn't have syrup packets included, and we were already on the road headed north for home when we realized it....  :(  I would still recommend it for breakfast, but get your coffee from the 7-11 next door, there's is a little strong."}
{"text":"I had dinner once and breakfast 3 times while my truck was in shop. Dinner was good in the bar. Breakfast was great. Had the same thing each day, Two scrambled eggs, 3 strips of bacon, grits, and toast, all prepared well. Service was almost fast food quick and not much more cost."}
{"text":"In Charlotte for work and stopped here on my way back to the airport. I had the Southwest hamburger and french fries. The burger was fine, fries ok but the waitress was possibly the nicest waitress I've had it sometime. Sorry that I did not catch her name to add it here!! I would go back for the average food but friendly smile anytime!"}
{"text":"The name and looking at the building from outside has country western southern feel to it. However, personally on the day I visited it made me think I was entering a Mexican Restaurant.  But, they do have country southern food in here.

Menu items ordered:  I got their chopped steak with brown gravy with onions, potato salad and mashed potatoes and gravy. No rolls or cornbread came with meal. Whether you can get it or not by asking for rolls or cornbread - I guess I will never know.

Customer Service:  My waitress took care of me while I was here. She checked on me several times. As a result, my drink was full at all times. My order was brought to me quickly. She was friendly and I could tell liked her job and she didn't mind getting what I needed. 

My food was delicious. I really liked the chopped steak with gravy and onions. In fact, it may have been the best chopped steak I ever had. 

Other notable mentions:  They also have a bar with several beers and drinks."}
{"text":"Breakfast was mushroom n cheese omelet... it was ok, canned mushrooms and cheese wiz, for the price is meh..staff is friendly coffee is good, bacon was crispy tho cold so not cooked to order, but its the only close by and i liked the saloon look!"}
{"text":"I had such good luck with Sugar's (across the street), I decided to press my luck.  Did you ever watch that show?  I felt like there was a little voice in my head screaming \"no whammies\" as I walked through the door, and as soon as I did, this little red devil was jumping up and down laughing, knowing I had gone too far.

Where the staff at Sugar's is friendly, the staff at Texas Ranch is surly.  They leave the impression that they would rather punch you than serve you, and given the neighborhood you're in, they just might.

Though signs on the outside proclaim breakfast specials for a few bucks ($2.75, if I recall), I don't remember seeing them on the menu, and I think I spent close to $6, just for the food.  After a drink, tax and a tip, I was out closer to $10.

To make matters worse, the food wasn't that great, it was served only after waiting for a while, and it wasn't exactly what I ordered (my over-medium eggs were scrambled).  I didn't think the staff would be amenable to giving me an updated set of eggs, and I figured the rest of my food would get cold in the process, so I went with it, and my soft drink went empty in the process.

It's definitely possible that I hit them on a bad day, but I'd much rather brave traffic to get across the street to Sugar's - or even across the bridge to McDonald's or Wendy's (if they start serving breakfast) than go through that again."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Friendly staff! Great food and cheap beer! Breakfast and lunch specials. Definitely would recommend this place to eat at."}
{"text":"I went here for a prayer breakfast a few days ago. This was my first time visiting this place and I live very close by. This place is a hidden secret. The breakfast was great. The grits was creamy seasoned just right and good. I had turkey sausage and hashbrowns also. They give you nice size portions. I definitely recommend this place. I plan to go back. The waitress was awesome. She was very attentive and nice while working the group herself."}
{"text":"7pm on a Saturday night...only two tables occupied.  That says a lot.

The food was so-so. For $16 I expected a better 10oz cut of ribeye than what I got, which was a fatty slab a little over 1/4\" thick. Baked potato was undercooked...still firm in the middle.

The waitress was very nice and attentative. 

Location isn't very good...we didn't feel very comfortable."}
{"text":"Service was great. We had the catfish and  1/2 roasted chicken.  Catfish had a light breading and got 2 big filets.  Chicken was tender with great seasoning.  Everything came HOT. Good bread too.  Full bar.

Returned for breakfast and you will not believe the great prices.  The portions were very big.  I am a big man and could not finish the plate of Ham eggs Hasbrowns and biscuits.  Service was prompt.  Food hot."}
{"text":"The word \"saloon \" is pretty misleading as they only had 2 beers on tap.

I can't say we experienced any meanness from the staff like previous reviewers- everyone was very nice. It was the rest of the clientele that were sketchy and terrifying.

It's not a nice/fancy restaurant but it us within walking distance of the many hotels- be sure to bring your pepper spray or concealed carry!

Expansive menu from Italian to Greek, even Mexican! I had the chicken fajitas and I was surprised how much I enjoyed them! Portion large enough for 2 meals. My hubby had a burger and he thought it was fine.

For 2 of us to eat and have a few beers it was a ridiculously cheap $34

While I can't say we will go back we did not have a bad experience."}
