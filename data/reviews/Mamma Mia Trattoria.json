{"text":"Following up on my last post, the risotto balls, pizza, wine and chocolate mousse cake are great. The risotto balls are crispy on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside with a delicious marinara sauce. The pizza crust it perfectly thin, crispy and soft and the topping are always fresh and flavour full. 

I tried the creme brûlée and was very disappointed. The dessert was completely cold because it was just taken out of the fridge and the texture was not creamy at all, it was too eggy and spongy."}
{"text":"Dark and dingy. Got the sense that this place should have closed a while ago. Oil and vinegar bottle on the table were a nice touch, as long as you don't hold them up to light and see the greasy handprints of the dozens and dozens of patrons that walked in here before you. 

The pizza I ordered was better than any nearby chain pizzeria, but it didn't seem to be authentic wood fired. I asked for hot pepper oil. It looked about the same age as the decor. 

Overall, I would say it's an average place. It is clean and the menu seemed to be comprehensive with over a dozen pizzas and pasta dishes to choose from. 

I wouldn't go here on a date unless you're trying to send a strong hint that you're just not into them."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service. Service can be a bit slow. This is usually do to the kitchen. The owner is the chef. Prices are competitive. Been a regular customer for four years and never a problem."}
{"text":"Mama Mia has been around for a while and at this location for a couple years.  It's located across the street from Upper Canada Mall in an outdoor plaza.  It's not overly appealing from the exterior, but once inside it has a welcoming and clean decor and a somewhat authentic Italian feel.

The food has potential, BUT CUT BACK ON THE SALT!  The sauces have the necessary spices, so why drown it in salt?  

Being the brave soul I am, I ordered the snail appetizer.  It's clear this is not fresh, which they are aware of, since they put it on toast and drowned it in tomato sauce.

Mussel appetizer, also not fresh, but this one you can't freeze.  Had that slightly bad smell.  Not enough to stop me eating them, but enough that I would not order again.  It became clear at this point that every dish included the exact same tomato sauce, which is way to thick to the point of being tomato paste.

Lastly was the veal chop with peppercorn sauce.  Medium rare done right, but a little fatty.  I would recommend it though.  I paid extra to get penne al vodka as the side.  This could have been good if they removed the salt."}
{"text":"We've had dinner at Mamma Mia a few times over the years and have not had a bad experience. I've also attended twice with my book club. The bruschetta is always good and I have tried a few different pasta dishes. I especially enjoyed the lasagna as well as the chicken or veal parmigiana and the occasional pizza. The prices are reasonable and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"We stopped going there due to the slow and nasty service about 3 year's ago. Felt like Veal Marcella, had a great meal with great service fast and friendly what a big surprise. 

Back on our list."}
{"text":"I had planned for a special mother daughter dinner at this restaurant, my experience was TERRIBLE to say the least, waited for 15 minutes just to be ignored by the entire restaurant staff, i think they may have a lot of customers because of which a new customer is not important to them.When it comes to customer service if there is a level worse that crap then they belong in that special category. Well done Mamma Mia Trattoria."}
{"text":"Each year we pass through Newmarket on our way up to the cottage.  Usually by the time we are here, our stomachs are rumbling, however their are so many chains, and few independents.  One year my sis saw Mamma Mia's, and even though it is in a strip mall, once you taste the food, you would swear that you were in the Italian countryside.  This restaurant is massive in size, and they also have a nice patio as well, we decided to take advantage of the warm weather, and occupy it.  We started with the arancini, which is one of my favourite Italian dishes.  One word to sum up Italian cooking is resourceful.  Arancini uses left over risotto, and then it is combined with cheese, and it is battered, then fried.  There were three of us dining and the order comes with three so we each got to have one, and they were scrumptious.  They were lightly breaded making for a super crispy exterior.  They had the right amount of cheese without being greasy,  They were served atop a delicious marinara, a perfect accompaniment.  Normally rice balls tend to be $1.50 to $2 each, so these were a bit pricey, but  were well worth it.  We also split their primavera pizza which had grilled eggplant, zucchini, red peppers, and mushrooms.  I normally order my pizza with meat, but since all of the vegetables were grilled or roasted it added an extra depth of flavour.  
Overall,  the atmosphere is very relaxed and casual, combined with the traditional fare, the whole dining experience is quite enjoyable."}
