{"text":"The sushi here was very poor quality. The service was slow and almost non existent.  No free refills on soda and waited for over 15 minutes for the bill. Eventually had to find a server and ask for it.    I won't return and wouldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced AYCE with lots of delicious options. Servers are attentive and all the dishes came out quickly. The d√©cor is really nice, but they have weird curtains leading into the kitchen. The unfortunate cutting of the fabric creates the illusion that pants are hanging from the doorway.   P.S. They also have a great deal if it's your birthday. Birthday gal/guy gets their dinner meal free on their birthday if they have a table of four or more in total. If it's your birthday month, it's 15% off dinner for four or more. You can't combine both offers though."}
{"text":"Friend found a big black fly in the bubble tea here , it was inside the drink and he has to go rising his mouth. Super disgusting , I have no word. Although they gave my friend the drink money back, I still would never want to come back here ."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth going at all Imao.   POINTS: [waitress  mean like hell] [food not fresh]   It's a neighborhood Japanese style restaurant owned not by Japanese. I was doing my grocery nearby and I need to use washroom so I dropped by this restaurant since it is close. I asked if I can use the washroom but to my SURPRISE, the waitress answered with her smile on face \"sorry it's reserved only to our customers\". WHAT A MEAN STORE! I know they are the owner and they can reject me but there were no more than 3 tables at that time. I don't see any problem to use the washroom for 2 minutes. However I said nothing and turned back to the door. I thought about my experience when I was actually a customer here, and I regret that I did not use the washroom when I could:)   Kindly I suggest you guys finish your business before paying or the waitresses would not allow your entry into the washroom:) For me, I will never give them a sh*t though :)  Well, then talk about my CUSTOMER experience here. It was not a good experience but I did not bother rating it until I got pissed off today. I visited this place the first time like a year ago. I ordered a chirashi don which is basically sashimi on rice. It comes with a miso soup. The soup was just fine. But the chirashi don was not satisfying because the fish does not taste fresh. The egg roll was too sweet to enjoy. And the rice has a very common taste, while the good Japanese chirashi don pays great attention to the quality of rice. Not to mention the importance of fresh fish on top. I have been living in Japan. I am not even comparing their food to the real Japanese food, but their food is still not good to recommend. Absolutely not worthy eating there.   I was served by a nice waiter at that time though. I asked for some tissues and he brought me a lot. And I tipped a generous tip even though I did not enjoyed the food much. I thought they have SERVICE at that time. And now I regret how naive I was :))   I would never give it a visit again for sure."}
{"text":"Another run of the mill all you can eat sushi restaurant not catered by Japanese.  I wanted to try as they advertise 10% off because of grand opening.  False advertising, like many other ayce restaurants,  you get 10% off if you pay by cash. I get that this place is a few months old,  but they need to get their business together.   First, we were debating between the ayce and a la carte menu .  They literally have two photocopied menus for us to read,  and the servers insisted on getting it back once we were done,  kind of strange.  We chose the ayce instead.  There are many items but nothing was out of the ordinary,  except for the many rolls....with absolutely zero descriptions.  I guess the mizuki roll is leftover end pieces rolled in rice?  We ordered room temperature sashimi (not by choice) , and for some odd reason the salmon came in two different shades of orange, I guess evening patrons get leftover cuts?  The tempura came out quick except for the shrimp,  which took two additional orders until it finally came out. This place knows how to deep fry properly as all the tempura came out crunchy,  shrimp was the frozen kind (mushy texture) .  Lastly, all the cooked meats were over cooked, and as somebody already mentioned the ribs were good.   I wasn't too pleased with my first experience,  but being a new restaurant I give them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"Came for Our Mother's Day dinner. Won't come back. They kept losing our orders and there was a good half hour we were just sitting and waiting.  We asked if there was anything left and they said no, but a whole tray of sashimi came out just as we gave our new orders.   When ordering Beef tataki, order 2, 5 or 10, we kept getting an order of 5. We got some orders we didn't even order but we were hungry so ate it anyway.  My Daughters fell asleep waiting for their stuff.   I'd rather go to our regular ayce resto."}
{"text":"Nice interior and decor. Service was pretty good. Food is pretty much what you would find at a standard Japanese AYCE. They have sashimi scallops and sweet shrimp on weekend dinners, bonus! Sashimi was fresh enough, but obviously not a la carte quality. Beef ribs were good!! Not grisly. Soft drinks are only $1. One of our diners had her birthday this month and the whole table had 15%off!! (If there are at least 4 diners). Everything else was pretty much standard AYCE quality."}
{"text":"VERY BAD EXPERIENCE!!!  I came here with friends for several times!!!! Every time we came here there's a sweet lady who welcomed us but this time we couldn't see her.  I came here with two friends, we had eaten all you can eat at lunch. At the end, we had left some food so we decided to ask for a takeaway box.  As I asked one lady who is big eye, medium long hair, tied hair in half. I think she's the manager or supervisor. She was so rude, so loud shored on us and said\"why you want to have a box?\" And I said \"because I wanna takeaway and don't waste'' and she said 'how much do you think the price of the sushi?' And I said \"I had an experience that I can buy a box for a dollar to take away the leftover\" she said\"a dollar!!! How could be?! Do you think a dollar can pay for the sushi? $1 per each does make sense!\" Then she turned away without helping us to get a box and asked all of the staff who offers us a dollar for a box! That the rest of the customer could heard about what she said!  She then came again and shouted us again and said that we are the one who ordered the food so we have to finish it all without H taking away otherwise she would charge us $1 per each piece!!!  I responded why she have to act that rude to us and we understand if she doesn't want us to take away we will finished up all.   BAD BAD BAD EXPERIENCE"}
{"text":"NEVER EVER GO TO THAT PLACE .FOOD IS BAD AND OVER PRICED. The staff are mean and if you Chose the \" all you can eat \" menu and you don't eat the whole thing they will extra charge you Coz of food waste .me and my friend didn't want to waste anything we just couldn't eat it as it was WAY TOO NASTY ."}
{"text":"It was OK for all you can eat sushi and had lots of dishes to choose from. Decent price ($15 AYCE lunch). Wasn't overly impressed with the dishes and flavour/freshness of the fish, but service was good and all the dishes came out well."}
{"text":"It's located in a plaza called Skymark Plaza on Don Mills and Finch, close by to Seneca College and its in the same plaza of No Frills  I decided to come here because some of the reviews seem decent, and the price of $26 was average for everywhere. Drinks not included and you would need to pay additional for pop, but tea and water was free!  My first impression of the restaurant renovation, was it looks modern and it can cater to large groups with different table settings that you don't see in many AYCE restaurants. I stood at the front door for awhile waiting to be seated, and finally someone came by and brought us to a booth. ( Most booth were filled with people )  Service-waitress 5/5 Very good service and attentive. Always came by to take in your orders, and collecting finished plates. no complaints  Food-sushi/Sashimi/Rolls They carry your typical ayce choices along with Scallops and Sweet Shrimp! ( which we were REALLY excited to try )  we ordered the following Sashimi-Salmon, seared Salmon, Surf Clam, Scallops, Sweet Shrimp, Red Snapper, Mackerel **My seared salmon never came instead I got seared white tuna.  I have to say the sashimi tasted really low quality, and for some odd reason by scallop and sweet shrimp looks half cook or that something has cooking it. The color was kind of off - all sashimi had a warm taste and it was covered in water - it just didn't taste pleasant, we ordered a second round of sashimi..same thing  Rolls- Our roll order was forgotten on the FIRST ticket..mmm..we ordered their signature roll..it was really meh....and the nori was chewy  handroll- the Nori was very soft when it came...portion of rice to filling..rice more..filling a bit..no good  Hot Food- beef roll enoki, and green onions, short ribs, grilled shrimp, grilled cutlet, grilled mushroom, grilled beef, grilled chicken heart, etc etc ( The shrimp did not taste fresh again ) but overall the beef were all pretty good ! ( or 2nd order some of the grill items were once again forgotten !!!! they weren't even full for the evening !! )  Apps- Green Salad, pickled bitter melon - they use the Japanese sesame dressing and the salad is not drenched in water therefore it was good, and surprisingly i don't like bitter melon but this was the only dish I ate most that night its good if you can bear the taste of bitter melon.  Deserts - Pretty much tried everything except the cakes! but there was nothing spectacular about the deserts at all.  They accept credit card payments and service charge is not added on the bill. We were given a Frequent Diner Card where you buy 9 buffets and you get 1 free, each stamp equals to one person  Overall I would not come back to, and would prefer going to other places that is the same price but have better food quality.   The one star is for service and the other is for the grill station"}
{"text":"ok. i really really dont like giving out bad review but wow. this place had garbage food beyond belief. i consider myself a huge japanese food addict and wow. absolutely abysmal. horrid. i am actually sitting in the restaurant in shock from how awful the food is. dont skip on ingredients, please. my agedashi tofu had the wrong type of sauce and tofu and toppings. the japanese curry almost had 0 actual curry taste. the sushi rice was not very good and the sushi was bland. the staff was pleasant and nice, and im sure the bubble tea is fine. but my god. dont open a japanese restaurant and serve this kind of food, for the love of God."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, the food is good for a relatively cheap price. I go there for the vegetarian box at lunch time"}
{"text":"Honestly I have been here a few times with my boyfriend and absolutely loved the food - the service on the other hand is horrible - I'll went with my brother who is handicapped  and my father , we were seated and not a single waitress came to even bring us water or ask if we needed help or to place an order ... We tried grabbing their attention but they did not come .. The restaurant was not full ... We got up and left   .. Will not return"}
{"text":"Services, food, and servers are WORSTEST ever I have seen. DO NOT COME HERE. Food is also wrong according to my order."}
{"text":"Mizuki has Japanese potato croquettes and chicken heart skewers that I haven't seen in most Japanese AYCE places.  Good selection on menu.  Food are served fresh and hot. It also has a nice selection of desserts. Good value for the price."}
{"text":"My family are locals of the Don Mills and Finch area and decided to check out this place - a large sign signalling grand opening 10% off greeted us.  Food - Passable, portions were good but several items in each order were missed and I had to remind the server  Pricing - Fair, although the server there initially gave us the bill at full price and we had to mention we planned to pay in cash before they reprinted the bill  Service - This is where my issue with the restaurant lies; the service was below average save for one younger guy who tried his best but had limited English skills.  a) When we first tried to pass an order slip to an employee (who was still in uniform and walking to the kitchen) he said he was no longer working and couldnt take my slip with a pretty rude attitude  b) Waters and Tea were not automatically refilled and my glass was sitting empty for at least 30 mins before someone asked if I needed more water.  c) Staff at BEST had passable English and had a negative attitude when taking ad-hoc orders.  Not going back and would not recommend this to friends, families or other locals."}
{"text":"I came here once before and had a pretty bad experience already but my friend came back and he lives nearby so we had to come here for lunch... Again.  We decided here bc the prices are cheaper... (not anymore),  their website said 14.99 and we had a coupon. But when we arrived, we learned it was now 18.99. I already remembered the food was bad so I was sad as soon as we all sat down lol  Now let's talk service. Not bad actually. It was dead so everythijg was quick, and they didn't forget anything this time... Yay! That's how they got their +1 star. Oh, they don't speak English very well..   Now food.... Oh my God. Everything sushi is HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE!!!! first, the amount of rice on sushi is ridiculous. Usually it is a lot for lunch ayce but this was especially bad since the fish was SOO thin, it was practically see through, and the rice was a mountain high.  The tempura batter was about 5x the size of the shrimp. As my friend said... 'I've never seen tempura with so much batter that the shrimp doesn't bend anymore'.  A few very bad dishes stood out to me.  1. Red snapper sushi. My friends and I both though the fish has gone bad... It was so sour and disgusting.  2. Spicy white tuna sushi.  I think I saw one little piece of fish wrapped in it. The rest was a huge block of rice covered in the disgusting amount of mayo.  Anyways, sushi was horrible. Tempura was terrible. No comment on the grilled dishes Nothing special.  Ice cream tasted old... Like it had been frozen for too long.  Anyways, I knew coming here it was bad but I didn't know it was THIS bad. My friends and I vowed to never come again.  Since it's not longer 'cheap'. There's really no incentive to coming."}
{"text":"Food is subpar. I guess I could have tolerated the food if it weren't for the manager. She was very mean and rude towards us the entire time. The servers barely pay attention to you and are rude as well (I guess the manager's behaviour has rubbed off on them or she hires people like her). There was one server who was nice though. Needless to say, the manager basically called us stupid when we questioned why she charged us twice for something we ordered one of. She was like \"you cannot order only one, you have to order two, it two people\" (btw the staff hardly know English, so this may have caused misinterpretation). Plus she kept throwing remarks about my friend being \"stupid\" (she has a hearing disability, thank you). Needless to say, NEVER GOING BACK AND I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO FRIENDS. I can overlook poor English, poor food and an unreasonable bill, but not this rude,inexcusable behaviour and poor customer service."}
{"text":"I've been for both AYCE and a la carts (with a groupon) The food here is average sushi fare. Wasn't disappointed with the taste or food freshness, some of the reviews here read much worse than my experience.    My problem is that the portions are small, and the prices are a little more expensive than usual. For my latest visit, I order the $15.95 chirasu and a Red Dragon roll. They tasted fine and the rice with the Chirasu was quite good, but the portions were disappointing. The chirasu sashimi, except for the red tuna (odd), were quite thin, as well, the salmon on the dragon rolls were even thinner."}
{"text":"Service is great but food is nothing special.  Also didn't want to make a big deal, but there was a piece of hair in my soup which turned me off the entire stay."}
{"text":"Cute hidden gem in the Skymark Plaza. We ordered the green dragon roll, spicy salmon roll, dynamite roll, and panda milk tea. Eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach! Portion sizes were large and fish tasted good. Service was quick. The servers weren't friendly but not unfriendly -- but it was during the lunch rush so I can't blame them.  Place was also clean and atmosphere was nice.  Would go back again!"}
{"text":"Mizuki Sushi ???? is right at Finch and Don Mills off the 404 inside a plaza.   Elegant modern interior design however plays top 40 kind of music. Service was decent and they mostly respond in English and sometimes Cantonese.   All you can eat prices: Mon - Thurs Adults $24 Fri, Sun & Holidays $26  (I don't know where Saturday falls into because the menu is clearly missing that)  Certain Chinese newspapers have cut-out coupons for this place.  Before I write my review I need to point out the SPECIAL that people do get confused about: 1) FREE DINNER ON YOUR BIRTHDAY is real, you must present your photo ID before ordering. 2)15% OFF THE WHOLE TABLE ON YOUR BIRTHDAY MONTH ... BUT the astricks state that you need a MINIMUM OF FOUR PEOPLE pay for DINNER PRICES... drinks are not included ... ID is still required .. and most importantly ... CANNOT BE COMBINED WITH ANY OTHER OFFERS and of course not valid on holidays ...  So the main point is .. you can only choose either special #1 listed above or special #2 and cannot be both. So you either get one free dinner for the birthday boy/girl OR you get 15% off for the whole table of at least 4 people at dinner.  Drinks are NOT all you can drink ... coke #330 and all pop are $1.00 .. ice tea #385 is $1.50 ... juice #336 is $3 ... but tea and water is included.  They actually give you the amount in pieces you order .. you know how sometimes you write 10 pieces they give you 5? .. Ya they actually give you 10 here.  Sashimi ... everythings good .. most importantly ... on Friday-Sunday and Holidays you also get Scallop Sashimi #150 and Sweet Shrimp Sashimi #151 as well. DO ORDER IF YOU LOVE THESE AND LOVE EATING BY VALUE. Although I do find the sweet shrimp not as sweet as I've had elsewhere ... They're not cheap on those orders though; they give you what you order.  They also have this Honey Pork Trotter #169 if you like pig feet (I posted a picture of it) which you don't get at other places. Their salmon head looks like its overly dry on the outside but the inside is still quite moist and juicy.  They only have two ramen choices which is beef ramen #286 and spicy beef ramen #287 .. compared to other places there's a huge variety .. well they do but in udon.  I posted pictures of the menu if you want to see the rest but other than that, it's pretty typical. I do find that they didn't have AC on the night I went there .. quite stuffy ...   The decors they use are real flowers (yes I sniffed them and touched them, I have picture posted). Their thousand island shrimp #165 is basically your regular shrimp drenched in thousand island sauce ... not the most amazing but just wanted to let you know.  Overall it's not bad, I would come back again."}
{"text":"Came here with my bf today for the lunch special (lasts til 4pm!). You get a lot of food for the value! We ordered the sushi specials. At about $8.50 each, you get soup, salad, 16 rolls, and in the winter they add 2 takoyaki, dumplings, or spring rolls. We were super full and couldn't even finish all of the food! Waitress was also super polite and packed up our leftovers for us :)"}
{"text":"Some of the staff is very friendly; but ONE  waitress was EXTREMELY RUDE.  Overall food is good.   DAY 1  Great Service, great food! Had a great lovely  time on Valentine's day here  Waitress is very friendly. Service was very fast even though it was a busy hour.  The desserts are fresh and delicious!  Thank you all at Mizuki Sushi!  By the way, the Bubble tea is out of this world! Definetly worth trying  DAY 2 Service is fast and food quality is good.  However, this time we went on Family Day  and one of the waitress (different from the last time) was EXTREMELY RUDE with us, very pushy and rushy.  She was rude before and after we consumed the all you can eat.  There are kind ways to ask your guest to leave after the due time. But this time the waitress attitude was so non professional  and disrespectful.  Hope non of you go through this experience.   WE WILL COME BACK ONLY FOR THE BUBBLE TEA, BUT PROBABLY NOOOT FOR MIZUKI SUSHI!"}
{"text":"The waiting staff is quick polite and attentive.  The food portions are great considering it's a buffet.  Meaning that the portions are controlled. If you want 1 onion ring order 1 onion ring and that's what you get as opposed to a huge basket.  I go to buffets for variety so I appreciate the small portions. At the same time if you want to 100 pieces, go for it.  Meal if free on your actual birthday."}
{"text":"I order takeout from this place a lot, I love their Takoyaki here! The food here has great tasting sushi, especially the unagi sushi. The only thing they should improve on is the freshness of their salmon. The slices of the sashimi are too thin and have a strong fish scent and taste."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon for Mizuki sushi $17 for 30. I came in knowing this could not be used for all you can eat. But then upon studying the menu, you could not order the bento boxes on the last page of the menu either. Chinese-run restaurants always do this, and it's really a turnoff. I know it's hard to make it as a restaurant, but because of this, I don't think I would go back.  At the end I asked if dessert was included, and was told it was $1 extra for an ice cream.  But then another waitress came back and said it was 1.50.  Overall the cooked food is very good, the rolls lack flavour, and for 8.50 - 10 for the specialty rolls, they were very small - all you can eat size.  Usually restaurants will make larger rolls if you are not participating in the all you can eat."}
{"text":"order changed slow and bad service bad sushi rice  somewhat acceptable sashimi  abd on and on and on ... just don't go there if you want to a nice calm AYCE  Not even worth 1 star"}
{"text":"Amazing food  I'll be back for sure.bit pricy but fresh  and yummy they  even gave me tea while I waited and because order was over 50 they have a extra roll which is decent because it's not cheap lol"}
{"text":"The quality of the food was 2/10. Menu was a bit complicated to read. They hadn't clearly made the difference between dinner and lunch.   We ordered fish, soups, sushi, maki, etc.  There were a few of us and we had food left over - not because we weren't hungry but rather because the food wasn't good."}
{"text":"I previously gave this place a 3 star. After coming here recently. 1 star would be generous at best. This ayce buffet had jacked up their prices since last i came. Removed a lot of key items like beef ribs. Shrimp skewer. Most sushi. And to add insult to injury they made sure whatever you used to like from them you will not. I posted a picture of their bbq eel sushi which looks like a cucumber roll. Because it basically is. Theyre so cheap now they cant even afford avacado in a bbq eels roll. Like most restaurants.   Another thing is also the salmon rose. So they had offically gone off the deep end in this one. I posted a picture. Its basically a chirashi at this point. Cause the rice mountain they used on the thininst of salmon slices. Show they just dont want you to eat the fish.   For the cooked food. What can i say. They find everyway to add more rice. Or more batter and less substancs. The tempura is a giant layer of batter with a shrimp you can barely find.   This place has just dropped so much. They went from a decent ayce place i would go around the neighbourhood to price gouging and clearly the cheapest of cheap. They tried to cut back on quality and good portions of food. And good items. And stuff as much rice they can to fill people up quickly. Even a seafood fried rice. Had no seafood. And simply had frozen pees and vegetables.  Avoid this place at all cost if you value good japanese or even decent japanese"}
{"text":"This place has is actually quite nice inside, but too bad it's in a bad location. I used a groupon for $20 worth of food - bought 2 entrees and still paid $12. The food was good for the fact that I only paid $12. Without the groupon, it would be more worth it to buy AYCE. The groupon does not apply to any specials (AYCE, sushi deals, bubble tea, etc), and they tried to make us pay in cash when we got the bill. They didn't tell us before and there was no ATM on site. Finally they agreed to let us pay with a credit card because we didn't bring any cash on us."}
{"text":"When going in for the ayce they don't bring half the stuff you order, make you wait 5 mins between each 2 bite selections almost like they try to pace you so you won't eat so much.    Waitresses act like they do you a favor. Grossly overpriced for the service and the quality.    Will never go there again.  EVER."}
{"text":"I, like many others, decided to try this place because I had a Groupon for it. I believe I paid about $24 for $60 worth of food here (not usable with ayce or lunch specials, and must have at least 4 people in order to use. Also a reservation. This was according to the fine print. What I found out at the restaurant was that they decided to add another condition. Not usable with bento boxes either).   The interior of the restaurant looks more upscale than I thought it would (I have a preconceived notion of what a Chinese-run Japanese restaurant looks like). They have a few tables for larger parties (say six and up), and they're either large squares (with the seating running bench-like around it, or large booths. These are cute, but not so practical, I find (have you ever tried reaching into the middle of a really big square table? Good to put stuff on, but not practical without a lazy susan.  Had:  Mizuki roll (10.95) - torched salmon on top of chopped white tuna, crabmeat & fish egg with Japanese spicy sauce and sweet sauce. 8 pieces. One of them was sideways when it came to the table. I've never had that presentation issue happen before. Tiniest pieces of torched salmon on top of the roll. Could taste the torched part though. Added a nice depth of flavor. Rice was very overcooked. Almost mushy. For the first time ever, the spicy sauce actually had a good spicy kick to it. I enjoyed the taste of this roll, but the rice makes me wonder whether I'd ever get it again.  Spider roll ($10.95) - deep fried soft shell crab, avocado, cucumber, flying fish egg & Japanese mayo. 8 pieces. Again with the mushy rice. Not cool. Also the tiniest spider roll I've ever seen. For this price point, definitely not enough crab.  Chirashi don ($15.95) - assorted sashimi on rice (served with salad and miso soup). Pieces of sashimi were quite small. Not very fresh either. Ironically, this rice was considerably more like sushi rice than the rice they used in their rolls. This bothers me.  Katsu don ($9.95) - panko-crushed (sic) pork with egg and onion, served with katsu sauce and rice (served with salad and miso soup). I'm used to the egg in my katsu don being much less well done than this. This was a pork cutlet with onions in an egg omelette. Not much sauce either. Pork cutlet was extremely tough. I ordered this thinking it would be very difficult to get wrong. I was wrong.  Salmon terriyaki dinner ($11.95) - two pieces of salmon terriyaki served with miso soup, salad, rice, and mixed veggies. Salmon portions could have been bigger, but the portion was decent for the price. The salmon was overdone (I have yet to have a properly cooked salmon terriyaki anywhere though). Terriyaki sauce had a good balance of sweet to savory. Veggies (broccoli, carrots, zucchini, perhaps something else I forget) were crisp, and the black pepper on top was a nice touch.  This was an okay experience, but unless I get another Groupon, I probably won't be back for their a-la-carte. I might consider trying their ayce (they have interesting dinner desserts like green tea tofu pudding and at $23.95 for dinner, it's not bad), but probably not anytime soon."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time using a Groupon.  I was disappointed I was not able use is for the all you can eat...oh well.    We ended up ordering from their regular menu...Ordered a boat which was decent BUT it did not offer anything \"special\".  The boat was basically the same stuff as the all you can eat BUT was small (in quantity).  I would be disappointed if I had to pay full price since we did not leave feeling full.  Food was ok but we expected more.  The decor, atmosphere and service was very good.  Hopefully they increase the quantity of the food on the a la carte menu or just stick to an all you can eat restaurant.  They are having trouble trying to be both."}
{"text":"Great service, get the dinner buffet menu, soooo worth it!! Fresh seafood and great vibe! #IslandBoySaySo!"}
{"text":"No service? tried to order beton box and switch to another roll got rejected even though I said I can pay extra. Also got tempura sauce taste like soy sauce."}
{"text":"Was having a great time then the bill came.  We paid by debit then had cash for tip. Was about to tip but then the head server or manager she came into our face to tell us we needed to tip her like chill the hell out. Vibes ruined after a great service. She was being impatient."}
{"text":"Soggy rice. Eew!  I don't often give poor reviews but this restaurant quickly fell off my chart.  The first time I came here was about one month into opening and the food was great. Brand new decor. Timely service. Good prices. What else can you ask for?  Maybe today was an off-day but I came here expecting to eat sushi and I was highly disappointed by the mushy warm rice which then made the nori chewy and not crunchy. The portions shrunk, but I can live with it since I went with the AYCE menu.  The cooked food items were ok, but nothing outstanding.  I don't think I'll return unless they can get the staples (e.g. sushi and sashimi) right."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now. Once for lunch take out (bento box), second was lunch AYCE, and the third time was lunch dine-in (bento box).   I'd have to say the lunch take out portion is bigger than the dine-in but either way, the portion size was still pretty good.    I got the Salmon Terriyaki Bento and it came with soup, salad, salon, rice, 4 piece of California roll, 2 spring rolls, 4 pieces of veggie tempura. I wasn't a big fan of the salad to be honest cause there was a mixture of the wasabi taste mixed in unlike other places. The protein portion was a tad small compared to other places, but the California roll was very good! Not too much rice and just the right size. Perhaps I'll get a sushi combo the next time I go back.   The environment is quite nice. Very modern looking. The service was alright though. Nothing special."}
{"text":"False advertisement. Their menu has 2 promotions. One is Free Dinner on your birthday. The other is 15% off for your birthday month if you have a total of 4 of more people. The \"Free Dinner\" did not have an asterisk beside it on their menu but their 15% off did. We were under the impression that it is free on your birthday without any conditions. The manager said that the fine print applied to both promotions even tho there wasn't an asterisk on the \"Free Dinner\".  Either way, we had 6 people at the table so my friend still ate for free but they wouldn't let us use their Grand Opening promotion, 10% off. Manager said we cannot combine promotions. Since we had 6 people, 2 of us could still have used the 10% grand opening promotion but the manager said we MUST sit separately. Obviously we sat together. I can't believe the manager treated us this way when it wasn't our fault.  Food was mediocre. Nothing special for its price. Some things that you must try if you go: Flounder (made much better than most AYCE places) Shrimp wrapped with bacon"}
{"text":"This wasn't my first time here but since the last time the sushi has gotten significantly worse. The salmon sashimi use to be pretty decent but today I felt like the sashimi was freezer burnt. They also cheated out on the amount of fish on the rolls.  I like rice but seriously.. At an ayce restaurant this was just horrible. The service was prompt but they need to correct their portion sizes.   Definitely not worth $24.99 ayce.  Would not recommend this place. I will probably end up eating here again because my grandma lives around the corner and this plaza is what is accessible."}
{"text":"Don't order the thousand island shrimp.  It taste like they just poured thousand island dressing on top.  They don't understand \"Grill\".  They deep fry the salmon belly.  Their \"seared\" is just - take a salmon and fry it on the pan for a minute.  This place is empty for a holiday- only 9 tables had people.  I think that's why their sushi is not very fresh.  Their holiday price is $26pp.  It doesn't even include soft drinks.  Most AYCE include soft drinks for that price.  They want $1 and $1.50 for ice tea.   The shrimp tempura taste strange like the shrimp is dried inside.  It seems like they cut it in half to make it look bigger then deep fry with batter to hide the small shrimp.   Their agedashi tofu is just deep fry tofu with no sauce.  They really need to know what is agedashi tofu.   Don't think we will come back.  There are a lot of AYCE that are much better in the area, like Sushi Legend at Finch and Leslie or Yamamoto at Bridlewood Mall."}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi. Sashimi lacks freshness. Wouldn't come back here. Nothing out of the ordinary. But the bacon wrapped shrimp was good."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch & ordered the  dinner all you can eat option because i really wanted some sashimi & dinner menu comes with quite a few hot dishes options that isn't in the lunch menu.  Also i wanted to have the full experience before i made a yelp comment.  For all you can eat this place is decent.  They have shrimp and scallop sashimi for weekend dinners.  Their tofu pudding & shrimp karaage is DA BOMB love it.  Actually all their desserts are super good! DROOLS! The scallop & shrimp sashimi is pretty good.  Other sashimi is mediocre. Hot foods are pretty good on the most part.  Lots of options in their menu.  The decor is beautiful!  Not what i expected.  Not much customers so there is no wait.  Service is pretty fast.  The price is decent, atmosphere is VERY good, desserts are pretty awesome.  Pretty good for date night if you want to stay away from breaking the bank. $25.99 for dinner ayce for adults on weekends.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"The decoration was good. I went there for lunch and its price is was reasonable (15.00). The lunch menu was good, but it had many mistakes. No sashimi at lunch, but at least the amount of rice in a sushi wasnt that much."}
{"text":"The decor is chic and modern, that's about it. The overall experience was a let down, definitely not worth it.  The tempura shrimp was tasteless.   We dined a la carte, the Mizuki Roll looks awesome on the menu, with a thick slice of salmon torched .. what was served tho was a wafer thin slice of salmon that was barely there.   The Sashimi Haru was a boat of sashimi that must've been sitting since atleast lunch.   The Gozilla roll is a marriage of ingredients that should've never happened.  Not going back !"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi buffets around where I live. The location, restaurant size, and interior decor is really good too.  The menu is quite large, even for the lunch menu, which is definitely a plus. Personally I feel that the lunch price is more worth it ($15 weekdays, $16 weekends), compared to the $10 premium for dinners. They have special promotions right now so if you pay cash you get 10% discount.  The food I liked today includes the short ribs, sakura rose sushi, skillets, chicken kagame, calamari, takoyaki, beef and mushroom wrap. They have many options for ice creams, like 5 of them! One thing to stay clear of is their cakes selection...don't order them! They are store bought so the taste is pretty generic and awful. But the pudding is quite soft and smooth though, if you can get over the synthetic mango taste...  Also, one thing to consider is that many fried items/skillets/kitchen items only comes in 1 piece when you put 1 on the order, as opposed to 1 serving. So typically their portion is quite small so you can try more things.  Really hope this place will last and keep up with the quality. One thing they should improve upon is their server team, but it's understandable considering they just opened."}
{"text":"My Orders: Salmon bento (ok), Spicy Beef Ramen (don't buy their ramens...)  PROS + Ambience  + Service  + Location: A+ for convenience. Situated beside a No Frills, 2 banks, a drug store & a Service Ontario.   CONS  - Food: Their bentos, while mediocre, were worth the price for the quantity you get. The ramen, on the other hand, was rather disappointing. They used instant noodles (which is fine, just advertise it as such) and the egg that accompanied the dish was fried rather than boiled...   If you come here, the AYCE sushi menu option is okay. The dessert menu was disappointing (the dishes look a lot more appealing than they taste)."}
{"text":"RATING: 3.5  *Ordered food through delivery did NOT eat at restaurant, rating will solely be for food*  I would say this is your basic typical sushi -- presentation could be better but none the less, still tasty. I personally liked the deals they offered for delivery. I tried the spicy sushi combo (spicy salmon, spicy tuna and spicy california). My favourite taste wise was the spicy salmon roll, as always. Also got a salad on the side, the dressing was delicious but they could have packed in more vegetables as the cup was 1/4 of the way full.   The restaurant is also a bubble tea place so I ordered a large hazelnut tea and to my surprise their larges are huge (as seen in photos). Delicious regardless. I asked for half sugar and I should have asked for less -- it was very sweet.  I gave them a 3.5 because it wasn't the best sushi I've ever had but it was good."}
{"text":"After reading alot of other people reviews on this place and having gone to try it myself, I didn't think it was all that bad from what other people experienced. Mizuki is a typical AYCE japanese restaurant that serves up the typical AYCE menu. You can choose from your sashimi, maki rolls, tempura, cooked items, rice, noodles etc. Nothing very special that stands out from this place compared to other AYCE places.  This place definitely had competition since just more down the street south of Finch, theres Sushi Legend which I believe alot more people are going.   The location for this place is all that great. Its in a corner mini plaza located right on the North East corner of Finch and Don Mills. The plaza is a bit dead and only really has most traffic when people go there for the No Frills.   Food was average, but not bad. Everything I had tried was pretty standard. The most positive thing is that not having a stomach ache after! So I am happy with that."}
{"text":"The thoughts of coming back...is close to none.  Decor is decent. Food is mediocre. Not worth the price. Better off somewhere else.  Probably worst ayce  sushi in Scarborough.    Waitresses walk by more than 4 times without taking dishes. Also rushing us to take the order, probably because we used a groupon."}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews are mostly negative. We get take out here pretty often. While their sushi is average I like their cooked food a lot better. Their pan fried udon is really yummy, as well as their fried rice. Their maki is decent but the red dragon roll with salmon on top is a little below average. Why? Because the salmon on top is paper thin and doesn't taste like the best quality. Their miso soup & tempura is good. So all in all I would say some things are hit or miss but in general the food is better than all the negative reviews suggest."}
{"text":"A nicely renovated all you can eat Japanese restaurant. The price can be a little pricy, but the food was worth it. The scallop and shrimp sashimi are pretty difficult to find in most all you can eat restaurants. The skewers were my favourite, especially the chicken heart and the small octopus. Some of the deep fried stuff are just average though, such as the thousand island shrimps that some reviews mentioned. The food came pretty fast, since it wasn't too busy when we had our dinner, but they did forget to put in a few of our items and gave us someone else's order. I don't blame them much for that because most all you can eat restaurants have this problem. Overall the dinning experience was above average/ good."}
{"text":"This place offers a decent selection on their AYCE menu, as well as their regular menu. I was actually surprised at the number of options offered on the regular menu, including a number of rice dishes, udon, ramen, and grilled food. This of course in addition to the standard Japanese fare of maki rolls, sushi etc.   On most prior visits I go AYCE. They are fairly quick in serving the food, and have not noted anything problematic. Nothing really noteworthy either however. Fairly affordable for AYCE.  The last time I went I ordered off of the regular menu. Was not very impressed with their torched/pressed sushi. I got so excited when I saw it on the menu, but it was quite bland and improperly seared. The Beef Ramen, was a bit different than what is offered elsewhere, and quite filling.  I'm sure I'll be back, as it's convenient and fairly quick."}
{"text":"I've always have a thing on sashimi, and this restaurant is just across a street from my school, and I went there often. And I saw this post on the door says they need part time employees. So I started working in this restaurant today, and my boss doesn't even give us the tips that customers leave for us. I was a little shocked when I first heard from one of my coworkers. My boss simply said that this how they do things, and then I told her that I can stand with the salary she gives that clearly not reaching the minimum wage, but I could never accept the facts she's robbing our tips. she explained nothing, so I quit my job and said she's not respecting us. And you know what? She called me 7 times when I was in the shower just to yelled at me. Anything she said was just pure personal attack and made no sense..."}
{"text":"came here with one of the daily deal coupons (wagjag and groupon) ..  totally not worth it... service was a fail.   Food portions were TINY and prices are high...(i speak of the ala carte menu not AYCE)  came in on a near empty Wednesday night... promptly seated.. then that was it..  they litterally just forgot about us.. no tea no menu .. they just went to the back and dissapeared for a good 13 minutes or so.. cant even wave anyone down.  when we finally got the menu, anything remotely resembling a deal cannot be used with the groupon...(ALL bento boxes)  so i ordered a chirashi.  16 dollars.. i am a sushi lover and i have been to many if not almost all the ayce sushi places in GTA... i can tell you this place cuts the THINNEST sashimi i have ever seen.  salmon is transparent.. 3 of their salmon sashimi = 1 salmon sashimi anywhere else.  all the fish were so thin it looked like oil soaked through a piece of paper.  the whole meal is smaller than the size of my fist... and over half of it was white radish used to fill and prop up the transparent fish.  after you calculate everything.. you totally lose.  If you were to not use the coupon it would have been a better deal."}
