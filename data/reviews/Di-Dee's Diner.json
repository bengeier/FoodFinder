{"text":"Nice atmosphere, not too noisy, good eats, good service.  Food prepared just right and servers were paying attention and checking on us.  Breakfast was good"}
{"text":"Excellent Breakfast!  Quick Service.  Think about a local diner before heading to IHOP!"}
{"text":"Good good good service. New location a little hard to get into with camper but worth the effort. Prices gone up a little. Still good all the way around. Anyone doesn't like is either a yuppie or Damn yankee."}
{"text":"Showed up for the second time during their posted business hours of when they're suppose to be Open and they weren't. Today this establishment even put their advertisement flyer in everyone's newspaper boxes stating their new location and business hours, they close now Close at 9pm instead of 9:30pm. A group of us decided to give it another go and showed up around 4:30pm for dinner. While their neon OPEN sign in the front window was on as well as their Yes We're Open sign was hanging on the front door, their doors were locked and the lights were off. Fooled us twice, won't fool us again as I and my fellow Sun City neighbors won't be coming back. Save your time and expense and don't bother putting anymore of your advertisement flyers in our newspaper boxes, the community word of mouth of our two time experience of your unpredictable business hours is already out and spreading around."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot for breakfast. I usually only post if a place is that terrible or if a place is that awesome. This place unfortunately was horrible! Horrible food. Horrible service. Don't waste your time or money! Waited for 45 minutes for a small breakfast. Cold subquality food and an incompetent waitress. The only positive is the manager was nice enough to reduce the bill by a little. It still didn't make up for my wasted time and overall bad experience."}
{"text":"We thought the restaurant served unremarkable food. The fried eggs were overcooked. The toast and coffee were mediocre. We liked our very nice waitress. My husband and I both agreed that we wouldn't return despite the low cost of the meal."}
{"text":"I know its a 4-5 star place, I just showed up at the wrong time.  I'll be back.  Judging from the crowd and my friends recommendations I know this place is where you can get some great southern home cooking and breakfast.  Problem is, I showed up at 2pm on a Sunday looking for breakfast when they close at 3pm.  A group of six of us all needed some greasy/hearty southern food to soak up the booze from the night before.  At 3-4am we decided that if we accomplished nothing else the next day we would make it here.  We walked into a fairly packed restaurant but it looked like most people were headed out the door shortly.  Nothing fancy by any means, plenty of tables of all sizes.  We were seated quickly.  I wanted sweet tea, but not piles of sugar(and this place was COUNTRY), so I asked for half and half sweet/non-sweet.  It came unsweetened.  Our waitress just left us a pitcher of sweet so my refills were perfect.  It wasn't on purpose but one side of our table ordered breakfast while the other ordered home cooking.  At 2pm, home cookin' was the way to go.  I ordered the breakfast special with bacon, 2 eggs, choice of side and choice of bread for about $5.  The eggs(over medium) were cooked perfectly and the bacon wasn't half bad either.  The biscuit was great as well.  I made a little bacon and egg biscuit that would have been perfect with a slice of cheese.  My big qualm was the hash browns though, completely stale.  Our side of the table all stared in envy at 3 different $7.99 specials of a meat and 2 veggies across from us.  Pot roast with mac and cheese, Turkey with dressing and cole slaw, and a meat loaf with collards.  They had some bannana puddin' and some other deserts as well.  I got to try a couple bites, but I think if I went for more I would have ended up with a fork in my hand.  All in all, I was satisfied, but pretty much every time I've been to Waffle House I've had better hash browns.  I have faith though!!!  If I'm ever down that was before 3pm I'll do it right and get me some great southern cookin'."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the breakfast at all.  Can't say it was terrible, since it's eggs and corned beef hash, which you really just heat and serve.  Serving size was on the small-side.  Even the biscuits and toast (yes, toast) were just not good.  Previously had the biscuits and gravy.  Generous serving, but devoid of any flavor or seasoning. Service was good, place is clean, people are nice.  Just underwhelmed...  This place has the look and feel of that special home-cooked restaurant, but that is where it ends. Spent $28 for two adults and one child, before tip.   I alway wondered why the parking lot was full, and it dawned on me while writing this that there are no other breakfast spots within ten miles!   I think with IHOP open in Ballantyne, you would be better served to take the extra time to get there. Maybe the dinner menu is better...  *UPDATE*  In the spirt of fairness, I re-visited Di-Dee's and had a much better experience.  Food was very good.  While I still think it' a bit  pricey, food was hot and service was great.  Now I felt like I was eating a country-breakfast.  Coffee was very good too."}
{"text":"Great prices, great breakfast and great service.  If you're looking for a southern breakfast or a \"meat and three\" this is your place!  We live nearby and it's packed every morning and at lunch.  We've had pancakes, eggs, biscuits and gravy and lots of the veggies and we love this place.  Great, local alternative to Cracker Barrel, and WAY better than IHOP."}
{"text":"I was hoping that this place would be good.  It's one of the few local, non-corporate restaurants in the area.  I've been here for breakfast twice and lunch once.  The breakfast food is absolutely terrible and the lunch is not much better.  I ordered pancakes and they tasted like they were cooked, stored away, and then re-heated in the microwave.  The chicken salad sandwich was decent but the side dishes were not very good.  I would suggest skipping this place and going to Big View Diner a few miles north on 521."}
{"text":"Want Southern comfort food?  Again and again I am impressed with the quality and authenticity of Di-Dee's food and service.  All the traditional things along with friendly service.  Now doing dinners Wednesday - Friday.  Closed on Sundays.   Pronounced Dye-Dee's for those not in the know."}
{"text":"Having had biscuits and gravy all over the south, and an ever enlarging waist line to prove it, Di-Dee's Diner has the best I have ever had. Large, light and fluffy with \"just enough spice\" gravy. A generous pour of gravy with yummy chunks of sausage. I like a stiff pour with my drinks, and a stiff pour on the gravy.  Service was very good. Ambience no big deal. I would have given the diner five stars but they didn't have real butter available. Real butter a must in my book. Much healthier than the fake stuff. Everything in moderation."}
{"text":"Not sure what the big deal is. Parking lot crowded. restaurant crowded. Our 1st time here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. Food is ordinary. Nothing special stood out. Home fries were only potatoes with a garlic flavoring. I I'd like the bacon. Coffee is mediocre at best.   Once was enough for us."}
{"text":"Awesome southern diner with cheap, quintessential North Carolina eats!"}
{"text":"Solid southern diner breakfast here this morning.  Veggie omelette (peppers, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes), seasoned hash browns, and a biscuit.  Also ordered bowl of cheese grits.     Service was lightning fast, with the meal at the table in 5 minutes after ordering.  Flavors were excellent,, egg was nice and thin with just the right amount of filling.  Grits were good flavor, and the shredded cheddar added just the right oomph.   And the buttery biscuit was a nice finish.  Top it off with smiling, healthy doses of, \"What can I get for you, sweetie?\"  and I left full, content, and a good smile of my own to start the day.  My scores on the southern diner scale:  Atmosphere:  3 Service:   5 Food:   4 Value:   4"}
{"text":"My granddaughter loves the breakfast! But I would prefer eggs over easy not scrambled!"}
{"text":"About what you would expect.  Went for breakfast this morning by myself, and it was good.  Ham & Cheese Omlette, toast and hashbrowns all were good and what I expected.  Nice, family atmosphere and not chain like at all, locally owned and a place that should be supported by the community.  Someone said they weren't open on  Sundays and that is incorrect."}
{"text":"Nothing special here, if your breakfast doesn't stand how not sure how anything else would. Better breakfast place in Indian Land that's has real home fries!"}
{"text":"Di-Dee's has truly surprised me! Their food is delicious, and the service is amazing. We love the staff and their selection of breakfast and lunch items. The country fried steak is perfect. It isn't greasy or mushy. It's crisp and crunchy, and the gravy is yummy! I always get the fried okra and mashed potatoes, and it's just like grandma's cooking. The chopped steak is also delicious. Their biscuits and gravy are so filling, with the generous portions and fantastic sausage gravy. My goal is to try more and more of their menu items, but so far I am pleased with everything that I've tasted here so far. It truly is southern cooking just like your mom or grandma's. Expect full flavor!"}
{"text":"Came for a post workout breakfast.  Ordered \"short stack platter\" containing 2 eggs, meat choice & 3 pancakes. Eggs & bacon were cooked well.  Pancakes came out piping hot & golden.  They had real butter on the table, which was a big + IMO.  The pancakes were too heavy--not light & fluffy like I prefer. Not much on atmosphere.  Heard kitchen rap music, however. I would return, but not order pancakes."}
