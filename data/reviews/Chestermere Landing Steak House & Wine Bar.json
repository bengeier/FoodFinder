{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch to check out the completely redone landing ! It looks great , tried the Clam Chowder soup ... Excellent ! The staff was attentive , the portions great size and the new menu had a few great items I am looking forward to try ! I noticed a negative review on the Landing , don't sell it short - Give it a try , you will be pleasantly surprised !"}
{"text":"I went last night and the service was good and she was friendly but the food left something to be desired.  We had steak bites and it was overcooked and dry.  The drinks were good. And it was clean and inviting atmosphere.  It was slow as we were the only ones there."}
{"text":"This place should be packed all the time - great location, great view, right on the lake - but it isn't. Yesterday for example, even though a Flames playoff game was about to start, it was empty.  I suspect it's because of the disappointing food.   Our latest experience (we've had others) was terrible nachos - not only were they expensive, our order had only about half of the toppings the menu said they came with, the cheese wasn't melted, the chips were soggy, the guacamole had a crusty shell on the top (seriously!)... frankly, the chef should have been embarrassed to send that out AND charge for it!   We might go back some day for a drink, just because of the location, but we wouldn't eat there again."}
