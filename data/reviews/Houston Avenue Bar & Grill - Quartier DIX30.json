{"text":"I have seated and ordered my dishes when started to read reviews here in Yelp ... How I regret it ... Should never entered here ... Left 1/3 of my steak cause it was uneatable ... Just avoid this place ... Service was fair though"}
{"text":"Nice decor. Average food. Good service. Music is a bit too loud in the bar section.  The waitresses are dressed too sexy. Skirts are too short. Also, I don't think heels are too practical for waitresses..."}
{"text":"I came for lunch on a Friday. They offer lunch specials which is nice. My friend and I both ordered a burger. When my plate came it had a long blond hair in it. The waitress took my plate back right away but then it took forever to have my plate back. My friend had finished his lunch and we were late to go back to work/conference when I finally got my burger which was very dry. Ambiance is alright. Not a fan of all those tall tables and food is totally better at my local burger place which is 3 times cheaper."}
{"text":"Good vibe, good people, nice decor, but the music is way too loud. They should make up their mind and find an identity: club, or lounge or restaurant. Nothing extraordinary about the food, which also take forever to be served."}
{"text":"Le Houston Dix30 n'est peut être pas le meilleur des Steak House mais le restaurant est vibrant d'action avec un DJ et des spéciaux comme les mardis sacoches et les mercredis crus. Pour ce qui est des plats le Nacho Steak est super, le tartare au boeuf est bon mais sans plus, pour ce qui est de la viande le Steak Frite laisse a désirer. Donc en conclusion j'irai plus pour un 5@7 pour un bon cocktail ou verre de vin et quelques plats à partager."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was meh."}
{"text":"Awful steak, badly cooked. Blue cheese salad was poorly executed. Horrible service even if they are scantily clad. When I talk about houstons to friends I normally say \"an upscale hooters\" in relation to the waitresses wardrobe as well as the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Made a return visit after buying gift cards at Costco ($100 for $80). Went on a Wednesday night for dinner. If you don't want loud music definitely don't sit on the bar side. We were so happy we didn't sit on bar side. Lots of TVs playing sports (soccer and baseball) which is great. Server was very nice. Food was very good. The Champignons Paris is a must. The NY strip loin medium rare was decadent. The Grillades plate is a good choice to have a bit of a few things. (4 types of meat on it including ribs). Service time was reasonable.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Ambiance endiablée, nourriture ordinaire, service très long et prix exorbitant... Recommandations pour 5 à 7 seulement."}
{"text":"Great decor & cool atmosphere, but was the food was Meh!  Honestly tried the Kale&schemers dip & was actually amazing! Once I sent it back to get heated up because it was cold. & the chef just put the whole dish the in the microwave because the chips with stale & rock hard and the plate was pipping hot! Overall good dip. But the Salmon & Beef Tartar was below average,   Good drinks though!"}
{"text":"Slow service. Food is okay, but not great. Dinning room area has a nice decor, and they cater to families."}
{"text":"Encore un restaurant qui veut avoir l'air huppé et ça ne marche absolument pas. Le restaurant est vraiment ordinaires à l'intérieur (bcp de rouge), la bouffe est chère pour la qualité et les drinks sont hors de prix.   L'ambiance est OK, sans plus."}
{"text":"Drinks are good but the ambiance could be more interesting paid 60$ for two prices are a little high!!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place a zero but I have to give them a rating. If you are expecting above and beyond food don't go here, also if are in absolute no rush to eat then come here as they take almost 2 hours to serve your food. I ordered the chicken and ribs entree, the chicken was room temperature, I sent it back and of course waiting about 20 minutes to get the same piece of chicken that they just popped in the microwave. Don't waste your time or money going to this place."}
{"text":"Ouuufffff...  The food was just delicioussssssss. I don't eat red meat very often (for health purposes) but this is by far the best I've ever had in 2016.   Not only the food is amazing, the presentation is something in the place.   I also loved the deco. A plus... the cocktails! I'm a cocktail-lover."}
