{"text":"Kaki Furai (Deep fried oysters) - $8 I don't love oysters but I actually liked this. The batter was crispy and thin and the oysters weren't dried out.  6-pack - $12 The outside of the nori was encrusted with...I want to say it was panko. It didn't look like deep fried sushi rice on the outside to me.  Spicy tuna 2 styles - $6 The pieces on the far left/right were spicy and the inside pieces were plain. Reminded me of bruschetta. But better.  Wild Jumbo Shrimp Tempura - $8 I don't mind wasabi but I wish it was on the side. Otherwise, I liked the big shrimp and the batter.  Mini Okonomiyaki - $6 Nothing spectacular, but a bit too much bonito flakes  Yaki Scallop - $12 These scallops were too dry for my liking.  Salmon on rice in soup - ? That's literally what it was to me. The broth was interesting. At the end of each bite, there was a floral scent. It was like flower-scented soup. Not bad, but just unexpected.  Service The staff was friendly and attentive throughout the meal. It would've been nice if they had told us which dish was which without being asked.  Reservations We had to call a few times before getting through to book a reservation. The deal said that reservations had to be made 24 hours in advance but we called in the afternoon and got a seat for 7pm. The place was pretty empty when we got there but was almost full by the time we left around 9. We assumed it would be busier later on as it was more of a late night eats place (5pm-2am).  Menu/prices I probably wouldn't go back if I didn't have a group deal like the one we had. We ordered 8 dishes and a beer. The total was just shy of $70 so we each ended up paying around $20 (for the coupon itself and tax+tip)."}
{"text":"I had such a great time there!  The owner came over and chatted for a bit - really nice guy.  I really enjoyed their fusion menu, and I'm really picky about japanese food.  I even liked their oysters - and I never like oysters.    The place has a great vibe, and I can't wait to go back.  If I have as much fun on my second visit, I'll definitely give them a five."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the negative reviews are about!  My fiance, and two of our friends went out on a Friday night to celebrate our engagement. I had a voucher (paid $35 for $70 worth of food and drinks, alcohol included). The food was amazing!  We all loved everything we ordered... 1 and a half dozen mixed oysters, sushi pizza, tuna sashimi, fish and chips, the grilled mackerel, steamed mussels, Japanese pancake, and the bacon with enoki mushrooms (I may have forgotten one other dish). We also ordered two pitchers of Blanche de Chamblay. We were more than satisfied with the amount of food we ate, and the drinks we had. The bill before the discount was like $170.  Perhaps a little pricey, but at about $40 per person, that's average for going to a nice restaurant in TO.   The service was pretty decent as well (we had several servers attending to us).  Perhaps the other bad experiences were due to going during happy hour? I'd think if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, the service and food will be quite to your liking - give the place another shot folks!  I would definitely go back, and recommend the place to everyone."}
{"text":"This is a Japanese tapas oyster bar. It sounds great in concept but the execution is flawed. Having recently opened, a restaurant is given a little lee-way in terms of service quality and speed. However from my visit to this location, this place needs a lot of work before it is considered acceptable. Before I start on the service and food let me warn you they have barely finished building this place, the washrooms are barely in working order and it is visibly unfinished. The business cards and menu have handwritten adjustments etc. Furthermore they were sold out of many items halfway through their dinner service.   Me and my date arrived at 8pm, were seated promptly but then saw no staff until 15 minutes later. This trend continued throughout the night and we waited for 1.5 hours before receiving any food, and this only after complaining that the food we had ordered was in fact raw (sashimi) so this could not be a realistic wait time. The poor service and wait times continued until we decided to leave after tables that arrived after us began receiving copious amounts of food. The two dishes we did receive (salmon sashimi and beef tataki) were of good quality, but the small portions and the wait negated any positive effect. I sincerely wanted to like this place but it seems they are in dire need of a floor manager and competent kitchen staff. Also this is not a cheap restaurant, the service should be on par with the price point. Best of luck Japas, if you manage to last the winter I will return."}
{"text":"Everything was extremely fresh, flavourful and fun. Thoughtful plating and playful dishes both in various styles and flexible based on taste. Tartars are super so is sushi pizza which is presented in little blocks with different toppings. Loved the Pablo fried oysters and fresh sashimi. There were plenty of melt in your mouth moments. Service is just fine."}
{"text":"Its delicious and the service is just fine.    The dishes are yummy.  Some of the reviewers here remind me of people that rate 3 star hotels horribly because they were expecting 5 star accommodations."}
{"text":"I came back here a month ago for a friend's birthday. We were the biggest table in the restaurant, and this time it was packed. They still had those combos with alcohol, which was a great deal. And the food was still as good as I remembered it. With lots of people I got to try almost everything on their menu, and there wasn't a dish I didn't like."}
{"text":"$5 j√§ger bombs on the weekend. Beer and oyster deal. Darts. Great place to hang out with your friends and have a couple of drinks. All the servers were very nice. Service is quick for a place that gets rammed on the weekends. Asian soul food on the menu. It's solid. I suggest trying the baos."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this place! We were downtown late and had a big craving for sushi or Japanese food! Luckily we ran into this place! The dark and bar like atmosphere set this restaurant apart from other Japanese restaurants! We shortly after looking at the menu realized the meaning behind the name as the menu read lots of small dishes, which all sound delicious at very cheap prices!  We ordered the B.C. Seared tuna which was amazing, as well as the fried eggplant, chirashi with salmon roe, deep fried tofu, pork belly and the soft-shell crab. We lost count of the things we ordered, and expected the bill to be around $100, to find out the bill was on $65!! We are so pleased with this place. Every dish we ordered was perfect!  Thanks guys for a good dining experience!"}
{"text":"Oysters tasted bad, like fish, and made me sick.  On top of that the owner cleared our drinks away and gave it to another customer when we went to play darts.  He took three beers and half a soju bottle away, and wouldn't compensate us properly for clearing our table without our permission. Never going back you should stay away too, or always have someone guard your drinks. Owner is an asshole and has no business sense. I would give them zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Been here numerous time, either on the legendry soju bar crawls or just to play some idarts.   dark and dingy inside, no frills kind of place. The food is average as are the drinks and soju cocktails. Does get busy on weekend nights and they serve food till 1am i think which is a bonus. Usually too short staffed late to get quick service but the girls who are usually on at that time do try their best.  Seating is awkward but if you have a good enough crowd there is fun to be had playing drinking games or the idarts machines."}
{"text":"Ommmm.  Like Guu? Well, Japas is much the same, but tranquil - intimate, even - with no wait times (that I've experienced - but I've only gone on a weeknight), more seafood choices, and some amazing steals. It's not quiiite on par with Guu food-wise, but I'm prepared to overlook the small difference for being able to talk without yelling at my friend over nevertheless delicious food that is probably on for a great deal.  Foods we ordered, in order of deliciousness:  Yaki Saba (grilled mackerel w/ sea salt) - get it.  Wild Baked Scallops (with mushroom, potato bits, and cheese) - ommmm comfort food. I always find that nobody does mushrooms quite like Japanese restos. Aburi Saba Sushi (torched mackerel sushi) - reminiscent of seared tuna, but much much better because it's (ceviche-style) mackerel. Fish Tacos - excellent. Japan and Mexico coming together for a good cause. Wild Jumbo Shrimp Tempura - good; the wasabi mayo is a must. Japas Salad - a nice enough starter. Grilled Chilean Seabass - okay, but I guess I was expecting more.  We also shared a glass of the plum wine for dessert. I am now looking for places to buy plum wine (message me if you have a source!).  I will be back for some excellent japas (jap tapas!), hopefully using their impressive promotions. $1 oysters anyone?"}
{"text":"I came here for a Yelp event earlier today.   The fried chicken was excellent. As was the company of my fellow yelpers.   the drinks where cheap and everyone that I spoke to who ordered of the menu was happy with their food.  I will defiantly come back."}
{"text":"I went with a friend and my daughter, we traveled in Japan 2 summers ago. We found the food and atmosphere at Japas excellent, as good as the food in Japan which is  consistently superior to Canada. Note: we were not \"high end\" travelers so did not eat $300 meals in Japan, nor do we in Toronto.  We used a coupon last night, will definitely go again without coupon. Japas is excellent value, everything was delicious. The okonomiyaki was better than when we had it in Hiroshima. We had a great time."}
{"text":"- if you want an izakaya experience with no yelling everytime someone walks in and out, then this is your place. - oysters are well priced and their happy hour like everyone says is a STEAL - one thing about the oysters are that i kept finding small bits of shell (meaning the shucker needs some practice) - yaki saba (grilled mackerel) is very good. - okonomiyaki isnt great."}
{"text":"This is an overall mediocre restaurant. Many other japanese izakayas in Toronto are better. The wait time for each dish (except for the oysters) were super long, and it would be really hard if you are going there hungry. After we received the oysters, it took more than 30 mins for another dish to come out. Even though their restaurant was half seated. We also ordered two dishes on the menu which they ran out of and was unable to deliver. They do have some good deals everyday so it would be worth it to go there for the deals of the day."}
{"text":"This place.... is just not worth it. Very small and packed with people. There are two electronic darts stations, which are fun.  The service here isn't the best. Just takes a long time to get a drink (unless you go up to the bar). I got their special chu-hi (which is an alcoholic beverage with a popsicle in it.) the popsicle was supposed to be mango, but I got melon instead. Usually I'd be ok with alcoholic, but with certain circumstance, I asked for non-alcoholic, which was still the same price as alcoholic. Basically paid $9 for a cup of sprite with a popsicle in it. If I knew it was melon, I would not have gotten this.   I'd probably stick to their beers instead of any specials.   Come early if for a table or if you want to play darts."}
{"text":"The experience I had at this bar was awful and I'm not coming back here again. The worst place I have ever been to in Toronto.  First when we came in the bartender sat us and after a 10 mins waiting time no one came to our table. Then my friend had to come up to the bartender to order drinks, and my friend told me that the bartender completely forgot us even she sat us! What got us mad was what she did next, the bar wasn't busy at all but the bartender was doing something else. And after another 10 mins we noticed that she even haven't poured our beers yet! And we had to tell another server to remind the bartender, then the server told her and she acted like she forgot our order because she just poured the beer right away... Finally we finished the beer and was ready for the bill, she brought the bill and again.... the bill was wrong."}
{"text":"It's great during weekdays too! It's true that they really need to improve on the service as one of the server really didn't understand what we want to order.  We tried to order yakitori with salt and 2 with sauce (teriyaki sauce), but we end up missing 1 order of the teriyaki sauced (yakitori/beef skewer/chicken wings), so that's a bit of a miss there.  The men's washroom finally to the point of ready, as the urinal are working now.  They changed their tuna carpacho, from 5 pieces of thick tuna, to now 8 pieces of thin tuna. I like it the old ways, but totally understandthe change, as it's better for large group to share.  This time me and my friends had a few more things (on top of things I had last time): Ikasugatayaki Enoki Bacon Chicken wing (as one order has 1 wing, can't really call it wings, right?) Mini okonomiyaki Kaki furai Japas salad Ankou karaage (they said it's \"monk fish\" on the menu)  And we had Bagna cauda too, it's in a thick paste, instead of a sauce.  Enoki Bacon is great, how can you not love bacon with mushroom?  Drinks are cool too! (Please see pictures) Popsicle Hi are really with a popsicle stuck in the glass!  We were the first table of the night, and a lot of people came in after us. After we left, we found out that there is a happy hour menu, but probably we can only take advantage of it on weekends.  Any event in that area? XD"}
{"text":"I love this place and now have been about 5 times. I think it must have improved because I'm always shocked by bad customer service and they are very attentive here and kind. The food is AMAZING. Oysters are a great great great deal if you come Mondays and Tuesdays. I would give this restaurant a much higher rating but I find all the other dishes way too frugal -- I understand it's meant as Tapas but come on folks, food is delicious but presentation way too frugal for the steep price."}
{"text":"I don't know of any other place in Koreatown where:  *you can drink $7 pitchers of beer with drool worthy fried chicken on a Sunday,  *you can play electronic darts and wake up with a sore forearm the next day, or  *you can order a flaming birthday shot with your squirmy udon noodles.    I'm always shocked the bill isn't double the price. Also: incredibly friendly staff & customers--you can always make a friend at Japas."}
{"text":"I'm a bit conflicted with rating this bar. They do have excellent prices for beer, especially if your coming in a group. There's a ton of seating space for both large groups and small groups. The atmosphere is lively and service is quick. There's not many vegetarian items but if you're a meat eater, the prices are good are good. Cocktail prices are similar to other bars in the area but they have a bigger drink menu. If you're ordering a veggie appetizer, it's expensive for the portion size and the  quality. The major issue I had was that when I paid in cash, the server never came back with my change. She gave herself a 30% tip by not giving back my change. I would have liked to be given the opportunity to decide how much off a tip I would leave. If you're coming here, I'd recommend paying debit or credit."}
{"text":"This could've been a potential 4 stars, but the tasty food was tainted by abominable service.    Japas is a Japanese tapas bar that recently opened up in Koreatown in the old Camto spot which aims to be anti-izakaya culture (e.g. you can eat in peace without the roaring battle cries every single time a new customer walks in).    J-pop beams off of 1 of 4 television sets above the bar with the accompanying music which serves as the tunes for the evening.   The decor is not dissimilar with mostly bamboo and wooden furnishings and long communal tables.  Those who come in twos get the discomfort of sitting on booster seats (aka high tops).   Drinks include beer (domestic + imported), a short list of wines and sake, as well as Chu-Hi, Soju and various sodas.    Let's start with the positive.  The food is quite good and quite reasonably priced.  We started with a skewer of Bacon-Wrapped Enoki ($3 each) which comes with 3 pieces per skewer and it had a great smokey flavour to it.  Like!  The Okonomiyaki, a Japanese pancake stuffed with squid and topped with mayonnaise, and bonito flakes had a nice crust, similar to the kind you get at the bottom of a bowl of Korean clay pot rice which added a lot of flavour.    The Grilled Mackarel topped with Sea Salt was served with Ponzu sauce.  While the fish had a nice flavour, I felt that parts of it were beyond seared (read, burnt).    We also opted for the Salmon Sushi + Salmon Roe on a bed of rice which comes sprinkled with seaweed, a blob of wasabi and soy sauce.  The salmon roe was what really made this dish - we're not talking the miniscule balls of crunchiness that you normally see at AYCE sushi buffets, but the tapioca-sized ones that are bursting with salty flavour.  You could even skip the soy sauce on this one.  The last thing we tried was a Monk Fish Karaage.  While many izakayas are making the chicken variety, I quite enjoyed this twist on karaage.  The firm texture of the monk fish could quite possibly convince you that you were eating chicken.  Not too oily.  However, it could've benefited form a condiment of sorts.    We had also originally ordered a half dozen of Kumamoto Oysters (reasonably priced at $20) but after plate after plate of tapas came out, while countless plates of oysters passed us by to other tables, we simply thought they had forgotten.    When we asked for the bill, the server, who could barely speak English brought us another beer.  And then she told us that the oysters were coming up.  At this point, we asked her to cancel because it didn't seemingly make sense to end our meal with what should've came first.  Happy hour sees full pitchers + your choice of tapas dish for about $28.  Our bill came to about $45 (which included a beer and glass of plum wine).   There is hope that Japas can improve.  If the food was terrible, it would be harder to fix.  But lousy service is more easily remedied.   CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"The lovely Toronto Yelp CM was kind of enough to organize an event here and got us some Sapporo, fried chicken and edamane.  I have to admit, that despite my attempted aversion to fried food, I took one bite and thought it tasted amazing.  It had a good amount of meat in it and wasn't overly battered.    In addition, I also ordered the sashimi platter.  The presentation was very good and all the fish pieces were very fresh.  However, they could have been seasoned a bit better.  It was refreshing, but it lacked a certain je ne sais quois compared to the more authentic sushi joints.  Ah well, it was still good and reasonable at 18.95.    In terms of the atmosphere, it's pretty chill and their electronic dart games are pretty cool.    Verdict: pretty decent place to hang out for drinks and light snacks."}
{"text":"Food is okay and beer specials are cheap, but the service sucks balls.  Maybe because the owner is a prick and never smiling. 15% gratuity added to a group 4/5+ which is ludicrous and not posted anywhere.  Go somewhere else if you care about customer service."}
{"text":"Wth is up with these good comments below? Prolly the cheap foamy beer talking I'd say which is mainly the reason why people come to this place anyways. The servers are nice but the owner is fucked up and Japas please stop serving your shitty poutine, its a disgrace to us canadians. Oysters are also shit so i dont know why you guys call yourself an oyster bar. Also why is your main door your fire exit!? It is right infront of your kitchen too! Maybe i should call the fire inspector unless if you are planning to burn everyone inside when your bar is on fire. If you to this DO NOT get an mains, tapas, rice&noodles, and grill food which pretty much their whole menu except for the drinks. Don't forget to bitchslap the owner when you drop by =)"}
{"text":"Love this Korean bar! Has good service and music! Good for groups. Has electronic darts to entertain while you're eating/drinking. Food is decently priced."}
{"text":"Been there couple time. Location is great, TTC accessible, price listed on the menu is not including tax, food is overpriced. Service is really just okay. I went there few times in 2 months. One time was on Tuesday night around 8:30 pm, the waitress didn't see me, so I didn't get service until I reminded her which was 30 mins later. Last time I went there with 3 friends, we only ordered few beer, juice and my friend ordered a double whiskey shot and a glass of water. She forgot to bring water for my friend, I actually predicted that she would forget to bring water over.  When we paid our bills, she added gratuity without notifying us. My order was 2 beer (6.5*2), my bill was 16.64. I noticed that the bill was a bit high, so I asked the waitress, then she told me for a group of 4, they add gratuity and she looked like she deserved 15% tip. Their gratuity is 15%, this is bull shit. Copacabana's gratuity is 18% for a group of 6 and they offered excellent service."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying this place and surprisingly the food was very good! The price is fair for the big portions.. Definitely worth trying !   I had the salmon sashimi and salmon roe on rice and it was amazing! We also had the PEI mussels in a sake broth and the portion was big and it was delicious. My boyfriend had the ramen lunch special and the ramen is comparable to more expensive ramen restaurants, definitely not as bad as some of the reviews has mentioned below! Service was great!"}
{"text":"Dined here last night and must say it was hands-down the worst dining experience I've had in Toronto.   First thing - don't call yourself an \"oyster bar\" if you don't know how to serve oysters. The shucker has clearly never been trained (a trend we find continues with the rest of the staff) and I found chunks of shell in the oyster, some were still attached to the shell with their adductor muscles... and the most horrible part - 50% of the oysters they served on my plate were bad and reeked of dead fish.  It took an hour to get our drinks and first order (raw oysters) and had to complain to find out what's taking our food so long. The staff were unresponsive and incapable of service. We wondered if it was just us, and started watching the service at the tables around us. The couple next to us asked twice to get 2 glasses of water. The same thing happened with their sake. Their food was served before they received their drinks.   Got to the point where we couldn't help but start laughing at how horrible the experience was. Everything that could have gone wrong did, to the point that we expected our sashimi to come out frozen and applauded when it didn't. The sushi pizza was burnt, the edamame took almost 2 hours to arrive at the table (cold), the sushi tasting dish included dairy-based sauces on 2/3rds of the sushi served (gross), and it goes on and on.   My date had to run to the washroom during dinner because the food wasn't sitting well. BUT the university crowd seemed to enjoy the pitchers of beer and promotions being served. Perhaps that's Japas' sweet spot: university students who come for the beer and specials.   The food was terrible. The service was laughably bad. The prices (unless you are there for a promotion/special like their happy hour) are outrageous for the crap they serve - comparable to a Yuzu or Blowfish.   My advice: save yourself the food poisoning, don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"Reasons why japas is going down hill. Japas was the only place which offered electrotics darts, native to japan and south Korea. But here is their new law, you cant throw up in their bar other wise they are going to charge you 50 dollars. What bar charges a customer for over drinking at their bar. If you spend more to drink the penalty is pay us more. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"freshest sashimi I've had in a long time. excellent oysters, service was perfect. My husband, son and I went, and had a great meal."}
{"text":"#JAPAS #TAPAS #KOREATOWN #TORONTO #YELP  This is no Guu. And it's kind of stinky near the entrance. (line up of garbage bins)  BUT... it's surprisingly fun and cozy. The electronic darts looked fun; although I didn't get to try it, was too busy chatting up a storm with friends and fellow Yelpers.   We tried the fried chicken; the best I've ever had, I think. I can't think of any place that had better.   Would love to come back to Japas when I am around Koreatown again."}
{"text":"Food: pricey for the location, nothing special, smallish portions  Service: nothing special...kinda slow  Atmosphere: good for drinks on weekends otherwise half empty on weekdays  Overall: lame"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars for having affordable food and drink in the bloor west area. Pitchers run around $19 and a lot of reasonably priced bar food. We had the takoyaki for $7.5 for 7 balls, and it was pretty good though not as good as you'd get at a place like guu/kinka.  Still a good choice for a night out as drinks and food are affordable, you're probably only looking to snack here though with your drinks, not really a restaurant vibe.   They also have darts you can play, $10 deposit to rent darts (returned when you're done), and $1 per person per game of darts."}
{"text":"BAH! I was really excited about going here. Out of three different places that I looked up on Yelp, my mother and I chose this place for my last dinner in Toronto. What a bad choice.  We chose this place because, on their website, they offered buck-a-shuck oysters on Tuesdays. We arrived around 5:30pm, so it was fairly early (considering they're open till 3am). They were out of all the oysters they offer for the special. Should have been our first warning sign that this place wasn't a good idea. You'd assume that if you are offering a special, that you would have that item in stock, or offer the customer other oysters for the same value. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!! What a rip.  Ordered more things off the menu. The waitress kept coming back and saying they didn't have those items in stock. I got pretty annoyed and asked her \"Can you just tell me what you DO have available\". I got kicked under the table by my mum, since she thought I was being rude, but honestly, it was justified. I'm usually very friendly at to people in the service industry... and just in general. But when I get crappy service, I'm going to voice my displeasure.   Here's what we did order:   NOT buck-a-shuck oysters: Good size, and only got one bit of shell. Not worth the price. Surf Clam sashimi: Good. Not the best I've had, but definitely not the worst.  Pork Belly Chashu (A Special): Eh.... It wasn't what I was expecting. I googled what it was supposed to look like, and it DID NOT resemble what the internet expected it to look like. Ewwww.  Deep Fried Smelts: Super greasy. I've made deep fried smelts before & had them at other restaurants. My mum ate it, since it's one of the only things she found edible.  Deep fried oysters: So much batter. The dips they provided did not mesh well.  Monk Fish Liver: I sent this back. I was really excited when I saw it on the menu. NOPE. It was frozen and full of ice crystals. I'm pretty sure it was freezer burned.  Seared B.C. Tuna: Cold (if it was just seared), so the texture made it pretty hard to keep it down. Also did not expect the presentation of raw red onions, cucumber and sliced cherry tomatoes. I did not think we ordered a salad.  Beef on skewers: Actually okay. The sauce had kinda congealed on the meat funny, but it was one of the better things I ordered.  Baby Mushrooms wrapped in bacon: The bacon was almost raw where the grill didn't hit it. Health hazard?  Lychee Sake Drink (not sure what it was called):  I thought I ordered one of those drinks with a popsicle in it (since that's what it was listed under). I didn't send it back, I didn't want to anymore, and we were almost ready to leave. It was REALLY good though... maybe since everything else was such a disappointment lol    I would not suggest this place if you are looking for Japanese Tapas. Apparently there a quite a few better options in the city. Got a feeling this place is only good if you're already drunk & don't really care what you eat. Yuck. I'm feeling sick just thinking about this place."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with a few friends. We ordered the soba noodles and salmon sashimi rice. The food was mediocre- very simple and can make it tastier at home. We also ordered the 2.5L litre beer tower of steam whistle for $30 and really enjoyed that. They also have two darts machine with loads of people playing on it so we didn't get a chance to play. I came here before just to play darts and would come here again just for the same reason. Japas is a nice place in the Annex for drinks (wouldn't come here for food) and darts."}
{"text":"I'm guessing Japas made a big improvement from what I read on yelp. I visited Japas with my bf last Tuesday night and we had absolutely no expectations for this place because many yelpers said that it had really poor service and food.  It was very quiet with less than half tables full. The waitresses brought us menu shortly after we were seated and took our order promptly.  We got a number of dishes and most of them were well above average - sushi pizza, tuna on baguette, baked oysters, deep fried battered oysters, mini okonomiyaki, grilled squid with ginger sauce, beef tataki, mushroomed wrapped in bacon... Good quality and decoration of every single dish. I've read here on yelp that oysters were poorly shucked, but ours were fine and fresh. I particularly liked the grilled squid with ginger sauce, it was cooked perfectly with just right level of tenderness and chewiness (not sure if that's even a word lol). Raw beef (beef tataki) was really good too. I was pretty skeptical about it before ordering because I've never had red meat that raw before but they made it really good. My bf really enjoyed mushrooms wrapped in bacon - he said they had that really good slightly burnt taste. I'm not a big fan of bacon so I'm not sure. It was good though.  The service was great. The two waitresses that were serving us spoke little English but were very friendly and attentive. They filled my glass of water as soon as it was empty and when my bf finished his beer, they brought him a glass of water without us having to ask. They also brought us extra plates when our individual plates got messy.  The speed was pretty fast. Yes there were moments when we finished our dishes before the next one got served but the wait never went beyond 5 minutes or so.  Overall it was a pleasant experience for both of us. I would recommend this place if you wish to eat and drink at an izakaya style bar with no yelling and loud music."}
{"text":"This place was introduced to me by Yelp! At an unofficial yelp event. This place is a small bar located close to Christie subway station. The service was pleasant! The staff kept bringing us beer and snacks! The snacks were edamame and crispy battered chicken! I am a big fan of boneless crispy battered chicken, and Japas served us a great one! There batter coating the chicken made it delicious and the perfect partner for the beer! This place also has a cool dart board! An interactive yet casual place to meet friends after work."}
{"text":"Found this dark little corner restaurant on Bloor when we were hunting for last minute oysters. Japas is open until 2am on weekdays too! The place is very dark but not in a bad way - it has a nice feel and the mood music was definitely set well.   Initial hiccup when we walked in and there was no one to greet us. We ended up walking to the back of the restaurant before we found staff to get us seated. It was kind of empty, but with the promotions I was surprised it wasn't more full. Dollar oysters on Mondays and Tuesdays, and half off their Japanese \"tapas\" on Wednesdays with the purchase of a pitcher.   We got some beers and a plate of oysters. The oysters were a little slow in coming, but we were pretty pleasantly surprised when they arrived. They were plump, medium sized malpeques in nice, salty brine. They definitely don't skimp on toppings - you get a cocktail sauce, a gingery orange sauce, and a brown salty sauce. Best part - we got real shredded horseradish instead of the preserved stuff.  I can see how the oysters were a little poorly shucked - there weren't any shell pieces or anything really gross, and each oyster sat in a delicious pool of brine. A lot of the oysters were still connected to the shell, but honestly that's OK - it doesn't take much effort to scoop your fork through before you eat it.   Definitely will be back next week - not perfect, but love the price and the specials."}
{"text":"Probably the most horrible place I have been to in all of Toronto. I'm very surprised at the positive comments below. The place will not do well if they do not make improvements on quality of service, food, and prices.  I have been to this place twice since it opened. To see what Camto(the bar before Japas) had become is a true disappointment. Firstly, it is not a true izakaya if there are no free side dishes (Otoushi) when you first arrive.   The first time we went, my boyfriend ordered a bowl of rice for his grilled saba(mackerel). The saba... was probably the most delicious thing on the menu, so kudos to them! However, the rice arrived cold... as though they had scooped cold rice into the bowl and forgot to microwave it. This is beyond taboo. It's like they accidentally revealed a secret! Anyways, we asked them to heat it for him and the waitress looked very embarrassed and quickly went to reheat it. When it came, the middle of the rice was still cold.  We also ordered two draft Sapporo pints. And for a true beer drinker, you could immediately tell the beer was old. It was slightly rancid and flat. I called the waitress and told her in Japanese that the beer was flat and she offered to pour us another pint, but I refused since the second batch probably would have been the same.  I had the Kaiseki Oyakodon which was Salmon sashimi and salmon roe over rice, which was not as bad as I had expected... but really, how can you go wrong with sashimi... you don't have to cook it.   The second time we went, which was a few weeks later the gifty bouquet of dead flowers were still in display at the front entrance. My boyfriend insisted we give them another chance since they really messed up the last time.   This time we ordered 2 bottles of Coors Light, a bowl of Udon for me, and fish and chips for him. The bowl of udon was obviously instant. Frozen raw udon and Kikkoman Menmi soup base. The udon was over cooked, and the soup was so thick and sweet I could not eat it. My boyfriend's fish and chips were also a disappointment. The fried fish were size of two man's thumbs, and the \"chips\" were cold and oily. Tar tar sauce was great though, it probably came from a jar.  All in all, if you're going to serve guests instant food, you might as well go the extra mile and be creative. I understand it's the age of the izakaya battle for Toronto, but this is what happens when you have Chinese capitalists thinking they can get away with overpricing a service they can not even master. If they really want to get in on all the action, they either need to hire a few Japanese chefs to run the kitchen or go to Japan themselves and see the real deal, instead of imitating what's here in Toronto."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot to hang out. Had $10 pitchers of PBR beer, oysters, nachos, poutine and wings. Food was decent. Service was excellent. Server was knowledgeable about food. She was very friendly and was always there. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I had Japas bookmarked after I missed Lady E's CMYE back in June.  Came by on a Wednesday night after work.  It was pretty quiet even though a soccer game was on.  We basically had the place to ourselves.  Ordered:  a pitcher of Blanche du Chambly ($18) which allowed us to get the oyster special (12 malpeque for $12), grilled calamari ($9), mussels in sake ($5) and karaage  ($4).  Snacks were tasty with the exception of the calamari which was overcooked and cold.    Fun place to grab some drinks and a nice twist on traditional wings/nacho bar food."}
{"text":"My friend recommended Japas on a Friday night. We got there super early at 6pm when they opened.  Apparently the place gets pretty packed which I witnessed. It's a really cute tapas place with booze and dart boards.  We ordered a bunch of tapas which was ok not amazing. My tonkatsu ramen was tasteless and not good at all. However the alcohol selection was plentiful! They have $9 cocktail drink specials as well at 3 shots for $13! Amazing.  I never played darts but had an amazing time. Around 11 pm they have a DJ come in playing amazing music. Great place to hang out with friends if you want some food to eat, play darts or watch the game. I had a great time and will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"$10 pitchers of PBR and the $9 tuna sashimi - so nice we ordered it twice!  I'm a bit of a Jewish (North) American Princess when it comes to sashimi, because I don't like imagining some stark vaginal tragedy when I'm eating raw tuna.  Thank you to Japas for accommodating.  This was completely fresh and delicious, and the shrimp tempura (3 for $6) were huge and crunchy. Presumably thawed from frozen, but, still tasty snacks. Malpeque oysters on special is a lovely variety and there's Tuesday buck'a'shuck!  I was interested in the wall art, which involves a painting of a woman wearing frilly panties looking over her shoulder at you. I mean, okay.  Otherwise, the decor is completely pleasant. Dark, barn boarded (duh) and air conditioned. Sweltering on Bloor with a couple of friends, it was a glorious brine and dine experience."}
{"text":"Seriously, they call themselves  an Oyster bar?  Japas' oysters might be one of my worst oysters encounter. The Fanny Bay we ordered for 7 for $10 were not fresh. They smelled funky and not of the smell of the ocean. The water it soaked in looked milky.  The crushed ice they were served on was half melted.  Service was slow and indifference even when we were the only customers for the afternoon. We were given chopsticks to eat our oysters...   I don't know if I would be coming back. At least not for any of their oysters!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE never coming back. How can they call themselves an oyster when they serve bad oysters. The only thing they have going for them is the darts, if it weren't for that I wouldn't even go here.  The oysters tasted like they've been sitting out for a long time, definitely not fresh. A strong fish odor and taste. I hope I don't get food poisoning tomorrow.  Save yourselves the money and hit another restaurant/bar in the area."}
{"text":"They remedied their poutine situation, and their darts are really, really fun.   Also, on Sunday evenings they do $7 pitchers of PBR with food! This kind of deal merits an extra star."}
