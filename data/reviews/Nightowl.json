{"text":"The Mac and cheese is unreal!!!! Drinks are affordable, food is good and super cheap. It's a good place to go with one friend or 20. Everyone is super friendly too"}
{"text":"Service is a joke, waited around 10 minutes at the bar to get served while it wasn't even busy. Service is slow and not friendly at all. Literally the slowest service I've ever seen at a bar."}
{"text":"Nice staff, amazing music and always a fun time!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite bars on College st. The food prices increased from last year, when they had a $6 menu very similar to Queen St. Warehouse. To make matters worse, the portions shrunk by 50%.   Ordered buttermilk chicken wings, mac and cheese, and some nacho dish. We were served 2 chicken wings, 4 spoon fulls of mac and cheese, and literally 3 nacho chips on a dish. All of this came out to $40 after tax and tip?!  Next time, I will stick to drinks and the dance floor downstairs. Although the quality of food was good and dishes were tasty, the portion size was dissapointing."}
{"text":"Swanky joint with neon decor everywhere reminiscent of arcades without the sleazy darkness. Good choice in top 40s music and beer as well. I went with my usual partner in crime and we got a boozy \"Night owl\" float (root beer and vanilla ice cream) which was delicious but I was left wanting more.  There are 7 games as of writing: a hockey game, beer pong, aliens aremageddon, big bucks, guitar hero, foosball, and a racing game. Not as big as other arcades but a good vibe as promised for sure! Games are between a loonie and a toonie but feel like a good length.  Washrooms are clean and have a unique decor for the girl's. They also have a live music venue where the washrooms are at. 4/5"}
{"text":"I don't thinks this place has been open long but after a few weekend visits I am a fan.   Very fresh venue, on walking in you will notice first the arcade machines on the right, at which point you will make a promise to yourself to not waste those loonies jangling in your pocket. You will fail, so just embrace the games after a few drinks.  Right at the back is a fairly cramped seating area, the staff at night owl can accommodate for large group bookings.  The bar area has a decent amount of standing room, and the staff have always been great fun. Downstairs there is a stage and area for the live music. I totally missed this the last time i went.  Great addition to college west if you are looking for low key fun."}
{"text":"With my 30th birthday approaching and not wanting to go with the obligatory nightclub scene to ring in a new decade, I was looking for a bar that had a little something extra to make the night special. I came across Nightowl Toronto and found that they had a live band on Saturday nights as well as arcade games and a foosball table. Pretty much exactly what I was looking for.  I booked a reservation via their Facebook page and they were very responsive and helpful with my request. On the night of, I didn't realize I had booked a \"standing reservation\" so we didn't actually have a table reserved for our group. The guy who had helped me book the reso was there that night and was apologetic for the confusion. He ended up getting us free coat check for the inconvenience, which completely solved the problem of not having a table to leave our coats at anyway. Perfect! My birthday guests were more than happy with the compromise and so was I.   The band - The Moonwalks - were AMAZING! They played indie rock, EDM, 70's classic rock, and everything in between. I danced most of the night away without even noticing the time. The bar was busy but not wall to wall. We had lots of space to dance and roam around and we had an easy time getting drinks when we wanted them. Some friends were downstairs on the dancefloor and others were upstairs playing games most of the night. Everyone had a great time!  All in all, I loved this place! I had a very memorable 30th birthday and would recommend this place to anyone wanting to have a good night with friends.   Thanks Nightowl!!"}
{"text":"I had heard some good things about Nightowl and decided to give it a shot on date night. I was really disappointed.  The good things - the place is really cool, lots of young people hanging out to have drinks or food. The main floor is the restaurant with some arcade games, and the basement level is a full dance floor with a DJ.   We were able to get two seats right away (no reservation) but the place was always full. They have a cocktail list named after Toronto streets/neighbourhoods - I got the St. Clair and I thought there was barely an alcohol in there. Partner lamented over the poor beer selection - very generic, main stream beers.   Food - we ordered the calimari, shrimp tacos, and mac n cheese.  Calimari - very chewy. They had a sauce on top (peanut?) which was delicious and they serve it with a side of actually hot hot sauce. But super, super chewy calimari  Shrimp tacos - good. nothing great. Shrimp were properly cooked  Mac n Cheese - Served in a small cast iron pot with a great breadcrumb topping it had all the potential to be delicious. But it was not. How do you make mac n cheese taste bland? Like cheese inherently is tasty - you barely have to do any work!! I had to ask for salt to get at least some flavor and it could not be rectified. I couldn't even finish it (and I'll eat KD!)  Our server could not be bothered with us - took a while to get a second round of drinks.   Plus side: they play some great hip hop on the first floor. Maybe I would come back to go dancing but never, ever for the food."}
{"text":"We ordered the tasting menu, and tried a little bit of everything. Everything we had was tasty, but the standouts were the pork belly bao and the buttermilk fried chicken wings. The portions were perfect for two people to share. Also: Salted Caramel Old Fashioned. Yum."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good food. The owners are very nice and make me feel welcome. Great staff especially Dave and hailey, they are amazing and took great care of us!   Thanks night owl!"}
{"text":"Love this new addition to the Little Italy scene! After bar hopping on College Street on a Saturday night, we came across this place and decided to end our night here. Great vibe, not too hipster and my friends and I (all in our 30s) didn't feel too old like we might in other places along the strip - crowd was mostly late 20s. Upstairs there are Atari arcade games, pinball machine and a foosball table and downstairs is live music. The beer selection is small and I can't speak for the cocktails or food as we didn't try them, but I'll definitely be making a point to stop here again for a beer and a game or two of Bubble Bobble next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, friendly staff, good drink selection.   We went in around 9pm on a Friday night, their restaurant was full but we were happy to sit and eat the bar. We ordered the wings and calamari, and wanted the riblets but they were sold out; we got the shrimp tacos instead.   The shrimp tacos were stellar! The wings were good, but for $10 we would have expected more than 4 pieces. The calamari was delicious but I wished the rings were smaller since it is all finger food. They were very accommodating when I asked for hot wing sauce on the side as well since my friend wanted honey garlic wings, and I wanted hot.   Would definitely go back, especially to finally try those riblets!"}
{"text":"Come early to get seats!  This place is incredible! My boyfriend and I came on a Sunday and listened to Frank Ryan and his band. We love live music, and his band was the best we've heard in Toronto. The crowd is great and lively. The staff always came to check up on us despite how busy the restaurant was. The mixed drinks are pretty awesome, I really enjoyed the one I had that I believe had jalapeno in it. There are a few snacks available, but I recommend eating dinner before you come here. The art is wonderful, and I love the lights. I like that are games at the front of the restaurant and board games available if you ask for them.  We will most certainly be back with more friends!"}
{"text":"Great bar!  Friendly staff, tasty drinks and great live music.  Highly recommended for all occasions."}
{"text":"After reading all the astroturfed 5 star reviews from users with only 1 review (not to mention suspiciously high quality pictures of the food, drinks taken from the serving side of the bar etc, and of course the cringeworthy use of the word bae), I came here with skeptical expectations. Turns out, this place is alright.   I haven't been inside this building since it was called the Grotto and had the cave like architecture throughout the dining area. That has been scrapped and the renovations make the place look new and clean.  Ground floor has a fooseball table, pinball, and a couple of video games to play near the front. After throwing a few loonies into an arcade and playing some vintage Bubble Bobble with a beer in my hand, the night was off to a decent start. While some places like Get Well let you play the games for free, charging for them here means that people don't sit on the same game all night, so more people will get a chance to play which is a good thing since there isn't many games to work with. There is a jukebox as well which admittedly was playing some fun music. Heard everything from classics like the Pixies to Green Day to modern stuff like the Weeknd and whoever does that catchy song that I'm pretty sure is in a beer or car commercial. The rest of the upstairs is the bar area and then a raised dining area in the back. I stuck to drinks but the food did look pretty decent and at reasonable prices. On the drinks front, draft beer options fall under Sapporo ownership (so Sapporo itself, plus Sleeman Original, Okanagan Springs 1516 Lager and Pale Ale, and something else I can't remember).  Downstairs has a small bar (no beer taps downstairs), and then a stage for live music. For a Thursday night, I was surprised how busy it was, so the place has a good energy (even if the musical acts may not be very inspiring, but at least there wasn't a cover fee).  For me, College Street has always been an area which is all about bar hopping and being able to hit multiple places over the course of the night. Admittedly this place makes for a good place to stop into for that purpose, so 4 Yelp stars it is."}
{"text":"The live band on saturday was outstanding! Brass/hip hop freestyle~ Cheap drinks, awesome decor and friendly vibe all around."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night for the live band (90s hip hop and R&B). We arrived at 9:30 and the first floor restaurant/bar was already packed. There was about a 10 minute wait for drinks at the bar. The downstairs for the live band area was empty though, but quickly filled up as the night went on.  The music/band was really great! My girl friends and I had a blast dancing. Ventilation wasn't great in the filled room though, so it got pretty hot and sweaty. Definitely not too bad compared to other typical club scenes.  We tried several of their signature cocktails and really enjoyed the Augusta and Eglinton West. I would pass on the Little Italy though, unless you're a fan of super bitter drinks. I thought the price was a little expensive for the serving size though.  Overall, I really enjoyed the vibe. The crowd was mostly late 20s to early 30-year-olds, so fun, but no obnoxious drama. Everything was also super clean (washrooms were impeccable!). Would definitely come back, maybe earlier for some dinner as well."}
{"text":"Nightowl is an excellent place to spend a Friday night if you're looking for something casual.   This place has a pretty decent selection of food and drinks especially compared to competing bars with a similar atmosphere in the area. Nothing is going to rock your socks off, but there's something for everybody. After you've had your fair share of adult beverages, make sure to get down to the basement and dance. Chances are, there's a local band playing decent covers of 90s-00s pop/rock hits that'll get your feet moving.  It's a good time that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"This bar is fantastic! My partner and I had a really enjoyable Night at Nightowl. I have no problem giving it 5 stars for the atmosphere and the service. The bartenders were upbeat and engaged even though it was busy! The arcade games were a lot of fun and the live band was amazing. I would recommend this bar to anyone looking to have a phenomenal night out."}
{"text":"This might just be my new fave place for cheap drinks.  How can you go wrong with cheap sangria, beer and bar rail? Sure, the cheapest price for the drinks start early at 6pm and gradually gets a bit more pricier by the hour..but why not start your night early at Nightowl and bar hop to other bars as the night goes on?!   My friends and I tried the sangria for $9.70 since we arrived a little past 7pm.  We didn't know about the staircase special, but if we did, we would have gotten a pitcher each!  Since the price wasn't bad, we decided to get the white and red sangria.  They weren't skimpy on the wine even tho it was on special and it tasted good.  I would def come back for more of their cheap drinks!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.   Okay, So I did have a really great time here...just there was a few things that brought the overall rating down.   I'll begin with the reason that brought the overall rating down. There is one man who seemed to be working there that was HIGHLY judgmental. He almost made me cry. It put a bit of a bad hue on the whole evening, but I tried to let it go to not have the whole thing ruined. I walked up to the jukebox that is in the building for customer use...myself and my friend placed a toonie in for 4 songs, my friend picked two, and then It was my turn to pick two after they played. I walked up quickly and played the first thing I saw that I enjoyed that was slightly more 'group' friendly. (Abba-Dancing Quuen) and the employee walked up and asked what I put on. I told him, and he said \"wow\" (condescendingly) \"Its a little early for Dancing Queen\", and rolled his eyes and walked away.   Then after the song ended, he came back said \"you song is done, I can put on a playlist, but you still have a loonie in\" Seemingly annoyed at the whole thing. I replied \"Go ahead, you already judged me on my song choice\" he nodded and walked away. I felt like a restaurant should not make a patron feel this way. I told my husband, and he said that when he used the jukebox earlier that evening, the same guy boasted at him from by the bar \"Better be something good!\" If I had known this before my incident I would have been extra upset. This one particular employee should be trained better.  i get that music is subjective, but its a juxebox, there wasnt too many people there, and I did pay for it to have a nice experience, not to be made to feel poorly.   So, the good! The atmosphere is fun! The sort of patio-esque open space (surrounded by glass because its winter) There is a few classic arcade games, including Whack-a-mole, foozeball and Big Buck Hunter Safari. Wayyyy fun! I imagine it can get a little rowdy later in the evening as people get more drunk. Super fun! There was one bartender that was so amazingly nice! He was constantly smiling and just seemed like a bright person.   The food: The food was good! especially for a \"pub\" type place.   The wings were tasty: standard, the sauce is served separately, which I enjoy because you can control the amount of sauce per wing. This does however allow more of the 'grease' that they are fried in to show on the wing. So if you chose to not dunk them, they would be a litttle on the greasy side.   The shimp tacos were tasty! There was 3 shrimp per taco, so there was enough shrimp in each bite. They had this fried tortilla??? strip served on top of the taco that added crunch to the whole thing. WIN.   Pulled Pork Sandwiches: They were not overly sweet, which is a good thing considering sometimes it can be all sweet sauce. There is two in a serving and served on a nice bun.   Mac n Cheese: good! Not the best, but still worth getting. I found it a little too garlicy and the sauce not quite creamy enough. This being said, it was not so creamy that it hurt your arteries going down, So my suggestion would just be to thicken the rue a little! But the flavor mixed very very well!"}
{"text":"Small place, only 1 TV to show the game. Can't believe that after I made a reservation and came in early, the server wanted to stick us in the worst little corner away from the screen.. there was NO ONE ELSE present on that level! The food was okay bit the service subpar. Most likely my last time here"}
{"text":"Pretty dope place if you ask me! 4 stars because of the cover charge on Friday night when there was a band, crappy bar service and for the lack of ventilation downstairs. Other than that, I had fun! They have a SMALL arcade of maybe 4 games in the front but all the fun on the weekends is downstairs when the band is playing. I went on a Friday when a rock cover band was playing. I barely knew any songs lol but the vibes were dope.  I ordered from the ground level bar and my goodness it took forever to get a drink even when there wasn't many people at the bar. There was only one bartender it seems. Then there was the skinny white boy that was just walking around behind the bar joking around with the waitresses and bartender making the drinks take even longer! Like take some orders or get out from behind the bar!"}
{"text":"Service was HORRENDOUS. Food was ok or terrible depending on what you ordered.  Signature cocktail Eglinton West was not worth $12.  I don't usually give bad reviews but this place was especially terrible.   We went there on a Saturday night and there was a big group of us. We had a reservation for 9pm but it took them almost 1/2 hr to get our table ready. Not sure what took that long since the only thing on the table was 3 menus...not like they had cutlery and glasses to set up for 20 ppl.   I orderer the grilled cheese which was decent but the server gave it to me without ketchup or hot sauce or even asking if I needed anything. It then took a few minutes to flag him down to ask for it. Tried my friends Mac 'n Cheese and it was the blandest dish on earth. Honestly it didn't even have salt or pepper. When they asked for that it took him another 10 minutes to get back to our table with it....and that was only after another person who ordered the same dish asked for salt and pepper as well.   He was CLUELESS or probably gave zero F**ks about his job. Even a 16yr old would have been better and more attentive at their job. Constantly late on taking orders and delivering drinks. A lot of the time he just stood around doing nothing not even looking over at our table. I gave him 15% tip because I felt too weird tipping less but honestly he deserved maybe 2% and that too only for having to deal with a big group. Now that I think about it gratuity was probably included because of our large group and the thought of giving him 30% for the worst service makes me even more disappointed in this place. Everyone at the table was disappointed in the service. Some would order 2 drinks at a time since it would take him 20mins to deliver. We are talking a bottle of beer or can of cider here in many cases not even a mixed drink.   I would NOT recommend this place for the drinks or food or service."}
{"text":"The food is SO GROSS! I really don't even give terrible reviews, but everything we ordered was disgusting! When I arrived the menus was completely different than I had seen online and was told they had a new menus which had about 5 tapas on it. I figured at least they would be good, since the selection was so small... NOPE! The man n cheese has a terrible after taste, and the wings were so disgusting I felt the meat was bad or something it had a weird smell to it. When the waitress came out to take the food back, I had half eaten one of the two wings you get in the serving, stating she didn't know when people were done with wings because she's vegetarian.... Then I explained that I was finished because I didn't enjoy the food. And she asked why and I explained why. She still charged us. So gross! Honestly made me want to go vegetarian after his gross the meat was, and the experience itself!"}
{"text":"Great venue, delicious drinks, reasonable prices, and friendly staff! what more could you ask for? oh yeah, Live music too! this place has it all"}
{"text":"Had reservations and a table and wasn't allowed inside. Spoke to security and manager and they were no help. Was told to wait in 10min line which was actually 20mins+  Reservations are not reliable.   And they ran out of white wine before 12 on a saturday"}
