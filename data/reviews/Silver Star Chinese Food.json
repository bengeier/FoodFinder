{"text":"The food is very good, just a place to order take out. Dining in option is not available here. Last two times I ordered from here the cleanliness of the place was questionable, haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Don't expect this place to be a fancy restaurant 'cause it ain't. It's just a take out counter BUT food-wise, pretty much everything is great!! Love their chicken fried rice with egg fu-young and of course, their fried chicken wings. If you're ordering for New Year's eve though, make sure you call early (well before dinner time) because it gets insanely packed there. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because I think it's important to support local businesses. I saw the mixed reviews and said what the hell, let's give it a try anyways.  Much to my chagrin, the negative ads seem to be the truthful ones.  Here's a list of all the things that I didn't like about my meal ( that cost me $75)  1. The food was he there overdone, IE the broccoli or undercooked IE the General Tao chicken.  2. In this day and age they don't have any kind of debit at the door and when I went to the store to pick it up and use my debit card I was charged extra for the privilege.  3. As I was buying dinner for a family of 5, I asked for five sets of chopsticks. The proprietor then try to charge me a dollar set which I respectfully declined.  4. The signature dishes didn't taste anything like I've had before specifically the General Tao chicken dish and the Shanghai noodles. The General Tao chicken was orange and slimy and the Shanghai noodles skinny and tasteless.  As much as I enjoy paying for the privileged of eating tasteless and overcook food I will not be eating at this establishment again.  TL:Dr bad food, bad service, waste of money"}

{"text":"I have been going to Silver Star on and off since 1996 when i moved to the Durham Region.  Whenever i go i always get the same thing.  Dinner for 4.  We get the chicken fried rice, chicken balls and chicken wings along with egg rolls and the chicken chow mein.  Your first impression when you walk into this place won't be great.  It's a dump.  This place is take out only and they haven't done anything to make the inside of the place look better in 20 years.  They use flattened cardboard boxes as entrance mats and the only guy that speaks english at the counter is missing half his teeth (sorry being honest).  I'm sure these things would turn off alot of people.  So your first impression wont be great, but there is a reason this guy has been in business for so long.  The food is good!  My wife and I have tried a lot of different chinese food take out places over the years and we keep coming back to Silver Star.  Their food is pretty good and reasonably priced.  I love their chicken fried rice, its the best i've ever had to be honest.  I have been to far more expensive Chinese restaurants and their rice can't touch Silver Star's.   Their chicken balls are really good also, i find the chicken wings a tad greasy but they taste good.  The egg rolls are egg rolls and the chicken chow mein i also really like.  I am not a daring eater when it comes to new things, so when i find something i like i tend to order the same thing every time i go there.  I'll highly recommend Silver Star for the food, but definitely not the decor!"}
