{"text":"This is a nice addition to the neighbourhood and gives locals a bit more international flare.  It's much more upscale than the diner that was there before.  The food is well-presented and the staff are nice.  Clearly, the owners know their Leaside clientele well; the place was filled with almost all Caucasians.  This is good, sanitized Westernized Chinese food without strong or spicy tastes.  If you're in a mixed relationship, this would be a good place to take your white in-laws to try something a bit more exotic.  The real issue here is that this is NOT Northern Chinese cuisine.  The menu openly promotes dim sum and Szechuan dishes.  There are no wheat-based dishes, no chive pancakes, which are the staple of the north.  The only items that represent the north are Peking duck and the steamed buns.  But still, not a bad place to go if you're in the neighbourhood and not too picky."}
{"text":"Very high quality Chinese food. Beautiful restaurant, I just love it here. Great experience. I had the general tao chicken"}
{"text":"To start the most important part of any restaurant is the food and I can say it is excellent, the food was clean and fresh, the veggies were cooked perfectly though the duck was my favourite. Fantastic flavour and execution.   The second most important part is the service which was topnotch! Everyone was very attentive and super friendly.   I am so pleased this restaurant opened in this neighbourhood because it's really nice to have an upscale Chinese food restaurant with northern Chinese food. It's so delicious, the restaurant is beautifully decorated, and the staff are fantastic. I was very happy with my experience and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I finally tried this place after reading the positive reviews on here. What a mistake. Our food was bland. My soup that was supposed to have vegetables in it contained one piece of green pepper , three rotten pieces of broccoli and a whole lot of flavourless broth. The pad thai was lacking peanuts and, above all, flavour. And the chicken dish tasted like the sauce came from the prepared meal section at Sobey's. Only not nearly as satisfying. I can't for the life of me understand how anyone that has eaten here could possible give it a decent review. We felt ripped off and amazed that just a few weeks ago, we, being as far from Asian as you can possibly get, made a Chinese inspired meal that was more authentic than what we ordered from this place."}
{"text":"Really impressed, our server was extremely attentive.  The Dim Sum was excellent and the Moo Shu Pork was absolutely excellent.  Nice to have a Chinese restaurant in the hood that is more upscale with great food.  This was our first visit but definitely not the last."}
{"text":"A beautiful modern decor can't hide the fact that this is a restaurant for people who don't want to  venture outside of Leaside to go to a Chinatown.  It's *almost* authentic, pricey and has smallish portions in a vain way to elevate and differentiate their cooking from a comparable Chinatown restaurant where you'd definitely get more value.  We had the Peking Duck which tasted great but didn't have the crispy skin essentially to a Peking Duck experience.  We also ordered their house special pork which did not look like the dish pictured in the menu.  The menu featured a photo of a beautifully sliced roast of pork.  What came out looked like a couple scraps from a Chinese BBQ store.  The same with the rest of our dinner - from the soup dumplings to a shrimp dish - all of the \"not quite\" variety.  Parking is very tight, but overall, TAO is a pleasant enough restaurant for special occasions or impressive dinner meals.  Just don't expect to get a real Northern Chinese meal."}
{"text":"They kept the doors open later than usual, which was very considerate.  The selection of food is good and the quality is alright.  It's a very quiet part of the city, but if you happen to be passing by and nowhere else is open it's not the worst spot you could choose."}
{"text":"Unlike those ubiquitous Chinese restaurants with kitschy decor, Tao has some snazzy quality decor. It feels like you're dining in a living room or dining room at home. Disposable table cloths made of paper are still a hit here and I love it!  Don't expect the prices here to be cheap like your usual Chinese joint, but for the higher price point you will be compensated with food that is somewhat like fine dining fare. With that said, you can still wear your sweats.  My friend and I had split several dishes and they were all well-plated, reasonably portioned and delicious. Some of the items were hybrids of various cuisines.  This is something to note because Tao advertises itself as a Northern Chinese restaurant when in actuality many of the dishes are from Southern China as well.  Our favourite dish was the honey pork, which I found to have a Western spin on Chinese pork slices - it's still very fattening, though!  Other than the points mentioned above, what was also atypical was the service. A lovely lady was always checking in on us, and it was very much appreciated. If you are in the East York area with a craving for Chinese food and want to take your date or party to a somewhat fancier Chinese restaurant with higher quality decor, presentation, and service, then swing by here!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the first time. They said to come in 45 minutes and it took an hour and 10 mins before we were given our order.  It seemed a bit expensive compared to other Chinese restaurants so we hoped for the price and wait the food would be amazing. We were disappointed. Hot and Sour soup was too sweet. The Cantonese chow mien came with hard noodles and when mixed with the sauce and veggies/meat was a strange consistency. The garlic ribs have a super sticky thick sauce that my b/f loved but I thought was too much. The spring rolls were average. I will say the pot stickers and pork/chive dumplings were good but not good enough that we'll be ordering again."}
{"text":"I have always found that when you enter a restaurant around dinner time and it is essentially empty, that is a good indicator of the quality of the food. You should immediately turn around and walk out.  Sadly, we did not. Everything we ordered was just plain awful. There is no point in going into a description. Just take my advise and don't go. The service was very good (but then there were almost no other customers)."}
{"text":"Most beautiful Chinese restaurant I've ever been in! The decor is out of this world!! True elegance and a very formal dining experience. The atmosphere is mature, scenic and classy. It's a great dinner location in the Leaside area. It's very hard to miss this location as it has a sleek, black exterior and it is the first thing you see if you're driving in from Eglinton.  One thing that really stood out to me inside the restaurant was this decorated shelf. There's a central turquoise shelf that's filled with various vases to give the restaurant a pop of colour. Also a beautiful flower arrangement close to the bar (weird spot to have that in).  The food is a little pricy for lunch but still well priced if you're here for a dinner. Aside from the price, the food is very fresh tasting but kinda heavy on the seasoning. I had the Cantonese chow mein, presented very nicely and the assorted seafood with garlic. Both two great dishes to try and experience. They also serve dim sum and desserts which I'm sure will be tasty and high quality as well. The food comes very quick as well and the restaurant was about 1/3 full, so that was a plus as well. Service is very kind too!  I will be returning again to try the dim sum soon!"}
{"text":"Open just a month this small neighborhood restaurant seems to know what they are doing. The decor is very nice. The greeting was friendly.  The service attentive. The food came quickly and was presented well. We were only 2 so we could only try a couple dishes but what we had was very tasty. The table next to us ordered Peking Duck and it looked delicious. The prices are more towards the higher end but still within reason. We will return with a larger party so we can try more dishes."}
{"text":"We had lunch there yesterday. Not many full tables in a very handsome resto with a free parking lot. We had dim sum, lettuce wraps, and a drink for $65 incl tip, a bit pricey. But the wrap was excellent and the dim sum hot and fresh. The xiao long bao tasted good but were so uniform I thought they must have been machine made (something our waiter said was not so). The dim sum menu is small, but they are planning to expand it. They also have a very potent hot chili oil which we liked.   In all, a very good place we will re-visit."}
{"text":"Got take-out on a Saturday night. It was ready in a reasonable time - 15 minutes. Menu is on the expensive side. Food was tasty but not enough to justify the prices. We had bok choy, general tao chicken and Cantonese chow mein. Would return just because it's in a convenient area."}
{"text":"The food is on the pricey end in relation to their portion sizes, but the actual taste and quality of the food make up for it! Staff is very courteous and friendly, and the atmosphere is also pleasant. Parking is VERY limited so be mindful of that. Also just a heads up, the ladies washroom stall is an extremely tight squeeze."}
{"text":"Better decor than your average Chinese restaurant but there are still paper table cloth on the table. The menu had quite a good assortment of lobster and duck dishes dim sum and then your regular fare Chinese. We had crispy beef and General Tao chicken and broccoli which was very typical no unique flavors here the broccoli was cooked I think in a fish sauce or oil which I did not like."}
