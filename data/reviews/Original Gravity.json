{"text":"I met some friends at Original Gravity on the second day they were opened. Service was friendly and excellent, and in no way did it feel like they had just opened. It felt like a well-established spot and everything about it was great. We tried a couple of their appetizers, and, among the group of friends, several of their beers both draft and bottled. The food and beer were top notch, and the ambience is cool yet unpretentious. The spot is just the right size - not too small, not too big and I can't wait to try out the patio in back. I also can't wait to go back to try more of their food and drinks. The wine cocktails look especially enticing."}
{"text":"After their soft opening yesterday, we decided that the OG was going to become our favorite new PHX hangout. They have rotating craft beer options on tap, awesome small plates to choose from, and an amazingly friendly staff. I was shocked at how good the chopped salad was! Next time we go, I'm going to try the sliders and the tahini dip because the people next to us were raving about both. So excited to become a regular at this place!"}
{"text":"After getting my hair done at Kami Sori, I came down here for a glass of wine and the staff was AMAZING! My food was delicious. I had the Bees Knees and my boyfriend had the American Burger and both were to die for. Definitely a local favorite!"}
{"text":"I have been anxiously awaiting the opening and am not at all disappointed!!  Awesome draft beer selection and great options for bottle babies :)  LOVE THE Cali Creamin' Nitro!!  I shall try the wine cocktails next time as they sound tasty, but I will leave the actual wine tasting to someone who enjoys it.   For our first food experience we had the IPA Glazed Bacon. OMG it was bacon crack!  So so good. We also had the Pork Belly cheese fries. Love that they had banana peppers on them. DELISH!  The staff is awesome and the decor is perfect. Hopefully next time we can sit at the bar as that's where we like to be.   If you are looking for a great spot for beer, wine, and tasty food THIS IS YOUR PLACE!  Come support local business and chill at OG!   Oh and bring your USB cord and charge your phone right at the bar, USB ports built in GENIUS!"}
{"text":"Love love love this new place!! Love the sangrias!! Love Holly, Michelle and Taush. I don't drink much and usually don't like beer bars put I can spend hours here. Thx guys!!!"}
{"text":"Very very cute place! Loved the atmosphere and food and most of all our server, Kailey! Such an angel. She was very sweet and friendly! What a keeper!"}
{"text":"More lows than highs here.  Nice list of tasty craft beers.  Good menu. Interesting variations on \"bar food\".  But.  Incredibly noisy and hard to hear. Open industrial ceiling may look modern but the echo effect made one-on-one conversation difficult to impossible.  Super slow service. We were there a full two hours from arrival to departure for a single course meal that did not come out together. Had to remind waitstaff of drink order.  Not likely to return."}
{"text":"Tried out a new bar in the hood. Great beer selection and my favorite on Nitro - Cali Creamin'. So good. The place looks awesome with a shaded patio in the front and back. Comfortable seating. The best part was the food. I had the pork sliders. Nice kick -spicy Asian flavors. This will be a nice happy hour hangout."}
{"text":"This is my go-to neighborhood bar.  I know that whatever mood I am in, I'll find something to hit the spot here.  The vibe is relaxed and welcoming.  The owners are friendly and involved.   Beverages - I am a snob about wine and beer.  The options here are always fantastic!  My favorite is the Peanut Butter Stout.  And the wine here is not an afterthought, as it is in many beer joints.  You could Ros√© all day\" if you wanted, but I'm all about the Prosecco! Food - THE FRIES!  To die for!  But I also enjoy the salads and the caprese sandwich.  Oh, and definitely get the pretzels! I'll see you at OG!  I'll be the one at the bar with the bottle of Prosecco and FRIES!"}
{"text":"Good food! Very friendly helpful service. Delicious refreshing cocktails :-) Great atmosphere, kind of hidden, worth the hunt! Turns out it's right on highland and 12th street but I drove past once."}
{"text":"Such a great place. The service is wonderful, the food is amazing, and the drinks are refreshing and tasty!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night after trying to find a new place to eat at, saw the yelp reviews and had to give it a try.  Arrived about 7:30pm on a Saturday and there were only 5-10 other people in there, which initially had me worried for a Saturday night. Took our seats at a booth and were promptly offered menus. The beer and wine selection is great and I really liked the fact that you can get 8oz beers or a pint (some of the special brands have different sizes) for solid prices. My 8oz stout was $3.75! Food menu had quite a few good options. In our party of 4 we tried the \"beef on weck,\" which is a peppercorn prime rib crusted sandwich, \"the bee's knees,\" a friend chicken sandwich in an orange glaze, an \"american burger\" which is simple enough, and \"the Zeus,\" which is more of an Italian sandwich. All came with our choice of sides (sweet potato fries, regular, or a salad) and we tried both types of the fries.   The food came out and it was fantastic! We all tried bites of each other's food and there was not a single item on the table that we did not enjoy. We were all pleasantly surprised. The sweet potato fries are fantastic, really some of the best I have had.  So to recap, beer selection and prices are great, food is delicious, and the atmosphere inside the restaurant is cool. Our bill for two of us came out to a little more than $30. We cannot figure out why it was not packed on a Saturday night!  Could be the location? It is a little off the main path, but the food and drinks are so good I will for sure be back. Also the front patio seemed nice and it is dog friendly!  Will definitely have to try their happy hour specials and can't wait to show some more people this place. Really is a hidden gem in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Nice beer list. Didn't order wine but the list looked interesting. Had the caprese sandwich and house salad. Solid."}
{"text":"I just can't stay away from this place. You wouldn't know they just opened recently... things are totally dialed. They have a great beer and wine selection, amazing food, and top notch service. The vibe is super cool - interesting, unique decor, including a custom beer art wall, and a variety of comfortable seating options. It's easy to hang out and enjoy for many hours."}
{"text":"A quick stop before dinner, the hubby found Original Gravity online as we were in search of good brews. I had recently acquired a love for Cali Creamin and Original Gravity had it on draft Nitro!!!! - so of course we had to stop in and check the place out.  Open only a month, you wouldn't know that as you entered because the place looked great! The industrial vibe with concrete floors and modern fixtures just fits this place. I had to look this up, but the story behind the name is a brewing term; \"the relative density of the wort before it is fermented to produce beer, being chiefly dependent on the quality of fermentable sugars in the solution. It is regarded as a guide to the alcoholic strength of the finished beer.\"  Natasha greeted us and took our beer selections. This chick was so cool to talk to. You can tell that she's doing her research to make sure she provides only the best on tap and was genuinely interested in where my husband and I were from and what beers we liked. Natasha, you were awesome! We almost just stayed there because we were enjoying ourselves so much, but knew that we had dinner reservations elsewhere.  There were others seated around the bar area and we ended up talking to each other just because we all love beer.   They offer small plate options as well as wines and specialty cocktails. This is a must-stop if you're in the area and even if you're not, please put it down on your list and show them some love on your next visit :)"}
{"text":"Found this spot somewhat hidden away in the complex on the corner. A friend of mine lives down the street so we decided to drop by. The tap list was fairly good for a place like this in Arizona. Service was prompt and accurate. The vibe is very chill and relaxed. We only had the pretzels with cheese, but it was great and a nice dish to share. My only complaint is that the local beers on tap were not very good and the flight is $12 for 4 beers.  I still gave it 5 stars because I'm just picky with my beer."}
{"text":"This place is our new local neighborhood spot and it happens to be amazing! Lucky us! We've tried almost everything on the menu and it's all been stellar. They always have a good selection of beer and even wine on tap. The service is great and the owners are hard working and very friendly. The atmosphere is trendy but also unique and inviting. They have two dog-friendly patios, one in the front and one in the back. The back patio has comfy couches too! Definitely stop in for lunch, happy hour, dinner, or a late night drink. Oh or weekend brunch (my fav!). They have it all!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! Lots of beers on tap, wine and good food. Plus the staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"Came in with an open mind and was blown away!! The atmosphere is chill local bar in an industrial set building. I ordered the red sangria, house made, and was not disappointed. My boyfriend chose from the selection of beers on tap. We had sliders and the chopped salad. The OG chopped salad IS THE BEST!!!! I will be back for it this week. No joke people... the food is awesome. Overall great service, atmosphere, and experience at OG-- I'll be happy to make them my neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"I ordered The Bee's Knees sandwich with a side of Mac N Cheese for lunch and it was delicious! It was a little pricey but the food was great, the atmosphere was very relaxed and the owner and chef were friendly! Can't wait to go back and order another delicious entree!"}
{"text":"Not good. The atmosphere is cool, but the service...We came for happy hour. I ordered a glass of wine which was a dollar off. The pour I would guess was 3.5-4 ounces. When the bartender asked if I wanted another one I politely mentioned I thought the first pour was a little light. She then went on to lecture me that a standard pour is 5 ounces, and that if she poured more than that she would have inventory problems. I did not order a second glass.The $15 charcuterie plate had a couple small pieces of cheese and a few slices of salami. It tasted delicious but not worth $15. I'm assuming they will blame this on being a tapas/small plate bar lol. The bartender was condescending the rest of our time there. Plenty of better places for happy hour."}
{"text":"Ordered wine by the glass. Not only was it way too warm, but it tasted like it had seen better days. Bartender was very nice and willing to offered a different option but not so open to the fact that a wine and beer bar should be able to have at least one wine fridge for the reds. Opted for wine on tap -- only option in red I could tell was kept in wine fridge. Now the food was not even worth complaining about.  Ordered \"Beef on Weck\" and it was a wreck!  Au jus room temperature at best; same for meat which was bland; the bun while toasted was absolutely refrigerator cold. My best guess is that it was toasted the day before. The Griddled Caprese was taken over by the pasty house pesto. It was warm but mostly thick pesto with little mozzarella. The side house salad was very good. While not busy, customers were not the priority. First time here. Most likely last. Very disappointed. Not sure we're their reviews come from. Just can't be real."}
{"text":"We love new places to dine & drink in our neighborhood. This place is a quaint cool spot anytime of the day. The service, on the other hand is horrible.  During my visit, there was a dark hair female bartender who did not acknowledge Bar guest. It is always standard to say hello & if you are busy, a quick, I will be with you shortly. We got CRICKETS and the owner was sitting there the entire. It's a tiny bar so your customer are up close and personal.  The bartender was slow, looked miserable and very unhappy.  She pulls down the entire establishment.  Good luck with her. We left and will never go back & we tell friends... you only get 1 first impression. Sincerely, Crickets"}
{"text":"I came at about 2:30 for a late lunch (note that it opens at 2pm). The place had limited parking as it was part of what appeared to be an office based strip mall. The restaurant/bar itself was darling and very visualizing appealing. There was hardly anyone there. My food was good and opted out of a drink this time. It seems like this place would be better as a late night hangout for a drink rather than a late lunch like we did LOL. Will return later again but this time at night (possibly with my dog as it is dog friendly) for a few drinks.  Pros: Beautiful place, good service  Cons: May be a bit too empty for some people's liking, location"}
{"text":"Im new to the area to I went to this place to eat tonight, no one welcomed me I had to ask for a menu and a seat. I was never asked if I wanted anything to drink nor was I asked anything so I left. I would not recommend this place if you want any good service."}
{"text":"A really fun little bar. Stopped in for a bit a few drink a couple of weekends ago. Found the food to be extremely solid and the beer selection to be excellent.   Staff was also extremely helpful and attentive.   Can't wait for the weather to cool down as they have a nice outdoor area in the back."}
{"text":"Great little place for yummy food and cocktails.   Try the Chicken Sandwich.  It's amazing!!"}
{"text":"Really chill place. Nice decor and friendly staff. Pretty good selection of beer and wine, will be back to try the food."}
{"text":"We loved Original Gravity!  The drinks and food were awesome... it's got a fun, laid back environment and the people were friendly and took great care of us. Try the sliders and the OG Radler.  Love!!!"}
{"text":"What a great bar/restaurant! Went in on Saturday afternoon and sat at the bar for a couple of drinks and lunch. Ordered the chopped salad, IPA bacon and carnitas tacos. Wow! The tortillas they used are thin and cooked perfectly, bacon was sweet and the salad was huge! Natasha, one of the owners, was also our bartender and was such a delight. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and love this place!  Great decor and ambiance.  The food is good, although slightly limited, and the drink selection is fantastic."}
{"text":"Just had grilled cheese and tomato on steroids!!! Really tasty food and great atmosphere. The restaurant is set back and not easy to see as you drive up but just park at the center and you will find it on the west end. Great bar seating and tv, friendly service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"$35 after tip for two people and some damn fine tacos and sliders. Share if you want, but one plate was enough for a cheap single filling meal."}
{"text":"The staff there were really nice and the beer selection was great. The place is still obviously trying to get it's footing as far as the menu goes. Not a huge selection on the food menu, mostly apps, a couple grilled cheese, and a few salads to choose from. But if you're looking for a place to relax and have a few drinks, this place is definitely a great place to stop by."}
{"text":"This is one of those hidden urban gems.  The decor is fun.  The layout is also great.  There is a patio, YES! The bar is centered and tables surround it.  There is a good flow.  My crab meat sandwich was tasty.  Perhaps the bun overwhelmed it but I hardly noticed because I cleaned my plate. Thumbs up on the sweet potato fries.  Dessert was sublime.  Key lime pie was a little pie that was so yummy. It had a perfect balance of graham cracker crust and key lime filling. I also have to say that the montepulciano was a delicious red at a good price point.  I am going back for the beef on weck."}
{"text":"Original Gravity is amazing! They have a fantastic beer list and their sandwiches are made with Noble bread. It never disappoints."}
{"text":"So excited this place is finally open! I went in for the first time yesterday and the service exceeded my expectations. The staff was friendly, welcoming, and made sure I had a drink in my hand the whole time. The whole vibe in general was great, we ended up chatting with other patrons in the bar along with the staff. Its going to be a great little hang out spot that I would feel comfortable going to even by myself.   As far as food I tried the pretzel that came out with a couple dipping sauces, I highly recommend it! I also had the grilled caprese sandwich, annnd cleaned my plate with that as well. Prices were very reasonable as well. They have a generally small menu but everything on there looks amazing. I typically get the same things when I go places but I will probably need to try everything here at least once.   Go check this place out. Its modern industrial look is the perfect new addition to Central Phoenix. The whole renovated building and its artwork all a real sight to see."}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks. The brunch menu is so tasty. Atmosphere is great and of course watching football on a Sunday morning is fantastic.  I recommend this place and will continue to be a regular here."}
{"text":"This place has some cool and modern decor. The service is friendly and the atmosphere is laid back. It's a great place to enjoy a glass of wine or beer with some good bites. The menu is short and simple, but I loved the apps that we ordered. The pretzels weren't the best I've ever had, but I would definitely order again to eat that jalape√±o beer cheese or queso sauce. The tacos were amazing! The tortillas had a light crisp and weren't heavy tasting. The meat was juicy and flavorful served with some medium green salsa, perfect amount of spice and citrus. I had a great time here with a friend and was able to sit back and relax for a couple hours with good vibes."}
{"text":"Met my friend for lunch on a Friday and was very pleased.  The hummus is garlicky, served with fresh pita triangles.  We also had the Guinney Dogs which are Guinness sausages, wrapped with a little pastry, served with spicy grainy mustard and caramelized onions.  Rounded out the meal with blistered shishito peppers.  Just delicious!  My friend ordered a blueberry mead which is brewed in Flagstaff.  Delicious, like dessert in a glass.  I ordered a white sangria followed by the House Pinot Grigio.  Both delicious.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant no I will be going back."}
{"text":"Such fun drinks! I had the mule which was amazing. We also got sangria, the cheese platter, chopped salad, and sliders. The sliders were the best!  Atmosphere is cool. Place is clean."}
{"text":"Very tasty! Good drink special, and the fries and sauces are delicious. Looking forward to exploring more of the menu in the future."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The beer and wine selection has a lot of good stuff to choose from. The ambience is cool; great spot for any occasion whether it's lunch, happy hour or date night. The staff is prompt and personable and make great recommendations. The food is absolutely awesome and the prices are very good. The chicken sandwich is the best that I've ever had. I will have dreams about it. We will definitely come back and make this a routine visit. OG is a Hidden gem in this part of town. Go try it!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area, so when my girlfriends came over to see my place, we decided to give the bar a try. Two of us had a salad. Large and quality ingredients. We both enjoyed. Other friend ordered pork belly fries. She enjoyed but had expected more pork, it was mostly fries. I was on a 30 day detox, so sadly no wine for me. I plan on going back again soon and getting a glass of wine. The server was awesome, friendly and helpful. Great personality. Definitely give this place a try. Oh, the server said they have Trivia on tuesdays, that sounds like fun. Might give that a try."}
{"text":"Impressed!  Wanted to try a new place with the little lady so we came to Original Gravity. We really enjoyed our experience. I had the steak and frites...great stuff. Nice atmosphere and reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place a 2 star review, but I feel like I have to.    I really like the location, the wait staff was friendly,and the food was tasty.  But...  the night that we went, the kitchen was having problems.  We went on a Friday night.  The bar was fairly full, but several tables were open.   We had a party of 4 and we ordered the flatiron steak (medium rare), a beef on weck, and 2 pesto caprese sandwiches.  The steak actually came out first.  It was thinly sliced crosswise so that it was immediately visible that this medium rare steak was instead totally cooked through.  We returned that and them make another.  Second up was the beef on weck.  This was a tasty sandwich and the fries were awesome.  About 10 minutes later, the second steak arrived - this time medium rare as ordered.  I was really hungry so I got the go ahead from my party to begin eating my beef on weck before the rest of the food arrived (I shared my fries with them).  I finished my sandwich and my plate was taken, but still no capresi.  About 10 minutes later, the sandwiches finally arrived.  However, both were overloaded with pesto.  Both people had to scrape some of the pesto off of one side of the sandwich.  Neither of the sandwiches was finished - partly due to too much pesto and partly due to too many fries leading up the sandwich delivery.    Overall, we were there for over 2 hours.  The server did discount 50% of each sandwich, but our dinner pretty much sucked.  We wound up having to keep finding the server to deal with issues and generally felt bad for the people with us who were not getting served. We will go back because of the great beer selection, the fact that they are less than 10 minutes from home and the quality of the ingredients.  I hope they get it right next time."}
{"text":"Impressive beer list featuring a lot of local and national craft brews including one of my faves Mother Earth Cali' Creamin' on nitro. They offer flights for $10 which was perfect since it's hard to decide on just one when the beer is so awesome. They have a small tapas menu, we tried out the grilled caprese sandwich and half/half fries. The sandwich was tasty and the fries had a nice spicy dipping sauce. We sat at the bar and the bartender/owner was very helpful with my beer choices and provided great service. I will for sure return and suggest you do too."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is perfect. Music is at just the right level where you can hold a conversation without yelling at the other person. The drinks and food are uniquely delicious and really show the owners' creativity and passion. We had the american and Korean sliders, both of which were cooked perfect and filled with flavor. I would highly recommend OG to anybody who is looking to experience a new restaurant where you will leave satisfied and eager to come back again."}
{"text":"Went in for the third time and had a great time. This time around we ordered food. I had the american sliders which were good but nothing special. It was a little pricey for $9. Ordered the OG french fries as well; the sauce that accompanied it was delicious. I ended up putting it on my sliders. My friend had the asian sliders which was just okay. It was a little bland and tasted like something was missing.  I was still hungry after the american sliders so I ordered the beef brisket sliders which were on happy hour for $9. This was probably the best thing that I've had here. The brisket was fatty, tasty and had the perfect amount of barbecue sauce. My boyfriend ordered the BLT which was good but very simple - we could've made the exact same sandwich at home. Chopped salad was good.  Over all, we'd definitely be back for the drinks, the ambience and the spectacular service. I love that the owners are very hands on and passionate about their business. Our servers have always been top notch."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have ordered from there many times and the food is so good. I am in love with the mushroom po-boy. It's incredible, my only complaint is the bread its served on (a baguette). Its toasted which makes it bit hard to bite through and its narrow, so all the yummy goodness filling falls out. In fact it falls apart when you pick it up so I end of eating it with fork. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I requested a bun the last 2 times I ordered it and they still put it on baguette. Please re-consider the bread choice for this sandwich! It's amazing other than that."}
{"text":"Last nite I join a friend for a last minute drink ...  the place was slow but the Atmosphere was amazing Holly was our bartender and she was very fun and attended I am definitely loving the concept this restaurant has an I'll be coming back"}
{"text":"Well hello there, aren't you the most charming cutest bar ever!  I checked out this little gem after work one day and I must say, I was shocked how much I loved it at Original Gravity! One of the owners, short hair girl, was bartending. I cannot recall her name but LOVED her. My boyfriend and I came for just a drink, but after chatting it up with some regulars I had to stay and try their food.   Can we please talk about this building???  STUNNING!! There is a cute little coffee shop, art gallery coming soon and a salon upstairs. Wait? So I can stay here forever? What else do you need? Some wine, a little espresso and an amazing haircut. Shoes? Thats the only thing missing is a great shoe store, and possibly a Target. Ok, I couldn't stay forever. But a full day for sure.  I adored our bartender/owner. I think her name was Natalie? I can't believe I do not recall her name. Sorry girl! Don't take it personal, I still love you!  The food was amazing. We shared the 'bees knees' and just about melted in our seats. I can not wait to go back and try some more of their menu. Finally a little local spot who got it right. Take note people. Seriously. Get a note pad and write it down. Less is more.   Only bummer was we couldn't find a bike rack. Seems to be on serious shortage in this town. Luckily they had plenty of trees and fixtures to secure our bikes. AND they have a dog friendly patio. I cannot wait to bring Prada and Dior for a little vino and relaxation!"}
{"text":"What a find! Came in for a late lunch on a Sunday. Was immediately greeted by the owner. Tried the Bees Knees crispy chicken sandwich with a mix of regular/sweet potato fries. Let's just say it was the BEST crispy chicken sandwich I have ever had! Saw a few other menu items go by like the burger and the harvest salad. Both looked great as well. Cute little place with great food, a full bar, a patio and a couple of big screen TVs for the sports enthusiasts!"}
{"text":"Love the location staff is very helpful friendly! great choices of wine & champagne I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not good. We went on a slow night so I am not sure if we would have had a better experience on a busier night. The wine had been sitting out and was warm and tasted old. My husband decided to try a wine on tap instead since it was chilled a little bit. The food we ordered was edible, but not good. The caprese sandwich was not tasty. The pesto was pasty and the sandwich was drowning in it. The Beef on Weck was even worse. The buns were burnt and served cold. The Au Jus for dipping was room temperature. The house salad was the best thing we ate that night. I am really disappointed. We came here because of the high reviews. Either we came on a bad night or the reviews are completely fake. There are too many places with way better food. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I really like this place! Cool date spot for wine, beer, or a happy hour snack! This is on 12th St. and Highland, with plenty of space in the patio to enjoy this gorgeous weather! You must try the poutine or a luscious grilled cheese with a light salad. OR go for bar bites like hummus and pretzels! If you're in the area, take a friend and go check it out! Very nice selection of wine and beer!"}
{"text":"Such a great place!  Food is good and the beer/mead/wine list is even better!!! It's got a great atmosphere and quite enough to be enjoyable even when there's live music.  Great place for dogs and family friendly."}
{"text":"What a great new beer and wine bar!  We stopped in for happy hour on Friday and really enjoyed it - laid back vibe, super friendly service, and an extensive list of beer and wine selections.  I thoroughly enjoyed my Portuguese white wine on tap...thanks for the great recommendation!  Next time we'll bring our dog to enjoy the dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"Awesome wish it was close to home! Good choice of beers didn't try food. Like the beer wall"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time tonight, and I was very impressed! They have a great beer list -- as someone who is not in love with IPAs, it was nice to finally have a beer list that wasn't dominated by them :) they had a couple of my favorite blondes and wheat beers that I hardly see on draft, the Green Flash Blonde and Hangar 24 Orange Wheat. So good!  We ordered food too, and it was amazing! My friend got three different kinds of sliders, and they all looked really good. My sister and I both got the grilled caprese sandwich, and it was amazing! I honestly don't even like pesto that much, but it was great on this sandwich. The bread they use is especially delicious.   The only negative was that prices were maybe a little high considering sides are extra, and the beer was priced a bit high, too. It wouldn't change me going back though because the food and service was great! :) I loved the atmosphere as well, it's a really cute place."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Looking forward to next visit!  Great decor/ambiance was welcoming/great vibe/food innovative and yumm!   Sweet potato fries were crispy (not soggy limp or sad!) special sauce a hit... pretzel and smokey cheese was happily noshed... and then the drunk bacon.. oh ya!  Special was a carnitas taco... while table devoured ;)) Sangria and wine & \"og martinis\" were Delish as well Came here w friends, was not disappointed!  Haley took great care of us...w great upbeat positive energy ;) Definitely will be coming back to try more"}
{"text":"Beer and wine only with cocktails (although made of only beer/wine). Selection is quite impressive and the all-craft rotating tap has quite a few beers that I wasn't familiar with. Prices are reasonable as well, between $5-8, for beers depending on type for a pint.  Food was excellent. We had the beef on weck, a prime rib roast sandwich that was cooked to perfection and served with a side of au jous. We also had steak frites that was cooked to a perfect medium-rare. Fries on the side were really good and served with a special sauce.  Service was excellent. Was offered a refund on a beer labeled a stout that actually turned out to be a coconut stout since I hate anything coconut. Didn't take it since my wife loves coconut and she just had a second drink instead.  Overall this is a great place, it will only become more and more popular as time goes on.  Quirks: I noticed the happy hour price was the same as the menu price for one item. Music selection was all 80s on a Wednesday."}
{"text":"Beer was great, food wasn't.  Sounds yummy, but no execution with ensuring it actually tastes good.  I would have loved to taste what was proposed on the menu; however no delivery there.  Unfortunate."}
{"text":"Great little place with fresh local ingredients!!! Locally owned and managed! Great service"}
{"text":"Was excited to check this place out, which may have helped set expectations too high. It's a cute little tucked-away spot if you're looking for low key. Definitely still has that brand new kind of feel to the whole establishment- ambiance, wait staff, and drinks. However, I will say I had the Mohua Sauvignon Blanc and it was very, very good.  Overall, I probably won't be making a return visit unless I'm looking to get some work done in an unexciting environment. If it improves with a little more time this place would have potential."}
{"text":"Most amazing bar ever!   Michelle was the best and suggested the most amazing beer I have ever had!  The bar is full of unique features including the beer tile wall, Moscow Mule cups with straws, etc.  Don't miss out on this gem!"}
{"text":"Interesting food and ambience. Awkward service. Great beer and wine menu. OG sauce is amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great craft beer and wine selection on tap and bottled. Really good food choices as well!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this local gem and their amazing wine, beer, staff and food! The Mac and cheese is beyond words. The beer and wine selection is enough to shame total wine. Did I mention the Mac and cheese? If you haven't, you must."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant! Incredible customer service, food, ambience and BEER! I took my Mom and 18 month old daughter (no this is not a kid place) and we were treated so kind and they accommodated all of our needs. Comfortable atmosphere and amazing music! The Bees Knees chicken sandwich was incredible. I definitely recommend riding your bike over for a cold one at Original Gravity."}
{"text":"Yeah! A great little place tucked out of the way near the 7th St corridor. Would definitely go back again. Great little menu with awesome food. Very cozy and friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour spot! I met a friend at 4pm on a Wednesday and when I got there, I was the only one! It's so nice to go grab drinks somewhere in this area where you don't have to wait a huge amount of time for a table!   The service was definitely great. We got great drink recommendations and even a cool flaming orange peel in my sake-tini. Make sure to ask about drink specials since there seem to be different specials depending on the day. Our servers realized that we wanted to chat and just hang out and definitely made sure our drinks were full, but they let us be with few interruptions. Who could ask for more!?  It is a really cute place with lots of cool art on the walls. I have to say that they have some of the most interesting cups and glasses for drinks that I have seen! Bravo for creativity!   We ordered pretzels and carnitas tacos. Our food was delicious, and it seems that the tortillas were handmade.   I can't wait to go back again, this is a great spot for girls night or happy hour."}
{"text":"I am the organizer for the Downtown Phoenix Meetup. We frequent venues in central Phoenix. Original Gravity hosted one of our events where 33 people attended. All I can say is that everyone raved about the place, both the atmosphere, food and drink. No complaints, only positive feedback, from some finicky people. The place has a very cool, chic vibe. Yes the food is very good and I was most impressed with how quickly they were able to serve our large group. The staff is very responsive and helpful. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Came in last night with a buddy to grab a couple of craft brews. It's a pretty small restaurant, and the bar takes up the majority of it. They have 2 big TV's for sports right at the bar. They had about 15 beers on tap and they were pretty impressive. I tried the Saison and a local IPA. Both very good. My buddy and I ended up splitting the chicken sandwich and this sandwich was delicious. Very crispy chicken, and it comes with a hot honey on it which totally makes the sandwich. The bun was nice and soft and the fries were crispy and on point. The sauce that they serve the fries with was incredible. I would recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Cool little taphouse with a great eclectic vibe. Hummus is good! Decent selection of beers."}
{"text":"Tried out this new little spot last night, and it was amazing! The space is very bright and open, with choices to sit a large or small tables, at the bar, or out at the patio. It was too hot for that last night but I'm looking forward to using it in the fall!   They had a really impressive wine and beer menu, with tons of different choices. There was a good mix of IPAs, other pale ales and lighter beers. I tried the Caprese sandwich because of good reviews on Yelp, and I wasn't disappointed! The bread was delicious and the pesto and mozzarella had really good flavor. I also tried my friend's Hawaiian slider with Spam, which was super tasty as well - I want to go back for the sliders!   My only negative thought was the price - most sandwiches/meals are $9-12 and then another $4 or so for the sides. I'll definitely come back regardless, though!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - 311 - Come Original)  You got to You got to You got to Yelp Original, you got to Yelp Original Hawaiian Sliders at Original You got to Yelp Original, you got to Yelp Original Korean Sliders, hear why!   Original Gravity is a cute little neighborhood bar joint located in the heart of the Phoenix valley.  I rather enjoy the art around the bar and the color scheme worked; grey and orange, I dig it!  I came with a friend and sat at the bar.  The menu seemed pretty interesting as I wanted to order a plethora of food.  We started with the Chop Salad; which I thought was pretty tame and basic.  The chicken was in chunks of cube in different sizes and was quite dry.  The dressing was very light and I was barely able to taste it.    We proceeded with getting the sliders; we ordered the Hawaiian, Korean, and Italian.  These were definitely the stars of the evening!  Love the spam and pineapple combo on the Hawaiian slider; the salty spam and sweetness of the pineapple played well for my palates.  My second in line was the Korean slider which came with kimchi and bacon.  Yeah bacon and kimchi works wonderfully and who'd ever thought!  My least favorite was the Italian since I thought the meatball was pretty dry.    We ended with the Pork Belly Cheesy Fries.  This didn't work for me either since the pork belly was in diced chunks, but was sparingly sprinkled on the fries.  The cheese was cheesy for sure, but I would want my fries a tad bit more crispy.    In the end, OG is still pretty new and the service was spot on.  They have a lot of things happening and a nice patio coming along.  Needless to say, OG was fun and the food was a hit and miss for me. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"OG is the go-to place for good beers, tasty wine cocktails, saki, and great vibes. There are two patios--front and back. Great music, nice people. It's not unusual to converse with people at the bar. The food is good. My favorites are the following: roasted garlic hummus, IPA glazed bacon, harvest salad, and OG steak frites. There are a lot of other items on the menu. There are 20 rotating taps for craft beer and about 20 bottles and cans. If beer is your thing, try them out."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour. Good selection of beers. Great service. Food is okay. My friend ordered Korean sliders , the bacon was burnt. When he finished eating them he told the server and he was offered a beer. Hoping they would open for brunch."}
{"text":"Went there this evening cause a group I'm in was meeting here.    It is a really new place, having just opened within the last couple of weeks.   It was hard to find.   In fact, I walked around the building twice trying to find it, having first drove into the parking lot of the \"gentlemen's club\"  next door.   Maybe it's just me.   When I found it, I did see a sign.  I sat at the bar.   Michelle, one of the owners, waited on me.   She is very friendly, and introduced me to the other two owners, who were also working.     I ordered a cab -- no, not a car!  -- and it was a good choice.    I was going to order food, but got to talking to the gentleman I was sitting next to and didn't have a chance.   He ordered something with fries.   He said it was good.   I should have taken a photo of the menus.     I did see they have sweet potato fries, which I LOVE if they're done correctly.   The prices are really reasonable.  The place has plenty of seating space, tables, bar area, etc.   Very open and light.   I don't think they have a full bar, just wine and beer, which is enough.   I could be mistaken, though.  I would definitely return and check out their food."}
{"text":"Cool decor, really nice staff and a decent location in Phoenix.  We just had drinks so I can't rate on food. Really good beer menu with wine and some wine cocktails. We had a few different types of wine cocktails because we wanted something icy in the heat. Conceptually nice but they all tasted super sweet. The sangria is made with some sprite (or ginger ale maybe?). I'm not into super sweet drinks and there are a lot nicer beer bars so I don't really know when I'd feel the desire to come back. Needs more of a unique identity to the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place and the women who own it. The perfect place for wine and awesome beers and comraderi. Okay to come by yourself or with friends. Lets give support to our local businesses"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after the D-backs game. Love the ambiance. We had the IPA bacon which was a very nice start. Also ordered the 3 sliders.. Korean and BBQ brisket. Both are excellent. I do wish they had more bottle of wines, either way I will be back!"}
{"text":"Original Gravity was an awful experience. There was only one server and a bartender to service the restaurant and there were at least 15-20 customers so service was slowwwww. I ordered the Guinney Pigs appetizer and steak frites. The appetizer took forever to get to our table (20-30 minutes) and had only 4 small sausages. They weren't good and not warm.  We waited another 20-30 minutes to get the steak. We wanted to share but it definitely was not enough for two. Maybe one. It had maybe 6 or 7 slices of steak. The steak was actually pretty good but at that point, we have been there for more than an hour and hungry so seeing that the plate wouldn't even make me full, we were disappointed. We left spending close to $40 that included drinks but my sangria was no good either.  We actually left starving so we went to a fast food joint to fill up our tummies."}
{"text":"I really want to give 5 stars and hoping i can in the future but hear me out.  Please please please consider serving filtered drinking water. The water tasted really really bad which we needed while we ate after many glasses of wine.  The food was great! I love the wine! And since I live across the street id love to come every week :) everything else is great and everyones real nice."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks and friendly waiters.   Our waiter was very personable and friendly.  He brought the experience up to a 5 Star review for sure.   The food here is good.  They also have a nice selection of drinks.   I saw somewhere online they do trivia but I asked our waiter and he said they stopped. Maybe they'll start again because this seems like it'd be a good spot for trivia."}
{"text":"cool little place with a great vibe. parking isn't great but we can walk there so it wasn't an issue. lots of craft beer and good selection of food. check it out!"}
{"text":"It was ok. We stopped by on a weekend afternoon after we saw a piece on them on the local news. It's nearby and its always good to see new places pop up in the neighborhood. The space is nice, the wine cocktails were creative and beer selection was great. If my review ended there, they would be at 5 stars. Here's where I feel they can improve:  1. The food - reminded me of stuff you can get at the ball park. Don't get me wrong, I'm all about fries, sliders and a jar of bacon but for the prices, I feel like they should step up their game. If I do go back, it will be either before or after dinner.  2. It was good to see that they have a lot of support from friends and family but nobody likes the feeling of being an outsider. The staff was nice but I felt like I was crashing someone's party. For it being a brand new place they should make a bigger effort to engage with their customers sitting up at the bar."}
{"text":"Super cute! It has a stainless steal look/appearance to it. Small location, tucked away in a mini business strip. Parking can be a challenge as it is in a small plaza, although I have not encountered not being able to find a parking spot. It has a neighborhood feel to it, with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Great service!   The mushroom po'boy is to die for and so is the key lime pie!"}
{"text":"Yes!!!! Awesome food, beer and artwork! Great staff. Keep up the great work! See you all soon."}
{"text":"I've been getting my hair done at the salon above Original Gravity for almost two years, so I was excited to try them out when they opened. Today I had my second visit to Original Gravity \"OG\" for brunch before my hair appointment. And WOW. Their brunch menu is small but offer such unique items it's hard to choose. I sipped on my tart cherry mimosa while I pondered which item I wanted. After much debate I went for the breakfast tacos. The eggs were cooked perfect and the house-made sausage was devilishly delicious. I enjoyed the vibe and the staff so much I was late to my hair appointment. (Oops!)!  After chatting with Michelle my bartender I felt like a regular already. Because I'm a naturally a nosy person, of course I had to ask who owned my new favorite place. I was excited to hear it was female owned and the actual owners work here full time. How many places can you say the owners actual do the daily grind?? Conclusion: I found my new favorite spot!!"}
{"text":"I honestly did not know food this good existed. I got the harvest salad and it was fantastic!!! The fried goat cheese took it up a notch and when I ate it for leftovers the next day it was just as good! My boyfriend got the \"bees knees\" sandwich as our waiter recommended it and he said it is truly the best fried chicken he's ever had. Beer selection is out of this world and the service is awesome! Our waiter was friendly, personable and honestly quite entertaining. I recommend this place to everyone and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. The bar is sleak and clean, the staff is friendly, the draft beer selection is glorious, their craft cocktails are delicious, and hell they even have good food. Awesome spot, not the cheapest, but you definitely pay for the atmosphere, the taste, and the generosity. Highly recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday and was delighted as fuck. The beer selection was vast and delicious. I ordered the Caprese sandwich and loved every bite. The wait staff was knowledgeable and personable. I will definitely be recommending this restaurant to the people I know."}
{"text":"This place is one of the awesome little local places everyone should visit. Have been twice and super friendly and personable bartender was awesome!! She knows food, beer, pairings...she's great! Service was awesome and there were about a dozen people there at the time I went each day.  Ordered the burger with side salad...comes with a non fried green tomato! How cool is that? Beer was very good and the recommended flight was super tasty.  Decor is provocative and genuine as well as the people, food and beer.  I'm going to keep going back at each opportunity and try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"What a great place for a variety of different beers! The staff here is so amazing and very friendly. Today's food special was $6 Mac n cheese and $5 prosecco.  Came in with a with a group of 10 and they were very accommodating. Great atmosphere and location, would highly recommend people checking it out."}
{"text":"Overall I really liked Original Gravity! The atmosphere is chill and modern but not at all pretentious. The service was great. Eric was great, attentive, seems to care about his job and role as a server and just genuinely seemed like a super cool guy.   We had the chartruterie board, grill cheese sandwich and mixed fries...and all were amazing. My only disappointment was there was not any soup on available.  I'll be back and look forward to my next visit"}
{"text":"Great new local find. Stopped by on our search to find a new spot with craft beers and a simple food menu. Highly recommend this local hang out for great craft brews and tapped wine. They also serve gluten free beer."}
{"text":"This is a definite visit for beer and wine lovers!!  It's difficult to find great beer and wine selections that BOTH wine and beer lovers like and this place has it!!  It has a very cool vibe and has a front patio and back patio when the weather is nice enough to sit outside!  The menu is delicious and the staff is very attentive and friendly!  Three ladies started this amazing place and you should give it a try as you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this neighborhood place.  Great food and Beer selection and according to my Wifey they have the BEST Sangria ever!!!  Thank you OG."}
{"text":"Still love OG! There have been fun changes to the menu. Beer selection still awesome and the food will make your mouth water. Wanna get your south on with a chicken sandwich: Bees Knees has you covered! East coast? Prime rib between buns: Beef on a Weck will please.   All in all great owners that really want to please their customers. Drop in, have a smile, eat and drink. Repeat."}
{"text":"We really loved our time here! Great specials on happy hour and the management is very friendly. All of the food we had was amazing! The atmosphere is also very upbeat and welcoming. There is a lot of attention to detail, including wall sockets at the bar to charge your phone. Great patio space that is available to rent for gatherings."}
{"text":"Dog friendly patio!. The parking can be a bit tricky but once you get inside  the modern industrial look and square bar are sure to impress. The art is all pictures of burning man characters and was really fun to look at.   They had a great selection of wines and beers but not the best happy hour deals around so expect to spend a little more. I didn't eat so I will have to come back and write an update soon. This is a fabulous new addition to CenPho!"}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks (try the Sake Bloody Mary!) and wonderful staff! The steak and fries are the most tender and taste like a $60 steak. Also has beautiful burning man art on the wall. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday for the first time! So happy this place is in my Hood!!  Was met with a warm welcome through the door!!  Natasha was so nice in helping me choose my 4 beers for my tasting board!  So many to choose!  They were all excellent ! Menu of beer are amazing! Menu of wines by the glass amazing!  I didn't eat this visit.... but saw many a good item come out for customers.... they all looks delicious! The decor is very Urban! So very cool! A wall of beer labels too!  A must visit!!"}
{"text":"Freaking awesome place. I had a steak frites and 2 beers and pigs in a blanket. Everything was dope. They seem like they need more staff members so then in your applications now! But the girl in the was super Killin it, treated respectfully and was attentive to my needs even though she was like running the restaurant single handedly. Go here! Eat here! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Awesome take on a French dip. The crunchy shallots brought a unique twist and the Noble bread was on point."}
{"text":"Ugh- this is why Yelp makes me crazy!! 5 Stars??Anyone can write reviews and you end up spending $100 on bar food with thousands of calories and still leave hungry!! I will say our service was amazing.  (There was only one other table in there with us) The owner was warm and kind but the description says nothing about the menu just being bar food!! And DO NOT go there for wine!!! Only 3 glasses of red on the list- this is strictly a beer joint. Everyone raving about the sliders - really?? There was something so incredibly spicy on it I couldn't finish it! Oh, and the art?  If you like looking at half naked women while eating then you'll love it.  Sadly we will not be back."}
{"text":"What a cute little place!  Great selection of beer.  We went here on Saturday date night.  The staff was great, she let me try a couple beers before ordering.  We didn't order any food, but it looked delicious and we will next time.  Would definitely recommend and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Such a great gem here in the Central Phoenix area. Locally owned and operated. The owners are lovey and their food and drink menu is excellent! 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came on a Sunday night and were not disappointed at all. The selection of beer was great! Too many to choose from. The wait staff was awesome as well, very knowledgeable about the selection. The food was bomb. I ordered THE BEE'S KNEES chicken sandwich and that bad boy was so packed with flavor. We will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem!!!! Dog friendly patio, amazing food, and beer flights! Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. We had the pork belly, steak frites, and another tapa. Everything was fabulous. Definitely our new place to take visitors from out of town!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, Great beer and OH MY GOD those Korean Sliders are an orgasm in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, highly recommend swinging by and grabbing a drink! Food is delicious also, had the key lime pie and it was amazing. Very cool concept with great service! Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I have been to Original Gravity twice, most recently on Mother's Day. I must say this place is a great addition to the neighborhood and the renovation to this once outdated stucco strip mall is nothing short of amazing. The building is modern and eclectic with some very creative design features. The atmosphere is both fun and laid-back. It is very comfortable inside and out and exceptionally decorated. The music is a good mix /wide variety of favorite. Inside the bar/amidst conversation you'll hear a bartender pop a bottle of champagne or prosecco and the place erupts in cheer and clapping for a few seconds... Totally fun! The patios are amazing. The front patio is completely shaded and a nice and quiet place to have conversation and/or a romantic date. The back patio is comfortable with nice cushioned seating and there is low music piping through both patios.   Food-wise, I have had the grilled lemon and roasted garlic tahini dip, the OG fries, the house salad with Noble Bread croutons, and the caprese sandwich with buffalo mozzarella on Noble bread, and also the grilled cheese on focaccia and gazpacho tomato soup (Mother's Day special). As far as drinks,  I tried the fire and ice wine cocktail which comes with a scoop of lemon sorbet and luxardo cherries; very tasty! I've tried their wine and the drafts beers and it was all great. They have around 20 beers on tap and I was able to try Cali Cream Ale on nitro for the first time! Everything is amazing ---this place is going to be a huge success. About the only thing I can suggest for this place is a few more bike racks as currently there is only a bike rack built for 2 bikes out front. Congratulations and I will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place drove over from the west side to check it out ..Natasha excellent bartender."}
{"text":"Saw the yelp reviews of the nearby place and decided to check it out, I'm glad we did. When we got there it wasn't very busy, but by the time we left it was packed so the word is definitely spreading about how great this place is. Food menu is pretty small, but everything looks great. We tried the wine on tap (they have 2 reds and 2 whites) we tried both reds and loved them!! As for food we tried the caprese sandwich and panzanella salad. The sandwich was delicious and served with fries. Make sure to order a side of the OG sauce to dip your fries as it was very unique and has a little kick to it. The salad was good but the bread was a little too hard. Maybe that's how it's supposed to be, but it made it difficult to eat with a fork. Our server was a little spacey but he was nice. Overall we loved this cute little spot and will be back again in no time!"}
{"text":"Love this place and its vibe! Great food and rotating beers on tap. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great to grab a drink and play some giant jenga with friends and family! The patio is very nice and has a great urban setting. I went here with my family for brunch and was a bit disappointed with our experience. Our waitress was very friendly but when my dad asked to try a sample of the Bloody Mary the waitress asked the bartender to make a sample the bartender said it wasn't possible....the waitress came back and told us it wasn't possibly. I feel though they should have came back and said they would make him one and if he didn't like it he could just send it back and get something else, but that didn't happen. My dad ended up just getting water and we opted not to stay for brunch because they didn't want to offer samples, which was strange. I feel that you should always go above and beyond for your customers."}
{"text":"Didn't try the food but the beer selection was so great didn't need to to give this place 4 stars.  I was impressed with the selection of beers here, especially since they had an amazing porter on draft and a very good stout in a bottle.  Pretty cute place with a good sized crowd for mid week.  I was happy to see several beers from San Diego including the Peanut Butter Milk Stout from Belching Beaver.  If you like peanut butter this is a must try.  Original Gravity is definitely a place to return to again and again, bring your friends, meet for happy hour or just go by yourself to have a beer.  If someone in your group is not a fan of beer they do have wine.  Staff and owners are friendly and know their beer!"}
{"text":"Fantastic vibe, perfected menu of items you'll recognize but completely reimagined to be just better, and a wine selection that even your up-tight friends will appreciate, in a laid back, inclusive, industrial-chic space that is dog- friendly! Try it. Seriously, try it- the neighborhood is completely turned around."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Great ambiance, great drinks, and absolutely amazing food. I wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"This place wasn't what I was expecting. It has a real neighborhood bar feel...not as 'trendy' as I thought it would be, which is kind of a good thing. I came here with a friend. The bartender was helpful and let us sample beers before we ordered. I tried a beer I had never had before and it was quite good! Prices were average for this kind of bar. This may not be my first choice in beer bars, but I would come back, especially because they have a full food menu (a rarity amongst beer bars these days)."}
{"text":"So now they have been open for 2 weeks, and I've been back several times and tried several menu items. I must say, from experience new restaurants tend to disappoint me. With Original Gravity this is not the case. Food has been beyond delicious, to the point I am addicted to a few items on their menu. I crave it all day and anxiously wait for them to open.  The soft pretzels with cheese dipping sauce. I don't know what is in the cheese sauce, but I'm thinking it's magic, sprinkled with fairy dust and amazingness. There is no other logical explanation to how something can be so delicious.  The BLT is the best I've ever had. And I don't even like bacon!   The OG chopped salad makes me want to eat healthy. Which I never do!   Their wine and beer selection is in point and gives so many options even for the most picky drinker.    There are so many other great menu items I can't wait to try them all. Finally!!!! A great locally owned and run spot that got it right. If you haven't checked them out yet---you are only punishing yourself."}
{"text":"I'll start where we ended:  the back patio is cozy, cool, well designed.  The wall of beer labels (right before you go outside) is easy to linger at, counting the beers you've had, the ones you'll someday have, and a few you know you won't. A few nice wines on tap, nice bottle selection.  Craft beers on tap (20 I think) are diverse and well selected. Small plates are familiar but interesting and tasty.  We tried a couple and loved them. We will definitely be back, most likely for some day drinking.  Really, really liked this place.  Signage isn't great so keep your eyes open."}
{"text":"This place has amazing apps! You have to get the pretzel with cheese sauce, perfect texture and cheese sauce comes with mini candle to keep it hot. The caprese sandwich was really good.  Nice selection of beers- will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ambience: cool, modern bar... very loud however because of concrete floors.   Beer: while I didn't order any, it \"appeared\" that they had a good selection.  Most of the crowd that was there was drinking.    Food:  ordered the chopped salad and the caprese sandwich.   Salad was DRY (barely any dressing) but it had a good mix of things - just no flavor.    Caprese sandwich: basically was a grilled cheese with pesto.  It was decent, nothing special.    Service:  was fine... nice wait staff.  Ordered water - same out room temp even though it's 110 out   MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION:  Would I go back?  No.   Wish them the best and hope the find their niche."}
{"text":"Awesome place. The food is amazing! The fact that their well vodka is Tito's makes me fall in love every time I go back! The atmosphere is great and when the weather is nice the patio is the greatest! You won't be disappointed in this rare find."}
{"text":"This is a great local hangout. The reviews are correct EVERYTHING on the menu looks good. So here's what to get:   Sliders are fabulous. Pick 3: my suggestion is Korean, Hawiian, and Italian (ask for a little more sauce). You can tell they use really good quality meat, the buns aren't overbearing (unlike mine), and the veggies are fresh.   The pork belly fries are good. The cheese sauce is fabulous. If I could have it my way I would have the meat from the pork carnitas tacos on the fries with the OG sauce....heaven.   The wine and beer selection is great. Staff is so so so friendly. Natasha took care of us, and even acqiessed to my lighting suggestion (little dimmer to distinguish between resteraunt and office).   This place is a loical owned business that aims to satisfy it's customers. Support them. Looking forward to brunch and bromosas."}
{"text":"I like the drinks, the atmosphere, and most of the wait staff. I've been disappointed by the food each time. My 12 dollar burger looked like it was from McDonald's.   They have a great back patio. I'd probably come here for late night drinks, but skip the food.   Overall, I enjoy my time here- it could just use some improvement in the food arena!"}
{"text":"This is a really low key laid back place to get a good sandwich -the caprese is amazing. This place has a really nice vibe to it with trendy decor and a really nice patio. Will probably make this my go to neighborhood spot. Do recommend if you're looking for something simple and delicious in a casual ambiance."}
{"text":"I like this place. Food is awesome, the sake Bloody Mary is....interesting in a good way, and bartender was friendly. We will be back."}
