{"text":"The food was fantastic. The best macaroni & cheese I've ever had. The calamari was amazing. I want everything fried in whatever batter they use. I haven't tried their desserts, but they looked great.   I'm excited to go back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I had coffee and Really Big Breakfast. Coffee was great! Very hot and strong. Breakfast was good. Really enjoyed the thick toast and (I think) homemade sausage patties. Wife had the blueberry French toast. She thought it tasted good but was a little too mushy. Service was a bit slow based on number of customers but our waitress was very friendly. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Over the weekend I went to Cafe Really for the first time and was really pleased.  The food was good and the prices are very reasonable with a good selection.  I had the chicken salad sandwich was was wonderful and the mac and cheese was the best side item!  The portions are good sized and the staff was nice.  Great place and can't wait to go back for the blueberry french toast!"}
{"text":"Since David & I love brunch, we finally went back to try their breakfast menu. On Saturdays & Sundays, they serve b-fast until 4 pm.  We were there right at noon, and the place was pretty busy.  However, we were seated immediately.   We both decided to have a \"build your own\" Omelet. I chose turkey, jack cheese, spinach and tomato.  I also had whole wheat toast and breakfast potatoes.   The omelete was not bad, but not the best I've had.  The potatoes were really good though.   David was thrilled with his breakfast- he also had build your own omlete and got fruit and a side of french toast as well.  Jonathan was our server and he provided the best service that we have experienced in our 3 visits here.   I thought the food was pretty good, but not excellent or outstanding. However, for $7.99, I thought it was a good value."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I were stoked to try this new addition to Robinson farm. Have to say their concept is a little difficult to pin down. Good choice of meats and suppliers. Great atmosphere but could do without the tv's. We had the portobello fries to start. Good, but the tomato chutney was a little weak. Side salad was really interesting with their fig vinaigrette. My fiancée had the veggie skewers, which were nicely done. I had the Chicago dog. Too much bread, needed tomatoes and a modest celery seed bun. Service was great, just nothing groundbreaking."}
{"text":"So I'm really not sure why the bad reviews on this place.  Some flaws to be worked out, yes, but nothing bad. We had a group of 16 which met there for breakfast. With a group that size, we typically have a few errors in the orders. However, the waitress was flawless, the food came out in a timely manner (10-15 minutes) and everything was correct!  As the other reviews stated, EVERYONE was extremely friendly, the manager would come out every so often to check on the group.  And I can honestly state that everyone was willing to help with a smile on their face. The menu for breakfast/brunch was a little bit lacking, but I believe that this will change in time.  after studying the menu, I decided to have the the Monte Cristo... which they deep fry with a cheddar cheese breading. They also serve it with a raspberry sauce, which I feel is entirely too sweet for the sandwich. Other than the sauce, which the sandwich didn't need, I have absolutely no complaints on this place."}
{"text":"I went to Cafe Really thinking it would be a nice change of pace from my usual hangouts but I was wrong, dead wrong.  From the decor, name and online menu I assumed they offered mostly American cuisine but when I looked at their menu inside the restaurant they had a completely different menu with mostly Italian dishes.  For dinner I wasn't in the mood for Italian so I decided to order the meatloaf.  The server I had was very attentive and was a genuinely nice person to talk to.  After a short wait my meatloaf was served. Man was I disappointed!  I got three meager little portions of meatloaf covered in marinara sauce instead of a 'tomato glaze' as described on the menu, I wasn't able to finish it because it tasted so chewy and bland.  The mash potatoes that came with my meatloaf were okay but super garlicky but the broccoli was steamed nicely.  I feel like the kitchen is sacrificing quality attention to the food they cook for speed,  sending it out of the kitchen as fast as possible.  It's okay to slow it down guys, just relax it's dinner time after all!  The manager, Andy, seems like a horrible person to work with.  He came around and asked if everything was okay, with fake enthusiasm and smile plastered on his face, I don't like to complain so I said everything was just fine.  Meanwhile, I could hear him yelling in the kitchen and using language not suited for a family restaurant such as Cafe Really.  The restaurant was quiet enough to hear most of what he was saying and he was definitely screaming loud enough for the customers to hear...  Most families don't want to go to a 'family' restaurant where cursing would be used to liberally.  A family restaurant should not have a manager who is that dirty and flies off the handle so easily!    Over all, I would not try this place again.  The only pro's that I experienced was my server (all the servers were very nice to their tables and each other) and my side of broccoli that came with my meatloaf, but you can't really screw up steamed broccoli.  For the most part it's the manager that makes me never want to re-try this place again.  If you don't treat your kitchen and serving staff at least SOME respect how do you expect  to create a good atmosphere for the clientele?  So Cafe Really is NOT really for me."}
{"text":"We visited this morning for our second trip to Cafe Really for breakfast.  After reading previous reviews, I thought perhaps our first time was an anomaly, but this morning was another great visit!  The restaurant is bright and clean, and there were almost more servers than needed.  We were immediately greated and seated, and our server was prompt and friendly.  The food was great and very reasonably priced.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It really kills me to have to write a review like this for this restaurant, but something has gone terribly wrong since they first opened!  At first, they had a wonderful menu, with many different options such as a burger with avocado and egg on it (something you wouldn't find in many places), as well as homemade side dishes like mac and cheese.  The burgers were amazing and the sides were huge and delicious.  I started recommending this place to everyone, and went there often.  Then, something happened...something awful.  The menu was different...no more cool burger or unique sides....the menu read like a cheap, terrible diner.  The burgers we ordered were so dry and tasteless, I couldn't even eat half, the fries were sparse and cold, the service was even suffering, even though there was hardly anyone eating there.  I even went back to give it another try for breakfast, and it was even worse...not sure how you can screw up pancakes and eggs, but they managed to turn me off with dry cold eggs and probably the driest and most tasteless pancakes I have ever eaten...and that is saying a LOT!  Everyone that I had suggested go there have come back to me with very similar experiences, and are now hesitant to believe my recommendations anymore.  I would love to think they will notice the error of their ways and fix them before they go under, but I seriously have my doubts."}
{"text":"I went to Cafe Really with the lady for lunch. We were greeted by a hostess who told us there would be about a 5 to 10 minute wait, even though there were plenty of tables visibly open. (REALLY?) Hmm, ok. Later after I noted another party of two that had arrived later was seated before us, she couldn't remember who we were! (REALLY? -- do ya get it? Ok, I'll stop.) Anyway, after that we were finally seated.   I ordered the meatloaf -- a mix of Angus beef, ground pork and lamb wrapped in bacon which sounded interesting enough to warrant a meatloaf order. It came with mashed potatoes and sauteed vegetables. The meal was good! The potatoes were a bit buttery but I was very impressed with the meatloaf. Again, anytime you can associate the words \"interesting\" and \"impressive\" with meatloaf, you're doing a good job!  The lady ordered the portabella sandwich. It came with their macaroni and cheese, which was basically penne pasta with some cheese sauce on top, not even mixed in. Bummer. The sandwich looked very filling though and she seemed to enjoy it.  Our waiter was fine, but they need to get their hostess/seating situation in order. There's no need to have multiple parties waiting when there are plenty of open tables available. We will be back to try out their breakfast options, and hopefully we just caught them on a bad day for service."}
{"text":"Entered the restaurant around 8PM on a Friday..not terribly busy...we were seated right away..Greeted by a friendly hostess and as soon as we were seated  a very efficient and friendly waiter...\"'Andrew\".  We ordered the Fried green Tomatoes with goat cheese and onion relish to start..it came quickly and was fresh fried ,,short on the goat cheese ..three little scoops on four tomatoes, but very good.  Next I ordered the appetizer Lamb Sliders and Portebello Fries for my entree and my husband ordered the REALLY Burger with Mac and Cheese side for his entree. Our waiter  \"Andrew\", was very efficient in filling our water and taking care of our plates. My Lamb sliders were very short on the meat (barely a tbls of Lamb on each one} and way too sweet...the Portebello Fries I had to send back..they burned my mouth from the salt in the batter...and I adore salty things... My husbands Really Burger with a fried egg, bacon, tomato, and fresh horsereadish sauce was good.  It is a very brightly lit restaurant..looks like it was a self service place before..they will have to step up on the recipes and darken it up a bit to appeal to the late night crowd..they are open 24 hours on Fri and Sat... I don't think we will go back...nope ,...not REALLY....."}
{"text":"It's an easy place to go eat with good service, but it won't blow you away. For the food, we had good muffins, the beef stroganoff was ok, salmon was good, and the beer specials were good with $2 blue moons.  Prices were decent, entrees were $13-17 and there are sandwich options at lower prices Atmosphere seems confused - it feels like a place that should serve pizza and ice cream.  It lacks ambiance and a defining menu to get more stars."}
{"text":"We wanted to like this place, as we're always on the hunt for another good breakfast place. However, Cafe Really was nothing special. The flies inside the restaurant were an immediate turn off. Having to wait nearly 30 minutes for our breakfast to be served was much too long. While my blueberry lemon french toast was very fresh, yummy & unique, my husband's egg white omelet was just OK. Fruit, which should be in season right now, was again, just OK. We looked for some healthier side options such as turkey bacon or turkey sausage, but only the regular offering are available here, despite the server telling us those sides are often requested. Kudos to our server, Lance, who was cheerful and friendly. (If I could add another half star to my rating, I would because of our good server.) Unfortunately, the rest of the staff seemed indifferent to be there, with very little engagement and even fewer smiles. For about $20, the price for two of us was OK but the overall experience wasn't impressive. (We passed on the $2 coffee.) We would not go out of our way to dine here again."}
{"text":"I was really happy when this restaurant opened.  The concept sounded great, and it is very close to my house.  I was looking forward to having another local place for breakfast.  I went there soon after opening, and I remember it being just OK.  I went back today though with a few others and will review today.  We were greeted by an employee who looked like he didn't much care if we were there or not.  He sat us and moved on.  The decorations are nice - the place is bright and colorful, lots of televisions around for entertainment.  We all had coffee - $2.  Not all that great, and the waiter didn't keep it topped up.  He came back once and we had to ask for some more.  The food took a while to come out.  About 20 minutes.  Which would be OK if the food were worth the wait, or if it were busy.  But it was not either.  We had a potato hash dish.  The concept was good, but poorly executed.  The diced potatoes were swimming in some sort of garlic butter.  There was little sausage in the dish.  The eggs were ordered over medium and came over easy.  Flavor was good for the most part.    Salmon benedict - again great concept.  Salmon was good, but the eggs were not cooked - the poached eggs had runny whites.  Could not eat one of them.  The french toast was a a little pricey, and came with no sides.  It also seemed that one piece was not fried on one side, since it was raw.    We had bacon.  Many pieces were burnt, I would not feed these to my children.  Other pieces were good.    I REALLY wanted to like this place.  It is local, and if it were great I would go there weekly.  But at this point, I won't go back for breakfast.  They will get another chance for a lunch one day.  Also, they have $2 draft beer all the time.  Maybe I will just go there to drink."}
{"text":"I met a friend there for breakfast and was excited about the menu and could hardly wait to order. Our server was nice and but perhaps not the best in service. I ordered the Strawberry  White Chocolate Cheesecake French Toast and had high expectations, my friend an Omelet. We both ordered coffe and water. We got the coffe the water took several tries. Food came and looked lovely, french toast was very pretty.However it was not good, strawberries( only two on plate) were frozen sundae topping, cheesecake was prepared commercial filling and had a slight taste of onion from the fridge, friends omelet had no seasoning in it at all. Used a coupon and only cost 1.72 but still it was a meal wasted that could have been eaten elsewhere. I am begining to wonder if anyone with acess to a Restaurant depot now thinks they can open a restaurant.Needless to say we wil not go back and that YELP will filter this reveiw as it may hurt their advertising chances.  So they went out of business EALLY NOT SURPRISED at all"}
{"text":"Cafe Really was really bad. We went for breakfast so I can only hope their lunch/dinner items are better. There was nothing that tasted good and it was very disappointing. There are so many great restaurants in Charlotte I will not be going back to Cafe Really. Also thought it was over priced."}
{"text":"Had Breaky in this cute place. Service was sweet & southern as expected. Food was good and inexpensive."}
