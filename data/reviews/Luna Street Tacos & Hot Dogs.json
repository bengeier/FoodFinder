{"text":"Very friendly guys that make great food!  These are the best tacos you'll get in this area.  The Pastor and Carne Asada tacos are amazing.  Double corn tortilla, meat, cilantro and onions.  They serve it with carmelized onions and a pepper on the side.  Their green and red sauce are perfect.  You can also wash it all down with a litre of Mexican Coke.   If you're looking for some great tacos / quesadillas, this is the place!   I also noticed the 2 star review from some idiot here.  Door Dash doesn't deliver in East Mesa, nor do these guys serve guac, beans and rice.  It's a street taco place.  I think someone is a little confused :("}
{"text":"Nice change a pace for the Far East Valley. Sonora Hotdogs $4, street tacos 2$. Other options available. Authentic Mexican Street food. Would like to see a fish option and Mexican corn on the cob. Very nice owner operator, accepts call in to go orders. We will be back for sure, give it a try."}
{"text":"Ok time to find all the local taco shops!! This place was cool, taco Tuesday time. I like how the beef was chunky, with a side of a big pepper! I tried the Sonorna hotdog and it was fire, we don't have a lot of places that serve the hot dogs in Cali. I will be back for my taco and hotdog cravings. And great nice customer service"}
{"text":"Excellent food! I love a good Sonoran dog and the tacos are awesome. Prices are really good. I just wish they were open for lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! Don't underestimate the small trailer or location. Loved the food - the prices are awesome and the service is great as well. They will NOT disappoint! I promise!!"}
{"text":"BEST HOTDOGS EVER!!!!!! if you're looking for authentic Sonoran hotdogs in AZ then this is the place for you. The customer service is amazing and you can also order off them from Postmates. They serve out of the cutest little RV, so make sure to keep a look out for their flashing lights to find them!"}
{"text":"Is this restaurant still in business?  I've stopped by several times and it's always closed. No one answers the phone.  I really wanted to eat here."}
{"text":"Great place, didn't have the elote available yet. Said it was coming soon!!! Took a little bit to get the food, kinda what you have to expect with truck food tho. Not a lot of seating, would recommend bringing your own fold out chair"}
{"text":"Came here last minute, boyfriend got 3 street tacos and I got the Sonoran dog of course! So effing yummy!! The chorizo and pastor tacos were incredible and best Sonoran dog ever. Such good prices too! YUM!"}
{"text":"Luna is a street taco truck/trailer in the parking lot of a local title loan business.  You can't miss the white trailer lined with flashing lights.  While you can eat on-site (there is one plastic table and chairs), the food is best taken to go. The menu board is to the left of the ordering window. While not abundant with menu items, there is a good selection of meat. Tacos or quesadillas are available in chorizo, chicken, barbacoa, al pastor or carne asada. There are several styles of Sonoran hot dogs as well.  The staff was very kind and friendly. The tacos and quesadillas were very good. They were not mind-blowing, but had good flavor, texture and freshness. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Disappointed!!  We have been wanting for weeks to try their Sonoran dogs so I drove the 15 minutes to try them last night.  Got there at opening time ( 5:30)... no truck.  Waited until 5:55 and still no truck.  Needless to say we will not be back.  Next time we have a craving for dogs we'll go to Moreno's on Power."}
{"text":"Let me just say awesome tacos! We are visiting from out of town and decided to try this. We got a variety of pastor, carne asada and chicken tacos with a variety of their sauces and all were beautifully done and oh so tasty. Made my Dad's eyes light up - we'll be back!"}
{"text":"First time trying Luna' s. I ordered the carne asada and chicken tacos. Simple yet delicious. I'll be back to try something else on the menu."}
