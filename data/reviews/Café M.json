{"text":"We stopped by yesterday finally after months of walking past it. The place was nice and cozy yet full for a holiday. The owner was so adorable and nice we ordered two lattes one was almond. While we had no expectations the lattes were too hot that it probable burnt the crema and they both tasted like watered down coffee. 

It was too bad because we were excited to taste verve a roaster out of Cali."}
{"text":"Overall, this place needs a lot of work to survive in the Montreal cafe scene.  A few good points, the barista was nice and the service was good.  Note though, I've read that people who work here don't speak English, and I found that to be true.  I switched over to French and it was fine, but for those who can't communicate in French, ordering and such may be a bit difficult.  Another good point is that the place is quite clean for those who care about this kind of stuff.  Onto the negatives, first, the coffee is in desperate need of improvement.  The cappuccino was bland and watered-down.  This place screams of \"we offer coffee but we don't appreciate coffee at all.\"  Second, the muffin I had was dry like cardboard and also devoid of taste, closing in to the point of not being edible.  Third, the atmosphere was a bit strange, the music was like stuff you'd hear in a dentist office, and the space itself is a bit tight in a way I'm not sure I would qualify as cozy, but more that it's just a somewhat crammed space with furniture oddly laid out.  So style-wise, it doesn't really fit the vibrancy and warmth you can find at other Montreal cafes."}
{"text":"I found Cafe M to have a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere. Perfect for students studying or to meet up with a friend. The presentation of the drinks was also very nice served on a small wooden platter. Staff very friendly. Definitely recommend as a place to check out :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic service! Kenyan roast for the cortado was delicious. The music was amazingly relaxing. I wish I had brought my book. Free Wi-Fi. And again the service is amazing, so kind and attentive."}
{"text":"Bah...
J'ai fait un petit tour à ce café. Rien d'exceptionnel à signaler: le latté goûte le brûlé et l'endroit est minuscule et peu éclairé.

Dommage..."}
{"text":"This place is great--super conveniently located off st lau, fantastic coffee and really amazing staff. The place is pretty big even though it looks tiny from the outside. There are candles and plants and the ambience is really nice. Seating is comfortable, hardwood floors and a pretty sophisticated looking espresso machine and kitchen. Quiet save for the barista making friendly conversation with a customer"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this cafe! The barista and owner of the cafe is the nicest man I have ever met. He is super friendly and is willing to help me improve my French. Their baked goods are really good, especially their matcha baked goods. I tried their matcha muffin with white chocolate chips. Their cappuccino is also very good! The cafe is great to meet up with a friend and to study. It isn't that spacious so it would not be recommended to study with a group here. This is an absolute must try!!"}
{"text":"Totally charming. Great service--spectacular actually. The classic tartiflette was delicious. Randomly found it off a side street. I will intentionally return my next trip."}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal, we stopped into Café M several times. Each time we were there, the chemex coffee was great and the breakfast sandwiches were delicious. The atmosphere was very nice and comfortable. The owner was so nice and warm that he boosted our experience from great to exceptional each time we visited. I would highly recommend this place and would certainly make a point to visit again if I find myself back in Montreal."}
{"text":"C'est pas mal du tout comme endroit! Je crois que je vais y passer la journée. Il fait chaud. Peut-être un peu trop. J'ai pas dormi la nuit dernière, alors je suis sensible. Faudrait que je me coupe les cheveux. Le serveur est super nice! Le café est pas mal. La musique est bonne. C'est petit, mais pas trop. On peut y venir avec quelques amis. J'aime le côté hippie fancy."}
{"text":"Great little spot with healthy menu options and good coffee. The bagel burger is a spectacular creation featuring a variety of sautéed vegetables (zucchini, squash), kale, and your choice of bacon or ham. Excellent value here. 

Not particularly English friendly, so it is good to know what you want ahead of time and be clear with the staff. Otherwise, I'd recommend Code Black up Saint Laurent."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in, I fell in love with this place. The decor is impeccable, the wi-fi is top-notch, nice music selection (jazz, soul and old school pop) and the owner is a sweetheart! Coffee is good and strong, and their baked goods selection is bound to make your mouth water. And they have an adorable little terrasse out back. This is probably one of my favorite coffee shops in Montreal now. 

(About getting served in English: the barista there was anglophone as far as I could tell. You shouldn't have a problem!)"}
{"text":"This is an adorable coffee shop, with even nicer staff! We came to Montreal from Toronto and were in desperate need of coffee to start off our day. Pleasantly surprised to find that there was a little local coffee shop down the street from our Airbnb. 

The shop itself is a nicely sized coffee shop, maybe on the smaller side. It has books to enjoy while you drink your coffee (unsure if it is free or not). They also sold little jams, coffee beans and other charcuterie supples. 

The coffee was delicious!! We both had a double shot latte and adored every last sip. Would recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"I was recently in Montreal for the first time staying Airbnb style like a 2min walk from Cafe M. All I can say is the food an atmosphere was the best. The guy behind the counter was the SWEETEST and the food is made from scratch, not premade like the crap most cafes in the States do. My boyfriend got the Breakfast Burger and I got a potato and cream dish that was to die for. If your in the Boul St-Laurent area look down the side streets and you will find little gems like these!"}
{"text":"Situated on Avenue des Pins, Café M is an ideal place for anyone looking for good quality coffee and a relaxed atmosphere. Café M's European flare is accentuated with its homemade soups and pastries. With brownies, gingerbread, and matcha muffins, Café M's selection is always fresh and different every day. He even offers a typical Alpine dish, called 'Tartiflette.' I also came here for Brunch and loved it, especially the freshly pressed juice. 

Overall, Café M brings a level of warmth and comfort to Montreal's snowy streets, enhanced by its service, goods, and décor. The interior gives off a beach-like vibe, filled with Westfalias--specially converted Volkswagen camper vans that were popular in the 1950s--and surfboards. The owner takes a real pleasure in creating a neighbourhood feel and loves spending time chatting with his customers."}
{"text":"Déçu sur plusieurs points dans ce café ....

Tout d'abord le service en nous servant nos 2 cafés à 10 minutes d'intervalles ce qui n'est pas idéale lorsque l'on est 2.  Mon café est donc froid lorsque le plat ainsi que le 2ème café sont arrivés. 
Pour le 2ème café j'ai du allé leur demander quand est ce qu'on allait l'avoir pour qu'ils se bougent et se rendent compte qu'ils n'avaient pas encore rajouté de l'eau pour finir l'infusion.
Personne n'était en train d'être servis, les 2 serveurs étaient juste en train de parler entre eux au lieu de faire leur boulot ...
Idem merci au serveur français de nous passer du rap français avec des superbes paroles pourries un dimanche midi alors que tu viens chercher une atmosphère posée et tranquille pour prendre ton brunch café ... Je ne viens pas pour qu'une pollution sonore accompagne mon repas !

Au niveau de la nourriture les 2 bagels burgers étaient fades ... Vraiment sans goûts alors que la recette avait un réel potentiel et nous donnait envie ...
On avait pris un muffin au thé macha et bleuet (aucun gout non plus) et un brioche à la cannelle qui était bonne elle

Le café était bon.

En clair c'est la première et dernière fois pour moi dans ce café ...."}
{"text":"The Barista girl was super nice but she doesn't know how to make coffee. All the coffee we ordered were bitter and the muffin was as hard as a rock."}
{"text":"I first came to this place after seeing a picture my friend posted on Instagram of what looked like epic coffee. The day my boyfriend and I planned to go, he came back from his run in the morning saying he had stopped by with a friend and was blown away. This made me even more excited to check it out.

We went around 3pm on a Saturday and the place was pretty full. Despite this, we were immediately greeted by the owner, and he personally took our orders. We just showed him the picture, apparently it was the chemesc option. He also made sure to ask if I wanted my milk warmed up or not. I was blown away by both the quality and presentation of the coffee. There was enough coffee in our big chemesc to have about 3 teacups each- a really great value. I also had a green tea muffin and my boyfriend had a hot chocolate which we enjoyed.

I returned on Monday afternoon in order to do some work. The place was pretty quiet, a few other students working. I ordered the matcha latte. To be honest, I didn't like it that much. Since I was there so long, I decided to order a chai latte which was delicious and made up for the mediocre matcha latte. The owner was so sweet and kept asking me how my work was going, what sort of student I was, and he even brought me a free orange cranberry muffin. I will definitely be returning here often to do work, or to just have a delicious treat. 

The service, quality, and atmosphere cannot be matched!"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe with delicious pastries made in house! Chai also made in house and very tasty! Excellent service."}
{"text":"Petit café local sympa ouvert depuis fin janvier 2015, situé sur Des Pins entre St-Laurent & St-Dominique. Le patron, un français, Walter, vous accueillera avec un sourire pour prendre votre commande au comptoir. Il propose du café de qualité (expresso/latté/chemex/...) des torréfacteurs \"Barista\" de Montréal & \"Verve\" de Santa Cruz en Californie. Il a des viennoiseries/biscuits/muffins fait maison, ainsi que des soupes/tartiflettes. Les prix sont corrects dans la norme et le service est très sympa, personnalisé et aussi très social. La devanture extérieure grise est jolie et les gros pots en stainless devant font classes. La déco intérieure est simpliste mais cool avec des cadres Westfalia. Bien sûr, y'a du wifi gratuit et des prises de courant pour bosser. Un petit café indépendant sympa pour venir socialiser, travailler ou encore prendre son expresso quotidien sur la go. 5/5 visité en février 2015."}
{"text":"Beautiful chill hangout sport amazing almond milk matcha latte and really nice lounging work environment"}
{"text":"Had to give this place a 5 star. Not only is the service seriously 10/10 but the food and drinks are bombbbb for a cafe, and the atmosphere is super cozy! ALSO, I have a serious pet peeve with studying in dirty environments, and even though this cafe is always bustling with customers, the place is always clean and the counters are never greasy! 

Most of all though, you know the cafe's good when the owner seems to really care about the customers. He's not that good at english but he's one of the most enthusiastic and genial cafe owners i've met! After staying nearly 30 mins after closing time, I finally realized that no one was around and that he was calmly waiting at the register just cleaning the same old corner for the past 30 minutes waiting I guess...for me to leave. He didn't even mention it, and was so sweet when I apologized for my finals week obliviousness. 

PS: please take the green matcha cakes they're so good!!

Ugh love this place"}
{"text":"J'adore cette nouvelle tendance que les Français ont de venir ouvrir des cafés à Montréal. On s'éloigne enfin des baristas hipster du Mile End à qui il est difficile d'adresser la parole parce que leur latte art commande toute leur attention. *Fin du coup de gueule.*

Café M a été ouvert il y a 7 mois par un ancien restaurateur, Walter, qui ne tarit ni d'explications ni d'anecdotes dans son service. J'y suis allée un jeudi matin très tranquille et nous avons donc eu l'occasion de faire connaissance. Il est souriant et très sociable et compte, sans surprise, de nombreux habitués parmi sa clientèle. Sur sa recommandation, j'ai tenté l'expérience du chemex - une infusion lente de café filtre, qui prend quelques minutes à préparer, mais permet de développer toutes les saveurs du café et résulte en un goût très parfumé, doux et sans l'amertume habituelle du grain. Très intéressant!

L'espace est un peu restreint, mais il y a quelques tables et du bon wifi, donc il est possible d'y travailler hors des périodes d'achalandage. La déco est un peu \"vibe californien,\" avec des images de Westfalia encadrées au mur et une petite planche de surf dans la vitrine.

N'oubliez pas de goûter à leur spécialité: les muffins maison au matcha, fraises en compote et pépites de chocolat blanc."}
{"text":"Petit halte chaleureux, tranquilité sur place, varieté des boissons chaudes et grignotines bagels etc. Wifi disponible , service personalisé."}
{"text":"Cute, hipster cafe with organic food options and yummy drinks.   I had an iced chai which was delicious and not sweetened.   Their scones are very fresh, with great ingredients - I had a cranberry, walnut."}
