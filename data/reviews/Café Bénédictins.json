{"text":"Excellent food with friendly staff and cozy environment. 

Ordered the steak and eggs, it came with a generous portion of fruits and patoatoes.

Steak was very rare just like i like it, beans tasted homemade, many coffee refills...What can i say, i left the place full and everything was good, including the company :)"}
{"text":"Merci @Mariko qui m'a fait découvrir ce petit coin de délice pour les brunchs. Mes oeufs bénédictines Maison/house étaient bien fait, bien pochés et la hollandaise..hhhmmmm... Comme on dit par chez moi:\"cela fait du bien par où que ça passe\" :) Je reviendrai c'est certain."}
{"text":"Tried this amazing family friendly brunch place and don't regret it! Good portions and delicious meals! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came her for brunch last Sunday with some Yelper friends, 

I'm very traditional in my breakfast and stick with my bacon & eggs kind of plate. I decided to go all out and add some sausage, ham and french toast to it all (#3 Special)
Most shocking of all is that the coffee was actually decent, unlike most breakfast places.

Everything was tasty, the eggs were nicely runny and the meats were top-notch. The breakfast potatoes are so satisfying and the nice cup of fruit plates shows it's not an afterthought.

Despite people waiting in line, we never felt rushed to leave as we were chit-chatting away even after finishing our plates. Nobody was in a rush today and it's all good.

Our waiter explained he was new but was super friendly and fixed a mistake on my bill right away. Coffee refills and edits to the menu were very welcome.

The place is very noisy (at least on Sunday) so keep that in mind if you just wanna grab a bite before work and just read the newspaper.

Prices are very affordable and it's not hard to find parking in the area."}
{"text":"We had a breakfast there a few weeks ago. Typical breakfast with absolutely nothing special to it. Service was veeeery slow but at lease. pleasant."}
{"text":"Always worth it to give a place a second chance. 

First visit here with my bf left me not wanting to review this place: to give them a second shot to redeem themselves. Food was excellent but the service we received on that particular occasion was enough for my bf to write this place off. They forgot our smoothie, didn't refill our coffee, didn't clear our plates, didn't come to see if we enjoyed our meals... Bref I was not impressed. 

Came back today for a UYE brunch and none of us was disappointed. Service was excellent. Food was delicious! I ordered the Maison Bénédictins (first time ever ordering eggs Benedict - i usually go with good ol' bacon n eggs). It was with Portobello mushrooms and brie cheese, ordered a side of bacon - not crisp. The bacon was perfect, the Benedict was very tasty and original but ultimately the brie cheese was too subtle for this plate n while the mushrooms went beautifully with the hollandaise sauce, not so much with the eggs themselves. Would definitely order Bene again but next time i'm going with the triple cheese option. 

Price is reasonable for the plates and quality of the food: the potatoes here are off the hook especially if ur a fan of green onion like me!

I could definitely be persuaded to come back, though sans the bf cuz he's not guna give these guys the second shot i did."}
{"text":"Ça fait quelques fois que je viens déjeuner ici et je me dis tout le temps que je vais le mettre sur Yelp. Alors voilà. CHECK!

Café Bénédictins, quand c'est dans le nom du commerce, tu peux t'imaginer que les \"bénés\" sont s'a coche! le menu très détaillé offre vraiment tout les types déjeuners. Sucré, salé, copieux et santé. J'suis aussi toujours bien contente quand je reçois ma facture que ça ne me coûte pas les yeux de la tête. Aussi, le service est toujours très courtois et rapide. Ils ne chôment pas sur le café, ma tasse est toujours pleine :) Gros plus plus!

Petit coup de coeur pour les patates à déjeuner et l'option de choisir entre fruits et tomates dans l'assiette. Tomates pour moi svp

N.B. Ils servent aussi un menu dîner que je n'ai pas encore essayé, mais selon une copine, c'est pas mal bon et vraiment pas cher."}
{"text":"Pretty average at everything. Any place that makes all the fast food stuff, lots of breakfast options, salads, and Chinese and other cuisines, is usually average because how do you perfect like 10 cuisines? Anyway I like their eggs Benedict but it's not the best in the city. I also made the mistake of ordering it on ubereats and that was not yummy lol. Unless you like eggs benny pudding."}
