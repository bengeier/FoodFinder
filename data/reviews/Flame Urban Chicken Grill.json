{"text":"Seriously....my first taste was a blind taste. The subtle simplicity made the taste experience ironically complex. I was asked to try a dry rub drumette, moist and flavorful! As I was leaving this wonderful little section of flame grilled corn on the cob was offered! Once again great! The space itself is spacious and clean.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch yesterday and it was so good I went back today.  Great food, made to order.  Extensive menu with eight, serious, chef prepared sauces.  The antibiotic and hormone free chicken is perfectly cooked.  From bowls, to wraps (think great burritos with a twist), to salads... a great and extensive menu.  Looks like about twenty choices on the toppings.  They also have combo meals, individual pieces of chicken and \"Flamadillas\".  Overall, this place surprised me in so many ways.  The quality of the food and the expert preparation, the well trained staff, the decor is very slick, it's clean as a pin, and has an all round good vibe.  Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today, I chose the make your own flame bowl.  Everything was fantastic from the corn salsa, guacamole to the custom BBQ sauce.  Very fast, and affordable for a healthy lunch option.  I really enjoy finding surprising little places like this in my travels, and will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Reminded me a little of chipotle except the portion was that much more. I made two meals out of one, and it was very tasty as well. Had a bowl (made my own) and would be open to trying their other selections. Remember if it's chicken you want - chicken you get."}
{"text":"FLAME is Awesome! Started going right after they opened a couple of years ago, it's the only Mexican grill I go to on the east side. Just pick a bowl or build your own. Change the sauces and a few add-ins and you've got a whole new experience. I've had the grilled chicken by the piece and the parmesan corn too, very good also. It's wonderful to have an option like this amongst the fast food establishments in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I 1st fell in love with Flame Grilled Half Chicken over 20 yrs ago in Los Angeles eating at the El Pollo Loco chain restaurants. With the exception of the similar knock off chain restaurants in Florida & New Jersey. I've NEVER been able to get that familiar flavorful grilled taste in Cleveland. Yesterday I saw a fb ad for this restaurant & gave it a try today. After a  20 min drive from  a SE Suburb I arrived & the place itself is super clean. The wait staff were very patient, knowledgeable & helpful with the menu options & combinations  of all the different sauces & choices.  Now to the best part, the food: The grilled half chickens were cooked to perfection. They have a 'soulful tasting' dry rub on them that is not Citrussy like El Pollo Loco & its East Coast chain cousins. The seasonings work PERFECT on the Chicken. The half chicken was very juicy & tasty. The breast was not dry & underneath the thigh was cleaned (imagine the gook left underneath a Boston Market half) The sauces were unique & I fell in love with the Cilantro Lime & Garlic Parmesan. The rices both tasted fresh & flavorful also. The grilled corn was also exceptionally good with a smokey grilled taste & their unique combination of toppings. Kudos to the owner who developed & executed this concept to PERFECTION. I will be returning soon & often. BRAVO !!!"}
{"text":"Flames was delicious! The variety of sauces made the food exciting to try. Without even asking one of the workers gave me samples of all the sauces. I eventually chose three (sorry I can't remember the names). Two were mixed and one on the side. My co-workers got their wings and I will def try those next time with the urban corn."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time and was disappointed . Ordered to go since seating was limited. My first impression was I smelled no food cooking and thought turn around things must be old... I should have followed my instincts. We ordered a bowl and wings.  The wings were prepared by pulling them out of a metal container that simply sat on a grill that were then tossed back on a grill under a lid to \"heat back up\" . This was a bit disturbing but I watched .. long story short the food was not hot when we got home  so we went home and put in oven for 15 min ..even after that I ended up an hour later doubled over returning it to my toilet . I called and let the one employee know that our food was room temp and asked when the chicken was made that day and he honestly didn't know . I am sorry I wanted to like this place but when you serve warmed over chicken that still isn't hot and room temperature it is not acceptable .  I am surprised that others have given the reviews that brought me here in the first place  . I am waiting to speak to the owner ... The only positive was the employees were friendly and helpful explaining things to us as it was our first time.  Follow up -spoke with owner and he was very defensive .. I checked my phone log and receipt and we were there checking out at 6:58 pm. I called to ask for the manager and find out when the chicken was originally cooked and was told there was none there . The owner claimed he personally made wings before he left and that most likely I had the AC on in my car blasting which was the reason food was cold!? Also told me they serve room temp food and it is allowed. I have never spoken to someone so defensive without even listening to the customer . He stood on his reviews insinuating I had to be wrong...he mentioned never having a  food poisoning incident even though I didn't even mention food poisoning . I am not trying to sue or anything other than tell him the food we got was not hot and sub par . After eating this food and then dealing with this owner Ziad Achkar I will tell you I went in because of the reviews but I will not return because of his attitude and lack of concern as well as not even apologizing for my bad experience . Just because you claim you never had any issues there is always a first time . Acknowledge the possibility and make your customer feel like you are concerned before getting defensive and blaming the customer for their bad experience ! I would not recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"I had to come up with a meal for 7 of us quickly so I called Flame. Through their reasonable catering menu, I was able to get an amazing spread of food for all of us to get two full meals plus a couple of days of snacking. The wings and bowls were fresh and full of an assortment of flavors. I would buy the curry and cilantro-lime sauces by the bottle. Yum! We will be regulars."}
{"text":"This place is an excellent alternative to Chipotle if you are in the Glenville neighborhood and don't feel like making the drive to University Circle. Three kinds of rice, an assortment of meats and veggies, and 6 different sauces round up the options for creating your bowl or burrito. They also have other menu options like grilled chicken tenders and whole chickens! If you want options, this is your place! I recommend the urban crema sauce!"}
