{"text":"This place was renovated a couple of years back and nice atmosphere and pleasant staff .    The food is made fresh and I love the Curry Shrimp and Potato in Roti ..   Huge portion and never dry !    Highly recommend this place .  My favorite Curry Place in Toronto ."}
{"text":"This is the genuine article.  Everything made from scratch, fresh, right on the premises.   Even the roti skins.   Roxanne and Mack are wonderful hosts who take great pride in sharing the wonderful food that they create.   They did a terrific job looking after our large crew today and were a delight to deal with.   If you think that you have eaten great roti, you owe it to yourself to try this place.  This is where real Toronto eats.   Also loved the goat."}

Microwaved curry & roti, with the centre still cold!

This was a huge disappointment given the high Yelp reviews. The decor was nice, but we should have realized the food was not fresh when we heard the microwave beeping when the owner/cook was preparing another customer's order. We still gave the restaurant a chance and placed our order. The patties were soggy, not crisp (*beep*beep*) The chicken roti was cold in the inside (*beep*beep*)

We left the restaurant without finishing the food. Best decision we made that day. 

Would give this place 0 stars, if I could. Won't be going back. In fact, it pains us to still see it open whenever we pass by the area."}

The shop has been in business around for 30+ years and recently undergone a full renovation on the tv show restaurant takeover giving it a fresh and modern appearance. 
I suggest trying the fish cakes and goat roti."}
{"text":"Might want to consider take-out, this place is hot in the summer time!

It's a nice cozy family run restaurant, with a wall of different spices they use .

Of course when I come to The Curry and Roti Restaurant, I order the lamb curry with Roti. 

My friend ordered the jerk chicken and I can say I'm more impressed with their chicken than their curry and roti.

I was expecting a bowl of curry with roti on the side, but outcomes a crepe. The currry is wrapped in the roti and now my roti is all soft :("}
{"text":"Wow! My boyfriend was working in the neighbourhood and brought us a delicious meal from Curry + Roti. We'd been meaning to try their food since seeing them on TV -the family seemed so nice, decent and hardworking that we wanted to support them, and I am glad we did!! I wasn't there in person, but was told that the service was kind and genuine when he ordered.

I had the chicken curry over rice. Even in a Styrofoam clamshell, there was clear effort put into  plating: fresh herbs sprinkled over the curry and a small salad of raw veg in the corner. The sauce was heady with decent heat, but well balanced. The meat was so tender and juicy: It fell apart in my mouth! Coupled with the sweet scorch of the scotch bonnet sauce that came with it, it was definitely a home run.

My partner's goat roti fared less well. He said the goat was a little dry, which was disappointing. I think he's jealous cos my chicken was a lot nicer. Despite that, we'll be going back next time we're in the area and try some other dishes."}
