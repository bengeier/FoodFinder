{"text":"Seriously, JR's fish and chips? Try JR's Fish Sticks and Fries.  You are better off saving some money and going to the Fry's across the street and buying frozen pre-battered fish, and frozen fries."}
{"text":"God dammit JR's Fish and Chips.  God dammit.  I was so excited when I saw the old Jack in the Crack at 35th and Peoria being converted into the Fish and Chips Joint.    For the record I am a huge Pete's fan.  I dropped in Friday night.  I ordered shrimp and fries and hush puppies.  Their system of walk up order then get in a second line was confusing people.  Add into that mix the woman actually running the register and handling the cash was probably tweaking her balls off.  Or she was an ex tweaker that forgot how to act normal or she was just nuts.  She was openly talking shit to the guy ordering in front of me when he had something to say about her register skills.  Any way surreal experience to say the least.  Down to the food.  Oh I ate that greasy ass shit.  I ate the fuck out of it.  But it was all pre-packaged frozen shrimp and fries and the same for the hush puppies, over cooked balls of hard crust.  So shame on you JR's.  The place had some people in it too.  I wont be back unless the start advertising fresh seafood."}
{"text":"I finally made it over to Jr's.   I had 3 piece cod with frys, the kids had a burger and the fish and shrimp combo. Everything was made correctly and tasted excellent.   The fish was not greasy, the frys did not taste fishy, the burger was perfect for the kid. The tarter sauce was good too.   I will be back to try some more things.   Only downfall was they were out of lemons and had one bottle of malt vinegar to share in the whole place. Oh and they charge for credit or debit purchases."}
