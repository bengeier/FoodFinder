{"text":"La meilleure poutine et les meilleurs hamburgers du Plateau ou même de Montréal. Un personnel accueillant , toujours de la bonne musique et des quantités rassasiantes! Tels sont les ingrédients pour passer un excellent moment !"}
{"text":"Went here with friends who were specifically looking for great poutine. I ordered the chorizo poutine: who can resist fries *and* sausage? Turns out it was fine, but nothing special. I'm not sure, but suspect the fries were not quite fresh out of the deep frier.  Service was pleasant and friendly. Nice welcoming decor. Not too big, so pretty quiet."}
{"text":"Jamaica Plain is in the house tonight. *dancing in place*  No question, The Plateau boasts beautiful scenery, is the most trendy neighborhood of all Montreal and is my favorite part of the city to pound the pavement and explore. Also as a side note, If you're in to world class street graffiti, you've just found the mother load. Be sure to bring a camera as photo ops in this area are abundant.  Mange-Moi opened its doors on Mont Royal in June 2013 and is conveniently located just a few minutes away from the Orange Line Metro. This cozy burger bar seats about 20 people and has a pretty good menu - consisting of among others, burgers, hot dogs and of course, poutine - and bar selection. the fruity looking drinks in the mason jar looks very refreshing, though I chose to go for a shirley temple instead. Don't ask.  Fresh off burning a stick of some of that Montreal good, I decided to go for the CRAB CAKE BURGER, which was amazing! Very flavorful. The meat was super fresh, and was accompanied with a very well portioned caesar salad and crispy thick cut frites. The presentation was also pretty cool, as it was plated on a cutting board. Overall one of my favorite dishes of the past year for sure. It even prompted me to dap up the chef after my meal for well deserved props to my culinary ninja.  If ever on Mont Royal and fixing for a hearty meal, be sure to stop by Mange-Moi. You are guaranteed to leave with a smile from ear to ear.   Go Bruins!!!   *Beantowns Finest*"}
{"text":"I went to Mange-moi on a Saturday night around 8pm. The server was friendly and prompt. I ordered a poutine and a mason jar of sangria. Mason jar cocktails are all the rage these days and Mange-moi has a whole spread of 'em. To be honest the sangria I had was average, nothing to write home about. But the poutine was good. Both are classics that are hard to screw up. Overall to me, this resto doesn't really stand out in any unique way. If you go, you will enjoy yourselves."}
{"text":"Des frites pour la Poutine qui i n'était pas cuite suffisamment de même que la viande du hamburger c'est dommage mais c'est peut-être pour cela qu'il n'y avait que 5 clients en plein jeudi midi.   L'atmosphère est bonne et le service courtois et professionnel."}
{"text":"Came here for burger week since i am such a huge foodie. Presentation was pretty, fries were awesome and my hubby liked the salad dressing. The burger unfortunately, pulled pork, beef, gravy & cheese curds, was very bland needed seasoning. Def not a great start to burger week."}
{"text":"This is the best burger I have found in Montreal, hands down. Sadly, the music is downright offensive. I would give this place a much higher rating otherwise. I know lots of restaurant owners choose to play top 40 pop music because it is supposed to be inoffensive to the masses but I think we all know that is no longer the case. Everything else about this place seems really fresh and natural except for the fake robot voices screaming at customers from loud speakers in every corner. Please, I beg of you. Play something at least somewhat neutral in there, or at least turn it down so the music can be more easily blocked out by patrons who are offended by it. I know I am not the only one."}
{"text":"The food was ok but the service was below average.  Our waitress prefered cleaning over serving us.  They state that all the sauces are home made but even the cook was clueless on what was in the sauces because they're not 100% home made."}
{"text":"their daily promotions are pretty great, and the mason jar cocktails are tasty and strong."}
{"text":"On a vraiment aime les burgers et les frites. Mais la sangria ressemblait plus a un jus de fruit qu'un alcool..a 24 dollars Le picher, on s'attendait a mieux. Mais l'ambiance etait excellente malgre tout et Le serveur tres aimable."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but the bartender is an asshole. we ordered take out and he made a big fuss about not getting a tip -- for what, walking over my food? Dude, a tip is for good service, he wasn't even that good at getting our food out, it was freshly cooked but cold when we opened it 5 minutes later."}
{"text":"Une bonne Poutine avec des frittes minces, molles et à la fois croustillantes, une généreuse portions de délicieux fromage et l'unique sauce du Mange-moi m'aura fait tomber en amour avec ce petit resto très sympa! Je vous le conseille fortement!"}
{"text":"We went out of curiosity and to sum up in one phrase; we'd love a refund so we could run to pharmacy next door for a \"turbo sized\" bottle of Pepto Bismal which tasted a whole lot better than their grey colored \"hamburger\".  This goes to show you that most people will eat and pay for just about anything.  In closing, this was the worst hamburger experience, bar none.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"La poutine 1957 est bonne, mais pourrait avoir un peu plus de fromage. Mon 7-up diète était expiré depuis 6 mois, donc un goût horrible."}
{"text":"Le burger goûtait la bouffe d'avion (le Mont-Royal). Surement pré-cuit. Sa texture était weird, genre caoutchouc. Bacon pas assez cuit. Sauce BBQ sucrée/cheap. Il est arrivé en 5 minutes (mauvais signe). D'où les deux étoiles. Le service était bon par contre. La poutine était correcte, mais sans plus. Le fromage n'était pas assez frais. Il y a un gros choix de cocktails et la bière était bonne. Malgré tout, il y a tellement de meilleurs choix de restos de poutines-burgers à Montréal. Celui-ci fait un peu attrape-touriste."}
{"text":"Themessed up my to go order which really sucked but what can you do I guess it was cause they were busy.  The drinks are really good there, especially the bacon Bloody Caesar!!"}
{"text":"Poutine Texas, avec viande hachée. Manquais de fromage et de sauce. Trop d'oignon...  Mais bonne patate, belle ambiance et drink tres bon"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Toujours contente de m'y retrouver! La poutine est savoureuse et copieuse, les burgers.... Mmhh!! Trop bon!  Vraiment un endroit qui vaut le détour  Sout out a Maryse!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience dining at Mange Moi one warm Friday lunch hour in August and will definitely be back.  It was one of those experiences that was just great, and we left knowing we'll be back sometime.  The place is small. Think a slightly larger and more upscale/trendy Patati-Patata.  There's an L shaped bar, a few tables, and a few window counters.  There's a fully stocked bar (I'll have to return to sample a mason jar cocktail sometime), and a good selection of beers on tap (a combination of local and import).  The music was top 40, which normally I don't particularly care for, but somehow it worked.  The service is friendly.  It took awhile for us to get our orders, but I chalk it up to the place being so busy at lunch time.  It didn't really matter, we were happy to just hang out and drink our beers.  The food!  These were some awesome burgers.  We each had a burger, but no sides, and this was perfect for a nice lunch.  We left feeling satisfied, but not disgustingly full.  I had the lamb burger, and it was overly \"lamb-y\", and had a greek vibe going on.  So overall, none of the individual components scream \"AWESOME!\", but it all just worked so well together, and was exactly what we felt like at that moment.  This would make a great place to stop in for post work drinks and munchies."}
{"text":"Petit endroit sympa! Nous avons mangé sur la \"terrasses\" imrpovisée du restaurant... autrement dit, sur le trottoir quoi! Ce fut un soir pendant la vente trottoir de l'avenue Mont Royal. C'était assez drôle de manger parmis tous les passants qui déambulaient.  Le service fut top! En tout cas, je parle d'un serveur très sympathique et assez atypique (sans vouloir me forcer à faire une rime). On était bien servi tout en étant pas étouffé... Ok, la bouffe n'est pas ce qu'il y a de plus gastronomique et ce n'est pas non plus le concept, mais c'est très très sympa d'y aller entre ami. De plus le quartier est dynamique ce qui rajoute un cachet à l'ambiance. Très bonne petite soirée!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!! This place is all hype. On Christmas Eve, I called in advance and they confirmed they would be open till 4. We arrived at 3 and they decided to close early and wouldn't serve us!! Anyway, I wanted to try something new but I'll keep eating at Patati Patata."}
{"text":"Tried this place after being recommended it for their good burgers and poutines. I really like the rustic decor of Mange-Moi. The walls, floor, tables and bar have wood incorporated into the design. Very rustic-modern. I tried the burger with smoked meat on it and a poutine with ground beef. Both were delicious. The portion size is perfect. What I like the most about this place is that they serve both fries and salad with the burgers. I do think however that the menu is a bit on the expensive side for what you get, still really good food though! The drink menu seems way over priced. The reason I gave this place 3 stars was because during my visit I got REALLY bad service without going into much detail lol. I have heard that normally the service is pretty good though so maybe it was just a bad night for Mange-Moi. However, besides the bad service my friends and I really enjoyed coming here and will likely be back again soon!  I will do an updated review once I go back again on the service."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular and, in my opinion, overpriced for what it is. The lamb burger was high on the messiness and low on taste. The meat was quite tough, almost rubbery. Overall very bland; I ended up calling garlic mayo to the rescue. Good Ceasar salad. I was not particularly impressed by the poutine but the fries were excellent (probably freshly cut). Beer selection, meh - at least the St-Ambroise IPA was on tap. Total paid after tax and tip, $32.  It just doesn't appeal to neither my burger or beer tastes."}
{"text":"My first time visiting Montreal and I had to have some Montreal poutine.  I'm glad I came here!  The restaurant is small but the poutine was fantastic!  The fries were a perfect golden brown and the cheese and gravy were velvety smooth.  The menu is also pretty big so there are a variety of poutine to choose from.  The staff was friendly and the service was quick.  I'm so glad I stopped in for lunch!  Quality food and great service!"}
{"text":"Thanks to uber eats I discovered this Place. The name stood out to me so clearly I clicked menu to investigate, it was your typical greasy spoon but looked like good quality vs a random burger joint on the corner. The food was good for what it cost, the poutine came with lots of curd cheese and the hot dog came with a well toasted home made bun with loads of creamy coleslaw. Hamburger was good but came with no toppings, not sure why but I'm guessing u have to check off what you want on it vs just clicking add to cart. Will keep that in mind for next time.  Hotdog was $5  Poutine was $7 Burger salad frie $13  The fries tasted as if the oil needed to be changed but other then that it was good and I would recommend this place for a lazy weekend meal or hangover meal."}
{"text":"great ambiance and excellent service, the food was abundant and delicious, great menu, would return there and try the bar as well. please open a restaurant in vancouver and show how it should be for the food and cost."}
{"text":"Pleased and surprised. It's a small place, the vibe is cool, the service is fairly attentive, and the food was awesome. I don't see any reason not to go. Prices are reasonable so stop in for lunch, dinner, or a mid day weekend break. You shouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Right off the bat I can say that if you're looking for drinks and poutine this is probably a good start. The menu has 10+ different types of poutine bowls you can get spicy, cheesy, meaty, onions, salsa and more. Unfortunately with my short visit it wasn't even the best poutine I had - the\" La Petit Dejeuner\" which had ham, bacon and beef but it was so so bland, even dowsing it in tobasco sauce barely have it any flavor. I went to a food truck festival a couple days prior and got poutine similar to this one and it was way better. So that felt like a rip off. The other problem was the waitress was extremely busy she not only took our orders, but brought out food, water and did the same for like 4 other tables. She was hard to get a hold of if we needed anything and when we did it took long because again she was the only one there. Where was the help? If you're looking to get full fast and have some beers I'd say come here, still you could probably do better."}
{"text":"Poutine Week? Oui, Poutine Week.  Premier constat: c'est petit!  Deuxième constat: c'est bruyant!  Mais c'était bon bon bon. Les cocktails sont excellents et pas mal moins chers qu'à d'autres endroits où l'on sert des cocktails en pot mason (cela dit, je me sentais pas mal plus en contrôle de mes gestes qu'à d'autres occasions où j'ai bu un cocktail en pot mason = moins d'alcool?).  Bonne poutine, pas assez exceptionnelle pour être au menu de la Poutine Week à mon avis, mais tout de même, ça bouche un coin, ça crée des sourires et quelques ballonnements. Pour deux poutines, 2lbs d'ailes de poulet et un burger (pas tout ça pour moi, merci), je m'en suis sortie avec 55$, pourboire non-inclus. Un peu trop cher à mon goût, particulièrement pour les ailes de poulet, mais c'était un repas très satisfaisant et le service était vraiment champion. J'y retournerai pour une poutine si je repasse dans le coin, sans la folie de la Poutine Week."}
{"text":"Aussi bien pour les burgers que pour les poutines vous ne serez pas décu. Les poutines sont mes préférées, il y en a pour tous les gouts. Le service est super et l'ambiance est vraiment au top. On se sent vraiment bien dans ce restaurant et je le recommande à toutes les personnes voulant manger une bonne poutine. La cochonne au porc effiloché est juste folle :)"}
{"text":"The poutine here was so amazing!!!!!! If you are looking for a great spot for some great poutine, you have to come here!!! The staff was very friendly and the beer was great as well. Oh another thing I didn't have to wait it line there was fast service"}
{"text":"Food: 4.5/5 Service: 3.5/5 Location: 4/5 Mange-moi is a renowned Montreal poutinerie in Mount Royal. I came here for a late night dinner and drinks with friends on Friday night and I instantly fell in love with the vibe of the place, not to mention the food. It has the typical Montreal hipster vibe, varnished wood slabs for the tables, weathered wooden wall paneling, and menus written up on giant chalkboards hung on the walls. The patio was packed with patrons, but thankfully we only had to wait a couple minutes for a table.  I ordered a classic chien-chaud (haha hot dog en Francais), only $5, and I was very impressed. It came, not in a traditional hot dog bun, but wedged inside a thick slice of French bread toasted to golden-brown perfection. As one of the cheapest items on the menu, I wasn't expecting something this good. Besides the traditional ketchup/mustard/relish trio of condiments, the hotdog was topped with fresh coleslaw, a crunchy touch that paired surprisingly well. We also ordered a couple pitchers of red wine sangria that was so fruity and divine. Cocktails are sipped from mason jars (a hipster staple) and fries are served in tiny deep fryer wire baskets (I can never resist a mini version of anything). I was able to sneak a couple bites of my friends' dishes (as you do) and the food was consistently tasty. The sweet potato fries and beautifully crisp, the poutine had the squeakiest cheese curds, hot wings with just the right amount of kick.   Overall I loved this place and would definitely recommend it for a fun lunch or dinner with friends. Don't expect to eat anything healthy, this is the place to indulge."}
{"text":"Very tasty poutine. Great cocktails. Good portions too. Loved it There are a lot of poutine choices in the city (and some even better ones off the island). We've been here several times and it's always been tasty. Lots of variety and all the ones we've tried were really good. Great little patio for the summer, good place to enjoy their mason jar cocktails!"}
{"text":"Beau décord. Belle ambiance. Que dire du burger! Un délice!! Et bien sur,excellante sauce poutine. Service chaleureux. Un must a découvrir!"}
{"text":"J'ai eu l'occasion de prendre une poutine à emporter avant d'aller bosser chez une collegues. Je ne peux donc pas trop parler de l'ambiance de l'endroit car il y avait peu de monde. En tout cas la poutine était bonne et copieuse pour un prix dans les 15dollars.  A tester dans d'autre condition car l'endroit est sympa et bien situé."}
{"text":"Delicious lamb poutine! Great service, quick, and generous portions. Lovely terrace. Mason jar drinks looked awesome, will have to try on my next visit, because I'll definitely be back! Great stop after a day on the mountain."}
{"text":"Really pleased. The poutine was super tasty (and huge), the hot dogs were amazing (and huge) and the Mason drinks were to die for (and huge). Everything is so inexpensive compared to some other places. Not to mention the staff ... They were just as wonderful and pleasant. You gotta try the place of you haven't already."}
{"text":"We were looking for food and drinks in the Plateau Saturday night when it was freezing and it just wasn't working out. Either places weren't serving food any longer, or they were too restaurant-y or too clublike. We wanted something kind of in the middle that was also somewhere we hadn't been before.  After trodding around for about 45min in the snow starving. We found this place at about midnight. It was warm, cozy, the server was very friendly. The menu had a lot of options. We got burgers and salads and ordered a bunch of drinks. We ended up staying for about 1.5hrs and had a really nice time. The owner and waiter were super nice too. My gf's salad had bacon in it, and she's a vegetarian and didn't notice that on the menu, the server said no problem, and the owner came out and made a whole new one with no bacon himself. No extra charge.   Overall a really nice unexpected experience. I would definitely return. However it's not the kind of place I would actively cross town for though because it isn't the kind of place you would want to hang out all night. But for an hour or drinks and food, its great."}
{"text":"Nice little place to grab a delicious burger and poutine. Reasonable price, great quick service. Decor inside needs a change though. Still I enjoyed my experience.  They're poutines are the real gem of this place I am told, going to have to go back and give it a try!"}
{"text":"J'adore! Les plats! La musique! Les drinks! Le service aussi est très bon! Seul hic: c'est trop petit comme endroit! Mon fast-food spot!"}
{"text":"We hit up Mange Moi for lunch today. It's a super easy go-to in the plateau for a quick lunch or dinner with great options for mason jar drinks. We ordered a pulled pork sandwich and the American burger with salad and fries. Their menu also offers a long list of poutines and hot dogs. The vibes at Mange Moi are very comfortable and laid-back - Perfect for an anytime meal or late night take-out / delivery. The food strikes that balance between being comfort food and not being too greasy. Although we didn't order onion rings, sweet potato fries or milkshakes this time, I have had them all before and are excellent choices. The staff is always really friendly and manage the space well. Top-notch for burgers and poutines!"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, I had one of the most amazing burger at this spot for the Burger week Event in Montreal and it wasn't even on the menu. VIP. Beef pattie, poutine AND pulled pork between two buns. Probably my cheat quota for the month, but how delicious.   Well meat and dirtyness aren't the only highlights here. Vegetarian burgers and salads are also available. I've tried the balsamic aragula and it was awesome, (more than) big enough and fresh.   To push it a bit further, I've also had a few bites of the Ferrero Rocher. Simply to die for.   The staff is very cool and efficient. Plus kitchen is open until 11:30PM. Been there twice and will def go back. Amen."}
{"text":"Okay, I finally got the poutine and it was pretty good. I was just hangry on the last review. Sorry Mange-Moi, I love you again."}
{"text":"I like, I adore, I will come back. Maybe often. Because when the food is well made, the service is impeccable and the ambiance is top, there is no reason not to!   Mange-moi is an elegant poutinerie and one of those \"fancy-looking\" burger places that have been popping up around town recently. The decor is rustic modern, perhaps a little bit too \"right now\" and might go out of style in the future, but in any case it works, it's comfortable and fits the neighbourhood like a glove. It's small, with only about 5 x 2-person tables inside plus 10-15 single bar chairs around - perfect if you feel like rocking in solo.   The burger and poutine menus offer a nice, classic variety. My choice was their \"Mont-Royal\" burger which is a beef burger with smoked bacon, caramelized onions, barbecue sauce, Boston lettuce and tomato. It was pure goodness, which I think owed a lot to the sweet burger buns that held everything together. The fries and the caesar salad were excellent as well, and of generous proportions. My husband and I shared the fries and the salad that came with my burger (he ordered only the burger), and it was more than enough. The alcoholic drinks menu is interesting too, though the cocktails at $12 a pop were beyond my dinner budget, so I didn't order any.   Having said all those good things, my biggest compliments actually go to either the service or the music. It's a very tight race. We were served by one of the nicest, most competent servers I have ever encountered in a burger place. Aside from being very friendly, he topped up our glasses of water as often as needed (the glass was tiny) without us having to ask.  As for the music, when I was there that evening, they were playing an international remix of 80's dance/pop; there was never a dull moment, at least for me! It was so good I asked the server if they were playing their homemade CD because if it was, I would love to buy it. Sadly no, he said that it was from a satellite radio.   Hands-down, best burger place in the Plateau Mont-Royal. Next time I will try their poutine!"}
{"text":"Un repas au Mange-Moi, c'est toujours correct, mais c'est facile à substituer par une meilleure option sur l'avenue (lire ici: le Dirty Dogs).   Je n'aime pas leur terrasse, j'y ai constamment l'impression qu'une voiture va emboutir le contour en bois pour venir me frapper. Je n'aime pas non plus les options de tables à l'intérieur, c'est trop petit et j'y ai chaud, ce qui me coupe l'appétit.   Savez-vous quoi? J'en jasais avec mon amie en mangeant et on s'ennuyait de la poutine de Chez Lemaire, celle qui a vraisemblablement mit la barre trop haute pour toutes les autres ensuite. C'est presque injuste. J'aimerais donc souligner qu'à leur défense, au Mange-Moi, les frites sont très bonnes. Le cocktail que je prends toujours pour accompagner mon repas s'appelle le \"Rubber Chicken\". Pas de mixologie fancy ici, mais il est vraiment bon, il est énorme (pot Masson) et il est rafraîchissant (un essentiel lorsqu'on mange du sel/gras). Les serveuses sont ben ben fines aussi, même quand on doit leur commander \"une chienne\" ou \"une cochonne\", haha!  À ma dernière visite, la sauce à poutine n'était pas suffisamment chaude, alors elle n'a pas fait fondre mon fromage et elle a refigé avant que je termine mon assiette, c'était une texture un peu dégueulasse. Oups!"}
{"text":"Great place. Recommended by a local friend when my parents and I came to visit. We went two days in a row! The poutine is huge and amazing. Really fresh ingredients and great flavors. The second day I tried a hot dog and my folks the burgers. Great decor, nice staff and fair prices. Awesome spot all around!"}
{"text":"Really friendly service and there are things on the menu for vegetarians, I had the portobello mushroom burger and it was quite tasty. The fries are nothing to write home about but the beer selection is decent. The outdoor seating was a bonus and they allowed my dog to join me which was a really nice touch."}
{"text":"This place could be so much better. The fries are a bit soggy and not crispy and the inside of the fries seemed undercooked. Service is average and and the burgers are ok. There are way better hamburger places in the city and this one is just mediocre. Even the poutine fails to surprise"}
