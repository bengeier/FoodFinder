{"text":"I've only been here a couple times just because the atmosphere is kind of dark and musty. I wish they would use paper cups instead of styrofoam. Styrofoam really cheapens the whole thing. The coffee wasn't bad but nothing really special either."}
{"text":"Civs coffee shop. If you're going to go, do yourself a favor and get a croissant, any croissant. I love them all, but especially the ham and cheese. Only complaint is the coffee always seems to lacks flavor. It's definitely more akin to diner coffee than coffee shop coffee. But I gotta end on a positive note and say that this place is a real gem, and one of my favs around."}
{"text":"Civilization is a cute neighborhood coffee bar with some quick food options. If you're in the area, it's definitely worth stopping by to see this unique pharmacy-turned-cafe. Though a big part of what they sell is coffee, I can't say that I'm a fan. I usually find my brew to be a bit weak and watery. Their pastries, however, are very good and also reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Civilization is a nice neighborhood joint for lazy Sundays.  It also serves the distinct purpose of somewhere to continue hanging out when you have to give up your table at Lucky's to make way for the hordes in line.

The inside is dark and cozy, which is lovely in winter.  But in summer I suspect you'll want to sit outside.  Seating is cramped, but it isn't too hard to find open seats.  Had a latte and red velvet cake, both of which were delicious.  I liked watching everyone reading the Sunday paper and I imagine a lot of local Tremonsters who know each other hang out there.

I'm an admitted Starbucks addict, but once in awhile, it is nice to go places like this with character.  Time just seemed to melt away as we sipped our coffees."}
{"text":"I love this quaint and comfy coffee shop so much I was hesitant to spread the word for fear I would never be able to find a seat again! I'm not a coffee snob by any means, but I know what I like, and you can count of Civilization for a solid (and strong) cup of joe for a reasonable price.  Typically I visit just for the coffee, but the make your own sandwich option, bagel choices, and fresh croissants are a perk. I will often find a seat in the shop for a few hours while completing work because of the ambience and pleasant patrons. Parking is never an issue, which is the cherry on top."}
{"text":"I'm a long time customer and I am appalled  by the way they treated me during my most recent visit. I ordered a cappuccino and even tipped the barista.  I went outside and sat at one of the tables and begin to drink my coffee and eat a cupcake I brought with me. The Batista came outside and very rudely told me if I didn't buy it here I can't eat and to leave. I will be taking my business elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"The only reason this place is still open is because there's no Starbucks or Phoenix Coffee in Tremont. I'll add my voice to the issues already raised by other Yelpers:

- Cash only. C'mon, it's almost 2014 and you don't take credit/debit cards? My pot dealer accepts credit/debit for goodness sake! (not really - I wish).

- Surly 'baristas'. It's not like these people are crafting Mocha Valencias IN Valencia, they're human Keurigs making $9.25 an hour to serve auto-drip coffee to cops and mostly blue-collar workers. The least they could do is smile, or promptly take my order, or act like it's their job to steam my milk and not a personal favor. Good grief.

- VERY mediocre coffee. You want good coffee in Tremont? - try Loop just up the road, you'll pay twice as much but the coffee will be 25% better. Civilization's mochas taste like they're made with powdered hot chocolate mix.

Pity that this place isn't better, as the space is gorgeous. I guess if I have to contend with surly baristas and pay with cash (despite hardly ever carrying it) only to receive mediocre coffee, the saving grace is that it's cheap. Life's too short to drink bad coffee, though."}
{"text":"I stop in here a few times a week for coffee to go.  First of all, it's DELICIOUS and second if you bring in your own travel mug it's only $1!  

The location and atmosphere are both very cool and the staff is friendly in their own way.  Never rude but not overly warm and friendly either.  Some mornings I'll come in to do some work and they leave me alone, which is fine by me.  

At first I felt guilty for only paying $1 for my coffee, so I'd leave another dollar in the tip jar ($2 for an excellent cup of coffee seemed fair).  But I've never heard a \"thank you\" for the tip.  Not once.  So I stopped tipping and learned to live with a truly great cup of coffee for which I only paid a buck.

I've had a few of their other coffee drinks which are expertly made and the pastries and cookies are insanely good.  

So GREAT coffee and treats, VERY well priced, free wi-fi and they don't seem to care about tips.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"I go out of my way to get their mocha - it's the best blend of cinnamon and chocolate. Just perfect. 
Delicious croissants and pastries, as well as sandwiches and soups. 
Great spot for a lunch meeting with friends or for business. 
Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great!  Civilization is close and convenient.  

Cute little coffee shops like this are rare these days. The food (desserts, lunch croissants, and (especially) chili) are delicious.  Coffee isn't bad, either.  The mocha here is made with Mexican chocolate and is probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I used to get coffee here every morning back when I lived in the neighborhood, morning started after 1pm, and making coffee was still like learning how to cook, for me. I like this place so much. It's adorable and cozy, and the cafe au laits are pretty darn good. Unfortunately I can't say the same for the iced coffees. I remember them tasting like regular drip coffee on ice instead of espresso, so as soon as the ice started melting it was coffee water. This was a few years ago so perhaps the problem has been remedied."}
{"text":"Great little corner coffee shop that I just ran into one day! I love stopping by before heading to CSU for class. The coffee is premium and at a great price. I like that there are always people. It has a warm, comfy feel with old style Tremont taste!"}
{"text":"Civilization could give two shits about this review. Does not do twitter, FB, Instagram, tinder, Etc.  Just started taking credit cards in June of gosh darn 2014. I love them. They have a million dollar location on the corner of Lincoln Park and treat you like your $1.95 cup of coffee is the difference between them staying in business or not. The owner is there every morning smiling and hand washing the counters. There is the same lovable man sweeping the patio the same way at 7am every day 365 days a year. If Norman Rockwell showed up to paint a picture he would ask them to \"tone it down\" with the Americana. This might be the best coffee shop in Ohio."}
{"text":"I love hanging out with my cool townie friends and perfecting satirical retorts,  and while sipping a cup of joe? Who could ask for more.....  I been frequenting Civ since the Cravings days of years ago when one could rent a two bedroom pad for less than four bucks.  Times have changed in the neighborhood but Civ has remained relatively unscathed.  Homey atmosphere, hot and cold drinks, lunch time eats, and townies that can give little moments of Tremont history in passing conversation."}
{"text":"Owner is an awful miserable cow, her staff reflect it with poor service, worse dispositions, and attitude. Crawling with cops all day long on the free goodies beat. Hard to ruin a nice location with great architecture, but boy they sure have done it."}
{"text":"Do not go there when the owner,  an old lady with yellow hair,  is there.  Very abrasive and not very friendly at all.  And you're the customer?   Can tell the help is on edge when she is there."}
{"text":"the atmosphere is great.  nice people, not too crowded, and one of my favorite parts of this city.
the mocha i had there tasted like the mochas i used to get from the local coffeehouse in high school that has since closed.  not too bitter, but the perfect blend of sweet and strong.
..and the cookie bigger than my head didn't hurt either."}
{"text":"I first discovered Civilization while exploring Cleveland to look for an apartment.  This place was (in part) my reason for living in Tremont.

I would love to say that this place has a \"no-airs\" feel, but that's not entirely true.  It is, however, a place that TRIES to make their customers feel as though they are in a place with no airs.  If that makes any sense. 

The coffee is really good, although I'm a bit peeved that they never refill their flavor syrups (yes, I admit, I'm pretty much singlehandedly responsible for using up all of their almond flavor syrup).  They suggested Amaretto to me, and then, I used that one up too.  Now I'm on Vanilla.  Hopefully they won't run out, because they still haven't refilled the other ones.

I like to come here and study or read, although at times, loud-talkers make that harder. 

The thing that makes this review 4 stars instead of 3 is their selection of mouth-watering scones.  I love a good scone, and Civilization does it the way I prefer: a bit flaky and dense, not at all too sweet and \"dessert\" like (like the ones at Lucky's), but more of a mid-morning or late afternoon treat...and it goes great with the coffee."}
{"text":"Civilization is warm, cute, and charming in a kind of catankerous way. It used to be an apothecary, and all the little drawers are still behind the old timey counter. It has a welcoming old world ambiance and stays comfortingly the same over time. They have a great selection of drinks (malted mocha anyone?) with options like almond milk for people who need it. Their prices are way too low (but shh, don't tell them :)) - a fancy latte is only $2.50 and I think the max price is around $3.95. The process at the register is slow and they make drinks painstakingly, so lines can go for a while and it may take 5 minutes to get your drink and pay once you're at the front of the line. Employees are mostly friendly. Their to go cups are way larger than the teensy mugs (8-10oz by my guess) for drinks you buy in the store, so even if you're going to stay, you'll probably want to order \"to go\". The shop is right on the park and next to the yoga studio, so perfect for a walk."}
{"text":"Love their indoor and outdoor seating. Never have had a bad drink. Have had an amazing lemonade with ginger tea that was worth trying. Bakery available as well as sandwiches, but I've never tried. The parking is on the streets and can sometimes not be super close since it's across the park. Worth heading to for a caffeine fix or a place to just hang out at for a while."}
{"text":"Cool place, where you can actually just read your book while sipping your coffee. Which reminds me: great cappuccino. 

If the weather's good, you can sit outside and stare at the park until everything turns green. Or at the LEMKA building which is exquisite, architecturally speaking.

Cool, down-to-earth crowd."}
{"text":"Coconut milk, almond milk, soy milk oh my.

Finally!  Yippee for coconut milk for this Paleo nerd."}
{"text":"Scroll down to the bottom for the review if you don't care about my story.

Unfortunately, some larger old lady with a bowl-cut was there the other day with her weirdo bearded husband. Evidently, these folks had never been in a coffee shop. As the line slowly grew, she asked about all the food options in the case. I guess the croissants were pretty confusing for her. Anyway, the employee was very patient with her.

She walks over to examine the food for a few minutes. So the next person assumes its her turn and orders, and she doesn't disappoint. Lucille asks how much a shot of espresso is. Then asks how much 5 shots are. What the hell!  

The guy is so patient with these people. Meanwhile the woman waiting behind me puts her kid down because her arm is falling off because the oldies are turning ordering coffee into a broadway production.

So espresso-shots lady gets her order, then starts pulling coins out of her purse for exact change. Awesome. Just as she's finished, indecisive-food lady hops back over in line. ALL I WANT IS A FRIGGIN ICED TEA! The guy asks for the next person, and she looks at me like she's clueless as to who's turn it is. I'm thinking, \"You've been in here for ten minutes and don't know who's turn it is, and you have a bowl cut.\" So just as I'm about to order an iced tea, she begins her order. Sigh.

This has nothing to do with the coffee shop service, by the way. It's just amazing how stupid and inconsiderate some people are.  

So I finally get to order, one iced tea. I get it, pay for it. Then I move down to add some sugar. Well, bowl-cut's weirdo bearded husband is down there blocking everything with his stupid coffees. He waits for me to reach for the honey before moving his cups. I get my lid and head for the door. I'm done, right? Aaah nope. Bowl-cut is standing in the doorway, on the outside, with her foot in the door. I stand there for a few seconds wondering if she's going to open the door for me or move out of the way. Neither. She looks directly at me, and doesn't do anything. I start opening the door. She still doesn't move! She says, \"Harold!\" or whatever his name was, \"Come over here!\"  

So I then pull the door all the way open, say \"excuse me, please,\" and squeeze by her to freedom. I feel bad for her husband.

Love the coffee here."}
{"text":"Wonderful, cute coffee shop in hip area! The staff are all very friendly & nice. Good selection of drinks including soy, almond & coconut milk. Their coffee drinks are consistently good. Also nice selection of baked goods but in my experience have been hit or miss. The muffins are very good. Scones are a bit on the dry side. Don't recommend the apple bar either- was very plain & bland. I had the breakfast egg & cheese sandwich which was sub par also. Definitely recommend the coffee- not the biggest fan of their food!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop on the near west side.  They have the best shortbread cookies you'll ever have.  They also have other great sweets like Apple and Lemon bars 

Coffee and teas are excellent.  Great place to relax,  study and/or just spend a Sat morning at."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. The hours on Yelp are incorrect though. Came here on a friday and they're only open until 8:30"}
{"text":"Eh. I was so excited to get a great coffee, but this was a total let down. Double espresso was four ounces. I'm sure the giant muffins and bagels were good, but it's a coffee shop! Have good coffee for christ's sake! 

Admittedly the decor was super cool."}
{"text":"Adorable (but crowded) weekend spot.  Great location right on Lincoln Park - perfect for stopping in for some coffee, before relaxing in the park.  I haven't tried their food, but the fact that they make mochas with Mexican hot chocolate? Totally gives them an A in my book."}
{"text":"Don't like civilization.. pit stain of Lincoln park, Friends meets Urban Outfitters in a pool of vomit and gentrified gasoline drip. what is difference between Starbucks and Civilization? i'm not sure yet I find a headache when i think for questions for any amount of time. I am going to spill my cofffee on the molding culture of Tremont. People who find resilient boutique gallery culture in this neighborhood are retarded. happy holidays with a bouquet of pointsettias and big rubber ds"}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out, but seemed a little too disorganized inside for me-- at least when we visited in the afternoon? Maybe in the evening it would be better.

Outside seating is limited but suited our mood (and dog)."}
{"text":"Recently came here for lunch and got the panini. You get to choose from a decent selection of toppings and it ended up tasting great! My only complaint would be that the side included was some stale, round tortilla chips... Not worth it in my opinion. 

The staff was nice. There's a limited amount of room inside so we took our orders to go. Overall it's a nice local cafe."}
{"text":"I really, really enjoyed Civilization! They call themselves a coffeeshop \"in the tradition of a European cafe\" in Tremont.

The food is definitely a highlight! I had a croissant (only $1!) that was fresh, flaky and buttery. Mmm. The small coffees are only $1, and I had a great green tea for $1.50. 

For lunch, I had a turkey panini with veggies and hummus for $5.95. (It came with a small side of nacho chips? That was weird.) Next time, I'm definitely going to try the croissant with broccoli ($2.50)!!

The decor is amazing! I love the dark wood \"benches\" against the wall, and the beautiful tables. I really enjoyed watching the interesting characters that came in and out, including some of Cleveland's finest hipsters. :)

The staff was also friendly. Free wifi, and they accept credit. Yay!

I will definitely be back, for work, to read, to hang out with some friends for a few hours... Hooray!"}
{"text":"My coffee place of choice.  Fast, pleasant, attentive service in an old general store at a super price.  Who wouldn't like being served great coffee in an old general store?  I love you, Civilization and Professor Colonel Sanders (the white bearded regular I see there every day) too."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, and love this place. As such, I've learned to deal with the fact that they stop serving sandwiches around 2pm every day. I'll either order before I am ready to eat and eat it a half hour later, or I'll call in the order ahead of time if I'm coming in right around 2.

Here I am today, on a nice Sunday afternoon - 1:29 to be precise. The place is packed and we had a difficult time finding a seat - having to share the edge if a table with kind strangers. 

As I ordered my drink, I told the girl I would come back up when the line died down to order food - the reason being, I wanted to make it easy on her and the other girl working to take care of folks behind me in the long line. She said ok. 

So, at 2:10, the line was gone and I went back to the counter to order my sammich. Only, the same girl says, \"Sorry. We stop serving sandwiches at 2. You can have soup.\" 

Now, on a normal day, the workers here are all usually cool with wrapping up the sandwiches around 2, but also being cool with people to not have some strict absolute cut off. Further, the only reason I didn't order before 2 was because I could see they were swamped and wanted to let them take care of the big line. 

I had never seen either if the girls working today before. I absolutely like the other people I've seen working here for years - this place survives on the cool, neighborhood vibe and they really make it nice. 

These two trolls working today completely ruined my opinion of this place. Basically, it was 2:10 when I asked for the sandwich.  The grill was still going, the food was all still out and ready to make the sandwich. Instead, I'm sitting here starving, watching the two girls who refused to make my sandwich talking. Yes, they couldn't make me lunch, but boy can they talk. And talk. No customers at the counter, all the stuff to make sandwiches still out and sitting there, and they are just gabbing and gabbing and gabbing. 

This is rude and wrong, and has completely ruined any chances for me returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! The old school bar that is still in the building and tin ceiling was neat. The Choco Malt Espress and chocolate cheesecake were perfect on a cold, rainy night."}
{"text":"Happened upon this little coffee shop while waiting for the Tremont Tap House to open up for Sunday brunch...originally we were going to head over and grab a coffee at Lucky's but we checked Yelp for something else in the area that would probably have a shorter line at the counter.  Well, bless my lucky stars, I've finally found a place that can make a good hot chocolate in Cleveland!  I'm not a huge coffee drinker so I usually wind up with tea, chai or hot chocolate in \"Coffee Houses\".  This place has four different kinds of hot chocolate to choose from and I wound up going with the Mexican spiced variety....great balance of spicy and sweet.  When I don't feel like making it at home, I'll be heading over here for my chocolatey fix!"}
{"text":"Great little non-chain coffee shop in the heart of Tremont.

This is what coffee shops should be... lots of cozy dark wood, killer coffee and melt-in-your-mouth pastries. Oh, the pastries...not sure where they get them, but they are the BOMB.

Super nice staff and outdoor seating seal the deal!"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee and mouth-watering napoleon-- not to mention cheap! I only wish they were in St. Louis. :)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is relaxing, the coffee and tea are delicious and the prices are incredible. The service is pretty poor and I can echo the other comments about the sandwiches being cut off at an unreasonably early hour. Some times, they run out of the ingredients to make the sandwiches before noon on Saturday.

Don't let the sign about credit cards not working fool you. This place doesn't take credit cards.

The free WiFi works about 10% of the time, possibly less. If you need to get something done, don't chance it here.

In short, if you want a cup of coffee or tea and no frills and you brought cash, this is your place. If you're expecting anything else (like a sandwich or the internet) commonly associated with a coffee shop, keep going."}
{"text":"I worked in Tremont for 4 weeks, and this cute little coffee shop became a part of my morning ritual from day 1. To truly appreciate Civilization:

-Embrace the hipster atmosphere
-Bring cash, not credit (though, they have an ATM. And if you can't use that, they'll write down your name and you'll pay next time. Pretty cool)
-Try the shortbread cookies (!!!)
-Notice the sizes (the small is very small. Not necessarily a bad thing!)
-Love the prices!

If I lived here, I think I'd be at Civilization ALL the time. It has a great community-centric atmosphere, delicious coffee, free WiFi, free nearby street parking, and doesn't break the bank. The staff have been nothing but friendly. I'm really going to miss it. So check it out if you get a chance! :)"}
{"text":"Civilization still doesn't really make great coffee. It's good, but not great. The reason I come back sometimes is that the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Tried a single mocha and it was awesome. Really flavorful, not overly sweet. Warm and perfect on a rainy day"}
{"text":"Civilizations in Tremont is a cute spot for a causal date or just enjoying your surroundings. This coffee shop is located in the main part of Tremont and is walkable to any restaurant or park nearby. Lots of free street parking 7 days a week and reasonably priced coffee!"}
{"text":"Decent coffee shop set in an old pharmacy. The space is really historic, though quite dark, so maybe not ideal for working. There are some tables and chairs outside where people were enjoying coffee with their dogs. I had a scone and it was awful, dry and poor in flavor. My husband's muffin wasn't much better. The coffee was alright, nothing better than I would make at home. So while I'm glad I tried it, I likely won't return. It's worth a visit for the ambiance and coffee if nothing else."}
{"text":"An interesting and cozy little coffee shop and bakery in the heart of Tremont. They serve sandwiches and wraps, salads and lots of baked goods. They have many varieties of coffee drinks and can make just about anything to order. I ordered a tuna wrap which was delicious served with a side of nacho chips and a pumpkin latte which was delicious. Priced right too. Lunch is under 10 bucks. Perfect neighborhood spot if your in the area for a festival or art show or a great Saturday neighborhood stop. Civilization is a great addition to the Tremont neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite coffee shop on my way to work. There is always plenty of street parking. The staff is helpful and friendly. The atmosphere is vintage, cute, and cozy. The coffee is delicious as are their pastries. Prices are great as well. Seems like a very neighborhood forward place for people to meet and congregate but service is always fast."}
{"text":"$2 for an iced coffee. Price is right! Friendly staff. Plenty of street parking/easy access.  This place is awesome. On days that I can work remotely, this is my go-to spot."}
{"text":"Love stopping here for coffee and a quick bite to eat. The staff and clients are very friendly. The space is very warm and inviting. The drinks are inexpensive and delicious. I love stopping here on my way to work to start the morning off just right!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, good sandwiches, good snacks and sweets.  Definitely glad I skipped starbucks on my road trip today. :)"}
{"text":"Updates! 

They take credit now--no minimums, no B.S. I love everything about it.

My straight up, black coffee was smooth and delicious. I can hang with my pup outside, have a meeting, enjoy a breakfast sammie and soak in what's left of our non-snowy-frigid-tundra weather. 

Thanks for accepting cards now, Civilization! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place was a hassle payment wise since it is cash only but there was an ATM around the corner. I got the spinach croissant which wasn't bad but became a little too greasy. I know, I know, what do you expect--its a butter croissant, shouldn't it be buttery? This was a little too much for me though. Ambiance evokes 1920s speak easy with its dark wood furniture. I'd come here to get a cup of coffee and do some work but not necessarily come here for lunch."}
{"text":"I want to love Civilization. I really, really do. As a native of Cleveland who left for the Northeast for college, I'm always on the prowl for unique (okay fine, hipster) coffeeshops back home that aren't Peet's. 

Civilization is BEAUTIFUL. When I went, tinsel, evergreen branches, and snow hero sculptures canvassed all sides of this small, cozy flat. I love the original woodwork and the furniture to match, and yet, the staff does an amazing job of keeping the \"vintage\" look reserved for decor only. The pastry tray and machines all look as if they'd been installed and shined yesterday! The bathrooms are immaculate. 

The baristas there could tell it was my first time and were patient as I scanned the menu. I went during an off-peak hour, though, so best to know what you're getting so the line doesn't snake out the door. There's only so much standing room here! I was helped by two younger looking staff who seemed to be having a good time, but not too good of a time the way super hipster baristas sometimes evoke--the kind that turns into espresso-side gossip and a drink that takes 10 minutes to make. They know what they're doing.

I ordered a mocha - 2.50!! for a small - and the shortbread cookie. Both were decent. The mocha tasted a little flat for some reason. They add some flavoring to it that detracted from the decadent, how-is-this-coffee, chocolate-ly feeling I usually get on first sip. The cookie was perfectly buttery and tasted as fresh as could be.

So why only 3 stars? 

Well, I sensed a distinct \"squat\" culture here, which is great if it's brimming with students or professionals putting in some work after hours, or even if it's clearly friends catching up over many hours, but these squatters were card-playing, honestly pretty creepy men who just stared ruthlessly at every patron who entered the door. What's that all about? 

Also, as has been pointed out in other reviews....it's time to get one of those iPad credit card swipes. They'd save themselves the frustration of having to explain, and people would probably tip even MORE. Those apps can be programmed to take you directly to a tip page, after all.

And lastly, it did get pretty loud when I was in there, which detracts from the coziness and potential to be a study spot. 

But still, for hipster vibes in Cleveland, and a quality product to go with it? Minimal snobbery and fair, fair prices?

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, free WiFi, nice people - and great sandwiches (oh and other food options)!  Get your sandwich of choice on the croissant - They are wonderful.  Whether you want breakfast, lunch, or something for your sweet tooth, this place will satisfy.  

This place feels like you're hanging out in your friend's living room.  I don't feel awkward parking here for a few hours on a Sunday Afternoon - enjoy some beverages and put my feet up.  It's a great place to get lost in a book - or in my case, get lost reading gossip on the Internet.

I've just started making this a regular spot to visit, but will keep it on the list for quite a while."}
{"text":"A great coffee house and environment to meet a friend and just chat. I also like to plug-in to work here every once in a while. The place just has a great feel to it."}
{"text":"Love the old drug store wooden shelves. So cool inside! Not busy at all so I could study. & my cappuccino was as good as it gets (you forget when you go to so many mediocre chains)."}
{"text":"I've recently moved to the 'hood and have to say that I love being this close  to a great local shop that serves the community well!  I have found most of the staff to be great, I'm assuming the standout one is the owner from the interactions I've seen her had. 

Civilization is a great place to hangout, there are always interesting people coming and going.  

I've only had iced coffees and iced tea so far.. They have been great! Once it gets cooler I'll get more \"handcrafted\" drinks and I'll be sure to update then!"}
{"text":"what a cute coffee shop! this place is a bit small, but if i lived in tremont, i'd be here every weekend. Definitely come here and try the plain coffee-- the beans are great!!!!"}
{"text":"I like!

Gorgeous furniture, good deals on coffee, hot chocolate, and pastries!"}
{"text":"I've only gotten coffee at Civilization a few times. 

The coffee is great - I'll give them that. They make a good brew (both iced, and hot) and they know how to make espresso drinks. My main gripe with Civilization was the vibe the baristas gave off.

Each time I went, the barista was either a short brunette woman or a taller blond guy. Both took their time before acknowledging me, were very short with me, and generally unhelpful when I asked for recommendations. The time they close is also incorrect on Yelp!

**They do not take credit/debit cards**

The atmosphere of Civilizations is nice. It's quiet, it looks like they have a lot of good baked foods. There are a few weird vents under some of the tables, making it very chilly to sit in a few places, so be on the lookout for that. There are some nice chairs on the front patio"}
{"text":"Periodically get up to Cleveland, and this is the favorite place for an early Americano and a pastry.
A wonderful setting in what was a pharmacy.    It's You see a lot of the old woodwork remaining with huge store windows in front.  It's as if you're a turn of the 20th century dry goods store, but this serves coffee drinks.

Well made beverage and the pastries are a cut above without the precious $6 desserts.  Inviting service and customers all seem to know one another.  Sunday paper put out for anyone to read.  Tremont institution for good reason.  Local realtors can use this place and Lincoln Park across the street as big selling points for living here if all the trendy joints aren't enough."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood coffee shop. Welcoming atmosphere and delicious coffee. Rotating flavor coffee offered daily and beans available to take home."}
{"text":"My goodness!! Your coffee is spectacular!! I mean, I've had good coffee, but this was beyond good! CLE is definitely moving in up! 
I ordered the malt mocha and so did my husband. I believe he burned his mouth because he couldn't wait to let it cool off.
Really, if you're looking for a good cup of coffee. Check this place out.
Sure, you could go to the same coffee shop. But, why not try something different? 
The atmosphere was great and the service was awesome! 
I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This is one of favorite coffee places in the area! I have to say that I stick to the Cafe Mocha - it's my favorite after sampling a few drinks off of their menu. It's a cafe mocha made with Mexican chocolate. There's a bit of a spice and it's perfect. For someone who normally likes her drinks sweet, this drink isn't too sweet and yet somehow it's absolutely perfect that way. It's $3.50 for the smaller size and $4.50 for the larger size.

They have a large selection of bakery and food options - from salads to sandwiches to wraps. I've had a few things from their bakery selection and everything has been good thoough sometimes a bit too rich. I've yet to try anything off of their food menu but it's on my list!

The interior is wood paneled and cozy. The place is by no means large but it's also not small. They fit a surprising number of tables inside without making it feel too cluttered. One of the downsides of the size of this plac is that when they steam milk or grind coffee it's incredibly audible and loud because you're close to the bar. If you can ignore that as white noise, you're all set.

The numerous times I've been here I can't say they've ever played music. Either that or it was incredibly low and I didn't pick it up. If that's the case then I'm impressed because I pick everything and have a hard time ignoring that sort of sound. I love doing work here or just sitting back and writing down my thoughts.

I think one of the things I love most about this place, apart from the Cafe Mocha, is that it's what a coffee shop should be. I was here on a Saturday morning at 8 in the morning and there were several local men and women, of varying ages, drinking their coffee under the outdoor umbrellas and talking about their lives. It's a hub for locals to sit back and unwind. Even if you're there by yourself, whether you're inside or outside, you have ample opportunity to people watch. 

This is the type of place where you can sit back, take a deep whiff of your coffee and breathe as you watch the world move forward."}
{"text":"Love Civilization. Great little hub to get your Cup o' Joe, grab a little breafast item or sweet treat, or just hang out and relax. 

Coffee sizes are different here than other places. The \"small\" is in fact a small, not a starbucks large-coffee-chain supersized \"small.\" Some may see this as a negative, but I think it's a good thing. We need to right-size our portions! 

Coffee itself is good, and I have never had a bad one here yet. I used to stop in for a breakfast sandwich or croissant in the mornings when I was on the way to work, so it was convenient for me. 

They also have some delectable chocolate treats, one of which is the chocolate macaroon. YUM and oh my what a splurge that is. This coffee shop, unlike many others stands out to me because they serve some actual tasty food items. 

So, my recommendation? Go."}
{"text":"I'd like to comment about how nice the place looked however...
There are a lot of photos of this place on Yelp. The guy saw me with a camera and he was like, \"you are not allowed to take pictures here!!\". Five minutes later, a lady walked in, and the guy at the counter acted like a completely different person. There shouldn't be a 180 degree change from customer to customer..."}
{"text":"This is just a neat little neighborhood restaurant. Many, many years ago, it was a store for drugs and medicine (that is carved into the stone at the top of the building), and there are cues inside that indicate it's history. Inside is a little tight, but the interior is so interesting that I doubt you'll mind. Besides what you'd find at a corner coffee shop, they also offer made-to-order sandwiches that I found to be extremely fresh and very delicious. Service is quick and friendly and the food is satisfying. I recommend as a great alternative to the typical (and too often mundane) chain restaurants."}
{"text":"We stopped in at Lucky's down the street and, after being told that we should wait for table service to get our coffee and then waiting over 15 minutes for one of those service to even look at us, I gave the inevitable \"Fuck this\" call and we went off to one of the ridiculously many coffee shops in the tiny, enclosed Tremont area.
Civilization is well-placed and has a very cute interior. Stuck on the corner of a park, it's got a good location for foot traffic watching, and it's in an old house, which gives it a ton of character. Long bench against the wall with various tables, but definitely lacking on the plugs. The outside had several umbrella tables strewn about the sidewalk.
The wifi, on the other hand, was fantastically fast. It was called \"Attorney\" this or that, which was weird and made me feel like I was stealing from another business, possibly a poor old Tremont lawyer who allowed someone to talk him into getting a wireless router without really understanding what it was, and now can't understand why his \"high speed\" is so slow.
Coffee is cheaply priced but refills come at $0.75, which is high for Cleveland. Staff are nice and the place is friendly. They serve a small breakfast and lunch menu, prepared in-house, and have a delicious looking assortment of dessert items.
The crowd was light on a weekday afternoon. The staff knew most of the people coming in, which only made me feel better about the place. It got a little busier as it got later, but it still definitely was not full.
I don't really get the Civilization name either. Are they trying to say that their shop is a strip of civilization in an otherwise uncivilized hipster gentrification-fest of an area (don't get me wrong: I like Tremont, but let's be honest and straight about it)? That doesn't really match for me, but I'm sure they have their own ideas."}
{"text":"Coffee and food is good but I don't go here anymore since they don't take debit cards.  Seriously?  It's 2014!  Loop gets my business solely for this reason.  I'm one of those people that never carries cash."}
{"text":"Great local (read: not a bit corporate) coffee shop.  I'd really love to give it a 5, but... 

In my memory, this place was super cute and the coffee was delicious and I could have sat here forever. But...I drove like an hour to see two friends, so my positivity is possibly spilling over into my review.

So the coffee was great (cash only!). The place was really cute and decorated with a ton of small antique Christmas trees around.  The bar and tables and such were also cute, and there was the lamp from \"The Christmas Story\" in the window!!! (Its in the same neighborhood as where the movie was filmed.)  

It got a little weird towards the end.  When we got there the place was almost empty.  By the time we left, the tables were filling up, mostly with friends and family meeting up for Christmas (so cute!).  Just as we were leaving we asked the barista to take our photo....and he said no photos were allowed inside (???).  I had just taken a picture right in front of him, another girl was taking a photo, a mom took a picture of her kid.....?  Really?"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite coffee shop in Tremont. And to be honest, although I love coffee and pastry in a variety of places (The Root & Rising Star are my other two tops) - the COFFEE here? At Civ? is..THE BEST. I am in love.
And the fact that you can get a refill in your mug and a KILLER Raisin Oat Scone for $2.95? I mean...really? EPIC.

The building itself is unique. An old drug store, and the era shines through on the interior. With the dark thick wood work, and abundance of apothecary drawers, it is so warm and gorgeous inside.

Not a lot of seating, but that's ok. The seating that is there is made of age old wood that screams SLOW DOWN, have a cup. Read the paper (vs. your iThing) and have a great cup of joe! (and a scone)"}
{"text":"Civilization is a nice, quiet, and friendly coffee shop where you can grab a bit of food and get some reasonable coffee. The service is friendly and the few times I've been there, it has always been moderately busy with a few open tables. There is a reasonable selection of coffee accompaniments, but I must admit, I've never gotten any. 

The only reason I find it hard to rate this place better is the coffees I've had here is nice, but with the crazy number of coffee shops these days, I feel to justify an above average rating there needs to be something truly unique about the place. Without latte art, special flavors, and coffee that was good, but not incredible, I find Civilization to be a place that is a good place to meet friends local to the area or if you need a place to hole up for a bit. 

Bottom line, it's a decent coffee shop when you want to stay local and get some work done. However, for a special coffee treat, I'd recommend one of the others in Cleveland that might be slightly pricier and probably more crowded."}
{"text":"What a great place! For starters, Tremont coffee shops already have my heart because the parking is so easy. It's so refreshing in the city of Cleveland to just pull up and have a street spot.

Civilization reminds me of something out of Beauty in the Beast. The interior has a dark, wooden, rustic vibe to it. There are steampunk-ish lighting fixtures throughout, and the light is low. They have a mix of tables and chairs, including a cute patio, so there's no shortage of seating throughout. In the winter, this place will be my cozy winter coffee hot spot.

Civilization has a great coffee selection, including teas. Big props to the staff, too. Especially because I accidentally spilled a glass of water everywhere while co-working with a friend and they were really nice, non-judgy, and helped me clean it up. No unfriendly hipster vibes here. For me, the best part of Civilization is the quality internet, especially compared to the glacial internet speeds that many coffee shops often have. OH, and the air conditioning. Again, it bewilders me that in this humidity, Civilization is one of the only coffee shops that puts the air on. Looking forward to making this a staple, especially in fall/winter."}
{"text":"Fantastic little local coffee joint in Tremont! Stopped in for a cold brew with room for cream.

Cold brew was strong and delicious! Nice ambiance - old school feel with dark woods. Staff was friendly and nice! Free WiFi available - and indoor and outdoor seating!

#Civilization"}
{"text":"My favorite weekend coffee spot hands down. Great for posting up with a friend or just grabbing something on the go. Try their iced mocha! It's just sweet enough for the sweet lovers and bitter enough for the black coffee folk."}
{"text":"Good selection.  Right across from my house..  Always good people watching.  My daughter loves the little cookies.  Some of the staff acts like theyre too cool for school but most are super nice.... Can be a bit pricey...  Also, people drive crazy and park wherever they want around here...even the police.  BEWARE when crossing, especially with children."}
{"text":"Civilization, I love you. It doesn't hurt that you're a whopping 20 steps away from my front door & that your large iced coffee is a meager $1.85.

Civilization's coffee is pretty darn good, & they have a lot of drink options, plus soy & almond milk, & a bevy of great pastries, soups, & sandwiches to keep you fully satiated in the food department, too. I'm partial to their sundried tomato bagels.They've also got a nice outdoor patio that's often filled with crotchety but kind regulars & a lot of cute dogs, perfect for reading a book on a sunny summer day. Most importantly, its staffed by lovely, knowledgeable baristas who are just as kind to newbies as they are to the regulars (though if you come in often enough, they'll start to remember your order).

I'm forever singing Civilization's praises to anyone looking for a good local spot. It's definitely worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"first time here today. The environment is cute and cozzy. I got the pumpkin chai latte. It was great!"}
{"text":"really cute coffee shop with great sweets (the brownies are out of this world) and fun flavors for coffee and cocoa drinks (chocolate malt syrup!!).  a great four star experience.

the extra star, however, is for the service.  i was here for about 30min but left my purse with digital camera, phone, and wallet on my chair.  not only was my purse kindly returned to the barista, he went ahead and texted a friend of mine (the last one to have texted me) to let her know where i'd left my phone.  when i called the shop, they were about to close, but they kept my purse safe until mid-day the following day when i finally had the time to come reclaim it.  not a cent missing!"}
{"text":"Civilization has the best pastries of any cafe in Cleveland. I've been to all of them. Though the coffee isn't my favorite. The iced mocha is good and the scones. It will make you want to live longer just to enjoy it again."}
{"text":"if you're looking for a nice spot to sit with friends, do some work, have a meeting or a date. this is the place. great atmosphere with coffee, pastry and food. WIFI and plugs around you can bring your laptop or tablet and enjoy the day. there is also outside seating to enjoy the weather.

you won't be wowed by the coffee but it isn't bad. i ordered a cappuccino which was more milk than anything else. i'm not an expert on cappuccinos but i tend to judge the quality of it before even tasting it on whether or not there is a picture in my foam. there was no picture but it tasted not so bad.

their pastry and desserts are pretty good. giant slices of cake for just over $4 seems ridiculously amazing when compared to the $3 cupcakes sold these days. i also love their macaroon bar that is actually a bit too sweet but is perfectly balanced with a cup of coffee. they are a match made in heaven! Giant cookies also looked delish but didn't get a chance to try."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to sit down, read a book or work remotely. The staff is friendly and accommodating and the prices can't be beaten. I'm probably here 5 days of the week...sometimes more. 

Plus, the locals love to chat with anyone who walks by. You can usually join an interesting conversation. Oh yeah, and if you have a dog, they'll help hold it while you go inside and get a cup of coffee to go!"}
{"text":"Love the staff. Great soup and croissants.
Cool atmosphere and old ceilings.
They also have coconut milk for drinks!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting businesses in Tremont since high school before it was even trendy, so I suggested meeting some out of town friends for coffee at Civilization.  I remembered it being really cool because it's housed inside of an old pharmacy, so all of the drawers and the original counter are still intact.

My friend and i arrived earlier than our other friend and ordered drinks right away.  When I asked the barista for a recommendation, he told me that he didn't drink coffee, so he really couldn't offer a suggestion.  Weird, but ok...  Then we discovered they were cash only.  Luckily my friend had some cash on her.

Our other friend arrived, and we were able to sit and catch up for a while.  At the end of our visit, we asked the same guy to take our photo because we hadn't all seen each other in seven years.  He declined to take our photo and said that we weren't even allowed to take photos inside per owner's rules.  We all found that really strange and left us with a bad taste in our mouths about the place."}
{"text":"I'm live in Tremont and Civilization is my first stop every morning. Great people, great atmosphere, great coffee.. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"I went here last winter when my father was in the MetroHealth Cardiac Department for a quadruple bi-pass.  It was a beautiful time of year it was in January and I walked in the store and was greated with a warm welcome. The coffee was delicious and the atmosphere made you feel like you were in a past time of the 1940's.  Very nice and clean and delicioso!"}
{"text":"A charming local coffee shop. The old-world feel is very apparent. The dark and wood interior makes me feel like I'm in some turn of the previous century shop that has not changed at all. I've only had regular coffee from this place. Seems like a great spot to catch up with friends, set up shop to do some work on your laptop or people watch from the sidewalk tables placed right outside the front doors. It really is a great location with Lincoln Park and a thriving neighborhood surrounding it."}
{"text":"If I believed in using the phrase \"hidden gem\" for a place that has 82 reviews, this would be one of those places. Thing is, it was only somehow hidden from me, so I'll just call it a little gem of a shop. I had met a friend at another coffee shop, and (fortunately) the seats were full. My friend suggested this place, and since she knows I'm a bit of a coffee and coffee house snob, I was excited to try a new place! It's really easy to get to, and is one of the few areas in Tremont that usually has enough street parking nearby. It's on the corner of Kennelworth and W 14 across from the park. I noticed there is a little outside sidewalk patio which will be great to visit in the warmer months. The inside is really cozy. I love natural wood, and this place has no shortage. I was lucky enough to come during the holidays, and there were at least 50 of those vintage ceramic lighted Christmas trees which I adore! They were so beautiful I almost cried ha! I noticed old glass drawers/cabinets along the wall, and it turns out this used to be an old apothecary. The fact that they kept these features really helps give this place life. The tables feel a bit cramped, but it wasn't so bad, and wouldn't prevent me from coming. It's a bit typical of small coffee houses. Location trumps size. I looked at the menu almost confused as to what the sizes were. The prices are so reasonable I was taken back. My first visit I got a soy mocha. It was perfect. Just enough chocolate to espresso ratio. I don't want hot chocolate when I order a mocha. I want a chocolate flavored espresso drink, and they nailed it. I went back for a second time, and ordered another soy mocha, but was served a cappuccino instead. I rarely dare get a cappuccino at a new place. I've gotten so used to being handed a shitty version of a latte that I just avoid causing myself the disappointment. To my surprise kept the cappuccino and didn't bother giving it back (no one else was ordering, I didn't take anyone else's drink). The espresso was fresh, the perfect temp, and the foam was on point. It was $2.25. For real. I was happy. This isn't a place I would stop if I was in a hurry to get a drink to go. It waited a good 5-10 minutes for my drink on my first visit. I really don't care as long as the espresso is smooth, and the milk foamed or frothed properly. If I wanted fast mediocre (or disgusting) coffee I'd hit a Starbucks or a Duncan. When I come here I will wait because I know it will be done well."}
{"text":"Great location right across from Lincoln Park in Tremont. Small and intimate. Great iced coffee."}
{"text":"Such a comfy coffee shop. Outdoor seating is wonderful in the warm months, view of Lincoln Park, stream of dogs walking their owners by, etc. Baristas are always courteous. Stopped in today after the garage sale rush had cleared out and had a sweet conversation with Marvin. A place like this makes Tremont feel even more like home."}
{"text":"hmm i dunno how i feel about civilization anymore...
i was so excited my first time going there after getting a delicious cup  of carrot cake coffee with a refill and an apple croissant for less than $4 that i wanted to go back the next day.  so i drive the 20 min the following day to the cafe only to be greeted by a sign saying it's closed b/c the power is out and they will reopen at 2.  it was about 1240...me being the psycho coffee fiend i am...i wait...then at about 145 i called to see if they really think they will reopen at 2 and this girl answers \"hello\" and im like umm is this civilization?and she rudely says yes we're closed, and i was like oh ur not going to reopen at 2 like your sign says and she rudely says no and just hangs up on me"}
{"text":"So I am new to the city and decided to try out this neighborhood coffee shop, not pleased! The service is not very friendly, the coffee is horrible, their pastries are way too expensive. I walked in and the sense of humor of the gal and the guy behind the register was blah!  

I always like to give the benefit of the doubt to everybody, but don't think I will be going back over here again. Coffee shops are meant to be fun, vibrant, friendly, welcoming.....which this place lacked in each of these categories."}
{"text":"Welcome to the wild, wild west! The decor and woody (wood) setting inside is very interesting and makes you feel as if you're living in the wild west...haha. Love it. I would prefer it to be brighter inside because the wood makes the inside feel dark. I can always sit outside if I want more sunlight next time. 

I was in the Tremont neighbourhood with a friend on a Sunday afternoon in May so I stopped in here as we both wanted to get some work done. 

Great service and friendly atmosphere. Try their Mexican hot chocolate and peanut butter brownie. YUM. This was a former drug store and this coffee shop has being around for 27 years. I'm glad I visited for the first time. [visited on May 27, 2018]

Ample street parking as well.

This is my 112th Yelp review overall. 
66 reviews for 2018.
I am aiming for 100 reviews in 2018."}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop! Its super cute and vintage on the inside but it also has tables outside where you can sit and have your coffee and pastry. Super quiet so if you are looking for a place to study this is a go go. The cookies there are so big and super delicious! Also the hot chocolate is a must in the fall and winter time! Also the people there are really friendly which is a plus!"}
{"text":"The place is charming with a old time coffee shop feel. I personally felt very cramped with tables all on one side due to a counter top that stretches the whole right side of the shop. Initially impressed by large selection of muffins, pastrys and sandwiches. I got my go to blueberry muffin and unfortunately it was extremely dry. Like can't even eat the whole thing dry. Chi tea was just okay. I prefer Loop which is one minute down the street."}
{"text":"Civilization is a cool, cozy, coffeehouse I really enjoy coming too.

On the corner of 11th, Civilization has that warm, cozy feel to it. I believe the coffee place used to be an old apothecary, or, it at least looks like one (yay for pharmacy related things!).

I've been here multiple times, and usually get a soy latte or one of the mochas, all which are good. Today was definitely different though- the coffees were the same, and I got my nicely foamed medium soy latte, and sat down at one of the round tables so I could reach an outlet (I do wish there were more outlets...) before 9am on a Sunday morning. What surprised me was that the place was pretty full already- full of locals, just sitting around, chatting, and drinking their cup of coffee. 45 minutes later, I'm still sitting here, but every table is full, even with a large loud middle aged men table behind me, cackling about life and stories. The fact that a coffee shop is packed before 10am, with bad snowy roads, definitely says something, yes?

It's cozy and I feel that the locals feel it too. I like it. And the owner is super friendly- she greeted individuals by name as they walked in...which says a lot, in my opinion.

Kudos to a cozy cafe, with good coffee, free wifi, and some outlets. Score. :)"}
{"text":"after reading all the reviews I rmb to bring cash with me cuz they don't accept credit card! booo

I liked the cappuccino. it was very creamy and with good consistency. I also tried the chocolate dipped almond biscotti and their brownie. they were ok, I can't really comment much on them. I guess they are good, home made, nothing too fancy or too bold.

they don't have that many seats in the shop but the three big tables they have are big enough for folks who need to study there. the waiter was also super friendly. I would definitely come back for coffee and I think they should get a credit card machine for real :)"}
{"text":"GREAT place for eavesdropping.  Coffee house conversation is hilarious and this place tops them all.  There aren't really any other options to sit and meet for a cup of coffee in Tremont, and it is actually very cute and quaint inside.  Ss go get on with your bad, pretentious self, here at Civilizations.  

Also, I do stop in frequently to get coffee & a croissant, so I'm not totally dissing it.  But god it's entertaining.  The outside seating is also a great location for people watching."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Cleveland to relax and drink on some coffee. The regular coffee blends are good. I did not really enjoy the mocha, that is the only fancy coffee I ever drink so I cannot speak on any of the other fancy varieties. The staff is very pleasant. Overall a nice atmosphere to hang out and talk or read."}
{"text":"Following dinner at Ligalis, and a cold night walk around Tremont, we stopped for coffee and cookies. The old-fashioned Iced Christmas cookies were the best we'd had in a long time. Looked like a nice neighborhood hangout with lots of chairs."}
{"text":"I went here today with some friends after grabbing some food at the food truck festival nearby.  Three of my friends bought drinks and we sat down at a table.  Then the owner/manager lady came by and yelled at us for bringing in outside food, even though we had clearly bought drinks from her.  She was rude and the antithesis of what a friendly coffee shop should be, especially in a city like Cleveland.  I (and my 5 friends) will never go back to this place, because there are much nicer places to enjoy a cup of coffee. She has lost our business permanently with her arrogance."}
{"text":"Cool little coffee house in tremont.  Limited pastries which is why I only gave 4 stars.  The prices are very reasonable and their lunch croissants are super good."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the Tremont community! I went here for the first time a few years ago (2005) while campaigning for a Cleveland mayoral candidate and really enjoyed it. Since then, I've made two other visits and the high quality of the beverages has remained consistent over time. If I lived in the immediate area, I could see myself visiting this place on a regular basis. This is a really small detail, but I really appreciated the fact that they had hand sanitizer at the counter...I hate having to run to the bathroom to wash my hands right before I eat when the food is hot and ready to eat!

The decor is really distinct and unique--it's a far cry from the anonymous decor that's found at Starbucks. The prices of the food are quite reasonable as well--I think we made it outta there for under $15.00 for lunch (coffee and sandwich for two, and we split a dessert)

My only complaint about this place is that the seating is a bit limited and cramped. I thought for sure that I was either going to spill my wife's drink or someone else's when moving in\out of my booth. 

I'd suggest going here after having dinner at Fahrenheit or one of the other great restaurants in the neighborhood, or after attending an event at Lincoln Park (there are several cultural events there in the summertime!)"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a cup of coffee to go and took a chance on some of the baked goods.  The raspberry and cheese croissant was delicious!  This is definitely a neat little spot with it's own character and unique charm.  A great place to go back and relax or do some work on a laptop."}
