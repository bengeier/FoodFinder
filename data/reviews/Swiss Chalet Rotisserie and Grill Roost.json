{"text":"I wish my fiancé and I had read the previous reviews on Yelp before we ended up wasting 40 minutes waiting in the 'express' line at this location today.  We wanted to grab a meal here before he checked in.  After knowing we had less than 1 hour for the meal, the waitress recommended us to go in the express line, where the customers put the order themselves just like at a fast-food franchise.  Therefore, we placed our order at the so-called 'express' line.  I waited at the counter since it is self-service while my fiancé took care of the luggages and saved us a table.  We ended up waiting for 40 minutes and having to cancel the order as my fiancé had to catch his flight.  It was a very frustrating experience. My fiancé had an extremely busy day at work and didn't get time to eat lunch. We were expecting to have a nice quick dinner together before he left for his conference over the long weekend. We ended up wasting 40 minutes at this place and feeling starving and frustrated after.  The manager was very quick with cancelling the order for me and didn't seem to be sorry at all. He disappeared as soon as he cancelled the order and said he was sorry about the inconvenience with absolutely no sorrow or care being felt by me.  To be honest, the refunding part was the only efficient service I got. It seems that they are used to customers ending up cancelling their orders.  They obviously couldn't care less due to the benefits from their brand name, the customers' loyalty to their other franchises and the limited options at Pearson,. Therefore, they could still have enough business to put up with their inefficiency and crappy service at this location. I wish there could be more well-known restaurants open at Pearson with reasonable services, and obviously there is not much competition now.   Worth to mention is that the express line doesn't serve any alcoholic beverage such as beer. It is like a fast food chain where only soft drinks and water is served.  If you want a beer or glass of wine to go with your meal, you have to go to the regular dine-in area, which takes a lot longer than the express line according to the waitresses there.  Good luck.."}
{"text":"So this was an impulse stop since we wanted a snack and had time to kill.  I do have memories from childhood of Swiss Chalet once or twice, but that's about it.  Until recently I was not aware it was still around as a chain actually, but it seems to be thriving in Canada.    This location is in Terminal 3, Pearson International Airport, Departures level.  It is large and very busy, always nice to see.  The menu is clean, clear and easy to understand.  The employees were super nice and pleasant.    The food lacked flavor.  Granted, we actually ordered the same appetizer, so really only sampled one thing, but it lacked flavor.  The dipping sauce was nice, I guess, but also lacking in much flavor.    2 stars because of the flavor issues.  But I'd go back if I had time to kill here, the food at the Sheraton is ridiculously overpriced, and frankly not much better.  The other options in this terminal included a \"sandwich\" type place, a frozen yogurt place and a sushi place (I am unlikely to ever have sushi in an airport, I just don't think that sounds right).  I will qualify all of this by saying, the place was busy and people were clearly enjoying their food.  And since this is the departures area its not because they just got off a flight with bad food."}
{"text":"Disgusting! DO NOT GO HERE- Service is lousy and food is inedible.  I had fond childhood memories of Swiss Chalet- this place did not serve those memories well AT ALL.  Try the Paramount next door but stay clear of this pathetic excuse of a dining place."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice now. Honestly, when you're stuck flying through Terminal 3 and you're hungry, you don't have much choice. Both times I've been here I had the same server who looks like she walked straight out of a 60s diner with her platinum blonde hair tied loosely in a bun, bright red lips looking like she's chewing gum, and careless service that takes forever.  The first time I was here I had some chicken wings and it was awful. The second time I was here, they were out of dark meat and we had their quarter chicken and hot chicken sandwich. Their quarter chicken is normal, I guess, but the chicken sandwich was...wtf...two pieces of bread, untoasted, and pieces of dry white meat, and a cup of gravy that you pour on there...for $10! I can make that in my sleep...  They need better restaurants in this place...really, is terminal 3 that neglected?"}
{"text":"Impulse stop - had a 4 hour layover and wanted beer.  Heading inside was not aware the roost was part of Swiss chalet - so beware, if the line is long for Swiss chalet then it will be a wait for food.  After sitting down was not approached by anyone for a good 15 minutes - so my husband went up to the bar for beer and menus. God bless him  Decided on what we were ordering and still no waitress, so I went up to the bar to ask some questions about the menu. The man I asked acted like I was a waste of his time and had to repeat my question a few times before getting an answer : What is your veggie burger made out of... and he didn't even know. He said soy ... I think but it's 100% vegan - excellent menu knowledge lol   But we ate - the veggie burger was so good! And the sweet potatoe fries were excellent!! There was also this side of chipotle sauce, not sure what all was in the dipping sauce but it was so good!!!   So impressed.    If your looking for good service with witty small talk, look elsewhere. If your looking for a quick service, go elsewhere.  If you want a yummy veggie burger and have a couple hours to kill this is the spot!"}
