{"text":"Been here several times. Nice place to bring friends. Great entree/ dessert options. Bacon is to die for. Never feel rushed when relaxing with friends. Very relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten here twice for dinner, and collectively our experience has been underwhelming.  The menu options are broad, the restaurant is clean, but the end meal product just hasn't \"wow\"-ed us.  Both times we've gone something has been burned/charred (first time burger and the bacon on top, second time the sweet potato fries were grossly overcooked to the point of being dehydrated and tough), or under done (So-Cal Chicken Sandwiches were both served with hard, unrip avocado slices, and one chicken breast was..shall I say...crunchy? and not in a good way).  Their standard fries are fine, the pesto aioli on the So-Cal is very tasty, and the ciabatta bun is beautiful.  But when you're paying over $8 for a sandwich its the little things that make you regret not getting something simpler from the menu.  

We haven't tried the breakfast here, which is apparently what they're known for, so maybe we'll give that a whirl and see if our perspective changes."}
{"text":"Ate there last night with my family of 4. Enjoyed the food it was well prepared and overall very fresh without the prefab feeling. I had the chicken entree pretty good sized and I took some home. Salads were very fresh and my wife liked hers. Service was a little off but they are all teenagers and that is to be expected. This is a very new and modern thing for this ancient closed minded part of town. We liked it and I hope it survives if it does't it is not because the food is bad."}
{"text":"Delicious, I got the TAB and it did not disappoint, Nutella crepes were tasty, legit sweet potato fries. I will be back"}
{"text":"I just ate here for the first time today. What a pleasant surprise!! I am so happy there is a place in the neighborhood where I can get fresh fare. The food is delicious! The menu has something for everyone. The environment is warm and relaxing, and the food is light and fresh. It's such a nice jewel in this area! I LOVED it! The restaurant is new and family owned and still finding its stride. I am confident this place will become a staple of the community. It is a great place to gather and have delicious food!"}
{"text":"Food here is great but the reason for my low rating is because me and my husband experienced the most disgusting/unpleasant remarks made by an employee we have EVER heard. Me and my husband have been to this place a couple of times and service was always great. We decided to grab lunch during the week and we sat by the nearest table by the register. My husband is Hispanic, Mexican to be exact and we of course know Spanish. We heard a kitchen employee. Young Hispanic guy say out loud. \"You Mexicans are disgusting and ugly\" along with a few cuss words. And we are not exaggerating!!!!! He had a smirk on his face and was the most humiliating thing he could of said because he was directing at other employees. But of course he meant it to every other \"Mexican\" that was there including my husband. My husband was infuriated and immediately walked outside before making a scene. We have been contemplating about putting this review because we are very pleased with the quality of food and it should not reflect on the restaurant or other employees since customer service was always great. We however feel specially since all this prejudice is happening in our country nowadays,that this should not be tolerated. My husband decided to call and make a complaint. We hope this gets to owner David Candland and he extends his authority to make this restaurant a top priority of respect for everyone. We unfortunately will not be going back for a long while."}
{"text":"The food is very good, the atmosphere relaxed, and the staff is super friendly. I had the filet and blue which was very good but the serving size could have been bigger. I'd still go back."}
{"text":"Tried this place out yesterday after reading Yelp reviews. A little disappointed with the service especially since it was slow. 

Food: two eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, tortilla instead of toast. Good food but also hard to screw this plate up :) hashbrowns were really good but bacon was a little too sweet. We also tried the sugar butter crepe which was okay but absolutely covered in butter. 

Service: It took a few minutes for someone to come to the register. The coffee was out so we asked them to brew some more and they did and said they would bring some over. Well it was a whole huge carafe and I'm not sure when it finished brewing because they never brought any over. We asked for a to go cup since we had already paid for it and they gave us a styrofoam cup with no lid which made it a little difficult driving afterwards with scalding hot liquid haha

Overall wouldn't go back. For $21 there are plenty of other breakfast options that either will serve you or have everything at least stocked and prepared if it is serve yourself."}
{"text":"We love it here! The atmosphere is (typically) quiet and always inviting. We are always greeted by friendly employees who know the menu well. There is a limited menu but everything we've eaten has been delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were very excited when this place opened up! We've been several times and I've really enjoyed the food.  I've tried a few of the savory crepes and they were tasty and unique! They add a nice bit of variety to the menu. The dessert crepe we got was also delicious! My husband is really into burgers and has gotten theirs several times and says it is excellent.  The menu has been changing a bit each time we go in, so I think they've been trying to work out the kinks and get the food narrowed down. The prices are fair.  This is just a solid little local restaurant and Mesa can use more places like this!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places for dinner. We have tried many items and have yet to be disappointed. The menu changes with the seasons so there is always something new to try. Part of the reason for the changes is their approach to using locally-produced produce. The food is great, the desserts are amazing, and the atmosphere comfortable. It is a good thing it is kind of a hidden gem, otherwise there would be no way to find a place to sit."}
{"text":"Orchard Eats is a comfortable fast-casual restaurant with a d√©cor that reminds me of a updated neighborhood pizza joint. Although the name may sway you to think of farm fresh dishes the menu seems to be common American fare found at almost any restaurant but nothing stands out as orchard fresh. The food, for the most part, was above average. The So Cal Chicken sandwich was nice with a good amount of ripe avocado and tasty pesto aioli but the Philly Filet was a little disappointing in the amount of the sandwich ingredients.  The biggest let down was the kids menu.  There was nothing my three year old would eat on their menu and he'll eat almost anything (except pasta) when it comes to restaurant standard children's cuisine.  He ended up eating a side of French fires and parts of our sandwiches.
As an end note, their breakfast looks more promising and I hope to be able to try it in the near future."}
{"text":"Fantastic crepes. Fantastic service. Fantastic atmosphere. The menu here changes often enough (seasonally) that you can keep coming back and find something new and delicious to discover.

The pancakes come with the best syrup I've ever had, and the bacon is addictive."}
{"text":"I've been to orchard eats about 4 times already to try different things on the menu and I loved everything I have tried! The dessert crepes were my favorite. Awesome place and really nice pleasant people!"}
{"text":"Happened to be on my way to the Dutch bros in the parking lot when my family and I stumbled upon this place. My wife is a crepe fiend so she saw crepes on the outside and had to check it out. I had a breakfast sandwich that was very good the only complaint was the croissant was too greasy for my taste. My wife had the crepes and she was in hog heaven. Fresh berries and whipped cream! My daughter even sampled the kids scrambled eggs which I thought were perfectly cooked and the hash browns that we both got with our meals were awesome just the way I like them.excited to try their lunch and dinner options. The price is right as well for 4 meals 25 bucks including drink is amazing. The 5th star is because this is the type of place this neighborhood needed badly. When cindys cafe is the best option (yuck ) this place adds a fresh take on cheap fresh breakfast!"}
{"text":"The crepes here are sooo tasty. Mmmm
They also have salads and sandwiches. Nice family owned place."}
{"text":"I was just driving along a few months ago and saw the street banner for this restaurant. Today I decided to stop in on a whim for breakfast and had the best lightest pancakes I've had in a long time. I definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"I have been here 4 or 5 times and it has always been great. My favorite thing to get is the so-cal chicken sandwich. The fries are really good too. The employees are always very friendly."}
{"text":"What a surprise find! This place looks like a grocery store at first glance. Then you come in and find an urban fruit stand vibe with breakfast, soups, sandwiches, and some entrees. Everything we tried was absolutely delicious, homemade and fresh! The beef stroganoff was so perfect,  the chicken soup was thick and homemade tasting, and the salad were so fresh. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"We wandered in here to check the place out since it is relatively now, and we live in the neighborhood. It is styled like a Smash Burger in ordering concept- walk up, place your order, and sit with a number and it is brought out to you. The menu is pretty comprehensive for how small the place is, and my eyes found the TAB sandwich- my search was over. This little piece of heaven- a grilled, buttery croissant was piled with tons of sweet/savory bacon, fresh avocado and tomato. So simple in concept and excellently executed. The fries were fresh, and while not my favorite style (they were battered shoestring), they were very good. I also tried the tomato basil bisque, which was so yummy! Rich and flavorful. 

My companion ordered spaghetti and meatballs, and was sort of medium-impressed. The meatballs were very flavorful, but the sauce was too sweet for his liking. It was also 2pm on a Saturday... not exactly typical spaghetti-and-meatballs-time. 

We sat out on the patio, where the weather was beautiful. It was pretty quiet so our food came very fast, and we had very friendly service. 

I will DEFINITELY be going back-- food was fresh and delish! They also has a breakfast menu that looked pretty outstanding-- I can't wait to try it!"}
{"text":"I decided to try Orchard Eats because of the high rating.  I had the steak and blue-cheese salad.  My wife had the shrimp salad.  Presentation was great, the employees were fantastic and the place was very clean and orderly.   The food didn't have much flavor.   It was like fresh up-scale hospital food.  I will definitely eat there again because of the people and because the place is locally owned, clean and full of friendly staff.  My only criticism is that our salads didn't cause our taste-buds to get up and dance.   Given the price, I had higher expectations."}
{"text":"Okay, if you want very light and small items, with possible missing main ingredients! 
I got the $11  salad with steak and bacon and onions, but it only had a couple crumbs of bacon.  later i heard a waitress take something back from another customer, and mention that they didn't have the bacon ready yet. 
So... what I have to be not told about this; why couldnt I be offered a substitute or something? 
Instead, my date of a $20 lunch made me wish I had tried Wendy's instead. 

Good idea for a place, poor execution and very skimpy for the $ . 
However, as a positive, the $6 Chicken wraps looked pretty good for the $, and tasted good when I tried my wife's. Look at what customers have before ordering!"}
{"text":"Delicious, Fresh, Fast, Friendly! Many different salads, sandwiches, and entrees to pick from. Generally there is a soup of the day and tomato bisque. The bisque is spot on. Looking forward to coming here again soon!"}
{"text":"1st visit today 12/17/15. I ordered the So Cal sandwich. It came with fries. Best sandwich I have ever had and best fries too. The bacon had a hint of sweetness which complimented the grilled chicken which was plump and juicy. The bread was great too. It's a messy sandwich,  but well worth it!!!  I will definitely be back soon and will tell friends about this place."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Everything on the menu looked absolutely scrumptious!  I finally settled on the Chicken avocado & bacon sandwich (can't even remember what it was called).  Heaven on a bun!  My hubby ordered the French toast which was delicious too.  The fries were perfection.  And although I don't usually order a soda, they have those yummy mix-in flavors, so of course I had to get one!  
Since it was my birthday, I got to try a strawberry & cream crepe on the house... Oh yum!  I'm bringing my kids back soon for crepes all around.  Can't wait to try all the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and sat on the porch because the weather was perfect! I had the filet medallion plate, the wife had the salmon and the toddler had a fruit cup with fries. The medallions were perfectly seasoned with no need for sauce. The mashed potatoes were much better than I thought they'd be and the asparagus was cooked to perfection. The salmon was cooked on par with what you would expect to find at a steak house like The Keg. As for the french fries, they were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, just the way we love them! After dinner we decided it would be foolish to leave without trying one these legendary crepes we keep reading about...OMG!! We love crepes and these were by far the best we've ever had!! I would highly recommend stoping by for a meal or a simple tasty treat! We'll definitely come back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"We (the hubs and I) enjoyed this place- we ordered the savory crepes. The food is fresh and of high quality. I hope it gets busier as I would love to see this place succeed- healthy restaurants are a rarity in Mesa. 4 stars for now as I would like to try some other items on the menu before giving it a final rating. Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"I so want this place to do well!! We have had three meals from Orchard Eats since they opened, and tonight was by far the best. 

OE is a cute restaurant with colorful, comfortable, \"urban retro\" feel. Walk up counter for ordering, but food delivered to your table. Obviously homemade food, with a good variety for almost any palate, especially vegetarian. Some advertised local veggies and meats. Soups are tasty and not overly salty.  Steak Medallion plate, fairly well prepared; meat was delicious, but Potato Cake 'different' shall we say? Burgers and fries are quite sizable (even share-able) and fairly flavorful, but a little messy.  Monterey Chicken/Mushroom Crepe was a pleasant surprise...very tasty; steamed veggies and rice on menu, but no rice tonight, so I got a salad. Which I think would be a better choice. Rice would take away from the crepe in my opinion. Husband got the TAB (Tom/avo/bacon), added cheese, and it was huge and delicious, as were the fries. Raw sugar, lemon, & butter crepe for take-home dessert was $$$!!!! The manager and staff are very friendly and accommodating. Carry out cups are generously provided. Call ahead/carry out is nice, especially since it is \"in the neighborhood\".

Orchard Eats has a homespun feel of local teens/ family working together, which is appealing. Prices are a tad steep in general, for a family style place, but having good food is not without a cost, so we try not to quibble, since portions are generous. 

I think you will enjoy your experience overall."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back for these YUMMY crepes again! Staff was very nice, knowledgeable, helpful, and smiling!"}
{"text":"Wow...fantastic.   Everything about this place is awesome  We got here a few minutes after breakfast time and they still served us what we were looking forward to having.   The banana  French  toast  was to die for!  We will definitely be  back soon!!"}
{"text":"This place is a lot nicer than outside appearances :) I've come here for breakfast and lunch and each time the food and service didn't disappoint. Very cool , casual vibe"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant for the area. Salads are a cut above the rest. I recommend the salad with the filet mignon. The servers are all very friendly the 2 that I remember are Jonah and Pierre. They were very professional and helpful every time I went in. Technically the salads are Low carb options if
You're on a diet. If you're not dieting try their BLT croissant. It's more of a bacon and avocado sandwich.. very delicious."}
{"text":"This is my wife and I' s 1st time here we loved it. Their computers were down but they still took our orders. The 1 staff member was cool and informative about his menu which is nice to see I've been to some places where the staff is very uninformed. Placed our order no no kidding order was brought out with in 10 mins!!! We will b returning to this nice little cafe."}
{"text":"I'll be as objective as possible. The meat of the burger was well prepared, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I do feel, however, that the buns overwhelmed the burger a bit. I asked for everything on my burger, but it was my fault that I didn't clarify what my everything was. No onions and no pickles were minor setbacks on my burger adventure, but I looked past it; perhaps pickles and onions are not standard on an everything burger. But I enjoyed sitting by the window; It was a relaxing environment, which I opt for frequently. One last thing I'll mention, which is, perhaps, part of my neurosis, would be the placement of the ketchup bottle. When I enjoy a burger, I am in a lazy, docile mode, and have no intent to use my functional legs to walk over to the front to scoop my own ketchup. Again, I'm only this way when I'm about to consume a burger. With that being said, the gentleman at the counter took it upon himself to bring me all the condiments, so I'll scratch this from my argument. Overall, not bad, and I'll come back with intent to try a burger with onions and pickles. I feel this place has potential. Thank you."}
{"text":"Orchard Eats is underrated! It's fantastic. I wish more people in the area knew about it. Fast service, delicious food, and clean atmosphere. I love the So Cal chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. And the crepes are also a MUST TRY."}
{"text":"Received email back from owner.  He decided it was better to try and explain the business, and defend the business and try and be funny....,INSTEAD of taking my review and try to understand my experience and make a negative to a positive.  Interesting to see if this restaurant will be open for business in a year with leadership like that.  I wish you the best ."}
{"text":"Uhhhhh, first off, for a place that boasts being fresh 10 times before you get to the counter I was really surprised to see kraft mac and cheese on my daughters plate.  Fresh for adults, processed crap for the kiddos.  Hmmmm.
We ordered two things solely because it said there was smoked bleu cheese on them:a salad and a burger.  I did not taste smoke in the Bleu cheese at all.  The salad was pretty good, meat cooked really well.  Burger was boring and unremarkable.  I won't be back.
Very expensive for the quality."}
{"text":"This place is one of my go-to's. Love the beef stroganoff, burgers, salads, and especially love the crepes. The only thing I don't like is that they have a breakfast menu, but don't open until 9am. There are so many times I would have stopped in for breakfast after dropping off my kid if they were open at 8am."}
{"text":"I cannot believe the hype this place is getting. I was so unbelievably excited to try this restaurant because the \"See it Try it\" ladies always compliment this place like it is the best food you've ever tasted. Sadly I am guessing it is because they know them, get free food, or get kick back of some sort cause there is no way it is that good. Here is a totally honest review. Crepes- delicious (crepes always are)- problem with crepes...they are ridiculously overpriced! People, a crepe is a thin pancake that takes seconds to cook and have put together. They are charging up to $6 for a single crepe with some easy, slap on toppings. I am sorry but that is outrageous. When we ordered a few to try I thought the portion would be at least double for the price. We ordered kids mac'n'cheese...hmmmm...Kraft of course. So sorry, not impressed there. And we ordered a chicken sandwich. The restaurant was dead slow and it came out right away which means it was cooked ahead and re-heated or sitting in a warmer of some sort. The flavor I was hoping would save it but it was lacking. Overall, overpriced and mediocre. I am not trying to be mean- with all of the hype and overly fluffy reviews, I need to be honest so others have some clue before you spend money here. Would I come back? If a friend asked to meet for lunch here, I would not say no. I would come back but knowing what to expect. I am also more cautious of what the \"See it Try it\" ladies say is great food."}
{"text":"I have come here a few times, and each time I am surprised at how good everything on the menu is. I'm a sucker for bleu cheese and their Filet and Bleu salad knocks it out of the park. I was happy with the smiling service and feel good about helping a locally owned family restaurant. Get the Nutella crepe with strawberries...it does not disappoint."}
{"text":"I love it! I had the pulled pork sandwich with potato fires. The sandwich was really good but the sweet potato fries were divine! Staff was great. I give it two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Loved the unique menu, I will definitely go again. My rating currently is based on the artichoke veggie pita I ordered. I wasn't super impressed with the flavor combination. On the other hand, my husband ordered the greek burger and plowed right through it!"}
{"text":"So. Cal sandwich and stroganoff. Yum! Great taste. Meat review: chicken, tough. Beef, tender and amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! And surprisingly low prices for the quality of food. Will definitely be making this a regular stop"}
{"text":"I've tried several different dishes here, and I was not disappointed by any of them! The ingredients are always perfect and fresh. The sauces and seasonings are amazing! The crepes are moist and tender and they make great dishes with them that serve as entrees as well as desserts.

One of my favorite dishes is the filet and Boeing salad. Perfect, tender leaves of butter lettuce, each with fresh tomato, crispy carrot slivers, and a dollop of Boeing cheese dressing. This comes with a sliced filet mignon and sauteed onions. You put the steak and onion on the lettuce leaf and roll it up to eat it. It's honestly the tastiest thing I've ever eaten!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"It has been a few months since I had the pleasure of eating at Orchard Eats! Great spot, with great ownership! Truly worth searching out!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time (3 or 4 times per week) and the food is delicious! Especially the breakfasts. Pleasant, upbeat staff, as well. =)"}
{"text":"Love the crepes here! I've had smores and fluffernutter crepes, both amazing and very well-priced. The rest of the food is a little pricey for a casual restaurant. Staff is very nice but sometimes the wait for the food is a bit much, especially since I've never seen this place crowded."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as it is close to my house and we are lacking in good food options.  

I have tried four of the dishes, the pork chop, lemon pasta chicken, chicken spinach poached pear salad and the turkey cranberry sandwich.

All the items were decidedly mediocre (at best) with the exception of the pear salad.  This salad was exceptionally vile and should not be considered under any conditions.  The pears were the single most salty thing I have ever eaten and caused me to gag.  The mashed potatoes served with the pork chop had a gummy texture and appeared to be fake.

Unfortunately, after two visits I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner here and enjoyed the food very much. The food was fresh and tasty. We found the restaurant by doing a quick search on yelp. Two in our group were from Ohio and the other two, native Arizonans. The food was great. We were surprised to see that the restaurant was designed around a cafeteria style set up. We got our drinks and they delivered the food to our table. We had a variety of items from the menu and everyone was raving. We will go back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to lunch at Orchard Eats. The owner was very friendly and suggested different menu options, there were a lot of options that all sounded very tasty. I was impressed at the amount of options that sounded good to me, AND the amount of options that I knew my husband would enjoy! Staff was also very considerate and helpful. I might even go so far as to describe them as doting. We had the chicken poached pear salad and a Philly cheese steak, and a Nutella and cream crepe. Everything was devoured. The cheese steak was tender, not chewy, and the salad was fresh and well balanced. Also impressed with the texture of the crepe. It reminded me of some of the European crepes I've had when traveling. Defiantly a good place to try!!"}
{"text":"so, we ordered the TAB- (tomato, avocado and bacon) sandwich, a basic crepe, large house salad and the steak stroganoff to give the place a really good try.

TAB- the avocado was mostly black, so lots of picking through the sandwich for good pieces. the bacon was very fatty (we were just not fans; i know many people like it this way, but it was just fatty, under cooked and gross. it did, however, have a nice sweet taste on the pieces we did eat. everything else was kinda okay/ not bad. (fries, pesto aioli and the croissant)

basic crepe- was a basic crepe. not too sweet with a light lemon flavor.

house salad- looked great. the taste was okay, and a decent size for $5. but..... the house salad dressing..... no, no, no... no flavor... like a waxy taste, so pick a different one for yourself.

steak stroganoff- hhmm... well, what should i say.... it was creamy, nice mushrooms, steak pieces were a nice size, the portion size was great and the..... okay, so the thing was really good. we would differently order this again. 

overall, was not impressed... at all... for around $30 and most of it was kinda blah or tossed... would probably go elsewhere... unless craving the steak stroganoff, breakfast foods items or a crepe, but you know... do you."}
{"text":"Definitely a great venue for families! We are seniors and enjoyed a leisurely late lunch! New owners have completely gutted the space and it is now very attractive and comfortable! Staff are friendly, informative and attentive! Mushroom burger was delish with swiss and portobello.  Cheeseburger was  with american. Presentation was exceptional for a family oriented venue! Our lucky day, as we met owner David who engaged with us! We will be back for more tasty dining! (Must try breakfast and dinner!!!)"}
{"text":"First time here..had a great breakfast the bacon is delicious. Sat out on the patio. I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Ok, so I was just starving after a long day and decided to check yelp to see if I could find a \"healthier\" option to get in my way home.   I noticed a sign for Orchard Eats she checked Yelp and deduced to try it.  

First off, let me just say that the food ( I got the chopped blt salad...the burgers looked tempting, but I'm trying to eat more cleanly) was EXCELLENT...very tasty and fresh.  No complaints there.  The service was also great...friendly folks, etc.  

BUT, for $9.50, I was expecting a meal, not an appetizer-sized portion.  I was in a hurry and got it to go, so I didn't have time to go back and ask if they were kidding with my portion size, but let's just say I just finished it and  pretty sure I'll be hungry by the time I get home.   

I would rate this much higher, but I honestly felt ripped off.  Like, I'm still literally hungry 5 minutes later. :-/"}
{"text":"I'm not sure when this place opened, I certainly didn't notice when it went in. It's tucked away from the road and hard to see from the street. 

It's fast-casual, more like Chipotle. You look at a menu when you come in, and in this case they have monitors that show the menu on the wall by the door, with their most popular dishes highlighted. It's basic American food: burgers, salads, sandwiches, Americanized pasta dishes, with some other dishes thrown in(chicken pita, and ramen). They also have crepes, which we did not try. You order and pay at the counter and then get drinks from a soda fountain(Coca Cola products, sorry Pepsi fans). 

Best friend had the mushroom burger, which he really liked. It was cooked well and very fresh. The salad was nice and fresh too. I had the chicken alfredo which I liked. It was a tad underseasoned for me but I like more salt than most people so that's not a knock against them. :) 

Food was fresh and they don't make it till you order it. While it was very tasty and fresh it wasn't outstanding, very cookie-cutter fare, which is why they lost a star. 

Customer service is excellent. Friendly waitstaff that bring your food to your table, and the check on you periodically to see how you're doing and how your meal is. 

The reason for the second star is, surprisingly, the soda fountain. If you don't drink caffeine or aspartame you're out of luck and your only option is water. Their root beer is Barq's (22mg per 12 ounces), and instead of regular Sprite they serve Sprite Zero, which is disgusting. Super not thrilled. 

All in all not bad, if I get in a bind and need go grab a meal to take home when I'm in the area this might be on my list, as they also have to-go options, but there are a lot of other places in the area as well, so it would depend on what I'm craving."}
{"text":"Wow this place is good! We randomly stopped in for lunch today. I had the chicken pita and side of tomato soup, kids had French toast and a Nutella crepe and hubby had the Rueben. Everything was delicious and we ate it all! 
The head chef took our order and made my son chocolate milk. Clean, friendly, good service and excellent food.  We'll be back even though it 20 minutes form us."}
{"text":"Food was very good here, just the right proportion too. Very cute inside, didn't expect it to be as nice as it was based on the location of it because it's in the strip mall. We're not normally out this way but it was excellent. I love that this place gives you a different experience, it gives you the trendy feeling of an upscale restaurant while being very laid back."}
{"text":"The so cal chicken sandwich is to die for, so are the sweet potato fries! Super friendly, great neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We really love this place, and have come here a lot. Bit they recently reduced the selections on their menu.  We used to LOVE the breakfast sandwiche with the crescent and hollandaise. It's GONE.  

Please bring it back!"}
{"text":"Just ok. The restaurant itself is very clean and decor is nice. I went there for breakfast. The menu is very small and very simple. Nothing fancy. I ordered the two eggs sunny side up with applewood bacon and hash browns, coffee, and orange juice. The eggs were cooked perfectly as was the bacon. The hash browns were well-seasoned but mushy and undercooked. The staff seemed a little flustered although there were 6 guests total in the restaurant. They sent us the wrong order initially (again, only 6 guests to serve and simple menu). The coffee ran out and it took about 15 minutes and three different guests notifying staff the coffee was out for staff to make more and refill the canister. I understand it's a new restaurant but they've been open a month or so and still have some hiccups. I can make that same menu at home, for less money and it will take a lot less time. Also, I would rather make the drive for breakfast at places such as Morning Glory Cafe or Crackers & Co (highly recommend). Probably won't go again, but nice to see a new restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot. It's easy to miss because it's in a small strip mall, but it is well worth the stop. Great service, good food, and very reasonable prices. We came here for the first time to have dinner with friends and we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"What a cute little place. Little flowers in mason jars sitting on all the tables. Very clean and friendly. Lots of really good options, it was hard to choose what to eat. We ended up getting the TAB, ULTIMATE FRENCH TOAST, and the kids CHICKEN FETTUCCINE. Wish they had more drink options though. Sweet potato fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"Update: I am moving it to 3 stars, because they reached out to me to remedy the experience. Once my wife and I try them in person. 

Used Grubhub and ordered a couple cheeseburgers. Paid extra for bacon on both, and an extra ranch dressing. Totally disappointed. My wife's burger came with bacon, mine did not. It also came with tomatoes when I put in the order \"no tomatoes\". Burgers are very cold, and the patties were not very good. Just gotta say, very disappointed. Not gonna recommend this restaurant to anyone. Could have grilled up some frozen Costco burgers and had them come out better."}
{"text":"Sign is cute, decor simple and clean.  Food...ok.  Not a great place to go if you are a vegetarian.  They accommodated me but there is no reason to return.  Staff was super nice tho!  Music was the perfect volume."}
{"text":"My hubs and I shared the so cal chicken and bbq burger- they were both delicious!!! Then we shared the banana strawberry crepe- phenomenal 
Excellent customer service too. Highly recommend this place. Yum"}
{"text":"The place is cute. I like the idea. But good heavens is the service inept. The kids were sweet but had no idea what they were doing.

We came in for a late Saturday breakfast. We ordered eggs, bacon, toast and a crepe that they offered to bring us after the rest of our food. That was all great. There were probably four tables ahead of us.

And then it took them more than half an hour to bring us our food. 35 minutes for eggs! Eggs! I don't know who's managing that kitchen, but owners please: get rid of them. Or train them. That eats me up that someone's livelihood is in the hands of these kids. If I had to guess, the problem was that the kitchen was working one order at a time, completely finishing it before starting the next ticket.

Anyway, after finishing our food and wondering what happened to the crepe, I went up to the counter to flag someone down. They hadn't started the crepe yet, and despite sweetheart's assurance that it doesn't take very long, I went with what experience had taught me and told her not to bother.

Chances are we give it one more try. The rest of the menu looked promising. Maybe during lunch hours they run a tighter ship. But guys: half an hour for eggs is really, really bad."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for a while, and their $1 pancake special for national pancake day seemed like the perfect opportunity.  I was so happy with every aspect of my experience.  Staff was friendly and helpful, and the owner was there making his rounds and asking customers if they were enjoying their food.  The pancakes I got for my son, and I of course had to sample them for my review ;) delicious, although it's hard to get a bad pancake.  For myself I ordered the TAB croissant sandwich (tomato, avocado, bacon) and it was amazing.  The pesto aioli really made the sandwich, and the croissant was soft yet crunchy/flaky.  I even enjoyed my french fries, and I'm not much of a fry person.  The place is also kid friendly which is a huge plus.  Can't wait to go back and try more on their menu."}
{"text":"The staff is incredibly friendly and the food is all so delicious. My favorite is the BLT salad! So excited to have a yummy, one of a kind restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"Really wasn't that impressed by the breakfast, when you list  something as over medium eggs one would except the yolk to still be intact and some runney-ness to it. What I ended up with was a fried egg. Food aside their innovative soda mixing station (I tried the orchard, lime/peach syrup with lemonade and a splash Sprite and Fanta) and the friendly staff  might bring me back again to try their lunch or dinner menu."}
{"text":"The food never disappoints! It's a fun, friendly atmosphere. The decor is darling! I feel like family here!"}
{"text":"This place is the cutest restaurant!! I got the shrimp caprese salad and it was the freshest and best salad I had in a long time!! They were generous with the shrimp and the mozzarella was so fresh and delicious! I cannot wait to try the other things on their menu. So great to have a locally owned restaurant out here!!"}
{"text":"Came in at noon.   I, too, like someone else said, wanted to absolutely love this place but was extremely disappointed in the lack of helpfulness when trying to decipher the menu choices to the lack of organization and lack of service and the quality of what we ordered in comparison to the price. also, in spite of it being higher-priced than we anticipated, everything was absolutely self-serve from getting our drinks to napkins and utensils. won't be back"}
{"text":"Tried Orchard Eats again. They are getting better. My first review on our experience was not overly positive and I hoped it was because of just opening jitters for the restaurant. Due to other positive reviews we have decided to stop by for lunch.  Burgers for lunch were quite good. Keep it up and we will be regulars as the location is convenient."}
{"text":"A hidden gem with their new menu! Farm to table and organic greens. The staff, chef was so friendly, thanking us for coming in.

The sandwiches were so tasty! With such a delicious menu, it will bring us back again to try more. We tried both the house fries and the sweet potato fries, and they are our new favorites. We ended it all with a Nutella crepe with whipped cream and drizzled chocolate. 

If you appreciate local and quality food prepared by a talented chef, give this place an eat!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. Wasn't very many choices but I had the basic two eggs, ham and hash browns. I believe it was around 6.00 which seemed like a fair price. Got our own drinks and they have really good crushed ice and a great tea selection. Waited for a long time for food and there was only one other table in the place.  When we got our plates we thought they were children's plates. The portions are way to small."}
{"text":"I've been here several times since I moved to the area because not only is their selection of natural food and organic choices impressive, but their food is absolutely delicious. The turkey cranberry sandwich is my personal favorite but they also have breakfast, lunch, dinner and salad options galore. The service is always friendly and the vibe is super cute and hipster."}
{"text":"Seriously, this place is the best!! Food was amazing, good price and staff is super nice!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and well priced. I was visiting AZ for a friends wedding and if I make it back out there. I will definitely stop by and have a meal there. The restaurant was clean and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Nice local restaurant. Tried it for breakfast. Good customer service. Spacious. Clean. Quality breakfast. Good price for amount. Only negative....they don't have freshly squeezed oj?! That should be there \"specialty\" since its called \"Orchard\" and has trees in decor. Just a thought."}
{"text":"Really delicious little gem. Food is fresh and you can tell they take pride in it. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Seems like the place is headed in a decent direction but could use some consumer input. The fancy menu TV boards are great and easy for people in line to see but when I am the entire line having a second menu handy at the counter would be nice. 

I had a question about a food item and the employe's response was \"I'm not sure\". Well...? No, she did not find out, (I can't blame her, she is probably only helping out because she can't be in class while her teachers strike). I walked back to the fancy TV's to find another option, the turkey/cranberry/avocado (huh? I don't remember that in the Thanksgiving \"story\") sandwich (it was pretty good minus the avo'course). 

After I placed my order for the sandwich I had to ask myself what side I wanted, no one else cared. I chose the fruit cup, now I don't eat a sandwich with a fork but fruit yes (not an apple of course), well there wasn't one in my \"to-go\" order. Which now that I think about it, it's fine because who want to eat a cup of cantaloupe (assumed it was mixed fruits, silly me)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and the food was decent.  For the prices they charge, the food and service should be much better than they are.  The people at the counter seemed very distracted chatting with each other and not paying attention to customer's orders.  My friend's food was brought to the table a good 15 minutes before the rest of the table.  I ordered the steak strogonoff which was sold out, so I settled for a Black and Bleu burger - well done with raw onions added.  My burger was medium and had sauteed onions.  Also a very minimal amount of bleu cheese or any dressing of any sort.  The idea behind candied bacon on a burger is not great either - much harder to chew and less bacon flavor.  My husband ordered chicken fettucine alfredo - it was a bowl half full of sauce so it was more like a soup - normally that would not be a huge issue, but the sauce was super bland.  The only (somewhat) saving grace was the crepes (which they tried to overcharge me for first, then tried to give me change for a 5 dollar bill when I gave them 10 - teach people how to run your pos system - they are not that hard to use) which were really just common crepes at best.  Would not go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant with healthy fresh food selections. My husband said that his Gyro was excellent & I really liked my burger.  Even the small house side salad was impressive.  They offer a lot of good food made well.  We will continue to visit anytime we're close."}
{"text":"Great! In from San Francisco and found this gem of a new restaurant in the neighborhood so thought we'd try it out. Excellent service and a great spot for lunch and breakfast. I had the So Cal Chicken w bacon avocado on really good home baked style ciabatta bread with pesto mayonnaise. Really really good. I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"25-30 minute wait for our food. My husband ordered the house salad and the house dressing was too oily with no flavor. I read a review the food was bland and the only good thing was the crepes is absolutely correct. The SoCal was pretty decent. We got the banana creme pie crepe and it made up for everything else. Don't come expecting to be waited on. You are on your own for refills and make sure you grab your silverware and napkins before you sit. Decor was very nice tho. The young man who took our order was nice but the vibe was very ehhhh."}
{"text":"Average food with average service. If you're out of creamer, you should probably tell your patrons before they purchase a coffee. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place serves up fresh and quality food.  I ordered the So Cal Chicken sandwich and it was your typical bacon, avocado, cheese combo but with pesto to enhance it.  The best part is the chicken!  It is so perfectly grilled and seasoned.  Just tasty, juicy, and perfect amount of char.  Same goes for the chicken in my husband's strawberry salad.  He enjoyed his as well.  While tomato basil bisque did taste fresh and homemade, it was too thick in an odd way.  It wasn't from chunks of tomato but was very grainy.  I don't know if there was loads of Parmesan or there were grains in there but the texture and appearance grossed me out a little if I paid too much attention. Overall taste was still decent though.  With the big windows, it is a nice bright and clean local joint to grab a casual lunch if in the area."}
{"text":"This is the third time trying and everything has been better than the last. The pita was my last choice and it blows away any gyro I've had at any place specializing in gyro's. First impression of prices seem steep, but the quality of food is that of a 5 star restaurant. Will be back at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I thought the service at this place was great. Yes, you go to the counter and they bring it to you but there are people floating around asking if you need anything which is nice. I had the burger because several reviews suggested it. The meat of the burger was very good. However it was as bland as could be. No special sauce, no mayo, nothing. Dry sandwich with only lettuce and tomato. I thought that was weird. Thought the bun was very good too. I loved the fries that came with it and I'm somewhat of a fry snob.
My husband had the beef stroganoff and really liked it. I tasted it and agreed. He wished it had more mushrooms but he's a really mushroom fan.
As others said it's a bit pricy for lunch. I felt I could get a better burger at another establishment for less than $10 that I would have liked better. While I appreciate the local grown food concept I really don't want to pay more for it.
Overall I enjoyed the experience and I will definitely eat here again; possibly for dinner."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the breakfast very much. Very kid friendly. Staff was great. The place is very welcoming. Ambience is great. We stumbled onto this place and since then have visited a few times. We don't mind the drive for the quality."}
{"text":"Love, this place. I've had breakfast and lunch and I haven't been disappointed. The menu is small and is on the wall which I really like, then you order. Your meal is brought to you and they clean your table. Try it, you will like it."}
{"text":"The food is ok. Not a lot of flavor, but fresh. They use dark greens instead of iceburg lettuce which is a plus! Ok for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Sweet pork burger. I have had BBQ pork burgers many times and most of the time I am not very impressed, but this time I was very impressed. The pork was sweet and it complimented the burger on a ciabatta roll. The fries that come with this burger where great also. My wife got the street tacos and thought they where really good as well. The only complaint at my table was the meat balls, but my kids are spoiled with my wife's meat balls."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. First time here and probably the last. The food was just okay. I had the chicken pita which says it comes with feta cheese but it was nowhere to be found, and the roasted vegi was bland and just kinda thrown on there. Buffalo bacon wrap was pretty tasty. The service was not good. Waited over 20 minutes for our food! The people working there had the personalities of a dead moth. They should get a more efficient staff and lower prices. Or use that extra money they earn for personality lessons."}
{"text":"Fresh food and nice variety. The strawberry avo salad gets stellar reviews, as does the shrimp and beef skewers. The bread on the So Cal chicken sandwich disintegrated 1/4 of the way into the sandwich so it was finished with a fork. The fries are batter dipped so most likely not gluten free friendly.  They have  a large selection of Italian flavorings so some fun soda concoctions could be made."}
{"text":"The food was so good! The menu is a bit limited if that's an issue for you but I found many wonderful things I wanted to try. I can't wait to come back and try the crepes. I had a scramble and a pancake and they were wonderful. The decor is nice and its roomy. We dined in the service was not great, there were maybe two to three other tables. They were friendly but very forgetful for no reason since it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"Orchard Eats is a unique neighborhood restaurant. Where can you find beef stroganoff? It's never on any menus but I loved my mother' stroganoff. When I dropped at Orchard Eats I saw it on the menu. I used almost all of my Weight Watchers points - 21! And it was worth it - tender lean beef, creamy, buttery sauce and perfect egg noodles. It was better than my mother's!

The menu is unique and healthy-ish. My wife loved her Nutella crepe. Ambiance is casual and comfortable. 

Every time I travel to Mesa I eat here several times. It is a hidden gem in a strip mall but I love everything I have eaten here. The breakfast sandwich served on a large toasted croissant is huge, flaky and well seasoned - not bland. It has two fried eggs (my yolks were perfectly runny) and thinly sliced ham. The accompanied hash browns were crispy and buttery. And it has Hollandaise sauce inside! French toast is elasticky cinnamon bread! Then there are crepes! 

You know those new expensive soda shops with flavors to mix with soda? At Orchard Eats you can add any Italian soda flavor to your soft drink at no extra charge. 

I had to update this by mentioning their breakfast sandwich is a winner - buttery croissant, quality ham , cheese and two fried eggs."}
{"text":"Nice place to have a casual healthy breakfast, lunch or dinner. Good variety and fresh.  The sweet potato fries are the best. You order at the cash register and they bring it to your table.  Drinks are self-serve, free refills.  It's become a regular place for us to eat."}
{"text":"We were so excited to get a new place to eat close to home. We love the cleanliness of the place and the decor. But honestly for the prices they charge, I expect a little better. I found their food to be just \"OKAY\" and I hate the way their beverage station is set up."}
{"text":"Pancake kids meal- generous portion and yummy fruit on top! Perfectly cooked bacon;)

Breakfast burrito- big and filling but hash browns on the side were a bit undercooked and had to add salt to burrito and hash browns 

Girls up front were super sweet and helpful explaining to order and then they bring it to the table. 

Open and bright inside. I hope this place does well! We will come back to try lunch sometime!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in the area!  Food is so good!  We split the BBQ burger and fries they were fantastic. Also ordered a large salad to split. Didn't even need to ask for them to split it and they offered. The staff is so friendly and so CLEAN!  We watched each of the employees as they cleaned up around the restaurant. They go above and beyond. Bathrooms were super clean too!  They have obviously been trained well. Seem happy so thinking management is good to them. We will definitely be back over and over again!  Thank you for having us!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Myself and a co worker tried this place cute little place on a whim; now I come back weekly. My favorites are the Turkey Cranberry on a croissant, and The Cuban. Both sandwiches come with their own house made sauce, which is what really makes these sandwiches special. Order the Sweet Potato Fries. Totally worth the extra 50¬¢.

My only wish for this place is that they would open a location in Ahwatukee. Yes, I drive all the way across town for this place, and you will too after trying it."}
{"text":"First Time! Grab some friends and head to Orchard Eats! I will be back! Food was amazing! Staff was friendly! I had the TAB with sweet potato fries. Lots of great choices on the menu!"}
{"text":"We showed up at 9am looking for great new breakfast place. Doors were locked and an employee showed up and could also not get in. Their sign and website say open for business at 9am."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first experience here overall.

There are a few things this joint could benefit from. Food presentation is slightly bland, not unappetizing, just now a wow factor when you see your food. Having plates and silverware brought to you with food, or at least verbally offered if you forgot to grab your own. Something besides styrofoam for to-go containers would be nice (help the earth!) I liked that they used real silverware and plates, unlike a few other joints I have recently tried. Staggering dinner vs. desert delivery to table. My friend said her fries were a little bland, maybe truffle oil would be nice? Friendly atmosphere and great staff. Nicely put together inside. The sauce on my veggie crepe was great. Will be back! Looking forward to changing my rating in the future as you guys work out more kinks. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late breakfast, literally they switched from breakfast to lunch menu after we ordered.   Not a big deal as i was craving breakfast.   I ordered a croissant with eggs, Cheese and bacon sandwich and it came with a side of hash browns.   The hash was great and the first bite of my sandwich was good.   The second bite had onions in it.  SAY WHAT? There was no mention of onions on the menu.  I hate raw onions, it was like a cruel joke.  I picked the onions off and my wife ate them.  Then the sandwich was back to being good. 

My wife had oatmeal and apple pancakes.   They were good too, i had to try them.  

I will go back for lunch sometime.   Great new place near home, we can walk here.  Nice to see the new place sprouting up in the hood.   The place would be a lot better if they sold beer.  They have a nice patio that would be nice in the evenings."}
{"text":"Delishous!! Very fresh ingredients and the bacon is super yummy! I wish they were open earlier because 9 am is just too late."}
{"text":"Come here for the first time and it was ok. We ordered a turkey garden club and steak stroganoff, and a kids chicken strips. Food came out 40 min later! The waitress set the play of the steak stroganoff down said \" oh that looks weird, we most be out of the other noodles\" paying almost 14 bucks for something and then waiting 40 min to not get what you ordered sucks."}
{"text":"My husband and I popped in for a late lunch. He ordered the phillly cheesesteak and of course a banana cream crepe, both were excellent! I ordered the chicken pita, also excellent. Very friendly staff. Glad we finally tried this place, we live around the corner and will be back soon! Nice to see a locally owned business that utilizes local produce too."}
{"text":"I've only been here once for breakfast. The food was pretty good and fairly standard. Nothing to write home about. You get large portions, so bring your appetite. 

However, I think they need to figure out a different method with their menu. In fact, I think they should abandon their awkward TV wall menu. Either put it up at the counter or go to a traditional sit down menu. I was also disappointed that they didn't have a children's breakfast option. They were able to \"a la carte\" a kid's meal, but you'd think for a family restaurant there'd be a children's menu. 

And this is just a personal preference, but I also think they should extend their breakfast hours. They stop serving breakfast at 11am. If they choose to have breakfast hours, perhaps 1 or 2pm would be more appropriate. I went in there once to get breakfast at 12pm not knowing they have breakfast hours. I left and went somewhere else. I wanted eggs and bacon, not lunch sandwiches. They lost business that day."}
{"text":"I've tried this place 4 times, hoping that it will improve. The first time I tried some crepes, and they were delicious! A little bit too much Nutella but hey, not complaining. Things could be worse than having too much Nutella. Second time I had a bbq sweet pork burger. I took one bite, and immediately had a rancid-like taste. I took it home and immediately threw it away. Third visit, I ordered sweet potato fries to-go. They threw them in a paper bag, not even in a box like how McDonald's does fries... Or a styrofoam to-go box. Just throw a bunch of fries in a paper bag. Then when you get home, you have a soggy mess and the fries are literally about to fall out of the bottom of the bag because the grease has soaked the bag. I wrote the company about that issue and the guy basically said that's the only way they do the to-go fries. Gross. 4th visit, and the last one I'll ever make, we ordered crepes again. The lemon one and the sugared one had nothing on it! No flavor! I called to tell the cashier about it. Dead silence for 5 seconds. She had no idea what to say except \"oh sorry\". I work in the food industry so I deal with customers like myself. I broke the silence, and said \"so is there anything you can do? Can I get a refund or maybe come in and get new ones made in the future?\" She ended up saying that I could come in and get $5 off my order. That was nice, but having to prompt her to say anything was like pulling teeth. I honestly will not be going back... Even with $5 off my next order."}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast burrito I've had in a long time. So fresh tasting and perfectly cooked. It more than curbed my appetite for a savory breakfast. In addition, the staff was very friendly and despite it not being a sit down restaurant, they still checked on me frequently and ensured my experience was a great one. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here tonight! My husband got the Fettuccine and Alfredo and I had the French dip. The portions were great and we had enough for us to take some home for lunch tomorrow! The service was great, it was our first time here and someone met us at the menu and explained everything, sharing what the different colors on the menu meant etc.  The whole dining experience was delightful. Nice neighborhood eating establishment, we will be back."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp and had good reviews so we decided to give it a try... Ordered the So-Cal Chicken and loved it! Also tried the crepes and french toast and it was really good as well.. will definitely keep coming back and recommending to family and friends."}
{"text":"Clean, frendly and good menu.  Breakfast all day. 
Second Saterday is 1/2 off all crepes. Yumm."}
{"text":"The apple and oatmeal pancake was good.

The decor is colorful, clean and fresh.

Meals are ordered at the cashier, then delivered to the table.  The silverware and drinks are self-serve.

Employees are friendly and attentive.

The location is on the northwest corner of Gilbert and McKellips, West of Bashas'."}
{"text":"Took the kids here after dance competition. Boys has cheese burger and fries, I had said and the mushroom burger and the hubs had the philly. My little one had 2 kids meals Mac and cheese and a crepe. All of the food was gone when we left. Everyone ate everything they ordered. It was terrific! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great food and prices. Everything I've ordered here has been delicious. It has a nice restaurant feel but you get you feel quick and you don't have a waiter interrupting you everything 5 minutes, but the service it great! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"If you never get anything else, get the SWEET POTATO FRIES. Oh my good god they're amazing. I always get the summer love salad (seasonal) with no goat cheese (vegan compliant). 

The textures of the roasted red pepper with the oily artichoke hearts and spinach are a match made in heaven. 

But really, the star of the meal is the sweet potato fries. They're a side. And they're amazing. 

The staff is always super friendly, accommodating, and happy. I like eating places where the people there are happy to work there. Orchard Eats is a great example of this."}
{"text":"Wasn't the best meal I have had. Very eclectic decoration at the location. I ordered a cheeseburger, which came with fries. the fries were great. however the burger was the size of a child's burger and the bun was huge! I am not sure I will be back. The burger lacked seasoning, and I wasn't too impressed."}
{"text":"East Mesa needs more places like this!  Fresh, homemade style goodness with a great variety of options, all locally sourced.  I personally recommend the crepes! 

And whatever pig gave its life to make this amazing bacon should be proud, this stuff is amazing.  I'm not ashamed to admit I ate it off my kid's plate when he wasn't looking. He can't know things in life can taste this good or that Kraft mac and cheese I serve him every night just won't cut it any more."}
{"text":"My first time here. Wanted to try a new breakfast place... Plus, I was starving after my workout.

Enter in, Orchard Eats. Their gimmick, and there's nothing wrong with having a gimmick, is that they serve up \"fresh fare.\" What exactly this means is not clear. Are their ingredients sourced locally? Are their baked goods made on the premises? Do they shop farmers markets to get what they need? Or do they just get bulk shipments from suppliers just like everyone else. How do they define \"fresh?\"

On to the food. I ordered the Mountain View Scramble. For less than $10 I thought it was a good value: hash browns, the scramble with the kitchen sink in it, toast, and a side of bacon or ham. I chose bacon. Let's start there. The bacon is really good. It had a slightly sweet flavor... Maple, perhaps? That was a nice surprise. I don't know why people in this town can't season their hash browns. Like others I've come across these were bland until I put some salt and pepper in them... Needless to say, hash browns were underwhelming. Next time I'd ask them for extra crispy, too. The crispy parts were nice. There is no choice of toast but the sour dough they gave me was good. Was doughy and crispy. The scramble itself was decent, covered by a blanket of cheese, which was nice. I was craving a little more flavor and went to look for hot sauce but couldn't find any. Suggestion to management: Get some hot sauce! Oh, and also, I would have preferred plain half and half for my coffee instead of the partially hydrogenated oil, fake creamer they had. Not exactly fresh.

Overall, a decent, and pleasant experience. The staff was nice and the food came out fast and hot, so points there. The ambiance is playful on the inside and very clean. And thank you for not making the music obnoxiously loud. 

I think if they could fix just a couple of little things, this place could hit it out of the park. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! The so cal chicken sandwich was unbelievable. Everything was so fresh and refreshing! We will definitely be coming back and bringing others with us!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is excellent and the service is good. I love that they are locally owned. The prices are good and they have a nice variety on the menu. I have come in for both lunch and dinner. It was great for either."}
{"text":"The shrimp salad is ridiculously good! Everything I've had so far has been delicious"}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Best French fries in town!!!! Hands down!!! Excellent chicken strawberry and avocado salad. Burgers are awesome and did I mention best French fries in town???!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First all the good things! Lovely decor, fantastic service, and very clean!

Now, the rest of the story. It's almost a strip mall version of a popular, local, farm grill type restaurant but without the excellent food. 

When I walked in I wasn't exactly sure where to go, which never sets the right feeling for me when visiting a restaurant. Then it seemed likely we were to crowd around the little bottle neck of people huddled around wall mounted menu monitors to the right of the entrance. We would have liked to have a physical menu to read as we waited in line instead of watching people walk past us to line up. 

Despite our efforts to become familiar with the menu before leaving the monitors, once I got to to the pleasant cashier I couldn't remember exactly what was on the lettuce wraps I was considering. The cashier tried to help but obviously didn't know either because he listed ingredients I was sure weren't on the dish. I asked if there was any way I could see a menu and he handed me a poorly printed, hard to read, carry-out menu. I was forced to hold up the line while I confirmed the ingredients of the dish, again, not the feeling you want when visiting a restaurant for the first time.

Once we received our food I was disappointed to receive dry, tasteless chicken in my lettuce wraps. If it weren't for the sauce served on the side it would have had no taste at all. Pretty unfortunate since chicken is 9/10 of the dish.

My fianc√© liked his spinach and mushroom crepe more than I liked my lettuce wraps, but I don't think he was thrilled with it.

If I'm in the area will give them another try after I give them a little time to prefect their game. But I probably won't make a special trip unless things change dramatically.

I will watch Yelp reviews in hopes of seeing marked improvement as I would really like to see them succeed!"}
{"text":"If everyone finds out about this place I'll never be able to get in here to eat, but if I don't tell everyone about it, the business suffers.

I guess I'll share, it's really good, you're welcome world.  Get the Cuban."}
{"text":"Clean, simple menu, play dough for kids, kind staffs, small portion which I liked so that I'm not wasting any foods, strong coffee. Very spacious and relaxed atmosphere. Hope this place last because we loved it!! Only thing I want is more coffee selections but you can get a good coffee at Dutch brothers in the same complex."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to meet up when I am in this area. It's a clean, fresh, friendly atmosphere. The food is excellent and they don't skimp on the serving sizes. The bathroom was even clean, and picked up. They have seating for outdoor as well, in the shade of course. Great place to eat, food is always fresh."}
{"text":"This was our 4th visit and it never disappoints! I had the bbq burger which I've had before and it's PHENOMENAL! The sourdough bread is lightly buttered & toasted to perfection, they add green chilies, crispy bacon all to make a great flavor combo! I love that they change parts of the menu every 3 months with 'season changes' to keep it fresh & worthy of returning to experience more. The buffalo chicken wrap sauce is to die for - which they toss in garlic, cilantro & lime juice into the buffalo sauce - truly adds a whole new flavor setting. Individually owned, modern/urban style restaurant gem - I would love to see this place thrive."}
{"text":"Three stars cause some items are good. Like the bbq burger and some of the crepes. But I had to knock it for the spaghetti special I ordered. It was swimming in water down sause."}
{"text":"The food is so good, I will gladly drive the 30 minutes to come here. The sweet potato fries were perfectly crisp and my salad was delish. Will be back, have many things still to try."}
{"text":"Great variety of menu items. Quick service. As soon as you walk in one of the kind servers walks up to meet you and go over the menu and make recommendations. The owner is very kind and cares about service and his patrons."}
{"text":"I've been in a couple of times to Orchard Eats and find the food and atmosphere to be excellent. The restaurant is very new and took over the space of an old grease pit. OE  cleaned the place up and has brought some really great choices. It's like the food I grew up with and to see Steak Stroganoff on the menu with classics like burgers is just awesome.

If you want a great meal in a family-friendly atmosphere, I highly recommend checking out Orchard Eats."}
{"text":"If I had to describe this dining experience with one word... I would have to at least make it 2 words:  freaking awesome!

I went to the restaurant with my wife and 2 children tonight and right away we were by a teenage girl who was the cashier/hostess named Bonnie.  She had a helpful attitude,had a genuine smile for us.  So far so good!

The process: order your food at the register and then be seated Until the food is brought out to your table.   

I loved the fact that there is a large brightly lit menu right on the wall for us to make our order selections . I ordered the barbecue burger. my wife had the spinach/mushroom cr√™pe, daughter ordered the cheese quesadilla children's meal, and my son hadThe kids meal mac & cheese.  Once seated at our table, I observed right away that this was a very clean establishment.  The color tones and the lighting made me feel very comfortable. 
The food was amazing. My (Angus beef) barbecue burger came on  a Chibatta bun. The burger was served with fries that were Hot and crispy and just delicious.  My wife, a vegetarian, commented about how perfectly cooked the mushrooms were in her crepe. This is saying a lot because  when it comes to veggies,  she is one tough critic!

Wait time once food was ordered:
Food was delivered piping hot within 12 minutes. 

ALSO: There's a nice clean's fountain soda dispenser to refill sodas in. Self serve.

For dessert we ordered two items: whip cream and a nuttella crape- & the mixed berry Cheesecake stuffed crepe. Unbelievably delicious! One of the things that made these desserts so good was that they were not too heavy...and just the right amount of sweet.

Price: I fed the whole family for under $40 ( including desserts)
Parking: an abundance of parking 
I have lived in Mesa my whole life, and have never seen a decent restaurant anywhere in that specific vicinity-until now.
If you want a delicious comfortable dining experience:  definitely try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"love everything about this place"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and both visits impressed me.  Today I had a cup of to mate bisque soup which came with a side of warm bread.  Both were very good.  I am already looking forward to my next visit.  We had to leave room for a crepe, because you can't find those many places.  Bravo!  Well done!  There is nothing about this visit I would change.  Staff was friendly too."}
{"text":"This 5 star review is strictly for the sweet crepes! 

I tried the Nutella and whip cream, added strawberries! So sweet, light, and worth the try! But like I said SWEET! Perfect dessert for a winter night! 
I also ordered the crepe with butter, sugar, and lemon. I was disappointed that the lemon flavor wasn't more but it still was a yummy crepe!"}
{"text":"THE BEST! The guys there are super cool and nice. Very welcoming and polite! The kids size portions are perfect for an adult that doesn't want to eat too much! The food is beyond delicious!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my crepe here! We stumbled upon the place after dropping out pups off for boarding next door. The atmosphere is pleasant, the decor is beautiful and the food really was wonderful."}
{"text":"Delicious, quality fresh food. Not a big menu but what they do, they do it right. Little details such as perfectly cooked, green, crisp, fresh broccoli go a long way with me. The owner was so friendly and explained the menu. He obviously takes pride in his restaurant and it shows. I wish them many years of success."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey food, especially considering I'm not being waited on. The hot dog is $5.50, for a $1 hotdog. Just seems a little pricey from a strip mall, stand up restaurant."}
{"text":"The crepes are delish...everything else, mediocre at best. They don't have bottled water. Yuck! They don't have lemons to make the fluoridated Mesa dirt water taste any better. They forget to bring you lemons when you ask. I mean, c'mon, you have 1 other couple in the restaurant. You're not that busy."}
{"text":"The best food in the neighborhood. Love this place. The service and atmosphere is awesome. The menu selection is exactly what we look for."}
{"text":"The Reuben was really good, the Frye were crispy as promised. I had a bite of the mushroom swiss burger and it was juicy & flavorful.  I also had a bite of the strawberry banana crepes with nutella, rich but not too sweet like some places.  And the chicken tortilla soup was on point."}
{"text":"Not only is this place adorable, it also has DELICIOUS food. Last time I was here I had the spinach and artichoke penne with tomatoes and goat cheese, and if it was legal to marry food, I would have done it without hesitation. Yeah. It's THAT good. The crepes here are also perfection, and even though the food here probably isn't actually super healthy, it felt like it. You have my heart, Orchard Eats!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing. The crepes are good, but I had a burger and it was pretty gross. Over-cooked and the toppings were super plain. Don't expect to be wow'd. 

If you just want a crepe, then this is your place. The ambiance is lacking and looks like it was put together with a shoestring budget."}
{"text":"I have had several really good experiences there.  So far: The cheese burger--added blue cheese!  The vegetable crepe is great.  The steak/blue cheese salad is awesome.  The pan fried parmesan chicken was very nice too.  I am glad we have this joint in the neighborhood.

Just went again: had the cheese steak. They actually use Filet mignon. Pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner, delicious!  All 4 of the meals were great! Would defiantly go back for more,  ad would love to try the breakfast and crepes!!"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here for dinner recently after seeing the sign after stopping at the Dutch Bros. in the same plaza. I don't know if they are officially \"open\" yet or plan on having a grand opening, but we were the only ones dining when we visited.

The space is clean, bright and nicely decorated. It's a comfortable size with plenty of seating inside. As you walk in, there are flatscreen TVs/computer monitors displaying the menu. The dinner menu consists of crepes, sandwiches (burgers, chicken sandwiches, etc), some pasta and salads. Kid's menu is pretty standard with chicken fingers, a burger, noodles, etc.

Sodas and coffee are drink options. I thought with a name like \"Orchard\" Eats, they might have something fun like a juice bar, but no go on that one. How awesome would fresh orange juice from the many orange patches in that area be?

The counter service employees did not seem overly familiar with the menu, but I know they haven't been there long and they were very friendly anyway. We ordered the chicken marinara sandwich, their BLT with avocado (BAT, I think?), and the kid's buttered noodles. The food was done promptly, although the noodles came out without the fruit cup that was listed on the menu (and I completely forgot to ask after it, so no big deal).

The food was good - we especially liked the fries and my son liked the garlic bread that came with the noodles. Yum! I want to come back and try some other items on the menu. I think the crepes sounded especially yummy.

The drink area is set off from the main ordering area and has a good selection of sodas, two kinds of tea, coffee and things like extra napkins, sugar, etc.

The restrooms are a nice size and clean but no changing tables.

There is an outdoor patio but no seating when we visited. That would be a nice option in the future.

I definitely plan to come back in a few months and I definitely think they will get up to the 5 star range as they get going."}
{"text":"Came into Orchard eats with high expectations - very let down on the quality of food. Staff was friendly and helpful and gave us a few different suggestions on different items. I ordered the Alfredo and my wife ordered the BBQ burger. Within a few minutes our order was ready and served. The Alfredo was not great and it was runny - it lacked any zest and was not flavorful - it was bland. The burger that my wife had was cooked as ordered medium and was juicy. The flavor again was missing very mild and under whelming - the fries were definitely the best part of the meal. We ordered the pumpkin spice crepe and the strawberry with banana with Nutella - had high hopes - and at best I can say the came in average. Though in terms of preparation it looked like it could be in the cover of a magazine.."}
{"text":"Brought a friend here for a birthday lunch and Orchard Eats did not disappoint! 
We arrived at noonish to a bright, clean and somewhat empty restaurant. They have menus on the wall as you walk up to order. Don't worry! There is a big chalk board menu right above the register as well. :)
My friend got a (free) strawberry banana birthday crepe and the chicken, strawberry and avo salad. I ordered the chicken mushroom monterey crepe which comes with a house salad and a sweet vinaigrette. My son ordered the kids chicken strips with fries which comes with a fountain drink and fresh fruit (cantaloupe). 
You do have to get your own drinks, condiments, napkins and silverware yourself. I'm a pretty capable gal so it wasn't the end of the world. :P
My son loved the flavored syrups at the soda fountain. Big plus from him! 
The food arrived quickly and the server was really nice. He came to check on us during our meal as well
The food was excellent! My chicken crepe was hot and delicious and was stuffed with lots of grilled chicken! Really gooey and cheesey and mushroomy. The house salad was pretty much what I expected. Nothing fancy there but nothing bad. The vinaigrette was too sweet for me, but you live and learn. 
My friends strawberry banana crepe looked yummy, I didn't try it but she said it was good. I didn't try her salad either but it looked like it had a lot of grilled chicken!
Great place! Definitely will be back to try their chicken pita that I was eyeballing."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out on a night we couldn't figure out what to eat. Great idea!! Kinda slow for a Friday night, but we were greeted by the chef himself asking us if we'd been there before and explaining their menu, etc. They change their menu with the seasons so we tried a few things that will be going away so we can try more things later. All fresh, locally grown if I remember right. Very good food. I had the Shrimp pesto fettuccine and hubby had a burger. We were both very pleased. impressed. Crepes are one of their specialty items... yummo!!! Had to try them!! The Chef & another guy own the restaurant together. Their place is created out of the idea... what kind of place would we want to go to. 
Will be going back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite new place. I've been here twice this week so far! I've tried the Chicken Pita w/ Fries, the Greek Salad w/Chicken, the Pulled Pork Burger, and three different kinds of crepes. Everything has been great. The pita bread is soft and fresh, and the pita bread that comes with the salad is toasted and was perfect! The salad was very fresh.  The grilled chicken that comes with both the pita and the salad has a great grilled taste. The pulled pork has an amazing smokey flavor, but could use more sauce. When we gave them this feedback they said next time to ask for extra sauce on the side which is a good solution. All the crepes I've tried have been great, but the Nutella crepes were the best! They were oozing with Nutella! Oh! And last but not least - great music! I mean, come on, Wonderwall?! My only regret is that it didn't turn into a sing-along."}
{"text":"Yummy what we would call 'chic food'!!! 
Loved the Greek salad. The pitas were huge! The fries were delicious & the crepes so yummy!! 

Our came out in accurate & they had such great customer service. They went above & beyond to make things right! Loved our experience here! Great place for a girls night!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice in the last few weeks - first for breakfast, and today, for lunch. Breakfast: Oh my, the oat cranberry pancakes! So unique & I am sure they are healthier than most. They served a homemade buttermilk syrup. I really liked it - it was different and tasty, especially when you consider most places that serve breakfast do NOT serve real maple syrup, so this was very enjoyable. My husband loved his egg breakfast as well.
Lunch: I had one of their salads: The grilled chicken was so tender & had so much flavor.....and the salad was huge & was very good. Lots of things like avocado, bacon, strawberries & a citrus dressing.
My husband LOVED his lemon cream sauce over pasta & chicken- said it was very unique compared with many pasta dishes he has had.
Dessert - we got the cherry cheese crepes - they come, one with cherries & one with a delicious creamy filling. There were two dollops of whipped cream on the plate as well.
So my husband and I would take a bite of the one with the cream filling, one with the cherry & dip in whipped cream & in our mouths it went! They put cinnamon in the crepes - a nice surprise.
We will be back as there are many more things we want to try - so nice to have something to enjoy again, that is not a chain restaurant. Keep up the good work Orchard Eats!!!!

Visited February 2016"}
{"text":"We are new to this breakfast place in mesa not only it's a seat yourself we will bring your food to your table kinda place way different than Vegas she didn't ring up my husband order!' Anyhoo food was a 4 gift I'm seeing that Phoenix has a lot of those type of eating establishments to me when I'm on vaca I love being waited on! Some yelp users do tell you your on your own in the restaurant! They did give us 5 off card for next time so will give it to our business partners!!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a yummy local restaurant near home and saw the reviews so I'd thought I'd give it try. I ordered the so cal and a salad that were supposed to be their best sellers (can't remember the name). The first time the so cal and fries were delicious and flavorful. The delish sandwich made up for the wait because you could tell it was all freshly prepared with fresh ingredients. The salad was not bad but nothing special- the dressing lacked flavor.

I really am between 3/4 stars but the second time I ordered 2 so cals, expecting the same quality, the fries were soggy and old. The sandwich also tasted differently (old probably and a little bland) 
The crepes are delish but each extra topping is mostly $1 up. I spent the amount of a crepe on just toppings alone. They were really good though!"}
{"text":"Good fresh, food with friendly service and comfortable atmosphere. A little pricy for what you get and not a whole lot of options (but some) for people with food allergies. Had high hopes for this place. It was not very busy, which kind of surprised us too."}
{"text":"First time here we were greeted at the door - nice smiling faces. At first check in on Yelp we got a coupon .
Searing was open with Booths & tables also a patio :)
There are salads wraps sandwiches & burgers. I had the chicken strawberry avocado salad , the dressing was delicious everything was fresh.
My 9 year old had the chicken fingers & loved them she said we're definitely coming here again. (She's picky)
Some highlights are syrups for the soda, coffee & tea. There was also vinegar for the fries! :) we will be back for their signature crepes (Nutella what!?!?) and for breakfast!"}
{"text":"First time here and I have to say I loved everything I tried, buffalo bacon ranch wrap was really good I love the real bacon inside. The oj was really fresh and tasty. My friend loved the two eggs your way he said everything was good, the second Saturday half off crepes is a sweet deal so had to try it and glad I did the strawberry banana was awesome. So all in all the food was great! I'll be back."}
{"text":"My latest addiction: orchard eats' strawberry and grilled chicken salad.  It has bacon, grilled chicken, avocado, candied walnuts, cucumber, red peppers, strawberries and a yummy citrus dressing.  I'm a bit of a foodie so don't mind my obsession with this delicious restaurant. If you haven't been yet, you have to go.  Wait, their breakfasts are amazing too and they have cinnamon roll crepes and pumpkin pie crepes. During the holidays.  Seasonal crepes all year round.  Happy day!"}
{"text":"Just OK.  The coffee from the hot pot was great.  The bacon was good, although had no discernable smoke flavor.  The pancakes were a disappointment primarily because of the syrup.  It tasted like syrup that had been diluted with water by 50%.  It was runny and had a watery consistency."}
{"text":"I have always overlooked this restaurant in my neighborhood but today I gave them a shot. I ordered the french toast and paid the extra $1.50 for the banana and nuts. Which was not given to me when I got my food. The syrup was like water. It was disgusting. It made the french toast wet and soggy. They also forgot to give me my orange juice. I did eventually get the orange juice but never got the banana and nuts. The service was fast, the staff was polite, and the decor is cute. But I won't be coming back. The next time I'm looking for a trendy breakfast restaurant I will just go to First Watch where I know I won't get wet french toast."}
{"text":"My husband and I have become regulars at this place.  We love the salads here. Strawberry avocado with grilled chicken is my favorite but I also like their Greek salad.  My husband really liked the blackened salmon on our last visit.  The crepes are excellent as well with the berry cheesecake crepe being the winner! It is a very friendly place with excellent service.  We have never been disappointed after eating here!"}
{"text":"I really, really want to love this place. 

I have been here 5 times. I feel like that qualifies me to have a pretty decent basis to leave a review. I have tried something different each time. The thing that drives me crazy about this place is the menu. It hangs on a wall on tv screens. It's not near the register. So when you walk up to the register and are deciding between two things, you have to ask the cashier questions. I have had a different one every time, all teenagers. They are always nice, but they NEVER KNOW THE MENU. I have been told the steak and blue cheese salad has.... Wait for it.... Blue cheese. But upon receiving it, I find out it actually doesn't have any cheese at all. It's just a dressing. I was also told the chicken, avocado and strawberry salad didn't have any other ingredients. It actually has bacon and walnuts and cucumbers, none f which I am the biggest fan of. 

Also, the staff tends to disappear. It's like there is some magical room they go into that has sound proof walls. Today after I got my salad, they gave me this gross citrus dressing and then they went into the panic room, and I stood at the register for 10 minutes saying hello really loud. Finally I heard a door close and the kid was back. The chef also came walking back in the restaurant from the front door. It was bizarro. 

Also, the ramen which I have had both as a take out and inside the restaurant never has enough broth. It's always a ton of noodles, like 4 pieces of broccoli and an afterthought of broth. It's ramen people, give us broth! 

Otherwise, the food is fresh, which I appreciate. I hope they get their shizz together. These are things that can be fixed. I am hopeful, I love non-chain restaurants. I will continue to support them as my neighborhood restaurant, and I am rooting for them. 

Side note, the kid just gave a tweaker a water cop, and he has been sitting at a table across from me staring at me and itching his face like crazy (in between leering and smiling at me while mouthing words). It's creepy. Please, don't water the local drug addicts."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We stopped by on a Tuesday evening for dinner. Our kids (5 and 3 years old) had a lot of energy from being inside all day and had trouble sitting still. While my wife and I were looking at the menu on the wall, a server brought over a couple of boxes of clay for the kids to play with. They sat quietly while we made our meal selections and waited for the food. That is awesome customer service! Even if the food was bad, I would still recommend this place based on that. However, the food was excellent. Kids got spaghetti and meatballs which they devoured. I got the sweet pork burger which was excellent and my wife got a bacon, lettuce, avocado on a croissant which was also very good. I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Yum!  We were in the area looking for a place to eat breakfast on Yelp and found this little jewel of a restaurant. I had the Banana Cream Pie Crepe. Soooo good.  The hubby had the Mountain View Scramble that had a nice mix of fresh vegetables. It came with bacon, hash browns and the sourdough toast was delicious.  Nice employees, clean, colorful atmosphere.  Upbeat, joyful background music."}
{"text":"Food and presentation were  excellent. I ordered the filet and bleu salad; steak was perfectly cooked, well seasoned and the veggies were crisp and fresh. A little heavy on the dressing but easy to correct next time. Service was a little lacking in enthusiasm and warmth but prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"I ordered a salad and my friend ordered the beef straganoff. I didn't think my salad was too great. But he loved what he got!
The next time my fianc√© and I went I got a sandwich. It was soooooo goooooood!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Had lunch there today and although it's a bit pricey, the food was worth it. We ordered a pulled pork sandwich and chicken quesadilla. The fries were the best I've ever had and the meals were more than filling. The place was clean and ordering was fast. We will definitely go back (especially since it's so close to us)!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice with my 3 year old son and friend. I get the artichoke pita and it is THE BEST. My son actually eats his meal (which is rare for him when we eat out). My friend is dairy free and it seems to be easy for her to order something accommodating. Definitely my go to place. I also love that they serve fresh seasonal fruit and have the cutest kids cups!"}
{"text":"I just moved to this area of Mesa and have been looking for a good restaurant near my house. Saw this place  while getting gas and decided to stop in. It has a nice-sized patio and the interior d√©cor is really cute. The guy at the counter was friendly and helpful. They had a lot of great sounding options but I went ahead and ordered the filet mignon salad. It was a good portion for the price and everything looked really fresh. Overall, a really delicious salad with butter leaf lettuce, filet mignon, bleu cheese, sauteed onions and bacon and crispy carrot tendrils. My only complaint is that they serve whole leaves of the lettuce so you're forced to cut it up yourself and they serve the salad in portions: lettuce here, steak here, onions, etc. here.. So everything has to be cut and mixed by you. Not a huge deal but I was picturing the judges from the show Chopped saying \"I would've really liked to have seen this all mixed together..I needed a more cohesive bite.. \". Other than that small complaint, I really liked this place and can see myself coming here regularly. So glad to have found somewhere nearby that can be my new go-to!"}
{"text":"No French toast? Really!?! How can you run out of bread?!? Run next door to Bashas! Oh, and the fruit platter listed on the website? Yeah, they didn't even know they had one! But they graciously poured some fruit (watermelon and grapes) onto 2 small bowls and wahlaa! Fruit plate!!
Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time tonight and everything was great! It was clean and cute and the food was DELICIOUS!! I got the artichoke pita with sweet potato fries! Not to mention the staff was very friendly. This will def become my boyfriend and I's new \"place\"."}
{"text":"Great local place with extremely friendly staff, quick service and great food.  So Cal chicken, cheeseburger and sweet potato fries were all great.  We will be eating here again."}
{"text":"I had eaten here after they first opened and have only returned for the crepes. I had ordered the pork chop and the were paper thin, bland and over-cooked. Pork chops, especial bone-in, practically cook themselves and I had ordered mine cooked to medium. Oh well, so I didn't like the food... But the crepes are life changing, which is why I rated them higher than I would have otherwise. Based off other reviews maybe I had been in on a off day and should give it another try.... We will see."}
{"text":"This place is a gem in Mesa! My fianc√© and I go here all the time and it is always worth the visit.

Today I went in for lunch, I had the TAB (turkey avocado bacon) and it was so delicious. The sandwich has nice thick slices of bacon and avocado as well as a tangy cranberry aioli. The serving size is a little big but honestly no complaints about that. The server offered to do fresh fruit instead of fries and it really was perfect for sitting out on their patio in the sun.

Their crepes are really great as well. We usually come for breakfast/lunch so I'm not sure how the dinner is but I highly recommend picking this place over the limited chain restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"We've eaten here quite a few times and every time the food has been great. They have really good pancakes. My favorite sandwich, the bar b q pork with Cole slaw, unfortunately they don't have anymore. I just had the so-cal sandwich and it was delicious. The steak salad was really good too."}
{"text":"Seriously, did you say you haven't eaten here?!?! Why not! The service is beyond reproach! The owner is sweeter than the crepes they serve and wait.... The Executive Chef.... Scrumptious! That's right! I said it! S'more Crepes? Yeah, he went THERE! They have won us over! Try the steak stroganoff! Worth every calorie!  Yum."}
{"text":"Fun and delicious menu, friendly staff and a nice atmosphere. We had the Monterey mushroom creep and a sweet pork burger and they couldn't have been better!"}
{"text":"Orchard Eats has great food for any time of day, but our favorite has to be the breakfast! They serve AMAZING breakfast meats, crepes and pancakes. Their bacon is seriously to die for. We had them cater our baby shower brunch and they went above and beyond providing us with delicious food for a very affordable price. Everyone raved about the food for weeks. We recommend them now to everyone we know!"}
{"text":"Plastic plates and cups? Not sure how this place ever got 4 stars.  My coffee cup was filthy inside so I asked for a new one which was just as dirty but also had lipstick on the rim. Food was ok but not much."}
