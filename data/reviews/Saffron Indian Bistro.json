{"text":"My wife and I came here for dinner on Friday and were very pleased with our experience, especially given the dearth of good Indian places in the NW Valley. It's not strictly traditional Indian, but everything we had was good. We had the Samosa Chaat to start. The Paneer Tikka Masala and the Lamb Vindaloo were both very good as well, and I really liked the Firecracker Chicken. Similar to chicken you would get at a Chinese place, but better! Naan and rice were both fine. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really good food, but not that family friendly. I wish they include rice with the entree. Who would order Chicken Marsala without rice? I had to pay $2 extra for rice (rice is cheap).  That deducted one star.  I rather they did not give me the free appetizer and just give me rice with my meal."}
{"text":"Since the Maharaja Palace closed abruptly.. Glendale lost its only authentic Indian Restaurant for miles around, and I've tried them all.  Saffron Indian Bistro is the closest thing to quality Indian food on the West side of the I-17.  Notable mention however, was their new hire Alex, who masterfully handled the entire dining area with such engaging class and anticipation of the diners needs.. His being hired was a true stroke of genius to have represent the restaurant.  Alex relayed that the cook likes to create dishes with  edgy cross-fusion, that I'm sure is very unique and  tasty .. I however was really craving a good chicken korma, so the addition of corn, chopped green beans, and cubed carrots was disappointing, but the base flavor was still good enough to be able to pull it off to where I would order it again."}
{"text":"The first Indian restaurant we've tried since moving to Arizona...  coming from the SF Bay Area, we're pretty spoiled regarding Indian food.  Well, this was excellent!  Good service, great food, friendly owner, best naan I've had in ages."}
{"text":"The chicken wrap was really good this is one of the best places to eat Indian food. The chicken in the wrap was really good and was cooked well, it was not tough at all. The waiters are very nice and recommend the best choice if yo never tried the place. And the cook was really cool and had this badass hair cut."}
{"text":"Our first visit and certainly it will not be the last. Our expectations were greatly exceeded. The food was excellent and we like how they have diversity in the menu selection. The prices were reasonable and decent portions."}
{"text":"Saffron Bistro is amazing. Fast friendly service.  A large group of went for dinner and the staff were great. Try the Pani Poori, Papri Chat and the Paneer Pakoras.
Also recommend trying  the fish is very fresh and flavorful. Chicken is super moist and flavorful. 
The best and only Indian Bistro in Phoenix. Thank you for a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"The best place to have the WORST Indian food in AZ. Absolute waste of money."}
{"text":"Wow! This place has delicious Indian food and I almost drank the Coconut Shrimp curry! They have very nice ambience and great customer service.. Loved it!"}
{"text":"We tried this today and we both loved it! We went for the buffet and it looked small but what was out was quality and delicious. The young woman working the front was friendly, helpful and right there if we needed anything at all. It's our new favorite place. It was affordable as well. We will be going back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Today went for buffet lunch,feel like should never go again to this place.Nothing tasted good including Naan. Not worth for the money."}
{"text":"This is a place of excellence in Indian true food. Family owned small place with people that put love into the preparation and the attention toward customer. I Will be back many times. Well done!"}
{"text":"We started with an appetizer, Paneer Pakora. Could have just ordered this and had a yummy meal! Seasoned perfectly, sauce that came with them was way good as well! :-)
Garlic Naan, to die for yummy!
He ordered the Dal Makhani Hot, again great dish , nice seasoning and not too Hot. He told the waitress he will try Very Hot next time, brave man!!!
I ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala...OMG was this so very tasty!!! Again, the chef knows his way around those spices and I wish I could eat this dish every day!
Phillip was checking out the spices that were in the aromatic long grain rice and thought they smelled like smoked cedar. The waitress came out with some fresh ones in a little container for us to take home to try because the chef asked what Phillip was looking at so intently and wanted to share the magic. 
How cool is that?!?
This place is like two miles from our home and since so close and food so great, we will be back soon!
Thank you"}
{"text":"First time having Indian food, tried the buffet and everything was sooo delicious!!! Cranberry soda was also awesome! No pictures because I finished everything lol but judge for yourself. You won't be disappointed:)"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken biryani with very hot spice level and it was burnt and not good..I am not going here again.even chicken pieces are not tasty at all. Expensive too. For that price , they could make it better."}
{"text":"Great experience! 
The portions were generous and the staff attentive and friendly. The food was delicious and well priced! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I am  planning to surprise my girl friend on her birthday, as an Indian girl she love's Indian food. While searching for some good Indian restaurant and a friend of mine suggested Saffron Indian Bistro.

I decide to take her at  to Saffron. When we arrived it turned out that she had already visited this place and was aware of the menu. We ordered Panner Jalfrezi in as the main course and it was really AMAZING!!! We also tried Chat and Pain Puri both were rich, flavorful and perfectly cooked.
 
Its a really good place and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Phoenix area. I tried couple of others around Glendale but none were upto the mark. Loved their butter chicken. The lady who served the food was very friendly. Decor was nice and welcoming too"}
{"text":"This is the worst lunch buffet I ever had in any Indian restaurant in the valley. Very limited options and tasteless food. Will not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Great place, had the garlic naan and firecracker chicken. both were amazing, the service was great and extremely fast as well as friendly. This will be a regular stop from now on."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service not so much which is why only 3 stars.  Only One server who was working her tail off while the manager sat on his a-- at the bar playing on his laptop. Did I mention he was sprawled on the bar including his laptop bag? Too bad cause the food is good"}
{"text":"Love going to Saffron, the owners are really nice, and the food is hands down fantastic. It can be affordable, but I usually go all out, because the appetizers are so good and the homemade naan is a must. Everything is pretty delicious, but the Papri Chaat and the Butter Chicken are winners (I could drink that sauce). If they have the Mango Lassi available it pairs great with the food, especially if it's spicier. The service is a little slower than a chain, but that's because they make everything fresh. 

One of the added bonuses is that the menu is extremely allergy friendly. It's labeled really well and the chef/owner cooks everything separate, even if your distinction is vegan/vegetarian."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Staff is great! Food is amazing.I have read a few reviews on here and I have to disagree with a recent post about the \"a la carte\" (which you didn't spell correctly ) as a person ordering food you should ask questions and if you are looking at a menu and it does not state comes \"with\" then ask. Also you should know that \" a la carte\" means you are just getting that item. I have not had a problem with the amount of food given, I have noticed recently that they have different togo packaging but it seems to be the same amount of food. I love this place and will always go there weekly!"}
{"text":"The food was good the first time, so we gave this place a second shot. Again the food was good, but the service was terrible. The owner was a racist, and that highly offended us. Even though were before another family, she gave a table to them coz they were American and we were not. And she was totally ignoring us, as if we were not there. Our order was taken at the end, and served even later. She is forgetting that customers will be regular, only if the service is good. We sure are not going to this place again."}
{"text":"Husband and I decided to search for an indian restaurant for date night, and found this little gem! All the food was delicious, we had chicken tikka masala, naan, sumosas, and papri chaat which was recommended by the owners wife. Let me just say the flavors on that papri chaat were unlike anything we've ever had, it was so good!!!! We also tried the Mango Lassi which was very yummy but more of a dessert for my taste. We had a great conversation with the owner's wife, she was super friendly and helpful with the menu. We highly recommend this spot for amazing indian food!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down amazing food! My dear friend found this gem on trip advisor and we gave it a go for lunch. Everything was perfectly spiced, the meats were moist and flavorful and the red wine sangria was perfect! We started with the Papri Chaat and samosa. The Papri chaat was amazing! The flavor combination of the yogurt sauce and the crispy wafers was perfection! Next we did the chicken wrap and fire cracker chicken. My mouth is watering now just writing about theses dishes! The meat was so good, tender and delicious with just the right amount of spice. Even the French fries served with the wrap were to die for! The best I've had since moving to Phoenix, and at an Indian restaurant no less!! The icing on the cake was the owners wife came over to talk to us, asked how we were doing, how our experience was, and if we were interested in trying a new drink they were getting ready to unveil. It was a rose water milkshake that was the perfect end to an amazing meal. Perfect consistency of sweetness with the refreshing after taste of rose, and excellent for the hot Phoenix summer! Excellent job Saffron for amazing customer service and equally amazing food!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have found Saffron! I recently moved to the area and have been trying to find my go-to Indian food place and  I can confidently say this is it. I've been here several times and I consistently receive amazing food, excellent and friendly service and a clean and welcoming atmosphere. Everything I've tried is delicious, HIGHLY recommend. The owner and her daughter are so sweet, I feel I have made true friends."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Different than other usual Indian restaurant. Me and my wife love to go their and owner gives very home feel and great service."}
{"text":"If you love Indian cuisine you must stop in and meet the team at Saffron.  It was my wifes birthday and we wanted to try a new spot for our curry fix.  The restaurant was very clean with a very inviting decor.  It was quite tonight but it was also early on a Tuesday evening.  We ordered fried cheese appetizers and the lamb tika masala, curry coconut shrimp and vegetable briani rice.  The food was the best curry we have had in phoenix.  The chef and his wife were very nice and they were genuinely concerned that we were completely satisfied.  We will be back often as this is now our spot...  They also have the cutest little girl whom will welcome you to saffron many times...

Thank you for a great evening and dinner"}
{"text":"Ate here last nite with my friend. First time for both of us. We throughly enjoyed the food. Desserts were too sweet for us. Friendly service. Place was empty except for us. I have lived in the area near by for 4 years and just heard about Saffron. It's located  in a little strip mall. Definitely a hidden jewel. Will be back. Try it for great Indian food."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place as I was shopping next door, I'm glad I went in. I was greeted by the owners wife, Preeti, she made me feel very welcome. I had a great dinner, the service was quick and the waitress was friendly as well. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious chicken korma and lamb biryani! Vegetable korma was the best I've ever tasted.
When I ordered over the phone, they were very helpful and were immediately willing to accommodate a dietary requirement. The owner's wife is the sweetest and chatted with us while we waited to pick up our order. 
I will definitely be going back again and recommend anyone close by give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, we had some appetizers (the Nacho like one that I can't remember the name of was particularly good), vindaloo, and tiki masala were all amazing. It's a tad pricy, but it's really tasty and high quality food. Great service too."}
{"text":"I come here once with my wife about week ago and it was very good. I ordered the chicken tika mashallah with the spicyness and was not disappointed, she got chicken tandoori and the indian selection of brews and desserts was excellent as well. Highly recommend for good service, amazing food with a huge variety of flavors (due to many spices and authentic home cooking etc). I am usually into middle eastern food and have never tried Indian but I am positively surprised and will be returning."}
{"text":"Food is excellent! Definitely give it a try here. Yes, the other Indian places around this area are not that great. However, when I went to this place, the service was very slow. There were not that many people inside. It was my family (3) and 3 other families inside.

Also, the price is quite high for the portion size. And I can't believe rice and the bread are extra! You know how restaurants have a side of bread or rice with meals? This one didn't so it was disappointing. Luckily, the flavor of their food was excellent. Hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Just tried this place. Got a to go order. I honestly wasn't expecting much because I have been disappointed by many indian restaurants but it's only a couple blocks from me and I thought I needed to try it. And to my surprise, it was actually very delicious. Samosas are amazing. I love them. The naan was pretty good as well, not the best I have had, but very good. And i ordered the chicken tikka appetizer but when I got home I opened my bag to find chicken tikka masala. I was okay with it though because the tikka masala is one of my favorite dishes. It was pretty good. Not as much cream as the normal tikka masala dish usually has and a bit more of a tomato base than normal as well but fairly good. I think the place definitely has some potential and I hope business picks up (or maybe I just went in on a very slow night because there wasn't a single customer in there besides myself). Its very resonably priced! Its probably the cheapest indian food i have found and some of the best as well. I will definitely be returning again."}
{"text":"Great food. The service and the foods amazingggggg. Took my wife and kids for dinner and was very happy. Staff was also very helpful"}
{"text":"Authentic food with great service. Also one of the only places I've seen that has chaat, which is a rare commodity."}
{"text":"Simply Awesome!! Super fresh food and the service was great. The BEST around in  Glendale/Phoenix area.
Chaat, Chicken tikka Masaala and Garlic Naan are all amazing. The food seems to be cooked with great detail to ingredients, flavor and freshness. Highly recommend this place. Best find in town."}
{"text":"Great place and great service. I have been to indian restaurants all over the states and this is hands down one of the best places. I never eat/order lamb but took a bite of lamb curry here and boy was it delicious. The food is fresh and delicious. The portion is just right and if you are not fond of spicy food ask for extra mild (I did that and it was perfect). Definitely going back often."}
{"text":"I am giving 1 star because we never even tasted the food. There was one waitress and she was completely overwhelmed. I actually felt sorry for her. We waited 10 minutes just to get our menus. We waited another 30 minutes and still nobody took our order. We paid for our drinks and left. Unfortunately, we had to leave in order to get back to our office. We set aside time to specifically try out Saffron but were disappointed. Maybe we will try again in the future."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have not had much experience eating Indian food and decided to try this place tonight for take-out. It was so flavorful! The Chicken Tikka Marsala and Fire Cracker Chicken were hits (we are lightweights so we ordered \"mild\"! Great service (ready in 15 minutes for pick-up) too. We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food , fast !!!! I am lahri food taste kinda a guy , and this place has the correct spices to make it exactly that way. So hands down one of the better paneer sabzis I have had in Phoenix. Try paneer jalfrizi, good stuff even the mild version has the perfect flavor. Keep p the good work !!!"}
{"text":"I've been in Arizona for almost 4 years, eaten a lot of Indian food, and would rank this as my number one spot. It's not \"authentic\" Indian food, but it is imaginative, flavorful, and modern. 

Apps- The traditional samosa is solid, but I would recommend the samosa chaat. The yogurt cools off the spices of the samosa, but the outside retains its crispiness. The bhel puri and paneer pakora are also a good way to start off your meal. Like many new age restaurants, they have their own version of \"Indian fries\" which were ok- if you are in love with fries try them out, otherwise go with the traditional Indian apps. 

Main courses- The wifey and I usually do 1 chicken and 1 paneer dish. Take your pick  of the butter masala, tikka masala, or saag- they are all good, but the butter chicken is our favorite. I also highly recommend the channa masala (pro tip get the bhatura aka indian fry bread to go with the channa masala). I do wish they had more vegetable options- no okra, cauliflower, or eggplant dishes...but I guess that's what you get with a \"modern\" Indian restaurant.

Haven't tried the dessert or drinks so can't comment on those, but we always get the raita (flavored yogurt) to eat with our curries. If you are like my sister and can't eat spicy food but don't want to hold the crew back, put a dollop of the raita on your spicy curry and you'll be good to go. 

If I could give 4.5 stars I would. This place is not as good as Indian food I've had in Houston, NYC, or Toronto, but it satisfies my curry craving and beats out the surrounding South Asian spots. Also, 10% student discount! The people are always nice, and my water cup is always full. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Indian place and saw this restaurant was highly rated and close to my apartment.
Items ordered for take out:

Rice
Garlic Naan
Samosas
Dal Makhani
Chicken Tikka Masala

Rice: The rice was cold and hard. Gross. Threw it away.
Garlic Naan: The naan tasted okay. But it was stale/hard.
Samosas: The samosas are huge and pretty tasty. They make them fresh, according to the hostess. But, they forgot to give us chutney. Bummer.
Dal Makhani: Pretty good, nothing special, but tasted good nonetheless.
Chicken Tikka Masala: The chicken was tender, the sauce was really good. I would order this again.

Everything looked really tasty. Also, just waiting in the restaurant for our food, the decor is nice and everything looks really clean. The portions are large (We had a lot of leftovers) and the hostess was really pleasant.

I really wanted to like this place. They've only been open for 5 weeks so probably have some kinks to smooth out. Maybe I'll try it again after some time.

I called the restaurant and let them know about the rice and chutney. Whoever answered the phone offered a free order of rice the next time we come."}
{"text":"Small but excellent place. Service is good and food is tasty. Would love to come again."}
{"text":"So pleased to find this little spot! Food was delicious,  great service and clean restaurant! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian food places I have ever been to. Their rice is perfect every time and well seasoned. I love their currys and their orange chicken. The kids menu has great portion sizes and your 2 children could share 1 item to eat. I highly recommend this place of your looking for something new and delicious. Also some of my favorite drinks there are the ginger lemonade, the mango lassi, and the chai hot tea."}
{"text":"Tried this place the other night.. It's brand new but decided to take a chance. Glad we did.. Had the chicken tikka masala and the lamb vindaloo, rice and garlic naan. So good!! Next time we will probably just get the regular naan. It was $1 more for garlic on it and it didn't taste much different than reg. naan. Took quite a while for us to get our food but we figured that was because it was probably their second day open. Staff was very nice and prices weren't bad at all and serving sizes were pretty good. Will definitely be going here again!"}
{"text":"Restaurant ambience is good. Tried dal makhani & rice. Taste is ok but it cost $13. Its price for a curry & rice. Normally in most restaurant curry will comes with naan or rice but here we have to order separately."}
{"text":"Very close to the house! The food was great would highly recommend! Slow afternoon, but the staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"Good food great service. Atmosphere is lacking. It's a little like eating good Indian food in a take out shop. The sauce could use a little more spice, the yummy flavorful spice not the hot type. But over all it was good."}
{"text":"Really small and basic buffett. Food was just okay. Not sure why this place gets 4 stars; at least not as far as buffet. No chutneys; no fresh vegetables; no desserts on buffett.  When I came in they asked what I wanted to drink. Water did not arrive until about the end of the  meal. Even watched them serve drinks and naan to other tables that arrived after me but not to me? Never got any naan even though I heard her tell patrons after me that it was included. Hmmmm...okay. Average food and poor service. Maybe just  a bad day for server  but I won't be back to find out. No reason."}
{"text":"Very very slow service .. less variety.. not hygienic (found hair which was compensated by 10% discount).. I am from India, and I know how Indian food looks/tastes like."}
{"text":"I love Indian food and the one I usually go to closed. But I found Saffron and I'm so glad I did. Love the place, Butter Chicken is so flavorful, everything is."}
{"text":"I ordered the paneer wrap, and it was one loud the best I've tasted. The service was quick and the server was helpful. The only reason I'm not giving a 5-start is because I've only been here once and it was when there was only one other table occupied. But I definitely look forward to introducing my friends here!"}
{"text":"Lemon drop infused martini was one the highlight for the evening.

Started with most popular Samsosa and papyri chat on recommendation of \"Sachin\" a great owner host!!

Main course!!!! Lamb chops.....with ginger and coriander...yumm
Coconut curry shrimp was great
Combine with biryani.........oh my god

Will be back"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and they have a bar now!!! The prices are fair. I'm a very picky Eater and so are my friends, but everyone I always invite (because it's my favorite place) has no complaints and they actually enjoy the food!! Its really far from my house but the drive is worth it."}
{"text":"I figured that if my doctor of Indian descent recommended this restaurant that the food would be good.  The food is not good, it is DELICIOUS and freshly made.  Other restaurants will cook frozen chicken to prepare their food, but this is not the case at the Saffron Indian Bistro.  The chicken tikka masala is out of this world and will melt in your mouth as you savor very tender pieces of white meat seasoned perfectly.  The rice is not the standard white rice found in other Indian restaurants.  Instead Saffron Indian Bistro offers a tasty rice expertly seasoned.  The waitress was very friendly and guided me through the menu to make the proper food choice.  The restaurant is kept clean, and the atmosphere is inviting."}
{"text":"Hard to find good Indian food on the west side. All of the food was delicious and my order was  ready on time. This will be in our regular food
 rotation. Very satisfied!"}
{"text":"We tried samosa chat and chole bhatura. Food taste was really fresh and flavored. Cozy decor with very friendly staff and owner. Worth going again."}
{"text":"This is our new \"good to\" Indian restaurant.  The Indian buffet is the best I've ever had especially for the price.  What I liked most was the basmati rice, the two or three meat entrees and the vegan entrees.  All the entrees were  delicious.  Naan was brought to our table that was very good.  I can't speak for the Indian desserts  because I was just too full to try them."}
{"text":"Great, great food. Super friendly staff as well. We went for the lunch buffet and weren't disappointed at all. We've been looking for a new Indian place since our old favorite closed down. Saffron Bistro is going to fit the bill nicely."}
{"text":"Very good food! 

I am not an expert on Indian food, I couldn't tell you the name of what I ordered, but it was delish!  The flavor is full and the spice (if you want it) is perfect!  If you are wondering about trying this place, GO FOR IT!  You will be pleasantly surprised.  I've eaten at a few other indian food places, and this one is at the top of my list. 

With that said, dont expect too much in service if you dine-in.  During our first visit, we had to wait 10-15 minutes for our drinks because they had to get ice (huh??!?!).  And, the wait staff didn't communicate too clearly the reason why or that our food would not come out together.  It was kind of a mystery, but we left with full stomachs and have returned since.  If you don't want to deal with poor service, they do have take-out."}
{"text":"Food is good but will not say is the best. I had the Hakka noodles and it was not tasty. I had also ordered a vegetable Manchurian which was very sweet and nothing similar to the Indian Chinese cooking. Hence would not recommend those. But I did like the channa bhatura."}
{"text":"This restaurant truly is as good as it gets!  Great food, great people, and great ambiance!  In the three weeks it's been open, we have been at least 4 times, and it just gets better every time! 

If you haven't tried it, you're missing out!  Once you do try it, you'll always want to go back!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. 

This was my first time here but I'm sure it won't be my last! I haven't been to many Indian restaurants so wasn't sure what to order but the waitress suggested the paneer Tikka wrap and it was delicious! 

Larger portion so some is going home for dinner. The fries which came with it had a slightly sweet taste which made them addictive.

Would recommend this gem in the corner of the plaza."}
{"text":"We were visiting Arizona last week and were craving good indian food. This is a great little restaurant, pretty new. The management and staff is amazing, with great service. 
Food was great. We ordered some appetizers - samosa chat, paneer pakora and dumplings. All were great and very fresh.
The fire cracker chicken has got a nice kick, my wife loved that. 
All in all - good place for quality Indian food."}
{"text":"First time visit but not our first time getting Indian. We had the butter chicken and chicken tikka masala. Both had a significant portion of meat! The cardamom rice was great and the naan was also good. Overall the dinner was very good but not amazing. My main complaint was the fact that the kulfi we ordered was completely frozen and inedible. We pointed it out to the waitress but she just said that sometimes it is like that after it comes out of the freezer. So that really bothered me. I wouldn't have ordered it if it was going to be like a solid block of ice. Lol. Also the waitress messed up our payment which was slightly frustrating.  I would have given this place four stars if it wasn't for the issues with dessert and the check. We will likely be back because the food was really good and give it another chance."}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend with a friend and found this place on yelp, amazing desi food!! Papri chaat was excellent, imli ki chutney exactly how my mom makes it! Paneer that tastes just like chicken! Definitely a place to try if you're in the mood for bomb butter chicken and paneer tikka masala!!"}
{"text":"The first time I went I was pleasantly surprised by the delicious food.  The 2nd time I went, the food made me sad.   The service is great however.  I'll try it again sometime, when I'm out of other more proven options for great Indian food."}
{"text":"Wonderful, wonderful, WONDERFUL!!  Very tasty food, great service. Go, just go!!  Big group, we tried a lot of the dishes  all great."}
{"text":"I chose this place based because it was open after 230pm and I was craving Indian food.
I was not disappointed. I ordered the lemonade with ginger essence for my drink, a samosa for my appetizer and the chicken sriracha wrap for my meal. I love me a samosa. It came out with a spicy mint chutney and the tamarind chutney. 
I liked the lemonade a lot. It was a little sweet for my taste, but that's because I don't like sweet drinks. I think normal people would find it to be perfect. 
The wrap was interesting. Loved that they used naan to wrap this chicken and pepper mix. I got it a medium hot spicy and it was exactly what I wanted. It came with French fries. I actually dipped the fries in the tamarind chutney and thought it was pretty good! 
I met the owner and head chef. He was super nice and inquired about my visit. Like how I found the place and did I enjoy the food. I thought this was a great spot! 
Bonus for me, I checked into this place on Yelp and got a 10% discount offer too."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Saffron expecting it to be pretty good based on the reviews we read. We were not disappointed! It was outstanding! The black pepper shrimp with yellow curry, made extra spicy per my request, tasted even better than I imagined it would. We love this place and cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We visited Glendale last month and stopped here for early dinner and  started with papri chaat next tandoori chicken. For main course chicken and mughlai korma with rice and naan. Overall food quality was good and will come back if in the area again."}
{"text":"Off to order another delicious Samosa Chatt. $6.50 for a filling/ tasty lunch. Love this place! Fresh food finally here on the north side."}
{"text":"Delicious food at a very reasonable price.  I had the Paneer Jalfrezi - a dish with which I was previously unfamiliar.  It was rich, flavorful and perfectly seasoned.  The chai was also lovely."}
{"text":"I tried Saffron Indian Bistro based on the reviews by other yelpers.  I typically eat a good breakfast but on this day, I didn't.  By the time we arrived at the bistro, I was famished.  I could not make a final decision on a dish so I opted for the buffet.  Good choice.  The buffet has 6 dishes to choose from which includes rice and naan.  The food is tasty.  I would try it again just to make sure I'm not giving it a good review because I was so hungry!  ;-)"}
{"text":"Stopped by here as they showed up on my Entertainment Guide and figured I would give it a shot.  Be aware they say they were not aware they were on there and made us feel awkward from the start.  The restaurant was full with customers but only 1 server.  Service was extremely slow and they were not attentive to any table.  The food was fair but definitely over priced.  Not sure where the 4 stars came from but we will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and delicious food! I ordered chicken tikka masala and butter naan, and I loved them. I definitely visit there again!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I see this restaurant on Yelp and I get excited to try it since it had mostly good reviews and it's close. I take my daughter there for lunch and we get there at 11:15. They open at 11:00 or I should say that they claim to open at 11:00 because they weren't open at 11:15. I looked through the front window and I can see people in the kitchen. I called the restaurant but no one picked up. We waited for another 5 minutes, when one of the workers, holding the phone to his ear and getting direction from whoever was on the phone, unlocked the door and apologized that they weren't open yet because they have a problem. Ok....
He took my name and number and told me that they will make it up to me. 
We left and went somewhere else for lunch. An hour later, I get a call from a woman at the restaurant letting me know that the restaurant is now open.  I thanked her and let her know that we went somewhere else and her answer was 'oh, ok' and she hung up.....
I don't care how good their food might be, their customer service leaves a lot to be desired.  There are plenty of very good Indian restaurants around, won't be going back to this one."}
{"text":"Visiting family from Colorado and stopped in after hearing how incredible this place was from my family. Hands down the best \"Authentic\" indian food in the Phoenix area! Met the owners, very friendly and welcoming. The chicken wrap was incredible!"}
{"text":"Let me just start out by saying I love food and I am pretty adventurous when it comes to trying new things, but nothing has moved me to ever write a review until I ate here.  

To start out customer service was phenomenal.  The staff was knowledgeable (and enthusiastic!) about the food and made great suggestions based off what types of food we enjoy.  

Next, the food was an Indian/American fusion which I was not expecting, but was pleasantly surprised after eating a few different things. We started with a Somosa and Paneer Pakora that were delightful; the Somosa had a little spice, which I loved. Then we had the Saag Paneer and the Paneer Wrap (can you tell we like cheese?).  I had some garlic naan with the Saag Paneer, which went well with the spinach and cheese in the dish.  The Paneer Wrap was my favorite though with its pickled sauce that just fit perfectly with the wrap.  

I am definitely going back because I was too stuffed to try their Fire Cracker Chicken or any desserts!

5-Starts, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Outstanding indian food , one of the best places out there . Small phoenix best kept secret you must try this place you will be happy you did !"}
{"text":"It was so good. We tried a little bit of everything on the lunch menu and it was fabulous. I got everything on the spiciest level and it was"}
{"text":"Only because we found a coupon we though we would venture out and behold! A hole in the wall hidden gem! My wife and I love Indian food so, off to Safron we went. I was admittedly a tad concerned when through the glass window a not so Indian atmosphere. To late to back out now without wife wrath. The venue lacked...about everything, but it was clean and the food on the various tables looked wonderful. Our server was very helpful and offered plenty of help. We had decided (before we even got there) on garlic naan which became a delicious garlic cheese naan. Safron's tikka masala was probably the very best ever delicately seasoned that you could clearly taste the savory Indian spices, none overpowering another; and served with a choice of rice. We selected basmati which was excellent and neither over or under cooked. Done just right. We also had an Indian Chinese Fusion dish, Hakka Noodles which was a moderately spicy noodle dish sauteed with chicken. Wonderful blend of spices, onion and red and green peppers. Oh, and the serving sizes are quite generous. 

Safron has been open for about 4 years. Had it not been for this coupon we would have never known about it. We also were told that they have a weekday AYCE buffet from 11-2. Check with them for details. We both gave Safron 2 thumbs up as already looking forward to our return. Maybe we'll see you there. If so, wave and say \"Hey Howard!\""}
{"text":"We've eaten at Saffron once. The food and service was very good, particularly the Amritsari Fish appetizer, which was amazing.

We\"ve wanted to try the lunch buffet for a while, so we stopped by on a Sunday. Their websight does not post times for the buffet, so I figured they most likely didn't offer it on weekends, with the expectation that buffet seekers would just eat there anyway. 

Not only was that the case, but they also had a sign on the sidewalk advertising the lunch buffet that they didn't have. I took the picture on Sunday, when they have no buffet. Bait and switch is just a dirty business practice. 

For a truly amazing Indian lunch buffet with published times, try the place at the northeast corner of Bell and I17."}
{"text":"This is a small family run place in an unassuming strip mall, but the food is anything but unassuming.  The owner is very friendly, enthusiastic and welcoming. Ask her for recommendations and she will hook you up! She brought us a variety of things and we were impressed by every single dish. We were also impressed by the quantity, and pleased we had enough for leftovers to take home-yum! We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on a Sunday night with no one else in the restaurant.  The customer service was phenomenal, the flavor of the food the same.  However, I ordered the chicken tikka masala and it tasted great it the amount of chicken inside the sauce left you wanting more. Hardly any chicken, and way more sauce left over without chicken.  Other than that I ordered the haka noodles for my wife and those were amazing but once again super cheap with the chicken. If this place just gave more meat with the sauce I would give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Highly recommend trying! The chaat was delicious, fresh and crispy. The dinner was delicious and very high quality food. We tried the garlic shrimp, chicken makhani and biryani. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a 10star.....
 Excellent customer service&& the owener/cook made. E something they didn't have on their menu that I've been wanting but haven't found in Phoenix.. (Chicken Tikka Marsala wrap).
I will most definitely be back!!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Food is super delicious...great flavor and taste! But the menu prices are way overpriced in my opinion. I've been to many Indian food restaurants in the valley and you'll pay much more here than you will elsewhere with similar quality food. At least the food is great otherwise I would have been very disappointed with this restaurant. Staff was super nice as well so I will most likely go back, just not as often as I do to other Indian spots nearby since I am not willing to pay so much on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a buddy on the recommendation of my wife's OB of all people, and was very happily impressed.  The food was DELICIOUS!  The chicken tikki masala was very good, but I really loved the chicken vindaloo - it was a very pleasant spicy that did not linger and was very flavorful!  Between that and the garlic naan I left fat and happy!  The gal that took our order was very pleasant and didn't pester us or anything, and a nice lady that appeared to be the owner came out and said hi and asked our opinions on the food.  I left feeling they really cared about delivering a high quality meal, and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very cute hole in the wall restaurant. The food was delightful and inexpensive. Our waitress was very helpful and thoughtful. We had chicken and lamb tiki masala which was delicious."}
{"text":"One of my favorites! Everything on the west side seems to be a chain restaurant with very little flair or flavor.

This restaurant has great food, a friendly staff that has obviously been carefully selected,  and a comfortable, casual atmosphere. 

Literally, the only complaint I can make is that I wish they were open on Mondays! I'm off on Mondays, and like to eat lunch out. I guess if that's my biggest complaint, it's not too bad, huh?"}
{"text":"AMAZING food. It's fresh, super flavorful, creative, and filling. The flavors are well balanced and addicting. I do not usually like Indian food but this is something much better. I cannot say enough about the chef specialty items and the Indian Chinese fusion. The French fries that come with the wrap are like a funnel cake french fry. Try try try!!! The restaurant is clean and modern. We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious in both atmosphere and food. We left our food selection to our server and she did not fail. The chicken tikka masala was by far the best I've had! The price creeps up there but the family dining atmosphere makes it easy to share."}
{"text":"The buffet on Tuesdays and Fridays is to die for! I come here basically every week and I have never been disappointed. Unlimited nan and rice and then they usually have 2 chicken entrees, spicy cauliflower (so good!!!), another vegetarian option, and a few more things. I personally LOVE when they have this veggie entree which is potatos, red and green bell peppers, peas, etc in a curry-type sauce. So good! They also have a loyalty/stamp card so every 12th buffet is free. I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"One word.. Lamb! This is a great family owned Indian  bistro with amazing food. We had a little of everything with not one disappointment. Our top recommendations are the lamb chops (best lamb we've ever had) saag paneer, papri chaat and samosa puri. Ask for the mango drink it mixes deliciously with all the amazing spices.. End It with pistachio ice cream and your life will be complete!!"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet consisted of 6 main entrees, rice and home made bread that was made fresh upon our arrival. The 6 choices included chicken tikka Marsala, chicken vindaloo, a black bean lentil dish that was great and three other choices.  It was nice because there was a spicy dish, a couple of savory dishes and one that was slightly sweet.  The buffet was $9 with $2 for the ice tea.  The service was quick and friendly!"}
{"text":"Not coming back! 

Stopped by for their \"all you can eat\" lunch buffet. I have been to tons of Indian restaurants for the buffet and this is the first place that charges for a different type of Naan. All you get is the basic buttered Naan, no garlic, no chilli,  nothing without paying for it. Absurd. Then, they charge if you want more of the basic Naan! That's not AYCE. I suppose it's still all you can eat, they just charge you if you want to eat more than they give you. Then I tried to \"check-in\" on Yelp and get 10% off and that wasn't honored. Seeing as how I am obviously Indian, when people ask about Indian food in the area, I can be sure to mention to avoid Saffron. 
The food itself wasn't the worst but I can find much better places to eat that won't nickel and dime me for my money."}
{"text":"Very friendly family environment, amazing samosas and mint chutney! The lamb tikka masala and chicken korma is so great! Perfect mix of spices for flavor throughout he beginning, middle and end of each bite. Would (and will) definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I picked up carry out on a Sunday afternoon. I was craving Indian food Saturday night and found this place on Yelp. It was the closest Indian restaurant to my house and had good reviews. I was very happy I found them.
The staff was very friendly, but I was there for take out and was not waited on. But she seemed attentive to the other seated customers.
I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and Hakka, Garlic Naan, Mango Lassi, and the onion and ratta \"condiments?\"
I thought the food was excellent. I ordered medium hot, but next time will go for hot. I got the eye sweats but not to the levels I seek.
The chicken was moist and the Tikka as tasty.Just a little light on the seasonings compared to what I would have made at home. Bottom line is that I really liked the food and will be back."}
{"text":"Wow! Fantastic food! The lamb chops are a can't miss!! The vindaloo was the best I've had in a while and I lived the tikka masala. Samosas are made greasy and are excellent."}
{"text":"Late night \"I want something different\" meal per my girlfriend.

Food was OK, the menu is all a'la carte. The ambiance is modern decor. Ordered the samosa as an appetizer and it was fabulous and cheap ($2). My girlfriend ordered the chicken tikka masala (as always when trying a new Indian restaurant) and our waitress courteously inquired how spicy she wanted it. I was surprised the receipt actually reads \"spice level: mild\". However, I ordered lamb vindaloo and ended up with chicken vindaloo instead and not nearly as spicy as requested. I attribute this to the fact that the co-owner's daughter, aged 2, was acting up inside the restaurant which made it difficult for her to take down our order correctly. Cute kid, but this is not the place to be an evening day care.

Close enough to get an ethnic cuisine fix if necessary, but not wildly impressed."}
{"text":"Even if the food was sub par. Which it wasn't  the customer service and friendly staff truly make this a welcoming place. Take out or dine in.   Excellent service and the spicy lamb tikka masala was excellent!!"}
{"text":"The food that comes out of this restaurant should probably be illegal at the federal level. It's addictive. You'll find yourself craving it -even when your on vacation and have no way to have it, but your trying to figure out how much it would cost to have Uber eats deliver in Florida...."}
{"text":"This was actually my first time trying Indian food! They had a nice sized buffet that my husband ate off of & we were pleased to see how fresh everything looked. We ordered firecracker chicken, tandoori chicken, garlic naan & rice off of the regular menu. The firecracker chicken had such a wonderful flavor but the chicken reminded me of frozen breaded nuggets, maybe they had been sitting a bit? The tandoori chicken had such an overpowering lemon flavor that none of us could eat it. I nibbled off of my husbands plate & LOVED the butter chicken, tikka masala & chicken vindaloo. The rice was a pass for me but I will definitely be back for the butter chicken & garlic naan!"}
{"text":"When I hear, amazing, the best, fresh, tasty...etc I am expecting really great things. 

I ordered garlic naan, samosa and channa masala.
Naan was hard by the time I got home. Garlic was sprinkled on so either this thing was microwaved or made first and sat out. 
 The channa masala was so dry, there was no gravy whatsoever. When I opened it, it smelled very good however it was too dry to eat. The picture is not the same. 

Lastly the samosa was definitely microwaved...it was cold within a minute of bringing it home. 

People may say that I should have eaten there however I have ordered takeout from many places before, this isn't my first time eating indian food."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, and some of the best Indian I've had. The owners are extremely friendly and accommodating. The food is rich, flavorful, and authentic. The location is small, but ordering to go is easy and fairly quick. The garlic chili naan is absolutely to die for. Great vegetarian options (I can't speak for meat-eaters here), and they are also knowledgeable at pointing vegans in the right direction. I highly recommend this gem, and I hope that you enjoy it and become a regular, as I have! I'm completely hooked."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Very clean, casual dining room.
We will return to this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Great place - food was perfect.  Very clean and friendly.  We have gone about a dozen times in the last few months.  Love the fact that I don't have to drive to the east side for Indian food."}
{"text":"This is our second time here and the food was perfect again!  The place is clean,  the service is superb and we WILL be back!!"}
{"text":"I would rather never go to a restaurant again than this place. It took fifteen minutes to get a drink and appetizer and they wanted everything is to order the main chooses at the same time but asked for more time. Took another ten minutes to get the drinks and five for the apps to start trickling out. There is only one server but there are only three tables with people. I expect faster service in a packed restaurant. At this point we are over a half hour in and I still haven't ordered dinner and gotten one of the three naan bread and the fries. They were out of samosa. Fourth minutes to order dinner. 
If it wasn't for the fact that the people I was dining with refusal to pay for what we got and leave I wouldn't have had dinner here. They don't bring out the entrées at the same time and don't indicate why there is a delay or  when it it is coming. As it stands the food tasted good. But the place should not try and act like a restaurant. It should be call in orders for pick up and delivery only. Avoid if you aren't doing one of those if you don't have hours to spend waiting for food."}
{"text":"The food and service is out of this world! The Chef owns and operates this bistro, and puts extreme pride into every dish that comes out. I became an Indian food fan because of this place!! I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Chicken was stale. The vindaloo is basically canned tomatoes with cumin. Biriyani was vindoloo sauce with rice and stale chicken. The naan tasted like it came from a prepackaged manufactured frozen container. The fire cracker chicken tasted like the chicken from a frozen chicken nuggets with Asian sauce. Idk man. Not going back. It hurts to give a harsh review but idk. Save your money."}
{"text":"This, is, hands down, our favorite Indian food in town! They make it perfectly spicy for my husband, perfectly mild for me, and perfectly delicious every time! Just let them know how hot you like it! Plus the owner lady is very welcoming and sweet! We're moving soon and we're going to miss this place!"}
{"text":"OMG.... the best restaurant in the area... I loved it so much, after our lunch, I ordered food for the whole weekend to go.....     culinary excellence.    Thank you for the referral,  MeeShell.  Both the staff and owners are amazing"}
{"text":"The owner is annoying, the 3 times I have been there, she was sitting eating/drinking and yelling at her daughter to not do this and that. Then she walked to us and offered my friend a smoothie and told us what we should write on yelp about the resturant... with respect to everybody who wrote a review, I do think most of these reviews are unauthentic."}
{"text":"First of all Indian food is not eaten ala carte. A gravy dish is $10, then if you want chicken add $3, then you need rice or naan as well add another $3. In the end you have spent $16 and you only have one single dish. This is all backwards. Don't eat here! Go to a buffet where you can for maybe $13 eat all you want and try multiple dishes. I walked out"}
{"text":"Fantastic bistro and I'm usually not a fan of Indian food.  Food stands out because of the freshness I think.  Flavors are clean and bright.. not overwhelming like a lot of Indian food I've had.  Food is also on the light side, not overly greasy. 

I've been here three times before and each time the food and service were great.  Atmosphere is clean and bright.

There is nothing I've tried so far that I haven't liked, but my favorites are the Tandoori Chicken Tikka, the fire cracker chicken and mama's cauliflower.  

I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Really great wings are made here. The food is really good. We have tried several many items"}
{"text":"The food is good here, but the combination of price, quantity of food and location didn't match up very well. I ordered the Chicken Biryani which was quite good. The chicken was moist and very well flavored. The butter chicken that my friend ordered was also very good , but at $12 a plate, I think it should either come with rice/naan or there should be more chicken.  I would  come back if the prices were more tad more reasonable."}
{"text":"Having only ever had Indian cuisine once before and not liking it, I was nervous about trying it again. A friend had recommended it to my husband and we were very pleased with his previous rec. of a Thai restaurant. After eating at Saffron Indian Bistro tonight, my husband and I cannot wait to go back! 
Rishma was our server and highly recommended some of the most popular dishes. We started with the Papri Chaat and were absolutely amazed with the flavor profile and how incredible it was. Wow! We couldn't thank Rishma enough for telling us about it. 
For dinner, I ordered the mild Chicken Tikka Masala and really enjoyed it. My husband ordered the medium-spice Mughlai Korma which he liked and said it was almost too spicy. This from a guy who enjoys a bit of heat.
We also decided to go with the Garlic Paneer Naan and were very pleased with that as well. It was also nice to leave with some leftovers. We'll be getting dessert next time, but I seriously want to go back tomorrow for more Papri Chaat!"}
{"text":"On a whim my wife and I decided to try this restaurant.  Having minimal expirience in Indian cuisine we were quite hesitant.  Upon being seated we were greated warmly by the owners wife and given a full run down on their offerings.  She was SOOO helpful!  The suggestions she gave us upon learning our tastes, were exceptional!  For myself I had the Lamb Vindaloo, while my wife had the Channa Masala; we also shared an order of Papri Chaat for for our appetizer. 
     I must say the food was outright 5 star delicious.  The depth of flavor was astonishing.  The Papri Chaat was a refreshing mixture of sweet, spicy, creamy and crunch.  I have not had anything like it before, it was like an advanced nacho made a trip to India.  
     As for the main course the lamb Vindaloo was a hearty, very filling dish of spicy curry and lamb.  Nothing too crazy, but exactly what I was looking for in my first dip in Indian cuisine.  It had a bold flavor of onion and red pepper, with just the right amount of kick.  The chunks of lamb were large and really added a rich meaty flavor to balance out the dish.  We also added a portion of naan and rice to our order.  The naan was very tasty, and the rice was cooked perfectly.  
     To add on to an incredible meal, the price was extremely fair.  I was actually shocked at how little we spent. Im honestly in love with this place and plan to return as soon as possible."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here for the first time and let me tell you, the food is AMAZING!!! If I could rate more stars, I would because it's that good! Also, the customer service alone was fantastic. The lady who took my order (maybe the owner?) was so nice and cheerful, just so positive. We got the butter chicken which was so creamy and the vegetable korma which had perfect flavor and all the right veggies. Both so flavorful. Highly recommend. We will definitely be back soon :)"}
{"text":"Great food. Great flavor. Freindly service.   Will be visiting ofen."}
{"text":"I freaking love saffron I go for the chicken tikka masala made with extra love and affection from the forever fabulous owner. I'm gonna get mushy on you now. He puts all he has into making his food delicious and making you crave for more. I swear I wanted tikka masala everyday for two weeks straight. I'm usually served by Taylor which fails to get me my water with LEMON but she is a joy to talk to and knows what she is talking about. I wasn't impressed though. One time I came in and the co owner was there and bossing one of the waitresses around. It looked like she was about to cry. Very upsetting to me.
Over all it's a must eat place. I highly recommend Saffron if you have a hankering for some delicious (made with love) indian food."}
{"text":"This place is small but has absolutely amazing authentic northern Indian food!!!! The owner came out and personally helped all of us pick the perfect dish for all of our own personal tastes. Highly highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone! 5 stars all the way. SOOOO delicious I was dancing in my seat"}
{"text":"Not coming back. This is worst Indian food I had in AZ. All you can eat buffet was so bad and the food was very bland."}
{"text":"Worst and so expensive!!! 
Who would pay 10$+ for only masala sauce with no rice and no bread. 10$ for a sauce not including chicken or beef!!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place... The food is unique and absolutely delicious!... Do not go there with out ordering the Papri Chaat...its an incredible flavor sensation that will satisfy every flavor component! Also...the Rose Milkshake...or a better name...Heaven...it is so light and velvety.. They import the rose oil and it is to die for...whether your looking for an intimate spot for a date night...or a casual lunch...its here...best food in AZ! You can taste the chefs passion for his work with every single bite!!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Indian food and was very excited to find a new small shop in my neighborhood.

The samosa was piping hot on the outside and cold on the inside... was told it was made fresh so it would take 13 minutes, something was frozen so the word fresh may be subjective.

Saag Panir was... incredibly, thick. I think thick is the word. The puree was so incredible fine that it was close to being a mush. The seasoning was on point, but texture... not so much.

The lamb vindaloo was underwhelming. The vindaloo was perfect but the lamb was so tough it couldn't be cut with a fork.

There was no ice in the restaurant so we waited 20 minutes for our drinks while a waitress ran to the store to buy a bag of ice.

Pricing is steep compared to the quality of the dish. Service is good. Food is not at all what I would consider restaurant quality.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been to many Indian Bistros but when this new tiny one opened near the Asiana Market we decided to check it out.

We started with Shami Kabab, They were Chicken Lentil Croquettes that were tasty and came with a terrific mint chutney.

We shared Chicken Vindaloo and Chana Masala (chickpea stew). The Vindaloo was spicy with a building heat and the Chicken in was extremely tender and moist. The chickpea stew was tasty.

We also shared rice and Naan. The Naan seemed like it was made fresh to order.

The portions were very large and we had enough food for 4 meals.

I note I don't eat Indian Food Often so I don't know how the food stacks up to other Indian Bistros but based on the quality of the Chicken preparation and the Value I feel they are deserving of four stars and are worth a try when your in the area.

I plan to return it's great this new place opened!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the Phoenix area. I drive 40 minutes to get there and it's well worth it.  Can't go wrong with anything on their menu it's all wonderful."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night and ordered off the menu as there is no buffet for dinner. That was fine because the chef in the kitchen knocked it out of the park. I've eaten Indian food many times and in multiple cities and this stacked up as one of the best anywhere. The chicken tikka was awesome as it had a character of its own and did not taste like every other place. It had the stamp of an excellent chef wielding spices like a boss. Hubby had the lamb chops which were marinated in awesomeness and cooked to perfection. The garlic naan was fresh out of the oven delicious. The restaurant is tucked away in the corner of a shopping mall and very cute and clean inside. Just look for the asiana market and then look right. Worth the trip from anywhere. I can't wait to go back for lunch. Service was caring and attentive. Go and see for yourself but go hungry, you will want to keep eating long after capacity is reached."}
{"text":"Had the butter masala with lamb, garlic naan, paneer. Everything was unbelievable. This place has gotten better over time. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Not a big Indian food fan but I love their chicken tikka masala and I always order that dish with side of rice. Their garlic naan bread is also very tasty. My girlfriend's favorite is their beryani.
Had some past issues with them for postmate deliveries I guess employees need to have some training on it. Overall great place and great food."}
{"text":"This place is hidden gem. I never visited this place for 3 years as rarely found the parking in front full, so carried a negative impression about this place. None of my Indian friend had visited this place was also a sign. Today I happen to be here and I ate the best Indian food in entire Phoenix. $10 \"thali\" is reasonably priced. Though limited selection, food was finger licking good. Food is made to order and you can request the spiciness of the food while ordering.

Service is a little slow but who would care for delay when you are eating at best Indian food in valley. May be they should tell patrons about expected time.

Last but not least, it is the first Indian restaurant I found which doesn't close after lunch time. A must visit for any Indian food lover."}
{"text":"A wonderful New Indian bistro. Don't let the name 'bistro' scare you. From the friendly staff who greets you at the door to the delicious
Creation delivered to our table it's an amazing culinary experience. You will only see the freshest ingredients used and portions are very generous. My favorites are the samosas and Paneer Jalfrezi. Oh can't forget the garlic naan too!  I look forward to the chef expanding the menu in the future! You will go back craving more!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Reasonable prices. Their chicken makhni hits the spot, def get that with garlic naan. I would definitely recommend this place. They also have lunch buffets from 11 am to 3 pm for about $9. Great food, great people."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch there with friends.  Very fresh indian dishes and some unique variations that had amazing flavor."}
{"text":"Ok, let me start with AMAZING!!! This is my second time visiting this restaurant and I didn't think it could get any better than the first time and sure enough it was! We got the butter chicken, chicken tikka masala with garlic naan and the paneer wrap all extra spicy and it was just so delicious. It was so hot and fresh and the prices are unbeatable for the HUGE portions they give you! We have enough left overs for 1-2 meals! Crazy! The staff is all so nice as well! If you haven't given this place a try yet you should! You won't be disappointed!! Pictures from both times we came.. soooo yummy!!"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly good food, if you want to eat good Indian food trust me this is the best one out in Arizona, I recently moved in from NJ, I been to several Indian restaurant in Glendale and Scottsdale area, None even come to near the quality."}
{"text":"First time eating lunch at Saffron with group of age range 16 to 90 years old, with little experience in Indian food, but all in agreement that the surprising combination of colors, textures, and spices resulted in wonderful, memorable flavors. After eating out together at three fine restaurants in a row, Saffron was the most fun and stimulating, where we could easily share our choices with each other. The simple atmosphere was transformed by this delightful meal! PS you must try the Papri Chaat appetizer-- there's enough to share."}
{"text":"Best Chaat in the city!  The restaurant is small and quaint and the service is superb. The food is fresh and authentic.  Food to definitely try include: the Papri Chaat, Samosa Chaat, Dhal Makani, and Matar Paneer."}
{"text":"great people and amazing food! the naan bread is the best in valley"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Indian food place to eat. Been eating here for the past 3 years! The vegetable beryani is one of my favorite"}
{"text":"Excellent korma! We requested vegetable tiki masala which wasn't on the menu and they happily whipped some up for us. Great garlic naan and happy smiley people. We are full and happy!"}
{"text":"My mom and I love this hidden gem restaurant. The appetizer tandoori murg, then lamb in bechamel madala sauce, chicken coconut curry and the Mughal masala baingan."}
{"text":"We ate there today for lunch! The food was wonderful. Perfectly seasoned and prepared. A definite return is in order."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food I've ever tasted on the West Coast! Their all-you-can-eat lunch buffet is definitely well-priced for the amazing food they leave out. I personally recommend the butter chicken, chana masala and aloo mater. Worth a try if you're new to Indian cuisine and definitely worth becoming a regular!"}
{"text":"I was really pleased with the location, the service, and the food. We started with fresh made samosas and then I had the Chicken Vindaloo with garlic naan. It was great! The chicken was very tender."}
{"text":"Great food.  Amazing appetizers.  We asked for medium-hot spice and it was perfect.  Friendly, helpful staff who make you feel as though you're family members.  We will definitely go back and eat our way through menu."}
{"text":"Enjoying our street marinated chicken & chicken vindaloo immensely! The owner is in the kitchen cooking and his wife & gorgeous little girl are keeping us company. Such nice people, such good food."}
{"text":"GREAT Indian food! It is a bit pricier than other Indian restaurants in the area (and they charge for rice), but it's truly delicious.  The ambiance isn't much, but it's wonderful for takeout."}
{"text":"Got a takeaway, once we got home we realized there was no rice  I've never had a curry not come with rice. We don't live close, so just made some white rice that we had at home- food was cold by the time the rice was cooked. Over all good food but $35 for two curries and two naans (idk how much they charge for rice) is a little spendy for what you get."}
{"text":"2nd time visiting for dinner, we waited too long from our first visit! We enjoyed an appetizer that was like Indian nachos, delish! We ordered the butter chicken, egg plant in curry sauce and garlic naan. All of it is delicious and perfect portions! We will be back very soon. Highly recommend this place for everyone who enjoys ethnic food."}
{"text":"Calling Saffron a restaurant is like calling Disney Land the State Fair. Saffron is an experience! From the moment you walk in, the aroma, decor, and environment are all incredibly authentic. I've been to numerous Indian restaurants throughout the valley and Saffron Indian Bistro is on another level. 

As for the food, calling it delicious is an understatement.. and that's not just limited to the Indian dishes. The asian fusion options are excellent and shockingly good for what seems to be a restaurant specializing is strictly Indian cuisine. 

Personally, the garlic naan, along with butter chicken, lamb chops, hakkah noodles, and most the other dishes I've tried make Saffron a MUST for any foodie visiting or residing in Phoenix. 

You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food at this place the first time. 2nd and 3rd time was horrible when I ordered to go. You might get good food when you dine at this place. I wouldn't recommend delivery or pickup! These days I only order appetizers as they are some what consistent with those."}
{"text":"My wife and I were not impressed with the food at Saffron. 

My wife had the the Chicken Tikka Masala. It didn't even taste like CTM normally would. It was bland and reminded me of what you would expect from a frozen dinner. The chicken had a weird consistency and felt like a hard boiled egg. 

 I had the Lamb Vindaloo. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. The lamb was tough. There wasn't any onions or peppers in it. 

The Garlic Naan was bland and tough. I don't know how you screw naan up. 

 The basmati rice was good but it was a small portion. 

There are so much better Indian food restaurants in the area. I suggest you go there. 

 On a side note my wife and I both had stomach problems for the next few days after eating there. I'm guessing it was the chicken."}
{"text":"Italian chicken parm was my favorite until my friends brought me here! Now I crave the butter chicken! On top of that our favorite server, Anica, is so amazing she always remembers us when come in. She knows what we like to drink and usually asks if we want our usual?! Love the place!"}
{"text":"The best Indian food I have ever had!  The owners are fabulous and were so nice to us.  We were in Scottsdale for a work trip and I was lucky to bring to of my partners to this amazing place!  We will be back and will spread the good word of this fabulous place!  Fantastic eats; great people!"}
{"text":"This is a new Indian restaurant in North Phoenix. The set up was normal, nothing too special, and its located in the corner next to Asiana.

I had the black pepper shrimp and the Indian chicken masala, with naan and a samosa.

The samosa was prepared fresh and was tasty. It could use a little more spice.

The black pepper shrimp was really good. Very well spiced, tasty, and fresh. I will definitely eat it again.

The chicken was poorly cooked and was mediocre at best. I do not recommend it.

Overall, a solid experience, not a hit, but a good spot for its location."}
{"text":"Wow...this is your choice for first rate authentic Indian food.  And in Arizona, who knew?"}
{"text":"Good Indian food. Not a bad location for peoria and glendale. Service is wonderful as well. They are always kind and nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and the food is amazing. For vegetarian, they have plenty of options. Owners are super friendly, definitely recommending coming in."}
{"text":"Saffron is our favorite Indian Restaurant. The service is great, the prices reasonable, and the peons are HUGE. This easily makes two meals. It's a nice little mom and pop style joint, not fancy, but comfortable and super clean. The management are friendly and genuinely seem to care about whether you enjoy your meal.
I give this place five stars because it's awesome!"}
{"text":"I was at Saffron yesterday. Best Indian food in town. I was impressed by their service and decor too. You all should try their pani puri, papri chat, tandoori, chicken tikka masala, garlic bread and all.  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Unimpressed at all. 3 stars only because the food was decent at best. (Wife says it only deserved 2). The first time we tried this place was on a Saturday night at 7 pm and the place was completely empty. I read the reviews before we chose this restaurant and for the most part they were favorable. Once you walk in the Chipoltle inspired restaurant with 50's jukebox like music in the air,  you notice the Indian writing along either walls.  Kind of weird because unless your Indian, there's no way anyone can know what it means. What's weirder is that its in some freshly inked, bad tattoo type of font.  After reviewing the menu which was somewhat pricy considering the ambiance, we ordered   the pepper shrimp and chicken vindaloo. Rice and nan are a la carte.  Portions were small for the price. The dishes were tasty but nothing impressive. Nan was very plain and the rice had no character. No chutney in sight to spice things up either.  All in all, the food was decent but pricy considering the small portions and the lack of an authentic Indian restaurant setting. Most likely wont be back. There are much better options on the west side."}
{"text":"Omg first time coming to this place and the food was amazing! We got the firecracker chili chicken, chicken vindaloo, naan and samosa. Everything was amazing but I wasn't crazy about the samosa. Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Indian street food at its best! Glad to find this gem while visiting some family in the Glendale area. The big difference in the food compared to Other Indian restaurants was the freshness. There was no \"microwave\" about it. 

We got some free papad to start with. Then came some papri chaat which took me to some local gully in Luknow! The flavor fusion was amazing. Golgappa was next and the best part was for us was to make it ourselves. Most other restaurants serve you fully prepared which makes the golgappa really soggy.

My best item was the lamb chop. Yumm yumm yumm! I have never had such yummy lamb chops anywhere in the US. And of course, there was some Indian Lemonade to compliment that with.

Kids had masala chips (fries) which was a hit among them.

A definite go for anyone looking for fresh and yummy Indian food in Phoenix/Glendale area."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Definitely the best Indian food I have had in Phoenix. The restaurant itself was very clean and the service was really nice. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Its not a easy thing to get this type of food right. My wife and I do mostly home curry sauces but when we go out we eat at Saffron. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We ordered Malai Kofta, Vegetable Jalfrezie and Garlic Naan. Everything was great and adequate in quantity. The taste was surprisingly different than most Indian restaurants in the vicinity. 
Also, the Mango Lassi was heavenly. Do get it if you happen to be here. 
Overall, the service was fast and the waitress was knowledgeable.
Recommend it!"}
{"text":"Literally came for a snack and ended up having a full meal. Seriously my favorite place for Indian food (other than home). Always feel welcome and the food is fresh and delicious. 
I love that it's a family business and you can actually speak with the chef and owners. LOVE Saffron."}
{"text":"We ate here when it first opened and service was very slow and food was okay but the dishes all came out at different times.  Nobody got to eat at the same time.  Tonight we wanted Indian food and saw reviews were pretty good so we thought we would give another try.    We called to place a take out order and nobody answered the phone.  Looks like nothing's changed."}
{"text":"We don't know the area and came here based on the Yelp reviews. The food and service were great. At our table we had Chicken Tikka Masala, lamb Tikka Masala, and coconut shrimp curry. All the entrees were perfect. A great place!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! A group of us ate here for the first time last night and it was busy. Our host and waitress took great care of us and the owner's wife took the time to come chat with us. And the food! Incredible. Since there was a group of us, we ordered and tried lots of different things and enjoyed it all. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Me and my wife we are almost regulars at this place, we tried most of the menu and we could not find a dish that we did not like, prices are reasonable and the food delicious, I highly recommend this place for anyone and especially to people who want to try Indian food for the first time"}
{"text":"Tasty food and good service. And in a nice location right next to Asiana Mart! We had the tikka masala and biryani, both were very good. They also have a nice drink selection!"}
{"text":"As a native of Arizona, and the Glendale area in particular, I never grew up eating much Indian food. There just aren't a ton of options for it in the valley unfortunately, but I recently started working in the UK where you can throw a rock and hit a few curry houses and Indian takeaway spots on the way, and I've fallen in love with Indian food! I will be the first to admit the food I like is probably the more westernized Indian food, considering that chicken tikka masala is a uniquely British invention, but I love it all nonetheless. Saffron is the first quality option I've found in AZ that offers similar Indian food to what I've had in the UK. Now, I'll be the first to admit this is no Dishoom, and compared to the higher-end options on the London high street, this isn't going to measure up. I found the masala sauce to be a bit more sweet and tomato flavor heavy than some of the chicken tikka masala dishes I've had, but it was still tasty and it hit the spot to satisfy my craving for sure. Considering this is practically walking distance from where I'm from, I would consider it a success! They did get our order slightly wrong, as they brought us a wrong naan bread, but when we told them they offered to fix it right away and let us keep the wrong one. The service was great, the young woman working there was very nice and friendly and attentive. The ambiance is more of a hole in the wall type of joint, so no silver China here, but it's cozy nonetheless. It was slightly pricier than I'm used to, which was really my only complaint, as I was expecting it to be more on par with the Chinese takeaway places in the area, but it was a tad more expensive. Still, definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"My friend Bharat and I both are very well travelled and consider ourselves foodies. This is one of the best restaurants that we have been to, it is really well done Indian food with its own twist. My hat is off to the chef."}
{"text":"Really good food. Friendly staff. Everything we ordered exceeded expectation. Will be part of our regular Rotation going forward"}
{"text":"Having lived in the area near where Saffron is located all, I can say is I wish this place was here years ago. Started with the samosa and loved the great amount of filling and sauces it came with. Kids split the orange chicken which was quite a bit lighter and had a nice caramel crunchiness without all of the excessive greasy fried breading found in typical chains. Ordered vindaloo chicken, a spicy mix of chicken and dark curry. Very good flavor and the spice didn't over power the rest of the flavor. Enjoyed the vindaloo with rice and naan both of which were very good. I will definitely visit again soon to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"After eating a pretty damned good Indian meal at Marigold Maison over in Paradise Valley a few months ago, I guess I just assumed that all Indian food would be as good as theirs. Although after eating here, my girlfriend and I quickly learned that's definitely not the case.

It's not necessarily that Saffron is bad. I mean, there was nothing blatantly wrong with the food. The server was polite and the place was clean. It's simply that the food just wasn't very good.

We both ordered some lemonade with ginger, which was absolutely nothing like what we've had before. The lemonade was extremely concentrated to the point where it was so potent that if there was, in fact, any ginger in the drink, it could not be detected.  

For starters, we ordered a samosa and paneer pakora. Someone on Yelp lists this as goat cheese, but I'm pretty sure they were misinformed. Both were just kind of bland and not quite as tasteful as we had hoped.

For entrees, we had the chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken. My girlfriend thought something was off with the chicken. It didn't taste grilled, it tasted more like it was boiled - making it much softer than it should be. We also ordered some garlic naan and rice, which again, just didn't really seem to impress in comparison to what we've had during prior experiences.

For dessert, we ordered the gulab jamun, which I'm pretty sure no one ever orders, as the server didn't seem to have any idea what we were asking for. Thankfully, it was the one thing that we both enjoyed.

Overall, service was insanely slow for a place that was practically empty. I'd love to give a higher rating to a little local business like this, but when there are much better options available, I don't see the need to ever really return."}
{"text":"My first experience with indian food.  My boss took me for lunch.  The waitress made suggestions and I followed them.  It was excellent.  The food was outstanding and the service great.  I will be dining here again soon"}
{"text":"Delicious! Another hidden treasure in Glendale. Definitely will come back more than once! I took one star because service was a bit slow but It could have been an off day."}
{"text":"They have a buffet at lunch time for those who are eating Indian food for the first time. They have about 6 dishes to try from.

For dinner I had butter chicken and Jafrezi (cheese) and both were a hit.

Will be back"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is stellar.  Otherwise, the food is pricy for a single person who wants to try a few dishes, but perfectly reasonable for a group that wants to share ($8-10 a dish).

Go for the lunch buffet, try a few things, and then come back with a date and order your favorites!  If you like Indian, this is a good place with both meat and veg options.

A great spot in an otherwise awful neighborhood (for food options)-- a must visit if you live near here!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Indian food. I had the buffet so I could try everything. I really liked it all especially the cauliflower. Be sure to ask for their signature dessert drink \"Preeti in Pink\". The atmosphere was casual and very clean. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Limited buffet is over-priced. Only 6 dishes, five dishes with red sauce all looked the same.
Only one vegetable dish. Samosa was potato filled.  There were no free drinks, no desserts, no sauces. The naan bread was just so-so.  Not worth another visit."}
{"text":"Amazing! They allow you to choose you're range of spice and the flavor is as authentic as it gets!! Pomegranate in the chaat is the perfect touch! Owner was extremely sweet and hospitable, would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"3rd time,  never disappointed! !!! Chicken Vindaloo was amazing.  If you haven't gone here yet,  it is a must do in the west valley!"}
{"text":"We just got there 8:00pm walked in and the cashier/host said that it was closed a sign of open was on and people were there I rally don't know why if the close at 9:00pm at leat that what the sign said. We just walked out hope the owner can see these they lost a good customer or would be our first time."}
{"text":"Went back and had masala fries WHAT?  I would eat these until i exploded! But as you can gues from my previous review i am a bit health consious. These amazing fries upped my previous rating one full star, a must try!"}
{"text":"Nice place. people were friendly. If your on a budget this place will do just fine."}
{"text":"I have never tried Indian food before and let me tell you it was AMAZING. We celebrated our 6 year wedding anniversary here and it was so fun. We got to meet the head chef and the desert was amazing as well! I was planning our next dinner here while i was relentlessly trying to finish everything on the table! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"OK, this is my new favorite Indian restaurant.  I'd been once before, a while back, but this time I was blown away.  Not sure if my taste changed or the kitchen changed, but  all three of us that went thought the food was OUTSTANDING.  We had the Papri Chaat as an appetizer.  The waitperson said it was Indian Nachos.  Wonderful!! You want to lick the plate.  For our meal we had the Dal Makhani, the Matter Paneer (which is by far the best I've had since I've been in AZ.  I think the total best is in a hole-in-the-wall in Berkeley CA.  And by the way, we pretty much did lick the bowl. Outstanding sauce.).The Hakka Noodles were a keeper.  I've never had noodles at an Indian restaurant before.  It won't be the last time.  he Garlic Naan was garlicy and hot (temp hot, not spicy hot) and the Roti was so cool and refreshing. The downside?  We over ordered and were on our way to the theatre so we couldn't take the leftovers. Our waitperson was so helpful and  pleasant.  I'm sure she probably wanted to boot us when we got into a hairy discussion re the spicy-ness of the food.  Extra attraction at no extra charge? The BIG Asiana Supermarket next door.  I'm sure I could have spent hours just wandering.  Anyway, if you're an Indian food fan, check out Saffron.  And if you're not, it's a good place to try Indian food for the first time."}
{"text":"Food was authentic. You could tell that the ingredients were fresh and everything was made to order. Prices were reasonable. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Specifically crafted to the level of spicy we requested.   Loved the Chana masala.  However my daughter did not like the orange chicken"}
{"text":"I have been searching for a great Indian food place and alas, I have found it! We started off with two beautiful and delicious appetizers, Papri Chaat and Samosa Chaat. For my entree I had chicken tikka masala along with chili and garlic naan. It was delectable! The decor was super cute and inviting, and the best part was how nice the owners wife was. She has made a new friend in me...can't wait to go back and try something new! Hopefully will go again this weekend."}
{"text":"We have ordered takeout several times over the past 3 years since moving to Phoenix and they never disappoint- so good! Usually stick to our favorites - lamb tiki masala, chicken tiki masala, today butter chicken. Great sauce, Fresh ingredients! VERY good:)"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Recent moved here from the East Coast and found it very hard to find quality Indian food. All of the places with \"good\" reviews did not measure up to the food i was used to-- and I would eat Indian at least once a week. Finally after asking around for a few months, I had a couple different folks tell me about Saffron and figured I couldn't be let down any more than I already was and decided to give it a shot and I am so glad I did! This is the authentic Indian I remember! The masala sauce is perfectly creamy with the right spices, not Tabasco sauce like so many places I've tried around the area. Their rice is not greasy and perfectly aromatic and the naan was fluffy with the right amount of garlic. I can't wait to bring my boyfriend and try all their other dishes! 5 out of 5 from this Indian food lover."}
{"text":"Brought chicken vindaloo and biryani for the first time here. Was a total disappointment ! The vindaloo curry was like tomato puree and sour. The biryani did not really taste like one. This was sprinkled with very salty fried onions  :("}
{"text":"Excellent food. Ordered 3 different dishes. Had Chicken Vindaloo, Saffron Briyani, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Vindaloo was our favorite. I did order the Saffron Briyani hot ( next time I'll order mild ).

Went back again with family. Superb :)

Mango lassi  is excellent drink. Daughter had a coconut drink with rose in it was very unique and refreshing also excellent. 

Coffee was excellent as was the naan bread."}
{"text":"OMG So good!! First time here and we got takeout. We had the Butter Chicken and its amazing! So flavorful and chicken is tender and delicious :) Thank you Saffron for the yummy food!"}
{"text":"Holy crap. Best food I have had in a loooonnng time. I called in an order to go. The woman who answered was incredibly nice and friendly. She told me they have the best Indian food, and I believe it. Ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, Naan, and a Mango Lassi. The mango lassi didnt even last the drive home :s it was in my stomach in a matter of moments. 

The chicken tikka masala was filled to the BRIM! It was delicious. I couldnt finish it, but those left overs will be CHERISHED. The chicken is fire roasted, and the combination of herbs and spices are heavenly. Just a few smells and I was hooked. 

This place is super fast, friendly, and delicious. A must try. And should be added to your list of \"spots\"."}
{"text":"We've all been there.  You read some me great reviews... it's the food you're looking for... you navigate there and it's the little place at the end of a non generic strip mall.  You wonder \"is this gonna be any good?\"  But you're starved so you head in.

That's when the magic began at Saffron!  When we walked in we were greeted like family friends.  The hostess was engaging without being overbearing.  The atmosphere was beautiful, fun, clean and modern.  The appetizers were simply astonishing!  Literally the best Samosas we'd ever had.  Made fresh to order on the spot!  Our entrees we're really unique... in a good way.  Familiar flavors but with more savory spices.  Amazing stuff!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Please read this review. whoa ! there is no option for No STARS. I would have given that to this place. bad bad experience eating there once. We are North-Indians we know our food. The food was soo bland and not very professionally cooked, it was like some aunty trying to cook restaurant food. Very very small portions. 

But here is the best part, when the bill arrived everything was marked at $1 extra $2 extra. I asked the server to please look at this bill everything is marked at a higher price, she came back and said no everything is alright . That is when I explained her everything like she was a Child, \"see the price in the menu now see the price on the bill can you see the difference\", then she took the bill back and reduced some amount and still it was incorrect. All this while the owner lady was watching but decided not to get into it or even come to us to ask what was happening and if she could help us. At this point i was like are you kidding me, opening a restaurant and inflating prices from what you wrote in the menu... I went up to the counter i said, please look at the bill again it is STILL INACCURATE. The owner lady said, \"Relax, please don't stress\". Now I was really calm, i thought \"Why would I be stressed, its your business, and your customer is upset, you are fooling them. You better be stressed\" i was just watching her get really confused and not able to manage anything at all... then she gave me rest of the amount back in loose change. She kept on saying there is something wrong with the package here the software that calculates and generates the bill. 

We had such a bad experience, we will never go back there again and told everyone we know about what happened, everyone who heard the story was furious.
Get your ACT together Ma'am."}
{"text":"I'm a big foodie, and a food snob, having eaten all over the country at some of the most highly rated restaurants.  I have been to Saffron numerous times and each time the food is fresh, and just pops with amazing flavor."}
{"text":"This place is great!  We love going there.  They have great service and great food.  We moved to Phoenix a year ago and have been trying all the Indian restaurants.  This is our favorite so far."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Hands down the best Indian food we've had in Phoenix. Go try it! We tried a variety of appetizers- samosas, paneer pakora, and pani puri- and all were delightful. The main dishes we tried were the  goan fish, coconut curry shrimp, and hakka noodles. Everything was amazing, but we especially loved the fish. Excellent naan too. They were also happy to make things less spicy so that our small kiddos could try everything too. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place - Just pointed on a map & made my night !!! Must try #2 Appetizer & the Black Pepper Shrimp ! My husband had the Coconut Curry Shrimp & loved it !!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out for Chicken Tikka Masala and Mango Lassi. I live about 20 minutes away so I was scared it was going to get cold, but when I got home, it was still very hot! I ate the masala quickly, although for $13 the portion could've been a little bigger. This was my first time trying mango lassi and it was thick and tasted very good. Service was good too. Really yummy, but a little overpriced for the portions."}
{"text":"I just moved into the area and a neighbor highly recommended this place. Had dinner here last night with a friend. We started off with tea, I got the raspberry flavor, it was sweet and delicious. We then ordered the Lamb Vindaloo (medium spicy) and the Butter Chicken, these dishes are a la carte so we had to order a side of rice too. We also got naan for my gluten indulgent friend which he liked. We each tried both dishes and really enjoyed them. 
The manager (owner?) of the place came over to our table not once but twice to chat and she asked how we enjoyed the food. We really like it and there was plenty leftover for my lunch today. The medium spice level of the Vindaloo was just right.
Pricing was reasonable but I will say that the entrees should come with the rice.
My overall experience was really good and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 because it still is not my favorite Indian Restaurant, BUT it is the best in the valley.
It's a modern take on good Indian food. Chicken Masala was fantastic. It was clearly grilled fresh, everything was top notched, you can tell they did not skimp on flavor or the fresh ingredients used to make the masala as other places do. The Butter Chicken was so savory that we can completely see why the UK is in love with this dish. The only thing negative I can think of is that we should have ordered more than 1 serving of rice. But that is something very, very small. We WILL go back again and order different dishes to fully try out everything this place has to offer."}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch today and had an amazing meal. From the appetizers (Samosas and Papri Chaat), to the main course (garlic naan, chicken jalfrezi and chicken tikka masala), not a single bite was taken without a yummy noise attached to it. That speaks for itself!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. I had the chicken vindaloo. It had the perfect blend of flavor and the right level of spiciness. The naan was delicious. I tried a bit of my friend's haaka noodles which were very good as well. 

The service was friendly and attentive.  It's a small restaurant with a clean and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Today I had my first experience eating Indian food and I can definitely say that it will not be my last! I can also say that I will make sure to come back to Saffron next time I need my fix...it was absolutely fantastic!! We ordered the lamb tikka masala (medium hot), chicken tikka masala (medium hot), (2) garlic naan, (1) rice, and (2) mango lassi. The sauce was phenomenal, meat was tender and savory, naan was soft but crisp in all the right places, and bursting with garlicky goodness. The sweet creamy lassi's were a perfect compliment to the heat.
The staff was very pleasant, knowledgeable and welcoming. Portions were great for the price ($35 total). We've even got leftovers for later!
Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Everything we try here is good. The naan is so fresh and tasty! We had the Veg Thali for weekday lunch and it was very good. It was a lot of food for one person and bigger than other Thali plates we have had at other places. We tried the mango and yogurt drink, which was also good. Nice atmosphere and always very good service. Definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"So glad we stumbled upon Saffron Indian Bistro. Although the ambiance is pretty plain the score with prompt and friendly service, and the food, wow. We ordered the samosas, firecracker chicken, garlic Naan, the price is in-line with the quality and quantity. We'll definitely return. This place could benefit with highlighting their outside patio. Either enclose the patio so alcohol could be served outside, or at least, put bright color umbrellas over tables to draw more attention"}
{"text":"I love all food but my absolute favorite cuisine is Indian. Saffron Indian Bistro is HANDS DOWN THE BEST Indian restaurant I have been to in the Valley, an excellent choice for both meat eaters and vegetarians. 

Their dishes pack more flavor than your tongue will know what to do with (you'll manage) and enough heat for your digestive tract to thank you later. The Chinese-Indian fusion dishes are worth trying as well; something for every one. 

Pros: 
Fresh, real food
Abundance of amazing favors w/ choice of heat
Choices - numerous appetizers & entrees 
VERY clean - not even dirty silverware!
Friendly, helpful owner & staff
Next to an amazing grocery store where you can buy the ingredients to make you own Indian cuisine, but why would you?
Takeout if you don't have time to dine in

Cons:
Only one location
If this is your first taste of Indian, Saffron may ruin it for all other Indian restaurants hereafter 

Wherever you are coming from, this place is WELL worth the drive. I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed. Enjoy!

P.S. I have been to the place others who left less than 5 stars have mentioned located in PV and the only thing I can think of is that there may have been too much flavor at Saffron for their taste. I cannot even compare the two, let alone recommend another Indian restaurant in good conscience."}
{"text":"Finally!!  We are wintering 'Snow Birds' coming from WA State and have sorely missed good Indian food in our West Valley location. We had Chicken Tikka Masala; Channa Masala; Lamb Chops; Saffron Briyani and Garlic Naan. Oh yum---every dish perfect--we ordered a lot to try and took much home to enjoy later. I am now totally satisfied with our restaurant selections nearby."}
{"text":"I arrived late and they were very gracious.  The food was fabulous. The butter chicken was melt in my mouth and the sauce had just the right amount of heat. The naan bread was nice and crispy. I wanted to keep eating long after I was full. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The buffet was a little small, but what they lacked in quantity, they made up for in quality - delicious! Plus they deliver, perfect for a student."}
{"text":"So pissed off I ordered  30. In food and the meal don't come with rice it's alacart  and they don't tell you this when you order for pick up .... so now all my food will be cold before  I get the rice. Not to mention you don't get much food for the price. Never again will I buy from this place."}
{"text":"Haven't had Indian food this good since Australia! So so so good! The butter chicken and naan is exceptional! I give this place 10 stars! New fav!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty amazing and has to be the best Indian food in town.  I've been twice in the past week and have found the food to be fresh and extremely tasty!  The saag paneer may be the best I've ever had and the naan was super as well.  

The restaurant is spotlessly clean and the staff are also great - very personable.  The owner/manager even asked what could be done to make our experience even better.  I will be eating here regularly and I encourage you to give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is a small hole in the wall Indian restaurant with phenomenal food.  I now have no intention of going anywhere else for a delightful Indian meal.  I was there for their lunch buffet but see them as a great place for take out and a superb evening meal.  I am not Indian but have many of relatives who are.  When they come to town, this is where I'll take them."}
{"text":"Worst food I ever had in phoenix.
Very old chicken .batteer for naan is old I could sense that.tandoori times is far better than this restaurant"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The medium hot is the perfect spice. The garlic nan is to die for. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"i generally don't write yelp reviews but this will be my first. i have been to this restaurant several times when I was a student at Midwestern University. I had a shady experience here and really didn't want to write about it at the time due to not wanting to speak ill of the restaurant, but in the end, I feel it's the right thing to do as it would be wrong of me to let this incident go by unnoticed and without any consequence. I also feel an obligation to let other yelp users know what's up so they can be careful when ordering here.

Basically, it's a simple story. I ordered two meet entrees and two rice orders to go (close to $30 worth if I remember correctly). I opened up the two rice containers when I went home and immediately knew something was off. Each container had a shockingly small amount of rice in it to the point that anyone looking into the box could tell this was not the normal amount. I strongly suspected they had ripped me off and basically only cooked one order of rice, split the amount into two containers, and charged me for both orders of rice just to save that additional portion for themselves. 

This suspicion was confirmed true when I re-ordered at another date, but this time only buying one order of rice. Sure enough, when I opened the box, there was double the rice than what I had been given the previous time when I bought two orders. This time it actually looked normal when I peeked into the container.

You would think that when ordering $30 worth of food from this restaurant, they would not be so cheap as to skimp me out of $1.50 of rice. If they only wanted to cook up one order, then they should have just charged me the $1.50. Instead they charged me the full $3 and then split up one order of rice into two containers. I was shocked they would try to pull of something so shady, so blatantly.

Anyway it's taken me this long to write this review because I was very uneasy with the ideal of putting a negative review online for everyone to read. But in the end the incident has stuck with me, and I feel like it's my obligation to document what happened so others can be careful when ordering here. The food was very tasty to be sure, but the owner did not have any integrity in her business methods"}
{"text":"So this was my first time and it was amazing!!! Service with a smile. Clean. Food was fresh very well seasoned not overdone. The naan is the best I have ever had!!! Will certainly be back!!!! Great job!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. The paneer wrap is amazing and comes with masala fries....both taste awesome!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is an attempt at marrying Indian and Chinese. I found the curry and the Eggplant dishes to be ill prepared. They used the same sauce and tasted the same. The coconut curry did not have any coconut in it. The cook seems to believe that mediocrity is a good. 

I would waste my time coming from Surprise to this restaurant when other fine Indian restaurants are available."}
{"text":"A friend and I just happen to be referred to this undiscovered gem in North Phoenix.  I will have to say pleasantly surprised at how flavorful and spicy the food was.  Was expecting the normal when it comes to Indian food for Phoenix.  I will say, this has to be by far the best Indian food I have eaten in all of the Phoenix metro area."}
{"text":"We were a party of four.  Everyone liked what they ordered which was a variety. My wife had the firecracker chicken which she liked.  One thing about that dish is that the chicken was breaded and fried before going into the dish. That surprised me and I would not like that aspect of it.  However, everything else was predictable and well done.  So, I would definitely recommend Saffon,"}
{"text":"I thought the food was really good. We both really enjoyed the butter chicken and tikka masala, as well as the mango lassi and both garlic and plain naan.  I wasn't in love with their samosa, a bit bland, but not bad and I found the mint chutney a bit odd (not my favorite mint chutney ever). The mango and tamarind chutney were both quite good.  I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"The food was incredible! The decor was simple and at first glance nothing super fancy or uppity but just right for me.  The food was INCREDIBLE!  That garlic.cheese Naan was wonderful.  Both of our dishes were super good.  We had Butter Chicken and Chicken Vindaloo.  The first we had mild and was very good and didn't have any spice at all (they ask you how much you want, I'm a weenie).  The Vindaloo we got a little spicier and it was also amazing.  The rice was perfect and soaked up the sauce and filled out the dish.  For sure a hidden gem that we will visit again and again."}
{"text":"Just another Indian restaurant nothing special about this place. Over priced with small portions. Service is great otherwise not worth the second visit. They have the worst absolutely the worst chai ever, it tasted like they have been using same tea leaves for past two months."}
{"text":"I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala from here for takeout last night and it was among the best I've ever had! I ordered the hottest spice option and wasn't disappointed--enough burn to make it exciting without overwhelming the awesome creamy tomato goodness! I can also attest the samosa and garlic naan were excellent! The latter was generously covered in garlic and appeared to have been baked in a brick oven.  It paired perfectly with my entrée. The restaurant itself looked like a cool place to eat. It had a kind of hip urban vibe to it--glazed concrete floors with cool Indian characters (Hindi?) on the walls and the super friendly staff were in the process of decorating for Diwali.  I'm definitely coming back and going to try to get my friends to join me sometime.

Quick update: I'd originally given this place 4 stars. I just finished last night's leftovers and now feel the full five is fully justified!"}
{"text":"The Staff is very friendly. Great Food! All the Food is awesome, But I Really Love The Butter Chicken & Naan!!!"}
{"text":"I've actually never been inside Saffron, but since my sister-in-law is seriously addicted to their food, I've had take-out from Saffron about 10 times. If anyone has the number for an Indian food addiction hotline, please fwd it my way - I'm kinda worried about her...

Shout out to the samosas, the naan, the chicken tikka masala, and the saag with paneer cheese - those 4 things frequently put me in a food coma after church on Sunday. For an extra punch, order the entrees spicy for a quick sweat before your nap!"}
{"text":"My mom visited from Flagstaff and wanted to eat Indian food before shopping at the Asian market. So we thought we would check this place out. First let talk about ambiance. Nothing fancy, extremely clean, loved the Indian Alphabet painted on the wall. Now I will disclose my moms from Pakistan, she cooks that type of food from scratch and has very high standards, with that said this place is a diamond in the rough. In a strip mall so you could never imagine such fresh excellent food being served there. Serve outstanding. Out of curiosity I asked to meet the chef. When he came to say hello I was stunned to know he is a self taught chef, this family totally dedicates their lively hood to the success of this restaurant.  I really wish them the best because the food is out of this world."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food. They didn't have Indian beers which was a disappointment. Service was great, music enjoyable. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Always fresh and delicious. An amassing flavor. Our family favorite Indian restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not the best Indian food that I have had but pretty good for Arizona!! I would recommend the dish with black pepper and shrimp (don't remember the exact name)."}
{"text":"Showed up a little hesitant because the menu features traditional Indian food as week as some Chinese and Chinese-Indian fusion. Another warning sign for me was the decor was kind of trendy and modern which usually means the owner is trying to cover up crappy food with a nice dining room. However I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. I had the garlic naan, Murgh Aloo and Lamb Vindaloo. All excellent and well flavored."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times now, and this restaurant has definitely now become my go-to for Indian food. The food is great and the portions are very generous! The staff is friendly and welcoming. I am vegan and the staff has always been extremely helpful and insightful with suggestions for me."}
{"text":"Possibly the best Chicken Tikka Masala I've ever had! I've tried so many here throughout the state and this without a doubt is the winner! So yummy! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre. Chai is really plain - not worth the money. The dishes are $12 and up, and rice and naan are extra. We ordered Saag Paneer (usually my favorite) and Chicken Tikki Masala, and didn't even finish them. The garlic naan was decent. Service was pretty good, but atmosphere was lacking. I will not return."}
