{"text":"Tasty grilled cheese sandwiches in a friendly neighbourhood setting.  My favourites are the Rise & Shine (bacon, scrambled egg, tomato, cheese) and Green Machine (avocado, arugula, pesto, cheese).  If you have room for a little indulgence, also try the grilled banana & nutella sandwich (yum!).    The owners are very friendly and accommodating.  The establishment is also very kid-friendly.  Board games are available, and the owners even put on a movie for my nieces as a pleasant distraction as we waited for our orders.  Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood spot, simple menu, delicious food, perfect for a quick lunch. The owner takes pride being part of the community for generations, which make it so uniquely great."}
{"text":"Warm, filling, healthy, delicious...and friendly service to boot. We moved into Leaside a few weeks ago and have popped into this gem twice already. Tried both the Green Machine and the Hamelot and loved them both equally. So much better than the grilled cheddar (with obligatory tomato soup) that I had as a child!"}
{"text":"Great little place on Millwood Rd off Bayview south of Eglinton  Cosy, inviting and very friendly service The green machine was delicious and something that caught my eye was the personalized message on the take away packaging :) sweet  Next time will try the desert :)"}
{"text":"I've tried three times since it opened 3 weeks ago - their sandwiches are amazing!  The owners are a really cool couple (and a brother?). After a short conversation I learned that they took over the spot from the dad. There's actually a really nice, personal vibe about the place, and the owners are really down to earth and friendly..  I also discovered that this is a small start up and they are learning as they go with respect to a lot of things, but they seem quite keen on establishing a 'community' relationship and dialogue.  They make a mean GC. The prices are pretty reasonable - I mean, $2 for a large, organic coffee? No way any place nearby can beat that!   I'm also hooked, will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I work and live nearby and decided to try it today. I loved the sandwich and the soup was really good.  Great customer service, and I loved the community feeling that it has. The community bulletins and the Free Little Library are very Leaside.   I am going to take others here.  Unfortunately no fries as I think it might be a building issue.   The quality is great and  the dining area is very cute!"}
{"text":"Very cozy and inviting environment. The owners are very nice and every single bite of my Hamelot was heavenly good! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of my local favourites.  I always have the Green Machine and Tomato Soup. The cappuccino is one of the best.    Super cozy local restaurant and the couple that runs it is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Great little place. Gotta try the \"Green Machine\" grilled cheese!!  Has about ten seats and can be busy. They have a couple of \"house special\" grilled cheese, and you can build your own. No fries (building code issue?), but they have vegetable chips.  Very friendly staff. Also have espresso machine, good coffee."}
{"text":"I work nearby and I've been coming here almost every week since March. If you're looking for a proper grilled cheese and great customer service, you better come here!  My favourite grilled cheese is the Green Machine - avocado, arugula, fresh basil pesto, monterey jack. You get consistent quality every single time. If you like pickles, they come with it for free! It really balances out the flavour of the grilled cheese."}
{"text":"All round relaxing and pleasant experience! The sandwiches are classic comfort food and the staff/owners are kind and conscientious."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!! Try the vegetarian option but add bacon.  The tomato soup is out of this world and the jalapeno ketchup is a nice touch."}
{"text":"My favourites are the tuna kahuna and the green machine. Delish! 5 stars."}
{"text":"Incredible! Had the green machine and Hamelot, taste sensations! Friendly staff and cozy environment, will deffinitly be going back!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of meeting the owners and trying their super indulging and tasty ham n cheese grilled toast. Service, customer interaction and friendliness of these lovely people are secund to none! This instantly made this place one of my favourite spots to return to.  Next time we'll try to eat-in rather than getting a take out. Can't wait to try everything they have on their menu. This is a small restaurant, serving a small but tasty menu, with limited seats and limited hours... But they all come with endless charm!!! 100% recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Nice family owned spot, everything is made to order and they use high quality ingredients. You can also order ahead of time, which if you're on lunch I would suggest. It does get busy. But the husband and wife who own it are very nice and they seem to have a lot of regulars. Inside is on the smaller side, there are enough seats for about 9-10 people but if the weather outside is nice out can hang out at the picnic table.  They have a little free library inside for you to chill out and read books, and a little info on the building and family history. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"If you're going to specialize in one thing, you better be able to do that one thing really well. And man, is the Millwood Melt good at making grilled cheese! I ordered the Green Machine sandwich and it was so creamy and delicious without being too greasy and heavy like most grilled cheeses are. The owners were very friendly and made their small location feel homey and welcoming. It's an adorable spot and I love the history behind the building."}
{"text":"Comfort food at its best! I had the green machine - it was so fresh tasting, really delicious. Love the laid-back and welcoming vibe.   Great gem in Leaside!"}
{"text":"Down-home goodness at this neighbourhood favourite.  From the quality ingredients to the friendliness of the service, Millwood Melt keeps us coming back a few times a month.  Grilled cheese sandwiches are a simple food-- easy to take for granted until you've had the ones here."}
{"text":"I should also mention, after going back the next day for another sandwich,  that the quality is really good here.  All their ingredients are good quality and you can taste it."}
{"text":"Say: \"cheese\"! Now say: \"best grilled cheese\"!! It really is the best I've had. Everything is simple but done well. The way it should be. I ordered the Green Machine. Right amount of butter, crispness, and cheese. The other ingredients as well as the bread were in complete harmony. Good service, cozy, friendly environment. Not a lot of indoor seating, but you can also sit outside. A must try!"}
{"text":"Friendly couple.  The grilled cheese sandwiches are all very good especially the Green Machine.  Hidden gem."}
{"text":"This was a damn good grilled cheese, and a new jem of Leaside. Wish I still had hockey at the arena nearby! We went in to pick up just before they close (4pm on a sunday) and it was a full house, all 8-10 seats were filled. Good job guys!  Ordered the Hamelot & the Rise and Shine. Bread is perfect, cheese is good, toppings a bit sparse. The Hamelot had 1 thin piece of ham, their photos show more. However the boyfriend loved it, and I preferred the rise and shine (with its thinly cooked, nicely seasoned egg).   Both orders came with a bag of sunchips, woop! Wish I knew about the free pickle before it was too late.. I wonder if they're homemade. Will be back to try other sandwiches/dessert/soup."}
{"text":"An amazing tiny shop. My friends and I came after a hike. The hospitality was great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"For National Grilled Cheese Day, I celebrated with the Green Machine ($8) at Millwood Melt. A tiny shop tucked away in Leaside grills up the most perfect cheese sandwiches. To start off, the bread is grilled to a beautiful golden brown and is wonderfully buttery (but not so much so that it ends up all over my hands when I pick it up). I can see the melted cheese slowly oozing from the edge of the sandwich which is a beautiful sight. There's a light crunch as I bite into the crust and yet the sandwich itself is still moist, light and airy. The inside is an ooey gooey mash of avocado, arugula, pesto and Monterey Jack. I liked this lighter herbier blend of flavours to the traditional cheddar cheese and it seemed less overwhelming and healthier. And when paired with the warm, tangy sweet tomato soup ($5), it was the perfect meal to commemorate this holiday."}
