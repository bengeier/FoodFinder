{"text":"Was it just me and the particular day that I went to Ox & Angela?  Almost everything I ordered was beyond salty and we couldn't finish any of the dishes because of it.  Great service though.  And the churros. they are to die for."}
{"text":"It's rare that I would give 5 stars but I LOVE this restaurant. The food is unique and delicious and always consistent. The service is also spot on. It's considered a tapa bar so it's great to go with large groups and order a bunch of plates to share. Ive gone with large groups a few times and always received great service. They train they're staff incredibly well, very knowledgable and helpful. The ambiance is romantic yet relaxed. It's my new go-to whenever I have company from out of town.  Everything on their menu is delicious. The mushrooms are my favorite, perfectly spiced with an egg cracked on top. Who new mushrooms could be so delicious?"}
{"text":"Extremely expensive and overrated for what it is. The dishes are pricey for a very small amount of food which leaves you feeling like you have't eaten anything. Our server was horrible (Letittia). Maybe the service was bad because we had 6 people so she was guaranteed 18% gratuity according to the restaurant's fineprint on the bottom of the menu. We eat out in Calgary a alot and are used to the prices of high end restaurants but even still, this is a ripoff.  Definitely better places in the city for tapas with better food and better prices."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was amazing! The food was delicious, our awesome waitress recommended a fabulous wine, in a really lovely setting. We started off with whiskey sours at the bar, then enjoyed some tapas and great conversation. The staff are all really friendly. I loved it!"}
{"text":"It pains me to not give this restaurant 5 stars because the meal was one of the best I've ever eaten! My husband and I had The Spanish Table which is a series of courses of spectacular food. Our wait staff was very knowledgeable. One star is lost because for setting. It may be authentic, but we were uncomfortably warm, inches from our neighbours, and the seats were uncomfortable. If you can look past that, it is worth a visit... Oh, and best espresso I've ever had as well."}
{"text":"O&A is A-OK - The former Bungalow location's exterior belies what's going on within its confines. With the exception of the aforementioned white washed facade, the place has a nice mood & vibe to it. A group of us dropped in for post din libations. It was busy and had the accompanying energy of a buzzing locale. We were sat on the lounge side, so can't attest to the dining room experience or its food. The service, though, was attentive and efficient and the drink array was diverse. Will certainly return."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here to celebrate the successful completion of a business venture together. Not only did we have the most delicious meal here but our server, Barbara, was outstanding!   We started off with the Patatas Bravas - which are HEAVENLY!  Then, shared the baby lettuce salad, chicken & pork meatballs, and the roasted heirloom carrots. It was plenty of food for us both. And while everything tasted delicious, the carrots were a little undercooked for my taste, but my friend loved them. They are the only thing that I wouldn't absolutely want to order again.   We finished by sharing 1/2 a slice of the chocolate almond tart, which was to die for! We asked for just half a slice, and told our server that she could have the other half to share with her colleagues. It was still the size of 'normal' slice, and more than plenty, so rich that just a bite or two each would have been enough, but of course we devoured the whole thing.   This is definitely a place I will return to when I'm back in Calgary."}
{"text":"My experience started with a bang. I was promptly seated on the patio and got my cocktail quickly. My waitress was pleasant and informed me that one of the dishes I ordered was her fave on the menu.  I had the dates and the butter lettuce salad. Got my items quickly and they were presented beautifully. The dates were amazing but the butter lettuce salad was a bit bland and vinegary. Needs to be balanced out with something.  My waitress checked on me after my first few bites, but after that it went downhill. I finished my meal and waited about ten minutes for someone to clear the plates off my table and ask if I wanted anything else. When I said I was ready for the bill she took my plates and I'm still waiting for her to return. I've since logged into yelp and I'm still waiting for my bill. It's been 20 minutes...."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for drinks and some lie food. The only reason I didn't give five stars is due to the fact that I feel the stuffed dates were very overpriced. I had the dates, and also ordered the deep fried goat cheese which was probably one of the best tasting foods I've ever had, very rich and flavorful. The drink selection is also one of the best I have seen. The atmosphere is very warm and happening. This is a great place for a date night or just a night out with some friends. I will definitely be a regular customer."}
{"text":"I had wanted to go there for a long time. What a disappointment. The tapas we selected: the stuffed dates and the manchego cheese with honey were ok, nothing to be excited about, and so very small. I get the whole tapas thing but still it was very small for the price. The paella was the most disappointing: the rice had stuck to the pan and was overcooked/burnt, only three prawns, a few slices of chorizo sausage that were burnt and one chicken leg that was bland. I have had paella with shrimps, mussels, scallops, saffran and wine, etc... This paella tasted like Rice-a-Roni and chicken. Throwing a handful of pea shoots on top does not make up for bad execution. Honestly, it felt like maybe the chef did not show up and the bus boy had to cook.  I must say we had a nice waiter and we did not mention that we were not pleased. Perhaps they could have done something about the paella... I cannot tell you about desserts....We just wanted out. The two stars were earned by the nice vermouth and the good glass of wine. Total price $108, plus 15% tip as I never take it out on the waiter. Totally overpriced for mostly Rice-a-Roni. Needless to say, we will not go back."}
{"text":"I am a fan! Terrific tapas menu. First thing to order is the stuffed dates! Ham trio excellent follow up .  Now, the atmosphere and service was outstanding.  Thank Kate and Mya for a memorable evening.  This is a place I would suggest for family and friends in Calgary."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for drinks before but finally went for dinner with a group of 4 just a week before Christmas. Although it was busy, we got seated at a delightfully spacious table and promptly received a plate of free olives to snack on. We ordered the paella to share, and then other tapas- seared scallops, pan con tomate, asparagus, and roasted carrots.   The cumin roasted carrots were amazing, they had just enough crunch and caramelization. Seared scallops usually comes on plate of 3, our server asked us immediately if we wanted to change the size to 4, so there would be no need for awkward sharing. The paella was quite large and very satisfying for 4 people, but perhaps felt a little short on the seafood.   We wandered all over the winter cocktails menu, which I found much better than the summer cocktails that I was familiar with. They tended towards rich and spicy taste profiles, with many of them featuring wintry and warm spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg. The Catalan holiday, with sherry and cava was smooth and delightful, the El Marinero with spiced rum, coconut milk, and nutmeg was an nice play on classic eggnog.   Service was probably the best part of the meal- probably one of the best I've received in the city. It was fast and attentive, and our server was impressively professional. We even noted a few times that he would stand aside and wait for our conversation to die down before approaching the table so that we would not be interrupted.   I went in with expectations of a decent casual meal and left surprised by our exceptionally experience."}
{"text":"First off I would like to note that before the renovation, Ox and Angela was my favourite restaurant in Calgary because of their expertly crafted flavours and attention to detail in everything they served.  I came here to try the \"new\" restaurant aka renovation and left utterly disappointed and heartbroken that the restaurant I loved is a mere shadow of its former glory.  I came here for the happy hour and tried about 8 things on the menu plus 2 drinks. I politely asked the bartender if they still have the delicious Ox cocktail but he shortly said \"that's never coming back\" so I ordered another instead. I was  shocked to see that the pork belly was gone, fried artichoke hearts with Harissa gone, and other delightful items had been nixed. The Persian dates, normally delightful, were over-saturated in overly acidic sauce which burned my tongue and overpowered the entire date....it tasted awful. The steak, always the best thing, was served to me dried out on top of a tasty green sauce but again, the cut of meat was junk and the recipe was changed for the worse. The octopus was served whole and fried, usually my favourite item, but frying it just destroys the delicate flavour! I did notice that much more care and attention to detail was given to people ordering after the happy hour ended, aka better cuts of beef, so beware that half price is no deal at all because you get half the quality (in my experience and observation).  Unfortunately, although the new ambiance is cool, it caters much more to young people looking to drink at a bar instead of dining and having a nice meal. As a result, I have the impression that following other restaurants in Calgary (like Parc Brasserie), this place has dumbed down the flavours in the menu for the average Calgarian. Let's be honest, young people in Calgary demand good deals in lieu of exquisite food, and unfortunately Ox Bar caters to that market now."}
{"text":"Ox & Angela amazes me.  The food is outstanding (bacon wrapped dates, yum!), the cocktails are inventive and top shelf and the server was friendly and professional.  The type of server who encouraged our adventurous spirit.  We had just come back from a trip to San Francisco, and Ox & Angela was at least on par with some of the great foodie experiences we had there!"}
{"text":"We were given a nice table for two. It was a beautiful reservation and we were greeted immediately and the staff was openly friendly. The restaurant is small and cozy. The ambience is fantastic and is a great place for small groups of 4 to 6. We enjoyed a lovely Spanish Red wine and the Spanish Table for dinner. A fantastic ensemble of different Tapas that can be enjoyed by everyone. My favourites were the stuffed dates, tuna, roasted vegetables and croquettes. The potatoes and hangar steak were perfectly prepared also. Based on the price of dinner and a few glasses of wine, this is a special occasion restaurant. But I would recommend it to anything that enjoys Tapas."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here has been delicious. Ask for recommendations from the server if you're intimidated by the menu."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday night with my girlfriend to try some authentic Spanish Tapas for dinner and was not let down. All items were delicious and quite different from what I'm used to - which is what I was hoping. We had the goat cheese, chorizo, scallops, asparagus, tomato bread, jamon, fritters and they were all excellent. Portions were just about right, 2-3 items per person will get you a full meal for the most part. We ended the meal with some churros with chocolate dip and it was perfect. Great dinner and definitely recommended."}
{"text":"My first time at Ox and Angela was fantastic!!!! We were a large group in on a Saturday night, and usually service can be slow and waiters/waitresses can dread the experience of big tables ( i know I did back in my days) In our case, our server was top notch, answered all of our questions about the menu and gave us recommendations, as well as taking the time to chat casually, despite the busy pace in the restaurant. The drinks menu is ginornous, but I finally decided to start with a Gorilla Bourbon Cocktail = Bourbon, Chambord,raspberries and cranberry juice.  It was strong, colourful,  and not overly sweet. They use the best and freshest ingredients, so none of that gross OceanSpray sweetened water disguised as \"cranberry\" juice in this drink.  For eats, we went with the cod fritters, the potatos bravas and the tomato on sourdough with white anchovies on top. As espected the food was superb too. Not to much salt (which I found they use very liberally in Spain) and just the right size bites for our slightly peckish appetite. There are some bigger plates available, as well as a set menue for larger groups.  I cannot wait to go back and try the paella and more of their smaller dishes. Great spot for a date, or that in between lunch and dinner time when you've done some shopping with a friend. THe location O&A currently occupies has been reincarnated numerous times, but I think this time they have what it takes to be one of Calgary's permanent fixtures."}
{"text":"My bf and I are foodies and tried this place just for a drink and ordered this shrimp on the menu. It was absolutely great not over cooked or under cooked. The manager even gave us their complimentary item to try. That was a bit salty for my taste cause I don't like salt or sugar unless it is natural. Overall it was excellent and we would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My hubby picked this place for date night.  I had not heard of them yet and was not that crazy about going....the name kinda threw me.  I could not imagine the type of food that could be served there.    The food was really good.  I had the duck and my husband had the pork shanks, which was the special of the day.  We started with some empanadas.   All was very good.  We would definitely return."}
{"text":"Amazing place. The husband and I had the Spanish Table. Awesome food and great service. Will for sure go there again."}
{"text":"nice enough room and had good service at the bar. nicely presented food was edible, even good if the price were lower, but overpricing made me drop my rating a star. predominant flavor was salt- i thought flavors would be a little more dynamic and interesting. typical overhyped calgary restaurant. good for date night i guess, not for foodies."}
{"text":"Man, this place WAS amazing. WAS. It had beautiful decor and spectacular food. They did a renovation though and completely ruined the look and feel of the place. It's no longer cosy and intimate but instead looks like an upscale cafeteria with uncomfortable chairs. Super disappointing this place was in my top 5 favorite places before.  Edit: bumping it up one star because the food was still really good. (Though they lost some of their really good dishes as well.) Super uncomfortable chairs though, I'm so sad about this place."}
{"text":"Back again!  Had the olive chicken main plate for lunch, on the recommendation of the waiter.  Normally I wouldn't order chicken, but previous experience here has shown that they pack a lot of flavour into simple dishes.  Ordered tortilla and scallions with romesco sauce as sides. This meal lived up to those expectations.  Based on consistency of execution, I'm upping my rating from 4 to 5 stars.   Tip: be sure to order some bread to mop up all the delicious sauce if you get the chicken, or just to enjoy the locally-pressed Turkish olive oil and gray salt it comes with."}
{"text":"My wife and I went in for our anniversary dinner after seeing some great reviews -- we were not disappointed.  Being fans of Spanish food we were looking forward to some tapas - standouts were the pintxos of the day (which were tuna based, with perfect cooking on the tuna) and the asparagus. We shared a paella and were very pleased overall. Having sparkling water on tap for free is a great addition and I wish other restaurants would do this.  Price is on the high side but nothing out of the ordinary for a nice place in Calgary.  Highly recommended.  However, if you are looking for a quiet place, this isn't it. Being on 17th ave means there is quite a lot of street noise and the rooms themselves are pitched pretty high. No blaring music, but lots of people close together in their two rooms all communicating (happily) at once"}
{"text":"It's another Saturday night in Calgary and it's time to go into the city to enjoy a colourful drink at a colourful place and hopefully engage in colourful communicado. Perhaps it was just timing or perhaps this Yelper whom is a child of a lesser God had divine intervention when we found parking right outside the Ox and Angela on a busy 17th Avenue. This seemed according to divinity to be as good as any place to drink into the night.   The hostess who was a beautiful mystery sat myself and a friend of mine at the corner of the bar which is exactly where I like to drink from.  Amongst the plethora of liquor on the bar there is a statue of what seems to be the Virgin Marry or it could possibly be Saint Angela Merici, I didn't engage in a conversation to find out, but it's nice knowing that us fellow drinkers are being blessed or at least watched over.   The Tender of the Bar was quite busy making a variety of complex cocktails for other patrons. The manager came up to me and my buddy and gave us a large glass bottle of water and asked us what our drink of choice would be for the night. I ordered an Old Fashioned and my friend ordered a Mojito. The Tender of the Bar went to work on creating our drinks and it was watching an Artist.   First, the Old Fashioned. This is my drink of choice at most bars and almost every bar makes it differently and the demand is high for this beverage since Don Draper has made it quite fashionable. The Ox and Angela used Bourbon and not rye, which is something I like. Used a a drop or two of Soda Water, I prefer just a few tear drops of regular water however, it was quite minimal. The sugar cube with bitters poured on it was muddled perfectly and all made in a classic short glass garnished with a small slice of orange peel with plentiful ice. I would rank it in the top three Old Fashioned in the city (stay tuned in the future for number's 1 & 2).   The Mojito was also made with a desirable amount of affection. She used good amounts of shrapnel and ice for the drink. What makes a great Mojito is when the mint leaves are adrift between the packed ice in the middle of the glass. Most Mojito's I drink always have the mint leaves found lounging in a pile at the bottom of the glass or some are found floating lazily at the top of the glass. For appearance sake, you can't beat the middle. The taste as any advertiser would probably promote it, \"Refreshing!\". I would rank it the best Mojito to date that I've drank in the city.   For the great drinks I am beholden to you, Tender of the Bar.  When I asked my friend what he thought of the Ox and Angela, he responded, \"Put it on the list\". As in put it on the list of places we will frequent in the city.   best     ac"}
{"text":"Another pretentious restaurant, overpriced and so so food. Tapas are supposed to be casual, it's an equivalent of pub food in Spain. and of course, everything in Calgary has to be fine dining so they can gouge people as much as they want.  We ordered kale, pork belly, scallops, potato dish and olives and some bread. Nothing really stands out to be great, the only thing that stands out is the price of the dish. If you like to pay $21 for three pieces of scallops, welcome to ox and Angela.  And btw, tapas should serve draft beer and they only have bottle beers. Have you ever go to irish pub with bottle beers?!!! It pisses me off!"}
{"text":"The ingredients tasted fresh, but the food was nothing special. Scallops were overcooked. The seared tuna had bones in it and was served on a bed of undercooked scallions. The only part of the meal that we really loved was the salsa Romesco, although it was that was served on top of a heaping pile of undercooked spring onions.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong dishes, but why have wrong dishes on the menu?  The number of tables and loudness of the music were too high for such a small space.  I can appreciate what they're trying to do with this place, but it's not quite there. A mediocre experience overall. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. We'll probably go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"I use to frequent Ox and Angela quite a bit- to the point where I started to have a regular server ha ha. Food is good, consistent in quality and the drinks are good as well. With that being said, I must say the number one reason I keep coming back is because of the service. I'm not implying that all servers are alike and being in the industry myself, I understand that some nights are better than others but I appreciate the breadth of knowledge our server had not only on dishes but on the wines and his genuine approach to making sure we enjoyed ourselves.   Unfortunately, I've been too busy as of late to come back but when I find myself craving a glass of grenache my mind goes back to Ox and Angela and all the good times that I had there.   So thanks Dale for everything and hopefully I will see you soon!"}
{"text":"I've always liked O&A so wanted to try the new updated restaurant. It has a nice clean new look but it's extremely loud - I had to yell to speak with my friend- I couldn't hear the waitress, nor could she hear me during a few instances.  We had the asparagus, which is good- but when you get only 3 scrawny spears and pay $9ish - it seems a little steep. My friend has the strip-loin earlier in the week so we tried it again, the taste was a little off and it was quite tough.  I did enjoy the leeks.  All the portions are so small that it's not really for sharing and you would need a lot of plates to fill yourselves if this was actually your dinner.  We are happy to pay the prices but please Ox make us feel like we got something out of it."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a little loud but the food is fantastic so that more than makes up for it.  The restaurant has a wide selection to choose from.  The meat dishes are not that good and somewhat overpriced.  I'd say their specialties are the vegetarian dishes.  It's some of the best food I've ever had.    Some of the waitresses at this restaurant are fantastic and go out of their way to be friendly and informative but unfortunately there are one or two there that don't seem to care about their jobs or the guest experience.   Overall I'd recommend this place.  It's a little crowded and noisy but the food definitely makes up for it."}
{"text":"The service was pleasant energetic and genuinely friendly! We went there for the tappa brunch which I highly recommend!! It is super filling and we werent able to finish it all but the flavours were great and every dish was brought to us with a brief explanation. I would come back every weekend if I lived in Calgary. I really loved this place!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the \"paella\".  It was dry & burnt!! The entrecôte was topped with 15 bunches of green onions!!! Whatever happened to seasonal vegetables? These 2 meals we had were a total disappointment!!! The cocktails on the other hand are off the hook!!"}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of tapas, always felt it was a snack more than a meal and was never really could equate the price of the bill to the fullness in my belly.   Ox & Angela was quite a different experience, one that really emphasizes the importance of family style dining.  Tonight I went with a few good friends and we had a grand time.  Miles, our waiter was very attentive and helped us pick out wine and suggested dishes.  We ordered enough food that we were all full and satisfied and the price was reasonable.   We started with the cod fritters and the scallops and followed up with the steak and paella, this being a restaurant of Spanish cuisine, you gotta try the paella, and it was worth it.  But for me, saving the best for last was ordering the churros with chocolate sauce, the only thing that would have put me over the edge is if they served it with dulce de leche.   Next time I'll include the serrano ham.  I've heard rumours it melts in your mouth.  Good meal, good time."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough nice things about this tapas spot. Came on Saturday night around 10 and were seated right away - rad! Hostess and waitstaff were all very friendly. The cocktail list looked great, and the mint julep and mocktail were tasty. The food was delicious - pan con tomate, roasted cauliflower, meatballs, and kale salad. The dessert list had several items I would have enjoyed had I not gorged myself on the rest of the meal. Definitely recommend and would go back."}
{"text":"We went here during a business trip at the advice of a local - she knows the owners. We ordered about 3 tapas each, and it was just a little too much. My favorites were the jamon (Iberico!) - expensive but oh-so-tasty wild pig from Spain, the Tuna, and the stuffed dates. Everything we had was very good, and I will recommend it to my office mates who travel here."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 stars but considering the deal they're having during stampede (half off all food and drinks from 3-5) then that bumped it up to a 4.  We tried a bunch of different dishes off the tapas menu and all were decent but a few definitely stood out above others....Id retry the mushrooms on toast, the Spanish omelette I'd skip on the tuna (more like tuna salad then ahi), the prawns (tasted pre-frozen)...the ham was decent but it was basically just procuitto on a cutting board and the tomatoes on toast were just decent as well.  All in all I'd come back again if they have another special but I'm not sure if I'd do it for full price...unless they regularly update the tapas menu"}
{"text":"We have eaten here three times.  First two times were awesome but the third time seemed like there was a new cook in the kitchen.  The dishes we loved (mushrooms on toast being one) were poorly executed, disappointing.  The food needs to be consistent to be 4 or 5 stars.  We will give it another shot as the vibe is great, good cocktails and the service is strong.  inconsistent food, great service, awesome vibe"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and service.  Best \"old fashioned\" cocktail in town.  Good drinks selection.   I was very impressed with the food.  Will definitely go back for drinks."}
{"text":"I've visited Ox & Angela a number of times now, and the meal has been excellent every time and service impeccable.  Ox & Angela will continue to be on my list of go-to places for a great meal!"}
{"text":"This is the place I have been waiting for in Calgary. It carries an attitude and great approach to the menu and wine list. Not overwhelming, just well well done.  I struggled to post this because I want it all for myself and have no desire to see the masses fill the fantastic spot.  If you enjoy a unique approach with tapas, wine and cocktails (try the Ox, addictive) this is your place.  And the staff won't disappoint, fantastic."}
{"text":"Won't split a bill, even though food was made for couples Get a computer, make it happen. Group of 8 on a long table. Restaurant is too loud to hear anyone talk. Not good for large groups. Serving was below average. No desert offered. Had to ask for more drinks. But Food is good."}
{"text":"One of the things I crave from time to time is paella. I've only ever had it while I've traveled, but the wonderful flavors of saffron, spices and seafood infused rice is amazing. I was really excited to learn that they have it at O&A, along with refreshing sangria! When we sat down, we immediately ordered the paella (as it does note on the menu to allow time). We also ordered pan seared scallops, marinated beets, manilla steamed clams, pan roasted duck breast and the ZFC.   That atmosphere here is nice and cozy, Spanish influenced stone walls and lit by the glow of candle light.  If I didn't already love Spanish food, I definitely did after dining at O&A. Everything was so delicious, including the churros and the flan we got to end our meal."}
{"text":"So impressed with Ox and Angela.  I've been wanting to try this place for quite a while now and finally got the opportunity. And boy did they deliver on expectations.  The food was absolutely amazing. We had several tapas dishes including   Asparagus Scallops Sardines,  Braised kale Ham and cheese croquettes (daily special) Something involving tomato and a Spanish version of Prosciutto Lamb meatballs Grilled Spring inions  Every dish was fresh, beautifully presented and delicious. I'm still thinking about the scallops. Service was top notch. Our server knew the menu inside and out, made suggestions and was super friendly. She really complimented the laid back tapas kind of atmosphere. They have a nice wine list and cocktail selection too. Location was great...it was nice so we had patio seats which were slightly covered, making for an enjoyable, outside dining experience. Prices were also very reasonable, especially given the quality of the experience.  I am happy we still have a lot to try on the menu because I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"The food was 8/10, everything tastes fresh and full of flavors. Service was good but a little bit inconsistent. I have to say this place is a little bit overpriced. Overall experience was great."}
{"text":"I've been twice to Ox & Angela now. The second time didn't impress me all that much. We were a group of 10. The service was mediocre. I understand tapas are supposed to be \"small\" but I found it was hard to justify only that much food for such a high price. I was very excited to try the paella but was so disappointed that upon first bite, it seemed as if the chef had not tasted it prior to it be served. Can you say SALTY?! So much salt. Overload. It was a disaster in my mouth. Completely ruined the taste of the paella. The only thing I can say that I love are the patatas bravas, otherwise go spend your money somewhere else where you can actually see the people you are dining with - too dark in there!!"}
{"text":"Brunch yay. Rest nay. I've been here for brunch and it was so yummy, we were really looking forward for dinner. We had stuffed dates, the potatoes in tomato sauce, olives, asparagus salad and maiz. The only thing that even hit palate awesomeness was the potatoes (which they use in the brunch skillet) everything else fell very flat and uninspired. So much so that we stopped ordering so that we would discontinue the disappointment. The highlight of the dinner was the cool airrating cork in the cider. With all the choices on 17th. Dont waste a delicious culinary adventure here."}
{"text":"Great service and food! I would recommend the lamb dish and the asparagus! Amazing. Good wine list too!"}
{"text":"A group of 9 of us came last night for a birthday. 2 of us joined later and we sat with our group, ordered red sangria which was good. The place was busy so drink times were about 10 minutes. When we finally ordered our food the server told us they were out of the flatbread that we wanted so we asked for a recommendation on something else and his reply was \"all of it was good\" like sweet thanks I know you're busy but come on... my friend and I order about 4 small dishes to share and after 45 minutes we asked the server to check on the food and he did and came back saying \"I actually completely missed your order\" so I re ordered the food and it came out within the next 8-10 minutes but he never apologized OR asked if we needed anything while we waited. Which all of us being servers and bartenders as it was we thought was odd. The food was good when we got it, and it was all still on the bill although the server fucked up and forgot about it. He gave us shit service because it's \"house policy\" to add a 18% grat so he knew he was getting a tip no matter what."}
{"text":"This is a brunch review...    Excellent ruffian Spanish Tapas hangout that meets all my pet peeves that high end restaurants in Calgary normally miss; hotel silver,  well appointed fixtures, thick cloth napkins and heavy glass.    The selection is all original with a choice between a fixed tapas fare or entrees. Sharing two of the entrees the dishes were came out hot,  well presented and seasoned.  The French press coffee had the trademark aroma of Rosso roasted beans.  The waitress was very friendly,  well versed in the menu and making rexcomendations based on palate preferences.    Looking forward to trying Ox and Angela for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"The cocktails are absolutely fantastic!!! Great ambience....food meh! Nothing to write home about! They need to get a chef from Spain who knows what real paella is & teach them how to cook it."}
{"text":"I returned to Ox&Angela recently on a busy Friday evening and was kindly seated even though we had no reservation. Sitting in the corner booth, admiring the mirrored wall, cozy atmosphere whilst sippin' on my freshly prepared \"Rio Fuego\" reminded me why I heart this adorable tapas place so much..  The stuffed dates, queso, patatas bravas, lamb sausage, and fried chicken were so delicious! I would have gladly ordered from the dessert menu but I was so full I could barely walk upright! Ox&Angela: I'm quite possibly becoming your #1 fan!   5-stars!"}
{"text":"Update: I went back to see after the name changed from Ox and Angela to ox bar de tapas. I tried their Big Taste dinner menu and my favorite paella still lives up to my expectations. Yummy!  This is one of my favorite places to go now. I came here twice to confirm on how awesome it was (brunch and dinner) and both occasions pass with flying colors. I have tried all of the foods in the picture and it was all very tasty. I highly recommend their paella (discounted every Tuesday) and get Churros while you are there, it will be worth it. It is pricey but it is a great way to treat yourself. I will definitely be back for more....probably in a year...lol"}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Spanish food. I went to Ox & Angela for brunch on a recent visit to Calgary and was so impressed that I brought my friend back for dinner the same night. Both meals were fantastic, as were the cocktails and the service. Brunch was eggs baked in tomato sauce with cheese curds and crispy serrano ham served with sourdough toast. Dinner was the \"Spanish Table\": 10 courses of tapas - a great value at $45. Will definitely be heading back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"A friend walked in for a glass of wine one evening. Sat at the bar and ordered a glass. While waiting, she struck up a conversation with the guys next to her. The glass of wine never came. She asked the bartender to her response \"I can't serve you.\" When she asked the manager about it, she replied \"you made the bartender feel uncomfortable.\"  Didn't know 5' nothing middle aged women can make people feel uncomfortable.  Do your job and don't worry if the guys at the bar talk to other bar patrons and not you. Worst service story I've ever heard."}
{"text":"Great date place! If its busy the noise levels can be quite overpowering. The tapas menu is certainly tasteful, great service at the bar by bartender. Delicious food. Excellent selection of wines from all over the world. Quite pricey, I would bet on $50 a head for an evening. Well worth it though."}
{"text":"Fix. Your. Acoustics. Listen, the food is fine, but we spent the whole night yelling at each other across the table in an incredibly loud atmosphere.  We could finally have a normal conversation when the restaurant emptied out around 10pm.  I'm all for lively and animated restaurants, but this is a technical issue that needs to be solved. If you want to have a convo with your tablemates, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Finally, I got to go and try Ox & Angela. It has been on my \"to try\" list for months and I have to say I have been building it up to have quite a reputation due to all the reviews.   We decided to go for a leisure lunch on a Friday afternoon after watching the POW parade and doing some shopping in downtown/17th ave area. I liked the space and thought it was very well lit with natural light.  Now, on to the menu....I love the idea of a bunch of tapas for meals (it's my favorite) so I was really excited for this experience. We ordered the Stuffed Dates, Chorizo, Prawns, we ordered the Pan Con Tomate but were served just the grilled bread instead (I was kind of disappointed by this)   The dates were super delish and came out right away with our glasses of wine... to follow was the prawns which I have to say were a bit disappointing - I found them to be very small and tasted a bit fishy. The bread was nice and light and I found the chorizo to be full of flavour but a bit greasy.   The service was really good and I would love to come back and try more tapas!"}
{"text":"Went for a special occasion, mistake. Service was slow and unfriendly, which put a damper on the night.  The food was average. Will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"My SO and I just had a phenomenal dinner at the Ox & Angela. We got there at 7PM on a Saturday night and were able to sit down outside on the patio right away. Reservations are definitely recommended in the future if you want to sit inside. The wait staff were attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly. When we ordered our waitress made sure that we had no dietary restrictions, and she made fantastic recommendations when asked. For dinner we ordered: Dates, olives, fried goat cheese, mushrooms, potatoes, beet salad, chicken/pork meatballs, and the duck breast. We also tried two of the cocktails: the bourban & vanilla sour and the cava sofia. We had the Menut spanish red wine. Finally, though we were stuffed to the brim, we had the almond cake and two espressos for desert.   Absolutely everything was fantastic, so full of flavor and perfectly portioned. We cannot wait to return and try the brunch! I'm also positive that we could come back, not order any of the same dishes, and have an equally delicious meal."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a drink at the end of the evening. We sat at the bar - they have beautiful comfortable bar stools! I ordered a bottle of Wild Rose Velvet Fog Wheat Ale. Local and delicious. The bartender was whipping up some gorgeous looking cocktails but I was really in the mood for a beer at that point. At the end I had a glass of the Catena Alta Chardonnay. I'll just have to go back for a cocktail!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed an amazing meal. Tried the set menu. The offering was fantastic. My favourites were probably the dates, the lamb sausage, the potatoes and the salted cod cakes.  Great value. Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Was not seated until 9 with a reservation at 8 and we showed up well before that. Insanely expensive for the quality of food. $18 for 2 scallops the size of a quarter. Don't waste your time here with so many other great options in the city."}
{"text":"I had their braised lamb shank, and it was fantastic! Nice sized portion, and very well prepared. Best of all the dishes I tasted (and let's be honest, I tasted everyone's dish). I was a little disappointed that our group did not get any bread at the table, while other tables did, but I'm sure that was just an oversight. Service was fine, although slow. This was particularly noticeable since one member of our group had to leave early, and found it very difficult and slow process to get their bill and pay.  Their Los Agrios cocktail with bourbon and vanilla was fantastic. I'm so into bourbon recently! Yum! If you like bourbon, give it a try. There are many cocktails to delve into, which is both fun and dangerous. Just like my life."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service but needs a tiny but more light. we ended up using our phones for more light so we could actually read the menu.  The tapas are fantastic and really the stars of the menu. So amazing."}
{"text":"This place gets 4 starts for atmosphere and cocktails. If you're looking for authentic Spanish tapas, this isn't the place. However, if you're looking for a quiet but not too quiet place to be a grown-up and have some snacks and a nice drink, Ox and Angela is perfect.  I ordered the chicken-lamb meatballs and a green salad. The meatballs were pretty bland. The salad was actually great - not too much dressing and fresh ingredients. Having lived in Spain and Morocco, it's pretty tough to beat the real deal. I don't recall any fresh vegetables coming out with my tapas but I do remember everything having a distinct and amazing taste. The couple next to me ordered the paella which did smell incredible. I'm definitely coming back to try it.  The décor is more Mexican than Spanish but it's fun. I can deal with well done fun rather than a place that tries too hard to be cool."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Ox & Angela for a few weeks now, and a special occasion last weekend gave me the perfect excuse!  My dining partner and I were seated promptly in the restaurant side and handed menus. In the spirit of things, I ordered the 'Angela' drink, while my partner ordered the 'Ox'. It was fun, my drink was a beautiful little lychee martini garnished with an edible flower petal. The 'Ox' was a stronger drink deserving of its name.   We ordered the asparagus with soft poached egg, and cod fritters for appetizers. Yum! It was an excellent start to our meal! For the main course, I ordered the duck with mint and pomegranate, and my partner ordered the paella. We ordered the kale and patatas bravas as sides. Yep we decided to go all out and order to our heart's content!   When the food came, everything looked so beautiful! My duck was dainty and colourful on my plate and the paella looked meaty and ready to be devoured. And so we devoured. Holy, my duck was delicious! I tried my partner's paella - mouth-watering! So were the kale and papatas bravas! Everything was SO well executed and expertly prepared, the kitchen staff deserved kudos.   I asked the waiter for a glass of his preferred Zinfandel, and got a very robust red wine which I fell in love with. For dessert, we ordered some churros, after reading Angelo's rave reviews. The raves were justified it seems, because those little fried sugared pieces were addictive!  It is worth mentioning that the service was top-notch as well, nobody ever let our water glass go empty for longer than 10 seconds. There were about 2-3 wait staff servicing the entire dining area, and they were quick, friendly and efficient.   My dining partner and I both had a wonderful time and felt it was a great decision to choose Ox & Angela as the restaurant for our special occasion. Great new restaurant in a great new location with top notch kitchen and wait staff!  P.S. You know a meal is exceptional when you wake up the next morning thinking about it because that's exactly what happened to me!"}
{"text":"The patatas de la mañana was literally a giant bowl of potatoes, the sauce had a strong BBQ taste and over powered the pork belly, egg, and everything else that was in it. I was so excited to taste the fried pork belly but unfortunately it was more like bacon bits. I'm a huge fan of pork belly and it was definitely lost in this dish. This tasted like what should have been a side dish served with a serving of meat, but it was instead served in a big bowl. Personally not to my liking."}
{"text":"If you're looking for shareable plates and wine, this is a must, service was friendly, sharing guidance along the way."}
{"text":"A great place to get some sangria! Doesn't matter if you like red or white, both are delicious. Full of fruit, wine, and liquor; it goes down smooth and one glass and you can start to feel nice and relaxed. I would recommend the picture though, because one isn't enough. I've heard that in the summer that they come out with a rosé sangria that has a nice rosé wine, cava, and lemon and orange liquor. Can't wait to come back to try that one on the patio.  The wait staff is incredibly friendly. They went out of their way to make sure everything was a great meal, or in this case, drinks. It's also a bit lower key than the areas around; a nice change of pace from the normal 17th Ave experience."}
{"text":"We've had brunch and lunch here a number of times and always leave satisfied. Delicious food selection and very cool ambience. Make sure you aren't in a rush if you're ordering the paella, or just order it straight away once seated, because it does take awhile to prepare.   Works nicely for larger parties. We look forward to returning for dinner next time!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed with the portion sizes, and while the food was good, it didn't offset the lack thereof. We purchased the day's special sampler, and for the price ($35) we left very hungry. I guess I ether expect the cost to be lower or the portions to be larger. Food was very decent in terms of quality."}
{"text":"Paella was excellent! Aparagus appetizer also very good with an eclectic mix of garnishes (egg, orange and cheese) that I would never think to put together but paired really well."}
{"text":"I like. I really like. This brand new spot in Calgary on 17th is just the kind of place that makes me feel right at home. I'm not sure if it's the inviting Plantation design of the interior, the delicious and innovative craft-cocktail menu, or the delicious food... okay well it's probably all three that will get me rolling back in as soon as I set foot in Cow-town again. This is about as far from what I'd expect to find in a place like Calgary as you can get. And I would consider it to be all full of win.   I only dined on the bar side of this gorgeous Argentinean joint but I am 100% sold. And all it really took was a couple of tapas and some cocktails. The bar at O&A is open until late, and so is the kitchen (1:45!). They serve up a limited menu of tapas including oxtail empanadas, beef and fish tacos, ceviche, papas fritas and a few other options. Upon the recommendation of the server we got the papas ($9), a downright incredible yet simple dish of smashed yellow potatoes that are then fried and tossed in rosemary, salt, lime and Cholula. This salty, tangy dish is deepened with the rosemary for a complete savory experience. The empanadas ($3 for $12), while a tad on the doughy side, are filled with a fantastic stewed/pulled oxtail meat. Another win. Both of these dishes had me excited to try the tacos (3 for $12) and the ceviche.   On the cocktail front, I had a very creative take on an old fashioned made with aged rum and muddled white grapes. A hint of apple/pear rounded out an off-dry cocktail with a luscious smoothness of an oaked rum. My companion savored her floridita - Hemingway-styled daquiri with an added touch of a grapefruit float. A little more tart than I would normally like but I was impressed nonetheless. Another option on the menu that had me chomping at the bit was the manhattan made with rested tequila. A desire I had to shelve for a future visit. At $12/drink for these carefully hand-made libations made with call spirits, I can say without a doubt value was had.  If O&A's cocktails and food are indicative of what is to come for the food scene in Calgary, I can say that I'm excited to return and do some exploring,"}
{"text":"So loud with the whomp whomp \"mood\" music that everyone was yelling to hear over it. Good food or not, having to wear ear plugs for supper is not our idea as a night out. Tables are small and crowded so enjoy bumping elbows with your neighbor who is yelling across the table to be heard. Food withstanding this is not a place we will visit or recommend."}
{"text":"Happy hour and reverse happy hour - that's what I'm talking about. Great room and awesome cocktails. Wether you want a quick bite, a full meal or just a cocktail this is your spot."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times. Delicious share plates. Great service and perfect date night place. Love it here! Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, really loved the food, wine, and decor.  Reasonable prices. I would definitely come back here:)"}
{"text":"Went in for drinks only. Had a couple blood orange Margaritas and they were amazing.  jayme working front of house was perfect. Room was busy and had a great vibe.."}
{"text":"Had lunch there on the weekend. Staff was great. Food was good but not fantastic. I was kind of surprised. The Paella was very bland."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. Service was beyond amazing. The food was plates to share. Some were fantastic others were just ok. This place is extremely loud. We had to yell to talk to each other across the table. If you don't mind a very loud atmosphere for dinner than you would like it here. If you want a nice casual conversation over dinner I would not suggest doing it here. Due to the noise level I personally would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Why can't I give more than 5 stars?!! You have to come here. Not only do they have amazing drinks and food, they have best happy hour. 50% off everything at the bar between 5-7pm.   For drinks, I got a bartender special (2x it was so good - a cucumber gin concoction) and choked up. Bf got meat hook and the fragrant.   For food, we got the pork and veal meatballs (could really taste that manchego cheese, yum), roasted cauliflower (the apple chutney was amazing), and salt cod croquettes (with an amazing aioli).   Lastly and most importantly, service was fantastic. Our bartender Tom was brilliant and also helpful (even helped us get an extra seat in by asking 10 people at the bar to shift a seat over), food came super fast, and the host was really accommodating and even shared patrons favorite tapas and drinks.   Saw a review about loud music - FYI I didn't mind it at all. Actually loved how lively this restaurant was. Great music was being played!!   I wish we were staying in Calgary longer! We will definitely be back. Thanks Guys!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Spanish tapas!! And this from someone who has been to Spain!! The menu portion where they bring out a set listing of tapas is the best! The food is amazing and is such a treat as usually they are items you would never make at home.  And don't underestimate how full you will be by the conclusion of all your small portions! We love it and will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This is no comparison to Ox & Angela The ambience is more akin to a bar with no ability to have a conversation without yelling. Sitting is crowded and food is very limited in palette. There are no surprises or food that just wows you with its uniquiness or taste profile. And my daughter says \"do not bring your discerning kids\"!!! ps price is high for this menu."}
{"text":"This place is great! Been here before and the patatas bravas are an absolute must. There a great combination of crunchy and warm and gooey. Warning though, they are addictive. On Sundays they have \"paella patio\" where they offer a $10 plates of paella. The servers are warm and friendly and attentive. Tip: eat inside the patios are small and the wooden benches aren't very comfortable. They are great for people watching though. Try this place out of you're in cowtown."}
{"text":"had several of their tapas and thought everything was just oK. The scallops, squash and the clams were our favourite. I wouldnt get the beets again as they werent anything special. Patatas bravas (supreme) was a good dish that was very filling."}
{"text":"A great place for a fun night out, the $25 pour on's on the weekends are pretty dangerous if you don't do well with a hangover.   My only complaint is that it's very pricey, so don't expect to be leaving with much of your cash remaining."}
{"text":"Good vibe and great tacos on the bar side.. They also have the best cocktail in town.. Great addition in the Calgary food scene.... Go there and enjoy."}
{"text":"A friend and I are visiting from California and decided to have dinner in this awesome little spot. As it was valentine's day the only available spots were the bar and we were sat immediately. We were assisted by Taylor and his partner behind the bar was Steven. Both were amazing, attentive, and excellent bartenders. The food was amazing and we have the absolute best time. The service was what made this place over the top. Just wonderful people, and Taylor offered us suggestions around Calgary for our stay and some advice for our trip to the Saddledome the following day as we were here to see some hockey. :) A big thank you to them and the wonderful chef. You guys were awesome."}
{"text":"Awesome wine and food. Sat at the bar and the staff was super friendly and accommodating. Was there with two friends visiting from Louisiana. I'm vegan- my friends are not- and they did a couple of dishes just for me."}
{"text":"Great service, our waitress was fantastic and added to a great evening out. The food was very good, the tomato toast tapas was soggy though. One annoying thing is that they don't answer the phone. We made a reservation online without any problem but we were running a bit late and there was no way to let them know. Overall a terrific experience, it is easy to lose yourself for a few hours here."}
{"text":"This is a great Spanish tapas place. Some of the food is a little adventurous, so it is not for the average Calgary diner. You order many small dishes to share. I recommend the paella. There is a good amount of vegetarian choices, which makes my wife happy."}
{"text":"Sat down and then walked out after seeing that rabbit meat was served on the menu.  Rabbits are the third most common household pet, so this is the equivalent of serving dog or cat meat in my opinion. I own a fully trained, very intelligent house bunny and it makes me incredibly sad to see one as an option on a menu for dinner."}
{"text":"love what they did with the place! service was sub par, wine was WAY over priced but the drinks were good. food was good but nothing amazing I would say try it for something different but it might not be able place you frequent."}
{"text":"I don't know how I haven't reviewed this place before! As always, the food and service is amazing here!   Came here last week for my birthday dinner and everything was delish! We had the Lamb sausage, flat iron steak, scallops, duck breast, zucchini, cauliflower, potatoes and asparagus. My fave was the duck and the cauliflower, as I love both! Everything had great flavor and they ensured it was gluten free for me.   For drinks I went with the bourbon and vanilla sour, which was probably one of the best cocktails I have ever had. Dale was our server and was fantastic, came around just enough, made sure we were well fed and our drinks were full.   I am definitely adding this to the regular rotation!"}
{"text":"Brunch was pretty good... at least for 2 of 3 diners in our party. The more \"classic\" breakfast orders were delicious. Eggs were \"fried\" to perfection and the accompanying hash was an original take on a breakfast staple. Unfortunately, the supposedly more deeply Spanish inspired dish, the \"paella-like breakfast noodle\", promoted by our server, was disappointing. To us, this noodle dish seemed like a mish-mash of cheap ingredients one could readily find in their pantry and freezer at home - think $1/bag Asian vermicelli noodles, frozen green peas, overcooked sausage and a dollop of random white sauce thrown together in a skillet and baked by an inebriated person.  Because I was one of the lucky ones to have completely enjoyed my order, I would dine again at Ox & Angela. I can't say the same for my brunch buddy who ordered the noodle dish, however."}
{"text":"So, we went to Ox and Angela for my mother's birthday. It's pretty dark inside, but it feels cozy. The service we had all night was OUTSTANDING. Our official waitress was fun and understanding and had great opinions about the menu.  We ordered the stuffed dates, piquillo peppers, fried goat cheese, marinated beets, mushrooms on toast, carrots and squash, and the ZFC! The food was SPECTACULAR. The dates were perfectly balanced with the cheese and walnuts - we had them remove the ham because my mother is vegetarian, but it was still delicious. The fried goat cheese was by far my favourite part of the night - we had it served with bruschetta on bread and everything worked so well together. The mushrooms on toast were also a big hit - the egg was poached PERFECTLY. The only criticisms I have would be that the beets lacked some flavour, but the overall dish was balanced, and the carrots could have been cooked for a while longer. Lastly, the ZFC was nothing to write home about. There was hardly any flavour in the breading or the chicken itself, and to be honest, my sister and I both got sick from it, which sucked.  Overall, I would definitely return because my overall experience was very good! Oh, last thing I wanted to mention - the waitress said the best way to eat here is to order about two tapas dishes per person, then add any of the bar snacks on top of that, and this formula worked perfectly for us. Another tip - almost everything comes in threes, so prepare for that."}
{"text":"I understand house policy is adding gratuity for parties however I didn't know it was also house policy to \"forget\" to ring in food and not follow up with the customer for 55 minutes. The enter night was absolute crap because the server knew he was going to get gratuity regardless he didn't give a shit how awful he was being ... Gratuity is a choice and I don't feel as this server deserves 18%, maybe 10% because I'm not a dick. his response to my complaint was \"ok\".  Get real ox !! it's time to have a hirering fair and get new servers, the economy's bad in Calgary nobody is going to want to come to a expensive establishment if the service is shit..you can get better service at McDonald's next to ranchmans at 2am just sayin"}
{"text":"This place is my go to for brunch, they have a three course brunch meal deal and it's fantastic. I love going with my bestie and stuffing my face. There are these stuffed date things that are incredible! You will waddle out of this place after those three courses. I have never had to wait, the staff always greet us as soon as we get there and I always leave satisfied. However, I recently went there for dinner and had a less then pleasant experience with one of the waiters. He was quite impatient and a bit rude. He seemed to be annoyed that we didn't order the recommended 3 tapas per person. Instead, my friend and I have three tapas to share. He asked us several times if we wanted anything besides water and made us feel uncomfortable. I understand that this is a nice restaurant but I believe his job is to assure we have a good experience. I was really disappointed as I have had great service here in the past."}
{"text":"Excellent execution in Spanish classics!  I didn't think Ox could get better and well, they did. They dropped an impressive menu that makes it worth going back for over and over.  Their patatas bravas will always be the top of the game. Crispy potatoes smothered with a sweet and savoury bravas sauce that you wish you could drink. Speaking of drinks, their sangrias were amazing. You can't just have the white without trying the red (and vice versa).  A few years ago I had their empanadas and was bummed it was taken off their menu. But it's back! But with a whole new spin. It's made with a buttery pastry filled with tasty oily pork belly that's just beyond words. To further spoil the tastebuds, the bravas sauce comes on the side.  Their seafood paella is also a must. It's an amazing deal when you're sharing it with two people. Generous portions of fresh succulent seafood and well executed spanish rice. If you've been depriving yourself of carbs and this dish is your middle finger to your Atkins/Keto diet.  I was also impressed with the price tag considering this is upscale dining. Def will be coming back."}
{"text":"3-times to Ox & Angela for 3 different reasons and each time was solid, solid, solid!! Here's 3 different situations where Ox & Angela is going to be the right place for you.  1: Family Birthday Dinner - Went here with my two sisters to celebrate all of our birthdays as they're all somewhat close to each other. We wanted to treat ourselves to something nice, eat great food and buys lots of wine. Ox & Angela has a dividing wall through the middle and sections the restaurant into a more lounge style right side and a more restaurant style left side. It was a dinner so we opted for the left. For food we went with the Spanish Table. It's $45/person and has way more courses than I can remember. I'm so happy that we ordered this for a few reasons. Everything was fan-freaking-tastic, is one of the big reasons, and the second is that we got to embark on the food adventure together. D'aww! You know when you're out for dinner, everyone is having a good, the food arrives and the conversation come to a complete halt with everyone stuffing their face with their separate, massive orders. O&A isn't like that. With everyone eating the same thing at the same time, you get to \"ooooohh\" and then \"ahhhhh\", and then \"mmmmm\" in unison.   Dinner becomes a conversation starter instead of a conversation ender. From family meals to dinner dates, the social style of eating at Ox & Angela makes for a truly enjoyable experience. Oh, and did I mention the food is fan-freaking-tastic!  2: First date!!! - Did you know this internet thing has ways of introducing you to other people that you can meet in real life (or the \"RL\" as all the cool kids are calling it)?! Fancy, right? And now you find out that you were apparently charming enough to get someone to meet you in person, but they still don't know much about you - where you choose to go can speak volumes. Where do you go?   You want to go somewhere with character, maybe a touch of class, but still casual enough for you to come as you are (I'm speaking as if my choices are reflective of most people and I can assure you they are not, but read on..) that is decently low commitment if things aren't working out, but will be enough entertainment if they are. Check out the right side of Ox & Angela and check out their cocktails. They're delicious, creative, and make for good conversation starters.. especially at no less than 2 oz a piece to help you up your people skills."}
{"text":"Had a 5 star salad, 1 star toast with tomato, 3 star meat ball, 3 star potato dish  Service excellent  Smushing tomatoes onto toast did not work, arrived cold, soggy, let me smush it onto crisp toast from a side dish 1/5  Meatball sauce very nice, texture of meatballs like sawdust, no flavor, the too fine texture did not provide a good mouth feel 3/5  Patates bravas more like fried potatoes in buffalo sauce 3/5  Highlight was the dish I was worried about when I ordered it, the Zucchini salad, I will come back just for this dish. Thin slices marinated, almonds ? pine nuts?, manchego cheese WOW wonderful 5/5"}
{"text":"I feel ambivalent about this one. I liked Ox & Angela, the tapas and drinks were quality. There's a certain vibe to it and being on 17th, definitely a cool factor. Comparatively though, if you placed O&A in any great food city, would it stand out? Doubt it. If I'm strolling 17th and in the mood for tapas, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Calling all people in the dating scene....This place just never gets old for me. I went recently for my Sister's birthday with the family and we were not disappointed. They  now have this set menu of four or five courses of the Chef's specialty, so all of us ordered it.... wow. so yum!! This would be the prefect choice for a date!   Daters, get on this!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance at this place. It's a perfect date spot. Our server was incredibly nice and attentive. Our cocktails were delicious. The food was pretty good overall although there were some things I probably would not try again. It is a bit pricey, but such is the case with most tapas restaurants."}
{"text":"Oh wow. This place was surprisingly great.  Professional bar tender. Food was delicious and nothing to complain about ."}
{"text":"Its a tapas restaurant so nothing has to do with the portion sizes. However, the last time I ate here was about a year or a year and a half ago.  This was before they underwent their renovations.  I personally enjoyed the restaurant better before the renovations. Now it is very dark on the outside and before it seemed more warm and inviting and friendly when it was white not when it is now dark blue and black.  I came on a Saturday afternoon and there were about 5 tables full of people and their was only 1 server and 1 cook!  The server none the less was also the bartender! Therefore, it took forever to get food and drinks and orders taken, etc.  ALso, there were a TON of flies al over the restaurant and always buzzing around which made it extremely uncomfortable to eat our food.  I was surprised to see that after the renovations the brunch menu has not changed at all!! Maybe the dinner one has but the brunch menu is exactly the same. The only thing they changed is that the omelettes that you got with tapas are now gone and they replaced it with a heap of procuttio.  As well the sangria has diminished. Before I would say Ox had the best sangria in the city because they put a burning clove in that made it amazing! Now it is probably the worst. It is bland and nothing special!  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"You have to go! The service was excellent, and the food even better!  Chef Rene outdid himself (and was great to chat with) and ask Johnny behind the bar about slapping mint, a fun time! Looking forward to the next dining experience, it isn't just a meal! We had a selection of tapas, white wine sangria and paella. I hear they are closing and doing some renos but not for long and will be open for business again!"}
{"text":"One word. Sangria. GET IT.  Great atmosphere for a date.  Food is not bad. Their paella and potato bravos are pretty good. Dessert menu could use some work but overall a great place to share a pitcher of sangria with your friends."}
{"text":"Exceptional experience.  Each dish we ordered was unique in its own way. We couldn't wait to see what would come out next.  The service was wonderful - there was even a wedding party (testament to the quality of the restaurant, if you ask me) going on while we were there, and our server still was attentive.   Would absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"Good tapas is something to cherish because it is not as common as you might think. This place, formerly known as \"Ox & Angela,\" does tapas very well: small plates with big flavour. But this is Alberta, Texas' northern cousin, so the plates aren't so small. The patatas bravas are amazing. The beef filet is nicely done and accompanied by a tasty salsa verde (they recently started accenting this dish with anchovies, which I think is heavy handed relative to the flavour of the beef but some might like the combination). The setting is very nice, located on one of Calgary's nicer walking streets (in summer) and the staff are attentive and well versed in the fine selections on the menu."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Calgary!  I have been here a number of times and have had a fantastic and unique experience each time. The atmosphere is colorful and cozy, the menu is exciting and not overly expensive, the food is very flavorful and well executed, cocktails are top shelf, excellent wine list and professional servers.  Great work!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Our group tried almost every Tapas selection on the menu and were very happy. Also had the steak and some sides, very good."}
{"text":"First impression: this place is really, really noisy. The fact that all the tables were packed close together and the music was also blasting didn't help. My husband and I were sandwiched between two loud groups. No ambience whatsoever. Couldn't hear anything my husband said. Just random women yelling.  Food portion was very small. We ordered 8-9 dishes to share and left unsatisfied. Some dishes are pretty delicious. We liked the octopus a lot. Others are not so noteworthy. If you are on a diet and have a lot of money to spend on average food. This is the place to go.   It's a shame that I had such high expectation for this place. Will not return again."}
{"text":"Another fantastic meal at Ox and Angela tonight!  I met an old friend for early dinner and was not disappointed. They have changed the menu in the last few weeks so we were not able to get some of my old favourites but that prompted me to order a couple of new things which were delicious. My most favourite is the mushroom toast and they didn't take that off so we can still be friends. I can't wait to go back in a couple of months and see what else they come up with."}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are beyond amazing (and I live in San Francisco). This is probably one of the best happy hours I've ever been to. The half price food and drink menu (yep... the whole thing) was amazing. Pork and Veal meatballs, cod croquettes, and cauliflower ( with and amazing chutney) were all perfect.   I hardly ever post on Yelp, but am definitely a foodie. You gotta try this place. Happy hour is from 5-7 and only at the bar. Tom is a friendly and knowledgeable bartender... he definitely knows the trade well. This place is a must if visiting Calgary!"}
{"text":"I've been a few times, and each time it has exceeded my expectations!  Tapas have a notion of tiny things that leave one hungry, but not here! Portions are made for sharing, each dish was explained as it appeared on the table, and they seemed to time it all so that there was always a new dish but not too many plates on the table. and they even added an extra meat ball so that the 4 of us could have 1 each!   Very enjoyable time, worked out to about 60 per person, that includes a pitcher of sangria plus one cocktail each so all in all it is a great deal for the quality of the dining.  I've also had their brunch set menu, it was 25 per person, but SO much food we couldn't finish it all.  I recommend the potatas bravas, meat balls, and stuffed dates!"}
{"text":"We had the pre-set menu. It was nice to have a taste of different things. Some veggie, some meat and some fish. My friend of I had a great time here, chatting and enjoying the night. However, it was a little loud in there. The service was really good and good came out quite fat as well."}
{"text":"Went for brunch with the husband and in-laws. All of our food was phenomenal, from the Catalan Breakfast to the basket of fresh baked pastries, mmm. We all had coffee, which was top-notch, and my eggs benedict came with a perfectly poached egg, easily meeting my high egg standards. Seriously, no complaints, and the place itself is so cool, it really feels like the place to be on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try out Ox and Angela last night, I have to say I'm kind of sad that we hadn't gotten around to trying it sooner.  The menu has changed so none of the items previous reviewers talked about were available anymore but everything that we tried was very good.  Some of our favorites: Tapas: Salt Cod Fritters Asparagus with soft poached egg and truffles Manchego with walnuts and Pomegranate molases    Mains: Chicken Flat Iron Steak  As others have mentioned it was a bit pricey but the service was stellar and all the food was amazing so it didn't seem unreasonable.  We visited on a wednesday night and the restaurant side was packed with a healthy crowed on the bar side.  So I would highly suggest making a reservation especially if you want to sit on the restaurant side."}
{"text":"The food here is terrific. It's an \"order to share\" kind of menu with a variety that will please any tastes.  Overall the service (particularly on drinks) was slow. But it's easy to forgive that right now as it is a very new venue.  I highly recommend the chorizo as an entree & the olives as an appetizer."}
{"text":"It has been over a year (Dec. 2011) since we last visited Ox & Angela and wow has it changed.  The once Goth like decor has been replaced with cream coloured walls and a very modern touch.  I like the new look, but we also liked the old look.  Other changes we noticed is last time we had a dinner menu to choose from as we were sitting on the restaurant side.  This time I requested the tapas side and noticed they only have one menu available for the entire restaurant.  This was a little confusing  since there were a couple larger items available on the menu but it was mostly tapas.  When I asked the waiter about the old menu he didn't seem to know about it.  I still remember the meal and the menu (memorable) so we know it existed once upon a time....all good either way.  We were meeting my cousin & his GF for dinner and started with a cocktail while we awaited their arrival.  I ordered a glass of the Sangria all the while having flashbacks to many times spent at La Bodega in Van.  It was delicious.  The other party arrived and we were off to the races.  I really wanted to try the Spanish Table, but the other couple wasn't as adventurous.  So following recommendations from our fabulous waiter we decided on 7 dishes for the table; asparagus, patatas bravas, prawns, chorizo, lamb meatballs, pork loin special, boccadilo.  I could write a book explaining every dish in detail as it still lingers in my mind but it would take too long.  Highlights were the asparagus, lamb meatballs, boccadilo and of course patatas bravas (chorizo nice too).  The pork loin was a bit on the fatty side for some of us (my carnivore hubs loved it) but that was quickly rectified by the waiter.  The prawns were smallish, but still tasty.  The girls enjoyed our wine with dinner while the boys had beer.  Dessert was churros (an absolute must here) and creme brulee finished with a glass of port (another old Vancouver habit I am reclaiming).  We enjoyed ourselves as much as the last time."}
{"text":"I love this place but most of all I love how amazing the bartender AMY is!  If you watch her carefully you will notice the care and tenderness that she flourishes on every single drink she creates.  I have officially partaked in the best mojito of my life here and my friend had the most delightful leechie cocktail with a floating flower!  Ox and Angela sits quaintly on 17th ave SW and is one of the most relaxing and the most pretty atmospheres on the strip.  Dark mood lighting and shabby chic decor embrace the restaurant/bar and the food menu is as wonderful experience as what the cocktails have to offer. We had the fish, the scallops and the manchego. All so delightful.  I honestly think Ox and Angela is one of the best additions to the culinary bar scene in Calgary."}
{"text":"We went here for a late night dinner with some friends on a Friday night. We were able to get a table for 8:30pm.  When we arrived, they didn't have a table for us because the diners before us were 1.5 hours late for their reservation.  They were able to clean another table for us and move some furniture around and we were seated in 10 minutes so it wasn't a big deal since our friends weren't there yet.   On Fridays and Saturdays, a bottle of wine is $25 if you drink it from a Porron which is a decanter that you drink out of and share with everyone at the table. They take all the wine glasses away and if you get cause using a glass - the wine goes to full price.  Drinking from the Porron was a lot of fun and we would definitely do it again.   We tried several of the dishes and everything was pretty tasty and easy to share.  We had a few vegetarians and this place was perfect for it. We had the toast with tomato, tomato crustini, mussel crustini, pork belly crustini, fried brussel sprouts, fried artichokes, mushrooms with truffle oil, eggs on sourdough, chicken and pork meatballs and the fried chicken.  The standout dishes of the night were toast with tomato, fried chicken, fried brussel sprouts and the fried artichokes."}
{"text":"Reserved a table for Sunday brunch double date via OpenTable.  Shared a brunch paella and sourdough bread with my girlfriend.  Nice that they give you the option of still or sparkling water for no extra charge.    The paella takes at least 45 minutes to prepare and it was pretty delicious.  I can't comment on the authenticity of it, but the pork belly was great, the sausage was alright, the flavors were good.  It was not as crispy as I would've liked my paella to be.  It went great with their green chili sauce ($1.50 well spent) on the side.  The sourdough bread was good, they served it with butter and rhubarb jam on the side.    Overall service was good, food was good and easy to make reservations.  Just keep in mind if you don't eat pork (our companions didn't), you will want to go elsewhere since there are only two brunch items on the menu that don't naturally have pork in them and they don't really do substitutes with other proteins."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food was amazing. No kidding!  Came here with friends from Vancouver. We told the server to pick 6 items of the restaurant top favorite. He did an awesome job.  So he picked for us 1. Hongos (which were mushrooms with crustini) 2. Patatas Bravas (potatoes) 3. Steak 4. Pllo Frito (chicken) 5. Octopus 6. Gambas (shrimps) and complementary crustini  Everyone of the dishes above were delicious. My favorite was the potatoes and chicken. The chicken was done perfectly with the meat still very juicy and outside crispy. Potatoes lots of sauce but the combination of the sauces goes well with the dish. I am glad we had our server order for us. I mean we stared at the menu and because we don't read or speak Spanish we had no idea. Overall a very satisfying meal. And you know this is a fancy restaurant when they call garlic bread, crustini.  Parking is hit and miss. The area that this restaurant is in is super busy. So be prepare to walk and it depends how lucky you are with the parking. décor was nice and clean.   Highly recommend giving this place a visit."}
{"text":"I've never been to a spanish restaurant so I was very excited to try Ox and Angela and  after having to wait  nearly the entire summer I was able to do just that. We came here for drinks and they were great! There is tons of variety when it comes to beverages but the menu is a little limited. Unfortunately, we arrived during the hour where the kitchen was closed so we were only able to order limited food. The food we did order was great, though I'm kind of bummed that I couldn't try more stuff!   The servers were very friendly and I fell in love with the eclectic feel of the restaurant. The walls of mirrors is beautiful, I'd come here if not only to stare at the decor."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great renovations store owners looks amazing and very open and bright now. This place has turned from great to AWESOME with the Reno's because it's not very opening and inviting. The food is FANTASTIC, always greatly spiced and flavored. If you enjoy European food THIS IS IT.  The drink menu is awesome here. I strongly recommend Sangria, it's always amazing here.  Service is good, could use a little work, the staff seem a little stuffy to me but whatever they do an alright job.  9/10"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and received great service. Tasty food, and tall frosty drinks. I will visit again"}
{"text":"What was once the dark wooded Bungalow is now a bright and airy upscale half resto/half bar. I've heard good things about Ox & Angela to date and decided to take Don B to this new spot while he was up visiting from Portland.  The highlights: The cocktails (oh so many deliciously curated ones! I sipped on the Floridita, yum!) The bar menu (a handful of sharing plates available, we shared the empenadas and the patatas fritas) The decor (as I mentioned, very light. The walls are all white and it's a clean and uncluttered feel and scene) The service (our server had great recommendations and spoke knowledgeably about both the food and the drink selections) The hours (the selection of sharing plates on the bar side are available until 1:45 am... yes on a weeknight!)  The feedback: You must try the patatas fritas. They were recommended to us by the host at the door and by our server.   The empanadas are up for debate. They were good, but a little too doughy for my liking.  Also, come on in with the expectation of paying $12 for your cocktail and in the $12-$15 range for your sharing plates. It's a bit on the higher priced side for Calgary, but you're getting what you pay for here.   This was a treat. I've been perusing the full menu on the website. Looking forward to checking it out for dinner sometime!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance! Great place for drinks, dinner, apps, etc... One side of the resto is for reservations only, and the other is kinda first come first serve. I just had a drink and a few apps and dessert.  Everything was good except the churros... they were pretty hard on the outside.. and then raw in the middle :(  so we told the waiter and he took it off our bill. Hopefully a one time thing. And my drink was a bit on the skimpy side in quantity.  I believe Thurs is 1/2 price on food and drinks from 3-6pm... not sure if it's only a few items or the whole menu."}
{"text":"I haven't had such amazing service in a 17th ave establishment.. well, EVER.  I stopped by here with a large group of friends to celebrate the launch of a good friends' project. We weren't sure how many people would show up, had no idea what we wanted to eat and we were really looking for a chill but swanky venue. This place came highly recommended.  When I arrived, nobody else from my group was there yet. An extremely nice lady who called me sweety asked if she could help me, and I said I was just waiting to see if anyone else had gotten there yet. She invited me to sit at the bar while I waited and said if I needed anything I could tap her on the shoulder.   While I sat at the bar I had a conversation with the bar tender about Russia - traveling there, the Canadians recent loss to the Russian team and so on. He was genuinely interested in conversation - not trying to inflate his tips. I was, once again, impressed. When my group arrived I shook his hand and moved over to the restaurant side of the joint.  I should reiterate - we had no idea how big our group was going to get. That makes a lot of places awfully nervous and annoyed. The staff here accommodated with smiles on their faces and \"sweeties\" all over the place. I wish I could remember the one lady's name - she was absolutely charming, joking with us, taking drink orders - and even returning my jacket which I had completely forgotten on my bar stool. The best part? She remembered my name from the ONE time I had told it to her over an hour earlier. Go ahead, ask your 1410 waitress your name at the end of the meal. They'll need to check your credit card.  Now, the food! We had tapas. One of the girls suggested we let her order for us. She ordered food in sufficient variety and quantity without breaking the bank! We had fish fritters, almonds, a zucchini salad, a chicken dish and so many more awesome things (more or less everything from the tapas menu).   I tried every dish - favorites including the prawns, a cheese plate and that salad. Everything was great. My glass of water was never empty and I never had to wait to be asked if I wanted anything else.  We were so well taken care of that I told our staff I'd be leaving a great review, to which they responded with sincere thanks and invited us back.  The people here GET IT. They get that people come to your restaurant or bar for an experience and they completely delivered."}
{"text":"I can't remember the names of the dishes we tried, but everything we did try was fantastic! We had brownies, churros, the steak, cod fish, and some other dishes. Our bill came to $100 and we only ordered water to drink, so it is certainly higher-priced.   My complaint is the noise level. We barely talked at all because I felt like I had to scream at the top of my lungs to get a word across the table."}
{"text":"Friendly service, tasty food, and a mixed but mature crowd. A nice respite from the pub scene on 17th Av"}
{"text":"This place has a wicked ambience. Service was on point. Food was delicious. I would highly recommend. It's not too casual of an environment, but not insanely upscale. You can dress up or go business casual.  And no the owners didn't go through a divorce leading to the name change! Lol we asked. Apparently the Ox and Angela was meant to represent the masculine and feminine sides of the restaurant previously. Now they renovated and the whole place is more of a lounge atmosphere leaving them just with the masculine Ox;)"}
{"text":"Every time I come here it's exceeded my expectations. The happy hour is killer with half price tapas and half price drinks. Try the feature gin cocktail which is alway stellar. Pretty sure we put back 20 pintxo Gilda's.. don't ask just taste !"}
{"text":"I was once under the impression that having a perfect cocktail in Calgary was nearly impossible...then I went to Ox & Angela. Hands down the best Old Fashioned I've ever had (along with many others!).  With a dynamic cocktail list, a food menu full of adventure and with fun, knowledgeable staff, Ox & Angela has hit the nail on the head. This place is exactly what Calgary has been missing for far too long. The cool, relaxed, easy going atmosphere is synonymous with passing the time alongside friends and family and invites you to stay and enjoy (which isn't a difficult task there).   All of that adds up and make this fine establishment one of my easy favorites and a place to return to many times in the future. 10 thumbs, a toe and two shots up for Ox & Angela!!  Cheers and happy yelping!"}
{"text":"The bovine must be a significant contributor to a business to receive top billing over poor Angela.  The Ox could be a dude I guess.  There are celebrities named after stones, liquid fuel, and money, so why not.  Ox & Angela (which could be compressed to O&A...but I never will) is a Spanish tapas restaurant balancing the knife of edge of what defines tapas.  Don't get me wrong, it's good, and my crystal ball foretells an extremely positive review, but I adhere to the tradition demanding a tapas restaurant list dozens upon dozens of options for people to pull from.  I've been to some with literally sixty options.    Tapas must be difficult for a restaurant to offer given the number of options required.  You have to support a large enough staff to handle the orders, or else freeze everything beforehand, a horrid idea leading my preference to limited tapas over a menu offering the world stuck in an ice age.  That being said, a successful restaurant in a town like Calgary shouldn't have that problem.  Ox & Angela offers less than thirty options that can be classed as actual tapas.  Not bad, could be more, but far beyond some of the insults to the name I've been to.  A local business in my hometown only features tapas in title only, renaming the appetizers page.  A disgrace.  Ox & Angela is birthed from Mary's womb in comparison.  However, to enjoy the full experience, the suggestion is to order the \"The Spanish Table\", which is, let's be honest, actually a chef's menu--a set list of small plates (about ten).  At $45 per person, such a menu is a remarkable deal.  I've spent triple that on some tasting menus.    The décor is charming, with a wall splitting the establishment.  I love restaurants that do this--it increases intimacy, but more importantly, it greatly decreases sound pollution.  I've been in colossal restaurants where one cannot hear friends across a table.  Ox & Angela takes it one step further by altering the décor in each half, leading me to think one side is the Ox while the other side is the Angela.  I would wager I was on the Angela side...it looked more feminine.    There were three of us that day, a day where the The Spanish Table was $10 off.  Given its two person minimum, it became the obvious choice.  Each course was shared, and of course, it had to open with olives, followed by Persian dates wrapped with serrano ham and stuffed with manchego cheese, walnuts, and coated in pomegranate molasses.  Sharing that plate was dry cured Spanish serrano ham.  Then came the (apparently) famous croquettes with salt cod, potato allioli (not a spelling mistake, the Spaniards add an \"L\") and chili oil.  So far, so good.  What was elaborately described as toasted pan rustica with crushed tomatoes, garlic, and extra virgin olive oil was really a mouthful for bruschetta.  After that was a personal favorite, albacore tuna with tomato relish and crispy capers.  It remained a favorite for about three minutes, followed by something that shouldn't have been amazing but was--ensalada escalivada--charred marinated vegetables, whipped goat cheese, and anchovies.  Yes, anchovies.  After which, we had a butter lettuce salad with toasted walnuts, apple, manchego cheese, and a sherry vinaigrette.    Bored yet?  Not I.  Patatas Bravas--crispy fried baby potatoes, something I'm going to replicate the first chance I get.  It was followed by the only course I was not a fan of--grilled spring onions on romesco sauce.  But redemption came moments with grilled hanger steak with browned mushrooms, olorosso sherry butter, and pickled onions.  We had room for dessert, so while one of us had the flan, the rest had churros in chocolate sauce.    By the way, I just love saying flan.  Flan, flan, flan.    Along with drinks, the bill came to around $150, pretty much a bargain in my book.  Ox & Angela is a legitimate score.  The food is fantastic, sublime and astounding.  I immediately wanted to return.  However, I would not order the \"The Spanish Table\" again, as that menu is fixed.  I would spice it up with other options, or better still, challenge the chef (whose name is listed on menu) to create something entirely original.  Given the selection, I bet he would take up the task.  Ox & Angela makes virtually no mistakes and knocks everything else out of the park.    Flan, Flan, Flan...  Food:  5/5 Service:  5/5 Presentation:  5/5 Value:  5/5 Recommendation:  5/5"}
{"text":"We had the sourdough bread which was good but not great. The scallop appetizer was awesome with very fresh ingredients and prepares just right. The paella main was delicious with plenty of crunchy rice to scrape off the pan. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place! easy to make reservation not super busy, feel very relaxing!   I really enjoy having my weekend brunch there! The food is fun and good, although I found it's a bit salty for me.   Very reasonable price and the portion is good. the presentation is nice too. Love to order different dishes and share with friends!"}
{"text":"The mojitos are generous with rum. The mint is crushed well. Your waiter is friendly, but distant. He never tells you his name, and you are glad for the courtesy. You cannot remember the food, but you are told is excellent."}
{"text":"Our party of four made the right decision by choosing the chef's tasting menu.  A parade of excellent dishes followed during the next two hours.  We enjoyed a pitcher of wonderful sangria from a recipe unique to the restaurant.  Our waitperson Barb was charming, funny and most of all - knowledgeable! She answered every question and guided us through the evening.  We followed the same formula for dessert and sampled all four of the selections.  It was difficult to find fault with any aspect of the meal.  Ox and Angela was a first rate experience from start to finish. A great Calgary memory."}
{"text":"This place is alright, but not great. We had a reservation for 8 pm and weren't seated until closer to 9. We among 2 or 3 other groups that were in the same boat. We would've left if the walk in waits weren't so long at other places nearby. Overall the service was good. The staff did recognize our inconvenience by comping us food and drinks, but our experience was negative overall. The food was average; some dishes were way too salty. The sangria was good but definitely not worth the price. Wouldn't recommend. It's too bad - we had high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"Awesome way to spend a night out. Whether you are sitting on the lounge or restaurant side, its obvious this place is happening! The constant use of Manchego cheese, makes every dish that much better. The service is awesome too! I've always appreciated restaurants that had unique food and servers that would explain to you what each dish was. They do offer a tasting menu, which I highly recommend. That way, you're able to be delighted by various items throughout their menu.   Definite highlight? Dessert! Churros served alongside chocolate ganache! What could be better than dipping something so sweet and perfect, into something that is so sweet and perfect! Haha I'm a chocolate lover...its obvious! Anyways, I will definitely be back and I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Been here several times always great service! Went here for breakfast the other day fantastic eggs Benedict tons of flavour ! Would definitely recommend  and who doesn't like Sangria with breakfast   For dinner the scallops are to die for the gianbino sauce is authentic definitely reminds me of my childhood!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if there is an Ox, but I know there is most certainly an Angela, and I would like to sincerely thank her for having one of the most fabulous restaurants I have ever had the pleasure of dining at.   Eating in this food lover paradise, with the most mouth watering tapas I have found outside of Spain, is just simply a stunning experience. From top-notch service, to the comforting decor and ambiance that makes you feel at ease and special at the same time. Then, there is the food.... I adored the white anchovies, drooled over the salt cod and potato croquettas, ordered seconds of the patatas bravas and will definitely be back for the stuffed Persian dates with serrano, manchego & walnuts. What else can I say. Angela, I've never met you, but hot dam! You are my girl!"}
{"text":"Read reviews for Ox & Angela and was excited my fiancé wanted to try it for a late lunch. We sat on the small patio outside facing the street. I had a glass of pinot grigio and my fiancé had a yummy lychee drink, the server put it in a \"manly\" glass for him too lol (it comes with an edible flower lol). We ordered a bunch of tapas:  - Stuffed Dates, manchego, serrano, walnuts, pomegranate molasses $2.5 each...my finace LOVED these, def a must order when you go - Marinated Olives, selection of Turkish olives w citrus and chili $4 - Queso, feature Spanish cheese $9 - Pan Con Tomate, grilled sourdough, crushed tomatoes, garlic, extra virgin olive oil $6 - Lentils, tomato braise, fresh herbs, extra virgin olive oil $9...we both love lentils and this dish was really tasty with a unique spiced taste to it - Zucchini, shaved zucchini, mint, manchego, almond, lemon $8...I ordered this with the \"dressing\" on the side and it was quite dry, prob a skip if you're considering this dish Everything was really tasty and we hope to return for dinner. Lots to choose from and a variety of unique tastes. :)"}
{"text":"This is my third time in Ox and Angela and I haven't been disappointed yet. It was a Friday evening (around 8:30pm) and we didn't make reservations, but still got a table within 20mins.  The service is always courteous, attentive, and friendly, the food great. Nice ambiance and cool decor as well.  I highly recommend the fritters and chorizo seafood paella! delicious!  Overall great job!"}
{"text":"This was a surprise!  YUM!! Half price wines wed night with some awe inspiring tapas! The beet salad was to die for and the flank steak was stupendous.  We also had the deep fried squid, was good but heavily battered, still pretty good.  A great date night spot, with wine I walk out of there under $89!! Yes, calgary, under $89.  Not possible in this town, probably the most expensive food in canada."}
{"text":"This place was good but not amazing. The cocktails were actually the highlight for me.  I ordered the featured tapa which was a sweet chicken which was cooked well and had the right balance of sweetness. I also ordered the Kale and prawns which were a bit underwhelming, the prawns looked like mini shrimps and were flash fried so the tails were edible. The prawns were fried enough so the tail wasn't completely edible which was a bummer. I was expecting the kale to be crunchier but nonetheless had good flavor. Overall a cool place to hangout with friends, grab some bites and drinks,"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great cocktails.. The service was just ok.. In my opinion it was slow... And I had to chase the waitress to ask whatever I wanted to order.. But other that that I really enjoyed the food!!.. The chorizos were great the bread was delicious and the chicken was excellent!!.. I would definitely go back there to try the rest of the menu!!... Also, the cocktails were really good!!.. All we tried was great!!.. If the service were better I would have given 5 stars to this place!!.."}
{"text":"There are restaurants with amazing food that you would hands down revisit. Then there are restaurants with so-so food that you would return to, be it for the atmosphere, service, value paid for, etc. Let's just say, for Ox and Angela it was neither. The food was on the heavy/salty side, but overall it tasted alright. I guess my biggest issue was that at the end of the night, there was nothing that blew me away, and for the prices they were charging, I expected to be blown away. So my suggestion is to go if you have some extra money to blow, otherwise, I'd go looking elsewhere if you want to get your values worth."}
{"text":"My husband went here for the first time and defiantly won't be the last!!! Food and service was amazing!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Stellar brunch, well-flavoured and great portion size! I haven't been for dinner/tapas but I think the people concerned about portion size need to read that there is literally the world tapas in the name, it is sharing plates not full-size meals."}
{"text":"First time here and I would give this a solid 4/5! But today I came for happy hour and for these prices I would say 5/5!  First off,  50% off EVERYTHING!!! The lamb was beautifully tender with a nice glaze and tasty pistachios. The shrimp were perfectly cooked with a lovely spiced marinara sauce. This same marinara sauce also came with the pork belly empanada which had delicious buttery pastry... perfect for sharing but maybe a bit heavy to eat alone. Fried chickpeas were the perfect beer snack with cumin and smoked paprika at the forefront. Eggplant spread was delicious and not overly salty... I felt like this could easily have been over salted, but it was perfectly seasoned, garlicky, with delicious olive oil and lovely toasted baguette. I would happily pay full price for all these items! The fried potato bomba and the Flatbread were also delicious. The serrano ham was okay but I would never pay full price for it.... mind you I am far from a connesiour of cured meats. The bread was soft and dense with a nice crusty outside.   Very much a tapas restaurant where items should be shared so you can get a taste of the plethora of delicious sounding items! I fully recommend their happy hour to explore their menu which I think you will find is pretty damn good! Also tasty wine selection and decent sangria... and again at half price, how can you complain! Five of us ate and had 10 alcoholic drinks but our bill wasn't even $110 before tip! Fabulous deal! I would still enjoy it at full price but the happy hour kicks up the value immensely!"}
{"text":"Pretty chill spot, big space but on the kitchen side feels very cozy.  Furniture was odd, chairs were similar to ones I sat in through grade school.  Food selection is nice, lots of tapas selections and the tasting for two is offered at a good price.  Ended up getting a bunch of plates with work colleagues: fried artichokes (great), fried cheese (also very good), duck (good portion, perfectly cooked) and the dates are a can't miss.  For desert we shared the flan which was very tasty, and the churros with chocolate were delicious but the size was disappointing (good portion, just that each churro was too small).  I would come again, but not before I went back to their sister restaurant Native Tongue- much better food at similar prices.  I would come back, tough to compare to the real deal tapas I had the fortune of having in San Sebastian, Spain just a month prior.  This is probably the closest you will come to that food in Calgary."}
{"text":"I love you Ox and Angela. Usually when someone suggests tapas, I kind of get all huffy and think about having to spilt up the food, and how I will probably still be starving afterwards.  But not here! The plates are delicious and make sense when dividing up servings. I am always impressed after a meal here.  Today we ventured forth to try O & A's brunch offerings, which I had heard so much about. We were not disappointed!  First off, thank you taking reservations, thank you, thank you, thank you! We couldn't decide what to drink with our meal, so we went for all the beverages, with the complimentary Q sparkling water, a large french press of caffe Rosso coffee and a pitcher of blood orange mimosas (though I think we actually got regular mimosas, but  they were still delicious).  I think the best part of the brunch at O & A is the Brunch Table offering, for $21 per person, you get 6 plates. Perfect amount of food, unless you are a complete pig like we were and after we had polished off those plates ordered the Panguegas (olive oil pancakes) which I am so glad we did, cause they were fantastic.  Our server was great, props to Cody.  I wish we could do brunch here every weekend, but then I don't think we will be able to afford our wedding. Such a treat!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Ox & Angela for their brunch.    We loved its homey style and cute decor.    We had the Brunch table - which is a little bit of everything.   We LOVED it!   The omelette, the dates, and the patates bravas were delicious!    The service was great, and we really enjoyed our time there and will definitely go back."}
