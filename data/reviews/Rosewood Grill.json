{"text":"I have to say that it is fabulous to see a non-chain restaurant in Strongsville that is so packed all the time. Rosewood Grill picked a perfect location to bring its concept.

The interior is spacious, sleek and very open, but the decor makes it warm and intimate. On our visits it's been too chilly for the patio, but I cannot wait to dine there at some point. It is huge and has a great vibe with a cozy firepit.

The menu is seasonally inspired with fresh, creative offerings. I was thrilled to find a cashew-crusted tofu on the menu. It came with a sweet potato hash that is out of this world, and snow peas and chili sauce. All of the flavors worked so well together. He had the cedar-planked salmon with grilled asparagus, and said it was perfectly cooked and delectable. They have a very nice wine list, and glass pours at every price range.

Definitely a welcome addition to this side of town."}
{"text":"It was ok. Not overwhelming or underwhelming. The atmosphere is ok for the upscale restaurant that it is supposed to be, but not mind bending design or unique. Very \"been there and done that\" for restaurants that want to be upscale and casual. Very cliche of a design. That goes for the food also."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots. We love to take people there and have never been disappointed. Very intimate dining room. Staff is always great. Even when busy you never feel like they are forgetting about you. Food is great and they have interesting specials. Not too pricey for a nice evening out. Large bar and really cool patio with fireplace."}
{"text":"Great food! I had the pan seared salmon on mixed greens with honey lemon Chardonnay. A tasty salad, but their lobster bisque was so good and I wish I could have had a much much bigger bowl! For desert the Tahitian vanilla creme brulee was the desert to top off that wonderful meal and it was surprisingly good since I don't like deserts with an egg taste (a friend let me taste hers and I wish I ordered it). I ordered the chocolate moose with crushed Oreos and I felt like a kid again. Yum.  :)

Everyone ate the same thing (again, I was the only one who ordered the chocolate moose) and we all loved it. The server was on point, friendly, and very knowledgeable about the menu, plus the service was fast. I also want to add to this review TWO SNAPS AND A CIRCLE along with the 5 stars for Rosewood Grill in Hudson Ohio. We were there Saturday November the 11th at 6 pm 2016."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance including bar and restaurant areas.  The food was delicious as well.  I had the ivory salmon special and it was excellent.   Although it was too cool to sit on the patio, it was a nice space with tables and a relaxing area surrounding a gas fire pit for drinks after dinner.  Enjoyable restaurant."}
{"text":"I took 45 people last night for a holiday party. 45 people had an experience no short of amazing. Everyone from the GM to the person pouring water did everything they could to please us to the fullest. I had no complaints about the food, the servers ran their tail off and a wonderful night was had by all!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful Saturday lunch sitting at the bar with Shawn who provided exceptional service, drinks and conversation.  First visit and was highly impressed at the wait staff.  Only complaint is the need to remove a few chairs at the bar.  If that is the most negative thing to say, something right is happening.  Bartender deserves major props."}
{"text":"I cannot eat Gluten due to a allergy, often when we go out to eat I feel slighted. This was a truly wonderful experience. I had the ribs with cherry sauce, usually not an option, redskin potatoes with smoked gouda and coleslaw with blue cheese and dried cherries. The service was great and they made sure I would not get sick on anything I ate. The atmosphere is a relaxing mix of contemporary and the original building building which looks to be from the the late 19th century. Also, the Sidesaddle Martini and Creme' Brulee was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food! The cornbread was flavorless and the salad was all lettuce! I would not rush back !"}
{"text":"Poor lunch experience today. Beef stroganoff was the special. It came dry to our large party. We asked for additional gravy and were told it would be 15-20 minutes. When we questioned why it was dry and appeared to have no sour cream we were told they were out of sour cream. What? Buy more or take the \"special\" off the menu! Ridiculous.
The server was great and apologetic but the manager should have offered us new menu items."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible
Waitress couldn't remember anything 
My pork chop was rare the pudding was cold the regional HR manager  took it away and forgot to comp it
They forgot to serve our wine they lost my wife's take home
Our two checks for four people were wrong
No wonder the place was empty on a Saturday night"}
{"text":"Great evening with friends started with a round of cocktails before being seated.  Bar staff was attentive and a pleasure to interact with.  Ordered the filet and was cooked to my liking and the demi glace is a very nice touch and tasty too.  Everyone raved about the quality of their food and Dan was professional and attentive to our needs.  Our friends stated that they would definitely be back, for we have visited multiple times, always to our liking."}
{"text":"A great place to go to high end special occasion dining. The steaks were cooked perfectly and substitutions for some of our diners were handled well. The lobster bisque is very good and alcohol prices for wines by the bottle are reasonable. The staff was accommodating and competently handled the range of ages in our party. I've dined here several times and while not inexpensive, they never disappoint for fine food with celebrations."}
{"text":"Unpretentious place with cloth napkins and excellent food.  We left our kid at home, but a few kids were there, though I'm not sure if there is a separate menu or not.  Not sure I'd bring a toddler, but a well-behaved elementary school student would do fine.

The lobster bisque is a huge bowl and since it's so rich, it really fills you up - beware if you also eat the excellent salt-crusted bread and order a large dinner!  I had the steak and shrooms salad with a side of lobster mac and cheese.  Salad was fine - it was a salad, steak was cooked medium as ordered.  The lobster mac and cheese was fantastic - I'll go back just for that, but I'll work out a few hours first; it'll never be mistaken for Lean Cuisine.  Took half of it home for lunch the next day since I was full of bisque already.  Beer selections are good, and the wait staff were extremely helpful and attentive.  Manager came by to say hello, always a nice touch.

I'm taking one star off due to odd seating - we were seated at a high table into the pretty full bar (that got more full by the minute), so we had to deal with off-duty salespeople chatting each other up and guffawing while they waited for the rest of their clan to get there and be seated in the private dining area.  I almost poked one with a fork when his posterior got about 6\" away from my lobster mac and cheese .  I was only mildly annoyed by this until I went to use the restroom and walked through the nearly empty dining room.  Maybe the tables were for being saved for their legendary \"call ahead,\" non-reservation system or the dining room is only for groups larger than 2, but next time we'll ask for a seat outside of the bar during happy hour time."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly and accommodating staff We had a party of seven and all enjoyed their meals ranging from center cut filets to salmon salad to flatbread pizza Looking forward to going back as there are so many items on the menu that I want to try"}
{"text":"My experience was far.  I would never recommend this for a business dinner.  The dinner area is very loud,  so loud we were yelling to hear each other.  The food a far for the price.  But nothing special."}
{"text":"Surprised at the reviews with the low marks. Been to the Strongsville location numerous times and was excited to try the new Westlake location. They did not disappoint. Visited on black Friday for an early dinner. Was very pleased with the service and our server in particular. He was on top of all of our orders and requests. Very polite and hardworking. Food was excellent and fresh. I had the veggie burger and it was the best in a restaurant I have ever had. Others in our group has lobster pasta, crusted tofu and the french dip. Everyone loved them and had zero complaints. Will be visiting again next time in Westlake. Enjoyable experience all around."}
{"text":"My wife and were very disappointed, since this was our first and probably only time we'll go there.  It was my birthday treat and we felt we would try someplace \"more special\", then our usual stops.
I made the mistake to not ask the cost of the catch of the day, since it was marked, MKT.  Thirty-six dollars for a piece of 2x2x2\" piece of Maui-Maui was rediculous.  The risotto, spinach and fish lacked any flavor.  The house salad dressing, that was $4 extra, was the most flavorful part of the meal.
My wife had the sirloin and potatoes meal and found it to be nothing special.  Both meals must have been sitting for a while, since they were just barely warm when they arrived.
When my wife called for the reservation, she was asked if it was a special occasion. She told them it was my birthday.  While I would not want to be sung to or anything else really, a happy birthday wish would have been nice, since they made a point to ask.
Ninety dollars for two including tip, with only one of us having a glass of wine was overpriced and disappointing."}
{"text":"Took our family of 4 out to dinner, and we really wanted to like this place, as it is so close to home and looked really nice; but our food was not seasoned at all, everything was bland. He had steak and I had salmon. Both were bland, even his mashed potatoes had no flavor. We won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I had dinner here on a weeknight and I was very impressed with the service, ambience, and food. I ordered the Mediterranean flatbread and it was very fresh and delicious. Service was comparable to that of a high end restaurant. Everyone in my group enjoyed what they ordered. They have a great selection of beer and wine on their menu. The fire pit outside looked incredible. Lots of parking available in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The Rosewood Grill is one of our favorites in Hudson.  It has an eclectic menu, with so many great choices it's very hard to decide.  The atmosphere is extremely pleasant with dim lighting but not so dim you can't see the menu, flowers on the tables, and a very friendly staff.  Try the burger, pasta dishes, almost anything they have available and it's sure to be good.  My husband had a problem with his entree during one visit, and asked to have it returned to the kitchen (too rare and pretty tough steak).  They not only took it back, they promptly fixed the problem and the chef came out to apologize in person, then offered us each a free dessert.  That's the kind of service we wish all restaurants would provide, and the kind that keeps people coming back as well.  It's family friendly as well."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to have a meal and a drink.  Julia(I think) was our server.  She was super attentive.  I had the spicy burger and my fiancé had the fillet.  Both meals were fantastic.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice meal out."}
{"text":"Excited about trying this restaurant so had the opportunity on Saturday. Loved the patio and fireplace. Lucky for us we had stopped by earlier in the day and requested table so we didn't have to endure the 2 hours wait.  We were sat very close to our reservation time. Unfortunately it went downhill from there.  Dining room so loud you could not talk to the person next to you.  The server was very inattentive. The kitchen was very slow - and the food was lukewarm when we did receive it. The last negative piece was when 3 people began clearing the table while we were still sitting at the table,  I will think twice about returning any time soon.  It is a beautiful place but service and food were less than enjoyable."}
{"text":"Finally!  A great place in Strongsville.  No more driving up 71 to Tremont or downtown for a great dinner.  About time people had another option for dinner and drinks than the big chains..."}
{"text":"Restaurant with very nice environment.  Waiters are very kind.   Food tasted great!!!  But I'll recommend the restaurant switch the plates."}
{"text":"I have always liked it here. Great atmosphere and service. I just noticed the cashew-crusted tofu on the menu (I haven't been in a while). I used to get a side salad and the sweet potato hash. The server confirmed that this meal is #vegan. It is served with a potato hash and I added a side salad. It was delicious!!! I would go back and get it again. My server was very accommodating and made sure to leave the cheese off my salad before I asked. I love a restaurant with informed and friendly staff. The patio and firepit are great too! :)"}
{"text":"This is not a review of the food at Rosewood. Reason being that we left without sitting at a table or eating a thing. Having read other reviews about the call ahead service and the total disregard of that system, we arrived on Saturday at 6:15 pm. There were many empty tables in both the dining area and the bar. Two young women were at the reservation stand. Lookinh very bored and aloof. One asked if we had a res. I mentioned that Rosewood didn't take res so no, we did not have a res. She then told us (very brusquely) that the next available table would be at 7:45. Period. Not in a nice or welcoming tone or offering any options, No mention of sitting at the bar, etc. 

Now we are four very nice people and one of us asked about the possibility of an open table before then. Nope, the other woman said. 7:45 pm. Then she offered us a business card in case we wanted to call ahead. Feeling as if we were in the Chinese restaurant episode of Seinfeld, we asked one more time. BOth women in unison declared, You should have called ahead. 7:45 is it. And then felt compelled to remind us that it was Saturday night. 

We turned and left. And won't be back. There are many other great places to eat in the area and we enjoyed a stellar dining experience at One Red Door.

Attitude and customer service and first impressions count a lot. And this experience showed that Rosewood is a zero in those areas."}
{"text":"My husband and I met each other at Rosewood Grill!  The ambience, delicious food, great wine selection and outdoor fireplace certainly added to the romance of the evening!  We go back and sit at the bar or take other couples for fine dining often.  My husband entertains clients at the Rosewood. We love excellent food and you will too!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the Cleveland area. Classy place with good food and service. The hostess's are friendly and the Mangers are frequently walking the floor engaging people. I will continue to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday.  Had never tried it even though we go to many restaurants in Hudson. Sat out on the patio which was very nice as was the interior of the restaurant.
Ordered the devil egg appetizer(whole grain mustard, sriracha, smoked bacon).  Not very good.  Smoked bacon looked and tasted very odd.  Whites of the egg had a very strange texture, almost felt like they had been frozen and quickly thawed.  They were harder than fresh eggs should be.  Ordered the 1/2 Rosewood Salad and it came with one crouton, lots of greens, 2 little radish slices and the dressing(which was delicious).  My wife and I both ordered the Chicken Anna(egg battered & pan seared coleman farms chicken, lemon-caper linguine). It was beyond dry and the bottom was very hard to cut through and eat.  Asked the server for some sauce and it came out like a Hollandaise(not a fan of this type of sauce).  Chicken was almost inedible.  My son ordered the Smoky Spicy burger(caramelized onions, jalapeños, gruyere, chipotle aioli & slaw, shoestring fries). Ate it all. Said it was decent, nothing too special.
Have to say that the service was great, but the server never asked if we wanted coffee or dessert.  It was almost as if once we complained about the chicken he just wanted us to leave.  
The manager did comp us for both chicken dishes which we had not asked for.  We just wanted to let them know so they can adjust their cook time for future orders but after reading some additional reviews on here about the chicken, it seems to be an issue for them.
Unfortunately, we will not return here for future meals.  Very disappointed overall."}
{"text":"After years of driving by, I decided to checkout Rosewood grill in Strongsville with my kids. Going in, I was a bit concerned because my youngest (10) typically doesn't order off the full menu, but I figured what the heck.
 
It was busy but not unduly so on a Saturday night at 6pm. I had made reservations, so was a bit surprised that I was seated in the bar area when there were available tables in the main dining area, but not a huge deal for me.
 
The menu is fairly standard for a mid-price restaurant, chicken, steak and seafood.  It turns out they did have a kids menu, so I was pretty happy about that.   The interior is nice, very much a 'steak-house' vibe, but it's modernish and goes well.  
 
Our server was attentive and cordial throughout.  I had their version of a moscow mule, which uses coconut in place of ginger. It was okay, not really my taste, but that's on me for trying it. 
 
I had the lobster bisque and their french dip.  The boy got cheeseburger sliders off the kids menu and my daughter had their sirloin.  You also get bread. The bread was warm and crusty, and we went through 1.5 loaves.  My soap was good with plenty of lobster meat, though a bit pricey for the amount of soap you get.  
 
The meals were all good.  I was wondering if the french dip would be enough for dinner, but I was full by the end. The cheese was a bit non-existent but the au jus made up for it.  My kids reported their meals were also very good. The sirloin looked good and was cooked to specification (medium-well. I don't want to talk about it. Damn kids and their rebellious ways)  The cheeseburger sliders were thick and maybe the best looking cheeseburger sliders I have seen.  Unfortunately I got to taste neither so it's hard to report back on how they tasted.
 
The kids meals are a bargain, as the cheeseburger sliders with fries was $6.  The sirloin and french dip were in line with what I would expect, but I do think their sides and soup ($7 for asparagus,$9 for cup of bisque) are bit on the high side compared to the entree price.
 
Overall it was a good experience.  I'd go again, though maybe pass on the soup and extra side."}
{"text":"Service was so so. Ordered the tenderloin salad. Totally overdressed, couldn't eat. Steak was not cooked correctly. Wouldn't go again"}
{"text":"Reviewing after my first visit there, but I loved it! It's very sleek inside without being stuffy. The service was very good. Our server was funny, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and wine selection. The good was very good. Nice broad selection on the menu and nice presentation of the meals. 

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend  took me to rose wood grill last night for my birthday. The employees were very friendly and gracious. I ordered the ribeye ($36), and was thoroughly disappointed.  It was not very tender or flavorful. Caesar salad was fair at best. We both had the lobster bisque which was actually pretty good. She ordered the filet, which was ok but the cabernet demi glace sauce was over-reduced to an extremely thick consistency and almost flavorless. For the price we were expecting much more. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food was very sub-par. That is actually an understatement. 

We ordered the lobster rangoons, and lobster bisque to start. The rangoons were tasty, however, for $10 I would expect slightly more lobster than none. I did not taste any lobster whatsoever. We ran into a similar situation with the lobster bisque, although tasty, there was hardly enough lobster to consider the dish \"lobster bisque.\"

The entrees were really bad... to put it politely. I had the salmon with green beans and butternut squash risotto. The salmon was dry and flavorless. The green beans were clearly not done as they were very hard. The risotto was more like dry rice and butternut squash. I would have liked it to be a bit creamier.

My boyfriend ordered a chicken pasta dish....that was served sans the sauce. Nothing like both dry pasta AND dry chicken.

We will not be returning. I gave this 2 stars simply because the atmosphere was its saving grace."}
{"text":"First visit. Lunch service lacking. We had to ask for bread to be served with meal. Ordered pasta but no grated cheese offered. Server placed napkin in food as she served, then reassured me it was clean!  Food was good. Probably will not return for lunch rather will go to Cabin Club"}
{"text":"Great place!  The devilled eggs appetizer is awesome and perfect for three. My wife and daughter had the french dip which was killer as advertised. I had the planked salmon cooked to medium perfection. It was served with the garlic mashers.  All washed down with cider on tap (my wife) and the rosewood red beer on tap (Me).  Very attentive service throughout including a visit from the owner."}
{"text":"We gave this new restaurant a try.  It is decorated nicely.  And there was a decent crowd at 9 pm on a Friday night, so we were hopeful.  We chose to sit at the bar.  There were just a handful of other patrons at the bar.  There were two bar tenders for perhaps ten folks seated at the bar, albeit the restaurant was somewhat busy (not packed) so there was a steady stream of drink orders.  The bar tenders promptly took our drink orders, but we're very slow to wait on us.  Other patrons also seemed to be impatient for service.  After waiting perhaps ten minutes we found ourselves having to lean across the bar and wave for attention.  We were not the only ones. This recurred when we ordered, needed water, and requested our check.  I understand when the staff are busy, but the two bar tenders studiously avoided eye contact, kept their backs turned to the patrons, and were not engaging.  At moments they had down time.  They just seemed disinterested or are unaware of the basic principles of hospitality.  I found myself wondering about the service culture of the place and whether staff understood the expectations or had received adequate training.  The food ... a flatbread pizza ... was just okay (somewhat undercooked).  The front entry was littered despite the fact there were plenty of staff available to keep things tidy.  Hopefully these are just growing pains.  The concept of the place has promise.  We will give them another try at some point."}
{"text":"Have you ever gotten beaten up and then paid for it? That sums up my experience at Rosewood at Crocker Park.  Overall the best thing about the meal was the ciabatta bread which was conveniently free.  I started off with the Buffalo Chicken Spring Rolls which were awful.  They were basically super greasy spring rolls filled with buffalo chicken dip you would buy at a gas station.  For my entrée I got the Cowboy Ribeye 16oz special, which was $36.  I ordered the steak medium and it came out almost entirely raw.  After sending it back to put back on the grill it took over 15 minutes for them to bring it back out.  The waiter kept looking at our table to check to see if the steak had been brought back out and kept assuring me the manager would be bringing it.  Once the steak finally arrived it was cooked medium well.  At this point I didn't want to wait any longer to eat so I dealt with it.  The manager didn't even apologize and simply said \"Here's your steak.\"  Unfortunately the wait was not worth it.  I'm fairly certain they didn't even season the steak with salt and pepper, let alone anything else.  For $36 dollars this was by far the most disappointing bland steak I've ever eaten.  It also only came with 3 fingerling potatoes cut in half.  So essentially, their steak special was just a steak.  The manager came around once again to see how the food was, but spent about 2 seconds hearing my response before saying \"great\" and running away despite the fact I said it was okay in a negative demeanor.  Once I got the check the server did tell me the manager took a drink off of my bill for the wait, but surprisingly the manager never apologized about the steak to me or mentioned the drink herself."}
{"text":"The service was excellent! The patio with firepit is lovely. I had the lobster bisque and pear salad; both were delicious."}
{"text":"The greatest thing about this place is its atmosphere.A little overpriced but service was good.Would consider going there again,not our first choice though.
 P.S. They have cute little salt and pepper shakers."}
{"text":"My whole family loves Rosewood!!! You can't really even compare it to the old Turner's Inn.  The food here is so good, great fish, salads, flatbreads, french fries (mmmmm......french fries), and the desserts are awesome too! The staff there is so nice, as well.  We have also had a baby shower there and a couple of other larger dinner events, and all were incredible and went very smooth.  Also, their community seating is great since they do not take reservations.  Granted, we've sat right next to total strangers many times, but it is kind of a nice way to interact with new people! Plus, if you're from Hudson you are bound to run in to some one you know here. Yay, go you rosewood!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the atmosphere was great.. I had the special for the day which was bass with risotto and it was absolutely yummy. 
It is located in an old brick building which gives it a very cozy feeling.
The server was very friendly as well.
Would surely visit again when in the area."}
{"text":"The food here has greatly improved and while I have enjoyed my meals lately It's such a shame that the too loud dated bad music and too bright glaring lighting over the dining tables make this seemingly cool vibe decor feel more like the ghost of applebees is hanging around to scare the ambiance right out the door. PLEASE tone down the music and lighting, your chef deserves a chance!"}
{"text":"I lived in Hudson for a short while, and this was always our 'go-to' place. Good Quality, Decent prices, Cozy atmosphere(warm comfortable, but original with some transitional/modern design). We normally sat in the bar section, to avoid the excessive wait times that can happen. Always had good meals, the service is normally on par.

I am happy that this is one more place to go in the 'ville, that is not a chain!

TIP: Either go early, or go late, unless you want to wait!"}
{"text":"I had a lunch meeting this week at Rosewood and I had a great experience. The food is always top notch and they are very accommodating as far as customization (I asked for the salmon / veggies to be cooked without butter and it was no problem .. Not even an \"I'll check with the chef.\") Also, our waiter, Derek, was SO good. He was insanely attentive and on top of things .. When I go back I will request his section!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town visiting family. We had dinner both Friday 6/3 and Saturday 6/4 night at the Rosewood. We reserved their private room for Saturday night. So between both nights we would try just about every entrée, and several of the appetizers. Being from Atlanta, and now Charleston,SC for the past year - my wife and I are real foodies. We both are excellent cooks. 
The steaks were outstanding, and I was pleasantly surprised with the barbecue ribs. I'm quite a critic of BBQ living in Atlanta for the past 20 years. They really hit the mark on the ribs. As far as service goes, our server Alex did such a great job on Friday night, I asked for him for our Saturday night private room dinner. It was also nice to see management stopping by and asking if our meals were outstanding.
If your looking for a great dinner, and outstanding food...I would highly recommend giving the Rosewood a try. You will keep going back."}
{"text":"Late night for apps and drinks. Great cocktail list. Sushi shots if you like wasabi and sirachi. Try this place. Great waitstaff."}
{"text":"I was blown away by how amazing this place was. I'm not big on fancy places, but Rosewood felt cozy and at home, with the service and quality of a 5 star restaurant. We were seated immediately, which was shocking for a Friday night. Service was prompt, friendly, and able to speak to different dishes on the menu. I had their special of the night, a 14oz NY strip with a loaded baked potato. They combined flavors for the seasonings that I would have hated on their own, but together it worked better than I thought possible. The steak was cooked to perfection. My date had the bacon cheddar burger, also cooked to perfection. Their fries are fantastic, and the bread they serve is so good we will be hitting up little italy to buy some of our own! Overall, I was thrilled with everything, it was more than worth the money, and we will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at the Rosewood Grill when it opened and found the service and food to be very good. 

We enjoyed setting in the open air section of the restaurant and the outside fireplace was great. 

The menu offered lots of options and our server was attentive and made sure our drinks and food came as ordered."}
{"text":"The only reason why I made a Yelp account was to discuss my horrific experience at this restaurant.   I went to Rosewood Grill for my birthday today with my family, I ordered the \"Killer\" French Dip Sandwich... Yeah it was killer alright, the steak on the sandwich was incredibly rubbery and flavorless with a lot of fat, and the Au Jus was saltier than soy sauce.  NEVER have I had this bad of a steak sandwich. Then, my aunt mentioned to the waitress that it was my birthday. The waitress brought out some sort of brownie.  It was completely raw, which is pathetic, I know 8 year old kids that can make a better brownie.  Also, I noticed how quick the waiters and waitresses were to taking our unfinished entrees, but when I was done with the unfinished brownie mush, they never asked how it was or if I was finished.  I will make sure all of my friends and family NEVER go to this restaurant, unless they are OK with being served raw and inedible food.

UPDATE: I posted this exact review on the Rosewood Grill's Facebook page, along with a picture of the raw brownie.  I checked back today to see if they apologized for nearly poisoning me on my birthday, they deleted the post!! They didn't apologize or anything!  THIS IS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER SEEN FROM A RESTAURANT! Avoid this restaurant at all costs!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for dinner, it was clear that our waitress was not happy to be working, as she complained about having to work all weekend. As a result our service was less than ideal. Food was good but not worth the price premium we paid. Overall meh."}
{"text":"Very expensive for the quality and portion size. Have spent much less for much better. Service was the highlight of my experience."}
{"text":"Unplanned visit to Rosewood this evening.   I  called an hour before I was going to be there and made a reservation.   We arrived on time and was seated promptly.   The dining area was comfortable and inviting.   The lighting was not to dark, and the background  music wasn't to loud.  Our waitress was prompt,  kind, and knowledgeable of the menu.   We ordered a few drinks and  calamari.  It was absolutely delicious.   Tender, light, not chewy.   The lobster bisque was outstanding.   We both ordered Red Snapper, the fresh fish special.   It came with parmesan risotto, sautéed spinach and tomatoes .  The fresh fish special was $32.  The risotto was cold.  Neither of us ate it.  We did box it up, and decided to take home and reheat tomorrow.   It had a nice flavor.   Nice and creamy,  just cold.   Our waitress brought  us a wonderful  warm chocolate hazelnut  brownie with vanilla ice cream on the house to make up for the cold risotto.   The over all experience was pleasurable.  We will go back.  The bill did come to $108, but we totally could dine for less and still be satisfied."}
{"text":"Ambience is excellent. Not great food choice. Just enjoy your drinks and get out.
French fries are Ok. But make sure they are freshly made. Service is good."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, however the service is on par with McDonald's. $60 meal for my wife and I, yet no refills were offered. Restaurant was only 1/3 full. In fact, our server rushed our order, dropped food off, and then disappeared for 30 minutes. She finally reappeared to ask about desert, we were interested 15 minutes earlier, when we finished our meal. Sitting around another 10+ minutes for the bill, followed by another 10 minutes waiting for her to come collect my CC. I finally got annoyed enough to go seek the manager. I wish this were the first time we had been disappointed by the service. Maybe we will try and get it to go and eat in the car... The service will be about the same."}
{"text":"I would say 3.5 the lobster bisque is \"award winning \" but for $9 you get next to no lobster meat in a cup . The burger was excellent along with my wife's Tuscan Italian flat bread. The lobster Mac an cheese and schenzuan green beans were phenomenal. For dessert we shared cookie bake with Mitchell's Carmel ice was also excellent"}
{"text":"Nice place,nice decor. Food is good love their ribs. For me service is slow that is why the 4-stars."}
{"text":"Great friendly service, nice atmosphere. I wish I lived next to this place so I could eat here every day. For dinner I started with the sushi shots with Sriracha sauce, a.k.a. Awesome sauce! Had the Rosewood salad and the Idaho Rainbow Trout. All were excellently prepared and very tasty. The perfect meal to round out a business trip."}
{"text":"Took my mother-in-law there because it is her favorite place. Or I should say was her favorite place. After waiting 50 minutes our food finally came. Her french dip roll was hard as a rock and she couldn't even cut it with a knife. I ordered a regular hamburger and could not eat it. It had charcoal all over it like it had been dropped in the coals and the beef had no flavor at all.
When we were asked how our meals were, I said not good. The person said \"you're kidding right?\" I told him no but he didn't even ask why. My mother-in-law told him about her sandwich but he did nothing. Needless to say we won't be going back. Oh and it was freezing in there and extremely noisy. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"(Hudson location) The French Dip is usually very good, however they have messed up my Carryout Order on numerous occasions.  Today, when I ordered, I specifically asked if the horseradish would be on the sandwich and they forgot to include it again!  This may seem like a small thing, however, it significantly alters the taste and makes it very bland.  When I'm paying $17. for a sandwich, I expect to be done right!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Rosewood the other night and we had a very pleasant experience sitting outside. Our service was attentive and professional, and our food was tasty. We've eaten indoors at Rosewood several times, but this was our first outdoor experience. On a cool late summer night, the communal fire pit is a nice compliment to an otherwise warm and friendly dining experience."}
{"text":"Average taste food, don't like their sushi shoot. Only 4 pieces and salty.  Food is salty, especially their mash potato."}
{"text":"had the burger and fries, which was good nothing special though. My brother got a crab pasta dish that was really good. Good atmosphere and even better beer list, love any place that has Victory Hop Devil on tap"}
{"text":"Best happy hour in Hudson. The bartenders Nick and Janya and the server Sharon always make sure you have a great time and feel welcome."}
{"text":"Best restaurants ever the steak is one of the best I've ever had you people need to calm down the food and the service is the best"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, decent service, but the food is mediocre at best. No better than a chain.  Tried to pass salmon off as Arctic char!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Rosewood Grill several times since it has opened. Inititally, I had my trepidations, as it was in the former Inn at Turners Mill location (which I loved). 

However, after dining there I am pleasantly surprised. The drinks are fun and inventive - I highly recommend sampling from the classic/historic drink menu and trying some of their concoctions - especially the Rosewood Cosmo, complete with sugared rose petal.

I enjoy the atmosphere and the music! While played softly, if one listens closely you can hear the sounds of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones in the upscale environment. It fits the client base, which seems to be mostly baby boomers from the suburbs. 

The food is good, but not amazing. I have had scallops, risotto and steak. The service can be iffy at times."}
{"text":"Great food!  A little pricey, so we just go for special occasions, but never disappointed."}
{"text":"I visited Saturday evening expecting to treat myself to something special.  I won't be back.  The price was about two times what it should have been.  I ordered surf and turf - shrimp and sirloin- both way over cooked and lacking flavor.  The medium order for the steak was charred and well done.  $12 for a glass of wine that probably cost more than the entire bottle...disappointment to say the least."}
{"text":"Family and I have wanted to try this place since it opened since it's a cousin of Salmon Dave's which is one of our favorites.  They don't take reservations, so typically they'd a long wait...and I wait for no table.  We were in the area last night and stopped in with no wait at all.  There's a reason for that.

We were sat near one of the server stations where we listened to one after the next whining to the other about how much they hate management and how poorly they are treated.  Our server took about 10 minutes to wander over and basically had the service style of a chain restaurant.  Food was thoroughly unimpressive- sushi cups were 80% quacamole, my fish was basically cooked on one side.  The fact that I only ate a few bites seemed to be lost on our server who haphazardly took it away at the end of the meal without asking why I didn't touch it.  I didn't send it back because I really had no desire to eat anything from there at this point.  

Hospitality Restaurants- I'd either fix this one or close it."}
{"text":"I've visited Rosewood many times and the food is consistent. It's not over-the-top great but it's good. Decent beer menu.

Nice ambiance: the dining room is intimate with stone walls and feels a bit Downtown 140ish, while the bar is more lively, and the outside patio is open with fireplace.

One downside is the menu never changes. That's what I enjoy about One Red Door, Downtown 140 and others.

Overall, it's a safe choice, easy parking and off the main Hudson drag which typically provides walk-in service."}
{"text":"I completely agree with Samantha R. about there being absolutely no flavor to the food. Surprisingly, I'd visited the Strongsville location for lunch and had a fantastic salad, so we tried this location for dinner. 

The interior of the place is nice, upscale with trendy lighting and some cute seating, but our table was uncomfortable and bulky. We only were a party of 6, but they placed us at this enormous round table that probably would have comfortably housed 10. Made for awkward, shouted conversations. The waitress was also having difficulty navigating to each of us, as the table was too close to support pillars, which she kept having to navigate. 

Entrees were so terribly bland--I've had more flavor at Panera. I tried a summer salmon special which had a sickly sweet glaze with soggy rice underneath. Momola tried the sirloin, Pops tried the walleye, and my husband got ribs--all of which were salty, bland, and disappointing. When you're bored of your meal on the second bite, you know have a problem. I dunno; I can't justify paying $20-35 on entrees that are mediocre.

Also, I tried two of their cosmopolitan. HOLY MACKEREL. TOO SWEET. You know when Hobbes tries Calvin's bowl of Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs? Exactly. I probably just need to stick to regular martinis.

The bathroom is super classy, I guess. And I will say that their salads are fresh and delicious, so Rosewood Grill gets a consolation star for that. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Anne W.  First time at Rosewood Grill..  Seated promptly and pleasantly by the help.  Each of the five of us ordered different dishes, each of us was very pleased with our selections .  I've had better vodka gimlets and nicer waiters."}
{"text":"Back again, this time for dinner. Another pleasant experience. Deviled 
egg appetizer yum. Both ordered filet mignon grilled perfectly. 
Finished off with a chocoholic desert. Great food exceptional value.
We're hooked."}
{"text":"After a quick yelp search, my husband and I decided to try the Rosewood Grill for dinner. We made a reservation 30 minutes out and headed to the restaurant. Aside from a lengthy wait (maybe 30 minutes) everything was great! The server was very attentive and thoroughly walked us through our dinner options. The food was delicious! I recommend this place without reservation."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious.  The service we had was slow, though still good aside from that.  My biggest complaint is something that seems to happen every time I order scallops at a classy restaurant...they give you a total of three scallops as an entree.  I get that they're probably hand plucked instead of dredged up, but come on.  Even though my specific meal was not filling, it was pretty tasty.  The cauliflower purée is pretty much perfect and I would highly recommend their cheesecake for dessert.  Great atmosphere, too."}
{"text":"Despite my sisters bad experience here I finally tried this place... I really enjoyed it, minus it being a bit pricey. We ordered the lobster bisque and it was delightful! Creamy and addictive, I could've eaten a while pot if it. We then ordered fish tacos and the Tuscan pizza. Fish tacos were pretty good, but nothing spectacular to be honest. We both enjoyed the pizza very much and it paired well with the wine we cabernet I had. 

Our waiter was fantastic! He was very inviting and knowledgeable of the menu and the wine list, which being in the restaurant business I appreciate this greatly! He was very attentive and we were very impressed with his service. 

I really enjoyed my meal, service, and ambiance at Rosewood and will very likely return in the future, especially on Fridays for the lobster bisque!"}
{"text":"we made a reservation for saturday night at 830. we got there around 815 and was not seated until 9 because our table wasn't ready. We were pretty hungry so we were slightly annoyed. after seating, we ordered our apps and meals and the food as amazing. We had a party of 7 and everyone enjoyed their meals. Our server was attentive and the manager actually came by to apologize for our wait. it was very genuine and we appreciated the gesture. We intended to order dessert but the manager sent over a couple desserts to make up for our wait.  so glad we chose to try rosewood grill and will definitely be back. Great service. Great food. Great addition to strongsville."}
{"text":"Amazing food, and amazing staff! 
My boyfriend and I came here on a sunday, and there was a 15-20 min wait. Not bad at all. Our server was very friendly, and made sure to check up on us often. I got the chargrilled lamb burger, and it was one of the best burgers I've had in a very long time! Overall, everything about this place is awesome :) 
We will definitely be returning soon! 
(Only complaint that I had was, it was a bit cold inside.)"}
{"text":"It's the first time we had dinner here. The food is ok but we waited for about 40 minutes for the food. I think service should be improved for better customs' experience."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Rosewood Grill. The restaurant is situated near Crocker Park but across the street which makes the parking situation ideal. The restaurant itself is very clean with nice decor. We ate lunch with our son and the food was very well prepared and delicious. We had the Salmon, Trout, and the grilled chicken hummus wrap. Our son also had the lobster bisque which he enjoyed. Our server was named Alex and she did a very good job answer menu questions and describing the specials. Our water was always kept full and she checked back on us in timely fashion. We will go back to Rosewood Grill. Plan on going to a Happy Hour as we have heard good things."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this place is very nice. Probably the highest step you could go before reaching a fine-dining level. I was wearing a t-shirt and shorts (something most people would wear to dinner on vacation) and felt borderline uncomfortable.

My fiancé had a Caesar salad and lobster bisque and I had the Tuscan Steak. Both meals were excellent and we would order both of them again. The bread and butter they provide free of charge at the table is also awesome. 

We came here for dinner to celebrate our last date night as a non-married couple and to celebrate the three year anniversary of our engagement. There was a box about celebrating an event on OpenTable when I made the reservation so I let them know. They provided us with a brownie/ice cream dessert free of charge that was excellent!

We will DEFINITELY be coming back as the prices were very reasonable. The setting and service were excellent. If you're looking for a nice place to take your girlfriend, wife, Mom, Grandma, or prospective significant other then look no further."}
{"text":"I went last night with my two friends around 6:30 and got seated right away,.  The atmosphere is a 10 and the bathrooms were clean and had special touches.
The food was AWESOME.  WIne prices are very good. I had the baked chicken, which truely hit the spot.  My friends had the fish tacos (super yum) and the Walleye with corn risotto (awesome!).  Definitely will be back...it's kinda hard to find..go down the road to Costco...but once found, I will never forget!"}
{"text":"I had the filet mignon & it was absolutely delicious! I have a dairy allergy & they were very accommodating & informative. They have a very large wine selection.
Don't except to spend less than $40 though."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here based on the great Yelp reviews, and we were not disappointed!  Great atmosphere, terrific food, and excellent customer service.  Def worth checking out."}
{"text":"I hang out here every now and then. They do not offer anything for a non-meat eater other than salad, fries, basically side dishes. It is a nice place. The girls and I usually go for drinks and hang out. During nice weather there is a fire pit."}
{"text":"If you're looking to fill your belly while simultaneously emptying your wallet you'll be glad you found the Rosewood grill. 

The food is excellent finding a way to please both the pallette and soul. 

The service was fantastic. Peyton is a bundle of knowledge and enthusiasm with apparently awesome taste. 

If you want something a little nicer, feel like impressing your s/o, or just wanna feel fancy..... do it."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere amd the service was very nice. Knowledgeable and attentive also very friendly. Went with the seafood special which was crab crusted salmon with a corn cream sauce. The sauce was amazing and the salmon was cooked nicely as well. Fish and chips was good as well. I will certainly return to check out some more of the menu"}
{"text":"Pretty good food (for a suburban restuarant location), but a bit overpriced for what it is.

We've eaten here several times and although the dishes are tasty and food quality was solid, I've always felt like I'm not getting the value for my dining dollar compared to other places I've eaten at around the greater Cleveland area.  Meals are always well put together and others in our party have enjoyed the meals as well.

Slightly better value at lunchtime."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because our food took quite a long time to come out. But, it was so worth the wait because it was great! French dip awesome, Mediterranean flatbread Great and pretty light. The atmosphere is great not super casual but not super fancy. Also, the warm bread was the icing on the cake!!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice and they always have amazing food, excellent service, and such a great romantic atmosphere. They went above and beyond to bring me a special non alcoholic drink and it was delicious, such a wonderful gesture!! So impressed"}
{"text":"I'm from NYC and in town for business.  Checked out the reviews and it looked like a worthy place.  Service was great, the steak was perfectly cooked and tender, potatoes were outstanding.  The picture says it all.

If your looking for an excellent meal at a reasonable price, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"We found a new place for lunch on our trip from D.C. to Detroit, just a few minutes detour off I-80, and definitely worth it. The lobster mac and cheese, creamed spinach, arugula/spinach salad (with added chicken), and rosewood salad were perfect, and we had leftovers for dinner at the end of our day.  Service was attentive, and the price is right. What more can I say?  We'll definitely be back as soon as possible. There are a lot more delicious options to try, and I just wish we'd had room for dessert."}
{"text":"Warm and cozy place for a nice meal. Good service and the food is great."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food.  Had the special.  Scallops with risotto and asparagus.  Risotto was like mud, too thick to eat.  Asparagus may have well have been raw.  The scallops were seared unevenly and had bits of sand on them. Yuck.  I will not try this place again.  For the high price the quality was low."}
{"text":"By far Best All Around restaurant in Strongsville.....Atmosphere, Food, Beer and very attentive staff..."}
{"text":"The second time visiting this restaurant was even better than my first! Our waitress was so nice and on top of her game. I didn't have to ask for anything, which is always nice. I ordered a rosewood Cosmo, which was delicious! I also had an arugula salad special for my appetizer, and drum roll...twin filets for dinner which were perfect! I'll be returning on my anniversary :)"}
{"text":"One of our favorite date night places! Great food, service and atmosphere. And where else can you enjoy a decent wine for $4 a glass? I just wish the place was bigger. Wait times can be long."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a nice atmosphere. The stone walls and dim lighting are really cool. They have a nice bar with good drinks and good service. 
I have only eaten here once. My review for this one time is three stars. The food was just ok. Nothing memorable... nothing that was oh my god, I love this! I would rather go to one red door down the street for the same price.
 They don't take reservations which is kind of a pain since its super crowded on summer nights. They do allow you to call ahead and put your name on the \"list\", which doesn't make any sense to me.... if they have a call ahead list, then why can't you just make a reservation?
It has a casual atmosphere. Jeans and a nice shirt would be appropriate. They have a nice patio with a huge fire pit. I was disappointed in the patio tables and chairs. Its a nice restaurant , but the patio chairs are those white plastic chairs, pretty cheesy for a nice restaurant.
Overall my experience was just ok. I would go back to try some other items on the menu. I had shrimp and they were over cooked. Maybe next time the food will be better."}
{"text":"This is my kind of place. I like the atmosphere, the food and the service. We called ahead and did not wait longer than 15 minutes even though there were several people waiting. I had a filet and my wife had a fish dish that looked great. Mine was cooked to perfection and the sides complimented the steak very well. We never felt rushed and our server was very attentive even with a full crowd. We will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Really?  You put a $15 tofu dish on your menu and you don't even use firm tofu?  If you are going to pretend you cater to vegans, you should at least educate yourself about tofu and how to prepare it.  This dish was completely one dimensional and boring, definitely not a $15 dish.

    The black bean burger was good, but it wasn't absolutely mind-blowing.  The salad served with it was nothing but bitters.  I did enjoy the bun, however.  You could scale the burger back and be fine, I didn't need all of the extra that fell off onto my plate.

  We asked for spicy bloody mary's and they were OK.  Not very spicy.

  The creme brulee was average, a decent custard, an almost ripe strawberry, and burnt to the point of bitter sugar on top.  

  My main complaint is that, while our server was good, it took at least 10 minutes to be acknowledged.  She is fortunate she brought the bread at that point or we would have left as my husband was starving.  Then, it took another 10 minutes for someone to finally realize we would need water to get that dry bread down.

  The atmosphere is interesting, but loud.

  For an expensive dinner, this was a disappointment overall.  I would much rather spend our money at Red Door."}
{"text":"Sat out on patio, which was very nice. I had the center cut strip and wife had the fish tacos....I recommend the pig and waffles though...I would've ordered that for dinner if it came in entry size."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place but it has a great atmosphere in and out. And the foods not bad and service is great! Has me coming back. I like the music! Very eclectic."}
{"text":"After a long day on the soccer fields with our daughters' teams we were looking for a place for 11 people to wind down with good food and drink.  Fortunately, Rosewood Grill was close to our hotel and had good reviews.  We were able to get the community table in the bar which served our large party well.  The twin filets with crab was prepared as ordered and the potato cakes were delicious too. The salmon that my friend had was delicious as well.  We sampled the jalapeño corn bread and it was a hit with everyone who tried it.  Worth the price and a good value.  Glad we discovered this place in Strongsville, Ohio."}
{"text":"I have a very mixed review. Our server was nice .. Bread was ok.. My salad was delicious. When we got our food it did take a bit of time and they were not busy what so ever. Our food came out my mother in law got a burger and asked for no cheese - it had cheese she said no big deal and scraped it off. My husbands steak was ok - his mashed potatoes however were BY FAR the grossest thing I've ever tasted in my whole life .. When the manager checked in we told her and she went to the kitchen and agreed that they were terrible. She brought him a baked potato. I got the half chicken and sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes were good thanks god because my chicken was really really bad. Everyone else tells me how great it is so I will probably give it another try at some point I just have other places I would put before I would go back."}
{"text":"Holiday Cheer....with a Side of Grinch
Met 7 former co-workers for a little reunion lunch. Reservation process went smoothly and our table was set up and ready when we arrived. Our server was very patient with us-we hadn't seen each other in over a year and there was lots of catching up to do. We all got light lunches, salads and whatnot, but the point was getting together with friends.  Our server seemed totally on board. 

One of our group made brownies to celebrate all the birthdays we've missed celebrating together, and we asked for dessert plates. Our server informed us that Rosewood has a policy against outside desserts and that we weren't allowed to eat it there. 

They have a POLICY? I've never heard of such a Grinchy, miserly, bah-humbuggy response to 7 elderly women wanting to celebrate birthdays. 

They have a POLICY? Against people wanting to use their restaurant to meet, eat, drink? Because let's be very clear here:  we bought and paid for our lunches and drinks. 

So, the food and service and ambiance were lovely. 5 stars.
The POLICY? 0 stars. 

We won't be back."}
{"text":"I made reservations for 4 a week in advance for the outdoor patio Saturday at 6:30 pm and was assured by the polite young lady I spoke to on the phone that this was no problem.  Different story when we got there and were met by the hostess who told me there were two groups ahead of us and we would have a 30-60 minute wait.  When I told her I made my reservation for outdoors she got a bit defiant and told me that several people with reservations had decided to dine outdoors and were not readily leaving but we could be immediately seated indoors.  We took a vote and opted to be seated indoors.  The meal was fine, but upon leaving my wife mentioned to said hostess that perhaps they shouldn't offer outdoor reservations if they couldn't fulfill them, met once again with a smugness and indifference that left a bad taste in our mouths.  We specifically chose Rosewood because of the comfortable patio and stellar weather forecast that evening.  Had we wanted to eat indoors there were a plethora of restaurants we could've chosen closer to us.  Not a good way to do business..."}
{"text":"The little fire pit area out on the patio is amazing! I highly recommend the lobster Mac and cheese as well! Service is always top notch!"}
{"text":"We went to Rosewood Grill in Hudson with another couple, without all the kids.  A nice night out.  The restaurant is very appealing from the exterior and interior.  The bar is well stocked with a huge window into the kitchen.  The bar seating area has a huge communal table (first come, first served) and some other tables around.  Enter the dining room and you are greeted with massive stone block walls and earth tone decor to match.  

The service in this restaurant is excellent.  The bartenders and courteous and quick with a drink.  They also aren't shy on the pour.  The servers basically run laps throughout the restaurant and the floor managers are not far behind.  All the way to the expediters, this place is run like clockwork.

One disturbing point was the reservation system, or lack thereof.  You can't make reservations, but you can call ahead.  Seems like a reservation to me and a really ridiculous system.  For a restaurant of this caliber, reservations should be standard.

Our food was hit and miss, unfortunately.  Chef Bambic, formerly of Blue Point Grill, hit on a lot of areas but seemed to fall short on a couple others.  The calamari was some of the best we have had, with fried banana peppers and parsley.  Delicious.  The crab bisque I had was doused with sherry verging on being unpalatable.  

For our main dishes, the center cut filet was cooked perfectly- great, simple dish.  Both of the bone-in strip steaks that were ordered arrived cold and the meat really didn't have much flavor without the house steak sauce.  The side of tempura green beans was absolutely delicious and the roasted potatoes were done well.  

The last dish, the Lobster Ziti, was really terrible.  The pasta was overcooked, lacking the ability to hold any sauce and too large for the plate.  The sauce was watery and brown with a strange flavor profile.  This entire dish was a complete mess.

For dessert, we only ordered the chocolate \"moose\" which arrived in a glass with tuile moose antlers.  Looked a little too Wally World to me.  The mousse was dense, too cold and cloyingly sweet.  It also tasted like refrigerator and had a skin on the top.  Not great.

I bet that this place serves a mean burger and flatbread.  Some time when we have a babysitter again we'll visit this place- most likely to sit at the bar so we don't have to deal with their non-reservation reservation system.  The service and ambiance take this restaurant to three stars in my book."}
{"text":"Went to Rosewood Grill while visiting Westlake for a doctor's appointment.  It was outstanding from start to finish.  The building exterior is beautiful, with tan stone and a huge fire pit.  The interior is new and upscale, with calming tans and browns and glass containers filled with wine corks.  

Our waitress was super nice and helpful.  The killer French dip WAS killer!  The meat was high quality, tender and flavorful; the bread was fresh and tasty; the horseradish sauce had a really nice bite to it; and the au jus was real.  The fries were crisp and delicious and served in a cute container.  I dipped them in the horseradish sauce and then the au jus.  Heaven!

Can't wait to return on our next visit!  So good we suggested they open a restaurant in the Raleigh area!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Rosewood Cafe.  My girlfriend picked it today for my birthday luncheon.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and inviting. We started with the Lobster bisque,  which was excellent.  My friend ordered the special of the day, a buttermilk fried chicken with cornbread. I ordered the fish tacos.  The waitress came back a long time later,  saying that they were out of cornbread and my friend needed to choose a different side. . Shortly after she brought my fish tacos out without my friends food.  The tacos were cold and truthfully not good at all.  When the chicken entree arrived it was burnt to a crisp and looked horrible. It took our waitress 3 visits to our table to notice i was not eating the tacos before she asked me if something was wrong with them. She only refilled my fiends coffee upon request.  The manager did comp our entire meal,  so we were satisfied with that. Based on this visit,  I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"sushi shots - excellent.
lobster bisque - 2nd best I've ever had.
nice atmosphere.  beautiful restaurant.
special occasion restaurant for me."}
{"text":"Julie was not the best server. I'm a server myself so I give slack when slack is needed if it's during peak hours or just crazy busy. However, She took our drink order then our dinner order then never stopped by again until we finally had to raise our hand and ask for our check. I drank my wine before dinner came, which was dropped off by a bus boy. She never stopped by to see if I or my boyfriend wanted more to drink, never stopped by to see how the food was (which I was not a fan of, I got the lobster mac & cheese side) and even when she finally came over with the check, never asked how anything was. I may return to try other foods in the future but I'll be sure to not sit in her section."}
{"text":"This place was quite good.  The town is really cute (has a real New England feel to it) and this little place was a gem.  From the apps to the entrees and dessert, everything we tried was quite good and had a bit of imagination, nothing that you could get at an Applebee's.

For me the highlight was the entree, I got the twin Filets and while I tend to go for a heartier cut like a ribeye, the flavors in the filets were excellent and I was not disappointed at all.  Everyone at the table seemed to have a great meal and there didn't seem to be a bad option on the menu.  I will gladly go back here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Pea soup ~ 4
Beet salad ~ 4
Scallops w/ Brussel sprouts & sweet potato ~ 2
The scallops were way too salty such that they were basically in edible. Everything else was very good."}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing appetizers amazing atmosphere. Would Dine here over and over again. We always get the buffalo chicken spring rolls and lobster bisque to start!!! The butter for their bread is amazing... the little things sometimes lol. Had the halibut and my husband had the filet topped with crab... yum yum yum!!!!"}
{"text":"First I would like to start off with how unbelievably friendly the staff was for our first visit to Rosewood Grill.  From the moment we walked into the door until we left the team was very attentive. The manager on duty even welcomed us with a small monkey bread.  Unfortunately the food did not live up to the the inviting atmosphere.  My husband ordered eggs Benedict which was cold.  We ordered more hollandaise hoping this would warm it up a bit but that too was cold.  Not Luke warm but chilly.  Cold eggs, not so fond of .... that said the prime rib hash was delightful and I felt a bit guilty that I enjoyed my brunch so much when my husband did not!  The Bloody Mary was beautiful and tasty, unfortunately way too hot for me to drink.  I regrettable sent it back. Over all a solid 3 and we will go back at another time to try the lunch or dinner menus."}
{"text":"one of our favorite spots.  Eat outside when you can or the \"common\" table in the bar area.  Love this place."}
{"text":"We just moved to Hudson, love the food and atmosphere here.  Perfect for date nights!"}
{"text":"Knowledgable waitress. Offered wines to offset acidity and compliment the meal. Great atmosphere. Overall very pleasant. Food was great. Fillets were great. Brussels were awesome."}
{"text":"We received a Cleveland Independents (check it out if you don't know what it is!) gift card as a wedding gift in September and you're able to choose between a few dozen Cleveland area restaurants to use the gift card.  We selected Rosewood Grill as I'd been to the Strongsville location before.  We had the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer that was just \"eh\"...  I had the apple gorgonzola salad which was delicious and my husband had a house salad.  My husband had the spicy smokey burger or something to that affect?  He enjoyed it but the burger was not done enough.  I had the rustic Italian flatbread.  The flatbread, spinach artichoke dip and the bread brought to the table were all overly salty.  The chef must be heavy-handed!  I had the \"chocoholic for dessert which was again, just \"eh\"...and my husband had the crème brulee which was not fresh as parts of it were still frozen.  We receive our bill of $69 and we give the $50 Cleveland Independents gift card and they argued with me about using it and they had to call the general manager to get it approved.  This took an additional 10 minutes or so which was completely unnecessary.  I will say, however, our server was wonderful and he was very passionate about the burger he recommended to my husband.  It's a beautiful restaurant but I don't know that we'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food & staff. We had an early dinner so sat in the bar first for happy hour drinks, I wasn't crazy about the Texas Lemonade yes it had vodka but even more beer, yuck. They changed out my drink which was much better. The mushroom Brie flatbread alone is worth going back for. I was happy with other vegetarian choices too. The tofu was good & plenty enough for lunch too. Loved the decor. John our server was top notch."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on a sat afternoon..got seated right away then waited about 10 min til I had to ask a water girl to get our waitress.after we ordered a appetizer we were passed off to another server.who then took our order.I ordered the \"killer\"french dip..wow..killer? Barely a step up from arbys...my wife ordered fish tacos..one tiny piece of perch on each of the 2 tacos..pitiful ..I mean for a renowned hospitality group these place was horrible...I  really can't believe the service and food at this place...won't be back"}
{"text":"Great place to go on a weekend. Call ahead seating is a must as the wait can be long. What's great is the service.  Most of the servers know the menu in and out, can offer suggestions, are very friendly, and accommodating.  We usually request the same server because she is wonderful.  Managers usually always check on the tables and if anything isn't perfect they correct it.  This place wont nickel and dime you for making substitutions to sides or changing the item to your specifications. Food is great. Looking to spend about 30-60 a person with food and drinks.

This is one of our favorite restaurants!  I always get the ribs, they are wonderful!  My wife tries something new each time and is never disappointed.  There are some unique dishes and classics that are just done exquisitely."}
{"text":"Love this place, great food and great atmosphere! It's a go to place for us. The fillet is the best thing on the menu, and the moose dessert is the best."}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant when we can't decide where to go. Food and service never disappoint. You can hang out at the bar or go for a nice romantic dinner. Their prices are very reasonable and better food compared to many places in Hudson. 

Tip: Try the lobster bisque or sushi shots. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"The waitress literally sat EVERYONE before us. Just because she had adverse feelings for whatever reason about our family. They also said that they won't seat us with available tables because they are \"understaffed\". This restaurant made me wait 45 minutes while many families walked past us and got immediately seated. It was crazy and I will not be coming back for just mediocre food."}
{"text":"If I must be honest, I was hesitant to go to Rosewood Grill.  Typically I'm not a big-box restaurant kind of girl.  I avoid them, most of the time, at all costs.

It was the week of Christmas and time for my annual dinner date with my dad.  I chose Rosewood because it was close to the highway and he could get there easily on his way home from work.  

To my great surprise the restaurant was lovely.  I found the aesthetic to be beautiful.  The service was spot on, attentive but not overly-so.  Our waiter did not give the usual annoyed vibe that we were there and had gifts to exchange and chatted a while prior to placing our order.  Our waiter also made good wine and entrée recommendations.  

The food was well-prepared and well-thought out.  I enjoyed the lamb-burger with sweet potato fried.  My dad had the fish tacos.  Neither of us had any complaints.

I would return for sure.  The patio looks lovely and might be nice in the warmer months."}
{"text":"Place was empty and really worth it. I was stoned after my golf match. Drink on the rosewood red beer. essential lager for nice autumn afternoon. I am going to rip an old man fart on the youngster sitting next to me. This sneaky bastard. I am going to crush his ugly nose when I am trying to enjoy my lager

Shrimp tacos are essential. step it up a notch and had a side szechuan green beans. Added pineapple salsa, cheese zest, and gaucamole. Cilantro rice and few nachos add a nice extra. meal delivered and I thank the man upstairs and ginseng. babies and big bros, I can't fight this feeling for so long."}
{"text":"Lovely decor and friendly staff - happy hour specials are good but skip the $1 oysters as they are basically tasteless. Never been inspired to spring for dinner but location in historic building looks nice. 

Great spicy burger for lunch - packed well for carry out so you can enjoy it later! Fab coleslaw"}
{"text":"I am pretty generous when it comes to ratings but this place did not earn the top rating from me. Very mediocre experience for the $$ spent. Everything was just average and there was nothing very exciting about the atmosphere.

{"text":"It is my most favourite place . Excellent atmosphere and excellent food and the staff is fabulous . They treat me extremely well and I enjoy the ambience whether its indoor or outdoor dinning by the fire . Ms Katie who is the manager is very personable and a people's person  and ensures everyone is having a good time . She runs the place extremely well. Nick is a good man. Collins made our evening very enjoyable. I have  been going there for years and this place just grows on you . A special thanks to Ms. Sharon who is amazing and takes great care of me . Also my thanks to John who is excellent in what he does . Always look forward to going there to have a good time !!
Thanks !!

{"text":"C'mon, I can't be the ONLY one who thinks the sushi-shot hype is just that...hype. I would not recommend the sushi shot appetizer to anyone, ever. Why anyone would put such wonderful raw tuna in a tasteless (dare I say cardboard) cup is beyond me. The moist, succulent tuna sticks to the cup like snot on a wall. It's only a matter of time before the moisture evaporates or gets sucked up by the wonton cardboard. The wasabi is actually some diluted, creamed light green nothingness that provides....well, nothing and the avocado salsa completes the blahness of this overstated appetizer.  I believe they served a side of sriracha but so what. Put sriracha on something and guess what it tastes like? Uh, sriracha. (Down with Sriracha already, it's taking over fine restaurants everywhere!!!) Want tuna? Stick with Shuhei or Pacific East or the food bar at Heinen's.

I'll hop off my sushi shot soap box and say that the staff were friendly, attentive and helpful --- great service. Rosewood must have other food that's better to keep such good folks, so for that reason alone, I'd go back if I was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for my birthday and it was a bit of a mess. We had a 430 reservation, so it was not crowded- we were the only table in our section of the dining room. Our beverages took a long time and they had trouble With the keg and one guest had to pick something new.
Our soups were forgotten about and entrees brought out. We reminded the server we had soup and he took our food back, and brought soups. We had been waiting for so long with a basket of rock hard bread. Once the entrees came back out my steak was room temperature at best. The Fish special was not good at all- it just tasted bad- the flavors didn't go together and the fish was burned on the bottom and super pricey. 
We are so bummed about this experience- and on my birthday? It was a major disappointment."}
{"text":"Been here for an hour and still haven't gotten our food. Ordered as soon as we sat down."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in theCleveland Metro area since moving to Northeast Ohio two years ago.  

We drive 40 mins to shop at SouthPark mall and always enjoy topping off the visit at a stop here for dinner.

The family enjoys the atmosphere and the quality of the appetizers and entrees.  

Please open a new location on the Westside near Bay Village / Westlake area!!!  Crocker Park is expanding!!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. That sinking feeling you get when you sit down for a meal and it suddenly occurs to you that you are in a very fancy basement eating a meal that could be prepared in a shopping mall. 

I had a flavorless spinach salad and an uninspired stuff trout. I can't say I enjoyed them. The strongest impression I had was that the meal tasted exactly like the kind of food you eat in an airport restaurant. Bland, safe, indistinct flavor profile, nothing particularly inspired.  

The salad was banal and ice cold, as if it had been prepared the night before and spent the whole day in a refrigerator.  The previous day, I had eaten dinner at the Red Door which is a couple of blocks away, where I enjoyed a salad that was memorable: zesty sauce, warm lardons and crispy thick chunks of bacon over richly flavorful spinach. In contrast, the salad at Rosewood Grill seemed tame and boring. 

The trout was cooked alright but the stuffing (shrimp and corn) could have benefitted from any sort of flavor (cajun, or mild spice, or buttery, or creamy) but it was devoid of character. Again, I had the impression that the stuffing had been made the day before and the dish was simply assembled upon ordering.  Dull, dull, dull and tedious. 

I took away one star because the server was so indifferent.  We arrived during happy hour, but she dourly informed us that we could not enjoy anything from the happy hour menu because we were seated in the restaurant, even though the entire place was empty and the bar area was immediately adjacent to the table where we were seated.  She also steered us towards more expensive wines by the glass instead of the house wine.  I felt manipulated. 

Pricey for what you get. Lousy indifferent service and a mediocre meal in an old basement. You can do better in Hudson."}
{"text":"We were weary travellers headed to Michigan and stumbled onto this place. Outstanding food and service. Thanks for your kindness. Very comfortable. We loved it so much on the way there, we stopped for dinner again on the way home!"}
{"text":"Nice setting. Food was good, not great but they are still getting adjusted to being open. Has potential. For a chain a good restaurant overall."}
{"text":"It felt like it belonged in Strongsville (it didn't have much of an edge, it wasn't super trendy, there were 30-50 age couples and friends dressed nice but casual)... if you want hipster, don't bother, if you want a good meal in Strongsville, you're at the right place.  It had good food, a menu that had a little for everyone, my girl liked the veggie burger, the server did a good job keeping up with my requests.  It was packed so make sure you call ahead, get reservations or just cram into the bar area and drink wine with 1100 of your closest friends while you wait.  Nice place."}
{"text":"Sigh...I couldn't decide whether to give Rosewood two or three stars. If it was based on my personal taste and  experience alone, it would be two (and I'll explain why below). I decided on three because the service, atmosphere, and fellow guest's experiences and meals were on par. 

My mistake was getting the fish tacos. I was very dissatisfied and unimpressed with my fish tacos a few bites into them, and I actually contemplated speaking to a manager because I simply wasn't happy about it. I didn't do this for two reasons. One being we were with a group of people and I didn't want to be \"that person\", and two, I absolutely hate food waste. They were edible, so I ate what I could and stuffed the rest in a box to sit in my boyfriend's fridge for the next week and a half until he tossed them out for me.

The tacos consisted of breaded, deep-fried pieces of previously frozen whitefish, coleslaw, a sour cream drizzle on top with some pepper thrown over top. It included sides of chunky-style jar salsa and black beans overtop of plain white rice...for $17, which is waaaay too expensive for the dish I was served. 

Horrible deal, terrible execution of fish tacos. This menu item needs to be re-evaluated and taken off the menu or completely renovated. 

Great. Now I feel like a drama queen for bitching about my first world taco problems for five minutes. I would still try Rosewood, but I would completely avoid ordering the fish tacos."}
{"text":"I will start by saying, I love the atmosphere of this restaurant. Something about being in the basement of this all brick building and how it was renovated really made a great environment. The downside to it, it was kind of loud in the facility. Everyone talked at a higher level of volume so it was tough to really gather thought. 

Perfect place for wine and dine with a date! 
Make reservations!"}
{"text":"I REALLY loved this place. The atmosphere and service are great. The food was really good, and the dessert was awesome as well!

We went with a large group of family, so I feel like I tried just about everything on their menu. I ordered the cedar plank salmon, but the stand out to me were the szechuan green beans! Holy cow, they were so good! My husband had fish tacos, which he loved and a side of sweet potato fries. For dessert we shared the creme brule and the chocolate mousse. Both were awesome.

My only issue is that the pricing seems a little high, but the fact that I would pay it again probably shows you how much I liked it there."}
{"text":"Want to know the difference between \"call ahead seating\" and a \"reservation\"...me too.  Rosewood does NOT take reservations...however, you can call at 9:00am  and \"call ahead\" your time for dinner. (THAT'S A RESERVATION). Confused, me too.  After arriving, we had a lovely debate about the reservation \"policy\" with a snotty 17 year old hostess.  

 Overall, service was so-so, food was so-so.  

 I'll go back and give them another chance, however  was not impressed.

 Decide for yourself."}
{"text":"I had the chicken tortilla soup and the halibut with tomato risotto. Both were very good, as advertised by the bartender, and served at perfect temperature. The serving sizes were larger than I expected which was a pleasant surprise, and you may want to keep this in mind if you're considering ordering apps or soup/salad. 

Best service I've had in a long time. Top shelf. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the entrees are slightly overpriced - but not too high to keep me from returning."}
{"text":"Whenever I attend a luncheon event I notice a lot of things about the venue. Not just the vibe, but also the service- is it obtrusive or no- and of course the food.

This place got high marks across the board for their service and food. Overall the only complaint I had was their lack of vegan options, which is hardly a complaint because this place is not targeted for that audience. 

I'd certainly return here for a work luncheon or event."}
{"text":"Went last night for sweetest day! Food was good but they had the air on and we literally ate dinner with our Coates on! Ask for them to turn the heat on but air continued to run!  Woke with a stuff next!  Food was a little better than the first time! Tad pricey! Noticed a lot if people eating the burger platters! Cute place other way!"}
{"text":"Food left something to be desired. We were a group of four and ordered the the specialty dish Lobster pasta, 2 chicken oriental teriyaki salads, and the baby back ribs. Then we ordered two appetizers, the calamari and rock shrimp. 

Appetizers first. The calamari was okay. It tasted like nothing special but the dipping sauce was good. The rock shrimp were so small one member of my party asked the waiter \"where are the shrimp?\" The shrimp were 3/4 breading. 

My lobster pasta was very bland and I was trying to give it away. It was in a heavy cream sauce with spinach, lobster, and mushrooms but the bland sauce decimated all flavor. 

The salads were good but they were rationing dressing and both members of our party had to ask for more. I liked the flavor of the chicken which was probably even more so after trying to consume my flavorless lobster pasta. 

I tried a bite of the ribs and was underwhelmed too. They were very dry and the rub provided little flavor. 

The best part of the meal was the chocoholic dessert. It was actually very well sized and we all had a several bites from one. I will also commend the service. They were very attentive and it wasn't their fault the food was failing. 

Now the worst part, It was almost $140 for 4 people without alcohol. For that price and food quality I'm taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place was cool.  It was nice to sit at the bar and not be stalked since it has more of a couples feel.
PRIME RIB - I didn't care for it.  It had a tasty outside but it wasn't \"crusted.\" I ordered it on a Sunday night.  Menu indicated that it was $10 off on Sundays after a certain time.  I ordered it with a baled potato to go.  When they brought my food, I was told the $10 off didn't apply to carry out.  I asked why they didn't tell me when I ordered to which she quickly replied that they still gave me the discount, but they wanted me to know for the future.  ...ok, acceptable I guess but gives them a ding.  Especially since it wasn't that good.  And their horseradish sauce game is weak.
Went back later in the week.  
LOBSTER BISQUE - Very good!  I love lobster bisque but more often than not, it's too fishy for me.  This was perfect.  They top it with flaked lobster.  Could use some chunks of Lobster but so tasty!
BAKER POTATO - I had it twice and they are very good.  They are huge and the toppings are great!
I would go back.  The bartender chick was cool.  Solid 3 stars, leaning towards 3.5."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Rosewood where i had met a friend for lunch. Sat in the bar area and the service was decent. As a starter we ordered the deviled eggs. Definitely not the best I've ever had but they were edible. My friend ordered the Fried Shrimp Po' boy with no avocado. The shrimp tasted frozen and pretty bland. They also forgot the remoulade the menu describes so we had to ask for that halfway through the meal. I had the \"killer French dip\" sandwich and substituted a salad instead of fries at no charge which I appreciate (a lot of places in the area will upcharge).  Especially since I had ordered a $19 sandwich that barely had any cheese and was just \"ok\". Definitely not \"killer\". We left less than impressed. It's a little pricey for the entrees that we were served and I wouldn't go out of my way to return. Mediocre at best. Hard pressed to give 3 stars but no complaints about the service and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Rosewood is a very nice restaurant. If you go, I would recommend wearing clothes that are more on the dressy side.
The food is very well done, and they have a large menu to satisfy everyone's needs. I usually get the French Dip sandwich or a steak.
The atmosphere is very modern, clean, and open. The patio has a fire place. I would recommend going to Rosewood."}
{"text":"A classy place located in a strip mall with a hibachi steak house. We decided to head over here based on the yelp reviews and the diverse menu, and it really did not disappoint!
We came in around 3:45, when they were transitioning between lunch and dinner, so they kindly asked if we would grab a drink by the bar while they prepared a table for us. I got a glass of their reisling and my partner got their moscow mule- he wasnt impressed, but i liked my resiling and our bartender. Bill: 16$ for 2 drinks.
We were seated within 20 minutes and our server started us off with some fresh italian bread and some sweet butter.. yum! The bread was still steaming hot, so thats a good sign :)
I got the walnut crusted scallops.. sooo good! It came on a bed of mashed potatoes and cauliflower and roasted brussel sprouts. It was an excellent dish and i highly recommend. The scallops were huge and well cooked! My friend got a burger, he said it was cooked to perfection and delicious as well. We shared a lobster bisque and that was delicious. It was not overly salty or buttery, came garnished with a scoop of lobster and def the best bisque i have ever had. A little pricey ( mainly because the scallop dish was 26$), but definitely worth it.
Its a nice classy place, great for families or even a date. They have an outdoor patio with a fireplace that can be romantic at nighttime. Id recommend this place and look forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"After receiving a recommendation from a colleague, decided to have lunch with a friend at the Rosewood Grill.  I was skeptical since it was in a strip mall.  However, I was greatly surprised.  The outside patio looked cool - - would like to return when they have a fire lit.  

Once inside, the interior was modern, clean and inviting.  We were seated immediately.  The service was a bit slow in the beginning but there were a slew of those red-hat cult ladies causing a ruckus.   Once the old gals left, it was smooth sailing.  

We each had the lobster bisque(good.  very rich but good).   The menu was full of tempting dishes and had a hard time deciding - - split the Rosewood house salad (no additional fee for splitting/sharing) and also shared the rustic Italian flatbread.  

Per the menu, the Rosewood house salad consists of Green City Lettuce, Mozzarella, Carrots, Cucumber,Watermelon Radish, Ciabatta Croutons and Honey-Lemon-Chardonnay Dressing.   It was very good.  We both liked the salad.  

The Rustic Italian flatbread consists of Sweet Sausage, Roasted Peppers,
Caramelized Onions, Garlic, Herbs and  EVOO.  It was sprinkled with not your ordinary herbs - it was some sort of addictive, finger-licking seasoning.  Scrumptious!

I would like to return and explore."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice lunch at the Rosewood Grill this afternoon with my wife this midweek afternoon. The decor is a nice upscale look, a big change from the old Applebee's. Nice to see the seasonal ontap beers listed over the bar with a brief description of the beer. There was enough of a crowd to give the sense that people wanted to come here while still being open enough to get a seat without waiting. The noise (music, restaurant and dinners) was comfortable - you could hear the person across the table with out having to shout. 

We arrived a little after 12:00 noon and we promptly seated off to the side of the bar area with menus and drink list. Our hostess was over with water within a minute of us taking our seats and she promptly asked if we would like any thing else to drink, I opted for a Angry Orchard (not working today) while my wife had a soft drink.  Our hostess was back within 5 minutes checking to see if we had any questions and took our lunch order.

My wife liked her pasta primavera, noodles were cooked al dente with just enough sauce for taste without drowning out the dish. I had the pick three special of lobster bisque, smoked turkey sandwich and a wedge salad. The bisque was spot on with a fair amount of lobster. The smoked turkey sandwich on ciabatta bread was alright, my opinion is that it takes a lot to make a turkey sandwich great. The accompanying wedge salad was also alright, again a wedge salad is not the yard stick I would use to measure the quantity of the kitchen. 

Final thoughts is that I would be glad to return for lunch or dinner. The lunch menu had some good looking options for a light or heavier meal. Prompt and professional service, timely while not be overbearing, and a nice ambiance of decor and background music."}
{"text":"Rosewood had a nice menu, the decor is gorgeous and chic and the wine list is great. It was good but not enough to blow my mind.  I agree with Yelp Miranda B. - the menu feels like it's the handiwork of a rookie restaurant consultant.  Nothing is too out of the ordinary to make you think anyone in the kitchen is taking any risks. Feels very Hudson-y so I can see it sticking around for a long time but I wasn't impressed enough to return."}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend at Rosewood Grill in Westlake, Ohio during the week of March 6, 2016.  We both had cheeseburgers with bacon and cheddar cheese.  Each burger was accompanied by some outlandishly toothsome french fries, along with lettuce, tomato, raw onion slices and pickle slices.  The burgers were cooked exactly as  requested.  Wow.  Great burgers.  The fries were so perfectly prepared that I ate them even after they cooled off, something I never, ever do.  I think the fries must have been cooked in peanut oil to as they were almost as good cold as when they were piping hot.  They have a soup special for each day of the week.  The prices are moderate.  The service was very, very good.  The noise level was low to moderate."}
{"text":"Pretty good food here. Service has always been A+ as well. One meal came out lukewarm, but that was the only real complaint I've had. It was the tofu \"steak\", which has been cooked to the proper temperature every other time I've had it. The sauce, I think it's a chili-lime, is excellent. Portion size is huge, so plan on taking some home. I also love the Rosewood red, an amber lager that is brewed for them....my wife says the seafood is good too. She likes the fish tacos. Make a reservation on busy nights, though, or you'll be waiting!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here and the food was way over priced and it tasted like garbage..should have went to McDonald's...won't recommend this place..."}
{"text":"They open at 4:00pm on Sunday the info is wrong- went there at 3:00 and were prepping to open"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Make sure to get the calamari! Tonight, I tried the Oriental Chicken Salad for the first time that was FANTASTIC. So flavorful and huge!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here with another couple Saturday night (11-24-12) food and service were awesome.  We ate in the dinning room.  I had the lobster bisque and twin filets.  Couldn't eat the 2nd filet - bonus for my husband!  He had the lobster ziti and said it was very good.  We ate here about 6 weeks ago and dined in the bar area.  Equally nice.  We both had the fish special on that date and it was very good.  We used to dine here when it was Turner's Mill so it's nice to see such a cool property being put to good use."}
{"text":"The food here is spectacular, but only half as spectacular as the service. I ordered the special (bone in ribeye) to be cooked \"rare\". When I got my steak, it was a little over cooked (nothing obscene, just more done than anticipated). I told the waitress it was fine, and I'd be more than happy to eat the steak. The general manager, Devin, insisted on bringing me a steak done how I ordered it, even though I insisted that I was fine eating the first steak. Long story short, I was treated to 2 steaks for the price of one! Devin, and the rest of the Rosewood Grill staff were amazing, and have found 4 new \"regulars\"!!"}
{"text":"Consistently one of the better places to eat in Strongsville. We have come as a large group and alone for lunch.

For lunch, the soup and sandwich are always great as are the daily specials with my favorite being the stroganoff.

As a group, nice appetizer selection to share and they are always very accommodating to issues with allergies or vegetarians in the group.

Definitely a go to when in Strongsville."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Rosewood Grill based on the menu I'd seen online.  They have an impressively broad menu and price range, with everything from steak to tofu to sandwiches.  I went with the cashew-crusted tofu, which was served with a spicy chili sauce.  I wish they would have used firm tofu, but other than that it was great.  Others at the table had the butternut squash ravioli and the steak.  Five stars for the food itself.  Also, our server was friendly and competent, which is always a plus. 

Beverage-wise, I was curious about the Sweet & Savory Sapphire, which is made with a crazy array of ingredients including Bombay Sapphire, fennel water, bitters, and pickled cherries.  When I asked the waitress if it was any good, she said the bartender had actually won a contest with this concoction.  That sealed the deal.  I was going for it.  In hindsight, I guess I realized that if none of the ingredients sound appealing, combining them is probably not going to be very tasty either.  Luckily, the martini glass was only half full (or half empty, depending on your outlook) so I was able to finish it off.  

The biggest aggravation was the lack of reservations.  Rosewood Grill proudly states that reservations are not accepted but call-aheads are.  So we called at 5:00 and were told that the next available \"call ahead\" was for 7:00.  That pretty much sounds like a reservation.  So we showed up at 7 and were told we had to wait til a table was free, which finally happened about 35 minutes later.  What's the point of a call ahead system like that?  

Once we sat down, the server was all over us: are you ready? what do you want to drink? what do you want to eat? how is everything? any dessert?  here's your check!  She was nice, but the service was just a bit too fast.  After waiting all that time in the drafty entrance area we didn't need to feel rushed like that.  

In summary, I would gladly eat Rosewood Grill's food in a quieter venue that takes reservations and doesn't rush people out the door."}
{"text":"Came here with a group for dinner.

We ordered a few appetizers to start.

The deviled eggs were excellent and topped with bacon and plated over a tasty, spicy siracha sauce. The fried calamari was lightly battered and perfectly fried and also has some cherry pepper slices mixed in and came with a creamy, garlic/siracha dip. The sushi cups were toasted wonton cups with ahi tuna and a light wasabi and soy drizzle.

For dinner I split a plate of lobster ziti was quite good as it had noticeable chunks of lobster and a tasty sauce. This came with a Caesar salad which weirdly arrived with a scoop of overly salty minced olives.

The décor and vibe was great and overall the food was very good. Why the three stars?

Because the salads came out while we were still eating our appetizers and even after commenting to the staff on this they brought the entrees while we were still eating our salad. That is by far one of my biggest pet peeves with restaurants, dont rush people when they are eating."}
{"text":"We live close to Rosewood so we go here quite a bit. Typically, the service is fantastic. We have had a couple misses...especially with the hostesses. They don't greet Rosewood guests with the enthusiasm and warmth you would expect. There have been times we walk in and it feels like we interrupted a high school slumber party. Once you get past them, it's pretty great. 
The buffalo chicken firecrackers are great, as are the sushi shots. The only complaint I have around the sushi shots is they increased the price and stopped providing siracha on the side. If you ask for it, they charge for it.
We haven't had a bad entree at Rosewood. This is our \"go to\" restaurant for out of towners!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a date night.. nice atmosphere great service.. I'd order the steak over the salmon!"}
{"text":"We had 30 family members meet on the patio for our annual get together the Saturday after thanksgiving. Phenomenal service. Great drinks, great service, great food, great night. Add this location to the rotation."}
{"text":"French Dip was great.  It could have been a little bigger portion for the price, but it tasted great.  Baked Potato side was gargantuan!"}
{"text":"This is a pricey chain restaurant. Nice interior, Ample parking, courteous staff and efficient service. The drink menu is extensive with good cocktails. The lime in a coconut mule was refreshing whereas the bloody orange margarita was salty. Interesting black lava salt. 
The breaded tofu with grilled asparagus and sweet Thai chilli sauce was good, tofu was soft, asparagus cooked to perfection, it lacked a little spice. The medium done wild salmon dish was good but could have used a little more of the spice sauce. 
Overall a good experience,  but for the limited choices based on our own dietary identity!"}
{"text":"Great place to go. Everything i ordered was delicious.  Pan seared salmon was great ,just like the lobster  mac and cheese"}
{"text":"high quality food & cocktails. beautiful inside. staff is snippy when it comes to outdoor seating for drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere in a building that used to be a mill.  Adequate parking available.  Their reservation policy is odd... Allows for call ahead but no reservations, except certain days like Mother's Day. The food is good at appropriate price. The lobster bisque and most seafood dishes are great. Good beer and wine selection. Good service usually.  Overall a nice experience in downtown Hudson."}
{"text":"Very good! My family and friends have been there many times. Great food and Great service. I love the atmosphere and we frequent this location at least twice a month. Enjoyed everything!"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE Rosewood fan. I used to live closer to Hudson and would eat there very often. Now that I live further away, I miss it! I must plan a trip to go back soon.

The ambiance is almost as divine as the food. It has an intimate cozy feel and the bar area is great for more of a casual yet cozy and classy feel. 

I would ALWAYS get the deviled eggs to start. They are so different from any other deviled egg--topped with bacon and siracha. They are bursting with flavor! I have had the twin filets (always juicy and cooked exactly the way I requested)  lobster mac & cheese, lobster tail, oysters and more. Everything has always tasted amazing to me and making me go back for more. Even the specialty drinks are tasty.

I can't wait to make it back to Rosewood this Summer!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner when the place was about half full. Food was delicious as always for the hospitality group. Strangely we received great service from everyone there except the server, who made two mistakes on the order and didn't smile. We will definitely go back, but this experience stood out."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere and the service, but the food just didn't cut it on my visit.

We had pork chop, and ribs, and neither were very good.  Their wine selection was fair to poor, and with a significant price hike.

They have this goofy policy of not taking reservations, but taking 2-hr call ahead seating.

Here's the worst...the waitress introduced us to \"Artisan bread by Orlando Bakery.\"  You're kidding me right?  That's like saying, \"hey here's Schwebels or Nickels.\"  I understand bread is one of the most reused products in a kitchen, but to have to articulate that it's Orlando Baking Company?  What, do they want me to go to Aldi or WalMart to buy some on my own?  Then, if the bread were such a big deal, why a bland, boring garlic butter to spread on it?  No oils?

I'll give them a second shot, but it was disappointing to expect so much more out of their menu."}
{"text":"Very nice place!  It seems a like it should be a stand alone place not part of a shopping center.  The restaurant does seem smaller on inside than outside.   But the layout is pretty nice, kinda upscale casual. 

The menu is good sized and had allot to offer.   The steak choices are smaller part of menu. But that's ok with what is offered here.   The meals come with sides but salad is extra.   Salad or soup is an extra $ 4 ($6 for lobster bisque)  They also have happy hour 3-6.

The choice of the night was center cut filet.   The menu pairs this with smashed potatoes, but I substituted gouda red potatoes.   The steak was awesome (worth $29), no fat and prefect medium rare!  You really don't need that steak knife.   The filet actually had lots of flavor, the cabernet reduction sauce is to die for.   The gouda red taters come in crock about 700 degrees, so they can wait.  They are done with just enough cheese to taste but enough to taste the taters too.  They Brown the top to add flavor.   They give a interesting bread with meal,  not quite sour dough a little sweet.   It's served with honey butter. 

This is a good place to eat and with the price.   Definitely better than longhorn. But you're paying for the difference."}
{"text":"Amazing. Our server is very personable and on top of things very attentative. Ryan is our server he has great recommendations. Lobster bisque. Lobster mac n chees sushi shots and the drink was awesome. Some melon cocktail I recomend that for sure super strong worth evey penny so refreshing. I ordered the steak special it was good not worth $34, but was good.my husband got the walleye under the specials he really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I love this place! Having just moved to Hudson from Chicago I'm always on the lookout for great restaurants, and this is one! Food is great - fresh and imaginative. Ambiance is nice for a large or small group. Bar area is great for more casual setting. I've taken every out of town guest here and they've all loved it."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Ohio, and my husband brought me here one evening after work. We sat at the bar and I had a glass of wine, and we shared the wood fired pizza. It was happy hour so the prices were decent. The pizza was very good, and they have a great wine selection. I love the atmosphere, including the charming outside patio. The service was just ok. We were waited on by the bartender, and she seemed annoyed anytime a new customer came in. I would love to come back for dinner sometime soon."}
{"text":"It's a very attractive space with lots of exposed brick and stone.   They have a nice fire pit outside.  The menu has good variety.  Portions are large, so expect to need a box, even if you are only ordering an entree with no appetizer.  The fish tacos were the favorite at our table.  Service was somewhat uneven.  Think 3/4 of the entrees arrive at one time and the last one arrives 5 minutes later and the occasional empty water glass.  A solid choice, but I wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Pricey, menu is limited and no variations in it. Happened to be there when someone called to see if there was a wait time, and the lady said 30 minute wait....and there wasn't anyone waiting???  Also, limited wine list ( by the glass) they want you to buy by the bottle ( expensive)."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I cannot recall the lady's  name that took care of us, but she did an amazing job. Food is incredible, and the service is awesome. The ambience is beautiful, and a little nicer than some similar restaurants, but the food makes this place a better night for date night. Love going here, and cannot wait to go back"}
{"text":"SUMMARY: Not one menu item we had all night had any flavor or proper seasoning. I would never return to Rosewood Grill.

I went to Rosewood Grill with my family. The atmosphere was nice and upscale, but that may be the only positive thing I have to say about this place.  

We ordered the italian flatbread and the sushi shots as appetizers. The sushi shots were gross because the tuna tasted like nothing and paired with guacamole was a strange choice. The flatbread was decent.

The waitress told us about the specials and said the best thing they had on the menu that night was the  halibut over garlic risotto with mixed vegetables and a mango puree. I thought it sounded delicious so I ordered that.  As soon as I said my order, the waitress said \"great choice!\" so again I had high hopes. My mom ordered it as well after the waitresses's recommendation. I was EXTREMELY disappointed with my meal when it came. Nothing had flavor and the puree was incredibly sweet, almost like a candy sauce. 

The rest of the meals were sub-par at best. My sister's salmon again had no flavor.  My dad's ribeye special was very fatty and bloody and for $36 was extremely disappointing. He ordered it medium but it was medium rare. The most acceptable of the night was my boyfriend's sirloin which was cooked to a medium even though he asked for medium well. 

While the presentation was very nice, it was meaningless because there was no flavor to the food. 

Trust me, the very high prices do not ensure a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Great food. Wonderful atmosphere. Wonderful staff. They will bend over backwards for those with food allergies. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I'll be the first to admit it, I'm a picky son-of-a-bitch when it comes to restaurants. Some might even say overly so. I'll also be the first one to agree with such an assessment. I like what I like and I'll make no apologies for it. Rosewood Grill not only met my expectations it exceeded them. 

Yes, Rosewood Grill is a \"restaurant concept\" found underneath the same corporate umbrella as Salmon Dave's and Delmonico's Steakhouse and yes, this probably puts them in the same category as places like Fleming's and Ruth's Chris, but is this a bad thing? Not if my experience on a recent Saturday evening has anything to say about it.

We arrived at the Strongsville location around 6:15pm. It's in a shopping plaza off of a busy road but it's set far enough back that even outside you barely notice the din of passing traffic. On the drive down from Cleveland we were remarking to each other that there may be a pretty hefty wait based upon what other Yelpers have said. Trying to get in here for six months? This I had to see. The reality was a far cry from this worry. There were a couple of people hanging out in the patio area as well as at a couple of tables inside and at the bar but the place was virtually empty. We were promptly greeted and seated at a booth in the bar.

The first thing I noticed when we walked in was the decor. It was immaculately clean and orderly. I'd gotten so used to eating at tables smelling faintly of stale washcloths and browsing sticky menus that I'd almost forgotten what it was like to be impressed. Tables set with spotless wine glasses and gleaming flatware, harvest yellow upholstery complimenting dark woods and textured wall coverings. It had class in every crevice and the attention to detail was evident everywhere. The bar area had a large open seating area with a great view directly into the kitchen through a massive cutout. This place just oozes class. Great for business dinners and dates.

Our server, Dan, was the epitome of what all servers should aspire to be - polite, well spoken, knowledgeable and attentive in just the right amounts. His brief run-through of the menu and expedient delivery of the daily specials was a clear testament to what I can only assume is a rigorous and complete training program. From appetizers to dessert we wanted for nothing.

When it comes to potent potables there are plenty of options. A tight half dozen draught selections with some pleasant surprises (Ommegang BPA anyone?) and two dozen bottles will make the beer geek smile. Cocktails more your thing? My wife opted for the Orange Blossom, a playfully sweet mix of top-shelf Hangar One mandarin blossom vodka, Three Olives Pomegranate, fresh lemon, OJ, and a champagne float. Served in a sugar-rimmed martini glass, this drink was beautiful. Enough about the drinks, what about the food?

Chilled Bacon & Eggs - I love deviled eggs and these didn't disappoint. Six halves filled with smooth, creamy innards and topped with crunchy bacon. The Sriracha on the side was a great addition and the use of stone-ground mustard a nice touch. My wife's are still my favorite but these are a close second.

Sweet corn-lobster cakes - Two golden-grilled cakes nestled alongside a small arugula salad dressed with a mango vinaigrette. The large chunks of lobster paired perfectly with the sweetness of the corn and mango and the punch of acid from the dressing was perfect.

Oriental Chicken Big Salad - When they say big they mean big. The crisp combination of Romaine and baby spinach was tossed with mango, avocado, tomato, roasted red peppers, cold cooked Lo Mein noodles, and toasted peanuts. The sesame-ginger dressing added a sweet touch to the tender, juicy chicken.

Rosewood Sirloin - This steak was cooked such a perfect medium that it could teach the word medium a thing or two. Tender, juicy, beautifully seared. One of the best pieces of meat I've ever eaten. Sure, the aged cheddar mash and grilled asparagus were tasty, but after that first bite of Angus who could remember?

Chocolate \"Moose\" Parfait - Yeah, we still had room for dessert. A layered dessert with alternating whipped cream, dark chocolate mousse and Oreo crumbles topped with more fresh whipped cream and a pair of cookie antlers. A perfect ending, not overly sweet and great with two spoons. My only minor complaint was that the Oreo crumble had softened probably from being made ahead of time.

Our first experience with Rosewood Grill was fantastic and will surely translate into a return visit. If you're tired of accepting average and phoned-in when it comes to dining out you need to head here. It will surely revive your spirit and faith in places that still know how it's done right."}
{"text":"Have been to both Westlake and Strongsville locations  several times and have always had great experiences with stellar service in a modern yet cozy setting. We recently dined at the Strongsville location early evening Saturday. After the delivery of a Rosewood Red Ale draught, brewed by Thirsty Dog Brewery of nearby Akron, we both chose to go with the Chicken Anna-thinly pounded and lightly floured breasts, pan seared, paired with linguini tossed in a light lemon/olive oil sauce with capers and cherry tomatoes....Delicious! The freshly baked warm crusty bread with whipped butter we had before and during the meal was addicting.  For dessert we had the hazelnut brownie which was the perfect ending to a scrumptious meal. Cameron was friendly and informative and provided great service and Christen was a pleasure to talk to and went above and beyond to make our dining experience perfect! As we were leaving we heard the hostess tell a couple that had just arrived the restaurant was full and there was a half hour wait which speaks of the popularity and reputation of Rosewood. Try it!"}
{"text":"Came in at 8:22pm to have dinner and was informed that the kitchen closed at 8:30pm.   When I mentioned that it wasn't 8:30 yet and that we were ready to order I was told by the hostess that I should go somewhere else if I wanted to eat.  

After traveling all day I was not amused.

Not impressed with their customer service at all."}
{"text":"Appetizers are usually good, drinks are ok. Atmosphere is nice. The lunches and dinners are not impressive. I feel the food is overpriced for the quality. Servers and service makes up for the disappointing meals."}
{"text":"Diminishing quality of food and nonexistent guest service. Multiple poor experiences in a row and lack of response from corporate has turned Rosewood Grill from a must-eat every week to a place I urge people not to taste. Disappointing evolution."}
{"text":"Price= check
Quality= check
Service= check
Bar= check

Give the grill a try for sure. Their lunch specials are great for getting out of the office. They have a cool soup, sandwich, salad option for 12 bucks and the roast beef with au juis is awesome.

I have not tried their dinner yet but I surely will. The bar seemed very well stocked and spacious, definitely a must try for the hit and miss Strongsville bar scene, Stay tuned more updates to come!"}
{"text":"Food was fine. Everything tasted good, and we had no complaints. The menu is pretty generic though, and there was nothing really noteworthy about anything we ate (blackened fish tacos, black bean veggie burger, shrimp linguini). Price points -- for lunch anyway -- were a bit steep.

The lobster bisque, while a bit pricey, was the star of the meal. It was truly outstanding. 

Service wasn't bad -- but was of the overly friendly, sort of exaggeratedly enthusiastic variety. It sort of makes you uncomfortable after a while. 

One blip was that while two of our lunches arrived together, the third arrived a good 4-5 minutes later without a word from anyone until it arrived. \"We were waiting for your rice to be done,\" was the reason we got when the third meal finally arrived. It was a long time to wait when my companions wanted to get started on their meals but also wanted to be polite and wait for mine to arrive.

In a nutshell, it's a good restaurant. There are just far too many dining options that really create a memorable experience."}
{"text":"We went to Rosewood Grill for a company lunch and they did well!

They set up up in a private room. The service was so wonderful! I love how they brought us allergy freaks, our plate out separately! Made me very happy since my shellfish allergy is so very severe. 

Food was fantastic. I loved the bread. Super  buttery!"}
{"text":"Multiple times I have been here. Service is pretty consistent. Everyone has their off days. This time is was great. The waiter we had was very attentive and patient with us. Very knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. I did call ahead seating and when I arrived I was sat right away. The wine the waiter suggested was good. I told him what I like and get got it right on the spot. The steak I received was perfect. Tasted great. I always forget about this place and I'm glade I remembered it. Come here, for dinner. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Completely underwhelmed.  The waitress was snippy with my daughter.  The $35 dollar sirloin was gristly and had NO flavor..... better steaks @!Longhorn!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for happy hour, and a happy hour was had!

They have a nice selection of beer, wine, and cocktails for $4 - $5.  I had the Manhattan (comes with Brandy soaked cherries) and the missus had the Cosmo (made with their homemade rose liquor.  Both were excellent drinks for the price.  

We then moved on to the cheeseboard which had 3 Wisconsin cheeses and an assortment of pickled vegetables, apricots, bread, and spicy grain mustard. 

The short rib sliders are a popular happy hour dish, but we instead ordered off of the normal menu.  I had the Walleye special, which was fresh, light, and summery while my wife had the crab cake with side salad and pickled vegetables.  Both dishes were well prepared and flavorful.  

We will definitely be back.  Our server Michelle was wonderful and took time to talk to us about the menu and to recommend dishes.  Give that girl a raise!"}
{"text":"This place. Been there five times now food is always fantastic service is great. Love that try tip can't beat it. The only thing to make better would be if they have Mashed potatoes"}
{"text":"This place has very good food. The pork chop and goat cheese bread pudding is really delicious, but doesn't come with a veg, so I ordered Thai green beans, super! Starters and awesome bread came out super fast but entree took a bit longer than I felt is reasonable..... But, food was definately worth the wait. Decor is classy, service fantastic so looking for mid to upper range dining experience, this one is great."}
{"text":"Really good food. Wife is a \"picky\" eater. Very accommodating. There was a 20 minute wait at 1pm on a Saturday. Prices are a bit steep even for Hudson."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the price. Horrible service and the food was bland and nothing to rave about. Got the crab topped filet mignon and was not impressed-- no flavor. The waiter was rude and did not give us the time of day. Never checked on us once we got our food. Definitely a place to skip!"}
{"text":"Been here before tonight service was terrible and they weren't busy. Sat outside they forgot a side dish and our drink didn't say anything. Prime rib special over cooked so disappointed a lot at Crocker need to step up their game. Table next to us also disappointed with their entree but didn't say anything to waiter just to us:("}
{"text":"Food and service was absolutely amazing! I ordered the pork chops with mashed sweet potatoes and brussel sprouts. Very pricy but well worth it! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A fanomiale restaurant for fine dining ! I had written a compliment some months back but, my feeling about dining here have not changed, great fare, service like no other&s in Town ! They picked up we're Turner's Mill left off and even increased them, by far ! Hand's down the best of Fine Dining in Northeast Ohio !!!!

{"text":"Rosewood Grill is consistently good.  They have an excellent wine list, and the servers are well educated about each wine.  There is a nice selection of appetizers.  Every entree at the table was very good.  Rosewood has a nice, cozy, upscale atmosphere.  Great for dates and family meals."}
{"text":"Have eaten at Rosewood Grill twice. Have enjoyed both times. I really dig eating in the bar area. The restaurant atmosphere is really relaxed and the decor is nice having it in the basement of an old historical building. The menu is solid, nothing crazy on the menu, have tried most of the apps and I really like the little neck clams with the sausage.Mmmm. Great selection of beers as well."}
{"text":"Food was simply delicious. We mostly ordered flatbreads and appetizers. Everything was just right! 

And, I'd like to thank you and your staff for the amazing service you gave us on Thursday night! 
I was the one who got engaged (yeah!!) and your staff were simply amazing. You put up with a big group of girls yapping away all night, and let us all get caught up in our excitement. It truly made the experience so much better. I can't tell you how much it meant!
Extra kudos to our servers and bartender (I was too excited to remember their names, so sorry!!). They had patience and we kept them long. And they never let us think they were bothered by it. 

Thank you thank you!!!!

Every trip we take back from Las Vegas will involve a visit to your restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of buddies on a Friday night. We had to wait like 20 minutes for a table for 6.
The place is pretty big and nice inside, has style. ALso an outdoor patio that on a nice night would be awesome, but more for drinks than eating as there weren't good eating tables.
Our waitress was cool. Fun, good amount of attitude but also a good server.
Started with bread, which was good. Typical.
We got the lobster cakes (with a little arugula salad) and calamari for appetizers. Lobster cakes were quite tasty, good flavor. Arugula was nice and Calamari was good too - a big plate of fried calamari.
Overall, good amount of food for the money.
I was drinking a Sneak Attack, which was good. Had a cool bottle.
Went with the Walleye, suggested by the waitress, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Expected a bit more fish, but it was good. Came with sweet corn risotto, which was rich, but good as well as julienne veggies, which were also good.
Finished with a raspberry cheesecake, which had a combo of thick and fluffy cheesecake aspects. Solid.
Overall, cool place, good food, reasonable for the price"}
{"text":"Oh my. My 12yr-old brother spent 10 minutes telling us how amazing the tomato bisque is... that's how good this place is. A 12yr-old boy. Tomato bisque with smoked bleu cheese. Yum. 

First, the boozy: SEVENTEEN stars. Either the chef is a multitasker of epic proportions, or they have a professional bartender. My sister had a cosmo, my mom had a delicious but very strong gin...something, and I had a \"beetnik\" cocktail - spiced pear vodka (suspiciously delicious enough to have been house-made), beet juice, something delicious and arugula. THERE WAS BEET JUICE AND ARUGULA IN MY BEVERAGE. I am a HUGE farmie foodie and I'm pretty sure my life became complete in that moment. Spiced pear and beet is a match made in farm heaven, let me tell ya. 

This particular night was vegetarian family fest, so we all had the veggie burger. You can sub the veg patty for any combination of toppings - as one of my good friends like to tease, I've asked for a veg patty *with bacon* before - and we did just that. I ordered the smoky-spicy burger with mushrooms, my sister had the regular smoky-spicy and I think my mom had the mushroom & swiss. It was all to die for. The fries were hand-cut and decent, but my side salad was the perfect complement to the grain-and-legume mass of burger on my plate. 

My mom was feeling celebratory (she just moved to Hudson) so ordered a nice bottle of wine. They had two vintages to choose from and we ordered the older (2005) bottle. The server strained it through a nifty sieve into a beautiful pitcher... this place is definitely dressed to the nines for wine service. 

Gentlemen... THIS is the place to take your wife just to show you love her, pop the question or sweep a new girlfriend off her feet."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, but was really disappointed. For a nicer place it was out of place to have the music blasting like we were in a sports bar. Didn't help that the server was a very quiet talker.

Server was nice, but we didn't appreciate the negative commentary about our wine choices. I don't want the waitstaff's opinion on my choices unless I ask for a recommendation and anyone in any type of sales knows that you don't talk the customer out of something, because you don't like it.

As far as the food: it was all pretty bland. We started with the calamari and the chili 'n eggs. The breading on the calamari was soggy and greasy. The eggs lacked any spice or seasoning. 

For our entrees I had the pan fries trout and my wife had the fish sandwich. Both dishes lacked salt. The \"Chardonnay sauce\" for the trout lacked any acid to counter the richness of the fish. The vegetable accompanying the trout was very oily and again completely under seasoned. My wife said the fish sandwich was just ok. Nothing to write home about. 

We might give them another try, but we were certainly underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice quiet lunch here. The ambiance was pretty cool - contemporary, high-class, but casual. Had the rustic Italian flatbread as an appetizer; and it was awesome! I could have made a meal out of that alone. For my entree I decided to be a little experimental so I tried the cashew-crusted tofu with sweet potato hash. The tofu was very mild, but it had a nice flavor, especially with the chili sauce that came with it. The sweet potato hash was loaded with potato cubes, snow peas, peppers, and some other stuff. I wouldn't order this again, but it was very tasty for something different. I would, however, come back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"We went to Rosewood Grill on Sunday night. Started at the bar while we waited for our table. The bartender was excellent. She filled our order in a timely manner, made a great martini and made great conversation, all the while serving a full bar. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. The menu is broad with choices for many diets. The food was very good. All four of us enjoyed out meals. A must try is the lobster mac and cheese side dish. Try to sit in the front room. It is a little more quiet there."}
{"text":"Went here around 9pm on a Saturday night for date and I must say that I really enjoyed this place! Clean and classy atmosphere with a little bit of cozy with the dimmed lighting. Staff was pleasant and attentive. Our meals started off with some fresh warm bread and butter. Very good, the bread had a nice crust but was soft on the inside. 

-Killer French Dip $17: I love a good french dip and this did not disappoint! Excellent portion size and very tasty! (Broth was a little salty, but whatevs)
-Pan Roasted Salmon $22: This was cooked perfectly! I am not usually a fan of salmon, but I had a couple bites of this, the skin was crispy and the inside was moist and delicious especially with that dill butter. The house mashed potatoes tasted like they had some garlic in them which I enjoyed as well. 

Sure this place is a little pricey, but it's also fancier and I think a great spot for a nice date night with your loved one (or booty call, no judgment here, everyone has to eat). I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I tried the tofu, I've never had tofu before. The way they prepared it was surprisingly good. Love love love the atmosphere here.  Fun bar, attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews but my first experience there wasn't a great one. The place is beautiful and I had such high expectations for this place only to be disappointed. We arrived at 7pm on a calm Wednesday night and did not end up leaving till past 9pm. The service was terribly slow. I mean, I've never experienced such slow service. It took over 30 minutes just to place an order for our food. 

Speaking of the food, I ordered the sirloin (cost is $25) and I'm being honest when I say this - Outback Steakhouse has better steak than this place. Their sirloin was dry and very bland. My friend had the ribs and they were very over seasoned/sauced. 

One good thing I will say was that their creamy chicken soup was delicious. Other than that, this place was not worth the money."}
{"text":"Visited Rosewood for the first time.  Ordered fish and chips.  Out.  Ordered french dip sandwich.  Didn't have that, either.  Ordered iced tea, asked for sugar.  Waited forever to get it (my husband even finally tried to find some himself for me).  From how busy the parking lot of this restaurant often is, I was disappointed.  How can you be out of so many items on the menu?  The food we did find that we could order was fine.  Long wait to receive basic items ordered - burger, soup, salad.  And the restaurant wasn't even that crowded when we were there!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite restaurants in Hudson! Everything I have ever eaten from this place has been way above par! But please.... Please bring the scallops back !! They're sooooo good."}
{"text":"This establishment has been one of my \"go to\" places in Strongsville for a while. Usually business lunches or dinners, but I take out of town guests there as well. I must say that the last 2 dinners I've hosted there have been disappointing. Good service, but the the drinks seemed down-sized and the food pretty mediocre. The menu is getting tired. Time to up your game."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Rosewood Grille but my first review. We arrived around 5:30, which was a great idea because once we left the place was packed. First off I want to commend whomever designed this gorgeous place. It is beautiful. We arrived a little early before our friends so we grabbed a drink at the bar. Service was quick and courteous.   

Our friends arrived and we were quickly eated. Our server was very good and very nice. I inquired about whether I should get the scallops or walleye and she highly recommended the walleye. Easy enough!  The others got a burger, scallops and a steak salad. Everyone was raving about the food. My walleye was awesome. It came with this awesome chestnut sweet potato puree that was delicious. Drinks were always refilled and once we were near the end of our meal, a manager came over to ask how everything was. Excellent customer service. We all noticed how pleasant everyone seemed. That is very rare in the restaurant business anymore. So kudos to management for being on top of things!

Highly recommend Rosewood Grille. They do have call ahead seating so I recommend using it."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  The martini was great.  I got a simple chicken plate (but a ton of chicken with it), nothing to write home to mom about.  My mom did get the salmon and said it was delicious."}
{"text":"We've had many meals at Rosewood, which I suppose is a review in itself.....that we keep going back. The food is solid, the decor is inviting, and slightly upscale while not being pretentious. We've recently been catching the Happy Hour in the bar which runs till 6pm, great deals on fun and interesting foods for $5-$7 each (pork belly sliders, fried bologna sandwich, panko shrimp with dipping sauce, salads, flatbreads, etc....plus $1 oysters!) and a nice $5 martini. We get a table full of dishes and share.

One other thing, the staff is outstanding. Every server we have had is great, and a few are really special. And the Manager that works Friday nights....she is very efficient, friendly and professional as well."}
{"text":"Loved the food the service was outstanding had the fish and chips the fish was over fried but everyone that went with me their orders looked great."}
{"text":"Amazing experience tonight! Came here for a date night and I couldn't complain about anything even if I wanted to. The bread and butter service was amazing. Started out with the calamari which was fried to perfection with minimal breading. It was a huge portion for the money! The lobster bisque came next and probably couldn't be rivaled by anywhere in cleveland! For my entrée I got the center cut filet and it melted like butter in my mouth! Finished with a beautiful creme brule. We also had 2 drinks a piece...so for less than $130 we had two sailor jerry cocktails, 2 prosecco splits, calamari, 2 cups of lobster bisque, 2 center cut filets, and a creme brule! Cannot beat it anywhere! To top it off, Derrick the bartender was amazing! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Rosewood Grill is one of my usual haunts. It's a great place for apps and drinks. The bartenders are terrific, and the happy hour crowd is usually very fun. I would highly recommend stopping in for happy hour and checking out their appetizer specials menu. The bar could stand for an update on their beer selections though. 

Fur dinner, the entrees, lack invention and the kitchen lacks consistency necessaryto qualify for a higher rating. For their price point, one would expect something a little more \"cheffy\" on the menu. Rosewood does not provide that type of selection. Just what I would call a more or less standard menu. 

In the end, I will continue to take up my stool at the bar, have a couple drinks and enjoy the atmosphere, but I won't be joining them for dinner."}
{"text":"NOT RECOMMENDED 

First of all, if you have any allergies, do not go here. Their menu has nothing but allergen-laden food on it and not easily modified to fit needs. Shellfish, dairy, egg, gluten (me!) and whatever else. It is completely overpriced, boring 'upscale' chain restaurant food.

Our service was very slow. Our waiter was also very shmarmy and pushy. My friend and I did not like his condescending attitude. He was mad because there wasn't anything on the menu we could really order but we each got 2 cocktails, a plain app and a salad, he was just a jerk.

The martini here is really good, so they got an extra star. Go to the bar, order a martini and drive home (in a couple hours lol)"}
{"text":"First, I liked the food, it was quite good. The server on the other hand left a lot to be desired. He made us feel uncomfortable. He was not overtly rude but he was unapologetic for mistakes and acted like we were an inconvenience. A few examples. 

We came in with our three kids and they were pretty well behaved. We ordered chocolate milks for each at the cost of $2.50 a piece. Two of them were not drank because they didn't like the taste. 

We were told that the happy hour specials did not begin until next week and according to other reviews this was not true. 

We had to ask for bread after salads were finished and wondered if we were not supposed to get any based on our meals, however every table who had different servers were given their servings. 

I asked for mayo with my burger and it was acknowledged. After waiting five minutes and watching our waiter serve every other table I decided   Just to eat. I had also ordered a side of lobster mac for the table. When we were done eating the waiter mentioned he forgot to bring lobster mac and he would pack it up for a to-go. No apology again, and we were billed for it. 

My wife said something to the manager on her way out because she couldn't wait to get out of there. I was waiting to pay and she approached me as I prepared to leave and asked for a synopsis in front of the server. Awkward!  She stated please don't give up on us. We won't---but probably going carry out route until they work out their issues"}
{"text":"Food was decent.  I got the ahi tuna salad and my wife got a steak.  My daughter had the lobster Mac and cheese.  service was a bit slow and they totally forgot our salad....oh well she got half the tip i was going to give her.

I will say the decor and atmosphere was 10 out of 10.  little tweeks will get this review to a 5."}
{"text":"Had good service and good food here. The grilled lamb burger was quite good and the toppings were fresh and crisp."}
{"text":"Arrived the afternoon of 7/4 at approximately 1:00 p.m.  We drove right past this initially as it is sort of tucked in a corner of a strip mall, just across from Best Buy.  Restaurant was about half full and my wife and I were seated immediately.  The exterior is nice, but the inside is beautiful and comfortable. Just the right amount of open space with dimmed lighting made for a nice lunch.  Lots outside dining options were available as well.  The manager, I presume, was very active in the restaurant in personally bringing our food to our table, and in wishing us a good day on our departure.  Our waiter was also very good.

I had the blue cod fish sandwich and fries.  My wife chose the grilled chicken sandwich and a salad.  We also split a bowl of baked potato soup.  My fries had a good texture, but I thought they had an old oil flavor.  My fish sandwich was good, but not great. I did finish the entire sandwich - which was quite large - but wasn't blown away.  To be fair I am very picky and did not get many condiments on my sandwich.  The baked potato soup, however, was very good.  Don't even get me started on the fresh bread with sweet cream butter.  I was told that Breadsmith in Lakewood makes this for Rosewood Grill daily.  This bread was the highlight of the meal - it's that good.  My wife's chicken sandwich was very good, but she did not care for the salad.  She also loved the baked potato soup and bread.  

We did not feel very good after eating here, but I SUSPECT (not sure) this was due to one of two things:  1) I'm thinking maybe there is bacon grease in the baked potato soup.  I can be sensitive to pork and so is my wife.  A little bacon in the soup shouldn't have caused a problem, so bacon grease in the soup might have been the issue.  No problem with the food - I think this was just something with me and my wife.  2) Maybe this establishment uses cooking oil with trans-fat?  Once again, this is something we are sensitive to and it would be more of problem with us, and not the restaurant.    

So I would give the food a 3/5, the service 5/5, and the atmosphere a 5/5.  I would definitely give Rosewood Grill another try."}
{"text":"I've been to Rosewood Grill twice now.  The service is friendly and quick and the food is good, but it is definitely not worth what they charge!  

We wouldn't have chosen this restaurant on our own.  The first time we went a few months ago was for a birthday dinner with friends and our most recent trip was because we got a gift card for Christmas. 

Considering I dislike anything seafood, the menu doesn't have a ton of options.  We had $75 to spend so my husband and I both got appetizers.  These are definitely not portions you could share!  My husband got the pork belly and said it was pretty good but it was literally like a 2 inch rectangle.  I got the buffalo chicken spring rolls since that was pretty much the only other non seafood option.  They were good but $9 for 2 spring rolls filled with buffalo chicken dip?  Just seemed way was overpriced.  Even the server commented that their appetizer portions were pretty small.

Our meals were good, my husband had the French dip and liked it.  I had the Brie and mushroom flatbread.  It was also pretty good but like I said, the prices are pretty outrageous for what you get.  

I would go back, if I had another gift card but not if I'm paying."}
{"text":"I am in the area for business occasionally and a friend recommended that I try Rosewood Grill. I really liked the ambiance. Upscale, but relaxed. I decided to sit at the bar and people watch. Kimberly was my bartender and served me as well. She greeted me with a smile and asked if I'd like to see the drinks list. I asked if she had any recommendations and she told me to try the Rosewood Cosmo. It was delicious! Next I ordered the stuffed rainbow trout. So good! The place was very busy, but my order came out promptly and the service was great. Kimberly was engaging and made me feel at home. Next time I will save room for the chocolate \"moose.\" I will be back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Overall very bland.  Lacking any sort of defining flavor or direction. Unsophisticated for the impressive kitchen. Completely disappointing.  Salt and pepper are pretty basic seasonings and appeared unused.  Risotto base had flavor and consistency of hospital grade oatmeal."}
{"text":"Driving through quaint, adorable Hudson we decided to stop and try this restaurant.  SO GLAD we did. Not only was the food delicious, but the waitstaff was so attentive and we had no less than THREE people come to our table to be sure our food was good. Where do you find that?  You're lucky if anyone ever asks you if your food is OK these days@   It was perfect. 

 Food is delicious, the decor is really cool, with a hip, vibrant bar area as well as wonderful, romantic other seating in different rooms.   The food was delicious, the ambiance just perfect and you can go there dressed in just about anything yet feel comfortable.  I highly recommend this great find!"}
{"text":"Do you remember when you were a kid, you'd wait all summer to go to the amusement park? You couldn't wait to go! Then, you get there, half the day is swelteringly hot, the other half is pouring rain, you wait in line for two hours for the newest roller coaster then get told that it broke down right before it's your turn to ride? That's kind of what our experience was tonight at the Rosewood Grill. Now, I don't want to totally bury a place because of just one meal. We've been before, and it's been wonderful. We've even recommended it to other people to try. And if just what I ordered had been kind of, eh, I wouldn't have written the review. Same with my wife's meal. But literally everything we ordered tonight was subpar. Tonight was going to be somewhat of a special night for us. My wife gave birth to our son a while ago, and this was the night we finally had everything line up with a sitter, and we decided for our date night we were going to go someplace that we don't usually go, but someplace we were sure to get a good meal.  So we get to the restaurant, are seated, and the waiter brings bread with our beverages. Great bread. Delicious even! Sadly, that's the best thing we had. We started off with the blue crab and spinach dip. It was served with some kind of pita toast points. The dip came out in a large crock with the pita fanned around it. The spinach dip itself tasted pretty bland, but the crab, oh the crab was just awful! Super fishy tasting, and devoid of any kind of texture. It was odd. I'm guessing a restaurant like this wouldn't use canned crab, but that's what it reminded me of. Ok, strike one. It happens. So we order our entrees. My wife ordered the Chicken Anna, which is a breaded chicken cutlet with lemon caper linguine. I ordered the Killer French Dip. With hers, my wife also ordered the lobster bisque. The soup comes first, and the very first thing my wife says when she tries it is it just tastes weird. Not bad, just weird. Like straight up cooking wine. So I try it, and I agree. Not a bad taste, just not what I expected. Keep in mind, we've had this on other occasions and have liked it a lot, enough to order it again. This just tasted different. Entrees come out, and they looked good. We were excited to move on from our less than stellar start. My wife tried hers, and made a face. I asked what was wrong, and she said she may have just misunderstood the description of the dish. Hers tasted like someone made a chicken and pasta dish, then squeezed a lemon over the whole thing. No sauce so to speak, just lemon juice. And maybe we did misunderstand what it was supposed to be, but I doubt most people would want chicken and pasta that was that sour tasting. The only thing killer about the French dip tonight was what it is doing to me on account of my now sky high blood pressure. I had a bite of the sandwich on its own first, and it was pretty salty. Then I dipped it in the au jus, and it was even more salty. The saving grace for the sandwich was that the meat itself was pretty tender, the bread it was served on was good. Beyond that, pure salt. I put the horseradish sauce on it, ate some more, couldn't tell there was a sauce or even cheese on it for that matter. Just straight beef and salt.The fries were good though, no complaints there. Just a crappy first night out together in a while though. So, after all that, I'm going to rate it three stars. Why? Because everyone has a bad night in the kitchen sometimes. It happens. And I think the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. I've had way more good meals than bad here. If the next time we come isn't better though, we won't be back again."}
{"text":"i'm not sure why the rating is so high, perhaps this is the best that strongsville/cleveland has to offer as far as mid-priced restaurants are concerned, i don't know. we had to wait for effing ever to get into this place, which is totally ridiculous. the atmosphere, decore is really nice and upscale in appearance. but after waiting 30 minutes they seated us in the section that is used as outdoor seating in the summer, basically no heat gets to that room so they use heat lamps, GREAT, except you know, it's cleveland and it feels like an igloo. so it was cold, whatever, the service was sub par, wasn't great wasn't terrible. the food was also kind of blah, boring. we started off with calamari, which was probably my favorite thing about the whole experience, the sauces that came with the calamari were really good and complimented it really well. i got a filet and it was undercooked to begin with, meh. they heated it a tad more and it was fine. the taste was ok overall, but i'm still not inclined to give a better rating, the taste was very average. the prices are so so, so i guess that's what you get, but i think this place could do so much better, just look how much effort they put into the decore, now try and be that creative with the menu and this place would be a real winner."}
{"text":"The Lobster Bisque was wonderful, and so was the bread and honey butter.  My hubby and I both had the cornflake encrusted tilapia (very bland, but decent), which came with rice and lobster chunks (good), and julienne vegetables. 

We had a 20 minute wait at the bar for our table which must have been a staffing issue since so many open tables inside and out were visible.  The bartender was inept, over charging me and keeping me waiting 10 minutes to pay for a $5 drink (she charged me $9) after my husband was seated at our table.  And by keeping me waiting, I mean she opened a bottle of wine to sit it on the side bar and helped a guy who was deciding what to order, and then accepted his payment for his drink before collecting my payment for the bill she left when our pager went off. Clueless.  

I'd add a review of the deviled eggs we ordered, but they arrived when we were halfway through our dinner. I asked for them to go. We were charged for them.  All in all, this spot is probably a 2-1/2 stars, but the server was bubbly, so I gave them a 3. No way I'd come back."}
{"text":"Had the spinach crab dip. That was very bland.
The oysters were good tasting, but I had to ask for the sauce, lemon and Tabasco.
Otherwise, the service was very food.

The ambience was classy and upscale"}
{"text":"This has become one of our \"fall back\" restaurants when we don't have particular plans and want to make sure that we have a good meal. It is really tough to beat. Everything from my previous review still stands but that call ahead seating is starting to get a bit agrivating on weekends. They really need to monitor it a little better. Still pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"5 out of 5 Stars always a good price five star food at extremely reasonable prices I recommend the deviled eggs"}
{"text":"What a gem in such a strange location lol

Atmosphere is awesome, great patio with a LARGE fire pit! Def going to have to come back once it gets a little warmer!

Came here with a gf of mine on a thursday night. It was surprisingly crowded (i suggest getting resi's). We sat at the long communal table waiting for a seat but opted to just stay in the bar area and catch up. 

Drinks:I'll say the martini's are soooooooooooooooooo small. Def a disappointment. The beer selection is okay, no summer shandy :(

Food: They have only like 4 app's which stinks! GET MORE!
I was having a hard time choosing btwn the fish tacos or the walleye. Went with the Wally over sweet potato puree- ammmmmmmazing! It was crusted in a sweet flakeyness of goodness! TOTALLY recommend it! 
My friend got the steak n shroom's salad and loved it. Let's just say we were apart of the clean-your-plate club! 

I will def be coming back- would love to dine outside!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good drinks, Bartender was great but when moved to table service was not good and food was ok"}
{"text":"Anniversary dinner with my wife and kids. 
Great experience. 
Colin was a great waiter. 
Dinner was great.  
Lobster mac and cheese great. 
Rainbow trout great. 
Calamari great."}
{"text":"This was our first time there. Our waitress. An older dark haired woman, was not friendly at all. It seemed as though we were bothering her every step of the process of our meal. She was pushy, rude, and lacked serious customer service skills. My Strip Steak ($36.00), was cooked perfectly but it lacked flavor. The type of meat I thin needed a marinade or something else on it. The Calamari was good. This would have gotten at least 3 stars if the service was good. This was a waste of a $100.00 meal. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Our waitress, Jasmine was attentive and knowledgeable.  The drinks, appetizers, salads and main course were spaced out perfectly.  Great bread, served warm with a little sea salt on the lightly buttered crust brought out the flavor.  Crab and spinach appetizer was equally good.  We shared a wedge salad and was enough that neither of us  finished our half.  Main course had wonderful presentation, but was light on flavor.  We each had filet cooked medium.  Wife had 7-8 oz filet.  Needed salt.  Cooked perfectly inside but was burned on outside which didn't add to the flavor.  Mashed potato side was excellent, but asparagus was too big, limp, not very green (dull in color). I had the twin filet medallions topped with bernaise  and a little blue crab with Szechuan green beans and potato cakes.  Again, beautiful presentation.  Beans were packed with flavor and I devoured them.  I had to dip the steak in the bean sauce to enjoy it though.  All around great experience and I would recommend it, but they should take some tips from their sister restaurants(Cabin Club, Delmonico's, etc.) to improve seasoning of the steaks."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed my meal here. Called ahead for seating, it was worth it as it was a Saturday and the place was packed. Wait staff was very attentive, food was great! I'd come back again."}
{"text":"This place was solid and the service made up for the fact that the buffalo chicken rolls were super salty and not so great."}
{"text":"For an establishment that presents itself, and charges, for a higher quality of service, this experience was disappointing. If you're going to offer the evening special options, then make certain that all of them are available. Rather than returning to the table when your party is ready to order only to find out that the the one you prefer is unavailable to being short on stock. The next choice was also disappointing. I settled on the prime rib which unfortunately was very dry as shown in the photo. It's a good thing they offered both options to mask the dryness. It's a good thing they have a decent drink selection."}
{"text":"I've been to Rosewood Grill several times; the food and service are always terrific. Items are fresh and appealing, atmosphere is comfortable, the menu has a wide variety of choices, but isn't overwhelming.  Glad this option is available after a long day of brain drain."}
{"text":"I've been there over 10 times and love it here. Here are a few tips to make this place worth your while:
1. If you go on a Tuesday at 5pm, it will be dead
2. If you walk in at 7pm on a Saturday, it will be packed, they wont be able to seat you, and you will be mad. 
3. They DONT take reservations, but DO  call ahead seating, day of. Call after 9am
4. On the very off chance that a staff member is rude, ask for the manager, Chris, he's a great guy and does not put up with that, seriously, let him know.
5. If you like craft beer, order the Thirsty Dog Rosewood Red that's made just for them, it great. 
6. When in doubt, order a burger
7. If you know what you want, don't order that, order a burger
8. If you don't eat burgers, start, then order a burger.
9. Seriously, if you go there and don't get a burger, you are SERIOUSLY missing out, I wouldn't lie to you
10. I highly recommend the appetizer flat breads too. Im more or less adding this in to have 10 points. I cant bear to leave it at just 9, Im too Type A for that. Rustic Italian is my favorite of the flatbreads. Yummo!"}
{"text":"I took my friend here for his birthday. In the beginning I was a little annoyed because I called ahead to make reservations and was never asked if I had one just told to sit and they would be with us in awhile. In the meantime someone came in and ended up being sitted before us. However the food and drinks were very good. Service was great. After I mentioned that it was a birthday dinner when server was bringing the check he had us wait while he went to get a fabulous browine with ice cream. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"The food was just okay.. For the price you want great food! The restaurant is beautiful and a great patio! I would suggest drinks here but dinner elsewhere..."}
{"text":"This was a first time visit for us and we really liked the atmosphere.   It was so cold outside and the warmth of the restaurant was very inviting.  Our server was attentive, quick, and personable.

I had the chicken tortilla soup which was just ok.   Loads of chicken, but that was pretty much it.  I ordered the salmon entree which was served with mashed potatoes and julienne Veges.  The salmon was fantastic.  It was full of flavor and cooked to perfection.   There were so many mashed potatoes I couldn't eat them all.   I also had a glass of Malbec which was fine, but a very small pour.

The menu is a bit funky, with everything from flat breads and burgers to steak and lobster.   

One perk I forgot to mention is that all the food was served hot.   I have a real issue with food sitting in kitchens, but that certainly wasn't the issue here."}
{"text":"I had the halibut and it was served with risotto with plums and goat cheese. It was $30 and the special. It is a bit pricey and the service is stuffy. We hit the patio and enjoyed the fire before we left.  This is basically a steak joint. Some of the waiters are a bit snobby.  Steaks are $35. Wine and beer menu is nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here today for a late lunch.  The atmosphere was decent; good lighting, colors, and music.  However, our hostess seemed a bit high-nosed and barely serviced us at all. There was only one other table she had and after serving us water, she left for a good 15-20 minutes, not asking about appetizers or anything before dropping of the water.  When the appetizers arrived, the flavors were less than par to what I could have made at home.  The potatoes were particularly flavorless.  When bringing our entrees, I was asked if I wanted cracked pepper, which I did. The server then rotated it all over my plate and my lap, and then left with no apology.  Not once through the meal did she return and then she finally arrived with another server and told us that this server would be replacing her. We were never checked on by this server, who also had only one other table. In fact, we waited roughly 20 minutes for her to check on us after we had finished eating.  My meal was a steak salad that was bitter and flavorless, save the sweet peppers.  My wife's dish, the chicken Alfredo, however, was flawless in flavor.  Overall, the food was not that great and the service was terrible. Will never go back."}
{"text":"What an exceptional experience!   Upon arrival for our anniversary dinner we were immediately greeted by a friendly host staff who had previously taken our reservation.   We were kindly escorted to our table which was a uggested by the host via phone reservation.   It was perfect.   View of the dining room was beautiful and full of historic charm!   Our server Emily was at our table within seconds and presented us with a plentiful wine and drink menu along with a spot on detail of specials and recommendations.

Glasses were never left empty, we were offered more bread twice though the portion was plenty, and checked on by her and three others numerous times while not once seeming intrusive.   Our sommelier presented and poured with precision.   

First plate was fun and not what we expected.  We definitely recommend the \"Pig and waffles\".
Main courses included the Sea Scallop special with risotto and the Short Rib with potato cakes.   Excellent all around save the amount of fat I did not specifically expect.   The crust was perfect though on the beef.   

After dinner we were presented with a delicious brownie ala mode with a candle to celebrate our special evening.  

Only one negative that was a simple oversight, we took half our bottle of wine with us and the staff did not properly Secure the cork and it spilled in the car.   Their saving grace was the water tight sealed bag it was placed in for transport though the wine could not be recovered.  

All things considered, 5STARS!  

Make the trip, go during busy hours and make reservations!  The atmosphere is perfect!   Take friends, family, even enemies, as it will surely be a night to remember and heal any wound.   
Thank you to the staff for a great experience."}
{"text":"Service was good, got seated immediately, but fish was very dry and my wife's wedge salad with chicken, the chicken wasn't cooked and tasted funny. Two stars only for service and getting seated. Would have expected much more at this price! BUT they did the right thing and took one of our meals off. And the lobster bisque was vey good."}
{"text":"First time there...we Had happy hour selections, duck wings....very salty thick soy sauce....lobster Mac n cheese bites...lobster? Hmm okay....also buffalo chicken bites which were good. We will not be returning as the level of comfort was horrible, the assumptions and racist attitude was not appreciated. Surprised at the level of service. Given the location and other options available service makes the experience. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on a Wednesday. Wasn't crowded. Bar tenders were horrible. Had to ask for another drink since they were messing around. Appetizer took 30 min to come out and was average at best. Calamari tasted like oil hadn't been changed in some time.  After being served our salad I asked for a side of dressing because the salad had not been tossed well. 15 min later the bartender went back and had the second bartender bring it out. 1st and last time...ps, shouldn't have to ask to have the Cavs game on either. You are in Cleveland ya goofs.. Almost forgot the best part , the $15 salmon salad had goldfish crackers in it... On purpose. Assuming Cisco miss picked them and they decided to use it . Morons"}
{"text":"One of our go to restaurants!  Always good food and service!  The atmosphere is spot on!  The Caesar Salad with Salmon is always perfection as are their flatbread pizzas.  The bar is a great place to meet friends, after work.  The outdoor fire pit is perfect on a cool fall night!"}
{"text":"A little over priced for the bland menu. Walked in on a Monday night and the place was pretty empty. It took some time for our server to stop over. Ordered the Buffalo Chicken Egg rolls for an app which were probably my favorite part of the meal they came out with a side of ranch and the spoon had fallen into the dip on the way over to the table but the server didn't seem to notice nor get us another utensil. Salads are decently sized. Had \"The Titanic Wedge\" says it comes with thousand island dressing but came out with blue cheese...Server explained to us you only get the thousand island when you make it \"Louis Style\" menu was confusing..... Dinner was okay nothing special I ordered the Chicken Anna kind of reminded me of something you would order at Olive Garden. Our server never came back to check on us after the meals were dropped and she seemed to disappear for a while when we had to track her down to get our checks."}
{"text":"Favorite place in town.  Quality ingredients and exceptional service.  Happy hour deals are nice too."}
{"text":"Well, disappointed today. This used to be one of my favorite places. It's beautiful inside.  But, the menu has gotten gradually worse over the year. I couldn't find anything I wanted to eat in the menu, which is overstuffed with weird fish dishes. The lobster bisque was excellent as usual, but it's not enough to bring me back at these prices. The service was subpar.  Several bad experiences in a row, need to go elsewhere now"}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary and it was amazing!  The service was fantastic, the food even better (ordered filet mignon medium rare with garlic mashed potatoes).  We even got a free dessert!  I would recommend the Riesling, and the iceberg chop with thousand island. 

Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"We went as a last minute idea so no reservations but we were seated fairly quickly. Bread was fantastic from Blackbird Bakery in Lakewood. We ordered the deviled eggs as an app and they were just \"ok.\" The presentation made them awkward to eat as the toast was very hard and the egg was tall sitting on top. My husband had the walleye (dry, flavorless and overcooked) while I had the pork chop (arrived rare, not medium as requested.) I sent it back and then after tasting it, the pork was unfortunately again, just \"ok.\" The very friendly waitress offered a brownie dessert from the kitchen when our check arrived as a goodwill gesture for under cooking the pork. Just finished the brownie with sauce at home, and it was inedible. We may try going here again to see if the just had an \"off\" night, but we won't be in any hurry to do so."}
{"text":"Staff was attentive and helpful. Very laid back atmosphere even on Mother's Day. We never felt pressured to finish up and move on. Lobster bisque was amazing. Sushi Shots were tasty. Scallop entree was delicious. Filet was cooked perfectly to order and the garlic spinach had great bite. The creme brûlée is to die for and the mousse is light and airy. All together a wonderful Mother's Day dining experience!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Rosewood during happy hour, so keep that in mind.  However, I loved Rosewood! It's a fun, classy place to go with some of my friends and get high quality drinks for cheap (5$ a drink).  Plus, they're 5$ appetizers are delicious and perfect when you want something light to eat.  

It is a little classier, but I think it's a nice change of pace from just a regular sports bar happy hour.  The service is incredibly friendly and helpful, and willing to recommend different menu items as well as drinks.  

If you're in town or looking for a new happy hour place, you must try Rosewood!"}
{"text":"The kind of restaurant that thrives in Hudson based on the premise that the more you charge, the better the food. Too many ingredients in menu items make everything taste weird. Just awful."}
{"text":"Went to the Rosewood (former Inn at Turner's Mill) for the first time last night!  

First off I would like to say this place gets an A for friendly service and a nice atmosphere. We were seated by the hostess immediately. Our server had many suggestions for us and was able to answer all of our questions about the menu.  We sat on the patio which, although the only thing it overlooks is the parking lot, is surrounded by some nice landscaping and has a fire pit where we sat and drank our coffee after dinner.  The interior of the restaurant was also visually very nice.  

As for the food itself, well, it was pretty underwhelming.  The salad I ordered to start was good, just a simple house salad with spring mix, cucumbers, vinaigrette, mozzarella cheese and a few croutons. 

I was excited to see that there were a lot of seafood dishes on the menu, and I ended up ordering the special which was a white fish (forget which variety) in a sesame seed marinade, a small bed of arugula and frisee topped by some crab salad, and steamed baby bok choy.  The fish was a nice texture but overall pretty flavorless even with the marinade. The bok choy was served whole, without any type of sauce, seasoning, etc. and it was completely overcooked to the point of being mushy and stringy.  It was very hard to cut due to the mushy, stringy texture, got cold quickly, and was generally not very appetizing. I truly love bok choy and the baby bok choy was the reason I ordered the special!  I think it would have been much better had it been cooked a lot less and then drizzled with a sauce of some type to complement the flavors in the fish.  The little bed of leaves with crab salad was pretty nice although it seemed a bit disjointed from the rest of the meal in terms of flavor.

For dessert I had creme brulee and coffee.  The creme brulee was very good, you really can't go wrong by ordering that.  The coffee was also good and our waitress came by to give us a warm up pretty quickly too.   

My dad got the caesar salad, the trout from the regular menu, and the creme brulee also.  He also said his meal was just okay.  His was served with the fish cut in half, and then risotto was placed in the middle of the two halves.  This caused the fish to cool off more quickly, and also made the plate look a mess with just a pile of food. 

Overall, I would give this place an A for prompt and friendly service, an A for atmosphere, and a C- for the food.  Given the former, and the fact that this is one of the few places in town open past 9pm, I will probably be back at some point to try a drink and one of their flatbreads or sandwiches."}
{"text":"Overall: 4 Stars.  Great food, very nice space, decent service.

Food: 5 Stars.  The twin filet special was cooked perfectly.  Lobster bisque was very good.

Service: 3 Stars.  The server wasn't to be found for 20 minutes as we wanted our check.  We would have ordered more drinks too.  Also, they threw away a dish of our food when we wanted to box it up.  They did remake it though free.

Environment: 4 Stars.  Fireplace outdoor is amazing.  Indoor is comfortable."}
{"text":"The food was much less appealing than described on the menu.  I ordered a sea bass special, and my husband ordered the lobster bisque and a medium steak. My sea bass was bland and had a not-so-fresh-fishy taste. My husband enjoyed his bisque but the steak was served rare. His steak was served with \"frites\" which looked much more like the potato sticks you used to be able to buy in a canister.  Neither of us could bear to finish our meal and we will definitely not be heading back."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Nice, unique atmosphere.  Still getting the pace down, but this group knows what they are doing.  A nice addition to Strongsville."}
{"text":"While in town for work, I had checked out local restaurants and this grabbed my attention - the menu sounded phenomenal. 

So after I had checked into my hotel, I made my reservation and headed over there for, what I hoped for, a great meal.

I am normally not a huge steak person, but it was calling to me so I ordered the center cut filet mignon which came with mashed potatoes, asparagus in a Cabernet Sauvignon Demi-glacé. 

When it was placed in front of me I knew I had the right decision. WOW! Ordered it medium and it was perfectly done. My waiter, Daniel, was great and he was pleased that I was in steak heaven.

Love the ambience of this place and definitely plan on coming back next time I'm in town...yum!"}
{"text":"Wish I would have had a better experience but the food was just very disappointing. The service was good but a little over the top, I would have preferred if our waiter only stopped by a few times through out the night, he checked on us every 5 minutes. He also gave us long schpeels at least 4 times about the food, wine, apps, cocktails, specials, healthier options, etc. 

We started out with the blue crap spinach dip and when we tried it it was very fishy tasting, which is not usual for crab. After one bite each my friend and I couldn't eat it. We explained and apologized to the waiter and told him it didn't taste right. I had the blackened cod fish tacos and it was a large portion but it didn't taste fresh. The cod was sort of rubbery and I regret ordering seafood. 

Also knowing that this is a chain restaurant makes me worry that they are all bad. They are trying hard but things just don't work. Would not recommend this spot."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here.  Everything was excellent. I had baby back ribs, and my wife had the beef au jus sandwich. It is a beautiful place, and our server Latoya was helpful and attentive.  We will be back."}
{"text":"We love this place! Great restaurant for special occasions or cocktail hour after work. Everything from the drinks, the food, the service, and the atmosphere are all very high-end and classy. We ordered the lobster wontons as an app, and I guess they left them in a little too long. The manager, Devin, came over with the original app, apologized and later brought us fresh ones.  (We wouldn't have noticed a difference.) Lobster Mac & Cheese is a must-have. The salmon filet salad was AMAZING. They also were very accommodating to special food requests. Perfect for date night."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by how good this was. After reading other reviews I was expecting it to be on par with Outback but find I liked it much more. Steak seems to be the specialty and three of us had steak (thee different dishes) while one had Salmon. All of us thoroughly enjoyed the meals and I felt the price was very good. Under $90 with tip for two complete meals with one drink and dessert seemed cheap for the quality of our meals. I will return without hesitation. I will note that this was a Thursday and by the time we left it seemed very full - so I advise calling ahead."}
{"text":"The Lobster Bisque and the crime brûlée were outstanding! Unfortunately most of the entrees (ranging from steak to scallops) were way too salty. The staff was very helpful and attentive, considerably better than average."}
{"text":"Hit this place up with my wife, kids and parents.  Everybody enjoyed the atmosphere and their meals.  I had the Rainbow Trout entree that was recommended by our server-  I'm glad I asked, it was great!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food at reasonable prices in a noisy atmosphere.  Our server, Latesha was knowledgeable, friendly and added to the enjoyment of our meal."}
{"text":"Great food that was ruined by inexcusably bad service! We came here for my birthday dinner and were so disappointed by the experience, especially since we've loved our times at the Hudson location. We were our waitresses' only table on a Tuesday night at 8:30pm and she still couldn't be bothered to come by for over 10 minutes after we were seated. Julie seemed annoyed, disinterested, and lacking any tact. Our water glasses were left empty and the food arrived cold. The final straw was when we waited over 20 minutes to get our check. We will make the drive to Hudson next time!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this restaurant has broken my heart! Used to be our favorite place for anniversaries and birthdays, but this place has gone downhill so fast. Staff is untrained (spilled au jus onto my plate and lap!) and the menu is so tacky and generic now. Just lacking professionalism all around, and the clientele is changing now too.

This, plus the price increases (across the board) and food quality that has gotten so bad (gristly sirloin, lukewarm prime rib, limp salad, awful burnt sides) are just so tragic given how spot on it once was. Bread is DENSE now too - super cheaply made, you can tell it's not what they used to serve. 

Avoid! We will remember the OLD rosewood grill, with unique bacon fat drinks and creative apps, fondly, but this is not it."}
{"text":"First time here! Was there for my son's birthday dinner.  Service was okay; until the food arrived! Everyone was okay; until my daughter and youngest granddaughter, got the same meals, the ribs. The meat looked like it was not a good choice of meat, sitting to long? When asked for manager, she came in and my daughter explain then it wasn't appealing. Sauce tasted funny; was bought to our attention that, was cooked with sauce added while cooking! Got another ribs; looked like not right? Once again not a good choice of meat, with this time sauce on the side. Was it the timing of the day? Close to closing, that the experience  was being like rush to end the day? My food was okay, applible to being able to chew it;Prime Rib, but once again, not a good  choice of meat."}
{"text":"I've had nothing but good experiences here. The food is good and the staff is attentive. Lobster bisque is great and so is the lobster mac'n'cheese."}
{"text":"Comin' up Roses

I hemmed and has about coming here because there were a few other places I wanted to try as well but we finally decided on RG. What a great decision!

Service-good and sufficiently attentive. Very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The only irk was that manager was going from table to table to check in with patrons and went to table next to us twice and never asked us. This type of thing always bugs me. If you're going to do it, be consistent. 

Food-reeeeaaallly good! We had calamari appetizer which was light and crunchy (loved the added pepper rings and the sauce) and I had the Chicken Anna - similar to chicken piccata. 10 out of 10! The sauce was addictive and portion was very generous. My colleague had the lobster flatbread and raved about how delicious it was. See my photos.

The atmosphere/ambience is nice. Tasteful without being stuffy. 

Bottom line: would I make a point to go there again? For sure! The next time in visiting the area I will definitely make a special trip!"}
{"text":"We popped in for dinner at this great new place, owned by the same group that owns Cabin Club & Salmon Daves. This is located across the street from Crocker Park, in the old Applebee's location. They did a great job making over the interior! The atmosphere was great, and our server was even better. Jen was funny, knowledgeable and was right there whenever we needed her.

The food was tasty, but there were not a lot of options for us vegan types. The veggie burger tasted great, and came with a side salad. My husband enjoyed his filet, that was cooked perfectly to his liking. 

There's a nice drink selection & an awesome happy hour. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We love the rosewood in strongsville and were so excited to see one opened a mile from us in westlake!!! Great decor, great food!! The cheesy potatoes that came with the steak were phenomenal!!!! My sister said the flatbread was one of her favorite meals ever. Pleased with our experience at Rosewood :) very reasonably priced for the quality of food."}
{"text":"High end restaurant! I had the pork chop, husband had salmon excellent. We ordered pork belly could have been hotter but very tasty! Great for a special occasion! 2 people 2  appetizers 3 drinks 2 Aintree 1 salad 114.00 with tip."}
{"text":"The service was good and the food was very good as well. I enjoyed my meal but wouldn't call it \"the best ever.\" Many of the reviews raved about the lobster bisque, and while it was good, the lobster bisque at Zoup is better and cheaper. In addition, I had the lobster pasta. It was tasty but didn't seem to have much lobster in it. My husband had the flatbread of the day and said it was a four star also. Wine here is pricey for what you get. I google one of the \"special limited time\"bottles and discovered it for less than half what was being charged for the bottle."}
{"text":"We stopped in at the Hudson location for a late lunch while on a camping weekend trip. Yes! Camping.  It is a bit upscale trendy and we were definitely under dressed but they were very accommodating and seated us in the lounge area.  There was a beautiful patio area we could have been in as well, plus the more formal dining room.  Excellent service, attention to detail and a high class fashioned dining experience without being stuffy or over priced.  
My husband had the Beef Stroganoff Cavatappi.  Perfectly cooked pasta in a rich RICH stroganoff beef gravy with sour cream.  Bits of asparagus laced throughout.  (Mr. doesn't eat veggies even ate some!). My daughter had the Lobster Mac which was a large portion, creamy and loaded with lobster meat.  Delicious.   She also had roasted asparagus on the side. Perfectly done and clearly fresh from the garden.  I had the tuna melt and lobster bisque.  The soup was full of large claw meat, sweet and juicy, with a bit of spice to surprise you. My tuna melt was delish and crafted well. Interesting addition of capers was a pleasant delight. They had several choices of craft beer on tap and full bar service available.  I would definitely visit again, but dress a little nicer next time!"}
{"text":"Had dinner Friday night. Very disappointed.  The drinks were horrible.  Our waitress was board line rude. They gave our table away. Gave us the wrong menu and the food was marginal.  The outdoor fireplace was the highlight. I would bypass this restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Best calamari I've ever had. The bread is some of the best around. I got the sirloin, the steak was good and the sides of spinach and potatoes were amazing as well. Really nice splurge restaurant. The service was excellent. They don't take reservations but you can call ahead and tell them your expected arrival time to get priority over walk-ins."}
{"text":"First of all, the setting is very cool. The restored building gives an old timey feel with a little modern trendy touch. There is a nice large gas fire on the patio so you can hangout there even when it's a little cold outside. Inside, I love the exposed stone walls, and the lighting was perfect- dark enough to set the mood, but not too dark like some other swanky places seem to do. 

The service was top notch. We had Dan, and he was knowledgeable about the menu, attentive and professional. One of the better waiters we've had in a long time. Some of the other waiters even checked on us a couple times. 

My wife and I both ordered drinks. She loved her Churchill Estates red wine. It came in a wine glass with a rose emblem, which is a nice touch. My Rosewood Red Ale came in a glass with the beers name, which was also a nice touch. 

The complimentary bread was awesome. A nice salty crust and the butter was whipped and had some sweetness to it. I could have dined on the bread alone. 

The French Dip was great. Very tender beef, a nice horseradish dipping sauce and tasty au jus. The bread was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I'd order it again. The shoestring fries were slightly lukewarm, but had a lot of nice flavor. 

The blackened fish tacos looked to die for when they came out. The presentation is wonderful, and the portion is huge. While I thought they were very good, I didn't find them to be great. The coleslaw that comes on the tacos tastes good, but there is so much on there that it tended to take over the dish. The lime cilantro rice on the side was decent, but it left me craving Chipotles rice. 

The highlight of the night was the chocolate moose desert. It was the bomb. It had crushed Oreos in the middle and the presentation to make it look like an actual moose."}
{"text":"The lobster bisque- omg the lobster bisque. I've had recurring dreams taking me back to the magical experience I had discovering it! Excited to go back and try more of their menu and possibly some desserts!"}
{"text":"Good food but a bit overpriced for what it is. The food is tasty and well presented, but for that price I expected much more. Maybe it is the location. It is hard to think fine dining when your location is the end building of a strip mall. The décor is modern, clean and crisp, very New York. We went with another couple to celebrate a birthday and had friendly service. The menu had creative options, but we had to wait a bit for our food. I am sure we will go there again, but it will not be my first choice."}
{"text":"First Time to Rosewood Grille and I must say all of us thought the Food was Delicious and worth the up scale prices. I , my sister and our Mom feel the Service was exceptional, our waiter Scott was attentive and engaging. My mom and I had the Filet Mignon and they were both done to perfection and very flavorful !!! My sister had the grilled Sirloin and her cook was a spot on med. rare ' the sides were equally as good !!! And the food was delivered from the kitchen in a timely manner !! We will tell everyone of the Rosewoods yummy food. And shall return to dine !!"}
{"text":"Nothing special here - a wide menu that feels like it was out together by a restaurant consultant. Items are easy for a kitchen to pull off and neither too imaginative or very flavorful. Tomato soup was standard and came out not very hot. Basic green salad with a bleu cheese that was one dimensional. 

Flat bread loaded with Italian sausage sounded good, but the sausage wasn't all that flavorful and the flatbread wasn't charred or crispy. This is the sort of place that six or eight coworkers can need after work - everyone will find something acceptable, and you won't remember the food a day later. No one will mind the loud talk because it's a loud place. I found the food and decor boring. 

Service was fine."}
{"text":"The experience was made up of mixed results. Arrival was a bit frustrating as even though we had reservations, showed up 20 minutes early, and the restaurant had many open tables, we weren't sat until 30 minutes post our reservation time.  That lead to a very poor consumer experience as a restaurant only gets one chance at a first impression.  The wine list was very impressive and was the highlight of the visit.  The food was very average at best. Our server was very pleasant and on top of all our needs.  At $120 for 2 people, I can think of many restaurants in the area where your money is better spent (DBA, Moe's, or Downtown 140).  This is a place best oriented for drinks and maybe an appetizer."}
{"text":"Yuck! Overpriced bad food...very disappointing! Go to Yard house across the street way better and better value.  What is listed on the menu does not come to your table- definite.issues with the cooks.  Service was great but the only good thing."}
{"text":"Our party of four adults and three children on a Saturday night were warmly welcomed although it was busy. They stored our stroller and shopping bags. Calamari appetizer was enough for four adults and one child.  Bread and herb butter held us off until delicious entrees:  lobster ziti, quinoa and shrimp salad, burger, and flatbreads. Changing table in bathroom. Upscale, trendy, (try house Cosmo) and kid friendly."}
{"text":"AMAZING.  Not only is the food great,  the service with children awesome,  but I mentioned my gluten intolerance in passing regarding how the burgers were made and not only was my burger brought out by the front end manager but she assured me the chef was aware and everything on my plate was safe. Talk about customer service. They have now made customers for life....  I have never been in an establishment that went out of their way to accommodate a \"weird eater\". Thank you staff and chef at Rosewood grill.  A cut above the rest!"}
{"text":"Will never return. 

So we didn't make a reservation on a Saturday night okay our fault (oops) but we didn't mind waiting. What we did mind is that they told us wait would be 30-45 minutes max. Okay again our fault we didn't make a reservation. 40, 50, 60 minutes pass now we are upset because there is a corner table available that NO ONE gets sit at. Ugh. 

One person of our party goes to the hostess desk and asked the host how much longer the wait would be she can see the wait list and two parties of 4 got sat before us, and their name was on the list after us, they skipped us. We were also a group of 4. Okay whatever the food will make up for it. THEN we get sat at the table that was open the entire time we waited. 

Our drink order didn't get taken until 10 minutes after we were sat down. We finally get our appetizers ordered, we ordered the blue crab spinach dip and buffalo rolls, both were good. 

At this point we thought maybe they were just busy and we were making a bigger deal out of this than it needed to be. 

We ordered our dinner, one person ordered filet, another the chicken rice and green beans, another the trout, and an 8 rack of ribs. Food comes to the table and the trout tastes and looks exactly like salmon. The food has ZERO salt. Like none. Zero flavor. The salt and pepper shakers are literally maybe an inch tall  

The steak was not cooked medium rare, the asparagus was not cooked completely, the ribs were covered in so much grainy sesame BBQ sauce I couldn't even eat them  the chicken was SO bland it wasn't enjoyable and the trout was confusable or salmon (shouldn't have two of the same fish on a menu) 

The waitress did the best she could with how many tables she had to assist. She also took the ribs off the order, and brought us a free dessert, we did not say anything when we were there because we literally hated all the entrees for one reason or another and didn't want to cause a scene if I could have managed to eat the ribs I would have but they were not able to be eaten. 

We will never return. Ever. 

We have been to a lot of restaurants my boyfriend and I go out to eat at least twice a week and the price point and service are way to high for this establishment. 

To add icing to the cake the hostess said bye to everyone leaving except us ?"}
{"text":"Very Disappointed! Went for dinner Sunday evening, the service was slow even though the restaurant wasn't overly busy. The food was bland to say the least. We both ordered filet's mine was cooked properly however my wife ordered medium well and was served a rare steak. My wife asked if the mashed potatoes had garlic in them and she wasn't sure. Really??? Needed extra salad dressing but couldn't find our waitress. The food was just \"plain\" I've had much better at a lower cost elsewhere. My wife was very unimpressed with the dessert which is her favorite part of dining out. Let's just say that we will not be returning!!!"}
{"text":"I was here a couple summers ago and thought it was very good!  We went tonight and the best part about our experience was the server and the bread. 

We got the buffalo chicken egg rolls and they were literally buffalo chicken dip you make in your crock pot pot for the Super Bowl. I think it was received pre-made and frozen. 

The lobster soup was very salty.

The arugula spinach salad was not edible. 

I had the Strip Steak and red skin gouda potatoes and the potatoes were very hot, but raw and crunchy inside, not sure how that possible. 

The meat was prepared to order and had zero seasoning. I asked for the blu cheese side and it was dry stale balls of blu cheese. I have never received blu cheese like that for a steak.

Since we didn't eat most of our meal, we got dessert. Ummm, it was bad too! 

What happened to this place?!!!?!? So sad!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new eatery, and decided to check out RG.  All in all, we had a pleasant experience here.  I ordered the shrimp linguini, and the lobster mac n cheese.  Both were fantastic!  The wife and little incubus were also pleased with their dinners.  The only food I didn't much care for was their bread, which was bland and didn't taste too fresh, and their creme brulee, which tasted very good, but was very 'runny' and 'liquidy'.  I wish they would provide an assortment of dinner buns or breads, perhaps pumpernickel, rye, and plain.  The service was also kind of slow for an upscale place.  Lastly, we loved the dining area.  It's nice to see some restaurants still offering booths, instead of just tables in an 'open', cafeteria type atmosphere.  Booths offer a modicum of privacy, and are a lot more comfortable than tables and chairs.  We will most definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a busy Saturday night for an appetizer and drinks.  Waited about 10 minutes before nabbing two seats at the bar.  While hanging around the bar, a server came up and offered to get us a drink while we waited....nice.  At the bar, the server was outstanding, so friendly and accommodating, even with her hands very full with other customers.  Wife had the peach mojito, yummy! and I had the Moscow Mule, good as well.  The app. was the scallops with edamame......so, so good.  Can't wait to go back to have a full meal. (That's the only reason we didn't give it 5 stars.)"}
{"text":"Rosewood Grill is a lovely place with lovely food. I also liked the atmosphere and the server I had was great! Wish I knew her name bless her heart. I definitely would recommend this place to anyone who might be around or going through the area."}
{"text":"My wife and I joined a group of friends who dine out once a month. There were 32 of us in total. We were seated in a private room that was somewhat small for the size of our group.

We were assigned two waitpersons and they were excellent! 

My wife and I each ordered a glass of wine. The pour was below average and as such prevented me from awarding a 5 star rating.

My wife had the chicken tortilla soup and I had the lobster bisque soup. The lobster bisque was excellent. My wife was not impressed with her soup.

I ordered the lobster and pasta (ziti in a white, light cream sauce) and my wife ordered the salmon. We both enjoyed our meal very much.

The total for the meal was $75, which in our opinion, was reasonable given the quality of food and service.

The ribs, sirloin steak and fish tacos were also big hits among our group."}
{"text":"I have been to Rosewood several times. I have had good experiences and just okay experiences. I clearly seem to always return but on my last visit I was extremely turned off. The buffalo chicken egg rolls are absolutely delicious and I don't know anywhere else with anything like them. So I was craving them and stopped up around 4pm. Sat at the bar, there was no one else really in the restaurant. I ordered my egg rolls and didn't see my waitress again until she brought them out. I ate them and enjoyed them, and decided to order a creme brûlée. When it came out it folded like plastic when I stuck my spoon into it instead of cracking like it's supposed to. The waitress took it back to the kitchen and I didn't see her again until she brought it back out to that I told her I wasn't interested in a second one, which she would have known had she come out and checked in with me ever. Very disappointed and I don't think I will return after this."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Rosewood Grill!

My husband and I were looking for a nice and healthy lunch near the Cleveland airport.  I searched via my Yelp app and found this spot.  We were impressed with the upscale atmosphere and were happy to see lots of options on the menu.

Our service was very attentive and was frequently checking in on us to ensure that we were doing ok.  Our drinks were never empty and he gave us many recommendations on the menu.  We both went for the Lunch Trio, which includes soup, salad, and sandwich.  I went for tomato bisque soup, which was very fresh.  I also did the Rosewood salad, and really enjoyed the dressing.  Finally, the roast beef sandwich was filling and had the right mixture of meat and cheese.  This is definitely a good spot to stop for a nicer lunch near the airport."}
{"text":"Rosewood Grill in Strongsville was great!
We went there for the first time May 30th 2014  around 6:15 pm.
Atmosphere was chill and relaxed. 
Cool patio.
Ample parking.
Very clean place.
Extremely pleasant staff.
We started at the bar and I had 2 Rosewood Cosmopolitans they were sooooo good!
We decided to stay for dinner boy am I glad we did....
Once we were seated we ordered the calamari and the sausage flat bread to start... both delicious !
 I'm so happy to fine someone who knows how to make calamari properly!!! the breading was light and flakey but not to much... so good!
At this point we were full but we knew we could take the rest of the order home.
Entrées arrived piping hot and scrumptious! We ordered the lobster ziti and the twin filet. the twin filet came with sweet potatoes ALL WERE AMAZING! 
Our server split it up for us on different plates. 
We feel the prices were very fair and reasonable. 
If you want great food for you hard earned money try this place.
We will be back
Thank you for such great food !!!!"}
{"text":"My friend made reservations for 10 to host a sprinkle (mini baby shower) for our friend who is due in two weeks. They put us in the private party room which was super nice since we were not even expecting that. Our server was awesome; attentive and was aware of social cues as to when we were ready to order more drinks and apps, then dinner. Highly recommend the dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives; best I have had in awhile and I love martinis. The sushi shots are must off the apps list. I got the salmon and it was cooked perfectly, and everyone else in the group had great things to say about the filet, chicken pasta dish, and the blackened shrimp pasta. They brought complimentary desserts which were phenomenal and a big thank you to the manager CK for doing that, as was again, not necessary, but made our friend feel even more special. Looking forward to coming to Rosewood in Strongsville again soon, I love the cozy atmosphere and the wonderful service is the cherry on top!"}
{"text":"We went for our company Christmas party and felt like we were an inconvenience to them. Waiter was good, management rude, food so so. Nothing special I've had just as good burger at Rusty Barrel. Calamari was a soggy mess. My co-worker said the ribs were good. Not worth the price for mediocre food and rude manager."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with my mom, and really enjoyed our food. The waitress was knowledgeable about food allergies on the menu, and helped with suggestions. The manager sat us and checked on us during our meal, which was a nice touch. The only reason I gave 4 stars was because it took an absurd amount of time for our waitress to check us out. We were clearly shopping and took a break for lunch, and wanted to get back to the stores. She never checked on us after dropping the check, and I had to bring it up to her at the hostess stand after waiting so long and not being able to flag her down. In doing so, i thought she'd get the hint we wanted to leave, but then it took another long period of time to bring our check book and card back! A very frustrating end to a good meal."}
{"text":"A good friend and I went here for dinner on a Saturday night.  It was very busy - the parking lot was absolutely packed - but surprisingly, we didn't have to wait.  The food was delicious, and the service was absolutely excellent.  The restaurant itself was very clean and had a cozy, chic atmosphere.  There is an outdoor patio and fire that I can't wait to experience this spring/summer/fall.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Let's start from the beginning
-Called to say we would be 5 minutes late. They said ok that's ok. 
-Arrive. They canceled the reservation
-They find us a table 
-20 minutes later we get a waitress
-4 different times she says she will be back for our order 
-40 minutes after we sit down. Order in
-30 minutes after appetizer order is in. We get it
-1 hour after our food order is in we get it 
-Service among the worst I've ever had 
-Food was on par with a step above Applebee's 
-Don't waste your time here
-Had decent experience at Hudson location"}
{"text":"This is a true Strongsville gem and for me, this is my FAVORITE happy hour in the area. Rosewood grille really sticks out against all of the chain restaurants surrounding South park mall. This is more of an upscale restaurant , with entrees ranging upwards of $20. 

As a college student, what I love about Rosewood and what makes me give this restaurant 5 stars is their amazing happy hour! They offer 4 cocktails for $5 along with wine specials. The best part is the happy hour food they offer burgers, flat breads, calamari, and buffalo chicken spring rolls all for under $6! Happy hour is at the bar from 3-6 Mon-Fri!

I'm always on the search for the best calamari, and theirs ranks in the top 3!

I come here for drinks often, if you see me come say hi!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday (2/13/18) around 12:30pm with colleagues for a business lunch.  Our server was training another server so she was sure to be attentive to our party.  Our glasses stayed full and it felt like she almost memorized the entire menu lol. I know she was trying to make a good impression for her trainee.  This was my first time at the restaurant and I liked the interior.  It is pretty dim inside which lent to a very relaxing atmosphere.  The decor was very welcoming and calming.  

We had fresh bread brought to the table followed by calamari as an appetizers. Both were absolutely delicious.  Then my fish tacos came out and they are literally the best I've ever had.  The fish (which was blackened not fried) itself was just ok, but whatever slaw they had in the taco was divine!  The order consisted of two tacos with generous sized fish pieces.  The dish came with a side of cilantro lime rice that was also just ok.  In addition to that was sides of salsa and guacamole.  The guacamole was nice and fresh.  

Very pleased with the meal and the service. Would definitely bring my husband here one day for a date night."}
{"text":"I attended a FANTASTIC lunchtime party in their private dining room!!  The food was excellent and the service was top notch, especially from the waiter John.  The attentive staff made sure our meal and celebration was just perfect!!!  It couldn't have been better!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing. I took my girlfriend there for Valentines Day, it has absolutely the perfect atmosphere or a date like that.
The staff was great, everyone was nice and our waitress was excellent. She knew the menu very well and was able to make suggestions.
As for the meal I had lobster bisque that was very good and filet medallions that were cooked perfectly and cut like butter.
Overall a great experience and I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there last night for our infrequent \"date night\" and were extremely pleased with the choice. Great ambiance - formal but not stuffy. Service was great. I had the lobster pasta which was phenomenal. My husband was also pleased with his meal. Portion sizes were legs- had lunch left for today The calamari starter was excellent too. Drink menu provided options. All around a great place. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Went in during a business trip to Twinsburg and was very impressed. The menu had a wide array of things that sounded good and I settled on the fish and chips. The fish was excellent and the chips were just like I like them. Prices were pretty good considering the quality of food. 

The service was great, the food came out quickly, and the food was hot. 

The atmosphere was about what I expected, maybe a little quieter. 

When I'm back in the area I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of not having a reservation and heading there on a Saturday night.  We ended up waiting almost a hour and 30 minutes for a seat.  The hostess team that was at the front was beyond incompetent and made the wait that much more annoying.  Despite them, my party stayed and waited to be seated.  Once seated we ordered some appetizers and drinks.  Both came quickly and everything was amazing.  The food is so good at this place; I was with a party of 5; everyone ordered different dishes for dinner; once we were all done inhaling our food, we couldn't stop talking about how good everything tasted.  This might have been because we waited for so long, but I am pretty sure the food was JUST that good.  Make reservations and you should be good!  Hopefully they can figure out the hostess situation...they were really stupid and annoying."}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant. Stopped here off-the-cuff and was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting just another cliché foo-foo eatery in the 'burbs. Turns out, this place was really awesome and welcoming. The food was fabulous minus any foo-foo-ness and the atmosphere appealing. Quasi- classy place. It actually put me in a good mood. I wasn't dressed up, in causal summer attire but still felt comfortable. They let us wait with a drink by the fireplace outside. I could read/pronounce the food menu and I ordered something plain like tilapia dinner and it was perfect.  Nothing over the top trying too hard, it was just yummy. Service was quick. It was very busy though with all seats taken so you def want reservations. We were able to be seated quickly with 2 ppl on a weekend night. Probably not so quick for s table of 4. Recommend this place 100%. Prices were decent too for the the package. Again, pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Went to lunch on Monday for their first lunch with a friend. Service was great. I sat down and our server approached quickly with water and bread. The bread was tasty and warm with soft butter. I ordered the trio with a chicken sandwich, sausage/tortellini soup and wedge salad and everything was delicious. It was prompt and our server Adam was great. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love Rosewood. Probably my favorite restaurant in Hudson next to Downtown 140. Portions are plentiful and delicious. Great selection of wine, beer, and bourbon (they ever carry Woodford Double Oaked). The atmosphere at Rosewood is also special. Want to take someone to a beautiful restaurant where you won't be disappointed? You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I really like what they did with the place. It's very clean and trendy, their fireplace outside is really neat as well. Their menu is really nice as well. Their salmon salad was very delicious and refreshing, however I don't understand the goldfish on it. Our server was very polite and made sure we were taken care of. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"My wife and I have tried this place three times. Every time they have disappointed greatly. Service is always good, but the food is always always a disappointment. Decided third time was the last time. Last time fish tacos were cold and the accompaniment with the dish was disgusting to look at."}
{"text":"Great looking place, good food, fun crowd - can be the place to be and be seen...I'll definitely go back when I'm back in Hudson."}
{"text":"The quality of their food and the technique is always very well done - the atmosphere is great, the servers are kind and attentive, and the only thing I would change on the service end is the front desk as every time we walk in there are 3 young ladies at the front talking to themselves before noticing you, I always like at least a simple hello by the front staff when walking in, especially when there are so many hostesses!

The walleye is always top notch and the specials intriguing as well. The reason for only being a 3 star review though is we just visited in late July and there was still the fall/winter menu, i.e. entrees accompanied with butternut squash, chestnuts, etc. Look, I'm all for those flavors but it was late July....not the flavors I'm shooting for! I love when they, or if they, ever bring back their sweet corn risotto with the walleye but I don't know, maybe they don't start their \"summer\" menu until August .... doesn't make much sense to me, but that's what happens when you get hooked on something and it changes!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Rosewood for the first time tonight. We weren't disappointed. Excellent food, excellent service and beautiful decor. We will definitely be going back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Good steak, ambiance and attentive staff. Oh, and the wine by the glass was super. Just ask the bartender. Well-versed in fine wine."}
{"text":"Location is great, although service is terrible.  I originally contributed it to \"working out the kinks\" for the new location in Westlake.  Having to ask for refills on drinks, hostess was not friendly.  I also called to make a reservation for five.  The hostess informed me that they do not take reservations, and only offer same day call ahead for dinner reservations.  I was ok with that.  I mentioned that I would have a reservation for five next week.  She promptly informed me that they only have one table to accommodate 5 guests so I need to call promptly at 9:00 AM on that day to reserve that table.  Really?  One table to accommodate 5 people?  I asked if she could accommodate us at a larger table if the one table is not available, she replied, \" we are really not suppose to do that, and you would have to wait for that one table\".  Terribly run restaurant, bad management."}
{"text":"This place has really good and unique food and great specials. The inside is really cute and the service is great. 

The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because they say they don't take reservations just call aheads, but when I called they said they had been booked with reservations all day. If you're going to take reservations don't say that you don't on your website."}
{"text":"Amazing menu and great service!  I am very familiar with Strongsville, but when my friend suggested this restaurant I was clueless as to where it even was.  The ambiance is great and the outdoor patio even more inviting!  
The menu has many vegetarian options as well as good portioned salads, etc.  
I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Had been to the Westlake location for a private party and food was quite good.  Took the family plus a guest here day after Christmas.  Nicely decorated.  Of our party of 6, only one person was really thrilled with  their food- steak and crab.  Risotto was not good and didn't compliment the lobster tail.  We were seated immediately and restaurant was not crowded but took a long time for anyone to approach our table- we had to ask the hostess for assistance.   Way too expensive a place for the overall experience.  Yelp shows it as fairly inexpensive and that sure isn't accurate for dinner."}
{"text":"3.5 Nice decor, good drink selection. The menu is limited, but it has a good variety to meet most tastes. We really liked the calamari, it was light and crispy with a great sauce. It is pricey for what you get. I ordered the Lobster cavatappi for $27. I expected 4+ large shrimp, and noticeable lobster meat for that price. As you can see from the picture, it was small partial pieces of salad shrimp, and lobster so broken down, the dish lacked any texture. I enjoyed the flavor, but it wasn't worth the price compared to other local restaurants. My wife felt the place should scored 4 stars, but she didn't have to pay for the dinner. :)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for happy hour!  They have a special happy hour menu with a selections of drinks, apps, and entrees all for $5.  

The staff is very helpful and friendly!  They always give great recommendations and are very knowledgeable on the food and alcohol.

The coolest part about this place is the giant outdoor fire pit in the front of the restaurant.  They have a bunch of rocking chairs out there too so you can just hang out on a nice night with a great cocktail and some friends :)"}
{"text":"After a completely disappointing and frustrating start years ago, Rosewood has become a default local restaurant for my wife and I. 

I admit it. I hated Rosewood when it first opened. The entire \"we don't take reservations\" infuriated my wife and I.  We have little kids and a fixed schedule; we can't just wait around to maybe someday get a table. 

But, years later things have settled down.  My wife and I are fairly confident that we can walk in at nearly any time and get a table without much hassle. 

There are certain dishes that have become standard meals in our consistent favorite list.  After the crowds have dissipated, Rosewood has become like a local dinner place.  Consistent and always great quality.  

A rough opening but settled down into something great."}
{"text":"Some co-workers and I were in town for business. We ended up here late night and not only was the food good, but the service was great as well. She was very accommodating to our needs and even made recommendations on where to go after they had closed.

During the summers I could see this place being packed with the outdoor firepit and patio area.

Stop in! It didn't seem like a 'regular chain off the highway' type of restaurant and the decor was contemporary and inviting."}
{"text":"I met a client for dinner here during my last trip to Cleveland because he said (and I'm paraphrasing here), \"My wife and I have been trying to get in here for dinner for six months and they've never had less than an hour-and-a-half wait.\"  Whoa!  Ok, sounds like its probably a pretty good place, and if he's willing, I'm able.

We had a reservation for 6:30pm on a Wednesday and were seated right away.  The place was maybe 1/3 full.  It seemed like a very \"hip\" place with a nice big bar area and several small-to-medium sized dining areas.  This created kind of an intimate feel, which was a little odd for a quasi-social business dinner but there we were, at a nice table for two.  Ha!

I had fish tacos and my companion had steak.  We both finished our plates - very tasty food.  We had beers, too.  They have Hop Devil IPA on tap, one of my favorites.  Thumbs way up for that!  There was an extensive wine list, too, but I didn't look at it too closely.

We chatted with our waiter about the persistent wait and the volume of business they do, and he confirmed that it's been crazy since they opened about six months ago.  Fridays and Saturdays typically have a three hour wait.  3 hours!  I got the feeling there aren't many places like this in the Strongsville area.  Our waiter recommended calling as soon as they open in the morning at least a day before you want to come for dinner.  

I didn't see the check but I'd ballpark our bill at $45.  Not too shabby.  If someone else is picking up the tab, and has a reservation, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. Ordered Chicken Paillared. Paillard style means pounded thin and grilled QUICKLY to keep the chicken juicy. My 2 pcs were very very dry & hard in places. I even wondered if it had been grilled earlier in the day and then reheated but certainly can't say for sure. My 3 meager looking pcs of asparagus were overcooked to the point of being difficult to cut mush. My meal was not at all hot, in fact it was barely even warm. My husband had the Oriental Chicken salad & said it was unremarkable & that he's had better. Isn't flatbread supposed to be crisp? Had to use a knife & fork because ours was soft & gooey. It was tasty (mushroom & brie) but not a crisp flatbread. On the only positive note of last evening, the Sashimi Shots were very tasty and nicely presented."}
{"text":"Service in the dining room is a little slow sometimes but the bar is alway solid. Fried duck wings and  lobster bisque though....I could live off that forever."}
{"text":"In what I would consider a sophisticated decor, my girlfriends and I met for dinner last night. It was the first time for all of us to visit and I think we were all impressed! One friend began her meal with lobster bisque and she thoroughly enjoyed it. I chose not to have an appetizer because I wanted to save room for dessert.  As an entree, we all had the fillet mignon. Each was cooked perfectly!  The steak came with garlic mashed potatoes & asparagus. The asparagus was cooked slightly al dente, as vegetables should be, and the mashed potatoes were creamy with just the right amount of garlic... not the wall paper paste consistency that other places seem to serve. The crème brûlée for dessert was spectacular! (I think I made the right choice in saving myself for this ). Service was top-notch!  I look forward to bringing my husband here. I know he will enjoy it as much as I did!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this establishment and I will say I am very impressed. My wife and I met my daughter and son-in-law there with their six-month-old and the restaurant was very accommodating having a little one. Our waitress was very attentive and gave us the rundown of the daily specials from the chef. We ordered drinks and appetizers which came out very timely. It did take a little bit for our entrées to come out as the restaurant was very busy at this time. My wife ordered the short rib and my daughter ordered the baby back ribs. Son-in-law chose the rainbow trout and I the fish tacos. Everything came out really good with the exception of the ribs my daughter had. They were very tough and I'm not sure if overcooked but they definitely were not fall off the bone type. The manager was quick to come to the table and apologized and emphasized that they don't normally come out that way. My daughter opted for a cup of soup since we were in there so long and they took the ribs back. The manager also offered complimentary desserts for the entire table for our inconvenience. Was a very nice gesture making it right. 

The Decore in the restaurant was very nice however for some reason this evening it was rather loud with a full house. They also offer a bar area with sports on the TV. Plenty of seating and probably can accommodate larger groups with reservations.
I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been to the Rosewood Grill several times in the past and the service was less than wonderful the food was mediocre. I ended up dining at the Rosewood Westlake with a group of 14 people last week. I was pleasantly surprised by the outstanding care and service from our server (Ann). She had wonderful recommendations on any of our special needs and knew exactly when we needed attention. This made our experience delightful. She was kind enough to help us take photos to remember the day. The lunch trio was a wonderful suggestion and I must say the food has greatly improved, the lobster bisque is something to brag about.
Once again, it is nice to go to a restaurant where you have \"outstanding food and professional service\" this made for a memorable experience.
We will be back.
Thank you,
Delany Higgins."}
{"text":"I had my college graduation party here and it was perfection! They have a back room that was nice and quiet separate from the main dining area. Everything I had was delicious from the flatbread and crab wonton appetizers to my blackened chicken pasta! I've only been back once after and had a fish dish with lobster rice, which was to die for! Even snagging a bite of my little brother's chicken tenders was fantastic. I don't think I have one bad thing to say. If you are in the area I would check it out!"}
{"text":"My lady friends and I had an incredibly under whelming experience here. Kind of horrible actually. While we were a party of 7 and it was the day after Christmas, I feel these are the only excuses Rosewood Grill has in it's defense. Given all the other Yelpers that loved this joint, I was so disappointed I did not feel the same. 

The restaurant was freezing - to the point that some of us still had our jackets on during dinner. Aside from the temperature, our server checked on us so little, the number was practically negative - we almost went to the bar twice to get our own drinks, but she intercepted us each time, realizing she was neglecting us. Um hi, do you work here?? Not only that, each time she would stop at the table to drop off said drinks, she did not even ask any of us if we needed anything else and basically scampered away without looking up. With a table of 7, this was pretty atrocious. 

The only saving grace for this place was that the food was terrific and the manager (I assumed) did come around during our meal to chat with us and ask how everything was. While much appreciated, it was too little too late. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great steaks and seafood. Nice patio dining in good weather. Inside this place is classy above its price class. You feel like you're out for a special occasion. Service and food prep has been top notch. Chef is pretty creative with the specials. Great place for a date night or to celebrate life with friends. Classy without being stuffy in the least."}
{"text":"Visited Rosewood Grill on Valentine's Day this year. Had previously made a reservation ahead of time so there wouldn't be any issues. I had heard nothing but good things about them.... until I experienced it. We were barely greeted upon arrival and sat at a very small close to the door table. Took 10 minutes for someone to bring us menus (despite the emptiness of the restaurant) and when they finally were brought they were dropped in a pile on our table. Not a single person explained anything to us able any specials or offered to take our drink orders. When our waitress finally came around she seemed unprepared and was unsure of what she was doing. Still no explanation of specials - WE HAD TO FIND THE VALENTINES DAY MENU SPECIAL OURSELVES (mind you- managers & other hosts went to other tables to point this out to other diners). We placed our order for food and drinks, and our appetizers were delivered prior to our drinks. I had ordered my entree (a file mignon) to be cooked medium but more well so just slightly pink in the center. I also am allergic to asparagus so asked for a substitute for green beans - which was approved. Took another 20 minutes after our salad plates were cleared to get our food. When I cut into my file it was practically still on the farm eating its last meal. I have never had a piece of meat delivered so rare. Nobody came to ask about our food for another 10 minutes and by that time my meal was cold. When I explained what happened the server said she'd fix it and took my entire plate. When it was returned to me I had even rarer piece of already cut into meat on a new plate with a different meal. Clearly they swapped my meal with another diners. I had to again explain my allergy to asparagus to which the (I'm presuming manager) who seemed distressed to assist me and was given a substitution which was cold by the time it arrived. I at that point had lost my appetite, but not a single person came to check in on us. I later saw another server bring my food plate back out to the table but hesitated and asked another worker who both snickered about how it was supposed to be mine and then made a comment that she was going to keep it for herself. For such expensive food and drinks it is NOT WORTH THE PRICE YOUPAY. I was also informed by our waitress that the owners were there so it was stressful- you'd think that if that were true service would have been slightly better than mediocre. Will definitely not be returning. And sad to say our Valentine's Day meal was less than hoped for."}
{"text":"Have you seen the episode of sponge bob where mermaid man pukes up the crabby patty and re-eats it?...That's what I want to do with Rosewood grill steak! if you go here it's a must! Yummy !"}
{"text":"Hospitality Restaurants comes through again with the opening of its new Strongsville location. 

First off, the space is just cool. The restaurant is open with great sight lines but still manages to feel comfortable and intimate.  The restaurant also has a great outdoor dining area. Or you can just relax with a glass of wine and chat with friends al fresco. 

My party all had steak, ranging from the sirloin strip to the center cut filet mignon.  The steaks were seasoned perfectly and cooked to order. And consistent (medium rare is medium rare, not some approximation). 

Rosewood has an impressive wine list. You'll find something to pair with whatever enter you choose. They also have a selection of craft beers including the Rosewood Red (made by Akron's own Thirsty Dog Brewing Co.

The wait staff was fantastic.  Attentive without being overbearing. Had a great handle on the menu, preparations, and wine list. 

Great first impression. Can't wait to go back and sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"Everytime I am home to visit my family and friend in Hudson we go to the Rosewood Grill. It is always fabulous, from the food to the staff - we just love it. This is one of the best restaurants in Hudson, Ohio."}
{"text":"Great drinks, great ambiance, great atmosphere.  Private room for a dinner party.  Everything was delicious and the service was great.  This spot is certainly a place to visit."}
{"text":"My wife and I  still enjoy eating here for quite awhile now.  Their food is still very delicious as are their wines and mixed drinks i.e. Port of Manhattan.

We have never had a bad meal there and we always look forward to returning there.  We have even made acquaintances of some of the employees."}
{"text":"Eh. I have to preface this by saying I usually don't write reviews unless I'm super pissed or someone went above and beyond. I also live in manhattan so I'm used to eating well and having tons of options when I go out. I was in town a week before my 30th birthday and my grandparents were in from Ukraine as well. Needless to say this was a big night for me. I usually don't eat out while in Strongsville also as most of the food is either chains or subpar mom and pops with overworked staff where the biz itself is barely making enough margin to survive. That's just the nature of a restaurant business unfortunately. 
Having said all that rosewood is a great place for lunch maybe? Or a quick drink after going.... to the mall? Do people even do that? The food here is way overpriced, basically tastes like something from applebees. My steak was chewy and cold, my mushrooms and onions were cold. The steak was tiny, a little dot on the plate. Everything tasted like butter and just felt like it was oozing with fat, butter, oil and ranch. Endless ranch. SUPER bland tasting food, nothing to write home about. They do have Cheap IPAs and a lot of wine to choose from. Our waitress was great and very attentive. I didn't bother telling her it was my birthday, neither did I bother her about my food being cold. I didn't care for it and when I do that, only twice in my life, I don't take it re-heated or fixed, I would just leave. Because I was with my family, I did nothing and kept my mouth shut with a fake smile. Sometimes you have to in life. Just wanted the night to be over, honestly. The privilege cost me $180 for 5 people and the wonderful party of 8 next to us seemed to be having the time of their life. Definitely a memorable 30th! Do yourself a favor, go to Don Pomeroy's instead if you're celebrating a birthday with family."}
{"text":"The Faroe Island Salmon was absolutely delightful! The menu didn't have too many surprises, and seemed somewhat basic - but it was lunch afterall.

This was a nice spot for a lunch meeting, noise level was acceptable and the food and service were more than adequate. I would like to explore the menu a bit more, and especially the dinner menu, so I'll certainly be back on another trip."}
{"text":"Happy Hour experience -  middle of the pack on the star ratings. Nothing too bad, but  not much made me want to order it again.
The Buffalo Chicken dip was good, cheesy, nice chicken chunks and a little bit of a kick.  It was supposed to come with house made tortilla chips, but instead they were more like homemade pita chips, which was not a bad thing.
All of the apps we ordered were all $6 each.  Others that we tried were the lobster mac n cheese bites, panko crusted shrimp and a spicy chicken wrap.  Skip the flavorless gribiche sauce with the shrimp and ask for cocktail sauce which is much a tastier choice.  There was nothing spicy about the spicy chicken wrap and the tzatziki was flavorless.  I did let the server know and he agreed.  The margarita earned a \"It is just okay\" comment, but my happy hour Bridlewood Pinot Noir was a hit at $4 a glass. On a positive note the house pickled vegetables served with the dishes were delicious and our favorite part of the night.
Maybe they were having an off night for the other items? 
 I have had good experiences at the other Rosewood Grill locations, so I am willing to give them another shot."}
{"text":"Went there New Year's Eve.  Called ahead before 5pm and was told that we (party of four) could be seated at 7:30.  Got there 15 minutes early and waited outside the bar area.  At 7:32 we were seated.  It was apparent to me that this restaurant is under excellent management.  Everyone was hustling and working together. The food as quite good: the Rosewood steak for $18 was as good as steaks costing $10-12 more.  Bread was right out of the oven - almost too warm.  After the initial request for more bread, the waitress replenished without us asking.  The scallops, on a bed of risotto, were very tasty.  The pork chop was cooked exactly as requested and the apple cinnamon bits enhanced the flavor.   I thought that the presentation of the food showed attention to detail.  The only negative is that the restaurant was very noisy.  Admittedly, it was New Year's Eve but it was difficult for the four of us to have conversation without someone requesting the speaker to repeat the statement.  Overall: excellent value and service."}
{"text":"I think this place has a nice atmosphere, but food is just ok. Over priced for the portions and quality.
There were 4 of us and we all tried each other's dish. The 3 fillet special, one fillet was over peppered but perfectly medium rare the second medium and way to spicy and couldn't taste the blue cheese and was medium well as was the third was ove cooked . Mine was the stuffed porkchoos and they were dry and tasted just ok. The brisket tasted good but was kind of chewy. The lobster situ was good but I've had many way better for the same price. I calamari was very good and the eggs were ok. I wouldn't recommend anyone there exelt for maybe drinks and aps"}
{"text":"This is our upscale or modern style dinner. We enjoy sitting in the bar after a long day of work.

The steaks and burgers are fantastic. They're red ale is really really really good. It is my favorite and it is only made for Rosewood Grill."}
{"text":"We've been to the Strongsville location, but this was the first time at the Westlake location. First, this place does take call ahead so, if you want to go on a Saturday evening, learn from us and call ahead. 
I really like this place! The menu has a lot of options, something for everyone.  By the time we got to the table, we were pretty hungry. So we ordered the tomato basil flatbread and the sushi shots. While they were being prepped, they brought some delicious bread and butter to the table. 
The flatbread and sushi shots were good! The sushi shots had tuna, avocado, and came in a crunchy shell. They tasted clean and fresh. The flatbread had a pesto on it which was very flavorful. The crust was thin but also soft. For dinner I got the tomato bisque and a side of sweet potato fries. Both were good but I actually enjoyed the apps more. My hubs got the veggie burger which was really soft but had a good mix of bbq sauce and mustard. Very large portion. 
I'm the end, I still really like Rosewood. The food is good and the service is good and the prices are decent. We'll definitely be back to the Westlake location, but next time, we'll call ahead."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner last night. Very disappointed ! Have been there several times before. I had the bisque , marginal at best. Luke warm. Ordered the trout ,cold,dry, flavorless! It was not crowded but service was slow. Wife's dinner was just o.k. Over all not a good experience ."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The atmosphere inside is modern yet still cozy. Outside you'll find a great fire pit with chairs all around, perfect to enjoy a glass of wine and some dessert. As for the food: best bowl of Lobster Bisque I've had, it was so creamy and flavorful and the little bits of lobster in the center was just the sherry on top ;) The steak was a little tough around the edges but the flavor was still delicious. Thirsty Dog also makes a beer exclusively  for Rosewood Grill called the Rosewood Red, refreshingly light and went well with the steak!

I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"This location of the Rosewood Grille opened October 1, and what a great addition to the Crocker Park area. It is in the old Applebee's across from the shopping area so parking is not an issue. 

Went for Happy Hour and sat in the bar which was a large area, nicely appointed. Felt very homey. 

Drink prices for Happy Hour are a great deal--$4 martinis, and the Pepper Mule was excellent choice.  Happy Hour prices are good until 6. There are several small plates available as well for $6. The buffalo chicken egg rolls and the duck wings were both very good. Another in our party got the ribs from the main menu and loved them. 

Food was great, atmosphere just as great and the staff were even greater. They were all very welcoming and genuinely interested in satisfying the customers. 

The only complaint, if any, is that the women's bathroom has only two stalls so there was a line."}
{"text":"Stopped for the happy hour after doing some shopping in Hudson. There were three of us. Was disappointed that we had to sit in the bar in order to get the happy hour deals. Would have liked to sit on the patio. 

Had a great server and the $4 Martinis were excellent. The appetizers for happy hour were good but not great, but what one would expect for the $5 price. 

All in all, would probably return more for the great happy hour drink choices over the happy hour food."}
