{"text":"I had the cheese slice, and it is one of the best slices I've had in the city. The sauce and cheese reminded me of NYC, the cheese slice mecca!! It was very reasonably priced at $3 and kosher.. The cans of pop are also reasonably priced. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing tasty Pizza great service and good prices best pizza in town will come back thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome kosher pizza store!!!! Their pizza is phenomenal. Great sushi too!!! They are on uber eats."}
{"text":"Oh.my.god. I really liked the slice of pizza the other day. So I decided to order whole pie today. Pre ordered Veggie pepperoni pizza over the phone. Got my pizza, opened it at home. There's no veggies at all, only pepperoni. I called and asked and the guy who took my order said this is what it is. Even when I paid at the cashier I asked it's veggie pepperoni and he said yes. So where is veggies? And charged me $18. Also, the whole pie is totally different than the slice one. Slice pizza is very thin but this whole pizza is thick and doughy. And Very very salty. Extremely disappointed. Will never go back. And I know this owner won't care about this issue at all. What a rude guy."}
