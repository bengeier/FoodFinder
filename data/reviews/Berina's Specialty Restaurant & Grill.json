{"text":"Delicious. Easily the best Balkan food in the GTA.   If this is your first Bosnian experience, order the Chevapi + Sudukice. You will not be disappointed!  Great Chef and Staff as well."}
{"text":"Good, fresh food. The restaurant has a casual but nice atmosphere. Owner was present and very welcoming."}
{"text":"Tasty Bosnian grilled food, very inexpensive. The owner is very nice and you can tell he appreciates your business. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to try if you love cevapi and burek! I have ordered from their catering menu for some birthday parties I've had at my house in the past few years. I ordered a platter of 100 cevapi, which came with Lepinje (soft bread) and kajmak. I also got a few cheese bureks. In my opinion they make the best cevapi in the GTA. (I have tried other places such as Royal Meats and Mrakovic and these ones are my favourite). They are also reasonably priced. Each time I order food for a party, everyone asks where I got the food from.  In addition to catering they also have a restaurant where you can order the same food. Although the decor is out dated the food is really good and more than makes up for it. The owner is Bosnian and is really friendly. When I went there the service was good and I had a great experience overall.   Overall, it is a good restaurant to try if you like Bosnian and Eastern European food."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  We had the chevap (beef and veal kebab pieces) with homemade bread!  It was amazingly flavourful and fresh!  We also had the Burek (meat pie) and it was great too!  Highly recommended!!  Bought some frozen chevap and bread to go too!!!"}
{"text":"These guys have the best borek in town. They also have the halal beef borek which is awesome."}
{"text":"First time here and loved the food. Everything is made in house including the bread. And everything we tried was delicious. The owner is extremely friendly and went out of his way to accommodate our young kids.  It is located in an industrial plaza so no frills by way  of decor or ambiance. Not recommended as a first date location on that front.  Regardless food makes up for it.  Loved the grocery section too- lots of great products to choose from.  This was my first experience with Bosnian food and would highly recommend it."}
