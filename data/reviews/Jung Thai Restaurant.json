{"text":"We wanted a quick, simple dinner and went to Dundas & Hurontario for its many ethnic restaurant choices. Given it was a holiday, not many places were open to choose from, so we settled on Jung Thai. The restaurant itself was small, simple and clean. The staff was nice and responsive.   Our veggie thai spring rolls arrived quickly and were hot, crispy and tasty, filled with carrot and mushroom and not just cabbage.   Next came our green curry with vegetables. The sauce completely lacked flavour, including salt, and the veggies were overcooked. Very disappointing given this is a Thai restaurant. We left the dish virtually untouched.   Our third and last dish was the spicy tofu and it was good. A stir-fry dish consisting of fried tofu pieces in a salty chili-based sauce with a smattering of green beans, cauliflower, onions, carrots and (too much) celery. It arrived hot, and although a bit too oily, it had flavour, varying textures and the veggies were tender-crisp."}
{"text":"Hey Yelpers, This place has a huge menu of both Thai and Chinese.  Reasonable rates, good portions and tasty food.  I ususally do take out from here.  There are no other reviews, so I thought I would add something...  I haven't been here in a while, but would definately go back.  I think they have good lunch specials, too."}
{"text":"A forgettable food experience that friends will not let me live it down...quality and taste was sub-par. A late night drunken regretful eating choice perhaps but definitely not for the sober or for the mindful...worth a skip. .I'm exaggerating..."}
{"text":"I tried Thai for the first time here in this area . I had heard good reviews on Google about this place hence tried the food. The portions are generous and though pricing is bit high it compensates for the quantity . I ordered red curry with steam rice . The food was good and mild spicy . Overall and ok experience but I hope to get an excellent experience when I try the place again"}
{"text":"Went to the place the other day with my friends and loved it! The place is family run and has a range of thai/chinese food. The prices were alright for the quality of food and at first i was iffy on the price of paying 10+ for food but i was astound by how good it is! I went with my family and i recommend going here."}
