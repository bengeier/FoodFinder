{"text":"I went here today for the first time and it was delicious!!!  The service was fantastic !! We shared the sangria, guacamole and chips, fish tacos and enchiladas with the flag sauce, and it was all amazing !!! We will definitely be going back with more of our  girlfriends for some more real authentic fresh Mexican food. Thank you for the wonderful meal !!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff
Great chips and guacamole home made.
Highly recommended cheesy devil shrimp. Heat to taste 
Good food worth waiting for.
Authentic Mexican mmmmmm"}
{"text":"If you like Mexican food that is authentic then this place should do it for you. We've eaten in a few times now and do take out as well. The restaurant is a bit small and does not offer a lot of seating so be prepared to wait if you go during the dinner hour. 
We started with the Chorizo Nachos which are really good however the portion size could be a bit bigger as they were gone in minutes shared three ways. I also had the tortilla soup which was excellent. 
We then ordered the chicken burrito, a chicken chimichanga and the fish tacos which were all to our liking, the mole sauce was on par and the hot sauce that we had to ask for had a nice kick to it. I love fish tacos when I travel to Mexico and these were pretty authentic, they have become my usual order here. 
All in all the dining experience is worth it, the staff are friendly and helpful if you have any questions, entrees average between 12 to 15 dollars and are reasonable size, they do charge extra for guacamole however. 
Parking is in the mini mall next door either at the side or in the back, it's fairly busy but we always manage to find a spot."}
{"text":"Simply delicious! The food was authentic and the flavours were amazing. The evil shrimp comes out on a sizzling plate and it is so creamy and full of spices. The baja fish tacos were crunchy and well seasoned. We were also lucky enough to try the tamales as they're usually sold out! 

To top it off, the service was amazing and we received free churros from the Yelp check-in!"}
{"text":"I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS PLACE!
This is my favorite taco place. The first time I went here with my boyfriend, we were in love. The tacos are sooo authentic, staff is so wonderful and the food is DELICIOUS! We ordered Tostados to start off with and man were they good. Now the tacos... The sizing is perfect, the price is good and the food was to die for! I've gone back over 10 times and never have I been disapointed. If you're ever in the area, and have a craving for tacos.. THIS IS YOUR PLACE! :)"}
{"text":"So delicious! The service was great too. Family run place. He even brought two homemade salsas (one spicy red hot pepper one and a mild green one) out that he thought would compliment the flautas."}
{"text":"This is a true Mexican restaurant. The food is delicious and the servers are genuinely helpful. I came with 2 of my friends. We started with chips with guacamole.  The Tortilla chips are homemade. I ordered the enchilada with grilled chicken. It was huge and amazing. My friends had the mole enchilada and the three flags enchilada. Both were unique and good. If you like spicy, you must try the hablero sauce (it's homemade).  Also consider trying the Mexican sodas, it you like to try something different. I will definitely return and try the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Was great experience. Enjoyed Baja Fish Taco with Tamarind homemade juice.

Very pleasant staff at a nice and clean restaurant"}
{"text":"From Dallas, TX here on business in Toronto,  looking for a mexican food and thought I'd try this place.. drove 30 min from Toronto.. well worth the drive, let me tell ya..

-GPS, best way to find it.. 
- order queso with chorezo, great taste
-fish baja tacos, perfect taste, batter with dos xx's.
-co-worker got the beef nachos and he hasnt said a word, lol
-its small area but very cozy area.. has two  TV's and a small mall behind it
-plays great music
-has beer/liqour for your liking

**would recommend to com here if craving real mexican food.. the family is from Mexico, born i  USA, family from matamoros, so know mexican food."}
{"text":"Last time I was here was about a year and half ago.

Food was pretty good Mexican in comparison to the other places in the GTA. Staff was very nice, I went in with a group of 8 and they got food out quick and it was good. Everyone was happy with their meals."}
{"text":"Pretty much as good as being in Mexico! Not a hipster taco joint with some pretentious menu. Amazing guacamole and of course flavourful hot sauces! Try the Shrimp Taco specialty taco! Slightly sweet with a hint of smokey spice! Good drink menu and kid friendly! Good prices and cool owner. Usually busy but tables move pretty good! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Ordered the baja fish tacos - it was delicious.  I strongly recommend having it with the guacamole.

I also ordered the churros for dessert.  It was really good and definitely a good ending to my meal.

The place is a bit small, so I came on a weekday during lunch and it was perfect.
The food came really fast and the service was good too."}
{"text":"Nice place for lunch. Price is good. Food was good. My family likes it. Guacamole was extra $1."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. Def recommend the nachos, shrimp in cheese sauce, fish tacos, and churros. Will be back to try more."}
{"text":"I went that restaurant a couple of months ago. The mexican food that I have experience it was pretty nice. I ordered two sodas that are mexicans, exotic and tasty sweet. I ordered to the waiter that wanted the most spicy sauce. He think that I was a pretty crazy, because cannot handle it. Finally I could.
The services of those waiter are pretty friendly, really kind. When their speak Spanish, they do not speak swear."}
{"text":"Despite the location, this Mexican place has a very nice atmosphere and great food. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. I highly highly recommend the Baja fish tacos - very fulfilling. Careful with the habanero spicy sauce, it's spicy but really good. Churros are out of this world (waiter said they were hand made). I really liked the churro nachos too (although we had the halal kind so it may be different made from pork). All in all, I'd definitely go back. Beauty spot."}
{"text":"Got their devil shrimp and Baja fish tacos.... Tacos were on point and the devil shrimp came in a very rich creamy cheesy sauce with Mexican rice... The shrimp were extremely tasty and the rice with the sauce tasted good.... The only downside is guacamole is an extra dollar.. Doesn't come included... Also tried their churros.... They were baby pink in color.. First time ever seen them in that color... They were finger sized but flavorful.. Not too sweet.... A. Little on the expensive side tho... Would order here again... Or come in... It's a hole in the wall kinda place... Not a fancy sit down...."}
{"text":"No different to other reviews. 
Tried the fish tacos and churro, definitely a superior Mexican/ taco joint around in the city"}
{"text":"This place rocks- best Mexican food outside of Mexico- could eat here every day! Wonderful staff and food is outlandishly good"}
{"text":"Best Mexican I've had. Fresh, made to order.
Guacamole is amazing.
Must haves:
Tortilla soup
Fish tacos - batter is perfect
Evil Shrimp - a bit of a kick but the cheese chipotle sauce is rammed with flavor (comes with a side of nachos to finish up the sauce)"}
{"text":"Service was good, very friendly people. However the food was extremely bland, they were missing many of the toppings that were mentioned on the menu. Ordered $40 in food and ate maybe 10% of it."}
{"text":"My G. I travel leaps and bounds to get to this fine establishment. Every single time. The boy's recommendations? Lemme tell you something,

GROUND. BEEF. TACOS.

Your boy doesn't eat red meat much, but when it's at Border MX it's almost impossible not to. I had 3 of them lil buddaz on my plate with rice & beans accompanied by 2 chips. This experience was ludicrous.

The chips and guac belong in a tumblr blog. 50k likes on Instagram EASY. No lacking, their chips are to die for and are always finished when your boy gets involved. No contest.

The churros are that one toy you always wanted as a kid but couldn't get. I had the churros, went home and did WORK on my computer. They know what it is.

All in all, amazing place and I ain't switchin'. Pimp don't simp I'm out.

- skoolbus russ"}
{"text":"We visited the 5/10 location and ordered the Chicken/Steak/chorizo fajitas, Enchiladas with green sauce and Taquitos. The food is ok. We were disappointed that the tortilla shells and guacamole are store bought vs homemade. The place needs a good cleaning and we were sat at a table that needed wiping before we sat down. Service is friendly and the value was good. I appreciate supporting the small businesses but I won't return. I'm not sure it deserves a \"Best in Mississauga\" reputation."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  I had the mix and match tacos and they were amazing, I am definitelygoing to be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Ok, people had recommended the Baja Fish tacos because they are so good. I totally agree. These tacos were very tasty. Will be back that next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"It has been my third visit at this Mexican restaurant the service is always good no complain at all... the server named Jorge is very friendly.  Excellent authentic Mexican food!!! I will recommend my friends and family to try the food here!!!  Very pleased!"}
{"text":"Over all my experience was pretty okay. I went on a Tuesday afternoon and it was very dead inside but still it took around 50 minutes for our food to be placed on our table. I LOVED the chips and salsa, it was extremely fresh. Service was excellent. However, i ordered a quesadilla & it just fell apart in my hands. There was just too much oil and sauce for my taste.. I wasn't a fan of the rice or the beans. My boyfriend got the fish tacos though and i have to say it was very delicious! Also I loved the churros. Would I go back? Sure but i would definitely not order the quesadillas again."}
{"text":"Good authentic food. Small portions though for the price and sometimes you have to waiiiiiittt for your order to come as they would have just one cook"}
{"text":"Food was great. Staff were polite. Best mexican food I've had so far. And in terms of burritos and tacos...This is more authentic. Burrito boys, Chipotle, all those other fast food taco places are not comparable. This place actually has good flavor. Side dishes like beans and Mexican rice were pretty good. Tried the chimichangas and baja tacos...I do believe they have the best fish tacos in sauga at a good price. Almost comparable to grand electric...In terms of fish tacos only. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Food was really good. The only thing I didn't like was the fact they didn't give me any cutlery. Since, I did a take out it was really hard for me to eat my regined beans -.-

Other than that its a nice restaurant:)"}
{"text":"Came to Border MX based on the good Yelp reviews, and was let to disappointment. 

We were seated in the far back corner of the restaurant by the washrooms. We were literally out of sight from the kitchen, front counter, and rest of the restaurant. This of course led to non-existent service. 

Ordered the ground beer nachos with added guac $1, 3 baja fish tacos, and a mixed flag (3 sauce) enchillada's plate. It was weird that each dish came separately with a long wait between each. The nachos took 30 mins to arrive and it was soggy. 

The baja fish tacos were not crispy, and the overall taco was quite tasteless. The enchillada's were nothing special. The meat inside them were actually cold, and not hot! 

Did not bother using the Yelp check in for a free churo, as that likely would have taken another 30 minutes. 

$57 after tax and tip for 2! I likely not be back based on the food and service."}
{"text":"very good food. Friendly staff. The chips and guacamole were good as were each of our mains. 
They also had an assortment of Mexican soft drinks which were tasty"}
{"text":"I would like to give them 3.5 because their Baja fish taco was delicious and filling! This place had great atmosphere inside with Mexican music playing and the staff talking Spanish, but the location is questionable...The enchiladas flag dish was ok, the taco was much better. Really excited to try other dishes in the future! And churros was great and a must have after dinner!!"}
{"text":"Well I'm a huge fan of Mexican and live right in streetsville so I couldn't wait to try this out. Surprised by the Inside , I thought this would be an incredible dining room but it was just average looking...no big deal , who cares if the food is great ? Not me! Staff was friendly and informative ..obviously very nice people , kudos to them.
On to the food. 
I had Evil Shrimp .. not evil ( spicy ) , not big shrimp ( typical frozen style smallies) and lacked any flavour. Looks good though ..what a shame.
Chimichanga ... Best of the group ..big , fairly tasty but the chicken is again typically frozen vacuum sealed chicken ordered from a frozen supplier. 
Fajitas ... Same cheap chicken but dry as a bone ..3 HALF PIECE tortillas ..wow that is chincy ! Typically Canadian style fajitas with the usual toppings ..nothing special but ok.
Taquitos .. bean filled were decent but like everything else lacked much spice or flavour ..it's fairly inexpensive but nothing but average food ..no idea what the fuss is about but I figure most are dying for Mexican so enjoy what they can get"}
{"text":"I love this place, authentic mexican food. The menu has a variety  of things to try and it's halal. Service is great I come here every now and then to try new dishes on their menu."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Definitely the most authentic tasting Mexican food I've had in Peel. I had the evil shrimp and tried a fish taco. The churros were awesome as well! We ordered delivery for about 12 people. My only issues were:

1. They don't have a machine to accept card for delivery (not sure about in store). So we had to drive to a bank and pull out $240 in order to pay. Very frustrating and it would've made more sense to simply pick up the food, which I would've had I not had 10 of my employees waiting. 
2. The food showed up with no utensils or plates when we specifically asked for some. 

If it weren't for the 2 glitches above, I would've given them a 5*. The food was great, and the man who took my order seemed to be very helpful and kind."}
{"text":"We'll settle for 3 stars, but more so 2.5 if I could. 

This place is new, so I'm really hoping it'll be much better after some time. 

The food was OK. Boyfriend wasn't feeling adventurous and settled for comfort food - maybe that was our mistake.
We decided to go with their Cabos nachos with chorizo, and Baja fish tacos. 

The nachos were mediocre, and at 11 dollars? You get a much better bang for your buck, at places like Jack Astors or a good bar & grill. There was barely any meat. What sausage? The two spoonfuls? 

We enjoyed the fish tacos, aside from the fish filets being on the greasy side. The green arroz was cold and undercooked, and we were told no refried beans was available. 

Service could use some improvement. Our servers were friendly, but they weren't always readily available even for such a small restaurant. And as much as we were hoping to love this place, the language barrier between us and our server, just made it so much more difficult. 

I'm willing to try this place, for other things on the menu. Hopefully there will be improvement over time. Just not exactly eager to."}
{"text":"I've been to Mexico for an hour. I actually walked there, as it appears Mississauga has this hidden gem called Border MX, what an amazing place. When i sat down i immediately felt I'm at the beach ordering some fish tacos. They were delicious.   Out of this world, exceptional. Meal felt like one of those home-made ones! Gracias! Highly recommended. Leaving now, but will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great service, food and atmosphere for this little authentic Mexican restaurant. Highly recommend it to anyone. I had the evil shrimp and you should too. Absolutely amazing experience."}
{"text":"Loving this Halal authentic Mexican restaurant.  I always get the same thing the fish tacos. Absolutely the best fish tacos I've ever had.  Made to order. Comes with slaw and rice and chips.  The guacamole is freshly made and perfect. And the tamarind drink was so refreshingly"}
{"text":"I wanted to go to an authentic Mexican place and since this place had a 4/5 rating on yelp at the time I thought to give this a try.

Decor ... it looks a little run down and its part of a sketchy plaza but the best food often comes from not so pretty establishments so that wasn't an issue for me.

My friend and I ordered the border sampler which had 2 mollettes, 1 sopes and 4 tacquitos. Mollettes was basically a bruschetta type app which was not very good. The sopes was good but there was only one. 

I got the pork carnitas chimichanga which was huge but so-so for taste. The Mexican rice side dish was dry crunchy rice in some parts and flavourless. The side of guacamole which was an additional  $1 was super small.

I also got a green chicken tamale which was very fresh and good with the hot salsa. My drink was a tamarind margarita which came in a cracked plastic glass and was wayyy too sweet with hardly any alcohol.

Although the waiter was very friendly the food took about 40 mins to come out. We went on a Wednesday night.

So overall given the price, the location and lack of flavour in the dishes I ordered, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Everything was sooooo good ! Service was perfect ! They are all friendly . Ordered drinks and felt like I was on vacation . From drinks to appetizer to main dish to dessert ... I give them five stars will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Border MX many times and I'm always happy with my experience.  The menu is fun and everything I've tried has been great.  The service is always friendly and you truly feel like everyone enjoys being there - a very rare thing these days.

A few stand out dishes for me are the RICO Shrimp Tacos and Evil Shrimp (pure coincidence that they're both shrimp items).  The Shrimp Taco is juicy with both sweet and savoury flavours.  Adding the homemade hot sauce really elevates the dish!  The Evil Shrimp comes out on a bubbling platter with a creamy-cheesy chipotle sauce - so much flavour!!

Don't come here if you're looking for fusion tacos or odd combinations - the food is simple and delicious, just as it should be!"}
{"text":"This place is so hidden but amazing !!!! I ordered a combo platter type of thing, came with steak, soup, rice & an enchilada . My boyfriend got a burrito. We both ate everything on our plate and we're super impressed. 

Service was 10/10 
Food 10/10 

Only complaint was portion size for the price but honestly I'd still come back!"}
{"text":"Today decided to take my fiancé to a authentic Mexican restaurant and one that's local, bingo, Border MX is the place.  A quaint small restaurant has friendly service and reasonably clean.  My fiancé had the chicken fajitas and I had the Evil shrimp which had a heavenly taste.  Wash it down with Mexican mango pop and churros that had a wonderful taste.  Prices are decent for dinner for two less than $50.  Will return again."}
{"text":"Let's see where to begin....
We were greeted almost immediately and seated at the table of our choice.The table had not been cleaned yet to which the waiter quickly wisked away food and crumbs left behind. The table was sticky and is in much need of a re-sufacing as there was patches on the covering that were worn through. Wait time for dinks and our main course were ok, not the fastest we've had partly due to the fact there was only one person waiting tables, serving drinks, doing take-out oders and phone orders. We ordered the tortilla chips with guacamole appetizer, when it arrived that's all that was on the table, a basket of chips and a bowl of guacamole, no napkins no plates. I had to ask for napkins, not a good start from my point of view, you shouldn't have to ask for things that should already be on the table. My wife's order was wrong, she ordered the Huarache and she got chicken fajitas, not sure how that happened but suspect having only one person doing five different jobs may have had a little to do with it. The waiter was friendly and attentive and had her correct order out and at our table just 10 minutes later. Overall the food was good, fresh and hot but the sevice lagged a bit and the decor definately need to be refreshed or updated."}
{"text":"Excellent food, amazing atmosphere,  great service. Defiantly coming back. We just found our place. 
Did I mention the food. Divino."}
{"text":"The food was so authentic 
The staff is super friendly 
Tacos are superb 
Wet burrito are exceptional
Nachos are to die for 
I'm coming back"}
{"text":"Very friendly service, and great food. BUT: It's just too overpriced to justify going back. And the venue is lacking ambiance. Really too bad, because they are more than half way there....."}
{"text":"I found out about this place through ISaugga facebook page as being the place with the best Mexican fish tacos in Mississauga so I went with high expectations... 

First impressions were that the chairs are super uncomfortable and they don't have any proper booth seating. For a new restaurant the tables look run down already, there was music playing that was fun and festive but I could barley hear my friend talking... We started off sharing guacamole and chips, I liked the authentic style chips and that they were warm as for the guacamole it just tasted like mashed up avocado with tomato it lacked salt and zesty lime flavour. There was not a lot of guac and we had tons of chips left over, our server offered to bring us some salsa (I don't know if it was going to be free) but we said yes as we had lots of left over chips and he never brought it to us...

The Baja fish tacos were good I liked the presentation and the plates, they were filling and came with a side of Mexican rice and beans (I could not eat it all) again it lacked spice and zing from lime... I asked for hot sauce but it took a while to come (and it was not busy) I only had it on 1 of the 3 tacos. A suggestion would be to have hot sauce in bottles at each table or have them accessible to customers in a central location so I could of just grabbed it when I wanted it...I had a margarita that was more ice and sweet flavour then lime and salt like I am used to... It was served in a plastic glass (kinda tacky) I would of loved it to be in a Mexican blue rimmed glass. They did not come around much to see if we wanted another drink and it took awhile for them to clear the table. We decided to split the churos with caramel dipping sauce and they were fresh and hot. 
All in all I was kinda disappointed in the lack of flavours like spicy or lime or cilantro. And found the service kinda slow and the chairs really uncomfortable that I did not want to stick around for another drink. I will maybe try it again as they're still new it I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this place and if you are looking for authentic Mexican food then this is place. We ordered the Baja fish tacos and it's amazing the size and portions are excellent compared to other places where they serve you tiny portions but not at this place I highly recommend ordering these tacos. We also ordered a chimichanga and an enchilada with mole sauce along with our respective drinks michelada and a Mexican Bulldog,  our overall experience was great and I'm looking forward on visiting this place again."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic mexican food, Average Prices, Good Service however smaller portions than expected.

Our dinner came to $54 for 2 people and a drink.

FOOD: 4/5 Delicious authentic mexican cuisine, very flavourful without so much of the added salt these days, loved PICO DE GALLO so delicious.

My taco plate was great, big fan of there tortilla, tastes so fragrant. The popular consenses is true, they do need to be more aware of timing because my plate was cold when it reached my table.

The evil shrimp was okay, after hearing so much good things from it, the shrimps were fairly small .

The long island ice tea was nice!!

The churros are the BEST!!  Must order from them. 

Service: was pretty nice! Had a nice blonde gentlemen who served us, perfect service.

He almost forgot to charge us the drink so we had to remind him, so make sure you look at your bill before walking out!

Id give them an extra star if they sought out to increase the portion sizes for their sides, and offer more option

-The portions are smaller, they say it comes with sides but the sides are maybe 1/4 cup of beans and rice."}
{"text":"Loooveeddd this! Chorizo Quesadilla was amazing. Great thing about this place is they do a lot of the little things right that prove it's authenticity."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Mexican food.  The location was a little awkward, in a little mall.  The store can be accessed by outside.  I ordered the nachos and fish tacos.  They were delish! 
Please try for yourself!

Food 4.5/5
Location 3.5/5 parking weirdly accessible but not impossible.
Service 4.5/5
Price 4/5"}
{"text":"What an amazing spot, I drive from Downtown to Mississauga just to eat this home made like food."}
{"text":"Border MX is located on the east side of Hurontario north of Dundas inside a small indoor mall but faces the street and has an outside entrance as well.

It was my brother's birthday and as he usually does he left his decision making to the very last minute because that's just the way he us.  Thankfully for him and all of us he uses Yelp to find places to eat and this is just another on the fly success story of how Yelp helped HIM find a place to have his birthday lunch with the family.  

Before going to church he tells me he found a place and asked me to see if I could get us a table for 8.  Short notice indeed... I tried to call the place after 11 am on a Sunday but I couldn't get a hold of them.  I tried again later and was able to get through so I had asked if we could get a table for 8 for around 1:30pm.  It was short notice but they happened to have a large group table at the back that luckily was free.

The menu has a lot of choices including burritos, chimichangas (fried version), flautas, tacos, and so on.  So many things to choose but the beauty of this place is that they make authentic Mexican.  This isn't Taco Bell!  I ended up getting 6 tacos but 4 different varieties including carnitas, chorizo and 2 different beef versions.  The entire table had a mix of dishes and there was a lot of sharing going on.  

Their tortilla chips are really good here, they're fresh and crispy fried.  I was in love.  The sides that come including choices of rice, beans etc are just that.  The mains are the focus and these dishes are the real deal.  

The hot sauce here is legit.  It's not often I find places that give you real hot sauce because let's be honest.  Real hot sauce for many would be too intense.  I love hot and this met all my expectations.

Our server Jorge was amazing and helpful.  What a great find by my slacker brother!  He can thank Yelp for this find I suppose.  

To sum it up, this place is legit authentic Mexican right down to the drinks.  Great food, great service and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Good food, poor service... 

I ordered the \"evil shrimp\" appetizer and enjoyed it. 

However, the service was extremely slow and the waitress forgetful. We waited a while before getting our food, having to follow up on it (it seemed that they may have forgotten to put in our order). Once we got our food, it got busy inside (we were out on the patio), and they seemed to forget about us. We asked for hot sauce and sour cream, and had to follow up twice for each request.

May have been a function of how busy they were that day... So I'm rating it 3 stars for now, hoping next time service will be better..."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Mexican food. the portions are fabulous and do not say more the taste is authentico.I had the opportunity to visit the two locations in both the service is excellent and definately I return as many times as necessary. I tried the fish tacos and my girlfriend tasted the cochinita pibil and the best accompanied by some delicious margaritas. I would give them many more stars. Have to try this authentic food"}
{"text":"The prices has increased since... But still very good. Their mole sauce is on point. We still love their fish and shrimp taco like no other."}
{"text":"This place got me wanting Mexican food. Awesome menu and great tasting food. The Restaurant is pretty small though and to wait you have to either wait on the street or the plaza it is in. Not sure how this will play out during cold seasons. This review is few months old and not sure how I missed reviewing it.

I cannot remember the names of my dish simply because I do not know the language. But, I had a chicken dish which was awesome. It was suggested by my friend and I thank him for that.

The review got 3 stars due to the restaurant space and wait line arrangements. Not the most comfortable of places. The tables are quite small to my liking; even the 4 person table is not enough for 4.

The service is friendly and fast. The server was very attentive. He knew his menu well and was good with his recommendations.

Based on food, I would recommend. Based on space, not so much a fan."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican food in Mississauga family run. I have tried many items on there menu and would recommend pretty much everything on it. Makes me feel like I'm by the beach again having some Baja Fish tacos!!!"}

{"text":"Went here on the weekend and I'm happy I got to check this place out. 

Came here for lunch and there was continuous traffic of people coming in, but wasn't a problem getting a table and dining in. 

Food was good - very flavourful and taste was on point! 
Ordered the fish tacos, ground beef nachos, and churros. Also tried the jicama (drink). 

Will come back and try other things on the menu when I'm in the area craving Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I came here based on Stephanie S' positive review and the fact that InSauga said it some of the best fish tacos.  

Likes:
-Fish tacos were as advertised.  Amazing.  Crispy fried fish, cole slaw and sweet chipotle mayo in a lightly grilled soft taco.  The overall blend of flavours and hot/cold was amazing and very refreshing. 
-Tortilla soup had a nice tomato flavor with a nice amount of avocado and tortilla chips
-They have a nice drink menu with sangria, margarita, mojito, Corona, etc. 

Dislikes:
-Service is slightly slow, but worth the wait.
-Drinks seem expensive

Overall though, I'd visit again because this place has some true authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch to catch up with some friends.
Nice casual layout inside. Table is a bit rocky but nice cool feeling.
Water is served in glass jars - nice touch.
Hosts are friendly. 
Two of us got the three chicken tinga burrito - nicely packed, very fresh, chicken is cooked well. Would have appreciated more salsa on top - use the green habanero sauce - spicy, but full of flavor. The refried beans are really good, but the Mexican rice could be much better - bland.
Someone else got some crispy tortilla thing - looked really good.
would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a nice casual but quick lunch."}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican food! We had friends from California with us who are very picky of the Mexican food that they eat, and they gave this place a full thumbs up!

We had fish tacos, queso fundido w/ chorizo, flag enchiladas, and they were absolutely phenomenal! Our favourite was the fish tacos which you absolutely must try when you come here. The battered fish in combination with the other taco ingredients was just perfect.

We loved their coke imported from Mexico because it brought back some wonderful memories. Coke in Mexico is made with sugarcane molasses instead of the white synthetic sugar. It's a matter of picking the poison that one prefers. 

The best thing about this restaurant is that they make everything from scratch, nothing from a pre-made pack. Their Pina colada was made with real pineapple & coconut, it was a super yummy.

The food came out fast & service was extremely friendly, will definitely come back again in the future!"}
{"text":"I ordered nachos with chicken with side of guac.  I paid about $15.  They very stingy on salsa, cheese and guac. They brought the guac, salsa, and sour cream on these tiny dish, enough for one spoonful.  There was not enough cheese on the Nachos.

I tasted my friend's fish taco, and thought it was good.  Not great but good enough.  My friend was charged for guac she never asked for, and got charged.  My friend ordered a one alcohol drink, and I had water.  The bill came out to $40.

However, they nickle and dime the customer and definitely stingy on things that matter in Mexican food, such as cheese, sour cream and salsa.    Given how great the workers are I may consider coming back some day, but certainly not any time soon.   I witness the workers singing happy birthday to someone who was celebrating her birthday.  That was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Mexican sit-down in Mississauga? That's new. A lot of my recent reviews for new business open with something along the lines of talking about how the establishment is a welcome change to the city - Border MX is just another example. 

They have a street-front location on the southeast corner of Kirwin and Hurontario, in the mall/plaza. There is ample parking in the double-decker lot, with entrances on both Hurontario and Kirwin street (drive slow when entering through Kirwin - the entrance is very steep). 

The restaurant has many sparsely placed tables in an irregularly-shaped space, and the restaurant itself is far from cramped. The Spanish music they play is a fitting touch to their Mexican-style decor. 

Both times I've visited, I've been greeted by the same familiar faces. The good part of this is that it creates more of an intimate experience, always dining in with the same servers. However, they may be a bit understaffed, so requests can take longer than you'd expect. 

On to the food - the menu is much more extensive than other Mexican take-out places around the city - they have a wide variety of dishes. I'd highly recommend trying something new, as I found many of their menu items to be quite unique.

Thus far, I've tried the queso fundido, chorizo wet burrito, and the evil shrimp. 

The queso fundido is white the appetizer - three flatbreads served with a platter of melted cheese. There is an option to top the cheese with meat of vegetables, I opted for the vegetables. The cheese was quite hard but delicious, and the flatbread provided a good pairing. Definitely a must try, but also due to the amount of cheese given, I'd also say it's a must share. 

The chorizo wet burrito is simply a burrito with sauce and cheese drizzled over top. It comes with two sides - I chose the refried beans and the Mexican rice. Nothing much to say here, it was quite the standard offering, but definitely done right.

The evil shrimp is an offering from their special menu. It's basically shrimp served on a hot platter with a lot of sauce, which you can mix into the rice. This dish also comes with a large order of tortilla chips, which were very fresh and appetizing. This dish is a must try just cause of that sauce, mmm.

Service-wise, other than the longer-than-average wait times for requests, Border MX was quite good. They are attentive and even offer you complimentary house salsa in three heat levels for your added enjoyment. 

All in all, Border MX is quite the addition to Mississauga's growing food scene. I'll definitely be making a visit on a Friday or Saturday night (apparently they have a different menu complete with new recipes). I'll also need to make further visits to try all the different dishes I've never had the chance to try yet. 

Keep it up, Border MX!"}
{"text":"Service is always good friendly and fast. We also had the guac issue someone else mentioned  (my son doesn't like it so odd)

Also make sure your  whole party orders together as otherwise it all comes at very different timex. Theor nachos sauces and baja fish tacos are great.
 Loved the salt  on my Tecate beer nice touch and churros!

No ac though or not much ac."}
{"text":"My birthday dinner.  My wife and daughter took me out to a special birthday dinner Border MX.  Appearances are deceiving because what we ate was absolutely delicious.  I can honestly say that the Fish Tacos at MX were crazy delicious.  A must order.  My girls gobbled up the Chorizo Nachos.  I found them to be very tasty as well.  We also ordered a Shrimp Entrée.  I can remember the name of this dish but it was also delicious.  I found the service to be unrushed and professional.  The have several different options for hot sauces too.  Don't forget to ask your server.  I really loved their \"Hottest\" sauce.   It was perfect.  Our server also took the initiative and packed up an extra container of their HOTTEST Sauce with our take away.  Bless his heart.  I took away a star due to the ambiance.  I say renovate!  There is plenty of parking and two entrances to the restaurant.  I will definitely be back for the Fish tacos and Nachos.  
Peace my fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Oh my god this is the best Mexican place ice been to. I love trying new places because when I find places like this it's like I struck gold. The enchiladas are soo good and the burritos are to die for, although I've never had pink churros they were nice and soft but still amazing. Can't wait to come back and try the recommend ed fish tacos."}
{"text":"Service was good, however some snake practices by the server. He casually asked us if we wanted chips and guacamole as though it was included with our meal. Looking at the menu, we saw it cost us $5.99. Seeing that, we opted to go with the nachos with ground beef instead. The server did this a few times with other menu items... 

Food was OK. Best dish was the beef nachos which was really good. We also ordered the chicken tinga burrito and chicken enchiladas with the \"green\" sauce. The burrito was decent size, however, it wasn't great. The green sauce on the enchiladas was overpowering to the point that we couldn't even taste the chicken. Tried both types of beans for the sides which were very tasty.

Menu ranges from $10-$15"}
{"text":"We heard good things about this place from Insauga and I would say I pretty much agree with the assessment. You may be thrown when you first walk in as it appears a bit run down. However the staff is quick, informative and friendly. He seemed genuinely delighted to tell me about all their vegetarian dishes, something I don't get frequently. 
The prices are reasonable and the selection is nice because it's just big enough to give you variety without overwhelming you. We did the sampler which is all veggie friendly, the Tortilla soup (not veggie friendly as they use chicken broth, so I didn't have any but it looked good) the guac and chips and for dessert.... churros! 
The sampler was awesome because I now know I love sopes and will get the full size next time. The tortilla chips are fantastic, crunchy fresh and not too oily. The guac to us was great, fresh and not over seasoned like most places. And the churros Oh My Gosh, we were so stuffed from the generous portions and I still ate them. That sauce! What even is that!?? He said caramel but it tasted almost marshmallow like!! Incredible. I would come back here for sure. But the music is too loud, it was hard to hear the other person over the table."}
{"text":"Good for authentic Mexican food.

They have a selection of Mexican soft drinks, so I ordered the mango pop and I loved it!  And I don't normally like carbonated beverages.  I need to get me some more of this drink....
For food I ordered their Flautas with chicken.  It was so good!  All of my friends ordered the fish tacos, as it was their most popular item on the menu.  We also got the nachos to share, which were also great.  Came with two types of hot sauce on the side.

Service was really friendly and helped us answer any questions we had.

It is located kind of inside the mini mall off hurontario.  You can access the restaurant through the mall or through an outside door.
We went during non busy hours, and we were the only ones there.  Didn't look like a lot of seating, so not sure how packed it is on weekend prime time."}
{"text":"Came here wanting to try out some Mexican food in Mississauga after seeing the favourable reviews on Yelp.

The restaurant is on the small side and reminds me of dining in someone's kitchen; very quaint and casual. We ordered the Baja fish tacos and the \"flag\" enchiladas (with red, green and white cheese sauces).

The food came out rather quickly and the service was friendly and prompt. 

We thoroughly enjoyed the Baja fish tacos -- the batter was tasty and crispy, the coleslaw was refreshing, and chipotle mayo can do no wrong in my books. Great combination of textures and flavours. I would definitely recommend this. As for the \"flag\" enchiladas, we weren't too crazy about them -- not as flavourful as the Baja fish tacos we had earlier. Out of the three sauces we liked the red sauce the most. We also ordered sides of guacamole but found it to be a little too bland and smooth (we're fans of chunky guacamole with lots of seasoning, though I know this sort of thing is up to personal taste).

Overall it was a great experience and we'll definitely come back in the future to get the Baja fish tacos and try more things as well!"}
{"text":"It's an alright Mexican place. The food in general is okay. I liked the chips and salsa and the nachos, but the fajitas were okay. My friend got a veggie burrito and she loved it but I was unimpressed with my food."}
{"text":"Went when it first opened, was ok...went back recently and much better than I remembered...I had the pastor quesedilla which has pork and pineapple, very well done, pork was crispy, however pineapple was one big chunk in each tortilla, would rather have it cut into pieces so I get pork and pineapple with each bite.  Beans and Rice on the side were good too"}
{"text":"We wanted a casual après-work Cinqo de Mayo celebration. We sure found it here.  Simply by Googling \"Mexican restaurants in Mississauga\" we found this unpretentious, easy-going cantina not far from Square One. 

The mood was casual, joyful and the food? Simple, and very tasty!  It tasted like what I would imagine authentic Mexican to be.  It was also a good sign that many of the patrons were Spanish-speaking.  The co-workers and I plan on going again soon!  

p.s. Get the Baja Fish Tacos and red wine sangria!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very Mexican you almost don't even realize you are still in Mississauga. The drink portions are HUGE. I got a mango margarita and it had a real mango taste not the regular artificial flavor. I ordered chicken tacos and pork pineapple. I only found one piece of pineapple. The tacos were not bad I just wish the came with more toppings. It was jus meat and onions. The tacos meal came with three tacos and rice and beans"}
{"text":"Ok we love this place!!! Super authentic! Tasty food and great fast service. 

One think is I wish the sides for the dishes were a little more generous. The refried beans were like 3 table spoons worth, if that. Super cheap side, a little more would go a long way. 

But that being said... the prices are A-mazing and flavour fan-freaking-tastic! 

I highly recommend the enchiladas and the floutas (I think I spelled that right?!? Lol) and the churros!!! Holy cow!! So good!!! 

We will be back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"I've heard some great things about this place from other yelpers and was extremely excited to try a new mexican restaurant in Mississauga. The food was alright but the service was the big issue.

Border MX is located in the small plaza of shops just off Dundas and Hurontario, its small restaurant and seats an extremely small group of people. When you go in, its like walking into someone's house for a meal and a very home feel.

My friends and I booked a reservation for 5 people for 8 pm. When I told the server about our reservation, ran around and didn't talk to me at all about when our table should be ready. We waited about 30 mins to get our table but we didn't have enough chairs for everyone which was another 5 mins. Once all the seats came, we waiting about 15 mins before we even got the menu to order from. Logistically the place is a mess, you could be waiting a while before anyone notices you even have a menu in front of you.

The menu isn't extensive but they have enough to keep you intrigued. I had the wet chorizo  burrito which was good but it came to me luke warm borderline cold.  The rest of my party agreed that their food was cold like it  had been sitting out for a while and was forgotten but we were so hungry from the wait (1 hour from when we sat down) that we ate it anyway.

I was hoping  that the food would make up for the logistical issues we had during our dinner but unfortunately it did not."}
{"text":"Food was great. Very fresh and well priced. Staff is amazing and willing to accommodate you."}
{"text":"Had the enchilada verdes, they were delicious and the Salas and chips also.  I recommend this place and would go back :)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for that real authentic Mexican food, this is the place to go. I definitely felt that it was a business run by a family and the ambiance reminded me of real Mexico for some reason. 

I had quite a high expectation going in here because of all the yelp reviews I read beforehand and I would say it just met my expectation. I ordered the fish tacos, but I wished it was a little more crispier but the fish inside was very tender and juicy!

The price is reasonable and considering how difficult it is to find a real Mexican restaurant
in Mississauga, I would give them 4/5 stars! :)"}
{"text":"Me and the Mrs. both love this place..  Owner is super friendly, service has always been good to us, and obviously most importantly the food is delicious.  Lots of Mexican diners every time I've been here also, always a good sign 

Guacamole and homemade chips are a must.

Love the carnitas and tacos al pastor with pineapple

Churros for dessert are fantastic 

Best Mexican I've had in Peel that's for sure.  

Had to take a star just because I wish the portions were a bit more generous..  But that definitely isn't a deal breaker

I included lots of pictures"}
{"text":"Just came back from this place and the food was good. You will get your Mexican fix here for sure. Wished I could customize my taco order though. It was hard to eat the fish taco platter and craved something different after the second taco. Everyone who works there is Mexican, including the owner. 

Would recommend to those in the area who can't get downtown TO for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I guess it's okay for Mississauga. Kind of a hole in the wall, not exactly a fast food establishment but also not the nicest dine in restaurant I've been to. Not very busy on the weeknight we went. Menu seemed very traditional and home made. I had the fish tacos - recommended by insauga - they were alright - borderline good. I've had better at the Wilcox just up the street from Border MX, and if you've been downtown - amazing fish tacos at grand electric and barrio coreano. My friend ordered the tampiquiena, he liked it. 

Overall, experience wasnt horrible - but wasnt good enough for me to ever return. Good to try once."}
{"text":"Out shopping (gross), I got a hankering for Mexican food, and Border MX was the best rated option that came up.

Overall, food was pretty good (chimichanga al pastor, flag enchilladas, and guacamole and chips) - though it was really slow coming out (despite not being busy), and the enchiladas were not as hot as my missus expected they would be. That said, drinks (including really good micheladas) were good, the guac was excellent, and overall, we left pretty happy (they Yelp special churros were a nice touch) - not an area I'm in a lot, but definitely impressed me with the authenticity - it was just the lag and the temperature of the food that was a little off."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing my fiancé and I order the Baja fish, shrimp tacos and chicken fajitas. AMAZING!!! Yummy!!!!! X 10 we also had a red sagaria and pina colada great mixed drinks. 
The sever was slow but very polite and professional!  I will recommend this little spot to friends and family, pricing was reasonable and worth it!"}
{"text":"Pretty good flavors for the food, went in 30min before closing for a quick grab. Nanchos was very crispy and tacos was well flavored with the basa fish. 
Churros was of a pink color inside not sure why, but still very good the taste the texture. Had it free thanks to yelp coupon great customer service. 

only thing i didn't like is when i showed one of the server the coupon on my phone he took my phone saying he needs to look at it- which is fine. But i can see he keep scrolling on my profile without asking which i didnt appreciate.
Since it was my yelp profile, i didnt make a big deal out of it but if he did go into my phone then that's a big No no. So be careful when u hand in your phone for coupons there"}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous review. I've been here 3 times now, and it gets better every single time. 

The first time I went with one of my girlfriends and we ordered taquitos, a variety of tacos: fish, carnitas, and chicken, enchiladas in flag sauce, and chicken flautas. The tacos and enchiladas were all amazing and flavourful, I highly recommend the tacos if it's your first time here! The taquitos and Flautas were OK, it has room for improvement. I love the crispy texture of both dish but the Taquitos was bland but then again there's no meat, if there was chicken or pork then I think that would be better. The Flautas were good but not memorable in my opinion. It's a generous portion, a little too much sour cream and lettuce. 


 Second time I went there, my boyfriend and I ordered Tostada, fish tacos, and the Enchiladas in Mole sauce. Tostadas were nice and crispy but very heavy. I ate about 4 bites and I was stuffed! Fish tacos were obviously bomb digitty! The enchiladas were amazing after 5 bites then the sauce really gets too overwhelming. I know the enchiladas with mole sauce are traditionally served on a pool of sauce but I really wished I had the sauce on the side. Oh, and I can not forget the Tamarind Water!! You have to try it! The owner makes it fresh everyday with fresh tamarinds!! My boyfriend and I are hooked on it!!

My boyfriend and I decided to go again the following week and we ordered the Fish Tacos (that's our usual!), and I ordered one shrimp taco, fish taco, and their newest taco..... The beef tongue taco. I know people will automatically be turned off but I say don't knock it until you've tried it! Oh man was it tender and soft!!!!! Packed full of flavour. I also would like to point out that the shrimp taco was PERFECTO! Juicy, and perfectly cooked, the pineapple just gives it a sweet background which I love! And we can't forget the tamarind water! Mmm. Lastly we had to try the churros and it was okay, my only issue with churros is I don't like it sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon, I like it with a light dusting of powdered sugar or nothing at all. It came with a side of caramel sauce which I thought was pretty good. 

This place is great when your craving traditional Mexican food and don't want to go downtown. I've never been here when it gets really busy, so if you go and order three different individual tacos on a busy time they're most likely not going to do it for you. I've been on a slow time all three times and that's why I order a variety of tacos."}
{"text":"We actually went to the Streetsville location on Saturday night without a reservation. It was full inside and on the patio but we were able to get seated within minutes when we pointed out a table for 4....they had said we would have a 20-30 minute wait. Not sure why they gave a couple a table for 4 when there was a table for 2 empty.
The service was friendly but slow. Our server was new. We ordered 2 orders of guacamole and the server brought us one larger bowl and a small bowl with only one basket of chips. We asked why and she said the smaller one is less $. We told her we wanted both full orders and enough chips that all 4 of us could reach.
The food took a long time to arrive but once it did, it was excellent. Very flavourful and tasty.
Very casual decor with wood tables and simple chairs and we had to ask for our cutlery and water.
The menu has plenty of vegetarian options and some items have flour tortillas and others have corn tortillas, so you can get gf."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican spot! The chimichanga with a side of cilantro rice and beans will always be my go-to meal here, but the tacos and quesadillas are to die for! I would also suggest trying their horchata if you've never had it before. Staff was absolutely great."}
{"text":"First time coming here & we had the worst experience possible with a dose of food poisoning shortly after. 

We went for Cinco de Mayo, so it was really hard to get a table (especially since there are only 8-10 seats in the whole restaurant). We snuck in at a good time but boy oh boy did we have to WAIT for everything. 20 mins to order, 25 mins to receive our drinks, 20 mins to receive our food, another 12 mins to get cutlery to eat said food, 15 to have plates cleared and a final 10 mins to get the bill. In case you weren't doing the math, we spent just under 2 hours waiting for one thing or the other. 

I ordered a Lime Bulldog. It came with no salt around the rim and no lime like it was advertised, plus they charged me an extra $2 for it on top of the already pricey $11 with no explanation. 

Any of our requests were ignored. We would have had better luck getting our waiters attention if we attached a rope and caribeaner to his pants and gave it a tug when we needed him. 

When our waters came, there was black stuff floating in each of them so we flagged down our waiter & he explained it was probably just lime, because they use a lot of lime in the back. Limes aren't black last time I checked.. and he didn't even exchange them. 

The baja fish tacos we ordered labelled as the \"best in Mississauga\" were a let down. It came with a spoonful of fried rice & refried bean which I didn't touch. It could have been the beans that caused my boyfriend to have severe diarrhea and vomiting for the last two days. TMI? Needed to be said. 

When all was said and done the meal cost us $50!!!!!! Are you serious?!?! If I didn't have a soul I would have walked out without paying, that's how bad it was. 

From the other reviews this place seems decent on a typical day and I wish I could go easy on them for it being a very busy night for them, but a Mexican celebration comes but once a year (in Canada). How were you not prepared for this? That two star rating is for the pity I felt for the workers being pushed to their limits."}
{"text":"My friend lived in Arizona for over 15 years so, when she found Border MX, she was excited as it had reminded her of a restaurant out in Tucson. After hearing that, I knew I had to go with her and try it.

Three of us went on a Friday evening and it was busy. When one table left, quickly new patrons would come in and grab it up. It's not the poshest place but it does deliver on the taste and quality of the food. I started with a frozen lime margarita, which was heaven in a glass. Then I had a Sangria, which wasn't bad but I've definitely had better. We all shared the fresh homemade chips and guacamole and, of course, could not get enough so we ordered a second batch.

My friend (the one who lived out in Arizona) and I both ordered the fish tacos. They were a decent size and we were both struggling to finish the last one. The slaw had that nice acidity, which cut away from the richness of the beer batter. My only complaint is that one piece of fish was a bit soggy. The rice that came with the dish was not very flavourful and it was served at room temperature as opposed to hot. There was a Mexican bean soup that came with the order as well. It was emulsified into a thick liquid and it had some bacon and Mexican spices that I've never tried before - simply divine! Our other friend ordered some type of chicken burrito and she was raving over every bite.

Service was friendly, it had a nice atmosphere and the prices were decent. One thing I would suggest to them is to provide paper napkins as opposed to the small non-absorbent cloth ones as tacos can obviously get quite messy."}
{"text":"Without trying to sound too aggressive, I would like to say this is the best Mexican restaurant in Mississauga! I found out about this place while I was driving down Hurontario and Dundas and saw this in a small plaza. When I went there for the first time I was greeted by the owner who was very helpful in describing some of the menu items, he even taught my guest and I some words in Spanish! I ended up having the 'Wet Burrito\" with Chicken which I found to be pretty good! You are able to pick different spice levels (1-5 I believe), I ended up going with 4 as the owner stated 5 is extremely hot (which it was as he gave me the sauce on the side). The Chicken wasn't overcooked and had a good texture to it which made it enjoyable to eat. The only issue I could say I found was the portions; and I feel this is an issue with all Mexican restaurants. I didn't seem to get full of my main order so I ended up going for dessert to fill myself up. For dessert I had the Churros which were pretty good and fresh tasting, I would skip the \"dipping sauce\" that is provided as it is way too sweet. All in all, it is a very good restaurant and I would definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Awesome little mexican spot here run by actual authentic mexicans FTW! its definately a cute spot. 

I came here with my mom for lunch and i ordered the Chicken flautas which are deep fried rolled up taquitos that came with rice and pinto beans. My mom got the beer battered shrimp tacos with rice and pinto beans which i tried and it was too good. My plate was also really good and tasted authentic. The prices are tiny bit over the top i find but for authentic mexican food its worth it. I also got the Flan for dessert and for those who dont know its made from eggs and caramel and oh so tasty...a bit small but the presentation was nice. The service here is very good and the waiter was really knowledgable about the menu which is always a good sign if you're not sure what to order. The place is a bit small and cozy and definately gets busy on the weekends so just a heads up for all you weekend crawlers. This place definately has that hispanic warmth to it and its a great spot to check out...i totally recommend it. 

Hasta la vista good food :)"}
{"text":"We came as a group of 6 and all loved this place. The food was amazing and authentic Mexican (not the typical Westernized style you get at other places), and our server was extremely friendly and accommodating to all of us. I got the grilled chicken chimichanga and it was delish!  Everything was freshly made to your liking. Make sure to also get dessert! I had the churros (authentic Mexican style, not typical Spanish style) and was amazing, and some of the others got the Impossible Cake which was amazing too. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A cute little spot.. it's in a weird location but the sangria pitchers were very generous and the food was surprisingly delicious for the really cheap price"}
{"text":"I ordered the fish tacos and carnita burrito to go. I'm assuming this place is authentic since all the customer around me were speaking Spanish. I'm not a huge fan of authentic Mexican food, but I keep trying it anyway. If this is true Mexican then I am now a convert. The balance of all the flavors was perfect.

The many staff are very friendly. It is a bit slow as it seems that there is only one person doing the cooking.

PS - the food did have that Big Mac taste as mentioned in another review. I'm not sure if this is why i liked the food lol but I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food here was great. We had a wet burrito and fajitas. Both very good and you could taste how fresh the ingredients are. Wish we tried the Baja tacos as that seemed like a popular dish and saw a a lot people ordering them. Will definitely be eating here again. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Nice little surprise.  Very good food and friendly service.  One complaint, restaurant was pretty cold."}
{"text":"We visited the brand new Streetsville location.  We didn't know upon arrival that it was their very 1st day open to the public.  So considering that, my review will need a follow up visit.  The service was very friendly and welcoming.  The place is very small so it gets crowded very easily.  Service was a little inattentive and it took a long time to get food.  Only 2 of the 3 dishes arrived.  The 3rd was quite late coming.  However, it was the 1st night and it was quite busy.  The food was not and delicious.  Price was fair for what we got.  This is not texmex style food.  This is good old Mexican home cooking.  If you're in a hurry give it a miss.  But if you don't mind slow  (but kind) service then give this a try."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  The food is delicious and made to order.  The space is small and busy, so be prepared to wait...especially on the weekend.  They have a large tequila/ margarita menu...so be ready for some good drinking.  The waitstaff is super friendly and proficient.  If you want good authentic Mexican food then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Great place for authentic Mexican food. We ordered the Cabos Nachos, Crispy Quesadillas and Pork Carnitas tacos. I was worried that the tacos wouldn't be filling as other places I've been, the tacos have been quite small with barely any filling. However, I was pleasantly surprised as these tacos had a generous amount of pork which was tender and moist, not dry at all."}
{"text":"Great mexican hidden gem downtown Mississauga. The staff was friendly and gave us some great options on menu. We tried the chicken enchiladas, baja fish tacos, taquitos and chips with salsa. Everything tasted fresh and authentic. Mango margarita was super delicious. Food came out quick and we enjoyed every bite. I would recommend this place for an authentic experience. The music and ambiance put the icing on the cake - felt the need to book a trip to Mexico after coming here!!"}
{"text":"Our server could talk his way in or out of anything. Ordered his recommendation - deep fried burritos iirc - and a kind of spring roll with guacamole. It was very nice, good calls by our server. Was a good price and the churros from the check in came late but was sooooo worth it. I think next time I would order more guac w the spring rolls if I got it again since it was a bit dry"}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant after reading about it on the InSauga blog. It was a quaint little place on the side of Hurontario.

Parking was a little difficult because it's right beside the road and there are very limited spots to park where the lot is shared by a strip of restaurants and stores. 

Border MX was a small restaurant with a friendly atmosphere. There was Mexican music playing and you could sit wherever you wanted. The restaurant had a take out option too so it was very casual.

My sister and I decided to try to fish tacos and chicken flautus. Our waiter was very nice and polite and was prompt to bring us menus and water. The tacos were delicious with the fish fried just right. The flautus could've been done better in my opinion, they were a little dry and small for the amount we were paying for them. 

If you want a quick eat for Mexican, opt for the take out line but sitting and enjoying the atmosphere and good service makes for a nice night as well."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've had to date! I instantly fell in love with this place. The first bite I will remember forever. I need to go back...again and again. Must try entire menu."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review because my experience from my last visit varied soo much.  Over the weekend, I wasn't AS impressed with the service/food.

First, I noticed that apps are being pushed.  That is absolutely fine as I'm in sales, I know they're open to make money.  However, I felt as though I wasn't sure if they understood that I didn't want anything due to the slight language barrier.

Chicken Enchiladas - was alright, but came with $1 guac that I never ordered.  I didn't say anything 'cause 1) it's $1 and 2) the portion was OK.  The side of Mexican rice wasn't as fresh this time.  It was dry!  And instead of the $1 guac, I wished that I had gotten beans.

So SPELL OUT the sides that you want or else you may receive $1 guac!  Guac seemed to be from a mix, didn't have that same green colour as when you make it from scratch.  It was alright, but I can make better.

What I did enjoy from the enchiladas were the corn tortillas - loved the corn taste - and the seasoned chicken that was stuffed inside.

My bf had to veg burrito which - to me sounded gross - but he liked it.  There were chunks of diced veg that was NOT from a frozen package.  His burrito also came with a $1 guac...that he never ordered.  

When ordering, he did ask about whether or not he could get guacamole in his burrito, but when the waiter stated that there'll be an extra charge, he declined it, but it was still brought to our table.

I noticed that the tables/benches were dirtier this time with pieces of food/rice on the chairs.  Windows are also grimy so I think as a diner it would make me feel better if they were cleaned once in a while."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times, so this review is based on overall experience.
I tend to get lengthy with my reviews.  I'll keep it blunt.

Nachos-  great.  Good size portion for an appetizer.  Meat is well seasoned.  Chips are freshly fried.  A little skimpy on the side condiments (pico de gallo and guac). 

Fish Tacos- Excellent.  Often times a matter of taste.  A lot of people prefer a meatier fish for their fish tacos.  I prefer a lighter, flakier fish with a milder \"fishy\" taste.  I'm not sure what fish they use, but I assume a basa or cod.  Good sized portion for the price.  Not overly greasy.  Had to ask for the lime for acidity.  Not sure if they forgot or if they normally do not serve it with lime.  Either way- tartness is a must for me with a fish taco. 

Chimichanga- Not their strongest dish, but satisfying.  Crispy, but greasy.  I have a huge appetite, but I could not finish this dish.  I read another review that said that the sauce they use in the ground beef chimi tastes like big mac sauce.  I'd have to say that's a spot on description.
This gets a mark between a \"meh\" and an \"OMG\".

All shortcomings in the meal are forgivable and this place should warrant closer to a 5 star rating, however it loses marks for the temperature.  It's very difficult to enjoy a meal to its max potential if you're not comfortable, and this place is hot! Loses a star for that.

I shall return again and again.."}
{"text":"We took a risk and picked a Mexican place not close to us based on the ratings on Yelp.  We read that the portions were good and the flavor was too.  We were NOT disappointed.  I had the flag enchiladas, a great mix of flavors, it was very good!  We also had chips and salsa, not my favorite but decent.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican tacos, burritos and fajitas.  Bad parking and slow service.  Be prepared to watch half an hour of La Liga match in low resolution in Spanish before your food arrives."}
{"text":"The chicken enchiladas with the FLAG sauce were great; nice portion size too.
The Fautas were tasty; came with salad and a small portion of refried beans and rice.
The staff are super friendly. I love that this place is so close to me; will definitely go back. My ONLY complaint is that my food could have been a little hotter 
temperature-wise."}
{"text":"My best friend and I wanted to try something new and literally I was craving for Mexican food.

We went here because I read so much good reviews. Upon arrival we realized that it was a very date like atmosphere type place, and I was totes not down for that, that day.

We were too lazy and cold to do take out and go back to eat at his place so we still stayed in. I must say that food was good, but nothing really out of the ordinary. I did however notice there drink selection and I would be inclined to go back, granted I am going for food and drinks. 

I would definitely recommend the chips and guac. it was a good appetizer before the big meals we had."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved loved loved this place! 
Such an unexpected gem in Mississauga. 
Real authentic Mexican food! And huuge portions. 
The tacos were to die for. The service was great. 120% going back asap!"}
{"text":"Came here about two days ago and found the place to be quite accessible. There's plenty of parking and there's entrance either through the mall or from the outside. 

The inside is cute and quaint; it's nicely done up although I think some might find the decorations a bit tacky. As a Latina I'm gonna tell you right now that the decorations are very typical of what you would find at parties, LOL.

We had a server named Jorge who was quite nice and very attentive. If you have any questions regarding items on the menu he's more than happy to explain what it is and the type of dish to expect.

I ordered the 12\" chorizo quesadilla which I found to be delicious and the quesadilla itself perfectly toasted. However, I will echo a few sentiments already posted previously here: one, they don't explain that the guacamole is an up-sell. It's only $1 extra, but you don't get THAT much of it. Tasty, either way. Secondly, the rice that comes with certain dishes on the side is a bit dry and doesn't have much flavour to it. Either re-vamp it, or nix it.

My other half ordered the Baja tacos (fish) which apparently is their best-seller on the entire menu. They're quite small and you get 3 of them, although they are SUPER tasty! However, for the price, maybe throw in a 4th taco and take out that dry side rice the dish comes with.

For someone who is not a huge fan of tacos or Mexican food in general, for a first-time visit, this place won me over. Points for ample parking and being close to home.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The staff is so pleasent...i told the waiter about my horrible fish taco experience at two other places she didnt brag she just asked me to let her know. Food speaks for itself in this case. The baja tacos are so full of flavor. im not a cilantro fan and the slaw wasnt over filled will cilantro. Im so happy i found this place..i only wish i had made two orders instead of just the one soooo delishious!!!"}
{"text":"I would say it's terrible service, but I would have had to receive some form of service to say that. I came in with my sister and waited to be seated, but eventually we sat ourselves after 10 minutes. We waited for a server and nobody came even though we saw the server go to another table. The kitchen staff clearly saw us and did not attend to us. I'd also like to point out that the restaurant was not busy at all. In fact, a group of four patrons came in and also had to seat themselves. They waited quite a bit of time as well. We made eye contact with the server several times thought she would come over, but she never did. We even tried to wave the kitchen staff, but to no avail. Absolutely horrendous. The staff should be ashamed of themselves. We left after 30 minutes and even told the kitchen staff how long we waited. They said they didn't see us. Lazy and liars. Never come here."}
{"text":"I was excited to learn that there was an authentic Mexican restaurant in the area, so my friends and I went for dinner. In my opinion if there is one under-rated cuisine in Canada, it is definitely Mexican/Latin cuisine. Perhaps I am just not looking in the right place.

Border MX is a pretty good representation and a local place to get my mole on. Our group ordered mostly enchiladas or fish tacos, but everything on the menu sounded great.
The mole sauce is delish, the beans are creamy and the portions are reasonable.

The server was friendly, charming and very helpful. Yes, he did try to convince us on the chips and guac without mentioning there was a charge. I'm of two minds about this. Yes it is uncool to make it sound like that option is included with your meal. But to be fair, who honestly believes that a family run business would be giving out free chips and guac?

My complaints:

- They had no diet coke on the night we went. I know, first world problems...
- My meal was served, at best, lukewarm.
- The chairs are the most uncomfortable I have ever had the displeasure to sit on.

Overall, I will be back to Border MX. I'm a sucker for mole."}
{"text":"We LOVE authentic Mexican food and this place delivered!  The service was great as was the atmosphere.  There's so many other dishes on the menu for us to try we will be back soon and probably often!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying: This is some GOOD STUFF. 

We were a group of three guys meeting up after a long time. We had the cabos nachos with chorizo, which were perfect. The freshly made chips really shined through. We also had the baja fish tacos. In one word: perfection. These are to die for. The fish was crispy but not greasy at all. The acidity of the coleslaw really balanced out the crispy battered fish. The reason why I'm not giving this five stars is because the steak tacos weren't that great. The thinly sliced beef was a bit on the dry side. The chicken tinga tacos were not bad. But the baja fish tacos are truly out of this world. Next time I feel like we'll just order three orders of the fish tacos.

Service is extremely friendly as well. We spent around two hours here and loved every second of it.

Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for proper Mexican food in the Mississauga area.

Edit: Forgot to mention that they offer hot sauces on the side that come in five different levels of heat. We chose the middle level and guess what: it was still pretty hot! So be careful. You've been warned. I have a feeling that they doubted our ability to consume the level 3 hot sauce because we had to ask them several times before it was provided to us ;)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for AUTHENTIC Mexican food, this is THE spot to go to in the city! If you want Tex-Mex; look elsewhere. 

I see a lot of other reviewers whose complaints stem from exactly what I said above; they are use to Tex Mex and not authentic Mexican food. 

My three favorites appetizers here are : Elote (grilled street corn), sopes and taquitos. The grilled corn is a must when offered on special, the cheese and cayenne pepper make for a great app. The taquitos are some of the best I've had, very crunchy with succulent ingredients. Sopes have a great thickness and just enough ingredients so nothing falls apart. 

You can't really go wrong with any of the mains. What is important is your meat choice, I suggest either Pastor or Carnita when choosing between tacos, burritos, etc. because both are very well seasoned and balanced. The meat is still very moist and not dry at all, with fresh vegetables to go with it. 

Make sure you finish off with the churros!! 

Great tequila selection also."}
{"text":"I really enjoy mexican food, it's probably a top 3 cuisine for me and BMX delivers. 

Tried:

Cabos nachos. Really satisfying, large portions with fresh ingredients. Highly recommend.

Enchiladas with red, white and green sauce. Extremely appealing visually and the flavour matches the appearance. Moist meat inside and the sauces were very flavourful. Really enjoyed the red and green sauces. Very filling meal.

Overall enjoyed the food and the service was great, would come back again."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Best Mexican I have had in a very long time!!! 
Have been searching for a great place that rivels the quality of places Arizona and California I have finally found it. Try everything! The owners are super nice :)"}
{"text":"Loved it! This is my New Mexican go to. I had the chimichanga and it was delicious. I couldn't stop eating the guacamole and the refried beans. Staff is great!"}
{"text":"Me and my date came here last night, the service was prompt and friendly, the food was excellent! I just wish there was hot sauce. He ordered the churros after and they were so good with the caramel, it's a very social atmosphere so don't expect any romantic vibes to be flying"}
{"text":"I came in with hopes for real Mexican food as there are not many authentic Mexican places in Ontario. I did try El Sombrero but was not happy with the restaurant concept, whereby it's more fast food, but the food was good. 
This restaurant is pretty small but just when you enter you can know that the food has a chance of being more authentic than Chipotle and Taco Bell, since all the servers and chefs spoke Spanish and from their menu choices, such as tamales and mole sauce. 
The service was given with a smile, which was a plus point. 
I wanted the corn tortilla quesadilla as offered in the menu, however, they only had the flour tortilla kind. I therefore opted for the chicken soft tacos. These tacos were a bit bland, but the hot sauce they gave on the side made these tacos delicious. Their serving sizes aren't that generous, whereby it will satisfy your hunger but not fill you up, which is good if you need room for their authentic mexican desserts.
Therefore, this restaurant is good and it's likely that I will return whenever I get the cravings for good mexican food. But if I am starving I would rather go to El Sombrero as their serving sizes are gigantic."}
{"text":"MAYYYYYNNNN these guys are the REAL DEAL. First bit is that the place makes u feel like uve stepped into another country, Love the decor and the feelin. Food is AMAZING!! Its AUTHENTIC mexican food, So DAMN GOOD. Ordered the Fish Tacos, Beef Chimichanga and Green Enchiladas! I am definitely sold and will be returning again. Its a great spot and it makes me want to put on a mexican bad boy hat and do a DANCE! You can trust me on this one."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Baja Fish Tacos were . The flag enchiladas were good, the nachos were good, but when I go again I'm going straight to the Baja Fish Tacos. One thing I wasn't a fan of was the horchata, it was way too strong"}
{"text":"We ordered the sopes, enchiladas (chicken) and tacos (ground beef). Delicious! We finished with a piece of flan and it was one of the best we've had. Nice restaurant too."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food. Great hospitality. Server was very accommodating. Music was a bit loud. But I was transported to Mexico"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim after doing a quick search of best tacos in Mississauga.

The inside was casual and nice.  Our server was great - very affable and very patient/knowledgeable when we asked any questions. 

We first ordered chorizo nachos, but got chicken instead.  Not a big deal - it was very tasty but it wasn't a very big portion IMO.  Especially for 4 people. 

I will give 5 stars to their hot salsa though.  We got the hottest available and it was not only delicious but actually hot!  I can't count how many restaurants I have been to that warn me about how hot their hottest sauce is, only to find it pretty average.  Their hot salsa is HOT.  IF you can't handle the heat be careful. 

I got the fish tacos and these were another 5 star dish IMO.  Absolutely delicious - in fact maybe the best fish tacos I have had anywhere.  Again portion size wasn't great though, the three tacos were nice but the sides were kind of lacking.  Such a small rice portion IMO. 

Overall I will definitely go back because those fish tacos are on my mind!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I went there for my birthday as i was craving for Mexican food. We had made reservations and when we arrived we were seated immediately. However, we soon found out that the service thereafter was extremely slow. We ordered for nachos which took 45 mins to come. They were really bland with no taste. Next we ordered for baja fish tacos, crispy chicken tinga tacos and some veggie tacos. Again the order took 45-50 mins to come. The fish tacos were kind of ok but the rest of the food was just meh. Needless to say i am not visiting again."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for date night and had a great time and great food, fish tacos were excellent, mojito and jalapeño margarita were made perfectly. Staff are friendly, explained every dish and drink for us and made sure we were happy both during and after our meal. The restaurant environment was very clean and organized, we enjoyed Mexican music during our meal. Overall a great place for a quick bite or a long meal. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"The food & atmosphere is amazing. It's a must try if you want some authentic Mexican food"}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly staff and awesome dishes. Been here 4 times and never had something I didn't like. Literally everything, margaritas, soups, nachos, burritos, taco and churros - all good!"}
