{"text":"This is officially my favorite place to spend a lazy Saturday morning. Not only does Matcha offer a wide variety of tea options, they offer a selection of extremely unique and delicious pastries. The venue is very laid back and the service is spectacular. Each time I come here, I always discover a new favorite tea and learn something new! They do not have wifi on the weekends, so be ready to unplug and take full advantage of the best tea house in all of Madison."}
{"text":"How did I not know about this little jewel on Johnson? My colleague and I stopped in for a late working lunch (I had no idea that Macha served food!). The interior is really cool, inviting, and packed with all sorts of interesting people. Although Macha offers only a limited daily menu of Asian fusion-type fare, their selections look scrumptious and unique. I chose the teriyaki and bulgogi street tacos and my colleague had a bun noodle bowl with meatballs. Rave reviews all around. To top it all off, I enjoyed a ginger-turmeric tea confection that was really delicious--along with a matcha chocolate chip cookie. YUM!"}
{"text":"I almost don't want to write a review for Macha Tea Company because I love the vibe and how low-key it is and I don't want that to change... but not giving it a review because I love it is a silly reason. 

Anyways on to why I love Macha. First off, I'm a very regular coffee drinker and I'm embarrassed to say that I used to never order tea when I was out. My mentality was why would I pay $2-3 for a cup of hot water and a tea bag that I could have at home for 10 cents? While I still believe that to a certain extent, Macha is in a whole different league than cafes that sell bagged tea. The amount of attention and precision they put into selecting their tea, and then brewing it, is fun to watch and makes for a delicious cup of tea to drink. 

In addition to traditional hot teas, they also have some cold drinks on tap like their turmeric tonic, and they make soup-ed up tea drinks like their machiatto (delicious) and chai (still need to try).

They have a wall that has most of their tea leaves in little containers so you can smell them to get an idea of what they'll taste like and the staff there is always more than happy to tell you about what teas they recommend or help you find a tea that matches what you're looking for. 
I also think it's super handy how they have a sticker on their loose leaf tea containers that tell you how much to use, what temperature your water should be at, and how long to steep your tea for.

I've come in to buy gifts a few times and loved their selection of tea pots, cups, tea containers, etc.

In addition to the baked goods they have every day (i.e. the delicious matcha chocolate chip cookies), they serve lunch on Friday and brunch on Sunday. Their menu changes weekly so check their instagram if you wanna see what they're gonna be serving! When I went for brunch we got the mapo tofu and pork doniburi bowl. Both were really good- super flavorful, made with fresh ingredients, and they tasted homemade. Honestly probably one of the best Asian-esque meals I've had in Madison.

I could go on and on about all the things I love about Macha but instead I'll just let you check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Delicious baked goods plus an awesome selection of tea. I've tried their zucchini chocolate cupcakes and their Macha chocolate chip cookies - both were fantastic. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is modern and westernized, yet also pulling on East Asian roots. The desserts at the counter were of diverse flavors, like matcha cupcakes with red bean filling, and I so much had to resist.

I had a pot of green tea whose specific name I can't remember, but the descriptor was nutty. It was definitely a more Savory tea, and I enjoyed how knowledgeable the man working behind the counter was about these various teas. 

Definitely will be coming back, this is such a cool space to have an afternoon tea!"}
{"text":"Cute place serving quality teas, and the perfect alternative to coffee shops for studying and hanging out in (except there's no wifi).  When we walked in, we were almost immediately offered a ceramic cup of tea to sample. Had a great time walking around and admiring the teapots and matcha prep equipment."}
{"text":"Great macha, atmosphere, and staff. Was on a walk and stopped here--would have been a great place and neighborhood in which to linger."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and tea today. I got the macchiato which was delicious. We tried two dishes, one was the chicken and waffle stew. This was savory and hearty, perfect for a rainy day. We also got Chinese sausage don buri. I highly recommend. While sitting at the tea bar, one of the owners made us some extra tea to try which was great. I will definitely be back, don't miss their Friday lunch!!"}
{"text":"This place has quickly become my hangover cure. The atmosphere is great, and Anthony is super knowledgeable when it comes to his teas and their origins. If you don't know the first thing about tea, the people working there will help you decide something, and are always pouring samples of other teas for you to try (sit at the bar if you can!). Even if you're super into tea, I'm sure Anthony will tell you something you didn't know. Overall just an awesome experience every time!"}
{"text":"If you want teenagers to boss around, try another spot. The owners here are passionate and incredibly knowledgeable. These guys are caretakers of the tea making. Want to know the differences between Chinese, Japanese, and Korean teas? Matcha's got you covered. The baked goods are unique, delicious, and perfectly matched. And there's a tea bar with better service and conversation than most beer bars I've seen.

I suppose they don't offer the breadth of services that a corporate place does, but if you came here for you you're totally missing the point. If you love tea or want to love tea, come to Matcha."}
{"text":"Fantastic place if you are into matcha tea. Owners are so knowledgeable and Helpful-I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I really, really, REALLY like this place. The tea list is impressive, and they'll keep refilling your hot water as long as you want to sit and hang. 

The food is DAMN good. I got a lovely Indian-style lentil dish with cashews. And also a ban bun. It was more than I could eat comfortably in one sitting - but I managed. I'm Yelp Elite, after all - that means I'm a champ.

The atmosphere here is standout - people are friendly, staff are kind, patient and knowledgeable, and the bathroom is ADORABLE (one-holer. very clean. painted beautifully). One thing to be aware of: If you pay by credit card, there's no option to leave a tip - so bring cash for tipping at least.

If you need a fun, off-beat gift, this is also a fun spot to shop. They have tea pots, tea cups, t-shirts (tea shirts? ha!) and other accoutrements. 

It's the perfect spot to sit and chill with a pal and talk about existential things over a warm beverage in comfy coziness. 5 stars to Matcha!"}
{"text":"Made my first trip here on a quiet weekday. I was excited about a matcha tea place in Madison, but looking at yelp, I expected food as well. To my surprise, food is only available on FRIDAY and SUNDAY Brunch with menus posted the night before. 

Worker was very adamant to follow their Instagram @machateacompany to get updates (will post the menus the day before). 

Ambience: The atmosphere is nice and quiet. Mainly bar seating but a couple of 2-seater tables on the side. The shop products are displayed nicely and I like how the descriptions are clear for their items. 

TEA: My friend got the Matchiato hot which was delicious! We also ordered loose leaf tea (forgot the specific type) but it also tasted good and warmed us up on the chilly night! Presentation was simple and elegant (pictured). 

Dessert: There wasn't much selection the day I went, maybe because of a slow weekday and they only had a small red bean pastry available for $3 which I thought was pretty overpriced. 

I think I would come back again but would really love if they had a consistent bakery menu. It's hard to find matcha flavored/inspired dessert in Madison!"}
{"text":"This is a charming place for people who care a bit too much about their tea. I kid, of course, because there is no such thing! And the attention these people pay to the tea can only mean an amazing cup for the customer.

I got their Matchiato (sp?), which is a matcha latte. Very good, with the mild bitterness of matcha permeating a cup of steamed milk. I also tried their high-end hot matcha, which for $8 you get about a half cup's worth of tea and two cookies. But the tea used to make the matcha is top-notch - that fragrance you expect in matcha is on full display - and they do not skimp on the leaves either. I also perused their loose leaf collection. They have a very eclectic selection of teas that they source attentively, which here means that they don't carry the most popular and prestigious Chinese and Indian varieties and instead look out more interesting and cheaper alternatives. Finally, they carry all the equipment for matcha and tea making, in case you wanted to take the store home with you.

A note of warning: their WiFi is sporadically unavailable. While I understand and tend to sympathize with their motivation, people should definitely be forewarned before they decide to take a long stay at the place. Combined with the paucity of seating, I would recommend stopping by the counter to savor a drink, talking with the tea barista(?), and then leaving. Or perhaps a date?"}
{"text":"I'm absolutely in love with Macha Tea Company. I love everything about this place, no complaints. Sat at the counter Sunday afternoon and ordered the vegan bowl which was so delicious. I also got to sample some of their different teas. There's so many different teas here, they even have alcoholic drinks made with sake! There's a variety of green, white, black, oolong, herbal... the list goes on. Just tell them what you're in the mood for and they'll pick something out just for you. Food, drinks, and service get five stars."}
{"text":"I have been trying to come here for some time-- I am a huge tea advocate; literally have tea time tattooed on my knuckles-- let me say, this joint did not disappoint!!

I arrived for a pop up brunch, was pleased to see the variety of high quality teas available for purchase; sampled the matchiatto, turmeric tonic, and the white peony sangria. 

Whoever was making these beverages definitely respected the ingredient. The service was fast, hospitable, and super friendly.

I can't wait to make this a place a regular visit when I move to Madison in August!"}
{"text":"Amazing first experience! I will definitely visit again. I loved the ambience of the shop and the tea was soooo delicious."}
{"text":"They're BACK!

Once located in a cozy two-story converted home on Monroe Street, Macha Tea Co is back in action with a retail storefront on East Johnson Avenue. They've got a full tea bar, a kitchen to produce all of their tasty baked goods (many of which are gluten-free!), some tables and chairs for those who like to linger and enjoy their tea, and of course, their teas and teaware available for sale as well.

While they finish getting their kitchen up and running, they've been having pup-up lunches (get it while it's available!) a couple of days a week, and hope to expand to more regular hours in early 2016. In the meantime, keep an eye on their Facebook page for details on hours and offerings.

(They're planning a formal grand opening in early February 2016.)

I went to their Monroe St location for years, and it was always a favorite place of mine - there aren't many people in this area that know their tea, and these guys are one of them!

Macha's ambience is excellent, and has always been a lovely oasis from the frigid Wisconsin winters; I hope they're around for years to come."}
{"text":"Great teas, delicious food, incredible service.
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My friend and I were walking to our car from Burnies Rock Shop and passed this cute shop, we HAD to go inside. I am a tea enthusiast and was very pleased with the knowledgeable and passionate staff! I got the Imperial Pearl Oolong and it was AMAZING! I will definitely come again when I'm downtown!"}
{"text":"So glad to see Macha re-open, and even closer to me!  Great tea selection, amazing bakery, well curated collection of tea-ware for your shopping pleasure.  Follow on social media to learn about food specials.  Sit at the tea bar to chat with Anthony and discover new teas."}
{"text":"Macha Tea Company wins every time.  Anthony has a beverage program unlike any other in the city - it's fresh, interesting, unpretentious and satisfying and while Rachel works wonders w/meat and dairy, her vegan and gluten-free options are not only phenomenal, they never taste like a substitution for something else or an afterthought.  She celebrates ingredients for what they are and can satisfy any type of eater which in my opinion, is the sign of a great chef.  The whole Macha team is always positive, friendly, informative and attentive.  My whole family loves this place!"}
{"text":"Happiness is sitting in a tea shop with a friend, which is exactly what I did last night.  I had been a big fan of the Macha Tea House on Monroe.  So I was happy to get to visit the new location.  Anthony and Rachel (the proprietors) are beautiful and giving people.  They are extremely knowledgeable of the products they sell.  

Anthony got me and my friend set up with our order.  I had a pot of Honey Ginger Green Tea and the Thai Basil cookies.  My pal had Chai and a cupcake.  We also got samples of two teas that the store is proud to have in house.  I really enjoy trying new things so letting me sample new product warms my heart!

Yes, I miss the house-feel of the old location but it's the owners that I would have missed more if Macha had not re-opened.  This is a great place to sit and read or visit with a friend."}
{"text":"Delicious and unique treats and relaxed atmosphere. I got matcha tea cake and a masala chai tea latte. Both were great, and the service was nice too. I would definitely recommend this to any matcha tea enthusiasts."}
{"text":"Always wanted to come to this place!
They have great tea and macha, a very cozy place to hang out with friends and enjoy the afternoon. 
I've always been seeing all those beautiful desserts they've posted on ig and finally got a taste myself today ;)
Their cake, muffin, and scone were all amazing! Not too sweet, and the best part is that you could easily taste all the ingredients that are included in the sweets. Very fresh and yummy. They all paired great with the tea :)"}
{"text":"The service is impeccable & the food is incredible (served on Fri, Sat, Sun). My boyfriend calls Rachel the \"sleeper chef\" in Madison because you wouldn't think of food when you think of a tea house - but the food is delicious. Rach makes health conscious comfort foods that often include gluten-free & vegan options. Everything is perfectly spiced! Anthony makes the tastiest herbal blends & they have the finest tea selection in town. These folks put their passion into their business & it shows. The staff is also super sweet, super on it. The best crew of ladies in Madison, for sure. Give them a visit, you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Excellent tea, food, treats and overall vibe. The staff is always delightful. My favorite place in Madison to have tea and conversation. So thankful this place exists. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I wish I caught the owner's name! He has always taken excellent care of my friends and I both times we came to visit. The first time I came here was last year during my first ever visit to Madison. The desserts and teas we've had here have always been delicious. Specifically, some of my favorite items I've tried was the matcha red bean cupcake and the masala chai tea.

After finally making the move to Madison, I look forward to having many more visits to Macha Tea Company to try out other desserts, drinks, and their weekend brunch/lunch options. Pro tip: follow them on Instagram to see their weekly lunch menus!

Overall, I highly recommend this place for the quality of their food and beverages. Most importantly, their tea is warm, but the service is even warmer. :)"}
