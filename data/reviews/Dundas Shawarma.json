{"text":"Nice fresh veggies and huge amount of food on the shawarma plate. The Saturday special was two plates for $16, which we thought was a pretty good deal. We'll be back to check out the falafel and other offerings."}
{"text":"If you're in the area and hungry, you should drop in and try Ali Baba's falafels for the following reasons:  1) The falafels are made fresh when you order, and your falafel roll or combo (with lentil rice & salads) will be made up with tasty, fresh ingredients.  2) Cheap! I challenge you to hit $10 without getting so much food you'd explode. Very reasonable and portions are excellent, you won't be left wanting. 3) Quick and convenient - either to sit in or to go!  Very reasonable choice for quick, filling & delicious food in the area. I think it could get to 5 stars if I could maybe just get a whole bucket of those falafel balls.. that's reasonable, right?"}
{"text":"This place is fast, fresh, friendly and given the right choices, quite healthy.    They have a patio that is quite useful in the summer.   The owner and all the staff talk to the patrons and illustrate the pride they take in the food.  I usually order the chicken shish-tawook dinner (chicken kebabs).    Add an extra skewer if you're hungry or pinching for some protein.   Lots of flavour in the kebabs mixes nicely with big portions of salads, beets, tomatoes etc.     I've also ordered the fish dinner, which is another winner.   Again the portion is big for the price paid."}
{"text":"I typically dont leave a review based on one visit and one item, but since I dont even live in the same country (and rarely visit Toronto) - I will make an exception.  In need of a late night snack / food item we drove by this place, turned around, parked and walked in. The smells coming from here worked its charm. Like a cartoon character that gets a whiff of something, and then follows the general direction ita coming from, this place lured us in.  I ordered two chicken shawarma sandwiches, one \"hot\", the other not. Got all the fixins and a mango juice to go.   Oh myyyyyyy gaaaawd. This sandwich made me want to go all crazy and whip out my happy dance (in the front seat, feeding my face and coo-ing with excitement). YES it is THAT good.  Fresh, warm grilled chicken. Crisp lettuce. Good bread. Awesome sauce. Happiness!  The hot sauce by no means is hot, it is tasty however. All in all slightly expensive prices, but SO worth it!"}
{"text":"Platters are huge and delicious. Rice is great. One of the best Shawarma places around."}
{"text":"Ali Baba is an excellent choice for a quick, satisfying and fairly cheap Middle Eastern meal.  The food is incredibly fresh. The falafels are made on the spot to order. The shawarmas are also very good.  They have a deal of the deal. I find the 2 for $3.99 falfaels to be a score! Get it every tme!"}
{"text":"The chicken shish tawook platter was nothing impressive -- it came with far too much rice (primarily rice, actually), and the hummus and garlic sauce were plopped on top of the salad (and were mixed together). I basically ate the few pieces of chicken and nothing else.   I also ordered a \"freshly squeezed\" mango juice and got an Ocho Rios-branded bottle of mango-carrot juice consisting of \"40% fresh juice.\"   In sum, I would definitely never order from this place again."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets for fresh Mediterranean food. I've tried nearly everything on their menu and all taste amazing. Falafels, shawarma, all the meat really, has flavour, is fresh and given generously with every meal. Portion sizes are large. Best of all, the owner is there daily and interacts with customers. Customer service is great and food prep is quick as well. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is no longer an Ali Baba's.... it's now called \"Dundas Shawarma\".  This is my favourite shawarma joint in the City. I'm here all the time. Always fresh ingredients, fair portions, DELICIOUS food and the owner is so friendly. There's a patio along the west side of the restaurant, on Markham street, to sit at in the Summertime, which is a nice bonus.  It's no longer an Ali Baba's, however, daily specials are still offered (i.e. 2 beef/chicken shawarma platters for $19.99 on Fridays and Saturdays).  Can't get enough of this place. I would eat here every day if I could...."}
{"text":"Great tasting shawarma.   Chicken was nice and crispy.  Salad was plentiful.  Shop owner was friendly and accommodating.  Class act for a super low price."}
{"text":"So the owner of Dundas Shawarma (formerly an Ali Baba's) is called Ali, but since he left his namesake franchise behind and struck out on his own, he is doing GREAT. He deserves to be successful in his own right--his shawarma is the bomb. I am so lucky that I live just down the street from one of the most reliable shawarma joints in Toronto. Ali is friendly and kind, toppings are fresh and generous, meat is juicy, fresh, and well seasoned (not too salty), prices are reasonable. I don't know what he does to those sandwiches man, but I have never found better anywhere else. I've only ever had the chicken and I should really branch out and try something else, but I just can't resist that juicy chicken sandwich. Also he sells his own pickles--grab a jar on the way out, they are amazing for topping salads, adding to sandwiches or bbq platters at home... anything really. Ali I salute you sir!!! (Now if only you can make a lentil soup as tasty as Falafel Queen I don't ever need to go anywhere else....)"}
{"text":"Such a great find! We were starving and luckily this place was opened ! We went on a Monday and the special was 2 chicken shawarma wraps for one. Additionally, we got samosas and a mango juice. Everything tasted great and was filling. We had enough for a late night meal and then a snack the next day. Definitely worth braving the cold weather for !"}
