{"text":"What a find! Lucy was most helpful and gave me several samples to try after hours!  I had the most delicious latkes! Ate them in the parking lot didn't even make it back to my hotel. It is not a sit down place but a worth the stop to stock your vegan pantry. She is so enthusiastic and I will be back tomorrow! Seriously, I am. Call ahead!"}
{"text":"It's actually not a restaurant, but they have probably the best vegetarian foods out there. Endless types of vegetarian proteins and they even manufacture a lot of stuff themselves. Their veggie chicken/beef potpies are to die for!"}
{"text":"Vegetarians! Next time you're coming home from the airport, build in a stop at Veggie Paradise and stock up on all the best vegan goodies for your pantry. Both soy and Seitan options are available as dried or frozen ingredients, and as frozen takeaway meals. (Can't wait to tuck into that vegan pot pie!) They even have desserts and crazier things like msg-free vegan fish sauce, oyster sauce, and mushroom-based soup stocks. They even have the best vegan bacon I've ever found which I thought was o my available in California, yes! However, the vey best thing about this place is the ladies working there -- super helpful and excited about the food. It's not a restaurant but they prepare ready-to-eat meals for health food stores so they might be able to fill a special request for you. My Asian 'chicken' salad was delectable. I had to take home some of the grilled 'breasts' to experiment with at home. I'm going to start driving people to the airport just so I can stop in more often."}
{"text":"The food here is totally a \"heaven for veggie food\" the owner is so humorous and helpful. The food is from many different cuisines in the world. I am wondering how could she know so many dishes from many countries like that. My best favorite dishes are pot pie and teriyaki, they are the best. Best chef ever!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. and nice clean place.
Not just suitable for group i guess."}
{"text":"Being a vegan its a bit hard to find lunch in my area.

Discovered this place with a quick google search.  The staff are extremely friendly and were a pleasure to deal with.  They recently got setup for takeout which was great news.

I've had a couple of their prepared noodle dishes and both were excellent!  I also purchased a frozen  \"chicken\" pot pie and was quite satisfied with it also.  

As far as desert the tarts were something I'd definitely get again.

Looking forward to trying more of what they have to offer!"}
{"text":"This was a unique experience as I didn't quite know what to expect.  I was in the area and Veggie Paradise came up as one of the non-fast food/chain alternatives and I was feeling adventurous, so...

Veggie Paradise specialises in Veg take-out (call ahead), Frozen/Dried meals and ingredients.  I write \"Veg\" 'cause it may be even Vegan, as opposed to just Vegetarian.  They also do custom vegan/vegetarian cakes/pastries.

This place is run by 2 sisters and their workers.  As soon as Sandra heard that I wanted something to eat, she prepped me with an Asian meal - as opposed to their other meals that are more popular amongst gwai-lo.  Meal comprised of a soup (looked like Tom Yum, but not sweet/spicy), a separate plate with Rice, Bok Choy (chopped with garlic), & a portion of fermented Mustard Greens with Green Peas (this was medium spicy).  The meal was tasty, yet rather homey as it wasn't overly salted.  I really felt like I was eating at an aunt's house!

This place is located in a rather industrial, catering to Vegans/Vegetarians (or people who just enjoy the occasional veg meal), so just call ahead if you want to order something!  The sisters will even offer you a sample if it's available. :)"}
