{"text":"Great take out pizza / pasta with excellent delivery service. Meatballs are great. Give Joe's a try - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't like pizza but Joe's is delicious! I'm glad I tried them, the pizza is amazing and the calzone is HUGE! I get one to split between my two teenage brothers and it is plenty! Great customer service, I tell everyone I know to try it because it is sooo good!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say Italy, but New York/NJ style is close. It's hard to find good pizza in Belmont. Hell, it's hard to find good pizza in Charlotte. Belmont has a few choices other than the chain restaurant crap. I won't speak of the others but Joe's always comes through and they DELIVER. I repeat, they DELIVER. The drivers are awesome and they show kindness (even when we try to steal their pens when signing the receipt). Back to the pizza. The crust flavor is amazing. Pepperoni and cheese is fresh. Sauce is not too bad either. Try the wings. Honestly this place is a good option for good pizza, period. The others in town don't deliver (unless its the chain restaurants, I may be wrong about this). In fact, I've never been to the actual restaurant because they deliver. I wish they were more known in town. If I could only talk the owner into moving into the new complex off Wilkinson. Then it would be an all-out Belmont pizza war. Long story short, if you are tired of the chain restaurant cardboard pizza, skip the competitors and give Joe's a try."}
{"text":"The pizza was not good. Thin in the middle so you could not pick it up. Bacon was just fat, not bacon. I will not order again from here."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but to me, it wasn't what we were looking for.  The outer crust was good and chewy, but the bottom crust was so thin and soggy we couldn't pick up our pizza to eat it and had to use a knife/fork. The cheese and toppings slid right off. This is one of the only pizzas where we didn't save the leftovers because we just didn't like it. The garlic knots were deep fried which we weren't expecting and found disappointing. My 5 year old loved the spaghetti with meat sauce. My kids did share a small cheese pizza and the crust was a little better and less soggy. The workers were all very friendly."}
{"text":"MY ONLY COMPLAINT...I wish the hero's were larger.  8\" is not 12\", and they aren't enough for dinner.  They leave you hungry.  Same could be said of some of the pasta dishes.

Everything else about Joe's is top notch.

Their pizza is very good, and *all* of the toppings are homemade and fresh - something I have never seen in a pizzeria in Belmont, or anywhere else in this area.  Sauce is excellent too...

As to their chicken parmigiana, again, their sauce is homemade, and delicious.  Accompanying pasta was very good too...

The girl who works the counter is top notch.  She has a great attitude, and is very efficient and friendly.  Very nice to deal with...

In short:  Pizza is great; chicken parm is very good.  Topping are fresh, and the quality of cheese is very good.  Just wished some of their pasta and hero's were a bit larger...willing to pay a little more for a slightly bigger hero/pasta dish.

And...I would never get Joe's unless I thought it was clean, and NOTHING about the place has me thinking otherwise.  Place has always been clean."}
{"text":"Googled delivery places near Belmont and this place I've never heard of was the top hit, Tried the spaghetti and meatballs yesterday it was so Delicious I decided to try the pizza today. BOMBDOTCOM. I can't believe it took me this long to find this place. Delivery is super snappy and friendly as well."}
{"text":"SO I have to give this place four stars because they deliver and the food is pretty good. Not my favorite pizza,  it is good but the crust is to thin especially in the middle and it gives out or rips easily under all the cheese and toppings. Which it has a lot of they don't skimp out on toppings here. If it was just for the pizza I would give 3 stars but the subs are good and the calzone is great. My wife loves the pasta also and the dough with powdered sugar desert too. Did I mention they deliver, one of the few places in Belmont that does. Please bring back the wings."}
{"text":"Despite our last negative experience with the rude cashier, we decided to try this place again.

However after our last stop in this past week we will not be back. I watched the pizza guy blow his breath on the dough, I'm not sure what the intent was. But it grossed me out. Then I watched the cashier handle lots of money/debit cards/etc. and then proceed to stick rolls in the oven without gloves. Cooked rolls, not ones cooking from raw. She only stuck them in enough to heat them up, not enough to kill any bacteria.

Good food, poor health conditions, and a cashier with a bad attitude.

We tried!"}
{"text":"a secret little Italian take-out spot in Belmont. Delicious Italian food and fresh bread and salad."}
{"text":"Still love Joes Touch of Italy. Everything is great.  My favorites are Spaghetti and Meatball, Fettuccine, Antipasto with creamy Italian dressing,  Chicken Parmesan meal and sub. Delivery is awesome!  I am spoiled!"}
{"text":"I normally *want* to help the little guy, the local Mom & Pop places that supposedly put out the best food (especially, for some reason, pizza). But I have to give this place a pass. 

I ordered an Italian sausage and mushroom pie from these guys not too long after they opened.... and it was a big disappointment. The crust was not too bad: nice and chewy, but could have been cooked a few minutes longer. It's the toppings that were a complete trainwreck. The Italian sausage were the same nasty, commercial \"pellets\" you'd get on a Little Caesar's pizza, and the sauce tasted like it came straight from a can. They were a bit too light on the cheese, too. But the worst thing was that the pizza wasn't cooked enough, and the toppings wanted to slide off the slices! When I tried pulling my first slice off the pie, I got a piece of bread with tomato sauce and a pile of toppings in the box! After carefully removing the second slice, I went to eat it and all the toppings slid off and landed on my plate!

Domino's and Pizza Hut might make mediocre pies, but they have it down to a science and both charge reasonable money for their products.I'd LOVE IT if Joe's was a success. But why should I pay $14+ for a disappointing pie when I can get something demonstrably better from Pizza Hut for $10?"}
{"text":"We are addicted to Joe's! No other pizza place exists in this home unless you want to be kicked out of the family. If you drop in to pick up your order the staff is always super friendly. Delivery is always faster than stated times, which is a plus. The pizza, of course, is AH-mazing! And sometimes we like to change it up a little bit and get the stromboli, which is also an excellent choice."}
{"text":"Best pizza around! I can't eat pizza anywhere else. I ordered the saturday special and got 2 large pepperoni pizzas for around 20 bucks. I had tons of pizza for days! great deal, very yummy. Highly recommend. Also, service is very fast and friendly. The place is very small but don't be put off by it. Give Joe's a shot!"}
{"text":"This was my second time ordering for me until hair was found infused in the sausage. I called and told the owner about it and he stated that I needed to bring the pizza back. I told them I really didn't want pizza any more after what we found looked like pubic hair in the sausage. They told me that was my only option I stated add me to the list for the next time I wanted pizza. They told me if I didn't get the pizza now I couldn't get it With only 11 reviews I should have knew better , being open since 2014......I normally don't take the time to review but this was the worst experience ever."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place for a great Italian dinner! We always order and have it delivered to compliment our movie night. They are extremely friendly and very fast service! The Fettuccine Alfredo is to die for!! My hubby loves the Chicken Parmesan and I have to admit it is like none else! For a special treat, if you are a true cheesecake conossuier I highly recommend giving their cheesecake a taste! !"}
{"text":"Had the white pizza, Dec 14.  Crust was really good.  Crispy, well cooked.  It was just a little bland, but I will try them again for a more traditional pizza.  Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I have a broken foot. My friend said she was coming down to visit and would bring dinner. I am new to the area and had no idea what to pick. She was in the mood for pasta.
I looked up what was near me and Joe's Touch of Italy popped up. 
I love little places. I am Italian and find it hard to get good Italian food in the Charlotte area (seems there aren't many of us!)... so I didn't expect much.
She showed up with my calzone and her fettuccine florentine in hand. 
My calzone was superb.  I would like to see a bigger variety of toppings (artichokes, fresh garlic, gorgonzola cheese etc) but I had spinach, onion, ricotta and mozzarella cheese. It was huge and very very tasty.
I do suggest ordering an extra sauce... it is really good... but not enough. 
Now, despite the fact that my calzone was amazing. ... I was jealous of her dish. 
She had the fettuccine florentine. It smelled so good and the noodles looked home made! The sauce was perfect.... yes I had to taste it. 
She ordered zeppolis too..... yummmmmmm!
I will be back... a lot."}
{"text":"BEST FOOD AND CUSTOMER SERVICE IN TOWN. This is the only place you can get FRESH made Alfredo for the same price as that frozen junk... oh and their pizza!!!!! TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. True New York style!! Joe knows how to make some food!"}
{"text":"I've only had the chef salad, and if I had to judge based on just that, this place rocks!"}
