{"text":"Generous portions, fast service, friendly staff.  What's not to like.   Would recommend to friends and family.  Ordered the chicken cashew  And extra egg rolls.  Very tasty and satisfying!  Will make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"The menu is similar to other \"Chinese Takeout\" restaurants BUT the preparation and taste is MUCH BETTER!  Very FRIENDLY staff & they will modify menu items to taste."}
{"text":"The worst slop I have ever tried 2 things soup and egg roll terrible I'm texting from a dibellas subs trying to forget the only reason I gave it one star was to write this review"}
{"text":"Horrible Customer Service. I ordered online since they always get the order wrong over the phone. I asked for white rice versus fried rice and noted it. They did not even acknowledge it. I then called once food came with wrong item and asked them to return with the white rice. I waited over an hour. Called again and they were making excuses for the driver but not once even offered an apology or even anything off of the bill. She then tells me to eat it. I advised I wont since it is nasty to me and not my preference and then she proceeds to ask what she can do about it. I asked her to bring me the white rice I asked for so I could eventually eat my cold food with it. Not once even offered to redo my meal since it was messed up.....smh......AND FOR SOME REASON IF YOU PAY WITH A CREDIT CARD. THEY KEEP IT ON FILE. EVEN IF YOU ASK THEM TO REMOVE IT FROM THEIR SYSTEM. RED FLAGS!!!"}
{"text":"Since moving to Stoughton there hasn't been much in the way of restaurants especially if not pizza/american food. So was looking forward to having a new Chinese restaurant to try! After hearing good reviews in a local facebook group we decided to give it a go. Im glad we did they have good food and quick service! We tried their chicken lo mein, chicken chow mein and steamed dumplings. All worth having again and I look forward to trying more next time!"}
{"text":"Finally--good Chinese food in Stoughton!   My family has ordered take-out from here a few times already, and it's been consistently excellent. Our orders have always been ready lightning fast, the service is friendly, and the food--General Tso's Chicken, Happy Family, eggrolls, you name it--is hot, fresh, and delicious.   It's everything you want in Chinese take-out, yet it's surprisingly not run-of-the-mill. For example, even their white rice is good. I know that might seem like a weird to comment on, but it's true. If you've ever had bland, mediocre rice before, you know what I'm talking about.   I'm thrilled to have this restaurant in town. It's already become one of our go-to places, and I know we'll continue eating here regularly!"}
{"text":"General Tso's tofu and vegetable fried rice were prepared fast and hot.  The quality and taste of the food was very good."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good Chinese food here. I have been here several times since my co-worker recommmeded this place to me. I have tried the sesame chicken, egg rolls, Teriyaki chicken, B.B.Q. ribs, pork fried rice, wonton soup, and Szechuan chicken. They were all good, and as some others have said, not as greasy as most places."}
{"text":"Great takeout/delivery. Quality of the food is impressive. Never had an issue with delivery time. My go to place for Chinese on the quick."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. It's your typical Chinese-American food. I am vegan and they accomodate me pretty well.   I have a couple of complaints though. First, the woman and man in there are always yelling at each other. It makes it really awkward to wait for your food.  Also, my lunch break is at 11 AM and even though their hours posted say they open at 11, they're usually never on time."}
{"text":"Some meals are better then the others but in all reality I would go back... And I have just wish they opened up their menu to teriyaki."}
{"text":"Just a quick update:  This time, SO and I order some Orange Chicken and Dumplings. Dumplings were solid this time, very good. Orange Chicken was pretty good too, had an actual orange flavor rather that weird Tang/Hi-C \"orange\" flavor. Deliver was just as quick as last time, around thirty minutes from order to delivery."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time last night, we ordered carry out. First impression is that it was very clean and inviting inside, and the staff was  very nice. We received large portions of very good, very fresh tasting food. Will certainly recommend to friends."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Chinese restaurants because of its location, prices, and quality of food."}
{"text":"The food was great! I had the orange chicken. It was fresh and delicious. The egg rolls were crispy and tasty. Reasonable prices. The staff were very courteous and friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We order food frequently and are never disappointed. From sweet and sour chicken to chicken and vegetables and everything in between! Great place when having visitors from out of town. Portions are large, guests are happy....and stuffed!"}
{"text":"5 stars for a hole-in-the-wall, take-out Chinese place? Oh honey...  But this is legit the best Chinese takeout joints around in Dane Co.  The smiling young couple work diligently to get your orders right and hot and ready.  I always order the Spicy Shrimp which can be kind of sketchy from other establishments but you don't have to worry about that here. The shrimps are huge! 16/20 jumbo sized, deveined and tails off. It's always cooked to perfection, tender but not rubbery.  The hot and sour soup has the right consistency and quality ingredients. It even comes with a side of crispy noodles.  Come and support this hardworking, cute couple in their business venture! Enjoy some delicious Chinese food while you're at it."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of China King.  It's surprisingly difficult to find a good go-to Chinese takeout I've discovered.  My last few places of residence were really lacking, but China King is great.  They are clean, fast, consistent, cheap, and their website is superb.  $1.75 to order online and have it delivered?!  Awesome.  Of course you can't go to a place like this and expect gourmet or super authentic cuisine, but I've never been disappointed with my food.  I am a big fan of the seafood soup, and I was just recently pleased to try the spicy basil shrimp.  You have to remember to pick up your own sauces and utensils when you get your food because they don't put them in the bag for you.  I don't mind though bc then I don't have to throw away packets that I didn't want in the first place.  I will say that the soy sauce they give in the packets is pretty flavorless."}
{"text":"Great, cheap Chinese food.  Wobbly floors, wobbly tables, but I still love this place."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I like my Chinese Food a lil bit greasy and full of flavor. This was neither. I also like quick,competent service but that didn't happen either. Very dissatisfied and would never order anything else again. Would have been better to get a microwaved burrito. This place was a big tease from all the reviews I read. No Thnx"}
{"text":"For a town of our size (about 4,000) I am very grateful that we have a modest little selection of restaurants:  several pizza places, a DQ, bar food and Chinese.  China King is St Joseph's version of chinese food and for that purpose, It rocks! The owners are very nice and the portions are huge.  I can feed our family of 6 for about $30 so I am not complaining about the prices.   It has a little seating area if you dine in but I think the bulk of their business comes from take out orders.  There is nothing original on the menu, this ain't the place for creativity but they do the basics very well.  The peppered steak with mushrooms is my fave and the 16 year old loves their orange chicken.  They have a good variety of vegetarian options for the daughter although they are often out of tofu so she has to settle for veggies only.  I would give them a 5 just for the option of having something other than pizza in town but they are solidly good and that's just as awesome."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite lunch places - the food is cheap, doesn't take too long, and is delicious!! I'm a big fan of their sesame chicken (when it's good), as it has a bit of a kick to it. Lunch and dinner combos are a great deal, and I love the crab rangoon. The restaurant is kept clean, and I love the guys behind the counter - so friendly! The only con is that the quality seems to vary at times. Last week, the sesame chicken was the best I'd ever tasted. Got it again last night, and this time, it was good - not even mediocre, a solid 'good,' - but I wanted what I had last week. :( Still, I recommend it for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Delivery was prompt and the food was delicious.  The lunch special servings were enormous."}
{"text":"Veggie Fried Rice!!! Excellent service, always very nice and great, hot food."}
{"text":"If you like to eat this is not your best choice always forgetting food or giving you the wrong thing.. They do delivery but won't bring you your correct order you have to go back to pick it up. And you get nothing in exchange for their mess ups."}
{"text":"China King offers good food at pretty reasonable prices. Not terrific with the beverages, (cans) but carry out orders get a free two-liter pop, and you can reserve a table and order online at their website, including ordering and paying for deliveries for a very reasonable surcharge.  It's regular, retail Chinese food for suburbanites. You will not be overwhelmed by awesomeness but we have never been disappointed with the quality of the food or the service."}
{"text":"Once upon a time I would've given them 4-5 stars but it's become so inconsistent. My go to, shrimp fried rice. One time it's perfection the next it flavorless & dry"}
{"text":"Their Szechuan beef wasn't spicy and the restaurant was filthy. Not messy because of being busy but accumulated  filth built up in layers. This place needs a health inspection"}
{"text":"I have gotten take out orders from this restaurant, and the good here is excellent. I am glad that I have heard of a place like this."}
{"text":"Was good. Your typical fast food Chinese carryout place. Better than some others. Good prices. Friendly service. Free tea while you wait."}
{"text":"I'm not a picky person, but there were a couple things wrong with my experience with China King: -Delivery was late, taking over an hour and a half for a simple order. -I asked for utensils with the delivery, and the driver did not have any. -There were only 2 pieces of shrimp in my order of shrimp and broccoli.  Pretty cheap. -They weren't shy on soy sauce packets, but I only received 1 little packet of sweet & sour sauce with my sweet & sour chicken.  Doesn't that usually come with an extra container with it?  I think I would have been much better off going to Panda Express."}
{"text":"I didn't know that bad Chinese food was even possible, but this place's food was absolutely terrible. The chicken teriyaki sticks were super slimy and just had a very \"off\" texture. The boneless ribs were comprised primarily of blobules of fat, not meat. I literally threw my order in the garbage after about 10 bites. The egg roll was ok."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Comfort Inn down the road and chose this place based on proximity. They were super helpful on the phone - even recommended a more economical way to order (suggested a diet plate, as they come with sauce on the side). They were accommodating, too - I needed just a dish with broccoli and baby corn, as the kiddos like that best. They knew how to get to our hotel, delivered right to the door of our room, and the food was hot. The egg rolls were just kind of \"meh\" but the garlic sauce was good, as was the Hunan shrimp."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. All the things you'd expect at a Chinese take out place.  It is the best in the area that I've found."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese Restaurant menu.  Incredibly tasty.  Lots of tables inside, bright, clean, inviting.  Food is made quickly.  My carry-out order usually takes less than 10 minutes.  I'm a predictable gal.  I usually order Sesame Chicken, so I have a lot of restaurants to compare their Sesame Chicken to.  China King is one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous post. Recently this place has gone downhill and taken their food with them. Tonight I ordered the sweet and sour chicken combination with the crab ran goon and an egg roll.   Because they began to put sprouts of some sort in their fried rice, I requested no sprouts, and basically they gave me fried rice with only the chunks of chicken, but none of the vegetables (peas, onion, etc.) that used to be in the fried rice.  The egg role was more of a spring role; very fine and delicate shell, but the middle didn't taste like anything. It was a little boring.  The crab ran goon are what put the stake through my heart. This place used to have the BEST crab ran goon in town. Tonight however, the top corners were a strange color from the rest of the pastry and looked dry and/or overcooked. I decided to forgo trying them as I can't afford to be sick.  The chicken was as usual, but for over $8 - I can get better chicken elsewhere.  Not sure what's gone on with this place, but I'm not sure if I can return - too many other places in town whose food I like."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for Chinese food. My favorite is their sweet and sour chicken combo with fried rice. Their egg rolls are amazing, and the best crab Rangoon hands down. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's purely a take out spot.  It isn't great, but it isn't bad either.  I highly prefer Little Hong Kong over this place."}
{"text":"Our company orders from China King for our manager meetings and we are always receiving compliments on the food.  The Teriyaki chicken is  very good and we keep ordering more each time because we run out. The Beef Broccoli is a favorite as well as the ribs and pork fried rice.  The portions are generous and I would highly recommend this for feeding a group!"}
{"text":"In a town so small we are very lucky to have Chinese food available that is at least as good as what can be found in Urbana. Much better than Hot Wok."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Chinese food. Loved the fact that it wasn't greasy. Everything in our take out order was fresh, and recognizable. You know how in egg rolls there is that one, unidentifiable weird ingredient? Not in these! I loved the egg rolls!   My only critique is that the orange chicken had a weird texture. It was the breading, which seemed maybe too flour-y? Also, more sauce would have been great.   Overall, we will return.  Food was fast, fresh, and pretty standard. But nothing beats good eggrolls. Nothing."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times since i started working uptown. I usually get the sesame chicken and rice, which is just okay at best. However, today, I got the chicken and broccoli with rice and it was just bad. The chicken tasted suspect and the rice was mushy. It's too bad, they have a great location and everyone who works there is very nice, but the food is borderline awful. Today was definitely my last visit."}
{"text":"Every time I have ordered they're rude on the phone. Also, every delivery order I have received has been incorrect and I end up having to call back. I won't be ordering from there again. Skip all the frustration and order from somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Overall good food, only reason not 5 stars is because they don't do half orders on anything. Really wanted to try the chicken wings but did not want 8. Maybe next time"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese place!! I just learned of their donuts! They are amazing :)"}
{"text":"If you live in the 'burbs and want authentic Chinese food without having to drive downtown, check out this spot! They're very polite, offer big portions, and have delicious food. Their restaurant is clean and you can see everything in the kitchen - even as they cook! We always get the shrimp with broccoli, shrimp rolls, shrimp chips (like fluffy potato chips!), and the 10-piece order of their crab rangoon!  (One time they \"threw in\" a free order of these rangoons and we've been a fan ever since! If you've never tried them, you have no  idea what you've been missing all these years) On top of everything else, THEY DELIVER outside of Independence (!)"}
{"text":"This place serves the best fried rice, sweet and sour and general tsos chicken among others. Location is not as good for visibility, but it's one of our favorite places to order. They also deliver ."}
{"text":"They don't speak perfect english but they sure do make good food. I love the general tso's chicken and fried rice, I get it almost every time"}
{"text":"First time ever had a disappointing meal. Ordered beef with snow peas and the beef was very tough and fatty.  May try chicken next time. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Was not great...go to little Hong Kong for good Chinese food in Ridgeville."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to eat a good clean Chinese meal. Entrees are always fresh and have a decent priced lunches that last all day. Very flavorful and satisfying. Some favorites are the Hunan chicken that come mixed in with crunchy fresh not frozen vegetables (stir fry) and the General Taos chicken is cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Oh Lordy. I wanted to like China King. My hopes were for nothing more than mediocre Chinese take-out that was close to my school so I could bring it back for a study session. Someone I used to call my friend recommended China King (hence the fact that they are no longer my friend).   Upon walking in I knew I was in trouble as the manager was (at the risk of being considered a racist) a white guy. I'm sorry but I don't trust people of my skin complexion to make Chinese food. And it appears that my experience at China King was a confirmation of that belief.  I ordered the sweet and sour chicken and kindly asked the manager to pack me some chopsticks and a bowl that I could eat it in as I was going to be indulging at my school. Naturally those items were both left out, meaning that I would be destined to eat it with my fingers or toes.  When I got back to the school and opened my food (and discovered their failure to provide me with basic eating utensils), I found that my food pretty much appeared to be deep fried chicken balls similar to those you'd buy in bulk from Sam's Club and a side of sweet and sour sauce. No veggies or pineapple, or anything else that would make it resemble an entree. To top it off, the chicken balls were dripping with grease. In fact, they were so greasy that it looked like they were in an oil sauce. After taking 2 bites I knew I had made a mistake and tossed it all in the trash.  The only reason I felt it necessary to award China King a 2-star rating was the fact that their prices were very low. The portion was huge for the cost - unfortunately it was almost inedible but at least it was cheap."}
{"text":"Great food and extremely easy.  Their online ordering is simple and quick if you travel.  You can customize your General Tso's Chicken's spiciness.  I gave them 10 minutes from the time I placed the order and it was ready when I got there.  They even take Amex cards!"}
{"text":"This is a very good place for take out Chinese. They are always pleasant and the order is done quickly.   The kids love the golden fingers and the chicken fried rice is always good."}
{"text":"Great food. Potstickers are phenomenal. Tremendous crab ran-goons. Good service and family run"}
{"text":"When I crave Chinese food, this place is my quick fix. They are so fast. I order & it's all ready by the time I get there & I'm only like 5 minutes away! The food is tasty & very affordable. I often crave their curry & any of their spicy, fried chicken dishes. Vegetables are consistently cooked to perfection. Their lunch menu is excellent. Portions are large like my cavernous appetite."}
{"text":"My #1 Local favorite. Fresh chinese during business lunch time. Lunch specials for $6, and authentic meals with HUGE portions.   ULTIMATE FAVORITES. And the owners are so humble & caring. It goes a long way!  Try the Singapore Noodles - curry noodles with beef/chicken/shrimp!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food! I ordered the lunch sesame chicken with lo mein and the crab rangoons, delivered right on time and still hot!! Will definetly order again!"}
{"text":"If your looking for fantastic food, this is the place! Whether I'm at work or at home, this place never disappoints. Have never had any problems.   I always order the same thing, so I'm sure they know me by now. I usually get the General Tso's chicken, egg rolls, butterfly shrimp and the crab Rangoon. Today when I ordered, the lady called and said they were out of the shrimp. I was disappointed but she told me they could give me the potstickers instead. I was unsure what they were to be honest, but I agreed anyway. I'm glad I did though because they were AWESOME!   So definitely check this place out if you haven't already, the staff is excellent and the food is phenomenal. Always fresh, quick and hot. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!!   I haven't had Chinese food that tastes as good as this did for many, many years!  Absolutely outstanding!  The restaurant opened about a week ago, and I just had my first chance to visit for lunch.  The menu is extensive and very affordable.  Lunch prices start at 6.55 and top- out at $6.95.  Dinner ranges from $6.55 - $12.25.  Also a dedicated \"health food\" section on the menu for folks who are trying to keep their diets on the straight-and-narrow.    Great lunch and dinner selections.    The restaurant is clean and bright, new furnishings, lots of tables, and is staffed by very friendly people.    I had the garlic chicken lunch special with rice and an add-on egg roll.  All of it was truly fantastic.  Service was very fast.  I am VERY glad they have opened their restaurant in Stoughton and I look forward to my next visit!  If you are in the area and looking for some seriously good Chinese food, give China King a try!  Your belly will thank you..."}
{"text":"I love China King. Very nice owners, they remember you. The food tastes great with good variety. Awesome online menu, order for dine-in, delivery, & and sit down. I do wish they had homemade spicy mustard and duck sauce on the table and not the little packets....but I love that stuff.  Overall great place, will be back"}
{"text":"I work in North Ridgeville and often times don't have the opportunity to leave and get lunch - That is why China King is perfect! They deliver and you can order online. I have purchased from multiple Chinese Food establishments in North Ridgeville, and this by far is the best. I highly recommend it for \"take-out\" Friday nights or deliverable lunches!"}
{"text":"Fave Chinese in the Madison area. Always hot and fresh, this place is family run and a restaurant I feel good supporting. We've eaten here once a week since they opened and never had a bad experience! Favorites include pork fried rice and beef with broccoli. I just wish they delivered!"}
{"text":"Great addition to Stoughton. We ordered a few different items. They all had great flavor. We will be eating here again."}
{"text":"Always worth the drive from Oregon. Portions are huge for the price. We have liked everything we have ever ordered. Crab Rangoon is a must, some of the best I've had. Free tea is delicious and a nice touch. We will continue to go back."}
{"text":"I actually really like This specific location. I love the dinner for two and four deals. I prefer the food from this location over any other carryout (DC term) in the Charlotte area and their lo mein is delicous. They are also always really nice. Sometimes they have their daughters there after school doing homework. They remind me of the twins from the shining. But, this is by far the best in the area!!!!"}
{"text":"I love these guys.  My family has been ordering from this business for many years. I highly recommend this eatery. Family owned and operated. Great food, great service and always a smile."}
{"text":"really great tasting and fast chinese food delivery-- and at a good price. They have a number of vegetarian options too."}
{"text":"The food was very fresh and delicious. We ordered the General Tso Chicken, Shrimp Fried Rice, Chicken Lo Mein, Crab Rangoon, Egg Rolls with a side of sweet and sour sauce. Everything was hot and fresh. We will be eating here again. I took pictures of the menu and posted."}
{"text":"Great little place! The takeout is very good. Really enjoyed the crab rangoons and shrimp/broccoli dishes. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I eat here once a week!!!! They are so friendly and they actually know me by name. It's always fresh and the sesame chicken is amazing along with the sweet n sour chicken. The sweet n sour sauce is just that!!! The cheese wantons are out of this world!!!! Excellent pricing for what you get. Always ready by the time I walk in the door."}
{"text":"This is my go-to cheap Chinese place. Great chicken, delicious crab rangoons, and fast service. I've never dined in, but it looks like an alright dine-in space. It's super close to where I work so I drop in quite often for lunch. They have a nice lunch deal, too!"}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service.  Prices are  too high in comparison with Urbana Chinese restaurants.  First Wok is much better on price and portions, but it's a lil further to drive."}
{"text":"This place could be greatly improved with a little effort. We recently moved into the area and although there were very mixed reviews we decided to check and see for ourselves. I got the Kung Pao Chicken. The chicken was good quality and although there was a lot of celery used as filled it still would have been acceptable except for one thing: no flavor. I asked for \"extra spicy\" when placing the order but it fell upon deaf ears. But basic Kung Pao sauce should be spicy and flavorful. This sauce was more like brown gravy. My wife ordered GarlicChicken . Same outcome. No flavor. Slightly garlic and sweet but zero intensity. The folks were nice, the food was quickly prepared and reasonably priced but with no flavor there is no reason to eat here. I cannot explain the positive reviews except maybe some folks don't know what good Chinese food is supposed to taste like. A few spices would turn this place around, but I don't see that happening as long as people eat what they are served. We will keep looking for a better place."}
{"text":"The food is great and the people that work there are very nice.  I stop there on my way home from work sometimes, they are very effcient.  I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Food was cheap and pretty decent. However, I did not get sweet and sour sauce with my sweet and sour chicken, they gave me orange chicken instead of general tsos, and a regular Coke instead of a diet one. They also took an hour and a half to get the food to me. I also gave instructions to not ring the doorbell and call instead, which the driver disregarded. Honest mistake, I know, but sure doesn't help when everything else was wrong too."}
{"text":"The food here is made fresh and served HOT!  Not really a great place to sit down and eat, minimal tables, but good, dependable, delicious food.  They make a to-die-for garlic sauce which I always ask for on my steamed vegetables and rice.  YUMMY!  The Crab Rangoon is crispy and delicious, egg rolls great.  We've had many things from the menu and I don't think we've ever had anything bad.  The woman owner speaks decent English, her husband, not much English.  One of their daughters also works there.  I love having this option here in town!"}
{"text":"Little Hong Kong is better but does not deliver.  This is the better of the 2 delivery Chinese restaurants that DO deliver, along Center Ridge.  If you're going to carry-out go to Little HK.  If you're going to get delivery, go here.  Food is decent, good portions.  Online ordering makes delivery easy."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say this isn't the king of mall Chinese food. The prices are really good and the customer service is spot on! But the food is subpar. I don't know if it was just me but I was only able to eat a a quarter of the orange chicken before throwing it away. After that my stomach was extremely upset, I can only attribute it to the orange chicken :( so I won't be eating meals there again. Samples yes. Meals no. People are great!!"}
{"text":"Wherever I live, for the rest of my life, one of the requisites for where we call home will, of course, be a good school district, close to the arts, etc...and a delicious Chinese Delivery restaurant.  China King is absolutely that for North Ridgeville - it's our delivery staple and has never let us down.  Our China King delivery orders are always the perfect comfort food - be it after a busy day at work, on a cold rainy day, or a board game night with some beer; China King hits the spot.  The food is always fresh, not greasy, hot, and well made - we've never had any complaint.  We have our standard order of: Sesame Chicken [oh so crispy and flavorful], pork fried rice [not greasy at all and a perfect rendition of the dish], spring rolls [light and crispy], shrimp egg rolls [perfect], and veggie lo mein [super flavorful and great to wrap around some sesame chicken bites].     The customer service is always great here too - orders are timely and never longer than 45minutes, usually even quicker.  The service is so attentive that, the last time we ordered [tonight lol], we switched out our usual lo mein for mei fun and they asked to double-check, saying it wasn't our usual - awesome!  For real, if you're not feeling like cooking, want to chill out and relax tonight - order delivery from China King - you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"I've been  back to China King a couple of times now since my initial visit.  I came earlier around 11 to 11:30 is and it was not busy at all.  I ordered off their specials menu, Spicy Pork & the next visit Sa Cha Chicken, $5.99 for entree, rice & choice of egg roll or chicken wing.  Both were pretty good.  Again nothing outstanding, but pretty tasty.  I order a chicken wing as side both times to try them out.  The flavor is excellent, but again they were a little soggy from being left on their steam table for a while.  I also had soup on both visits since it is getting colder out now.  Egg drop the first time, then hot & sour the second.  Both soups were pretty good and you can get some crunchy noodles to go with it.    Since I keep returning I'm upping my rating to 4 stars.  This place is kind of growing on me and the food has been consistently hot and flavorful on each of my visits.  Don't expect anything fancy here, but they do have pretty good Chinese food here."}
{"text":"Tasty, if unremarkable, Chinese fare is what to expect from China King. You can get in and out quickly, even during the lunch crush if you go through the cafeteria type line and order. There you will find pretty standard items like General Tso's chicken, spicy pork, beef with broccoli, etc. Ordering from the menu gets you more variety but a bit longer wait. Food is good but not great and when they call something spicy, it's only mildly so most of the time. Pretty fair place to satisfy that MSG hankering when in uptown however."}
{"text":"Good experience at the China King.  They have a good selection of Asian cuisines at a fairly reasonable price.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Some coworkers asked if I wanted to go out for lunch today for a business meeting. I can never turn down a free meal. They love the China King. I thought it was good enough. It is what I would expect out of a small Chinese food place in Independence, OH. A lot of the normal offerings with some other cuisines thrown in the mix. I opted for the Spicy Basil Chicken and it was not too bad. I am back in the cubicle sipping on some water because I could feel my body going into salt shock a little bit. I need to balance that out. I loved the lady that worked here and she was a pleasure to deal with. The prices are fair and the portions large. I recommend driving the extra 3 minutes down the road from Rockside to try a small family owned business. Down with corporations! China King! And their website is surprisingly really nice!  http://www.chinakingindependence.com/"}
{"text":"Great food every time. I order here probably 4-5 times per month. They always have the order correct and always fast service. I have not had one problem with this place. Love it!"}
{"text":"First try was nice :) Ordered for pickup over the phone. Order was The dumplings in the wonton soup were tasty. Eager now to try their hot& sour soup. The crab Rangoon were just how I like them... Crispy & sweet. Both our entrees were good (pork with Chinese veg and chicken broccoli). The egg roll was just ok. Next time I'll skip that and just get the crab Rangoon. But there was so much food. Would easily have lunch for the next day. Good value. And good option for Americanized Chinese food in Stoughton :) We don't often get Chinese takeout as its not my husbands fav. But he agreed this was good. Would go again."}
{"text":"Oh man, my experience with this place was my worst chinese delivery nightmare from start to finish.  Delivery minimum, so I had to order 3 dishes even though I couldn't possibly even eat 1.  Driver got lost on the way to my house and called me.  He was about 100 feet from where I was and all he had to do was turn left, but he could not speak English well enough to understand what I was telling him, and didn't seem to be motivated enough to actually try to go in the directon I was telling him to go.  We were on the phone for about 15 minutes.    Then I at last had the food in my kitchen.  The menu claims no MSG but my food tasted like 4 different textures of MSG.  When I opened my (admittedly totally tired) General Tso's Chicken, the first bite (and all subsequent bites) I took was overpowered in flavor by the 4 sad sorry florets of brocolli that had been thrown in the box.  My sweet and sour pork that I had to order to meet the delivery medium was of the sweet and sour comes in a separate tub and has to be combined with the deep fried pork pellets variety, which is my least favorite variety.  At least the dishes were themselves inexpensive?"}
