{"text":"This place is awesome! I am addicted to the Save The Planet Curry! I also love the spring rolls and the Kung Pao Chicken. The service is great, the restaraunt is very clean. Really great food."}
{"text":"So far food just ok. I recommend the spring rolls for $2.50 very good with sweet and sour sauce. Don't get the side of veggies, it's just cabbage mostly. I do not recommend the curry rice, it had a weird flavor. I liked the sweat and sour tofu dish. Very good. The chai tea is so delicious but they give you enough for only a couple of slurps and then you are done and wanting more. All in all i would go back here again for the sweat and sour tofu. I would try other dishes too."}
{"text":"My friend and I came for dinner today and we cannot wait to come back. I had the spicy Kung Pao and we shared the spring rolls. Everything tasted wonderful! The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was very clean. This is a vegan/ vegetarians paradise."}
{"text":"I love to come here from time to time when I'm in the area and I am always highly satisfied with the food and service. The menu is great and there's a variety of dishes for every taste. The service is great, everyone is always really nice and the atmosphere is quiet and relaxed. Definitely a great place to have dinner/lunch with friends. I read some other reviews from people who complained about the food, mostly these were meat eaters, I'm assuming, so of course they were not satisfied. This is a %100 vegan restaurant, note it."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't review a place that I'd only visited once, but I'm just so dang excited there's a vegan restaurant close to where I work that i had to post on this one.  I ordered the Hawaiian Burger w/ Fries (takeout)... love that I got the experience of a down & dirty \"splurge\" meal that killed neither my wallet nor my energy level.  I felt meal-satisfied and also alert and springy enough to continue the rest of my work day (the exact opposite would have occurred had I eaten an actual hamburger).  The fries were decent but the real pleaser was the burger itself-- sliced pineapple, grilled onions, deliciously teriyaki-infused veggie patty that had a hearty texture yet left me with a clean (not greasy) feeling afterward.  Yum!  I left off one star for the customer service-- they were friendly enough, just slooow.  But I'll definitely be returning just so I can try some of the other deliciousness I eyed on their menu..."}
{"text":"I loved your guys place, I went a while back living in the area. But I've never tried your type of food at all. Really good.   But I'd have to say that the best part of the experience was he fact your employees looked so different from one another. They had their own \"swag\" loved that about that area.  Also they were trying to put on their neighboring restaurant, which was nice I thought.   Anyways overall a good experience. I'd go there again :)"}
{"text":"Me and my friend went vegan for a couple of weeks and so I came to loving hut. The restaurant is clean and very educational which I appreciated a lot. I ordered some vegetarian noodles; however, and they were rather bland which required me to put a lot of syracha sauce in in order to make them tasty. I will admit that is the only dish that I have had though so I'm not sure if the other food as flavorful or not."}
{"text":"This isn't food, one might hear said in reference to veggie/vegan restaurants; this is what food eats. Not the case for the Loving Hut. Clean, attractive surroundings, friendly and professional staff, and delicious food, at least the first time around. My wife and I stopped in for lunch, and found the fare delicious, four or even five star standard. Not so lucky a week or so later, when we came in for dinner and ordered virtually the same things - two star at best. Different chef on duty, perhaps? Bummer - bitter are the expectations that, once established, are unmet. We'll give it another try, though - perhaps the second experience was the aberration."}
{"text":"Last night was my foray into Loving Hut.   Definitely an interesting place.  The TV was annoying, the whole propaganda film for the supreme master was super annoying.  On to the important part.  I ordered the Golden Vermicelli.  It was delicious.  Let me back up, I absolutely love vermicelli salad dishes at Vietnamese restaurants and I am a carnivore HOWEVER, I am deadly allergic to fish and shellfish and I can't eat at those restaurants anymore out of fear of cross contamination but when I learned of the Loving Hut, I was stoked!  I was very excited and I inhaled the meal.  Easily could have removed the faux-meat but it was delicious.   My sister ate the same as I did.  My daughter got the Sweet and Sour Divine and she inhaled it.  I ordered the Iced Chai and it was AWFUL.  Hellllooo cinnamon and no other flavors.  The appetizer soup was bland.  The banana fritters were OUT OF THIS WORLD.  However, nothing on the menu or in the pictures indicated any kind of red sauce so when they came out (an hour later), they had a red syrup and I asked what it was and she informed me it was strawberry syrup and whoops! I am allergic to strawberries and it had to get remade.  I should have said something but I did not see anything indicated on the menu that they did this...so, on them!  Overall, food was good but prices too high and service waaaayyy too slow.  I had my bowl of noodles for 20 minutes before my daughter's food came out so she was munching on cukes until then.   Would I return?  Sure.  It was fun but the TV? CHANGE THE CHANNEL!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese I've ever had. The staff is a family that creates authentic Asian cuisine and is a good place to get people into vegan food."}
{"text":"This place has great vegan food. It's a must if you're looking for a vegan restaurant."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to eat. Love the staff & the food. Never disappointed. Love the location in Georgia(Peachtree Corners) & Arcadia/Phoenix as well."}
{"text":"I discovered this place by a Groupon purchase. The food is fantabulous. They have products you can buy and cook at home. They also offer cooking classes. They have one this Saturday,  7.11.15. My friend is now in love with this place. We are trying every dish as much as we can. The chocolate cake is yummm. The videos they play are awesome. Loving hut Glendale currently has a Groupon deal, get yours NOW! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Pad Thai to go, it did take awhile but it was worth the wait.  The noodles had a nice texture and they made it extra spicy for me! The ladies behind the counter were very friendly. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Friendly service, clean atmosphere, good taste and generous portions might be some of the reasons for us to host our friends from out of town there. We definitely give this LH a thumbs up !!!"}
{"text":"I'm a person who likes routine. I go to bed the same time each night and eat the same staple foods each week. And then I walked into the Loving Hut and it changed my life. Okay, not literally. But I have gone a half-dozen times and have not ordered the same thing twice. Why? Because I want to try everything on the menu! That's how good it is. My favorite is the SAVE-PLANET Curry. It has more flavor than my taste-buds know what to do with. And I've never left this place hungry. The portions are generous, the taste is indescribable, and they give you this pleasant orange-flavored water and soup start with. While I may be breaking routine by ordering everything from the menu, one routine I will not be breaking is visiting this place at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I love this place every time I'm in the area I always stop by.  I love the carrot cake and the appetizers I wish they had more location or one near me..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love The Loving Hut! The staff is so friendly, the environment is peaceful, and the vegan Pho is crazy good! Actually I don't think I've had anything there that I don't like. They also have plenty of options for the kiddos. Definitely recommend whether you are vegan/vegetarian or not... it's all tasty!"}
{"text":"Here's my take:  The food is great, for vegan stuff, everything I've tried there (Spicy Chacha & BBQ Beef Noodles) is delicious.  That said, the ambiance is a little depressing, almost sterile.  Also on the negative side, they also don't take American Express, which is a bummer since they have a MAJOR American Express facility only a city block away and not accepting this card has been a deterrent for me coming in more often.  Lastly, the service is spotty at best.  They have table set up but you need to order from the counter and the place is not setup where that is intuitive.  I had to ask for silverware multiple times before I was brought it and they served me my food backwards (entree, appetizer, then soup).  Which was a little weird.  But back to the food.  I would say I was very pleasantly surprised.  All my dishes I really couldn't tell that what I was eating wasn't the real meat.  Whatever substitutes they use, they masterfuly crafted it.  So since I write my reviews on the quality of the food more than the ambiance, I give it 3 stars.  In summary, if what you are looking for is good food, vegan, healthy, without knowing that it's vegan this is a great place."}
{"text":"I am vegetarian but I think anyone could enjoy this place.  It is tasty!  We were pleased with everything we ordered.  I found the Exquisite Curry to be fantastic but really, everything I tasted was very good.  The menu is exciting and I can't wait to try more.  The service was sweet and I loved the Happy Go Lucky drink.  I look forward to going back!  I'd eat there a lot if it was closer to me..."}
{"text":"Loving Hut has great flavors coupled with healthy food! Their preparations are innovative and filling. (I wasn't sure about \"meat substitutes\" at first, but they have really won me over.) For this last visit, I had a beautifully flavored eggplant dish (Italian parsley was swapped in for basil as it was not available from the restaurant's supplier) and an iced Mumbai chai. The Mumbai chai reminded me a little of a Thai iced tea but with another note --reminded me a little of cayenne (but very subtle). Excellent customer service was most appreciated."}
{"text":"I LOVE the food here. Really amazing asian cuisine but veganized. But my meat loving fiance also really enjoys it. The atmosphere is really clean and the service is phenomenal, almost every time we go we get complimentary soup before the meal. But the food doesn't just taste good its really pretty too. They put flowers in their special drinks, it was super cool. Also their \"cheesecake\" is mouthwateringly good, I have to get it every time."}
{"text":"I gave them two stars because they're organic and they're vegan at least they try. I was not impressed at all with the food how do you not make vegetables taste delish completely disappointed I had high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"Not only did I really like this place, I wanted to support it.  This is a totally Vegan restaurant that actually tastes good.  The people who run this place take great pride in being vegan and not being cruel to animals.  They even have statements on their walls about it.  Walls which are super nice.  The place is very plain, all white, but for some reason, it's cool.  The restaurant is extremely clean, and other than listening to the TV talk about animal cruelty the experience was awesome.  My meal was great.  We stared with the spring rolls, I go the spicy cha cha and my gf had the curry.  The curry was some of the best I've had since coming to AZ, and my dish had great spices, and was delicious.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Tried this out for the first time a few nights ago. Service was good, one of the guys was really nice and made sure drinks were filled, etc. We were the only ones there from 7pm on. Maybe it was the rain.  Place is really clean for sure as others have noted.  Food is good. I'm a meat-a-tarian and need to have meat in every meal, but this place substituted that desire pretty well. Tried the Mongolian dish, they somehow made the tofu look just like sliced beef, pretty miraculous. Texture-wise it was noticeably different, but a great experience. Drinks were okay and expensive comparatively to food. I tried the ice chai and while it wasn't oversweetened which I hate, it was also somewhat taste-less. Would not recommend the iced chai to most people. Food was great and I would go back to try other items."}
{"text":"My recently turned-vegan husband and I tried out LH a few weeks ago.  He had the lemongrass \"chicken\" thing and I had \"beef\" and broccoli as recommended by other Yelpers.  Neither was spectacularly tasty or memorable.  In fact, the more we thought on it, the less we liked it.  I think the issue with the dishes we ordered was that they were made with meat analogs and were trying too hard to taste like their real meat counterparts.  I suppose this is part of the Supreme Master's plan to convert meat-loving customers into happy vegans, but honestly, my husband and I already are accustomed to eating vegan food.  We're okay with stuff that looks like compost or doesn't have TVP in it.  Really!  So, skip the fakey meat and just cook good food -- not frozen propaganda nuggets.  I also had the Happy Go Lucky drink and the Golden Rolls.  Those were the best parts of my meal, but we agreed that we'd probably not make the drive back over anytime soon."}
{"text":"I come here often. Very clean place and the food is great. Never been disappointed. My favorite entrée here is \"Mongolian Wok\" and drink is \"Pink Lady\". I highly recommend it to my vegan friends."}
{"text":"Everything here is fantastic! I'm not a vegan but I still love all of their yummy food!"}
{"text":"Great place for vegan food.offers wide variety from asian to american to vietnamese dishes at a very affordable price of about $7-$10/main dish. Tried the following: 1) Gracious spicy noodle Very delicious vietnamese styled spicy noodle. Liked the spicy vegetable soup base the best. Generous servings of soy protetin and veggies. Amazing soup noodles!  2) Golden BBQ vermicelli Great combination of golden rolls with Vietnamese style vermicelli. The homemade sauce gave the dish most of its flavour. What a satisfying dish!   3) Sweet and Sour Divine Kind of a low point. The soy protein was a little too tough for my liking.and the serving was a little smaller than normal servings I'd expect.  Overall a plus for loving hut and I am sure to return to try out the other dishes. Great place for vegan lovers even though I am not fully vegan myself!"}
{"text":"I love this place -- we eat here about once a week.  I'm not a huge fan of fake meat, so I stick mainly to the tofu dishes, but I love the Rainbow Salad, the Veggie Tofu Delight, the spring rolls, the curry soups, and the Kung Pao. In fact, the only thing I ever had here that I wasn't wild about was the eggplant dish. My husband isn't even vegan and he loves it here, too. The place is clean, the staff is awesome, and the food rocks."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Pho and this place serves a flavorful bowl of it. The spring rolls are crisp and satisfying as well. My non-veg husband goes crazy for the Sweet & Sour Divine. My two small children really enjoy it too. They love the golden nuggets. Loving Hut is very clean and the employees are great. We usually get take-out and the girls that work there always take time to interact with my kids. They even bring them books to read while we're waiting. Overall, a great place for vegans and non-vegans alike."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum I have been wanting to come here since I became vegetarian. I'm mad I waited so long. I do live far from this restaurant but I'm happy to know its in my caliber of places to eat on this side of town. I enjoyed the food and staff."}
{"text":"Amazing. The pandan cake is to die for, and I've loved every meal I've ever ordered here. The service can be a little slow, but they're always friendly."}
{"text":"Loving Hut has delicious fresh vegan meals.  Clean friendly atmosphere and staff. One of my all time favorites."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! A bit of a drive for me but whenever I'm on this side I try to stop in. The customer service and food is always amazing!  I highly recommend giving this place a try, even if you're not a vegan they have plenty of options you'll find delicious (I recommend the curry, yum!)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Loving Hut back when they first opened, but these days, service seems very slow and the food generally tastes meh.  I've gone multiple times over the past year, and each time, it seems like I have to wait longer and longer to receive my food and last time, I didn't even finish my meal because the soup was just oily and kind of bland.  Really unfortunate, but I won't be spending my money here anymore."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place!.  Great food options for a Lactose Intolerant person.  Plus I can go with my dad who is Vegan.  I love the Gracious Spicy Noodles (VEGAN PHO!!!)  I also like the Divine Curry Noodles.  The tea's are all great.  Nothing but great things to say about Loving Hut's food."}
{"text":"I was sold on loving hut until I recently discovered they don't even use organic vegetables!!!!! All the glitz and glamour of \"saving the planet\" \"going green\" and advocating forks over knives but they use the cheap pesticide filled veggies everybody else does or possibly worse;GMO! It is a sham! I just assumed they would be organic since thats what being vegan and healthy is all about but it's just more tricks from a business trying to turn a profit from people looking for healthy alternatives. Just call and ask and they will tell you they don't use organic!!! UNACCEPTABLE"}
{"text":"I discovered this place about three months ago and I love it!  Having been a vegetarian all my life I have been to my share of horrible vegetarian restaurants.  Loving Hut is not one of them.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The first time I went our waiter spend about 5-10 minutes answering all our questions about dishes and explaining how to make certain items at home.    When dinning in you will be served a bowl of soup while your order is being prepared.  I would recommend the Spicy Cha Cha (shrimp like dish), Golden Beauty (lemongrass chicken), or the Sweet & Sour Divine (Sweet & Sour Chicken).  My meat eating friends rave about the Mongolian Wonder. Oh the BBQ Rolls are great too!  Some people have issues with this place because of the whole Supreme Master thing but personally it does not bother me.  The staff does not proselytize or try to stuff literature down your throat.    I have my fingers crossed that they will consider offering cooking classes!  That will give me another reason to make the drive out to  35th Ave. & Union Hills Dr!"}
{"text":"The loving hut is amazing. It is clean the food is fresh and above all tasty. I wish we had one in Goodyear."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The staff is so nice. The food is great. We need more restaurants like this in Glendale!"}
{"text":"Tried a new restaurant today and I'm sure happy I did!!! The food was terrific (all Vegan), service was wonderful, it was clean and cheerful.  They had a large menu and I'm looking forward to going back and trying other items."}
{"text":"GREAT food! you know its a good vegan place when your non-veg friends like it enough to go back. everything looked and tasted delicious, packed with flavor! prices are extremely good for the quality and portions of the food. cant complain if you can leave feeling completely stuffed (i eat alot) for about $10.  advice: might want to avoid friday night dinner rush...it was pretty slammed, and my girlfriend didnt even get her drink until AFTER the meal, about 20 mins after ordering said drink."}
{"text":"I had the most wonderful meal tonight....highly recommend you try this place.  The staff was warm and friendly.  The prices are reasonable/fair.  I had the pate chaud, Golden vermicilli, cheese cake and a hot mumbai spirit.  I WILL be back for more!"}
{"text":"Every encounter I've had with vegetarian/vegan food has ended in two ways: (1) \"Ugggh, how do people eat this stuff?!\" or (2) \"Holy hat seller, this stuff is amazing! I'm gonna convert to veganism!!\"  Where did Loving Hut place? #2, hooray! Yes, the food here is actually quite delicious and colorful and fun and healthy and everything it claims to be! We ordered the spicy cha cha and BBQ baguette. The spicy cha cha was veggie-based protein with sliced and diced bell peppers, tomatoes, some onions, and lettuce. It had a good kalamari-like texture with a crispy outside and a chewy (but not frustratingly so) inside. And the bell peppers gave it a good complimentary heat.  The BBQ baguette was essentially a Vietnamese banh mi imitation except they added a couple of untraditional things like a lil tomato slice, mushrooms, and a generous slathering of \"veganaise\" (some kind of vegan sauce?). And yes, while it was delicious, it can't stand up to a real Vietnamese banh mi sandwich. However, I did very much appreciate the presence of pickled carrots and daikon which makes it much more authentic.  I had one of their specialty drinks: the sunny forest, a concoction of orange juice, zesty flower petals, mint, and sparkling water. But somehow, the citrus is completely drowned out by an overpowering sweetness, as if they dumped several spoonfuls of sugar into the mix. Not very appetizing.  So why 3 stars if the food is good? The price. There's no way I can justify the prices here. The portions are criminally small. A small plate of food will average $6-8. You can take that same amount of money, go to a Panda Express, and get 2-3 times as much food. So be wary of dining here often as it may lead to your declaring bankruptcy! hahaha jk. But seriously...  The end! =)"}
{"text":"There aren't too many places available to vegetarians, vegans, or those that just want to eat healthy, so my wife &amp; I were happy to try this place out. Neither of us are vegetarians, but we do try to avoid red meats. Loving Hut did not leave us hungry though. The portions were great and filling."}
{"text":"I gave them two stars for effort, I'll never come back as a paying customer nor recommend it as a great place to eat until sweeping changes are made. I realize there might be a difference from one location to another, though I will not spend my money finding out. I'll start off with what i liked. There is a minimalist inspired though pleasing decor, I enjoy that they are conscientious people with good hearts, offering lots of information (though bordering on propaganda: they use photos of 'famous veg people' on the walls) on the benefits of vegan/vegetarianism, and the menu is a refreshing alternative to mainstream food in America. I am a long-time vegetarian and pro-conscious eating advocate.  Here's what i did not like. Terrible customer service, highly overpriced for what you actually get (not only do the menu photos not match what shows up on the table, the dishes are mostly carbs unless you order a complete veggie dish), an annoying television replaying the same programming, plain/bland food pairings (do NOT order the guru rice--it will only 'teach' you that you made a mistake) and an upcharge for any modifications to your dish: like a whopping $1.25 for brown rice. When I approached the counter the girl at the register was loudly huddled with 2 other employees and was more concerned with handling another issue than with taking my order, and then explained what she was doing instead of taking my order. Unprofessional from the start. I was told when I got seated that there were free refills on my green tea, which I was happy to hear; that is, until it took about 30 mins for me to even catch an employee's eye before they approached and asked if everything was ok. I had to ask for a refill as no offer was made.  I was highly disapponted overall, as I have even visited this location once before and had an amazing first meal and experience. I was hoping that would be replicated; the letdown is real. I would have given this place ONE star if they didnt at least have their hearts in the right place."}
{"text":"Great food, but the customer service needs some work. Yesterday my friend and I drove 25 minutes to pickup our order and she went to pay and it said her card was declined, so she checked her bank accound and it said she had plenty of money as well as that her meal was already charged to her card. After waiting about 10 minutes to talk to the manager, the manager rudely said that they would not be able to give her the food that she paid for. Worst service ever & embarrassing"}
{"text":"Hawaiian burger is delicious!! I love this place and never feel rushed..they even have books on vegan cuisine to read while you are there! Highly recommended even if you are not vegan!!"}
{"text":"Just ordered some take out. Spicy pad Thai, spring rolls and spicy guru fried rice. All were delicious, fresh and flavorful!!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"The best friend is a vegetarian and suggested we try this spot for our girls night.  Of course picking a place with no alcohol is usually not advised, but hey, we're trying!   Since my friend had been here before I got the same thing as her: the golden bowl.  So so so good!  It's so many yummy unique ingredients that you can't stop eating it.  The golden rolls are delicious!    I will for sure be telling people about this great place.  I loved the reasonable prices and I saw so many neat things on the menu I would like to try."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I have tried the rainbow salad and Hawaiian burger on several occasions.  The service is quick and professional.  The food is wholesome and great tasting.  The bathrooms and dining room are very clean.  There is a peaceful vibe to this joint.  Even though it is popular, there seems to be plenty of good seating when I go (even at lunchtime).  I highly recommend this joint.  Eat well.  Be well."}
{"text":"Not only is the service great. Not only is the energy and flow of the space great but the food is so amazing that I do not want to type anymore and just continue to eat. So fresh, so pure, so vegan!"}
{"text":"The best vegan food I've had in my life. Friendly, helpful staff. Save room for the carrot cake."}
{"text":"Possibly the best Vegan eatery in AZ!  We have loved everything we've had here so far. We went Vegan for several months and this place was a lifesaver. The dishes were flavorful and satisfying - we didn't miss meat at all!"}
{"text":"I went in today to purchase some vegan meat replacement options. After watching the documentary \"What the Health\", my family is going to try a plant based diet. The owner of this Lovin Hut location, Lynn, took the time to go over good shopping  places to find Vegan options as well as how to make some common foods. I really appreciate her taking the time and effort to help promote the vegan lifestyle, not just for the sake of her business (which is super impressive, by the way). She is absolutely beautiful and looks at least 15 years younger than what she told me her age is. What a testament to the lifestyle !"}
{"text":"I was a meat lover before coming to this establishment.  I can tell you that the dishes are nothing short of fantastic.  I never knew Vegan food could be this amazing.  I had the spicy noodles, pho, curry, Hawaiian Burger, carrot cake and more.  Every dish appears to be very thought out and made to taste authentic.  I would recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! Healthy, delicious vegan food. What's more to ask!"}
{"text":"Being carnivores, this is only the third time we have been to a vegie restaurant.  We were very impressed.  I had the Mongolian beef.  It really tasted like beef!  Others in our party said the \"ham\" tasted just like ham and the \"chicken\" tasted just like chicken.  The amazing part is that the \"beef\" and the \"chicken\" had a grain to it just like the real stuff.  I didn't see the ham.  None of the \"meats\" tasted like soy.  This recently opened place does have some problems with ordering and service.  Our server brought four forks and two knives for our party of five.  I'm sure the service will improve after they have been open a while.  Another negative is that the menu provided has no descriptions of the dishes!  What are they thinking?  We will be back the next time we are in Glendale.  I think the AZ natives we were with will be regulars."}
{"text":"I used to frequent the Loving Hut back when it was called the 'Vegetarian House' on Indian School. It changed its name several years ago, but I still remember it as one of the only vegan options in Phoenix back in the day.   This was my first visit to the Union Hills location and I brought my mom and my two younger brothers. We were a bit confused about ordering -- as you have to come up to the counter to place your order. Once that was out of the way -- we were very pleased with our visit.  We ordered: Spring rolls appetizer  Fabulous pho chili burger blissful fried rice  The food is delicious and the menu is great as it shows pictures of every item. They even have a freezer full of faux meats to take home and try out. Everyone complains about the Chinese propaganda on the televisions in there, but I think it adds to the experience. Definitely worth a try if you are vegetarian, vegan, or are interested in introducing your family (even kids) to healthy meat-free food."}
{"text":"Very cute atmosphere - excellent tea and desserts.  I took off one star because of no coconut milk or almond milk in their varied drink menu. That dumbfounded me.  Will definitely go back - the pandan cake was great."}
{"text":"The drinks were good I had a 5 star lemonade. No free refills though. My friend was very impressed with the whole setup and wants to come back (it wont be with me). I appreciate what they are trying to do but the food wasn't overly exciting. The cha cha was vegan sure but I'm fairly certain frying it in grease pretty much cancels out the health benefits. The lo mien was dry and blah."}
{"text":"Love the food here. My favorites are the Save the planet curry and gracious spicy noodle soup. I get these all the time and I always order the spicy noodle soup when I am coming down with a cold.  Staff is extremely friendly and they are so welcoming."}
{"text":"My first Loving Hut experience and I loved it. I don't know why I pictured this place to be a sit down and have waitresses serve you, but you actually order at the counter and find a place to sit. They have daily specials which is just between two meals the restaurant decides for the day and today I had Radiant Rice Plate with chickless chunks for $7.25 regularly $9.25. It was so good I finished the entire plate guilt-free knowing it was vegan. If you're craving for dessert, try their pandan cake it was moist and just had the right amount of frosting-which by the way is homemade. Would recommend for your next vegan eatery destination."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this place but I love it here. Even better, it's close to the West Valley where the rest of my favorite places that are vegan friendly are further south.   The people who work here have a sense of humor and a always welcoming. The television program can be a bit much sometimes while eating but it's never stopped me from showing up. I tend to lean toward the orange chicken and tea and the portions are perfect. I have mostly taken meat eaters here and they were all pleasantly surprised and have even gone back with me when getting them to go to other vegan/veg friendly places has been a challenge."}
{"text":"I had my eye on this restaurant for a few months and was finally in the area for lunch. Their food is amazing and there is a good choice of meals. I had a spicy mongolian dish and my belly is very happy!"}
{"text":"Went to Loving hut with my GF for a Vegetarian Society Meet Up.  Food is pretty simple but good and service is fast. If you are in the west valley this is your spot. if you are not in the West Valley check out Vegetarian house for a similar setup.  We got the steak sandwich which was not bad, but nothing to write home about either.  The Supreme Master TV stuff is funny and entertaining."}
{"text":"Great place if you have a hard to please vegan friend like I did.  The food was good and the workers have always been nice.  My husband had a migraine one day while we were there and the woman brought him out of cup of iced chai tea (on the house), she seemed to genuinely want him to feel better and was trying to help.  It also started our lifelong enjoyment of chai tea.  My only issue is that no matter what item you look at getting, there is tofu, soy, or soy protein in everything.  Halfway through my meal the taste of the soy always gets too me and I generally finish everything but that.  I know that it's a large part of a vegan/vegetarian diet but I really with they had a few items that didn't have it.  But the place was very clean and the presentation of the food was also appealing."}
{"text":"I love almost everything on their menu. Super delicious, all of my omnivore friends love this place just as much as I do!! The Hawaiian burger is amazing, guru fried rice yummo, noodle dishes are wonderful. Prices are also really good. Not taco bell cheap but inexpensive considering what you get.  They have amazing french fries, just saying.  The restaurant is very bright inside and always nice and clean. They have recipe videos from vegan youtubers playing (no audio) which is nice, other Loving Huts play corporate videos with lots of volume so this is well appreciated.  Service is also great. Always very friendly but never \"in your face\".  This location is a counter service restaurant which I love. You order your food at the counter, pay, and they bring it to your table and leave you to enjoy your meal in peace. Coming from Germany I can't stand American \"service\" where they bug me (check) every 2 minutes if my 80% filled glass of water needs to be filled up and then expect a 20% tip."}
{"text":"This is the first vegan place I've been to. Overall I was pleasantly surprised. The food was pretty decent. The only complaints I have is that I called my order in an hour ahead and they only started making it as soon as I got there and the \"sauce\" the chickless saute was in was just a little too salty. But like I said overall good experience."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have a good variety of different food options and everything always taste yummy. There can be long wait times during busy hours but it's a really cute place and my favorite go to spot for vegan cuisine."}
{"text":"I had the eggplant dish with vermicelli noodles. Wife had the chow mien.  Both items were greasy and lacking in flavor. Sad, I had high hopes after seeing the reviews. Disclaimer: I am not sure it makes a difference; I am neither vegan or vegetarian."}
{"text":"I love this spot, ladies are always nice and friendly. The Pad Thai is my favorite, spicy with extra nut. I have had other dishes and appetizers and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan by any stretch of the imagining but a co-work told me about this place. So I gave it a try and wow amazing good. The green curry is outstanding.  Does this mean I'm giving up meat or fish NO but it has opened my mind to some healthy food that has wonderful flavor."}
{"text":"I usually always love this place, but last time was so disappointing! My friend and I planned on eating here so I looked forward to it all week. Sadly, the service was incredibly slow. It took at least twenty five minutes to get two orders. We had to ask for the soup they usually give to you right after you order your food. While waiting, there were SEVERAL dirty tables with dirty floors around us (which stayed that way to we were about done eating). The restaurant was not very busy at all. Also, the guests sitting next to us got the wrong order and the employee told the customer that THEY GOT IT WRONG and corrected them for the next time they come in how to order, when really it was the cashiers fault who punched in the incorrect order. Working in the food industry, you never do that to a customer, how rude!! I would be more understanding if the restaurant was busy and short staffed but no, there were three visible girls working up front to attend to the guest needs. I didn't see the owner, so maybe that's why things aren't going very smoothly..."}
{"text":"I have driven by here on many occasions and finally decided to stop in and give it a try.  The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive.  It is a longer wait than most places but the food is cooked after ordered so it gave time for conversation at the table.  My wife and I ordered the golden rolls, which were cooked perfectly.  We also had the spicy guru fried rice and silken moonlight.  The food was excellent for our taste.  The waitress was very sweet and took very good care of us.  I was eyeballing the other dishes at other tables as there were a lot of people dinning in.  They all looked really good and we will definitely return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Returned for second try about a week ago.  Food was much improved   We prdered pho, Fried rice, veggie burgers and something else which I can't remember.  It was all very good we got a huge piece of cake for dessert and split it between two of us.  I will go back if I'm in the area.  I don't know if the menu is the same but for some reason the food was better maybe it was a different cook?"}
{"text":"Went here to grab some take out, wasn't crazy about the carrot juice, but the Chow mien was actually pretty awesome.  Unfortunately I'm the only vegetarian I know, but I'll definitely be back when I'm flying solo. :)"}
{"text":"It's extremely refreshing to try somewhere new where the service is awesome and the food is great! The West Valley needs more places like this - we'll definitely be back. (Can we BYOB next time?!)"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan, so this might be fine for vegan food, but this definitely didn't convince me to go vegan. Even the French fries had some sort of odd seasoning on them that jut wasn't very good. I had the chicken Banh Mi, and I won't be returning. Two stars for the nice people working there."}
{"text":"I was a total Vegan for six months until one day I got so fed up with the fake Vegan soy cheese that I let dairy slip into my diet. Two weeks later I was eating baby back ribs. So I'm no longer a Vegan (obviously) but I still enjoy going Vegan from time to time. Loving Hut always delivers.   They're preaching to the choir. I've eaten at a lot of 100% Vegan restaurants. Loving Hut is a bit over the top on the lifestyle propaganda.  For example on every table they have two plastic signs proclaiming the environmental benefits of a Vegan Lifestyle. They have a rack of flyers doing the same. Who knew 4 ounces of beef took 30,000 gallons of H2O to produce. I'm not sure their clients need to be shamed into eating soy; they look healthy already. They even have a sign proclaiming the benefits of paying in cash versus plastic - of course we all know paper is better for the environment than plastic! Yet they're still using plastic straws. Even McDonalds has started using paper straws.   But enough of the propaganda. The real draw here is the food. The noodle dishes are my goto order, and the have a large selection. The Mumbai Chai iced drink is perfectly flavored.  The Guru fried rice is enough for 3-4 to share. We enjoyed the the Golden Beauty on our last trip in.   I always feel good when I eat Vegan and I feel good when I eat at Loving Hut. But they serve a side dish of guilt to non Vegans. So now I have to consider whether I'm gonna give up baby back ribs and go back to eating fake soy cheese."}
{"text":"VERY GOOD.  The owner always comes over and chats with us and the staff is always so sweet.  I'm vegan, and it's great when I'm craving something that resembles the way I used to eat (i.e. hot dog and french fries).  Their Mumbai Chai is AWESOME and we haven't had a bad thing on the menu yet - and we've tried a lot.  Plus the prices are very fair!  Love it!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Great food, great prices. I could eat here everyday, and not get sick of it. If there was ever a place that could turn you vegan, it's this place. Great for everyone, any age, any lifestyle or taste."}
{"text":"dear supreme master, you are a creepy b.   thankfully there are such delights as the golden beauty, delectable eggplant and free soup ?! order the happy go lucky, because who doesn't like potpourri in their lemonade?  skip the appetizers because they are anything but. the staff is a touch overwhelming, mostly because there is hardly anyone ever here, i mean this place is sparse like whoopi goldberg's eyebrows.   they have annoying north phoenix hours, which kind of sucks because i am a fan of lupper."}
{"text":"I am not vegan or vegetarian but this is my go-to place when hosting vegetarian Couchsurfers. The not-beef is totally indistinguishable from the real thing.  Prices are reasonable and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Ok, I don't know where to start, the phenomenal food or the awesome team (employees)...  So, I'll start with food. A friend of mine, Jeff and I eat here 2 to 4 times a week for lunch and have now for a few years, seriously. I guess we'd be called \"regulars\", right? :) Well, between Jeff and I, we have had every item on the menu and beyond. The food quality is absolutely outstanding and prepared with love. Jeff and I think it's the best in town, and we have been to most vegan restaurants in Phoenix!! Every time we come in we say to each other, \"There's just nothing better than 'The Hut'\"!  Now the team: We pretty much know everyone, and they are ALL just fantastic! Each and every time we step in we are always warmly greeted by all the ladies who serve us....smiles for days!!! We love each person here and are so thankful for their commitment to providing a wonderful dining atmosphere. A special shout out to Lin, Lui, and Caitlyn (sorry, if I misspelled your names).  We will continue to support \"The Hut\" because we care about good vegan food, our health, the environment, and having a blast enjoying it with those who serve and prepare such great food!!  Thank you Loving Hut Glendale for all you do for us and those who eat and share this experience together!!!   Most Sincerely, Stephen"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here for ages and today I finally got to experience the magic for myself (via food delivery app because I was feelin' lazy.) I got the \"Whaddup dawg\" and some fries, a very simple order, but delicious none the less. I definitely want to try more in the future and actually dine in."}
{"text":"My favorite location. As a vegetarian, I love this place. Made getting rid of naughty foods a lot easier for me. The staff is great, environment is also lovely.   All of their food options are great, even their soy meats are tasty. I have considered this one of my favorite places and recommend it to anyone trying to change their diet or already eating alternatively!!"}
{"text":"Strip mall location with a light and bright modest interior. You grab a menu, order at the counter and then seat yourself. I love going to vegan and vegetarian places where I can order anything off the menu. Such a treat!   So I ordered their Spicy Pad Thai with a jasmine tea and hubby ordered their Hawaiian Burger with an iced coffee. Total for our order was around $24 - great prices!   Before our order arrived, we were given a small complimentary hot soup which didn't look appetizing but it was really good. Hubby loved his iced coffee too! I have to recommend the Pad Thai, it's not very spicy but it was delicious and you get a very generous portion. I asked my hubby to help me finish it off, much to his delight. His Hawaiian burger was a bit messy but also really tasty.   Overall, the service was friendly plus the food and prices were great!"}
{"text":"Had their spicy pad thai and it tasted different. My taste buds weren't just into it. I did like the delectable eggplant, nuggets, and the pandan cake. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Very clean. I also tried the Spanish flan, which was not that sweet so you can definitely eat this even if you're diabetic."}
{"text":"Loving Hut has great tasting food and a clean bright atmosphere.  We tried three appetizers and had the Pho as the main dish.  The wontons and Pho were great.  For those who care everything was vegetarian and most items were also vegan.  The staff was friendly and the steam table had a nice lunch selection for $7.50.  Bell Road doesn't have it all, come check this place out!     Note about the décor: I am an omnivore and believe there is nothing intrinsically heroic about being a vegetarian."}
{"text":"Being from Veggie Capital of the planet... Aka  Portland, Or....  I got serious props for this place.  Great food, lots of selection and a very smiley happy crew here. yea it was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Everything is great but they just need either more staff or faster service! The wait is too long, especially if you Are on work lunch..."}
{"text":"The food is great! Just as good as non-vegan choices. I will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"Ordered the pad thai and I must say that it was delicious although it seemed as if there was not enough tofu in the dish I had about 3 pieces of it. The wait for my meal was long we waited about 15-20 minutes for the pad thai to come out wasn't sure if they forgot about my order as I almost got up to ask what was up. I will be returning because it was so good! *I am not vegan I just wanted to try this place out and I LOVED it!"}
{"text":"I'm vegan so naturally I love this place! Such great flavours, and nice service. Only problem was the cheesecake I ordered tasted well.... vegan. I've had other vegan cheesecakes that tasted far better, but the carrot cake slice made up for it! This place hits the spot vegan or not!"}
{"text":"Everyone here is SO NICE. It doesn't even seem like they try hard to be nice. It comes naturally. It's genuine. They are actually willing to help you out. That's what I love most about this place.  The food was scary when I first came here since I am not vegan. I love meat, cheese, and all that jazz. I came here for a healthy meal and that is exactly what I got! I ordered their BBQ Vermicelli salad. It was BOMB! SO GOOD! The Tofu tastes like real meat which was great. The salad was extremely fresh. The spring rolls are really great, too. They are so fresh and crunchy!  Lastly, their chai is BOMB! I love the way they present it in the fancy little cup. It is not overly sweet or watered down/milky. It has just the right spice.  I like to come here from time to time to get a nice salad and delicious chai. I will return (obviously)."}
{"text":"Always fresh and everyone is so helpful, especially ff you are not sure what you want to try.  I love love love No. 36 - BBQ Noodles.  The veggies are so fresh and never wilted.  The ginger vinegar sauce is also fresh.  Must try!!!"}
{"text":"I am in love!! I only wish this was next door to my apartment!   The people are the friendliest I have ever met! So warm and welcoming! These people have service down! They restored my faith in phx area restaurants!  The building is pretty inside, very clean.   The food! We went with the more asian side of the menu, it was to die for but ya know with out all the death being vegan... Everything was very flavorful! I would say each dinner portion was more like 2 dinners for most people.   I highly recommend this even if your not veg! Do your taste buds, body and world a favor and eat lunch or dinner here! Seriously!"}
{"text":"I've been told it's phenomenal...guess what it is! I have hard time finding vegetarian dishes out that are actually good and not fried. There are SO many options here, obviously, and I am now hooked! I'll definitely be back.   Do not let the little strip mall area it's in keep you away. You step inside and you're transformed to a totally different place. It's super clean and even better the food is DELICIOUS and better yet priced just right! I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Been here once.  The staff was friendly, the Hawaiian burger was yummy!  Discounted prices on daily specials are competitive with greasy fast-food joints, but a MUCH healthier healthier option.  Lunch was served quickly and filled me comfortably all afternoon.   I will return!   One request...  That the locations would provide a simple list of menu options online and post their daily specials.  I guess that's two requests!  ;-)"}
{"text":"My brother took my family here earlier today,  we grew up in a vegetarian household my whole life, and let me say, everything was amazing. We got the pad thai, egg rolls, spring rolls, Kung po, and golden something (sorry don't remember the name), even the drinks! The service was incredible and the owners daughter was the cherry on top of our expirence. 11/10 my friends."}
{"text":"Great vegan food! They offer lots of food options from pho, burgers, stir fry noodles and rice. Whatever you feel like eating is pretty much there, even desserts! The customer service was fantastic! They are friendly and very informative when it comes to a vegan life style. They have books available for you to read while you wait for your food and TV's to watch. The environment is great!"}
{"text":"In Phoenix there aren't many vegetarian and vegan restaurants. I've been to Loving Hut in a few different states and they are by far the best vegan chain... They even make vegan flan!"}
{"text":"This place does a great job with vegan food. My ONLY issue is the large amount of sugar they use in many of their recipes. I would eat there regularly if the all the sauces and dressings were not loaded with all that sugar."}
{"text":"Every time I go here they always tell me it takes 25 minutes for them to cook (yet most of it may be packaged) Even when it's not busy they even add more time to there \"supposed\" cooking time. The service is horrible, all employees have an attitude of some sort, and when calling them Gosh for bid they answer the phone and take your order. The food isn't too bad, but you are paying for quantity then quality. Don't waste your money, just make vegan food at home."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed in myself for not taking a photo of my food before I began eating. I have been to the Loving Hut a few times and they have both been pretty good! I always leave here feeling good about myself-not guilty for all the food that I put into my body. I had the Gracious Spicy Noodle soup, and if you are a fan of lemongrass, it is good and a lot of food. This was my first experience with their soy-meat and I cannot complain, I was sold. Their Mumbai Chai is also a solid drink. Their pho is next on my list!"}
{"text":"Really delightful little restaurant.  The chai tea tastes like perfume for the mouth. Flavors I have never experienced before. Highly recommend, very clean and the staff was exceptionally pleasant. I hope this place is appreciated for its flavorful healthy food."}
{"text":"I I am blown away. I took two VERY nonvegan friends. They loved it and said theyd go again. The staff was EXTREMELY warm and willing to change around the dish I ordered to accomodate my raw vegan diet. They answered every question I had, how it was prepared and all the ingredients. Their name is accurate: they ARE loving. The food was delicious, fresh, and plated with intention. The rose drink \"the pink lady\" was actually the best drink ive ever had. As a chef and a raw vegan, I am incredibly appreciative of my entire experience and the clean, radiating pureness of the entire establishment."}
{"text":"Literally vegan heaven. Even my meat eating boyfriend loves it. The food is awesome and yummy every time. Also the cakes are to die for! I want to try some freezer goodies. Let me know if any of you have tried any and which ones are good. Go vegan"}
{"text":"Great vegan food but it takes awhile to prepare it.  I love everything I've eaten there."}
{"text":"If you want to be dissatisfied look no further and come here! lol only thing that has ever looked appetizing to me is the Hawaiian burger. we came here a lot when we first started becoming vegan, but only when we were too lazy to cook dinner. It became a disappointment every time since they knew us I guess? Most the people who work are bitter and must hate their job/ or lives because they are rude and never look happy. The burger itself im pretty sure is not really vega since the pineapple is not fresh, seems out of a can literally. I can tell the difference lol. The bun definitely not vegan or gluten free, seems like as well like a regular bun. The fries really are the only thing that kept me wanting to go but defiantly not healthy at all either obviously lol.. if you arent vegan and you want to try vegan food out Id opt out of this place. Much better options out there.   another reason I stopped coming is I got a LITERAL hair in my burger and let me tell you..I have NEVER gotten a hair in my food anywhere in my life. I used to go out to many places to eat before I went vegan and this never happened to me. When my husband told them about my experience their excuse was the texture of the burger has these strings that can feel like a hair..but I already knew about that texture since the first time I ate it and I tried to ignore that every time I ate it lol...but this was a human hair i pulled out of my mouth..disgusting experience I would never recommend this place if my life depended on it. Go make your own vegan burgers at home and TASTE the difference in quality. lol"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, friendly staff. The food is vegan, but even meat-lovers will enjoy their fresh, unique, and beautifully presented dishes. I can't say enough about how special this restaurant is. I like the golden wontons, spring rolls, wanton harmony soup, save planet curry, guru fried rice, golden rolls. The Indian bread is not served for Guru fried rice. The bread served here was just like a breakfast roll. The food is good, restaurant is clean and staffs are friendly."}
{"text":"I dabble in vegetarianism/veganism here and there, and this place is awesome.  This is a great restaurant for people who are not vegans/vegetarians and want to try it, or think vegan food is \"weird\" (in the words of a friend).  Everything here is flavored so well, and the dishes are delicious. I love all the apps, and have tried several of the entrees and thought they were all pretty good. They also have a fabulous selection of creative drinks. I hope this place sticks around for a long time, since it never seems to be busy when I go. The staff is very open and friendly and knowledgeable about the food, so never hesitate to ask if you're unsure about something!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had here I've enjoyed. The place is clean and you always feel great ( and full ) after you eat here. The loving huts all have different menus - the chefs at each location get to make menu... this one is my favorite. Staff are all on Ecstasy (just kidding) they sure are friendly tho. Save the planet curry with naan is my goto dish."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! Very clean and well kept. Very nice and friendly staff. Everything we order is delicious and we have not been let down! It's also reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"My favorite place ever to eat. Have been going here for years. Always consistent. Always delicious. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes. I wanted a celebration of vegetables, in all of their glory! But all we got was fake-meat-product and oddly pie-eyed cultiness....  We have been driving by \"Loving Hut\" since we moved into the area, and since I was once vegan and am more more of a vegetarian, I have been hopelessly seeking some good veggie options for eating out.   Unfortunately, this was not it.   First off, I am sure that I am not the first person to say this, but,fake meat product, in any form, is gross. It might look meat-like, but it is not meat-like in the taste department. I have never met anyone that was swayed into not eating meat by the introduction of meat-imitation. Just sayin'.   Speaking of being swayed: I felt like \"Loving Hut\" is a little cultish. There were video monitors with a show or channel called \"Master\" somethingrather and the two women talking on it were also in pictures and books all around the restaurant. Us non-meat-eaters already get a bad rap for being culty and pushy when we talk about our dietary choices (which, duh, you should be abiding by too) and I felt like that vibe was totally perpetuated in this place.   As far as the food goes, it was, eh, ok. OK at best, mind you. I think that had there been NO fake meats in just about everything on the menu it would have been a different story... Maybe.   We were served little soups before our meal which were tasty (but I had ordered the Pho, so I was like on soup-overload by the end of it all), the broth was yumtown. We also got some spring rolls which were non traditional, but pretty good. Same veggies as were in the mini soup, for a veggie place I exprected more variety I guess. My  husband got tons of fake meat product (one was fried and it tasted like fried, so duh it was good).   It was pretty in there, too. But the cultishness eeked the decor up to creep level 9, by the time we left.   Summize to say, I am still in search of a veggie friendly restaurant,"}
{"text":"I have been to The Loving Hut 3 times now, and everytime I wonder why it is that i'm going back.  The food is far too overpriced for what it is. Today I called to ask what the lunch special was, and was informed that it was sushi, wonton harmony, and blissful friend rice.  Great, thats what a lunch special usualy includes...small orders of a few different items.  Nope, when i called back to order this special, i was told I was to choose one of the 3, not that i get all 3.  So I ordered the Blissful Fried Rice. When I went in to pick it up, it was ready and thats always a plus to not have to wait on an order that was called in 20 minutes prior.  I then ordered a Mumbai Spirit, or hot chai, and my total came to $10, and I left $1 tip.  When the cashier made my drink she poured a pre-made chai mix into a steaming pot, steamed it for a solid 4 seconds and poured it into what looked like it should be a childs cup, or water cup at any other place.  When she handed me the drink it felt like there was nothing in the cup but foam, and the paper it was made out of.  I opened it up to find that my childs size cup was only filled half way, and i asked her if I could have her fill the cup as I paid $3 for this drink. She told me thats how much you get if you eat in, therefor thats how much i get it if i take it to go.  So to round out my LAST experience at The Loving Hut, I paid $6 for a small container of rice with some bits of carrots, peas, tofu, and cilantro. I would say this order cost them a solid $0.75 to make, and my pre-made 3 1/2 sips of chai that was steamed to a foamy perfection, was maybe $0.40 because of the waste of paper cup.   I REALLY wanted to be able to love this place and eat here often, as there are next to no vegetarian or vegan places around, but for the price I will happily go somewhere else like Mellow Mushroom, who have a few tofu, tempeh, and veggie items, and be able to pay the same prices for food that is delicous."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Takes a little long but the wait is so worth it! Wouldn't be able to tell it was vegan, \"meat\" is so believable!!"}
{"text":"I dropped by Loving Hut today on the raving recommendations of my chiropractor, who is a vegetarian.    The meals look like they are interesting and worth a try.  I tried the Hawaiian Hamburger based on the server's recommendation.  Tasted like a pretty good hawaiian hamburger.  No fakeness.  Even on my way to work with the stuff in the styrofoam box, it smelled like a burger and fries.  I enjoyed the Pink Lady drink.  Very tasty.  They have coffee's there as well... might be worth a try since I'm more into coffee than vegetarian food.  What kicked this place down to 3 stars?  Supreme Master TV.  What a bunch of propaganda!  You'd think Supreme Master Ching Hai was their sister with how much they forced that woman down your throat!  Don't get me wrong, she has great intentions, but that place was bordering on obsession and it was a little too extreme, even for my taste.  I ordered my food and it took 40 minutes to get my food so I could leave and go to work.  I ended up showing up at work late because I had already ordered and I wasn't about to waste the $12 I had spent by just leaving.  The lady apologized to me THREE TIMES.  I'm sorry, but if you have to apologize more than once, FIX IT.  Don't keep coming back to apologize for my to-go order being late.  Being late kind of ruined the whole experience for me, so I'll have to try it again later when I'm not in a hurry."}
{"text":"With the growing consciousness and popularity of health, wellness, and just overall kindness to animals growing I feel this restaurant chain is spectacular at putting these alternative food options in the price range of ordinary people.   I had first encountered this chain in San Diego and loved it. This one is also great. The one critique I would have would be to expand the menu a bit more.  Other than that, friendly staff, prompt service, and good food, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"We visited for the first time mid afternoon during the lunch hours on 9/26/14. It was busy but not to an extreme. We split the  Fabulous Pho soup and the Veggie Tofu Delight entrée. This was an \"Exciting Rice Entrée\" but the rice cost extra. Not a big deal just odd. We ordered the brown rice as well.  At the beginning of the meal, the server brought us out an appetizer on the house!   The food was tasty but I rate it only two stars for the following reason: I judge the portions served by looking at the menu, choosing three meal as in \"three meals a day\" and trying to judge the combined nutritional value. I think in that scenario I would become mal-nourished as both the soup and entrée rely heavily on the noodles and rice to fill you up with just a light top layer of vegies. I am diabetic I NEED more vegies and less carbs."}
{"text":"I'm a veg so you'd think I'd love this place.  The thing is I do...well their food at least.  But their service is pretty crappy. Yet I keep coming back hoping that one day it changes, a year later...NO CHANGE.  They take FOREVER to bring your food out. I'm talking AT LEAST 30 minutes but that's on a slow night. Up to an hour on a busy night.  Tonight,  they \"forgot to put my ticket up\". Really? Yet you managed to bring out half my order before realizing my ticket went missing?? There were 2 parties here before me, how hard is it to put up a ticket on such a slow night. So I have been waiting now for 48 minutes!  The review from Robert L. said it most perfectly! Please refer to his review as well."}
{"text":"Great food, worth the wait. Love the Golden vermicelli and spicy cha cha. Staff are very friendly. The pink lady drink is refreshing!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants.  Great selection for vegans.  Great customer service.  We have tried everything on the menu.  Everything is good."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I will no longer be recommending Loving Hut. Is it because the food tastes like crap? No. Is it due to weird hours of business or bad service? No. It's because it's just too expensive now. Bordering on a complete rip-off.  I got my usual Golden Vermicelli with a side of the Golden Rolls since I really like those (the GV comes with two rolls already). With tax, minus any drink and minus the $1 tip that I felt obliged to add since there was a tip section on the docket, the total was $13.12. I already mentioned that they've hiked their prices from the outdated menu that I got a few months ago, but I took another look at what I got and I'm not impressed at all with the value for money.  Let's break it down. Shredded lettuce, shredded carrots, a half teaspoon of ground peanut with half as much again of finely chopped fried onion, a good amount of noodles (maybe even 20c worth), and a container of extremely watered down liquid - maybe 100 parts water to 1 part sweet and sour sauce? It's not a dip and not a sauce, just something to wet down the noodles with. Maybe 2 slices of julienned cucumber, and their soy protein. Took a photo. Compare today's pic with the first one I took of the same dish. There's even less soy protein now, barely enough for two mouthfuls, and a couple of fried rolls the length and width of my extended middle finger. I'm not sure how expensive soy protein itself is but thirteen spondooliks for that is twice as much as it is worth in terms of raw ingredients, far as I'm concerned.  The place is still clean. The service is still okay. Servers and counter folk are still very polite. Still conveniently located near my work. Still has Super Master on the telly. Still has a posterboard near the counter with bizarre letters and postcards from people verbally flagellating their pudendae about how awesome the place is, and the food is still tasty. Just woefully, WOEFULLY overpriced. This same syndrome exists at Tandoori Times II. I'd eat there AND here three times as often if only they delivered an amount of their food which matches the exorbitant prices they charge.  Am I all about quantity over quality? Hell no. We're talking about a guy who paid over fourteen bucks for a small cube of fois gras on a 2\" square bit of bread w/apricot compote, spent the next thirty minutes drooling over it and the next two years daydreaming about it. We're talking about a guy who just ate mostly lettuce and noodles and got charged twice the price of a lunch almost anywhere else in the local area, except for places like Claim Jumper or Olive Garden. Do I think 2 stars are appropriate a rating? Yelp classifies that as \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" So, yes.  Even if you're a vegetarian, avoid this place. Save your cash. Go to Safeway. Buy a pack of noodles for a buck. Buy a whole lettuce for a buck. Buy carrots for.. you get the general idea. Buy some frozen edamame, mash it all up, squirt a bit of soy and worcester on it, form it into mint-patty-shaped discs and grill. I'm betting that'll be the same nutrition/protein and color as what their stuff is. Just pass on dining at this joint like I will be.  I thought about posting this review for a while. The tipping point was the tiny gnat that I noticed on a piece of lettuce and would have eaten had I not been hunched close over the meal in my cubicle. Could have flown into the container, through the plastic bag etc, on the way out to the car, on the way back to the office, on the way INTO the office from the car. Or could have landed during food prep. I spent the next five minutes visually analysing the rest of the food before realising that there could be more gnats in the fried rolls where I'd have no hope of noticing them. Shrug."}
{"text":"1st time ever here.  I was skeptical at first but after having the Korean barbecue with noodles I was hooked.  The portions are huge so be ready to eat!!"}
{"text":"Food here is great, but I get a really eerie, creepy, culty vibe from this place. Probably the best vegan Asian Cuisine i've had in PHX though"}
{"text":"My guy and I stopped over at the Loving Hut last week after work. The decor is very simple and 'sunshine' like. Lots of optimistic yellow and white.   In a few words, if you like soy (non-meat) options, they have plenty. They also have some all vegetable dishes.   I do understand a  bit of what other Yelpers have had concerns: the Supreme Master TV running in a loop on the flatscreens, but to me it was all positive messages and nothing disturbing.  It's nice to see a place of business do something out of the mainstream and stick with their (all positive from what I could tell) beliefs.   Considering this is a vegan restaurant, the menu is quite large. There seem to be more soy meat options than anything. I am still on the path of going vegetarian (meaning I still eat some chicken and fish every now and then when I am desperate). ...I, personally, prefer to eat vegetarian or vegan in a more traditional way -- meaning I don't really want items that resemble meat/taste like meat. I prefer items that contain vegetables, lentils, beans, nuts, etc...  My guy went with the BBQ rolls and I had the Hawaiian Burger. The BBQ Rolls and accompanying sauce were pretty good - simple, light and tasty.  The burger had a homemade soy patty and pineapple, mushrooms, and onions. It had a very original taste and was filling.   I say give this place a try. It's healthy and there's an option for anyone open to non-meat options."}
{"text":"Two stars because the vegan spicy noodle (bun Bo hue) was acceptable and I like the concept. However, the pad Thai my boyfriend got was unbelievable... Soggy noodles, tasteless with a few pieces of broken tofu..... It's nowhere near pad thai. Oh and Super overpriced?! I guess I will save the world in another way"}
{"text":"The best vegan restaurants in Arizona. Curry soup, Pho, summer rolls, heaven rice rolls, BBQ noodles, Hawaiian burger and carrot cake are all excellent. Loving Hut serves amazing food! We have been to locations around the world and all are consistently DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great vegan food, even for people that aren't vegan!"}
{"text":"This loving hut it a block away from my house. The first time I came here I got the Indian Curry which I did not totally care for. But I decided to come back as my sister and mom were obsessed with the things they got.   I decided to try the Wonton soup that my mom raved about. Holy YUM! this soup is FILLED with tons of veggies and noodles with delicious broth. It comes with 3 wontons on the side that I usually put right in my soup until they are soft and delectable. The portions are so big I always have left over for the next day, and a generous amount left over at that.  I will say that the only downside is the wait time. I have been in here when there is 3 people and I have been in when it is busy.. no matter how many people are ahead of you, the wait time is always 20-30 mins. So if you are looking to get right in and out, probably not the first choice. But definitely give this place a try even if you aren't a vegan (i'm not)... you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food and super friendly staff.  I'm so happy to have a healthy option for going out to eat in my area.  I will be frequenting this restaurant.  Love it!  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm I've been wanting to try this place for quite a while so when a friend from work who is vegetarian had a birthday I thought prefect time to try it out! I ordered the spicy cha cha which is a faux shrimp dish made out of yam protein. It was amazing! We also tried the veg pot stickers which were so-so in my opinion. My friend had a tofu and noodle dish called silken moonlight which she liked. We also due to a mix up on the called in order ended up with golden beauty a soy protein 'chicken' dish with lemongrass and spice. My personal favorite was the spicy cha cha. I will definitely be back!  This review was written by a non-vegetarian ;)!  Meals range from 6-8 dollars. Drinks are kinda pricy at 2-3.50. No sodas here! The happy go lucky drink was tasty made with lemon and lime juice, lime zest , rose petals and rose flavoring. A little sweet but good and very pretty."}
{"text":"Whenever we are in North Phoenix on a Friday as we head sometimes head on out of town, we try to make this one last pit stop for one of our favorite vegan places.  Not necessarily on par with the one in central phoenix, but the food is till quite \"noble\" (a word often used in some of the videos that play on the television in the place).  We have never really gotten to know any of the servers there as they seem to change often, but the service is still efficient.   The food selection is quite varied, and the soup they give you as part of introductory offering is a distinctly satisfying.   Two notable differences about this place that is different from the other Loving Hut is that they do offer a lunch buffet, except during the summer. And you have to walk up to the counter to place your order.   This is a common mistake that new visitors often encounter as they sit down as if they were in a restaurant waiting for a server to come and take their order.   When you come in, peruse the menu, walk up to the counter, place your order and pay, and the servers will take care of the rest.  After that, enjoy the meal!"}
{"text":"I first went to Loving Hut on the second day it was open. I ordered the Chow Mein, which was good enough, but nothing special. I also ordered the cheesecake, which won me over a bit more. The service was extremely slow, but I figured it was because of it being the first week. Overall, the experience was satisfying, but not great.  Since then, I've gone quite a few more times and ordered the Hawaiian Burger as well as the Steak Sandwich, both of which I highly reccommend! The service has picked up a bit, but of course, it takes a little longer than your average restaurant. However, the various soups that you're given while you wait for your meal are delicious and well worth it. The Pink Lady drink is also really good, as long as you can get over the fact that you'll look like you belong on \"Sex and the City\" while you're drinking it.   Overall, 4 stars to Loving Hut for giving the city of Glendale something good for once."}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian but I enjoy vegetarian/vegan food on occasion. I have seen this place for a while and never made it in. I went for the first tme recently and the food was excellent!! I definitely didnt feel like I was eating vegan food. The prices were great and the service was decent. The only thing that wasnt my style was that the tv only shows the leader of their cult talking about their beliefs. However, this really didnt affect me at all because I went with friends and didnt really watch the tv. Due to the nice atmosphere, the awesome prices and delicius food - I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Great service and yummy food. I got their Hawaiian burger with fries and the Hawaiian tea. Both were great, although the fries lacked in flavor. The burger was out of this world and was amazing. The owner is such a nice and carrying owner. Great service."}
{"text":"Good vegetarian fare, except so much Tofu.  Tofu is made from soy, which is something like 90% GMO.  Even for organic tofu, it is not very healthy for your hormones."}
{"text":"Discovered this place via Phoenix New Times Best Of and I'm super happy I know it exists!  The spring rolls were so good I had 2 orders.  The BBQ Noodles totally fooled me.  I had no idea vegan food could be so delicious!  This is going to be a staple in my Vegetarian adventures!"}
{"text":"Attention vegans, you can eat it all. Everything on the menu. No meat, eggs, or dairy, however I bet cows did help make the fertilizer that was used to grow everything.  The hardest part is deciding what to order. Usually a menu has one two veggie options not 20+.  The menu has a few different areas, one has dinner food, like chili dogs and burgers. The other has Asian food and a touch of Indian. There are also appetizers that also seem skewed Asian and there are soups.   The ambiance is a bit lacking, bright and very white bland would be the best way to inside, you order at a counter and they will bring you your food.  We started with a mock fried shrimp with peppers (cha cha) its a was great however it was hard to get the two items in to your mouth at the same time. The spring rolls were nothing special. The veggie pho` was decent."}
{"text":"I'm a connoisseur of vegan eateries and appreciate how many locations Loving Hut has (not too common for vegan food). Their \"meat\" is decent enough, but not necessarily spectacular in the vegan \"meat\" universe. The noodle dishes are always a safe bet if you want something savory and filling. The Spicy Cha Cha is also wonderful (at every Loving Hut location).  Their pandan cake, however, is my favorite cake in the world. My boyfriend even special ordered an entire one for my birthday and I ate every last crumb (over the course of a week, don't freak out). It's so pretty and angelic looking on the outside, then BAM! It's green when you cut into it (but a refreshing green hue like green tea). I want a pandan wedding cake for sure!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved everything here! It's nice to have a vegan restaurant in Glendale. Started with the Golden Rolls. Delicious veggie \"egg\"rolls that were not greasy. A complimentary cup of soup with clear broth and carrots followed. I had the Spicy Cha Cha faux breaded shrimp based on others' reviews. Completely delicious and highly recommended! My date ordered the Sweet & Sour Divine (faux chicken). We were not charged at all for our rice as mentioned by other Yelpers. Perhaps they caught wind that people disliked their rice charging policy because the woman taking our order made it known that they will be charging for rice in the future, but not that day. We finished with the carrot cake which was delicious! They have a freezer and cooler filled with retail items including the faux shrimp. Vegans, omnis, and flexitarians alike will like Loving Hut!"}
{"text":"Food and service was super good! I will definitely be making more stops here. I wish I would have discovered this place sooner. The curry and pad Thai were very tasty"}
{"text":"See the amazing family  attempt to eat vegan!!  Watch the brave kids eat fake burgers!!  Observe the care and balance of the waiter/server/host  who attempts to amuse the meat eating group as they  balance the high wire of going green!   We had a fun and adventure trying out the local vegan place that we would love to love.. but it's just not  in our future.   Fresh and bright inside , the decor screams: I am earthy , and healthy and well thought out .  I give it two thumbs up for the refreshing design. ( except that blasted TV with \"SuperiorMaster\"  TV channel from a Satellite Planet located somewhere near the moon of vegan.  The place was empty at 4 , I hope they have more business later , they really need a better location and more informative signage.   We gave a shot trying out Vegan burger with fries, they tasted okay from all accounts but not enjoyed. My husband had the only winner at the table \"Cha Cha Chicken\"  tasty and good texture. I would order it if you made me go back . My meal was the loser ..it had 5  fake shrimp and big huge bright green bean pods ..very snappish ..I felt well Beaned.    Youngest kiddo avoided the whole adventure with a bowl of  rice ..wimp.   We all decided if we were vegan we would like this place and be happy to come back .. but we are  steak loving, dairy drinkers with our eyes on the leftovers in the fridge when we came back. On to another adventure!"}
{"text":"This location has different items from the location in CA (milpitas), so I have ventured out a little bit and tried different things. I love the way they make their vegetarian food so flavorful and it doesn't feel like I'm not eating meat. Definitely getting a lot of protein.   I really like their appetizers. The spring rolls, bbq rolls, and deep fried wontons are really good, I like the sauce. I liked their rainbow salad, which is similar to the heavenly salad at the milpiltas location. The blissful fried rice and silken moonlight are tasty, although a little bit oily. I really liked the vietnamese style crepe. It was really good considering it was vegan style. One of the servers recommended that I try the pink lady drink. It was good, tasted like a cranberry smoothie. I wasn't digging the flowers in it though.  Definitely a good place, it's a little more pricey than your usual vietnamese/chinese joints though"}
{"text":"Just a wonderful place to eat great food.  A wide variety of menu options, and a helpful, cheerful staff, all make for a great experience.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!!  Here's my story.  I recently became a vegan (5 days today to be exact) after watching a Netflix documentary called \"What the Health\".  Those that seen this can understand where I'm coming from.  I am also type 2 diabetic and my doctor just added another medication to my daily life.  I have done pretty good and completely avoided all dairy, meats and other bad choices in my diet.  As I continued to explore my new health path I was informed of this place and decided to give it a try.  I'm so glad I did.  This place is awesome and everything I ordered tasted just as good as the non healthy ones I used to eat.  I will definitely return and continue my path to good health."}
{"text":"So I have to preface this review with a disclaimer: I am not vegan and do in fact currently enjoy an omnivorous lifestyle.  There, I said it.  In light of this admission, I must confess that Loving Hut has given me serious pause to re-evaluate my views on a vegan diet. Not only was this hands down the best vegan food I've ever experienced, it was simply a superb meal no matter your tastes or dietary affiliations.  The interior is clean, modern, and inviting. Grab a menu and order at the counter when you're ready. They'll bring the food to the table when it's done. The menu offers a varied selection, from burgers and fries to Asian and Indian inspired cuisine, at very reasonable prices. The staff was welcoming, friendly, and helpful.   I ordered the Kung Pao and my wife had the Spicy Cha Cha. Our food was delivered quickly. The Kung Pao was spicy and incredibly flavorful, and the meatless chicken was truly good (again, I'm a meat eater, so this is high praise indeed) with an excellent texture and taste. My wife loved the Spicy Cha Cha, commenting that it wasn't as spicy as the name implied but delicious all the same.   We also ordered the hot chrysanthemum tea, which was wonderfully floral but not overwhelmingly so. Nicely balanced.  I very recently began flirting with veganism. Loving Hut was an eye opening dining experience, demonstrating that I don't have to \"sacrifice\" the pleasure of a tasty meal in order to kick my carnivorous tendencies. If you're like me, undecided about taking the plunge into the vegan pool, do yourself a favor and try Loving Hut. I think you'll find the water's just fine!"}
{"text":"For my first time,so far so good. I ordered the spicy pad thai noodles and added bok choy to it. The pad thai was good,a tad bit too much ginger in it and it could be a little sweeter. But,overall,it tasted very good for being vegan. I will add that I am not a vegan,and this place has impressed me. I will be coming back to it.  I also ordered the iced mumbai chai. It was very delicious.  Bottom line,I will definitely be coming back. Even if you're not a vegan,give this place a try. Worth it! :)"}
{"text":"I am not a vegan or vegetarian, but health conscious when I can be. I loved the new foods and different flavors. If I can back, it would have to be without my husband since he was less than sold on the place.. Loved the flavored water!"}
{"text":"Loved this place so much !! I had the amazing bbq noodles and the rolls with avacado. My husband had the Mongolian \"beef\" and he said it was the best Mongolian beef he's ever had ! Love this place. Such a vegan gem"}
{"text":"Yes this is a vegan house !! But if I didn't tell you , you would have never known. Everything here is good. The lemon grass soups are very refreshing. Very good alternative to eating meat. Do your body a flavor hahah ( I know that was dumb) Chill on the meats once in a while. When you do you will thank me and your cardiovascular system will too ..... Come to think of it the animals will thank you to ( I know corny hehe )"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out on a whim, and we were so pleasantly surprised! As soon as we walked in were we greeted and welcomed, very friendly. The menu and options were explained to us. So many delicious choices! We just started eating vegan and so we have a lot to learn about recipes and variety of foods to eat. We ordered the Hawaiian burger (amazing), vermicelli bowl, beefless sandwich and the carrot cake (amazing). Everything tasted so good, we will definitely be back! Also loved the staff - very friendly, explained ingredients and were patient with questions. They also have cooking videos playing on how to cook vegan food. Loved the atmosphere. Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Their food was delicious, not disappointing at all. Will definitely be a regular. My favorite item was the \"oink in the blanket\" lol"}
{"text":"Loving hut is one of those places you go to that you know is divinely inspired.  The food was excellent, the wait staff was extremely friendly and very caring.  Beautiful inside and out.  Carrot juice was the best I have had in a long time (I know it is just carrot juice).  You could tell it was made with love though.  Highly recommend the super delicious vegetarian food at this fine establishment."}
{"text":"For some reason I thought this little vegan restaurant was a craft store. I have no idea why that impression came to me, but it was probably because of the logo.   My boyfriend and I found this place on yelp, and once my craft store assumptions were put to rest we decided to try it. We ordered two appetizers, two main dishes, and a dessert-- all for $20! Everything was fantastic! And I can't wait to go back for seconds!  Someone commented on the lack of atmosphere, which is understandable, however, it is important to remember that this establishment offers cheap, delicious, vegan food. I think the fact that it resembles an IKEA is forgivable if we take these truths to heart."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am not a vegan or a vegetarian.  But I do love eating vegetarian every once in a while.  That being said, this place is not bad.  I think that its a little weird that they make soy/plant protein look like meat, I'd prefer just tofu rather than a weird textured, processed protein patty.  My girlfriend's eggplant was delicious.  I got a combo that came with a stir-fry and a fried protein patty.  The stir fry was good, but the protein patty really had a weird texture to it.    However, none of the food had anything on the chai tea.  Freaking delicious.  I've been looking for a good chai tea since I moved here from Texas, and this place knows how to make a good chai.  Most of the chai you get around here is in a latte form (too sweet and not enough spice).  It was a little on the expensive side $3 (I think), but I would come back just for the Chai."}
{"text":"Time for a review update... My initial \"oh-my-god-there's-a-vegan-restaurant-a-mile-from-my-house\" infatuation is now over. I live very close to LH, so I go there a lot.  Loving Hut is pretty good, they have some very tasty dishes (Spicy Cha Cha, BBQ Bagutte are some of my favs) and they have some not so great dishes.  The real reason for my drop-down in stars is that it's always a pain in the arse to order what you want at Loving Hut. You would think that a vegan restaurant would be totally okay with substitutions, omissions, etc (as that's what vegans must do at most restaurants), but no, it's always a royal pain at loving hut.  The other day my wife wanted to try the \"Tuno\" (faux tuna) sandwich on the baguette roll instead of sliced bread. I called in to place a phone order and tried to order it. I made it clear that I would be happy to pay a bit extra for the baguette bread if necessary. Didn't matter. They would not do it. No way, no how. I tried to bargain with the phone employee who blamed it on someone else and said she had to go \"check with the cook\" if it was possible. How would it not be possible to use a different type of bread that they already have? Either way, they would not budge at all. So I couldn't get what I wanted, very annoying and frustrating.  I've also tried other substitutions and dish modifications and it's always a pain.  They no longer give free refills on Iced Tea (citing costs), which is disappointing.  One day I asked about the complementary appetizer soups that they give in store, asking if I could get it for to go orders. The employee I spoke with explained that they don't give it out on to go orders because of soup container costs, but if I brought in my own soup container they'd be happy to give me some. So the next time I placed a to go order, I brought in a little plastic soup bowl and requested some. They barely gave me any soup in it and they gave me a hard time about it.  Bottom line is that they need to be better at providing what the customer wants and less about penny pinching, as it is very annoying and it does not make me want to go back.  Changing up the menu by offering unique, limited time dish specials would also greatly improve the place, as much of the menu seems to be very similar (the same flavored soy protein is in just about everything).  Hoping they can improve..."}
{"text":"I went visited Loving Hut again tonight. We ordered a few different things, including the pho I mentioned in my last review.  Everything was delicious. They made my pho with tofu rather than the soy meats and they actually suggested extra vegetables. It was so delicious!  Thanks Loving Hut!"}
{"text":"I like their food as a healthier alternative when I am trying to be healthy.  I like everything about them except that some tables have a sticky feeling like its dirty.  They told me it is from the laquers for the decals.  I wish they would replace those tables, so I just pick a different one.  Everyone there is nice and I have never had a bad experience (except for the disliking SOME of the tables)"}
{"text":"Every time I go past this restaurant I stop, it is very clean, the foods are organic and delicious, the staff is very friendly, even in the clientele is very passive due to eating a good diet this is a nice place to dine,"}
{"text":"Made it out to this Loving Hut during my last trip to Arizona. I was in NEED of some fried soy protein goodness. So at this location, you walk in, grab the menu, order at the front, and then sit down with a number. They'll bring the food to your table once your order is ready.   What we ordered: golden nuggets, save the planet curry,  amazing saute, and royal spicy noodle. Oh my goodness, the golden nuggets were SO good. Definitely something I would order again, especially if I'm craving fried food. My friends seemed like the save the planet curry. It does cost a few dollars to add noodles, naan, or rice to the curry, but the portion is giant so I feel like it's worth the price. The royal spicy noodle was good, but had a super strong lemongrass flavor. If lemongrass is not your friend, I would stay away from it. The star of the show for me was definitely the amazing saute. The chickless soy protein was tossed in a delicious sauce with a bunch of onions and green peppers which are literally two of my favorite veggies. I would highly recommend it!  Service was great overall and I felt like the staff was super helpful. I would highly recommend going to this place if you get a chance!"}
{"text":"My mom and I tried this restaurant at the recommendation of my hairstylist and I have to say, it did not disappoint. We were seated quickly and our waitress was both friendly and helpful in answering our questions about the menu. It's not always easy to find delicious vegetarian food, but with dishes like the Saigon Rolls and the Hawaiian Burger using plantbased proteins, you don't miss real meat at all. My favorite thing there is actually the Pink Lady drink made with cranberry juice, vanilla soy milk and topped with pretty rose petals."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and each time I've had a stellar meal. I came here a few days ago with my boyfriend and got the spring rolls and spicy Pad Thai. Everything we had was soooooo tasty. I love that you get a little bowl of soup at the beginning of the meal.   The spring rolls are fried and have a wonderful dipping sauce. The vegetables inside tasted great. My spicy Pad Thai was amazing. The heat was just right and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The food was so good we both said we could eat here every day.   The staff was super attentive and friendly. If you're in the mood for great vegan food or you want to try out vegan food this place will now disappoint!"}
{"text":"I gave up meat on Friday's for lent. My first time to loving hut and had spicy pad thai. I really liked it. Service was nice too. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Interesting crowd of people, weird decor and too many peace/love/save the animals propaganda everywhere.  I ordered the golden rolls which were very tasty as an appetizer. For entree, I ordered the Save the Planet Curry. It was gross. It was lukewarm, claimed to have tofu which I pretty much found 2 pieces and the curry taste was very very bland. Its scary when you can't decipher what is what in your curry \"soup\" because it all is covered in the lukewarm yellow \"curry\" sauce. I was really craving curry and this didn't help. Do not order the bread, order rice because otherwise you have no substance for a meal except a small piece of indian bread. My girlfriend ordered the hawaiian burger which was a lot better than mine and Im the vegan and this place is supposed to be known for their ethnic food??? The menu has a lot to offer but either their photos don't do justice or the descriptions of the food isn't very appealing. Not sure when i'll come back since nothing on the menu stood out to me or looked \"amazing.\"   Half their desserts weren't available, so I ended up with the chocolate cake which was dry."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place! I have been a vegetarian for over 7 years and this was my first time going to an all-vegetarian/vegan restaurant.  It's so amazing being able to order anything off of the menu.  The menu is full of different types of meat substitutes which is great, not just vegetables on a plate.  Everything was delicious, I can't wait to go back and try everything off of the menu."}
{"text":"To say that I was floored by the Loving Hut would be an understatement.  I had the Save the World Curry (which was essentially a yellow curry) and it was AMAZING!.  My friend and I also drank the green tea: it was so clean and fresh and authentic.  The service was friendly and attentive.  As someone who is not vegan, I was impressed by the pleasant flavor and texture of the food: I didn't miss the meat at all.    I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It's been over 10 years since I've become a vegetarian &amp; had Pho. My mom &amp; I were in town for a short getaway &amp; I am so thankful to have found this restaurant. Talk about LOVING!??? We started off with the wonderful lentil soup (on the house no less) and then went on to the spring rolls (gone in 60 seconds!). My soup was better than I remembered &amp; from the silence across from me, my mom's BBQ Vermicelli was excellent as well. We spoke to one of the women behind this restaurant &amp; she was so gracious and happy to see our bellies full of love. I swear it felt like this place changed me from the inside out &amp; I needed it. I hope they come to Chicago very soon, we need some LOVE here too!"}
{"text":"I tried LH last week before thier Grand Opening. I was definatly surprised by the various types of dishes they offered.   I opted to chicken out and get the fried rice with soy chicken. IT WAS GREAT.   They mentioned that the steak wrap and burger are the best tasting dishes but I was a little bit afraid to eat a fake burger. lol  They offered me a couple glasses of Lemonade while I waited and it might have been the best I have ever had.   The prices seemed reasonable and the place was spotless.   I will be back and maybe I can raise it one more star."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! The food is so good and you don't even know you are eating vegan. We had the pho soup, rice bowl, and side dish of amazing sauté and Saigon rolls! YUM!"}
{"text":"Non-Vegan Veggie Lover writing this!   The decor is pretty lackluster BUT my sister has been a fan of Loving Hut ever since she took on a Vegan diet. I had the Mumbai Chai which is an experience in and of itself. By far the BEST chai I've ever had! My only complaint was that I saw the bottom of the milkshake glass it's served in FAR too soon.   I also ordered the vermicelli bowl (like I would at most any vietnamese restaurant). The golden rolls that were served with it had a strange texture to me, almost a sogginess to the inside but my sister swears by them. The rest of the vermicelli bowl was spot on though!  Even the faux meat was very tasty and I found it to be more filling than the other versions I have had.   4 because it was crowded at dinner time and a little slow. Also, not a lot of smiles from the servers. My sister says they are usually friendly when she goes."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  I've gone there twice now and everything I've had so far has been delicious.  I've had several items off the menu and have no complaints on any of them.  The ones that stand out for me are the Hawaiian burger, the spicy cha cha and the iced Mumbai chai.  I can positively say that I'll be back again for some more delicious food."}
{"text":"I have been to many Loving Huts and this one has the largest menu in the Valley. I often get the Golden Vermicelli and it never lets me down we were celebrating so I also got a piece of chocolate cake which I have been dreaming about ever since. Sadly this location is not close to me so there won't be any frequent trips but whenever I am in the area I will stop by. Heads up all Loving Huts close during the middle of the day and reopen for dinner check the hours before you stop by."}
{"text":"Loving Hut was recommended by an acquaintance, so I ventured out with my daughter to experience something new. I was pleasantly surprised how good the food was and you wouldn't even realize it was vegan. Great selection, great flavors and nice atmosphere! I will definitely return."}
{"text":"If you're into vegan foods or are vegan, you'll love this place! I've been here at least 4 times and every time is amazing. My favorite is the Buddy burger with seasoned fancy fries. Everything here is 100% vegan and tasty. Waiting for food might take awhile but in the end, it's worth it. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Fantastic VEGAN food, clean nice environment, great wait service. And you can buy groceries too. I was very impressed and so happy to find this place in North Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I am always thrilled to see a vegan restaurant and will come here when in the area. The low stars are for a few reasons. First there are way too many processed fake meats on the menu. Hard to avoid them. Second, everything is an upcharge. Third, the veggies are not the star of the plates. Very limited options and my lunch today was cabbage, carrots and broccoli. Boring and mainly cabbage. I love the concept but untill there are better whole food choices I cant give it a higher rating."}
{"text":"One word: AWESOME. Only wish they were closer to my house in Buckeye. :) Have eaten here once...I got a chicken dish. It was the best faux chicken I think I've ever had. This place is such a refreshing change to all the other predictable meat-and-potatoes chain restaurants in the area. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I came to the loving hut for lunch today! I think the food was good! I had the Hawaiian Burger! It tasted good! The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the service was slow! The iced coffee was just okay! I would have liked to see some fresh juice options that don't include so much sugar! All their juices are fruit juices full of sugar!"}
{"text":"I tried this place twice. It was fantastic. I got the pho, spring rolls and pandan cake. The pho was delish! I am not the biggest fan of fake make but it was good. The portion size was hearty as well. The spring rolls had crispy vegetables and good as well. The cake was sweet and moist. I would buy all three again.  I returned a day later and bought chow mien with no fake meat, extra tofu. It was awesome! There was a a lot of veggies broccoli, cauliflower, onions, carrots, cabbage and bok choy. I will definitely be back. Its a different atmosphere then the one on Indian school."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was a little worried about going to a \"vegan\" restaurant but I was wrong. This is a hidden paradise inside! I had the Pad Thai with Tofu and it was amazing! My friend and I shared a piece of chocolate cake for dessert that was equally delicious.  I look forward to visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"This was a VERY PLEASANT surprise.  The food was phenomenal and the service was excellent.  I had never been to an all vegetarian restaurant let alone a vegan.  My lunch companion is a vegetarian and she had nothing but praise for this place.  We shared the 'Spicy Cha Cha' and the 'Sweet & Sour Devine'.  One word ... YUMM-O for both.  We left saying that we had to return SOON."}
{"text":"Their mock chicken is amazing, the golden rolls with sweet and sour... YUM YUM!! And the Pandan cake is divine."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing every time I eat here and the service is awesome! Everyone is so nice and friendly. Recommend 100%"}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner tonight after reading the reviews on how awesome this place was, and never having actually had gone to a vegan/vegetarian restaurant, this place is delicious. It's true about the wait on how long the food takes to come out, it does take a little while but it's totally worth it. You can tell it's all super fresh and made to order. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"You might think there is nothing on the menu at this quaint little vegan restaurant that children would go for.  Depending on how picky your kids are, you may be right.  My kids will eat plain white rice, spaghetti with sauce and french fries, though.  This was my second visit.  I took my nearly 4 year old with me.  She likes the soup, ate spring rolls, pasta and had a smoothie.  I had a pleasant vegan lunch.  The people here are always friendly and calm - there's no feeling like you have to race through your meal so they can get the table back.  That being said, this isn't fast food so you do have to wait for it and I haven't tried the takeout so I don't know if you could eat and be out in 30 minutes.  They prefer if you pay in cash - I was thanked specifically for it today.  You order at the register and pay and they bring the food to your table.  There are a lot of vegan/vegetarian promotion signs, books, etc here so if you are bringing a meat eater who would be offended by the \"propaganda\" be aware of that.  Personally, I think if they are willing to try a vegan restaurant in the first place they won't be too upset about it.  The food is good, but I prefer the non-meat-substitute entrees like pad Thai and Spring Rolls over the \"burgers.\""}
{"text":"Ventured here on a weekday night to test out the vegetarian / vegan food.  We had the spring rolls- it was not that good, just average. Have had much better. Needed to use a lot of sauce to give it a taste.  Mumbai ice tea was pretty good!  Pad thai- solid, but the noodles were not tasty. However, they used a lot of carrots and other vegetables.   Soy meat noodles - something like a brocoli and beef but the vegetarian style. pretty solid. seemed fresh.  We came about 30 minutes before closing time but while we were eating the server asked us to take our dishes. made us feel unwelcome and rushed. that was not very professional."}
{"text":"I am so excited yet so sad! I'm so excited I found this gem but so sad it took this long! I am in love with this place!  My mom and I came here today for lunch! The staff was so nice and very helpful since it was our first time there. The atmosphere was very relaxing and it was extremely clean.  I loved all the options you could do for with each dish! SFO and GFO!! So great!!  Veggie pho- this is the SFO option and it was delicious!! We loved adding the hoisin sauce for extra flavor! Not that it need it!   Blissful fried rice- amazing!!! Taste was great! We got this GFO. It came out just right!  Banana cake- THIS. IS. HEAVEN. We loved it! The icing tasted like butter! The cake part was perfection, moist and light.  I am beyond excited to come back and try out all the other vegan options, especially the desserts!! This is truly a diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"Love me some Loving Hut!  Believe it or not, I went to this Loving Hut before going to the one in my hometown!  I love the location of this restaurant, close to my work, which is typically why I visit Phoenix.  The restaurant itself is decent sized with plenty of seating.  I love the educational décor and the grocery freezers with vegan goodies including faux meats and other treasures.  They also have some vegan dog food, clothing and accessories.  Always a plus!  As for the food.  Yum!  Every time I have been here I have enjoyed the food!  I enjoy that they have a traditional American food menu including burgers and spaghetti?!  It's nice to have a place that you can get a nice big bowl of vegan pho and go back the next day for a vegan chilidog!    I have some favorite vegan Vietnamese restaurants in Sacramento that still take the cake as far as \"favorites\" go, but Loving Hut is a blessing while I am traveling on business!"}
{"text":"Great Vegan food. Well priced and nice staff. Very impressed.  They even have Vegan Hot Dogs   It's very clean ..I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff and I love that they have soy free options. It is extremely hard to come across that in vegan restaurants. My food was okay, and my boyfriend loved his pho. I do think we'll be coming back simply because he loves pho and the workers were all very nice.  Edit: We came back a few more times and have realized that the food is really hit or miss. The beef & brocolli and pho are great, but some of the other items like the chow mein missed the mark for us."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants, try the guru fried rice, save the planet curry, or buddy burger! Great place to take vegan or non vegan friends."}
{"text":"As a vegan this place makes my heart sing!! The food is delicious, the staff are supper nice, and what the company stands for makes this restaurant one of my favorite places to go. I bring my non-vegan friends here and they love it as well! Most dishes you wouldn't even know are vegan! I would recommend this place to anyone and if you like Asian style dishes get the Golden BBQ Bowl."}
{"text":"Sad to say, not a good experience today... it was not the food... well sorta the food, or lack thereof. Ordered 2 entrees, one came out and about 10 minutes later, still no 2nd entree... wasn't even started or if it was, it was Just started. It's rude to eat when someone else was still waiting. We were told different stories, from \"they can't tell the cooks how to prepare a tables order\" so they can go out at the same time, to, one person cooks this entree and another person cooks the other entree... then it was that they have new people working in the kitchen. We got the money back and they kept both orders... the one that was cold and the other that took an addition 15 minutes to show up after we asked for a refund. Loved the place.. the food is Awesome, no if ands or buts, but there were too many excuses this trip and we had to ask where the other entree was... if they knew they were behind, let the customer know... ask if it would be ok to serve one without the other order, hold the one order till the second one is ready... something... not assume it's acceptable. Does anyone know of another vegan place???"}
{"text":"Guru Fried Rice, delicious. Pate chaud, delicious. Pad Thai, delicious. Everything here is great tasting and cruelty free. The only things I haven't really tried are the vegan American foods such as the hotdogs and spaghetti. Mainly because the Asian inspired are more what  they are known for. My mom also bought the soup broth packet from their market section and it came out wonderful tasting. Just throw in your favorite veggies and you're good to go!"}
{"text":"Living in San Francisco I would frequently see this place, but would always decide on a non-chain veg place instead. Here in Az it's a lot harder to find an all vegetarian or vegan place! So I went. All in all, it was pretty good, the portions on some of the things were kind of small and I'm pretty sure they use a boca burger in the hawaiian burger, and boca burgers have a foul taste to them. The sauce and accompaniments definitely made up for it, though. The sushi rolls I would not get again, they had a fake ham in them, which doesn't even make sense to me and I didn't like. Their sweet and sour mock was really great as was the curry and the soup they give at the beginning. The drinks were fabulous but they didn't have their vegan ice cream that day, which was a major bummer. I will definitely be going there again when I'm in the vicinity, but stay clear of those sushi rolls!"}
{"text":"I ate here after eating at the one in San Diego a couple times.  I was a little disappointed.  The place was kind of depressing and slow moving, but I was there at 8:15 on a Tuesday.  Overall, the food wasn't that good.  I had one of the soups and it was just okay.  I would definitely be willing to give this place another shot, though.  I really liked some of the stuff at the SD location and I would like to try it here.  If you have never been to a Loving Hut, it is worth a visit to see the crazy TV channel and some of the inventive dishes.  I strongly recommend the things that look like breaded chicken legs but are really filled with mushrooms.  That thing is tasty."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try since my husband decided to be a vegetarian this year. The server asked if I wanted my beverages while I waited for my to go order. I ordered the hibiscus and Chai tea...for food I ordered the curry, fried rice and chow mein...the curry was ok. Couldn't eat the fried rice just wasn't good but my husband like the chow mein. It was a long wait more than 25 minutes we waited and I didn't get my drinks til AFTER we got our food. The Chai was good but it was in a tiny cup and less than half full. The hibiscus was blah. Don't think we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I won't say food is something to die for but the ladies were very polite. I tried the Thai cury and it was OK ok types.  The dessert was not good.  A very average restaurant."}
{"text":"How does a little Vegan place exist in the West Valley and I have never heard of it? How does this happen?  Well, last night I had my Loving Hut cherry popped.  I know vegetarians can understand how exciting it is to go to a restaurant and be able to order anything off the menu. You forget that feeling and it's so nice to have it back at times. Thank you, places like Loving Hut.    Most of the menu is Asian-esque, but there is a random spaghetti on the menu which I was drawn to. The homemade sauce included onions, green peppers, little bits of tofu and other tastiness. The sauce was awesome.  With every meal, you get a simple soup (my dining partner and I were unaware of this until it was brought to us) which warms your throat a little.  We also ordered the spring rolls which were a solid choice.  My friend ordered the lo mein and raved about her meal. Loving Hut is a great little place to get your veg on.  I'm sure I'll be a regular."}
{"text":"Great vegan food that has a lot of taste. Very clean place with welcoming atmosphere! One of my favorites."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I like what this place stands for and that they offer a full vegan menu. The people are really nice too. I just wished they offered vegan options that don't have fake meat or tofu."}
{"text":"I had the spicy veggie wrap with green tea.  The wrap had good flavor and the tea was light and delicious.   I also bought some vegetarian bacon to try.  I think the wrap could have used some kind of veggie cheese as it was a little vinegar-like for my taste buds, but I did like it.  There was a mix of great vegetables and a slight spice came through but also a sweet twang was in it that I didn't like.  Anyway, the ingredients are high quality and I have been here many times for delicious healthy food.  Next time I'll go back to my usual fried items and curries.  This place is great!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't to bad, didn't care for the food as much as I do other vegan restaurants. I got a small bowl of chili, and it was small o right. The fries are really good though, but other than that, wasn't my favorite."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great atmosphere. Will definitely come back again! They also have vegan merchandise"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here about 5 times now.  I am not a strict vegetarian, but I am very \"veggie-inclined.\"  :)  My husband is a full-blown meat-eater.  And... we both love this place.  I agree that their choice of television entertainment is a little weird, and it was a little distracting on our first visit.  But the volume is almost inaudible and it's really easy to tune out.  We have tried multiple dishes there: spring rolls, sushi appetizer, an egg-roll/bbq vermicelli, lemongrass chicken, hawaiian burger, steak sandwich, eggplant tofu, and pho.  My favs so far have been the spring rolls, vermicelli, steak sandwich (this is amazingly realistic and very very tasty), and eggplant.  I am a pretty big eater, and I've never left this place hungry (I suggest an appetizer though).  My husband always gets some fancy brightly-colored drink... and like a previous reviewer mentioned, since there are no descriptions on the drink menu you are always taking a gamble with that.  I stick to iced tea and am always satisfied with it.    I've never had to wait long for my food, and it has always been fresh and hot.  We do usually go for dinner though, and at that time there are generally only 2-3 other groups of people there.  I hope for their sake the business is better for lunch.  One complaint I've had so far was that they have been closed on Sunday (eliminating the Sunday lunch crowd) but they are shifting their hours soon and will be open 7 days a week.  Overall I highly recommend this place to anyone with an open mind.  I know we'll keep going back!"}
{"text":"We got take out the other day and it was delicious. We love the variety they offer and that they asked us if we wanted disposable utensils or not (instead of just assuming we did). Also it's exclusively vegan food which is hard to find."}
{"text":"One of the fun things about Loving Huts is they are all different. Each has its own menu, and even items that are the same on the menu may be prepared differently. The Glendale franchise is one of the more interesting versions of the vegan franchise in the valley. It seems to have more pro-vegan signage than the others, and I think has modified the menu more than others. Like all Loving Huts, the menu is predominantly Asian food, but the burgers are also a big draw for plant-based eaters. Non-veg eaters may be put-off by the pro-vegan lifestyle advocacy messages throughout the restaurant (menu, walls, TVs, etc.), but the food is so good that hopefully it affirms diners' choices to go veg for at least one meal!  The Glendale location is a counter-serve restaurant, which means I usually try to review the menu online and make a decision before going in. I think it has the largest variety of menu items of the franchises in the valley, but there are some items that Indian School restaurant offers that Glendale doesn't, such as the won ton soup (and free lentil soup with lunch). But the Glendale location has a wider variety of pastries, and has some items not at Indian School such as a Chipotle mock fried chicken sandwich, BBQ rolls and golden nuggets. I haven't been to the Litchfield Park location yet to know what they offer.  My normal go-to in Glendale is the chow mein. A server once told me the noodles are hand made locally - and you can tell. They're fantastic. The light brown sauce is also great. I've pretty much been stuck on it for years. It's basic, but delicious.   On my most recent visit, I wanted to try something different. I started with the Oink in a Blanket (vegan hot dogs in croissants with vegan cheese and bacon), which isn't available at the Tempe or Indian School locations. The Glendale location makes great croissants, so I thought these might be good. The croissant around the dogs was nice - light but chewy. The hot dogs were sliced up a bit thin. There was nothing wrong with them, but they weren't stand-outs. They'd be great for kids.  My favorite item on the Indian School menu is the Pad Thai, so I thought I'd try Glendale's version. It was much more of a traditional sweet/spicy oil-based Pad Thai - whereas Indian School's version has more of a peanut sauce. It was heavy on the noodles, light on the tofu, but the flavor was good. It was spicy, but not what I would consider \"hot.\" It included thin slices of carrots and red pepper, and a side of crushed peanuts and lime. There was plenty left over, and when I ate the leftovers today it was even better (the spices had settled in). However, I'll probably go back to the chow mein next time I visit.  My husband regularly gets the banh mi - beefless version - and a side of fries. He loves it, and gets it almost every visit. The fries are also exceptional - crisp and firm!  We've also had the pain au chocolat in the past and enjoyed it greatly!  I've read complaints about wait times at this restaurant, but never had any issues myself. I'm only out here a couple of times a year though, so I may not be a good judge of service. The counter people are always very friendly, and the place is clean and bright."}
{"text":"I am not a vegan and I do particularly enjoy the Surpreme Leader on television as it is strangely eerie to 1984; however., the food is amazing. The Hawaiian burger is delicious and the Carrot Cake is stellar. The wife loves the soup. Service can be alittle slow but take a good friend and just chill. Also, try all the flavors of ice tea."}
{"text":"If you're vegetarian or vegan because you like eating vegetables, unfortunately this is not the place for you. This place offers \"mock meat\" with very few veggies. Some things, like the Hawaiian burger, are good. But I don't feel very good after a meal without fresh veggies or fruit.  I do enjoy the drinks, though (Pink Lady has rose petals on top!), and I also like watching the other diners laughing at the cult-TV channel."}
{"text":"Delicious, decently priced vegan food. Now that they've taken down the Supreme Master TV broadcast the joint is even classier."}
{"text":"This is a great little gem, tucked away on a corner in North Phoenix. None of us in our group had ever been here before, and were greeted by a very friendly hostess and a clean, modern environment. Quick counter device with a nice sit down area made this a great choice for us.   I ordered the spring rolls and a Hawaiian hibiscus iced tea. The spring rolls were light and crispy, with fresh and flavorful vegetables. Their house made sweet and sour sauce was incredible. Sort of like an applesauce texture and great flavor.   The Hawaiian hibiscus tea was light and very refreshing, served in an old fashioned milkshake glass. My buddy got the Pho, and ate every last drop. He typically likes his Pho a little spicer, and noticed they have a spicy version he'll be trying next time.   If anyone is looking for delicious and healthy alternative for lunch, the Loving Hut is worth a try! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Being vegetarian I have been to Loving Hut many times.  The food and the atmosphere are great.  Service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I am the total opposite of a vegan/vegetarian, but, OMG! The food here is delicious. I had the golden nuggets and the Spicy Cha-Cha and both were yummy! I will most definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"One of the best vegan restaurant  in town.  The food is flavorful and portions are big. My husband and I have our dinner  here regularly once/week  & we absolutely love this place The food is tasty, simple/clean environment, & friendly employees."}
{"text":"This is my second Loving Hut location visit, the first was in Phoenix. I was visiting some friends nearby and stopped here for lunch. The line was a bit long, waited about 10 minutes, and then I ordered spring rolls and spicy guru fried rice with a side of 2 cha cha shrimp ($1/a price! Pricey.) The woman at the counter let me know it would be a wait for my food, 15-25 minutes, which I appreciated. I got my number and sat at a table.   My appetizer came out within 5 minutes and the main dish after about 15, so the estimate was on the shorter side. I liked the rolls, simple and refreshing with veggies and tofu, love that rice paper. The dipping sauce was good but I could've used more. The spicy rice was yummy, not very spicy so I added Sriracha sauce to kick it up. The shrimp was delicious, love the fried taste and the texture it added.   Overall, a great choice for lunch/dinner with a variety of vegan options to please all."}
{"text":"The service is amazing. The soups are made with heart and soul! Especially the pho, which is always hot and very fresh. The place is very clean and the staff incredibly friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This is the best Loving Hut in town. The Golden Beauty is money and I'm not even vegan."}
{"text":"What a great Vegetarian restaurant.  Food is fantastic, clean and neat atmosphere.  Servers are polite.  Menu has a huge selection.  I recommend this too all Vegetarians, and if you aren't, try it any way because you will love the food!"}
{"text":"Worst place to go! I could have been a great customer, this is right by my kids daycare and a healthy option but never again! We got here at 5 it's 6:15 and still no food!!!! So much for an after school option. Lost my business forever."}
{"text":"Used to be good, maybe even great! But now, it is just MEH!  RIGHTS:  - Say they are vegan and they are  - Ordering is simple, fast and easy  - Complimentary soup is hot on a cold day  WRONGS:  - Our order was messed up, we got the wrong food served.  - Our pate chaud was cold, not hot as it should have been, then they just heated the same half eaten one and served it again  - We should have been comped, but no, we were given an itsy-bitsy (1.5 inch across) banana nut muffin. Yeah it was complimentary. Did you think I would pay for that!  - The TV and the program on it is annoying"}
{"text":"Loving Hut is sooo good. I've been visiting incarnations of this store for 15 years (back when it was Suma Ching Hai), and they've only gotten better.  This is the place to go if you miss the regular dining experience and don't want to be a pain everywhere you go, then discover you can only have salad and french fries.   Loving Hut has everything. We have always been partial to their Asian dishes (a carryover preference from the old days, perhaps), so I can mostly only speak for that.   Keeping that in mind, I highly recommend:  Spring Rolls (the ones with peanut sauce) Noble Broccoli (great sauce) Sweet and Sour Pork (awesome fake meat thingies) The crispy chicken things (can't remember the name, lol... something about New York?), although I caution you to ask for it without the chili flakes, if you can't handle spice.  The lentil soup (huge) Banana cake Flan Pink Lady drink (It has soy milk, cranberry juice, and rose water in it. It's awesome!)  We haven't tried much else because these are so good, we haven't felt a need, really. We crave these dishes, and that's why we keep coming back. But I've heard the rest of it is great, too.  FYI: for three entrees, the spring roll appetizers, and maybe one dessert, we usually spend about $30 - $35."}
{"text":"Loving Hut is a multi-state chain restaurant that specializes in vegan food - and pretty damned good vegan food at that. However, let it be known that I'm no vegan and have absolutely no intention of converting to veganism. I hold no vegan powers and don't really like wearing beanies out of season, but that's beside the point. The fact is, my girlfriend and I came here with minimal expectations and were actually surprised in the end.  You order at the counter and should be prepared to wait. We were quoted 15-35 minutes and it ended up being closer to 15. We ordered their golden rolls, which are their take on eggrolls. Honestly, they were on par with what we'd order at any respectable restaurant that serves them.  For drinks, I was really hoping to try the Thai iced tea I saw posted on Yelp, but was told it was not available. They recommended an iced Mumbai chai for myself, while my girlfriend ordered the pink lady, which ended up looking more like a \"lavender girl\" for reasons unknown. Both were decent, even if I did have to go back to the counter and request that they add the cinnamon powder that they left off.  For main dishes, I played it safe, probably too safe, by ordering their blissful fried rice, sans the tofu. My girlfriend chose the chow mein with no modifications. What kind of surprised me was the BBQ beefless \"protein,\" which looks and actually tastes very similar to actual meat. No, not mind-blowingly juicy meat, but similar to an average-tasting beef you'd get at a Chinese restaurant. How they pull this off remains a mystery, but it seems to work.  For dessert, we ordered the pain au chocolat, which are two pastries filled with dark chocolate and cookie butter. Additionally, we tried the pandan cake, which was something completely new. We were both a big fan of its unique flavor, as well as the addition of coconut.    Not everything was five-stars across the board, however. The service seemed to be a bit of a mess. The girl who I presumed to be the manager, told my girlfriend that there were a lot of new people there that didn't quite have the procedures down just yet. They not only forgot my cinnamon, but they also forgot our straws, so I had to track someone down since none of that stuff is available at the counter.  All the vegan propaganda littered about the restaurant is a bit weird and kind of overkill. Additionally, the preference for paying cash and slapping on a service fee for debit/credit payment seems odd for a restaurant that's a 38-state operated chain. Although it's a five-dollar minimum, so I doubt anyone will actually run into that problem.  Overall, I see this as a place that we'd definitely return to. Vegan or no vegan, the food is good and that's ultimately all that matters."}
{"text":"The food was VERY good! I had the Spicy shrimp salad-type bowl and it was amazing! I would definitely eat here again any time I'm passing through!"}
{"text":"This restaurant never disappoints. Even my meat-eating fiancé loves it. It's really nice having vegan food close-by. I wish they were open on Sunday's but I get it, they need their time off too. I would love to see this location do a full renovation, the restaurant is cute but they could definitely upgrade to their full potential! I will always return to Loving Hut!"}
{"text":"Given the limited options of vegetarian fare in Phoenix, this place is worth checking out. Nestled in the endless amounts of shopping strip malls, Loving Hut sticks out like a sore thumb with their spotless tables and fluorescent lighting.  ++ - menu has a good variety of Asian and \"western\" food, plus a whiteboard filled with new items available for selection - order and pay at front, sit and wait for your food, avoid servers breathing down your neck - the cute little Asian women who are so sweet I could take them home and have them cook for me all the time - clean clean clean!  - - - the \"beef\" in the vermicelli was overly chewy and too salty - wonton soup was pretty oily, could see droplets on the top of my soup - NO SRIRACHA?! (Asian hot sauce popularly known as Rooster sauce) - both TVs had breaking news about how we're destroying the planet via global warming and images of swine flu outbreak....not very appetizing...  I'd probably come again to try other things on their menu, but I'd prefer an ease up on the propaganda..."}
{"text":"Tried this place out a couple weeks ago with my Fiancee. She is Vegan, I am not, but I'm very open to meat alternatives. We both really enjoyed our food. We started with the spring rolls, which had an excellent dipping sauce. I had the Jasmine Ice Tea that had a great flavor for an unsweetened Ice tea. My fiancee ordered the Sweet and Sour \"Chicken\" and really liked it, which is good as sometimes she does not like the fake meat. I ordered the Spicy Cha Cha, which is breaded soy shrimp. The breading was well seasoned, crispy and not greasy. I used the spring roll dipping sauce for the shrimp and would recommend getting a dipping sauce with this dish. All in all it was great experience. My fiancee's only suggestion is the have more veggie dishes not based on fake meats."}
{"text":"Loving Hut is adorable! The name in and of itself just screams it.  When you enter, you look at a menu, decide what you want, and go up to the cashier and order. They encourage you to pay with cash to keep food costs low. They have a variety of food items, all of which of course are vegan. Non-vegans, I encourage you to try this place, because they do not skimp out on flavor! I tried the Vietnamese sandwich and it really tasted like barbeque! They also have very yummy and interesting drinks. When we sat down they gave us complimentary soup before our ordered entrees!  I was pleasantly surprised by Loving Hut and plan on visiting again!"}
{"text":"Let me start this review by getting a small rant out of the way, stick with me here. I understand people who are not vegan come here, some enjoy it, some don't. What I don't get is people spending half their review talking about how much they love meat, dairy, dead things that used to have a mother, etc :-). It makes you look like more of a jackass because you are lauding it at a restaurant that is explaining why to go Vegan all over the walls and TV!! Yes, I am a Vegan, but don't tell me I don't \"understand\", I was an omnivore for 28 years who used to eat lots of all kinds of meat, cheese, dairy and NEVER ever considered going Vegan - that argument doesn't fly with me. If you are interested there is a wealth of information out there so get educated. It's a process for most(like me) but a rewarding one and you might just surprise yourself. I am always willing to talk to anyone about my \"experience\" as what most of society would call me \" a non traditional vegan\".  Anyone still reading? Ok good, now onto Loving Hut. This review is really more of a 3-3.5 review but since it's a new vegan place in Phoenix metro it gets a 4 in my book. I think they could do much better in a better location, CenPho anyone? That being said, I work close by and this section of N Phx seems like anti-vegan land. So the fact that I have a 100% vegan place to go for lunch in this area is a bonus for me, although I am constantly going there alone since none of my coworkers would ever set foot in such a place(see \"jackass\" comment above).  Most of the food here is decent, the eggplant and tofu is a good dish with a side of brown rice. The BBQ sandwich is also very good. I enjoy most of their apps as well, I had the Hawaiian burger once and wasn't that impressed - I make a better veggie burger at home(probably healthier too). Don't mistake this for health food, but its better then your standard meal at the local Chili's. Let's face it, people don't go out to be as healthy as possible, everything in moderation though(well not EVERYTHING).  The staff is always very friendly and the prices seem reasonable on most of the dishes. I would rather create a Vegan meal at home then drive here for dinner, but for lunch when I need it, it works and I enjoy it. I hope they stay around and in business, I wouldn't be heartbroken though if they moved to an area where a vegan establishment might do better.  PS. They changed the names on the menu since they opened, I am not sure what prompted it but its a good change. I don't like any vegan places that includes the animal they are trying to imitate. Vegan food can stand on its own, soy, wheat, etc protein can stand on its own. It has its own flavor, texturee and benefits it doesnt need(nor should be) compared to something else. I get that calling something soy \"chicken\" helps with getting people to transition to the diet but call it what it is, soy meat, wheat meat, nut milk, nut meat etc. Animal by products don't have a monopoly on the word \"meat\" or \"milk\" or \"cheese'. Kudos for the menu changes."}
{"text":"I can't believe a place this delicious actually exists. Everything I ate and drank here resulted in pure euphoria. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! Great prices!  Good quality!  If you're looking for a place that is healthy and delicious, this is it! They also offer gluten free options.  Even if you're not a vegetarian, you should give them a try! And they grow their own herbs right here!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is the best vegan restaurant in Phoenix without doubt. The food here is amazing, even if you are a meat eater you will not miss meat.   As a vegan I find it hard to find well made vegan food and this place makes everything well worth the trip. From the  starters all the way to desert you will not be disappointed.   The serving staff are very helpful and remember you every time you come back in.   My favorites are the burgers, the curries and the hot Mumbai chai.   Give it a try you will not leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"for a long time, i was the only vegetarian in my circle of friends / high school class, and so when one of my mates became a vegetarian after a year of tentative debating with herself, that prompted whatever electric current in my brain that transliterates to something along the lines of, 'now i can look for vegan/vegetarian restaurants and not be worried about eating alone'! i love loving hut. the two of us had been very afraid that when we came here we were going to experience something along the lines of tina fey's romantic encounter in baby mama, where they confusingly [try to] eat a yeast ball. it was not so. their menu items are confusingly meatlike in texture, although i have no idea how close the flavours are to meat.   here are individual dish reviews: arigato sushi: these sushi rolls are good, although there is better vegetable sushi to be found elsewhere. they taste strongly of the pickles, mostly. spring rolls: i enjoy the spring rolls a lot, most likely due to the use of jicama. the leek is too strong for me (which is not very bizarre, for someone who hates onions). pâté chaud: although i have never had meat pâté, i somehow doubt this competes very well with it. it was mostly puff pastry and very little filling. golden nuggets: these are very perfect for anyone craving something small and crispy with a token flavour. it would not constitute a meal, which is why they are listed in the appetizer section- these are minuscule. hawaiian burger: i love pineapple + it is so hard to go wrong with a burger, in my opinion, so this is a pretty easy success. sometimes the paddies restaurants offer are disgusting (boca, yuck), but this one seems to be made in house. their french fries are thankfully crisp and not dried out or soggy. bbq baguette: a bit on the minimalistic side, the flavours here are all good and well, and the bbq soy protein tastes good but sometimes has questionably unsettling texture when eaten alone (e.g. if it falls out of your baguette). the sandwich filling to baguette ratio is maybe 1:3- not very meaty. bbq vermicelli: i am not a peanut fan (and this is topped with peanuts), but those are negligible and can be pushed aside. i would definitely recommend this, as this is the first item that my partner ordered when we ate here that long, long time ago. the only difficulty we had was using the chopsticks to handle everything at once. the vermicelli was good when we ate it and not over/undercooked. we have ordered this many times. spicy cha cha: this is essentially the vegan version of fried shrimp. this is the first thing i ate when i came here on account of the first two things i attempted to order being out of stock. it is really impressive that they even have those strange red stripes on their pseudo shrimp, which has a bit of a spongey consistency (that is visible if examined). the flavour is well composed and cohesive throughout. when it comes to spice, if you are a gringo, you probably do not want this, although i think for most people it is very mild. carrot cake: this cake is wonderful and has a very nice combination of sweet flavours; it is especially good with a coffee drink on the side, or soy milk. banana cake: this cake is a little more dry than their carrot cake, but otherwise since i am not as fond of banana flavoured things that are not bananas, my opinion of this dish is pretty heavily biased. banana fritters: if you like banana fritters, there is no reason not to get these. these are good. they are not spectacular but are very far from terrible. this has real bananas in it obviously so it is not influenced by that bias. pink lady: my partner orders this every single time we come here. she loves it to an amount i could never quantify. sometimes toward the bottom of the glass it begins to taste mostly like flowers, which is cool if you are THAT kind of vegan. sunny forest: it is a perfect combination of orange and mint. sometimes i wish they would put a little more sparkling water in it. this is my drink of choice, and i will order it every time i come here.  orange joy: because i love orange juice, i automatically think that this is good. the cranberry juice adds a nice bit of tartness in combination. happy go lucky: hey, if you like lemon and lime together with a subtle hint of rose, this is probably for you! i think it is kind of boring compared to their other drinks, which are a little stronger, with more body. ice mumbai spirit: i have only had this once; this is a good iced chai. if i remember correctly, it was slightly less sweet than the chai you get from most coffee shops, but all of the spice flavour is there.  enjoy! that is all that i can remember off of the top of my head."}
{"text":"Great vegan food with so many options!! The iced chai was delicious as were the \"chicken\" nuggets!"}
{"text":"Well obviously vegan.... so good that you wouldn't realize it was vegan.   I think the biggest thing you need to know about loving hut is that your food order will take a long time to come out. It is well worth the wait because everything is super fresh but you will wait.  I tired their mint limeaide. Very refreshing. I really enjoy the pandan cake. Tastes like a pistachio butter cake.   They have a large freezer full of frozen vegan protein alternatives.   They are a cash preferred store and will charge .25 for under $5.   You can get delivery through door dash."}
{"text":"If you're vegan and even if you aren't (yet), the food here will blow you away. The BBQ \"beef\" noodle dish was fantastic. I don't know how they get TVP chunks to taste like beef but it does. Very satisfying meal. I can't wait to go again, even though I live in the central plateau."}
{"text":"This place has great tasting food considering its 100% Vegan. The staff was very welcoming, friendly, and attentive. I had the chili burger with fries, and even though I could definitely taste the difference between what I was eating, and a regular chili burger, it was still very enjoyable and satisfying. I will definitely be returning to this location."}
{"text":"The food is not only healthy but extremely flavorful. I ordered the spicy pad Thai and the spring rolls. Both were amazing. I ordered my pad Thai less spicy and it was perfect.  I also ordered the chrysanthemum tea, sent it back for the green tea that tasted much better.  I finished off with the chocolate cake. A little dry but very flavorful.      The only thing I would change is the order set up"}
{"text":"Always impressed with their food! So delicious and healthy! Service is always kind and thorough. Place is always clean! A must!"}
{"text":"Really good food and an incredible menu. I really enjoyed the noble broccoli with brown rice.  The curry Devine was really good and a really good size. I asked for it spicy and they were able to accommodate me.  My wife is vegan so that is why I originally came here. Now I request to go here. My only problem was I waited 50 minutes on a Takeout order that I phoned ahead and was told 25 minutes. But it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Coming here is the highlight of my day, girlfriend turned me vegan and i am very picky on what i eat. All i use to have was American styled food (burgers and hotdogs), but i had the occasional Chinese food. I gave this place a try and am glad i did. Doesn't taste like what i use to eat, it is ten times better. The atmosphere is wonderful, nice and clean. The workers are very nice and my girlfriend applied to work there, so we met the owner and she is a really nice woman. They have TVs playing with vegan recipes sometimes and i love getting new ideas to try at home. All in all a great place to try vegan or not."}
{"text":"I love to eat healthy. (even though i do eat meat) i still thought this place was pretty amazing my boyfriend (another meat eater) and i have decided to make it our regular place :)"}
{"text":"I love healthy food. But the vegan restaurants usually have so much attitude or arrogant  \"regulars\". This place didn't have that. The food was very fresh. It was little expensive for what it was, but I don't mind. Overall I liked it.    If you don't like vegan food don't eat here. It really is just veggies and tofu. Some vegan places have meat for your friend that doesn't like veggies but this place only had tofu."}
{"text":"There's something for everyone at Loving Hut!  From Burgers, Hotdogs and Fries to Stir Fry, Chinese, and a wide variety of rice/noodle dishes. Everything I've tried is incredible, flavorful, healthy, and cruelty-free! The.benefits are endless and to have a local hot spot like 'Loving Hut' in the area it is in, is a blessing!  Recommended items:  Hawaiian Burger Spaghetti Wontons Pho Sweet & Sour Divine And any of their stir fry rice dishes!"}
{"text":"Omg, Loving Hut, you are so delicious!! You need to be next to my house, feeding me all the things on your menu all the time!! Yes, I would be the size of a house! No, I do not care!  Oh, hey there, Yelp reader....  Everything is vegan. You must know this up front. That means: NO meat, NO dairy, NO animal products. You must not be like my Dad and repeatedly say, 'This isn't a burger! There's no MEAT in it!' No, Dad, you knew this going in. Stop it, you're embarrassing me.  Don't be that guy.  That said: the menu is huge. American food (burgers, spaghetti (wait, that might be considered Italian), chicken nuggets); Chinese food (chow mein, sweet and sour tofu, miso soup); Indian food (curry and whatnot). Lots of stuff. I can't remember it all! Go look at their menu online; they have PICTURES!  I've been to the Loving Hut in San Francisco, so I know this stuff is good. This time I got the curry fried rice (Guru Rice I think it was called?). Spicy and delicious, just like I like it! Sprinkled with small chunks of tofu. I would have preferred larger chunks, but that's just me.  My Dad got brown rice because he is a big baby. He liked it.  My boyfriend got the sweet and sour tofu, and he LOVED it. He said it was the perfect combination of sweet and sour, but it leaned more sweet (which he prefers).  My Mom was sadly disappointed by her Buddy Burger-- she said it was too chewy. She did, however, love the 'Golden Nuggets' (aka 'chicken' nuggets) w/ sweet ketchup, and she loved her french fries. I tried the french fries-- personally, I recommend you add some more salt, but again, that's just me.  The prices are reasonable-- $5.50 for Mom's burger and $7.50 for my fried rice dish. The portions are big, in my opinion, so I found the prices fair. I even have leftovers!  Grab a menu when you come in, choose what you'd like, go to the front counter and order what you want by number (each meal is numbered). If you can't decide, like me, go with something that has a heart-shape next to it-- that means it's a House Favorite and you practically can't go wrong!  Loving Hut prefers you pay in cash (they have an explanation for it, read it if you want), but they absolutely accept credit and debit cards.  This location is on the corner of 35th Ave. and Union Hills, at the very end of the row closest to 35th Ave.  I'm a vegetarian, wannabe vegan, and my Mom is a vegetarian as well. However, my Dad and his prejudices aside, this IS a place you can take your non-veggie friends and family to as well. The layout is clean and it's not like it shoves vegetarianism down your throat (that might not be the best analogy...). You know what I mean. Don't be afraid to bring your non-veggie friends to this place, that's all I'm saying. :)"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Loving Hut and Loving Café chains. This is the largest one I've ever been in! Staff was super friendly, and as usual, the only troubling issue is choosing a menu item or two. I'm a Loving Hut Super Fan."}
{"text":"We have been vegan now for about 9 months.  We don't eat out as much as we use to, since we have found it more convenient to make vegan meals at home.  However, as we continue our journey, we are finding more places to go.  5 years ago, if you'd have told me I would be eating at a vegan restaurant called \"The Loving Hut\"; I would have told you that you're crazy.  Today, if you told me I couldn't go to the The Loving Hut, I'd go crazy!  We started eating at The Loving Hut about 2 months ago.  I have tried a different meal each time we go (unusual for me, usually I find something I like and stick with it), and I have not been disappointed yet.  The restaurant is clean, light, and bright.  When you enter, there is a counter in front of you with menus.  While we normally figure out ahead of time what we are having (we have a take out menu at home); you can peruse the menu and make your choice.  You then walk up to the counter and place your order.  They will give you an number and bring your food out to you.  Special note, while it is a counter service restaurant, your meal may take time to prepare and it's worth the wait.  My understanding is that each Loving Hut is different.  This one is asian themed, although \"burgers\" are on the menu.  My favorite meal so far has been the Spicy Guru Fried Rice (#34) which is a fried rice with Indian curry.  The taste is wonderful, and the portion is huge.  Other meals that I have had and liked?  Noble Noodle Bowl, Golden Vermicelli (huge!), Golden Beauty, and the Blissful Fried Rice (also huge and very good).  The only meal that I was not crazy about was the Save the Planet Curry.  It was served as a soup and was very good, however it has chunks of tofu in it and they were rather rubbery.    All in all, we have enjoyed every visit so far, the place is spotless, the staff is friendly, and the food has been great!"}
{"text":"While on vacation we chose Loving Hut because of the great reviews.  It was a trek to get there and very unassuming as we drove up... WOW....So Good I was texting everyone I knew as we left.  We are not vegetarian YET...but as my husband said \"why would you eat animal protein when food can taste so good without it.\" We ate and ate without guilt....Oh, and sample the drinks.  It's like drinking nature...seriously!    We had planned to go out for BBQ tonite but we are going back to Loving Hut instead."}
{"text":"This was my first time going here with my husband. I have been plant based for a month, and it has been hard finding places to eat out. We came here, after reading the great reviews, expecting an average experience. It was anything but that. The people were amazing, the food excellent, they ambiance very pleasant, and the pricing good. I have finally found a place where I can go and eat anything without fear of derailing my current did lifestyle. Kudos to this place"}
{"text":"Loving the Loving Hut, is that redundant?  Who knew vegan could be so good?  I'm not a vegan or even a vegetarian, I just like food, and the dishes here could almost make me consider changing my meat eating ways.  I love the Mongolian Wonder,  Spicy Pad Thai, and the Golden  Delight, a lemongrass 'chikn'.  Then there is the broth they give you at the start of the meal, it's a light and flavorful broth with a few vegetables  and a  little tofu in it, so simple yet oh so tasty.  The atmosphere is so relaxing and you feel better having eaten a meal here. I can't wait to get back to the valley and try something else on their extensive menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant. The food is of the best quality and always made to order. I love the curry with veggies and the springrolls. A must try is the pinklady mocktail.......cranberryjuice and soymilk over ice .... yummy! The staff is always super friendly and the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!!! I had the seaweed ocean, my mom had the sweet and sour divine, we both had water and chocolate cake. We will definitely come again. The seaweed ocean was huge, tasted like tuna, soft, flaky, tender, scrumptious! I ordered it with a side of white rice. I don't know how they cook the rice, but it tasted great, not like boring white rice at all! The sauce that came with the seaweed ocean tasted good but was a little salty. The sweet and sour tasted exactly like sweet and sour chicken. Very tasty, not too sweet, not spicy, tender, delicious. The water had fresh oranges in it. The cake was fabulous! Moist, not too sweet, buttery creamy frosting. It could have had a little more chocolate though. Pretty restaurant. Fast service. Quiet relaxing spot. I wish they did breakfast!"}
{"text":"Wow. I mean... WOW. I'm a HUGE Meat lover... every main meal I eat MUST have meat or chicken in it. But this place really proved me wrong and I'm still amused.  My husband took me here for lunch and it was our first times here. He ordered the \"spicy noodle broth bowl\" and I ordered the \"BBQ + egg roll vermicelli\". It was absolutely delicious and healthy.   The protein part of the dish looks like meat (but its not), and tastes good. I can't even explain what it tastes like... but it really satisfies my need for meat. My dish was about $9 and I would definitely get it again.  We will be back to try other items!!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying, not all Loving Huts prepare their food the same. I ordered the spicy cha cha having had it numerous times before in Cali. When I got my order I was confused as to why there a bunch of chopped up bell peppers mixed in with the shrimp. Needless to say, it wasn't spicy because of the red pepper flake goodness I'm used to. It actually wasn't spicy at all. At least I know now to stick with the Cali establishments."}
{"text":"Happy to see that a vegan restaurant has finally come to my neighborhood. My sister and I were immediately greeted by a member of the courteous and helpful staff who offered us a complimentary mushroom soup. There are several things to choose from and finally decided to start with the spring rolls and each ordered the be-veg lunch(which included asparagus, tofu,and white rice), mumbai spirit to drink and carrot cake for dessert.  All were fresh and delicious and the menu prices are very reasonable. I will soon be returning to try more!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I will not be back nor will I recommend this restaurant to anyone.   Everything here *looks* really good, but didn't live up to it's presentation. Ordered the spring rolls to start, Pink Lady drink (mixture of pomegranate juice and soy milk) and the Chow Mein. Sadly, nothing tasted good.   My friends I went with were also disappointed with their food. None of us finished our dishes.   Oh well. Too bad!   Go to True Foods in the Biltmore area instead. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent, excellent. It's so great to have a restaurant that is 100% vegan so that you have no worries of making the wrong choice.  The good thing is you could take anyone there and they'd be happy.  They would have no idea it's vegan.  In addition, depending on the location you have many choices to choose from ranging from Asian inspiration to burgers and fries.  I had a Pink Lady drink which was very tasty.  For our main course we each chose the Hawaiian burger with fries.  Unknowingly we also receive soup as an appetizer.  Both items we FANTASTIC. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"If the opening of a new vegetarian restaurant is cause for me to celebrate, just imagine how happy I was after I tasted the food!  Jeremy and I checked Loving Hut on Friday for dinner.  It's a really cute place, spotlessly clean and the staff is very sweet and helpful with suggestions.  I had the steak sandwich (one of their chef's choice dishes) and it was great!  The steak itself was delicious, served on crusty french bread with crisp marinated veggies.  I had a beautiful orange-cranberry juice drink called the Orange Joy as well.  Mmmmm!  I can't wait to go back again this week and try something new.  Everything looks great and I'm so pleased to have a veggie place on the north side of town."}
{"text":"Alrighty, a friend highly recommended this little place so I followed.   Its quaint, clean, and the employees (I was greeted by a caucasian female with lighter hair) are very very kind. But this review isnt really about them, because they made the experienced, well, good.  I ordered the \"beef\" noodle rolls to go. They come with a side of dipping sauce. And contained rice noodles, spinach, and some protein made to imitate beef, they were wrapped in a rice wrap (the name escapes me). Those were the okay parts. But not much flavor really. And it was really just one big gooy sticky mess. The rolls should be fried to add a different texture, and to make the experience less \"taffy\" like. However, the yellow daikon (fermented) and carrots, were so over powering, thats all I could taste! And Im Korean! I live for this stuff!  It was off putting, and I felt very disatisfied after finishing the first roll that I didnt touch the second one.   Ill eventually try the other items on the menu, but for now, Im staying away."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic and the staff are polite. I had the Hawaiian burger, and it was pretty bomb. It's great to get a delicious meal and have it be animal-product free and environmentally friendly here in the Valley."}
{"text":"I FRIKKIN LOVE THIS FRIKKIN PLACE!!   When you walk in, you're greeted by a hostess stand with no hostess but plenty of menus. Once you decide what you want you go up the the order counter. They don't have waitresses and all that good stuff. Who needs that when you serve amazing cruelty free food!??  I've had the spicy fried rice, Golden rolls, vermicelli bowl, pho, the red Soup with lemon grass and spices, and the Thai basil plus many more to come. Everything is IMPECCABLE! There is no flavor lacking. Everything is better here than I have ever eaten as a non-vegan.   I am vegan for the animals. But this place is vegan for the animals and the environment. They ooze with positive vibes which I love.   Prices are good. Food is good. Service is good. I love everything here. And everyone should go. You suck if you're not vegan But you should go here whether you're vegan or not."}
{"text":"Food is great, you don't miss the meat, and I'm making the planet happy.  I'm also not supporting Industrial Livestock Production which makes me happy."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall restaurant. Lots of variety in their menu. Need to be open to trying new things. Glad it's totally vegan though there is a lot of soy used and I wish they used non-GMO.   Their staff is nice and friendly, too."}
{"text":"I love this place. Spicy Cha Cha is awesome. I love the drinks--I've had iced lemongrass tea and iced hibiscus tea. Delicious. I can't wait 'til next time--hoping I'll save room to try a dessert.  Sparkling clean and friendly staff who aren't too intrusive with the chatting."}
{"text":"their smoothies are divine and any soup there is delicious!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE vegan restaurant. The staff is always extremely friendly and helpful both when I am dining in or placing a to go order. They're also always so kind when taking special requests on food which is a lot of times rare. The save the planet curry is unlike any other soup I've had and I could probably eat it every day. I've tried more than half the menu and all the desserts (here too much) and have yet to find something I don't like. Definitely recommend to all vegans and non vegans :)"}
{"text":"Is been a long time since we've been here,  and I don't know why!  The food here is amazing and the service prefect.   They had a few new menu items,  the mighty mint limeade is a must have."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant to date.  Good vegan food.  Fast service.  No pretense.  You just know you're going to walk away feeling good about your food choices and healthier for it.  Highly recommended to any and all.  You don't have to be vegan or vegetarian to enjoy this good food."}
{"text":"I was eager to try this place. My husband is a meat and potatoes kind of guy, but I convinced him to come along. I was still worried, though--I wanted him to like his food. The propaganda aspect worried me a little but it wasn't that bothersome. The TVs are at a very low volume.  I advised him to get the #44 Mongolian Wonder because of the Yelp reviews. I ordered the #55 Phoenix Leisure. Our two cups of water and broth soon came out. The broth appetizer was quite good.  The food soon followed. It smelled great and the proportions weren't bad at all; it looked exactly as depicted on the menu. Looking at other tables, the soup bowls are enormous, too. My husband was pleasantly surprised by his food. He said the texture was a little off of beef but it was good. He ate it all without any complaint, and I gave him most of my brown rice, too.  My dish was good, too. The rainbow salad wasn't anything spectacular but it WAS much better than the side salads you get at most other restaurants. It had a great crunch and the colors were pretty. The protein was excellent; sauce had excellent savory flavor. The vegetables were perfectly cooked--crispy, not mushy. The brown rice was perfectly steamed.  If this restaurant was closer to where I lived, I'd probably visit on a regular basis. There are a number of other things on the menu I'd love to try."}
{"text":"I'm giving loving hut four stars. I think this is a unique little joint! All vegeterian, vegan options. I went one day for lunch, got the Hawaiian vegeterian burger with a lemonade and the cabbage salad. Vegetarian options are becoming more popular now a days but it's still hard sometimes to find a place that makes the food the way you like it. Loving but does great and the options are endless! Cute hippie vibes abt this place too which I adored!!"}
{"text":"Love Loving Hut! Employees are always so helpful and very pleasant! Food always top notch. The lemongrass tea is soooo delicious!"}
{"text":"I love their curry soup and chai tea..it's my favorite!! This place is clean and the employees  great. I'm not vegetarian or vegan, but I love this place."}
{"text":"The ambiance is warm and welcoming. The food is fragrant and delicious. Even our 6 year old enjoyed himself. Very satisfying!"}
{"text":"Sorry about the pic with meal almost gone. They have a lot of options and choices. Steady flow of satisfied customers. If you have never tried it, treat yourself and a friend. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tried it couple weeks ago and even went back soon after!  Impressed with the variety of vegan entrees the menu offers (chili dogs!) the food is great and the curry is a stand out.  The staff was very helpful on both occasions despite a steady group of diners while we were there.  My one complaint is regarding the two TV's in the dining area. On each occasion they were showing an international QVC like channel. Culture is an amazing thing yet couldn't one tv have a more familiar show?"}
{"text":"Had lunch for the first time here today. We are not vegan but we really enjoyed the food here. Portion was larger than we expected. We are not used to eating tofu and soy protein but enjoyed the flavors and texture of the meal. The presentation was pretty and very appetizing. Food looks exactly like the picture on the menu. Don't forget to try the fresh juices as well. Yum! Service was friendly and quick. I won't even have to trick my husband in to coming back."}
{"text":"Took my 3 daughters in today - -only to see a PETA video playing. Not exactly appetizing. When i kindly asked if he could change the channel, he snapped \"NO\".  .... what?! are you kidding me??? who wants to eat lunch while someone is torturing chickens?! I will NEVER patron it again. Just awful!"}
{"text":"There are not a lot of places that are vegan around here... I  get the \"non-chicken\" chicken wings for the boy. I feel good about him not eating nuggets at Mc something. Yuck! GMO gag! Anyways, I like the \"golden bbq vermicelli\". We tried the Pho was so so."}
{"text":"Short story: This place is great.  Loved the food.  Liked the prices. Loved the deserts.  You'd probably only know that you're in a vegan restaurant because they tell you (I haven't been a vegan all my life - it's something I do but it's not a religion).  So, vegan or not, this place is the bomb.  And for those who aren't vegan, you can eat here and be satisfied when you leave.  Or, it's a great place to bring a group that is part vegan and part non-vegan.  Everybody wins.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here with my brother on a recent trip to Phoenix.  This is a medium sized restaurant.  You order at the counter and your food/drinks are brought to you by servers.    We arrived to find quite a long line of patrons.  The staff was definitely on it but getting our order placed and then served took longer than I would have expected.  We did get a free order of spring rolls while we waited since the staff knew that it would be awhile till we got our food.    I ordered the pho, which the attendant at the counter said was her mother's recipe.  The chunks of veggies were pretty large, like a whole stalk of bok choy, but I felt that it was a relatively small serving with a scant amount of veggies and tofu.  I am used to being served a plate of fresh basil and sprouts with pho, but there were none of the traditional condiments served as extra.  It was good, but some sriracha sauce and some basil and sprouts would have made this dish much better.    My brother had the Loving Hut Burger. He said it was OK but could have been more flavorful.   The service was wonderful, the whole restaurant is very clean and bright and I liked the fact that it is healthy food, but I would have enjoyed more flavor from the vegan options that we chose.  I would come back to try different menu selections to see if something catches my fancy."}
{"text":"Love this place, never have been disappointed with anything I have ordered! The only issue I have is the location, pretty scummy outside but inside is great!"}
{"text":"why would you charge for soy sauce in an asian resturant????  i've been to Loving Hut a few times in Milpitas, CA, and it was a fantastic experience. i didn't realize the menus were different at each location, but there seemed to be enough interesting things here that we would be pretty happy. i was a little disappointed, though.  i came in with a party of 5, we bought a ton of food, and they were incredibly careful to make sure to charge us for every tiny thing we ordered. the soy sauce was just stupid, though... it's expensive, and you get the tiniest portion ever. since two of our dishes were incredibly bland, i felt like we were being punished for it with the upcharges when we needed to ask for soy sauce after our food had arrived.  it was nice not to get glutened, though, so they seemed to do well enough at avoiding cross contamination.  the glutenfree spring rolls needed a better sauce. i'm pretty sure we only got a tablespoon of gf soy sauce, and the Milpitas location serves a generous amount of a delicious peanut sauce. maybe the gluten version gives you better sauce, but if that's true, that's even more disappointing.  at the very least, I have to thank this place for reminding me how important it is to remember to keep my backpack supply of gf soy sauce well-stocked."}
{"text":"I am not impressed. The food is Uber bland and expensive for the portion sizes. I ordered the Spicy Pad Thai with crispy tofu. I was specific about it being crispy and it was super soggy. To top it off, I paid something like $10 bucks. I am not a fan"}
{"text":"We came in for lunch and restaurant was pretty full and designed have others have said, very judgmental-vegan version.   Service: food took about 20 minutes to arrive which wasn't told to us and that's a bit longer than most counter order restaurants but would be well worth it if the food is delicious.   Cost: 12.50 for fried rice with beefless bbq is high BUT the amount is huge, enough for two meals so that price is good.   Food: the fried rice with beefless bbq doesn't have much of the 'beef' and maybe that's ok as it had zero taste and that sponginess a lot of faux meat has. My partner ordered a chick less plate and that faux meat was good! Crispy and full of flavor. The carrot cake was odd, the frosting tasted like butter but just butter not made with butter.   We will most likely return and try other dishes as it is on the west side. We really enjoy Green and have to say their food and prices are better."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Loving Hut, but I like the Phoenix one on Indian School better than the one in Glendale. Everything is pretty delicious, but I've found that the dishes that you can also order at the Phoenix Loving Hut taste better and have bigger portions at that location than at this one. Also, it's a bit misleading because the restaurant is set up in such a way that you think you can just sit down and they'll come take your order, but you actually have to go up to the counter and make it. The Phoenix Loving Hut, on the other hand, offers full table service. Their only advantage over the other location is that they actually have the flan advertised on their menu, which is pretty good. Overall, I'd recommend it, but if you have the opportunity, try the Phoenix location instead."}
{"text":"Non-vegans will love this place! The meat substitutes taste just like meat, and the seasonings are amazing! Mostly Asian-style entrees, but also great burgers and sandwiches."}
{"text":"It's fantastic to find a healthy vegan restaurant with clean facilities and delicious food so close to my work. I recent relocated from the NYC metro area and was worried that finding food on par with Manhattan would be impossible. Phoenix has so much to offer and Loving Hut is right up there. They have lunch specials, a buffet, and extra score - cute ladies tee shirts and meat substitutes like TVP that you can take home to prepare!  Extremely reasonable prices, great food, and a friendly staff make me a regular here."}
{"text":"I'm in town for a few days visiting my best friend who is strictly vegan....being a vegetarian myself, Its sometimes a challenge to agree on somewhere to eat, so I let her choose. This place is AMAZING!!!! My food was so delicious and was so satisfying! We were not limited at all since the entire menu is vegan! She got a Hawaiian burger with fries and was so happy with her choice, while I got a yummy noodle bowl. I would highly suggest this place even if you do eat meat....you will not feel like you're \"missing out\"!! They even had a pretty good dessert menu and fun teas and drinks. I'm sure we'll be back again before I leave!"}
{"text":"A great spot for vegans and non vegans and it's on the west side which is nice because there's not a lot of vegan options around. There's anything from \"burgers\" to pho! I think I've tried close to the entire menu though the years and I'm always happy with how everything is prepared. Soooo thankful this place isn't too far from my house."}
{"text":"Who knew vegan food could be so flavorful and yummy?  The service is also above and beyond what you'd normally get at a casual or even a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"We really love the food here. While we tried a bunch of the menu and loved every dish so far, we especially like the big bowl menu items(ie soups, curries, etc.). They are very tasty/filling. They also have rotating lunch special items that are very reasonably priced/generous in serving size.   Staff is very friendly. Highly Recommended!!"}
{"text":"I gave a new year's gift to myself today. It all happened just like that. For a change, we decided not to host or attend any of those large New Year's parties this year. While browsing the internet I landed in VegGuide.org website to find an interesting looking vegetarian restaurant so close to where I live.  I always used to end up travelling to one of those east valley restaurants in such occasions.   When we entered the establishment the welcome was awesome. Although we had gone so close to the closing hours the staff did not show any signs of it. They patiently explained their menu, and recommended some of the finest selections. All of us were hungry and ended up ordering most them: BBQ Rolls, Chow Mein, Seaweed Ocean, SAVE-PLANET Curry, steamed rice, Silky Flan, Banana Fritters, and the Mumbai Spirit (Tea). They complimented us with a soup that we had left out. It was an awesome dinner and a great start for the New Year. My family loved all of the items we ordered and most importantly the warm eastern hospitality that we had missed for many years.    I am sure you will enjoy this place irrespective of your normal food habits or favorites.  Even vegetarians might be surprised to find many vegetarian versions of the western cuisine.  The food price is good; a couple can get a full meal dinner within $30. The place is clean, bright and the aura gives you a soothing feeling. It might be a nice surprise for east valley residents to find such a nice eatery located in the west valley.  I can't wait to go back there again just to try the next set of items from their exotic vegan menu."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant!! There are so many great dishes on the menu even meat eaters will be happy. Staff has always been very nice and everything is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Loving Hut is located on Union Hills and 35th Ave  The restaurant is always clean - Service is friendly.  By far my favorite Vegan restaurant in the Valley - the vegetables are always fresh and crisp. One of my favorite dishes is the Chow Mein."}
{"text":"Oooh Loving Hut you are so good for the soul! As a non vegan I'd like to report everything here as satisfying and yummy. So fresh and nourishing!Everyone who works here is so sweet and genuine, what an amazing team! The curry is awesome, as well as the rainbow salad, golden rolls, the flan is my favorite, and don't forget the lemongrass tea. Support local and eat healthy! So happy to see more locations being added so everyone can enjoy the deliciousness."}
{"text":"My nephew had a heart attack when he found out what he was eating wasn't meat. Lolz. I told my sister not to say anything. Watching him eat was simply joy. Hehe. So........ when I told him. He was like \"whatttttttttttt? What is soy auntie\". Haha. :) need the less to say, he killed his bbq chicken with white rice. Yummm. He said he wants to come back and try the hot dog. Haha kids.  The sauce to the spring roll was delicious!!!! I'll have that again. Oh, and their chicken nuggets too. Yummmmm.  Those are my faveee. I always get that.  I must rave about the spicy tofu pad thai. Omg. It was just beautiful.  Heaven in your mouth,  :))) I love how lemony and spicy it was    I WILL COME BACKKKK!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have never been let down by a meal at the Loving Hut. The portions are fairly large. I can finish my meal, but I have never wanted to eat any more afterwards.  They have a wide range of different vegan foods, and if you like a certain food, you can by the ingredients that went into it at the counter. The waitresses that I have a countered have all been respect and glad to answer any questions I may have.  I am also under the impression that every one I have encountered has been vegan, which gives us common ground. I could understand the average meat eating Joe feeling a bit uncomfortable in the Loving Hut due to its vegan vibe, but to us vegans it feels like home.    My wife and I come here about twice a week, and we have never left unhappy. The prices are decent too."}
{"text":"I went to Loving Hut's grand opening on Sunday the 19th.  They prepared a variety of food for us to sample, and it was delicious.  I especially liked the chow mien and the fried \"shrimp.\"  The Pink Lady was also good.  I think it is a mixture of cranberry juice and soy milk with crushed ice - very refreshing!  I have been waiting for more veg options on the west side, and I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"UTTER FAIL.  Ask anyone at culinary school this question: what two items does every great meal start with? They will answer Garlic and Onions. And not just for flavor, but also because Garlic is one if the healthiest items on planet earth. Fact.   #1 FAIL: This place does NOT cook with garlic. Therefore, I assume they do not care about my health and well-being, but care more about following the teachings of their Master. Or whatever.  UTTER FAIL.  Is their other food somewhat redeemable? Only a bit due to prices cheaper than the other loving hut joint in town. That other place cooks with garlic but has horrific service.   If looking for great vegan food, move along my friend. Loving Huts in PHX are not the place to stop."}
{"text":"My husband and I don't come here as often as we should, but when we do we love it!!!   All the food is vegan and organic. Their motto is Be Veg, Go Green, Save the Planet. They're very earth and animal friendly. There are two TVs with their save the Earth messages playing, but the volume is very low so it doesn't overpower the atmosphere.   The food is always delicious. I've tried many of their different menu items, and have yet to be disappointed. My absolute favorite is the Save the Earth curry!!! It is an amazing coconut curry.   They also have different specialty drinks to try. I recommend either the hibiscus or the lemongrass tea. They grow their own lemongrass in house for their tea also!!!   It is a little on the expensive side, but it is well worth it!! If you care about the planet and want to eat clean, the Loving Hut is the place to go!!!  If you take your receipt to the PuraTea shop next door they give you a 10% discount!!!"}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian, but I really do love the food here. I always get the golden rolls and Golden Vermicelli. Delicious. And no one had to die. This is great food! And you can get your tea fix next door at PuraTea Water."}
{"text":"The food is amazing people are friendly but the problem you have to wait 30 min to hour for ur food which makes it hard to come back specially when u only have 30 min lunch."}
{"text":"I have to admit: I am impressed.  I have been to a few vegan-only-menu restaurants and I was... underwhelmed. Nothing against the raw food movement, but unless it is a raw-specific place, I expect more creativity. Show me what food can do, be, taste like. Don't just cut it up and toss it on a plate.  Four of us came in to eat on a Saturday and the place was PACKED. A good sign, surely, AND it was a really great mix of demographics: young and old, many nationalities, singles, couples, families... we liked that it had a wide appeal.  The place smelled fantastic, too, so we started perusing the menu long before we had a table to sit at. We waited about ten minutes for a table. It's a bit like a cafeteria in that you order and pay at the counter, and the food is brought to your table.  While we waited we were given a bowl of the \"house soup\" which, basically, was warm carrot water with a piece of carrot or two and some tiny, tiny mushrooms. We all agreed that it needed more of a broth flavor (more types of veg? more mushrooms?), but it was tasty enough and definitely whet our appetites for more.  The spring rolls were really good but needed more. As we removed the peanuts for my friend, I \"blame\" this on us... I will have to have them with the peanuts next time.  The crispy rolls were spiced and savory and light and perfectly crispy.   My favorite had to be the Pate Chaude. Flaky, savory with a bite from a wonderful combination of spices, and a meatiness from the mushrooms that made us think a die-hard carnivore in our lives may not miss the meat if he were to eat it. THE dish of the day, hands down.  The curries were a bit bland (Save-Planet and Divine Curry Noodles). They were fine, OK, but nothing that made us think we'd come just for that. Much better elsewhere.  The Gracious Spicy Noodle soup was really tasty but it needed a tad more spice. With spicy in the name, we expected more.   Some stuff is pretty basic: the sushi rolls are basic veggie sushi rolls. The rainbow salad is a tasty but commonplace cabbage and carrot slaw. The fried rice was fried rice. All yummy, all fine to eat, but nothing spectacular, different, or altogether exciting. Basic isn't bad.  Four stars for the surprising and amazing pate chaude and the rolls, for sure. Ideally, 3.5 stars this trip, but I rounded up for the good parts.   Couldn't go five stars for two reasons: too many items were just basic and the service is slooooooooow. 20+ minutes for fried rice (that we had to ask about)? 25+ minutes for some soup? It was a crap shoot as to what was going to be delivered and when. While they were swamped when we came in, the crowd was thinning out for their afternoon down time (they close from 3p-5p). Overall, our lunch took over 2 hours, most of it waiting on dishes to come out. No bueno if you have other plans that day.  So... tasty, some major standouts, some \"meh, I've had this before.\" We *WILL* absolutely go back to give the menu more of a chance to wow us; the ones that knocked us off our feet are worth the return. (Hopefully it's delivered a little faster this time!)."}
{"text":"Not a place I would normally choose to go but my daughter took me and I was pleasantly surprised. I would definitely go again & recommend to others."}
{"text":"Reason I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars is due to the shitty service I received last time I was there.  To the new waitress that was working there around October-November, please, learn to be professional. If you feel the need to chit chat with the woman working at the cashier, do it outside of work.   Work and socializing should be kept separate, especially, if the restaurant is busy. How hard is that?"}
{"text":"So the BF and I went here tonight with the BF's mom and dad for his mom's birthday. She's a vegetarian and had heard good things about this place, but the rest of us are not vegetarians. So first off, this place has a very cult ish feel. The workers all seem like they're in a daze and they play a video talking about the 'grand master.' Whoa.   Anyway, so you go up to the counter to order. I got the spicy cha cha due to the overwhelming popularity of this dish on yelp, BF accidently ordered the family bean curd (he meant to order sweet and sour but gave the wrong number, his mom go the S&S, and his dad got the burger. They gave us a weird cup of soup before we got our meal. It had the consistency of egg drop.... it was pretty low on flavor, but was the best thing I had there.   First off, when we looked at the menu it said a side of rice cost 1$, but we were charged 2$ for each side of rice... wtf. Second, my food was terrible. Maybe I overlooked it, but on the menu it says that this dish is yam protein. I thought, I like yams... this was not anything like a yam. It was fake shrimp! WTF, why doesn't the menu say imitation shrimp? I hate shrimp! maybe it was my fault... but seriously, wtf. The meat had the consistency of shrimp (gross) and a weird flavor that still lingers in my mouth hours later. It was dry and had no sauce, plus it wasn't spicy. It's called spicy cha cha..... I ate a couple of the fake shrimps but that was all I could eat. The BF's was also pretty bad. It was mushy and flavorless. Supposedly the sweet and sour was good, but I didn't try it.   So his mom liked the food and that was the point of going here, but that does not mean that I have to give it a good rating. I would not go here again.... or at least until the next time BF's mom wants to go... but I'd definitely get something different."}
{"text":"So glad I went! I have heard so many good things so I had high expectations and they were easily met. It's all about the food here with so many different options. I tried a couple of different things and all was amazing. If you like Chai Tea please get one here since I am still craving another."}
{"text":"O.....M.....G this place has made my stomach so happy. This was a great 1st visit and I knew from the moment I walked in I wanted to eat there with my partner. What a way to kick off Valentine's Day but with something fresh light and healthy! I became pescatarian a year ago and this place have giving me hope on food. They have many choices and sale items for you to take home and cook. I'll definitely be recommending this place to friends and family member. The customer service was amazing the staff is nice. clean the tables and ambience was very nice , A good positive place for me to start coming to."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Love the clean atmosphere and foods! Love that we are contributing to a small family business and a better world! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Now, I understand the difference between vegetarian and vegan.   I eat meat and I love it, but my husband does not. So I wanted to surprise him and take him to dinner where he had choices. There were plenty of choices here. Don't get me wrong, I am open to eating anything. I was just as excited as he was.   We ordered our food, I got the sweet and sour chicken and he got the BBQ baguette. Our soup came out and it was so NOT good....very bland. We also ordered sushi...when it came out it was warm. Now, I don't know about you...but I frown upon warm sushi.   I actually enjoyed my meal, more so than the soup and sushi. But the portions were really small. He wasn't too crazy about his meal, although he said his meal tasted better than mine, I beg to differ.   We had to wait at least 15 minutes before he got his side of French fries which were $3.50...for a side...ridiculous. We also ordered Jasmine ice tea, which I needed a refill because it helped me swallow the bland soup and chilled up the sushi a bit. But we were denied. I heard her say she only makes 3 or 4 gallons and it finished. My husband heard her say, people ask for 3 or 4 cups and they lose money. HAHA, yup...talk about Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus. Either way we left thirsty.   We spend almost $30, and I honestly didn't think it was worth it. If you are in the area try it out, just don't make the drive if you're not."}
{"text":"How is this place still around??? I've been here 3 times over the last 4 years. Not sure why I kept going back.. Everything i've had here was flavorless. last time I went was about 3 weeks ago. I ordered the spicy soup. I really wanted something spicy with noodles. SO disappointing. there was no flavor. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"daughter and I took very finicky family from out of town there recently-the pickiest of the lot said she liked the place!  Young lady who brought our food was wonderfully passionate about what they were all about.  I love vegan food and was thrilled to know that a great place wasn't as far as I thought from anthem/new river"}
{"text":"Tastes ok..for a vegan place ,however they're not generous on the veggies at all,I like tomatoes and two out of three times I got my only one tomato slice in my burger looking like pictured :/ There's room for improvement ,portions size in general could be increased a little."}
{"text":"I am not yet vegetarian and as long as big ol' unattractive pigs that inhabit the planet and taste like bacon are roaming around, well...  I'm trying very hard to eat Vegetarian, sorta hard to eat Vegan (since I'm lactose intolerant, mostly) and minimally to eat Raw Vegan. But the latter is my ultimate body-loving goal - at least 80% of the time! But you're not reading this to hear about my culinary goals.  This month, the S.O. and me have dubbed December 2009 - Vegetarian Month. Sadly, it had only been two days and I was already craving meat for dinner so I made my 3rd visit to Loving Hut - Glendale.  First off, let's discuss the Location: I now (temporarily) reside in Glendale and this location is a pain in the @$$ even for me. Sheesh! It's near nothing of importance and if I were these brilliant enterprisers, I would search for a more convenient location for the veg-loving crowd.  Now, onto the Food and Service! The reason I gave this place 4 stars follows:  1) Phoenix, the sweet, customer service-oriented server  2) The Mongolian Wonder dish at a mere $7.25. If you try nothing else here, eat this dish, people! Trying to convert an Ominivore?  Feed 'em this and don't tell them it's not meat. If I could learn how to convert soy protein (which I try not to eat too much of due to it's estrogen-mimicking...), I would never touch red meat again without even a second thought. I don't know what's in the \"homemade spices\", but this meal is a brilliant substitute for the real thing. Have it with the steamed rice. I usually find white, steamed rice boring, but in this case, you don't want any flavors competing with this masterpiece. Oddly, though, it doesn't come with the rice but it's only an additional $1.50.  3) The simple message of doing our part to save the planet just by changing our diet works for me, even if only part-time. The decor is minimalistic and effective.  4) The water served before your meal is infused with orange and totally changes how i feel about restaurant water. I pass on straight-from-the-tap-water. Shut up! I know I'm a bit snobbish.  5) The Golden wontons are a yummy sub to the cream cheese-filled crab angels one usually gets at Asian-style restaurants. The orange joy is yummy but a bit pricey at $3.25 as is the Mumbai Spirit Chai.  6) There are a few products for sale should you wanna try and replicate something tasty you've had there. I've had no such luck but bought the products anyway. The Veggie \"chicken\" are ok.   Why I don't give Loving Hut 5 stars:  1) Location. Union Hills and 35th Ave.  Please MOVE!  2) The hours. I sometimes \"forget\" to eat and once made a concentrated trek way over to their location to try it for the first time only to find it closed. Arghh...There is a  2 hour time frame between 3 and 5 when they are closed.  3) Soy - Do your own research, but too much soy is just not healthy, yet it is in nearly every dish on the menu. Then the question is whether or not the soy is organic. Cause if it ain't, it's probably GMO (Genetically-Modified Organisms), and you don't wanna go there. I'll have to ask about that next time.   4) Not gonna go into detail but the whole \"Supreme Master\" thing kind of has a cult-like feel to it. But no one's trying to make me join anything, so I don't dwell.  5) I was very unimpressed on my 1st visit but decided to try again. The fried rice was dry and not very flavorful. And their \"Golden Beauty\" which is a much less flavorful and less salty version of The International Vegetarian House's Lemongrass \"chicken\", tasted very...soy-ee.  6) I'm not into the \"Go-up-to-the-counter-and-place-your-order-then-I'll-bring-your-food-to-you\" thing. I believe in full serve at a restaurant, especially if you're expecting me to tip.  7) It's a chain. Who knew?  Bottom line: If you're looking for a new vegetarian restaurant to try and you have time on your hands to make the hike to the most inconvenient location on the planet (heh, heh...I'm such an exaggerator), then try this place at least once. And if you're craving beef, go for the Mongolian Wonder dish. You won't be disappointed.  (Later in) December 2009 update: Oh my! The Hawaiian burger is absolutely divine. I LOVE IT!  Also, I received a message from Loving Hut regarding this review. They wanted me to know that they are NOT-FOR-PROFIT, the location is family-owned and that the main goal of the restaurant is to promote \"compassion\". Awwww....Cool points awarded, Loving Hut!   You still get 4 stars from me but as you requested, I will return!"}
{"text":"You will be greeted with a happy face and full explination of the menu, food prep was quick and artsy, very fresh and tasty. The dinning was very clean and bright! They were very interested in our opinion and making sure that we were happy ... and we were Great Place Great food"}
{"text":"I really want this restaurant to be successful. The staff is cheerful, and the west valley desperately needs more vegetarian-friendly restaurants. I can't give it a higher review because the food was rather bland, and they do not serve quinoa. In fact, the server had never heard of quinoa which is bizarre for a vegetarian place. It looks like the restaurant is just a few months old, maybe in a few more months it will improve and I can give it a better rating."}
{"text":"DISRESPECTFUL. I have eaten at Loving Hut a couple times and have always had a decent experience. However, tonight I called to make an order and we were having some communication issues with the phone lines. I kept trying to ask the staff member on the phone questions and tried to get clarification, and she would get frustrated. She started to have a tone with me, became extremely rude, and even grunted in frustration on the phone. She told me I can look online and order through there and hung up on me."}
{"text":"This is a must visit place for all the vegans and vegetarians out there. I loved the ambience right after I entered their doors. The place is so clean with white tables and chairs. It has a beautiful charm added to it. The staff there are very friendly, prompt and pay attention to detail. I ordered the golden nuggets and Arigato Sushi as the appetizer. I loved the golden nuggets so much. I even went there twice after this visit to have them for a snack. This was the first time I ever had a sushi. It was okay. I had the veggie pho without the imitation meat. It was the perfect blend of soup, veggies and noodles. The quantity I was served was very good. And on top of that, who wouldn't like pho on a rainy day in Phoenix (yes, I went there on a rainy evening). My friend had the spicy guru fried rice and he quite liked it.  I went in there the next time for the Chipotle Vegan Chicken burger. It was awesome. The sauce, the imitation soya meat patty, the bun were perfect! Don't ever miss this burger. It's a vegan boon!  If I were you, I would never miss this place! Happy munching! :-)"}
{"text":"Friendly service and a clean atmosphere set the right mood for the vegan food we enjoyed at the Loving Hut tonight.  Food was alright, and I'm sure it is healthy, but even though I was \"tummy full\" at the end, I still felt \"head hungry\" anyway.  Oh well.  Prices weren't too bad, and I'll certainly go back to try other options."}
{"text":"Fresh food with large portions.  My meat eating partner loved the King Pao.  Clean restaurant with friendly service. Daily specials."}
{"text":"first time here and i am delighted that i tried this place. i came here having low expectations about  hos the food will taste, instead i actually enjoyed what i ate. me and my company ordered the spring rolls and the golden nuggets and i must say the appetizers were so tasty! also, for the main dishes, we did order the spicy pad thai and the delightful eggplant. the pad thai was just average but the eggplant with tofu was a must try. for dessert, i liked the pandan cake over the spanish flan.   all in all, this place is a pleasant surprise for my palate."}
{"text":"The food is really good, especially the bbq roll appetizer.  I would have given them at least 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that I felt like I was being recruited into a cult during my dining experience. It was creepy. I researched the place and it is associated with supreme master ching hai organization and on every shelf there is literature about it, and the tv is droning on with the station that the cult broadcasts from.  I really don't like when businesses mix religion with their product, I think it's really annoying and offensive. I don't mind a message promoting the reasons vegetarianism is healthful and compassionate toward life, but the cult thing is a bit much. I liked the food well enough to go back, but I won't go back because of the weird vibe. That's a shame."}
{"text":"Moving some of my old reviews over to Yelp. This review was originally written/posted on 11 Jul 2009.  Note: That since I wrote this review, I discovered Green and their Big Wac burger...Green is now my #1 in AZ, with this Loving Hut being #2.  **BEST** PLACE TO EAT IN ARIZONA!!!! OMG! This is the *best place* to eat in the state of AZ! This place is so good that I ate here three times during my trip! That's saying a lot because when I travel I rarely eat anywhere more than once so that I can try other veggie places. I got the Hawaiian Burger twice and got the cheesecake one other time. I absolutely loved the burger, as did my friends. I tried my friends' entrees each time and they were so tasty. Our server (the same all three times) was the sweetest lady you could ever imagine...she was so delightful! They even have a TV show on the whole time that broadcasts 24 hour *positive* news. Positive reasons to be vegan are written on the wall as well. You must go here if you're in AZ!!! ;)"}
{"text":"What a fun place. I really enjoyed the experience. I am not sure I was that crazy about the food but that was through no faulty of the restaurant. I ordered a veg dish and a crepe type of french naming Empanada thing. Sorry forgot the name. It was stuffed with carrots and other veggies. ( that dish, by the way, was awesomely delish.)   My veggies were overcooked and a little slimy but it still tasted okay. Since I am not a veggie maybe it should have come that way. I just can't eat the soy or fake meat so I did not order any of those types of dishes. I have to admit their menu is extensive with tons of choices.   I guess I will have to go back for the Hawaiian burger, I see. I almost ordered that.  Everyone on here is saying it is delish.   The server/owner??She is a Dearheart for sure. 4 stars from me. Three for the food. I would go back."}
{"text":"Super great food!  Didn't even taste like normal vegan food.  I had the Hawaiian burger, frys, salad, and rolls. For sure coming back."}
{"text":"I have been to this locations many times, and they never disappoint. The food is always amazing and the staff is extremely friendly, my favorite dishes are the spicy cha cha, spicy guru, which isn't actually spicy, spring rolls are very good and the amazing satay is to die for.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Loving Hut is one of our families favorite places for lunch or dinner.  The staff has been very friendly.  My favorite are the fresh juices and the curry."}
