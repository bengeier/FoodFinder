{"text":"Not worth the trouble. 

Got takeout, they missed a item. Not a problem, we'll come and pick it up. 

Go pick it up, 30 min wait to get something we ordered already. At the end of it, they offered us free pop.  Absolutely no concept of customer service. 

Their excuse 'they are busy'."}
{"text":"Bad customers service need 35 dollars to order even from a distance of 2.4 km

Cheap place"}
{"text":"Pretty good overall food. Their noodles are good, so are the more basic dishes like Chilli Chicken. Some of the specials like lemon chicken are average and so is their Thai food isn't very good. Have eaten here more than once so it's a pretty consistent restaurant and wait times aren't bad. Seating room is good, usually no wait, and the restaurant is fairly clean.

There are cheaper Asian restaurants but it's not expensive either, cheaper than a lot of other nearby places and the quantity is usually pretty good.

Overall, a great place to get some hakka chow mein and something simple like Manchurian beef or chili chicken. The service is good and the wait time is not as bad as Eddie's (plus you don't have to wait to get seated or anything). They also have some good deals on lunch specials and takeout before I think 3 PM (call to confirm)."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Hakka chinese in the vicinity. Good food and excellent service. Today we were a party of 12 and ordered quite a few items from the menu, everything tasted fresh, special shout out to crispy beef and Cantonese chow mein. The servers Payal and Alisha were  gracious and helpful, exceptional service especially by Alisha.  A good place to celebrate  birthdays and family get together."}
{"text":"Been a client of this place for years. Tried other hakka places and somehow I always come back to their food. Mongolian chicken is my fav there. Really spicy food and fast service. Prices are moderate. I have never really eaten anything there and been disappointed. Truly loving it."}
{"text":"Worst FOOD place in Mississauga. The food was literally the worst thing we've ever had. We bought some guests here and it was the greatest embarrassment of our lives. They closed the lights off on us when we were eating. The didn't give our toddler a booster chair, I mean, never come here. You have been warned, this place is horrendous. Save your money. You're better off eating McDonalds, seriously. They also add their own tip + service charge. Run."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is that you get a lot of food for your buck. So if you need to feed 8-10 people, this is an ideal place to get some Indo-Chinese fare. The layout has changed a bit since my last visit. They have so many tables now that it resembles a huge office cafeteria. They must be doing very well. The food was just OK. We had a server who was actually discouraging us from ordering certain items on the menu. This place lacks two things (in my opinion) - pork and alcohol. They dont even have the BYOB concept."}
{"text":"First time here, food was exceptional for the price.

Pros:
Lunch meals are under $10 with tax
Food portions are large
One Spring roll is included, with additional choice of soup or pop

Cons:
Paper table cloths"}
{"text":"Who'd have thought that the best Hakka restaurant I've been to would've been in the middle of the burbs? (Granted it's not completely there but kinda out of my way) I went into this place with little to no expectations and was completely amazed. I tried the extra spicy Manchurian fried rice, chili fish and hot and sour soup. Hot and sour soup was great, the broth wasn't watery and it had leeks which were quite nice. The chili fish was divine. Soft, boneless fish slathered in delicious chili gravy. Fried rice was really spicy as well, had to get a glass of water a couple of times which was fine by me cause the spicier, the better. I came here for dinner with around 20 people and they were very accommodating about waiting for entire party to arrive before ordering (it was a 40 minute wait). The decor of the restaurant isn't the nicest and neither is the sketchy plaza it's located in but I don't care cause at $10/plate, you're paying for exceptionally large, delicious portions. Would recommend to all! 

Bonus: it's halal!"}
{"text":"I really dont understand the hype here. I find it super over priced and the food is not that great.... I loved the mango salad and curry chicken spring rolls the rest of the stuff was like .....2/10 

I liked it when it was park and whatever.. you know before they changed restaurants.

i dont know, i 100% would NOT recommend this place"}
{"text":"Would give three stars for the food. Average Hakka food, almost as good as Eddies down the street. Take away a star for terrible service. Waited 45 min to order, and the waitress has the nerve to hurry a child trying to order saying she doesn't have time. Are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"Pretty good Hakka place!
I ordered the apps platter, the lollipop chicken (tandoori) and pakoras were stand outs. The chili chicken was pretty good, one of the better restaurants who do it right, not too spicy or salty. The house special fried rice was also not too salty with a lot of mixed meat. The shrimp wonton soup is nothing special, the broth was a little bland.
The chicken balls were very battery and thick. 

I would go back and only order the Hakka items."}
{"text":"My family's go-to Hakka restaurant! This is where I've discovered chicken pakoras and have fallen in love with them ever since then"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Hakka restaurants in makham, scarborough, and toronto, this is one of the very few places that have disappointed me.  The service is slow, the prices are high, hence I have no choice but to give this place two stars.  The ambience is great, and the people are friendly, however it was still an overall disappointing experience. The pakoras, chicken Hakka chow mein, and chili chicken was great, but again paying on average $3-5 more per entree isn't quite worth it. Must be the demographics........"}
{"text":"Went again and ordered the wonton soup i can honestly swear it is one of the best wonton soups i have had in a long time! Wontons are large in size and filled to the max without having them burst in the tasty broth! It is phenomenal! I also had the spicy sesame beef with rice and another order of manchurian sweet and sour beef both incredibly delicious! This place is tasty and super affordable!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Service is always amazing, and the food is tasty.  I always bring friends who are visiting me here and they love it.

I usually get the manchurian chicken dry, with special manchurian fried rice.  Garlic chicken is another fav.  The lollipop chicken is spicy but good.

Lunch specials are a fantastic deal too.

wish they still had beer though :)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good Chindian (Indian-Chinese) food in Toronto, Asian Wok 'n' Roll will not disappoint. I had the Cantonese chow mein, house special fried rice, chili chicken and twice fried beef. The flavors are bold and satisfying. 

Asian Wok 'n' Roll has two locations: by the airport and at Millcreek"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Wok n Roll for the first time today and I absolutely loved it. I don't usually like seafood but I tried a seafood soup and it was extremely tasty. We also ordered some spicy noodles and chicken - not too sure what the dishes were called but they were ravishing! The food was so full of flavours that exploded in my mouth. I brought home the left overs to share with my family. I'll definitely take my family back here one day so they can taste the amazing food. I was highly impressed with the service and the timing of my meal. The price was pretty reasonable for all the food we got and I would most definitely recommend this restaurant to a family or friend"}
{"text":"Typical hakka place with poor to average service, packed on weekend nights, decent menu. Silver lining being the food which is good. I'm sure there's better hakka places in the gta but with the limited options in Mississauga this is not too bad an option especially for last minute plans as walk in is always an option (unless it's more than 5+ people). Eddys is probably better but I find the place a bit too cramped.

Their curries are good especially chilli chicken. Noodles are decent too but I'm not a huge fan of hakka noodles personally. Rice options are great though 

PS: Don't get the mango lassi. It tastes fine but overpriced for the size."}
{"text":"Decent food, overall. We got their Shrimp Pakoras - spicy and crispy, Beef Peppercorn - not as peppercorny as I'd like ;-)  but passable, and Thai Fried Rice - pretty decent. Their menu is very very similar to Eddie's Wok and Roll which is about t 2 mins away from this place (not sure if they are connected?) but somehow I think I prefer Eddies for both the food and the decor. 
Food: 3/5
Service 4/5
Ambiance: 3/5"}
{"text":"I like this place and have been here many times. Sometimes food is really amazing and sometimes it's just okay. However I have never found it to be bad. Quantity of anything served is pretty good. Servers are well behaved. Not much waiting yet always crowded. Recommend this place to everyone and I would keep coming here.."}
{"text":"this place has hakka style chinese food. i was told the owner is ethnically chinese but from mumbai. i wish i could've met her! but i also heard that she's at the other location. and when you ask there, she's at this location.

so she's on vacation.

anyway, the appetizers are great! we had the spicy deep fried cauliflower that was fantastic. didn't seem very deep fried to me, which was good. it was crunchy and spicy. shrimp pakoras: A+

other good stuff: the ginger fish and the vegetables manchurian. 

did not like: the okra or the thin noodles. both were bland and uninteresting.

the decor is very simple, the delivery is fast, no nonsense and there's nice poppy dance beats playing in the background. what more could you want?"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great value. It's so quick, great sized portions, and decent food. It's not a 5 star quality meal but for $8 for soup, entree, spicy Asian slaw, rice, and spring roll, it's pretty darn good. You just need to look past the drab 1980s old office decor to enjoy your meal.

I've had the Thai green curry and this had great flavour with mild heat. I also had the deluxe machurian vegetable and it's filled with tons of fresh crispy veg. I like this one over most Hakka places nearby because it actually has flavour without the brown goopy mess.  There's a difference between the black bean sauce, Manchurian, Schezwan, and Soy sauces.  And they're not piled on to hide the fact you have no vegetables or meat in their.  I'm always happy to go here versus Eddies wok n roll. Eddie's is too salty and they skimp on the fresh vegetables. Asian wok n roll is my 'go to' place for a good quick Asian lunch."}
{"text":"Good (and plenty) food based on price, easily shareable. 
Nice place, and gets busy at night. 
Skip the spring rolls, but the chili chicken is good!

They do not have a liquor license 

If I'm in the area, I would come by again or order take-out."}
{"text":"Get value and quality for your money. I have been going to this restaurant for years . I would classify this joint as casual dining, I prefer the take out or deliver option mostly. Food is tasty and very affordable for price, average cost of a  $10 for large portions. I have tried many items on the menu and I have zero complaints , everything is good . Ultimate favourite : tandoori chicken fried rice (the best 5/5), chili chicken, Kung pow chicken ,all manchurian dishes and lastly but most importantly crispy beef. I give this joint a 4/5 not because the food isn't great, but simply for the quality of service, ambience and experience .  *Take out is suggested *"}
