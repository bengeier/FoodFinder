{"text":"Because of its location (inside Playhouse Square) people attend Acappella for one reason: to make it to their show on time.

In the past I've gone to Acappella and I've had decent Italian-American food for a fair price, and I've always made it to the show for curtain. Yesterday, however, I went to Acappella to see a 1PM show with my boyfriend and grandmother, and I had to leave in disgust without eating lunch. 

We arrived at 11:45, and the restaurant wasn't full. However, the wait staff appeared to be in their own world and they didn't even provide us with menus (we had to go up to the hostess stand and take them ourselves). At 12:30 I asked the waitress for the ETA on our 2 pasta dishes and bowl of soup, and she informed me that the cook hadn't even started preparing them. By 12:45 we still hadn't been served and left.

In total the three of us each had some coffee and a slice of bread before the show. At no point did the wait staff let us know that they weren't able to serve us in a timely fashion, and they didn't even bother to provide us with gift cards or anything else to salvage their reputation.

The only reason I'm giving Acappella 2 stars is because in the past they have done a good job, and I'm hoping that yesterday was a fluke for them. However, after yesterday's experience, I don't think I'll bother going to them again."}
{"text":"Very nice italian resturant. Good food, nice service. I've been here serveral times and never had anything but a nice meal. It is a great place to have a meal before a show."}
{"text":"Other than being located right next to the theater, there wasn't much I enjoyed about my experience here.  Well, I guess my Peroni was cold.   The food was mediocre at best and the service, while prompt, was anything but friendly.   For the price there are better options within striking distance of playhouse square."}
