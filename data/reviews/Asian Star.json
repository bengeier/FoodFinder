{"text":"fresh vegetables, good food, only wish the portions were a little larger (but not glutinous american supersize huge)"}
{"text":"A rule of product design - you can choose for two out of the following three: cost, speed, and quality. Asian Star goes for low cost and speed. There should have been nothing surprising about that given the setting of the restaurant. I had hoped for better on quality from all the four and five star reviews on Yelp.

I went on a slow night and perhaps the chefs were just off their game that other people are praising. But no family member could make it through more than a few bites of our entrees. Far too greasy and breaded: a flavor-free zone which made for a very unappetizing experience."}
{"text":"The Chinese take out options in the Moon/Coraopolis/Sewickley area are beyond lacking. It is all either awful or way over priced. I like this place. I had the cashew chicken and it was great. The only complaint I had was that the fried rice was a little too oily. Everything was very good. Not too expensive. I'm sure we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with the food at Asian Star! My boyfriend has been picking up their shrimp lo mein for the last year or so.  The shrimp lo mein is fabulous.  I really like it for it's addition of bamboo and the lack of mushrooms.  
That being said, a week or so ago, we ordered a handful of their items which my family was very pleased with.  We ended up ordering the shrimp lo mein, the hunan beef, moo goo gai pan and the sauteed broccoli.  It was all very good!  I would definitely order from them again!  The owners are always very pleasant!  I think this restaurant is a great alternative to the other Chinese restaurant in the Sewickley area."}
{"text":"I have ried many asian style food places in the area. Most are usually pretty decent, but theyre also usually really good one time and ok or a little disappointing the next.NOT HERE...everytime i go there, i get take out, for my family and i always get a variety that usually runs $80-110. I dont mind spending that much money here because the food is ALWAYS, constantly, the same. Always delicious. At this point, this is the only place i go. I dont write alot of positive reviews, because most places disappoint at some time. I have been here at least 7-10 times and have never been disappointed. Keep up the great food and we will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Good healthy food. Good prices. Good service. Love the Kung pow chicken. Take out is popular."}
{"text":"Asian Star is a new addition to the Sewickley restaurant \"scene\". Hallelujah. It is reasonably priced delicious asian fusion. Singapore rice noodles, fried dumplings, Kung pow chicken, and chicken with garlic sauce- all delicious. 

In a town filled with expensive and highfalutin dining options it is great to have a place that values good food at good prices. 

No MSG, takeout is great, indoor seating is comfortable. 5 stars despite the homemade mustard which could be stronger."}
{"text":"Ive had Thai here and it was great! The Chinese is very tasty also. Someone here cares about the quality of the food and it shows. I live 8 miles away, and pass three other Asian restaurants along the way. The food is THAT good!"}
{"text":"They can make almost anything vegetarian so, I'm a fan! Vegetable pan-fried dumplings are filling. Kung Pao tufo and Tofu broccoli are really good especially with some hot oil. Eat here almost every week! Good prices, plenty of food and good flavor ."}
{"text":"This is my favorite quick fix gotta have it now chinese restaurant. The food is lovingly and quickly prepared and packaged with care. It is unfailingly tasty and the order is always correct. Owner operated, they work really hard to make sure you are satisfied. Don't miss the human beef."}
{"text":"Really good food! They give very generous portions! It's Family owned which is nice, it feels cozy when going there to eat. Fair prices, we like to go in the early afternoon as a Late lunch/early dinner"}
{"text":"Tiny little place in a strip mall. There is no real waitstaff, and the drinks are only bottles or cans. On the plus side, the food is rather good. We ordered the fried dumplings (average), Thai beef (good) and General Tsos Chicken (excellent). The owner served us, and was very pleasant."}
