{"text":"Great place! Lunch all you can eat for 12.99 with amazing options! 
Can't go wrong with the Malay rice and noodle dishes. Good service!"}
{"text":"Been at this spot a few times so I wanted to give it a few takes prior to giving it a fair review.

The food is very bland!  Any request for spicy food results in them tossing in chili flakes.  At Salad King they use fresh peppers!  When I was in Thailand, they use fresh peppers.  The peppers should be infused in the meal!!!

Service?  I have only gone through take out, 3 times.  My last experience was super bad.  I had to go back and forth from my office to the restaurant since they messed up my order twice.  THREE trips to that location for 1 order is unacceptable.  

The manager I met a few weeks back is super friendly!  I wish he was there to address that issue.

Best of luck to this new restaurant!  Hope they do well in the end!"}
{"text":"12.99 for lunch AYCE. extra $1 for soft drinks with free refills (good deal)! The food wasn't bad, but the chicken wasn't fresh, there was a weird taste to it. Sushi rolls were surprising good. Service was bad though. Solo diners get ignored. That I can deal with since I have been to a lot of Asian restaurants in the past with no service. But this was worse because the manager was actually quite rude. And I got the impression that he is trying to control how much you order. I might stay away until service improves. TIP: SKIP the dim sum and go for the sushi instead."}
{"text":"Actually, service is worst, you order something and they bring it partly and slow. While having all you can eat menu, even you order more they don't bring it to you and they have no explanation for it. It could get better in time but right now service is too careless."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on Saturday afternoon for a late lunch with my fianc√©. We ordered a soup and a noodle dish. The noodle dish arrived and was placed on my side of the table.  The soup never arrived. When we  asked about it the waiter said we only talked about the soup but didn't order it. Disappointment. Lesson learned repeat the order or ask the waiter to repeat the order. Went down the street to Ginger to finish the meal."}
{"text":"Updated: They've removed the all you can eat...not worth it now!


For all you can eat this is very good! 11.99 for lunch and it's all you can eat sushi, thai, Chinese and some Dim Sum. For the sushi I would recommend the fiery dragon which is dragon roll with a nice sauce on top. Thai pad thai and hot and spicy chicken are nice too. The mango salad and the dim sum were only ok. 

It's not gourmet but for the price it's DEF worth it!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time with a friend. This location has been under renovations or construction for a while, and it hasn't really picked up speed, so it's easy to pass it by.
That and it's name doesn't seem that prominent, I thought Hot and Spicy was the description. Oh well.

First impressions; it looks pretty fancy inside, kinda shiny, and the waiters and waitresses use littler ipad things to take your order. I almost felt like I didn't belong. But they were quite friendly, I guess they should be since it was only us and one or 2 people getting take out.
My friend got the mango chicken, and I ordered a lunch special of grilled teriyaki salmon.

 The special was great, it came with a really good hot and sour soup, some dark organic rice and your typical kind of salad. The salmon was very good.
The mango chicken was good but it wasn't a hit. And it costed about $5 more since it wasn't a special..

I think overall the regular menu is a little pricey for me compared to other things nearby. I would come back for the special if I come back, since it was quite good and better value than what else was on the menu. And the service was a-ok. 
I think this place needs some more chances!"}
{"text":"I've been here once before and would have given them a 4/5, but today, the service was confused and slow.  The food was ok. There are better choices in the neighbourhood.

They were slow taking my order, 10 minutes later another waiter brought me another menu.  They missed bringing out my appetizer. Kung Pow Chicken was ok and then it took some effort to get my bill."}
{"text":"No stars!!! Worst food and service I have received in a long long time. Got all you can eat. Our second round of order got lost somehow. Waited almost 30 mins for the food to come. Lost all the appetite. The manager was extremely rude. Never come back again!!!!
That manager should be fired yesterday, if he even cared..."}
{"text":"Dropped by for all you can eat (AYCE) lunch. For $12.99, it wasn't bad. Now for that price, don't order any raw fish dishes. It won't be 'jumped out of the water' fresh.

The soups were good - a bit starchy but the hot and sour tasted fine. 

Thai mango salad - skip. The mango was nice but the sauce was awkward. Kind of like that teenager that hopes to be cool but can't figure out what style they are going for - grunge? Hipster? Goth? I would say \"traditional\" is best 4/5 times.

I would highly recommend the teriaki chicken. I found their grilled dishes to be piping hot and crisp. I also enjoyed the inari and unami - not huge pieces but they were good...

I'd go back. The service was quite attentive but you had better keep track of what you ordered. They often forgot your dishes or lost track of them. Hence why I can't comment on the dim sum, it never arrived!"}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant and lots of great options to choose from. The servers were great and the atmosphere was lovely. Drinks are reasonably priced, too.

The sushi was okay- not top bar but not too bad. It was atleast good enough that I want to come back and try one if their main courses!

It's always empty because people don't know yet what this place has to offer."}
{"text":"Just came back from the AYCE Lunch & gonna write & rate as I can still remember it:

Miso Soup (3.5 Stars)
Hot & Sour Soup (3 Stars)
Thai Mango Salad (3 Stars - couldn't tell if the dressing had Fish Sauce in it)
Satay Beef - WOULD NOT order again, too chewy
Satay Chicken (4.5 Stars - *REALLY GOOD!*)
California Roll (3.5 Stars)
Dynamite Roll (3.5 Stars)
Spicy Salmon (4 Stars)
House Fried Rice (3.5 Stars)
Thai Basil Eggplant (3.5 Stars)
Fried Tofu - WOULD NOT order this again.  Was under the impression this was cubes of tofu with the fried tofu skin, but it turned out to be tofu wrapped in won ton wrappers & deep fried
Har Gow (3 Stars)
Siu Mai (3 Stars)

PROS:
- We were able to get a seat when we arrived at 1:15 pm, but the place got pretty packed shortly after. 
- $1.00 Bottomless pop soooo good, not watered down at all.
- The place is done up all fancy-like.  Nice atmosphere to sit in.
- Service was quick & *SUPER* friendly

CONS:
- No dessert on the AYCE menu.  
- Dim sum items weren't that great - its like they needed more salt.  Kind of bland.

NEUTRAL/OTHER OBSERVATIONS:
- Didn't have the wonton soup when I ordered it, so I went for Hot & Sour instead.
- The food here is kind of like Manchu Wok/Szechuan-Szechuan type food, with the addition of Sushi though  
- Even though it says on the menu they will charge $2.00 for each item not consumed, they didn't charge us, even though we had about 3 half-dishes of uneaten items left.
- If sitting by the windows facing Queen St., you don't wanna be facing west cause the sun will be shining in your face.  =S

- I would go back for sure.  =)  The food could use some work though."}
{"text":"Had the all you can eat and it really surprised at the variety of food offered. Salmon carpaccio is definitely worth trying as well as the thai basiil eggplant.don't expect service but they are friendly."}
{"text":"Nice Decor, mediocre food. Do not go.
This \"asian fusion\" is really terrible."}
{"text":"Dropped by for dinner before a movie at Scotiatheatre. Bad decision. Should have walked a few extra steps to the more well known and well rated places. This place felt like a tourist trap. Dinner is not all you can eat, but ala carte.

Besides the green tea, nothing was ok. Hot and sour soup was commercial and average (probably better than anything else we ate). Chicken in black bean sauce was so bland and bad (even though we asked for spicy). Fried rice was meh. Sui mai and har gow were glutinous and barely had flavour. Very sorry to have spent any money here at all. Just looks clean and neat and spacious. That's all. Walk a few extra steps to Queen Mother or even Ginger. Or Trimurti Indian food across the road. Don't get trapped here."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my family and had a very poor experience. The restaurant was empty so we were excited to have dedicated service. 

Pros (although not many):

1. Decor is modern and appears fairly clean. 

Cons:

1. Very slow and incompetent service, despite being one of the only families at the restaurant. They kept getting our order wrong and bringing out duplicate dishes. An hour in to dinner we still did not receive our sushi and had to place our order again

2. \"Cooked\" dim sum dishes coming to the table raw

Would not come back and would not recommend."}
