{"text":"Everything we've had there is delicious. The fry bread is a must have, my kids love the fry bread dogs with cheese. We've tried the Navajo tacos, chimichangas, corn cakes, quesadillas, and big beef tamale - they've all been amazing. It's simple, fresh, homemade, and delicious. Beware the chili is spicy, but if you like spice its a good choice. The portions are huge and prices are very reasonable. Our favorite Mexican food place! The only issue is they close at 5, before dinner time for most people. So you have to get there early."}
{"text":"Have lived close for 10 years. We continue to eat Indian fry bread here at least once a month. It it's always fantastic and consistent in every way.   We are always greeted with friendly smiles and great fun attitudes. Always a fun place to visit.   It is a great tourist spot to visit too."}
{"text":"After moving out of the southwest, I would have cravings from Indian frybread. Thank you Indian Village for filling a 4-year old craving!!! The frybread was delicious and crispy with minimal oil (considering that it is fried in oil). It was served nicely hot and fresh with powered sugar and honey. Delish!!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, good vibes, and amazing food! The staff always shows that they have time for you, every time I am here. This is a must-try establishment in a great town! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Arizona. The owner, Bart, is also a local character and worth getting to know."}
{"text":"Meh... Chimichanga seemed like it was a pre-made, kinda boring. I had something a bit more authentic.. Decent, bit nothing special. The chips are just like Mission out of a bag from Costco..  Like another reviewer mentioned. There are way too many other places in Cave Creek to try."}
{"text":"The fry bread with beans and cheese was pretty good. Wish I had gone for the sweet option. Wasn't very impressed with the tacos - expected authentic soft shell style, but in actuality they were heard shell and taco-bell like."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place considering all the great reviews I read on Yelp.  I did find that my order was good enough to eat on an empty stomach, however, it was quite disappointing. I ordered the machaca burrito and the traditional fry bread with honey and powdered sugar-to go.  I had not realized that my 'packed to go meal'  was missing plastic-ware, napkins, and hot sauce/salsa until I sat down to actually eat it.   That was the first bummer. I started with the burrito and it was like eating a cheese and onion burrito, I could not taste any machaca until I reached the middle of the burrito! It was horrible.  I gave up at the point, because I was already full from all of the tortilla, cheese, and onion...it came with beans, but no salsa.   I then ate one quarter of the fry bread, which was great to see that they actually prepare it for you, makes it so much easier to eat in quarters.  The fry bread was  good, it was very thick so I couldn't taste much of the honey or the sugar.  I guess I am used to fry bread being more airy, light, and fluffy vs this dense. Also, I guess I prefer my machaca burrito to actually have some machaca entirely throughout the burro.  I would eat here again if I were hungry for something different, but I would stick with the fry bread.  The service was great, the man who helped me was very communicative and appeared to be genuinely jovial, which is always great to work with these types of owners/employees."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've ever had! And the fry bread  oh and we love Bart! All the food tasted fresh!"}
{"text":"We were wanting a small dive with authentic, good Mexican food...and that's exactly what we got. Food tasted great, chicken tacos were good and my husband loved the tamales. The fry bread with honey and sugar was so yummy. If you're wanting a small mom and pop joint, this is your place."}
{"text":"I thought by going to the Indian village I would get some great food. I have gotten their fry bread before and it was pretty tasty so I thought I would try something else. I went there with my friend. I got 2 chicken tacos and frybread with powdered sugar and honey and he got a vegetable,egg and cheese breakfast burrito. When we got the food it looked really appetizing. When we started to eat it was a different story...  The food was very bland...VERY BLAND. The chicken tacos had no seasoning or anything. The plate came with a side of salsa so I tried to use that to kick off the flavor. Didn't work. With no Tabasco or any other hot sauce I decided to just tough it out and finish my plate. My friends breakfast burrito was not impressive either. He had the same complaint of blandness. The fry bread was the only thing that was good. It was very inexpensive so I'm not too upset (both of our meals plus fry bread and drinks were 20$) but as a college student I would have liked to save the money or cooked something at home.   I told my parents about the experience and they said it was hit or miss. So if you feel like taking a food gamble go to the Indian village.    Also the service was at par. Nothing great but nothing awful."}
{"text":"The best chicken enchiladas I have had. The enchiladas are stuffed with chicken from end to end. Try the honey indian fried bread. Will come back"}
{"text":"What a fun if not microscopic place.  Maybe seating for 20?  Totally did not to know what to think when we got there until I saw a lady and her son carrying out boxes and boxes of food for a \"moving party\".  Ok, we were in.  My wife's family and I was looking for something unexpected and we sure did find it.  The guacamole and pico starters were excellent, my wife and son's tacos and quesadilla were great, and sister in-law's chicken enchiladas were out of this world.  My in-laws and all tried the Navajo Taco.  They loved it.  I was not so in love, but I like very spicy and savory foods.  The fry-bread shell was a bit sweet for me.   The owner is a Hoosier who seems to own the shop and his house out back.  A real character."}
{"text":"You can grab some of this awesome Mexican food and walk across the parking lot and have a beer at the Hideaway bar   Everyone is cool.  You will be put off by the look of the Indian Village but it is great.  If you go to the Hideaway they have menus and will be happy to call your order.  It's a win win.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING is good.  And do not miss out on the Honey Fry Bread! It's to die for!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Cave Creek. The bigger Owner can be a sour puss if you will but heck he knows it so that's ok with me. If your going to dish it out, you best be able to take it as well."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here on our arrival in Cave Creek. Told our friend who lives there we wanted real Mexican food, so he took us here. The taco's were amazing, shells were made fresh for each order, salsa was different then we are use to but very good  Guacamole was great!. It could be easy to pass by this place as it is very unassuming. But you'd miss great food and a very casual atmosphere. A local gem!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's inside an american indian souvenier shop.  just go to the back place your order and sit in their little eating area.  Everyone their is friendly and the Navajo Frybread is absolutely delicious.  It's huge and hard to finish.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy certainly, but pretty good Mexican and Indian food.  Not any seating inside but some benches outside. Sill its mainly a to-go place.  And prices are great as you just get the bare minimum of extras. Still, well worth a stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Best damn chimichangas north of the border and in all of Phoenix metropolitan Phoenix. Don't forget to pick up a Mexican blanket, kachina, and a cave creek tshirt to memorialize the occasion. Bring your Mexican, Native American, et al friends!!!  This place is legit."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very unique and certainly worth a visit for being so.  Based on the food alone it was very average.  Large portions and good prices don't make up for the blandness of the food.  The best item was the chicken enchiladas with green chili sauce but they still lacked a depth of flavor."}
{"text":"Not sure if I caught them during a bad day but I honestly can't understand the positive reviews besides its a lot of poor tourists that don't understand what good fry bread or Mexican food tastes like. I've lived in Arizona my whole life, along with my dad, grampa, and great grampa moved here in 1940. I work near there so I figured I would give it a shot and order a Navajo taco and a crunchy chicken taco. It was HORRIBLE!!!! I should have known when I walked into a gift shop to pick up my food that it might be a tourist gimmick and I should have listened to my gut. The fry bread topping was tasty but the actual bread was more of a flavorless donut than an airy frybread. I was embarrassed for them when I took a bite into my flavorless taco. I'm not exaggerating when I say the chicken was flavorless and it was so dry and crusty, the ends were crispy but not from cooking it. I would co pair it to jurky more than taco meat. I will never return unless I need a decently priced tourist nick knack."}
{"text":"Superb, fun, not for snobs.  Bart is a terrific host, and, yes, the front of the store is the best kind of tourist trap, but what's served out back is authentic and awesome. This is a place I crave if I don't get there for a couple weeks. Go soon and often."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for a quick bite to eat - we got the honey Indian bread (sweet warm and delicious). The \"special\" which was our favorite, had a small kick to it but nothing too strong, and the chimichanga (good but not as good as the other 2.  They have a small place to sit in the back or outside"}
{"text":"I can't believe I just found out about this place!!! Freaking amazing authentic food.  A real diamond in the roof, Indian village is charming and real. The service was great and totally appreciate the cooks for the fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Hey...Note to Owner!!! When one of your vendors is stocking the shelves and saying  to you ...\"\" Damn touristas\"\" you should throw the mother fucker out the god damn door..!! Yep..I was a \"touristas\" standing there ..Spending money in your store, to help pay your Rent and feed your family... I live in an area where we have a shit pile of \" touristas\"..They pay my mortgage..!! What a shit show....Good luck!!"}
{"text":"I love the style of cooking they have it feels just like home! I always say I hate eating Mexican out because I always compare it to the delicious home cooking I'm used to, but this is one place I love. Their fry bread with honey and Powdered sugar is delicious I always get it. Today I had the enchiladas and they were so cheesy and great! I understand why some people say the chicken lacks flavor but when the salsa and cheese is so flavorful adding more flavor to the chicken would make the meal too heavy, and if there is one thing I hate is heavy food. This meal was just right! The service is always amazing the gals are always so nice and you can tell they work extra hard! The shop in the front always has really cool items! 5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"Indian Village just isn't cut out for vegetarians, but I have no doubt that meat eaters would be happy and satisfied here. It's definitely a unique experience and eating there sort of feels like a place you'd stop at on a road trip in the middle of the desert. I tried the Bean & Cheese Burrito, Navajo Taco with pinto beans instead of chili, Cheese & Spinach Quesadilla, and the Spinach Enchiladas. The Spinach Enchiladas were the only item with flavor, otherwise everything else was very bland. The hot sauce was too hot for me, so I couldn't add flavor in that way. My husband had a breakfast burrito (with the chili meat) and thought it was good, so I'm thinking anything with meat is what brings the flavor. I had a cinnamon sugar fry bread for dessert, and that was really good - light, fluffy, and thick."}
{"text":"Today we lunched at a remarkable hole-in-the wall restaurant in Cave Creek, known as Indian Village.  Really more gift shop than restaurant, it is right next to one of the ubiquitous biker bars that dot the Cave Creek landscape (The Hideaway Grill, in this case).  They have a large menu of Mexican favorites, such as burritos, enchiladas and chimichangas.  What sets them apart however, is their Indian Fry Bread.  You can get this house specialty in a variety of ways: plain, with sugar, with honey, with chili, etc., etc.  My advice is whatever you order, get some of this remarkable fry bread.  To get something comparable you need to make a pilgrimage to Tuba City or Kayenta.    I had the house specialty, a Navajo Taco with red chili, beans, lettuce, tomatoes and onions, all inside the Fry Bread.  YUM!  My bride had a chicken chimichanga which was on par with the chimichangas served at Carolina's, which are generally thought to be the best in Phoenix.  DOUBLE YUM!  Clearly we will be back (OFTEN) to sample more of the menu, and get more of their delicious Fry bread.  This is nothing fancy--you order at the kitchen counter and eat at either tables in the back or picnic tables in the back of the restaurant.  For a minute, I felt I was in Tuba City in the middle of the Navajo Reservation, waiting to see Jim Chee or Joe Leaphorn (reference thanks to Tony and Anne Hillerman's marvelous Navajo detective duo).  They are only open from 9 to 5 p.m., so if we're thinking dinner, you should refocus on breakfast or lunch.  I think they would do better to turn the gift shop into more tables and stay open later, but what do I know?"}
{"text":"Delicious! Was up here in cave creek shopping and stopped in with my husband. Very rustic, very unique, very friendly. Ordered the Navajo tacos and they were really good.  The shoots located in was fun to walk around in while we waited for food and overall we had a really good experience. Will definitely be coming back again:)"}
{"text":"The food here is simply amazing. When I walked in, i did not know what to expect. But, my friend assured me that this place was the real deal. I had the spinach enchiladas and they were made with perfection. This place is exactly how I like my Mexican food. We sat outside on some benches which had a real cool southwestern feel. (which was wonderful since I am not from the area) Can't wait to try this place again!!"}
{"text":"The fry bread was amazing and I will be back for more but the chicken tacos were a little dry. I recommend sticking with the fry bread and the chili which was my favorite part."}
{"text":"Maybe all the positive reviews are for the fry bread.  This place has terrible \"Mexican\" food.  Plain chicken wrapped in a shell with no seasoning covered with lettuce and tomato does not a taco make.  Just nothing worth coming back for"}
{"text":"Casual little spot to eat in the back of a cool Southwestern store, fresh and good quality ingredients, nice lunch spot. The specialty Navajo taco keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Best Fry Bread and Chili I've had, great place for lunch, gift shop had cool stuff as well, worth the stop, you will not regret it"}
{"text":"(from susan) This is my favorite place when we visit - I get the cheese enchiladas - like everything but the chili (too hot for my ulcer) - the owner is a sweetie and this is a great shop to buy stuff to take home for friends. Gotta eat here at least once - preferably more! It is really eclectic ..... go casual (lol).....have fun and bring the whole family!"}
{"text":"Best fry bread in the north valley hands down. Definitely a delightful hidden gem."}
{"text":"Really fresh mexican food.....good prices and owner is very friendly. He'll-fire burrito is great."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and we were looking for a quick lunch and a good taco. We found both!! Great chicken tacos!! I like chicken breast shredded with no surprise fillers--these were great!! Next time we will try the fry bread--it looks amazing!!"}
{"text":"I am so thankful my family and I stopped here on our recent trip to the Scottsdale area. If you see the sign from the main road through Cave Creek, pull over. From the front, it looks like another gift shop, but there sure holds a lot more inside. Wonderful WONDERFUL food! I had the Navajo taco, that is served on Indian fry bread, has deliciously seasoned, tender shredded beef in a savory sauce, pinto beans, shredded lettuce and cheese as well as tomatoes and onions. To die for. We also wanted to try the chili and it was spicy and great as well. My whole family was incredibly happy with what we all ordered. I will definitely make a point to stop here again the next time I am in the area!"}
{"text":"This place was on my list of places to try, so after the butcher we stopped for lunch and boy am I glad we did. Got the Southwest Chili with Fried bread and it was amazing. One of the best cups of chili I've had in a long time, lived in the Northwest too long where they know nothing of chili. The fried bread was fluffy and hot but not greasy and was perfect with the heat and flavor of the chili. I will definitely be back for lunch in the future. What a gem."}
{"text":"TACO BART  The best!  The food here is so good! They aren't messing around.  They only have a swamp cooler, no ac. It's perfectly authentic Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Cave Creek is such a cute little town and everytime I go to AZ I stop by the town it is so old west!!! We were wandering through and were hungry and saw a sign for Indian Fry Bread!! YUMMY!! So basically you go in through the souvenier shop and walk through a little alley/kitchen and there is a small dining room 5 tables or so nothing fancy.. I was very much like Mexican food with the beans ect, the bread was really good and the owner was so so friendly love it!!!!!"}
{"text":"It is a combo gift shop/restaurant.  The food is authentic Mexican and prepared by natives. The fry bread is great! There is a dining room in the back of the store and outdoor seating on the porch.  They have a nice assortment of Cave Creek t-shirts, jewelry, and cactus plants.  Local jewel!"}
{"text":"The food here was fantastic. It's one of those places you need to take visitors from other states. The deep-fried tacos are delicious and the Indian fry bread is something you will come back for. This was our first visit and I cannot wait to come back. A really fun place to go."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food with lots of flavor. I appreciated the vegetarian option and enjoyed the spinach enchiladas.  Very nice people working there, all were helpful, and the service was good.  Casual atmosphere and an interesting spot to see and watch the surrounding activities in this truly fun western town.  I look forward to my next visit to try a few other choices on the menu."}
{"text":"This is a great mom and pop shop with great food.  I read some of the other reviews and the ones that gave it low stars are ridiculous.  They were expecting something that is clearly not how this shop operates.  Also, I think someone reviewed their ribs, which they do not have there and clearly mistook the Indian Village for The Horny Toad which is next door.  But, if you want good tacos, good people and a good environment, check this place out.  The owner is particularly hysterical."}
{"text":"I love this place. The spinach enchilada plate was fantastic. The owner is very friendly and entertaining. We are looking forward to trying other items from the menu. I purchased merchandise as well. The prices are very reasonable. We will be regulars!"}
{"text":"The chicken burrito and powdered sugar fry bread is the best. It's a drive but it's worth it for a true hole-in-the-wall experience."}
{"text":"Authentic Arizonan food. Unique and eclectic atmosphere. Shop while you wait for your food. Friendly owner and staff. Definitely THE place to eat in cave creek!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice experience.  Went there yesterday.  The food was great.  Servings were generous and the staff workers were very friendly and helpful with the menu.  We will definitely go back there again and again."}
{"text":"Hello my name is Eve and I'm a \"Bart-aholic\". I love this place and have been coming here for almost 30 years. I'm guilty of getting my friends and family addicted as well. Thats not hard to do when the food is awesome, the people there are friendly and Bart (the owner) is funny as can be! My personal favorite is the Navajo Taco or hot frybread drizzled with honey yummm!"}
{"text":"Indian Village is located in the heart of Cave Creek and offers a unique blend of Southwestern and Mexican cuisine.   Their Indian Fry Bread is incredible and offers a much needed reprieve during the months leading up to the state fair. More importantly, their food is a bargain offering large portions for low prices.   The owner is almost always there and is quite the character. Him and staff are kind and offer a welcoming environment each and every time. I've only eaten here a few times and he already recognizes me by name. Definitely THE place to eat whenever you are passing through Cave Creek."}
{"text":"I love this place, who eats a hot dog in fry bread.   You will if you go to Indian Village.   Great tacos, fry bread and burritos.   Stop at the Circle K next door and get a sixy of your favorites to enjoy with the best mexican food in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"This place is worth 3 stars at most , bland no flavor fry bread tacos... The fry bread was too doughy and soft and thick for me , I like my fry bread more airy and a little more crispy. The beans were dry and the cheese wasn't even melted. The staff was very nice , the  atmosphere is very cool , bikers everywhere :) it's next door to a biker bar. I love that it's a hole in the wall kind of place which usually has the best food ...  I'd probably try it again after a few drinks next door .. Food always taste better then ! Maybe that's why all the high reviews !?"}
{"text":"I have lived in Arizona near  Cave Creek my entire life. I have never been here before. The owner Bart is real friendly and is fun to talk to them. The food was amazing. I enjoyed their Navajo taco was made fresh and was very filling. The Navajo fried bread was good. If you want an authentic Arizona food this is the place!!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem for cheap lunch in Cave Creek. Restaurant is a little dive shack in the back of a souvenir store. Indian fry bread and tourist friendly inauthentic Mexican food. Simple cheese and meat fried to gooey goodness. Low brow heaven. Pro tip: on a nice day sit on the patio out back - even more hidden than the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Esposa and I grew up in the Valley, so we know our share of Indian-influenced Arizona-Mexican food.  This is a funky little place, but the signs out front make it clear to keep on walking to the back of the shop.  There, we were greeted by an older gentleman who we assume was the owner.  He was a bit dry but got our orders taken.  Not real talkative.  He pointed us to the back (of the back of the shop).  So, we grabbed our cups of ice and walked by the two women making the food in a small 8X8 room.  One was pounding away at fresh, handmade tortillas and the other assembling the food.  It all looked fresh and hot.  We found our way to a small, rickety table.  One of the gals shouted out order numbers.  After watching this show for about 10 minutes, our order was ready.  We had green chili with beans on Indian fry bread.  It was...good.  Not very good, not great, and certainly not \"the best\" or \"wonderful\" as so many others have said.  This was one of the truly rare times when I was compelled to add salt to food at a restaurant because it was a bit bland and lacking in flavor.  Honestly, I think this would be a great place for casual food with a beer while watching a live band nextdoor.  But to come here for just the food?  Me thinks not."}
{"text":"This place is by far one of the BEST places to eat real, good food here in Cave Creek. Great friendly staff, who makes you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food to be found. Always fresh, delicious. Sit out front and watch the bikers drive by.  Chicken spinach enchilada to die for."}
{"text":"This place is a total dive - in all the right ways.  1) It's in the back room of a gift shop. 2) You have to walk through the kitchen to get to the dining room. 3) The food is incredible - as authentic as it gets.  I highly recommend ANYTHING with their Chorizo. And obviously - their Indian Frye bread is some of the best I've ever had.  The owner / guy running the register - Bart - is worth a visit even if you don't try the food. But he'll probably talk you into it if you were thinking of not eating."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals we have ever had in vacation. An off the beaten path hole in the wall with the most amazing fry bread ever and staff we had the pleasure of meeting. We tried several items on the menu (there we're 7of us) they were all delicious."}
{"text":"What an enjoyable experience.  Great food, nice employees and a fun / unusual atmosphere.    The food came out fairly quickly and was really great.  My chicken enchiladas with Salsa Verde were outstanding as were the shredded beef tacos.   The chili was good and spicy though slightly different in style than I'm used to.    I Love \"Hole in the Wall\" type places and this place DEFINITELY fits that description.   If you don't mind \"downscale\" with great food, this is your place.   I only wish they had beer.  :-)      I also wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"My favorite local eatery.. Super clean kitchen Excellent food.. Nice staff ... Way better than el encanto !!"}
{"text":"Lived in Cave Creek for 18 months and never knew there was a \"restaurant\" inside.   Looks like your typical tourist trap trinket store.   But they have excellent Mexican fare inside. Patio table seating only.   The essence of typical \"dive\" dining. Less than casual. LOL!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Tamales are very good and a large portion. You can't go wrong with the Indian flat bread. An extra side of pico- solid choice!!"}
{"text":"such a good place. my parents know the owner bart personally and he is always really friendly talkative and always has a smile on his face. kind of hidden from more of the desert ridge area and kierland but it definitely is worth the drive if you live far! fry bread, tacos, and burritos are definitely the best here. super cheap which is better. employees are always working hard and smiling so thats a plus. food comes out very fast and theres seating out and inside. there is a bathroom which doesnt look like there is one but there is and thats a good thing for a carefree restaurant!"}
{"text":"If you don't try the Navajo Taco you'll never know what you missed!  I'm not a lover of Mexican food, but I've never had a lunch I didn't like at Indian Village. When volunteering for the local chamber of commerce, I always recommended this place and several folks came back to thank me for a memorable meal at a very inexpensive price.  Don't let the lack of ambiance fool you, the food is the reason this place is great."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the fry bread, but that doesn't mean the other menu items are not good. It was too dense and didn't have much flavor."}
{"text":"2 words: Fry Bread. There is something about fry bread that makes me feel like a kid. Then it makes me want to break out in Dr. Seuss rhymes.    Fry Bread, Fry Bread. You're so great. I want you piled high on my plate. Powdered sugar or cinnamon sweet. You're so darn yummy, you knock me off my feet.  When I first moved to PHX I was exploring my new neighborhood and happened upon this place. I saw their sign from the main road and almost got whiplash when I saw \"Fry Bread.\"   It's a small little shop with souvenirs and a little kitchen in the back where the magic happens.    They have hand-written menus, which detail all of the ways you can get your fry bread, some of which include traditional Native American dishes (like a Navajo taco). They also incorporate some Mexican dishes.  I initially thought this was a Native American-run business (which I try to support as much as possible), but the ladies there speak Spanish, and an American runs the souvenir shop, so I'm not sure who owns it.  Anyway, I've never ordered anything other than the sweet fry bread, so I'm unable to comment on the food.  (I need to ask if their rice and/or beans are veg-friendly.)  So... About that fry bread.  It's always perfect.  Light and crispy, yet soft dough, with enough powdered sugar to give me a new complexion by the time I'm done. Exactly the way I like it.  With every bite I look up to the sky and thank the heavens for this good life and fry bread.  You always want to eat it while it's hot and fresh off the fryer.  No waiting until you get home or wherever you're going.  You'll only be doing yourself a disservice.   There are bench tables in the front and back of the shop, so have a seat and enjoy.   They close up pretty early (like @ 3p or 4p, or so; I'll need to verify hours on my next visit), so if you're coming up, make this your first stop.   I like this location because it's a straight shot up N Scottsdale Rd. Make a left onto  Cave Creek Rd, go down just a little and it'll be on your right."}
{"text":"Every year we visit PHX and head up to Cave Creek to visit Bart and eat some fry bread. Always delicious, always character, always an experience. Love this little place."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago but I have traveled to Arizona many many times. I discovered this place on my first trip and now every time I vacation to Arizona I make sure I go to Indian Village MULTIPLE times. I love their tacos and the crunchy shell is amazing and they taste so fresh. I also like their enchiladas. The place is a dive but I often find those are the best places. The service is friendly, Bart, the owner, is wacky but he keeps you entertained while you wait for your food.  I usually browse in the shop attached to the restaurant. I can't wait for my next Arizona vacation so I can go to Indian Village again!!!"}
{"text":"Hoping for a unique Arizona experience, we stopped in to Indian Village, Carefree for lunch. At $26 for tacos for three people, it wasn't at all the \"little local joint\" atmosphere we were expecting. Staff was straight faced, minus any warm and fuzzy. Food, albeit just standard fare, came out quickly. Seven tables inside the dining area needed attention and there was no temperature control. It was freezing cold inside. There was an outdoor patio with additional tables but we probably won't go back to see if it was any cleaner."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem in Cave Creek.  Great fry bread, great mexican food. From the outside, you would never think there is a eating establishment here.  It is in the back of a gift shop.  You order your food at the counter and the tables are located behind the kitchen area.   It is a quirky place but it definitely fits right in with the town of Cave Creek."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located inside a retail store, taking up small back corner. The store itself has lots of merchandise specially for cave creek such as t-shirts, rugs, ponchos, etc.   The restaurant is small but has lots of indoor and outdoor seating. They make their food fresh and tastes homemade. The chicken in the enchilada and taco is so moist and soft. The sauce is wonderful; I wanted to lick the plate. They make their own salsa and is so yummy.  The fry bread with honey and powder sugar is so good. I don't know where else you would get this good fry bread. Price is right too! Highly recommend. I want to go back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a hole in the wall, but the best place to get Mexican food particularly the spinach and chicken enchilada.  Unless you have a hearty appetite, plan on sharing... Guacamole and salsa nothing special, but good. We go for lunch as only open till 5 PM and no liquor license..."}
{"text":"My friend and I were swayed by other reviews to try this restaurant, expecting a gem in the rough - a treasure - an amazing find!!!!  We didn't find it here.  In clarification:  it didn't taste BAD.  It was just nothing special.  I've made better at home just by trying.  The most flavorful part of the meal was the hot sauce on the table...essential!  and not just because I like a little spice (and I do mean a little) but because I prefer flavor to my food - especially when I have a choice.  The reason I didn't give just one star is because it seemed clean and had a cool \"hole in the wall\"/mom&pop feel.  There was no \"service\" to speak of - it's a \"we'll cook it and you pick it up at the window\" environment.  Totally fine (if the food is good).  The people were very nice, but there are just so many other places to try that unless the experience is craving-worthy, I'm moving along, no harm no foul, just no looking back."}
{"text":"Excellent. This is some of the best Mexican food around.  I've had the tacos, the enchiladas, beans, rice, and THE CHILI...the chili is killer, it's all great. You can't go wrong. Super nice folks too. I think my favorite is the chicken and spinach enchiladas."}
{"text":"It's cool because it's a big time dive. The food is ok. The shells are deep fried, but the guts are very boring. Overall it's ok and the prices are ok. It's worth going once...twice max."}
