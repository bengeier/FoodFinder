{"text":"I've given this place several chances, but they just aren't cutting it. I haven't had any problems with their other locations, but this one consistently has issues with service. I like their location and nice view of the boardwalk and lake, and their food is good, although for some reason not as good as the other Sushi 101 locations. The inside is nice, but could be cleaner. It looks like they never clean under the tables at the couches.  I also have noticed they don't have the greatest sanitation rating, which is a little frightening for a sushi restaurant.  The main problem, though, is the service. It's just always bad.  It doesn't matter if it's crowded, not crowded, lunch, dinner, weekend, weekday. I've tried all different times and it's just consistently bad--even when the owner is there. He seems to just wander around doing nothing and not noticing that people aren't being attended to by the servers.  Refills are hard to come by and the delivery of the food is strange.  After waiting for awhile, someone at the table may receive an entree when nobody else has even been served their soup or salad.  I want to like them, but they make it very hard."}
{"text":"Great restaurant to have great sushi and chat with friends and family. I've been here so many times and have a great experience every time I come here and good wait times for food."}
{"text":"Some of their appetizers is a hit or miss, so be careful on that. Their sushi is delicious though. I was kinda surprised they had pho despite there was another pho restaurant right next to them..."}
{"text":"Went here right before closing and ordered some sushi.  The flavor was fine but the execution SUCKED.  Yeah, I know they were in a hurry and I know I walked in right before they closed but please take the time to roll the sushi and cut it evenly.  (If this is normal, no wonder people complain....I could roll sushi better than they did....) The service was a complete contrast to the preparation.  They were great!  Even though it was late, they were very accommodating.  

service 5/5
food:
prep 2/5
taste 4/5"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's with the low rating for.  Myself coming from a city that has sushi restaurant in every corner battling for who has the best sushi , this place was not so bad.   I ordered the  cold sushimi here . It came out, the colors on it is good and it's firm.  Definitely can tell that it's not prepackaged like some of the sushi restaurant in the area.   I have not tried any of the rolls here but I would come back and try something different.   I'm giving this place a 4."}
{"text":"The service is great! The sushi is  inexpensive and incredibly tasty."}
{"text":"We decided to jump around the north Charlotte area and try out some sushi places. This was our first stop and was prob the best out of the four places we tried. It was a sunday late afternoon so it was slow and quiet, kinda how we like it. The staff was very friendly and the sushi was fresh and yummy. We enjoyed the setting at the boardwalk and went for a stroll after eating our rolls. No issues.. This place was A-OK."}
{"text":"Pros- Located in a good location by the Boardwalk, beautiful and great for a night out or date night.

Cons-Sushi rolls are tiny and not worth the price you pay for! If you want quality sushi; this isn't the place to go."}
{"text":"First time there, nice staff. Summer roll was okay. I ordered sushi, it wasn't good. Cheap crab used in the rolls. The rolls had more rice than anything. If I ever go back it won't be for sushi."}
{"text":"I visited here a few days ago with a companion. I ordered one of their fried rolls and my partner had katsu chicken with glass noodles. I had a little bit of theirs and both meals were delicious.
Dessert was a bit disappointing. We had the green tea ice cream and fried bananas with vanilla ice cream. The bananas were fine, but both ice creams, the green tea in particular, just weren't that good. I got the impression that they were both made in house, which is fine, even desirable, but it tasted like too much matcha went into the green tea ice cream.
I definitely look forward to returning and trying their different rolls and noodles, but I'll be skipping dessert there."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is fantastic! Customer service is excellent and the food is outstanding! I go at least once a week on my break at work. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend eat here twice a month or so. Good m, genuine service. Food is also great, the calamari is amazing. We pretty much only eat sushi and calamari there, but it's always on point."}
{"text":"Was a great little sushi spot! Went at 7pm and got whisked right to a nice table by the window. Waitress was cheerful and quick. We got what we ordered in short time. Good was pretty amazing! The ginger dressing on the salad was super good and the portions of the squid salad was adequate and delicious. Raw fish slices were thick and fresh. Only had the summer roll was good but fell apart as we tried to eat it. But was still good. Will def come back!"}
{"text":"While Sushi 101 has good sushi and a really cool vibe, I would not recommend it. The service is consistently poor. I understand the occasional understaffed night with poor service but I have experienced this more times than I can even count. Living in the University area, you might be tempted to entertain the notion of Sushi 101 but I urge you to repress this urge. Drive about half an hour to Cornelius to experience Sushi At The Lake. 

If you are looking sushi to-go, give Sushi 101 a try. They also have good noodle bowls if you are a finicky eater and do not wish to partake in the sushi menu."}
{"text":"Love their house salad with ginger dressing. The dressing is on point. Whenever family comes in town this is where I take them. Great view, good friendly service and food is always very good. Best sushi in university area."}
{"text":"I visited this location expecting much better sushi than I received.  I ordered the dragon roll, caterpillar roll, bagel roll, and the professor.  They all seemed to taste the same event though they each had very different ingredients.   The deep fried bagel roll had to much tempura and didn't taste very good.   The fish seemed old and flavorless and didn't add anything to the sushi.   The service was really nice and it wasn't very busy when I went so that is why I give it a couple of stars.   I won't be returning here again though."}
{"text":"I'm giving this Sushi place only two stars. The food is avarage. The service is mediocre. You enter the place and you don't feel welcomed. The floors were dirty. The bathroom needed a good cleaning.  Our server was not attentive. The place was not full but our server seemed distracted.  He gave us two napkins for four people. I had to track him down for more napkins and again he drop off  two napkins for four and took off. I HAD TO ASK AGAIN for napkins and then he gave me only one. Why? Maybe they gave a headcount for the paper napkins to save the Planet? Who knows.  A little bit to expensive for California rolls, Asparagus rolls and very bad service. Here are some pics. Food looks better that it tastes. Plenty of better Sushi places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We live an hour away from here but decided to come eat today since the weather was nice. The food was okay but the service was super slow. Before we could even sit she was already rushing us for our drinks, but took about 10 minutes to bring it out. For appetizers we order crab ragoons and fried pork dumplings. The crab ragoons weren't all that but the pork dumplings we're pretty good. We ordered pho but didn't get any of the condiments, which we had to ask for. Disappointed because usually pho comes out steaming hot but this pho didn't. We didn't see any steam and the bowl was just warm to the touch. We had ordered rare on the side because we only like our meat slightly cooked and didn't receive it until 5-10 minutes after we received our pho. By that time our pho was already cold and the meat didn't even cook in our pho. We ran out of our drink and sat there for about 10-15 minutes for a refill while the waitress was walking back and forth. Wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends and was impressed with our meal, but not impressed with anything else.  Our calamari and tuna poke apps were completely delicious, reasonably portioned for the price, and really fresh.  I had some very nice nigiri, and my wife had a surf-and-turf roll.  All of our entrees were very good as well.  

The service, although friendly, was unprofessional, disorganized, and very very slow.  Having been a server and bartender, I saw that they were understaffed, but there were only 5 tables in the entire restaurant.  Food came out helter-skelter, our drinks were empty quite a bit of the time, we were forced to ask several times for silverware, and we could hear several arguments between staff members.  To top it all off, we were charged an automatic gratuity on a party of 6.  

I'll probably go back there because of it's location and the food, but I'll definitely be expecting poor service."}
{"text":"Being a waitress myself, I know how much it sucks for customers to come in last minute but my coworkers and I did just that. We came in 10 minutes before closing because we were starving and had sushi cravings and the servers were so nice. They didn't give us any attitude or any dirty looks and didn't even rush us. Ninja roll is definitely my favorite. I will definitely be back and not when they're about to close"}
{"text":"Love sushi is the best. I love all of their food. They work really hard to make everyone happy. But once in a while there an idiot like Gary and MV and Inchang Moses that can never be happy with anything.  Gary why don't you try to talk to the manager first before posting something stupid online.  Are you so anal that you just whine and complain out of the other end? you use to mouth to eat so don't spread bullshit out of it . If i was the owner of Love sushi I would post your picture at the front door and shove you face into it.  How about you guys be a better person and help the restaurant that does not measure up to your standard instead of whine about it like a bunch of idiots with no balls. if you wan perfection out of all the place you visit then offer a viable solution to the place you visit. I am sure they will appreciate all the help they can get.  why be a hater online and on yelp when you can make the world a better place to live. you guys obviously have a lot of time on hand so why not make better use it of instead of going online and complain about every idiotic thing. be a better man than just a stupid idiot that crave attention online."}
{"text":"Staff was excellent.

Sushi portions were fairly large.

It was decent.  Restrooms need serious work."}
{"text":"Great place in a great location. Love the indoor and outdoor seating. The food is always fresh and delicious. The menu has a wide range of prices so it's great if you're on a budget or want to go all out. I love that they offer more than just sushi. My boyfriend isn't too fond of sushi but he loves the ramen and salads here. The decor could use a bit of updating. The couches by the bar are a little worn and the tables seem older. The wait staff is always friendly, attentive and happy to answer any questions about the menu."}
{"text":"We ordered the Caterpillar, rock n roll, and professor roll. I got 2 pieces of salmon nigiri. My son got the chicken tempura and fried rice. Disappointed in everything, except my 2 year old's meal. My husband and I were fighting over who got to finish his food. For sushi, it's very cheap - however our bill was $39 and I am mad we didn't go to mcdonalds and get the $1 menu, since it was $39 of pure crap. 
I'd rather have gone to Taco Bell and crapped my pants for the next 3 days. 
The fish didn't have that nice fresh taste, and tasted reaally fishy (I know it's fish ). The rice was sour which ruined all of the rolls and my salmon nigiri. 
Avoid. Or go next door to the Vietnamese place... we realized as we left the sushi place that everyone was next door...."}
{"text":"I remember when this place when it was Sushi 101. I miss that. I'm not sure if they have new Management or rebranded or what but the quality has definitely gone down. It took ten minutes for a waitress to even get our drink orders and then it took another forty to get our food. The place wasn't even busy as only a few tables were occupied. Once received the sushi itself was good but the wait and service are awful."}
{"text":"The positives: the dirty martinis were good and service was good.

The negatives: sushi. It was pretty tasteless. And the restaurant was almost completely empty on a Sunday night at 7pm."}
{"text":"Ridiculously slow service where we were honestly just going to leave.  Once it finally came out the sushi was so-so at best.  I'd never go back."}
{"text":"The food is good. The service is hit or miss. If it's nice enough to eat on the patio, the pond and swans and ducks are decent entertainment to distract from the less than stellar service that inevitably happens outside. 

Lots of vegetarian sushi roll options, including a TEMPURA VEGETABLE ROLL that has onions, carrots, green peppers, broccoli and mushrooms. I order tempura onion only and it's amazing; like a bunch of onion rings inside the rice roll. 

Their VEGETABLE FRIED RICE is also nice. Lots of veggies included. 

SPICY TUNA ROLL contained a mashed paste of tuna instead of a nice chopped fish. Bit of a turnoff. The rice was nicely done this time. I've had sushi rolls here before where the rice is too mushy as well. This time the rice was right. 

EEL NIGIRI was good; as expected."}
{"text":"I've given the place several tries and I'm disappointed and underwhelmed every time.

If you order a basic roll i.e. spicy tuna or California roll you're safe, but their specialty rolls are a no go! Last time I visited with a friend we ordered two basic rolls and two specialty rolls. The ingredients in the specialty were unrecognizable!  The salmon was a blood red color and there was something in one of the rolls that looked like liver...still not sure what it was suppose to be! We actually sent our food back and went to Chick-fil-a.

 If you must eat here keep your order simple."}
{"text":"I usually love this restaurant, the food is always good, and service is adequate if slow sometimes. Today was the worst as far as service is concerned. 

We waited a good ten minutes before someone came to get our drink order, and then maybe 15 minutes before flagging another server down to place our order. And they've decided to roll out a new ordering system and haven't gotten the kinks out yet. A holiday is a bad time to change your POS system. 

Service was disjointed and very slow. I am not sure they actually had a floor plan for who served what tables. Hopefully today was an anomaly!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly mediocre. Nothing about this resaurant really jumps out at you, but somehow that's just fine. The decor is comfortable and unobtrusive, the waitstaff polite, and the sushi fresh and surprisingly filling. If you are looking for an exceptional culinary experience you won't find it here (you wouldn't be looking at chain restaurants in a University City stripmall anyway), but for an enjoyable and affordable lunch with friends or coworkers Sushi 101 is a safe bet."}
{"text":"Came into restaurant with very little people in it and they wanted to sit us at a small table. I then asked for a bigger table and they refused to set us at one saying policy said it was reserved for four people only. When I said I didn't want to sit at a small table we left. I would understand if the place was packed but there was hardly anyone in the place. We have never had a problem before but it has now become one. I had an operation on my arm and didn't want to be bumped . The place isn't that good. But we liked the people until now. When your policy comes over customer satisfaction there is a problem. !!!"}
{"text":"Great selection of sushi. I really enjoyed the Crispy Cali and Cajun egg rolls. The outdoor patio is nice but could use a few more tiki torches which may help control the bugs. I spent more time than I would like swatting bugs. Likely a result of. Wong close to the lake. However, it a great space to dine and people watch along the boardwalk. 

This was a first visit. I will give Love Sushi another try and update my review."}
{"text":"I love this place! There is a variety of food from Sushi, hibachi and even Pho! I had their small bowl of Phi Tai and it was so good. I also had a spicy Tuna roll and it was very tasty too. Prices are not bad and there is a lot of outdoor and indoor seating."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my sushi and the service was good. I got the light rail roll and added tobiko for a slight upcharge. At first I was slightly annoyed that they wanted to charge to add it but once I saw ever they piled it on, I didn't mind at all! My roll was delicious! Note: I had Tobiko added after the pic was taken."}
{"text":"After  coming to this restaurant periodically  because it has fairly decent sushi ( not great but  better than most in this area),  we finally have to admit to ourselves it has gone way down hill -- especially the service .   We went there  mid-afternoon yesterday and  the waitress took our drink order. Well, first she  said \"welcome to THE NAME OF ANOTHER PLACE!\".     After a considerable wait (there were only six other people there at that hour), she came back to take our order. I asked where our drinks were and she apologized. People want at least water while they are looking at the menu. Anyway, she brings me regular tea when I ordered GREEN tea -- hello, it's a Japanese restaurant.   I could see our order up at the sushi counter   and she didn't even go up to check on it.  The sushi chef kept ringing the bell for her. I almost wanted to go up and get it myself.  She brings  the first part of our order and then she brings my companion's  - -he ordered mackerel and she brought him tuna!  It's as if she never worked in an Asian restaurant before!   Last, but not least, she brings us our check  and didn't even ask if we wanted anything else. We did but at that point, we gave up, paid the bill, and left.  WORST SERVICE EVER!!! Not going back."}
{"text":"First time at this place today. We got drinks and waitress never came back. After 15 mins we paid for or drinks and left. Told someone on the way out that we were leaving because of the lack of service and they just laughed. The waitress never apologized just took our money for the drinks and walked away saying that she would have left too. We went to Ishi Japanese Restaurant on University City Blvd instead. Much better."}
{"text":"Everything was pretty terrible. The sushi was overpriced,cheap quality, and not tasty at all. Needless to say I won't be going back. The service was the worst! My food took forever even though there were only 2 tables other than mine. I wanted to order another till but she never asked and just randomly brought my check. They brought me one water the whole time I was there. My throat was super dry as I was eating and my server was nowhere to be found. In the bathroom they had ran out of soap and paper towels. You're better off buying Harris teeter sushi than coming here."}
{"text":"I've given this place 3 chances and was disappointed every time! This is NOT good sushi! A classic California roll doesn't even have all 3 proper ingredients! This sushi is sub-par and they should've paid ME to eat it! The sushi was sloppy, poorly presented, falling apart, cut unevenly!  I won't be back! 3 strikes and you're out!!!!"}
{"text":"I order take out from here every couple weeks. A big kahuna, small edamame and house salad is my typical meal. The sushi is always good. My husband has had mixed experience with their other entrees but it's a decent sushi joint. It's quick and easy and you can sit on the patio and look out over the water. A great summertime hang."}
{"text":"Not as good, as used to be. When they changed from Sushi 101 their food has changed for the worse. They have pictures on their menu, and letters for u to pick from for your meal. Got real cheesy"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, the service was mediocre, and my vodka tonic seemed to be devoid of vodka."}
{"text":"The service is great! Their sushi is not the best sushi I've had, but it was still good. The decor is cute except the seats in the booths are ripped and it could be a little cleaner."}
{"text":"Idk why this place doesnt have 5 stars. Everything was really good. Reasonable prices, great sushi and service. What else can you ask for?? Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"I agree with Alese B. (below)

Great place to go during warm months.  The outside seating overlooks the lake and the inside has big comfy couches.  Sushi is basic, actually a good thing for sushi amateurs.  Best time to go is on Mondays, they have $2 martinis.

Not a place for sushi \"connoisseurs.\"  There are better places for sushi I'm sure."}
{"text":"The restaurant is nicely set up, nothing upscale. Food is moderately priced. If you are looking to try several roles, be prepared to pay $20+ a person. The staff was very nice and attentive, however the kitchen staff was not. 1/2 of my order was brought out. Once I ate that, 15 mins later my other 1/2 came out. The taste was great, everything seemed fresh. I did not mention the wait, there was no need or excuse. There were only 6 customers in the restaurant. I would recommend this place a light lunch, my wife said the wait was unusual, as she is a frequent customer. Will I go back, yes."}
{"text":"Sushi and pho were plain. Very little meat and veggies in the pho. The pho's broth tasted like it was just reheated broth with no flavor or seasoning. The waitresses and waiters were all just standing around at the bar messing around with each other instead of refilling drinks. Will not return."}
{"text":"Great conversation areas with deep, sunken couches contribute to the loungey-vibe you get when you arrive at Sushi 101.  I'm not as adventurous as I once was when it comes to raw fish, so I generally stick to the rolls, and I haven't had a bad one yet.  With that said, this is not the same caliber of sushi you will find out of the city, say in HI, but it's fresh- It's just that something is missing...

There's typically a sparse crowd, so I'm surprised it's stayed open as long as it has.  The service has been hit or miss on my last few visits, but I'm always pleasantly surprised to find great big stiff drink specials.  Get sauced and then walk over the boardwalk for some different scenery."}
{"text":"10 minutes at our table with no acknowledgement from the wait staff - not even an \"i'll be with you in a moment\". One of those experiences that will never be repeated - at least not at this place since we won't be back. Major fail on a basic of the business."}
{"text":"Nice location but this was some of the worst sushi I have ever had. I called in an order at 445 on a fri. The woman who answered the phone was very pleasant, even when I got there as well. I ordered a shrimp tempura, spider and cali roll.  The rice for all of my rolls was HOT. When I got home I had to put my whole dish into the fridge to chill it down a bit. Moreover, half of my rolls were poorly made and falling apart. The place was EMPTY when I arrived so I know that it wasn't a matter of time or short- staffed. Harris teeter serves better sushi to be honest."}
{"text":"Awesome service, sushi and sake bombs! We went there for date night and it was in a great location on the water!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I was seriously disappointed with my meal at Love Sushi.  I ordered the beef and shrimp teriyaki plate which was $16 (rounding off). At first I was surprised when she didn't ask how I'd like the meet cooked but I just thought they cook one way however when it came out is was pink in the middle. I mean it was not slightly pink but just way to pink and no flavor. It made me gag. The broccoli was hard as a rock. The fried ice had nothing but a little bit of egg and rice, that's all. I also order shrimp tempura rolls and I found it strange that it had nothing but fried shrimp. When I asked the waitress she said yea they make theirs plain. Hmm, I wouldn't name it shrimp tempura if it isn't your normal one. My mother ordered spider roll and it made us sick to our stomach. Honestly for the price you are paying the food is just to plain and no flavor. I won't be eating here again, I'm sorry. The waitress was attentive at least."}
{"text":"I ordered a bowl of pho and let me just start off by saying how the vegetables such as the bean sprout and the mints were completely not even fresh and they were too soft! Almost as if they have left it out for too long. The pho on the other hand, I would not recommend because the noodles kept breaking off, and I had more soup than I had noodles in my pho. Don't get me wrong! I love the atmosphere of this place and the sushi is decent but the pho.. I wouldn't recommend :("}
{"text":"Affordable, good sushi in a clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"The prices are reasonable and the food is above average. With you of the lake is nice also. I have however consistently found be sushi rice to be mushy"}
{"text":"When my friend and I first walked in we noticed food and a little trash on the floor.  Well, I figured a large group left out and they hadn't got to it yet.  While we were standing there waiting to be taken to our table, I watched the greeter clean out table off then she sat us at the table....which was wet.  I don't mean wet, I mean wet like she didn't wring the cloth out.  Fish eggs were scattered on the table and my seat.  One of the seat had a puddle of water in it.  I then attempted to fetch a rag to do what she thought she did and another staff member asked if he could help me so I told him about our disappointment.  Well, he told the same person and she kinda fixed it...of course she left fish eggs on the table.....of course.  The waitress did not know the menu...of course!  Of course she didn't!  The food was mmmm ok.  The wasabi looked beat up and while we were eating the kitchen staff began bringing out the days trash THROUGH the dining area!  I asked my friends if they had a back door at their homes, and they advised that they did.  Of course!  Of course they have a back door....so Sushi 101 why not use yours.  Tell a manager....I figure he/she's running the joint and surely they see what I'm seeing.  Attitude reflects leadership....."}
{"text":"Don't Patronize this place we waited for hour. We asked for a discount our meal should of free or at least discount. They said no so we walked out"}
{"text":"Not too much room to complain with their crazy martini specials ($2) and reasonably priced sushi.  It isn't where I go when I want super high quality sushi but it can feed my addition just A-OK.  The outside patio is just gorgeous.  It is a great spot to watch people walk around the boardwalk or watch paddle boaters on in the...pond..river?  Not sure, but it's water !  The service isn't outstanding.  Especially on nights where they have the great specials, the wait for drinks can get long.  That being said though, if you go in with plenty of time, and want a place that's easy on the wallet with a great view - give it a try!"}
{"text":"The sushi was ok but on the pricey side. The service was extremely slow. Although we had a large group (8 people) it took us 2 hours to have lunch."}
{"text":"Solid 4 here!  Great sushi!  Take a look a pic 9, that was my plate.  Great presentation and ultra fresh sushi.  Service with a smile, the staff did a great job handling a surprisingly large lunch crowd.  For 7 bucks, we got a spider roll and california roll.  The spider roll was soft shell crab, it was delish!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place out for the first time in need of a Pho fix. At first I was a bit apprehensive to try the Pho here, especially with it being a Japanese restaurant, but to my surprise, the Pho was DELICIOUS! I'm very picky about my Pho, most especially that I come from California and I KNOW what delicious and authentic Pho tastes like...and this place just about came pretty close to a familiar place I like to go to back home in CA. 

I ordered the beef brisket, beef shank, and tendon (i think) soup, and it was really good! One thing my friend and I noticed though was that the chili sauce wasn't very spicy, and if you like your soup spicy, you really had to pack in that spice, also the broth was a bit too beefy and strong  and kinda too salty for my liking of a beef soup, but it was still tasty. That could've probably been one of the reasons why the spice from chili sauce and Siracha wouldn't come through? (idk, who really knows). We also ordered the summer rolls (in other places theyre called spring rolls, which are the fresh rolls with shrimp) and those were good as well, and their peanut sauce was SO good, and we also ordered the tempura tofu, which were good as well, which was served with the side of tempura sauce which i didn't care for much and with sweet chili sauce which tasted a lot better with this dish. 

Overall, the service at this place was great, everyone was really friendly and efficient.  The restaurant itself was fairly good priced and also very clean! 

Next time I come here I definitely want to try the sushi here too...But for now, I'm happy with the Pho! ....Too bad it's an hour and half away from where I live, but I guess I wouldn't mind the drive when I'm already in the area."}
{"text":"Sushi 101 can be very good with unusual yummy rolls and good service.  It can also be not so good with sushi rolled so loosely the fall apart and inconsistent counts (6 vs 8 pieces). I would go back and hope for the best."}
{"text":"Not one of the better sushi places I've been to (but then again, we're comparing North Carolina sushi to California sushi).  The place was pretty much dead when me and 3 other coworkers came in at lunch time.  I was in Charlotte on business and this was the closest sushi restaurant to our office.

We started off with edamame which was a really generous portion.  I noticed the menu had pho which was interesting because I'd never been to a sushi spot that also served pho. They had many rolls on their lunch menu but unfortunately no pictures.  I ended up with the Rising Sun Roll which is tuna, crab & shrimp rolled with tobiko, topped with Japanese mayo.  Unfortunately, this turned out to be very bland with barely any japanese mayo on top. 

Service was on point though.  And the restaurant setting is nice.  It's right at the boardwalk of a man-made lake.  Unfortunately the food was not very satisfying and I probably won't be back next time I'm in Charlotte for work."}
{"text":"4 stars because our server was awesome!! I love the location this place is in, the boardwalk(: Their menu is so HUGE, they had a variety of food between pho, noodles, fried rice, and lots of sushi!! We ordered about 8 different types of sushi, all was very good. The sushi rice was good- very important! Although the raw fish that came with the sushi I didn't really like, it wasn't as fresh & it was kinda chewy and hard to eat! One of my fav sushi, forgot the name was wrapped in rice paper I never had that before as a sushi so that was interesting(: Our server was so friendly, and very attentive so thank you!!"}
{"text":"one dollar pieces....the salmon is the best in town...pillowy soft goodness.... i am obsessed!!! i also love the scallop/bacon skewers."}
{"text":"The sushi here is awesome. The food and drinks are cheap. Great staff. It's my go to for sushi in the university area."}
{"text":"This is my spot to relax, drink hot sake and eat a roll of sushi after work. This restaurant is Vietnamese owned and is very clean. The pho is good but the portions are relatively small. The service is great."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful and the presentation was great. I wish I would have taken a picture but it was so good we ate all of it before I even thought about it. We started off with the crab ragoons and then had the surf and turf roll, the big kahuna roll, the panhandle roll, and the love sushi roll. They were all really good, mine and my husbands favorite was the surf and turf. On top of the food being very good the atmosphere was perfect. We sat on the patio which is next to the walk way and water. Definitely relaxing after a long day of work. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I wish I was able to leave negative stars! Terrible experience! Will NEVER go back! Had 1 waitress with no assistance for a party of 14. Alcoholic drinks were warm and not made properly. It took an hour and a half to get our  food. We were told that there was a language barrier. Food came out in spurts and incorrect.  Stir fry dishes were lukewarm and looked like they had been sitting. Sushi wasn't rolled tightly and fell apart. Plastic was found in 2 of the dishes. The waitress didn't get assistance from the kitchen while bringing out dishes. There was NO accountability by management after several people voiced concern & dissatisfaction of service and food. The manager only came out to make sure we paid for our food then he said that our waitress would have to pay out of her pocket for the incorrect food. Never again."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and don't ever go to this place. Service sucked, and the food was even worse. My waitresses food (who was eating her zaxbys near us at a table looked better) take it from her, go to zaxbys instead. Manager was a prick too. Great way to greet customers. Look at us and turn around and keep talking to some other employee."}
{"text":"The sushi here taste good, but their portions were small and the interior needs updating. The laminate on our table was peeling off the edge and the place just looks old and dingy like it needs a remodel, but the quality of the food was tip top."}
{"text":"The sushi tasted good and I was still healthy 24 hours later.  So, win, I guess?  This place is...passable.  The sushi is several notches above the grocery store and they have some interesting rolls.  You can even find a few without cream cheese (blasphemy, IMO) or chili sauce.  I will go here if I need to have a meal out in the University area, and it's nice to sit outside in the right season.  However, I went here for lunch the other day and the service sucked.  The waitress forgot part of everyone's order and had to be sent back several times to get forgotten or mistaken items.  Water and tea weren't refilled even though we were looking around thirstily.  The table we were seated at was wet and a little sticky.   Pretty sketchy..."}
{"text":"It's a nice little sushi spot tucked away by the lake. It wasn't a big crowd in so we were seated quickly. The staff was prompt with refills and bringing our food. The sushi and fried rice was amazing. I would definitely recommend Love Sushi ssoooo sooo good.  The fried rice had a good amount of ingredients and they weren't stingy on the shrimp. I can't remember the exact name of the sushi we had. We also had the apple saké which was good."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night; there was no wait, service was very quick and food was good and affordable. Really enjoyed the location and experience."}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero star if I had the option. By far the worst sushi restaurant in Charlotte! I got food poisoning after eating their sushi!!!! Hamachi Kama was small and dry. Ahi poki was rudimentary and bland. My ticket was more than $80 bucks but I enjoyed none of it! I will never come back!"}
{"text":"Ate here on 4/19/13 with girlfriend, had different kinds of sushi, both of us ended up with severe food poisoning. Was the most sick I have ever been in my life. Had not eaten anything that day so absoltely positive this was the cause as was she. Called and spoke with manager who told me to come in for refund. Went in and was told by owner she would not give me refund unless I had hospital report. She was rude and they completely did not care about my wellbeing or making this right. Do NOT GO. DISGUSTING."}
{"text":"About the quality of Harris tweeter. Not bad but not good enough to want it again. I had the rainbow roll so this just speaks to that."}
{"text":"I enjoy this restaurant because they have decent priced, yummy sushi that's close to work. My only complaint is that sometimes when trying to get my check, the service can be a little slow due to staff trying to help other customers. Otherwise, the staff is super friendly! They also charge for soda water so be advised! Overall great place with delicious sushi."}
{"text":"Ok where to start!! I love sushi but not from here..I always order tempura shrimp roll but something about theirs didn't taste right .the veggie tempura was the best I ever tasted..I just may give them a second chance so I can have more veggie tempura!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely starving on my first day in Charlotte, and wanted to order everything on the menu (100's of items). They have too much on the menu ranging from sushi, pho, spring rolls, to fried rice. Settled on a rainbow roll, 2 pieces of salmon sashimi, and calamari. As well as 2 glasses of sauvignon blanc.

The calamari came out first, and it had a nice seasoning and spicy mayo. The rainbow roll was decent, but the salmon sashimi was a bit stringy. 

Service was okay, our waitress wasn't super attentive although it was pretty empty. Would come back if I really need a sushi fix."}
{"text":"Great sushi at reasonable prices. Lots of menu options for those who are not into sushi. Good location"}
{"text":"Truly some of the most mediocre sushi we've ever had. The place was dirty, service was just okay. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Charlottes best kept secret for sushi. The nigiri and sashimi is fresh and reasonable priced. Staff is friendly and the view of the boardwalk is really nice. Get the Queen Roll. Its delicious and kind of reminds me of fried chicken lol."}
{"text":"this place is a JOKE. Coming from someone who has had great sushi, this place is just...the pits. The roll I had was blegh; the portion was tiny; it was simply overpriced and it wasn't all that damn good. Most unauthentic place ever. Riddle me this: WHY would a sushi place just hand you FORKS to dine with!?!??! I know how to use chop sticks. AND THEN when I went to go use my chopsticks, they broke. Worthless piece of crap is a reflection of this restaurant. I'm disgusted."}
{"text":"Stopped in while shopping in the area and I'm glad I did. Nice little place, near the man made pond, would be cool to sit out on the porch when its nice out. I got the professor roll and it was excellent, fresh, and pretty! I really liked how they offer half rolls, thats something I hadn't seen before. I know sometimes I can't finish 2 rolls but I want variety so thats a cool option. I hope they have some weekly specials because I would love to come back and bring my Fiancé!"}
{"text":"I just ordered takeout, and delivery from postmastes. I asked for Wasabi on the rice for the nigiri, but a side of steamed rice was charged instead. In addition, the sushi chef must not know how to roll sushi (the avocado slices were just tossed on top of my half roll, instead of formed with the roll tightly), because my avocado slices fell off just in time for me to see that there were pieces of hair on the rice of last two pieces of the roll. Which gives me the idea that I have probably already devoured hair on the previous pieces. I've only been to this place once before it was Love Sushi, and it was bad. I figured, why not give it a second shot? Wrong again. All I know is, I won't stick around to find out what happens a 3rd time. You have been warned."}
{"text":"The service is terrible and the sushi isn't good enough to compensate for it. Every time I have gone the order of at one of the people at the table was incorrect. The staff didn't check back but 3 times for the entire hour that we were there and I had to run my own food back because it was wrong. Even though it wrong twice, I gave up. It wasn't worth the hassle. I wouldn't go there if there were a decent place closer that I could talk my friends to change to because they still like going there for some reason...

AMENDMENT: I have returned via the request of a close friend and the results were much improved. I found the food was better prepared and the service very friendly. Thanks for the improvement!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. My fiance and I used to go here all the time. Too bad I don't live in Charlotte anymore. This was definitely one of my more favorite restaurants. 

The ambience inside is nice. The staff are friendly and I always get prompt service. The price is great, very affordable for college students since it's in the university area. It's in a great location too...on warm days, you can sig outside while overlooking the lake. 

My favorite: crispy California roll!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually in University Area these days so on a recent return I was surprised to find that Sushi 101 is now a cheesily-named \"Love Sushi\". Whatevs, let's check it out. Quality has come down from what bit Sushi 101 had back in the day.

There's definitely a lot of selection, though some parts of the menu can be confusing. The raw fish isn't top quality stuff and I've had better for similar prices. I didn't find their menu to be particularly cheap either, unlike some other reviews. As I said though, lots of selection. They seem to know their stuff when it comes to real Japanese food. It's not all just hibachi chicken and rice. There's gyouza, edamame, lots of sake options, *real* sushi and sashimi (as close as you can get here), chicken katsu style and the various noodles.

Our server was super polite and friendly, smiling the entire time. However, it seemed like he was the only person running the tables and he was a bit flustered with 4-5 tables seated. The sushi chef was also friendly, though we didn't sit at the bar. In the end though, it's not a place I would specifically single out for a return visit."}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi restaurant. Came her with my bf for the first time and absolutely loved it. I had the raising sun sushi roll and the Cajun egg rolls for an appetizer oh and a wonton soup! I don't like wonton soup and this one was amazing. The waiter recommended it when I asked for clear soup and they didn't have it. Waiter was nice and friendly.  I will be back when I come back to charlotte."}
{"text":"Visiting from NYC :) So I came here for a mini weekend vacation with my boyfriend and friends. We were exploring around the area and came to this restaurant for lunch. I'm a sushi lover and I have tried many different types of rolls from different states/countries and in my opinion, the sushi here is decent. Not the best but it's still good. The thing I like most about this place is that they have a variety of options in their menu to accommodate just about everyone. Typically sushi restaurants either offer just sushi and tempuras or just sushi, tempuras and hibachi dishes but this one really impressed me because it included sushi, tempura, hibachi and Vietnamese food. Our waitress was really nice but our food took a while to get to our table. The prices are fair (around $10 - $13 per roll depending on the type of roll you get) but keep in mind that if you have a party of 6 or more people, an 18% gratuity is automatically added to your bill whether or not you decide to split the check."}
{"text":"We went here for a late dinner. It was practically empty so we were seated right away. The water is good-I like to mention that since I am picky about water from restaurants. I had the small pho and it was the perfect portion. My husband had the crispy California roll and it was so delicious. I would be back because the prices are good, but the service was not very good. I think the waitress was having a bad night so I will make sure to try them out again!"}
{"text":"There are several redeeming qualities of this otherwise run of the mill sushi bar. First, the location. Sushi 101 is right on the boardwalk and has an outdoor patio overlooking the lake (and during the summer has a nice view of the open air concerts on Thursday nights). Inside is comfortable and has a nice lounge environment. Second, they offer moderately priced fare that delivers exactly what I would expect, decent, though not great ,Sushi rolls. I have to admit that as this was my first visit I played it safe will Dragon and California Rolls so I couldn't give advice beyond that.

I agree with the other reviewers that the service isn't great... but if your like me and just want a quick sushi fix... this is a good spot."}
{"text":"Never again will I go back to this Sushi 101. I went for lunch, the manager seated me and I waited 20 minutes JUST for someone to take down what I wanted to drink. I watched waitresses seat other people, clean tables, tend to other customers but not once asked me what I wanted to drink. Finally a waitress asks me what I want to drink, she brings it to me and walks right away. So after waiting 20 minutes for a drink nobody asks what I want to eat? So I go to the manager and ask him if anyone is going to ask me what I would like to eat, he tells the same exact waitress and she comes over to me at the second and takes my order, rudely might I add. When I get my food she asks if I need anything, I didnt even have napkins at my table so she goes and gets the napkins and throws them at me. At that point I politely walked out. I have always been a Sushi 101 fan but no longer at this location. No wonder the owner sold this location, its trash! NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Had to give it one more go after the owner messaged me. I love to see a owner stick behind his restraunt and he came through. It must of been a off night the last time. I did not tell my server about my last issue or comped tab untill the end to really see if they fixed the issues and they did. Server was on point sushi was fresh. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"How are you out of tofu for the miso soup? Ugh! The sushi is a little on the pricey side (at least a dollar more per roll than similar places) but it's the only sushi spot on the boardwalk so I've been here more times than was warranted by the quality of the sushi."}
{"text":"Good basic sushi.  Not alot of selection to choose from.  Good place if you just have a quick sushi craving.  However there are much better sushi places in Charlotte that will give you more selection and more for your money.  Nice atmosphere on the lake- making it a good date spot- especially during warm months."}
{"text":"I can't remember the day of the week, but they have one day with $2 martinis! Sushi here is pretty good. In my opinion you can get a lot of sushi for a reasonable price. 

They have nice outdoor seating with a good view over the pond. The only downside to eating here is the service. Every time I eat here the servers are neither attentive or friendly... 4 stars if they fixed that."}
{"text":"I had already heard about this place from a friend. They weren't good things. So I didn't eat there till now though it's been years since my wife and I started going to Boardwalk Billy's and Lengs which are just across a small bridge.

The lady serving us was nice and polite. He mudslide I ordered and the spring roll app was okay too. But the problem was the Crispy tuna roll. The roll had a good size chunk of tuna but it didn't taste good to me. I know sushi. I'm sure it could have been the guy who was on shift.

And then the interior. It was not exaxtly what we are used to. It looks more like a Pho place. Price was reasonable. The tuna role was under $10, and the mudslide was $5 and some cents. So it wasn't bad.

That's my review. Hope it helps!"}
{"text":"Loved this place, the food tastes good and especially the hospitality was there with a welcome from the waiters. Location is also nice to have food with your loved ones."}
{"text":"We got take out from here at 10pm and took it to a nearby wine bar. It was both beautifully presented and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great sushi rolls and service when I went here. The location is gorgeous as this area has a man made lake behind it. 

** The fact that I've had better sushi and service at other places give this a four instead of five."}
{"text":"Honestly not a fan. I didn't however order sushi, but they have a lot on their menu besides that. I ordered a noodle bowl with stir fried udon noodles & katsu style tofu (which the waitress recommended both). The tofu was horrible! I'm used to small crunchy cubes on tofu in my dishes and this was huge hunks of \"wet\", mushy tofu and a semi mushy/fried coating! Gross!!!!! The noodles didn't have any flavor. I mentioned it to the waitress, but she did nothing about it and also forgot my hot sauce, so I couldn't even dress it up.  The curry shrimp appetizer was the only good item. 

I was extra hungry when I left & disappointed to pay nearly $30 (with drinks). I don't recommend getting any other the other dishes besides sushi. My friend's steak was not good either, although her lobster was decent.  I don't even feel like I'd be back to try the sushi at this point. Perhaps if they would've been a bit more accommodating or caring about my nasty water logged/half fried tofu cut into giant pieces bigger than a dish sponge.  No thanks."}
{"text":"I didn't complain,  just got my check, paid and left.  If I have nothing to say,  it's unfixable.   Left my tempura,  crab Rangoon and sushi on the table.   I tried and it all failed.  I will not need chapstick for a month... Tempura I tasted was that greasy...Sushi was falling apart and tasted rank.   What's really bad was noone even asked why my food wasn't eaten.  They didn't care!"}
{"text":"Waited outside for 15min waiter never came by. We left and never came back. The waiter walked by once but didn't stop our table and it seemed like he was only concerned with one table and not any of other he was supposed to be serving."}
{"text":"Great spot for sushi lovers!!!!  Good service, fresh sushi cooked or raw.  The best thing is their prices.  It's a cute date spot as well."}
{"text":"Gotta be the worst sushi I've ever had, and I've eaten sushi I've found in my car before.

The service was good, slow, but good. The restaurant itself was cozy, comfortable, great views. 

The California roll was messy, and just blah. The teriyaki tuna was over cooked, almost to the point that the tuna was crunchy. Salad was almost frozen and watery. And I never got my yakitori. 

Two stars because the location and the restaurant itself are great, and the staff had potential - somewhere deep down. But the food was freakin' awful."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. We came on Tuesday 1-17-2017 At 10 pm after being stuck in charlotte for a while. We googled to see what time the establishment closed and saw it was 10:30- seeing how they're usually quick and you're in and out we came in. We were greeted by a guy who was playing on his phone who said \" wow everyone wants to eat late tonight- you better choose your meals quickly!\" He stood there for a minute hoping we'd leave- which I suggested, then seated us. We noticed another couple had just got there and just ordered. It was 5 minutes before someone took our DRINK order (even though they were in SUCH a rush) I ordered a martini and our waitress says to the bartender \"they've ordered a drink\" to which the bartender loudly groaned \" UGHHH\" and slammed a bottle down. She said I'm sorry to the bartender. Our food arrived and we finished at 10:35. Five minutes passed closing. As a business owner having customers means I am in business, and that people in a way- need what I have to offer. When we are the reason you have a job, don't complain. There were 4 dirty tables upon entering the building yet everyone stood around on their phones, complaining about having to DO THEIR JOB. 

We went to pay and the same rude guy who greeted us sat there on his phone when we tried to pay him. 

Go Literally ANYWHERE ELSE and you will have better food and service."}
{"text":"I've been a long time customer at love sushi, but after today, I won't be coming back. What really ruined the experience for us was our server, Anna. 

It was clear from the beginning that she had no interest in serving our table as she came to check on us a total of 0 times. 

We saw her once at the beginning when she took our order. And at the very end, when I had to call her over for a check.

I wouldn't have had a problem if the restaurant was busy and she was swarmed with tables, but the restaurant wasn't busy at all.

If you would have sat with us, it would have been pretty clear that she was treating us differently from her other tables.

Servers play an important role as the \"face\" and brand of every restaurant. When you have a server like Anna who makes you feel avoided, unimportant, and like you don't belong, it's reason enough to never come back."}
{"text":"Alright at best staff wasn't very helpful and food took along time for no one to be there..."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible service. Waited 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us. The place looked messy with dirty tables that were not cleared. Rag was laying on the table with a spray bottle next to our table. 
The light fixture above us was dirty and debris was literally falling on us while we sat there. Waitress forgot about us several times. Asked for things. Never got them. Didn't even acknowledge that she had not brought things to the table. Owner seemed to be present, but only worried about tending to the drawer. 
While we were there another couple who had been waiting got up and left. We should have done the same. In the end we wasted $60 and will not return. 
The food was mediocre. The teriyaki had no flavor and was bland. One positive. They use romaine in the salad, not iceberg lettuce."}
{"text":"It's ok. The Lava roll I had was good but my rock and roll was simply Ok. This place isn't bad just nothing too exceptional about it. Just a run of the mill sushi spot. I'd come back because of proximity."}
{"text":"I have had better sushi and at more affordable price. I just wanted to try something near my house. But the food is good and if you have the view its good."}
{"text":"Very affordable and delicious. I came to dine in between the lunch and dinner hour around 3 pm & has the Philly Roll & the Crunchy California Roll - simply delicious! Great laid back atmosphere, clean and orderly with excellent service from wait staff. Sushi chef is friendly and entertaining. Great product for the money. I spent less than $15 & walked away VERY happy & hunger sated."}
{"text":"I liked it. It's weird tho. sushi place, no bento boxes but phö? The crunchy roll was delish, edamame was too. Teriyaki plates were tasty. Pay the extra 2 buck to upgrade to fried rice. Yeahhh.  Service was ok but slow. Priced right. I'd go again."}
{"text":"Was in the area for work (visiting from San Francisco) and stepped in here for a late lunch and was pleasantly surprised! Had spicy edamame and two rolls which were delicious. Would definitely come again if in the area and try more. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I tried the Yaki Bowl and it was delicious. There was so much flavor in the bowl!

Chicken Yaki had so much flavor! Its certainly a must try; however, I'd opt for grilled shrimp instead of chicken. We also tried the fried sweet potatoes, which were pretty good as well.

I love their batter; it's lite. I've tried several Tempuras; however, none are as lite as this - which I love! I felt satisfied instead of fat after eating the Calamari, Shrimp Tempura, and Chicken  .

Most of the previous reviews state their service was bad. Luckily, our service was pretty nice! Perhaps because it was a slow night. Either way, dinner was yummy and filling. Our server was pleasant and our bill was reasonably priced (approx. $35 total for everything we ordered).

We also scored a nice patio seat beside the pond. Score for our date night!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's in the University Area on the boardwalk so it's a great place to come, walk and shop, then stop in for a bite to eat.  I have two favorite spots to sit when I come here.  One is outside on the patio overlooking the water, but only when it's nice outside.  The second is on the big comfortable black leather couches.  Each couch can hold three people easily with more than enough elbow room to spare.

I brought the \"BF\" here.  Well it was kinda a set up.  I really wanted some Sweet Potatoe Yakitori and this shopping center has a Michael's Craft so I told him that I needed some glue dots for class and this way we can be conviently here to stop in and grab a bite...so glad this worked :)

He ordered the Beef Ribs which we could hear sizziling from behind the counter.  It came witha side of white rice and a sald.  I ended up eating the salad b/c it had a ginger based dressing on top and he really couldn't get into it...but to me it was delicious!  I should start out by saying that we also ordered an appitizer; can't remember the name but it was sweet peppers, stuffed with cream cheese and crab meat, and then deep fried; served with a sweet and sour sauce.  OMG!  These were so good, will definitley have to try these again.  I ordered my Sweet Potatoe Yakitori, which is sliced sweet potatoes and flashed fried in tempura batter; served with a brown sauce.  If you've never had these...try it.  Their good but also a great way not to over eat since sweet potatoe  is full of fiber and will fill you up quickly and at $3.00 you really can't beat it.  I also ordered a fried California Roll and a Southpark Maki which is shrimp, crab snow pea salad, and cucumber.  We were stuffed and I was pretty surprised that the BF took a liking to the Sweet Potatoe Yakitori and even tried on of my Fried California Rolls :)

I've been here multiple times and the food to me is always consistently on point!"}
{"text":"Alwayz great service. cool young wait staff and sushi couln't get better."}
{"text":"Came here to relax on the patio and enjoy sushi. Enjoyed my afternoon people watching on the boardwalk. As well as listening to the ducks and fountains. The lunch menu is it very reasonable and having the option to order half rolls gives you the ability to try a few different things. The miso soup is awesome, very silky. I also had the the Shrimp Tempura roll, Salmon Skin roll, and Crawfish roll. They were all very good.

The service was excellent and they seem to use a team approach with the host assisting the server. They were very accommodating when I requested an iced green tea (they normally serve it hot, but it was a warm day) and I was sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I'm never going back there. My co-worker & I went there for lunch because we had a coupon. It was a buy one get one coupon. We repeatedly asked the waitress if we could use it & about what we could order. She assured us that we could use it. When it came time for the checks we were informed that we couldn't use the coupon because one of us got the special. There wasn't anything stated on the coupon saying that we couldn't do that. We decided to let that slide b/c they were going to still take half of one of our meals. Then they came back AGAIN & said they couldn't accept the coupon at all. In the end we had to both pay full price. They were extremely rude & not helpful. I guess they don't want us to come back. They obviously don't care about their customers. Plus the sushi wasn't all that great & we had to wait forever."}
