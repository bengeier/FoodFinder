{"text":"This is my second time here, the 1st being a few years ago, and I don't know why it took me so long to return because the food was ssooo good.  By a recommendation from someone else's review I read on here, I got the mutton biyaani which was amazing. I also got the chetinnad chicken, which I didn't love because there were only 3 pieces in it and 2 of the bigger pieces we mostly none, not worth the $12! Got a popular mutton dish, but don't remember the name, it was the 1st one on the mutton list. Also got garlic butter naan which was so buttery and delicious. I'm stuffed!  The service was also quickly and friendly.  Was in and out within an hour on a Sunday evening.  Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Went there for friday dinner.  Loved it so much came back for lunch the next day.  The name of the food are long and hard to pronounce so I won't even try and butcher it.  But try the shrimp and for appetizers try the squad. Want go wrong"}
{"text":"Authentic dishes with good flavor. Large amounts for a low price.  Their Pomfret fry and cooked dishes are splendid. Their vegetarian options are also nicely done which is rare in most other places. However it is a small place with limited seating so the seats are pretty close together. When we went there, there were just 2 waiters doing a tough but admirable job of catering to all customers. I hope they can increase their space and cleanliness, which will make the place roomier and prettier."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a number of times but this is the first time I have decided to write a review about this place.  Good food - horrendous service!  Ordered the thali meals - which comes with egg plant curry, beans thoran (pan fried bean), moru curry (seasoned buttermilk - thanks wikipedia!), payasam(pudding) and a couple of more dishes. I order fish curry on the side and was given chicken curry instead. The lady asked me if I could manage with the chicken curry instead. I was like whaaat? I ordered something else and you get something else instead - no way! She then goes and gets the fish curry 15 minutes later when I am done with my meai. Thanks, but no thanks.  The food is very tasty and that makes me to drive 30 minutes to come to this place but they need to train their staff on service. I see new faces each time I visit this place.   Need to improve or else this place will close down like the rest very soon."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is horrible. Probably the worst buffet I've ever had in my life. My friend convinced me to try their dinner menu so I did. Wow!! It's like it's a completely different restaurant. The pomfret in banana leaf was outstanding. Mutton curry was tender, juicy and spiced to perfection. And the chicken biryani was one of the best I've had. You must try their dinner menu. I just hope they step up their lunch buffet game so that they don't go out of business."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet was awesome... I and my frnd gone ther for some biriyani... Bt we were glad to hav thier buffet... Especialy the kerala style pine apple curry, mango curry, papaya curry were delicious...I really loved thier fried chicken and their fish curry with the Biriyani... We also got addicted to thier payasam... Though the restaurant was small... The food was well served and nice and peaceful experience... I look forward to try their other items from the menu next time"}
{"text":"Authentic Kerala (a South Indian State) Food...   Meen Pollichathu, Thalasseri Fish Biriyani, Nadan Beef Fry, Kappa Biriyani etc. are the highlights here.   Moreover, now they have 20+ items Buffet in all working days for $10.99  They carry very unique food stuff, you won't find anywhere else in Toronto."}
{"text":"Fresh. Tasty. Freshest idlies. Tastiest masala dosas. Masala Chai as well is a must."}
{"text":"I didn't know Kerala cuisine could taste so good!  I love north indian food but this is one of the best styles of food I've had from India.  A must try."}
{"text":"Ordered the fish cooked in banana leaf, biryani and a plain dosa. This is the first time I've had a dosa and I was very impressed. It's a very thin crepe, good on its own but even better with the dips that came with it. I'll be in pursuit of more dosas in the future.  The fish had good flavours but I didn't like the fish itself, maybe if it's another type of meat... the biryani, again, had very good spices and flavours."}
{"text":"I have been dying to eat some authentic kerala food. This place brought home food to Canada.  Thank you much. The fish biriyani ( the thalasery  special fish biriyani ) was very delicious.  We also ordered the fish polichathu  and chicken varutharachathu.  Everything was above expectation. Really loved the place. Will always come back ."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night, and was very pleased with finding an authentic Kerala cuisine. We had Kerala Parota, Nadan Chicken Curry, and Chicken Biriyani, and I must say they were the best we've eaten so far. Much better than all the other south indian restaurants we've visited in Scarborough. Place was small, but nice and clean, and staff was very courteous as well.   Only problem was that yesterday being a weekend holiday, there was lot of crowd, and there were people waiting for seats all around the restaurant. And due to the rain, the patio outside couldn't be used either. So, my only suggestion to the owner would be to try to get a cover for the patio, and try to organize space inside such that customers waiting for seats and take-out's can wait without getting in the way of others. The huge crowd shows the popularity of south indian food and the restaurant - so, efforts should be made to organize the crowd well.  But we loved the food, and will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Ordered from Kairali through Ubereats and was pleasantly surprised! The butter chicken was delicious. We ordered both the kerala paratha and the garlic naan but kerala paratha would definitely be the winner between the two. Would definitely order again for my next butter chicken craving"}
{"text":"Simple basic decor, but the food is delicious. I am someone who go to eat at a restaurant for the food, and look for good value for money, rather than ambience. So this place really works for me.  The only thing is I wish they would use king fish for the curry, and not bass fillet."}
{"text":"We love South Indian food so we weren't too impressed. The owner sits where the customers are sitting and is on his phone the entire time and watches over you which was super uncomfortable. Food wise it's not the best in Scarborough. The taste is mainly from the spices which are fresh of course, I just wish their meat was cooked more and it didn't tasted old. Fresh meat is always softer and succulent. Rice was good. Dosa was also on the average side. The only dish we found fresh was the shrimp Masala. All in all, average experience."}
{"text":"Would rate this a 3.5 if I could. Went here with some family and family friends with adults and kids alike. The Kerala Fish dish is amazing. Coated in all these amazing spices, nice balance of heat and mix of flavours. Ate this with the pittu and it was fabulous.  Their vegetarian curries were decent. Nothing to rave about, but was decent.  Try their fish dish."}
{"text":"Rating - 3.5/5.0  Went for their lunch buffet and it was pretty good. I liked the fact that all their dishes were authentically flavoured with a kick of spice unlike some places where they tone down their butter chicken to the point where it is almost like a pasty tomato sauce.   However their dessert options and chutneys were not as elaborate as Mayur Fine Indian Cuisine. Overall this place is a repeat for some solid and authentic Indian food."}
{"text":"I usually eat Mutton curry and Parotta here. And I usually don't try any fish curry in the restaurants, but Pomphret Cooked in Banana Leaf pulled me to order the dish. I must say, I'm quite disappointed since the fish tastes bland though the leaf/fish  is completely filled with sauce and doesn't tastes good at all. Parotta seems like it was frozen, toasted and served."}
{"text":"Small little restaurant with a nice patio for summer nights. The food is really delicious and flavourful. We ordered the butter chicken, shrimp biryani, garlic naan and chilli chicken. The portions were good but I wasn't so impressed with the chilli chicken- else wise everything else was good. Price is decent for the quantity of food."}
{"text":"It was super dead on a Friday night, my group of 10 was the only people, which was great cause we were basically the only ones there. The staff was really nice and helpful with picking options. A lot of my friends didn't know South Asian menu opitons but they were really good in explaining everything. It was my friends birthday so we pre ordered a cake, and the staff brought it out for us and played a birthday song on the stereo. It was really sweet of them.  The food we got was delicious. There was a variety of different options to choose from. Rice, dosas, kothu roti, different curries. Different vegetarian and vegan options as well. They didn't give an option to change the spice level so be mindful for that. Some of my friends were able to tolerate it but others not so much.   The asthetics of the place was really nice. Definately gave a south asian vibe. I loved how some of our food came wraped in banana leaves."}
{"text":"Seriously guys, this place is the bomb. I used to live close to this place. After  I moved I have been trying out new places in midtown as well as downtown core. However, I still come back to this place cos other places I've been to are not as good. You can def. tell that they use the best ingredients and always serve it hot and fresh. Hands down on the butter paneer! Thank you for making such amazing flavours"}
{"text":"Unfortunately our excited anticipation of real Kerala food was woefully let down...only 1/8th of their menu is authentic Kerala dishes, and they didn't even have dosas--any real Keralite would know that's a must-have! Otherwise their biryani was tasty, and the staff/service was very pleasant and accommodating. Just too bad that you come in here with high hopes of real Kerala food, and it's more like a common South Indian restaurant. We decided we won't visit again. We have fond memories of the now-defunct Aravind Restaurant on the Danforth that served real, great Kerala dishes--so unfortunate that they closed up for whatever reason!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of south Indian food, so when I saw this place open up I knew I had to check it out.  I came here on a Sunday night with some friends for dinner. The menu consists of south Indian classics like curry, biryani, a small selection of dosa's, and different kinds of breads to accompany the curries. Many of the dishes they offer are also vegetarian; this would be a great place to bring a herbivore friend.   After consulting with our waiter, he recommended the chicken curry and I decided to order it. The chicken curry consisted of large chunks of tender chicken in thick gravy. The curry was nicely spiced, and had a pretty intense spice level (which is typical of south Indian cuisine). If you do order the curry, be careful as there are whole red chillies in the gravy. To accompany the curry, our waiter suggested we get the paratha's as they are a house specialty. The paratha was easily the best part of the meal, so buttery and flaky I could have eaten these on there own, these are definitely a must order.   I also managed to snag a bite of my friend's food. The mutton biryani was pretty good, nicely spiced but the mutton was a little tough. The mutton curry was very spicy and delicious but again the mutton was not as tender as I would have hoped. One of their house specialties is fish biryani, I did not try it so I will have to come back for that dish.   The restaurant itself is located on an industrial part of Kennedy Rd in Scarborough. It is painted bright orange from the outside so it's hard to miss. The service on this night was outstanding, being the only non-Indian/Sri Lankan patrons in the place the staff was patient with us as we asked questions and they were more than willing to make recommendations. This is a solid restaurant to get your south Indian spice fix."}
{"text":"Lunch Buffet review!!!  Went here for the lunch buffet for $10.99 per person.  The sign boasts over twenty five items served, which includes the pickle sauce, yoghurt, fried chilli, salad dressing and mixed greens as sides. For main dishes, they had brown rice, lemon rice and mutton biryani.  The biryani was amazing! They also had king fish curry, chicken curry, lentils with curry, green curry with some non meat ingredient, potato curry and mango curry. They had some spicy dish with okra, onion pakora and three types of soup, including vegetable soup, cabbage soup and crab soup.  They had butter naan and a crunchy thin round paratha looking bread.  They had two desserts, one which was made with coconut milk, I believe, with some salty ingredient mixed In and a fruit salad. They have great quality dishes for a buffet. They don't skimp on the ingredients.  I read the menu before coming here and I don't think they had, if any, the Kerala dishes which was marked by an asterisk on their menu present at the buffet.  I'd like to have tried the dishes mixed with coconut or those with banana leaf which is indicated as a Kerala dish on their online menu.  Perhaps the dish varieties at the buffet changes. Overall, the quality and taste of the food was great.  Each dish had its own distinct flavour and spices.  Note that the crab soup was very spicy, but the chicken curry was not spicy at all.  The butter naan was warm, soft and fresh. It was great pairing it with the different sauces and curry dishes. They give you a water jug which is great, and serve their coca cola in an old school bottle with a straw. They were not quick with refilling the food items or the plates, nor were they quick in clearing up plates.  I just decided to re-use the first plate I had or my second round.  The biryani was empty for my second round until I left the place, which is at least fifteen minutes. Since I only took two spoonfuls the first time around (I wanted to try everything in small bite sized portions).  I wish they had re-filled because I liked it.  Note that I found his place on yelp and decided to try it, partly because there  was a check in option of 5% off your order. I asked if this promotion includes the buffet or just take out orders. The waiter did not know anything about this promotion, showed him the app, so I asked for a manager. He came back with no response so I showed the yelp app and asked again. He talked to my companion and said something about talking to the owner who was siting there. Owner did not approach us. We were then given a bill and they did not give loose change so you had to at least tip the 5 dollar bill change. I don't appreciate being basically forced to tip more than fifteen percent.  The whole place was pretty quiet which is a nice way to dine.  Was not impressed with the handling of my question related to the yelp deal and the change provided. I thought the owner might have at least informed the waiter whether this deal was for takeout, dine-in or buffet.  He could have come answered the question himself which I thought he would do, when I saw him stand up and look our way. But I just got the feeling he was looking over in disdain and then promptly served us the bill so we could leave.  Food was good, but the experience was soured, so I give it three stars."}
{"text":"Pro-- Food is good. Huge meat portions in their biryani. Tried the fish and mutton biryani which were really good. King fish fry in banana leaves was ok. Nadan Fish Fry was good. What I would recommend here are the biryani.  Cons- I have mixed emotions with the service. First, the servers are inexperienced. Some of them sitting infront maybe because it was a slow day when we came which is understandable(Saturday afternoon). Also, they forgot 3 of our orders so we just cancelled them. Glad that the other server came to us though to apologize and took ownership of the situation.  Price-- 3 of us for $50 . I think that really good.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"In search of appam I ended up here as this was the closest... placed order for appam with veg korma as they didn't have the stew it usually goes with and masala Dosa. This is what I thought:- Quantity: 3/5 Quality: 2/5 ( the masala Dosa came with frozen chutney, room temp. Sambar and spiced up potato filling and all three tasted bad, the quality of Dosa was good and crisp; the veg korma for me was sweet with extra black pepper, appam was good but m not sure if the size was apt for $$) Ambience: 4/5(small but good) Service: 3/5 (they were good with us, but with another customer they didn't bother to clear the beer bottle from last customer)  Overall, I feel it's 3/5, it's ok in case u feel like having Kerala's cuisine(may b other things r good, m not sure), for me it was not value for money for some food items but they were nice enough to give us 10% discount. So I will come back for the appams if I don't find better appams anywhere else."}
{"text":"One of the better Kerala food I tasted. I recommended this place for people who want to try this style of food. If you like fish and curry try the Meen pollichalhu. Completely worth going here. It is the most unique taste in this place. Masala omellete is my next recommendation. It is a spicy omellete, light and flavourful. The standard Indian food there was not the best. Better of trying at other restaurants more specialised in them."}
{"text":"Walked in and stood around for several minutes. No one greeted or offered us a table so we sat down.  Waiter gave us water and began to wipe a neighboring table with a smelly towel. I got up and took 2 menus from the counter near the cashier. 2 guys were standing around there.  Yelp check-in was not honoured. The cashier had no idea what it was and went into the kitchen to ask. The answer he received was \"Expired\".   We ordered the fish biryani, the paneer wrapped in banana leaf and the mutton curry. Food was tasty enough. When we asked the waiter to give us a box for the leftovers, he misunderstood, threw all the cutlery into the remaining food and was about to dump it!   The restaurant was not the cleanest-looking place. I shudder to think what the kitchen looked like. I've been to India and love North Indian cuisine. South Indian is not my favourite and given the negatives we experienced, I doubt we will go back."}
{"text":"Both I and my wife tried out the place last night one of my good Sri Lankan friend recommended the place. We were looking for an authentic Sri Lankan place. The Fish Biriyani and Fish in Banana Leaf was the highlight....service is quiet good...definitely will go back and take my friends who craves for some good fish dishes made South Indian/ Sri Lankan style"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! We got the promfet fish (which was wrapped in banana leave and was absolutely Devine!), butter chicken (also in my top 3), Kadai mutton, eggplant piratal (super good), and the Kerla parotha (best one I've tried so far) & the fish biriyani (again amazing).   We went on Mother's Day, so the restaurant was beyond packed and we had to wait about 1 hr for a 10 people table and to get the food, but was worth it.   Only gripe I have is that they need to seriously expand and make their restaurant bigger."}
{"text":"The food here is good.  The value of the lunch buffet is excellent and there are a lot of choices.  The spice level is a bit high (I like that).  Worth a try when in the area."}
{"text":"The food is great, reasonably priced. Authentic South Indian food I am sure they are making some good use of their grandma's secret recipes.. succulent goat appetisers, biryani is good and the chicken delicacies are great too!"}
{"text":"My son and I dropped in for a late afternoon lunch buffet, toward the end of the lunch window-- between 2:00 and 3:00.  Despite the late start, the staff kept refreshing the buffet with more supplies and kept it tidy.  The food was really tasty -- and there was sufficient variety.  The butter chicken was the highlight -- it was suprisingly tender and NOT overcooked like we often encounter in buffets..  The staff made us feel comfortable and came by several times to check in on us and offer us dosas.  It is not a fancy place, but they make it for it with great tasting food and friendly family style service.  At times the music seemed a wee bit too loud, making it slightly hard to communicate with the waiter, but we were sitting right under one of the ceiling-hung speakers.  We will visit again when passing through this part of the city."}
{"text":"Authentic Kerala food. We reached early around 6:30 pm when there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised when the food arrived."}
{"text":"I was on a business trip to Toronto ,found Kairali on yelp with 4 stars , so decided to try it out . Got to the restaurant , there were a few tables and the buffet was on offering . Looked like there was a lot of food for $11 but I wasn't in the mood for it . Sat down ordered a paratha,uttapam and lamb curry with a mango shake . The mango shake was lovely full of mango and just perfect . I had an order of paratha which came first so I pinched it and took a bite and it was perfect but I was anxious for the lamb curry coz I would have hated my meal if my bread got cold . After a few minutes she did bring the rest of my order . Looking at the lamb curry it looked very disappointing , it didn't look right . Tasted it the meat was soft and succulent but the taste wasn't . It was edible and ok but it felt like there wasn't too much love put into making the curry . Tasted the uttapam , it was ok , found the pancake too fluffy in texture but the chutneys was good . The sambar that accompanied it was thick and full of vegetable but it lacked taste and flavour and the real South Indian taste . The sambar was probably sitting in a heated container and it dries out over time and the chef forgets to add water to get the consistency right and it is served directly from that container . Overall I found the food to be ok but it was definitely not up to my expectations but the bill was cheap."}
{"text":"Our first dining experience here was exceptional. Although the interiors aren't flashy but then that should last thing on your mind.  Our server was very kind and gregarious. Very attentive service.   We ordered Fish in Banana Leaf. Two of them. King fish and Pomfret. Both of them were well cooked with spices and thick gravy. I personally preferred Pomfret due to its mesmerizing taste and juicy aftermath.  Fish biryaani was a mixed affair.  The spices were spot on, so was aroma. But the fish appeared a bit hard. Yet it was still a great finish.   Next time, we have our eyes set on Kerela spices making mutton (goat) and chicken a memorable experience!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch on December 31st. Drinks are priced reasonably.  We ordered shrimp pakora for appetizer and its just plain shrimp battered and deep fried.  Missing the spices. Chilli chicken too dry and lacking proper preparation.  Fish cooked on banana leaf is good. Service was good. Kitchen quality is definitely missing.  Won't recommend this place at this point."}
{"text":"I had the Dosa, the batter came out in as a 4 foot roll that was crispy and was nice to dip in the sauces.   The paneer was good, had a nice tang to compliment the richness. I would highly reccomend"}
{"text":"I've came here before for  the buffet, but the food is nothing spectacular. Though I ordered the naan and mutton sukka which were really delicious so i keep coming back for these two dishes here!"}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy Kerala style food. Excellent service and excellent food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had pomfret fish and Idli. Pomfret came wrapped in a banana leaf with loads of masala, I expected it to be fried but nevertheless was wonderful. Idlis one of the best I have had. Only complaint the heat was either turned off or very low, I had to move from window to interior seating still it did not help. The staff was very attentive and helpful"}
