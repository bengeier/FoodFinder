{"text":"There aren't a lot of food options in Clark, so I was pleasantly surprised when we stopped by Murphy's Tavern coming back from a day of playing in the snow at Steamboat Lake. 

I had the Bison Ribs which were falling off the bone and basted in a tomato and jus-based sauce that was incredible. And, it came with homemade mac n cheese with bacon that they cure on site - unbelievable. The ribs were served on a bed of steamed seasoned broccoli that was fresh and crisp and had a kick to it. Turns out that the owner and chef 'Murph' (you'll probably meet him because he's super-friendly and seems to love talking to his guests) was the head Chef at some of the top gourmet restaurants in Steamboat and Boulder. Now he's living the American Dream having recently took over the tavern at the Glenn Eden resort. He said its a 14 day process of brining and smoking to actually make the bacon. Well, it really comes out in the flavor - I'd come for the bacon alone. I also had a chocolate cake for dessert that was incredible - dense, moist and chocolate butter cream icing that was worth the damage it did to my cholesterol! My wife had a black bean burger that was fresh and hearty and delicious. Turns out the black bean burger was actually house made on site as well - I got the sense that they pretty much don't buy anything frozen or pre-made. Not your standard pub fare. There were plenty of selections for the kids too along with coloring and crayons - very family friendly. 

The decor is pretty plain, but warm. Hardwood all around, and a big wood stove to keep it cozy. The staff and and the other folks in the place were super friendly as well - giving the place a real warm atmosphere and friendly feel. People were just hanging out, talking and enjoying the food, beer and company. All in all, this was a meal to remember and a great way to finish off a nice day in the mountains."}
{"text":"Man. After hearing so many good things about this place I find myself extremely dissapointed.... Poor service, mediocre food, and it's in the middle of nowhere. Stopped here after a long day in north Routt and looked forward to some tasty food. Not so much. Anything fried tastes like fish, maybe you should change your oil. Burger is greasy. Not juicy. Greasy. I've been to the bar to refill my drink several times. I doubt we'll be returning. Thanks for nothing Murphy."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly but the service was not up to par. We had to go to the bar for refreshments and condiments because our server avoided our table after food was dropped off. I had the chicken strips and they tasted like fish and chips. Maybe time to change the grease or have a different  batter/grease for chicken and the fish cause all I could taste on my chicken was fish - I had to check a few times to make sure it actually was chicken. The dressing on the caesar salad was mostly oil, I wouldn't order that again. I'd come back but I have to say that it wasn't what I expected"}
{"text":"Murphy's tavern is fantastic! After eating there a few times and tasting their phenomenal food, we made the decision to have them cater our wedding. It was the perfect choice!  Leslie and Murph(the owners) were so so great to work with! They went above and beyond to make sure our big day was a success!  We had fried chicken and gravy, bison short ribs, polenta, and pulled pork as our main courses. All our wedding guests said it was not only some of the best wedding food they'd ever had, but just some of the best food in general! We highly recommend using them for catering but also for eating in their restaurant. Everything is made from scratch and in house. Murphy's tavern has the quality you'd expect at a fine dining, white table cloth restaurant, but with a casual atmosphere and affordable prices. We don't only eat there when we're passing through Clark, but we will go to Clark just to eat there! It is absolutely worth the drive! WE LOVE THIS PLACE AND WILL BE COMING BACK FOR YEARS TO COME!"}
{"text":"Awesome menu! Delicious food! What a find!! I ordered the salmon, polenta, artichoke dish. I wish I could have the stomach of a 400 lb man so I could eat the whole thing... because... damn!! Also, our waiter was super friendly and personable."}
{"text":"Had the Murf pizza. Was very good with sausage, olives, jalape√±os, and mushrooms. Crust was great. Thin, crispy with a slight chew to it. Also had a great piece of their home made strawberry short cake. Definitely will go back to explore the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"Worth the drive to Murphy's Tavern for Grandma's pies alone.  With over 3,000 pies to her credit, friendly and spry Grandma still bakes the tastiest pies in Colorado.  She only uses local fruits and only those in-season.  Whether it is the pumpkin cheesecake, the peach pie, the apple pie, the cherry pie, the mixed berry pie, the upside down cakes, the pumpkin loaves, or any other fancy that she creates, Grandma is a true master at baking.  Call ahead and see what she is baking, and place an order.  Worth the drive from Steamboat.  Heck, I am planning to ride up from Denver on the motorcycle, just to pick up some pies.  Between the beautiful views on the way, and the great reward of a Grandma's pie at the end, this is a day trip well worth taking, especially during the fall colors.  With a full food menu as well, Murphy's in Clark should be on your radar as a hidden Colorado gem."}
{"text":"This was a last minute stop after the reviews said how great it was. The staff was great and prides themselves on home made meals. I had the brisket with fries which was awesome. The best meal my entire trip."}
