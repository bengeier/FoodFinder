{"text":"Ordered a large regular poutine it arrived after 50 minutes and felt i was eating 1 week old potatoes and they where hard called to ask where is my order the person who answered wasnt very friendly.I did trie there hot dog and subs there where acceptable."}
{"text":"Very decent place, opens late which is great because they deliver to my work , when late in the office like after midnight. They make a delicious souvlaki pita. Tried a club sandwich which was nice but cheap on mayo. The coleslaw yikes too sour, but overall food and service is tops."}
{"text":"I've never gone into Bellerive to eat but we order delivery from there fairly often. My daughter is a fan of THEIR spaghetti and meat balls. She doesn't like anyone elses so when she requests this we make it a Bellerive night. 

I haven't really tried much of their menu because I pick and choose particular places to go to for certain foods. I am a fan of their club sandwich. 

One of the things that I particularly enjoy about this place is how polite their staff is. No matter who answers the phone they are full of smiles and always eager to offer suggestions on how to get what I want at a lower cost. (They offer me the coupon codes instead of the other way around!). The delivery person is always nice and lucky for me not afraid of a 90lb dog. 

This place gets Demi's two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I came to Bellerive with a couple of co-workers for a quick lunch. I went with a couple of pepperoni pizza slices, fountain coke and some fries. It came down to less than $10 and I felt in the end I got my money's worth.

The pizza was fresh from the oven and the slices were HUGE with plenty of cheese and pepperoni. I had to eat it with a fork and knife. HOW FANCY! The fries were also solid. 

The staff were nice and friendly and everything took less than 5 minutes to serve.

Solid place."}
{"text":"Couldn't even get passed the giy on the phone. He could barely speak english and was yelling. I guess if I want to try the food I will have to go there."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love comfort food. Had the Bellerive sub and it was pure awsomeness. The kids shared a pizza and poutine. Everything was fresh, tasty and plentiful. One of the reviews had a bad experience with the poutine that was delivered. Here is my tip for take out, stick to food that doesn't get mushy. Poutine is best when eaten as soon as the sauce is poured. Great fast food place."}
