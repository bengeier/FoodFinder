{"text":"I got citrus chipotle and hot garlic flavor wings. Honestly, they were ok. I couldn't tell which was which! If you told me to guess the flavor, one would be sweet chili and the other would be just generic \"hot\". 

I came to the conclusion that they either messed up my order (which is bad) or they just made up fancy names to get people to buy their wings, but didn't actually put any effort into making their sauces (which is bad). The main thing they have going for is that they serve wings, and even bad wings are good."}
{"text":"I've ordered from WoM several times. I give them four stars, though depending on the day I would drop them to three stars. See below.

First, I can say that I only ever eat boneless wings, and Wings has some of the best in Madison. However, the quality definitely varies from order to order; sometimes you get four to eight very big juicy wings (exactly what you want), other times you get one or two good ones and a bunch of skinny breaded... Things. The flavor selection is pretty solid. I can definitely recommend their dry rubs, but sometime the sauce usage seems somewhat excessive... And sometimes spills over or overwhelms the plastic delivery box!

Second, the sides are pretty lackluster. I know they're known for wings but would it kill you to have decent French fries (see the other reviews - they usually come soggy and bland). The onion rings would be better if they weren't so salty, but I'd take those over the fries.

However, I will note that I am usually impressed with their delivery service. It's usually quite fast and the folks who have done the delivering are quite friendly. Beyond that, they do seem to care about their customers. Once I ordered during a rainstorm and they called to apologize because their delivery drivers couldn't drive that day (road was flooded), but they did offer me a $5 credit (on top of a full refund). 

All in all, this is one of the better places to get wings in Madison - but your experience with the food itself can definitely vary."}
{"text":"A few days after I sent a complaint about my customer service experience to the corporate office, I received a call from the Madison owner. He listened to me and was genuinely very concerned about what had happened to me. He promised to deal with the manager in question, offered me his private cell number, and a discount on my next order. I have since ordered and the service was much improved."}
{"text":"Was in Madison dropping off my brother for school. Heard about Wings Over from friends back in Pennsylvania. We got the Hanger 3 which was plenty of boneless wings, fries and onions rings for me, my brother, and Dad. We had the red alert and honey bbq sauces on the boneless wings. Both were great. They say they bread the chicken by hand which you can tell.  I'm usually a normal chicken wing guy but I would totally get the boneless wings again.  My brother now has his gameday food set for the season. Fast delivery and awesome fries too. Very good quality, a shame the closest Wings Over back home is 3+ hrs away ;("}
{"text":"Today chicken wings were calling my name. Wings Over Madison came to my rescue. Thank goodness for delivery. 
The wings were pretty standard compared to other places I have been. I ordered a 1 pound mixture of their dry rub parmesan garlic and honey barbecue boneless wings. Thank goodness for Tupperware because I now have meals for days.  
My love of fries knows no bounds, so I also ordered some of their parmesan garlic fries with cheese dipping sauce. Salty and cheesy all at once. 
The price was not terrible (but that helps when you have coupons). It's around $12 for a pound of wings. 

Overall the food is pretty good. I may have to go into the store one day to get a feel for the place itself."}
{"text":"I got a mad craving for some hot wings after midnight in my apartment.  I ordered some spicy garlic boneless wings online, they arrived not only hot and delicious, but fifteen minutes ahead of schedule.  True, the \"boneless wings\" are more like chicken tenders than what you might find at BWW, but it's good meat and not too much breading.  10 out of 10 from me."}
{"text":"Love Wings Over Madison!! Wings both bone-in and boneless always taste great. My favorite flavor are hot garlic and citrus chipotle. Waffle fries rock!! Ribs are good too.
Quick service, both pick up and delivery. 

My husband and I have moved away from Madison for about 6-7 months and we actually crave for wings from Wings Over Madison every week! It is the first thing we get when we are back in town to visit. 

Please please consider opening Wings Over DC!!"}
{"text":"woM is a great place for wings. Personally, I like my BBQ sauce sweeter and that is one quality I love about this place. The boneless wings are great and the crinkle cut fries are nice and crispy. They also deliver! And till pretty late which is super nice for late night cravings!"}
{"text":"I thought the bone-in wings were incredible! Not necessarily a dine-in place but have great delivery and it arrives hot and fresh! I recommend Cajun BBQ.."}
{"text":"With this place being basically across the street from 2 large hospitals, they are going to get fairly steady business. As a nurse at one of those hospitals,  I have ordered from them more than a few times. Food generally arrives hot and the correct order. We wish there was more consistency with the sauces and the amounts on the wings.  Sometimes you get a super spicy sauce and the next time you order the same thing you get something much more vinegary and bland. The fries could be more crispy. They are usually quite soggy by the time they arrive. Overall we do order from here fairly regularly,  especially on 2nd shift. They are quick with their delivery."}
{"text":"I moved away from Madison about a year ago and though I don't miss the majority of the, typically bland, food from Wisconsin I got boneless wings from a local place in my new state and found myself craving Wings Over Madison's amazing boneless wings. Truly a major cut above the rest.

Wing's over Boulder? Wing's over Denver? Any chance guys?"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to get wings! The food is prepared quickly and the staff is friendly. There are many different sauces to choose from as well as order sizes. I think these are the best boneless wings in Madison."}
{"text":"saucy, spicy and bulky meat wings.. I order delivery from here much and has never been disappointed with the quality of meat and taste they offer....."}
{"text":"My go-to for take out. Quick delivery, always on time and reasonably priced.  My fianc√© loves the wings and sauces. I always get the wings plain with fries.  They can be a little heavy handed on the salt. Try the onion rings they are delicious."}
{"text":"Another nice little wing shop in Madison. They've always been quick for me and the wings and fries have been good. The down side is each time I've eaten their wings I've had some that were cooked just too long and tough. Good place to go in a pinch for wings."}
{"text":"Not the best! There's something about older chicken that I just can't stand. I know they used it. It was funky. I got the 3 hottest sauces, all the way to Afterburner, but they didn't slow me down! I'm just looking for some well made, fresh buffalo wings!"}
{"text":"Ordered food at Wings Over Madison- didn't take as long as expected. After my five minute drive home everything was cold. It was clear I got old fries. Boneless wings were not impressive- lots of breading."}
{"text":"If I had to describe Wings Over Madison in two words, I'd say \"Super Saucy\".  Their wings, and sauces, are so good because the wings are HUGE, and quite delicious because they're usually smothered in sauce.  Every time I order from WOM, I get really good quality wings, and really savor the sauces.  Also, get ranch and or blue cheese dressing.  Both are really good combinations with the wing sauces.  Great place if you're ordering food for a group of friends too!"}
{"text":"My friends and I would say 4 stars, but if my ass hole had a vote, it would have said negative 5 stars. I ordered online, and there was not a ranking of least spicy to spiciest. Obviously, wimpy was the weakest. But wouldn't one think that Jet Fuel is hotter than afterburner? I can tell you what gets the after burn, and it's your ass hole. I immediately started sweating, and my nose started running. Everyone around me immediately became concerned. And then about 15 minutes later, my stomach also showed me it's concern. All in all, I think Wings Over Madison needs better descriptions on their online ordering system to save one ass hole at a time."}
{"text":"I ordered here for the TNF game. Boneless wings and Cajun waffle fries. The wings were tough, which I didn't even know was a thing for what are essentially chicken tenders. And not just a couple in my order but every single one. Honestly, Wing Street (Pizza Hut) has better boneless wings. The fries were okay. The Cajun seasoning is good. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's good for what it is. The first time I ordered here, they forgot the buttermilk ranch. And wowza I was missing out. Best dipping sauce ever. 

We ordered the wimpy buffalo, cruisin' altitude buffalo (slightly spicier), and Parmesan garlic dry rub. The trio paired well! 1.5 lbs was a little much for the two of us. We also ordered a large fry (crinkle cut, woop!) and were STUFFED afterwards. Next time I might venture outside the comfort zone and try a teriyaki sauce.

Overall, great game day food. They also do twitter deals for free wings every Wednesday. Winner winner chicken dinner."}
{"text":"I don't have a lot to say about WOM. They just weren't really good. I like my wings to be piping hot and these were just, blah. The flavors were fine but if it isn't on a bed of fresh crispy chicken it is lost to me. I only like boneless so I can't say how the reqular were. I definitely wouldn't go back or want to visit any other \"wings over\" place. The service was nice. They were really busy and they handled it well."}
{"text":"WoM has become one of our go-to places for us, and it has basically ruined other chicken wing places for me. Ive been to BWWs a few times recently and the boneless wings here are so far beyond Bdubs that I am surprised they're made from the same animal. I even prefer the sauces here now - go for jet fuel and Cajun BBQ for a nice combo if you're into spicy wings.

I mentioned the partition thing in my first review, the wings still come in the same box, but they do a better job of segmenting the wings. Love this place."}
{"text":"Great wings. Was in Madison a couple of days ago and I needed a quick bite. Loved the wings. Get boneless, Cajun BBQ, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Buffalo wings are typically gross. They're made with a lot of synthetic ingredients and the worst quality meat around. I've lost count of how many times I've bitten into a \"wing\" only to have the entire bone split or crumble.  

But Wings over Madison is one of the few places that have defied the low bar set by other buffalo wing establishments. The meat is always very 'plump' and 'juicy.' I also like that they have lots of varieties in sauces. I tend not to like really sloppy and spicy sauces, so I go for the dry rub. Last, you can get many other things with the wings, like BBQ ribs and fries."}
{"text":"Both my boyfriend and I LOVE this place. I've always received great service (whether picking up from the restaurant or getting it delivered). I've only ever tried the boneless wings and they're so good that I'm afraid to try anything else!

The wings contain the perfect amount of chicken and breading. The outside of the wing is always crispy, never soggy and drenched in sauce. Love. The teriyaki and sweet chili are my personal favorites!"}
{"text":"This place hit the spot after my 2015 Madison Half Marathon.  Got the B-1 Bomber with the Cruisin Altitude sauce, and got Garlic Parm Waffle Fries.  They did it right with a tub of ranch.  Wings were crispy and the sauce was bomb.  Service was quick and it looked like the delivery service was busy.  No one was dining in, may be because it was a Sunday and the semester was over.  Price was just right, and the wings/sauce were on point.  Go here and get some good wings."}
{"text":"The menu says boneless wings, but what they really mean is chicken tenders. These are some of the largest boneless wings I have ever seen. Also, they have a huge selection of sauces with a variety of flavor profiles and heat. My personal favorites are the citrus chipotle and Cajun barbeque. I love waffles fries, but theirs are hit or miss - bout half the time they are overcooked. However, they do season them with any of their dry rubs on request. 

Lastly, they deliver!"}
{"text":"WoM was the cherry on top of yet another American Ninja Warrior date night last night. BBCakes and I like to order a DC-10 (\"Over 1 lb of boneless tenders\".) We go with one half pound of Garlic Parmesan Tenders (this dry rub flavoring has ALWAYS been a winner!) and use the other half pound of tenders to explore a new flavor-of-the-night from their menu. The West Texas Mesquite flavor we tried on our most recent order may not have been Parm Garlic, but it was still 4/5ths as tasty - the hint of sweetness with the Mesquite rub was a noteworthy and welcome surprise a well.  

Tasty tenders - the price is okay - and the delivery service is a great bonus."}
{"text":"If you've decided to eat here, you probably don't have the energy to put on pants. Let me help make things easier for you:

Get the garlic parmesan waffle fries. Those are crispy and flavorful, and will come with ketchup without having to ask. The hot garlic wings are probably what you're craving. Order more than you think you'll need. The F-16, which confusingly only have 15 wings, are bone-in. There are also boneless options, but I didn't even look at that side of the menu. You'll have your choice of blue cheese or ranch, incase you wanted even more sauce on your already saucy wings. 

The wings are a bit bigger than BW3's, but celery is not included, so don't get your hopes up. Their wings seem to be made to order, given the time it takes, and all the sauces will be very salty 

The people on staff are usually relaxed and helpful."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place. The service was not very fast and the wings were not tasty at all. The sauces, even though I went with the Caribbean jerk, tasted very much like Buffalo sauce. They have a million sauces...well not really but there's a ton. Consider this strictly a carry out or delivery place. You do not want to dine in here.

I also was not a fan on how they price their wings. You order by the pound...who does that? I don't know how many wings are in a pound. Normal places usually price by number of wings. These guys price the same as Buffalo Wild Wings but are no where near the quality.

I guess if you're smoozing for some bar time food, this will work if you're drunk. On the plus side, they deliver too. Overall, I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"I like the food here I do, but they will refuse to deliver to even to delivery zones they claim to serve.  We live outside of their zone, so we called and asked where they would deliver, they provided us with the address, only to later refuse to deliver there.  Decent food.  Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Selection is large and the naming convention for their wings is a little confusing, I ordered boneless instead of traditional which was my bad. They're a place with limited dine-in seating but they're quite busy with delivery. The wait time was about average and considering how busy they were that was a-okay. I will probably eat here again but am a bit hesitant due to the state of their bathroom. The bathroom was quite dirty, while not the worst I've seen it looked like no one had taken the time to do anything but refill the tp and paper towels. The state of bathrooms usually reflects on the sanitation and cleanliness of the kitchen. For the price and location I'm not going to complain too much.  Wings tasted good and the variety of sauces was impressive. I'd say if you're in range and have a party of 4 or more get the delivery, you get a lot of wings in most of their sizes. Best $ value to quality from what I've had so far. 3 1/2 *'s if I could."}
{"text":"These are the best wings I've ever had. LA, Portland, Tucson, Denver.. move aside. MADISON is where it's at in regards to wings. Wow. I'm addicted."}
{"text":"Love the wings and all the sauce choices.  Wish they had a closer location.  I always take mine to go and it is worth the almost 45 minute drive to get there and back."}
{"text":"These guys never fail to deliver, figuratively and literally. No matter what I order for my late night cravings (open till 1am Sun - Thurs, 3am Fri & Sat, guys), they prepare and deliver it quickly. As for the quality of my meals; all I can say is that I've never been let down. I've worked my way around their sauces in the boneless wing selections and have yet to find one I dislike."}
{"text":"This is your average wing spot. Nothing extraordinary but no complaints either. Perfect for delivery to satisfy your craving. Delivery is pretty fast and affordable. Took us about 40 minutes from our order to get the food. 

I prefer their dry rub wings as they don't get as soggy with the delivery. They have pretty decent waffle fries as well."}
{"text":"Pretty good wings! I ordered the sweet onion barbecue boneless wings, crinkle cut fries, and a can of soda for about $10.00. It was enough to feed two! You can dine in, take out, or get delivery. I plan to go back to try the baby back ribs."}
{"text":"Their wings are actually very good with  juicy meats and a very diverse sauce selection. I personally think it's the best chicken wings place I've tried in Madison. I also love their waffle fries.

The only thing is that the quality can be inconsistent sometimes, specially when during game days..."}
{"text":"I fail to see how a business operates with loud explicit rap music blaring where customers are supposed to order. The employees may like it but it cost the business several orders as a result. The music was so loud I couldn't even think of what I wanted to order. 

There are many methods to keep the pace of the employees when business starts to slow down. However, businesses need to be mindful that not everyone likes the explicit language, the volume, and the seeming indifference to potential customers coming through the door. 

Terrible."}
{"text":"They're ok, if you're into breaded wings. The honey bbq sauce is pretty good."}
{"text":"Great wings, fast delivery, opened late night, and cheap!!! What more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"So the delivery driver just drove off as I walked up to the car... Called the store and they told me that it would be a half hour for him to come back and I would still have to pay for it. Terrible service and cant even tell you how the wings are because he never delivered them. They also said they would be there in 20 minutes and came 45 minutes later."}
{"text":"Fast tasty wings at a reasonable price. I always order the boneless. Chicken is a bit dry but good sauces and a satisfying crunch."}
{"text":"Basically buffalo wild wings  BUT THEY DELIVER!  

Good quality wings, good prices and delivery.  Don't order thinking you're going to get super high end gourmet wings, but they'll be satisfying."}
{"text":"SUPER fast delivery and delicious food.  I ordered the boneless wings and fries.  The fries are perfectly fresh and crunchy.  The boneless wings are more like chicken tenders than the smaller nugget type of boneless wings you might find at other restaurants and they're fantastic.  I got the spicy teriyaki sauce which is great with a nice kick to it, but I'll be trying their other flavors since they all sound so good.  It's a good serving for a good price.  You really can't go wrong here.  Love it."}
{"text":"I was expecting crappy wings and these are the best boneless  wings I've ever had. Juicy and good breaking and the sauces!!! Mm mm mm"}
{"text":"Went for the first time recently. The Wings were excellent. They were very crispy and the flavors were awesome. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because we dined in and the order taking employees were very loud. I understand the all-star game was on but do we really need to clap and yell loudly in the restaurant? It was my fiance and I eating inside. I will come back for the wings just this time I'll take them to go."}
{"text":"This place is great. The regular wings are meaty and a good size. The boneless wings are more like GIANT chicken tenders, but are hand battered deliciousness.

Additionally, the sauce choices are expansive. They are all uniquely flavored, unlike some of their competition which have sauces that taste like different mixtures of ketchup and hot sauce. 

My favorite is citrus chipotle with cajun bbq being the runner up. Thanks to many work parties, I've had the opportunity to try almost all of the sauces. I have yet to find one that I disliked.

The only downfall, they are not open for lunch Monday - Thursday. This greatly displeases my work place, but we love Fridays."}
{"text":"I placed a delivery order of boneless wings and fries. The wings were not good. They were drenched in way too much sauce. The fries were mediocre. Worst of all, though, was the service. I received a call from my delivery person. All he said was \"Wings. Meet me downstairs...\" and before I could even reply he hung up. As I went down to get my food, I was welcomed with an intimidating glare, as though I had done something wrong. I was reaching for my pocket to get tip money for him regardless of the fact that he didn't deserve a penny...and guess what he does? He shoves the food in my torso and continues to glare at me. I stopped digging for my wallet and decided he didn't deserve a tip. Seriously! How rude! Do not give them your service until they learn to appropriately train their staff! :("}
{"text":"I only got delivery so I can't comment on how it would be like to dine in. 

I tried their wings (both boneless and bone in) with several different sauces. I especially like the Teriyaki based sauces with some spice. The dry rubs I had were powdered a little too much so they weren't pleasing to eat. Since then I haven't ordered dry rubs. In my opinion you would have a better experience if you stick to juicy sauces.

The prices seem to be a little high. However, you do get a lot of chicken. Once the chicken wings I had were much smaller than usual but they were nice enough to give me a few extra which definitely compensated for the difference.

Prompt delivery. Kudos."}
{"text":"Giving this place three stars because ...

Their wings taste good BUT if you only pay your delivery drivers $5 an hour, how can you expect your employees to be able to live on that? Much less provide quality customer service?"}
{"text":"Favorite delivery spot! I order the same thing here once a week. They're super quick and they don't charge a fee for delivery. I usually get the kickin BBQ fried chicken sandwich and fries and I love it. The fries can be really salty though so I would recommend asking for little salt."}
{"text":"The good:  these guys make decent wings with good flavor and a decent selection on the menu.  The price is right for the amount of wings you get and it beats the chain wings hands down for good late night crispy wings.  And they deliver!

The bad: it takes a while to get your order if you place it in the store.  They tell you it will be 15 minutes regardless of the number of people standing around, and that is just an arbitrary time.  It is never 15 minutes.  The menu is also a little difficult to follow.  The restaurant (I hesitate to even call it that) is barren and uncomfortable at best, appealing only to drunk college kids.

The ugly: dirty.  Dirty tables, dirty counters and dirty employee hands.  During my \"15 minutes\" I witnessed not one, but two employees use the restroom and flush then walk straight out.  No hand washing and at least one of them never did before touching an order.  The other disappeared into the kitchen.  A third went outside to smoke, then returned to handle orders without washing as well.  

Though I have been here in the past, this is my last visit.  I can overlook a lot, but food safety is not something anyone should take lightly.  These guys need some adult supervision.  Calling Restaurant Impossible!  These guys desperately need your Robert Irvine.

Update:  I have been contacted by the owner and assured that the staff will be retrained on cleanliness and personal hygiene.  He also offered a store credit to give them a try again.  Although I declined, it is good to hear that they are interested in food safety and cleanliness, as well as customer satisfaction.  Giving them an extra star for that."}
{"text":"Best wings in town!! They're the size of chicken tenders, so I'm guessing you would be getting about a half dozen birds when you order the \"Zeppelin.\"

I happen to think the best sauce is the Honey BBQ. Trust me, no reason to stray from that one (sauce or wings). Lol!

I've heard pros and cons about anything else on the menu that's not the boneless wings...

Place seems pretty low key. Maybe not the greatest place to dine-in (tiny tables, not the most aesthetically pleasing environment) but for carry-out, their wings can't be beat!"}
{"text":"As you'd expect, nothing more, nothing less. Don't take my three-star rating as me disliking it - I enjoy the food here. The same way I enjoy my sneakers or a bottle of soda. There are definitely better places out there, where if you put in a tiny bit of effort then you can enjoy. But when it's 11PM on a Sunday, you just don't want to put that effort. And that's where Wings over Madison comes in.

Fast delivery, decent tenderness. I found the sweet-flavored chicken more tender than the hot sauce-flavored chicken. But overall, this fast-food place, like most fast-food places, is so unimpressive that I struggle to find more things to talk about. Eat here if you just don't have the energy to put on pants."}
{"text":"We ordered the boneless wings (garlic parmesean rub and wimpy buffalo sauce) and a grilled chicken wrap, and it took AN HOUR AND A HALF to deliver. The wings were cold, and the flavor was short of mediocre. I'm not sure if they didn't care because we already paid the tip for yelp delivery online or what, but we will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Me and my husband were craving wings and found this place on yelp.
Really tiny place, almost missed them. They have two cashiers and both are unprofessional, they didn't greeting us and one of them(girl) was sitting on the stools and eating her dinner at the cashier counter while we were ordering our wings. No ashamed at all. 
We heard \"F\" words from their kitchen while we were waiting our wings.
We didn't feel any welcome or appreciation from them.
Their wings were not bad. We ordered B-1 Bomber 25 wings $20.99 with three kind of sauces, Sweet Chili, Hot Garlic and Spicy Teriyaki. I liked sweet chili sauce.
We had Celery($0.50) for side, they looks like leftover from last night party."}
{"text":"This place can be hit or miss.  Sometimes, the chicken is spot on-perfectly fried with great sauces.  At other times, the boneless wings can be dry and rather tough.  One standout is the parmesan waffle fries.  Rarely do they disappoint (other than your ego when you step on the scale the next day 5 pounds heavier)!  All their sauces are solid and delivery is usually pretty quick.  Even on their worst day, being a sloth and having wings delivered to your door is not a bad thing!"}
{"text":"Decent place to get wings. Convenient with a lot of options for all and they have a lot of very spicy wings. Nothing special though and can be a bit pricey for what it is. The cheese curds are good but the portion is very small. In addition, the fries were decent, but again, small for the price. Not a bad place to go to but nothing spectacular either."}
{"text":"First the delivery was amazing. 20 minutes to my door.  Piping hot. Wings were meaty and tasty. Ranch and cheese dipping sauces were prepackaged and ok. Dry rub wings were very juicy."}
{"text":"Not bad. I've ordered from Wings Over before so I know how it goes. My driver got lost and thought I didn't live in Madison. When the food arrived it wasn't hot anymore, so that definitely impacted the experience. Overall, not bad. Just wouldn't order delivery next time."}
{"text":"Every time I visit my girlfriend, we order Wings Over Madison. It has been at least 20 times and they never disappoint! Their traditional wings are gigantic and always cooked right. They used to have free delivery but just recently changed it which is a bummer. You can't go wrong adding on the waffle fries so you have a crunch along with your wings. Overall, the best Wings in Madison!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Las Vegas and have had a great visit with the local's until calling Wings Over Madison. The young lady that answered the phone was very rude and pushy. I called in to place a order to my hotel. She anwsered the phone \"Wings Over Madison pick-up or delivery\" 
Me: delivery
Rude employee: ok your address?
Me: I'm staying at the...hotel.
Rude employee: well i dont know where that is. And i cant hear you talk up.
Me: ok im sorry (  Clear my throat)
Rude employee: talk up... whats the address( With a deep exhale)
Me: let me pull the address up one moment
Rude employee:   Deep exhale in with a UGH...( Clearly annoyed)
Me: im sorry im not from here... gave address to the hotel.
Rude employee: okay...what do u want? ( clearly annoyed)
Me: Ummm nothing because you r very rude.
Rude employee: (hangs up in my face)"}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! This has been my go-to late-night (or any time) wing joint since I was a freshman, and even though I've moved out of the downtown area, it's still worth a drive! 

Their bone-in wings are big, and they're always generous with the sauce (garlic parmesan, hot garlic, honey bbq are my top faves!). The boneless wings are also massive (like other reviewers said, similar to chicken tenders), and perfectly fried every time. The one thing I find is a hit or miss, is their waffle fries, as sometimes it can be too overcooked and dry, or way too salty. 

Delivery (when I was downtown) was always on time or early, and the food is always still hot when it gets delivered as well. My favorite wing place in Madison, for sure!"}
{"text":"Told y'all I expect AND applaud service. These guys stepped up when I was forced to return for the family order. 

This also proves my point about not reviewing until you've had multiple visits as to give a quantative analysis not simply a subject review with limited basis on measurable standards (umph~ that sounded snobbish - not my intent tho). 

Look, they jacked up a delivery order to the 9th degree. 
Placeed it online. 
Called in to confirm it's understood. 
Clerk calls back to reconfirm what was understood
Delivery guy arrives and BAM it's allllllllll wrong. 
Call back. Manager recalls this order. 
Sends remake, correctly done, via the requested same delivery guy so I can tip better. 
Still no cash. 
Try to run to Walgreens to get cash to tip. 
Driver made it as we were making the run. 
Dang that's fast. 
Still owe driver some money. 
Wings were good. 
Extra costs for heavy/extra sauce. 

You can follow the progress of your order online and they have an app. I didn't download it. TOo many apps nowadays. 

We'll be loyal when we need delivery or late night and didn't get grilled wings from Liliana's."}
{"text":"If the nights going late the answer is WINGS. You better be leaving these fine folks fat tips cuz they are doing this city a service. Personally, have never had a bad experience here. Wings are meaty and tasty - I'm not picky so both boneless and bone-in are great. Loads of sauce and rub options ranging in heats. Cuz I prefer to shamelessly eat wings in the privacy of my own home, I always get my order to-go. Just a heads up for large groups, this establishment is mostly a counter, dining area is fairly small."}
{"text":"Best place for wings in the city not much room to eat in only a few tables usually get them to go wide variety of flavors from mild to hot half a dozen bbq styles some dry rub flavors a few teriyaki I prefer bone in to boneless but both were good sized they also have ribs and sandwiches if you're with someone who doesn't want wings my only complaint is they don't deliver to my house"}
{"text":"Most delivery options in Madison come with high fees and ridiculous turnaround times. Wings Over Madison is the fastest, most reliable delivery service I've used. 

I can get a meal for one for a decent price within about 30 minutes. I usually get the 1/2 lb boneless wings and fries.

{"text":"Wow, now those were some good wings! I got the puddle jumper with cruising altitude and honey BBQ sauce and my girlfriend got the DC-3 with parmesan garlic dry rub. Both were delicious! On top of delicious wings the delivery was quick and the wings were still hot on arrival.

The puddle jumper had 10 of the biggest bone in wings I have ever seen, and were evenly covered in sauce. There was a quit a bit of extra sauce on the bottom so the last few wings were kinda soggy but still real good. The best part is it was plenty of food for me.

The DC-3 had some huge boneless wings, borderline chicken tender size. The rub was tasty and there was plenty of it evenly covering the wings. They had a great flavor however, they were a little chewy maybe just a bit over done? Even with that they were still good and it was plenty of food. 

Overall, we really liked the wings and totally will be getting them again to try all the different flavors. If you're looking for some good wings, give wings over Madison a shot."}
{"text":"Our wings were chewy and fried too long.  Waffle fried overcooked and super crispy.

We ate in, but our food came in a styrofoam container.  Maybe that is why everything was overcooked?  When you put food in styrofoam, it gets soggy.  I just don't understand it...

There is really no seating in the building.  I think there are 2 tables, so expect to pick up and eat your food at home.  It could be so much more, but our experience really fell flat.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"WoM has definitely surprised me. The delivery is always super quick, the wings always meaty and hot, and the waffle fries are a must. We go for the traditional wings typically, usually with Cajun Terayaki, Hot Garlic, Cajun BBQ or Sweet Chili. All are delicious, particularly the Cajun Terayaki and Hot Garlic. The waffle fries are great no matter what seasoning you get, my favorite being garlic parmesan and ranch. Great deal, quick friendly service, yummy food - definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I visited Wings Over when I was in Madison for the first time ever this past weekend.  My friend and I had it delivered on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  I have to say I was thoroughly impressed with this place.  I am a major wing connoisseur and the boneless wings were very fresh and great size (sure beats the dinky ones you get at BWW).  I know they pride themselves on never frozen chicken and freshly breaded in house, and you can tell.  Additionally, tons of sauces to choose from and waffle fries on the menu!  Not only that, but late night delivery...good thing I live in Chicago, otherwise i'd be waking up every Sunday morning, walking out to the living room and saying \"faaacccckkkkkk, well at least the delivery was free\" ...which is a lot more than you can say in Chicago."}
{"text":"Ordered from here on GrubHub. Waited for 2.5 hours for food to even arrive. Called them twice to determine when my food would come and I was hung up on. I only ordered a chicken wrap and a Caesar salad - it should never take 2.5 hours for that delivery. Of course the wrap was cold, mediocre, and probably had spit in it. This service was some of the worst I have ever experienced. I'm still waiting to speak to a manager to get a refund."}
{"text":"As a college student who loves Wings, I would love to see a Wings over LAX in La Crosse :)  Since the closest BWW is in Onalaska, theyd get lots of business I'm sure... and GET IT? LAX like the airport :)  A business venture that I'm sure would pay off..."}
{"text":"Wings are good.  Prices are ok.  the ambiance is....well its not a sit down place.
Staff is freindly but dont expect gleaming countertops or clean....anything.
Do expect delicious wings and quick delivery if you go that route."}
{"text":"Wings over Madison is the place to go for fresh and delicious wings. The quality of the chicken is always really good and all of the different sauces are fun to try- haven't had a bad one yet. The service is always reliable and you can tell they care about their customers."}
{"text":"The deals here are actually quite good, and free delivery is never a bad thing, but I can't rate them that highly due to their rude staff. Don't expect great customer service here, but if you can put up with it, their chicken is worth getting."}
{"text":"Yay!  I'm a fan.

Our lunch golf plans were thrwarted by the course being closed.  Check ahead, folks.  Instead of getting a good walk in, we decided to grab some food.  My buddy suggested Wings over Madison.  I had heard of them and wanted to try 'em, so it was an easy choice at that point.

It's not a big place - primarily for carryout or delivery.  They seemed busy enough with those types of orders.  There are tables (for two) for seating up to 12 or 14, I'd say.

We both ordered the \"Hang Glider\" combo - a half pound of wings, fries and a soda.  I got the \"kickin\" sauce, which was explained to me as a cross between buffalo and bbq.  He was right, and it was excellent.  I'm not a fan of straight buffalo sauce, but the Kickin' sauce had just enough of it in to know it was there, but enough bbq to even it out.  I love them.  Dipping in ranch just made them even better.  The fries were plentiful.  They were the most salty fries I've ever had eating out.  For real.  But I like salty, so I wasn't offended.  I had three ketchup packges buried under my fries and wings - not ideal, but it was there...    Overall, there was PLENTY of food to justify my $10 meal.  Honestly, I'd love a smaller portion for less money, but I get the half-pound increments they work with.  It is what it is.

This place is excellent for getting a big order of food and carrying out.  I just wish I had reason to do that more often!  For a \"go somewhere and have lunch\" option, it's just okay - they just aren't set up with that in mind, but the food is excellent."}
{"text":"When I'm craving wings, I drive over and pick up a batch from Wings Over Madison. There's a couple of small tables and a TV inside but this is mostly a delivery/take-out joint. Wings are good, they have a pretty wide variety of sauces/rubs, and food comes out hot and fast."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets such great reviews.  Maybe it is the after bar delivery that gets the ratings.  I ordered the 1/2 pound of boneless hot garlic.  The wings came soggy due to being drenched in the sauce.  When I say drenched I mean that the container had a half inch of extra sauce in the bottom.   I barley could eat them because all I tasted was sauce.  If they focused on quality instead, this place could be great."}
{"text":"I may have to say this place has the best tasting wings in Madison so far.  They sell by the weight, not by ###.  This is mostly set up for delivery or takeout, not a place for sit-in eating.  There are a few table (about 4), but nothing more.   They offer everything from hot to Bbq to a variety of dry rubs.  Their serving sizes are gracious compared to price.  

A must try if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"I thought it was pretty delicious. I got jamacian jerk, boneless. Sure, one of my \"wings\" was the size almost of a whole breast (it was a bit bigger than being just a tenderloin, I think), but it tasted amazing and the quality of the meat and breading was great; as they say, it's not \"frozen processed\" crap. The sauce was pretty good, too!"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and go to school in Iowa City so I rarely get to have this but I never fail to stop in or get it delivered to my friend's place when I'm in town. Great wings. The sauce is awesome, the chicken is phenomenal, and their fries complement it pretty well. Definitely one of my fav places in Madison."}
{"text":"I am not impressed. Mind you I've only gotten the boneless wings so I can't speak for the other wings, hopefully they're better. 

Boneless wings: too much breading. They should sell them as chicken strips because that's what they are. The sauces are fine but nothing special. The fries are good.

I'd probably give them another chance on their bone-in wings but for boneless BWW is much better."}
{"text":"I thought Wings Over Madison was pretty decent. The wings are a good size, as advertised. There's much more meat on it than at other places that I've been to.

We ordered 25 wings, and we were allowed to get 5 different flavors. We got Hot Garlic, Sweet Chili, Garlic Parmesan, Mustang Ranch, and Texas Mesquite. I loved the Garlic Parmesan and the Sweet Chili. I wasn't a fan of the Hot Garlic - it tasted just like buffalo sauce. I didn't get much of the garlic flavor in there. The dry rubs are really good here.

It was a Saturday before all the college football games, and my order for pick up was ready in 15 minutes. I was surprised! It's a little hard getting here from downtown, given how busy University Ave can be, but that's just a minor hurdle for some good wings."}
