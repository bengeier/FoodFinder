{"text":"My boyfriend and I love sushi and have had many in Charlotte. We thought we tried this one since we bought a groupon for it. This is by far THE worst place I have been for sushi and service. I was disappointed in the food and our server. Took forever to receive our sushi. But what made the night worse was when I showed them my groupon through my app off my phone they refused to take it saying they needed a printed copy to put in the computer. I, being a server myself, and also having to have dealt with groupons couldn't understand why she wouldn't accept my groupon. So we had an argument for 5 minutes. Than my boyfriend asked for a manager and we were told no one was in other than the cashier. GREAT! The cashier calls the manager and comes back to tell me the most she can do is take 20 percent off my tab. Tab was 59.43 and through groupon I had paid 15 for 30 so I was infuriated to say the least. Even showing the damn groupon receipt and what it in tells that I am entitled to she still denied my 30 dollars off. So we told her we will not pay for anything on the tab because now we're being ripped off. Needless to say after 30 minutes of arguing and being chased down they finally took my groupon and we were able to pay. I will NEVER come back here again nor recommend anyone, especially w groupon."}
{"text":"Soooo very good! Ordered takeout and it was both plentiful and fresh! I will return and I do recommend. Thank you Fuji!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant and have never had a bad experience until yesterday when I found a couple hairs in my hibachi chicken meal. I suggest purchasing better hair nets."}
{"text":"It's amazing, and quite surprising, that a restaurant in the mall would be so good! they have fantastic specials on sushi Mondays and Tuesdays  and the wait staff, general manager and bartender are very conscientious to make sure everyone is having a good time. Habachi chefs put on a great show"}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent Fuji approximately once a week. The sushi chefs are awesome guys, as well as the wait staff (while ever-changing). There have been times when service is a bit slow, but it does not warrant me giving them anything short of 5 stars. I wish they were more liberal with their $5 and $10 off coupons like they have been in the past. My wife and I alwasy get the Kani Tempura and Philly Rolls which have never once been disappointing. They also have a jalepeno roll of some sort that's ridiculously good as well with minimal heat. I would DEFINITELY recommend a sushi dinner and hibachi lunch. And yes, their ginger and coconut sauces are outstanding!"}
{"text":"I've been to Fuji many time and the food is consistently good. Love the bento boxes for lunch."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, fabulous hibachi, amazing sushi! Perfect for a night out with friends or family!"}
{"text":"Used a Groupon there, and didn't have any trouble.  The food was pretty good.  I really didn't like the garbage pop music they were playing very loudly.  Personally I didn't enjoy the squirting sake into the mouths of everyone around the table.  Just not classy in my opinion.  My fiance doesn't like the ginger sauce very much and was disappointed that they didn't flip the shrimp into the mouths, which is classier than sake, obviously.  Overall we much prefer Hibachi on the edge of Mentor and Painesville for their food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Don't eat here... found strange substance in fried rice and was offered just a refund!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Food was over cooked. 
I had chicken and it was over cooked and tasteless. Vegetables were over cooked as well. 
Both of our glasses had cracks on the top edge. 
Not at all worth the price"}
{"text":"Do not come to this restaurant with a large group.   A group of us honouring a college graduate had dinner here.  Everyone specifically told the server that we had separate checks.  It went downhill from there.  The drinks were extremely overpriced, and the service was poor.   The food was fair, certainly not good.  After dinner, we requested our checks.  Thats when it got worst.  The server had not tabulated bills for over 30 people, which resulted in our waiting well over half an hour for our bill.   Even after one couple paid there bill, the manager was unaware that they had already paid their bill, would not let them leave.  They had show their receipt at the door to prove to the manager that they paid their bill.  As I was paying my tab, I was told that we (all of us) was responsible if someone did not pay their tab.  Rather than say anything I left; preferring to vent in this forum."}
{"text":"We have been to Fuji a number of times and after tonight's experience I WILL NOT BE BACK!!!  We went there to celebrate my daughter's 4th birthday.  It was not busy and we had 3 young children at the table.  It was 20 minutes before we received drinks, 45 minutes before a chef arrived and 2 hours total before we were able to leave the restaurant.  I had to ask twice for them to sing the birthday song (which was not a song.....they beat a drum).  I had to ask multiple times for plates etc. for cake, asked multiple people for my check and on and on......  HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!  They made no acknowledgement that there was a problem despite that fact that everyone at our table was visually upset."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night for dining in, but we did not sit by the Hbachi table. The food was mediocre at best. For appetizer, my girlfriend and I had the Beef Asparagus, which was asparagus wrapped in thin beef slices. It tasted good, but I had one piece that was not cooked all around. 
For entree, I had an Udon (first one on the Udon list, but I forgot the name) and it was only so-so. It is topped with cabbage, broccoli, shiitake mushroom, chicken, sunny side up egg, imitation crab and tempura shrimp. The combination is a bit random if you asked me.The salad that came with the Udon was soggy and a bit frozen, but the ginger sauce taste delicious. My girlfriend had the Amazing Rolls and gave them warm praises - she said they were a step or two above grocery store sushi.
All in all, dining in at Fuji did not evoke any excitement from me."}
{"text":"Another wonderful experience at Fuji. Not only is the food delicious but the sushi chefs are genuine artists.
Love this place!"}
{"text":"Recently got a to go order and havent been here for a long time, hoping I wouldnt be disappointed like I was the last time.  Unfortunately, all the memories came back of the reason i dont go there regularly.  

I ordered the hibachi chicken.  It was $16 for a to-go dinner.  It came with a salad, soup, chicken, noodles, rice, and veggies.  I guess I paid for the quantity and not the quality.  The salad was just iceberg thrown in a container.  The soup was ok.  The rice was not what I ordered, I got fried instead of white, so my comments on that are skewed  pretty negatively.  The chicken was dry and had not been seasoned at all, so even with the sauces given it was hard to eat the whole thing.  

So im not sure if the experience is better at the hibachi table itself, but the take out is not nearly worth the price.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Average. Nothing to write home about but food was decent. Dining room was filthy and table was sticky and dirty."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and i came here for a quick lunch one day the food was prepared quicker than expected and still tasted fresh and delicious. we only had some rolls, soup and beer so it was over too soon.  The staff was friendly and everyone chipped in to help- service was excellent, They even gave us $5 off coupon for our next visit! The decor was nice, it had an Asian feel  with some modern flair. this place provides great value for the dollar and great service, it left me wondering what there hibachi dinner experience is like...looking forward to next time i get to come here...."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing,foods is so delicious,chefs are excellent ,nice service,love this place!!!"}
{"text":"The service is great even on busy nights, high quality food, and my favorite go to sushi and hibachi place!!!"}
{"text":"Went out to try this place last night, it took us almost an hour to get a table which was fine since we went during busy hours. Our server doesn't speak english well and had a hard time understanding us. We order four hibachi grill plates and two sushi dishes. We never got our sushi dishes and at the end of our meal we figure they would not charge us, but we got charged for our sushi. We told the waiter that we did not get our sushi and was not going to pay for it; that's when they brought our sushi plate to us. My friends did not want to throw a scene so we took it to go and they offer us $10 off our next meal, however we need to go back in like two weeks to use that $10 off coupon. We also didn't get a lot of refills or condiments that we requested for. Overall the hibachi dish was okay, the fried rice was good compare to other steakhouse places. However the sushi was not good at all for the price you had to pay and service sucks if you are in the dining area that is."}
{"text":"Love the sushi bar here, the staff is accommodating and friendly. It's our local go to place for sushi and hibachi. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I frequent Fuji every Friday basically call in a take out when I leave work and pick it up 10 mins later. Their sushi is fresh and clean. Their spicy tuna is actually spicy and never fishy tasting. Masago is my addiction and it never taste like it's been sitting around for weeks. I love Fuji because they don't deep fry or cover their sushi in goopy sauces to try and cover up low quality food. They use the best and that's why it's so good. And their lunch specials are a steal!!"}
{"text":"I am a BIG fan of their sushi!  The server was very helpful explaining the menu...very good.  I have not tried the hibachi side yet but it always seems busy over there so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Fuji on Aug 22 2010. Food was good Service was ok. I check my bank statement when I find out i was charge TWICE. I called them to inform them of problem and Guy who answer the phone was RUDE. He pretty much called me a liar. This kind of attiude is uncalled for. If you go to Fuji keep eyes on your credit card statement/bank statement. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"I have only been to this restaurant for their half-price sushi specials and I always go for lunch. That being said, the sushi is AWESOME! The fish tastes fresh,  the rice is always well cooked, the portions are large by comparison to other local sushi places and you can't beat the half price deals. It's never busy on Monday afternoons so I've never experienced any excessively loud music and my servers have always been friendly. I've read that those things aren't necessarily true in the evening but lunch is always pleasant :)"}
{"text":"It was OK, nothing awful, nothing grand.

I think the hibachi entrees are way overpriced, considering the amount of actual protein you got in the end...with 7 adults at a grill (being cornily entertained), who all got hibachi combos of steak, scallops, shrimp or chicken, in the end, not much food.

So, for $18-22 a person, about a cup of veggies at most, a cup of cubed meat, and then 2 cups' worth of fried rice and a cup of wonton noodles. Rip off ultimately.

Also, ordering any non-alcoholic drinks is a glass rammed full of ice cubes, so a refill is only about 3/4-cup of actual liquid.

It was ok in the end, I guess I'd return, but if I never did, nothing lost."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. The food is pretty good , lots of choices. The atmosphere is very fun. Great place for a large group or birthday party."}
{"text":"Come hungry!!! I had the steak and shrimp which was very good. The cook really does a good job of involving everyone. Even my 4 year old had a blast. I also had a black Mia tai to drink and it was pretty strong. It is a good time and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The first couple of times i went to this restaurant were pretty good, but last night was awful. Horrible service, I could barely understand what the waiter said, and apparently he did not understand us either. I ordered a chicken teriyaki dinner with some california rolls, the sushi was good, the chicken teriyaki though? I have had MUCH BETTER it just tasted like some regular chicken breast with some type of sauce on it, I was not impressed at all and was not worth $12. Afterwards, we decided to get some dessert, we ordered cheesecake, and after waiting like 10 minutes for it, it was practically frozen, could barely put my spoon through it. Had to ask for refills, and kept having to ask the waiter for things rather than him offering or coming to check on us, will never be going back there don't waste your money."}
{"text":"The hibachi here is the best I've had in Charlotte! I don't like zucchini, but I ate all my vegetables because the seasoning was so tasty. I didn't have anything left on my plate after my meal and left feeling very satisfied. I recommend this place to anyone that likes Japanese hibachi."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever encountered by any restaurant. After asking to order 2 kids meals with 2 kids with me - they outright refused!  Said I could only order 1 kids meal & could not take the extra food home with me.  No food could be ordered to go if I wanted to order extra to take home with me. Rude servers & even rudder management. Would not ever recommend this restaurant to even my worst enemy!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so yes this place is in Great Lakes Mall, but don't let that fool you because this is one of the better Japanese restaurants I've been to in awhile, and by far the best you'll find in the Mentor area!

Upon entry, you have two options - hibachi table or regular dining.  Both are fantastic so it all really depends on what kind of mood you're in.  If you're there to have fun, then sit your butt down on the hibachi side - you're in for a real treat!  

If you take the dive and head for the hibachi side, get ready for not only a show but also a ton of noise.  The music can get loud, if someone has a birthday then they play this crazy techno (i'm not sure that's even it), high-speed version of the birthday song while a laser light show takes place. Also beware that this side can get packed so just human noise is enough to make you go a little crazy.  BUT fear not - the chef cooking your food comes prepared with a squeeze bottle of sake for squirting in your mouth - this helps ease the noise and disorientation you may feel from everything else going on.  Lastly, you at least won't be disappointed with the food - there are plenty of options to choose from and you can order from the dining room menu as well.

Now if you've chosen to take the safe route and eat in the regular dining area then you're in for a much more relaxed dining experience.  You can still hear the commotion from the hibachi party but it's not much of a distraction unless you pay attention.  SO now I get to the point of my review where I give this place 4 stars instead of 3 - the food, especially the sushi.  I've never been here and had a bad meal and can say that the sushi is actually very good and there are a ton of taste bud satisfying options.

So whether you're looking for a little fun and entertainment or a place to relax and get your sushi on, this is definitely the place to do it."}
{"text":"I've gone here three times now, despite the negative reviews I've seen. I've been in the dining room twice and went for hibachi once. I will say that I enjoyed our experience with the hibachi staff far more than the dining room. Our most recent visit was the past Saturday, and our waitress took our drink order of 2 waters and was gone for nearly 15 minutes. However,  of entrees were out quickly after placing our orders, this was unfortunately over shadowed by our waitresses seemingly negative attitude. When we went to the hibachi side in April our part had a blast and the food was great. I'm giving 4 stars because our 2 other visits were enough to counter act one negative encounter with one waitress."}
{"text":"Had a great dining experience. Food was fresh and nice portion. The hostess greatest us when we arrived and set the tone for a great dining experience. 

Our hibachi cook was friendly and knowledgable. New well prepared."}
{"text":"Fuji was alright.  I ordered a Hibachi dinner, which came with soup, salad, a couple pieces of shrimp, noddles and rice and your choice of meat.  The soup was good, but was really only a broth with three tiny fresh mushrooms and some green onion.  If it had more shrooms it would have been much better. The salad was no good.  It was smothered in a ginger dressing.  Too much ginger is never a good thing (ask Carrot Top).
     
I also split some sushi as an appetizer.  We ordered the Fantastic roll, which has deep fried spicy tuna, among other things that i cannot remember most likely due to the 6 sake bombs I was treated to, and the Hibachi cook squirting sake into my mouth straight from the bottle as he cooked. Whoops! I didn't even plan on drinking.  Anyway...the sushi was really good.  Actually it was the highlight of my meal. 
     
My main course, which was Hibachi scallops, was nothing to yelp home about.  The flavors were bland, and the veggies weren't fresh.  The cook was quasi-entertaining, but his food was quasi-crappy, even after 6 sake bombs. Although I'm sort of putting the 'F' 'U' in Fuji, I finished my whole plate, but I would not order another Hibachi meal again.  But... I would go back to try more sushi from their youge (aka huge) selection."}
{"text":"The food is good for Hibachi but the turnover rate here is awful so servers are always almost new and clueless... the food isn't good enough for the carefree zero Fs given attitude the hostess and management has.  They don't care about your business and there is no one to complain about it to, they repeatedly overcrowd tables and refuse to seat because time for lunch ending is constantly changing!  I've dealt with this so many times and rushed to the restaurant to make lunch but today was turned away for the last time!! Won't be back!!"}
{"text":"Eating at Fuji was a bland experience. The food was bland and aside from my dining partner there is nothing bout this restaurant that would make me come back. Don't waste your time or money there are better spots to enjoy! Really!!!"}
{"text":"My brother and I went here all the time, before my sis got breast cancer.  We love sitting at the sushi bar, and trying different rolls.  The sushi chef is really great, and knows what he's doing.  The owner will come by occasionally, and spots you a cocktail.  Always nice.  The habachi side is fun, but pretty basic.  If you have people that aren't sure they like Japanese food, go for the hibachi.  Basically meat, rice, and veg, with some nice entertainment."}
{"text":"Awesome service !! Sweet lunch menu sushi deal.  
 Calm relaxed environment !!   Was not a huge fan of the miso soup but will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Went to Fuji for their sushi special on Monday. service was pretty good, took a little long to receive the food but once but did arrive the sushi was phenomenal! I would recommend going on an \"off\" day so that it is quiet while dining. all in all, pretty good place!"}
{"text":"Visited Fuji last night with my in-laws, including my sister-in-law who was in town with my young niece and nephew. I have actually been a waitress at this type of hibachi steakhouse before, back in college, so I knew exactly what to expect, and Fuji definitely met my expectations.

We all did the hibachi grill menu for the show, which finally got the kids' attention away from their Leapfrog and iTouch and onto the chef. They were mesmerized by all the elements of the cooking. I made it a point to ask for the \"kids chopsticks\" which are a chopstick set that's got rubber bands and a \"fulcrum\" made from the chopstick wrapping paper so that kids can use it to eat their food without having to have as much dexterity as an adult. The only thing I could suggest is that maybe these could be offered to any table with youngsters eating without someone having to ask? I only knew these existed because I had made them many times in my job, and everyone at the table was surprised and happy when the kids got their own set of usable chopsticks. We made a big deal out of them using their \"chopsticks\" and in doing so actually got the picky eaters to eat more than they might have otherwise.

The menu is the usual basic hibachi experience: miso soup, salad with ginger dressing (ranch is also available), a shrimp \"appetizer\", vegetables, rice and meat. This restaurant also had noodles that they cooked which were delicious. I've never really been a fan of noodles in Asian cuisine (or anywhere in general) but I ate all of mine quickly.

The service was quick, the food was good, the \"show\" was good, and we had a great time. I should note that Sunday night at 6:30 is a great time to bring kids as the two in our party were able to make a little bit of their usual noise, but were drowned out by the sounds of the fan, and there was at least one child of their age or younger at each of the other tables, so I wasn't terribly worried about noise or inconveniencing other patrons.

Fuji didn't stand out particularly for any one thing, but they delivered a solid meal for all of us quickly. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fuji is a great local place to get some good sushi.  We have eaten a lot of sushi in the last 25 years, basically in California and places we travel. This is a good quality sushi, close to home with some unique rolls.  The sweetheart roll (with soy paper) is my favorite, the presentation is really nice too.  Everything is fresh and some of the specialty rolls have tasty combinations. The atmosphere is not like a \"mall\" restaurant.  Once you get in the doors, you forget that you are at Great Lakes Mall.  They have private booths, where they pull a little curtain or sit at the sushi bar and watch your sushi being prepared.  The service is friendly and every so often a Birthday song will blast through the restaurant as the servers all join in to wish a diner a \"happy birthday\".  It is fun to also eat at the Hibachi grill (where the quantity and quality is also good), there your server will join you in a Sake Bomb. On the Tuesday special Sushi night, I feel the selection of rolls are too limited.  I would rather order from the ala carte sushi menu and get exactly what you want.  Enjoy !!"}
{"text":"I checked them out online and found two rolls on their menu. I found the \"Latin heat roll\" ($10.50) and the \"tempura kani roll\"($5.50) my brother was on his way to the mall anyway, so I wrote down my order and sent him on his way. When he got home, they had given him two rolls that were nothing like what was on the website, also charging him $20.45, instead of the $16 I had planned on paying. They gave him a \"sweetheart roll\" and some type of tempura roll where he was given the option of shrimp or chicken. When I called the restaurant to ask what was in the \"sweetheart roll\" and explained what had happened the guy on the phone (who I could barely understand) told me to bring the food back. I also asked if I would be getting my change back due to the price difference. Instead of them remaking my food, I decided on a refund. I am not one to ever complain about my order, EVER! I myself am in the customer service industry. The fact that the guy on the phone was rude, and could not even tell me what was in the rolls made me decide to NEVER order from them again."}
{"text":"The food at Fuji is delicious ! They are always really packed on the weekends. 

The only thing that doesn't give this store a 5 star is the customer service ! The people at Fuji are not the nicest. The waitresses are in a rush to get you in and out. If you ask for more sauce they have an attitude. 

Also, if you are not a kid you cannot get a kids portion here. They are very mean about it as we'll. Not very nice people."}
{"text":"My food as well as my friends food was undercooked. They still charged us as well ask did not care if we ever turned or not. The manager told me \"we never have complaints, and we get all kinds of business\". What did that have to do with my uncooked food today."}
{"text":"Have been there for lunch and dinner.  Always good food.  Every experience has been excellent except once when we were seated with an obnoxious man.  Not the restaurants fault but an uncomfortable meat none the less.  Better than Nakato or Kubuto, newer so cleaner appearing and the food is oh so good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Really fun!  Terrific for kids. Food was so-so. The service wasn't great. I had to remind them several times to bring my appetizer and my daughter's rice. When dishing out the veggies to everyone at the hibachi table,they really skimped on my daughters portion which was annoying since we were paying just as much (she got an adult meal). Then they cooked my hibachi veggies in the kitchen (I didn't want it cooked on the same table as the shrimp) and they brought me out a plate of zucchini. I sent it back and asked for .... what i actually ordered - the veggies that included broccoli, mushrooms, onions ... what everyone else at the table had on their plates.  I get the cultural thing/communication gap- whatever, but not acknowledging or apologizing (the waitress just looked at my plate and laughed) just bugged me.  Anyway, I'd go back for the experience because it really was fun and a great ambiance (dark, loud, disco-y, great for a kid's bday) but I'd hope for a better food experience. I hate sending food back. It's embarrassing!!"}
{"text":"I would NOT recommend this place as it is overpriced and does not match the portion I received. I typically go here for convenience but after my last experience where they \"nickel and dime\" you for additional sauces but if I were at the location dining in it would be completely different. I rather go elsewhere and drive farther out where I am not being overcharged for something as simple as an extra condiment."}
{"text":"This place is everything I was hoping and more.  We love watching the food network, it has some contests with hibachi chefs so we wanted to go for the entertainment...we were not disappointed, our chef put on a great performance with excellent food.  The service was great.  The other reviewer mentioned about the birthday thing being bad, it wasn't.  Someone was there for their birthday and it only lasted maybe 5 minutes....No worse then a Friday's type of thing.  Over all I would highly recommend going here.  Just to warn people that don't like the birthday thing, I am going back in February for mine."}
{"text":"Decent hibachi. Nothing crazy exciting. They have the usual volcano onion, food in hat, ketchup with the string. One thing that I would recommend is to call ahead. I called 15 minutes before we showed up. We walked in past a series of pissed people, got a few mean looks and enjoyed dinner.  I would come back if I happened to be in Steele Creek."}
{"text":"Had a group reservation for two weeks.  No problem for the group coordinator for the the group until 2 days before the day.  Then told Big Party ( who shall remain nameless) made a reservation for a big group.  You are cancelled.  Finally ended up in too small area for group.  Ok, working with everything.  Then tried to order carry out for my husband who couldn't make it ( ordered three different tmes).  Finally got it after a group delay.  The kicker was the sashimi when eaten (20 min. later) was still frozen!   Live in the area..bad experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I come to Fuji almost every week - we LOVE this place. The sushi is the best in the city. The sushi chefs and servers are always so friendly and welcome us back. We highly recommend the Amazing & Caterpillar rolls. And don't forget the shrimp sauce!"}
{"text":"They waiters are very clumsy and don't really know how to explain the menu. They are also very rude and we're basically rushing us out. It's very dark and I couldn't even tell what I was eating. Food is decent. But it took about half an hour for our food to come out though.. and our server kept messing us the orders."}
{"text":"Have been here many times and today was my last time I will visit here. The service is the absolute worst, these people have no business working in a restaurant. We stood at the register waiting to be seated for at least 3 or 4 minutes while the girl behind the counter just stood there. Then we were seated but nobody even came to our table for over 10 minutes, the waitress walked by us but never even got our drink order. The food has always been OK at best, nothing to brag about and the service has always been horrible. No more Fuji for me"}
{"text":"Omg, this place was gloomy, empty and had no character or excitement. I tried to take my date somewhere new and these people had no motivation to do anything. I waited a long ass time for our main course (Which we didn't receive). I got up after about 40 minutes and decided to leave. The sorry ass excuse she gave me for the wait was the table needed to heat up. They didn't check on us and they didn't want to start on our table since they wanted to wait for more customers. Well that didn't happen. And the only group in the place besides us had a coupon which they didn't let them use. Hmmm.. Maybe because they just have no customers and wanna milk them for all they had. Totally disappointed in the customer service here. Only after we decided to leave the Chef coincidentally appeared. If your looking for a classy place to take your date or a great time for friends this isn't it. Save yourself the hassle and go to a more reputable place. It's a shame I can't give negative stars. I honestly have no idea how they are still in business. Don't believe me? Go at your own risk."}
{"text":"Came here with the birthday girl, my niece. This was her choice. We were a party of 9. Was given a 20-30 wait time, it was almost an hour. Our chef did very minimal entertainment. Food was ok. Portions were ok. Drinks (alcohol) was great, Arnold Palmer was horrible...watered down and not sweet. I didn't order it but everyone else in the group did. Glad I didn't. In the pics I posted you can see how \"light\" in color they were. Nope, not water in those glasses folks. Lol They did honor my Yelp check in 50%off appitizer. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Fuji has become one of our regular go-to places when we're craving Japanese (which is often).  I do try to get something different each time, but I am a big fan of the spider roll, and theirs is especially delicious--I can't resist.  It's great for lunch or dinner, and the hibachi show is a lot of fun--and delicious!  

Service is always friendly, attentive and quick.  I will go back again and again."}
{"text":"Had 7 people was told 40 min wait.  Ok no prob with a big crowd waited an hour and a half still no table we ended up walking out with never eating!  Food smelled good.  Not sure if we will ever return."}
{"text":"Average food. Servers are always in a rush and not really friendly. Owner is not really friendly too. Upon asking for hot sauce they said they were out of hot sauce. How can an asian place be out of hot sauce? I think the chicken wasn't well cooked too. I had upset stomach the next day. California rolls also did not feel fresh. Their are lots of other hibachi places in the area."}
{"text":"We're not eating soy, carbs, or sugars which makes eating at restaurants very difficult.  Fuji was extremely accommodating and cooked me hibachi chicken with vegetables using only butter and garlic.  The taste was amazing and I can't tell you how much I appreciate them going the extra mile to work with my dietary limitations.  The cook graciously cooked my meal separately to keep out soy and sugar.  The food was SO good!  THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place... I don't know if they're under new management or what.... their sushi is skimpy on the fish and way overpriced. They were extremely rude and we will NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"Our favorite hibachi grill in the area. Always great service and great food.   It is also one of our favorite sushi places around."}
{"text":"First time visit to this establishment not what I expected. You felt like you were rushed on what to order the waiter took are drink order then all the sudden she returned wanting to take are order. One thing I did not like was how the wait staff was walking back and forwith trying to get us to leave so they can clean the table. 

   One thing I notice in plain view of the public/customers is a message to all employees and it seems kinda rude on how they put or word the memo. If I did not have the staff breathing down my neck and watching I would of taken a picture but it was kind of rude and disrespectful. I probably will not return in the near future it was not easy to find at all.....

FYI incase anyone wondering what I had. I just randomly pick something off the menu hope for the best and it was ok but I heard the other meals were not so great. Oh FYI anyone from the health department or management is reading this your bathrooms can be clean a whole lot better."}
{"text":"I DO NOT LIKE THIS PLACE! 

Not because of bad food, or poor service, but because of the perverse chefs. I have been here on 2 occasions that I was sexually harassed by the chefs. I am not being dramatic, I was genuinely insulted and disrespected. I like having fun and joining in on the sake fun. But when I open my mouth for the squirt I don't need them to remark on the size of my mouth and tell my boyfriend he is a lucky guy. They INTENTIONALLY missed my mouth and squirted sake all over my breasts. This is not a rap video, I do not appreciate my dinner turning into a impromptu wet T-shirt contest! 

The crass jokes, and inappropriate remarks continued for the rest of the meal. So much to the point where my date had to tell them I was a lady, and I deserved to be treated with respect. I can take a joke but they went WAY too far. I was humiliated, demeaned, and sexualized to the point when my meal was done I got it to go so I could escape the uncomfortable situation

On a second visit it happened again when I was with a work party. My co-workers were mortified and embarrassed for me. This is not a one -sided I was being too sensitive rant. It happened twice to me here and both times the other people in my party commented on how grossly inappropriate they were.

It was really loud there and I was surrounded by a bunch of drunk hollering men. I will never return. What's worse when I called to tell the management they told me they would correct them but did nothing to rectify my embarrassment, horror, and disgust."}
{"text":"More like a bar, great music, nice lighting, kinda funky for a Japanese restaurant 

the food was ok, pretty good but not as good as the environment.  i had teriyaki seafood and it was way too salty.  my friends ordered hibachi...it was ok, but a little burnt.  i guess u can't help it coz it's hibachi.  

spicy tuna rolls were average.  

in general, the staff were pretty attentive.  the guy doing the hibachi was a little condescending and annoyed me. 

overall it feels like it was plenty of food, but food wasn't that impressive...average overall"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  We called in our order for pick up and they told us it would be 20 minutes, however we show up at this time and our food was said to not be ready, which was fine so we take a seat.  25 minutes later and watching everyone else get their food,  we ask again how much longer, they check a bag that's been sitting on the counter the entire time and of course it was ours. We waited around for nothing while our food was getting cold in the bag. 

I ordered the chicken and shrimp. Which was all over cooked.  The chicken had no flavor and was extremely chewy.  The shrimp was tough. However, the vegetables felt under cooked because they were still hard.  My salad was sitting in box filled with water,  so the lettuce became soggy.  Really the best thing about my meal was the fried rice and soup. 

I don't know if I'll be trying this place for a long time or at least until I forget this experience."}
{"text":"Lunch prices are great.  Soup, salad, and your main Hitachi meal for under $15, not much more than the mall food court.  The staff is always nice and realities to help when they see my elderly mother.  Chris (Hitachi chef) has a great sense of humor."}
{"text":"I would only suggest eating hibachi there. I've never had a problem with the hibachi. How ever the sushi can be a bit over priced for the quality and taste. I went in on a Wednesday night before the dinner rush and for some reason our server did not bring our sushi out in time. I stared at our plates sitting in the window for at least 30 mins. (We were sitting in front of the sushi bar) After telling my sister that was our order she insisted that it wasn't, considering the fact that out server hasn't  touched it or anything like that. Before you know she brings the exact same plates I've been staring at for the longest to our table. By this point I'm utterly upset because not only she took a long time to bring the sushi she somehow dropped one next to my foot. If I had known that was going to happened I would have gotten up myself and brought it to our table. The other thing that was but annoying was the fact that my cousin ordered a simple side salad to go with her meal nothing to crazy.. She never got it. But our server gave me a salad because she dropped my sushi. Not the best experience I've had there. I don't think I will ever go back for their sushi. But I would for their hibachi possible Togo next time. I wouldn't dine in at all.  We came in at 5:10 and did not leave till 7:15."}
{"text":"If you're looking for sushi or a Benihana experience, this is the place to go. Definitely not as expensive as Benihana and well worth it. The food is good, not spectacular though I can't speak to the raw sushi because I'm a California Roll only kind of girl. :)"}
{"text":"this place has the best of both worlds...Hibachi and Sushi Bar.  You can choose to sit on either side or eat on the Hibachi side and be served Sushi with your guests.  They have private booths that are enclosed for romance. But be sure to make reservation for those as I believe there are only 6 booths. Their Sushi is very fresh and they have a wide verity. They are priced the same as most others but they recently have add Mondays as, ALL DAY- ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI. and Tuesday as, ALL YOU CAN EAT HIBACHI. They are packed with a waiting list every weekend, so get there early or be patient. It's worth it! Try the sweetheart roll if your on a date. It comes presented in heart shapes.  You could add a engagement ring in the middle and propose with that dish and it would have \"wow factor\"! FYI"}
{"text":"I recently went to visit some friends in Cleveland and they suggested Fuji to get some good sushi. Once we arrived I was initial hesitant because it was located in a mall. Upon walking inside I was blinded by bright colorful lights in a overall dark restaurant. It reminded me of going to a rave when I was younger. If your epileptic, please stay away, not joking. 

We chose to not sit at the hibachi tables, which later on I discovered was a fantastic choice. We sat in these very large booths that were mostly covered and had Japanese noren (curtains) draped over the opening. It felt very much like a traditional Japanese restaurant once we were seated.

The wait staff was very prompt and helpful. The menu was very large and I had trouble deciding what to get. I ended up ordering a few rolls off of the specials menu. I ordered the Playboy roll and the Dinosaur roll, along with a few nigiri. 

I soon discovered why we didn't sit at the hibachi tables. EXTREMELY loud music started playing. It was their \"birthday song\", which was a mix of karaoke, techno, and the happy birthday song. It was very obnoxious, and too loud. They played it a minimum of 3 times while we were there, and it really irritated us. 

That being said, it was about the only only thing I didn't like about Fuji. The sushi came quickly and was beautifully decorated and WOW'd everyone at the table. The Dinosaur roll came with a flashing light in the middle, which was almost annoying, but gave it the wow factor and I ended up enjoying it. The sushi was fresh and unique. 

I would recommend Fuji to anyone look for some good sushi, I can't rate the Hibachi because I didn't try it (and glad I didn't due to the music)."}
{"text":"I have been on both the hibachi side and the sushi dining side.  Both were wonderful meals.  I've been numerous times for hibachi and it is always packed, so I'd recommend a reservation.  The sushi is fresh and delicious, and presented beautifully.  I highly recommend it if you are curious.  Great fresh sushi, and delicous hibachi.  Of course the hibachi chefs are very talented and always provide entertainment as well.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and already starving and love a GOOD Hibachi. This place is not it!  For one, it's pretty dim in here even during daytime. I can agree with the other reviewers, that the service was lackluster and rushed. Also, the prices did not match the quality of the food. We have NO problem paying for any good vittles. Food was just not seasoned at all. At least sprinkle some salt on the chicken and beef.  They also put egg in the rice a a la Chinese joints. We've never had that at the Hibachi dinners we've frequented. *shrugs* Only wish we could have ordered the kids meal for less of a dent in our pockets. The chef's act also seemed abnormally forced. I get it-must be pretty mundane to feign excitement for the same fire tricks. Just an all-around strange experience. We would have fared better getting some chicken tenders at Hubee D's and could have saved 40 bucks!  Better luck and NOT a next time here."}
{"text":"Fuji ruined my birthday.  They advertise a free birthday dinner, but it comes with plenty of strings attached that they don't tell you about upfront.  We spent a good half hour battling with them over the check, and it completely ruined the mood.  If you plan on going here instead of the Hibachi near the Target for your B-day, be aware of the following things:  

-You MUST have at least 2 people together on the same check.  Even though I brought several other people with me, they wouldn't give us my birthday discount without them being on the same check.  
-They're also going to bring you fried ice cream with sparklers (which was admittedly cool) but they're going to charge you $5 for it without telling you ahead of time.  

By the time we left, we were so frustrated that we skipped the activities we had planned afterwards.

Now, any time we want sushi, we drive to Lure, or go to China Buffet.  As good as it is, we aren't willing to risk that terrible of service ever again."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Asked them to sing happy birthday to someone in our group. Even though we told them who and it was a surprise our waitress walks up to the table and says in front of everyone \"who's birthday is it\". Then they came out to sing and also brought out a scoop of ice cream with candles and charged us $6 for it. They wouldn't let us use a coupon and even thought we tipped the hibachi cook the waitress told us she wanted a bigger tip because she had to share with him. We always tip 20% but I expect to have a friendly waitress and not have extras on the bill we didn't ask for."}
{"text":"Poor service. Stood at the door for 2 minutes before the cashier greeted us, we were in plain sight. She sat as at a table near a window that had an infestation. Ants were crawling up the wall next to our table. It's summer time and it happens, but I was appalled when I saw them sit another family there. Also, do not go here past 8pm. They will interrupt your meal to switch refill the soy sauce bottles. This was not the first time we had a poor experience and I still wanted to give them another shot, but I will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! One of the best hibachi restaurants I've ever eaten at. Also very reasonably priced. For $24, I got soup, salad, veg, fried rice, noodles, a shrimp side, chicken, and steak. A great value. However, the service here is not so great. I come here frequently, and every time there has been some issue. Tonight was the worst yet. My party of four was seated at a table where five others were already seated. Before we even took our seats, the waitress was handing us menus and told us to \"hurry up and order because these people have been waiting for a long time\". I thought this was a strange thing to say since there were open tables and there was no reason for this table to have been waiting for us to come. The second issue came after the chef finished cooking. He had not even finished cleaning and wheeled his cart away when the waitress came around to ask if we wanted boxes. For the food we had gotten not even five minutes ago. I gave this a pass, because I thought maybe she was just trying to be proactive to make sure we had boxes when we were ready. Unfortunately, after she finished passing out boxes, she then started handing out checks. I had not even eaten 1/2 of my food, and I'm a fast eater . The whole thing was rushed, as she stood at our table waiting for our credit cards. Five stars for the food, one star for the service, hence the three star review. Come here for delicious food, but don't expect excellent service."}
{"text":"Our party of five arrived around 2:15 and we ordered our drinks shortly after. After receiving our drinks we mulled over the menu for a few minutes before ordering several items from the lunch menu. The waitress took our orders and subsequently took our menus. Several minutes later she returns to the table and informs us that lunch ended at 2:30, gave us our menus back, and left so that we may order from the dinner menu.

When she came back, a member of our party let her know that we were seated before 2:30 and ordered our drinks as well. Our food order was only taken at around 2:35. The waitress left to speak with someone only to come back and tell us they would not be able to honor the lunch menu specials. We simply asked for our check for our drinks (all fountain drinks), paid, and left.

All in all, it was a really crappy experience. Fuji had been one of my families favorite restaurants for close to 8 years. While the food has never disappointed, the service in retrospect has steadily gone downhill. I don't believe we would ever go back, especially given that so many other Japanese/Sushi restaurants with more reasonable pricing have cropped up in the area."}
{"text":"The hibachi looked alright but easily the worst sushi I've ever had.  They shouldn't sell it. Got salmon and tuna and both were that ground up mush that is almost certainly not the advertised fish on the menu. Didn't even give me soy sauce or chopsticks or napkins for my take out."}
{"text":"A little different than a NY hibachi but very good quality food.  Always crowded after 6 so get there a little before.   We have been here a few times now but always a great meal."}
{"text":"Had reservations thru Yelp, but Fuji had no record of it! Hostess rude. I received a confirmation from Yelp! The place is filthy, paint missing from the walls, over all just plain filthy and disgusting! Food was blah! Ugh....never again!"}
{"text":"I got the Hibachi even though I didn't do the hibachi seating show, So much good and tasty food, I took over half home for lunch tomorrow. Broth soup, salad, rice, noodle, vegetable and tender juicy filet mignon, with two shrimp appetizer. Even with the place being packed, and others coming in. The food arrived quickly and hot! I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting Hibachi style dinner, or sushi. Next time I will take a pic."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened. My parents lived this place and we constantly ate here for dinner. 
Their options and quality of food is good and not as generic as others.
The prices are usual for a Japanese steak house. 
This place can get packed and you can tell they are understaffed at times. There has been plenty of times where we are already seated and spend way too long waiting on a chef."}
{"text":"Great food.  Meh service  Asian service lacks warmth or manners. Not the greatest experience. Go somewhere else for good friendly service"}
{"text":"Good consistent service and good food. Their lunch specials are reasonable and they usually have a good show at the hibachi grill."}
{"text":"The sushi is excellent. Drinks are outrageously priced. For a middle of the road shot of captain Morgan or Jack Daniels you're paying $8! The service isn't good aside from a couple exceptions. Aaron and I think Dominic, for servers. The only friendly attentive bartender is Jessica. They need to adjust the prices and well dine in. Take out for late night sushi cravings for now."}
{"text":"The show is just ok, the kids like it.     I have no idea why this place usually has a wait.

The food is overpriced for the quality.
Everything just tastes like soy sauce."}
{"text":"I went to Fuji and really enjoyed the food I had the shashimi and my wife had the hibachi chicken. The shashimi was beautifully presented and very good. My wife also enjoyed her meal. It was a little om the expensive side but very good none the less. Also the fish tank is very nice to look at."}
{"text":"The food was edible. I liked the area also. The Tempura Shrimp Sushi was okay after i drowned it in the spicy dip. I didn't like the fact that it was lunch hour and they only had 2 chef's for the hibachi stations, so we had to opt to regular table seating. The yum yum sauce was okay..I've had better.."}
{"text":"I've been to Fuji for the hibachi lunch four times and each time was a great experience! The food was excellent, especially for the price."}
{"text":"We showed up hungry and ready to eat. We walked inside and were seated in this EXTREMELY hot room. They took our orders for drinks and both me and my dad went to the bathroom. When we got back we still had no drinks. We sat and waited and began to sit in basically a puddle of our sweat. We still had no drinks. We were so miserable and decided to leave. Overall, a horrible experience"}
{"text":"It's hard to enjoy your hibachi meal when more then half the people seated at your table are complaining. I don't think it's wise to come to a hibachi restaurant and expect express service. If you're looking for quick I'd suggest one of those hibachi express places in the outlets or off yorkmount road. The grill was not preheated when we arrived so after waiting for the table to fill up and waiting for the grill to get hot it probably was about 30min before the chef started to cook. The guy was a bit clumsy and one of his spatulas actually hit a lady sitting at the table (trick gone bad). After that he was trying to do his routine but the other customers at the table were less then nice and requested he not do anymore tricks and just cook the food. Besides a crapppy atmosphere due to the people seated at the table with me, the food was good. I ordered chicken and shrimp hibachi and I also got a California roll. My sister ordered coconut shrimp (4 pieces) was a bit over $6 while I think a bit overpriced they were good. I would return but maybe at a busier time when they are more prepared?"}
{"text":"The sushi is ok, the bento box is good, but the service is suuuuuuper slowwwww. I would suggest skipping unless you have a serious hankering for 30 mins for your simplest meal"}
{"text":"This is the best Japanese steakhouse on the south side of town, without having to deal with the Pineville traffic.  The place is modern with hibachi grill tables, a sushi bar, or you can sit at a regular old table and get some great Japanese food.  Lunch prices as mentioned before are very cheap, even for the teppanyaki experience.  The sushi is great and they make it quickly - even to go, so it's better and fresher than the stuff at Harris Teeter in the case."}
{"text":"This is a great steakhouse to go to. Today is my birthday and the lady here was awful and was rude while taking the orders and my drink was always empty. Although the food was amazing and i loves my filet!!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but a little pricy for what you get.  Front of the house can be less than accommodating.  Showed for our reservation at 7 waiting 30 minutes and still not seated.  There are open tables but still we wait, hungry. Begging to give you our money but still we are treated like we owe them something.  I usually don't complain but the attitude we are receiving is unprofessional and insulting when we ask how much longer.  Understandable if it was Friday or Saturday but it's Tuesday night.  Please fix the front of house!! Then maybe the it will be worth coming back."}
{"text":"I don't really know how I should rate this place.  The prices were a little steep for the presentation and quality of the food and service.  Minus one star for that.

There was a loud and annoying foreign (more like poor sounding slurred English) version of a happy birthday song played repeatedly while we were there.  Minus one star for noise.

I went with my two sons, and we all got something different.   My oldest son ordered hibachi chicken.  The youngest ordered a California roll, and I ordered the spicy lobster roll.  We all enjoyed our meals (put a star back) but I got sick when we got home.  I am not happy about that.  Minus 2 stars.

I have been meaning to try this place for a while now.  It always smells so good when I pass by when I am at the mall.  After being sick from it though, I don't know if I will be back.  At least not for a good while."}
{"text":"Being the closest hibachi bar it's not hard to frequent this place. They offer a good selection and the portions and prices are comparable to other similar restaurants. The ginger dressing is awesome, actually better than Nakato."}
{"text":"I have been to Fuji steakhouse two times, since I've been in Ohio and the first time was actually with my coworker and friend. The moment that we walked through the door, we were greeted with a warm smile and a happy wait staff. They were like a big group of friends that really enjoyed their jobs and that is refreshing. I am a very rambunctious character and I have a loud personality, which exudes friendliness. I was hitting on all the male servers because they are super hot... with nice butts. NO JOKE!!! They joked back with me and didn't make me feel uncomfortable. Which is what I like about this place. The atmosphere is dark, hip, and has beautiful interior decorations. The food is exquisite and my first time there I was served sushi on a plate that looked like a little tropical paradise with an umbrella and some decorations. It was so cute. Those little details matter the most. 

Ashley, the waitress was amazing and funny. 

Jessica, the Bartender had an amazing personality and was funny, plus makes an amazing martini. 

Queenah, the waitress (I SPELLED THAT WRONG BUT THAT IS HOW IT IS PRONOUNCED) is so sweet and sang the sake bomb song with our gayte group.(gay date night, two girls one guy) 

Dan and Rick, the servers were our proverbial eye candy for our table of gossiping girls. They are so hot!

I can't imagine eating any other place because this steakhouse raised the bar pretty high. I saw that a lot of people left some pretty bad reviews, but do not know the traditional way of Japanese steakhouses. I'm not saying that this is a traditional Japanese Steakhouse, by any means, because the interior decorations are very hip and modern, but the food is outstanding and the service is quite phenomenal. Also the best part of the dining experience at Fuji steak 
house is when they play \"the birthday song\". I love it because even when it isn't your birthday everyone throws their hands up and claps to the awkward beat of this birthday song, it is hilarious and funny and people need to lighten up about it.

Overall my experience at Fuji Steakhouse has been nothing but pure joy. I recommend anybody that goes there to get the, FRENCH KISS MARTINI,  or the, PEAR MARTINI,  which is delicious. My favorite sushi roll is the ATOMIC ROLL and the SASHIMI is to die for and high quality."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for like 8 years. My daughter has celebrated almost all her birthdays here.  The food is always amazing and the service is top notch.  Always a good time."}
{"text":"OK nothing excited about this resturant.  We waited 25 minutes to be seated.  All the other tables that was seated after us was served before us.  Food nasty, shrimp cook to hard, rice had hard pieces, salad was just lettuce and the comment we down to one chef. No need to show out just know never will eat there again."}
{"text":"Went New Years Eve with a group of seven people. Had made advanced registrations for an 8 PM seating.

We arrived a few minutes before 8 PM and was told they were running about 20 minutes late. Finally, we were seated at 9:15 PM. Within about 10 minutes we finally were able to place our order. We waited another half hour and nothing but clear soup was served.
There was no sign of a cook and the hibachi table was not even ignited. At 9:50 we decided, that was enough. And left.
This was the worst mismanagement of a restaurant I have seen in a long time. We will never go back"}
{"text":"The wait is always long, reservations do you no good here. The \"Happy Birsday\" song they play on loud speakers sang in slurred English gets tiring after about the 3rd time. The portions have gotten smaller over the years. I used to always have a take home box, nowadays I am able to clean my plate. The small iceberg lettuce salad always has super chilled ginger dressing that is so cold it contains ice crystals. It ends up being pretty watery by the end. The food is typically good, however it will depend on who is cooking your food. It's common to have overcooked shrimp and scallops and seafood in these types of restaurants. It's best to order red meat \"medium\"' otherwise you end up with boot leather. The prices have also gone up and is more expensive than Hibatchi Steakhouse in Painesville Township. 
They will bring out a type of fried ice cream dessert for your birthday with a sparkler and play that obnoxious song, but they will charge you around $5 for it. If you are a Mentor resident, there are coupons sent out regularly in the mail."}
{"text":"This is one of the best hibachi places I've been to, even better than most Benihanas. 

The place was clean and the lighting was great, you know, soft lighting but not so low that it feels dingy. 

We had hot saki, which is always good, and martinis, which were just okay.My dinner mate had the chicken and filet mignon hibachi, I sneaked in a bite of her rice and veggies and it was delicious. I ordered the lobster sushi roll and ginger salad and I was very satisfied. The gave us a $10 off coupon for our next visit, gotta love that!"}
{"text":"Food is good but atmosphere is too casual, & staff is not always friendly or accessible enough!"}
{"text":"Honestly a bit disappointing. Being from Seattle, I know what real sushi and miso soup tastes like and this definitely was off. Miso was plain, sashimi wasn't that fresh, and service was slow."}
{"text":"I have been here several times as it is the closer hibachi place near where I live. I would say it is your typical hibachi place--onion volcano, shrimp tail in the hat and whatnot. What I like about it is that if you go by 7 pm on any night of the week, there isn't normally a wait like other older hibachi places in town.  It is busy just less crowded. They do take reservations, have a sushi bar and a regular dining room. The food has always been good, right on par with my expectations. Service has been good as well. I have always gotten some form of hibachi even when I sat in the regular dining room. It has always been good! Drinks--better when sitting at the bar---they seem to pour differently then when ordering at the grills. I like a balanced cocktail, so I am not suggesting they are are too strong or too weak, just different. 
I have even ordered takeout recently. Have to say that for to-go hibachi, it was packed well and included everything normally served dining in. I ordered there and it took about 10 minutes for my food. It was piping hot when I got home too. 
I would say this is one of the better places to eat in the Rivergate area."}
{"text":"We decided to head to this place after seeing it for years and never been in there, well first of the place doesn't look Japanese at all except for the staff, drinks were order and brought to us in really cheap glasses, after we place our order salad and soup arrived and here is where the problem started salad was bad and to top it all off was a worm on it pun definitely intended, we left immediately, do not go I repeat do not go to this place it will gross you out forever."}
{"text":"Noodles were tasteless. Rice needed more flavor. Sons chicken was chewy. My shrimp was good. Loved the ginger salad dressing. Soup pretty bland. Not too friendly staff."}
{"text":"This location has the worst customer service.  Myself and 2 friends went in on a weekday evening.  After being seated it took at least 15 minutes just to give our drink order.  After receiving our drinks it took another 10 minutes to order.  The waitress was not very nice.  I got a straw with a hole in it & had to convince her that I needed another straw.  During our meal she did not check on us and we had to request our own refills.  The food was good but I can go anywhere for good food.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Have you ever had a 35 year old Japanese man squirt sake from a plastic squeeze bottle into your mouth? Well, you just haven't lived, my friend. 

The boyfriend, his mini-me and I decided to hit this place up since we were a) in the area b) starving to death and c) the little guy l-o-v-e loves hibachi. Enter, Fuji. 

As you walk in you brace yourself for the worst. I mean, it's located inside of a shopping mall, so you never know. At first, the restaurant was bright, with a sushi bar and and lots of people. Then you step into a dark room with club lights. The boy said, \"Hey, this place would be a cool place to play laser tag.\" So, yea. If that gives you any sort of indication...

We didn't get to try the sushi, and after reading some of these reviews I'm kind of sad about it. But, we did all have hibachi steak. Most any Japanese steak restaurant will give you 70% noodles and rice, 15% veggies and %15 steak. This place was no different. With the hibachi meal you got a clear broth soup and a salad. The soup was, well, a clear broth with one mushroom slice floating in it. But, surprisingly enough it had great flavor. The salad--drenched in ginger dressing and nothing special. The actual meal itself was tasty. Like most other yelpers have mentioned, it's really all about the entertainment. 

And, oh boy, was our chef entertaining. 

I mean, squirting sake in our mouths from across the table, entertaining. He also had this little toy figurine of a boy that \"peed\" out water, which he used to squirt my boyfriend's son at least 10 times. He flipped lots of miscellaneous foods in the air for us to catch and even had a horn. No, I'm not kidding. This guy was a singin' fool, too.

Overall, a pretty good experience for the mini and for us. The price was a little high, in my opinion, especially with the ratio of food, but it was certainly a trip."}
{"text":"Normally, this is my favorite place for Japanese Hibachi. I have a favorite chef who usually cooks for our party, granted we have tried other chefs but they're not as good.

We went back for a birthday party yesterday with a reservation. We also requested for our favorite chef and was promptly accepted. By the time our party got seated into the party, we were told they couldn't fulfill our request for the chef today because they were busy.  We did gave another chef a try, the food was mediocre, it was salty and oily. If they tell us beforehand that our request cannot be fulfill, we wouldn't have our party here."}
{"text":"CAUGHT CHEATING US!! This place is just terrible!!!!! I wish I could give it no stars, one star gives a complement to this terrible restaurant, in which it should not receive. 
First off- I bought a groupon that you payed  $12 but was worth $25 for 2 entrees. I'm going to be in law school soon, and my father is actually a lawyer already! The FINE PRINT- says for 2 entrees one per table/check etc. It goes on to say what it doesn't include. Says drinks, this, that and so forth. We got sushi- which is one of THE most if not the most popular menu items, that is why the restaurant is known. So after we were finished and got our check, we go to give them the Groupon, our waitress was extremely rude to begin with, and when my girlfriend pulled up the groupon, all she said to us was, \"no,\" and walked away. I got upset and asked for the manager. I told him we bought the Groupon specifically for the sushi - why else would I spend money to get something I didn't want in the first place?!- He goes on to say no this doesn't apply and you can't use this!!! I asked him to please take off these two sushi items and replace them with two entrées of equal price of what our bill came out to (which was $30) he comes back with a new receipt and the amount on the receipt was doubled to $55. He also added two different items we didn't even have during our meal. He expected us to pay an additional $35 for what we owed originally, I literally caught the manager trying to cheat and screw us for extra money. My girlfriend works at a hair salon - the hairstylist use Groupon all the time for the personal clients, and you have to tell groupon what you want to put in the fine print. He then tells me Groupon writes it for him...which is a lie you must write your own FinePrint in your \"contract/agreement \"with Groupon. I deal with contracts constantly! I am a real estate investor and all I do is sign, fax, and write contracts!! I told him to give me the original receipt for $30, which we owed in the beginning, and asked to take off five dollars and I agreed to pay him just so I can leave. I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN, I HAD AN EVEN WORSE EXPERIENCE at the Habachi side which I will write about next.


I was recommended to me by a friend for the hibachi side and how good it was etc. When my girlfriend and I arrived there we sat down as other customers were seated with us. The performing chef, I guess you can say - WAS THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN!!! The chef was hung over, or either drunk. He was rude, annoying, inappropriate, and flat out just did not care about you or what you wanted. You could tell he just wanted to get done with us and didn't care. The chef started to cook food, and it was literally going everywhere - the food we were supposed to be eating. (Keep in mind the hibachi food is very expensive). He asked me if I wanted to catch a piece of food, I agreed because I wanted to try to have fun. I did it once and I said that was enough and I was finished. As he was cooking, I was not even looking at him, I was talking to my girlfriend and had my head turned towards her, and he continued to throw food at me!! It got all over my shirt, face, and even in my hair, and I have a pretty short haircut. He was throwing the egg shells around, which they're supposed to throw them away right away. He was going about it in a bad way, and he left eggshells around our plates of food!!! Just raw empty egg shells, and left them sitting there!!! The food was not good either. As they shot the sake into my mouth I told him to stop, and he wouldn't, and it got all over me. I will never go to this habachi again. I would rather drive farther into mentor, where Harry Buffalo is, and spend three or four more dollars in gas, then deal with this terrible restaurant, terrible chefs, manager, and waiter/waitress's again. What an absolute waste of money and time I wish I could take it all back. DONT BOTHER-TERRIBLE FOOD, EXPERIENCE, AND CHEFS! DONT WASTE THE MONEY!!"}
{"text":"This place is yum!!! 

They were pretty nice about 'veganizing' my rice dish, and the hostess was nice about my questions about if anything contained any dairy or eggs. Not too many vegan options but I ordered take out, 2 sides of the hibachi rice without egg and avocado roll. 

The avocado roll was a rolled bit sloppy half of them were opening up by the time I got home, and i could tell my rice was cooked either next to or right after the rice with eggs (my friend also ordered hibachi rice with egg). After inspecting I didn't find any egg! 


Overall everything was very tasty and fairly good prices"}
{"text":"Half priced sushi days make it worth it. Service can be inattentive. Floor is sometimes oddly sticky underneath tables and my bill has been wrong a few times. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Good food but service is not so good. Was there this week with my daughter and the carpet was wet and sticky. They gave us a table and droplets of water starting falling on me from the vent on top of me. It seams unsanitary in a place where they sell fish."}
{"text":"Went there for Fathers Day June17,2018 with my family 11 of us , food was good but way too hot and complaint to the waitress and She cannot do anything, no air conditioner and no electric fan , just had lots of ice cold water , my sweat was dripping and wanted to leave but cannot disappoint my kids and grandkids, conclusion will not go back especially in the summer months and spread words to neighbors and friends thanks Mario Z. Reyes, M, D."}
{"text":"Second visit this has happened .. A hair first in the soy sauce dish then again under my sons rice .. I got up to find owner to discuss so his customers wouldn't hear.. He takes the plate away comes back with the plays in front of his customers says this hair is long and not black! What??? What are you saying?? Not to mention I told them twice about no soap or paper towels in bathroom hmm sign says employees wash your hands how's that happening ??"}
{"text":"Great entertainment and atmosphere... While this isn't my favorite hibachi restaurant, I have to give them some credit. The food is okay (not spectacular though) and the presentation is awesome with the fire show, flipping veggies into patrons mouths and the requisite hibachi broken English jokes, but I found the place to be a bit pricy for what it was. I have eaten better hibachi other places for less.

If you do decide to try it, if you catch the veggies being tossed at you on your first try, they will squirt Sake from a bottle into your mouth which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"I usually am not a fan of this place, but a recent experience changed my mind!  We got there around 4pm ish and ordered appetizers, sushi rolls, and saki.  The food was really fresh and looked great visually.  The flavors were amazing and consistent throughout all the rolls. The owner even came to our table and gave us a complimentary bottle of saki!  The server even did a shot with us haha. This experience was 4x's better than when I first came here with a server who spoke very poor English.  All in all recommended!"}
{"text":"We just got take out, so no comments on service or the hibachi show. The restaurant is clean and doesn't have that overwhelming \"hibachi\" smell that always seems to get in your clothes. The food was out quickly in about ten minutes and looked wonderful!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and very slow staff. I understand being busy but the hostess said 10-15 min wait and it end s up being 45 mins. Once we were seated it took 30 mins to get drinks & food ordered. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food and decent service. Waited a bit long for my drink to be refilled but the food was amazing. Chefs are very kind and make the dining experience amazing with the interactions they have with customers. Good place for graduations, birthdays or any other gathering."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money I don't think I've seen worse service. I got my food and never seen the waitress again. My drank sat empty nearly the entire night and I was never even asked if I like the food. Which also wasn't great. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings in the southwest Charlotte area. Do yourself a favor and give them. The only problem I have is the lack of parking!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, I usually start with the spider roll then onto the hibachi shrimp and filet mignon,  delicious."}
{"text":"Great food. We had the hibachi prepared food. The cook was engaging and great with our kids. The service could not have been better. We highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing as always, the management knows us me are always very pleasant. We are ready to get check out Red Ginger .. We love the sushi here but the presentation just keeps getting better ..."}
{"text":"Food quality is good. Sushi rolls are too over-sized and make them unenjoyable to eat. Reasonable prices. 

Some might look at the sushi menu and think are lots of options, but it's like a Chinese restaurant in the sense that the same ingredients are used in different preparations and combinations. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Messed up order, cold food, missing food, 55 minute wait for a to go order for 2 people...yeah we'd go back in a pinch but this is never going to be very high on our list."}
{"text":"We went on Saturday at 6:15. We were told about 15 min wait so we went to the bar. After 35 min we had three drinks each (party of 3) and ordered sushi. After waiting on a table and checking in with the front several times, after 1 Hour and 20 min, I crossed our name out and we left for Hickory Tavern. That was just Crazy!!!!!"}
{"text":"My son loves this place and honestly he is just my excuse to come here. Food is amazing. By far the best Hibachi Grill in Charlotte. I promise you... I've tried them all. Fuji is tops!! Their sushi is amazing too. Definitely a must visit. Hibachi cooks are extremely funny."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of coming here on New Years Eve.  It was not my first time; I come here regularly.  The service here is always exceptional, but on this night I feel they went beyond what was called for to take care of the large crowds that flooded the place.  There aren't many places that I would wait an hour to get seated, but this place is one of them and for the amount of people it was a fairly acceptable wait.  The servers are always friendly and accommodating with any changes thrown at them. The food here is always amazing and makes me want to come back for more.  I have been to a few hibachi places and they all come up short."}
{"text":"Came in and was seated during lunch time. However when we were set to order they were unwilling to honor the lunch specials due to the order being in after 2:30pm, but we were there and seated well beforehand and had already ordered drinks. They were very petty and unwavering for longtime customers. We actually drove from Matthews and once revered this to be the best Japanese around. Well, we can be petty too. Loss of business."}
{"text":"We usually go weekly for the 1/2 price sushi menu (M & Tu).  The food, drinks, and service are always great.  Usually get a private booth but have sat at the bar and hibachi as well.  Would definitely recommend, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Only been here twice for the hibachi. They were just average performance chefs. The food was above average. My two children (both picky eaters) really enjoyed it as well. The Chef used a peeing baby doll to squirt saki into mouths... was kinda strange."}
{"text":"I had hibachi lunch combo with salmon and scallop, served with fried rice and soup. The food portion is good, but it is rather plain, shrimp sauce has a weird taste in it. The soup was also very plain, like water mixed with fried onions, it wasn't even hot, it was a little bit warm. Service is bad. My waitress brought out my dish with no utensils. I would rather tell people I know to stay away from this restaurant because the food overall is kind of okay and service overall is bad."}
{"text":"The most embarrassingly bad service ever.  Waited more than an hour and a half from our reservation time.  Had to walk out.  Reservations do not matter and they will be understaffed.  Never go this terrible restaurant."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I eat at Fuji almost every time we go to Mentor. The sushi is good, and the hibachi is good as well. The \"yum yum\" sauce is okay...nothing to write home about. My personal recommendation is to get the spicy tuna special roll.

I also recommend that you steer clear of the main room for hibachi. It is nice on a quiet day...but then the birthday songs begin. The volume is quite loud, and it can be an interruption in any conversation that you are having."}
{"text":"Went on Valentine's Day and was very disappointed. Chef was less than enthused. Realize they do this all night, but we were a little bummed at his lack of enthusiasm since we brought our children. Ordered two orders of tempura chicken for our two kids -- and they forgot to put the order in. Adults were done w their meal before they received their dinner, so we took it to go. Makes for a stressful dinner when kids don't get their food at the same time (if not before). Manager didn't offer to comp us until we asked. Was very expensive and would only go back with a Groupon. Not worth paying regular price."}
{"text":"Liked the food. Very tasty and great atmosphere. We have been here several times but this time we decided to use a groupon for our purchase. Another group met us up and had a separate bill. Still we could only use one coupon. We tried to explain the issue but the manager ignored us and walked away saying \"you use only one coupon\". After we got our drinks and the waiter saw I needed a refill she preceded to rip the drink and straw out of my mouth. She said \"refill\"?  I proceeded to tell her \"no\", but she walked and got me some more anyways.  Mind you she didn't even clean the mess up that was caused from her ripping the drink out from my mouth. To top it off I went to use the bathrooms and they were filthy and disgusting. I hope the kitchen is no where near the conditions of the bathroom."}
{"text":"First visit: 
I came on a Tuesday evening to enjoy wine and sushi with a friend. We decided to pass on the hibachi experience. I ordered the Sushi Appetizer (Assorted fish over rice) along with a side of spicy mayo. My friend ordered the Caterpillar Roll, which tasted amazing!!! This place is small, the tables and floors are clean. After leaving I noticed the Yelp Checkin offer. Which I planned to redeem later....

Second visit:
Monday evening, I noticed ton of people waiting on tables and ToGo orders. I came solo. The hostess seated me at the sushi bar. The evening was quite busy. After overlooking the menu, I couldn't wait to enjoy a few sushi rolls. 15 MINUTES went by!! No one took my order!! I Became frustrated and left. 

Will I return again?? Maybe in a few months. Hoping for a better experience the third time around"}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Mentor for sushi (on Monday or Tuesdays...1/2 priced!). I don't eat any seafood though, so I can only vouch for the veggie rolls. Their sweet potato roll is so good that my fish-eating fiance always orders one for himself. 

Service can be hit or miss. It actually seems to have gotten a lot better, so that's a huge plus.  Definitely seems to be a hot spot for birthdays, as we hear some kind of Japanese (?) birthday song every 15 mins or so..."}
{"text":"Good flavorful healthy meal!
Health score: 96.5
There are several seating options here: at the Sushi Bar with the Sushi chefs, at a grill table with a Hibachi chef or at a regular table to order from the kitchen, not to mention the bar where they also serve food.
We had both Chicken and Beef Teriyaki and loved it. It came out sizzling on a grill platter with grilled onions, broccoli & carrots and glazed with Teriyaki sauce. You can get white or fried rice (no brown:(  They serve you Salad and Miso soup beforehand. The Ginger Salad Dressing is really good! They have a good choice of meats, seafoods & veggies as well as Tofu to choose from for your entree, so veggie people are good to go too
If you decide on Hibachi, the variety is even greater.
We didn't have any Sushi but it looked really fresh!
My only disappointment was I would have liked more Japanese-style veggies with the meal rather than the American standard of broccoli and carrots."}
{"text":"Hibachi filet mignon and chicken are good.  They sometimes don't keep the portions fair.  Their sweet potato sushi roll \"used\" to be great but it is being served undercooked.  Las Vegas roll is fantastic."}
{"text":"Been here many times and it's always a consistently good meal. Sushi is ok but we usually go for the hibachi. Quality is always high."}
{"text":"We went here for my husbands birthday recently. It was a Monday and we wanted to sit at the hibachi grill so I called to make a reservation. The girl on the phone told me there was no need so after work, around 7:30, we walked in a requested a spot for 2. She tried to sit me at a table in the dining room and seemed peeved when I told her we wanted the hibachi grill. We waited at the bar where we enjoyed FANTASTIC service and a delicious appetizer! After about 30-45 minutes a asked if there was going to be a hibachi grill open for us and the hostess again pushed us towards sitting at a regular table which we eventually did. Our bartender was our server and she was GREAT! Our food was delicious and I did enjoy the atmosphere, I just wish that they would have let me know when I called that there may not be a hibachi grill open late on a Monday evening."}
{"text":"Fuji is one of my top places to get Hibachi. I didn't give 5 stars as we had to wait longer than usual for the chef to start the Hibachi grill. Overall, the quality of the food and price is good"}
{"text":"Until recently this was my go to hibachi location with decent prices and food. I've been several times and I have always enjoyed the hibachi show (though there wasn't anything to stand out from other locations). The food is neither excellent nor poor.

I have branched out to trying different hibachi locations despite the convenience of Fuji to my apartment because last time I was there the waitress refused to accept a $10 off coupon I was given on my last visit stating that it had expired. I thought the date was pretty clear, and she barely looked at it before refusing. I even took out my antiquated physical planner to show her that my last visit was not long ago and well after the date she claimed my coupon expired. She had quite an attitude so we let it slide and paid full price but will most likely not return. 

I would say this place is good if you are looking for standard hibachi, but it does not sit well with me when an establishment doesn't honor their own coupons."}
{"text":"(Excuse the missing punctuation over the \"e\" in \"sake\"; so that word is indeed \"sah-key\".  I'm not computer proficient enough to do that yet!  LOL.)

Let me start by saying we will go back as long as we ALWAYS get the guy who cooked for us the last time!  I'm STILL singing the \"Sake, sake, sake; go, go, go!!!\" song in my head!

Went on Sunday for my kids' FIRST experience with hibachi.  They all had a blast.  At first, when the chef started the flame up on the burner, my 9-year-old HF autistic son was a little nervous and my 5-year-old nearly crawled under the table.  By the end, however, the 5-year-old sounded like Beavis...\"FIRE, FIRE, FIRE!!!\"  The food was great!  Wasn't too wild about the salad, but it was the standard hibachi side I guess.  When the chef played the \"sake\" game with my husband, it was hysterical!  

He cooked everything to perfection.  My 16-year-old, who sticks her nose up at EVERYTHING, ate the steak quicker than she has ever eaten anything.  The kids ALL managed to catch the broccoli; the younger ones thought that was quite the accomplishment!  And when our chef had finished at our table and was cooking for the table next to us, he actually checked on our son to make sure he knew the fire was about to start up at the next table and not to be frightened.  By that time our son was all smiles!  I still appreciate his attention to that detail!

We're DEFINITELY going back.  I'm very hard-pressed to find a restaurant with that sort of attention to the little patrons as well as the big patrons.  No crayons and coloring menu needed here!  All you need is the guy who can spin a mean spatula and who has a mustard bottle full of sake!"}
{"text":"Came here for the hibachi with some friends from work. We would never travel this far for hibachi as we have 2 place close to us that our good. well that changed the other night and this may be our goto hibachi spot from now on.. Prices are average for hibachi. The food was good, the lobster i got was a bit over cooked but everything else was nicely prepared... My vegtables were very good although i recieved a lot of mushrooms which my fiance kindly ate for me(not a fan of mushrooms)... The show was top notch, from the food toss to the sake shots for all(water for kids). We had a great time and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We went there last night for my birthday. Very disappointing. The chef put on no-show whatsoever just stood there and cooked, I don't even know if he spoke English. They totally ignored the fact that it was my birthday even though we had told the chef (the waitress never asked if we were celebrating anything We hardly saw her at all) No drink refills, dirty dishes sat on the table the whole time & They didn't bring the appetizer we ordered till halfway through the meal. The food was tasty but we really felt like second class citizens. The table next to us had an outgoing chef who was entertaining and they all were laughing and they even sang happy birthday for their table. :("}
{"text":"We visited Fuji at 3:30pm on a rainy Sunday.  It wasn't full, so we had amazing service  :-)  The place looks nice, smells fine, and is welcoming.  There's a big menu both with sushi and hibachi selections printed in an unusual pattern on the menu.  It makes hunting for a selection a little disorienting, but we quickly found our rhythm.  

This being our first visit, I wanted to try a Bento box so I could get a small sampling of various items.  I was told that the Bento boxes were only offered at lunch and that lunch ends at 2:30pm (though that's not written on the menu anywhere).  I asked if I could pay a higher price and still get the Bento box and was a little irritated when they refused that option as well.  So in my attempt to still get some variety I ordered edamame, California rolls, and a ginger salad with a sweet tea.  My fella ordered the teriyaki chicken which came with miso soup and a sweet tea.  My edamame was super salty and undercooked for my liking.  My salad was tasty, but then again I love ginger so it's hard to mess up a bowl of lettuce with ginger dressing poured over it.  My California rolls arrived:  they were very thin, heavily rolled in roe and there were only 6 pieces.?.  They offered a tiny pile of white ginger and a small pile of cakey green wasabi.  I made due, but I wish I'd have known about the roe as I do not enjoy it and would've requested that they leave it off.  My sweet tea was great and they kept my glass full  :-)  My fella's teriyaki chicken arrived on a  loudly sizzling platter... a la mexican fajitas??  which we found odd.  It was a huge mass of onions with a char-grilled chicken breast cut in strips layered across the onions with 3 pieces of broccoli, 2 baby carrots and syrupy sweet teriyaki poured all over the top...  It wasn't nearly as tasty as it sounds.  My fella poured the low sodium soy sauce over his bowl of steamed rice and ate that instead.  But his sweet tea was also great  :-)

So, for $32 (plus $6 tip) we found yet another so-so Japanese place that we won't be going back to.  (sigh)"}
{"text":"Me and the wife have been here several times. This time was really no different. The chef we had was kinda boring but the food was very good. Their sushi is pretty good also, some of the best I've had in Charlotte so far. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Meh. Expensive. The service was very slow and the sashimi was average. The slices of fish were not especially fatty and you could still feel some tendon parts of the sashimi."}
{"text":"Sad to say 0 stars don't exist but I was recently came with a party that booked a reservation in advance, we got there 10 min before the the reservation and no table was ready for us so now we had to wait 15-20 min from our reservation time to get seated. once we got seated they apologized and took our orders immediately after getting our drinks, we sat for an waited a whole hour for them to even start cooking our food, And if you thought that was the end of the problems, trust me they were just beginning. One of the guest of the party I was in food was cold she sent it back and said very clearly \"do not cook around shrimp\" and they did that anyways, she could've broken out, thank god someone noticed it before she did. Now. The final \"fuck you\" from this restaurant was time to pay, I've been to this restaurant before and ik they took Debt Cards But Now They Don't Take Debt Cards All Of A Sudden. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy. 1 STAR!!!"}
{"text":"Good service and great food! You can sit at a hibachi table, sushi bar, regular table, or at the full far that they have. The hibachi meals are always delicious and flavorful! Don't forget about the sushi. Would recommend sushi and hibachi lovers to come here! Kid friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Despite all the horrific stories on here, I've had a pretty average experience with all of my sporadic visits over the years. The sushi isn't amazing, but it's also nowhere near the worst. 

We found getting takeout eliminated some issues."}
{"text":"Food was delish! $15 dollar wine bottle selection on a few wines that retail for $30. Nice place for a date. The chef was very entertaining. We ordered an appetizer from the kitchen and received 50%(appetizer) just by checking in on Yelp. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The scallops were very good the chicken was not. It was like eating rubber. The rice and noodles were good as well the vegetables were cooked well. The sweet tea is perfection. Not too sweet but sweet enough. Tea was my favorite of what I had."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, the restaurant seemed really quite for lunch time. Over wall the restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly. I ordered the sushi which took longer than my coworkers entrees. The sushi was good but not anything special. Prices are ok if you go for lunch specials."}
{"text":"Love their Hibachi for the entertainment (depending on who you get, it can really be fun). 
I like the steak Hibachi. I like the broth and the salad (Ginger dressing is fine for me, in fact I have to buy some to take home next time) and the steak was fixed just as I wanted (RARE!) I love their sauces also. 
Be sure to get there early so you don't have to wait. During the week is best."}
{"text":"The sushi rice is done perfectly. The grain is whole and the flavor is just perfect. Makes you want to eat more.

Very impressive sushi and all the Japanese food. I tried the sushi and sashimi combo, it was very good. Salmon Teriyaki Bowl is great and very artistic presentation. Lots of impressive and artistic presentations.

The hibachi grill is ok for me. It's only show and tell entertainment. I had better sauce than this.

The service is okay. If you have American waitress, great service. Asian waitress, need to smile more and engage with the customer more. Maybe the language barrier. On the hibachi side, the service was great. The other dining room side, the service is very inconsistant. Not a lot of suggestive selling.

Overall the food is great and I will keep going back to try more...."}
{"text":"We went there with another couple for their sushi and sushi only so I cannot judge their other Hibachi food/experience. We were very pleased by the environment, the booths are secluded and have curtains on them to really make for an intimate experience. It was nice to not have to yell to speak to everyone in the party or feel cramped because of a table behind you, a very nice touch to the atmospher and appeal. The sushi was good, not the best Ive had in the area, but good. I ordered a california roll to try out the place and then the spicy yellowtail and mexican roll. The spicy rolls all tasted the same and looked the same, which I thought was odd, but it was a good taste and had a lot of flavor. Someone in our party ordered the boston roll and said it was not good. The only complaint I had was the birthday music from the Hibachi parties being piped in the entire restaurant, loud, repetitive, and annoying. Other than that, good food, great appeal."}
{"text":"One of our go to places.  The hibachi is good, we get tired of the show.  Our favorite is the sushi.  Best sushi I've had in Charlotte.  We usually eat at the tables or sushi bar not the hibachi tables.  Cosmos are nice & stiff."}
{"text":"They aren't my first choice for Japanese food. However they are the only choice in my area that offer hibachi/teriyaki when I'm in the mood for it. The food is decent but the customer service definitely lacks when you're dining in here. I'm not too keen of their sushi served here either. For a while, when i would eat here i would order a roll just to see if it would be any good or if anything has changed in quality. I regret it everytime because it definitely doesnt taste fresh. Eventually, I gave up on the sushi thing with them. I guess this is a good establishment for families who want to entertain their little kids with the hibachi grill and what not. Other than that it's nothing to brag about here."}
{"text":"Lots of restaurants have come and gone in this location over the years, but I think this one will last.  My husband and I have had lunch, dinner, and Easter Sunday brunch at Fuji's; in fact, Easter at a hibachi table has become a tradition with our group of family and friends.  Sake bombs, both the drop-it-in-a-glass and the squirt-it-in-your mouth versions, are really a lot of fun.  The dining room, the hibachi room, the sushi bar and the bar-bar -- who can pick a favorite?  The food is quite good, but since other people have made detailed comments (and I agree with all the positive ones), I'll recommend the green tea martinis.  You gotta have one!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Chef did not do the show for the kids until the end after we complained.  Took 2.5 hours after we sat down before we were finished.  Had to beg for refills.  Manager admitted to being under staffed.  Waitress came to our group at the end and handed us a $700 check and told us all to separate the bill because she had no clue.  Will not be back.  Manager was rude and did not care.  Beware....."}
{"text":"Negative 5 stars for service and quality of food. To start we had to plead with the management to give us a separate hibachi due to food allergies, when seated we ordered the Red Snapper and Salmon hibachi. The chef came out and gave us a less than enthusiastic showing quickly rushing through the process because he has done it hundreds of times. The rice was blah mush served with a hint of garlic and a splash of soy sauce and the vegetables were bland with no seasoning at all. 

For the main dish was the Salmon and Red Snapper, we were excited to try this hoping it had more to offer than the basic rice and veggies. Well what a waste of time, the fish was spoiled and slimey and tasted foul. We didn't even have to do more than take a small sample to realize they had tried to cook us spoiled fish and pass it off as gourmet hibachi. When we realized this we called over or waitress and let her know. She tried to correct this by taking it to management. As several other reviews will reveal, this restaurant suffers heavily in regards to customer service. 

Her manager said she took care of it by taking off the fish. Well she still tried to charge us al a carte for the soup, salad, rice and veggies which was equal to the same price as the fish. Wow. When asked about this she said that she charged us what we ate. We didn't eat any of this except the soup which we told them we would gladly pay for. After about 30 minutes of back and forth she finally removed everything except the soup. When matters took a turn for the worse was when we presented our Christmas gift Groupon. 

The Groupon complaints on Fuji alone should restrict them from participating in any further offers. Their \"Fine Print\" is really clear and so is the fact that if the Groupon shall not be accepted it is at minimum worth the value paid at all times at the restaurant. In this case $13. The restaurant refused to accept it for any value. To save you the reader some time and me the writer some time here is the bottom line. This is a dirty, shady restaurant that immediately outside of the front door has a hand written sign posted that says now hiring cooks, waiters, managements and bus positions. This should serve as notice enough that they cannot keep good staff. 

Long story short we should have walked out. This was supposed to be a peaceful family dinner with my wife and kids. After all of the go around with management and getting nowhere my wife pleaded with me to just pay. I reluctantly did and wrote on the bill \"forced to pay without resolution\". Needless to say I have already called my credit card company to dispute the charge. Save your money, I'd write more but I'm going to go throw up now from the rotten fish!"}
{"text":"Not very good. First time experience and wont go back. The menu is large and confusing, the prices were high for what you get and the food was not that great. The chicken was tough (how does THAT happen?) and my DINNER came with \"vegetables\" which consisted of raw carrot strips, raw celery sticks and raw broccoli. The sauce was good, though. Dont recommend."}
{"text":"WOW! Absolutely a great place to go for some hibachi.  Hibachi prices were about what you'd expect, but the portions were oh so worth every penny and more.  They gave us a bowl of rice, a plate of noodles, oh so good miso soup and salad with a choice of house (ginger-yummy) or ranch dressing. The couple next to us seemed to enjoy there food just as much as we did and I heard no complaints or looks of discontent on anyone's face. 

We also got a order of the yellow tail sushi - compliments to the sushi chef! Sure wish I had room to try more.

Hands down, I would choose this as the place to go if you are looking to not be disappointed. The menu has a large selection of choices. 

Tokyo was our first choice when we thought sushi, but we were looking for a front seat to the grill master and some entertainment. The sushi bar was really nice a clean looking.  The whole restaurant had a nice atmosphere about it. I wish I could relocate this place to my home town.  

I gave this a 5 star since there were no 4 1/2 stars. Hope you enjoy this place as much as we did!!!"}
{"text":"Food, incredible. Atmosphere, amazing. Chef, awesome. Would recommend this restaurant to everyone! Love it!! Enough food for two meals. Highly recommend the shrimp. You really get what you pay for with this place."}
{"text":"Food was great but don't get fooled with the yelp coupon - it was a misprint when you redeem your 20% off - it says use any day in June and Owner refused to honor it! It's September!!!"}
{"text":"Fast, fun and delicious. If you crave Japanese food or want to spend less then give this place a chance. They are very friendly and the chef's are grew on putting shows while they cook in front of you."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, and it comes out quick. The sushi here is very fresh and displayed beautifully! I had a great experience and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing and rude service!!!
Visited this location and was greeted by a very nasty and rude hostess...and I was only there to pick up a take out order!

Upon entering, this young lady appeared to be having a bad day as there was no greeting or salutation...only \"What do you need\".  She then proceeds to argue with me, insisting there was no take out order called in and that was probably their sister location.  She wanted me to provide the number I called which in fact was their sister location (my bad!) but then she says to me, in a very rude manner, you need to call them back now and cancel the order as that is a lot of food they are wasting.  I would have accepted this fine with no issues but the way in which she addressed me and spoke to me was totally uncalled for, unprofessional and downright rude.  She then says to me, well what do you want to order...at this point I told her I do not plan on placing an order, I will take my business elsewhere and that she was unprofessional and rude.  She responds by vehemently denying she was rude.  I chose not to further engage with her and decided to take this matter up with management so I exited and the restaurant and intend upon calling her Manager/general manager in the morning to apprise him of the situation.  There was no cause of action for how rude this individual was and therefore there is never a need to address a customer in that manner."}
{"text":"The Hibachi dinner and show is awesome, very fun for the kids. Plenty of food and drinks are good. Just make sure you don't arrive too late so you don't feel rushed out."}
{"text":"They have good sushi and many different rolls. They have a hibachi side so if you want to be entertained while you eat you are good there.  They also have a dinning room if you want a Nice quiet dinner with the person you're with. Food And service good.  Half price sushi Monday and Tuesday."}
{"text":"Very delicious! I came here again and HAD TO edit my review! Our waitress was very nice and helpful. She kept refilling our drinks every time she would even see them half-way! I had the sesame chicken and miso soup. It was all soooo good!! We also had some sushi that the whole table snacked on and it was delicious! We treated ourselves to some Mochi ice cream! It was all so good and I will be returning."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this horrible \"restaurant\" below zero, perhaps negative -7. This is the most unprofessional establishment I have ever encountered. I made a reservation two weeks in advance for my brothers graduation for 7 people. However, they sat half of our family behind the chef to where they couldn't see any of the cooking. They claimed they have to \"fill up 8 seats\" so they filled the others with a random couple pushing our family behind the grill EXCEEDING the table limit. The workers were inconsiderate, rude, and condescending. If you want a pleasant experience, DO NOT COME HERE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU OR YOUR FAMILY."}
{"text":"The customer service here is horrible!!! My family decided to order take out dinner from here with our small child, but according to the manager, the policy from the owner is that you cannot Place a kids order to go. We were told that instead of a to go kids order we would have to order every part of the kids meal a la carte which of course would eventually end up being the cost if not more than an adult meal. When asked to explain further and clarify how that made any sense for a family with little kids that did not want to sit in the restaurant, and whose kids would not eat a full adult portion, all the manager could say was \"that's a policy from the owner\". Needless to say, we cancelled our entire order which would have been close to $100 because of this. They would rather lose business than to allow a family with small kids to order their kids meal to go."}
{"text":"V good for meat eaters. Vegetarians have very limited (less than 5) options, but good ones. I wouldn't go there for a regular visit, unless its a company which likes to eat meat/sushi etc."}
{"text":"We went here for sushi because we've tried a few places in the area & they weren't up to par for what we were looking for. I rate this a three. This wasn't the best sushi we had, but so far one of the better sushi places in the area. There may be a language barrier for some of the waitresses, but overall it wasn't a bad place if you are like us & desperate for that sushi fix."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to several hibachi restaurants in Cleveland and Columbus. I can say this has one of the best main entree courses around. The soup and salad lacked some taste, but after that it was very very good. 

If your a fan of sake being squirted in your mouth and a electric atmosphere...this place is for you!

If you come at 11 the entire staff will be drunk!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here multiple times even taking large groups. On this last time, which will be our last time, my 88 year old mother wanted to order from the kids menu, (she doesn't eat much) she's just the sweetest and says \"I'm really just kid at heart!\" Any other restaurant we have asked this loves it and, of course accommodates us. The owner practically fought with us! This was such terrible customer service! We will NOT be returning!"}
{"text":"Bad experience, salmon teriyaki was full of onions. It was basically an onion teriyaki with a side of salmon. On top of that, service was pretty bad. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is my go to on mondays with my husband. We love eating at the hibachi grill and when we have big groups we come and enjoy our time. I love the steak and shrimp hibachi :)"}
{"text":"I had not been to this restaurant in many years. I was shopping in the mall and decided to go. I walked in and couldn't believe it looked the same. I must say extremely dissatisfied with inept staff an more disappointed with the cleanliness standards. This place was filthy in my view. I wonder how the kitchen looks. What a shame this place has become I know it's a long time Tennant of the mall. It needs gutted, cleaned and remodeling would be in order. Make it contemporary. My food was marginal as well as two people with me. I noticed Groupon has certificates available for this business. I think it's going out of business an offering a deal to get you in. Save your money."}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing experience! Went on Tuesday at 5 for a birthday celebration. So much fun! The food was absolutely delicious! The ginger salad could have been a little bit better quality lettuce but everything else was phenomenal! This is also the first hibachi I have ever had that served noodles. Very good! The actual birthday part of the evening was so fun. A little light show, a song and singing, and a really cute dessert with a flower candle! I would highly recommend this place. Plenty of seating too. You wont be waiting long."}
{"text":"Hibachi on fleek!  This place has both hibachi seating and table seating.  Go for hibachi and it won't dissapoint.  This place even gives free sake bottle shots!  My first time here, but when with a group that enjoys going here it seems.  We had an entertaining hibachi chef who did a great job keeping up smiling.

This is located in a newer build shopping center, and has nice fountains and sidewalks around as you walk in.  We went in the rain, and there are even some awnings so you can arrive only mildly wet.

Will definately be back to try the sushi, which looks great from everyone's Yelp photos.  More to come for this review."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to take a chance on Fuji despite mixed reviews. So, we didn't exactly go in with high expectations. Also regarding out review, we decided to be seated at a table versus doing Hibachi, so your experience may vary.

We were seated quickly to a semi-full dining room. It took another ~10 minutes before our waiter came by to ask if someone had already had come by to take our drink order. All said and done, we had been seated for about ~20 minutes before we had our drinks and put in our order. 

Trying to get a cross section of what Fuji offers, we ordered some Edemame for the appetizer, we both ordered an Udon entree, my wife getting the Tempura Udon (soup) and me getting the Udon stir fried with beef. We then also each ordered a sushi roll to try what they had from their sushi bar.

The appetizer came out quickly, as did our main courses. The food was hot and seemed freshly made. That being said, both our main courses were pretty bland. The broth for my wife's Udon soup had very little flavor. 

30 minutes after our main course had come out, our sushi rolls had still not come to the table. We had to find our waitress to see where our rolls were. She brought them to the table quickly after we asked, which makes me thing they were sitting on the counter for a while. They were both OK.

That being said, Fuji Japanese Steakhouse earned the two stars from us. As far as a seated dinner goes, we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Went back for dinner tonight, this time with a Groupon. When the check came there was 18% tip added in, because I used the groupon. The groupon didn't mention it anywhere, and when I asked they said it's their policy, and showed me a printed piece of paper by the door that says that.
I really felt cheated. I would have tipped them well, I always do. But I don't like tip being imposed on me this way. It was a dinner for two, for God's sake!
I ended up paying same amount I would have without the groupon.
Major disappointment!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with a couple of friends. This restaurant is located in a newer area of Charlotte. 

Nice decor strikes you as you enter. We were greeted quickly by a friendly hostess. Service was good here. Very responsive staff. 

We all ordered different Lunch Bente Boxes. They are served with Miso Soup, Fried Shumai, California Roll, White Rice and a Teriyaki, Tempura or Negimaki choice. 

We all liked the food and would return to try dinner to see if this is a four or five star rating. Lunch will run you $12 with an ice tea and tip. 

Big menu with lots of choices."}
{"text":"First and foremost, our Hibachi Chef was the bomb! He had such an amazing personality and he was very easy on the eyes - - that always help. The free sake mouth shot was the cutest. The food was delish, quick, and the Chef entertaining. 

It's all about the group, my group was pretty animated so we had a really great time. We did have a pair of Debbie Downers but what are you gonna do, they left pretty early so... Womp,  Womp, Womp. 

Here is why I gave them 3 stars instead of 5 stars; the wait time on a Saturday night exceeded the 20 mins that we were told. The first interaction w/anyone is the host, who was as personable as a bag of rocks, topped with a lil sour patch of being sour and only sweet as we left... No Bueno! 
 
Once we were seated it was pretty much up hill from there."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Sunday to use a Groupon I had purchased. I've been to this location twice in the past (over 2 years ago) and it was decent but yesterday's experience was terrible. The table we were seated at was dirty, we ordered soft drinks (not complicated) and didn't receive them until after we ordered our food and received our salads (and that's only after asking for them again to which the server acted confused as if we hadn't ordered drinks). My boyfriend ordered sushi which he said was decent but my chicken tempura not only had a hair fried into it that was visible at first glance but also tasted like I was drinking deep fryer oil. I don't have an issue paying a bit more for a really spectacular experience and food but our bill came to $46 before using the Groupon and the food and service was not worth it in my opinion. (I was charged an additional $5 because I wanted fried rice instead of steamed which is insane... it's rice.)  I can get better Japanese food at the carry out place by my house for a quarter of the price. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Horrible - no customer service, our hibachi chef gave no show and went overboard with trying to toss food at us to catch with our mouth, fish was way old and tasted rotten and when you tell them you're not happy with it they don't try and fix their problem to make the customer happy but instead insist it must be you because no one else has ever complained about the fish (have you seen the amount of bad yelp reviews they have???) They are shady about what they charge the customer and don't even try to use their Groupon coupon - they fight you on even accepting the damn thing. Waste of a family outing and they ruined our night. Don't go - they don't want to make your experience pleasant - they just want to take your money!!!"}
{"text":"The sushi is very good. Prices are a little steep, but you get what you pay for! Monday and Tuesday nights offer half off rolls. But I prefer their specialty rolls that they offer at a discount. My favorite roll is called the pink lady. Lots and lots of fresh salmon!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty bad.  You may be able to make it out of there by sticking to cooked food but stay away from the sushi unless you want to pay for it later.  I have been here twice and both times the sushi was really bad.  The last time i was there i was with clients and i did not want to make a scene but the fish was past its prime.  I left half of it uneaten and paid the price for what i did eat."}
{"text":"Love the sushi here. The menu options are also ridiculous. They have so many options it takes me awhile to figure out what to order. The seaweed salad surprisingly is amazing. The sauce/dressing/heavenly substance they mix the seaweed with is on point! Another cool thing is if you sit on the hibachi side, and someone has a birthday near-by, you ultimately get to attend a 20 second rave, as lights flash and japanese techno music blasts. There aren't many negatives I could point out. If I had to knitpick, it is a little annoying you have to ask for forks. I cannot use chopsticks to save anyones life. Also, the waiters/ waitresses are pretty dry, and don't seem too inviting and bubbly. Overall, I would go back multiple times to try the many items on the menu."}
{"text":"I have been here plenty of times and never have I had experience like this. Food was cold and was not cooked correctly along with the waitress not being any help not letting me know what I was getting. Honestly, loss for words."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic... paulina was great and we love jason.. we come in late and were always the last ones to leave."}
{"text":"Yelp rewarded me with a coupon for 50% off any meal from checking in here from the last time i came here so i decided to go in and use my discount. The appetizers here are very affordable to begin with. Everything on the appetizer menu was anywhere from 4 to 6 dollars. So after browsing the menu i decided on the coconut shrimp and i ordered a fiji cosmo because i was feeling real sex in the city vibes on this day. Never have i had a cosmo quite that strong. They were not stingy with the alcohol at all, so that's good for some to know im sure. Coconut shrimp were shockingly good i decided since everything on the menu was so affordable and i had 50% off why the heck not order another appetizer so in addition to the shrimp i ordered the fried rolls. They have won me over for a spot to come and grab appetizers."}
