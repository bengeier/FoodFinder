{"text":"We love their food! Happy Family is a favorite..Lemon chicken great...steamed vegetables are crunchy...not soggy. Like the delivery service!"}
{"text":"So so food. Had kung pao chicken and its just like every other strip mall Chinese joint around here. Lots of celery in the food. Wife had cashew chicken and it looked about the same. Actually if it wasn't for the nuts you couldn't tell them apart by looking at them."}
{"text":"It might just be me but the food made me sick. There wasn't much that was good besides their fried rice."}
{"text":"Ordered a delivery to the ZMax drag park
Very fast delivery and food was hot
General Tsaos chicken combo dinner delicious

Delivery driver was very polite as well as the person taking my order
I would recommend to friends and co workers
I will be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"It's decent Chinese food if you don't have many options. Nothing special, but it's good enough. They deliver which is nice."}
{"text":"We were at a local hotel and decided to order in Chinese. I was a little bit scared of the unknown delivery. For our astonishment the delivery was fast. The food awsome and delicious. Will recommend the Vegetable LoMein and the Chinese donuts. Yummy. I recommend 100%"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've only had delivery and I've never been inside but food always arrives hot and tasty. I've had the egg drop soup, pork fried rice, egg rolls, and general tso chicken and all have been amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for over 7 years. It's pretty good. The man who works at the front is kind. Food is decent quality. Definitely the only place I would go to in Concord/Kannapolis."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!  I have ordered from here twice just because it's convenient to where I live.  I promise I will never make that mistake again.  General Tso chicken tastes like dirty lake water.  They have gotten my order wrong both times.  Beware!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time actually using some else's recommendation and I'm glad I did.  Very tasty food, good portions and reasonable prices.  It was the best money I've spent on Chinese food in Charlotte to date."}
{"text":"We were very pleased with this affordable Chinese restaurant in concord. We decided to dine in and we're happy with the quick service. Our fried wonton were freshly fried and brought out to before our entrees. As with most Chinese restaurants dinner meals are big enough for two. Flavors were good with no too much salt. I personally would have liked a little more heat in the Kung Pao chicken but the flavor and freshness made up for it. The service was friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Food lion strip mall Chinese food, also offers deliver. Experience had always been good and food is exactly as you'd expect."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food ever they give more then enough food you get your money's worth to top it off they're food is always fresh tasting best Chinese food hands down"}
{"text":"So the smart folks at Royal Dragon decided to paper my apartment complex with menus....thank you Royal Dragon!  I live across from the Mills Mall and finding takeout that delivers to us is hard to say the least.  There's a ton of fast food, but zero pizza, chinese or other restaurants that deliver.  Jimmy Johns doesn't count.    

I ordered the beef with garlic sauce, steamed dumplings and Chinese donuts.  Everything arrived very warm and it tasty.  I'm a fan and have found my go too take out.  I think it remarkable that the items were still hot considering the distance.  I look forward to trying the rest of the menu.

If I had to say one negative, it took forever to get my food.  But considering it's a trek I was impressed the food was hot."}
{"text":"Best Chinese I've had since I've lived in Charlotte area (1999)!! I got the orange chicken dinner combo. The coating on the chicken is crispy, the pork fried rice (which I've never liked) is amazing! And the egg roll. Holy moly! Will definitely return more often!"}
{"text":"Our go to take home or delivery Chinese food. I love it when my wife says \"go ahead and order Chinese food\"

Always order the Kung pow chicken, it's a little spicy but very flavorful. Egg rolls are solid. We also order the pork fried rice, sesame chicken and steamed dumplings.

They are pretty consistent, we have always enjoyed our meals. 

Recently I ordered a few different dishes for my out of town family that was visiting. So I ventured out of my comfort zone order included steamed vegetables, General Tso chicken and wonton soup, all I can say is there were no leftovers. My family was impressed they preferred the boneless pork spare ribs to the ones they get in New Jersey."}
{"text":"We Delivery!  Well u can also eat in as we found out yesterday.  We were in the neighborhood and found this place through yelp.  

The address is a little off if you are using GPS.  Just know it is in the Food Lion stripmall area.

It is very typical Chinese food (and some curry dishes??  lol)  The interior was very much McDonalds leftover furniture - super plain jane.  Tons of people were coming through for pickup orders when we were sitting there.  The food is about $8 bucks for each dish like your typical lo mein and General Tso's chicken.  Everything was very normal about this place and if it was closer to uptown I would definitely go back for the rare Chinese food craving."}
{"text":"When I originally ordered from  this restaurant back in summer of 2016 the food was horrible, I gave it a second chance with same results; bad.  I gave it a try again a couple of months ago and something changed.  The food I received was tasty and the establishment didn't smell as if there were something bad happening in the back.  I've since ordered from there  2-3 more times and to date have been pleased."}
{"text":"Every neighborhood should have one of these - a good, quick, friendly, inexpensive Chinese restaurant. I would not drive 20 miles out of my way to eat here, but if you're in the vicinity you cannot go wrong. If you're looking for gourmet food, go elsewhere, but if you want your basic old-school dinner combo with tasty egg rolls and fried rice, individually prepared in 10 minutes, you're good to go."}
{"text":"Typical neighborhood Chinese food joint.  No frills, hard to understand when taking your order, you know the routine.  My girlfriend and I had a special request from my daughter for Chinese while driving around in BFE and this was the closest place we could find.  Hidden in the Food Lion, mini mall area (?) was Royal Dragon.  I had the chicken lo mein which was good, but again, so very generic that it didn't really leave an impression.

My suggestion, if you are in the area and want a quick Chinese food fix, hit this spot up.  Otherwise go to my favorite Chinese place, PF Changs!

PS....yes I was hungry 30 minutes later :)"}
{"text":"I had the chicken w/cashews. Really good flavor with a good amount of veggies. ( I would have liked more baby corn just because I like it but I am not complaining.) 

My friend decided to try beef & broccoli for the 1st time, she liked hers too. The portions were pretty good, a ton of rice. Each came with an egg roll which I was happy about as I seem to have an egg roll addiction lately. 

Overall a good place, would eat here again for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is not so good the delivery time is average but the food quality is below average only thing they have going for them is it's the only place that delivers around the concord mills area."}
{"text":"I normally don't complain, but I couldn't let this one go. I ordered carry out last night and service was slow even though there was only one order in front of me. The worst was when I got home to eat it. My sesame chicken and rice tasted like something that had been heated up multiple times in a microwave! It was chewy and tasted old. I couldn't even eat it!  Was really hoping for a better experience for my first time there. I won't be returning!"}
{"text":"I love this place. We come here almost weekly for take-out. The food is always hot and fresh, and the flavor profiles are always consistent. I order the same thing each time and it's great each time. I highly recommend it."}
