{"text":"I went to shake shack the other night as it was on my list of places to try in Vegas . Easy access this time because I stayed at the MGM Hotel. Not impressed at all, actually disappointed in the place . Pricey and lacking burger !! After ordering the double bacon burger and milk shake , mouth was waiting for explosion . Total flop after opening up the bag to see this small ass burger. Needless to say this place was a dud to me IMO . Oh yea the shake was also a bust for me . Never to return !! Glad there was no line when I went."}
{"text":"The burgers seem smaller than I remember, and the prices are NYC prices ($18 for a burger, fries and tiny custard). As others have said, the place is way over priced. Food took way too long for the 2 people in line before me. I did like the burger, and I liked not waiting in line for an hour like you need to do in NYC, but still not doing it for me."}
{"text":"I love shake  shack it's very relaxing and  the people is uplifting and always joyful it's very clean and I love the big screen TV so you can watch your sports it's a perfect setting to be outside or inside I go there all the time"}
{"text":"I loved the SmokeShack burger and the cheese fries! I have to refrain from how many times I eat here every time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Everyone loves to compare it to In-N-Out because of it's freshness and simplicity, but it tastes nothing like an In-N-Out burger!
It has a delicious sauce on it, the meat is seasoned differently...
It's less comfort food and more delicious. 

Great if you're looking for a quick bite. About a 10 minute wait around noon. Quality Food. Nice Employees. Chill interior.

I would come back every-time I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"food ordered: shackburger, chicken dog, strawberry shake, fries

food: Well.... wanted to order their smokestack burger, but they ran out of bacon. wanted to order the shackmeister dog, but they ran out of cheese sauce. wanted the cheese fries, they ran out of cheese. sense a pattern going on...?  we ended up with a shackburger, chicken dog and regular fries.... They just opened on Mon 12/29 and we were there on Fri 1/2.  Whoever does their inventory ordering should have done some damage control and gotten a rush shipment cuz it looked like they ran out of half their menu items!  from the food that we DID end up getting... the burger was tasty, a little on the smaller side. I could have eaten two!  fries were nicely flavored and crispy.  chicken dog was a bit dry, the chicken sausage was slit down the middle then grilled so lost a lot of it's juices and flavors. it was getting close to being chicken jerky...  the winner winner for me was probably the strawberry shake. very rich in flavor.

misc: located outside of the newly renovated NY NY bridge area. plenty of seating inside the restaurant, but the restaurant gets very busy, so finding somewhere to sit is a little difficult sometimes."}
{"text":"This is probably my go to spot for burgers when I'm in Vegas.  There is a great menu and variety. In addition to the great hamburgers they also have delicious hot dogs. Their fries are really fun to eat and easy to dip into sauces. The sauce bar is very convenient and you can take as much as you need."}
{"text":"Great. Food is as good or better than many nyc locations, service is better, waits are shorter."}
{"text":"I was excited about trying this place..I heard it was better than In & Out..NO WAY!

The line moves fast but they just can't get ur order right...I went at 2pm..not really the lunch rush..  


I had to go back 3 or four times to have them fix my order once my food was ready....it took them over 15 minutes to fix the order....by that time everyone else was practically done eating....

I don't understand what all the hype is...the burger  was ur typical fast food burger with more cheese and fat....that all I could taste anyway..cheese and grease.

Bottle line...nothing special not worth the hype in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Why?

It's McDonald's with better decor and horrible crinkle cut French fries.

And it's expensive for what it is. Staff are slow and seem bored with life. 

 Go next door to thirsty lion. Better beer and best burger in town without all the hipsters and bored employees."}
{"text":"This was my first time having a meal at Shake Shack so I had high expectations based on what I have read from the media.  Well, I gave them a four star because in spite of the great location, the shack burger and the shakes did not feel like it was worth the five star for me.  It was definitely worth a try.  My friend and I sat outside so we got to people-watch as we devoured our hamburgers."}
{"text":"A week after I posted my review, a shake shack employer hmu to convince me to give them another try.  I am not sure what this entails, but offering me free garbage called shake shack isn't going to change my yelp posting.  Your food is trash and I won't consume another bite."}
{"text":"Your \"chicken sandwich\" didn't make it to nirvana? Ordered a \"chicken dog\" by mistake? Tried the \"shroom burger\" and it wasn't perfection? 

The problem is you, not them. They had to fill out the menu with something, especially for those non red-meat eaters. You should have ordered the shake double, with no sauce. Perfection; and I don't say that lightly. 

My favorite burgers are the ones I make. Sure, I can get in 'n out and feed a craving. Or, hit Johnny's on a good day and be pretty satisfied. But until I ate Shake Shack's Double Cheese, I didn't realize that having no condiments on a burger and loving it is a huge win. Juicy, cheesy, flavorful, with the crunch from lettuce and sweetness from tomatoes. Nir-van-a! 

I'm from Seattle, I know Nir-van-a. Throw some crunch-chewy fries and a shake with your double cheese (Ok, two) and you're having a great day.

Shake it off and set your GPS for Shake Shack.

T"}
{"text":"I'd have given this a 5 star but the drinks are SMALL for the price. My fries were warm...not hot like the husband's but his had cheese. The burgers were AMAZING."}
{"text":"Had the chick'n shack, a half & half vanilla/chocolate shake, and fries. If you like fried food, you definitely have to get the chicken sandwich. Better than chick-fil-a."}
{"text":"Really cute atmosphere. 

They have outside seating so you can people watch on the strip. 

Counter service. They have a greeting while u waiting in line that enthusiastically friendly. 

The food- burgers have quality ingredients. The bread is flavorful and soft. The bacon is cooked to perfection. The cherry peppers contrast in flavor. The meat has that perfect sear. They have refile crinkle cut fries. We got them with cheese sauce that was ok. Their milkshakes are made with real ice cream. 

Locals, I wouldn't drive across town for it, but if you're on the strip, definitely check it out."}
{"text":"The restaurant was really clean. Great service. I got the smoke shack burger and really liked it. The price of my meal was pretty reasonable. I didn't get any shakes this time but I will be going back and I'll get one then."}
{"text":"First time at the shake shack.  Ordered the smoke shack without cheese, fries, and a drink.  The burger had good flavor and the cherry peppers were a nice addition.  The fries were crispy and plentiful.  My biggest gripe would be the cost, over $12 for everything seems a bit steep and the fact that I can't refill my drink without going to the counter is annoying.  All in all a solid burger, but smashburger is still my go-to place and they have many more locations in my area."}
{"text":"The place was very busy. QUICK  AND GOOD SERVICE. BUT I prefer In &out and smash burger they have better burgers."}
{"text":"Smoke bacon whatever burger and fries were basically the best ever. Five stars, would eat again."}
{"text":"We have a new one coming to Scottsdale Quarter.  Excited to check it out!  Excellent experience at other location."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, and really enioyed myself. I had the Double Shack Burger, Fries, and a Peanut Butter Shake. The food was excellent! It was all very hot and very fresh. The shake was really great, and had tons of flavor. In addition to the food, the restaurant itself is neat. The table I sat at was made from old NY bowling lanes. My only complaint was that the cashier lacked enthusiasm. But overall, the food and the restaurant itself were very neat, and definitely worth experiencing at least once."}
{"text":"I tried their burger a while back, it didn't seem to me that it is that much different than what I would get at MacDonald?  May be Shake Shack has it more juicy but taste wise, it is just the same as the rest of the burger places.  I wouldn't go out of my way to look for them if I wanted to eat a burger but if I come across one and I happen to be in the mood for one then I would give it another shot!"}
{"text":"Burger was delicious although the fries were nothing to write home about. Good, but average. Staff was super friendly and the atmosphere is fun and casual. Great cheap eat on the Strip with burgers starting about 5 bucks.

I didn't get a shake, but several in my party did. One comment \"not as good as Steak and Shake.\"

So maybe skip the fries and shake and just grab two burgers because they're awesome."}
{"text":"Being generous with that extra star...

So I came here today after some raving reviews from a friend of mine. She likes this place over In-N-Out and it's super delicious blah blah blah.

Came around 2pm to a short line outside and spoke to the usher guy outside who says he eats 4 of these things a day and brings then back home to his wife...so I start thinking...\"how big are these burgers?\". He explains how the menu works and all that good stuff.

Went inside and waited in the second line and looked over the decor...I don't care...It's about the food. Just looked kinda hipster/umami-esq...No big deal.

Ended up getting a single of the one with bacon and peppers while the gf got a single of their claim to fame (sorry I forget the names). I opted for the single because I couldn't get myself to spend 3 extra dollars for a 4oz meat patty. I got the Chicago style hot dog instead to try more of the menu and fries and topped it off with a concrete (kinda like a blizzard from DQ) with the strawberry and waffle pieces. Got a side of fries and bill came to $28 bucks....whoo...that's...a lot.

Got the pager and waited a few...then got the food. 

First impressions: looks good. Kinda on the small side burger wise. I little smaller than In-N-Out but bigger patties. Gf has one tomato and one piece of lettuce, mine has a good amount of bacon and peppers. Nice crinkle fries and good looking concrete. Thought a single scoop is pretty small for the price. Chicago dog was Nathan's small but looked the part without the nuclear green relish.

Taste: bacon was good and peppers had little bite. No lettuce or tomato for this...Kinda disappointed. Tasted good but not OMG best thing ever! Bread was like a mix of brioche and hawaiian and was split but not all the way so ended up like a pocket thing. Gf's was good but ordinary. Shack sauce was kinda lacking. Nothing special. The dog was good. Split and grilled. Good condiments but no casing so no \"snap\". The fries are great. Crinkle kept the crunch. Although...for a burger place that tries to exemplify organic and no GMO \"specialty\" burger place, I would have expected real potatoes...not some Sysco or Ore-Ida frozen potatoes for fries. The concrete was good. I liked that. The waffle pieces were crunchy and tasty. The strawberry was good and the ice cream was good. Note I say ice cream...not custard as they advertise. I've had frozen custard...and it had a certain consistency and smoothness and taste...totally different than froyo and ice cream..but this...this was ice cream.

Final thoughts: I'd come here for dessert. I think the burgers are WAY overpriced. $9 for a small double cheese burger is not worth it. You could get gourmet gastro pub type burgers (huge 1/2 or 1/3lb with all kinds of oddball toppings) for that price. They offer no \"combos\" to help out the pricing. Taste was mediocre. And comparing to major competitors, In-N-Out to me has more flavor, but if not even that...give more veggies and for $9 you can have 3 patties, real hand cut fries, and a drink. 5 guys has many toppings, homestyle taste, fresh cut fries, and a drink as well for around the same price. 

I was lucky I was in Vegas to try this place out where spending money comes easy. If it had been at home, I'd be very angry."}
{"text":"I think comparing the burger to In N Out - In N Out has a superior bun and sauce, but Shake Shack has better meat patties, and def wayyy better fries. I mean, crinkle fries? No contest!"}
{"text":"Awesome. This place makes the dream of hitting up Shake Shack AND In N Out in the same day a reality. And you can get Cane's the same day too. Way to go, Vegas, you're the best."}
{"text":"Après avoir beaucoup entendu parler de ce restaurant j'ai pu enfin l'essayer à Las Vegas...
Le burger était splendide et joliment emballé! Et le goût....juste trop bon !!! Dommage qu'il ne soit pas un peu plus gros peut être...mais bon les petits plaisirs sont les meilleurs...."}
{"text":"This place was all hyped up when it opened in Las Vegas but, honestly, I just don't get it.  It's not that the food was bad, it's just that it's marginal. I'll take a good In-N-Out or Five Guys burger over Shake Shack any day. The prices at this location are high, probably because it's on the Strip.  I hear they've opened another one in Summerlin - maybe the prices are lower. 

So... pros and cons:

+ The fries are very good, probably better than In-N-Out, but a notch below Five Guys
+ Location is cool, great outdoor seating, view of the Strip
+ Shakes are very, very good

- Shakes are very, very small for the price
- No soda refills
- Busy and noisy (full of tourists)
- Burgers are marginal and a bit small

So, maybe just maybe you should visit Shake Shack to say you've been there. As for me, bring on the Five Guys."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great atmosphere. Loved Shake Shack when we visited New York so we were really excited when we found out it had arrived in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I'm a big condiments person and didn't need it at all! Their special sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"My friend was raving that this was the only place he cared about eating in Vegas. He wasn't wrong! The cheeseburger was the best I've had and the fries are delicious too. I think it's reasonably priced for the quality you get. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Shake shack is always amazing! I have never had a bad experience here! The burger was amazing. I did have their new cheddar bacon fries. I prefer the cheese more then the regular cheese fries. 

I am always looking to return for another amazing shake shack experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I got the Shack stack with cheese fries and it was fabulous! The mushroom gooey cheesy goodness on the burger was amazing! I would highly recommend! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The bacon burger is okay but to me wasn't worth the price. Maybe since its Vegas the price is a little higher compared to the east coast where they originate. Crinkle cut fries were good, and the cheese fries were a little too cheesy. The cheese kind of tasted like scrambled eggs. Overall the red peppers in the bacon burger was different and I appreciate signature burgers! If I come back I'd get maybe the basic burger (shack burger) and ask for the double. 
The shake was good. Had the \"black and white\" malt. The atmosphere/ decor is really modern.

For me though in-n-out has a significant advantage over this place."}
{"text":"***No fries with this shake.***
No thank you. Never again. This is not a spot for locals unless you love suffering the overpriced tourist traps. The food is fast food quality, nothing special. The atmosphere is loud and a seat-yourself-not-enough seats is not cute or fun."}
{"text":"Didn't expect this awesome dining experience for my quick lunch before red rock! The staffs are extremely friendly, the food are delicious, and love the modern interior design. What made it even better, it's extremely PET FRIENDLY! Was waiting outside and people walking by asked me to bring my dog in, they even have dog treat on their menu. 

What I ordered:
-Shack stack burger: extremely flavoured, juicy beef patty with fried portobello, sooooo good! When you take the bite, the warm cheese will explode!!
-Cheese fries: fat food are always good:)
- Summerlin S'more: house made chocolate ice cream with marshmallow and cookie, highly recommended!

First time dining here and I think I'll always stop and go in whenever I see shack shack!"}
{"text":"I went in on a Friday afternoon. The restaurant was buzzing...always a good sign. So I ordered the smoke shack and cheese fries and I quickly got them. The first thing I noticed was the buns, they looked very fluffy and moist and had a nice sheen to them. I loved the burger, the meat was flavorful and the cherry peppers gave a nice sweet taste with a little bit of heat. I think the bun was my favorite and the bacon second.  I  had the camel shake for dessert. Think creamy custard meets banana cream pie with bits of piecrust, it was phenomenal and it had salted caramel. I'm definitely coming again."}
{"text":"The burgers are really good but it's so pricey! There's also a long line so it was annoying. We would rather go to in n out next time."}
{"text":"I love love love shake shack!! I come here every single time we're in vegas! The bun on the burgers is so soft and their sauce is so tasty! Their chicken sandwich is so delicious too! Cheese fries are a must!"}
{"text":"I don't get what you pay up for that the amount is worth coming back to be honest.  Food is really good but not for what they charge for."}
{"text":"I see a lot of people comparing shake shack to in n out and I'll be straight up about that in n out is still Better. Haha you could never compare the almighty in n out to anything. As far as Shake shack, the food reminded me of a Wendy's bacon burger but bigger non squar patties and better taste. Only thing that made it different was the cherry peppers and sauce. But watch if u think you'll be like damn this guy is right. I had smoke shack double and fries and wasn't full after, Im literally going order more food bc I wasn't that impressed. Heard so much hype about this spot but it was nothing orgasmic or like made me wanna react like this a miracle of a burger. Mind you this based on what I ate. I didn't try any desserts or anything else. The pricing is way overpriced probably because it's founded in New York. I'm west coast born and raised so I'll always be biast. If I visited New York again I would not go out of my way to go to shake shack, I bet no one has said that yet... That alone should change ur mind. This is suppose to be a New York staple and it was whatever. I spent 15 dollars on a burger, fries, and drinks that alone ruined my appetite. Pricing is mayb more then New York to bc its on the strip. Who knows ..the pricing sucked for what your getting. Don't get me wrong the burger was a bomb ass burger cooked medium well...but damn 9.49 for a double burger...2.95 for freezer fries..2.25 for reg soda that was the size of a water cup.I thought this was suppose to be fast food not a restaurant I don't know what it was but mayb I should of asked for sauces on the side to dip in or customize my burger... Something to make me feel like I didn't get ripped off......... 

Well round two let's see what's up. Hopefully this time it redeems my first experience. Ok round two was ten times better then my first round. Get the shack stack and a concrete and don't mess with anything else. That burger alone did it for me. Might be one of the best burgers I've ever had tell u the truth. So if your a shroom lover its on"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for food. Burgers, fries and I got a vanilla milkshake. It was really good! Super crowded, as all Vegas food stops are after 1am, but it worked its wonders just fine. The burgers were hot and cheesy, with I think bacon (?) and the fries, while yummy, weren't amazing. I would've been happy with the burger and shake. The shake was very thick and it was amusing to me in my drunken state to try to drink it. I dipped some of my fries in it, which did make the fries better."}
{"text":"So I kind of get it. I am an In-N-Out girl, but I can see the hype around shake shack. The regular burger is definitely not comparable to In-N-Out, but they do have a pretty delicious chicken burger and their frozen concrete is something I crave from time to time. The restaurant is in a great location, Downtown Summerlin, somewhere I shop at often so it's convenient for me. 
The chicken burger is delicious as well as the concrete. The strawberry lemonade is refreshing and not too sweet. I also tried the fried tomato, vegetarian burger and I was sick of it after two bites. It had way too much cheese in it that it was overwhelming. The regular BLT is okay, I would prefer in-n-out over theirs any day. The cheese fries are probably my favorite thing on the menu. For the dog menu, my dog definitely gives their poochi-ini a thumbs up (if he had thumbs). 
All together I would give Shake Shack 4 stars at most. However, this 5 star review is really for one of the managers at Shake Shack. I was shopping alone with my dog and the restaurant doesn't allow dogs inside. I couldn't leave my dog outside so the manager, Daniel, kindly came outside to take my order and brought it out for me. He was very kind and went above and beyond to bring out a water bowl for my dog as well. Although this is not something they do often and because it wasn't a very busy evening, Daniel did me this tremendous favor because I was really craving for a frozen custard as well as my dog (it was 100 degrees Fahrenheit that day). I thought it was something very considerate and I appreciate it beyond belief; for that I give this place five stars."}
{"text":"This burger is fantastic!  I'm a big fan of In N Out and Five Guys, but this one beats them both in terms of burgers.  Now their fries on the other hand were not good at all.  Typical frozen crinkle cut fries that you can get in your grocers freezers and actually taste just like that.  Nothing good about them at all. 

The burger is super greasy and delicious.  Very similar style to Super Duper burger in San Francisco.  Great beef and cheese.  Love it."}
{"text":"First time trying shake shack. Great burgers. Cheese fries were ok. The strawberry mint lemonade was"}
{"text":"For a simple burger with lettuce tomatoes pickles and sauce it was so good definitely coming back"}
{"text":"shake shack burger sucks!!! read an article where the bought out taster said it was better than in & out...well, your almost $6.00 simple burger didn't come close to the $2,20 in & out burger....and by the way mine came tasting like bacon with some bacon crumbs from some idiot frying it next to the bacon or on the same grill......the bun was like eating Styrofoam and the cheese tasted fake...."}
{"text":"This isn't in n out but good so eat here to help their business yummy and get the concrete custard thingies and crinkle fries"}
{"text":"My husband and I were planning to find gelato at Monte Carlo, but on our walk from NYNY to Monte Carlo, we saw this new place and was attracted by the fact that they use hormone/antibiotics free beef for burger, so we changed course and decided to try this place instead of getting gelato. 

We went around dinner time at night on a Tuesday and it was packed. Long line, a lot of occupied tables.
I had the double hamburger, my husband got a single hamburger, and we shared a concrete (vanilla frozen custard with strawberry puree). I like the burger a lot. I specifically asked them if they cook the patty with nut oil or soy oil and they said no, so it is awesome for me due to my allergy. And I also didn't get the shack sauce as there is soy in it. I like the burger as it is simply beef flavor. I am actually the type who don't like too many things going on making me not tasting the beef. I eat beef for liking the beef taste, not the condiment. So I like the way they do it, fits my need. And the burger is a bit greasy which I have no problem with, I like beef patty having the beef fat taste, I hate those that has plant oil taste. It is just my preference and they happened to fit my need. I also can tell the difference in taste for hormone free beef and conventional beef. I don't like the taste of the beef that was raised with hormones or antibiotics. So another reason I like the taste of shake shack burger.

We both like the concrete, the dairy tasted fresh and soft, the texture was good, the creaminess was right, good consistency, I was so glad that I had this instead of gelato. 

I know I can probably make the same quality of beef patty at home as long as I go to Whole Foods to get the hormone free or even organic beef. But honestly, when you eat out, the reason is that you don't have time to cook or even do dishes, or you are on the street being hungry and need to be fed right away. So I can't say that it is not special because I could probably make the same thing at home. The price is not bad too. And I got to eat the way I want without cleaning all the grease splattering around my stove and countertop. And I don't think I have the stamina to make fresh ice cream daily myself too though I am capable. So yah, I recommend this place if you are like me who don't eat conventional beef or dairy. I like every bite I had here. 

A note for people who have allergy. Their fries are made with just potato, no additives, but fried in soy oil, so if you have soy allergy, don't do fries then. The hot dog is also made with hormone free, antibiotic free meat, and there is no nitrite or nitrate, we are gonna try the hot dog next time when we are around the area. If you have allergy, tell the cashier so he/she can tell you what items you shouldn't try."}
{"text":"The burgers are so delicious! My hubby has a shack stack and I had the smoked stack they were so good, taste like real burger meat, there's also hot dogs, fries and veggie burgers. No combos but soda is so good tastes like Mexican coke! It's pricey but worth it, definitely worth eating!"}
{"text":"I got the only vegetarian option on the menu and it was so gross. I wouldn't recommend this place if you don't eat red meat. The fries and shake we decent but I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Move over in n out this place got it going on.  Good prices even better tasting than most hamburger joints. Everything perfect great service great food great price."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our lunch, and so did the boys!!! We got them Pooch-ini. The food is great!!!' They also brought them a big bowl of water.  As long as your dogs are well-behaved and friendly to other dogs, this is a place to enjoy lunch with your fur babies. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Driven by a few times and today I finally made a stop in, and the last thing I was was disappointed. Amazing service, great staff, and the food was extraordinary; however, the place did seem a little messy. The dinning area was covered in used napkins under the tables, straw wrappers, and crumbs. Other than that, I will for sure be stopping in for my cheese fries!"}
{"text":"There is something about this burger that I really like. Yes, I live and have grown up in SoCal and know all out IN-N-OUT, but this is a really good burger. The bun is different and good. I have tried their single and double shack burger and default back to their double. 

Their cheesy fires are different, which makes them good and have also tried their other fries with cheese, bacon and peppers - those honestly weren't anything to write home about. 

Their burgers though, are good. Hopefully they make their way to San Diego soon!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the service and size of burger.

My milk shake took longer than my burger and fries and was too thick to drink....I had to let it melt a little before I could drink it.

Customer service was horrible and very when I asked about my shake."}
{"text":"Came to try out their burger after all the hype coming out of New York.  I just ordered their basic double cheeseburger and cheese fries.  I was underwhelmed.  It tasted pretty basic for a burger.  It tasted good, but I didn't see what all the hype was about.  And its definitely not a burger that I would wait a long time in line to get.  

Pros: Bun was nice, meat quality was good, and veggies were fresh.  
Cons: pretty small sized burger, even for a double burger.  I was still hungry afterwards.  And the cheese tasted pretty cheap.  Cheese whiz?  Didn't do anything for the fries but make them soggy.  Crinkly Cut French Fries?  What is this, High School?  If I am paying premium, I expect better french fries.  Overpriced for what you get.  

I would rather have In-N-Out, Fatburger, or Five Guys over Shake Shack.  I do think NY has it over the rest of the country in regards to pizza and bagels.  But for their burgers, they can go back to the end of the line."}
{"text":"I was just in vegas over the weekend and I ate here 3 times! We just kept going back for more and it was just as good every time. Not only was it amazing but It was by far the least expensive meal in vegas at only $9 for a burger! I got the shake stack which is a patty topped with a deep fried stuffed portobello mushroom, it was perfect from the first bite to the last! 

Way to love up to the name!"}
{"text":"Man this place is good. However, is it worth standing in line for hours like the New Yorkers do? - no. We had a great burger and dog no doubt, and luckily we went around 9:30 pm so the line was reasonable. I'd recommend that you hit it at odd hours like we did"}
{"text":"This place is legit. I am not sure if there is a better bang for your buck on the strip to be honest. I think the burger was $5.99 and a double is not much more. I have had one of each and both were great although the bun to meat/cheese ratio is better with the single. The most expensive part imo were the fries and drinks, but definitely worth getting to complete the meal. If I had to describe the burger, I would say it resembles a slightly smaller Ruby's Cheeseburger. You know, tastes like it was fried in butter or something. Whatever it is, it tastes great. Note that it's a different style burger than In-N-Out, which is amazing in its own right. Fries were crinkle cut like Del Taco, but they were better, more crispy I would say. Shakes were good too, not as good as a Ruby's shake but you wont be disappointed with the purchase.  I went twice on my last 2.5 day visit to Vegas, it was that good. In closing, this is an amazing food choice for a quick meal if you have other plans for the night. 

I did not get a beer here, but they have above average choices (craft) if you need to re-energize your drunken state of mind. 

Customer service was great too; the cashiers and food attendants were nice both times.

Location is right outside NY NY Casino, which is perfect for me as I hang out in the MGM - Bellagio region of the strip. 

My exact meal that the review referenced was just a plain meat and cheese only burger, one time a double and the other time a single. Fries, and a Neapolitan shake were also ordered. My only complaint is they charge extra to mix flavors on the shake, which is ridiculous.

Also, can't comment on how true this is to the one in NY, as I have not been. I can vouch that I love burgers and am quite picky with them. I gladly give this the kev-dog stamp of approval and think you will enjoy this burger very much."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food! Food came out quick for having a lot of people waiting and the service was very amicable. I highly recommend for any prospective individual looking for organic fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"This place was really good! I loved the burgers, we came twice! The walk is not long from the Aura, and it is worth the walk anyway! Amazing!"}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack burgers!  Always eat them when on the east coast (NYC, DC, Miami).  So glad there's a new location in Vegas now.  I'm not a fan of their fries though.  Don't eat shakes so can't comment on that."}
{"text":"This is best burger I have ever had period.  Better than all the high priced burger places on strip and better than in and out.   

Burger was simply perfect combo of beef and bun and cheese and special sauce."}
{"text":"Place is  good, clean modern restaurant ,  although the girl who took our order seemed to be having a bad day, if u don't like your job she should just quit , stay home or something , I wasn't  feeling her facial expressions... Wasn't very helpful ... Stay home next time thanks"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Shake Shack. The we order burgers, chick burger, hot dog, cheesy fries and the rootbeer float.  The food was so fresh and tasty. My toddler tipped over the rootbeer float onto her meal. They replaced her meal and the float while I cleaned the table, fair trade in my opinion. 

I will come back every trip to Vegas. So much better than In and Out burgers!!!!!"}
{"text":"Burger not bad but have had better. Strawberry shake was great. Don't get the chocolate shake. It's gritty, like they made it with powdered chocolate. Fries are good but could make the same at home."}
{"text":"OMG! I absolutely hate this place. I'm just going to shoot right to the point. This place completely rips you off on portions. The average size of sandwiches are a total joke and more suitable for the appetite of toddlers. They even rip you off on the drinks. There is no accessible fountain for refills. The employees have to do it for you. Dump a ton of ice in a cup and pour 1/4 fluid in the cup and it's done. I wonder how many thousands of dollars a month this place saves by ripping people off with small portions. Make more comfortable seats. Terrible experience altogether. Terrible business."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located at New York New York, which is fitting since this place is originated from the state New York.

The Smokeshack Burger is very good.  The hint of spice is a great touch.  The malt shakes are also really good.  The fries were average.  Despite how busy it was, the wait was short and the food came out quick.

There are some interesting seating choices here, including chairs you would find in your backyard.

I'll definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Ok, I always thought that In & Out was the best burger in the world (in the US at least), but I am afraid to say that Shake Shack, to me, is actually better! And they also serve wine & beer! Try them out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Honestly this is the best fast food place!Everyone comes in with such a high expectation but you really don't get disappointed (sometimes the wait might have been too long). Their food is very high quality but is at a reasonable price. Their burger is juicy and the buns are extremely soft. We also ordered the fries and it's just as good as the burger. Highly recommended if you are craving for burger!"}
{"text":"Had it the first time in NYC. I liked it. Happy to have in Arizona.  Had a cheeseburge and fries. Hubby had shack burger with everything and a salted carmel shake. It was amazing."}
{"text":"As others have said, they make a tastey burger. I had the Smoke Shack. The meat is good quality, the cheese, bacon and sauce were very good. The peppers made it next level however. The cheese fries were good and the service was good as well.
The prices...not good. $6.84 for a burger isn't a lot to ask, and while my Smoke Shack was very good, I think $4.99 is more reasonable. $24 for 2 burgers, 1 cheese fries and 2 cokes is somewhat disconcerting.
I'm close enough to walk here. And I'd like to frequent often. But it's not cost prohibitive. I understand that having a spot, never mind a marquee spot, in Uptown Plaza is pricey, but I'd think the lack of REAL competition (burger wise) in the immediate area would do well to drive business.
Bring the prices down and you'll see my daughter and I often. I think many would echo this sentiment. I hope people are listening. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"The mushroom burger is delicious and crispy on the outside while soft on the inside. The bun is soft and more of a brioche type. A downside is that the burgers are pretty small and not very filling (and that's what I say as a short European girl who doesn't eat massive portions!)
The fries are average. 
The concretes (something between a soft serve and a milkshake) are good but nothing special. Mainly pretty sweet and plain in taste.
All in all it is alright food but comparably pricey for the size of the serve. In that price range I'd rather choose Five Guys because of more reasonable portion sizes. In the range of the burger I'd rather choose In n Out because of similar quality and portions size to remarkably lower prices. But it is still  worth a try!

Fun Fact: The Camel Shake was created for the Phoenix region and is only served here. 5% of the money from the Camel goes to children's charity in the valley."}
{"text":"over-rated

over-hyped

over-priced

burgers are average at best

fries are frozen and heated

cheese - you call that cheese?

same as mcdonalds, only you are paying 600  percent more"}
{"text":"This Shake Shack location's consistency is a bit off. My Shack Burger didn't have that satisfying crunchy crown on the patty that I like, and the seasonal lemonade was too sweet. Still much better than In 'n' Out, though. ;)"}
{"text":"OMG, I finally had food here and it was everything I imagined. The burgers were definitely worth the stomach ache I had shortly after eating there (I eat beef 2-3 times yearly and it happens whenever I eat it, not their fault). I would put this on top on my todo list!"}
{"text":"After trying out this joint in New York. We want to check out the Vegas location.  I ordered the cheese burger with bacon and pepper... been craving for that salty flavor burger. Line was quick when ordering. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has ruined Kierland Commons!  It was loud, discombobulated and the food is way overpriced (and exceptionally greasy). We also waited 20 minutes for one burger. The line to order and the seating is super awkward and uncomfortable.  I'm not sure what the hype is all about. Very disappointed! Also, how do you justify paying $6.00 for a small shake?  Do yourself a favor and go to Five Guys or In and Out for a better burger and experience (and much less expensive)."}
{"text":"Amazing food & service!  Manager Shawn Zangler went out of her way to return a lost wallet to a friend & was super helpful & kind. Thank you!  We'll be back!  :)"}
{"text":"Am I dreaming or am I really on the strip ordering a burger and fries for less than $13.00....  Nope!  Not only is it super affordable for strip prices, its really good too!  One of the managers came into our shop and told us to check it out.  So, we did!  Completly happy we did too!  

Our order consisted of one of the Shake Shack Burgers -omg!!!  I could eat those mushroom filled caps any day!  They stuff a portabella mushroom cap with Munster and some other cheese then they roll it in bread crumbs and deep fry it. The result is a crispy shroom with gooey cheese pouring out of it. Add the rest of the normal burger fillings and you got a match made in heaven.   

In addition to our burgers we ordered the following: 


Cheese fries- honestly, they didn't look like much at all but they were simple and pretty darn good. 

Beer float - they put a scoop of their creamy vanilla custard in a cup with dark, almost tart beer. Not sure if I would order this again but it was good and the flavors completely complemented each other. 

Cranberry-Ginger Lemonade - no artificial flavor here, quenched our thirst and tasted like fresh and spicy ginger."}
{"text":"If I could give them a 0 we ordered our food at 1230 it is now 155 and I still don't have my hot dog or shake  I will never come here again I'm Very disappointed I Gave Them The benifit Of It being the craziest ever but FUCK This place"}
{"text":"I really don't see what all the fuss is all about. The quality of the burger is not that great. I had a bacon cheeseburger the smoke shack they call it, the burger was dry and all the chopped up cherry peppers dominated the whole burger and were very vinegary.I will stick with in and out"}
{"text":"Only gave it a 1 because I couldn't give negative 5. I walked up to the establishment and was informed by an employee at the door that it was 10:07 pm and they were closed. He was polite, my friend and I walked away. A group of people were getting out of their car as we were leaving and we informed them that the restaurant was closed. The group of 6 people headed in without issue and were able to enter into the line to order with no problem. I returned to speak to a manager and informed them of the situation. There was no resolve. I would like to add that my friend and I are African American and the group were Caucasians. I am very disappointed with this discriminatory experience, the behaviors displayed by employees of this establishment were totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"They didn't do anything wrong. Just didn't enjoy the food. Burger was over powered with cheese and sauce. Fries looked and tasted like what you can get from the freezer section. Raspberry lemonade was bitter. Not sour. Bitter. And the Oreo shake was disappointing because it just tasted like chocolate. Just not for me, especially at that price."}
{"text":"Not impressed. My husband has been looking forward to trying this restaurant since it opened in Vegas but we just haven't made it over to the New York, New York location on the Strip. When it opened in Summerlin, we went the first day for lunch. The line was long, but the employees were great. They were informative and very helpful, but the food quality was fair at best. We both ordered cheeseburgers and split the cheese fries. The food was served quickly and it was hot, but it was just blah. The burger had no flavor. The bun was not toasted and also flavorless. Neither one of us finished our burger because it was that unimpressive. The fries were a bit better, but I would much rather have In n Out or Five Guys. Probably will not return as the food quality was lacking."}
{"text":"Wherever I go if there is a Shake Shack, you will don me there eventually. The Las Vegas location at the New York New York casino did not disappoint. I finally got to taste the Chicken Shack sandwich and IT IS GREAT... the best fried chicken sandwich I have run across thus far, and I am from the south. it's even better than chic-fil-a. since I don't eat at chic-fil-a because they are a bigoted homophobic intolerant establishment I am happy to have the chicken shack.  I will be so happy when there is a North Carolina location"}
{"text":"I'm not a Koolaid-drinking, cult follower but that doesn't mean I won't show up for a worship service now and then. 

I'm not going to hate on Shack but it was definitely somewhere below the hype that builds up its rep. At the Downtown Summerlin location the ambiance is awesome. We are talking about a burger joint where you order and sit down, but it definitely has a clean feel and trendy look. 

The burgers were good. Nice portion too, staying away from an oversized portion. Ingredients were fresh from the bun to the tomatoes. Fries were crinkled and crunchy. (None of that soft, high school cafeteria, baked and flaccid fry.) Ketchup was good and they gave me a side of awesome sliced pickles without charging me and with a smile, no less. 

The difference between church-goer and cult follower comes down to a few things for me. We tried the shake and the custard. Not bad, but not great. We've had better, smoother custard and places like Freddy's. And the shake was just ok too. Not bad, but probably won't be a crave-inducing shake. The burgers are good. But they are in the Smashburger category. Similar buns, similar patty and similar ingredients.

I'd recommend the place and have no reason to steer people away. Just putting this place somewhere below the hype."}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich was great, the piece of chicken was large, with lots of juice and tenderness! Also, the regular burger was fantastic. Even the fries were good, just needed some more salt  overall, great food and great experience."}
{"text":"Great experience! Got invited to a sneak peak- The food was tasty, the team was very welcoming and energetic. A must go to place when in the Scottsdale area. Thanks to the team for a great experience. Check them out for their grand opening on Thursday 9/15."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that the one star is for the strawberry mint lemonade. We decided to stop here to grab dinner and head home last night. Dinner for 3 people was $42. Did I mention one of the people is only 5 years old? Mind you my family can do much worse, but this was not money well spent. I'd rather eat at McDonalds. Our burgers were bland and raw in the middle. I tried to doctor it once I got home but it was truly a lost cause. I wish I had tasted the food before leaving. Such a disappointment considering all of the hype."}
{"text":"Chocolate shakes taste like cheap Hershey's dark chocolate. $5.86 for a kids size shake. Not worth it at all..."}
{"text":"I had eaten at a shake shak in DC a month prior to our trip to Vegas and LOVED THEIR CONCRETES.  They reminded me of the awesome frozen custard I had growing up in St. Louis  we shared a belgian waffle and dark chocolate chunk one.  The line on the strip was long, but moved quickly.  The decor and vibe in the shake shak was comfy and welcoming to everyone (families with kids, recent college grads, older folks).  We had the portabella mushroom burger and it was amazing for a \"fast food\" place.  With shake shake showing up on the scene places like mcdonalds will only be hurting more."}
{"text":"Came here on a late in the evening.  I got myself the shack burger. The cashier thought it was funny I insist on having Dr. Pepper. Overall, the burger reminds me of a more dressed version of one of those white castle burgers. One minor thing is the amount of dirty tables. Why can't people clean up after themselves. No stars deducted for that."}
{"text":"Good food, but too expensive for what you get and everything is a la carte. Service was a little slow as well. Ordered a cheeseburger, the Smoke Shack and some crinkle fries. All good (but small) and made fresh to order. However, nothing set this experience or food apart from other burger chain competitors. You could get an equally good if not better burger for less elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our first night in town. Long line that moved like a well oiled machine. Efficient queue. The burgers are on the small side, but fresh. The shakes are to die for. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! And for being on the Vegas strip, very reasonably priced. I'm vegetarian so I had their fried mushroom burger (2 actually cause they were so gosh darn good!) And my family had the shack burgers and chicken dogs (2 each because from what they said they were the best ever!) And We shared a cheese fry. I don't know what was in the cheese but it was so good writing this is making me want some more. On top of good prices and awesome food they had good, fast and friendly service. Even when my daughter spilled her drink they were nice. We will probably go back to Vegas specifically for this place."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this NY based burger joint that I've had to try it. It's way better than FATBURGER in terms of taste and cost. I ordered the double smoke shack with black and white shake. With all the burger joints in Cali, shake shack is pretty good and hope they expand to West Coast. The shake sauce has some kick."}
{"text":"I sure wish we had these in Southern California...the best crinkle fries, crispest chicken sandwiches, amazing Chicago hot dogs, oh yeah the burgers are awesome hamburgers."}
{"text":"If I could I'd give them a 3.5 star, because service and the food was decent but I think I prefer the original shake shack in New York more :("}
{"text":"Once again, I'm not disappointed with the Shake Shack and couldn't be more happy that it's on the west coast.  I was very skeptical that it wouldn't be as good as it is in NYC but I was pleasantly surprised.  
Got the smoke shack and fries.  The smoke shack had just a hint of spice from the cherry pepper relish and the fries were light and crispy, delicious!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack burger was a great Sunday lunch choice. Even though we came late afternoon (around 3-4pm) but the line is still out the door (as expected ;) )

The line moved quickly though, boyfriend ordered a Double Smoke shack (Double patties, smoked Bacon, ans roasted peppers , would be nice if they put lettuce & tomatoes)and I got the single Shackburger (would love some pickles on mine but didn't see the option) and we got 2 orders of fries. (Its crinkle cut fries and IT is AMAZing!!!!)

Coming from Bayarea we have In & Out burger to compare to. But have to say Shake shack is right up there with In & Out! Would definitely come back when in Vegas !"}
{"text":"Honestly, cot damn. 

These burgers are to die for. That might be an over-exaggeration, but good god these burgers are delectable AF. There's something about how the meat is grilled and shaped that is so perfect, like homemade cooking. The buns are unbelievably soft and if I could have a mattress full of dem bunz then I would sleep on it. And the cheese is so yellow and enticing. 

I'm gonna stop drooling about the shake burger cause I also had the chick'n shack! It's not a bad sandwich actually! The chicken is really crispy and not overwhelmingly fried or anything. It's complimented with fresh shredded lettuce and pickles. 

If everyday were cheat day I would eat shack shake burgers all day."}
{"text":"Tim ordered the Shack Stack, a cheeseburger with a portable lo mushroom on it, and I ordered a double Smoke Shack, a double cheeseburger with smoked bacon on it. We both ordered cheese fries and a large soda. The price tag came out to $36.45. This is a bit pricey for Burger and Fries so our expectations were real high.

The place was pretty busy with a mixed crowd of families and couples/single diners. The staff was cheerful as well as helpful right when we waked in.  The food arrived relatively quickly, although if you asked Tim it took forever.

The food quantity was a bit small for what they charge (look at the image of my food). The fries were just crinkle cut fries with a cheese sauce on them. I wouldn't say it is worth the $3.o9 they charge

The redeeming factor is the flavor. The burgers were delicious and moist..not dried out. The fries were kind of boring."}
{"text":"They are not only famous for great burgers, shakes and fries. They are also known for great service. Last Tuesday night, the line to get to the counter was moving very slowly which we thought was unusual- then the manager came out to let us know that they've run out of beef and the delivery truck got stuck in the traffic and will arrive soon. While in line, the staff came out with samples and kept apologizing for the wait. When we finally reached the counter, after ordering 5 single burgers, 2 doubles, 2 chicken sandwiches, 7 fries and 2 shakes, the young cashier told us that we don't need to pay and the $107+ check is on them. It took awhile before we were able to process what she said, then we said \"thank you!\" She replied \"thank you for patiently waiting.\"  ..... Thank you Shake Shack for our free dinner! It was all worth the wait! As always, the food was great!"}
{"text":"Great décor, fresh food but pricey for what you get.  The shakes were tasty but small and expensive for what you get.  Burger was also tasty but again small and pricey.  Everything a la carte so your bill will grow as well.  For my money, would rather go to ZinBurger or DeLux for a quality burger and fries that is larger and more satisfying for the same prices."}
{"text":"Tash was our cashier and she was so friendly!!! Very professional and helpful!!! Definitely coming back. Food is amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a delicious experience! Came here the 1st weekend in May with my husband and two others. We all shared a bit of everything since we were Shake Shack virgins. Here is what our order consisted of:  2 red wines, 1 beer Shack Meister Ale, 1 Single Shack Burger, 1 Single Shack Stack, 2 Single Smoke Shack, 1 Chick 'n Shack, 1 Shack-Cago Dog, 1 Cheese fries, 1 Coffee Shake, 2 Single Concretes: peanut butter sauce and the other strawberry puree. ALL was delicious. For me, I LOVED the Shack Burger, simple standard burger but the taste and flavor was a punch in the face. So delicious!!! From that moment on, anything else I tried was just, meh. The Chick 'n Shack was a little too rich and heavy for me. I probably wouldn't order the Shack-Cago Dog again because too many flavors were mixed together. The Cheese Fries a definite 2 orders next time. My husband really enjoyed the Smoke Shack, because he liked the spiciness. Wouldn't get the shakes but the concretes are a new texture I haven't experienced. Thicker and almost gummier in texture but all delicious! All in all a great meal! With full bellies, we headed back to the hotel pool and laid there like beached whales. Seriously, there must be crack in their food because I am still craving that Shack Burger!"}
{"text":"Most definitely a solid burger. A little small but the flavor is great. Especially with the fried mushroom in the Shack Stack Burger. I love the fact that they use the crinkle fries & their cheese fries were pretty good. I also like that they have a decent amount of dessert options. We got the Shark Attack concrete that was chocolatey goodness in a cup (if you're a big chocolate fan GET THIS)! All in all pretty tasty but a bit on the pricey side for burgers and fries which is the reason for the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Crinkle bacon fries are yummy. Got the Smokestack burger - the bacon wasn't cooked enough so when I took that off, the burger was good. Some of the tables are so close together that it's hard to get in and out of the table. Amd the accoustics suck. Between the music and the crowd, its kinda loud. Mostly a good experience but definitely room to approve."}
{"text":"Phenomonal. Great variety. The Burgers have layers of flavor, fries are crispy, fluffy and perfectly seasoned (cheese sauce on the side is a must), shake quakes are \"outta this world\" yummy! 

My friend and I each had the classic cheeseburger and it was so good. The burgers are smaller in size compared to most restaurant burgers  (bigger than sliders though) which was perfect for me but I know my husband would want two. 
We also shared the chicken sandwich and it was crispy and juicy, similar to chik fila but turned up a few notches on flavor and quality. The vanilla custard was simple, utterly creamy and perfect.

Last note, the team at shake shake represents the brand well. They were friendly and were world class in serving us and other diners."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best burgers I've had! 
I was visiting Vegas with my boyfriend and we were looking for a quick bite to eat. This was our first time here. We walked inside to see these huge menus in front of us and decided on what we were going to get. We got a single shackburger, a single smokeshack, a side of fries, and a jackpot concrete. 

The burgers are offered in two different ways: single or double, meaning single or double patties. Not sure if it applied with cheese too, but I assume so.

The shackburger had lettuce, tomato, and their shacksauce. It was a light burger; tasted like a real good cheeseburger though. 

The smokeshack burger had bacon and cherry peppers on it, which added nice smokiness and slight heat. The burger was well balanced and had tons of flavor.

The fries were crinkle cut, non-greasy, and crisp. 
They also have cheese fries, which I'll have to try. 

The jackpot concrete was a rich, frozen vanilla custard mixed with strawberry sauce, sprinkles, and waffle bits. It was creamy, sweet, and delicious. 

Overall, what really stood out to me were their egg buns and the patties. I absolutely love egg breads so egg buns on my burger was a huge plus. It provided a bit chewier texture than regular burger buns. The patty was cooked a beautiful medium-well, with a crisp exterior. The patty was most likely pressed down so the outside could sear to add more texture and flavor. 

I wish there was one in Colorado because I would be eating this every day!"}
{"text":"I've heard mixed reviews from everyone, so I didn't come in with high expectations. I was only going to get a shake, but the burgers smelled so good that I couldn't resist! I had the roadside burger- it was delicious! My son ordered the fries and plain hotdog. They were both fine. We both ordered shakes- he got a chocolate and I got a strawberry shake. I didn't think it was anything special. They tasted good, but nothing I would crave. I am going to come back and try one of the concretes and the smoke stack burger that everyone is talking about!

UPDATE: I came back with my family and everything ordered was spot on. My husband loved this place and was craving it after we left."}
{"text":"always wanted to try this place and decided it to try it when i went to Las Vegas last weekend. I will definitely be back the next time i go"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago I walked by Shake Shack, there was a line to get inside of at least 40-50 people.  I wondered to myself  \"what's the big deal about this place?\"  Now, having tried it for myself, I still am wondering \"what's the big deal about this place?\"

First of all, everything on the menu is a-la-carte, there are no combo meals.  I had the standard ShackBurger ($5.19), Fries ($2.95) and an Iced Tea ($2.75), total cost w/tax: $11.77.  Pricey for a burger & fries, but it is a strip eatery, so you figure the prices are a bit inflated.

I've noticed that people compare this place to In-n-Out Burger quite a bit.  Well, the burgers are cooked when the order is placed, and they do come wrapped in paper like In-n-Out, but that's where the similarity ends.  My burger was pretty ho-hum, nothing to rave about.  The fries were good, crinkle-cut style, and nice & hot. I did not try one of their shakes, however there was nothing about the food that I did have that would make me come back again.

For a similar price, I'd rather go to Fuddruckers for a burger, it's much bigger and better.  And as far as a comparison to In-n-Out, there is none.  In-n-Out rules!"}
{"text":"My friend &I were craving a burger &decided to head to shake shack bc we wanted ice cream or shake afterwards as well. 
The shack burger was amazing. 
Omg we havent had a burger that good in a really long time! We wanna go back already. 
We also got the cheese fries. Typically, restaurants would just load cheese or other toppings only on top of the fries. 
Shake shack knows how to do it... Layered fries &cheese! 
This place was great &atmosphere was great
Definitely worth our 25 bucks"}
{"text":"We had to go after all the hype!!! and the haters that would say this place is better than In N Out. OK here it is. When I ordered they advised me they didn't have grilled onions or ranch dressing, already started off in a bad way. The burger was on the small side but had great flavor. The bread was really good. I can see how east coast folk can love this place. However in n out is better, by allot. Where they won me over is the fries. The cheese fries were fantastic. The kids got shakes ( because we are healthy that way) and the shakes were good. Final verdict if your near a shake shack try it out it is worth it. If I walked into a food court and I had to pick a burger place.....1. The habit 2. In n out 3. Shake shack. I may go get cheese fries from shake shack then go enjoy a good burger. Let me know what you think when you go!!!!!  I forgot to mention which is kinda important is that I think it was overpriced. We paid 65 bucks for three burgers one chicken Sandwich four fries, two shakes, and one drink. Yelp needs to add a few more of these $$$$ for a burger........In n out here I come"}
{"text":"Small sized portions compared to a lot of food served along the strip. 

I can't complain too much because we had really good service after they had to change out the keg for the beer we ordered. They made sure we knew what the hold up was and gave us a beer to enjoy while waiting for the one they had to change out. The server personally delivered to our table even though people are suppose to pick up their order from the counter themselves. 

Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"Small burger, no real flavor - very bland. Fries were good while hot, as someone said, they don't have that greasy feeling. 50/50 - too much lemonade, no tea flavor/color at all - induced heartburn.

Won't go again, wished I hadn't - $12.50 - overpriced.

Smash Burger and Five Guys make much better burgers."}
{"text":"I have to say that I am completely confused by all of the 4 and 5 star reviews of this place. The burgers are SUPER small and the meat doesn't have a great flavor. Nothing special at all. The crinkle cut fries aren't seasoned and the milkshake I had rivaled the strawberry milkshake I've had from Jack in the box. The comparisons to In N Out are the most confusing to me. In N Out burgers are much bigger and the meat is flavorful. I usually don't write food reviews but after eating here and then checking yelp I was like huh????? There are other much better burger places in LV."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 burgers, 2 fries, and 2 small drinks and it came out to almost $25.  The burgers were small for the price and although they tasted pretty good, I didn't think they were worth the price.  I rather spend half that and still get a satisfying burger at In n Out...."}
{"text":"Awesome burger. Good shake. Crispy fries. Just a little bit pricey. Came to about $36 with 2 burgers shake brew and just splitting on fries. But what do you expect for Las Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"Super overpriced! Small portions and my fries where kinda soggy and unappetizing. I would not go there again"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a gluten free mushroom burger as I have an allergy to gluten. My boyfriend purchased our meals without issues, then either the manager or a cook came out and told my boyfriend that the mushroom was coated with bread crumbs: the associate didn't inform my boyfriend of this.
My boyfriend requested to cancel the order with a refund to which the staff (who was visible based on the layout of the restaurant) mocked my boyfriend, laughed at him and rolled their eyes.
No one apologized even as my boyfriend mentioned he could clearly see the disrespect of the staff."}
{"text":"Tried this in NYC the first time, and was super happy to see it in LV. Ordered the same stuff, and was just as delicious.

If you're vegetarian, you must try the mushroom burger. Ugh. Get more than one. They're amazing.

Oh, and those crispy fries. Yes please.

Don't forget the custard. It's totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"HOLY CRAP! So, we're sitting at Shake Shack, finishing dinner and Maurizio comes over and takes our trays. We talk to him about how we've been to the ones in NY, CT and Mass, and now about how we drove out to Vegas to have dinner here. He says \"hang on\" then comes back with 3 t-shirts and custard, compliments of the manager! That was really awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"So glad I'm using my first Yelp review for this:

Food:
Over priced 
Bland
Most of the fries were too hard to bite through. Stale. 
The cheese tasted like processed nacho cheese. 
The shake was bland, I didn't even think that was possible. How do you make ice cream not taste good?

The only positive was that the patty serving was bigger than most, but it was a waste because it had no flavor. 

The worst part is that it upset my stomach that evening and it gave my friend food poisoning. She couldn't even get out of bed the next day, except to use the restroom. It ruined the actual good meal that she was going to have the next day at Strip Steak. Shake Shack should ask them how to cook a meal. 

Nobody else in our party liked the food much either. Similar complaints of substandard food and a ridiculous cost. 

Never again. I'll stick with In-N-Out in the future. They know how to make an amazing burger every single time. My wife and I had In-N-Out the next 2 days so we could get the disappointment of Shake Shake out of our minds."}
{"text":"Super bummed about the Uptown Plaza Shake Shack I've had their burgers all over NYC, in Vegas and in Scottsdale and have marveled at the consistency. Sadly the one 2 miles from our home missed the mark. Squished, dry, burgers and beer only to arrive well after our meals. Hopefully in time they'll work it out. Until then Scottsdale Fashion will have to be our go to."}
{"text":"I got a cheeseburger and fries but skipped on the shack sauce. 

The burger was good and was made better by the fresh, flavorful toppings. I added a little ketchup and mustard and after the first bite I regretted covering the other flavors, it didn't need the condiments.  The best thing about the burger was the bun hinge, the top and bottom buns are connected keeping the toppings in place.

The crinkle cut fries were cooked perfectly, crispy outside and soft inside. 

The drinks run small."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and order the Shack Stack. Please. Yes, it's $10, but it's absolutely worth it. Probably my favorite burger of all time.

There's also hot dogs, custards, milkshakes, and plenty of other burgers out there for you to choose.

I've tried their chocolate, strawberry, and peanut butter milkshakes, and they were all very good. Fries were fine, nothing too special.

Seriously though, order the Shack Stack."}
{"text":"Great location on the strip, and mostly great food.   I loved the SmokeShack burger.   Cheese fries were good but nothing special.   My coffee shake had awesome flavor, but wasn't thick enough.   I'd definitely go back for the burgers."}
{"text":"Food was good but nothing spectacular. Being a California resident we are privileged to have good  burgers. This was good but didn't live up to the hype. Had a strawberry shake and it wasn't anything I would go back to get. May be the build up my friends gave me about it but wouldn't be my top burger option."}
{"text":"Yummy ! Had the chicken sandwich was crispy and  fresh salad cucumber and I believe it tartar sauce very very good crispy and fresh french fries are yummy and crinkly and then had to shake ohh very good mud pie !  definitely go again food was delicious great prices"}
{"text":"Out of the 5 ppl in my party, 4 liked In N Out better.  I'm neutral.  I thought my plain burger, cheese fries and caramel shake were good.  I prefer In N Outs fries bc they're less processed.  I'd go back... My friends prob wont come w me though."}
{"text":"Went here 2 times in 24 hours... It's that's good! The bacon burger is exceptional, especially without The cheese... I still want to try a shake...  Can't wait to visit in la!"}
{"text":"Definitely a little over-hyped in my opinion. I got their regular cheese burger and I thought it was a little soggy, not really worth the price. But their fries were indeed really crispy and as a lot of my friends said, \"potato-ey\", better than in-n-out's fries but I would still get an in-n-out burger over shake shack's any day."}
{"text":"It was good food, BUT..overpriced and 3 out of 4 people i was with got food poisoning. Mine started on a plane, yay.

NOPE!!!!"}
{"text":"ok so i went there with my boyfriend, his treat :) and the food was great, best cheeseburger  I've had in a while (even though i ordered a hamburger and they messed up my order). the place inside is so loud that we could barely hear each other when we were talking. also after an hour or so the burgers destroyed our stomachs(?) .... it was so bad that we spent almost all night burping and he was farting like I've never seen (or smelled ) before.... so i give it 4 because the food doesn't taste bad at all, but we had our share of problems hehe"}
{"text":"Overpriced with long lines. The burgers are long the same lines of Habit Burger, 5 guys etc, but a lot more expensive. I guess a chain from New York has to have New York prices! They even keep the fountain drinks behind the counter so you can't get refills. That could be another reason why the service is so slow. Bottom line: the burgers are not worth the price."}
{"text":"Great food and service was excellent. Highly recommend this burger place! !!!!

The fries were amazing"}
{"text":"It's no In-n-Out but it's good. You have to know exactly what you want where you order because the menu is located before the registers and if you don't remember you'll have to go back to look. The shake shack sauce is buttermilk mayo and it was too sweet. The burger itself was good and the fries were crispy and delicious. I'll stick to my west coast burgers."}
{"text":"Believe the hype!  As good as In-N-Out, but with the best concretes in town.  Service is also excellent.

I would like to add that getting a double meat ruins the balance, so stick with a single."}
{"text":"Opening weekend, oh my! 

It was my first time here. Although for some reason I was not fully satisfied, it was pleasing. I wish I could say what it is that didnt satisfy me, but I dont know myself. Maybe I've become such a big fan of In N Out that I'm comparing the two too much. I'd definitely come back though. Nothing wrong with the food at all. I do want to point out, if I remember correctly, the hot dog is so teeeny!! Anyway, I love how they have beepers!! You dont see that very often here in the US... well, at least i havent. Location is great, restaurant looked great. Staff too were wonderful"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Food was good, consistent with their Manhattan location.  Visited on a Wednesday night around 9 pm and waited in line for about 20 minutes.  Ordered the Roadside Burger, Shroom Burger, hot dog and fries.  There was a separate (and shorter) line for desserts and beverages outside.  Walked around the strip, then returned for frozen custard."}
{"text":"Great new addition to the NY NY scene, expensive for a burger, about right for the Strip"}
{"text":"I was fortunate to attend the soft opening of this location. Thank you shake shack staff!  Being from the Bay Area, this was my first meal at this chain and I'll definitely be back.  Great burger and the fries were crispy yet tender in the inside.  My wife had the chicken sandwich which was also outstanding.  We split a peppermint shake that was delicious and a great dessert to finish the meal.  Staff was very helpful and friendly and they are off to a great start.  The only improvement I could see was that the bun was little soggy and the lettuce was not crisp.  Other than that terrific meal and next time I want to try their frozen custard, another favorite of mine."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. Cool, modern decorated atmosphere but simply a decent burger. Good that they serve beer.  Brugers are kind of small. Great variety of shakes."}
{"text":"It's 8 pm and i ordered a peanut butter toffee crunch. It took 15 minutes to get it. There were 4 customers  in the whole store and 10 employees. 
How long does it take to make a shake?! 
Come on people."}
{"text":"Stupid long lines and a bit confusing menu. The place is full of really loud teenagers and the sitting room is limited. Nothing special about this place. Overrated. Manager however was super nice. But hey..that is just my opinion!"}
{"text":"Burgers - above average but small
Hot dogs - average
Fries - average
Price - overpriced
Atmosphere - average, tables a bit cramped
Utensils - plastics knives are almost too flimsy to cut the hot dog for my little girl (never thought I'd review plastic knives!)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Everyone in the party thought the music was too loud, even on the patio. The food was just okay.  However, for the price, the food should have been better. Also, they messed up the order (prob b/c they couldn't hear the order over the music) and they didnt mark which burger or shake was which so we all had to guess. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The hype for this place is too real. All I can say is Meh! Service is fast, food is aight, the price is my only complaint. About ten dollars for fries and burger! Mind you.. The burger is tiny! I call it a snack burger. The only one up this place has on in n out is the decor and the meat patty.. I guess you pay for how nicely decorated the place is... But this place is nothing to be wowed about! I'm still an in n out burger kinda gal. I am kind of sad they didn't carry strawberry lemonade like their Vegas location. Other than that, this place is alright/meh."}
{"text":"Five stars as always!!!!!

Shake Shack has always had spot in me and my wife's heart. I've been living in NYC for 6 years and never a single time was disappointed with the burger. Now I live in SF and missed Shake Shack so much until we arrived in Vegas and wanted to eat the burger as soon as we step our feet to the ground of Sin City.

This place is very fancy though. Much more fancier than any location in NYC. Service was quick and easy. On top of that the employees are super friendly! Big plus on that.. They took our tray as soon as we finished (with ).

Food is great! Taste just like the one in NY.

Fiva La Shack!!"}
{"text":"Day 1: burger was cooked great, it was delicious and very flavorful. 

Day 2: needed to have the burger again before our departure, got home, had food poisoning :) 

Needless to say, I probably won't be having shake shack again. It's upsetting because the burgers are delicious but the lack of consistency will keep me from trying it again.

Sad day."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers, yummy shakes, fast and polite service. Definitely recommend getting the \"double\" for any of the burgers, the individual patties are pretty skinny on their own."}
{"text":"The Shake Shack is where it's at! And the Shack Stack burger is what you want to get. It's their cheeseburger that also comes with a fried portobello mushroom patty, and it's is oh soo yum! I also appreciate the fact their fries are crinkle-cut, cuz that's muh fave. Their shakes are all really good and they have some specials on weekly rotation. Def one of the burger joints you've got to try at least once! Can't wait for them to come to LA (WeHo district)."}
{"text":"I had the SmokeShack burger, it was awesome!

My son had a Cheeseburger with bacon, and loved it!

Frozen custard was great too!

Shakes were just so so! 

My son said he wished they had one in Orange County, CA"}
{"text":"Before I start my review I need to get something off my chest. People compare every damn burger joint to In-N-Out and it's a bunch of crap! Stop! I am an In-N-Out fiend and probably have it four to five times a month, but comparing a place like Shake Shack to In-N-Out is not a fair comparison because they're two different style restaurants. If you want a closer comparison, compare it to Five Guys. 

I stopped by here in my way back to Calofornia from Zion National Park. You can see it while driving down the strip. The line was out is the door but seeing as there are no locations around Southern California that I'm aware of, I figured this might be my only chance to try Shake Shack for a while, as I didn't know when the next time I'd be in Vegas would be. 

The line was long but it moved pretty quick. Their menu was very comprehensive and they serve all sorts of great food and drink items. They even offer dog biscuits. When I got to the front of the line, the cashier was very friendly. 

My food came shortly after. Presentation was very nice. I ordered a Shack Burger and a creamsicle float.

The bun on my burger was spongy and delicious. The meat had GREAT texture and flavor. Cheese was gooey. The burger was fantastic. 

The float was equally good. Perfect for the hot weather. The fries that I tried were really crispy and well executed. 

What I didn't like were the prices. Even though they have a huge selection, serve beer and wine, etc., the prices are too high in my opinion. Just my two things cost over $11. If I had ordered my own fries it would have been around $15 if I can recall. If you order a beer or wine, your bill could very easily top $20. I thought it was the Vegas treatment but I've been told that that's how it is at all Shake Shacks.

So the food is excellent but the prices are high. I would definitely come back and eat here again, just sparingly. Luckily I don't go to Vegas that often."}
{"text":"Very disappointed - been to Shake Shack on numerous occasions on the east coast...but this one was awful! Employees were nice, restaurant was clean - but food was terrible and nothing like my previous experiences at other locations."}
{"text":"Incredibly overrated. So many people compare this place to In-N-Out Burger, but the Shake Shack's small squishy burgers remind me more of something from Rally's. Don't get me wrong. Sometimes a coupla small squishy burgers hits the late night fast food-hangover cure jonesin' spot. So if that's what you're craving, head to Rally's. At least your wallet will thank you."}
{"text":"This place is not bad, it's not cheap either. I had the shackburger little messy at the end, bun fell apart little greasy but not bad. Fries are good little more salt would be helpful. Big problem I have is there is nothing to eat your food on, no plates of any kind. Had to eat my $10 burger on a napkin, not cool."}
{"text":"I just love the food, and that's almost the sole reason I'm giving this place 5 stars. Other than that, I also love the look and feel of the table tops made from reclaimed bowling alleys. The restrooms are nice and clean with nice tiles, non-auto faucet, and Dyson hand dryer. The employees are great, the manager stopped by my table to hand me some napkins. They have buzzers to let you know when your's is ready. The only downside is the price for the portion that you get."}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack - I always go when I'm in NYC but I was so happy to find one in Vegas! It's always crazy busy in there but it moves pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Don't see why this place gets compared to in & out so often. Two different types of burgers...essentially distinctive. 

Sigh...for the sake of the game. I'll vote. For in&out. I live in both New York and LA. Know the two worlds. So I'd say my vote is unbiased.  

Fries? Nothing special.  Go to Costco, get a small fryer, get some pre-made nacho cheese from your local grocery market,  and you get these high school looking fries. 

Would I try it if I was strictly from the west? Yes. Just to see what this burger is so priced. 

Come back? Maybe when there really isn't anything else in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good food but overpriced. I agree with others that in out burger is a much better value and food that is just as good."}
{"text":"Awesome burger joint! My brother told me about this place and when we visited him, this is where we had dinner that night! The burgers, fries, hot dogs and service were great! Will definitely be back there when I go to Vegas again!"}
{"text":"The beer in the beer float is super dark. Not my cup of beer!

The stack shake is delicious and juicy. 

Cheese fries are good as well. 

Concrete all shook up is not bad. It's creamy.

Ice tea is good. Tastes like lipton.

Tip: you can order your the frozen custard ahead of time and put it on hold or order it from the cline  outside"}
{"text":"Still one of the better chain burgers around if you have a chance you won't be disappointed. Line moves real fast and the food is really quick. And the service here in Vegas is top notch and friendly"}
{"text":"We ordered to go and they left out a few of our orders. They owned up to their mistake and to make up for it, they credited money and gave additional meals for our next visit. Great food :)"}
{"text":"First time trying to shake shack celebrate a friend's birthday here the food looks awesome and the views are even better"}
{"text":"Must stop burger place in Vegas. The angus beef & cheese fries really is in close comparison to in & out"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food but I was a bit disappointed with my shake."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite stops in Vegas. We went around dinner time and didn't have to wait long at all. Burgers were great, fries were crisp, and the black and white shake finished everything off nicely!"}
{"text":"I 100% welcome its first store on the west coast and nothing beats an ice cold milk shake in a hot Vegas summer day. I ordered the special caramel pretzel shake. The shake is quite dense, but I really cannot taste the pretzel at all. I will be sure to try their burgers, fries and hot dogs next time :)"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy!  My son and I ordered the burgers, two lemonades, french fries, and a chocolate custard.  Everything was so delicious.  The burger came out super fresh, moist, and tasty. The sauce in the burger added the extra touch. The lemonade tasted so refreshing (you get free refills) and the french fries was cooked just right. Not too soft and not too crunchy. Sooo good.  I decided to try the chocolate custard and it hit the spot. (They offer a free taste sample of the custard if you want to taste it first before you purchase)  

Overall the experience was great. The customer service was on point. After we finished someone even came up to us and asked if she can clear our table. She was very nice. The staff from the beginning by taking our order, receiving the order, and when we left were all so friendly. We will be coming back here again.  I give this burger joint 5 happy stars!"}
{"text":"In town for two days and went here twice. Burgers are great and service was awesome. Well be back next trip for sure. May hit it up tomorrow too."}
{"text":"I have been super excited to have shake shack come to arizona especially in central Phoenix . The shake shack cheeseburger is tasty And the fries are delicious . I had the salted Carmel malt which was divine"}
{"text":"Terrible food.  Small portions. Expensive for portion size.  Good service, but can't make up for a basic burger and chicken sandwich.   Chicken sandwich was no bigger than 4 chicken McNuggets!!!!!!   Fries were good and that's how they fill you up!!!!"}
{"text":"You definitely can't go wrong with any burger selection! My party of six ordered the shack stack in our liking and the smoke shack burger... it was fast despite the long waiting line. Service was really good as we were out of state and had a lot of questions, the nice cashier was patient with us in explaining what was in the shack stack burger and the smroom burger. 

It's like In & Out Burger from the East Coast! Wish I can have one in front of me now... oh by the way, the strawberry shake was delicious! Can't go wrong in this Vegas heat"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers, great fries, quick and simple place to get a burger. Very good service, the decor is cool and location is good, right outside of New York New York hotel."}
{"text":"Loved it. The burger was delicious. Great flavor. Great bun. Fresh ingredients. Only reason this meal got a four stars is because the although the fries are adequate, they weren't spectacular. All in all though, my experience was great."}
{"text":"i paid $7 for a small burger.way overpriced and over hyped."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Nothing bad, but just not impressed. Burgers were okay and the price is absurd for it just being okay. Not sure we will be back, maybe if we get hungry and are in a pinch, other than that, won't come back."}
{"text":"I went again and tried the shack stack and yay! I wanted to be blown away by this place and I was! When I first visited this spot, I got the shack burger (I think that's what it's called?) and it's very simple, basic - not for those looking for adventure. The shack stack was different, very tasty, cooked the way I like it, and a good size given there are two patties (one meat, one mushroom). I am glad I gave this place another go. I am very happy they're opening up a location in West Hollywood! Yay!"}
{"text":"This place has a very nice ambiance and the service is nice and quick. I came here a few weeks ago with my family and they messed up our order. We were understanding since it was crazy packed in there. The table behind us had their orders messed up as well. 

Overall, the burgers are solid, however, the patty could use some seasoning. I've been here twice and the first time I got a regular shack burger and the second time I got a shack stack. Both times, I felt the burger lacked flavor. If the buns were to tasted, it would add a bit of texture to it. Other than that, the burger was nice and juicy."}
{"text":"This was a great late night stop after we had been out for a bit. This location stays open late on Saturday nights. Bonus points for letting me taste test the cheese sauce and having a GF bun. They only reason they didn't get five stars was my bacon cheese fries had barley any bacon. The food was great and I'd say they have lived up to all the hype!"}
{"text":"I don't see what the hype is about this place. The burgers were okay, nothing really special. The custard wasn't that good at all, I did like the fries and that's why I'm giving a three star."}
{"text":"Price, taste, fast service. This is a 5 star place. Shakes amazing! Burgers are delicious! What do you expect? You're getting a type of fast food but it's doesn't feel or taste like it! Try it! It's cheap and great late night food that you can't resist if you're drinking. Might not feel that great in the morning though.."}
{"text":"Unforgettable experience - salty fries and burger to saggy. We order there supposedly famous ice cream in a big container but with no lead on it. We are family of 8 from California we feel that we mistreated. The location looks decent compares to other burger chain but may be becouse its new \"Hope will be Maintained \""}
{"text":"I work out in Summerlin about once a month, and this is my go-to lunch spot.

My 5 stars go to the burgers and fries because they are some of the best I've had anywhere. The one time I had a shake here, it was grainy and pretty bad...but I'm not the person who named it shake shack instead of burger shack.

So anyway, if you like a casual meaty burger w/ crispy crinkle cut fries this is a great spot."}
{"text":"shake shack was disappointing. i always see pictures and good reviews on this place and finally decided to try it out. all i can say is i was cat fished. this place looks so good online and on all the pictures but in person is nothing to rave about. i admit the ambiance is very nice and hip but it's all hyped. the cheese fries where literally fries with unmelted kraft singles placed on top. the burger was cooked and everything but the flavors did not blend nicely. the meat nicely cooked but the toppings and salt literally tasted like i stuck a straw in a vinegar bottle and drank it. and don't even get me started about the prices. i don't regret spending money bcus to not go here again. i mean maybe i'll go if i have people visiting wanting to waste money doing touristy things but other than that i really wouldn't go here. :/"}
{"text":"Shake Shack really went above and beyond with their customer service.  They had a 10 minute delay with burger patties and a line going out the door.  Instead of offering limited choices, which would have been perfectly reasonable, they asked if we would be OK waiting and then proceeded to give us samples of their ice creams, fries, and floats.  I had my kids with me and they had employees entertain and engage them while we waited.  After all that, they thanked us for waiting 10 minutes (don't you always have to wait about 10 minutes when things are busy?) And comped us our entire meal.  I haven't even tried the food as we wait for it to arrive but I can honestly say this is better service than I've seen even at high end restaurants.  Seeing the long line made me worry about bringing the kids.  Anytime we are in town, we will come back to the Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Slightly overpriced for the burger size and fry portions. Nice setting patio/interior."}
{"text":"Finally!!! Shake Shack on the west coast!  Burgers and Shakes were as delicious as I remember from our last trip to the big apple!"}
{"text":"Have to say I was pretty disappointed. All I kept hearing was about how this place was going to give In-N-Out a run for their money. Sorry, but that's NOT going to happen. Nice and helpful staff. Food was WAY overpriced!!!! When I saw the price I figured they charged that much because I would be blown away. And when I saw my food, you better believe I was blown away... at how disappointed I was. I'm all for quality over quantity, but the quality did not overcome the price they charged. I ordered the SmokeShake burger, which they offer a single or double. They should offer a triple patty for the price of a single patty to justify the price. I also had the strawberry shake, which again for $7.50, I was expected to be blown away, like John Travolta in Pulp Fiction blown away (he had a $10 shake in the movie). It was good, but not for $10. I will be sticking with In-N-Out thank you very much."}
{"text":"Unbelievable service for \"fast food\". The people who work here are amazing and got me a shake to go in an insulated cup so that it would not be melted when I got it home. The chicken sandwich was amazing as well. Five stars all the way."}
{"text":"Favorite fast food burger and go to for cheeseburger in the summerlin area. Fast service, dog friendly patio, amazing juicy burgers and delicious cheese fries. Good pricing as well"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! The service was amazing--several servers asked us if we needed anything like another drink--we were overall really pleased with our experience. The food, of course, was hot and fresh. I'm guessing all of these positives are a result of good management at this location. Love this place and I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"First of all, your lucky if you get in before the rush & long lines!! This place is popular , with every reason to be. Their burger is small, but very filling and the cheese fries are THE BEST!! I tried the chocolate cheesecake custard as well which was perfect and not too sweet. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, definitely my new favorite burger spot"}
{"text":"Going to give Shake Shack another try it might have been growing pains responsible for my first visit. I emailed the corporate office, they replied along with the general manager they were very kind and want the opportunity to try again which I appreciate.  My initial review was it was overrated in my opinion. Chocolate Shake was not thick it was runny even after I asked them nicely to make it thicker.  I love fresh hot french fries, but the small portion was nothing special. The burger was very good. Still there was not a lot of value the price two meals exceeded $30."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place since everyone raves about it. Did I miss the memo? It was literally OKAY. No wow factor honestly. The best part was the strawberry mint lemonade. Won't go out of my way to make another trip here."}
{"text":"Went there around 3:30pm on a Thursday afternoon and there was no line. Even though we still waited for about 20 minutes for our food to be ready, it was surprising good. We went again the next day around 5:30pm but there's a long line. Too bad we didn't have time but will definitely go again the next time when we are in town"}
{"text":"Boo, hiss, not a fan at all. In fact, I want to save you and tell you to skip it. I am offering two stars because my teenage son did like the hotdog. My burger was greasy and disgusting, the fries were way over cooked, the shake was ok. The employees seemed disinterested in anything going on. I like the decor and the location but really, it's extremely expensive and not even almost as good as In and Out Burger and I don't even really like In and Out. I know this is staple from somewhere and the people of Phoenix were happy it came to town, but I gotta say, I'm not sure how long they can last. Too many good choices in that area to eat there."}
{"text":"Very salty hot dog.  Fries good.    Skip it. Vegas has so many better options.  They do have hamburgers and shakes. I just don't think it is worth the cost. I prefer 5Guys or In N Out."}
{"text":"Die geilsten Burger auf der ganzen Welt. Auch besser als in-n-out burger. Immer wieder lecker!!"}
{"text":"While I was in vegas this last weekend, I stopped by on Saturday to see what all the hype was about but I couldn't figure it out. My fiance and cousin ordered the shack burger and I ordered the chicken burger. The chicken burger was good and the chicken was flavorful and moist but the burger was absolutely horrible. Why!? Because all it tasted like was cheese. I couldn't even taste the patty or the bread, just the cheese. My cousin could only eat half her burger because she was starting to get sick of eating it. I thought their fries were okay, nothing amazing about it. All and all this place is just over hyped."}
{"text":"Delicious double cheeseburger. The bun felt like it melted in my mouth. The cheese fries were perfect."}
{"text":"This was a waste.  Me & hubby had the shack burger and the spicy chicken sandwich and we split the fries.  The burger had an odd taste and odor to it and the chicken sandwich was reminiscent of school lunch.  The fries were old/stale.  Save your money folks because based on these reviews it's hit or miss here; it's a gamble.  Your better off grilling burgers yourself at least then you know you got your money's worth and the food won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Omg!  Delicious burger and we got the cheese fries which were tasty.  I ordered the peanut butter shake to share.  Yummy!  Great family restaurant for a family vacation in Vegas.  Kinda pricey for a small burger but very delicious."}
{"text":"For burger and fries: I think some of the reviews are overrated, for burger n fries lovers, should try The Habit. They used frozen fries..(even tho it says \"natural, no added ingredients)..hmmm...that says a lot.  We also tried the \"ShackBurger\", the meat wasn't even cooked properly..
For the shake: it's an okay shake when it's hot outside. In and out shake is truly original and classic; nothing compares.. 
Service..there was no service at all except the cashiers. He was pretty nice and patience to get our orders right. 
Would I come back again? NOpe!"}
{"text":"One of the big topics from big east are about to head over to west. With a recent successful IPO this New York based brand has never been more hyped. Some say its the Tesla of the burgers and the beginning of something huge. 

But if you look at their performance so far, they havent been able to geographically grow that fast. But who says they have to hurry?

The fact is that they now enter the sacred land of In N Out, when opening their first joint at the Vegas Strip. And its only the first of several to come, planning to open another in Los Angeles 2016.

The ppl here love In N Out, so the question is if they will abandon it for their new step brother? My predictions are not, but Shake Shack can still be a good burger joint.

When entering this venue you got two options, either a regular line or a C-line, where the C probably stands for Cold and is a faster option for shakes and stuff. The menu gives you quite a few options, and if you have never been, you will probably spend a couple of minutes observing it before deciding. I came here around 2 pm and there were no line to talk about, which i was a pleasant surprise.

Ordered a double shack burger, fries, milkshake and got a buzzer to let me know when it was ready. I really like the convenience with having a buzzer...what i dislike was to pay more than $17 bucks for this!

Burger was really good and it felt like a burger with a lot of love, fries too was over my expectations since i usually dont like the thicker ones. And venue itself was very nicely decorated and gave a clean touch to the meal.

In the end its insistently to compare the two brothers who for the first time stand side-by-side infront of their hungry crowd. But i cant see Shake Shack conquer In N Out in years, until they have wider spread of their venues. But even then, its hard to become a massive burger chain if you dont adjust the pricing. And comparing today its the double for Shake Shack.

Maybe Shake Shack never will be a serious contender and maybe they dont want to. But as a premium burger joint, they do it well, and they manage to present the whole package within that experience!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke and it literally fucken sucks. East coasters can't make a burger to save their life. They can stick too their GTL or italian food but leave the burgers to the West coasters. This place is way to hyped, and it's not even that good.

I paid 14 bucks for a single patty burger, fries that has velveeta spread on top and a coke that is \"regular\" but looks like a child's small drink. The burger was dry... smh. 

Save yourself 14 bucks because this was definitely NOT worth it."}
{"text":"Similar to In n Out, but not the same.  Similar in that the ingredients taste fresh, and different in terms of the taste of the beef patty and the overall texture and flavoring. The burger here is drier since you don't have the In n Out spread to give more moistness in every bite.  The beef patty is a bit more chewier and saltier.  When it comes to choosing favorite, it would have to come down to taste preference.   Right now for me, In n Out comes a bit ahead, but I do like the burger here and I would come back, if not for the burger, then for the strawberry custard shake.  Omg, the shake is sooooo good!  So creamy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great burger and delicious fries! First time eating here and staff was friendly, helpful and accommodating. My son has a peanut allergy and they took special care to ensure no cross contamination between his food and the shake making area. They also made sure to change gloves before making his food. 

A little pricey, but delicious!"}
{"text":"????Shake Shake ??,??????????????????????? ???????????"}
{"text":"Just hit Shake Shack twice on a recent trip to Las Vegas.  It is located on the Strip at New York-New York.  Have never eaten there before and was impressed with the quality of the food, pricing, and overall atmosphere. The first time in we missed the lunch rush so our wait was quick.  Our second trip was a different story with a line queued all the way to the door, but even then the line moved quickly to order our food.

Our group tried the ShackBurgers, hot dogs, cheese fries, chocolate shake, and the \"All Shook Up\" concrete.  All super tasty (hence the reason for 2 visits).  Wish they had more indoor seating since Vegas is an oven in the summer but they had lots of misters/fans in their outdoor eating area.  Will visit again on our next trip."}
{"text":"Hit it just right, not too crowded and got a table outside where it was safe/convenient for a 3 year old.  Burgers were up to reputation."}
{"text":"Came here on vacation and I had to try this place... I am so glad I did!!! So far the best cheeseburger have ever had in my life, not joking! The cheese fries were awesome as well"}
{"text":"I decided to stopped by Shake Shack because of the good reviews I have read online and i'm glad I did it! Everything was delicious! The meat was cooked at the perfect point and the french fries were crispy! the environment was really nice also and the service was really good. 
The price is pretty fair."}
{"text":"I wish they had one in Houston!

Had the burger with the fried mushroom and my wife at the one with just mushroom, no burger. We both liked it and would go back if they had one where we live. Probably would be my fast food option."}
{"text":"Visited shake shack in Vegas because my husband heard it was a great burger place. In our opinion it was just okay, not really anything special, especially not more special than my favorite California based burger chain ;) What we got:
1. Shack stack burger, what I liked about this was the fried mushroom, the burger was really simple and fresh tasting but the patty was kind of dry
2. Cheese fries, \"cheese sauce\" tasted like something from a can or packet, similar to nacho cheese sauce
3. Shack cago hotdog, liked it better than the burger, but the hot dog bun was really soggy and fell apart while eating
4. Concrete \"jackpot\" frozen custard, this was my favorite part of the meal, a sweet delicious combo of vanilla frozen custard, strawberry purée, marshmallow cream, waffle pieces, and rainbow sprinkles (I love sprinkles)

The service here was great and fast, and the pricing is very decent for what you get."}
{"text":"I was really happy to hear that they opened up a Shake Shack in the West Coast finally! My friends and me walked by it a couple of times to get a sense of how long the lines were and they varied every hour. Eventually we were able to get in when the crowd died down. I recently had Shake Shack in the East Coast and I expected that this one would taste about the same. I ordered the shackburger and cheese fries and they tasted nothing like the ones in the East Coast. The flavor was completely off and it was not as juicy either. The burgers and the cheese all tasted different and not as good. I'm not sure what they're doing wrong but they gotta work on it if they want to stay competitive on The Strip. I much rather eat at In-n-Out instead of this Shake Shake. It also gave my friends diarrhea just like some of the other reviewers on this page so beware."}
{"text":"My husband and I heard rave reviews about this place so we had to make a visit on a recent trip to Vegas.  We're native Southern Californians so we had to try it in order to compare it to the almighty In-N-Out which, in our humble opinion, is THE Standard against ALL burgers.  Glad to say, we were not disappointed.  I ordered the Shack Stack which was really good.  The peanut butter vanilla shake was also really enjoyable.  The ONLY downfall we could think of is the price.  We can get lunch at In-N-Out for just under $12 (two burgers, one fry, one soft drink, and one shake). Lunch here: $32 (two burgers, one regular fry, one cheese fry, one soft drink, one shake).  Is it worth the price? Most definitely not.  Will we visit again?  Probably.  Is it better than In-N-Out? Hands-down: No."}
{"text":"I really love this place! It's a must every time I visit Vegas! Burgers are fresh and tasty, cheese fries are yummy. The lemonade is to obsess over! Prices are good as well as the service. Lines are always long but move quickly. If you're a sports fan like me, the giant tv is awesome!"}
{"text":"It's OK.  I had the single shack burger with cheese fries and a vanilla shake. The burger was good but was on the salty and greasy side.  The cheese fries were ordinary and the shake tasted like a shake I can get anywhere else.  Good but nothing special.  I don't get the hype.    

The only complaint that I have was that the tables were dirty.  There wasn't anybody going around cleaning up the tables.  Also, compared to other burger joints, this place was a little pricey.  

Will I come back? Maybe, but nothing to really rave about."}
{"text":"Oh my god!!! It's still good when it's cold!! Fries and especially their burgers!!! I'm forever their customers."}
{"text":"Went here because of all the hype. Not really good. Very basic. Just a fad that will fade. 2 of our burgers were wrong. Hotdog was very small and cheese fries barely had cheese on them. Jack in The box and Carl's Jr have way better shakes than this place. Never going to go again. Waste of money."}
{"text":"First of all the food was amazing! But most importantly the staff and manager were the greatest. Very accommodating and extremely sweet and generous to all four of my kids!!!"}
{"text":"The shakes are outrageously delicious.  The burgers melt in your mouth!  There is no better view on the Strip than on this patio out front of NYNY.  The employees are super friendly and there is a great selection of beer & wine!  Yum yum"}
{"text":"Tried this place over the last two years during the last two Vegas trips I went on. This is a must try while in Vegas! Their burgers are old fashioned homemade style the kind you think about as a kid seen on TV shows. They are delicious and the crinkle cut style crispy fries are the perfect pairing, you can add cheese to them too. The other thing that makes this place stand out is the custard milk shakes. I had the chocolate shake it was thick and creamy. I heard they opened a chain up finally in Glendale that would be the closest to me. I am craving this place now just writing about it!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Great for a snack or lunch. Line can get long I'm assuming because they have a line marked off that extends to outside, but I've never waited more than 5 minutes to order. Waiting for the food you ordered will take at least another 10 mins though. The buns in my opinion are what make the burgers so tasty. Cheese fries are with a liquid nacho like sauce. I'm into it, but if you like shredded melted cheese then it may not be for you. Super easy access from Monte Carlo even though it's location is part of nyny hotel on the strip."}
{"text":"First time my sister and I went to this location, last Monday (3/21/16) we were thrilled with the food and the service. The supervisor was really friendly, cheerful and he was making sure things were running smooth, even though it was getting busy. 

We wanted to come back the next day but decided to wait til Easter Sunday, getting off work late and knew we'd be craving it!  

Last night, checked the Google hours, called the location got an automated answering message saying they were open til 10pm, it was 8:55pm. We head over. Its closed. The manager on duty came out and explained to us that they were closed for Easter early, even though the answering machine didn't indicate that. 

We were annoyed and we'll go back but FYI they close whenever they want and if your driving from across town you might want to call and actually talk to a person, because they close at random hours. 

Great burgers and shakes though!"}
{"text":"Stuffed portabella mushroom, fried and placed on a juicy cheeseburger was delicious, not too big and the shake was to die for!"}
{"text":"I was really excited for Shake Shack to open its Phoenix location, literally just a few minutes' walk from my house.  I had it when I lived in Washington, D.C. about 4 years ago and have been craving it ever since.  Honestly, this led to unfair expectations, but the food was still really good.  The burger practically melts in your mouth because of the buttery bun and good quality cheese.  I have to say that the patty itself isn't anything special.  I like the crinkle cut fries and (can't believe I'm actually saying this) but they are a little too crispy for my taste.  This may be because it's a new location and the employees haven't nailed the art of fry-making.  Also, it's awesome that they have beer and wine, including some local selections.  

My biggest gripe is that it is pricey.  People compare Shake Shack and In N Out, which is a hard comparison because they're just different.  But In N Out is clearly the better bang for your buck.  Nonetheless, I will still find myself at Shake Shack happily eating a Shack Burger and crinkle cut fries."}
{"text":"I've tried Shake N Shack in Miami, DC, and Las Vegas. It was all perfect! Love it and enjoy it!"}
{"text":"The beef just melts in your mouth. So yummy. A must try. I also love their iced tea. Very refreshing. Fast service too."}
{"text":"The food was good. Slightly upscale fast food. The staff not friendly. I felt rushed to get my order in and we only had a minute or so to check out the menu because the line behind us was so long. Would be a good idea if they posted  menus out where people line up to get in. That way we would all have a chance to review it ahead of time.  

For the same amount of money there are many better restaurants in the same area."}
{"text":"I like this place because the service is great, the food is great, and it is very clean. I got a cheeseburger with everything and fries and it was amazing. Definitely competition for In-n-Out. All though, I have to say In-n-Out has better burgers. At shake shack, the burgers don't have the extra boost of flavor that In-n-Out has. But who has better French fries? I have to say Shake Shack. They are extremely good. Especially the wavy ones. The burger is also juicy as well. I give it a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from this place. The burger wasn't great nor the drinks. Also shake shack isn't really worth the price. I'd rather go to five guys or in n out. I will never return due to not knowing how to properly serve the food and the fact that I got food poisoning. Hopefully this place will go out of business because this place is terrible!"}
{"text":"This is based on the service rather than the food.  The people here are amazing.

I wanted to use the app so I can use a promo code given by the company, but there were so many issues with the app in just placing my order, I realized it didn't even apply the code.  When I went up to the counter, I explained my situation and in showing them my order, they pointed out that I accidentally ordered it at the wrong location.  That was my own mistake in being flustered with the app.  Freaking out, I went to go cancel my order but I couldn't reach the other location.  I came back in and talked to the cashier and the manager and they said that they would reach out to the other's location manager for me.  The cashier (I think his name was Steven based on my receipt) was so nice and generous in placing the correct order and the manager was so understanding as well.  I felt so bad for causing so much trouble but the people behind the counter are so kind.  

I don't recommend the app, but this location is great for service and hospitality."}
{"text":"I'm from CA and we have in n out but I would much rather have shack shake. I will miss this burger and wish they would bring it out west.!!!!
Oh their root beer float is awesome too."}
{"text":"Burgers are on the small side, but absolutely sensational. I've been to many burger joints and this is honestly one of the top five."}
{"text":"I stay in Excalibur , food price is quite high,. The Mexican food ,burrito ,it cause me more than 10 dollar.
After I use yelp to find a good place to eat. I find shake and shack. I spend less than 10 dollar and have best burger I ever have. The burger really juicy and the meat is quite fresh.
Highl6 recommend for those can take a little bit work and find good food to eat people."}
{"text":"SmokeShack was sooooo good! The fries were delicious too. The patty was just the right size. And ofcourse, you can never go wrong with bacon"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Read all the great reviews and was craving the chili. Talked my BF into ordering from shake shack so I could try the chili. Ordered smoke shack and shakeburger and shack cargo dog , fries plus chocolate shake and the chili Wanted to try everything! Postmates delivered in a timely manner. No chili and shake sauce!  Double checked my order and receipt on bag. They did not include the chili and shake sauce. Tried calling but no one answers phone. Bad experience. Please get your orders right. Regarding the food that we got it was good but is it worth ordering from a place when they cannot get the orders right. No!"}
{"text":"Really great Smoke Shack Burger & Black & white shake... Unique crinkle cut fries... ESPN on TVs... Friendly helpful staff & ice water available... Smoke Shack Burger has a kick! Will come back soon..."}
{"text":"This was one of my top 5 eats when we booked a 4 day vacation to Vegas. It did not disappoint. Burger was moist, fresh and well seasoned. The fries were equally delicious with all the fixings. 
Decor was modern, a lot of ample seating inside and outside. Great customer service. Would recommend this place to family and friends."}
{"text":"Ive been here a handful of times now and it never disappoints. The size of the burgers is comparable to in n out and they offer the single or double option. This most recent time i had the chicken shack and it was amazing. The chicken was crispy and the mayo and pickles complimented it perfectly. I like the cheese fries also. The flavor is different than other liquid cheeses. It doesnt taste artificial. Definitely check this place out if you love burgers."}
{"text":"Had the smoked shack burger with fries. the burger was okay, but the fries were awful! They were cold and soggy.. Tasted exactly like a frozen bag of fries that were reheated. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I'm not a burger fan; but this was great! Visited 2 times during my Vegas 2 day trip.  Ordered Smoke Shack, Shack Stack, fries and a couple of shakes."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday at 2:00. They greeted us at the door with menus to view while in line. There was also a large menu posted on the hallway in the waitline. The wait to order food was just about 5 minutes long. We found a seat to sit inside. I noticed they have disposable wipes set on the garbage can areas to wipe the table if need be. The food was not ready right away so they gave us a buzzer. It took 20 min for our buzzer to buzz from the time our order was stamped on our receipt! I was starving!!!

My chicken dog was fine, nothing added to it. I opted to add ketchup, mustard, and Louisiana hot sauce which was offered at the condiment counter. My bf had a shack burger which looked rather small and he said was fine. We both however really enjoyed the fries (regular, not cheese which IS offered btw). We shared a soda, which they make behind the counter. 

Needless to say, neither of us are planning another visit, however when or if I do, I plan to try a shake and probably will order some fries to go with it! What can I say If you give a girl some fries.....she may just want a milk shake to go with it!"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken sandwich and fries. Would honestly prefer Red Robin. Food was salty, not my fave place and it's expensive for what you get"}
{"text":"What's not to love about an old New York favorite? Recent short order food and cool atmosphere, with out the Manhattan style lines to push your patience over the edge. 

Last time I ate at a shake shack was at city field in queens, when the mets were still the mets (meaning they were in their rightful place getting smashed by a sub .500 Cincinnati Reds team). The menu looks to have expanded and improved. 

I don't remember hot dogs being on the menu, so I indulged in a chicken dog that was very juicy and completed the set of cheese fries very well. Bonus points for throwing calories on the board (this is something az eateries are very hot or miss on). 

Revolutionary? No, but this is one east coast influence I won't mind eating at again and again."}
{"text":"Love Love LOVE this place! Everything was so good, I had a double Miester burger and my hubby had the shack stack. We both enjoyed the burgers and my hubby said the shroom was definitely something to try. We will becoming back soon."}
{"text":"This place is not bad, burgers are pretty decent and prices are cheap! They have a decent beer selection (just in case you were wondering) and location is clean and convenient.

The only thing that I don't like is all the Jersey Shore people at the MGM grand, what the hell is going on with that ????"}
{"text":"Was so excited to see Shake Shack opening in Vegas! We always get the Shack Stack burger when we are in NYC. For some reason the beef patties were a bit grainy here. 
Still good tho. Ordered a caramel shake and a shake of the week which is Coconut Tres leche, soo good. I gave a 4 stars because I know they just opened, and there's improvement to be as good as a Shake Shack in NYC. I will still always stop by here when in Vegas. Great to see them out west."}
{"text":"its a good burger, i have had better, great bun, they do have abita root beer on tap,!!!!!
cool place to sit outside and people watch. the staff very friendly."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Shake Shack for a very long time. When I visited Vegas in the middle of January, I was so excited that I finally had an opportunity to try it out! 

The location is fantastic. Very easy to find, and very spacious. It is attached to New York New York and is located right on the strip. 

Although The Habit is pretty damn good (Californian here), nothing compares to the Shake Stack (regular cheeseburger with a cheese filled deep fried portobello mushroom inside it). If I could just have that portobello mushroom goodness, I would have it in a heartbeat. 

In addition, I also tried the crinkle cut fries with cheese on it. Delicious. No complaints.

All in all, I can't wait to go back and try it again."}
{"text":"Honestly, I didn't expect much from the generic name, but I was blown away after the first bite. You can taste the difference and can tell they put a lot of love into preparing their burger. Very high quality ingredients and they even serve beer to boot! I'm sold.!"}
{"text":"The biggest downfall of this restaurant is no matter how simple the order, they turn out every order in the exact sequence the orders are placed. I've worked in hospitality management for 10 years. I've never seen a restaurant do this -nor should they. The outcome was cold fries that were sitting under a lamp for a very long time and soda that was prepared 25 minutes before our order was called so it was watered down from the ice melting. Hell, I didn't even order a soda. I ordered an iced tea! If they're going to force you to wait 25 minutes for EVERY order before yours, at least get it right and make sure it's somewhat fresh. The staff freely admit this is how the ordering system works. Yeah, a more complicated order will take longer. Guess what? When half the staff is standing around bored because they're caught up staging sofas and fries, they should hand the damn food to the customers instead of doing petty side work like pre opening to-go bags. Infuriating."}
{"text":"You want some really good burgers?..I've been to Steak N Shake and Bachi Burger acc they dint compare to Shake Shack, by far the best burgers I've had! The staff was great being my first time going, and patient with me. Check it out, it's the only shack to be in when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack is more of a 3.5 but I rounded up because of the filling quality. I ordered a Shack Burger with Shack Sauce on the side in fear of the burger being overwhelmed. The sauce was actually very delicious and had a nice creamy consistency. The sauce complemented the burger well. I also ordered French fries which were nice and crispy but a little on the salty side. My mom got the cheese fries which were decent but not amazing. The burger itself looks pretty small and I finished it rather quickly however with the fries, the meal left me very stuffed which was relieved by a walk on the Strip. Overall, I would return however I won't be running back just to eat the Shackburger. Next time, I hope to try the frozen custard which looked very promising."}
{"text":"Great shakes with a lot of flavor. The fries were very good. Located next door to New York New York."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here.  It's a Monday and the place was practically empty. This was my first SS experience at this highly touted establishment.  This one is located at Downtown Summerlin, a new high-end shopping complex.

I got the Shack Stack @ $7.95 (burger with a patty-sized cheese stuffed portobello mushroom) and fries. The burger/portobello was very tasty, however, rather small, especially for the price. The meat patty itself was pretty skimpy.  The fries were like anywhere else...nothing notable.  

I then had the mint chocolate frozen custard (since I wasn't full from the burger at all) which was  pretty tasty also. $3.60 got a small scoop.  Not cheap, but not outrageous.
This is a trendy millennial's hang.  Kinda disappointed, but I'm not much into trendy.

Oh, service was good and attentive.

GOOD:  Tasty burgers; good service.
BAD:  Pricey; small portions.
MHO:  Bachi Burger beats this place by a mile."}
{"text":"**sigh**
There is a saying, don't go or do anything with expectations because you will always be disappointed.  

The hype over Shake Shack is tremendous. I was in NY this summer and didn't get to try it because the line was out the door every day we passed by no matter what time of day it was. Didn't want to wait in line knowing the Summerlin location was opening soon. 
I wanted so much to like it but....in my opinion In'N'Out is better and here is why:

My first shock was the price. Actually I was told the prices were high, but it still made me gasp looking at the prices. 
I was hungry so I ordered the double shackburger($7.99) thinking it would be like a double double from In'N'Out. 
When I saw the burger it was a lot smaller. The meat was probably similar in size, but smaller buns, and much less lettuce and tomato. I prefer the toasted buns from I'N'O as well as fresher and larger portions of lettuce. After eating 3/4 of the shackburger I had no lettuce or tomato left. The bland taste made me reach for some ketchup. You should never have to do that.  
I like krinkle fries and they were good, but I still prefer the fresh fries from I'N'O. 
Ordered two hamburgers for the kids and three shakes. Vanilla and chocolate were okay. I tried the flavor of the week, salted caramel butter. Very good!

So fast food dinner for me and two kids came out to $41.37. Not quite worth it. Would rather pay much less for In'N'Out or Fatburger, or go sit at a nicer place at Bachi Burger for similar pricing. 

Food is good. I will be back to try the custard and concrete desserts. But as I said, will not live up to the hype. If you go, then go with a 3 star rating in mind and maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did."}
{"text":"Their Frozen Custard is fantastic! I will be back the next time I am in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I ordered a triple cheeseburger it was off the hook much bigger burgers than I thought .the corn dog was good not like the fair but the cheese sauce on the fries was killer .good job. small concrete was tasty but skimpy an had red stuff in it when it was supped too be Vanilla . no worries I'm gonna still give u 4 stars."}
{"text":"Best burger but can't stop getting the peanut butter shake.  Surprisingly quick trip through the line.  Sorry to the competitors but their burger just tastes better, they say its the beef used.  Can't imagine not getting a burger and sitting in the new park or out in front of NYNY.  The fries are great, i prefer them with cheese."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this hamburger place and tried it much to my disappointment. I ordered a burger with just lettuce and onions, was asked if I wanted cheese, which I said no to. and a Chocolate malt. The hamburger came with cheese and they said they could make me another and I said no I'll try it anyway It seemed they just put cheese wiz on it and it tasted like it, so they made me another, one without cheese. It came and was so greasy I could not pick it up, and had to use my knife and fork to eat it and the bun was too doughy, One could get a much better hamburger at Carl's called the big burger for only $1.39 and the best milkshake out there."}
{"text":"Good, tasty and affordable. What more could you want. Yes, the wait time might annoy a few people, but at least this means your food is being prepared reasonably fresh. The food is excellent. Have never been disappointed by the quality of the food I have received."}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype about Shake Shack. I was very excited to go because Shake Shack is originally from New York,and I had heard that executives will send their secretaries to wait in line. Of course I was very eager to try this place, but I also hate going on the strip. I finally tried this place a few days. 

I ordered the shack stack which comes with the one hamburger patty and a deep fried portobello mushroom with cheese. When I first bit into my burger, I thought wow this is amazing. It tastes so great. The patty is so flavorful. However, the way the burger is stuffed, I only got to bit into one bun and not both at the same time. After a while, it just got really really salty which was great because I could drink my lemonade. Only they stuffed my cup with ice and I only had a few sips of lemonade. Not worth it for $2.75 and what appeared to be a 12 oz cup. 

When I first ordered, I ordered a shake stack, but I was charged for a double. I don't eat that much, so I did get a refund. However, they confused me. They should have told me they reopened my check and voided the amount. I thought they were going to do a refund and then recharge me, so I was very confused until my friend explained it to me. 

I would consider maybe going again only if I had an out of town guest who wanted to visit. It's too pricey to be worth it."}
{"text":"That was one of the best and juiciest burgers I have ever had! It was sooooooo flavorful!"}
{"text":"Two words: SHIT shack
 It was extremely expensive and the food was crap. Blend your shakes more losers!"}
{"text":"I have had two bites and I am in love. The beef is fresh and cooked perfect. The veggies are tasty and chrisp. Buns melt in your mouth!!! Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was a huge disappointment- burger was tasteless and overlooked, fries - I do better at home out of the oven.  My dog loved her special dish and my wife liked the milkshake; not sure what all the fuss is about"}
{"text":"Solid shake shack. Great service, the manager walked around and asked us how things were and offered to refill our drinks. Outdoor seating with heaters for those cold Arizona days. Kids got to play out front too."}
{"text":"First and second visit to Shake Shack on our first trip to Vegas. Great burgers, more upscale atmosphere than your typical burger joint and they have beer and wine."}
{"text":"4 stars for being just like Five Guys but with better hospitality. It seemed that we were asked by 5 different people if we enjoyed our meal. Which was ok with me. I had the double hamburger, bacon cheese fries, and a soda. I'm sure I should have gotten a shake, but oh well. The burger was good, but the patties were too small which is one reason why I compared them to Five Guys. Now the bacon cheese fries on the other hand, awesome.  Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try the famous shake shack burgers! It's good, with thick juicy meat patties. 

I do think the burgers and shakes a a tad too pricey though. As in the taste of the burger and shakes wasn't impressive enough to warrant the price. It doesn't help that I much prefer in'n'out for both the burger and shake, and in'n'out is much more affordable. 

Still worth a try to see for yourself though."}
{"text":"I eat here often before going into work. Fast, fresh food! I love the double down fries! Burgers are juicy and delicious."}
{"text":"It's a chain.  Overpriced for what you get when you can go to in and out and get the same product for a quarter of the price.  Tried it and wasn't overly impressed.  This place just reminded me of why I chose to eat local.  I am sure they will do fine without my patronage though."}
{"text":"First time having Shake Shack was this weekend. Our entire group loved it so much that we ended up back there again the very next day. Please come to Seattle area!"}
{"text":"If you care about the price, the burger will not make it any better. It's a great burger but like previous comments the price is just not worth it, if you care about the price.  Personally I liked the burger but left wanting more. It's 2 or 3 bites and that's it, burgers gone. Have to go back for the shakes.. I hear they make up for the small burgers."}
{"text":"The only reason i give this location a three star rating is because the ones in New York are so much better. For whatever reason, the burgers just dont taste the same here. Have been twice and same result.  If you cant get to New York i would say definitely go to this one but if youve been to another i would skip this one."}
{"text":"This place was good for the experience, but I feel like it doesn't compare to In N Out. The restaurant is located at the NYNY hotel on the strip, so you'd have to park at the hotel parking structure or just walk from wherever you are on the strip. The restaurant decor was cool; it reminded me of a retro but modern feel and I liked the idea of using wood materials found in New York (check table pic).
The line moved quickly and my friends and I got our food fast. I ordered a shackburger and regular fries for a complete meal, and it came out to around $7.  

Shackburger: a simple burger with lettuce, tomato, cheese and shack sauce (tasted like it was mustard based); it was pretty small but it had a good flavor. I could tell they also buttered their buns because there was an extra fat component to it. 
Fries: the fries were crispy and crinkle cut, and they were good simple fries, but nothing special. 

For the price I'm paying and the size of the food, I'd have to say it wasn't really worth it. I'll stick to going to In N Out where I can get a really good sized burger for a little over $2; now those are prices you can't beat."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers that sort of taste like In-N-Out's but are much pricier at around $5. The shakes are delicious at around $6 especially the strawberry one and the employees are super sweet! The building itself is also very neat and has foosball"}
{"text":"I have heard for years that this place was the \"east coast in-n-out\". Yes, they both serve burgers and shakes.  But other than that, they have nothing in common.  

We drove 25 min just to see if all this hype was legit. Inside and out it looks like your typical trendy burger joint - except connected to the fashion square mall, making parking a freaking nightmare.  The wife and I ordered two \"shroom\" burgers, 2 shakes, and one French fry. The total was over $30. I knew there had to be some kind of mistake with my order - but I was wrong - it really is that expensive.  I also asked for two cups of water to wash it down - but all they had was a luke-warm serve-yourself nasty tap faucet, and no ice of course. 

They do warn you that the burger is \"hot\", but they didn't warn me that the burger would literally explode as soon as you bite into it. No joke. The burger sauce went everywhere - all over my shirt and hand. It was so hot, it actually burned my hand!  After cleaning myself up, 3 bites later I did end up finishing the burger. I must say, it was good. But definitely not good enough to justify $7 for a burger that was closer in size to a slider. I could have eaten 3-4 of them myself - that is, if I could afford it. 

Run far away from this place and eat at your nearest in-n-out - twice, for less money.  Or you may even be better off at McDonald's for that matter. At least at McD's they're so generous as to put ice in your water."}
{"text":"I don't have fast food very often but I was really impressed with the shake shack. The portion was perfect for me. The burger, fries, and fifty fifty were the perfect portion and were of delicious quality. I left feeling satiated instead of like a stuffed sausage. I will be back."}
{"text":"Disappointed again!  We tried this Shake Shack on the day it opened.  It was terrible.  Today we were out shopping and were hungry.  My sister had never been to s Shake Shack so we went.  It was 12:30 in the afternoon and there was no crowd.  That should have been a clue not to try this place again,  but we did anyway.  We ordered the basic hamburger and fries to go.  Mine was over cooked.  My sister's was under done with too much pink in the middle.  For the price we paid for such a simple meal we could have had a much better  meal at Hop Doddy.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"My son and I visited Shake Shack for the first time.  He was a hater.  Me--it was okay, but I probably wouldn't return.  Son ordered a concrete and a single burger with the mushroom on it.  The entire meal, he was upset over the lack of value.   $15.34 for a small ice cream and not a particularly large burger.  I ordered the mushroom burger and really liked it and an order of fries.  Nothing special about the fries.  My meal was $10.00+.  

The employees are very nice and the place is clean and well kept.  I think that I have raised my son to appreciate bang for his buck and Shake Shack doesn't really measure up."}
{"text":"Can I fault a place for trying too hard? Shake Shack provides a solid burger. The fries as usually quite good. And the concretes, divine. That being said, if you've experienced other Shake Shacks in New York, DC, or elsewhere, this one comes off as, well, trying too hard.

It's trying too hard to be like New York in Las Vegas. Even to the point of being attached to the gaudy New York, New York. They've got a giant video wall that seems to play nothing but endless loops of New York and talks about all the local ingredients that other Shake Shacks use but not at this location.

When I went it was about 1:30pm on a weekday. The restaurant was packed, but the line was manageable and after some stalking I was able to get a seat. The burger was what you would expect from Shake Shack, which is to say, quite good. However, I was flummoxed by trying order two different beers and then a root beer, none of which were actually around. That was disappointing.

If you've never been to a Shake Shack, this is nice - well, if you discount the usual Vegas clientele. But if you've experienced a Shake Shack somewhere else you're better off trying another one of Vegas' many delicious burger restaurants."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible food and way overpriced it doesn't even taste good so I don't get the big lines"}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack! The place is clean and has a cool wooden decor, the food is really good, and the staff is nice. I got the Shroom burger (it's a fried mushroom stuff with cheese, a vegetarian option) and a red velvet concrete. The burger was nice and cheesy and the concrete (frozen custard with pieces of red velvet cake in it) was absolutely amazing. I also split fries with my boyfriend, who enjoyed his cheeseburger and peanut butter shake. Fries were a bit undersalted, but still pretty good."}
{"text":"Delicious, one of the best burgers I've had. Tasty beef, not salty at all, just enough lettuce and tomato, fresh soft bun, and perfectly melted cheese. The cheese fries are not ordinary either. They mix cheddar with american for a yumminess that's unique. Also had the best root beer floats, not sure what kind of soda is used but it has a bite to it that compliments the creamy ice cream in a most delicious way. Definitely a fan."}
{"text":"A great burger joint I will definitely be coming back next Vegas trip! Line was out the door when we arrived they were quick to get order and get food out! Only down fall is burgers are a little small but still really yummy and would totally go back!!"}
{"text":"Great location, very trendy, but the lines are insane. I've never tried Shake Shack before so I waited in line to order, it moved steadily and when it was my turn they were very quick and efficient. However, it takes FOREVER to get your food!! I may have waited 20 minutes for a single burger...

They all were working quick inside the kitchen but maybe the company underestimated how big the kitchen should be? It wasn't crowded inside, and just a steady trickle of people coming in as it's the off season and a Sunday night too, so I have no clue how they could ever handle a real crowd when something is going on at the new arena or something.

The burger itself was fine, I really liked the gooey sauce on there and the meat was very well seasoned, but the bread was kinda chewy, it overpowered the rest of the burger for me. I also got a creamsicle float, and the custard was amazingly smooth. However, there just wasn't enough in there! Most of my drink just tasted like I got an orange soda unfortunately.

The actual restaurant is spacious and trendy feeling, great atmosphere. However, I don't think I'm coming back anytime soon if I have to wait that long to actually eat :("}
{"text":"Well, I happened to be in Vegas and decided to try out Shake shack.  It was ok, the bottom bun was soggy from grease, but I really liked the crinkle cut fries! I'm sorry to say I'd prefer umami burger, or even innout! 

Maybe the original in nyc will be better!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday afternoon. No lines. I got a Shack Stack, my daughter a double hamburger. We also got a regular fry, cheese fry, chocolate custard, and red velvet custard. First of all, don't order the fries. The worst fries ever at any resteraunt.  The cheese sauce helped a bit but.... dry and greasy. My shack stack, first bite, cheese squirted out the other side onto the table. The next few bites were delicious! However I soon felt a greasy film in my mouth. Yuck! Don't know if it was grease from the meat, bad cheese, or whatever they fried the portabella mushroom in. The double ham was fine, so suspect the mushroom. The chocolate custard was good, the red velvet was not. I don't think it was even red velvet. Don't the know it's chocolate? It tasted more like what others call birthday cake with red velvet cake crumbled on top. The root beer was good. Kinda wish I tried the float. Something made my daughters throat tighten up (not entirely sure what she's allergic to). Also, I asked that the burgers be cooked medium well. She said they did that anyways. Apparently she didn't hear the well part. The real problems came later. Searching for a bathroom. We both had that problem."}
{"text":"So much noise around the awesome food at this place that I decided to try it and was not disappointed. Unfortunately I don't eat beef so I ended up eating the chicken hotdog. And boy was it flavorful!! I loved it and would certainly hope that they open one in Seattle."}
{"text":"Walking the Las Vegas strip, we decided try out Shake Shack. Apparently I heard it's kinda a big deal in the east coast. It's new to Las Vegas. The food and shakes is good, not LV great. Portions are small for the price you pay, but that's just my opinion. Service is friendly.  It's huge inside but hard to get a table if you're with a big group.  Worth trying if you've never been to one of these before.  But for more bang for your buck, you're better off going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday at 5;00-not too crowded the staff was pleasant and the place was clean. For a high calorie fried burger and French fry place I guess I would of expected slightly healthier options or better ingredients.  This just tasted like any other hamberger joint like whataburger, in and out etc.  honestly I'd still rather have 5 guys any day.  I had a crinkle cut fries and a chicken burger which were ok and a large drink for $13.12.  Won't be back unless in a pinch."}
{"text":"The line is definitely worth the burgers and the shakes! I get to go to New York New York and this is definitely my favorite restaurant and my favorite restaurant in the world. The burgers are literally the best. To go with that the shakes are amazing my favorite is the caramel shake and I'm one for shakes. I will be back"}
{"text":"Great burger. Every bit the equal of In & Out. Much better than many high-end, $25 wagu, rib eye steak, resort burgers. The fries are very good. The chicken sandwich is also off the hook delicious. Always in for a treat when dining at the shake shack."}
{"text":"Lol, there's a reason Shake Shack has better reviews at their Scottsdale location: you need to be financially solid to look past the prices here. 

Unfortunately, the fried chicken sandwich here is *pretty* good. So are their shakes. :( My cheap ass will begrudingly be back on payday. My spouse will just have to stay hungry or get Wendy's."}
{"text":"I got the shack stack which is s must if you're going to go! The burger was delicious and the cheese filled fried mushroom is a must! And of course add pickles. The fries were good, not too soft and not too crunchy."}
{"text":"This place was just ok, I'm my opinion. There's nothing wrong with it, but I just expected more out of it based on the hype I had been hearing. Food quality is good, although it's a bit pricey. Definitely worth a go if you're in the area. If not, I don't think it's worth a special trip."}
{"text":"Best damn burger in Vegas! The special sauce really makes the burger pop! Nice soft bun, juicy patty...it all just melts in your mouth like paradise. 

Not a huge fan of crinkle fries, but it don't matter because the burger makes up for it.

Also had a half chocolate half vanilla shake as the cherry on top of my delicious burger adventure. Perfect combination. 

Wish they had this at home!!!"}
{"text":"Getting a shack stack never fails. 
Hamburger patty topped with a breaded portobello mushroom."}
{"text":"Too crowded. Long waiting line. Taste is not as great as in New York, but still so good."}
{"text":"Smokestack And fries. Food is no good especially for the outrageous price. In n out, smash burger are hands down better burgers. Only thing good about this place is the atmosphere. I'll give that to them but food basically no good."}
{"text":"the Shack Stack Burger was worth the wait! especially in VEGAS with an ice cold beer."}
{"text":"It's 11 AM and they are out of burgers! Seriously?? And the line is moving at snail pace. I would give zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"The hamburger, fries, and small shakes were good but not good enough to pay $17.  Didn't get a soda or it would have been $20.  Way too expensive for lunch. The portion size is small as well.  Perfect size if you are watching your weight... Two stars for great service.  They do have gluten free buns though. 

Overall, I will not return unless they cut their price in half.  I will stick with five guys, Friendly's, In N Out, and Farmers Boys.  Red Robin if I want to spend $20 for lunch."}
{"text":"There's SO much space at this location compared to the one at Tyson's Corner, VA. The service here is even better; one woman was really attentive and kept asking if we needed anything. 

The Shack Burger and Cheese Fries were on point. Seriously, it tasted much better than an animal style burger and fries at In N Out. Although the chicken sandwich was quite good, nothing can compare to a Chick-fil-A sandwich. 

If only the prices were similar to In N Out, I'd come here much more often...."}
{"text":"This place sucked. The burger was small and disgusting, they even screwed up the chocolate shake. For the amount of money they charge you would expect it to be much better. I could've got a better meal at DQ across the street! I wish I had two
extra hands so I could give this place 4 thumbs down."}
{"text":"The first visit to the Shake Shack.  For 2 bacon cheeseburgers, 2 bacon cheese fries, a shake and a large soda was $37.20!!!!!  I didn't ask to buy the restaurant, just eat there.   The food was ok but my bacon on my burger was overcooked and very salty.  The fries were good but again very salty.   There is no beverage bar for refills and $2.80 for a large drink (medium size at McDonald's) is a bit much.  The shake of the week was $5.59. 

Overall, I don't think it lives up to the hype or price."}
{"text":"THE BEST BURGER JOINT IN LIFE! I really should be a promoter on how much I endorse this place of deliciousness where the food is blessed angels tears of joy."}
{"text":"THE BEST BURGER JOINT IN LIFE! I really should be a promoter on how much I endorse this place of deliciousness where the food is blessed angels tears of joy."}
{"text":"At at Shake Shack on Friday the 21st. It was a delicious burger and fries but my wife and I spent later that night and the next day in the bathroom. My kids had the hotdog and they didn't get it. Awesome way to spend a six hour drive home."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Great places! Great atmosphere! One thing I wish they did different was...not giving you a new cup every time you got a refill."}
{"text":"Burgers were delicious but very small size. Shakes were very thick but no flavor 
Wish burgers were bigger and add more flavors in your shakes."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Shake Shack for awhile. When I lived in Chicago, the only place I could get it was while on vacation in NYC. I've waited in loooong lines in Madison Square Park for those burgers.

When it came to Chicago I was thrilled. And loved that the lines were shorter.

Now that I'm in Phoenix I love that there's one nearby and the no crazy lines. I'm not sure why I used to wait in those lines, I think it was a bit of hype. But I'm a fan and it's a good fast casual burger. The shakes are pricey, especially the special flavors, but they're tasty.

We come here at least once a month, the employees are always friendly and II'm glad to have it in the hood."}
{"text":"I tried this out and I don't understand what all the hype is about. All I have to say is,...Next time I'm going to hit In-N-Out and call it a day. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack but this location is an abomination! I understand you are serving drunk people but unfortunately I was sober. The SmokeShack was completely falling apart, had bad consistency and greasier than usual SmokeShack burger at other places. The Chick'n Shack had more crust than the meat. The fires were decent but by now I was already turned off. I would completely avoid this location and go to the new one in T-mobile Arena. 
SmokeShack - 1/5
Chick'n Shack - 2/5
Fries - 4/5"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan!
I had the ShackBurger and SmokeShack, with a side of regular fries and a strawberry shake.
This is by far the best \"chained\" burger restaurant in the US.

The burgers are pretty small, so I would recommend getting two if you're making a meal of this. 

The buns that are used for the burgers here are out of this world, and each bite really nails the \"meat to bread\" ratio perfectly. The SmokeShake does have a bit of a kick, so beware of that if you're not that in to spicier foods (it's not overbearing or intensely spicy, but you'll definitely feel it).

The fries are crispy and not overly salty, and ShakeShack so far has executed on consistency each time I have been.

The shakes here... just get one. Strawberry or the Black and White shake."}
{"text":"Too expensive and too salty! The black and white shake was awesome but everything else was awful. The fries were terrible and the burgers were over salted. Five guys is way better!"}
{"text":"Read about all the hype about this place so decided to get in line and check it out. Well its mostly true, the burgers are damn good! I think they taste slightly better than in and out burger. I like their crinkled fries better too. It's located at new York new York casino on the strip and I'll be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Delicious food and our cashier was friendly and funny. The reason I only gave four stars was because they gave us the wrong flavor milkshake and had a miscommunication in the kitchen which ended up taking 10 minutes and 2 trips to the counter to get the correct shake. They did let us keep other one too and since we were \"dinning in,\" the wait wasn't too bad. Burger was juicy and cooked just right, the chicken was flavorful and crispy, the fries were crunchy, and the shakes were thick and creamy! Food was on point!!!"}
{"text":"Still prefer Habit's burgers but I am a fan of the concretes! Delicious, full flavored and good quality custard. Ordered the All Shook Up in a small size and they were generous with the mix-ins. Would come back just for the custard especially since there is a window just for them.

TIP: If you are a MGM Rewards Plat or Noir card holder, there is a special line where you can skip the crowds!"}
{"text":"Unreal...best burger I've ever had, hands down. Coming from a die hard Five Guys fan boy, this speaks volumes!

Had the double Shake Shack straight off the menu, no adders.  Took a bit for the order to come up, but they were busy and I don't mind waiting for quality, heck they even give you a buzzer so you know when your order's up, genius.

What stands out the most was how the melted american cheese formed a shell around the two patties, I honestly wondered the entire time I was eating how they did that.  You could tell the meat wasn't just ground beef -- come to find out its a mixture of brisket, short rib, and sirloin.  It takes great deal of pride and confidence in your burger to go that bold, and it pays off big.  This joint gains a great deal of respect from me for doing that.

The shack sauce was reminiscent of the animal sauce from In and Out, but a bit thinner, and I liked that -- not so mayonnaisey.

My best burger reality has shifted forever because of this place...."}
{"text":"This is my favorite type of burger place and it has one of the best shakes the price is pricey though, but it's all worth it I like going here once in awhile to spend money on great food I love the atmosphere and it's located on the strip :)"}
{"text":"Eh, it's alright.  It tastes pretty good but everything is overpriced with small portions.  I'm glad I tried it, but I will stick to In n Out or Freddy's."}
{"text":"Ordered my first single shack burger this weekend. It was so good, I should've ordered a double. 

Usually not a fan of crinkle cut fries, but for some reason, theirs was awesome! 

Definitely will be back whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place is nice. The workers are nice. Burgers were a little on the salty side. But nothing here that blew my socks off. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. If they had a drive thru lol then that's a different story. But I'm not taking the time to go to the strip to get it."}
{"text":"I want to thank Daniel, one of the managers at Las Vegas location ! Outstading service and thank you so much for coming to talk to us ! he was so concerned that our food took so long and apologized for the delay. Thanks for everything!"}
{"text":"A far cry from the Shake Shack in NYC. We ordered 4 burgers and all of them were burnt, very dry, and bland. The shacksauce was so little that it hardly enhanced the taste of the burger. This branch failed big time."}
{"text":"My taste buds didnt shake as much as the hype said they would. It was a good burger, not a huge fan of the fries. The shake, vanilla was good but chocolate wasn't anything spectacular. Possibly the hype created unrealistic expectations. It's comparable to a Smash but I would choose Smash over the Shack."}
{"text":"This chain has been on our list to check out. It's beautiful and clean. Fast service. Line moved well. 

The food was not that great. The chickn shack looked soooo great but was soggy, flavorless and small. The best part was the pickles. 

The loaded fries are really just three single servings with cheese, bacon and the peppers. Totally skip them and just get normal fries. They got soggy quick. 

The Shack Attack concrete came out liquid. I now today is hot but it's like I am spooning a shake. It wasn't mixed well either so the bits were all clumped into one monster piece. Flavor was great though. 

Maybe the NYC or LA stores are better. Might never try now."}
{"text":"I've had burgers at Gordon Ramsay BurGR, Holstein's, and a few more places in Vegas, but Shake Shack is where I keep coming back! I've had Shake Shack in Vegas, NYC, and Los Angeles. The quality is pretty much the same regardless of the location. I live in southern California and this definitely puts In-N-Out to shame, although it is quite pricey for a fast food joint. ($25 for 2 burgers, a soda, and a shake- Ouch!) I'm glad I'm moving to Atlanta soon where I'm going to have a Shack Shack location within a 10-mile radius! Ha!"}
{"text":"I went to Vegas recently on a weekend trip with some friends and we came here for lunch one day. I ordered the SmokeShack single without the cherry peppers and an order of the cheese fries with a black and white shake to drink.

The bun on the burger was delicious! It was toasted and warm and the cheese was melted and gooey. The ShackSauce was on the creamy side and had some spice to it. The cheese fries were also yummy, they come with a fork that keeps your hands from getting messy (they are very cheesy cheese fries, just how I like 'em!). The black and white shake was okay, good, but not great. It was a blend of chocolate and vanilla so I would want to get a more specialized flavor the next time. 

The line was long when we got there but they were efficient with taking orders and then getting your order out, so don't let that sway you! It was not a bad wait at all."}
{"text":"Love it!!! Cool place, and the best mushroom burger! Can't wait to the stadium next door to open so I can come more often!"}
{"text":"Have tried the burgers in New York, having them in Vegas was re-experiencing! The 'Shroom Cheese Burger is damn tasty and the melted cheese gives it a pornfood style! Try out the Chocolate attack concrete to fitful your experience!"}
{"text":"Shack Stack cheeseburger is much better than In N Out. The crisp-fried Portobello mushroom filled with melted cheese was so yummy! Cheese Fries is OK, and Coffee Shade is too sweet for me. And the prices are are much higher than In N Out.
I will come back again."}
{"text":"A nice fast-casual burger experience. Usually very busy but lines just move quickly especially with the foot traffic in Vegas. Burgers were good, a tad overrated though. Will return, it was tasty nonetheless."}
{"text":"Cheese sauce. Matthew went above and beyond by offering to take our pager and brought us the food when ready. Food was perfect. Restaurant is always clean. Thanks again"}
{"text":"Came at 3p on a Sunday. Line to the door, took about 10min to get through the line and to order. Sadly, I wanted a shake of their custard of the week and they were out 
Got the Smoke Shack burger, salted caramel shake, and fries. 
Burger was pretty good. Plain, just meat, bacon, cheese, and peppers. I would have added lettuce tomatoes on it if I get it again. It was good - not $8 good, but good. 
I hate crinkle cut fries but these were pretty good! Very crispy! Better than del taco fries by a mile!
The shake was the best part. Delicious. 
The atmosphere is really cool and nice, lots of seating. Food takes about 20min. 
Similar experience to in n out where you just have to realize you're gonna wait awhile for your food. 
Will I come back? Prob not, but I tried it."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is a pretty good restaurant! Service:5
Place:5  Food:4  Seating:4.  The reason I give this place 4 stars is because the burgers were small and the seats were ripped, even though the service and place was pretty good. We had a fairly good meal, but the 50/50 drink(half iced tea half lemonade) you had to mix it together but the place is awesome."}
{"text":"We had the chicken sandwiches, fries, and a root beer float. The food was pretty delicious, but the float didn't do much for us. Heard so much about this place from my New York friends and I would definitely recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I had heard about Shake Shack on the East coast so when I heard it was coming to AZ I was excited. I had a plain hot dog with cheese sauce and cheese fries. They let you choose whether you want the cheese sauce directly on top of the fries or on the side in a little cup which is convenient. Everyone was friendly and helpful. I will go back again. I can't wait until they open in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to eat at the Shake Shack last week for lunch. I wanted to go here based on the yelp reviews. When we arrived the line was out the door but it moved pretty quick. Food was ok. Friendly service. Personally I prefer In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Such flavorful burgers.. 

I had the smoke shack and it was so savory and delicious! You can tell that the burger is quality from the first bite you take. It was super juicy and the thick bacon really stood out to me with its outstanding flavor. This burger is in a category of its own. I can't compare it to other places. 

The cheese on the fries was so creamy and good.. I was not expecting the cheese to have such mind blowing flavors. I definitely recommend the fries with cheese. 

The custards are so tasty and have so so much texture because of the tid bits of deliciousness they combine in the custard. I had some of the mallow monsoon and camel shack.. The camel shack had the banana creme pie combined with the salted caramel sauce in there giving it a unique flavor of its own, I just couldn't get enough of it. The mallow monsoon had the delicious chocolate truffle cookie dough with sugar cone cookie pieces.. Amazing... I liked both of them so much but when I go again I would get the camel shack because of its unique out of this world flavors.

Overall, there is no doubt I am making this place a regular for getting burgers."}
{"text":"GAHT DAYUM THIS PLACE IS GOOD!! 

Coming from someone who adores In n Out, this is really saying a lot. Go all out and get the Shack burger with the mushroom and cheese oozing out. The cheese gets a little overwhelming so if you choose to get fries, I say get them regular and use the oozing cheese to make your fries cheesey! Onions do NOT come standard either. And honestly, onions make the burger SO MUCH BETTER. But they don't do them grilled which is pretty lame. 

Also got the coffee shake and made it malt. Go. All. Out. 

For the price you pay, In n Out is still better. But for a decent meal in Vegas, Shake Shack is a great spot to get your drunchies / hangover food."}
{"text":"This place is so freaking yummy. Perfect portion size and just absolutely delicious. I love taking my kids here and they enjoy the hot dogs and cheese fries. Also, Carl Mclure is the most kindest person ever. I love when we walk in and see him there. Great place, great food, and great employees. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"We decided to take my dad for his first time at Shake Shack as he'd never been. He ordered the burger with a mushroom and enjoyed it a lot. Overall still the best burger and can't wait to have one closer to home."}
{"text":"Finally came here after hearing about all the hype, especially from my east coast pals.  Good burgers and shakes, but for the money, In-N-Out sets a bar that's tough to beat.  Ambiance of the restaurant here is very nice, especially for fast food, but I was expecting a bit more from the burger.  I had the Smoke Shack, which was topped with red peppers, which had a very nice heat to it.  It would have been better if perhaps the bun was more toasted.  The milk shakes were balanced and not overly sweet.  While I'd come here again, I wouldn't say it met the (overly) high expectations."}
{"text":"Shake shack is soooo good! 

What I dislike isn't so much the food or the service, but how crowded it is because people eat and then lounge ... 
In a busy restaurant it's common courtesy to eat then leave and let someone else sit down, but that's just my opinion. The line looked long but went by super fast. Their mango lemonade was so good! Not too sweet, just right."}
{"text":"4 stars to the Henderson location. Way better food and service than the store near NYNY.  Would be more convenient if you installed a self serve soda/drink station.  I love the Shroom \"burger.\""}
{"text":"We have heard a lot of great things about Shake Shack, so a visit here was a must. The line was out the door, but we decided to wait. Prices quite high, and that can be ok if the burgers are top notch.

We struggled to find a table, but eventually we did. The restaurant is very noisy, so be prepared to either scream at each other, or eat in silence.

The food then: the burgers were very good. Juicy and tasted very nice. The fries was just ok, nothing more. Actually, they tasted and looked exactly the same as the ones you buy in your local grocery store in Sweden, from the freezer and put in the oven at home. :) Nothing wrong with that, but hey, I expect a little bit more here..

All in all, good good burger, standard fries, expensive drinks.

Would probably go again, if I was outside and hungry. On the other hand, Five Guys is just 10 minutes drive, and MUUUUUCH better. ;)"}
{"text":"First time here very excited to try it. The line was not very long however there was no where to sit inside. They also have a small sitting area outdoors but it was too hot for that. I ordered a burger, cheese fries and a strawberry shake. It was all very good! I noticed they have an ordering window outside, if you have a simple order for just custard etc"}
{"text":"First off the burger and the cheese fries were really good, the shake was good too.  I would put it on par with In and Out as far those go.  The difference was the price.  1 burger, 1 double burger, 1 hot dog, 1 order of cheese fries and 3 shakes came to $39.  I could get more for less with about the same quality at In and Out.  It was good, but once is enough."}
{"text":"Go to steak and shake you get way better shak and berger this place has no service dirty table I say f#^÷& 
Over price garbage place Burger are good but the wait and dirty table is a let down"}
{"text":"I have been waiting months for this place to finally open because I've always heard great things about it. It did not disappoint. I got there right before they opened as I knew there would be a line (sure enough there was). They handed us menus while we waited and offered water while sitting, waiting for my food. Great customer service! I ordered the SmokeShack and regular fries (want to try the cheese fries and concretes next time). The burger was absolutely delicious!! The cheese was perfectly melted, the peppers were an added pop of flavor and the bacon of course was just great. I would have liked some lettuce added and the buns to be more toasted but I know to request it next time. I'm usually not a fan of crinkle cut fries (reminds me of elementary school) but these were very good. I imagine the cheese fries will be just amazing. I can't wait to return and try a concrete also! I love that they serve beer and wine as well as offering chicken. Great place, great service, great food. They have plenty of space indoors and outdoors and have long wooden tables to fit many guests. Must try! Thank you Shake Shack for coming to Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Sadly I have to give Shake Shack one star. This is an extremely commercialized business that sells small portion at exorbitant prices. A very small chicken burger was $7. An even smaller single party burger was also $7. The milkshake was forgettable. The setting and ambiance is cool but that's not why I go to a restaurant. My friend and I went, it was the first time for each of us, neither are coming back. We thought this would be a competitor with in'n out. Not close. Disappointing! One star!"}
{"text":"The fries r delicious so r their home made lemonades but go for the hot dogs instead of the burgers u will b shocked they taste just like the Wendy's jr bacon cheeseburgers"}
{"text":"I was going to do a vlog review (since I have a You Tube channel) but after the fist bite the burger was so horrible that I couldn't.  All I got was a cheeseburger and boy was it horrible!  I make better burgers at home.  It was small, and VERY greasy (I had to tear pieces of the bun off because they were soaked in grease), the meat had no flavor at all (hear of salt?).  The meat was slightly pink, and it just seemed under cooked.  My husband had the chicken sandwich.  It looked good, so I asked for one bite.  It was even greasier than my burger, and it tasted like burnt grease.  To top it all off, I was looking forward to a chocolate shake, but the shake machine was down.  

Note to management:  get a second shake machine just in case the first one is inoperable.  

I would recommend any other burger place over this one.  I will never return."}
{"text":"A tad on the pricy side for a burger, shake, and fries.. but amazingly good. So, worth it."}
{"text":"Melted shakes, melted and warm root beer float honestly the root beer float from Wendy's and the shakes from in and out are way better... what a horrible experience after a long waiting and driving  time, and the menu is all confusing when it comes to shakes and custard good luck guys you can improve your recipes and be better one day!"}
{"text":"I had the cheeseburger and also tried my husband's mushroom burger. We also had cheese fries and the coffee shake. Everything tasted okay. I enjoyed the company of my friends as the ambiance was great for a casual hang out among friends. My favorite burger and fries combo is from in n out!"}
{"text":"Fantastic buffet! A little bit of something for everybody. All of the food was fresh and hot (if it was supposed to be hot)."}
{"text":"Best burger in Vegas.  Cant wait for Summerlin Location."}
{"text":"First time visiting and got in the wrong line . Counter person aggressively yells at us \"wrong line \" ... nice customer service shake shack or whatever your called ."}
{"text":"over hyped,all I here how good it is.made a trip pretty much to try it and if I had my choice rather go to in and out or sonic.to me it was just an average burger with some good toppings.and to get to it is a pain if you are not within walking distance of it.had to park in ny ny lot walk the whole casino just to get there.,sorry but wont be back for a while if ever,sorry.Look where I live in cali there are tons of small mom and pop burger joints that are so good better than any chain and yes better than in and out.I am sure where ever you live you have to have one like we have in cali.they are the ones that need the money and local support not the big chains"}
{"text":"Did not live up to the hype. For a $6 burger (the Shack Burger), I expect it to at least keep this 100lb girl from going hungry but it did not. The burger was good but there was nothing special about it. Tried some of my friend's Crinkle Cut Cheese Fries since I was still starving after the burger, and they were delicious. Highly recommend getting it with your order. The line of course was really long but it went quickly and service for the cashier to the busboys were up to par!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers (I had the one with crispy onions), good fries (we had the ones with cheese) and great milkshakes and concretes. Their coffee milkshake is not overly sweet but perfect for all you coffee fans. I literally have no complaints about the food. Not a huge wait, even for a Saturday night, and plenty of tables. They serve beer and wine too. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I had chicknshack .haha snack size burger though taste good.but im still hungry after eating chesse fries.
Fries just ok shake was good but not great.i like burgerking shake more.looks fancy but overpriced."}
{"text":"Food is really good, service good, and the restaurant was clean.I wish they had a few more non-beef options but worth going."}
{"text":"Really good and freshly made food. We had the Shackburger with cheese and the ChickenShack, cheese fries and a brown sugar shake which was solo good. So much better than Fatburger."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!! How can a major burger joint (at least I think that's what they consider themselves) be out of beef? OUT OF BEEF? AT a hamburger joint? Really? I'm going to have to say that In-n-Out is the best. Shake Shack doesn't seem to be up to the challenge. Out of beef??? That's like a gas station being out of gas or a pizzeria being out of pizza dough. From Cali and never had a chance to try SS. Guess I still can't. At least Wahlburgers had beef."}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich had breading that was overcooked and greasy.  Chocolate cone was good.  I was surprised at how many people were there.  Total came to over $10, quality and wait time not worth it.  There are too many better places, so won't go back."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Had the single Smokeshack burger and their fresh lemonade, wife had a regular burger and a chocolate shake.  

Inexpensive and well prepared.  What really stood out were the helpful employees in the dining area that offered to get drink refills for you, and generally kept people moving in and out efficiently."}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich and shroom burger were good. Milkshake was awesome. Easy access from Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"Finally tried Shake Shack and loved it. Had a double Shack Burger which is in the Five Guys and Wendy's flavor category and not like In N Out. Fries were great and had a Chocolate Cookies & Cream shake that was amazing."}
{"text":"Love, love this place! We have been to the Las Vegas, LAX, NYC , and Chicago locations. We eat here whenever we visit a city that they have a store. Amazing burgers, and great shakes. You won't regret it! It can be pricey for a burger, but it is totally worth it, which explains the cult following, and the long lines all the time."}
{"text":"Burger was moist in a bad way... Too much hype for a marginal burger.  No substitute for in-n-out."}
{"text":"This place has amazing veggie burgers ( mushroom burger stuffed with melting cheese)!!!! The cheese fries are also so yummmmm. Save room for dessert for some other ice cream shops nearby though because they are not that impressive. Overall to eat here is not cheap, but if you are looking for some top notch vegetarian choices.... Eat here!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard all the hype, but wasn't impressed with the burger or fries here. However the peanut butter shake was amazing. I made a return trip just for another shake. The only problem is they need a bigger size shake."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean restaurant, delicious burgers
and fries....my kinda place!
Every once in a while I crave a cheeseburger and
this is my new go to spot. Portions are reasonable 
without being excessive."}
{"text":"Always good.. just wondering why one in Vegas is better?? You would think they'd be consistent but one in Vegas noticeably better.. I go to Vegas often for work and eat there so i do notice a difference.. but all in all I highly recommend I am a burger  fanatic..."}
{"text":"If you are a burger fan you will love this place!! The best part about is you don't feel gross after eating it.  Quality tasting beef, although I would like the fries to taste better.   I didn't get a chance to try there shakes but would love to give them a try one day."}
{"text":"Having never been to a Shake Shack before, I walked in with an open mind and was immediately impressed. The decor and vibe are modern and make this feel like a good place to hang out. A selection of couches, bar stools, and regular tables are provided for seating - something for everyone! The menu is displayed by the line, so that I could decide on my order before getting up to the counter. The selection of food is excellent (they even have hotdogs!) but a bit expensive.
The cashier was rude and signaled us over with an abrupt wave of the arm and an unwelcoming face. The poor service was made up for by the delicious food! Flavorful, fresh, and hot. I'll be back here again."}
{"text":"Never planned to actually go here.....

We got up and it was raining, raining I say!  That screwed our plans for the day, so we decided to eat at our hotel.  We waited around until 11 and cruised over.

Now, I remembered a friend of mine saying she went to the one in NYC and wasn't actually paying attention when she ordered so she got the mushroom burger and it was an actual portabella and not a burger with mushrooms and Swiss, so in looking over the menu I had to laugh.

I got the ShackMeister dog and my husband got the Shack-ago dog.  We split a small order of fries and I got a peanut butter shake.  I was on vacation, what can I say?

Sat down in a terribly uncomfortable booth.  It was wooden and my belt kept getting caught on the back of the booth so I was getting irked.

Food didn't take too long and we dug in - hot dogs were decent.  Mine had 2 kinds of cheese and some crispy french fried shallots.  I liked it and it hit the spot, but I wouldn't get it again.  Fries were good as well.  I love crinkle cuts, so that helped.  I'm not a burger eater, so may not be the place for me.

What I would get again is one of those shakes - whoa!  I'm not a huge ice cream fan, but this sucker was great!  Smooth and delicious with not an overpowering peanut butter taste.  I got a small, but I should have gotten something bigger since my husband kept saying, \"can I have some more?\"

So, next trip to Vegas, I get a really big shake to take while bumming around town...even though it will not last very long!"}
{"text":"First Shake Shack I ever went to, and it was wonderful. Went last November, it was raining and cold so I'm not sure if that's why the place was a little empty around sunset time. Still a much easier experience than the West Hollywood place I'm stuck going to now since I live in California.

I'm a big fan of Shake Shack in general, and I wrote a more thorough review about the Hollywood location so I won't go in depth again. However when I was there they had the ShackMeister burger, which was similar to a regular ShackBurger except they had crispy, delicious fried shallots as a topping. It was so freaking good, it's a shame they don't offer that burger anymore (I don't currently see it on their online menu). Their crinkle cut fries are also excellent, and the layout of the restaurant is open, large and looks great.

Also great service. When I asked for a business card, the manager said they didn't have any but went to the back and gave us some free coupons instead! It was a great keepsake and a classy move from the management.

All in all, had a great experience here and it was definitely an awesome location for a first timer!"}
{"text":"Food was cold like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for way too long ( they are busy so they premake the food and put it sitting out) Got the mushroom burger and the cheese inside wasn't even melted. Won't eat here again."}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack! It's my favorite burger joint....in New York. This location's menu is overprized. Burgers are basically sliders. They are small! Shroom burger tasted bland. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"We ordered a double shack burger with bacon and the chick'n shack, cheese fries, shackmeister beer, and a brownie batter shake. Everything was so good! The burger was so greasy, the chicken sandwich was so crispy... cheese fries didn't even need salt to make them taste better! If you're looking for a good burger, definitely come here!"}
{"text":"Ok. First visit. I picked the shroom burger. You should know what it is first. It had a huge portabella mushroom the size of the burger. It was deep fried stuffed with cheese. Plopped on top of the hamburger.  It was really crispy. When I bit into it tasted bland. The mushroom breading was dark brown. All this cheese oozed out of it. I don't quite understand why hamburger places don't put lettuce tomato and onion on to burst their burgers with flavor. I know it was the onion missing that made it bland. I had very thin slice of tomato and lettuce was wet and soggy. I pulled off the big mushroom. I ate at home so I couldn't bring it back which is what I would've done. The girl that waited on me sweet as she was, told me to let her know if I didn't like it so I wouldn't have felt bad returning it. She said we could fix it if you don't like it. I'm not really fussy so I thought it would be o.k. When I pulled off the big deep fried mushroom the hamburger was really thin. The bread was wet and I realized I paid 13.00 for that and plain fries. The hamburger was as thin and small as McDonald's small hamburger. The hamburger alone WAS GOOD though. I can't blame the cook. In and out is 3.50 for a double double with everything on it. They'll even grill your onions and give extra onions. Their bursting with flavor and made fresh. I spent 13.00. The hamburger was 6.99. Fries 2.99. I don't have a clue why it was 13.00. I didn't get a drink. Now I'm on my way to in and out. That's more my budget anyway. If I go to a restaurant where I'm waited on it's different but it is a fast food place. I have to say the employees were sweet and cook very nice."}
{"text":"A+ for Shake Shack being extremely fast for our order for ~11 people. The line was almost out the door, but moved quickly to order (about 10 minutes!), put in our order and the person behind the counter said 5-10 minutes. WHAT? For comparison, two salads were ordered at Bruxie for the same time and it took longer than the 11 burgers/dogs/fries/etc. 

I ordered the peanut butter shake, shake stack, and cheese fries. All were very delicious, but very pricey - this was probably about ~$20, steep for a meal for one person! 

- Shake stack - A burger that has a patty and fried portebello mushroom oozing with sauce and cheese. I shared this and this was a lot! It was delicious, perfect for soaking up the alcohol that was drank/will be drank, but definitely greasy and heavy. I guess I would not recommend if you're trying to look skinny for day club. $9.29 - would get again only if sharing again.
- Cheese Fries - the cheese sauce was yummy! But also not sure if I like crinkle fries personally. ($3.50..?)
- Peanut butter shake - get this if you like peanut butter ($5.25..?)

If I am near a Shake Shack and my friends wanted to go or in this case everyone is too drunk/tired to go get food so we went out to get it all to bring it back to the hotel room so everyone could survive the rest of the night - yes, I would be down for some cheesy ooey mushroom goodness. Definitely would not go out of my way for this burger and would probably choose In-N-Out for price and convenience, but coming from California I would not have to go out of my way for In-N-Out either since they're located everywhere!

Would recommend for the hype."}
{"text":"Exactly what I was hoping for. Burgers were excellent - especially for the speed they are prepared, and the low price (for Strip standards). The place is an absolute zoo, but they have it so well organized you almost can't tell. Five of us got a table no problem. Lines were huge too.

Small portions, so be prepared for that.

For all you MLife people out there: Platinum and Noir card holders can skip the line - awesome perk."}
{"text":"ShackBurgers are the best darn cheeseburgers ever!  The burgers are very juicy & flavorful.  Their famous Shack sauce mayo aioli sauce is beyond yummy, love it!!!  The crinkle cut fries are ok, kinda bland, nothing too special since anything fried always seems to taste good.  I've tried their Chick'n Shack, fried chicken sandwich and didn't think too much about it, its alright but I prefer their burgers.  If its your first visit, definitely go w/ their ShackBurger, its absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"We had lunch here this afternoon and I gotta say the ShakeBurgers (100% all natural angus burger w/ american cheese, lettuce, tomato & their super yummy Shake sauce) were absolutely delish!  I love the clean fast casual ambience, quality ingredients (no hormones or antibiotics in their meats), and the location.  The Chick-n Shacks (100% all natural, cage free Deep Fried chicken breast sandwich w/ lettuce, pickles & herb mayo) are a little overrated, I'm not a huge fan but they were just ok as was their crinkle cut fries (just a side note, the fries could easily be shared as one order easily fed my husband, toddler son & myself w/ some leftover).  The fifty-fifty (iced tea w/ strawberry mint lemonade) was way yummy!  We ordered 2 ShakeBurgers, 2 Chick-n Shacks, Fries, 3 Drinks and received a complimentary cup of vanilla frozen custard in lieu of Mother's Day and spent ~$36, pretty darn good considering the quality ingredients used!  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good. I order the smoke burger. It's a decent size enough to fill you so you can drink more and I also go a fat Tuesday from the mgm hotel."}
{"text":"Food was great but I suggest getting there early because it was a long line to wait in although it did move pretty fast. The staff seemed a little grumpy but it was late in the day so I think you can expect that at any fast foodish places you go to. Otherwise I would visit Shake Shake again!!!"}
{"text":"For the price, the service is sub par! 2 quick questions.... 1. How do you forget to put bacon on a bacon cheeseburger (smoke shack)? 2. Why would you hand a customer the bacon afterwards and literally tell them to put the bacon on the burger their selves? I paid you $10 to do that for me!"}
{"text":"Burgers are great, though a little small. Fries very tasty, fifty-fifty ( lemonade and iced tea) great choice, and custom mixed chocolate and Carmel shake over the top delicious!

Beer and wine are options too!

Ordering is organized, quick, efficient, order to ready time is good. A little pricey for what you get. 

You won't see one of these competing with an In and Out or Fosters Freeze anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great new management - same great food to order. I love the new special bbq burger. Sold!!!"}
{"text":"Place was a disappointment. I order the smokehouse bacon burger and a fry. When I received my meal WOW!! They should advertise as a single slider.  I will take my business across the street to Fat-burger."}
{"text":"Excellent staff, great service and amazing burgers.  Don't pass this place up when you are out West,"}
{"text":"After not being able to get any shake shack in NY due to the long lines, finally one has opened up on the west coast! Coming from someone who doesn't like burgers, I love shake shack. The burgers are a little on the smaller side, but good beef, great bun burger and just the right amount of sauce. Also, the frozen custard is great. Definitely get some if you're in vegas!"}
{"text":"Way better than in n out. Super friendly service and great vegetarian option. They use better ingredients that dont have hormones & crap. Yeah the burgers are a little small but the quality of meat is much better than in n out. The only thing I wish that they offered is onions. Not even an option. I love raw onions on my burger. Their fries were good too. We got the loaded one with cheese, bacon & cherry peppers. The vegetarian burger was so good. Would eat here again"}
{"text":"First time here at the Shake Shack as recommended by my son who says that this is the In-N-Out Burger joint of the East Coast.  My overall experience was great as the menu wasn't overwhelming, but simple! The atmosphere was modern and overall appearance was clean.  Now with the food, I ordered the Shack Stack which has one beef patty and the fried portobello mushroom, cheese, and shack sauce.  I gotta say, it was juicy, crispy, and mouth watering on the first bite!!! Hands down, I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My first time at shake shake was a decent experience. I was expecting more of a restaurant experience when it definitely felt more like a fast food joint. Not that's anything wrong with that. The food was decent. I enjoyed the burger, I loved the bun it completely made the burger. Portions are a little small for the price. Not sure if I'd choose shack over in n out, although there completely different . But sure I'd eat another burger from shake shake"}
{"text":"Food and smoothies are great. When I went it was very crowded. I was with 4 other people. It took less then 15 mins to order and get our food."}
{"text":"I've been to the Shake Shack 3 times now, I wanted to give it a fair shake before I wrote a review.  I just don't get the big Hubbub over this place. My daughter has had the Hot Dog and it is okay.  I have had the hamburger and it is okay.  The fries were mediocre and in need of salt.  The Milkshakes did not impress us either. It's on the pricier side and seating can be an issue.  I would rather get a burger at another burger place for less money."}
{"text":"I love ice cream. I love shakes. When a restaurant has shakes so bad that I can't order one, apparently it makes me mad enough to tell them so.
We've been to Shake Shack twice. The first time we had hot dogs, fries, shakes. The vanilla one was warm (they did replace it), the strawberry one was completely unsatisfying as a strawberry shake experience (too sweet, not strawberry enough). Hot dogs were OK, fries were OK. Prices were very high for the quantity and quality of the meal.
We gave it a second try, this time burgers, fries, and NO shakes (one concrete though). When they rung us up, they were doing a charity fundraiser - donate $2 and get a free shake next time. I'm sorry, I skipped over the fundraiser, heard the word shake, and unloaded about how I couldn't order a shake because they were so bad.
The manager came out to talk as we were getting our meal. She was very nice, but honestly I was a bit embarrassed as I'm sure the other guests in line overheard me. It's good to hear they want to improve their product and they appreciate feedback. However, it was even more awkward as our burgers and fries were now getting cold.
As a second visit, this was make-it-or-break-it. It broke. Even with the coupons the manager gave us for next time, the food is just not great. The prices are way too high for the quantity and quality."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical of Shake Shack (yaaaay another burger place. uhhhh) but my wife kept insisting that we go and so (happy wife = happy life) we finally went. I've been to this location a few times now and I have to say they keep surprising me. From the first visit I loved the burgers - loved the fries - loved the shakes - loved the service. Boom! Nailed it. Why not five stars - because unless that shake (really small) was made by and fed to me by Jessica Alba and my wife didn't mind there is NOTHING that justifies the price. Steep! Definitely a trained chef's take on a burger menu and they are (despite the appearance) super-surprisingly filling. Well done."}
{"text":"Call it hype if you want but if anyone finds anything wrong with these burgers, your taste buds are either in need of a tune up or you just don't know what a good burger is. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.  I came here on opening day in hopes of being one of the first 100 in line to get a free hat but after lollygagging at home, I didn't get there until 10:30 and by then the line was wrapped around the building.  Despite the fact that we knew we wouldn't get a hat we wanted to eat because we knew what was in store for us. I've been to the NY and DC locations and when I found out that Charlotte would get the first Shake Shack in NC, I was ecstatic.  We met some really awesome people in line and ended up eating with them, being on NBC News Charlotte's facebook live broadcast and live tv broadcast.  How fun! Got my 15 minutes of fame. Ha!
Well after an hour and a half we made it into the doors and considering there were probably almost 200 people in line before us, it wasn't bad.  They had so many people working and they were ready! We (had my teenagers with me) ordered three single shack burgers and added onions on it for no extra charge, some fries and soft drinks with some Shack Sauce on the side. We sat outside on the spacious patio and despite how busy they were, there was still plenty of seating. We took pics and then dug in!  What can I say? Worth. The. Wait. 
Now, I'm not a big crinkle cut fry fan but since I've had them before, I knew what I was getting.  Everyone at our table loved their food and the manager even brought out a blueberry pie concrete dessert for us to try.  The pie is from Suarez Bakery and proceeds go to a local charity, Loaves and Fishes.  If you're not familiar with Shake Shack ask Uncle Google and he can lead you to Wikipedia or some other informative site and you can get the low down.
They also have chicken sandwiches, a meat free portabella burger, and other toppings include cherry peppers, Niman Ranch bacon, cheese lettuce, tomato, pickles, etc. Fries can be plain, cheese or bacon and cheese, hot dogs with fixings, and a chicken, apple and sage sausage. On the cool side they have milkshakes, floats, cups and cones and concretes. Drinks include lemonade, iced tea, root beer, fountain soda and assorted beer and wine.  
They even have something for dogs, yes dogs! Pooch-ini which is ShackBurger dog biscuits, peanut butter sauce and vanilla custard. Not intended for small dogs it says. It says to just let small dogs have a lick or two. Second on the doggie menu is Bag o' Bones which is 5 ShackBurger dog biscuits. There's a water bowl and a place to \"tie\" your pooch up while you go inside.  Not sure if they allow dogs in the patio area but only service dogs are allowed inside. I love dogs but I'm not a fan when places allow dogs in the eating areas. Most owners are considerate that not everyone loves dogs nor wants to eat with them but some just seem to be oblivious.
So that's it in a nutshell. They will be opening a location in the Blakeney Shopping Center and will be taking over half the space of Bravo which will be shutting down in a few days.  I'm really excited for that and this time I plan to be in line to be in the first 100. I'm ready to go back already. Dinner anyone?
That is all!"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype.. give me In n' Out any day. I didn't  care for the folded bun and the fries were just... meh. I probably won't come back here again with so many other great options so close. The east coast can keep Shake Shack."}
{"text":"I ate here awhile ago so things might be different, but I got the shack burger and was very happy with my decision. The fries were also good too. I don't really see the appeal here compared to going to In n Out for half to a third of the cost, but there was a lot of hype around it so I tried it out. It was more expensive than what I would expect for fast food, but to try this place as a one-time experience, it wasn't disappointing. They hand you a pager that rings when your order it ready for pickup. It's pretty crowded but it took about 10 minutes to move to the front of the line. It's worth trying out to see the hype, but don't expect it to blow you away. I'm still loyal to In n Out :)."}
{"text":"$25 for a greasy, overcooked lunch. On a bright note, if there is one, the manager seemed concerned about the hot pile of greasy garbage we were served. He both apologized and explained that poor quality food is very uncommon... however according to the gal next to us, whos food was also burnt and greasy, and the hundreds of reviews on Yelp and Facebook that say the food is burnt and greasy...it is apparently very common.

All I know is I wish I went to McDonalds"}
{"text":"Built into the front portion of NYNY casino and must enter via street level from outside. Large place, busy, fun atmosphere with plenty of big tv's. Ate their double burger with shack sauce .. Very good. Had the Shack-cago dog .. Really good .. Had cheese fries with beer cheese .. Unbelievably good .. And the custard (vanilla) was absolutely amazing.  Loved the atmosphere and fact I could buy a pint of ice cream to take home.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Food was good & reasonably priced. Atmosphere was like any other fast food joint. Staff was friendly & attentive. Hubby  & I decided to order 2 splits ( half bottles) of red wine to enjoy with our meal. Huge mistake! The wine rang up at $29 a bottle! At a fast food burger joint!!?? Needless to say, we nixed that. Instead, we shared one split. That's like $14.50 a glass. One can get a pretty nice glass of wine for ten bucks in some fine dining establishments. Shake Shack is on the wrong track if they think folks are gonna pay that kind of money to eat a burger & have a glass of wine while little rug rats run around the place. Not this girl."}
{"text":"I've got to say coming here was just amazing! I loved how they had different varieties of burgers and even there famous custard which I wanted to try! When I came here they had great customer service and the food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"My second time here at the Vegas location. I love the food, but I was very unhappy with the customer service. Monique, the cashier, mistakenly charged me for something and had to wait for a manager to void it. I told her \"sorry\" it could've been my fault, her response \"don't be sorry to me, be sorry to the people behind you\" , in a rude way. So I spoke to the manager, and all he said to me was \"ok, I'll go talk to her\". Without even saying sorry? I love this place and all, but if they have their employees talk to customers like that, I don't think it's very professional."}
{"text":"I heard great things about the SS but it wasn't all that great. Over price mediocre food, dirty tables. This location was over crowded too."}
{"text":"The food was ok. All ala cart and kind of pricey. Small portions.  Probably won't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love you, Shroom Burger.  Please let me have your baby.  God damn, it is so good - the fried mushroom, the tomato, the lettuce, the sauce, and that bun!   Holy $h!t, it should be illegal to taste this good."}
{"text":"love how I don't have to fly to NYC to get the SHACK STACK!!!"}
{"text":"Just like Culvers except not as good. Pricey because it's in Scottsdale. Went there for lunch on 3/29/16 got the smoked stack burger and a small shake and it was $13. Went with people from work all 4 of us had stomach issues and felt ill the rest of the day. Save yourself the trouble and go another trendy burger place in Scottsdale than this one. I can think of hundreds."}
{"text":"So good!! Highly recommend the smokeshack burger! It's delicious and the bacon fries are amazing! Love this place. Definitely need to come back!"}
{"text":"Really glad we stopped in. I decided to try the chicken sandwich and also went with a single burger just to say I had tried one. Both were really good, the chicken was one of the best chicken sandwiches I had ever had. The frozen desert menu looked great and I did sample a friend of mine's vanilla malt, it was outstanding. One friend had a burger that was undercooked, as they were very busy. The staff quickly made her a fresh sandwich that she totally enjoyed. The place was really busy, but the wait time did not seem unreasonable."}
{"text":"25+ minute wait in line that was almost around the block, $23 for two burgers, two fries and one drink. My burger was tasty but my dates was under cooked, the $3 per serving fries tasted like something you buy from your frozen food aisle for $2 a bag. No idea why it was so packed, I get better burgers/fries from Five Guys, In-N-Out and Islands."}
{"text":"Didn't realize the burgers were so small. It's as big as an English muffin. I got the smokeshack and it was only mediocre at best even w the bacon present :( I was so excited to try this place since so many people recommended it to me but I guess I was too hyped about it that it didn't meet my expectations. I think I rather hit up in n out to satisfy my burger cravings than this place. Much cheaper and better tasting. I might come back to try out their infamous fries that everyone raves about when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"On a trip up to the Phoenix airport, we took a short detour to the Shake Shack. We shared the \"Shack Stack\" which is a hamburger topped with a breaded, deep-fried portobello mushroom. It was wonderful. I'd never had a fried portobello mushroom, and it was perfect on a burger. The crinkle fries were delicious and we had the salted caramel concrete, which was very (overly) sweet and creamy. This little place was pricey, but really a treat if you want a special burger."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times & it's always worth the stop! The price is decent for the quality of food you get & the wait for your food is never long. I always make sure to get the Chicken Shack, which reminds me of a fancier Chick-Fil-A chicken sandwich. The food is so fresh but also super good! I would definitely recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"proud LA native and I'm gonna be real wit y'all... innout over Shake shack any damn day!! I swear I keep telling myself give it one more chance... and i always end up disappointed. anyways here's my review in a nutshell, it's double tha price of innout yet half tha amount of food. go figure. 
burgers? nothing special. 
fries? nothing special. you can buy these in tha frozen section over at smart-n-final or some shit
shakes? definitely nothing special and I'm not sure if they're even worth tha calorie intake. 

ps do us a favor and open up a halal guys here instead. thank me later."}
{"text":"Overpriced, food just good, air conditioning crappy, and a nose ringed gal taking our order. Not much to her commend."}
{"text":"My wife and I have lived here over a year and finally tried this place to see how it measured up! I've seen comparisons to In N Out and here's what I think.
I liked the burger,it was cooked perfectly and I like the fact that they obviously use beef with some fat in it which keeps it juicy! The crinkle cut fries are great! I got mine with melted cheese but recommend skipping the cheese,better without it! I also didn't like the \"Shack Sauce\" had a weird taste I couldn't figure out. I'd come here again but would skip the sauce and get plain fries! Shakes were great!
For those who want a comparison to In N Out, I'm from California and can say the Burgers are about equal with In N Out much cheaper but Shake Shack fries are MUCH BETTER than In N Out !!!"}
{"text":"For me its just one of those regular burger places to go. Too pricey for sliders. Nothing special really. I'd rather go to bachi burger or in & out."}
{"text":"Love In and Out! But, Shake Shack beat it! Love it! Can eat it everyday if I can!  I know they're now in CA but it's quite a drive. When we do go LV to visit family, we go at least twice and still get some to go to take back to CA. Never been disappointed every time we come back! Just LOVE it!"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and have been here a few times! Food is delicious. The last time we came here we unintentionally were difficult picky customers and Gabby was super helpful and sweet and we walked away saying wow, now that was customer service. Thank you so much, we will continue to visit!"}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich was fantastic but the nice lady serving the tables was even better. A sweet women gave our silly 3 year old some Shake Shack sweat bands and he was entertained for the rest of the meal!  I recommend!"}
{"text":"Finally a Shake Shack on the West coast!! I absolutely love Shack Shack and always make it a point to indulge in their yummy burger and cheese fries whenever I'm in NY. This Shake Shack joint located in the New York New York hotel and casino is very easy to find (right by their Brooklyn bridge outside). I had a late lunch here on a Thursday, so there was just a very short line and ample seatings. I know, pre-tty rare for any Shake Shack. Unlike the New York locations, this restaurant is very spacious with a big screen, great for sports fans. My go-to order is their single Shackburger with cheese fries. Best part, is the food taste exactly like the NY Shake Shacks. I did try their shake flavor of the week, which was caramel pretzel...it wasn't very good, too sweet for my liking. But that didn't take away my first West Coast Shake Shack experience. Can't wait for the West Hollywood location to open next yr!"}
{"text":"The price of the meal in the photo is $15.01, plus a $2.00 donation, which gives you a free shake. It includes one regular burger without cheese with onion, tomato and lettuce, one regular fries, no sauce, one order of a 'chicken hot dog' and one small non-sweet black tea, which they never asked me for a size preference. When I ordered the food I wanted to try something that had chicken in it and the hot dog was the only thing they have, which tasted pretty good in my opinion, it definitely doesn't taste like hot dog meat and more like chicken and not as salty as a regular hot dog. The burger meat was juicy and had the flavor you could expect, fresh onions, lettuce and tomato all in a firm bun. The fries, you'd expect to have been frozen since they're crinkle cut, taste better than what you would make at home from bagged crinkle at the grocery store. The quantity really doesn't justify the price in my opinion, and it is no comparison to IN-N-Out in price, because people comparing to them, which I can get 3 burgers and 2 fries for less than 12 dollars. However, the flavors are there, the fries didn't taste like they were frozen, ever, the patty was juicy and cooked well, all fresh ingredients. I will come back again one day to try out a burger with cheese, since I have to try it with cheese. The quality is there in my opinion and if you just want to try to just taste and not get a bellies full, then go to Shake Shack. The interior is beautiful, they play very good music, the colors are bright. My favorite part is the seats outside that give a view of the MGM hotel. All in all the place is beautiful in terms of the restaurant and the food but it comes at a price that is not similar to what you find at an IN-N-OUT, I don't fathom why people compare this to there because they are both completely different restaurant concepts."}
{"text":"Decided to go out of my way to find out what others have been raving about this place, even when I was pretty full. Tried the shackburger and boy, it didn't disappoint me at all! Service is fast, get the food at the counter when the buzzer goes off. The wait wasn't bad at all for me, maybe because I chose to go to this location instead of the 1 on the Strip and went there on off hours too."}
{"text":"Loved Summerlin's shake shack. We went when it wasn't busy. Bomb burgers and shakes! We could not get enough of this place, bummed there isn't a spot in Reno. Better than in n out for sure!"}
{"text":"The food was great! It all tasted so fresh! The BEST part was the service though.  Steven was FANTASTIC!!!! He made me feel like I was a guest in his home. He took great care of my family and myself. Thank you Steven!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are on a budget, then this place is fine. I order the chicken shack. The chicken was somewhat dry. I added tomatoes for free. It was decent but not great. The fries were stiff and felt like oven frozen fries. I think you can fine a better place for lunch than this place. Prices were not bad for Vegas. My husband had the Shack cago hot dog and he said the ingredients were good."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for a what it taste like a tegular burger. Custard way too sweet. I am better off to go to Freddy's nearby...unless you can affiord regular expensive burgers this place is for you. For the price I paid tonight, I could have gone to Bachi Burger!!"}
{"text":"The review below by Shederick M pretty much says it all. There is absolutely no reason to go out of your way to eat at shake shack, especially when the lines are as long as I had to wait in today. The food is fine, it's good... but it's not better than anywhere else that is cheaper with better and faster customer service. I waited for a total of 40 minutes from walking into the restaurant, ordering and then receiving my food. The single shakeburgers are so small it only took 30 seconds to consume. The raspberry ginger lemonade was unsweetened & sour. Im not sure if it was supposed to be served that way or it was an oversight? But I wasn't about to wait in line behind the other people with food complaints for another 15 minutes to find out. The \"Pie Oh My\" concrete with the Suarez bakery blueberry pie was the only thing I thought was unique and worth the money. 
Maybe it's because this place is new and the employees are still learning how to do their jobs correctly but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Tried this for the heck of it, looked good and was pleasantly surprised!!!!!! Juicy, tasty and the bread was great. Their toppings are super fresh too. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I don't really like going to places like this but I was starving hungry one day at the downtown summerlin mall so decided to go w a friend. I was worried it would be like smashburger but it was about 100x better than that. I got a shake and a burger and it was so fresh and delicious. The staff was wonderful, the place was clean, the wait was very reasonable, and the food was the best ever and I can't wait to go back and try all the custards"}
{"text":"We found this place in the directory  and at first I didn't know what to choose . So many things but no pictures and the staff was making us feel like we need it to order fast so I had a chicken sandwich and mint strawberry menonade .   I was happy with my choice , the lemonade was delicious . 

My in law and grandma order hotdogs and they  did liked it , the inside is so big and nice as well as clean . 
We would like to go there with more time and enjoy some shake ."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to give Shake Shack a try, and needless to say our first visit will probably be our last.  The burgers are way too expensive for what you get and were mostly on the dry side.  The service was below par as well.

My wife order a plain Shake Burger and I had the Smoke Shack, we also each ordered a fries, which are ordered ala carte, and a lemonade.  When our beeper went off indicating our order was ready, I went up to get it and saw that only one order of fries was ready.  The young girl behind the counter said our other was cooking and that someone would bring it out in about two minutes.  Her watch must work differently than mine, because two minute came and went and no fries.  We continued to share the one we did get while we ate and waited for the other fries.  Now we are sitting there with our food completely gone and still no fries.  The whole time the employees we laughing and joking around, just having a grand ol' time.  I finally got fed up and went to get a refund for the fries I never received and as I approached the counter the girl just brought them up.  At this point I just wanted a refund, which I got.

If you like over-priced and over rated burgers feel free to go, as for me.  I'll go elsewhere and spend less and get better."}
{"text":"Thos has become one of my fav places.  The food is always fresh, burgers are amazeballs and who could resist a delicious milkshake. Everytime I'm in Summerlin, I stop here."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin...I tried this place for the first time several months ago. I left very unimpressed. I visited again last night, with my husband; it was his first time. The burgers are so substandard that I just cannot figure out what the hype is all about. I have had better burgers at home. Also, there are at least 2 restaurants in Kierland that have much better burgers. Now, as for the crinkle fries....SO WHAT. SS didn't invent this, and you can buy frozen crinkle cut fries that are on par with SS's. I think replacing the nice-sized courtyard with this colossal \"tacky for upscale Kierland\" structure was a colossal mistake. Skip SS. Go to In & Out for a burger."}
{"text":"Every once in awhile i crave a burger and fries. So last night was one of those nights. So we went try shake shack for the first time. I had there signature burger, fries and chocolate milkshake.  Must say that i enjoyed all three very much and I will return."}
{"text":"This place is always poppin'. Customer service is great, food is eh considering the price for it. If you go here you have to order the fries and a vanilla shake.

I recommend ordering the shack stack, the mushroom within the burger is .

And if you're in Vegas during hot times, get yourself a vanilla shake cause gahdamnn that hit that spot"}
{"text":"Had a shack stack and cheese fries with a small lemonade. Came out to $18. I thought that was pretty expensive. So I started the meal off with a bad taste. But the burger quickly made up for it. It was pretty damn good. Cheese fries were ok. Should've just went with the regular fries. Staff was great. Restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burgers I've ever had. The fries are great as well, and the service is always extremely friendly. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hands down, the absolute BEST fast food burgers around. Always fresh, and cooked properly. You can tell they aren't frozen patties.  Normally very busy but always worth the wait. You can also now order ahead and skip the line with their app! Super exciting! Check them out, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Looking for a bargain? This place is not the place to go.  Looking for a tasty high quality burger in a casual setting?  Here it is!  I ordered the Shack Burger that comes with tomato, lettuce, and cheese which was just a little over $5.  Not bad for quality. The burger was juicy, not dry like the fast food joints.  We ordered the crinkle cut Yukon gold French fries, as well.  I have NEVER eaten crinkle cut fries that were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside without them being burnt. These were perfect!  They were perfectly salted--no ketchup needed.  I would return to the Shake Shack just for the fries. I'm not into shakes, but the family ordered a black and white shake that they said was thick and creamy and they loved it.  

An employee greeted everyone in line with a menu so that we could decide what we wanted before we got to the register.  That may have sped up the line so that we were not standing in the hot sun for long. The dining area was also quite clean and I didn't feel as if I needed to wipe the furniture before sitting down.  I would recommend you give this a shot when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love the Shake Shack, great burgers and fries!
Also dog friendly patio.  Order the Puccini and your dog will love you!"}
{"text":"All the hot dogs were delicious. Top quality meats, Chicago style. Our favorite was the most simple of the 3, the chicken apple sage. The crinkle cut fries were tasty and crispy.  the coffee shake  did not leave us wanting for more  coffee."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch the other day, and first impression was not great.  The counter guy that took our order had like no personality whatsoever.  And even though I was standing about 1 foot away from him when I ordered our food, he managed to screw up our order.  They have those beeper/buzzer things to tell you when your order is ready, and they messed that up too.  They beeped me, and tried to give me someone else's meal.  Eventually I got our food, and got it straightened out.  The food was actually really good.  Mine was a very tasty burger, no complaints at all about the taste or quality.  Fries were fine, too.  We ordered their current special shake, \"red velvet\" flavored, supposedly.  I would definitely SKIP that - as it had no discernible flavor of any kind.  Probably regular flavors are better.  Staff needs some more training, and they weren't really friendly, but my guess is it is a total drag to deal with tourists all day.  Locals - burgers are good, but not worth any special trip to the Strip."}
{"text":"Shake shack is not a bad place at all the visit. If you're on the road or just looking for a quick bite to eat they do a pretty good job. The restaurant was clean. The staff was really nice. I'll be back again to check out something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype at all. For months there was a perpetual buzz that Shake Shack was coming, and after seeing the long lines out the door in the first week, I assumed there must be something special about this place.  So I gave it a try tonight for the first time.  I just don't get it. The burgers were relatively small for the price, were greasy, and lacked much flavor.  (Especially disappointing was the mushroom burger, which was fried and was filled with a messy albeit utterly flavorless cheese-like substance.  At least the beef-based burgers vaguely resembled a hamburger taste.)   Likewise, the \"concrete\" shake was nothing to write home about--just a very expensive ($7) cup of ice cream with minimal add-in.  Even the service was lackluster; the entire wait staff with whom I came in contact lacked any smiles or charisma.  I assume all these people who were abuzz about this fast food place coming to Charlotte must have never eaten a really good burger (and/or must be from out of town). The old standby Rusty's Deli beats this place by a mile with their larger, tastier burgers.   Even other chains such as American Burger and Five Guys are superior.  Or if you want much higher class without a much higher price tag, head down a few blocks to Cafe Monte. That's just the tip of the iceburg--with Zack's, Brooks, Bang Bang, Bad Daddy's, Bedder Bedder & Moore, the list goes on.  I'm sorry, Shake Shack, but you don't even break into my top 20 in Charlotte.  I won't be back.  I couldn't help but notice the lines are already appreciably shorter than a week ago, as I think quite a few first-timers like I have now become last-timers."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, shake was very good, but I left wanting more.  This is the first time I've been to a Shake Shack so I didn't know what I to expect.  For the money,  this was just a snack."}
{"text":"We wanted to compare with in and out but we were already a quite full so just got a hot dog and chocolate shake. Will head back to try a burger soon! Great location and the interior, ordering system etc was all very impressive. 

We made a $2 donation with our order to support their charity and got a voucher for a free shake! Considering they are $5 a pop, that's a pretty great deal!

___________________

Came back tonight to try the burgers. We had a shack burger and a smoke shack - both single. And a side of fries to share. And our free shake for which we picked coffee

Wow. This is heaps better than in and out. The burgers were fresh, delicious and not too greasy (a bit of grease though!) 

Fries are excellent  and not oily at all. 

The coffee shake is the absolutely best!!! Heaps better than the chocolate we had earlier today

Not only is the decor and at up Heaps better than most places, we sat in a super comfortable booth watching the clippers game. Great fun."}
{"text":"This is like Burger King food broke !!! Run disgusting  they don't even have condemns  how do they even survive ? This place is wicked Ill will never eat there again! I'm still sick at the prices they charge for a BK burger yuk ! I still can't get it out my mouth"}
{"text":"all of their burgers are pretty good, but the smoke shack burger blew my mind. #1 burger of all time."}
{"text":"I tried the single ShackBurger, no cheese - the ShackSauce gives a slight kick. The burger was cooked just right and not too greasy.

Yummy crinkle cut fries!

I had the black and white shake. Creamy and delicious!  Vanilla custard mixed with hot fudge."}
{"text":"Frankly don't understand what the hype is all about.  Way overpriced for small portions and it really is not so great.  Every time I go to order there is some dud behind the counter with a hearing problem and/or a snotty attitude.   I need to repeat everything a minimum of 3 times until they get the order right.  The food takes a long time to come out (they give you a pager).  Don't waste your money.  In-N-Out has a tastier product for a lot less money."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality of food.  Not impressed.  Burgers were more like sliders and the shakes are nothing special.  $13 for a small burger and small shake, no fries included.  Dairy Queen across the street would have been a better option."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I personally am not a fan of hamburgers, but there is a vegetarian option for those like myself who prefer the taste. It's an amazing mushroom fried with gooey cheese!! Unbelievably amazing! The fries are crinkle-cut; they're delish. The shakes are super yummy as well, and they have many flavors to choose from. I got the chocolate peanut butter- yum! They also have hotdogs if those are your thing. Their loaded fries are great; I recommend those! 
I am nothing less than satisfied with every experience I've had here.

The ONLY negative, (and that's if we're getting nit-picky here) is that it is pretty expensive. For 2 people it's around $35-40 dollars, easily. For me, that's not the end of the world considering I don't come here often. It really is a treat when I get to stop by and eat here :-)"}
{"text":"This is currently my new crush!

We ordered a single hamburger ($4.29), a double hamburger ($6.59), 2x crinkle fries ($2.99 each), and a single Shack Attack custard ($4.59)... and then again the same order for take-away. #fattylife

The Shack operates as the storefront in front of New York New York hotel on the strip. I had bookmarked the joint for some time now because it's so hard to find cheap, good, quality food for under $10 in Vegas, but Shake Shack fit the bill.

They tout 100% all-natural Angus beef burgers. The patties were definitely hearty, no flimsiness here! The buns glowed with brioche-likeness and held up considerably well to all of the fresh toppings of crunchy lettuce, crisp slices of tomatoes, raw white onion rings, and brined cucumbers.

The Shack Attack is a chocolate lovers' dream; fudge sauce on chocolate custard on chocolate truffle and cookie dough, on Mast Brothers dark chocolate chunks, topped with chocolate sprinkles. *mic drop*

The room is airy and light, facing the new Park and T-Mobile arena. Squad up in their comfy, cushioned booths, dine outside on their picnic tables, people-watch on their high top bar tables, or just find a seat inside and chow down.

Dog lovers rejoice! This location offer a Bog o'Bones for $7.50 for 5 biscuits from Bocce's Bakery in NYC as well as a Pooch-ini $3.85, think sundae but with peanut butter sauce and topped with a dog biscuit."}
{"text":"Stopped in here looking to try the Shack stack one night.  This burger was different than anything I have had before.  If you love mushrooms and cheese on your burger than this is for you!"}
{"text":"Have to say I've warmed up to Shake Shack.
 The burgers are good and great crinkle fries.   Dog friendly place with awesome dog treats. This is how I rate my burger joints:
1 Smash Burger
2 Shake Shack
3 Habit Burger
4 In and Out
Some awesome burgers!"}
{"text":"The food is good but portions are small.  Something that separates them from Culver's or Freddie's is that portions are smaller,  they serve alcohol and dog treats.  Decor is upscale compared to similar frozen custard burger places.  Location is good for groups with big bench type booths and wide open indoor and outdoor seating.  The place is clean and staff friendly.  However for the quantity/size of food it's not worth going to this place over similar burger joints."}
{"text":"My first Shake Shack experience was in NYC in June 2014. I was extremely disappointed. There was nothing special about it and I did not understand why the line was out the door.  

I was definitely hesitant to have it again but my GF really wanted to come here when she heard it was in Vegas. 

I gotta say, the West Coast must make food better or something. The burger was absolutely delicious and corrected my first experience in NYC. I'm a California native and Shake Shack is definitely better than In N Out! 

I'll be coming back here whenever I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is overpriced with terrible customer service. First of all, the line. The line to get inside the place was long which understandable due to the rave of \"New York's famous Shake Shack\" but what was unnecessary was the lady yelling at the line that she was trying to do her job. Secondly, OVERPRICED. Ten bucks for a sandwich that includes a bun and a thin piece of patty. Totally not worth my time standing in the blazing sun for. Lastly upon retrieving my order, I realized my burger was missing the cheese. I clearly ordered their new bacon cheddar burger. And I assume that the cheddar should be oozing out of my burger but nope, that didn't happen. My boyfriend kindly ask the girl that was giving people their orders, if we could get our cheese. She gave a disgusted look, rolled her eyes, and rudely said \"it's not my problem.\" ... Are you serious? Did I really just pay $10 for a burger that clearly suppose to have cheese not come with cheese?! If I didn't want cheese, I would have ordered a regular burger. Eventually she gave us our cheese on the side and told us to put it in ourselves. 

Overall, no thank you. In-n-out ftw."}
{"text":"It's alright, never got the hype. I went 2 shake shacks one in NY and one in Las Vegas, though years apart. Food was ok here, can definitely tell it's a teir above the fast food joints like Burger King. 

Bad experiences with food: 

- Shack Attack Shake. Got this in NY. Wayy too chocolately. 
- Secret Sauce: tastes of pickles... I hate pickles. So this was definitely a personal thing, but ruined the burger for me. 

Other than that, the place in Vegas is nice and clean, helpful staff."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a while back and the food was horrible, one of the two pattys on my burger was completely raw in the center and when I went to take the burger back I was told they make them medium rare ugh no burgers are not suppose to be raw and bloody. I got a new burger with pattys fully cooked but the peppers on the top were ice cold causing the meat to get cold in the center. My friends food was also undercooked and she had already taken a few bites. The worst part is the pricing for the food, so much money for barely anything fries, burgers, and drinks are charged separately. I do not recommend going here at all."}
{"text":"First time eating here tonight. The wife and I both got a bacon cheeseburger with way too much gooey cheese on it. The burger was fine, the regular fries were better than the cheese fries (which also had too much cheese.) We didn't try any shakes on this visit, but will give it another shot to try them. The food was better than fast food, but is not as good as other \"shake and burger\" type places we've eaten."}
{"text":"Food was wayyyyyyyy over priced 
3 burger 2 Fry's 3 shakes 44.00 the burger was flat dry and cold the special sauce wasn't I can't believe I ate here being in Scottsdale Kierland I expected MORE 
I won't eat here again go to Carl's Jr. for a burger  
Don't waste your time or money"}
{"text":"Good food with great service! The mushroom burner is a must. Paired together with the \"loaded fries\" and cookies and cream shake, I couldn't ask for any other meal. Top it off with great a server with a smile, Audrie made this stop worth while. Thank you for making our visit to Shake Shack awesome!"}
{"text":"Shake shack is a great quality burger. I loved how it tasted like. However, the price was a bit higher than I expected.

I got a single shack burger with the fries and a red velvet shake. The sizes were really small! I had to pay about 16 dollars for this. I enjoyed the meal so I give it a 3 star.

I still like in n out better though. LMAO"}
{"text":"Eating the shack burger as I write this right now  and can I say the shake shack is whack .. don't know what people are talking about this is better than in n out ~ they must be high or drunk eating this . Portion is small bf finished his shack stack in less then 5 mins usually in n out he takes at lease 10 mins, it's overpriced and doesn't taste good at all ! Be warned going here or don't go with any expectations .."}
{"text":"I went here a couple of weeks after the opening. I was not sure what to expect, as I have seen the storied New York City lines, but we did not have to wait in line at all at 5:30 pm on a Sunday. All of the staff are very attentive and friendly, and the decor is clean and well appointed.

I do not quite understand the cult following of the french fries. They aren't bad, but they are about on par with Ore Ida frozen french fries. 

That said, we got the Shack-a-Palooza, and it did not disappoint. The custard is wonderful. The flavor of the week was Oatmeal Creme Pie, and it was by far the best. The waffles tasted like funnel cake, which was a bit odd, but the 9 scoops of ice cream definitely took me to my happy place. I will be back for more flavors of the week."}
{"text":"Clean facility, friendly staff, and some of the most reasonable prices on the Strip. Try the cheese fries for sure."}
{"text":"Very outstanding restaurant with fast and friendly service the line may seem long but it keeps moving!"}
{"text":"My wife and I go to this burger place at least once every time we go to Vegas. Some times there is a long wait with no seats available. What we typically do is my wife waits in line to place the order, and I wait around until a table frees up inside. Much like how I find parking in Vegas sometimes. There is outdoor seating as well. I have had the ShackBurger and hamburger. The meat is cooked perfectly and is juicy. As for the drink, you can't go wrong with the ShackMeister Ale. For dessert, coffee shake. There is a public restroom you can use. If you are craving for a good burger for the good value, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger ever! I was so happy to see this place as I thought I'd have to go back to NY to actually get one. This location didn't disappoint. I was able to get my Shack Burger and Caramel Shake craving satisfied! I tried the cheese fries, but to be honest, I think I like them plain so they stay crispy. It was hot outside but they have misters which made it nice. Our friends loved it so much, we went twice!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack is Shake Shack. Food is on point!! However it's a minus one star for cleanliness. Went there two nights in a row and always had to wipe down my table myself."}
{"text":"The food was good but a bit pricey. The line moved quickly which was great. If you like mint the strawberry lemonade was great! We enjoyed all of our burgers! For the cheese fries, we were
Split 2 and 2 on whether we liked them. We had 4 people and they put all the food on one tray. We ended up getting lots of napkins to lay down because the wrappers on the burgers are quite big enough to comfortably lay it down on the table. The burgers were smaller but they tasted great! I ordered a Shack Attack custard. The custard has great flavor! The only thing that bothered me about the custard what that you had really big chunks of dark chocolate that was really hard to eat cold mixed in with chunks of soft brownies. It was like gambling whether the bite would be soft and creamy or like rock hard. Overall we did enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I went here for the 1st time with my boys as I was a out-of-town guest on vacation, the shakes are AMAZING! I be back for sure, I need to try there juicy burger."}
{"text":"Got an eo from work so I decided to pop-in for a shake. It was my first time and didn't know what to expect. It was 2pm and my order was taken promptly and courteously. Once I received my order that's where things went wrong. At first glance the size of the shake was about 25% less than your normal fast food serving and at $5.30 a pop it was just an ordinary shake, no probably below average. It was very creamy but for me that wasn't a good thing. I like mine rich and thick. I understand being at New York New York I'm going to pay Strip Prices but I had to see what the hype was about."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town! Located in front of New york hotel. When you enter you stand in a long line but it does move fast. Menu is located on a wall in front of the line. Burgers are juicy and buns are soft. Prices are on the high end for a fast food burger.  Shakes were delicious!"}
{"text":"Sad to say that Shake Shack did not live up to what I thought it would be... expensive burgers, no cheese options (only American)... small shakes. Very little options, and big prices for small meals. 

UPDATE!
After my rocky experience at Shake Shack I was contacted by a manager and though I was hesitant to try it again I'm so glad I did! I loved my burger and shake and the manager did a great job handing the situation! 5 stars for the customer service! Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Loved the food and service. Fast, efficient, and accurate.  I saw them pump out orders like clock work!! Manager MICHAEL was so friendly, and very personable.  Seriously, service here was excellent.  It was a nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle of busy LV. 

If you see a man in a dress shirt and jeans with the name Michael, know you are in good hands!"}
{"text":"Simply the best cheeseburgers on the planet.  Please don't argue with me :) Wherever there is a Shake Shack, there will be a Cheat Day for me.  I love you Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Crispy chicken sandwich was fricken delicious! I will never forget the taste of the crispy buttermilk  deliciousness. Please come to San Diego!!"}
{"text":"Very good, but I don't think I'd say it is better than In N Out.

Comparison to other burger chains all comes down to taste.  I mentioned to my dad how much I love the fries at In N Out.  They taste fresh and not as fried.  He said he likes his fries super crispy, so he doesn't like it as much.  What I like about In N Out, he sees as a detriment.  I say this to say that I like In N Out more than Shake Shack, but I think everyone should try both to make their own comparison, because it is not obviously clear that one is better than the other.

I got the cheeseburger with the portabella mushroom on top, cheese fries, and the black and white milkshake.  Don't come here if you are starving.  It is super popular and although the line to pay goes by fast, you'll end up waiting forever for your food.

I didn't feel like the portabella mushroom added anything to the burger.  I can see how it makes a great sandwich on its own, but I wouldn't combine the two.  The cheese fries were delicious.  I loved the cheese.  The fries itself were ok, but again, I love In N Out fries more.  The milkshake was very good.

There is plenty of room to sit and eat.  I chose to sit outside at the bar overlooking people walking the Strip.

Overall, I would definitely suggest trying here once and seeing if this is your thing.  If it was between this and Fatburger, I'd eat here every time."}
{"text":"Guys, I think I'm addicted to the crinkly fries here at Shake Shack. With that confession out of the way, I must say I can totally understand what the hype about this place is, whereas I couldn't understand why people love In-and-Out so much. (separate review)

Within my 6 day stay in Vegas, I had two meals at Shake Shack. During the first visit, I tried the Shack Attack - It satisfied every craving at 1AM after just getting off the plane. The condiments table was surprisingly clean and organized, there was no mess to be seen as opposed to other fast food chains. 

My second visit was a bit underwhelming, which was why I did not rate them a 5 star. This is because I tried their hot dog instead of sticking with the burger. I think I had a better hot dog from a street vendor... but the crinkly fries kept me satisfied! 

I hope they expand to Canada one day!"}
{"text":"Good-enough burgers, but I don't get the hype.

I had read how Shake Shacks in N.Y. and L.A. often have lines of customers around the block. On the rainy Friday I went to the Shack here in Vegas, there were no lines but plenty of crowded tables, mostly filled with teenagers.

I got two Shackburgers and an order of fries to go, which I split with my husband at home. He liked the burgers more than I did. To me, they taste like a combination of In-N-Out and Steak and Shake. I love both of those burgers, but they are bigger and are more reasonably priced than the $5.39 burgers here. And I was not a fan of the doughy potato roll. But I do like the crinkle-cut fries here better than the ones at either of the aforementioned spots.

Maybe the \"Shake\" part is what drives the Shack's popularity. But I'm not a big shake fan, so I'll never know. And when it comes to burgers, I think I'll stick with the Double Double."}
{"text":"Fries an burger are great an all but the size of the burger is hella small ' I mean check it out for yourself, but if you don't mind paying 15$ for a burger , fries an drink then go for it'  I'd rather get a 3x3 fries an large drink at in n out for 8$ instead' plus they don't offer a drive thru"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the choc peanut butter shake with my burger! Cheese and bacon fried were tasty but sort of a small portion."}
{"text":"Food was great! The buns are soft and buttery, fries are crunchy and the shakes are smooth. Not too soft but not too hard to suck with a straw. Over all i give it a 11/10 and would most definitely come again!

P.S there's a pet menu"}
{"text":"One of the best fast food burgers I've ever eaten!! 

I've been to hundreds of burgers joints in my time, I tend to stick to the gourmet style places mainly but being in Vegas I needed to get my quick fix and shakeshack certainly gave me this. 

I ordered the original Shack burger with fries and a lemonade.. the burger was great! Cooked perfectly, the patty was a decent size and was soft and melted in the mouth.. the crinkle cut fries were great! I ordered extra Shack sauce on the side, the fries went great with this.. 

The lemonade was lovely!! I went for the Mango lemonade, it was quite tangy but was great! 

Prices were cheap! Service was quick and hassle free with a beeper! 

There's only one competitor for this place and that's In-n-Out burger.. nothing else can touch these fast food joints."}
{"text":"Born and raised in California we don't have shake shack, we have In-N-out so we wanted to see what the hype was all about.  

First off, I don't think these two place are comparable at all.  Don't get me wrong, they are both very good but in their own ways.  For example how can you compare fresh cut fries to the frozen crinkled cut?  It's obvious the frozen will be a lot more crispier and light as opposed to the fresh cut.  There is also a HUGE difference in price.  A double double at In-N-out runs less than $3.50 and a Shack Shack burger is $9.49...that's 3x more!  

We spent over $80 for a family of 4 which included the shack shack, shroom burger, shack burger, shackmeister dog, cheese fries, plain fries and three shakes. The food was fresh and a delicious and their bread was nice and soft but a little too soft for my preference.  Had they toasted it a little would have been perfect.  My family didn't think their cheese fries was anything special but their regular fries were nice and crispy.  

You will also be waiting awhile to order as the line starts from the outside of the restaurant. The staff are friendly, there are plenty of condiments to choose from and offer free refills on soda. There is indoor and outdoor seating available."}
{"text":"I've been to Shake Shack in NYC as well as on the strip at NYNY. I've always been a fan, though I won't say that it's better than In N Out. Apples and Oranges.
I went to this location shortly after they opened, and although the food was great the experience was a bit hectic due to all new staff (I suppose). Also, you will find a bit better beer selection at NYNY vs DT Summerlin."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is said to be the \"In-N-Out of the East\" and I can see how that can be, but In-N-Out will still be the preferred burger joint for me.

I got a Single Shack Burger, side of fries, and a Salted Caramel ice cream shake. Their fries are crinkle cut, just not my particular type of fry. The burger was okay, flavorful patty but I wasn't a fan of their Shake Shack sauce. The shake was good but really sweet; halfway through I was sick of it. 

It's a good fast food joint, but I have definitely had better burgers. Also their prices on their burgers and fries (which must be purchased separately) are a bit on the pricier side for a fast food place."}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW* Burgers are great.! Fresh ingredients. A little over priced then you would pay for fast food but it's completely worth it because of how fresh the ingredients they use are. Meat taste great, fresh lettuce and tomatoes.! I never feel horrible after having a burger and fries from here. 
Recommended items: SmokeShake Burger or Shake Shack burger on a Gluten-Free bun (for an extra dollar more) and the Cheese Fries. Burgers are small looking but definitely filling. \"Don't judge a book by its cover!\" Don't forget dessert; Shack Attack (frozen custard) it's a spot you have to try at least once."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I stopped by around 11:30AM on a Sunday and barely beat the lunch rush. 

We got the Shackburger and the Roadside burger (which may be seasonal? a new addition?), an order of cheese fries, and their Sin cider. 
+ The Shackburger was basically their classic cheeseburger, and I have to say, I think they do it much better than In-n-Out. 
+ Their Roadside burger was like a cheeseburger with caramelized onions and no veggies; it was okay but I definitely missed the produce. 
+ I love cheese so the cheese fries were a win in my book. 
+ Cider was okay, but was super carbonated IMO. I didn't eat much before lunch, so it definitely hit me a lot harder than it probably should have. 

Any service you got was limited to ordering at the cash register, getting a buzzer, and waiting for your order to be ready at the counter. Very friendly during my visit. 
The restaurant itself looked very modern, and had a mix of both outdoor and indoor seating. 
Bathroom was pretty small. I think there were like two stalls and only one sink. Clean enough.

On our way out, we noticed the line out the door, and was glad we grabbed an early lunch. It was nice that they were handing out tea samples while you waited though (Their peach green tea was pretty sweet though)!

Would come back again for sure. In the meantime, I'll keep praying for them to expand to the Bay sooner!"}
{"text":"-- 63/100 Reviews of 2016 --

Four Star Friday!!!!
I wasn't gonna wait til' a NY trip to try Shake Shack, so when I got the chance to visit, I definitely jumped on it. 

  Better than In-N-Out? It depends.  They do have a wider variety than your usual \"hamburger or cheeseburger- with or without onions\" menu, but to each their own. 
  My sister and I tried the Shroom Burger with crinkle fries. For some odd reason, we both had missed the \"vegetarian\" note on the menu and we were expecting a full on mushroom burger WITH a beef patty and then some, but we were surprised to notice within several bites in, that it was just breaded mushroom. A little confused? Yes. Disappointed? Yes. Did I hate it? No, it was actually quiet tasty. We were just in shock haha. The burger consisted of a crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce for $6.99. I loved the potato bun!  It was soft and yummy (oh, and non-GMO, as of last year!)  The crinkle fries were fried to a nice golden crisp, very enjoyable with peppered ketchup (try it!) - And since we were already indulging, we also had to order shakes.  After all, it IS called Shake Shack for a reason, right?   I decided to go with the Salted Caramel milkshake and my sister, a chocolate milkshake. YUMYUMYUM. The Salted Caramel was muy delicioso! Sweet, but the salt and caramel were both apparent. Dipping a fry or 10 also works wonders to the palate! The chocolate milk shake reminded me of a rich, dark Tablea (Filipino hot chocolate). Not too much a fan of, but my sister loved it! 

***Side note: Jay suggested to get the Stack Shack burger next time (Beef patty WITH the portobello mushrooms). Yes, I will definitely try that next time haha.

Pros: 
- Affordable prices
- Dog-friendly! Doggie Menu for your pup(s)
- Great location off the corner of New York New York Hotel & Casino
- Milkshakes are a must! (Bathroom-worthy for super lactose intolerant people like me :/ lol)
- Plenty of tables available (booths, long tables, patio tables, picnic tables, etc.)
- Plenty of TV's to catch the games
- Jay the busser was very personable & friendly compared to the cashiers

Cons:
- The employees need to smile more!!!

Overall, I couldn't really compare my Shroom burger to an In-n-Out burger because of the mushroom ordeal, but I still did have a pleasant experience and would return again when given a chance."}
{"text":"0 stars! Chelsea is a bitch! They refused to sell us a beer because it was 1 am and we are all sober! They lost out a huge sale and tip. They were so rude and don't even have vegan options! This place sucks. I do not recommend!!! And there was hair in our food! Gross!"}
{"text":"I would give it no stars if I could!   My daughter found a big nasty black hair in her cheeseburger, yuk!  She went to complain and all they did was give her two free tickets for two more cheeseburgers,  please I want more cheeseburgers with hair and it disgusting they should've offered a refund not to mention they were full of like butter or something greasy not good at all -  overrated for sure I will never go back"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Being a pescatarian, I was disappointing in the limited veggie/seafood choices that they had. (But Tiffany, this is a burger joint, what did you expect?) Fair enough, although McDonalds' has filet-o-fish. (How dare you compare Shake Shack to something like McDonalds'). Given that I wasn't smart and didn't look up my options before hand, I'm not docking points for not having more veggie/seafood options, but rather judging Shake Shack for the items that I did eat. And my review will be more for those don't/can't eat their usual burgers.

I came here on a Friday night around 6pm; there was a decent line, and the restaurant was pretty full. I like that there was a HUGE menu that you could read from anywhere in the line (unless, the line is out the door and around the block). I ordered regular fries and a strawberry mint lemonade, because I don't like mushrooms. One thing that I liked was the buzzers that they give you when you order. This means that you can wait at a table and chat with your friends instead of crowding around the pick up area. 

My food comes out pretty quickly considering how many customers there were. My friend ordered the mushroom burger, and because it was \"crisp-fried,\" it took a while to cook. I'm hesitant to say that I was quite disappointed in both of the items that I got. I feel like the shape of the fries affected the texture, so, the fries were not a hit in my book. The fries were on the soggier side as opposed to crunchy or crisp. The lemonade tasted watered down. I guess I expected something more sour or tart, but all I tasted as a slight hint of sweet lemonade.

I'm glad that I could say that I've tried it, but personally, I don't think I would come here. But I would recommend that other vegetarians/pescatarians who like mushrooms come try this place."}
{"text":"This place just doesn't do it for me. Ordered the Shroom Burger, couldn't get it without cheese. Bit into it and it all came squirting out, so hey guess that's all I could have asked for. It didn't help that it was $9 for a small grilled portobello with lettuce and tomato in a bun, that's just over priced. I could have eaten 3 of those easily.

It's got such a nice atmosphere and has a really nice patio area, but I really wish they had anything remotely healthy as an option, and came down on the price. I doubt that will happen, but I'm holding on to hope!"}
{"text":"This Shack burger was lame. It didn't meet the qualifications of a good hamburger. The burger looked like Swiss cheese with a couple bites taken out. The busser working told us that it was normal. I didn't feel like I received the value of a quality burger. I've had better burgers on the strip."}
{"text":"Super impressed with how delicious their burgers are! I seriously can't wait until the day I actually go to NYC one day and actually visit their original location. Idk what makes these burgers so special but I loved every bite I took from it. But I honestly think itwas their buns made the difference. They were so soft. Like biting into two yellow lookin clouds lol."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, especially since east coast friends rave about it. I will say it's a nice location, fries were good, and burger was decent. Might try it again and get the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"The line was moving quickly on a Wednesday lunch. Been here before and was waited a lot longer. Food was excellent, fresh, and yummy! Manager came to check on us to see how we were doing, and offered me a free 50/50 refill. Kudos"}
{"text":"Been to the original in Manhattan many times and LOVE IT. Was excited to see it in Vegas, and now moving to L.A. 

Burgers are high-quality and delicious... lots of options... custom made. My buddy had never been and really loved it too. Love their shakes made with frozen custard (not custard in the \"custard pie\" sense... soft serve ice creak with less air and higher butterfat content.) 

Really unique and there is good reason their stock is taking off on the NYSE!"}
{"text":"Burger was good, way over priced. Fries just as good as homemade crinkle cut fries. No need to go out of your way to eat here."}
{"text":"The burgers reminded me of those at Fat Burger. The fries with cheese are really good. The chicken sandwich was just ok. I like that the Vegas location had a decent selection of beers on tap. It's nearly impossible for places like the Shack to live up to their hype. Not a bad reasonably priced burger but I expected more."}
{"text":"About as close to the west coast as Shake shack will get for now! So while I was in Vegas of course I had to try the famous shack and compare it to our champ in n out and my favorite (habit burger). 

The design of this place can't be beat, it's very modern, super cool and trendy and has plenty of seating. 

The fries were solid. I love Crinkle fries, and dont understand why more people serve them. They were not amazing, but they were solid. 

I ordered a double hamburger with shack sauce. The shack sauce was great, the bun was fantastic, but the meat was just ok. It was missing something to be honest. This is where habit comes in, to me, habit burgers meat cannot be beat in the fast food world. It makes in n out look terrible. Well shake shack meat was not quite as good as habit, but maybe a step above in n out. 

The only thing that would maybe make me bring this 4 star down to a 3, (really my rating of this place is a 3.5) is because of the prices. It is more expensive than both in n out and habit by a lot. It cost me 13 bucks for a burger fries and small fountain drink. Just be prepared! Ether way, it's solid and a must but when in Vegas or NYC!"}
{"text":"Eh. Rude cashiers! First timer and cashiers kept rushing us to order. $6 shakes and there small size. Not to satisfy with the customer service!"}
{"text":"So good! Been to other locations but this was my first time to this one. Food was good and was ready pretty fast."}
{"text":"With so many Burger places popping up in Las Vegas you have a lot of choices on where you want to get your inner carnivore on.

I decided to stop by New York New York to check out Shake Shack.They have a nice ordering system, as you enter there is a large menu on the wall and several staff members to take your order. After ordering you're given a buzzer to let you know when the food is ready to pick up at the next counter.

Ordered a regular Smokeshack burger because dinner was getting close, but it was so hard not to just go for it and screw up dinner.
 
Loved loved the spiciness of the peppers, the freshness of the veggies and the great crunch from the pickles in my burger,what an excellent all around burger. 
I'm  definitely craving a Shake Shack burger right now as I write this review *Drools on keyboard *

Only wish now is that they open one in Hawaii!"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a \"hamburger & fries\" kind of girl, but I worked right across from the restaurant so thought I'd check it out. The prices are decent, good place for a casual lunch. Nothing fancy.  I enjoyed the cheese fries and they had a lot of flavors of shakes/frozen custards. The burgers were pretty good as well.  They have cheeseburgers, chicken burgers, and hot dogs. They do serve beer & wine also.  Overall, it was a-aight, not bad at all."}
{"text":"Scratching my head on all the people complaining about the price. This is a RESTAURANT, not a drive through like In-n-Out where you get your burger in 8 seconds. 

My wife and I went on Sunday afternoon. We got a cheeseburger, chicken sandwich, and shared a cheese fries. The total bill was $16 bucks. Seems like a value to me.

Both the burger and chicken sandwich were awesome and a good size. This is not like what you would get at In-n-Out where I can power down two double doubles without batting an eyelash. One double here would more than satisfy me here.

The beef was delicious and props to the girl at the counter who asked if we wanted pickle and onion on it... YES. The pickles are bomb and whoever does the buns should get a nice pat on the back. Perfect size and tooth to not fall apart with the juicy as hell burger and nice gooey cheese.

Chicken sandwich was spot on. I think Chick Filet has a great, simple chicken Sammy. This was just like that, but with a better, lighter, batter to it. Yum.

Last is the cheese fries. Hate to admit it, but I love some cheese fries with the standard runny \"nacho\" cheese. Prefer them that way. The cheese on these babies knocked my socks off. It had that gooeyness that I covet but the flavor far surpasses my wildest cheesy dreams. Such a nice refined chedar/irish cheddar flavor... I need this recipe because it would also make the perfect mac and cheese.

FIVE BIG STARS all the way for Shake Shack."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in the quality of the food here. The restaurant itself looks very modern, clean, and has trendy decor for a fast-food joint. I was hoping for a more upscale fast-food burger place. Chicken sandwich was over-fried (breading was dark brown) and soaked in grease. Chicken dog was blah, just a plain-looking dog on a bun, no frills, also no flavor. The hamburger was the best looking one of the three items we got, but was small and somewhat greasy. No special flavoring or pizzazz on the burger. It was ok. The only side available were fries, with or without cheese. They were the crinkle-cut ones you get frozen at the grocery store. I wish there was as much quality and variety in the food as there is in the custard, shakes, and drinks. I'd come back for frozen treats, not food. 
4 stars for desserts
2 stars for burgers
1/2 star for chicken sandwich and the fries"}
{"text":"$10.00 for this. Super disappointed in shake shack... I was told how good their food was. the fries tasted like del taco fries and grilled cheese tasted like jack in the box."}
{"text":"Got the chicken sandwich which tasted great but was a bit greasy ( it is deep fried after all)! My son got the double cheeseburger which looked amazing and he said it was great! He also got a chocolate shake that was so so! I will come back to get a burger - staff was great and atmosphere is nice.
Oh the fries are not that good!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack is the best burger chain in America and has their craft down to a science. Every experience at every location has been perfect and this one is no exception.

There burger is the pinnacle of what a smashed burger should be. The Shack Burger is my go to as it showcases the burger itself without any overpowering toppings. Today I tried the hot chicken for the first time, though, and it was pretty darned good too. 

The fries are basic but tasty and fried a deep golden. The concretes are some of my favorite and every visit there are new exciting offerings."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the burgers and fries. Too full for shakes we will have to try them another time."}
{"text":"Love shake shack.  Came here the first day they opened and have been coming back since. To reviewers complaining about having to wait....you're lucky it's only an hour. Some locations are way more.  Also those complaining about costs, you're getting SOMETHING BETTER THAN MCDONALDS. Seriously.  

Get the shack burger.   Skip the new bacon shackburger.  Any of the shakes are great.  Strawberry is my fave."}
{"text":"Burger was good. Loved the bun over In-N-Out's. Love the crinkle cut fries over In-N-Out's. Does anyone like In-N-Out and out fries? However, I have to say that when it comes to taste, In-N-Out's burgers win. When it comes to fries, Shake Shack wins.  Custard was good as well. Would I eat here again? Absolutely,  unless there was an In-N-Out close by."}
{"text":"Mehhh. Got a weird vibe from the crew, had issues trying to order online & were here like 30 minutes before we figured it out. Couldn't just have helped us. Burger was okay. Shake pretty good. Idk. Thanks though :)"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff....exceptional food. The burgers are amazing and the cheese fries were delicious!!"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. It's a good burger, it's not worth 6 dollars though. Super small portions with a price that is quite the opposite. I would look for another option next time I'm in the area. Burger, fries and a shake was about 17 bucks. Didn't feel like the right price point for such a small portion."}
{"text":"Have loved and been a customer for over  7 years. They are so friendly and the food is amazing. They have a semi exhibition kitchen and everything is always so clean. Great variety and willing to customize for you. Flavors are really fresh and fantastic!"}
{"text":"We walked across the strip, just because I've been wanting to try Shake Shack and make my own mind up about the In N Out comparisons. The food did not disappoint, it was amazing! I ordered the shack burger, and it was simple but delicious. I'm not quite sure what their sauce is, but it was perfect on the burger. The crinkle-cut fries were crispy and delicious. Is it better than In N Out? After trying for myself, I don't feel like you can compare the two. They are completely different styles of burgers, both delicious in their own rights. I will tell you that the fries are much better at Shake Shack. However, In N Out is a much better value. All I know is we will definitely be back again during our next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Over hyped and overrated. Im a New Yorker and have had the original burger once years ago but was much younger and my diet was poor then. So I remembered a great burger, but nostalgic memory failed me. The burger was ok, and the shake was good but the prices are not justifiable. In and out has a much better burger and bun. I found SS buns too sweet and flat which took away from the bite. I do appreciate quality meat but get everything else up to par. NOTHING we ate was worth the price. BOOOO SS."}
{"text":"When I use to travel to NYC a lot Shake Shack was always one of my stops. So I was excited to learn that they had opened in Las Vegas. I kept telling everyone that I was with how much they will love it and how excited I was to finally have a shroom burger again.

Well the excitement quickly wore off when I got my food. There was hardly any cheese in my shroom burger and it was slightly cold. It alsmot seemed like they forgot the cheese. I thought maybe it all need up at the bottom when I took my first bite but nope there was hardly anything on the bottom. The bacon cheese fries were ok they could have been better if they were warmer. They chocolate peppermint shake was amazing it taste just like a thin mint girl scout cookie. The shake was the best part of the meal. 

I guess I need to head to NYC cause this experience was not the best. Not sure I will be back to the Vegas location."}
{"text":"Food: unremarkable. The most off-putting part of Shake Shack is the value. Its way over-priced for what you get. Chocolate shake wasn't chocolaty, burger was weird.

The resturant is clean and new. Staff is developing a rhythm, only slightly disorganized."}
{"text":"We had the Chicken Shack and the Smoke Shack burger. Both were excellent.  The French fries were okay, nothing special.  We got 2 shakes, they tasted good but we're small for the price and they charged 50 cents for a whip cream topping.If I'm paying almost $6 for a shake it should be amazing not just good enough."}
{"text":"For vegetarians : shroom burger ! 

The burger is pretty small tho and the lines are so long because of the hype.

Just go in New York guys!!!!"}
{"text":"Best fast food I have ever had.  Just the plain old cheeseburger is amazing.  No need to add bacon or onions since it stands out on its own.  Fantastic patty with melted cheese, fresh toppings and a great potato bun.  Fries and shake were also good.  

Can't wait until they build one that is not on the most congested part of the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"It's Shake Shack, what more can be said? Great burger, and in-house pickles. Shake was delicious. Crispy fries.While on the strip, the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is very good. Line moves quick. Plenty of options. Burgers, dogs, chicken, shakes, you name it. It's a bit on the pricey side but it's good food. The red chili peppers they use in the burgers are great. 

We ordered the fries that are for 2-3 people, I believe they are called the Double Down Fries. Those were fantastic. It's fries, bacon that is nice and crispy, red chili peppers, and I'm pretty sure it has their shack sauce, or some kind of melted cheese. They were fantastic. Would go back just for those alone. 

Good food, plenty of seats, they sell good craft beers, but prices are high."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Shake Shack today for the first time based on the recommendation of a good friend. She did not disappoint! The burgers were great! They were cooked just right...juicy and the bacon was crispy! The crinkle fries with cheese sauce were super yummy! We are definitely passing on this recommendation!"}
{"text":"Great burger! Me and the fellas were out on a late night of drinking and came across this awesome spot. I managed to to snap a few pics before devouring it. Fries were great too, didn't try a shake but perhaps next time I'm in Sin City!"}
{"text":"Yayyyy!!!!  The Vegas location is open!!!  Now I can enjoy a favorite east coast burger spot a tad bit closer to home.  If I'm counting correctly, I will be the 113th review...a surprise considering they've already been in business close to 3 weeks.  However, NICE since the line wasn't absurdly long while we were there.  We only waited 15 minutes to order.  I'm sure by the time spring break comes around, that wait time will double, if not triple.  

A resident at the New York New York Hotel, Shake Shack sits right along the strip, so you won't miss it.  There is ample seating indoors and outdoors, with tables, communal tables, and there's even a little lounging area...impressive.  Its wide open space allows for several big screen tvs that play sports channels.  The vibe is very hip and casual.  

For my second visit at Shake Shack, I decided to try their Shack Stack...a breaded portobello mushroom burger atop a cheeseburger with that delicious bread that they use.  So good!  Of course I got the crinkle cut fries...yummy yum yum!  This time around, I tried dessert.  The shake...took a sip(s) of my hubby's caramel shake...not super sweet, just sweet enough.  I made sure I tried their frozen custard too.  They have weekly specials, along with their regular flavors of vanilla and chocolate.  I opted for the weekly special which was peanut butter banana.  Yes, highly recommended!!!!!!!!

Overall, I was a happy camper!!!!"}
{"text":"YO, this place definitely lives up to the hype.

Every time I'm in Vegas, I make it a mission to at least try this place one of the days I'm staying. This eye-pleasing modernized facility is home to one of the best burgers I've had in my entire life. I don't know what it is about the food here but you can't even compare this food to in-n-out because they're on too different levels.
The first time I came here, I got the double burger Shack and this past time I got the chicken shack, both were absolutely incredible. Also their shakes are to-die for. I always get the cinnamon dulce le leche shake. And then I dip my crinkle cut fries into my shake and all of the world is at peace. 
Service is kind of slow at times, but I can't even ask for a better burger because there's just nothing like it.
If you're new to the area and contemplating coming to this spot, I suggest coming thru because you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm the first to admit that as a vegetarian, going to any burger place is not ideal. But our last trip to Vegas we stopped in here and I grabbed some fries and the person behind the counter was super helpful when I asked about a dedicated fryer so this trip we figured we'd grab fries before leaving and get something bigger later.  I saw they had a mushroom burger and gluten-free bun. I was excited but as soon as I asked about how it's cooked as I have food allergies, I knew I was in for a bad experience.  She acted like it was a big hassle to answer my questions.  I told her my allergies she rolled her eyes and asked 'what do you eat' in a very condescending tone. At this point I said never mind and I'd just get the fries but she weirdly tried to sell me on the chicken burger (um the opposite of veg/wheat-free). I kept insisting on just getting the fries and she went to get the manager so I explained to him and he confirmed there wasn't anything else without wheat so I again said I would just get the fries. I don't know why this was so hard to comprehend but I had to walk away from this woman and it ended up putting a sour note on our trip."}
{"text":"I know I'm going to upset a lot of people, but I very much prefer Shake Shack over In n Out. Yes, it's a little expensive for fast food, but I think the quality is what wins me over. I can't explain it, but it tastes so much better. Maybe it's the potato bun, or maybe it's their secret sauce. I also like that there's variety in their menu. I probably wouldn't order anything else, but what if I wanted a hot dog one day? I could order it! 

Their fries on the other hand aren't any better than the ones at In n Out. They're just okay and a little better with cheese drizzled on top.

As for the service, the employees are friendly and there's always someone walking around cleaning the tables up and offering you water while you wait for your food. 

Shake Shack over In N Out any day!"}
{"text":"I had the shack burger, fries and a strawberry shake. The shack burger was delicious and it tasted fresh. The burger had a slice of lettuce and two thin slices of tomatoes. There was a little mayo with a hint of paprika in it. The fries were crinkle cut and had some saltiness to it. The strawberry shake was yummy and was easy to drink with a straw. I also had the smoke shack burger, which was spicy and had bacon in it. The restaurant was open to the outside and was very windy. Overall the service was great and the food was outstanding.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazingly refreshing fresh food with nice strip view! I would definitely recommend to anyone that will listen!"}
{"text":"First Shake Shack on the West Coast! After having Shake Shack in New York, I couldn't contain my excitement when I heard one was opening up in Vegas. So of course we had to be one of the first people to christen it. We showed up 1.5 hours before the official grand opening and were literally first in line haha. Instead of having us stand to the side in the cold, one of the staffers actually came out to greet us and then offered us some seating on the patio under the heaters. Great service even before the doors opened! 

As for the food, my go-to is the Shack Stack with red peppers - a cheeseburger topped with a deep fried cheese-stuffed portobello mushroom. Heaven on a bun! I also breathed a sigh of relief when I heard that the crinkle cut fries are here to stay instead of the natural cut fries. 

Let me be one first to welcome Shake Shack to the West Coast - hopefully the first of many!"}
{"text":"Best burger on the planet. Everything is literally perfect and melts in your mouth. I love this place so much words can't describe."}
{"text":"Was here 3months ago.Bad day..

THIS time best burger ever. Dbl smoke shack very flavorful, not greasy and good taste and flavor.Side of cheese fries the bomb...definitely will return Great job !"}
{"text":"The burger was good. Fries were good (remember to order them, a la carte menu). Shake wasn't very impressive (not much ice cream, machine style)"}
{"text":"Arrived on opening day!  Got in the monstrous line at 8:26.  Ordered at 9:01.  Food was served at 9:13.

The cashier was thoroughly trained on the register.  Not all the registers were open but I'm not sure if the kitchen could keep if they went any faster.  

There are two sets of smallish flat screens mounted on the upper wall of the dining room.  The patio was very large (they took Modern Steak's entire patio space looking out into the parking lot) and had a lot of larger capacity communal type seating (lots of benches, long tables, ring of seats around the fire pit).  The brand new wood-decorated interior was a perfect temperature when they had the front open to the patio.

The salted crinkle cut fries ($2.99) had a great texture, and are best when they are fresh and hot.  They become less crunchy and fluffy as they cool.

The chicken sandwich ($6.29) has a noticeable yet mild kick and a really great crunch.  The bun was toasted well.  The chicken was somewhat oily, but very juicy, and you can tell it is non-processed white meat.  Compared to Chick-fil-A, this chicken's crust was much crunchier, and the bun also had a better texture thanks to the toasting (CFA's sandwiches tend to be very \"soft\" though their seasoning is always spot-on.)

The black and white shake ($5.29) was incredible and actually tasted like the cookie's frosting.  I couldn't really place the chocolate flavor, but it was unique.  It was not too thick, but not watery either...just perfect.

Nitpicks: The ketchup dispensers were empty, but they had large plastic Heinz bottles out for customers to use.
 
It's quite loud inside due to the louder volume music and all the hard surfaces, and because it was very busy due to the opening day rush.

Their water comes from a self-serve dispenser on the condiment table, so there doesn't seem to be a way to get ice water.

They front the valet lot, but for parking I just used a parking garage and walked through the mall.

Overall: The employees are what push this to a 5.  I was surprised at how helpful and hospitable the employees cleaning up the dining room were, even offering to take my trash and throw it away for me.  Many employees made friendly small talk with customers, and a gentleman who I believe was the manager was on the floor.  This is also a great location for younger people, as it's more relaxed and quite a bit cheaper than Zinburger, while offering a more upscale (nicer decor, serving alcohol) atmosphere than Five Guys, The Habit, and Smashburger."}
{"text":"Sehr guter Burger, nicht besonders groß aber mit doppelt Fleisch definitiv ausreichend. Draft Bier ist mit 6-7 USD normal teuer. Atmosphäre leider wie im Schnellrestaurant. P/L gut, Empfehlung: Ja"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try the shake shack.  The food was good but, a bit expensive, but that is expected for Summerlin!   
What really blew me away was how super friendly the staff was! They all were awesome!"}
{"text":"50 min wait on day 3 of opening.  Worth it!  Chicken sandwich and butter cookie shake was over the top great!"}
{"text":"A shake shack on the west coast?!? WHATTT?!!

I've tried it back in NY years back and I've dreamt about their Shack Stack since then. Then I found out they've come to good 'ol viva Las Vegas! Dream. Come. True.

It's right at the end of the \"Brooklyn Bridge\" at the NY NY hotel. The wait isn't too bad. You'll be shocked at the people waiting but the line moves fast! 

For those who hasn't had the opportunity to try it back in the East Coast, they serve a variety of different cuisines from burgers, hot dogs, custards, and adult drinks. By far my favorite thing to get here is their Shack Stack. It's a burger stacked with a fried stuffed cheese portobello mushroom inside. Freaking amazing. It's seriously the best hangover cure ever. Order it with some custard shakes and cheese fries and it's freaking bomb.

My only gripe is that compared to In N Out, it's not fresh to made to order. You'll notice that there's a bunch of burgers pre-made under a heat lamp behind the counter. The freshness doesn't even come close to the burgers at In N Out. They do also have a secret sauce similar to In N Out called the shack sauce but I like In N Outs better. 

Definitely a must try at least once. You can then compare which coast is better. West coast is definitely the best coast!!"}
{"text":"Our first time at Shake Shack, and an awesome find during our Vegas trip! We walked about two miles from Treasure Island to the Hard Rock Cafe to buy a Christmas present, and I remembered about The Park nearby. We popped into Shake Shack and had a Shack-cago dog with tons of tasty pickles, a burger, fries, lemonade, and beer. This was probably the most reasonably priced meal we had in Vegas, haha! Even though it was prime lunch hour, we sat at a table and got to rest our feet, eat at a leisurely pace, and enjoy our meal in relative peace. Restroom was clean and the folks behind the counter were friendly and cheerful. Everything really hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this place and was very disappointed.. Food is overpriced.. Burgers are mediocre nothing special.. Fries had a greasy taste to then... Expected more based on the hype.. Felt like it's totally a tourist trap.. Habit Burger and In n Out are way better if you n the mood for a burger"}
{"text":"OMG I can't even. The line outside the door speaks volumes about how yum this place is. The burgers are delicious, but most people don't know what all the fuss is about because they order the wrong burger. Don't get me wrong, you can taste the quality of the ingredients but you MUST order the Shack Stack to experience Shake Shack's fullest potential. To complete the experience, the crinkle cut fries and a shake must be added to make this even more satisfying!

The breaded mushroom filled with cheese stuck inside the burger is absolute heaven. The cheese oozes out as you bite into it. The combination of what's inside compliments each other magically.

The crinkle cut fries are cooked to perfect and the shakes are thick and creamy. The person ahead of us recommended we didn't share the shake as we had planned (I wanted to cut calories) and we are glad we didn't. Once you have a sip, you are willingly committed to drinking the whole thing to completion.

Get in line already!"}
{"text":"I was expecting better food considering all the hype and the price tag for two meals ($25). In & out burger is just as good and half the price!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place since I tried it in New York so was happy that they opened one on the west coast. It's located at the front of the New York New York hotel and although it was packed inside, there was no line. I got the chicken sandwich and 50/50 drink. The sandwich was delicious. Great quick snack for when you're hungry and walking on the strip."}
{"text":"At first I thought dining here was a great idea. My feet we're tired, my belly empty, my mouth watering for some fries. Little did I know that this soon would all take a turn for the worse. I got a simple burger, some fries, and a chocolate shake. Grand total: $17! If you ask me that is way to much to ask for such simple food! In & Out serves you the same exact thing for probably half the cost! This isn't even the worst part! Approximately 5 minutes after eating, bisalo and I begin to experience stomachs cramps equivalent to a rotund child stomping on our guts. I'm not saying we were poisoned but we were poisoned. The only good part of this meal was the crincle cut fries."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner and loved it!!!! I had the Chicken sandwich with fries and it was very good!!!! Also nice and clean seating. The bathroom was also very clean and nice patio!:)"}
{"text":"This place was incredible!! The food was delicious!! We had a little wait for alittle while cause the line was out the door but it went fast! IN/OUT has competition if this burger place comes to CALI!! The fries are alittle normal just regular crinkle fries.   But still good!!!"}
{"text":"I was here the Sunday before Memorial Day and there was an employee outside the door to tell us they ran out of beef! How crazy! But to compensate, she gave us a $10 giftcard! So we ended up ordering the Chick'n Shack, double down fries, and regular fries. Also, because we ordered the Chick'n Shack, we were given free frozen custards. 

I've been to the West Hollywood location prior so I was glad to have tried the original Shackburger there and then the Chick'n Shack at this location. It was delicious! It comes with lettuce, pickles, and mayo. I'm not that into pickles but it was good and you can tell how fresh it is. 

Apparently they also ran out of the normal bowl or whatever they use for the double down fries so we ended up with 3 individual boats. The double down fries were alright. It got a little bit too cheesy. I hate crinkle cut fries, but their actual fries were amazing!! I can't stress enough how good and crispy it was! If I was in the area, I would definitely come back again just for the fries!"}
{"text":"Parked right in front of the restaurant (located at the former Boston Market corner area facing Central Ave) at 4:00 and had no wait to order at the counter.  The kitchen and cashier section are more cramped than the Fashion Square location.  All unoccupied tables were clean, including the plentiful picnic tables outside.  Water from the condiment table was chilled, and there were plenty of cups.  My small single-item order was completed within a few minutes.

Single 'Mallow Monsoon: Far superior to s frosty, and also better than a Dairy Queen blizzard.  The chocolate and vanilla custard are swirled but not completely blended, but the overall flavor leans strongly chocolate.  I could not really taste the marshmallow sauce.  The chocolate truffle cookie dough were super rich and reminded me of fudge brownie pieces.  The sugar cone cookie pieces had a fantastic crush, and provided a great contrasting texture.

Shake Shack may be cost a little more than its competitors, but their quality is a step above as well.  My concrete was $4.98 after tax."}
{"text":"This place is so over-rated that it's not even funny.  Food isn't much better than other burger places here in Vegas, and at least at the other spots, you don't have to wait a while to get your food.  This place should really look at their service team and get a clue how to handle customers correctly (I personally think Smashburger is better than this place)."}
{"text":"I had to join the bandwagon and try this place the minute I got to Vegas. It definitely didn't disappoint as I had gone twice in a row. I got the cheeseburger and fries both times. I love the quality of meat. I could definitely taste how fresh it was! Mine were cooked perfectly each time. The sauce and everything else that went with it were great as well. The bread was soft and reminded me of a Hawaiian Kings bun but not as sweet. The fries the first time I got them were REALLY salty. Not sure if it was the batch I got but the second time around, I asked for no salt and they were perfect! The quality of their fries were up to par on my fry game. I also tried their \"concrete\" which is their famous custard blended with a topping. I got the chocolate with cookie dough topping. It was very sweet (even for me) but hit the spot in the heat. I pretty much drank it as I took my order to go, haha. Still yummy and I would definitely try another on my next visit. They have flavors of the week so that's always a nice twist on things. My only thing about this place is that it is pricey (at least compared to in-n-out and other fast food joints) but you do pay for quality, the service is a hit or miss, and it gets super busy as the hype is real. A good spot to try if you're on the south side of the strip in NY NY!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype. Came here because I heard about how good this was! 

Portion sizes are just SO SMALL! Not justifiable when you're playing like $14 for a full meal and you aren't full! Their desserts are really good. Just keep in mind the concretes are like McDonald's value size but you're playing $5-6 for it. 

Also like their shakes. Their burger was good too - paid $8 for it but the size was also McDonald's mc chicken size. 

Nothing wrong with this place except the price..."}
{"text":"Packed & perfectly located for a Chicken Sandwich or Burger before or after an event in TMobile.  TMobile Arena believe it or not, has excellent food & way better than the Shake Shack.  (See my pix under TMobile Arena).  My Chicken Sandwich looked super appetizing & picture worthy only.  It was ok, nothing special.  

The PB Shake was great!  Love the shape of the plastic wine cup lol horrid wine, wouldn't expect better for a fast food spot.  Wonder if the new Henderson District location serves alcohol?  I really have no purpose to go back & find out, but FYI the one on the strip does serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Well...the shake was good. That's about all I can say good. The shack burger was very underwhelming & felt very cheap. For the burger & shake it was over $11.00. No fries either. The shake actually cost more then the shack burger. I will not return, when I left it felt like I just had a really crappy appetizer, the burger was soooooo small!!!
Don't waste your money here, go to In-N-Out Burger, you get better quality & more for your money."}
{"text":"In n out for LIFE!!! Sorry, not sorry. 

I've seen Shake Shack pictures everywhere for YEARS and always wondered what it tasted like, so my boyfriend and I were thrilled when we saw they were building one in Vegas. We ran over here on our first night for dinner - we were so excited. 

The line raps around to the door, but it moved pretty fast. It also gives you enough time to decide on what you want since the menu is pretty large. I decided on the shake stack and he got the smoke shack. We shared an order of fries. 

Shake stack: cheese stuffed deep fried mushroom stacked on top of a burger patty with lettuce, tomato, and shack sauce. I added white onions. Be very careful when eating this because the cheese is ridiculously hot and will ooze out! The mushroom was pretty salty and the patty was smaller than expected. I liked the texture of the bun but wished it was toasted (like at in n out). Not really sure what their sauce is - didn't have much flavor. Animal spread is better, just sayinnnn. 

Smoke shack: cheese burger with bacon. Pretty standard and self explanatory. 

The fries are crinkle cut, so they were nice and crispy. 

Their sodas are not self serve, so you have to ask for a refill, which is kinda a hassle - especially since they're busy. 

Overall, the food was decent but I think my expectations were too high. Their prices are also too high for how little food you get! Come on now, this IS fast food, but you're paying restaurant price. Smh! We were still hungry after this and went to Secret Pizza hahah.

Now that I've experienced it I probably wouldn't go out of my way to return. I'd say go if you've never had it and want to see what the hype is, but you'll probably be disappointed. 

Sticking to in n out! West coast is the best coast!"}
{"text":"This place has long lines. The French fries did have a crips to them which was tasty. They are crinkle cut fries. The burger was scuffed down in a matter of minutes (I may have been hungry). The burgers are a bit small. Last time I had the burger it was not that great more bland then any taste but this time it was pretty decent flavorful and juicy."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of great things about this place.... but it did not cut it for me. I guess I like my burgers thick and juicy. They meet the juicy aspect but they are not as thick. The buns are good but again it didn't wow me."}
{"text":"Cool space, shakes are great, crinkle cut fries were cold, chicken sandwich was good, burger average. $32 burger lunch for two. Not impressed very average."}
{"text":"We really liked Shake Shack! The food was great and the price was a real value. We each had a burger, fries and a shake and the bill was only $16! The crinkle cut fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The burgers were hot and juicy, and the shakes were delicious!"}
{"text":"Definitely a 5 star for the food. 
But a single burger with a real small pattie, order of fries and small shake $15.00? (made my $200.00 boots i just got from across the street (REI) seem more resonable i guess.)
I could have eaten at the Wynn (Slight exaggeration)
I only eat free range grass feed meats so this place is great BUT i think ill keep buying my own meats and cooking my own burgers while shopping on amazon at home. 
Gender Neutral Restrooms is a YELP option now? haha"}
{"text":"I tried going to Shake shack in Maryland early this year after finding it on yelp, and when we drove up it was still being built. Ugh! BUT I noticed that our hotel (NY-NY) had one connected to it and boom issue solved. 

I ordered the bacon cheeseburger. I forget the fancy name they had for it oops. But it was fantastic. Small burger, but perfect so I didn't overstuff myself. It was probably the best burger I've had in a longtime. Wish I had another one because it was that good!!! I also shared an order of cheese fries with the boyfriend and I wish I hadn't. I wanted all of the fries to myself! 

Don't forget to order a shake, duh! I got the strawberry and it was perfectly delicious! I want some now!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try shake shack and thought my first time would be in NY. But since they open one in Vegas, I had to stop by. 

The location is pretty large with indoor and outdoor seating. The line moves pretty quickly and the food comes out fairly quick as well. I ordered the shake stack which comes with the fried portabello mushroom and the meat patty. It was delicious!!! I loved the cheese stuffed portabello which added a nice crunch to the burger. I also got the cheese fries, which are crinkle cut fries topped with melty cheese. I actually really liked the fries, but the cheese tasted a little powdery to me. For dessert, I got the concrete, vanilla with chocolate toffee. My only complaint is that it's pretty small for the price. 

 I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Burger is a little small for the price. On the other hand, the fries and shake were worth every penny. Restaurant decor is modern which adds to the experience. This is my first review so I really have no clue what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Talk about a good burger. WOW. So delicious. Fresh, non greasy, juicy beef. Fries and milkshake were fantastic, I wish I had one of these in my area!"}
{"text":"East coasters love shake shack, but I don't see what the big deal is. It's nothing special! I'd rather get in-n-out. 

This shake shack is new. The line is a little long but snakes around and you get through it pretty quickly as you browse the large menu. The order is rung up quickly and you don't need to wait too long to get your food. There's a lot of seating inside, even for large groups of people. We sat in a circular booth with ten people. 

Food came out hot and fresh, we scarfed it down and then went along on our way to the next destination. The location is easy to find and many people still enjoy these burgers. I'll probably find myself back here again because other people like it."}
{"text":"2.11.17: The space was nice. I really like the self serve water area. There is definitely lots of space for everybody here. They got big long tables in the back. The front is a bit small compared to the rest of the restaurant. It can feel very tight if there's a lot of people in line. There was only 6 of us and I felt it was tight, no room to move at all. 

The lines were super quick, we ordered fries and a cheeseburger. They gave us buzzer and off we went to just go sit down. The buzzer system is way better than number calling, especially when it's busy and crowded. 

The food comes on a silver tray. The condiments are on the side as per usual fast food places. I wasn't hungry so I only took a bit and I thought it just tasted like hamburger. The patty is super duper flat. So it does have a  char taste. I'm not a fan as this style tastes dry to me. The fries are fries. Who doesn't love fries? 

They have custard ice cream, OOOHH YUM! Didn't try the custard but I heard it was okay. 

Ok for now."}
{"text":"First time trying Shake Shack. we definitely weren't disappointed. The shack is nice and clean. Customer service is really good there. 

My wife and i ordered the Shack Stack. We love mushrooms with burgers. 

our boys got the cheeseburger and the hot dog. with fries (crinklecut)

The burger was ONO (delicious)!!! the boys ate their lunches quick as well. 

shout out to Ray who was on point refilling our drinks without us asking. great customer service for him as well. 

we sill for sure be back."}
{"text":"Dope-ass burgers, yo.

Definitely one of the best fast-food burgers I've ever had. Eat your heart out In-N-Out. I was in Vegas for 3 days and I ate there twice and I'd have totally gone again, even though it was about a 30-40 minute walk from our hotel on the strip.

Cool vibe and delicious everything. The one criticism I have is that the menu isn't visible from the order counter. The menu is beside the queue where you wait to place your order, so you'd better decide what you want and remember it by the time you get to the front (remembering things in a, shall we say, compromised Vegas state of mind can be challenging at times).

The crinkle fries are delicious. I really liked them with the cheese on top. 

Highly recommended. It's quintessential Vegas over-indulgence, but at an affordable price in an approachable atmosphere. This should be on your must-visit list when in Vegas, especially if you live on the West coast!"}
{"text":"Gave this place a try. Food was good sized portion along with a serving of french fries. We got chicken sandwiches and fries. They have other items but the chicken looked good. The only concern was that the tables were kinda dirty and unkept."}
{"text":"There was so much hype about this burger place, but it was such a disappointment. I ordered the bacon cheddar shack and a side of fries. The burger and cheese lacked flavor. I had to douse my burger in ketchup to get some flavor. The bacon was good,but bacon is bacon.The fries were average. At around $13 for my burger,fries and iced tea I expected more flavor explosion on my tastebuds but this burger reminded me of a bacon cheese burger from Wendy's. The sad part is,Wendy's burgers actually have some sort of seasoning on them. I wouldn't come back here. I would choose In n Out or Five Guys over Shake Shack. I don't get the hype."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly...cheeseburgers and fries are so good!!  Kinda expensive for the size of burger, but worth it when you want a delicious burger."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about.  It's decent but way over-priced and way small portions.  I guess people are treating this like In-n-Out used to be.  At least Shake Shack has pretty good bacon on their burgers.  On the the hand In-n-Out is significantly less expensive.  Oh, I'd also say Shake Shack's cheese fries are better than In-n-Out fries, but I've always hated In-n-Out fries.  Over all, if find another place for burgers and fries before going back to Shake Shack.  Not worth the hype to me."}
{"text":"Small burgers, average taste. The shakes are good. Definitely not my first stop if I'm looking for a good burger, though."}
{"text":"Had heard a lot about this place and I'm happy to report it's as good as they all say. Usually these places are overhyped and ends with a disappointed me, but not here. Fiancé and I each got a Shack Burger with regular fries (gotta start with the classics on the first visit) and we also split the Shack-Cago dog (Chicago style hot dog... took us a minute to figure that out). The cheeseburgers were so good! Meat, buns, and veggies are all super fresh and juicy. Nice thick cuts of pickles, onions, and tomato so it's got a nice crunch factor. The fries are crinkly cut, thick and crispy, just how I like them. We could've passed on the hot dog. It had relish, onions, a long pickle spear and little baby chili peppers. I love me some original Chicago dogs from Chi-town, but this didn't really do it for me. We also got a chocolate shake, which we will pass on next time too. It's just a shake, no big deal. 

A lot of people compare this to In-n-Out, but it's like comparing apples to oranges. Yes, the're just cheeseburgers, but different IMO. My loyalty will always be with In-n-Out, but Shake Shack is a very close contender. Can't wait to come back. 

Tip: We got here on a Saturday right at 11 when they open and there was already a line outside the door. We were lucky enough to grab a table (one of us stayed in line while the other grabbed a table), but people after us weren't so lucky so make sure to get here early! 

Sorry no pictures. I was too hungry."}
{"text":"Personally, I don't see the comparison between Shake Shack and In-N-Out.  Maybe I'm just a pig but I have room to love both...just how I also love The Habit.  I personally didn't like the Shack burger, I thought it was a little bland but I did really love the Shroom Burger.  I came back for 2 of the shroom burgers all weekend.  I also loved that they had a root beer float, that's just doin' it right."}
{"text":"What's not to love here?!  I was in Las Vegas for just a couple more hours and walked across The Strip JUST for this since Shake Shake has not yet made its way to Washington State.

Being first-timers, we kept things simple with the classic Shack Burger, side of fries and a coffee shake. The Shack Burger embodied everything I could possibly ask for in a burger. The patty was juicy and the freshly-ground, natural beef made all the difference. Topped with colorful leafy lettuce, tomato and zesty Shack Sauce, it was delicious!  Pairing the burger with crispy crinkle fries and a creamy shake made for a satisfying lunch. 

The pricing here is a little higher than your typical fast food restaurant, but the quality is much better and it shows!  The service was also reasonably quick and friendly considering the lunch crowd at noon. We were about to bus our table, but one of the staff members gladly collected our tray for us instead - how considerate!

Located right next to the New York New York hotel, Shake Shack is a terrific lunch option along The Strip if you're looking for something quick and affordable. Treat yourself!"}
{"text":"My friends kept saying that this place is better than in-n-out. I didn't believe him at first, but i think I'm going to agree with him. The fries are soo good! also the burgers with the soft buns.
Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We gave it a few goes and it was my first time ever having Shake Shack so I was curious about all the hype. We went for lunch on opening day at work and the wait wasn't too bad. I got a cheeseburger, the crinkle cut fries and a soda. I went back later after the newness settled (ha!) a bit with my family and brought my puppy (dog friendly patio!).

First time food: delicious but not my favorite burger...maybe I'm just too west coast but I definitely prefer in'n'out FOR THR BURGER. The crinkle cut fries were to die for. Pretty expensive though for a lunch burger that you stand in line to order and pick up.

Second time: 3 cheeseburgers, crinkle cut fries, cheese fries, a shared black and white shake, a house draft ale, and on soda...$40+ but they brought us a sample poochini for Duke...his first soft serve experience and he was in love.

Service is incredible, everyone is so sweet and they are efficient with the daunting lines. The food is good...but expensive. And I definitely never need the cheese fries again. And to be honest, for a business with the word shake in the name...I wasn't overly impressed with the shake. 

Verdict: I'll go back from time to time because it's close to work and was good overall and I'm obsessed with crinkle cut fries. But I don't think it's going to be a must stop in my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"First time to eat at a Shake Shack...........I loved it and will eat there again, when in Las Vegas............not sure what it is they do to the meat, but it was oustanding, and the Buns were quite unique.........i liked it a lot!"}
{"text":"Glad I came but don't NEED to come back. Loved the fries and the burger was great but small. Good location but I won't be craving anything."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is delicious!!! I ordered the original cheeseburger which in my opinion was better than anything at In-n-out (yeah I said it)! The fries were great, crispy, and hot. I also ordered the chocolate cement mixer...yum! Took one star away because they have my friend buzzer 103 but she was 102...she waited 20 min for her meal."}
{"text":"Shake shack took me by surprise! I was on my lunch break and decided to go check them out because they're always super busy, BEST DECISION EVER!! It's sooooo good. My favorite burger is with cherry peppers. And , their 50/50 drink is so delicious. Along with the strawberry lemonade.  Best by far. Looking for a great burger place? Go there. You will leave full and satisfied"}
{"text":"So the chili dog made the biggest hit with our group  with the Chocolate peanut butter malt and fries. The guys had to go back for seconds on the chili dog. All the food is good but the chili dogs were a big hit. Thanks to our son Isaac for recommending this to us."}
{"text":"Based on reading the latest news coverage I was incredibly excited to try this. Utter and complete fail.

Went today (10/7/15) with a buddy, ordered 2 burgers and fries. His came correct, mine came plain (absolutely naked). Went back up front and they kindly remade it. When I finally bite in it was... blah. Poorly dressed (almost no sauce). Fries were unremarkable freezer type crinkle cut. Based on that it would get 2 stars. 

But about 3 hours later I got chills and nausea. Called my buddy and he said ... dude I think I'm sick, I feel warm and sick to my stomach. 

All we ate today was the burger so that's it. Nausea passed in about 5 hours but still queasy as I type this.  No chance I would give these people a second chance. 

Avoid, like the plauge... or you may get the plauge. :("}
{"text":"Man, I don't know if In-n-Out just has my heart, but this was my first time trying Shake Shack, and I don't know if it really lived up to any hype for me. 

I came with a group of friends after a long drive from LA. Upon looking at the vast menu options, I truly truly could not decide - so I decided to get the mushroom burger (trying to eat vegetarian / vegan these days). It comes with cheese stuffed inside the mushroom and is sandwiched between your usual burger condiments (tomato / lettuce / blah blah). 

The mushroom itself is deep fried - so the fact that I tried to go the healthier route and get the vegetarian option kind of back fired on me. The burger itself was oily from the fried breading and oily from the cheese oozing out of the mushroom - it was just a heavy oily meal that did not settle well in my tummy. For the price, it doesn't seem like it's worth in my opinion. The burgers here are about $7-10. I'm trying my best not to compare it to In n Out, but as a born and raised socal girl, I just cant help it and it just doesn't compare. 

I AM glad, though, that they did have a vegetarian option. (:"}
{"text":"Good place for a burger or shake. They now have gluten free buns as an option aside from protein style.

If you want something harder than a shake or root beer they have limited beer and wine selection."}
{"text":"The experience is great as far as service and location and interior style of the restaurant go but the food is extremely overhyped. Do yourself a favor and go to Bachi Burger, Holsteins, or In n Out instead. I honestly think Wendy's does it better. 
The best item I've had here are the cheese fries which were actually pretty great. The cheese sauce isn't appealing to the eye though.
Smokeshack burger was funky. It's basically a bacon cheeseburger with funky sauce and funky peppers on it. It might be pretty great without the sauce and peppers.
Chocolate shake was too bitter. Tasted more like a dark chocolate shake instead of a milk chocolate shake.
Probably won't come again anytime soon, too many great places to eat in Vegas"}
{"text":"Ah yes the coast to coast comparison between In-N-Out Burger and Shake Shack.

Having Californian allegiances, I have to go with In-N-Out but not by much. One win Shake Shack owns is a pretty decent beer selection. The ShackMeister Ale is actually a pretty legit amber brewski that pairs well with the burgers and fries. I appreciate the fresh lettuce and tomato on the namesake burger but the patty, while legit in its own right, is slightly less juicy than its Californian comparison. Still an overall decent burger though. Can't say the same about the fries unfortunately. This is where In-N-Out's fresh cut fries win. 

The service is quick and efficient and you'll be in and out in a relative jiffy. It could add up once you add lots of extras which can get you more elsewhere in Vegas but otherwise an all up decent fast-casual meal."}
{"text":"Verrrry expensive for my budget, but good food for my taste. I had the Smoke Shack with bacon cheddar fries. The chopped cherry peppers on the burger made it absolutely amazing. The bacon cheese fries looked similar to another big brand burger/hot dog joint, but just weren't quite as good. Regardless, they were still delicious and I was really impressed with the food. I typically judge a burger joint by their choice of pickles, and you gotta love the fresh light colored pickles versus the neon green fast food pickles. A+ on the pickle choice! Service was good, restaurant is nice and clean. Free fresh water from a self serve spicket. I had to choose water because my meal alone, sans drink, was about $14. Only knocking a star for price. We all know what it costs to make a burger and bacon cheese fries. I honestly don't think I'll go back unless I'm rollin in benjamins, but the food was definitely great."}
{"text":"was craving a fried chicken sandwich. and as i've eaten at shake shacks all over the world, they do deliver good overall quality. the food was a tad bit salty but that was not a surprise, but the chocolate malt was especially good. the last time i came in march--the lemonade and burgers were great.  (free refill on my lemonade!)

my main reason i wont be coming back to this location is the parking policy started in april 2016.  if you drove in, you have an hour of free parking--after that, it's $7 additional for whatever food you are trying to spend money on at the MGM hotels. now, for any food place, there's going to be a line or wait. the line at the shack shake takes at least 10-15 minutes. i found myself trying to nudge people along in the line--and the cashier's are not arrayed in a clearly visible manner off the main queue. it must be so frustrating for them to keep waving at distracted orderers. it's a lot of pressure to wait 15 minutes in line, then another 10-20 minutes for the food--and shake shack is about the farthest distance from the parking garage that could be imagined.  i ended up feeling like i had ran a sprint, waited, ate like crazy, and sprinted back to the car.  

i do admire that the employees there are fairly productive but quite nice to the customers. there was one annoying customer that kept asking for additional thing after her burger arrived--she had misunderstood that the regular burger (even though it says on the menu clearly) does not come with toppings. but the food distributor lady was very polite, even after several requests by the lady for this, that, then the other. she has quite the patience.

shake shack is solid. the employees work hard. but for the price and all the competition out there, it's not worth the stress of trying to complete a nice dining experience in under 60 minutes, esp with the parking garage a full 5 minute sprint away. i'll save my shake shack visits for other cities and, in las vegas, i'll stick with a place with free parking or 1.5 hours of validated parking..."}
{"text":"An upgraded In-N-Out Burger joint is all this is.  The food is okay.  There is nothing special about their shakes and is, in my opinion, overpriced.  As I mentioned, this is like In-N-out but with a nicer ambiance."}
{"text":"I would have to say this place is okay at best for me at least I had the burger and mushroom the fried mushroom with cheese in it was very overpowering that's all you can taste couldn't really taste the meat but them together was below average for a burger the fries were just ok kind of soggy also I had a lemonade not very good either they said it was fresh made I don't think so  service was grate explained what they where about I'll give them one more go"}
{"text":"This is the first time I had tried Shake shack visiting Vegas on vacation.  I heard they were established on the east coast and my husband loves burgers.  I got the mushroom burger which I loved made with fried portobello mushroom I believe.  It was different from the typical mushroom burgers I have eaten.  I loved their crinkle fries which was nice and crispy.  The decor is very nice and love the way they did the seating with booths, tables, and couches.  It was very crowded with people consistently coming in and looking for seating as people left.  Wish they had one where I lived.  Their size is similar to In and out burgers which is not huge and their prices were more (not sure if that was the norm of 6.00 or because it was on the Vegas strip).  The shake was good and I ordered the fifty / fifty (like Arnold Palmer with half lemonade and ice tea).  Overall, I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here while enjoying my stay at Red Rock resort across the street. I was looking forward to eating here since my last few visits to the strip. Very clean and nice atmosphere inside; too nice for a Habit and not quite a BJs. Lots of TV screens showing Nickelodeon and ESPN. The menu was plastered up against the wall. Lots and lots of options for those of you looking to be adventurous. Burgers, hot dogs, and shakes/custards, etc. I liked that they had beer on the menu. 

Made it a simple lunch, cheeseburger and fries smothered in cheese. Wife had cheeseburger and fries. Kids went with hot dogs and fries. Here's a tip for you just do one order of fries for two or three to share. By the way they are crinkle cut fries. I was not that impressed with the burger. It was good but not great. It was very puny as well. Reminded me of a white castle burger. The bread was really good. I had a few bites of the cheese fries and they were good. My kids were not impressed. They barely touched their hot dogs and fries. I enjoyed the beer and the atmosphere. I am probably a bit bias for in n out and the habit. 

Overall, I thought it was a bit overpriced for what it was. I may try again bit maybe go for a dessert. The staff was really great. Every staff member was courteous and greeted all the patrons with a smile. 

To each his own. I'm not completely sold on the shake shack yet. Give it a try. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I came here during my trip two times and I was staying at the New York New York hotel. I really liked it, I had the cheese fries, the seasonal milk shake and the chicken burger. It was about $15 which wasn't bad a lot of food for the money! For being on the strip it's a great deal. The location is in the park which is where the T-Mobile arena is. I will definitely come back again I think it's better than in n out burger!"}
{"text":"Don't understand all the hate for Shake Shack on Yelp... the burgers, fries and dogs are really good!  Freshest tasting food of any fast food burger chain!  

Love the shack-cago dog and the smoke shack burger.  Fries are fresh and delicious... haven't had a shake, but apparently they're pretty good too says my nephew. 

In-n-out got nothin on the Shack."}
{"text":"Really great hamburgers. Hotdogs.  French Fries. 
The food is excellent.  A little heavy on the onions. 
Chilli is awesome. Clean store. Clean restrooms. 
Friendly staff.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"First time. 

Ordered the chicken sandwich with fries.


The staff is really really energetic and nice 
The sandwich was small and a sub par bun but very well done. Juicy, good flavor. 

I got a side of BBQ sauce. It's darn good also.

Fries... not soggy but plain and definitely has room for improvement on flavor or style 

I would come back."}
{"text":"The Shack stack burger is amazing!! That mushroom makes it worth your visit.  We will come back to visit again before leaving Vegas.  The only complaint was the fries... they could have kept those.  Next time I will just get the burger.  It was hot and the atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Summerlin shake shack ... The burgers are a little small for $5.  Cool place though ... The crinkle fries were just ok .. The shakes that are custard are good and worth a try.  Cool place - the food was medium."}
{"text":"Taste: I really enjoyed the burgers here. The only reason why it doesn't get 5 stars is because In-n-Out will still always be the reigning champion on the west coast! I got the ShackBurger with pickles and onions, and their crinkle cut cheese fries. The burger was moist and the toppings were fresh, and you can just never go wrong with cheese fries. In addition, I have to say that the burger is actually visually appealing as well.

Service: Line seemed long, but every one was being served fairly quickly.

Value: Prices were good. The burger was $5.29 and the cheese fries were $3.99. 

Ambiance: Nicely designed. More \"upscale\" than your local In-n-Out for sure, but I would rather go to In-n-Out every time!"}
{"text":"Got to finally try their chicken shack which was okay, not better than chickfila IMO. Overall I love their burgers and fries. Can't go wrong with them. I'll be back to try their various concretes and hopefully I can catch their infamous corndogs."}
{"text":"I have now tried three different items on the menu and all of them were okay. During my first visit, I obviously ordered the shackburger which was super cute and tiny, a little bigger than my palm. The meat was thin and their sauce is pretty good, but nothing too crazy. On my second visit, I tried the chick n' shack which was also pretty good, but kind of reminded me of Chick Fil A, just a smaller version of it. This last time I tried the shack-cago dog which was honestly super bland. It was falling apart during every bite because the bread was too soft to hold everything up. Their crinkled fries are alright, but they reminded me of the frozen Ore-Ida fries my grandma makes for me. 

Overall, this place has a crazy hype, especially in California and the only reason I keep coming back is to take visitors from Los Angeles since we don't have too many locations there. It's worth a try just to say you've had it but there are better burger joints back home. If I end up coming here again I will be ordering one of their shakes!"}
{"text":"Me and the kids wanted to try the shake shack due to the hype. We loved the crinkle cut fries and even added cheese which I haven't had for many year since they closed Ed Debevics.  (Yes I'm a Phoenix native).  I am actually NOT a fan of In N Out burger due to the extremely small size of their patties. So, I wasn't that surprised when I realized that Shake Shack has small hamburger patties as well. I do like the very soft buttery hamburger buns. And I appreciate the self-serve water spout they offer because we do need water in this hot AZ weather and I appreciate being able to serve myself rather than ask for a cup of water. Just sayin'
In closing, I do like the shake shack and will be back but the pricing is a little much considering I could go to jack in the box and basically get the same thing probably for less money."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to eat here for the first time tonight. And it was really excellent. It was so good that we decided to order some food to go after we ate there. I placed an order and when I got up to the counter I had found out after a couple minutes that our order was given to another customer by accident. Edith and Jeff apologized right away then made us a new order and not only that Jeff came up to us and apologized again and gave us a refund of the total amount and also gave us 4 free coupons for a burger. I was completely impressed with their customer service and the way they handled it. Not only that, we didn't even complain or get the slight bit upset with the mix up and they still went above and beyond to honor customer service. Kudos to that crew there!! We will be back very soon!! Awesome job!!"}
{"text":"Overhyped & Not worth the Time & Money. The line was loooooooong (20 -25 ppl front of us)
WE Ordered the shack burger , caramel shake , fries. 
Price was ok. But the burger was not Good compared to BURGR, burger Bar ...
Meat brand & overcooked, bread dry. Fries are ok.  Shake was actually my Highlight. Was Really yummy. 
The Place was packed. So be prepared to wait a looooong Time."}
{"text":"Glad they open this location at the district . Burgers are awesome very clean restaurant!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING burger! Probably one of the best burgers I have ever eaten! I got the shake stack with the fried portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese. Words can't describe the awesomeness of this burger combination. The cheese was ooey gooey and sooo delicious. Cheese fries... super tasty and very rich, spectacular. I got the black and white shake, it was just ok, but hubby got the chocolate malt and that was fantastic. If you really want a rich, calorie-filled, splurge while visiting Las Vegas, this is definitely the place to visit. Little tip, if you want to just grab something super quick, like a shake and take it to go, there is a pickup window at the front of the restaurant so you don't have to wait in the long line."}
{"text":"This spot has got some great burgers... Didn't expect it to be this good but it was incredible! I can easily get addicted to this place and totally forget about the in n outs, smashburgers, and fatburgers around town. Freshly cooked (No phone orders) and tastes like no other burger in town. A must try if you are on the strip looking to eat a good quality burger. Shakes and sides are really good also but the burger here is the rock star!"}
{"text":"Classic burgers & fries ......& milkshakes too~

   Good burgers a perfect size not those huge things you can't get your mouth around. Good value for the money, friendly staff really can't go wrong @ Shake Shack"}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints you can hit while
In Vegas, (either on the strip or downtown Summerlin).  Yes it's fast food-ish, but made fresh and mass produced under hot lamps.
Excellent flavor and great fries, the malted shakes to die for."}
{"text":"Great food and good service. The Shackcago Dog was just perfect for me. And the shake was great. Crispy crinkle fries with not too much salt were tasty. Got there at 10:30 am and there was already a line. Once it opened the line moved pretty quickly. I'm local and will definitely go again."}
{"text":"$6 for a tiny cup of ice cream? C'mon... Might as well drive thru McDonald's and swing by walgreens on the way home and grab a tub of ice cream. Tastes good but way over priced."}
{"text":"Being in NY, in the absence of in-n-out... Shake Shack is the next best thing. OK haters... BRING IT ON! But my husband and I will ALWAYS have a soft spot for NY and Shake Shack (in NY). There is just something different about a shake shack in your own local spot. 

I was honestly teetering between \"A-OK\" or \"Yay! I'm a Fan!\"... but it came down to whether or not I was willing to endure the infamous LV strip traffic, driving through continuous construction around NY NY Hotel and Casino, then finding parking (or valet if you hate self-parking), walking through the NY-NY casino to the LV strip facing sector, and then finding Shake Shack itself! It may not be an obstacle for some individuals... but not for this little busy go-getting lady! That is a trek man!!! And this was with a husband who works two casinos down who knew the back-door ways!!! I cannot imagine if I didn't have a person to guide me through the crazy construction that was going on for the new courtyard area that MGM intl. is currently building out. 

As for the food: if you are comparing it to the East Coast Shake Shack, it will DEFINITELY NOT DISAPPOINT! It did not sacrifice it's east coast famous flavor by opening a west coast establishment. I would even risk saying that it is better! They offer alcohol too (which the East coast one we went to did not). 

Maybe I will feel differently after the construction is over... if it is EVER over on the LV strip..."}
{"text":"visited Vegas for a weekend and my friends and I wanted to give this place a try since we've been hearing about the hype. 

food: I ordered the smoke shack burger, fries, and a Coke. the burger itself was okay. I didn't realize that the burger doesn't come with lettuce and tomato until I received my food. I think the smoke shack burger is good, but not great. I think if they added lettuce and tomato it would've tasted better. it was too greasy/salty for my liking. yes, I'm aware that bacon can be salty but it was a little too much. the fries were golden and crispy. the shake shack sauce is good, but I like in n out better. I tried the milkshakes that my friends ordered and it was delicious~ I definitely wanna give it a try again when I'm back in Vegas. 

service: there was a bit of a wait when I went. it was a Sunday afternoon during lunch hour. ordering was easy. cashiers were nice and friendly. the only problem was finding a place to sit. there were no tables available for my party and I to eat, unless it was outside but it was cold. we had to wait for people to finish eating and ask if we can have their tables afterwards. 

price: decent, not bad. probably spent around $20 for two burgers, drinks, and fries."}
{"text":"If you want a burger slightly larger than a slider - this is your place. Got a cheese burger, fries, and shake and it cost $15.81- more than twice as much as in and out and not as filling."}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating here (10-26-2016) and I must say the food I had was absolutely delicious. I only ordered a hamburger with some shack sauce wit their crinkle cut fries. The meat was unlike any ordinary meat from other places I have eaten. It is a little pricey but then again you're on the strip. So it's kind of expected. Would definitely recommend this place to a friend"}
{"text":"Shake shack was gooder the shrumer on the burger made it doper it was frieder . The shrumer made the burger greater sauce mage burger"}
{"text":"Overhyped! I'm from SoCal, so no doubt I'll be comparing this to In-N-Out. I haven't tried this in New York but i had to this location twice already. The menu has too much going on. I tried the the Shroom Burger and Shack Burger. I was disappointed...The burger doesn't taste as fresh as it looks. Bun to party ratio is off. The burgers are small nor does it have the flavor you want to savor in your mouth. I never end up finishing my portion. I also don't get appeal of the crinkle fries. Reminds me of the frozen microwaveable fries. 

Not sure how this even compares to In-N-Out! Nothing was good and is overpriced."}
{"text":"The cost is waaaay too high for what you get.  Sure, the restaurant itself is clean and well-maintained with nice woods and finishes, but that shouldn't make the food cost double what it should.

The burgers do taste pretty good, with soft buns and fresh ingredients, but then so do the burgers at In-N-Out, which are less than half as expensive.  The spicy chicken shack is actually really tasty with a nice crispy exterior and juicy interior, but it's only available certain times of the year.  For all of the angst and debate that is associated with In-N-Out fries, the crinkle fries that are served here are nothing special either, and the optional cheese sauce (for a couple of dollars more) does nothing to change that fact.  

The shakes are expensive as well, but again the product is not commensurate with the money that is forked over to buy one.  

Fuddrucker's holds a slight edge over Shake Shack; In-N-Out is miles ahead."}
{"text":"After attending the Jingle Bell Silent Auction and winning a Gift Card here I took my friend out for dinner before our movie and it was not bad but I had high expectations to try this place and it was a quite disappointing. 

For $35 we both got fries, burgers, small soda fountain drinks and I also grabbed a \"bag of bones\" to take home to my pugs. The food was very low quality, my \"Shroom\" burger since I don't eat beef and it sounded delicious - tasted ok but it wasn't worth $7 by itself - maybe if the fries came with it. I technically also ordered the cheese fries just to try and the cheese was this weird melted American cheese with a bland taste to it. Nothing special to them and very boring. 

I officially don't see what the hype about this place is. Will I come back? Sure but is it worth the money being spent? who knows. Maybe I just went during a bad time or the staff is still new and learning but for $35 I was not satisfied.

I also am concerned with their cashier system. It took our cashier 5 minutes to figure out how to use my gift card and instead of asking someone else like her manager for help she just kept yelling at her screen and then finally showed us why she couldn't do her job correctly which made the entire 5 minutes just awkward. We also were the only ones who had to get up to get their food and then this one employee walked around the entire place passing me 3 times before finally realizing it was me to give me the bag of bones I had ordered a while back. Such an awkward time but I'll come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my teenage daughters.  They love this place. Pretty steady crowd coming and going. They enjoyed some hamburgers and fries and said it was great."}
{"text":"Beer floats! Seems to be about the size of an in and out burger with double the flavor."}
{"text":"Very bad service!!! And the price is overrated! The food is just so so. The fries were not crispy at all. I won't go there again!!! So disappointed..."}
{"text":"Located on the corner of New York New York, Shake Shack gets close to the real deal back in the Big Apple but ultimately falls short.

The lines aren't as long and out the door as the other locations I've visited in NY, Chicago, or Los Angeles so the wait to order wont be a slog. Additionally, service is very fast so you're sure to be in and out in no time. In regards to taste, the Shack Burger doesn't hold a candle to what we've had in Chicago, Los Angeles or New York. While it may look the same, well maybe a bit more sloppy, the taste wasn't there for me. Where the previous Shack Burgers I've had were juicy and flavorful, this locations Shack Burger was quite dry. The patties were misshaped and cooked well done. No amount of sauce of cheese could have saved it. Maybe the quick service isn't a good idea when you don't have the time to do some quality control. The fries were the same overpriced frozen crinkled fries.

Special to this location, they offer a Bacon Cheddar Shack Burger. This was definitely a winner with the cheddar cheese giving me flashes of Umami's truffle burger flavor. The bacon gave it a needed texture and smoky flavor to bring it all around. Its a bad day when your specialty burger tastes better than your \"iconic\" Shake Burger.

So is it a must try for anyone whose never had Shake Shack? For the Shack burger, I would say no. My friends are forever scarred by the dry Shack Burger and will refuse to ever eat another. I kid you not, he said he would rather have McDonalds than Shake Shack again. For the price you are paying, one would expect a burger that was put together with care, not a sloppy mess with a dry core."}
{"text":"Over rated mediocre food.  No wait at 1100 am wed morning.  Shake Burger and black and white shake for $12.  Burger was too oily.  Shake too sweet.  Thank god I live in CA with plenty of in and out where you get get a better version of the same items for about half the price.  Would not come back"}
{"text":"Unfortunately... i guess maybe this place was a bit overhyped. I was wondering why people were comparing to in-n-out or possibly smash burger. After hearing so many people trying it, finally had the chance to go last night during my friend's break while she was at work. 

This place sits on the NE corner of the NYNY casino on the outside with a HUGE bright sign. The location is pretty nice (despite the construction for the new arena). Almost hard to miss. Lots of seating inside and outside (though still not enough because its a strip location AND it was during dinner time). Upon ascending up a few steps of stairs and into the restaurant, a HUGE menu graces you upon entry showing their entire menu of food, sides, shakes, drinks, wine, champagne, and beer ! (though their \"drinks\" takes up more than 1/2 the menu Lol) 

Upon previously reviewing the menu during work and other times of boredom, i had decided to get the Shack Stack which consisted of their shack burger + mushroom burger. Standard Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce. Just because it was my first time, i decided to go all out with an order of cheese fries and a strawberry shake. 

My friend had ordered before i did and gotten his food first. He had ordered the SmokeShack which was a Single Cheeseburger topped with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and ShackSauce. Lets just say it looked a bit sad ... small... he commented \"at least the bun is soft\" then the ol jokes start flying XD 

When i had received my order, it looked much better, due to the help of the humongous fried portabello mushroom in the middle. Is it worth almost double the price compared to the normal burger? possibly. is it worth it by itself with comparison? maybe not. The burger overall, a little unsatisfying. Bun is indeed soft and delicious, but most surprising part is the fried portabello mushroom.... was it was stuffed with cheese o.O ! (so much for the previously mentioned \"research\" huh? lol...) The mushroom is filled with a melted muenster and cheddar cheese. Not overpowering but still flavorful and stringy cheese XD.  

Strawberry shake - nice and flavorful. tick but not too thick. able to drink with straw. Pretty good shake. Kind of small though for the price. Like a small cup size you'd get from any other joint. 

Cheese fries - depressing. Lol..... Crinkle cut fries covered with a cheese sauce that reminds me of nacho cheese. Menu says its super addicting.... not so much :( was hoping for something more amazing T_T sad face 

This meal costed $20 and some change. Holy crap. Prior to visit, i was expecting the burger to be bigger, or rather everything else to be slightly bigger and better. For $20, not worth it :( At least i can say i tried it? The shakes are good, and if i were to come again, id go for a shake and maybe try a hot dog (altho sams club hot dog for $1.50 is so much more appealing LOL)"}
{"text":"Visiting from Canada and came to T-Mobile arena to see the Imagine Dragons concert so we didn't know what was in the arena for food. Obviously we wanted to try something we couldn't get at home. Finally found this gem. We ordered the typical burger, the chicken sandwich, fries and their vanilla icecream. For being in an arena this food was delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed the quality beef and the chicken was also great. Fries and icecream were nothing fancy. But the sandwiches were great. Glad they had this option at the arena. Only problem I had was the service was a little weak, almost everyone's order was messed up, usually missing something. I had to go back for my drink cause they forgot that. But overall definitely worth it. Surprisingly not bad for price either."}
{"text":"The BEST thing about Shake Shack is the size of the burgers ! Not those huge things that we all eat, but regret as were takeoff the last couple bites....Shake Shack does offer multiple patty options, the single patty works BEST!! In my opinion ~  Their buns are soft and remind me of an Kings Hawaiian roll....which I LIKE, ALOT!! However you have to ask for pickles....ask for xtra Shack Sauce too!!!!
   The Crinkle fries are good! Not FAB, but good . Their shakes are good too! AGAIN not Gr8, but good and also come in a smaller size so your not SOOO bloated after eating~"}
{"text":"As fast food burgers on the Strip go~ this place is Da Bomb 
   Soooo MUCH BETTER than Bobby's Burger Palace~ 
    The Shake Shack has rich inviting decor with various tables sizes out of various types of materials and feels more like a restaurant than a drive in. And the decor is NOT MUSTARD YELLOW & CATSUP  RED!! Very pleasing greens & wood tones .
    The Shack Burger is a nice size too! Not those HUGE, OVERWHELMING side of beef burgers. You can order 1 or 2 patties, the bun was very good, not sweet like the Bachi Burgers (which I love!!) just a nice fresh deelish bun, fresh tomato & lettuce. Didn't come w/ mustard or Catsup but I added it after my first bite. The beef is hormone FREE, and cooked perfectly for my tastes 
   Didn't indulge in their French fries, however the choc shake was OOOH SOOO GOOD also!!!!
    If your around NY NY & want a burger STOP by, you'll be happy u did"}
{"text":"The fries were the best part of the meal. The burger was somewhat small but tasted decent. The chicken sandwich was very over cooked and did not taste great. I'd say the burger and fries are pretty good but too overpriced for the quality"}
{"text":"I love shake shack! Fast service! Quality food! The portobello is to die for! I wanna eat here everyday."}
{"text":"Yum!  Love this new hangout at downtown Summerlin.  The only thing I haven't really cared for was the French Fries...Five Guys is my place for those'"}
{"text":"Burger was terrible and dripping in grease, frys were very generic, milkshake was excellent but everything else was terrible, besides the food the staff was great"}
{"text":"Recommend to order with their app. Came here for lunch on a Friday, so the line was really long. Easy to use the app, pick a time for pick up and pay. When the order is ready will get a text. Go up to the take out counter and pick up order. Had the single shake shack burger and the cheese fries. The cheese sauce was on the side so I just used as dipping. The burger taste really good with all the pickle, cherry peppers and sliced onion. Toasted buns and the meat not over cooked."}
{"text":"Ehh. Really disappointing. The burgers were dry, they say they make them medium but they're so slim so it's between well and well done. I HONESTLY liked McDonald's more. Avoid next time."}
{"text":"Highly recommend shake shack, tried in on the strip a couple of months ago, fell in love with it, the smoke shack is amazing with the peppers on top. The fries are super good! Shakes are excellent! Prices are pretty fair, some say they are on the higher side, but I think the food is worth every penny"}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack, Fried chicken burger is definitely something to try!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack was cool. I feel like it is pretty limited on the options of burgers. The portion was quite small for the amount that I paid. I got the burger with the mushroom patty thing on top of it. It was fairly tasty.

I would come back for the shake and not the burger."}
{"text":"Fell in love with Shake Shack in ATX @ Spotify House during SXSW. Best burger I've ever had, period, however, this location didn't nail it. Must be that our cattle in TX are better quality then they can get out here in the desert."}
{"text":"First time at a Shake Shack, and it literally left a bad taste in my mouth. I ordered a portobello burger with melted muenster and cheddar cheese. When I bit into it, it made a swish sound, and the cheese literally exploded into my mouth, and oozed onto the tray. It felt like I emptied a cheese whiz can. It tasted even worse than cheese whiz. The order takers did not seem like they wanted to be there, and the manager did not set a good example. He stood behind the counter tapping his hands on counter, and twirling the box the holds the buzzers, like he was totally bored.

Also, I am allergic to tomatoes so I asked was was in your shack sauce and no one knew if it was tomatoes based. The only reason I gave 2 stars was the person that took my order, came over while we were eating to see if everything was ok. 


I will not return, to much competition in the area to spend my money there.
Better off at In and Out"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out because I heard the burgers were awesome. I had the shack burger?? It was delicious,  very tasty. Everyone enjoyed their burgers. Decent prices,  free refills on drinks. My only gripe was that some tables near the windows are too cramped together, hard to sit and eat."}
{"text":"Great quality burgers for the price. Nice atmosphere & addition to the area. Friendly staff & be prepared to wait to place order & Confirm your order when ready to pick up at counter because staff is still new.. . Tried the burgers and hotdog, beer, milkshake and fries. The food portions are small so you can't share if your hungry. Def a must try & will return."}
{"text":"First timer and their line is quick. I ordered the chick'N'shack. It was really good crispy chicken but I am just sad that for the price I paid it was so little!!! It almost looked like a slider size & I was still pretty hungry afterwards. I'm sure my 8 year old nephew would also complain. Not a big fan of their style of fries either, too hard. 

Great chicken sandwich, may return.."}
{"text":"First time having shake shack and it blew my mind! Anyone who says INN n out is better, is lying through they teef!

I'm going back to Vegas just for shake shack, not even kidding. 

5/5 Original burger 
5/5 BBQ burger
1/5 the jackpot , the cake tasted extremely stale
3/5 cheese fries"}
{"text":"They burgers are ok but not the best. The patty was too burnt for me and the fries looked like the zigzag Costco fries. I tried the portobello mushroom burger too but it was too deep fried and greasy for me. Not trying to bash this place but I think I'll go to in n out instead next time."}
{"text":"Good food for the family if you are looking for a quick meal while walking on the step with getting a reservation and waiting 2 hours for food. Clean place with good food."}
{"text":"Shake shack was amazing. I loved the potato bun, I loved the cranberry ginger lemonade. If you have time to go you should go."}
{"text":"If you like burgers and shakes you'll enjoy shake shack. I love their coffee shake. The fries are okay, but my husband doesn't like skinny fries."}
{"text":"I reserve the rite to modify at a future date, but the initial impression, on a Saturday afternoon a couple of weeks after opening...was pretty good.  There are a few things to keep in mind.
1) You will wait in line to order
2) People seem to crowed the pick-up window, even when their buzzer has not gone off, so you have to fight through the crowed.  Not a company problem, they cashier does tell you to find a seat until the buzzer goes off.
3) People seemed to be sitting and enjoying the day after they were done eating.  Like I said, there is a line.  So this is not a place to sit and chat, it is eat and move on so the next person can sit.
4) Restrooms serve one person at a time.  The mens room could have three or four facilities, but they only have one.  Remember the waiting in line?  Applies here to.

Food - The price is a little more then 5G, but I personally liked the burgers more.  They had great flavor.  The look a little small initially, but they were extremely filling.  We also had the BBQ Bacon cheese fries, because who does not like a heart attack at some point.  These are crinkle fries, which I usually don't like, but these were fantastic.  The cheese is not gloppy nacho cheese but a store made sauce.  The bacon is real bacon crumbled on top.  The BBQ sauce is their home sauce just lightly drizzled.

I believe they have beer as well.  Their soda is coke product."}
{"text":"Very good basic burger. Fresh ingredients and meat cooked to perfection. Just an all around great burger. 

I got the bacon cheese fries to mix things up and they were very good as well. 

And of course, the chocolate peanut butter with marshmallow creme was outstanding"}
{"text":"Finally got to see what the hype is about. Its pretty damn good. Although i could probably chalk it up partly due to its exclusivity to the east coast. Kinda like In and Out in the west.

Ordered a Shake Shack original, plus crinkle fries. Meat was a perfect medium and very juicy. You can actually see the meat, unlike In N Out with its skinny patties. Buns are nice and soft, cheese nicely melted. Fries are winners. Crinkle cut and super crispy, its my favorite.

I think I still like Five guys over this, but def SS is better than In N Out. 

Bring your patience because there is a looooong line. A plenty of people. And to the fatty that demanded i say excuse me to her because i \"bumped into\" her.... you were saving a seat and calling your other fatty friends. I manuevered around you with a full tray of food with me. You decided to spin around and i literally felt your elbow make more contact with me just to make it more dramatic. Whose fault? If you didnt move into my path, all would be well and you would be scarfing down your burger when you clearly shouldnt be. Have a good day, maam."}
{"text":"Usually don't try places that are three stars, but have been curious about this one. Went for dessert and had a root beer float and black & white shake. Thought it was going to be Oreo, but it was vanilla custard with fudge sauce mixed in. Tasted the chocolate custard and wasn't a fan. It was more like chocolate Italian ice, which is probably the only chocolate thing I don't like. Shake and float were okay. Nothing to write home about. Staff was friendly, though, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Today was my first time ever visiting a Shake Shack. I don't really have any complaints. I thought the prices were average and the food was just average in my opinion. I had a Shackburger and the sauce was good, but only reminds me of the sauce they put on Big Macs at McDonald's. Nothing special."}
{"text":"The line was long but it moved fast. I got my food in an acceptable amount of time. I just got a burger and it was on point. When I bit into it, it reminded me of the taste of a great homemade burger. Simple and tasty. I wanna try the fries and custard next time I go."}
{"text":"Pre-ordered and paid via the app. 45mins later after arriving they still can't find my order. 

Crazy busy with long lines so be prepared to wait. 

Luckily the burgers are good. The griddled chicken burger is tasty and filling. Homemade lemonade is just perfect on a hot day."}
{"text":"Really tasty burgers, definitely better than 5 guys imho, love the crinkle cut fries, good beer on tap, we both got the smokeshack, loved the hot cherry peppers. Will def be back!"}
{"text":"SHAKE SHACK IS AMAZING. 

Quality food, great price and cheese fries! Yay! We were so excited to find out that it was coming to Phoenix and the food is the same as when we had it in D.C. 

The black and white shake with a Chicago dog and cheese fries are my favorite. Oh! Chicken sandwich, TRY IT! Absolutely scrumptious."}
{"text":"Finally got to try shake shack!! The location in downtown Summerlin is nice and spacious, has indoor and outdoor seating. 

Food wise they primarily serve burgers, hotdogs and fries. My kids ordered shack burger, which is your basic cheeseburger but made extra special with shack sauce. Now the sauce is  on the spicier side and my kids are not like me with heat, so was a bit much for them. You can't help but compare their burger with In N Out and of course, we agreed that In N Out is better. 

I wanted to try a veggie burger but their only choice was portobello burger. I prefer veggie patty so didn't try their veggie burger. 

The cheese fries were good but for the price I felt the portion was small and nothing to wow me. 
They also serve beer and wine which I thought was pricy, $7.99 for white and $8.99 for red, I am sorry but that's a bit much for fast food wine. 

We tried their featured marshmallow chocolate chip shake ($5.29) which was awesome but it has a whopping 1000+ calories!!! I am thankful when restaurants mention calories on the menu, what an eye opener! 

They are dog friendly and even have a menu for your four legged friends :)"}
{"text":"Really good fast food burger - would rate it alongside In N Out and Five Guys. That is to say- yes its fast food, but it doesnt look like the crap you get at Carls jr where the burger always looks stepped on when its served and is freshly made vs baking under a heat lamp."}
{"text":"I wasn't entirely too impressed with this restaurant but their service was outstanding and the establishment was very neat and clean. The lady made sure we didn't need anything, and also gave us complimentary shakes for the next time we visited. Next time, if i go back, I will just get a single burger and add condiments. I tried the SmokeShack burger and wasn't completely elated. The only reason i am going back is because my experience as great and i will try another burger next time!"}
{"text":"Delicious. the food here does not disappoint...

Staff was very attentive.

Location is in a big outdoor shopping mall which is a little difficult to find, especially if you arenot familiar with the area, but not impossible.

Bathroom could be a little more kept. For a fairly new location, they should have the cleanliness of the restroom as a top priority. ?"}
{"text":"Wow! Just had Shake Shack for the first time and I have never enjoyed a Burger as much as I did  here. I had the Shack Stack burger which comes with a giant breaded and lightly fried portable lo mushroom with cheddar and munster cheeses. Holy smokes what a combo. Blew me away. The only downfall was the location. We had a very hard time finding the place because the way the Summerlin shopping center layer out. I suppose if you use a delivery option that won't matter but, now that I know where it is good luck keeping me out of there. Fantastic burger."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is always something we look forward to every time we visit Vegas. Have tried most of the items on the menu but I always come back to the basic single shackburger- so tasty! Definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"So, I finally went.  They've been open long enough to have worked out any kinks.

The place is clean and nice.  It is where the Boston Market was before that whole strip was knocked down.  The tables claim to be made from \"reclaimed New York bowling alleys\".

Parking is ample.  When I went (a Wednesday evening) there were no lines to speak of.  Service was of the \"order here, pickup there\" style with pagers handed out for you to know when to pick up.  My order was placed at 6:05pm and served at 6:12.  Pretty good for that time of day.

Since it was my first visit, I didn't muck about with the order.  I ordered a double shake burger, a hot dog with onions-ketchup-mustard and a chocolate shake.  They had store-made lemonade and craft beer on the menu, but if you go to a place named \"Shake Shack\", how could you not order a shake?

The burger was great!  First rate Angus beef, properly cooked.  The veggies were fresh, and the tomatoes were ripe (as they should be this time of year).  Absolutely no complaints.  Be sure to get enough napkins.

The chocolate shake was also fine.  Very chocolaty.

I didn't try the fries.  Partially because I'm not that big a fan of fries anyway, and partially because the online reviews of the fries weren't very positive.  Pre-frozen crinkle cut fries; not fresh cut fries like at In-N-Out.

The hot dog was only so-so.  Vienna Beef dog, sliced down the middle and fried.  Nothing wrong there.  It was delivered with only onions.  I mentioned I asked for also ketchup and mustard, and was politely told those were available at the condiment bar.  Nothing bad there, but nothing special either, especially given the price.

Which brings us to why only three stars.  The price.  My double burger, hot dog and shake was over $18.  I don't argue the experience was pleasant, and the burger was terrific.  Maybe I'm old and cheap.

So, summary:  I loved the burger and nothing else there turned me off.  But given the prices, they will be a treat and not a regular visit."}
{"text":"ah-may-zeeeeeeng! best burger ive ever had! ( shack stack ) and they close at 2am not at 00:00 as says on yelp"}
{"text":"Shake Shack is one of those weird chains that have a cult following. Similar to people's unfailing love for In-N-Out, it was enough that we decided to try it and see what all the fuss was about. 

I had the Shack Stack, a cheeseburger topped with the mushroom burger (itself stuffed with cheese, breaded and fried) and then topped with some mysterious ShackSauce. I have to admit, it was really good. It came out so fresh and piping hot, my friend burned his tongue while taking his first bite. The melted cheese inside is like lava! They cook the burger to your desired temperature which made the practically-raw-eating animals in my company happy. And it was nice that they had a vegetarian option, although I'm not sure if it's cooked separately from the meat (guessing not). The fries were crispy with soft centers. I also had their signature lemonade of the day, Strawberry-Mint. It was good but admittedly, a little sweet and less tart than what I prefer. 

Most in my party finished off their portions and came away satisfied. However, we agreed it was all pretty heavy, even for burgers... We were in Vegas, didn't drink, and really felt all that grease! We are definitely getting old. So, solid choice for burgers and lemonade but maybe not after you've walked 22k steps on the Strip."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is right up under In N Out on my personal Burger O Meter. We finally got to check it out after hearing so much about it... and I'm glad we did. Both of our burgers were cooked perfectly... juicy! The buns are amazing. I'm not sure what buns they use, but woah. Weird, I know... but we both noticed that while eating. 

So to avoid sounding anymore like Sir Mix A Lot... on to the shake! I got a vanilla shake... I honestly thought it'd be a little bigger, in size. But the shake quality and taste was a solid 8 out of 10. 

Shake Shack serves up some crispy crinkle french fries...which we also enjoyed. This serving size is another that I thought would be a little bigger. For the strip, the pricing was less than we though it'd  be. Two burgers, one order of fries and a vanilla shake came up to $21 and some change, not cheap but not horrible either. 

I love the decor! This location is clean and spacious... lots of tvs (mostly showing sports the night that we dined in). They also have a quick window (outside) for drink orders...and outdoor seating. It's best that you pay attention to the menu and know what you want to order while in line so that when you get to the window, you don't waste time. have never been to the Shake Shacks on the east coast, but this one is definitely worth checking out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Just ate here the first time a couple weeks ago. I've been back five times since! Their burgers are yummy and not too much of a bun (part of me makes me feel like I'm eating healthier then) I always get the shack burger double and add pickles and onions! You can skip the fries but make sure you go for a shake. Also if you have a pooch the ice cream my puppy loves!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to try In & Out but it closed so early so instead we settled on Shake Shack as it opens until 2am. We went in around 11:30pm and it was super busy and very lively. It had a nice ambiance and a bumping vibe.

As it being our first time, we had a get a bunch of different things on the menu to test it out. Everything was so good! The burgers were a good size and the patties were very juicy, the loaded hot dog was probably one of the best hot dogs I've ever had filled with many ingredients, the fries were crispy and not too salty and the milkshake was super thick and creamy! Personally for a \"fast food\" joint, it is pricey (as a Canadian converting American) but overall, I give it a definite thumbs up! 

I also learnt that Americans call Canadian iced tea \"sweet tea\". I asked for an \"iced tea\" but got tea that was literally iced!"}
{"text":"Everyone has been asking me if this is comparable to In-N-Out. My answer to that is no, you can't really compare the two! Sure, both are made with fresh ingredients and have pretty simple yet yummy menu options. However, In-N-Out is only has several main menu options. Shake Shack has a few more burger options and a ton of shake/ice cream/dessert options!

Located conveniently on the Strip,  we walked over from our hotel. The line is pretty long, but it moves quickly! I loved that the menu was on a huge chalkboard wall, which is great if you don't know what you want yet!

Service was really friendly. We got our food fast. Food was nicely presented and fresh! My BF and I each got the single Shake Stack, add bacon. We also shared an order of the crinkle cut fries and Black & White shake. YUM

If you want a pretty decently priced burger joint with fresh food and great service, check out the Shake Shack. Cheers to homemade burgers and shakes!"}
{"text":"I went here three times during my weekend here in Vegas. Although the line can look ridiculously long, don't worry because it moves fast. 

MANGO LEMONADE: It is a must try! With the weather there it is definitely something that is refreshing and cool you off. It was a little bit too sour in my opinion but I can't really complain since its lemonade haha.

SHACK STACK: With taxes, this burger was was about $10! And really, all it really is is a ShackBurger (~$6) with a cheesed filled portobello mushroom. I find it kinda outrageous how with an addition of a cheese filled mushroom can be $4. Other than that, the burger buns were delicious. I think its Hawaiian bread! +1 and its everything you can expect in a burger. I forgot to ask if they had pickles though. It was a good burger, don't get me wrong, but it was not a $10 worthy burger.

FRENCH FRIES: Nothing really special about the fires. Not too salty or soggy. Just munching on some potatoes.

CUSTARD: I wanted the mint chocolate custard but they told me that they ran out of it so they already had moved onto the following weeks' special custards which was Boston Cream PIe. It had a nice consistency with a subtle flavor. Not too overwhelming."}
{"text":"Yes it was a long wait but it was definitely worth it! The cheese fries were so good. The cheese wasn't your average American cheese just topped in their and melted. It was like a nacho cheese but way better!! The shack stack ahh that was to die for!! It was a cheeseburger with mushroom in it with cheese melted in it!!! A must try!! We also had the chicken dog. That was so good too. It tasted sweet and so flavorful!! The prices were good too and there menu was big so a lot to choose from, this place is a definite must try. I thought it was just gonna be a regular burger joint nothing special but ahh it became my favorite place. !! Everyone try it!!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger yet! I always get serious cravings for this burger.. So much so that I will even drive to the Strip for it. And that is REALLY saying something for a local... LOVE YOU SHAKE SHACK MY NUMBER ONE!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! We don't have Shake Shacks back at home, so when I was in a taxi going down the Strip and saw this beautiful neon burger, I knew I had to try it sometime during my Vegas trip. We stopped by around 4, and the line took less than 3 min. I ordered a cheese burger, crinkle fries, and a vanilla frozen custard. Everything was top notch! The burger was so good... Every ingredient had a role and they all played their role perfectly. The fries were crispy, not soggy at all. The custard was creamy and thick and oh so satisfying in the Vegas heat. 

My only little minor gripe is the service. It's my first time at a Shake Shack (hopefully not my last!), so I didn't know the lingo and I studied the menu a little bit harder than maybe others. But the cashier was talking really fast and was annoyed at me. Whatever, I guess that service at a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Haven't tried the Shake Shack in New York, but I heard the original was better. Could compare to In N Out though, definitely better quality but for double the price.
Located outside the NYNY Hotel- long lines but it moves quick so don't let that turn you away!

Ordered:

'Shroom Burger (Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato, & ShackSauce) - Basically the same as the Shack Burger just with a really well-cooked mushroom. 
Shack Burger (cheeseburger topped w/ lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce) - Cooked perfectly and the ShackSauce tasted like mayo with sriracha.

Cheese Fries (fries topped w/ special blend of cheddar and american cheese sauce)
-Need to try these!
Handspun Vanilla Shake (Malted)- This is where Shake Shack beats In N Out, I would say these are close to the best shakes I have ever tasted! Must-try.
 
Can't wait for the West Hollywood location in 2016!"}
{"text":"I had a tough time rating this place. The burgers are 5 stars without question. I literally couldn't ask for more. The shakes and beer selection are a great match. The staff is super friendly and it's a fun little people watching place. 

The fries are not very good. Slightly better than what the lunch lady served back in the day. 

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Skip this place! After reading the reviews last night, I thought perhaps people were too picky and we're giving too hard a report of this place. So I went with an open mind. 
I liked the look of the place. It had a promising feel that I thought would turn out some artsy creative burgers. NOPE! 
After spending close to $90 on a family of five, I was expecting rather great food. My shack burger had bacon which helped make it edible. Basically imagine a cheeseburger from Mc Donald's. Add some bacon. Add some red peppers. That's it! Gross! No FLAVOR! the fries were tasteless. The beer was ok. I ordered a pint. Definitely not a pint size. 
Save your caloric intake for something much better, please!"}
{"text":"Those who get all riled up about the East coast vs West coast, Shake Shack vs In N Out debate, step off. I like them both well enough and don't have either very often. I managed to hit up this new location when holiday shopping at the outlets, which is an experience that obviously requires stress eating before, during, and after.  Shake Shack to the rescue!

The Shack Stack (regular burger topped with a fried, cheese-filled mushroom cap!) is my go-to, clocking in at about a million calories but tasting sinfully good. This time I added on cheese fries (go big or go home!) and a seasonal shake- peppermint chocolate, as recommended by the cashier. $20 and way too much food (couldn't conquer the shake!), but not a bad indulgence when you only do it a couple times a year. 

TIP: Find it fast by parking  in the garages by the Nike store, take escalator to ground level, then hang a left."}
{"text":"Delicious juicy beef patties on soft egg bread...
Split grilled all beef hot dogs...
Custard cones and shakes...
THE BEST
They aren't coming to LA soon enough!"}
{"text":"The buns are very soft here ;) They make eating a lot easier, and their signature sauce adds a lot of flavor to the burger. We all ordered Shack Burgers and they were all perfectly cooked. The fries are pretty generic, but they aren't bad. THE SHAKES THOUGH. Salted caramel was amazing. Totally worth $6. The employees are a bit strange and socially awkward...but that's Vegas for you! Definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"Good burger, perfectly done fries, pitchers of good beer: all in all a tasty, cheaper meal option on the Strip!
A few thoughts:
- They have a special ale that Brooklyn Beer makes for them and it's really good.
- I'm normally not much of a fan of crinkle-cut fries, but these are SO crispy on the outisde and perfect inside that they've converted me.
- The cheese fries are an A+ variation. Not super cheesey tasting, yet somehow just right.
- Not fan of their burger sauce, so maybe consider getting it on the side if you're on the fence about opaque condiments like I am. (For taste calibration purposes, I love In-n-Out spread and tartar sauce. SS sauce has an off-putting flavor I can't put my finger on.)
- Hit the C window for a beer to drink while you wait in line, or to get a perfectly cold concrete for your walk to the slots."}
{"text":"I first tried shake shack when i was in new york many years ago and have always been a fan! I finally got to try it again in vegas this time and maybe I just hyped it up too much for myself... the burgers are decent.. not enough sauce.. and also very small. good thing I got two for myself (fatty here what's up), fries were bomb though and shake was great as well! prices are not too bad considering it's on the strip!"}
{"text":"I received a gift certificate so I went with my husband and I loved it! Nice location and area, restaurant clean, outside location is nice, and service is great. The guy took our buzzer and brought our food for us when it was ready and brought us some ketchup as well. You can bring your dog too."}
{"text":"Definitely spotless, staff very attentive. Just concerned about the price. Recent news blurbs about price increases bother me. 

I attempt to buy local, no matter the location. Shake Shake is not local to Las Vegas but one is assured that the quality will be consistent.

Great burger. One can tell that quality is paramount.

I will return, but will not seek out when local options are available."}
{"text":"I was ecstatic when I found out shake shack was coming to the west coast, and to Las Vegas nonetheless. 

I've been wasn't to returning to shake shack after having it a few time in NY. I finally had the chance to try it and although it was very good, it was not great. I did not leave me in awe the same way it did in NYC. I can't figure out why.. 

Prices are slightly higher than NY. Overall, it still very good. 

Can't go wrong with the shack stack - cheeseburger and a 'shroom burger topped with lettuce, tomato and Shacksauce"}
{"text":"Yummy place. Staff is still trying to figure it out. They weren't sure what white wine they had available. Love the cheese sauce on the fries. It's not the typical nacho cheese. Only down side is the hamburgers are pretty small for the price. I bought a glass of wine, fries, and a burger which all came to $23 . I'll be back for the cheese fries burger was average."}
{"text":"This I gave Shake Shack 3 stars because to me it was just another burger . For me personally I like Five Guys better but you be the judge ... Try it out and let me know what you think ."}
{"text":"I love shake shack and try to come here whenever I'm in the area. The lines get quite long here so you need to plan around it and come between lunch and dinner or late night when theres less people. Their burgers, while being on a the smaller side, have so much flavor. They are usually cooked just right (medium) and so they are nice and juicy as you take each bite. 

You can't go with with a regular burger, crinkle fries, and a shake. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I swear to god the burger and bun basically melt in you mouth. The only down fall for locals is that's it's on the strip. It'll be hard for that to stop me though."}
{"text":"Great shack burger and cheese fries!  Discovered this place on the way back to our hotel...and no line!"}
{"text":"So happy Shake Shack moved to this side of the island!!  Much needed here at The District!!  Was only the 5th day of operations but the staff moved like clockwork. Food was perfection. They kept the dining room clean at all times. I highly recommend the peanut butter shake but beware there are nuts in the shake so if you have allergies try another. The burgers are yum!  They even have a menu for your dog fur baby. The loaded fries were good but very large - make sure you have a hungry bunch with you if you order. 

Would love to keep this place a secret so it doesn't get crowded but I don't think that's going to happen so time it right so you don't have to wait for a seat. We got there at 6pm and didn't have to wait but by 6:30 it became standing room only and overflow to outside eating 

Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"If there's just one thing NY'ers do well, it's food.

I was afraid the hype would skew my senses and I would be disappointed because of the unbelievably high bar my mind was placing on this burger. It didn't. The hype is real.

Simple foods, like burgers, pizza's, hotdog's, that require such few ingredients, mean that those ingredients play huge rolls individually. Shake Shack proves that. They use a brioche bun (vs a cheap run of the mill bun), roma tomatoes (vs regular), green leaf lettuce (vs iceberg). They're serious about hitting all the right notes.

It's simply a great burger. 

For me, for several reasons, it's not fair to compare this to In-N-Out. Sure, they're both burgers, but that's where the similarities end. I'm no fan of In-N-Out. I can write a book on the subject. This is far better, no competition, however, for the simple fact that this burger is roughly 30-50% more expensive, it's not comparable.

They're kind of pricey, especially considering how small their burgers are. That's the only negative that comes to mind.

Get the SmokeShack. Get two.

{"text":"Soooo worth the wait in line!! Been to Shake Shack in NYC and in Miami, this place is just unreal. Burgers are perfect and melt in your mouth. Fries are ok, not competing with Five Guys, but if you add cheese and bacon...we'll now it's a different story! Shakes and concretes are nice adds and if you donate 2$ when you visit to feeding children you're given a free shake on you next visit which is really cool. Come prepared to wait in line but trust that it's worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Shake Shack.  I keep it simple.  I order a Hamburger, Fries and a  Shakemeister Ale.  It isn't too expensive and the burger taste fresh.  I also like the size of the burger, I don't want to have a 2000 calorie beast.  I just want to get my burger and fry fix.  It's too bad there isn't a Shake Shack in my neighborhood and I've had to travel 900 & 5000 miles to get my Shake Shack fix."}
{"text":"There is definitely a hype about this place, probably since their locations on the west coast tend to be few and far between.  I've eaten here and at one of their NYC locations and I must say they have a pretty good burger and fries, but it just doesn't live up to the hype for me.  I will take my west coast In N'Out burger over this one!  

One big gripe for me about this place is the pricing.  A hamburger is $4.55 and a Shack burger (seems like the only difference is a slice of cheese?) is $5.55.  A very expensive upgrade, if you ask me!  Definitely good to try if you've never had Shake Shack before, but I'll take a pass for a cheaper fast food burger."}
{"text":"The place is super clean,  location is great,  parking is bad. That said I've got the wrong food,  better said someone else's food.  A minute later myself and another lady meet at the counter with each other's food. The server asks if I want a new order?! Really? 
it was a busy night so I had to wait again. 
Not the happiest customer."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The employees were very friendly and upbeat and more than willing to make sure you have a great experience. Atmosphere was really cool! Restaurant was clean and always being cleaned right after customers left. Good thing cause it gets busy in there so be patient if you can't find a table right away but the employees are on it! Burgers were fresh, not frozen with the best tasting buns. Overall the burger was juicy and cooked just right. Toppings fresh. Fries were hot & crispy. Really cool combination of shakes and malts. I hate how people always say stick to in&out and compare. It's different! Take the sauce off of a in&out burger then eat it I dare you. Taste like crap and I'm from so cal. I def recommend this place. Bitch and complain about the price but first of all it fresh and a great burger! Second its Vegas! If your on a budget then why are you in Vegas?"}
{"text":"We came here expecting this place to blow our minds and it came up short on so many levels. The burger was good. Not anything to get excited about but it was good. Fries were basic Krinkle cut fries. The worst was the shake. Honestly the worst milkshake I've ever had. This place is called the shake shack and it was so bad we each tasted it, made a face, and threw it away. So sad !!"}
{"text":"The price tag is too big for a small burger and fries, but I have never left more happy after leaving a \"fast food joint.\" I had it once in Washington DC and was able to share a great time with my wife at Las Vegas this time. Shakes won't change your life but the burger will do a little to your soul for a minute."}
{"text":"The place is nice and clean. The burger was pretty good as were the fries. I still would prefer in-n-out any day."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place for a while now. I went to Vegas this weekend and my friends and I decided to try it. I ordered the single shack burger, cheese fries, and vanilla shake. It was pretty damn good. It made me full easily. The fries were crunchy and the shake was thick and creamy, just how I like it! Lmao. However, you have to pay for everything separately. You can't pay for anything as a full meal so I'd say it's kinda pricey for just a burger, fries, and a drink. My friend got the shake stack burger and she was almost halfway done eating it when she noticed a piece of long hair stuck to the meat and cheese. Kinda bad for trying a new place for the first time.  She complained about it and they made her a new burger AND she got a refund AND free custard! What great customer service! I'll for sure be back next time I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"First time here. Really good burgers and the kids really liked he crinkle cut fries. The shakes are really good. Thought it was a bit expensive. I thought the burgers and shakes are better than In and Out. I'd do it again, that coffee shake was great."}
{"text":"Good service. Quick and fast. Nice outdoor misted seating. The burger was delicious and cooked to perfection. Scrumptious bun. The crinkle fries were a highlight and up to par with the burger. I will be back."}
{"text":"I've had shake shack once before in New York, but I ate too fast and I didn't remember much about it, then they opened a location in Los Angeles and the debate about it being better than In N Out started, so when I came to Vegas, I made sure to make this one of my spots to go to. 
Service at this location is great, although there was a huge line to order, they had a huge menu on the wall, which made that line move a lot quicker.  When we got to ordering our food, I didn't know which beer I wanted, so the cashier allowed me to taste the different kinds and make a good decision.  He also thought we might have ordered a lot of food, so he informed us of that, which was nice, I could see people ordering too much food and getting upset that they don't finish it, but that was a normal order for me.
For my meal, I got the shake burger, with loaded fries, and the scrimshaw to wash it down with.  He burger is decent, rather small, but tasted good.  It's served with a potato bun which makes it different in a way. In no way does it taste better than the double double at in n out though.  The loaded fries on the other hand were really good.  They had chopped up peppers, bacon, and cheese on it.  This is a huge serving, for 2-3 people, but I had it on my own, but didn't finish it.  I wish they could make an individual size for that, because it cost $8.99.  The cashier did warn me about it, so I'm fine with it. This to me is better than the animal fries at in and out.  
It's a spot I'll go again for sure, maybe not here in Vegas, but as more spots pop up in Los Angeles, it'll be a good alternative to In n Out, but definitely doesn't beat it in my opinion."}
{"text":"I have dreams about the Shack Stack with bacon. I brought all of my coworkers here when we were in town for a conference, and it didn't disappoint. The place was clean, the service went above and beyond, and everyone raved about how great it was afterward. Two for you, Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"-Amazing chicken sandwich!!!
-Order on the app
-Chicago dog, meh
-shake, different consistency than most (not my favorite)

I will definitely be back for the chicken!!! But will order on the app next time"}
{"text":"First time here! I was gonna try this in NY but I guess I don't have to go there anymore. It's now here in Las Vegas!!!!

It's located across the M&M store, in between New York New York and Monte Carlo. 

Pros:
1. Delicious burger! I ordered the Shack Burger ($5+)
2. Restaurant was clean and very cool ambiance.
3. Menu was all over the restaurant so that was helpful.
4. Fries were crispy and well-seasoned ($3+)
5. Fast service.

Cons:
1. Pricey burger
2. Had to order fries and drink separate.
3. Buns were too greasy.
4. Order taker messed up our order only got 1 order of fries instead of 2. Newly opened restaurant should try to avoid any mistakes.

I don't think the price was reasonable. Food was good but not for the price."}
{"text":"For some reason, I don't see why everyone is obsessed with Shake Shack. I've been there twice now and I've decided I won't be going back. During the most recent visit I ordered the Shroom Burger (Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce) and fries. The mushroom was interesting and not bad but the cheese was extremely hot and messy every time I took a bite. Don't get me wrong, everything was good but it just wasn't anything special. 

One thing I liked was the outside seating right on the strip. If it isn't summer, it is nice to sit outside and people watch while you're eating.

To me, if you're craving a fast food style burger, there are better options nearby."}
{"text":"Food: 4
Service: 4

This place is worth it. I was super happy to be satisfied with my meal, as often times hype is just hype. I got the Shack cheeseburger,  cheese fries and a chocolate shake. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is staying on or near the strip and wants a good burger that is fast.  

The line was intimidating when walking into the restaurant, but it moved quickly and the food was served promptly.  We only had one issue where a ice cream separator paper ended up in my friend's shake, but the manager was quick to apologize and remedy the situation.  I would definitely come here again next time I find myself in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not happy with the price per product the food is over price $2.99 for pop that's like a small cup like McDonald's unreal then $11.99 for a cup of ice cream"}
{"text":"Food: Definitely the ideal burger/Cheese burger served with not much condiments the line was pretty long, but with multiple cashiers to take your orders its NOT too much of a wait. I had the double cheese burger and my wife had the hot dogs. Shake Shack  definitely makes the Burger the star, the meat patty is very good and with the melted cheese on it. The condiments are on the side which you can add on if you want. This burger is a must try!

Location - Here is the one star deduction Shake Shack is located on the strip which makes foot traffic their main business, either park at Monte Carlo or NY NY and walk from there to reach this place. So anyone local travelling with kids this might be something to consider.

Restroom - Clean 

Service - This is a burger joint so dont expect too much you order from a window and you get a Vibration Device which signals your to pick up your order. Shake Shack does have servers that cleans up tables, assist you on throwing the trash and opens the doors for you. 

Overall - If you want Burgers Definitely try Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"Their burgers are okay.  Quality meat, but nothing too memorable.  The best thing here is their shakes.  The fries are so-so, good crinkle cut fries, but nothing memorable"}
{"text":"This is definitely an amazing place! We got the Brownie Batter shake and I honestly loved it!! Got the chicken sandwich option and it did not disappoint! It kept you full, but not too full which is perfect! I didn't get a food coma haha. I enjoyed the wavy fries as well! You don't see them too often! Definitely loved this place!"}
{"text":"Highly overrated for me. Went at 5:20 Friday evening and waited almost 1/2 hour to order...another 10 minute wait for the food. Total bill for 4, over $60. I got the ShackStack, with a portabella mushroom fried and stuffed with cheese on top of a cheeseburger. Mushroom was quite mealy, and threw off the taste of the entire burger. Got a root beer float, because they were out of coffee shakes. Float came in a huge cup that was almost all root beer...very little custard, disappointing to say the least. My girls (college age) loved the fries, and said their burgers were good, but we all agreed that you can get much better burgers at equal price point without the wait at a number of different Charlotte restaurants. Probably a one and done for me. Not worth the wait, IMO, when I can go to Bad Daddys or Liberty and get a great burger, and a cold beer of my choice (only one beer offered at SS), and be almost finished in the time it would take me to wait in line at Shake Shack. No thanks."}
{"text":"I was so excited that Shake Shack was going to open a location in Charlotte! And I was not disappointed. We Ordered fries with bacon & cheese (awesome), & 2 of the Smokeshack burgers and 2 small drinks. If you are in Charlotte and haven't try it yet, go for it! Prices are higher than competitors, but... you get for what you pay for. Not grease, not overcooked, perfect!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is very well run and nice. 

Not sure if I am just over shake shack or what but. Just not as in to the burger here as I was in DC.  Just doesn't compare for me to in and out or other burgers I have had. 

Love the fires though if you are in to old school crinkle. Best you can get!"}
{"text":"Solid burger, expected more from the hype though. I still like in n out animal style better, but like this place better than most of the other popular burger places."}
{"text":"Came here to eat an early dinner! I have heard about this place but never been. First time here. 

As we walked in, there was a line. The menu is directly in front which makes it easy to order. I go with a large mango lemonade and a shack burger which is just a cheese burger. Hubby also got crinkle cut fries along with a hot dog and apple juice for our daughter. I took a bite of my burger, and first thing that hits me is the flavor of the meat. So flavorful. Perfect size similar to in and out. The crinkle cut fries were crunchy and good. The mango lemonade is a little tart but good. There were lots of seating inside. They give you a buzzer to pick up your order. You basically get your napkins, straws, ketchup at the tables. 

There is a waitress that picks up your trash when you are done, and asks how the food is. She was really nice. Great customer service here. There was music playing in the background. Television screens are all around the restaurant. I definitely would come back here for burgers if I stayed on the strip!"}
{"text":"I don't usually review that many chains restaurant but I finally tried shake shack last weekend and I wasn't impressed. I tried and shared the chick n shack and the shack burger so I had half of each burger. I probably prefer the chick n shack a little more just because there was more texture to the burger. It was still a little on the dry side but the pickles and veggies help the burger a little bit. Then there is the shack burger which I thought is so so. It's just that if you had in - n - out, I don't really see why I would ever come here to eat. I think the one unique thing I find a bit interesting is their bun. I kinda like their soft buns that went with the burger. However, the insides just didn't do it for me. It's not only expensive but it didn't win me over with their pricing + their quality.

You paying 6-7 dollars without fries for a small burger(around the size of a McDonald burger) and maybe some people can get full from it but I surely didn't. Also tried the fries which weren't bad but I might have to pick McDonald fries(which I haven't had in years). 

Will I come back? Prob not. I don't get the hype and I don't get the wait for this place."}
{"text":"I love the regular burger, it tastes so yummy and clean... You feel good after the meal, unlike any other burgers, you feel guilty and fat."}
{"text":"Just go here the line goes quickly. 

Keep it simple get any double burger on the menu and water or a soda. Perfectly cooked premium quality and their toppings are perfect. The one with peppers and bacon is my favorite, but I also really enjoyed the way the mushroom patty on the double stack was just oozing cheese. 

Again keep the order simple there isn't anything else exceptional on the menu. The fries are terrible their choice of beers is terrible the hot dogs are two steps above terrible, but the burger is what you want."}
{"text":"Busy busy busy..great burgers and fries.  Everything sold a la carte. We had two burgers , two fries and two 16 oz beers for $35! Great location and good for late night munching. The line moves fast and they've obviously perfected their service plan. Took less than 10 mins from waiting to order to picking up our food. If/when I go back, I'll just have one thing, and I'll feel better about dropping just $10 vs triple that"}
{"text":"They get 2 stars based on the fact that the burger was tasty. It was incredibly small and some \"smart\" person put really cold lettuce and pickles on an already cool burger. The fries were something straight out of an frozen fry bag...disgusting.  The line was out the door and they only had 2 cashiers working so it took an extremely long time to order the food (which I'll state again was tasty) I can say I tried shake shack, but I won't be back.  Well maybe I'll give them another shot and try the shake!"}
{"text":"Look no further than shake shack for an affordable top notch burger. As far as burger chains go, this is my absolute favorite. The buns are soft, the beef juicy and the cheese melted to perfection. 

Perfect for a late night snack, afternoon snack, lunch, breakfast, dinner, pretty much any time of the day. I had the shackbuger but any burger is equally amazing. Having a Vegas location is perfect for west coasters who don't frequent this east coast based eatery."}
{"text":"So, never had a burger from shake shack...heard all the buzz about their burger and how delicious it is.  I've heard this before about another burger joint out in the wild west and I went in and out of that place.  Their burger was okay and maybe too much hype about their burgers made with sauce from animals or something.   ;-)
I was pretty disappointed in that other experience and didn't think it was that \"awesome.\"  

So back to Shake Shack...I was expecting a similar situation with hype over heat.  I ordered a Shack burger, double pattie all the way (the way it has it on the menu).  Also ordered crinkle cut fries (normal) and a desert \"Oh my pie\" (custard with blueberry pie), which we put on hold until we finished our food.  So the burger...the patties are pretty thin patties (not a thick fat juicy burger) so I'm glad I got the double.  But even though they are thin, they were pretty MOIST, which was a plus (a bit greasy, but not sure what you'd expect from burger). It was good!!  Overall, I was happy with my burger.  

The crinkle cut fries were hot, fresh and pretty crunchy.  Kudos for not giving me greasy fries.  The wife enjoyed the fries...and she loves her fries.  

Now, for desert.  We are a fan of A custard place that is Good and they have berries.  Shake shack isn't as good as that place (to be fair, Shake shack is known for their burgers and that other place is known for their custards), but still was pretty good.  

So overall, very pleased with the food and the service.  I would definitely recommend this place and would revisit in the future.  If you are looking for a decent burger place, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is a place that I have loved after visiting in New York and the LV location did not disappoint. Although more expensive than other fast food burgers, the meat quality, bun softness and overall taste make up for it! I got just a plain hamburger with lettuce, onions, tomatoes and light shack sauce. The line is a little slow as well when receiving the food and with a shake or fries, the prices can be high but it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! You guys are always on my Facebook and we Finally took the drive to try this place. Cashier was friendly. It's a tad bit pricey due to having to order everything separate from each other, but it is worth every dollar! When you bit into the burger it's how every single burger should always taste! It was amazing! I ordered a double thinking the patties would be thin but it was a huge burger! Next time I will for sure order a single. We got the bacon cheese fries they were good but will probably pass on them next time. Just wanted to give em a try this time! The plan fries are pleasant. Restaurant was very clean. Worker was walking around cleaning tables and asking how everything was! Please bring one to WEST-GATE by the stadium you guys would make bank there!!! We will be back even though it's 35 minutes away!



9-22-17 2nd visit here! Called to ask to save patio tables for my husband and I's birthday. Manger was very nice and said of course they would love to have our party there! The food was AMAZING as usual! We had a party helper named Thomas and he was awesome! Very nice he got us water pitchers and cups brought us menus to look at brought us our food. He cleared our stuff when we were finished. They offered to keep our cake cool. They even offered to have our pets come along to enjoy their patio! It's people like this who care so much about their business that make it so nice for their customers. We will continue to come back for a great burger. Thank you shake shack for making our birthdays special with your great service!!!! ***** 5 stars for you guys always!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place. Its like a restaurant version of In n Out. My opinion but I like the buns over In n Out. My kids love this place and I will probably stop by if they want it. I have my favorite burger joint and I like my meat done rare. This place the patty is kinda thin. The mushroom burger tasted like salted cheese burger. I only tried it once and I love mushroom but it was on the salty side. These days I don't do cheese in my burger because you lose the flavor of the meat with the cheese. I would do a cheese burger and meat with no veggie if thats what I craving for... like White Castle."}
{"text":"Il a fallu attendre d'être à Las Vegas pour manger un vrai bon burger ! Rien à redire. 
Les frites son excellentes, la sauce aussi. Le goût y est ! 
Le service est rapide et le décor est vraiment sympa. 
Je recommande sans hésitation !"}
{"text":"First off, to give my opinion on the rivalry: I think Shake Shack is much much better than In-N-Out.
The burgers are dressed such that you can appreciate the flavor of each ingredient (there's not too many toppings, and one does not overpower any of the others). The burgers are half-wrapped in paper, making the eating much easier, as you can hold the burger by the paper and not have it drip all over you. The crinkle cut fries are crispy on the outside yet soft and steaming hot on the inside (our order came with cheese on top of the fries, and it was still crispy underneath the cheese).
The atmosphere is slightly divey, as the wood for the tables look to be recycled from a previous use. It is very warm and brightly lit, and there is sufficient spacing between tables so you don't have to awkwardly glance away from adjacent tables."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is fair. That's the best way I can describe it. The service is good here. Inside is very clean and it doesn't take long to get your order. I got the smoke shack burger. Again, it was fair. 
The shake was excellent, probably the best thing here. I went with the strawberry, great choice. I might have to come and try it again, and maybe I'll have a better feeling about it."}
{"text":"Arrived around 3:50pm on Father's Day and there was a decently long line outside. Took us about 30 minutes to finally get inside and up to place an order.  We order a two smoke shacks, a double shackburger and a double smoke shack, fries (I ordered the bacon cheese fries), and since Shake is in the name of the restaurant we all got shakes. A strawberry shake, a chocolate brownie shake, a salted caramel shake and a marshmallow chocolate chip shake. All for a total of $71.69. Wasn't expecting that price for the type of food we got. Decent burgers, boring crinkle fries which you can get anywhere (the cheese and bacon fries were definitely not worth the extra 2 bucks), and the shakes were good, but honestly I could go to Dairy Queen or my local ice cream shop and get the same quality. Coming from Akron all the way up here for this was totally not worth the drive. I prefer the burgers at Swensons or even Five Guys over this and would make out for less than I did here. Overall, I feel like this place serves decent burgers at a premium price."}
{"text":"Shake shack is better than In-N-Out. 

I'd leave it at that but Yelp wouldn't consider it a review, just a Tip. Seriously, I was born and raised on the west coast. I love InNOut but it just can't compete with shake shack. InNOuts animal fries are definitely the best, but their shakes suck! Shack fries are good enough. Shack shakes are very good! As for the burgers, they are both great, but the shack burger gets the W. 
Tip: order the peanut butter bacon burger from the secret shack menu. It's good."}
{"text":"I think shake shack is overrated. The fries are pretty meh and have very little seasoning. The sauce is good but the burgers are nothing special. I wasn't a huge fan of the chocolate shake either - it was richer than I'd like. All of these things are personal tastes - the restaurant seemed clean. It was overpriced but on par for the vegas strip."}
{"text":"Kinda overrated. Being from l.a and used to having an in n out always close by I wouldn't travel to weho just for an overpriced burger and fries. Walking in the restaurant looked nice and renovated but it was dirty. The floors had spilled soda and the tables were messy. Not to mention the girl who helped us Emma was super rude and unfriendly. I specially wanted to write this review cause she left a sour taste in my mouth. But the burger itself was good. It was pretty small and the fries were like del taco fries which are really good, but not for 3$ and for the amount they give you. I'd say pass on this place."}
{"text":"Tip: located outside of New York, New York beside Tom's Urban, and isn't listed on the hotel's directory/map.
The line was pretty long around lunch time, so hopefully you have the patience to wait to order, then wait for your shakes/food. It literally formed out the door when we got there. Place is that crowded when it comes to sitting indoors as well, but I like the variety of food and shakes, especially the ones infused with alcohol. 
Hehehe... There's also a couple items listed for dogs! Maybe I'll bring my spoiled princess here some time in the future."}
{"text":"Great place i truly enjoy it, im looking forward to going back..... strawberry mint lemonade was truly different taste really good..."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food and the vibe was good, Customer service was awesome. And they provide dog menu and treats... Pricey though. 30 bucks for 2 people."}
{"text":"I don't know how many more times I can sing their praises. I love Shake Shack. I've had many discussions (debates/disputes?) regarding the best burger chain and Shake Shack is always at the top of my list. Their burgers are just top notch: fresh, delicious, savory and full of so much flavor. Their juicy patties topped with cheese, bacon, peppers and stuffed into a potato bun is heaven. I never cared for crinkle cut fries because I always associated them with frozen food, but Shake Shack's crinkle cut cheese fries are addicting. When I want a good beer, I get their Shackmeister. When I want to add more calories to my diet, I get one of their many shake options. Always a hit, too.

This location's lines can get long but the service is speedy and you don't wait very long. Kudos to SS for their amazing food and staff."}
{"text":"Although, I love that they use grass fed beef,  the pattie was slightly over salted. The bun had good flavor but was a bit disappointed they don't offer grilled onions. The Shack sauce was tasty.  A bit pricey compare to other burger places but I chalk it up to using grass fed beef. The french fries were just a bit average...I did like that they were crinkle cut. Being that I went to the location in Las Vegas on The Strip... it was pretty crowed and hard to find a table for my family. I basically had to stalk another family that looked like they were almost done. Staff was quite friendly and the establishment was clean. They have a big screen and plenty of t.v.'s if you wanted to catch a game and have a burger."}
{"text":"*kourtney kardash voice* it's sooo good.

Burgers are delish. But what really got me were the milkshakes. Real custard milkshakes. My friend ordered a peanut butter milkshake and it tasted like fresh ground peanut butter, that slightly grainy texture that's similar to sesame. 

I don't usually like peanut butter but I LOVED that milkshake!"}
{"text":"One of the best burger places out there. Decently priced, almost cheap by Vegas standards. One of the must try stops."}
{"text":"I would say Just keep walking. The burned burger rave is simply not my cup of tea. Ive had better crinkle fries from Ralph's. How in the heck do you run out of soda and still charge for it? The only thing worth trying here is their signature Ale. Needless to say, I wont be back here anytime soon. I hate to say it but I rather hit up mikideez! P.S. If corporate is reading this, don't bother with this burger joint in Cali!"}
{"text":"It lived up to its hype. Burgers are real good! Shakes and malts are good too! Gonna come back here again."}
{"text":"Majorly over priced for fast food. 1 tiny milk shake, 2 burgers and a very good fries no cheese costs close to 28.00$. It is fresh and yummy but not worth its hype. There are better for less."}
{"text":"A bit of a background history before I start. My sister and I went to NYC more than a year ago and have been missing shake shack since then. When we found out there was one in Vegas, we couldn't wait to visit. Not only did we go, but we took my dad. This is rare. EVERYONE LOVED IT! My dad is a huge fan of their fries and loved their shack burger (as do my sister and I). He liked them because they were crispy and thick. We went at about 4-5pm and they had run out of their mango lemonade. The regular lemonade was refreshing. Like I said, this is rare that we all like a burger place. Shake shack, you are amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been hearing about this place for a long time and was excited to finally try it out in Vegas. The burger was absolutely amazing and the crinkles fries were just as good. If you are a fan of In-n-Out. You will definitely enjoy this place."}
{"text":"I've only ever had Shake Shack at this location and let me tell you...amazingly delicious!! My husband and I ate it twice while there recently because we couldn't get enough! The meat patty has so much flavor and the strawberry shake is to die for!! This is a \"must-stop\" while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"A cute place went to get our dogs groomed and found this place. Burgers were good just wish they were bigger. Service was good no complaints. Fries were decent nothing out of the ordinary. Tried my sons chicken sandwich def fresh and yummy. My youngest loved his hotdog and I love how they have a menu for the dogs should def come with them. Only downside is price can be expensive."}
{"text":"I will never go back. Do not be disillusioned: this is gross fast food. To sum up my experience: low quality and generic food. Fries are bland, dry, and cheese sauce is disgusting. The chicken sandwich was also dry and too crispy on a boring (also dry) white bun. The burger patty was too thin to be cooked anything but well done. Shack-nado hotdog was also gross. Everything was small for the price. Save your money and go to Five Guys, In n Out, or Chic Fila. Really, go anywhere but here. I was looking forward to this place but will now be marking it off my list - forever!"}
{"text":"Not good. Bland burger, American cheese, and too soft bun. Does not compare to In n Out and Vegas Fatburger just down the street is better as well."}
{"text":"Wow this place was delicious.  I shared a chicken sandwich with my boyfriend and it was almost as good as Chic Fil A.  Mmmmm! Loved it!  The lemonade was great too! The fry sauce was kind of weird but the fries were delicious with just ketchup anyway."}
{"text":"Food is average. Milkshakes are ok. A little overrated and overpriced. $55 for 4 burgers, 2 fries and 3 shakes. Could have paid half that at in n out."}
{"text":"Great burgers, best on the strip hands down. The chicken sandwich is a sure treat. The staff is super friendly, but expect a lot of people no matter the time of day."}
{"text":"Such a great burger! For the price the burger can't be beat. It wasn't greasy, soggy or over cooked. It was simply a great burger! I can see myself coming back after the initial rush dies off."}
{"text":"Yooo I was pretty hyped for this place. Got the single shack burger, mint cookies n creme milkshake and a lemonade. Shake costs more than the burger and it's a little warm. Burger tasted pretty good, but for 6 bucks, you get like 3 bites and it's gone. Lemonade was very sour. Tasted like straight up lemon juice."}
{"text":"I tried Shake Shack a few years ago in Manhattan. When it came to Las Vegas I was excited as I come here a few times a year. The burger was amazing. It was fresh, tasty and very juicy. The fries were hot and crisp. We tried Wahlburgers earlier in the day and there is no comparison.  Wahlburgers was horrible. I have eaten at the Shake Shack in Manhattan and Las Vegas. I have never had a bad experience. Shake Shack is perfect."}
{"text":"I  believe it could be a bit better cause the portions  were small especially   for the prices"}
{"text":"I had a burger and cheese fries. The cheese fries looked sad. In my opinion not much cheese to be considered cheese fries. But the regular shack burger is really good. You can taste the quality in the beef. The place is brand new so I will be coming back to have another burger and cheese fries. All in all it's worth a shot if you want a tasty burger."}
{"text":"Took a drive from the west side on a Friday afternoon to see what the hype was about. I orders the special Wisconsin cheddar bacon burger. Absolutely delicious. My complaint was I wanted it to be a bit bigger. I don't love crinkly fries but these ones were fresh and crunchy. I had the blueberry pie concrete. There was actual pie in the custard. Yum"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers- a standout from the crowd of mediocre burger chains. Being from the Midwest these are a dime a dozen. The burger was flavorful and delicious and the bun was soft and fluffy; the best part, it didn't fall apart one bit or get soaked in grease. 

The people working were super friendly despite being the opening day. I heard they opened one in Chicago and this was good enough to venture there sometime. Also much cheaper than the chi-chi burger places in the strip hotels. Worth a try if you're hungry and want to eat without venturing through the smoky murkiness of hotel casinos.  Yum!"}
{"text":"This place did indeed live up to the hype! Shake Shack in my opinion is a wonderful new edition to the burger scene in Vegas. Its unique enough to not be In n Out and its not too fancy to be a Gordon Ramsay burger. Whoever says this place offers a simple burger is wrong. It is definitely something special. No where else in Vegas can you get such an oozy gooey cheesy burger or a giant portobello stuffed with cheese between two buns. They should honestly rename the burger \"cheesy burger\" but whatevs. I also normally don't like crinkle cut fries because they come out soggy but surprisingly the fries here were quite crispy. The coffee shake I got was good but nothing too spectacular. Only downside I can see if the price. Though it is something different, paying such a high price for this burger, at this portion, is not the best. However, I do recommend that everyone try this once. Its definitely something you don't want to miss out on."}
{"text":"Weird to say me and my friends have burgers the next day to cure out hangovers (pff) anyways they have amazing burgers, fries and shakes! Fast and friendly service! Come in hungry and leave filled and satisfied!"}
{"text":"This is was the first time going to this restaurant after hearing great things. We happened to be in Vegas so we figured it was a perfect opportunity to try it. 

Atmosphere: The place was really over the top with lights and what night considering it was vegas. However, the seating was great inside and out. The outside seating had misters which was great for the heat. Inside where mostly booths which were comfortable. 

Service: The folks at the register were very friendly. Which is saying a lot because it was packed. They were moving the line rather quickly and we didnt have to wait long at all.

Food: It took about 10 minutes to get our food. We ordered the Double smoke shack, a single cheeseburger, and two single shake burgers. We got three orders of fries and a strawberry shake, chocolate and peanut butter shake to top it off.
The burgers had the special shake seasoning which gave the burgers a wonderful charbroil. The burgers were perfect bun to meat ratio and lived up to the hype. The fries was fantastic. The shakes were thick and rich with flavor.

I would definitely go back when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I just finished eating at their shack meet up and I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed the food! The 2 best bites I had were the shack stack burger and the shack-ago hot dog. I also went classic with a simple vanilla shake and it was perfectly sweet.

The ambiance is very casual and there isn't any very convenient parking but it's a solid option especially around the NY NY.

Service was friendly and although very busy, all the areas I saw were surprisingly clean and orderly.

Next time I want to have more ice cream!"}
{"text":"I had a single hamburger, fries, and a cold milk. Although I ordered a vanilla shake, technically. 

Overpriced. Overpriced. Overpriced. Insane. The burgers themselves are pretty good, to be sure, but I can get one just as good in  the time for  1/2 the price at In-n-Out. At these prices, this place brings nothing to the table. 

The fries were not great. I left half of them uneaten; a real rarity for me. The wall says they're hand cut and fresh, but maybe that is just what's written on the freezer bag they came out of. They sure don't taste fresh if they are, and when I say fresh I mean when I drive through at In-N-Out I can see a kid reevaluating his short life's choices while he runs whole russets through that chopper. That's fresh.

I called my shake a cold milk at the beginning. To be totally fair, there was obviously some ice cream in it, but this is one of the least appealing milk shakes I've ever had. Here's the test: suck it through a straw. If you feel like your eyeballs are going to get pulled inside your head, it's too thick. If you let the straw go and the milkshake that is left behind immediately runs back down into the cup, it's too runny. Not only did this milkshake run like the wind back out of the straw, it was just bleh for flavor. A true disappointment. 

I say all of this with a heavy heart. I had my first Shake Shack burger at Bite of Las Vegas, 94.1 FM's yearly music and food festival. The burger was great! And so was the burger I had in-house on this visit. I thought I was getting price-raped at Bite of Las Vegas because I was at a food festival with $12 Miller Lights. Turns out I was getting price-raped because that's the business model here. And between that and the fries, and the shake, being so lackluster I don't care how good the burgers are. I'm not going to pay for them."}
{"text":"For my 500th review, I am happy to write it for Shake Shack. This location is the first Shake Shack in the west coast and hopefully more to come! I am from Los Angeles and just happened to be in Vegas the day Shake Shack had its grand opening. Of course we stopped by to get our grub on! To my surprise, it wasn't a long wait. We waited maybe only 15 minutes and they gave us samples of their vanilla and chocolate concretes which kept me even more happy and satisfied. 

This is by far the largest Shake Shack I have ever been to. Lots of ample seating inside and outside. Heating lamps outside for those chilly winter nights. Decor is super modern and yet comfy. Service was great as usual and food was done super quick. This is a very friendly and efficient staff considering it was grand opening and there are sometimes hiccups. But I saw no hiccups. They were all a machine and happily working.

My fiance and I got the Stack Shack which is my personal favorite. I love the cheesy portabello mushroom with my burger. I also normally get their vanilla shake but this time we changed it up and got their special which was the salted caramel shake. I am so glad we did. This shake was phenomenal and so delicious and creamy! It wasn't too sweet. It was just perfection.

Just as a heads up, Shake Shack is technically not connected to a specific hotel. It is located in between NYNY and Monte Carlo. You can't miss it!

Ahh even as I am writing this, I am craving their shakes. Their shakes are phenomenal. Maybe I need to go back to Vegas again very soon. I am so happy west coast finally has a Shake Shack of its own!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this business; no kids meals,  soggy buns, every thing was really greasy, tough to see the menu on the wall going up about 15 feet, when I asked for one item on the side they charged 50 cents to do that, every thing was al cart, very expensive for what it was-nothing special, I was rang up wrong and had to go back for a refund. Service seemed nice however I believe that was only because of the screw ups for our party. One person had ordered everything on the side but did not get it that way and had to wait for it to be corrected.  Certainly no reason to go back, ever."}
{"text":"It was pretty good, not spectacular. I'd been wanting to try them for awhile since I'd heard buzz & excitement from friends & others. I was pleasantly surprised by how spacious it is inside! Decor is cute, menu is fun! The hamburger was a little better than average. To me it's comparable to Smashburger but smaller in size. The fries were also good but not something I'd go out of my way for. The star of the show was definitely the shake! Which I guess is what's important since it's in their name. I got the Black & White shake & it was delicious! I don't think I'd make it a point to come back here for the food, but I wouldn't be opposed to stopping by to try some more of their ice cream!"}
{"text":"Thumbs down all around. 
I have heard a lot of mixed reviews for this place. Decided to take the plunge and give it a go tonight. I placed two orders, one was dine in and the second to go. Starting with the first; customer service was amazing, that's where they've earned their first star. I was buzzed only to walk up to the counter and hear an apology: \"oops, we didn't meant to, we will re buzz your pager.\" I go sit down only to be buzzed again immediately. Okay... when I arrive at the counter for the second time two orders of fries are ready, but only one burger. (I ordered two burgers) \"sorry, we can buzz you again!\" No, really, this is annoying, I ask if they can bring the burger-yes. For our troubles they also brought a third drink. Awesome, but there is only two of us...   So, when I bit into my burger, the first one which was done, it was pink. Clearly not done. Of course they'll fix it they say!! And when it is returned to me it comes with a FOURTH drink!! You cannot make this stuff up! So, my second order, it was to go. Again with the premature buzzing. Maybe they just like a crowd around the counter?? Our food finally arrives and we head home-Green Valley. My son starts eating his burger....PINK!!! Not cooked completely!  So we paid $60; got three burgers (2 of which were raw), one order of regular fries, two orders of BBQ bacon cheese fries, 2 drinks (and another two free drinks) one float and two sml concretes. I feel robbed. I'll stick with IN n OUT."}
{"text":"a crispy breaded mushroom bursting with ooey gooey cheese!!!!!
nuff sai... brb


sorry i had to drive down to the strip and go get one of those vegetarian delights as i was writing my original review.

this place is killer good."}
{"text":"I'm so jealous that there's a Shake Shack in Scottsdale and not SF!

I rarely eat fast food but I love the Shackburger with its melty cheese and secret sauce (make sure to request pickles and onions)! I'm not, however, a fan of their fries but the shakes are delicious. It must have been by lucky day because their featured shake was cookies and cream, my favorite! 

The food here was just as good as at the Madison Square location."}
{"text":"Five stars for that old fashion taste! The pricing is a bit steep for the size of the burger and for this alone I give this place an overall four stars.  

The Shack burger is my go-to-burger.  It has that old fashion taste which I find myself craving and makes this place my first choice when in the mood for a burger. They also sell serveral hotdog options. 

Fries are crinkle cut and delicious too; just wish they stayed hot a little longer. It would be nice to have onion rings or other fry options too. 

And you definitely can't forget about the sweet stuff.  Although it's seasonal, there pumpkin pie concrete is my favorite, but I have tried the apple and also the s'mores concrete which are also great.  Their vanilla custard all on its own is deliciously silky goodness and they do offer concrete samples.  

They also serve root beer on tap which is also very tasty as well as hotdog creations.  
The service is very courteous and the managers come around to make sure your meal is up to standards.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Shown in picture: Chickn Shack burger, Shackburger, the Smokeshack burger, regular crinkle fries and cheese fries. 

Overall experience was ok. For whatever reason, they forgot to put in order. Our buzzer went off and  the only item that came out were the cheese fries. I told the girl working there that we order $60 worth of food. She was confused because she never the saw the order. I had to go back to our table and give her a copy of our receipt. So that was annoying because we had to wait even longer. 

Everything is a la carte! This place is expensive for a fast food joint. I highly recommend the cheese fries and the chickn shack burger! Not sure if I'd come back though."}
{"text":"I have heard so much about this place specially when my sister went to NYC a couple of years ago and then it popped up in Vegas too. I heard a mix about this place how it is so much better than InNOut or its eh. Well the time has finally come and it is here in my very own backyard! So definitely had to try it when I got the chance. We got there and the line looked super intimidating because it was pretty long, but of course we decided to stay anyways. Suprisingly the line went by pretty fast, which was great! I was excited to finally try the famous Shake Shack! 

It has an open concept which was pretty cool and the dining room opens to the patio where you can definitely dine in the perfect Arizona spring weather. But too bad we had to take it to go since we are meeting up with some fam in a different part of the mall. I do love the decor though!

Anyways we ordered: ShackBurger (single for me $5.29 and double for him $8.09) Woo $8 burger....dayyuuummm. And we got 1 regular fries and 2 cheesefries...and a couple of small drinks...all for the small price of $32. Wow...it feels and looks like fast food, but the price tho haha. Better be worth it.

Finally eating: The burger was delicious! There was a taste to it that is a little something extra special so def enjoy that burger. The fries were okay tho. The cheese was good but since it was to go, by the time we ate the fries it was a little bit cold as well as the cheese...but it was still not too bad.

Definitely would come back, but is it worth the hype? Not sure yet, I got to go back and try it a few more times ;)

For now...3.5!"}
{"text":"You ever see a place and you know you're missing out because the line is out the door stretched half way down a New York block. Then you see another one, in another part of the city, same thing. 

Then you go to Vegas because the last two times you were in New York, you still didn't get a shake shack burger. Central Park is a thing on the strip of Vegas because the buck stops here!

No more, you no longer were going to walk past another shake shack. Your pride in the burger joints like In n Out and Culver's and the occasional Five Guys kept you at bay.

You didn't even get a shake shack burger, you got a  shroom burger because you don't see that every day. You bite into it and it's crispy and juicy and cheesy. It's so good you don't even miss meat. Because that's the best vegetarian meal you've ever had and it comes from a burger joint. You then wash it down with an exclusive shake shack beer from Brooklyn brewing company, and then you notice that the table you're sitting at is a bowling lane refurbished out of Brooklyn.

You then have your shake tres leches de dulce leches , and then you realized you wasted two trips to New York because of pride. You have too much pride in Culver's burgers and frozen custard. That shake changed a lot of things for you after that, life changes. You then say I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The ate here two times in one day, for lunch and dinner. The first time I really liked it. I ordered a Shack burger, crinkle fries and a peach lemonade, roughly around $12. I heard good things about this place, I was anxious to try it. Took my first bite, amazing! You can really taste the flavor of the beef and definitely can tell it was never frozen. Love at first bite. After that meal, I was hooked!

Second time, I was craving it bad. Ordered the shack burger and cheese fries. This time, it wasn't as good. I almost thought this place was better than in n out, almost! It is definitely comparable, but nothing beats in n out. The cheese sauce on the fries was delicious. I would come back here again though, only because its on the strip and I dont have to drive anywhere."}
{"text":"MAYBE I over hyped myself about trying shake shack, but I wasn't jumping up and down after having a Shack Burger.  I'm not sure what it was.  I really wanted to love it, but it didn't happen.  

My husband had the shake stack and I took a bite...it was good but nothing impressive.  A positive was their fries were crinkled and crispy and if there is one super positive thing about trying Shake Shack, was the SHAKE!  I loved the mud slide flavor. Not too thick, not too watery, it was perfect right from receiving it. 

I liked the service to be honest, Clare was super nice and patient, explaining some menu items.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is cool and casual.  I liked the TV's and a big community table.  

Overall, I feel like it was something to try, might try it again if I am in Vegas, LA or even NY."}
{"text":"Went to shake shack with my two kids today. $41 bucks for three burgers, three small shakes and two fries. This isn't dining out it's fast food people. I could have taken them to In and Out twice for that amount. Not worth the price. This East coast joint will fizzle out."}
{"text":"1am, walking around Vegas and this green neon sign hanging off NY NY hotel is calling out my name....SHAKE SHACK!

Hungry, tired and hearing so many amazing things about Shake Shack I dragged the b-day girl with me. 

The menu is to the point but damn...all those shakes and malts and stuff looked hella good. But I wanted to focus on the burger first before indulging my sweet tooth and of course, I failed once I got to the counter. 

I ordered a single Shake Shack burger just as my starter and asked \"what is the best shake on the menu.\" The cashier offered the black & white...vanilla milk shake with fudge! oohhhh wiii! and yes, I caved in and added it to my order. I was sooo close to getting them cheese fries too.

I have to say, that is a really great tasting burger! Not as sloppy and big as In N Out, but it was fresh and meat was lean and juicy and that cheese melted so beautifully on top of that patty. 

The black n white shake was deeee licious! Thick and creamy, the fudge was a nice touch to the vanilla. The fudge wasn't over powering in taste either. 

As my first experience, I have to say it was good. I would like to try the actually New York Shake Shack to really say I had the true taste. and maybe not eat at 1am..."}
{"text":"The Double Shack Burger compares favorably with the In-N-Out Double Double, which is the highest praise I can conjure."}
{"text":"I don't get all the hype about this place. The food was greasy and just all around not good. The staff was rude and the food took way to long to come out for the crappy quality. There are so many other options in Vegas. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time, money or calories on this place."}
{"text":"First of all lets address the fact that people, myself included, often think to compare Shack Shack and In N Out. To me, that is subjective AF. If you compare the two you will definitely be disappointed because they are completey different type of burgers overall.

In N Out cooks their patties in a different style than Shake Shack making the flavors of the burgers entirely different. The burgers itself are smaller in comparison so minus 1 star for that and the service was average. This location has great seating and the restaurant is clean and beautiful.

I personally enjoyed my shroom burger very much and I enjoyed the taste of the fried portobello meatiness in every bite of my burger. It was juicy and cheese brought everything together. The patty is fresh and not greasy at all however it does takes more than one burger to get full. They even have a peanut butter burger!

Their double down fries were huge, so yummy, and totally hit the spot. Crinkle cut fries for the win!

Shake Shack please come to Northern California!"}
{"text":"We were so excited for Shake Shack to open at Kierland and we were so disappointed.  Service was slow and the food was not good.  I had the chicken dog, it was very dry and tasteless.  My husband had the cheeseburger - he said it tasted like it had sat for a while.  We waited 20 minutes to get our order for 2 sandwiches, one order of fries, one soda and a milkshake."}
{"text":"The best part about the Shake Shack at Kierland is the location. It is set in a wide open area with loads of outdoor seating that is perfect for winter afternoons in Arizona. There is also a ping pong table on the patio which kept kids constantly entertained. It's a very family friendly area in the heart of a very upscale shopping district. 

If you're going shopping in this area chances are prince is no objection, but for me Shake Shack is not enough bang for your buck. Yes, the food is good, but way over priced in my opinion. That being said, it's pretty fun to hit some of the most prime shopping in Scottsdale and fuel up on an organic burger while you're at it."}
{"text":"Went to New York and wanted to try Shake Shack, Unfortunately I was unable to go as the time just flew by! Now I have Shake Shack right in town! So naturally I had to try them out!  I had the Shack Stack, reg fries, a Shake of the week (s'mores), and since we went on Super Bowl sunday and awesome 50% off deal of the roadie with the Brew made especially for Shake Shack. The beer was called the ShackMeister Ale. I really do not like Ales at all but this stuff?! This I can drink lol! Very smooth and light tasting, a perfect compliment to the great burgers! Now the fries, the crinkle cut fries! They were delicious, crisp, crunchy, and awesome crinkle cut fries! The S'mores shake was an awesome blend with a chocolate base with marshmallows and bits, tasted great and I was a little sad when I finished it lol! Now the burgers! The Shack Stack is Their Burger with a crips fried portable mushroom stuffed with cheese! Wow!! It was awesome, the first bite is an explosion of cheese, mushroom, and burger! All blend so well and compliments each other with great balance. The Bun is soft and slightly chewy (awesome) and the bun is still connected on one side so all the burger, toppings, mushroom doesn't just go all over the place, Well thought out. It seems to be a very hip place to be I mean it is right there on the strip bringing in a lot of people which is a good thing! I hope Shake Shack stays for a very long time as I will return to try out their other options. Thank you for coming to vegas and giving us the Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars in my book. On par with or slightly better than Five Guys, Fat Burgers, or Smash Burger.

We tried Shack Stack, a cheeseburger with batter-fried portobello mushroom and ShackSauce, which was pretty good.

However, the regular ShackBurger was pretty boring, and the fries were less than average.

We took the nice patio seating and it was one of the best locations to have a quick bite, I must admit."}
{"text":"Awsome food! The chocolate shake is a must! Loved every bite , only thing I wish was that they had hot peppers but other then that nothing bad to say! You got tow try this place! Love shake shack!"}
{"text":"What is all tis hype coming from?  I'm a born and raised California girl and my good type of burger is a hearty In n Out cheeseburger.  

I was in town for the convention and friends on Facebook had recommended that I check out this place.  I typically trust their opinions so I shared a lunch and went to an early dinner here 


I ordered the custom shake shack burger and when j t came out, it left me with nothing.  It wasn't good.  I rather have ate a Big Mac.   

The reason I gave the place two stars is because the servers were professional and so friendly.  I won't be coming back or recommending this place."}
{"text":"Great burger with good service. Had the Smoke Shack and it was perfect.  The place wasn't too busy and service was quick.  The fries were good and I was very happy with my meal."}
{"text":"Preeetty good! Came in for a milkshake and their cheeseburger with portobello mushroom is now my go-to. That breaded mushroom with melty insides is awesome - it's like biting into a light mozzarella stick right along with the cheese burger! Flavorful and great texture!"}
{"text":"the lines are long but they move quick. The shackadog (chicago style) hot dogs at this place is even better than lot of places in chicago. The milk shake is also one of the best tasting, so much better than stake n shake shakes. And the fries are nice and crispy, not overly oily and soggy. Definitely recommend this place.


Oh, and the Hamburgers! The cornerstone of any nutritious lunch! I hear they've got some tasty burgers. I ain't never had one myself until today. *takes a bite* MmHmm! This IS a tasty burger. I asked my friend if she \"Want a bite? they're real tasty.\" I do love the taste of a good burger. Its so much better than Five guys. Id say in ohio shake shack comes first, big boy second, and Five guys third."}
{"text":"One thing I love in this world is a good burger.  This place did not disappoint.  I am strange and classify pizza places, burger places and BBQ places.  I have a Taxonomic rank for these types of places.  I can not compare a Memphis BBQ to a Texas BBQ because they are different. The same is with burger places too.  I can not compare a Habit, Hamburger Works to a Zinburger different types of places.  Pretty much different sports.  

When I say Shake Shack is good I am comparing to Five Guys, Freddys and Lennys.  

Now to the food after my after my craziness eccentric mind tries to explain how I think.  

The burger here is good.  They added a seasoning and it was good.  I got a bit of a salty bite, but just one.  The cheesy was nice and melted also.  The lettuce was fresh also.  The burgers are not large also.  I might recommend the double patty for the manly men.  
The French fries were okay, but I did not come here for fries.  

This place is good and I think most people will like it.  I am not sure what the hell a concrete is also.  I have to ask the next time I am there.  

I did not notice any soda fountain or tea dispensers in the dining area also. I do not drink tea or soda, so I am not sure if refills are included.

If you are wondering what my favourite burger place is you will not find it.  It was the burgers we would make when hunting or doing varmint control with my father and family.  We would use finely minced steak meat with the fat or hamburger if we had it (space limited and hard to keep cold).    Nothing fancy was added just salt, pepper and onions.  Get what ever wood was laying around and start a fire and lay a grill over it.  Lay them patties on the grill and wait.  Watch the fat drip off never depressing them once.  If we had cheese that was a plus (some times keeping food cold was a challenge) ice chest were not a nice as they are now.  Lay a slice of bread on the grill to warm it up (no hamburger buns space was limited and slice bread can be used for sandwiches too).  A variety box of chips with the little bags.  Eating that burger under the stars was better than any place here in town."}
{"text":"Attention, this a a PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: You must order THE SHAKE STACK BURGER! 

If you have left this place unsatisfied, it is because you did not listen to the message above. The Shake Stack comes with a beef patty AND a deep fried portobello mushroom that is stuffed with cheese! The breaded crust on the portobello mushroom is like the outer layer of a really good onion ring and gives it a nice crunch before hitting the hot cheesy center. That combined with a charbroiled beef patty, fresh tomatoes, lettuce - added pickles- is absolutely amazing!!!! 

Nothing beats the Shake Shack in NYC but it's still very good! Also a plus, the workers here are very nice, patient, and polite."}
{"text":"Burger was damn good and delicious black and white shake.  I would recommend doing a double as the patties are somewhat thin similar to in n out."}
{"text":"GET THE SHACK BURGER EXTRA CHEESE NO TOMATO! that is if you enjoy warm cheesy goodness. Seems like a better in and out burger. Just the burgers though. Cool place for late night meals. Affordable tasty. I would recommend this burger joint to meat and cheese lovers. A+++"}
{"text":"As usual, every time I go to Shake Shack, I get a Double SmokeShack, crinkle cut fries, and their shake of the week, if I like what it is. But that was in New York. So, naturally, once Shake Shack opened here in Vegas, I went back to my reliable order and was not surprised. 

Shack burgers are made with great quality beef, they use antibiotic and hormone-free Angus beef, I believe. And you can taste the quality of all of their other ingredients that make your meal. The burger is juicy, its cheesy, charred, and delicious.

Although the price point is a little high, I think the people who are skeptical of Shake Shack should at least give a try once."}
{"text":"Boy, after all the hype before this came, I was disappointed in the food and the atmosphere. It's super noisy, for starters, with loud music blaring, kids screaming and loud conversation with little to dampen the sound. We took our food outside and that was better. But the burger was pretty tasteless. It's hard to screw up a milkshake, though. I enjoyed it, but we won't go back after trying it once. I can get a better milkshake at many places."}
{"text":"Shack it is. I have never had food so tasteless. Ordered Cheese and Bacon Fries and a Blonde Beer. The beer was better than the fries. How hard can it be to use real cheese? Nasty."}
{"text":"I love shake shack but they don't have them in Pittsburgh so I always find one when in Vegas.  We always get the chicken sandwich which is very good but at this location was pretty salty.  The fries were fresh and hot and I had a salted caramel milkshake which was so thick I burned half the calories of it just trying to suck it through the straw.  

Overall food was off for me at this location. 

Location is in a nice area.  Restaurant is very clean. Service was good."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever at a Shake Shack Burger and prior to entering I was extremely excited due to their amazing reputation and the things some friends have said about it. With that being said, I was not that impressed. I honesty didn't like the buns they were really chewy and the burger tasted like something I could easily make at home. I'd rather get a double double at In-N-Out Burgers..."}
{"text":"I have been to this location once before and it was decent. The second time I went I ordered a shake burger with cheese and fries and a drink. I drove all the way to the hospital where my father was staying for a stroke and opened my food. My burger was almost completely raw on the inside! The fries were cold and I hadn't touched my drink yet. I called the manger to let them know and the solution was bring back the food and receipt. So I drove all the way back and spoke with manager. I didn't want a burger anymore was thinking chicken sandwich instead but that wasn't possible. I asked for a refund and they would only refund for burger and fry, not even the full amount for everything I paid for. I loved this place the first time but because of this experience I will not be back ever. Very upset because the customer service was just not there."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad burger here. I can't believe it when looking at it, but just one bite and it reminds me why I keep coming back. The fries aren't my favorite, but I've always enjoyed them."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of In-n-out so with all the Shake Shack hype, I was totally excited to try this place. Got a standard double shack burger, fries and a chocolate malt.  Burger was decent, seasoned well, bun was good.  Shack sauce is some kind of garlicky mayonaise.  I'm more of a mustard dude but it was ok.   Fries were your everyday crinkle cut fries, nothing special.  You can also get them with cheese which pretty much tastes like that canned cheese you get on nachos at the theater.  Where they failed me was the chocolate malt.   It had that over whipped foamy consistency like you get at a place like McDonald's.  I finally just threw it out.  Daughter had a concrete which looked nothing like the pictures.  Tiny little cup, half melted, with most of the cup being an empty hole from the blender.  At $46 bucks for a family of three, I wish we would of just took a cab to In-n-out."}
{"text":"Okay I'm not saying not to go. I'm not saying the burger wasn't good. But it was all just okay. Seriously all the hype and it was just okay. 

I got the single Shack burger, fries, and marshmallow chocolate chip shake. The burger wasn't bad, but it wasn't fantastic. I thought it was really small for how much it cost. Premium price little burger. Kinda of a rip off. Fries were ok, crispy. Shake was good. Tons of little chocolate chips. Had to share it. It was too much. 

Honestly 5 Guys or In n Out I'd say both are better burgers. Fries at 5 Guys rule. The shake was really good. But overall I was not overly impressed. 

Line goes fast, service was friendly, limited seating for the amount of people. Clean.

But if you want a really good burger then this will not be it. My dinner cost $15. Totally not worth that price. Go enjoy the hype and the first location in CLE but you won't be impressed. Other burgers are better."}
{"text":"Yummy burger place. I still prefer in and out. They sell everything separately, which never makes sense to me. Shakes were good. Cheese fries were very good! I can't say anything bad about this place. The price is a lil Pricey for a burger joint."}
{"text":"I'm a relatively frequent visitor to the City Center of the strip (Aria & Vdara) and I often find I need to grab a quick bite to eat before heading out on the town.  For me, a burger generally seems to fit the bill.  There are several burger joints near the City Center I have tried, which include Burger Lounge (inside of Aria) and Bobby's Burger Palace (located on the strip but close to Aria).  I'd never been to a Shake Shack before, so I strolled there from the City Center.  The walk takes about 15 minutes.  

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with my Shake Shack burger.  It was fresh and tasty, and the bun reminded me (by texture) of a King's Hawaiian roll (but not as sweet).  Adding bacon, made it even tastier.  Overall, in comparing the burgers served by Burger Lounge, Bobby's Burger Palace and Shake Shack, my vote goes to Shake Shack based upon taste and value."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd experience, first experience was in las Vegas. I've had both the burger and the dog.  I prefer the hotdog over the hamburger. But the cheese fries are the best!!! I appreciate fresh melted cheese instead of nacho cheese and that's exactly what they offer.  I'm not to pleased with the milk shakes."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend were excited to try shake shack we walked past it on numerous occasions and always said \"next time\". We went on a Friday night so there was a long wait which was understandable line moved fairly quickly though. Food was fresh the lettuce, pickles etc had a nice crunch to them and burger Patty was definitely fresh ground beef so quality was a + would I rave about it like most do? No, it reminded me of steak n shack or Freddy's so pretty similar burgers already in the market. As far as preference In n out is a better value for $$$, paid $20 for two burgers and ONE Fry. I'll walk across the street to in n out or ketchup in miracle mile shops to get a burger fix while in Vegas."}
{"text":"We came here before going to the movies and it was fantastic! I got the Bacon Cheddar Shack, which was delicious!! The melted cheese was the best melted cheese I have had in a long time. My husband got the Chicken Shack, which was also delicious. I am picky about chicken, but theirs was crunchy and had a great flavor. We will be back for sure, especially because they stay open until 11pm!"}
{"text":"Went to shake shack twice over my trip this weekend. Chicken burger was delicious! added cheese the second time and it made it even better. I also had the shack stack with the mushroom and the way they make the mushroom has gotta be my favorite thing in the world. Overall the experience was great. Didn't wait too long for the food and our cashiers were so nice to us."}
{"text":"Incredible gourmet-style burgers. The ShackBurger and SmokeShack are highly addictive. You can feel the premium quality beef and the ShackSauce blend is a winner! The portion size is adequate. You wouldn't expect anything less from a burger that costs $8-10! The bacon cheese fries also deserve a special mention, though pretty much anything on the menu is delish! The only minus is that they use soybean oil."}
{"text":"I drove 22 minutes to this place and was vastly disappointed. It took 20 minutes to get my food and it was terrible. I think the reason it took 20 minutes to make my food was because they were trying so hard to make it taste like shit. The \"shacksauce\" actually tasted like puréed placenta. And I have had placenta in my day because my wife kept it after she gave birth."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed.  I have been hearing about this chain for years!  We are finally getting one in Phoenix.  We saw they had one here in Vegas and decided to try it out.  

My burger was a very small, very greasy burger.  It's not the burger they showed on the tv show from NYC, that is for sure!  The shake was watery and not thick at all and not worth what you they charge.   By far, Smashburger wins hands down.  I hope this is simply a case of fast turnover on the strip being the issue.  I'll try the new one they are building in Scottsdale  and see if it lives up to the hype of the one actually in NYC. (fingers crossed!). French fries were very good but diners can't live on fries alone,lol."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas and my friend brought me to Shake Shack.  I had the regular cheeseburger and it was great.  Very soft bun!  A bit of a line up, but it moved quickly - and at such a popular place a line up is to be expected."}
{"text":"I didn't visit this location but our friends brought this to us to our hotel while staying in Vegas. These were some damn good burgers! I would say it lived up to the hype. I didn't care too much for their fries though."}
{"text":"I think this place might have been hyped a little but eh it was alright. Moderate prices but I think when each person described their experience, you honestly thought it was going to be the greatest thing you've ever eaten.  I enjoyed the burger, though thought it could have been bigger for the price and I think being as hungry as I was when I arrived, got me to fork over more than I wished for burgers, fries and two shakes. All in all, I liked their selection, though wish they had more choices of sides and that for what you paid the burger was a bit bigger or a little more flavorful, but eh its a hamburger. Probably on par with In-N-Out though some locations have lost their luster so at least on par with the better ones."}
{"text":"Food was really good quick service I ordered the shack burger it was amazing well cooked service was wonderful I will defiantly back"}
{"text":"Shake shake is prob one of my favorite burger joints! The meat is always tasty and cooked to perfection. I never really had to wait long. This place was clean, awesome service and doggie friendly at the patio area. The shake stack shroom with cheeseburger is the ultimate mushroom burger!! Soo good!"}
{"text":"Best burger is town; however, quite pricey for the size of the burger (similar in size to in-n-out, but double the price). Fries are mediocre and the custard, concrete style mixer was \"meh\". When I commented on the shake size to an employee, he responded \"it's custard, so it fills you up more\".

This is my cheat meal of choice, but usually only get the burger \"to go\" and get fries elsewhere."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at the first shake shack in Ohio. We came just around lunchtime on a Tuesday, and surprisingly, they weren't really that busy at all. I ordered a single hamburger with just shack sauce on it and a root beer float. All the staff was super friendly and accommodating; definitely above and beyond what I would expect from a fast food restaurant. They also do a really good job of keeping things moving without making you feel rushed. Our food was ready just around the time we managed to find a table. 

I thought the burger overall was pretty good. To be honest, the actual patty didn't seem that much different than what you would find at steak n shake. However, all elements considered, this was many times better than any Steak 'n Shake I've been too. I'm usually extremely picky about the bun when it comes to my burgers, and this one earned my approval. I think my favorite part of the burger was the shack sauce. I'm not exactly sure what's in it, and I can't really think of anything to compare it too... maybe a zesty mayo? Either way, I wish I could buy that stuff in a bottle as I'd probably put in on just about everything. The root beer float really good as well.

Like I said, I really enjoyed my experience at the Shake Shack. I'll definitely be back in the near future to try some other menu items, as well as see if I can't swipe the secret recipe for that shack sauce."}
{"text":"I got the regular hamburger and my husband got the chicken burger. The burgers are very tasty but they're way too small for the price!! I also feel like they're a little to smushy for me. I like in n out waaaaaay more. The chicken burger was better than the hamburger and if were to go back I would get the chicken burger for sure!"}
{"text":"This may not be a fair rating because I've had Shake Shack in New York, but the Vegas one is not as good as those in New York! Why is that? According to Japanese research waiting in line for food makes us think that the food tastes better. Perhaps this was the case because I remember waiting 30min in line in New York, but didn't wait at all in Vegas. However the fact that we had been pregaming before this Vegas Shake Shack visit and still found my Shake Stack burger underwhelming says something. The Shake Stack burger I had has a fried mushroom filled with melted cheese. I know, it sounds amazing, and it is, but the one I had here was not as good as the one I remember from New York. My friend ate a massive burger with loads of bacon and burger, but it was too much meat and too greasy for me to enjoy."}
{"text":"Burgers are good. Taste is there. Fries are incredible. Only drawback is burgers are a bit small."}
{"text":"Eh. It was ok--definitely didn't live up to hype. Burger is very similar to In-and-Out. Vanilla shake was above par. The tables and floors were filthy though. More staff attending to the dining room and table recovery wouldn't go amiss."}
{"text":"We tried this place while on the strip in vegas. It was a Wednesday night and it was packed. The restaurant has ample seating, but even so, we were lucky in finding a spot on this visit.

I ordered a veggie mushroom burger(trying to step out of the box) cheese fries and a peanut butter and chocolate concrete. First off, the burger was abit on the small side for the cost. My first bite was just bread and the mushroom, which has good flavor, but abit dry. On the second I got the cheese and that was an amazing bite. The cheese fries were delicious and spot on. The desert was ok, not bad but definitely not the best shake type dessert I've ever had.

The food here was good and worth a visit for. They also have a large selection of draft beers to choose from. I will probably return if I'm back in vegas."}
{"text":"I love shake shack! I'm not exactly sure why there is so much hate on this location. The employees are sure nice and they hustle. The food is always good. They have ample indoor and outdoor seating. It makes no sense why it's scoring so low. This location lettuce wraps and it's a solid wrap, no sloppy like they hate that you asked them to. The Shack burger is my favorite because I can't eat the breaded chicken sandwich. Last night we came in and the wait was pretty long once we had placed our order. I didn't complain because we were there as a family just chatting away. When I buzzed I collected our food and there was a card for a free chicken sandwich and a free Shake burger, that was cool. How can you not go away happy?"}
{"text":"THEY DO MALTS! 

In my world, Malts are GREATER THAN Shakes, so I was pumped to see that option available. Of course you know I ordered a Chocolate Malt with my Burger & Fries (Crinkle Cut action!). Everything tasted really fresh and delicious. The place reminds me more of TrueBurger (Oakland) than In N Out...and they're all good in my book, plus different in their own unique ways. Shake Shack is a little more pricey than In N Out, though, so there's that. But I'd come here again in a heartbeat. 

ALSO: don't let the seemingly long line out the door fool you. They move people through that line real fast. We only waited about 15 minutes before it was our turn to order, and the food came out quickly too. 

I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Well Im glad they put a restaurant rather than a retail shop on this popular corner here at The District at Green Valley Ranch. The set up is really nice meet up place for friends and family gatherings.

Overpriced? Depends. If you care about quality, source and sustainability practices then no it's not overpriced.  With all the Jags, Benz and Audis that fill up the parking lot, I doubt they're complaining. But if those reasons are not a priority, then yes, value wise it's C minus. 

First visit I tried their speciality concrete for this location..it had bits of cupcake from the Cupcakery.  7 on the taste scale. 2 on the visual appeal scale....it was a melted mess. And that was even before it left the counter.

Not digging my second experience here, the cashier that just handled money, just made my rootbeer float without washing her hands first.  It was more a rootbeer drink since it was lacking more ice cream. Other than that, the staff here are really enthusiastic and helpful and the wait in line wasnt too bad. Overall impression, not impressed with the glorified fast food."}
{"text":"i am a fan! too bad this place is in vegas.. very pricey but understandable.. they have a fried portabello mushroom inside the shack stack so you can see why they charge what they charge.. it's not just patty cheese veggies n bread.. they fancy.. you cannot compare this to in and out because they are different.. you can compare this to five guys and they totally kill em.. the shakes are weird though b/c it's just like in n  out.. not cold enough.. we also had the cheese fries.. YUM YUM! cant wait to get my hands on this place again"}
{"text":"Their milkshakes bring all the tourist to their shack, cause it's better than in n out. Bomb shakes & custard, bomb burgers & bomb fries. Spent 3 days in Vegas and ate here 2 of the 3 days. Lines are long, but it goes by soooo fast! They hand out menus to look at while you wait in line. You can tell the patties are made fresh because my burger patty was a little thicker than my boyfriend's. The burger was nice and juicy and had the right amount of their sauce on it. And the fries went well with it. Usually crinkle fries are soggy, but theirs had a nice crunch to it. I'm probably gonna plan another Vegas trip soon ... :]"}
{"text":"I thought the food was fair but overpriced for a family meal it shouldn't cost 80$ for four to eat. Service was good."}
{"text":"Wasn't that impressed with Shake Shack.  The milkshake tasted a lot like Hershey's syrup.  The cheese fries were nice, but seemingly pretty low quality.  The burger was nothing special.    I did like that they had a frozen custard dog treat item, though (the dog liked this as well).

I'd rate Shake Shack toward the bottom of the list of \"premium fast food burgers\":

1)  In-N-Out (highest quality)
2)  Whataburger (most flavour)
3)  Burger Lounge
4)  Five Guys
5)  Shake Shack"}
{"text":"Good food but overpriced for Arizona. Yes, it's in Scottsdale, but still New York prices are ridiculous for a burger place. Maybe Shake Shack should take a hint from the fact that Barney's New York just closed in the mall. Sorry, but with the abundance of other good burger places in Scottsdale there's no reason to pay steak prices for a hamburger."}
{"text":"Hamburger place for a snack . Better than the national chain burger places. Burgers were average tasting with lettuce tomato etc. Drinks had too much ice and need to order the large size."}
{"text":"I visited this place for the first time tonight and it was great! Jessie was our cashier and she was awesome. So cheerful and customer service oriented! After talking to us, another customer asked for a refill. Jessie happily agreed and even asked if the woman wanted more ice. It's simple but an extra touch nonetheless. The grub doesn't disappoint either- we got the smokehouse burger, a cheeseburger, fries, and custard of course. YUM"}
{"text":"Have you ever wondered if worldwide expansion might ruin one of life's great pleasures and treasures, Shake Shake? This location provides a definitive \"yes\" to that question. I love the Shack. I've been rocking shackburgers since the original location in the park was the one and only. I have eaten at Shacks in Cambridge, DC, and West Hollywood. Never had a bad experience until today.

The defining technique and characteristic of a Shackburger is the smash on the hot grill to create that beautiful Maillard crust. But the burger I got today was grey all the way through. No crust, no contrast of texture, just a grey, mushy mess on a potato roll. And mine was not an anomaly. When I was waiting at the counter for nearly five minutes for my order (despite the fact that my buzzer had buzzed) I noticed one burger after another coming out similarly. I don't know if the griddle (which I believe are top of the line) was not properly heated, or the griddles were not properly trained in the smash, or what, but the burgers coming out today were epic fails. Extremely disappointing, Shake Shack.

UPDATE: Gave this location another shot this weekend, and got the kind of tremendous burger one can usually expect from the Shack - one of my best Shake Shack experiences ever, in fact. Updating the review to four stars as an average. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"The burger was great! The hot dog was great! Who doesn't love crinkle fries? I suggest visiting this location now because as soon as the stadium opens it will be super packed!"}
{"text":"Given all the hype I've heard about Shake Shack, I had very high expectations for my first visit. I went with the single shackburger, fries, and vanilla shake. As I had skipped breakfast, I was definitely hungry and could not wait for that first bite. It was good, but it did not stand out to me (or my husband) as anything special. If we had to rank the burger, it would come in behind In N Out and Smashburger. My favorite thing was the shake - delish!  Also, our bill was over $40, which I thought was a lot to spend on lunch at a fast food burger joint. Otherwise, the staff was super friendly and efficient, the dining area was clean, and I enjoyed the decor/ambiance. I may stop in again if I'm back in the area, but wouldn't make the drive from Gilbert just to experience Shake Shack."}
{"text":"I have been to New York city several times and never got a chance to try Shake Shack.  Therefore, I was excited when they opened up 2 locations in Scottsdale.  

I ordered my food on the Shake Shack app ahead of time.  The app was easy to use, and it made pick up at the restaurant very easy.  However, I have heard complaints that coupons do not work well on the app. 

I tried the Shack Stack and the Smoke Shack.  The Smoke Shack is a very average bacon burger with the addition of cherry peppers.  On the other hand, the Shack Stack is nothing like I have ever had, and I would highly recommend it.  It has a cheese stuffed fried mushroom which they place on top of the burger patty. 

The cheese fries were decent.  The cheese sauce has a nice creamy texture but it is very mild in flavor.  I actually prefer a sharper cheddar taste and would rather have the cheese fries at Portillo's or Corleone's down the street since both have a strong, richer cheese flavor.

The cookies and cream milkshake was too sweet and sugary, and I also did not enjoy the texture/consistency of it. It was also pricey at $5 for a shake.. Overall everything was pretty average but I would come back for the Shack Stack or maybe try a hotdog."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to visit while making a stop in Las Vegas! Smoked stacked was a great choice as well as the cheese fries. Only gets a knock off due to I wished the burgers were a little bigger. Otherwise come on down!"}
{"text":"I've heard so much hype over shake shack and finally after months of waiting we made it. We ordered a simple cheeseburger with fries and a sundae. The burger tasted like it came off the Wendy's grill! The fries were not anything special with no flavor. And also the ice cream was vanilla sprinkled with sprinkles. This place was over hyped and not worth $33 for food that tasted like Wendy's!"}
{"text":"the \"in-n-out\" of the East Coast. I can see the hype as much as I can see what the in-n-out fuss is all about. 

the beef was seasoned & cooked to perfection. the bread was not as filling so you're able to enjoy a delicious burger without regret. 

I must admit, I am highly impressed with the outcome. Shake Shack, like In-N-Out offers a small variety of their best burgers. I would give it another go when in Vegas."}
{"text":"My first time ever at a Shake Shack! I love this location because there was no line when we arrived during the opening act. The burger was tasty and the strawberry shake was standard but good. Our cheeseburgers were also pretty standard, but kind of a nice break from the ridiculous portions served by most other places in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Shake Shack, so we had to try it out on our most recent trip. We got a Smoke Stack (minus the cherry peppers), a Shack Stack, the chili cheese fries, two drinks, and a chocolate cookies and cream shake. It came out to $40, which was definitely a bit steep for the amount of food you get. However, the food was delicious! The Shack Stack (a burger AND a fried, cheese-filled Portabella mushroom) was so good. I'm not usually a fan of chili cheese fries, but these were fantastic. The shake was rich and creamy, and the strawberry mint lemonade was really refreshing. If the prices were a little more reasonable, I would have given this a perfect score."}
{"text":"Shack Shack was good but not worth the $10 for the sandwich only. Service was nice and burger was ready quick considering the location.  Possible second try in the future."}
{"text":"This was my first time there The burgers really aren't that special should have gotten the double but them fries tho. Wow they were great and it's a nice atmosphere inside."}
{"text":"I've seen a lot of youtube videos making comparisons between Shake Shack vs In N Out burgers.  Coming into Las Vegas, NV, I thought I give it a try.  The food came out pretty fast.  I ordered the Smoke Shack with cheddar bacon fries and a drink.  The burger was pretty bland and did not have a lot of taste.  The only saving grace for this burger was the bacon.  The fries looked like they were previously frozen but had a nice crisp to it.  The fries had cheddar cheese with bacon sprinkled on it but tasted pretty rich and heavy.  Because of that, I didn't finished it.  The drink I had is standard for Coke, but I had to go to the counter to get my complimentary refill because the soft drink dispenser is not in the dining room.  Verdict on taste of food, specifically the burger, I would rate the food as average.  In N Out wins hands down on burger comparison based on taste."}
{"text":"It's an iteration of in n out style burger joints. The food is pretty alright but the portions of the food is disproportional to their prices (but it's also the strip). 

I advise against that horrid custard sundae bucket they sell. I remember it tasting like regret and the 16 dollars I'll never see again."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite or snack while cruising the strip. The custard shakes are wonderful."}
{"text":"Over priced spent $30 for 2 burgers and 2 frys , for 2 people and left hungry , 
burgers are small and not filling .

will never go back.

Over priced"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Ohio!!!!  Everything is great and I'm so happy that they finally brought a shake shack to Ohio!"}
{"text":"We stopped in after the NHL awards since we were starving!!  The line seemed like it would take forever however they got us through really quick.  Ordered two burgers and chili cheese fries.  The burgers were fantastic.  They sort of reminded me of 5 guys burgers, but better.  I could have done without the chili cheese fries, the cheese was kinda gross to me (but I also wasn't feeling so great with the heat).  The restaurant itself isn't as small as it appears and you can generally find seating.  If it wasn't 118 degrees out, I could have sat outside as there is plenty of places.  Overall I would return to shake shack again."}
{"text":"Get the chicken shack and fries with cheese on the side  this place isn't In n Out, but the chicken shack is delicious. The workers here are always really sweet too!"}
{"text":"Shake shack is a must, so the seating kinda sucks, but well worth the wait.  The crinkle-cut cheese fries are just like the one aunt lupe used to make at the little league snack bar"}
{"text":"So many people hyped up this place for me and it fell short for me. Maybe I ordered the wrong things but there wasn't anything that stood out to me. I ordered the smoked stacked burger with fries and a strawberry shake.I love how the patty is cooked and it tastes like a fresh off the grill type of burger. The servings are really small and the milkshake was watered down...kind of reminded me of a McDonald's milkshake. 

Maybe I'll return and order something different but I probably pick in n out over this."}
{"text":"Being a SOCAL resident, In N Out has always been #1. After experiencing Shake Shack, In N Out is still #1!! 

Shake Shack's menu is way too long and the food tastes alright. This location in particular being in vegas might be the reason for the abnormally long line at 3pm in the afternoon on a Sunday and the reason why it's ridiculously expensive."}
{"text":"Hmm.. where shall I start.. My heart has and always will be for In-N-Outs, but while on the other coast, my choices were slim. Sorry Five guy's you are not up to par. So what was I left with, my ever starving cravings for nice juicy patties, soft buns, nice filling's of lettuce, tomatoes and pickles. Shake Shake was always there. I would religiously take my weekend pilgrimage to Battery Park to enjoy those morsels of goodness and watch a flick or two. I was happy to take a little trip to Vegas and low and behold my East Coast memories flooding back to me. Shake Shake is there waiting for me to enjoy it once again. I am a fan and will continue to pay my homage to this delicious burgers and ohhh the shakes and frozen custards always hits the spot on those hot and muggy days. For Las Vegas those hot and dry days :)"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas on vacation and was looking for something late night to eat. Shake Shack popped up and was being compared to In-n-out. So I had to try, In-n-out is my baby I love me some in n out about 3 times a month. (that is a conservative Number) #dontjudgeme. Anywho I went and ordered my food service was rather quick for it being busy and when I took that first bite I instantly had a food boner. It is really delicious, better than in n out I dont know. They both have distinct taste both are very delicious, and would go back again!!!!"}
{"text":"We ate there for Lunch on my Daughters Birthday and I came down with food poisoning.    They need to clean their shake machine.  Since my husband got a little sick from the two swallows and I had it for four days because I drank the whole shake.    Don't bother reporting it to them, because they don't care and would not do anything for you."}
{"text":"The staff was great about comping our runners perk from the Rock & Roll Marathon. The cheese fries with bacon & sweet peppers are a must have! Yes In-N-Out has better prices but not safe to walk to the Tropicana location near the Strip after the sun goes down."}
{"text":"So yummy, I always go when I'm in NY. I've been to the one in WEHO and that one is always busy. I was surprised when they built one in Phx. We went early afternoon on a Saturday, was pretty dead which was awesome. Got the usual, fries and a shack burger. It was amazing as usual. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I am in a wheel chair due to a broke ankle and a worker offered to take our buzzard and pick up and deliver our food. She even gave us ketchup. Super nice and didn't have to do that. I definitely recommend this place and I'm happy it's close to my parents house so I can indulge when I come to Phx to visit!!!"}
{"text":"I love their burgers and fries but the customer service needs improvement. Great price and no waiting. I guess it's all about timing."}
{"text":"I don't get all the bad reviews! I really enjoyed this place. 

I stopped in on a Friday night right before the dinner rush so my wait was short. The cashier was kind and patient as I asked questions and ordered my food. 

I ended up going with the ShackBurger and fries with a chocolate milkshake. 

The burger was delicious! It was cooked up hot and fresh and had great flavors. I'd absolutely recommend this! The french fries are crinkle cut and delicious. I enjoyed them plain today but they also offer cheese and bacon which I might try next time! 

The milk shake was so thick and yummy. I added whip cream...because what's a milkshake without it? And it added a nice touch. I'd recommend grabbing a spoon to enjoy it. 

I also tried the hotdog with all the fixings. I really enjoyed it. 

Everything was delicious! I can't wait to come back. I also can't wait to try using the app and grabbing a mobile order so I don't have to wait in line."}
{"text":"Wow I heard good things about this place but given I'm not a big burger guy I was hesitant.  Well they proved me wrong. Who knew a cheeseburger could taste so good? That plus the cheese fries and shake options can't be beat! 

The service was top notch too and the outdoor area has a lot of seating.  Oh and they also serve booze!!! Giddyup!"}
{"text":"For being on the Vegas Strip, Shake Shack has fantastic prices. The location is modern, clean and has the same quality as other Shake Shack locations. The line can be long but they move it quickly and efficiently. The staff is nice and there is a line for MGM invited guests to save time. You can also redeem your receipt for M-Life rewards to earn comps. This is a well run location that is very modern, clean with high quality food."}
{"text":"To be quite honest, shake shack is one of the only reasons why I want to go back to Vegas... Don't get me wrong I do love shake shacks everywhere ESP in DC and NYC. The shack stack is where it's at.  The cheese fries are always on hit. Black and white shake is nearly perfect every time. I love you shake shack, marry me."}
{"text":"Wow!! Mind blown!! These little burgers were tasty and the blk and white shake was soooo good!! I just want to eat this everyday!  I can't wait to return and try a different burger and shake combo!  This location also has a beautiful view, very spacious and service was quick!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO! Expense, can't rate service because there is none! Want a great hamburger? Go to Red Robin!!"}
{"text":"I loved Shake Shack at NYC and I love them in Vegas.  Tasty burgers, crinkle cut fries, and great shakes.  I usually go for the bacon cheeseburger, but you really can't go wrong with any of them.  

This location can get pretty busy, but the lines move fairly quickly and hopefully you could get a seat inside during the summer.  If you're looking for a good burger that's on the strip, head over to Shake Shack.  I read a lot of reviews pointing towards Innout.  I'm one of the biggest Innout fan out there, but I'm not driving off the strip to get something I could easily get at home."}
{"text":"I just have to say that these are by far the best burgers that I've have so far and I've had a lot of burgers lol. I'm sure it is because of the type of grass fed beef they use and fresh bread. Please try this place out."}
{"text":"We came here for quick snack. The menu was nice and simple.- Not overwhelming with choices but a good variety. 
Given that we were here on vacation, we decided to order a little more then just a \"burger\". We got the stack shack + bacon cheddar fries. This meal did not disappoint. The burger was juicy and full of flavour. The mushroom and melted cheese topped it off. Probably the best burger ive ever had. Simple but yet delicious. The fries were good too- Cheese was nice and hot. 
The service there was very friendly. 
Only drawback was the shake. Ive heard great things about it, but i couldnt try it because there is no lactose free option. Not their fault, but it wouldve made my shake shack experience complete. Nonetheless, top notch burger joint."}
{"text":"East Coast. . . West Coast. . .will always be a factor.

5 stars for letting MLife Platinum and Noir card holders to skip the line! 

Came here for lunch right before our flight.  The line was out the door and then some.  The service was fast and friendly.  I like the fact you can \"build\" your burger with fried portabella mushrooms. We ordered the crinkled fries, a regular shake shack style burger and lemonade.  All pretty good.  The bread was sweet and delicious!

What a perfect place to be located, NY NY hotel.  Also nostalgic for me, since I had my first taste of shake shack in NYC."}
{"text":"I had never been u til today but the food was amazing. And wow that is probably the best shake I have ever had. I was not impressed by the staff but it's fast service and the do not focus on a customer service experience from table to table."}
{"text":"I first heard about Shake Shack back in the early 2000's from friends in NYC so I was excited when they finally opened locations in Phoenix and Scottsdale.

The burgers, fries, and shakes are certainly good, but I wish they'd opened here years ago, because with the explosion of burger restaurants nationwide that is no longer an uncommon thing to find. 

Hopdaddy, Habit, Smashburger, Five Guys, and In-N-Out all provide burgers that are equally as good and at a much more reasonable price. Heck, even The Counter in California seemed cheaper.

Sure it's fine to promote that you are from New York, but I'm not willing to pay New York prices for a burger that I'm still eating in Phoenix.

Overall Shake Shack is good, but overpriced."}
{"text":"We were craving ice cream and decided to try out Shake Shack, which is apparently a big deal on the East Coast.  The line was fairly long and they were getting things out really, really slow.  At least they are reasonably priced.  We got out with a root beer float and a concrete for under $12.  

The concrete was the wrong flavor, but with how long the wait and lines are there is no way I'm going to go back and ask for it to be fixed.  It was decent, but I think if it had been the flavor I wanted (and like), it would have been much better.  The root beer float was disappointing.  ~$6 for some root beer and 2 small scoops of ice cream is lame.  My girlfriend wasn't too impressed with it either and ended up tossing it out half full.  Something she never does.

If they could speed things up and deliver the right order they would be worth visiting as they charge somewhat reasonable prices on a lot of things."}
{"text":"Raspberry cheesecake shake was amazing! Burgers were good, place was Clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Organic chicken sandwitch boom! It's good in every bite. Soft and a little crispy bread followed by juicy flavoring chicken bam!!!! So good! It had a few of the burgers including the mushroom and it's all good."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a burger person because I hate dry, tasteless burgers, so when I walked into Shake Shack, I wasn't expecting much at all. Boy, was I wrong. The wait was short (we went around 1pm on a Tuesday) and the workers were all friendly and cheerful. The burgers: Amazing!! The shakes: Ridiculous!!!

I loooove these burgers. I got the Smoke Shack burger. It's so moist and the bun is perfectly toasted, but still soft on the inside. The patty tastes homemade and it's nowhere close to being described as \"dry\"--and the bacon was on-point.

And the shake...I'm a TOTAL shake person and this frozen custard shake is hands down my FAVORITE. It was so good, I was wishing they had larger sizes instead of just the one size. I was even tempted to go back the next morning and get another shake, that's how good it is! Sadly, my shuttle to the airport arrived before Shake Shack opened at 11am.

All in all, this place is amazing and I will totally be back every single time I go to Vegas from here on out!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here I wish we had a location in LA. Service is great the manager was on top of things when we were there and the food was out in no time. The coffee shake is a must have."}
{"text":"If you're like me and feeling nostalgic for New York, but Las Vegas is a much easier trip for you, Shake Shack is the place to eat. There is a lot of seating, tables inside and picnic tables outside. I had the Shack Stack (beef patty, mushroom patty, and cheese), cheese fries, and the fall special pumpkin concrete. It was a very good meal. I was stuffed afterward. (And yet I still had room for a crèpe inside New York New York... I come to Vegas ready to eat!) Next time, I would probably try a different burger. The Shack Stack is good-- I like mushrooms, but they're not always my favorite, so the mushroom patty could be overpowering. I would like to try the Smoke Shack with bacon. The concrete was good, but I didn't know that concrete was ice cream, so I was expecting a shake. The cheese fries- delish. I would love to return here any time I'm on the Las Vegas strip."}
{"text":"This was my second time ever eating at Shake Shack. This first time was downtown Chicago amidst a blizzard. So I have to say, eating in sunny Scottsdale already boosted my experience. Last time I ate SS, I ordered the most obscure menu item the Chicken dog: no fries. no shake. I honestly think I was on a diet. 

Shake Shack is not a place you go with vegan girlfriends after hot yoga. And once you just let that go and indulge, you will order a Shack Burger, a side of fries and shake like a normal person. Being normal sometimes leads you to tasty things. No guilt here. 

Shake Shack does it right. The menu is short, simple and satisfies. I didn't think it was over the top amazing. But its classic, and they do classic well."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Family liked as well.  Had Burger.  Girls had Chicken    Finished off with a shake.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"I hadn't had Shake Shack in 5 years, since I moved back from NY. I have to say, I was impressed even more than I expected. The burger was fantastic, the chicken sandwich also, and the fries are SO much better than In N Out it's absurd. I really wish this place wouldn't make me buy a plane ticket to get my fix..."}
{"text":"My favorite burger.

Hamburgers are a pretty personal thing...it's really not possible to say one's \"the best\" but I think a Yelp review can point out what's good about it.

The burger is thin, but moist inside. It's \"well-seasoned\" (some might say \"salty\"). The bun is fresh and fluffy. The sauce is tangier than the usual 1000 island sauce on most burger. Tomatoes are small, but very red and firm. Lettuce is crisp. It's a nice package. Note that I left off the onions and pickles.

Crinkle cut fries are good, but a bit dry. The cheese sauce definitely adds flavor!

Vanilla shake was very good, as well.

Need ice, though, to go along with the water dispenser.

Hoping for an Orange County, CA location soon...please...soon!!"}
{"text":"Closer to Smashburger than to InNOut or The Habit with the style of their burger. Not as thin as SB, but flavorful and not as much salt.

Crinkle cut fries seem to be the trend now. SS's are very good, made with a crispy coating; tip: dip in the SS sauce! 

Shakes are the star. Vanilla malt and peanut butter shake excellent.

The quick serve concept is good. No need to wait for the server. 

Hope to visit one closer to home soon!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced for ordinary food. Burgers taste like the ones from Wendy's. I think they are more famous for their shakes. Looking around the place, the feeling was mutual among nearby customers: \"not sure what the hype is all about, LOL\"."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try and now its my favorite burger joint in town.
I ordered the Shack Burger, double, cheese fries and a Purple Cow float which is a float with Grape Fanta."}
{"text":"Only ate at the summerlin location once but ordered the portabello burger and remember loving it and wanting to go back. For me, having a cravable item is my seal of approval.  Everything else was good, but not memorable."}
{"text":"Completely overrated.  Burgers are good, but small.  They're actually deceiving in how they're presented...small in reality.  Tried the chicken sandwich and it just tasted greasy without much flavor.
*****UPDATE*****
Management sends a canned response.  Just dropped to 1 star."}
{"text":"The burgers - YUM! The sauce - YUM! The fries - YUM! What more can a burger fanatic like myself say? If you are in Vegas, this spot is a MUST! Absolutely loved it and wish they had these here in Charlotte. : ("}
{"text":"I thought that the burgers were just ok. I have to say I love In-n-out more, BUT the cheese fries are amazing here!!! Definitely get that! The wait isn't too bad, but I would not come back again  as the burgers aren't anything too special or extraordinary."}
{"text":"We went to many fine dining places in Vegas- Shake Shack was the best meal we had. I think that says it all. Save your money! Be happy! Eat a burger!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack burgers are a must have!  The fries and shakes are great.  Even though the fries are really just McCain's fries heated up...They're great!"}
{"text":"The chicken burger and chili cheese fries are bawm . The staff were nice and the food was prepared quickly so the long lines go quick."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, not TOO pricy. 30$ for 2 burgers, fries, drinks, and shakes. Gets really crowded since it's on the strip. The place is kind of small, so everyone is scouring for a table. The line is usually long, but I recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"So glad I finally made it to Shake Shack to see what all the hype was about! I went on a Wednesday at 2pm for a late lunch and fortunately didn't have a line. On first impression, I was surprised at the price of the burgers. For some reason, I thought they would be more \"fast food\" priced. I got a burger, chicken sandwich, fries and concrete. I've heard really good things about the mushroom burger and may try it next time. The chicken sandwich surprised me, very tasty and nice and crispy. The crinkle fries won me over in a heartbeat. And the concrete, oh the concrete. SO DELICIOUS! I could eat that all day. They had two flavors to choose from (a cookie dough toffee or chocolate one). The toffee cookie butter was delicious. I'm already dreaming about another one!"}
{"text":"Okay so my first experience: let's talk about the pros
The restaurant was clean, beautifully decorated, and the staff were all using gloves. 
The service was professional and nice 

Now the cons: 
I paid 27.00 for one large drink, a shack stack burger, a BBQ burger, and one cheese fries. 
I did not like the shack stack burger, it had a cheeseburger as well as a deep fried portobello muchroom stuffed with 2 types of cheese. Should of known the burger was going to be cheesy. So I switched it out for the burger with red pepper and it wasn't that great either. The problem with the burgers are is that the ingredients don't have a balance. The first one was too cheesy the second one tasted too vinegary from the peppers. The size of burgers were tiny? They are too pricy for the portion. I was not impressed by the food, only the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wanted to see what the hype was about, as some people said it was better than In and Out.
After comparing the two I would have to give the win to In and Out.  The burger was smaller here and to me didn't have the better taste.  Also pretty pricey for what you get.  Small bacon burger was $7.99.  Add on the small shake and fries and total was just under $17.  The only thing better here than In and Out was the fries.  Don't think I'd come back for a burger but may for one of their shakes."}
{"text":"Awesome everything! I had the Single SmokeShack. Not too big, not too small. The chopped cherry peppers gave the SmokeShack a unique, somewhat spicy kick to it! Very tasty indeed! Others had the ShackBurger and 'ShroomBurger and no one was disappointed. Some compare it to In-and-Out Burger, but Shake Shack's burgers are \"flavored.\" I would guess their Hamburger might be the closest thing to an In-and-Out burger. The fries are fresh and crispy. I didn't think the Cheese Fries or Bacon Cheese Fries were anything special as they could've used more toppings. The chocolate and vanilla Shakes were just the right thickness for straw versus spoon usage. The Concretes were a Blizzard-done-right -- mixed perfectly -- softer than ice cream, yet firmer than frozen yogurt. Service was fast, yet pleasant. Turnover is fairly quick and tables were wiped down immediately."}
{"text":"This is a trendy, but very affordable and tasty dining option along the Vegas Strip. We both got cheeseburgers that just melted in your mouth. The place seems new, clean, and inviting with many comfy places to sit including a nice outdoor seating area where you can people watch along the Strip. It's easy to order and the service is friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Since I never visited a Shake Shack, I couldn't wait for it to open in Kierland commons.  Stopped by about 12:10pm today for lunch expecting a crowd since its only been open for about 2 weeks.  I was very surprised by the small number of people there.  Only 2 people ahead of me in line.  I ordered a double cheeseburger and French Fries for a total cost of $11.08.  My LED beeper finally went off along with 3 other people.  We were all standing there, but no food.  Finally 1 tray shows up and the clerk yells out \"number 5\".  The four of us looked at each other baffled.  Why did they ask for our name and then call out a number.  What's the point of the LED beeper.  I had to get my receipt out of my pocket to check my number.  It was mine.  I went outside to sit down to eat.  As I looked at the burger it seemed small.  Sure enough they only gave me a single burger when I order a double.   I had to go back inside,  I was greeted quickly by an employee asking me if something was wrong.  I told him and he quickly got me the correct order, so I thought.  It was missing the onions this time, but I just let it go.
  As far as taste it was just ok.  I don't really see what all the hype is about. At  In N Out you can get a double double with cheese for about half the price of the Shake Shack cheeseburger.  Definitely not worth it. I can't see shake shack lasting at Kierland commons.  Rent is high and they won't get the traffic they are expecting.  In about 1.5 years from now I bet they close up because they can't turn a decent profit if and at all. 

Stick to IN N Out my Friends.  too many burger joints have come and gone in AZ."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced, but I guess that's Vegas (not sure how they're priced in other locations though). I came here around 10:50am and there was already a long line outside! American breakfast for ya!!!

The Shack Stack burger is soooo good. It comes with a \"shroom burger\" which is literally a fried mushroom and cheese patty -- YUUUUMMM! I added bacon in my burger for a little more artery-clogging goodness. I also really liked the mango lemonade. I wish I had a bigger appetite for the frozen custard, but I'll come back another time. :)"}
{"text":"So my friends have been raving about Shake Shack even before our trip started.  My closest buddies were planning to have lunch there, and my game plan was to meet them at this specific restaurant--which initially made me think, this place must be the bomb. 

We all came here for lunch on Saturday afternoon after a night of crazy shenanigans.  Located right on the Strip, part of the NY NY property, there was no line--very lucky and surprised for a Saturday afternoon.

We placed our orders, and waited for a good ten minutes (much shorter than what I thought since it was crazy busy inside).  I will say that getting a table here is quite difficult because of the massive crowds, however people do get up and leave and that's the time to grab any table, essentially, when dining with 9 other people.  

The burgers are to die for, in my opinion.  Sure, it's not a $20 burger, but for the price, this beats In N Out.  The fries are so-so, but hey, the most important item on the menu is the burger right?  The volume is quite thick, and one can easily get full of the one burger.  

I must say that it was so fulfilling, and it was actually a nice place to eat.  It's got a young crowd to it.  

So the most important question, as maybe some of you yelpers always find from my reviews....would I come back here again?  Yes, most definitely.

My overall grade?  A+"}
{"text":"This was on my Burger Bucket List. Read the hype on this place and finally got a chance to check it out. 
When I got there, I looked at the menu but didn't really care since I always order the same thing, Bacon Cheeseburger with everything plus grilled onions and avocado. 

I ordered a bacon cheeseburger please with everything add grilled onions... \"We don't do grilled onions\". Ok, well, add avocado, \"We don't have avocados\". Man, fine then with fries and a small drink.

They gave me a cool small buzzer that said Oh Snap! Buzzed and got my tray.

It looked really small and thought I had ordered a kid's meal but nope that was it. The burger was the size of a glazed donut from Food City. There was a small 1 inch piece of Romaine Lettuce. I looked across the Shake Shack and saw Thirsty Lion. I bet they would have a more spectacular burger than this.

Burger bun - soft
Burger patty - medium with a little raw, I should have mentioned to have it well done.
Lettuce - it was a joke
Pickles and onions - meh
Fries - crinkle fries and I really don't care for these but it was the best food at Shake Shack
Drink - Coke, meh

This really bummed me out for the rest of the day, like I was cheated, dupped or suckered in. I am glad I went there and tried it out knowing that I will never ever go there again. 

Scratch this off my Burger Bucket List."}
{"text":"Shake is not the best shake out there you can easily get a better quality shake and a bigger size the burger is pretty regular taste but kinda on a welldone side the chicken sandwich let me put it this way mc donald spicy chicken taste a lot better sorry I will try again next time. 10 thumbs down for  food quality taste and price"}
{"text":"One of my favorite burgers and surprisingly chicken sandwiches too. Put it this way; this is the only place my daughter will finish the entire burger. Now that's saying something. 

Looks like a burger you would make in your own kitchen but maybe that's what makes them so good. It's comfort food that reminds you of home. And home is where the food is lol. 

The shroom burger is pretty good too but I prefer the regular shack burger and the crispy crinkle fries. The concretes are worth a try too, hope you saved room for dessert. 

My only gripe is the service; I always feel rushed with the cashiers. They definitely aren't as friendly as CFA and not as affordable either. Pricey for the size of burger you get so I don't come as often as I'd like to. Other than that, no complaints. Restaurant is always clean and plenty of tables and outdoor seating available. Great location too."}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of my coworker and she did not disappoint! Burger was good, Crinkle cut fries were nicely salted and crisp, and the chocolate malt shake was so good! Will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas..."}
{"text":"My daughter had been waiting for this place to open for a long time, and while some of us liked the burgers well enough (as in, average), I had the chicken and...meh. The fries and the chicken had this strange similar flavor...probably both fried in the same oil which was sort of pungent in a weird way. Not bad, exactly, but not good either. You may like it, but I'd pass. The ice cream is another story. I really liked that, and especially the 'Dust Devil' sundae, so I might go back for ice cream only, but since we had to drive about 1/2 hour to Scottsdale, I think I'd much rather go to the Sugar Bowl. Overall, meh."}
{"text":"I went here when I was in New York and continuously had withdrawals until I went this past week. I got the Chick'n Shack with fries and it was everything I had hoped and wished it to be: amaze. The only reason that I am giving it four stars has nothing to do with the food. It was because 1.) my drink had a single cube of ice in it and there was no open soda fountain to fill it to the top with ice and 2.) my friend and I sat outside and the sun was glaring into my eyes and there was no way for me to shelter myself. Aside from those two minor inconveniences, everything was great!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the burgers here. It was crowded as usual but the queue moved pretty fast so it was good. I ordered the vegetarian burger. The fried shrooms and the bread were my favorite. Also ordered the black and white milk shake. But the shake was a little too thick for my liking. Overall I will give 5 stars for a fast food chain. But it was a little too pricey so I think it deserves 4 stars for that price."}
{"text":"Their burgers were sub-par. I was expecting In-N-Out burger on steroids but was disappointed. The burgers were not as flavorful as I thought. The Shack Burger was doused in Shack sauce but I could barely taste the sauce and the burger patty. The patty was tender and juicy but half way through my meal the burger had fallen apart and I ended up eating the rest with a fork. I can say I've tried Shake Shack but I will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ever since I had Shake Shack at Madison Square Park I've been jonesin hard core for the Shake Stack burger. While I'm a hardcore, SoCal In-N-Out aficionado, I also appreciate the unique flavors & textures of the Shroom Burger (breaded and deep-fried cheese-stuffed portobello goodness!). 

Came into Vegas to fulfill my 33rd Shake Shack birthday wish and Team Member Diane graciously provided us with a Birthday custard (with sprinkles!) and was serenaded by the surrounding tables. Diane also gave us some great insight about the new Woof Menu for our four legged furry friends.

THANK you Shake Shack for bringing it out West (was so excited when I saw announcements and photos via your Instagram and the grand opening at the New York New York Hotel!). Can't wait until you open in Santa Monica!!"}
{"text":"I thought it was okay. I got the shake shack burger and it was good but not like WOAH good. Maybe my friends hyped it up too much for me, but I wouldn't mind trying it again!"}
{"text":"Is this a burger or a slider?!?! The quality is good, the portions are small and the prices are high! I feel to for a man to really get full going here plan on spending over $20.00 on your self! Service was good for a walk up counter"}
{"text":"This place is Amazing Place Guillermo the Host was pleasant but the kicker was the Manager DAVID. I was asking about whether their was an app for a free Shake he shook his head NO! I asked the app said download the app and get a free shake? Manager still said NO? Then he said okay!!!! Love the act of kindness Vegas has when your putting it out their. Food Spectacular,
I recommend the Premium Outlets, they close at 10:00, but I was lucky David was their. Lol"}
{"text":"First, let me say that the food here is really good. The burgers are fresh and delicious and their fries are crinkled. There is nothing better in the whole world than crinkle fries! The house made lemonade is the perfect combo of tart and sweet. My 2 star review is because the Shake Shack app leaves MUCH to be desired. If you're not a fan of waiting in ridiculously long lines the app is a must. However, out of the 4 times I've tried to use it I've only successfully been able to order once. Every other time, after I've done all the steps of choosing a pickup time, choosing my items, and putting in my credit card info it errors out right at the end when I hit the submit order button. An error message pops up that says \"Ruh Roh! There was a problem processing your order. Please try again later!\" The Scooby Doo expression is super irritating after you've \"tried again later\" several times. Like I said I was only successful ordering ONCE out of 4 separate attempts on different days. That's a piss poor ratio."}
{"text":"Forgot how expensive this place is. Good burgers, but not worth $35 bucks for 2 people to chow down on burgers and fries. Guess I'm spoiled with In-N-Out here in California.

Definitely check them out when you're in Vegas if you don't have one in your hometown area, but there's usually a line and it's not \"cheap\" for \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken sandwich and it was the bomb dot com. Also I never eat burgers in general, I am a human rice cake and love noodles too. If i had to eat American food I would pick Shake Shack"}
{"text":"I hate giving any business less than 5 stars. In most cases it effects the employees and management. However, I'm subtracting a star because of Company Practices. I will also include pictures. 
Stopped in for lunch yesterday. I had heard a lot of positive feedback about Shake Shack. I have been eagerly waiting to try them out. 
The restaurant is very busy, for a great reason. The vibe is very cool, and they're great for large groups. I had the Smoke Stack (Bacon Cheeseburger), fries and a small drink. My wife had the Mushroom burger, fries, and a small drink. It cost us nearly $30.00 for lunch, which I felt was a bit high for a Fast Food experience. 
My burger was fantastic! The quality of the ingredients was top notch! Perfectly cooked burger and bacon. The mushroom on my wife's burger was a breaded, filled with cheese, rolled in breadcrumbs, and fried, portobello mushroom. Perfection! The French fries were perfectly cooked, golden and crunchy exterior, soft interior. Fries portion is very big. The small soft drink is smaller than any other place I've ever been to. This is fine, because they offer free refills. The problem with the refill, is every time you want one, an attendant has to get it for you. I had to get 5 refills. Each time, they give you a new cup. They fill that tiny cup with so much ice, you get maybe 5 to 8 sips. Just with me, six cups were used. I complained, thinking it's a total waste, and very unfriendly for the Environment. I was told it's Company policy. 
Every employee I encountered had great Customer Service Skills, fast, efficient and very friendly. 
Had it not been for the soda situation, and price. They would have definitely gotten 5 stars out of me. I might go back, if they ever change either cup sizes, or the waste of paper products. I would definitely recommend going there, at least once. It's on my top 10 best burgers, I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Although Shake Shack is breaking ground in West Hollywood in 2016, I will probably never make it out there since I loathe Hollywood traffic.  Thank goodness there is a Vegas location!

Shackburger:  Tasty!  Loved the simple burger with lettuce, tomato, and shacksauce.

Smokeshack:  Didn't like this so much, it was with bacon, and it was just ok.  Preferred the regular shackburger.

Root beer float:  Can't go wrong with that.

Fries:  I happened to love the fries.  It was fried perfectly, seasoned well, and the cheese sauce was right up my alley.  Never met French fries I didn't like.

Verdict of In-n-Out vs Shake Shack:  Count me in as In-n-Out loyalist.  In-n-Out is fresher, tastier, and cheaper, too.  I like the fries at Shake Shack better, and I like that they sell alchohol here.  I fully enjoyed Shake Shack, so I'm sure I'll be back at this location next time I'm in Vegas.  Glad I finally got to try this place out!"}
{"text":"Best place to go when you are starving, drunk and still want good food. The food was absolutely amazing and the wait was not long. 10 out of 10 recommend."}
{"text":"Oh shake shack oh shake shack! Where have you been all my life?..

I've been wanting to try this place out for the longest time but I hadn't gotten the chance too. Saturday was the day and oh boy was I happy. 

I ordered a shake stack burger with mushroom, one small vanilla shake, and one order of regular fries for about a $20 total. 
 
My sister had a bacon burger with their special sauce and an order of bacon and cheese fries for a total of about $14.

Prices are a bit high but the food was delicious. Both our burgers were very juicy and the meat was very well seasoned. The vanilla shake was very creamy and the ice cream tasted sooooo good. It was that good good vanilla.

My mushroom burger was so tasty! Oh but do beware that the mushroom and cheese are piping hot when it's given to you. They do put a sticker on the outside of the burger warning you that it is going to be HOT. 

The employees were friendly and there are a ton of tables to eat at. They even have an outside patio. 

I will he back again for more!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, but the lunch line at 11:30 stretched halfway around the building. Had the single burger and fries.  Lemonade was good too."}
{"text":"This place is busy, but the line moves pretty fast and there is lots of seating. The burger was a tad over cooked for medium, but still enjoyable."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place!!!!!!! Sorry In-N-Out....there's someone else.

This is the best chain burger I've ever had! They use fresh, quality ingredients which is a lot better than what you'll get at fast food burger joints. And they also serve alcohol! And shakes. Their fries are crunchy and not too salty which I thought was perfect. Their burger buns are fluffy. The portion sizes were very great. And the toppings you can put on the burgers were very tasty. The space at the Vegas location is very big, modern, and clean. The service was friendly and your food came out fast. I can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"Hamburgers are one of the best. They are really the best I've tried for a long time. The best taste and ingredients. I love this place for a snack."}
{"text":"Came here two nights in a row because this place is absolutely delicious!!! Although it is a little pricey everything is made nice and fresh with high quality ingredients. I ordered my food, found a seat, and my food was ready about 7 minutes later. The staff here is sooooo nice and polite and really make sure that you have everything you need. The place was very clean as well.. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Mmmmm just like NYC! I was so excited when I heard they opened Shake Shack Only 300 miles away from me in LA :). Yes, I am a native to In N Out and yes they are great but shake shack is just as good, if not better(don't tell my LA peeps) 



The lines went quick and the burgers tasted great.
Definitely order the cheese fries! So delicious! Especially after a night of drinking. :)"}
{"text":"My colleague and I were in town for business and both families suggested that we get a shake if we were in the area.  We decided to grab some lunch there.  We opted out on a burger, but no fries in that their prices seemed hi. The burger was good, but the chocolate shake was worth the visit. The staff was very friendly.  Glad we visited."}
{"text":"Shake shack, looks like your typical burger place but it has a strong feel, taste (kinda like in n out).
We stayed at the hotel that hosted this & we caught this meal before the game.
It was busy but also very quick to get attended.
These burgers were deliciously made. They help together each topping very wellZ
The bread was soft and seemed like it was just made. The sauce wasn't too overwhelming it was a mayo/thousand island like feel/taste.
The fries were the best, crinkled, well done with a crunch on the outside & soft mashed potatoes on the inside.
They complimented the burgers well.
Their prices are super good for what it is as well which made my wallet super happy.
The overall feel is like Unami, casual but sleek.
They had tvs all around to catch current games.
It was clean and facilitated well. I enticed my meal here & can't wait to eat again.'l
They also have inside & outside seating, even a dog menu! Must try!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hub up is all about. Had better burgers at five guys and in n out. Fries kinda bland. Would do 2.5 stars if I could"}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack! Always good anytime everytime. I once stood in line for 2 hours in NYC for Shake Shack burger. Thanks for opening in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ok, I get it, but I really dont. This is just an overhyped burger place. For the prices? nah I'd rather go to in n out man. Me and my boyfriend had ordered a burger each, two fries, and a drink, and it came out more than 20$ lol I couldn't believe the shroom burger or whatever is $10? like what do they put in it, unicorn blood? lol but seriously, Ive only eaten here a couple of times, because I was shopping in DT summerlin and just wanted to eat something real quick. One annoying to me was people who were saving tables when they hadnt even ordered yet....I feel like if youve ordered, THEN you get to sit down and eat. By the time, youre done ordering, more tables will free up. On the plus side tho - I do like how the people working there walk around to see if you need anything or a refill on your drink - gives it a restaurant feel."}
{"text":"This place was just okay for me. It was nothing spectacular and there weren't fireworks on my tongue haha I have gone to the one in central park in new york and I remember that one being real good. So, I was very excited when I heard one had opened here! 

When I looked at the menu, it was similar to that of new york. The average price of a burger is 6-10$. The shakes are around 5$. When I had arrived, I was expecting some what of a line but I seriously just walked right on up to the register and ordered our burgers. Some of the burgers have a shack sauce that reminded me of in n out, but this sauce is much saltier than I remember. Nothing beats the in n out secret sauce  

Overall, the burgers we got basically tasted like something  that I could have concocted at home. Just cook some meat, fry some bacon, melt some cheese and voila! You have a shake shack burger. The sauce was salty and I felt it had overpowered the taste of my burger. I had to drink two cups of Dr pepper to help with it. The krinkle fries were good tho! You can't mess up potatoes! Oh, my friend got a strawberry milkshake that was OK too. 

I wasn't too impressed so I may only return to see if my first experience was just bad or if a friend forces me."}
{"text":"I received a coupon last month for a free shack burger so I figured I'd try them out since my friend told me their burgers were good. Unfortunately  I wasn't impressed. The burgers seem to be cooked in the same way smashburger does theirs but my burger was overcooked and on the small side. It wasn't very satisfying.

There is no self serve fountain for drinks so you have to request one at the counter. Although I brought my cup for a refill, I was given a new cup. IMO that's wasteful.

Despite that, service was fast and friendly but I doubt I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Shake Shack!! 

What can I say? It is my happy place. My boyfriend and I make it a point to go here at least twice whenever we go to Vegas. I always get the Shack Stack with crispy shallots! It's good with added bacon too! The fries are always delicious. I usually get the black and white shake and my boyfriend usually gets strawberry. Both are delicious too! 

One of the things I have to applaud them for is their service. The workers are really nice and they don't hesitate to correct any errors, even though it's rare. There are workers going around checking on seated tables, which is great for a fast food place. And the wait for food has never been ridiculously long.

The only thing I don't like is how they give you a brand new cup when you get a refill. It's great for me and probably done for sanitary purposes, but it is wasteful. (Hence one less star)"}
{"text":"I came from California and had to know if shake shack could give in n out a run for their money.  This place was surprisingly better than I thought. I thought in n out was going to win easily. The burger was pretty good. I'd say it's at the same level of in n out, but the fries. The fries of in n out are far more superior than shake shacks. Shake shacks fries were doughy in the middle. You get that potatoey feeling and suddenly made the meal a lot heavier. In n out fries are always seasoned and cooked to perfection. Now it's time for you all to make your own decisions on who takes the crown for the best fast food burger joint."}
{"text":"So excited to have a Shake Shack location on this side of town. The district needed something like this and FINALLY we have it. Dog friendly patio and snacks, open late (even on weeknights) and fantastic, consistent food; now less than a quick drive away!

This is, by far, my favorite Shake Shack location. Aesthetically they are all similar, but the layout of this one is awesome. They have big windows and garage doors that roll up to combine the patio with the interior (obviously not during the summer, but in fall it going to be bomb). 

Obviously this location is new, so employees are learning the registers and things are a little bit slower, but that comes with the territory. So far, every night I've been in this place is PACKED. But people are excited about the quality sandwiches, burgers and DELICIOUS shakes. You can get your burgers or chicken shacks on lettuce, which is an awesome option for those who are gluten free or people who want to watch their carbs. The fries are crinkle cut, which is a super important quality, in my opinion. Pretty much everything I've tried from Shake Shack I have loved. It's a little pricier then some of their competition, but the quality and taste is well worth the extra few bucks. 

Can't wait for the good weather and the patio hangs at this place. It's gonna be gooooood."}
{"text":"When I first heard of this place I had to check it out. Labeled as the east coast version of In-n-out. The place does not disappoint. They always have seasonal fro custard. I am always down to trying it. 

::Customer Service/ Location::
There is always a long line but they line moves pretty fast. They also have outdoor ordering on warm days. The staff is always friendly and helpful. 
The location is smaller considering its on the vegas strip - bathroom was clean

::Food::
Shake Burger - signature burger - Juicy, flavorful and tastes great
Chick'n Shake - Fried chicken on the perfect bun
Fries with cheese - melted cheese on perfect cut fries.
Frozen custard - yellow sponge cake - seasonal flavor
Cold brew coffee. - Cold brew coffee - yummy

:Overall:
I love this place and I can't wait when they open their first west coast location at WEST HOLLYWOOD, CA
They have beef, chicken and veggie options. I had their veggie mushroom as part of their cheeseburger with the mushroom it in. It was so so good.
Frozen custard so good

Lets not forget their fries - i would get them with the cheese. and stick a fork in it


I tell all my friends about it and definitely plan to come back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I got the BBQ Cheddar & Bacon burger and it was delicious! I added lettuce and onion to my order and was surprised to find that I got charged extra for it. I also wanted the crinkle cut fries and again was surprised that they didn't have a meal but sold everything separately. I got a strawberry milk shake which was definitely delicious. All in all, my meal was really good, and the meat was very tender and juicy! The only thing that I would complain about is the pricing. It is a little bit on the pricier side for burgers and fries. I ended up spending about $20 on my meal. But overall I was satisfied!"}
{"text":"Some days you just need a burger and fries.  Or in my case a mushroom burger and fries with cheese sauce.  We were trying to make a decision between In-N-Out and the Shake Shack. After reading their websites we chose the Shack because of their choice of food they served. No antibiotics in the meat and so on. 

I have been waiting to try a Shake Shack and the opportunity finally arose. This is in downtown Summerlin. Meaning a nice little city center that has many options for shopping and food. 

Our gps did not take us exactly to SS, so we parked the car and walked around window shopping and enjoying the beautiful sunny day. 

We turned a corner and found the Shack. It was a busy place but we got our food quickly. My friend ordered a
Cheeseburger and said it was awesome. I got the mushroom burger. The cheeseburger was not greasy and tasted like it was grilled. She says the Shack sauce was good. We shared a cheese fries. I had a lemonade that tasted not homemade on site. We were happy with our meals. It was a great fast food snack. 

Sit outside if you get the chance. The location is shaded and clean. 

Recommend everyone go to the Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Great food but, exceptional customer service. Our pager didn't go off and staff located outside.  Not only did they comp our lunch for the long wait, they gave us chocolate milkshakes.  Thank you Edgar!!!  You deserve a raise and promotion. I highly recommend the Shake Shake!"}
{"text":"With all the hype surrounding this place, I was prepared to be disappointed; it turned out to be quite tasty. We had a shackburger and a shackstack, fries and vanilla concrete- all delicious. The lines at 330pm were minimal but I am sure they'll be worse again by 5pm. They run a very efficient operation, thankfully!"}
{"text":"I tried their chicken sandwich, cheeseburger, and hot dog with fries on the side. I'm not sure what else I was supposed to try here that I haven't already. Nothing saved the day... I'll take In-N-Out or Habit Burger over this joint any day."}
{"text":"Just OK for me. Burger was not flavorful. Fries tasted like old oil. And bathroom smell was horrible.  Nice patio and desserts."}
{"text":"Was invited to Grand Opening. Great location. Beautiful Arizona mountain decor. Easy to read menu. Recycled tables from bowling alleys in New York. Wood and steel is recycled too. Furry children are welcome. Even have treats for them. 
Just fyi, this IS NOT a fast food restaurant. Good food isnt put in a holding bin for who knows how long and pulled out when time to make a burger. The beef here is Angus beef. No antibiotics and No GMO's (Genitically Made Organisms).  When the burger comes out, it is presented with a smile. Fresh, fresh, fresh Lettuce and tomato all organized for great eye appeal. Bun is awesome. All burgers are prepared to a cooking temperature of \"Medium\". Like that. No more hockey pucks here. The SmokeShack is fantastic. Love the chopped cherry peppers and bacon. Chicken sandwich made with buttermilk looks delicious and is 100 times better than Chick Fil-A from what ive heard. And I like their chicken. I heard the chicken has a special cooking process that most European and very High-end restaurants use. Sous vide, its a vaccum sealed method of cooking to keep juices in,  please look up. Im running out of space here. 
Great beers, Froggleap wines, Root beer from the south and custard in cones or Handspun Concretes for dessert. The CamelShack is my favorite.
Management great, employees happy equal happy customers. Place is very clean considering the non stop flow of people. Order your food and drinks, get a table, play some foosball and kick back and relax until you get buzzed for your food.
Enjoy, I did. 
They also donate 5% from the sales of the CamelShack Boston Creme Pie Custard Concrete to the Childrens Hospital."}
{"text":"Monday afternoon after a morning at Quail Hollow CC & the PGA Wells Fargo.

Believe it or not, no outside line, but crowded inside.

Great crinkle cut fries, good, not extra special burger.

Give me a Zack's Special anyday, taste better, costs less, and smaller lines."}
{"text":"Sorry guys.  Not my favorite.  I don't understand why all the hype is about.  Definitely had better burgers and not woeth that long wait 

In all fairness,  I didn't try the shakes which I do hear are amazing,  but that's also what people have been saying about the burgers... 

The burger was small with a thin beat patty.  The flavors were good but it wasn't anything mouth watering.  I wasn't impressed"}
{"text":"Friendly staff but order took quite a while.  I went right there to pick up and the food was already cold. Burgers were boring, toppings were tasteless and meat had pink spots in center. Fries were not hot either. After such a bland unfinished  meal- I still got really bad heartburn.  Shake was melty."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is fun and always pretty busy. Totally delish choc milkshakes and burgers. Fun enviroment. Can get one or 2 beers. Pretty family oriented which is good. The District is very nice to grab a bite, walk, shop, talk and visit."}
{"text":"Shake Shack very overpriced for below average food. The whole restaurant smelled like forking fish... And they don't even sell fish! Don't go unless you spend 20 dollars on a burger you can get a Wendy's!"}
{"text":"It's difficult to gauge a burger place on the west coast of the USA once you've had competitor burgers like In N Out or Gordon Ramsay \"Burgr\". Shake Shack's origins are in New York City, but its principles have carried over dutifully to the west coast, and through those principles, the food really shines on its own.

I came here a few days ago to pick up a to-go order, consisting of:
Shroom Burger
SmokeShack
Shack-Cago Dog
Fries

While there, I noticed they had beers on tap and dog treats. Since I don't have a dog and I was driving, I can't comment on either, but I will say that I saw other customers with dogs eating dog treats and other customers drinking the good stuff!

Anyway, when I got home, the food was still hot (I have one of those hot / cold bags that you see food delivery drivers often use). I dug in, and here were the results:

- Fries are crispy on the outside, soft in the middle. Similar to ordering fries \"well done\" from In N Out.
- Shack-Cago Dog is really unique, it's got a clusterfuck of vegetables including peppers and cucumber and tomato to pair with the hotdog itself.
- The SmokeShack is a unique pairing of chopped up spicy peppers and bacon. Quite a flavorful punch!
- The Shroom Burger is vegetarian, and the \"burger patty\" is packed full of flavor. What I liked about this in particular is that it doesn't try to pretend it's a meat patty, it really just tastes like a damn good garden burger! Props to Shake Shack for authenticity points!

Here's where things get a little interesting, I looked at my bill and saw it was $23+. I didn't even order any drinks. So I can understand how other Yelpers have pointed out how the prices here seem a bit steep for burgers, especially considering the burgers themselves are about the same size as an In N Out burger, but stylistically carries themes from SmashBurger in terms of flavor and food presentation.

I could sort of see this from a different POV: Maybe you're paying for the experience? The customer goes to the counter to order their food. The kitchen behind the counter is open face, small, and is on a roll with production non-stop during the busiest of hours (when is Shake Shack not busy?) There's booze and ice cream on tap, and treats for the dogs. The ambiance is modern with dim lighting and trendy background music.

Does this really justify the high price point that other Yelpers are pointing out?

What ultimately saves this place in my opinion is the uniqueness of said experience. I don't know too many burger places out there that are this \"fast-casual\" AND serve alcohol. You might be able to name a few, but not on the national brand that Shake Shack is quickly becoming.

And to think that once upon a time, Shake Shack was just a shack that sold burgers.

So, I'm left to give you this takeaway, readers: Shake Shack is certainly a unique experience, it's fun, the burgers are good albeit pricey, so I give them four stars there alone, not to mention the options for dogs allowing man's best friend to feel included in your dining experience. There's booze and ice cream available on tap. You should still go to at least say you've been to a Shake Shack, and you can make your own takeaway judgment, but for me, Shake Shack is a seldom experience, not a frequent habit (I've been three times in a year if that gives you a point of reference). But to say \"I'm just going to In N Out\" would be equally unfair, since neither joint is trying to be like another."}
{"text":"I finally got to taste what the hype is all about. I thought the burgers were tasty. We got the shake burger and mushroom patty burger. Like the other yelpers said, the burgers are on the small side and penny pinch. Prices on the strip are always high. I love French fries especially crinkles cut ones. The fries were pretty good and crispy not soggy. We did not get the cheese ones  b/c the burgers already have cheese and it will be way too much and heavy. Yeah the line was long but it does move fast. Better find a spot inside  b/c outside is just too hot in the summer. Everything tasted fine but it's not like I'll be running back for more. I still prefer     IN and OUT. I guess it's my California roots lol. I'll try their shakes next time."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time to see what is the buzz all about. 

As the first timers, my expectations were bit high. I was expecting better service in a sense to where they would explain to us how it works or if they had any recommendations. It was a complete opposite. 

The girl that was helping us could care less about any questions we were asking, she was really unfriendly and just wanted to take our order and get to the next person. Did I mention, the place was not even that busy. 

We seat outside and food arrived. Totally average burgers. In my personal opinion they are super average for the price. The buns are nothing special....I was not impressed at all. 

Little over $30 later, bad service, and average food I did not leave this joint with the mindset of wanting to come back ASAP."}
{"text":"First time here! Very clean snd nice inside. The food was good. I liked that the fries weren't greasy. I got the chicken club and was happy with my choice."}
{"text":"So the first time I tried Shake Shack was in New York, and it was delicious when I went there. Having been born and raised in California, I was extremely skeptical about Shake Shack because people kept comparing it to In N Out. I'm not completely opposed to Shake Shack but I definitely prefer In N Out for its quality of food and lower cost. 

I have to say that Shake Shack has some perks, especially with its large variety of burgers and shakes. The location in Vegas is good and I'll definitely go again if I'm in town and want something quick to eat. The major downside to Shake Shack is how pricey each item is. To me, everything was slightly smaller portioned and greasier than the same item from In N Out. For example, I ordered a cheeseburger and shake and my total came out to be about $15. Whereas, I could've ordered the same thing plus fries at In N Out for about $7. ?"}
{"text":"I thought it was cool that they specifically put Shake Shack by New York, New York.

It is a generic burger. The hype is a little over-rated. Workers seemed to be miserable to be there and there were some mistakes with the order. The cashier put our buzzer number in wrong so we waited forever. There was a crowd so we tried to be patient. Finally when we went to go inquire, we learned our food had been sitting at the kiosk for who knows how long because both receipts (with our name on it) read \"1\" and our buzzer was \"71\". This combined with the error in our error (again, our receipts matched so we know we took the right food) was a little frustrating.

The fries are notable and wonderful, that was the highlight of the meal.

 Ultimately, In-n-out has a better price point, a better taste, and would be my first choice of the two."}
{"text":"Det finns många hamburgerrestauranger i USA, men väldigt få som levererar högkvalité kött och rimliga priser med oerhörd god smak. Som tur är, är Shake Shack en av de bästa på just detta.

Shake Shack levererar kött som är fritt från allt skräp som kan finnas i köttet i USA och tillsammans med fräscha restauranger och gudomliga goda milkshakes, speciellt vanilj eller jordnötssmör. 

Är du hungrig och ute efter god, relativt hälsosam snabbtmat och för ett billigt pris, så kan du sluta att leta. Shake Shack finns till undsättning."}
{"text":"The TL;DR version: tasty, overpriced food that's not worth the hype.

I came here with my sister when there was just a couple people in line. We had planned on sharing the fries, mushroom burger and a shake, but seeing how small the burger was, we each got our own. The fries didn't seem particularly appealing so we skipped them.

The mushroom burger was like a fun grilled cheese sandwich. The cheese oozed out with the first bite. It was good, but it needed more to it. For $7 and its reputation, I expected a little more \"wow.\" We also got a chocolate malt that was very average. Not bad but not exciting."}
{"text":"Everyone was talking about this new place so my family and I decided to try it out last Monday on a Memorial Day. I was warned that the wait would be long so I prepared for that. I was happily surprised that we did not have to wait in a long line but our order did take longer to make than the competitors. The atmosphere is clean, open, modern and there is plenty of outdoor seating available. The burgers were good (noticeably salty) but ordinary. The fries were crinkled fries which I like, but again they were also ordinary. I thought for sure the pazzaz would be found in the shakes, but again they were ordinary. So for $60 for a family of four, I didn't feel the need to come back, but I did enjoy trying something new. I liked the presentation of the burgers in a throw back paper around the burger, as well as the cute bag they put the food in. But overall the food itself was ordinary."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place ever since it came to town a few months ago. Everyone raves about Shake Shack, particularly my East Coast buds, and being an In n' Out advocate, I was eager to see what the all hubbub was about. I wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be. 

I tried a peanut butter chocolate milkshake (DUH. SHAKE shack), fries, and their special burger Roadside Shack burger. I absolutely adored the shake. You can tell its a legit real ice cream, real peanut butter shake. I was majorly impressed. The fries were crispy and crinkle cut so naturally I loved them. However the actual burger was a huge disappointment. It was overly salty and the caramelized onions were composed of salty goo and a few diced onions. However, when my mouth adjusted to the aggressive amount of salt, I did get to taste the cheddar cheese and it was so good. Very natural, sharp cheddar. 

I will definitely go back and try a different burger. Maybe this special won't last long. But be warned, the Roadside Shack is a dud. 

The place does have wonderful ambience and its for sure a chill place to sit down and grab a bite on the strip. Doesn't feel like a fast food joint at all."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of Shake Shack! With the incredible food scene in LV, I question why I always want to go there and the answer is the shroom burger, fries and purple cow float. I swear I'm not 10 years old . But seriously, I've never had a better burger! Consistently crispy with the perfect ratio of cheese stuffed into the portobello. Fries are great, piping hot with the perfect amount of salt and I hate salt so I would know. Their self serving condiment area is wonderful so no one can judge the amount of mayo I take. The purple cow float is great, I've been there with several different people and it's not something everyone seems to love, but I really do. 

Opportunities for improvement are the water dispenser at the condiment bar. The water is always lukewarm, which is annoying when you're there in the spring/summer/fall. The bathroom could use more tidying up. It's a small space so filth anywhere doesn't do it any justice. It's always littered with paper towels. 

Random FYI - I'm from Chicago where I have a Shake Shack only 20 minutes (out of my way) away but for some reason I never make it out. There's something about the one of the strip that makes me crave it through my entire trip every time I come to Vegas. Hey I'm saving money at least!"}
{"text":"I'm a hardcore In-n-Out fan so I had to see what the hype was about Shake Shack. 

It's located at New York New York facing Las Vegas Blvd. You cross the Brooklyn Bridge to get to it. It's a nice spot. Has indoor and outdoor seating.

I tried the Shake Shack burger and cheese fries. The cheese is your typical nacho cheese, good but the fries are good alone as well. The burger was a good size. Not too overwhelming and messy. I'd say it's a close second in my book to In-n-Out. I would definitely eat there again next visit."}
{"text":"Looked at allllll (most) of the pics on Yelp and I knew I had to come here!!!!

We wandered here at 10am on Sunday (yes I wanted a heart attack for breakfast)... we killed 45mins exploring mgm and nyny... anxiously awaiting the 11am opening!!

When we returned ppl started piling up, waiting to come in... the nice staff opened up the doors for us at 10:55.

We didn't have a wait to order - staff was super friendly.

We ordered: 2 shake stacks, 2 fries, 2 crispy chicken sandwiches, jackpot concrete 

That shake stack (deep fried portobello shroom stuffed with cheese atop a fresh burger with cheese) = I NEED THIS...

Wasn't impressed (I've had my fill of burgers on this trip and I was hoping to add this to my list of things I'd be craving)... kinda made me feel a bit sick (way too much cheese - and I freakin love cheese).

Concrete... Again wasn't blown away

Crispy Chicken with extra buttermilk herb mayo... HANDS DOWN BEST CHICKEN SANDWICH... Perfectly crisp, all white breast, fresh pickles and lettuce... and that mayo - delish!!!!!!!!

Id come back just for the chicken!! :)"}
{"text":"As a individual trying to be a health freak, when i see no antibiotics, natural ingredients etc, it catches my attention and to try this place. Glad i did. The burgers are delicious! 

I got the 'shroom burger (vegetarian), which is a portobello mushroom with muenster cheese, lightly battered and fried. Surprisingly it wasn't too greasy or filling. It was perfect with their signature sauce.

Hubby got the double cheeseburger which to me the meat taste like in n out but with a different kick and flavor in their signature sauce. I think they mixed a bit of horseradish and vinegar in it for that kick which was delicious! Compared to In n out though, they give you more meat which is thicker but then again its much costly. 

Hubby prefers In n out while its hard to compare in my opinion as they both have their own flavors. Both are great!

I also got the cheese fries which they use the nacho cheese sauce which I love. Well im the worse person to ask in regards to the cheese because I just love cheese in general. No one calls me the dairy queen for nothing, you know. So if you don't like nacho cheese, get it plain.

Tried the shake as that's what everyone pretty much come here for but i have to say i wasn't a fan of it. Very filling and too sweet for my pallet. Level of sweetness is a bit sweeter than a coca cola on comparison and density is literally like a semi melted ice cream. Very thick/creamy. So if you like your shake very sweet and dense, you will like it. We got the black & white and the vanilla. Their most popular is black&white and PB.

Overall, great place, not too greasy for a burger joint. A bit too costly though for amount you get. So have to (minus 1-star)."}
{"text":"Curiosity killed the cat and we checked out  the hype. While our Smoke Stack (patty, bacon, cheese, peppers and Shake Sauce) and Shroom Burger (Portobello mushroom as patty) were tasty, it was  pricey. The Shroom Burger costs more than the SmokeShack,  at $6.89 before taxes. Have a sweet tooth, so we had shakes and concretes too, which were again pricey for the size. Would we go again? YES. Would be foolish to wait in line for hours? NO.  Will try the app and compare the wait times-saw lots of patrons in and out pretty quickly who had taken advantage of that option."}
{"text":"Finally made it to the Shake Shack that's taking over the country.  The enthusiastic employees at the front counter were competing to take our order first.  Order at the counter and you get an electronic buzzer to lwet you know your order is ready for pick up.  Burgers and fries were really good.  The frozen custard really is custard, not just some soft serve stuff. 

Manageable crowd at lunch.  Recommend Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Love shake shack, fresh burgers, excellent fries and very clean establishment. Much better than Inn n out."}
{"text":"I was expecting the New York in n out, instead I get what appears to be a slightly worse version of five guys. The lack of sauce and simplicity of the burger means that the burden is placed almost entirely on the ingredients and quality of the grilling, and the meat just end up being not as juicy as something five guys or super duper burger. This was still better than your average burger like jack in the box, but doesn't break into the upper echelons of fast food burgers."}
{"text":"Tastes like the shake shack restaurants in NYC!  I'm glad that they have one here in Vegas.

I had a burger, fries and shake.  All were excellent.  I think the fries are a little too typical and don't stand out enough but crinkle cut fries are good."}
{"text":"I've been to Shake Shack twice since my previous review.  Since then, my experience has been excellent. Burgers were amazing, shakes delicious, fries on point.  

I felt a little disgusted with myself for how much I ate.  

Thanks Shake Shack...I think."}
{"text":"How appropriate that NYNY has a shake shack inside it. This is the best fast food burger in the city and I'm so happy it is available in Vegas as well.  All their burgers are made with organic beef so you pay more but it comes out in the flavor. Looking forward to my stop in when I'm in Vegas in two weeks..."}
{"text":"This place is quite expensive for a burger joint. The taste of the cheese on the fries was less than desirable. Just get plain fries and save the money. The burgers are great. If you are one that likes to know what place it compares to most, I would say the patties are like the ones at culvers and are kinda crispy.

I got a mint chocolate shake flavor of the week. For $5.59 it was pretty small and did not taste that good. Earlier in the week I had a mint oreo shake from qt and it was way better for $1.99. 

All in all, its sad to say this place is a little over hyped for the price and quality of food. Two people with one shared shake cost $24.79. Get two drinks and you are over $30 for fast food.

The inside of the restaurant kinda had a funky smell too. I will stick to culvers, five guys, portillos, chick fil a, and in n out for my fave joints."}
{"text":"Im not one to write bad reviews and id love to give this place more stars for the service i receiveat night but this dat shift crew is ridiculous. I've been here more then a handful of times. I not only eat here but i pick food up for postmates and today the service was a complete 180. The cashier I delt with was completely rude. No smile no hi how are you no nothing. She acted like taking my order was a burden to her. Then to top it off the lady that handed me the food was the exact same way. I love coming here but man did this bring an eye opener to me. Never will I ever come to this place in the day time. I like coming here at night with the night crew that actually treat you with respect and it doesnt seem so depressed or seem like the customers are a burden. The people that work at night are more welcoming and happier.."}
{"text":"Definitely the spot for delicious wings! Very clean and a friendly environment! Prices are reasonable!! You must try this place !!"}
{"text":"In my mind, as I was walking towards the strip, I was thinking how cool would it be if they brought a Shake Shack to New York New York Casino and just as I glanced over across the street I see in big letters SHAKE SHACK. SHAKE SHACK!? I was so excited. I might have scared my friends. 

For now I have to give Shake Shack a 4 star. 

I really have to try a burger with a double patty. 

I had the Shake Stack for my first time, which is their cheeseburger with their stuffed mushroom. I do have to say that shake shack incorporates a mushroom in a burger better than anywhere else I've tried. Sauteed mushrooms don't compare to a fried stuffed Portobello. 

I just want a bit more beef in my burger so maybe next time I'll get a double beef patty Shake Stack

The milk shakes are ok, 5$ is kinda expensive but I like the many options for flavors. Tried chocolate with peanut butter and wished they put more chocolate than peanut butter. 

I would take Shake Shack over Earls any day of the week."}
{"text":"ShackBurger.  Burgers are cooked medium (pink in the dead middle.) Delicious, juicy and full of flavor!  I usually don't like buns, but they have a great bun, full of flavor and not just 'fluff'!   I usually want ketchup and mustard on the burger but the cheese is enough for me!  $5.19x2

Hot dog. Crispy beef dog, fried and split, on another awesome bun! $3.25

Crinkle cut fries. Awesome!  I usually find crinkle cut fries to be very soft, but not this place! $2.95 

Chocolate malt shake.  Definitely chocolately goodness! He loved it.  $5.25

Vanilla frozen custard. Creamy and rich. Definitely worth the calories. :D  $5.00  (I wanted the concrete but figured I'd better go for the classic for the first time.)

Lemonade. Refreshing. $2.75 

Prices = moderate. Total $31.97 for all of the above.  

Our only complaint... loud music made it hard to have conversation!

Service = self service. Order at the counter, and then pick up.  We snagged a table before ordering, because there were six of us.  There are two lines for ordering.....1) all menu items and 2) shakes/concretes/custard only!  And this place is known for lines whether at NYNY or in the State of NY! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had to try this NY import.  The burgers were tasty though a bit on the small size.  Fries were perfect.  My biggest problem was with the total bill of $27 for two burgers,  two fries and a soda and a shake. Can get the same from In and Out for less than half of that.  Shake Shack fries are better but is the place worth twice the price?"}
{"text":"Best. Burger. Joint. I've had five guys, habit, in and out, the hat, fat burger, Tommys and umami. Succulent meat, delicious sauce and best part they are au natural. You can even get a beer or wine. This place is modern , hip and tasty. There is a little bit of hype involved but that is mostly because you need to compare it to the above places not like a $14 burger from a restaurant.  Come on people. 

The kicker is the custard. Holy Mackerel. Crazy good. Had the red velvet and I dream of it daily. So unfair I have to go to the east coast or Vegas to satisfy my craving. 

Please come to Northern California. I'm begging."}
{"text":"What's good:
-Matcha Shake? REALLY GOOD.
-Shake shack burgers are just so good!
-Bacon cheeseburger
-Great location at New York New York
-Super fast service despite the large crowds
-Lots and lots of seating

What's meh:
-Pricey."}
{"text":"This place is really good, one of my favorite spots if I'm craving a burger. I've never tried the chicken, but it looks just as good! I usually get the shack burger which is one patty, cheese, tomato, lettuce, and shack sauce! I always add their hot sauce- so good! They offer a few select beers on tap which is cool. They even have alcoholic shakes! The name would lead you to believe they have endless flavors of shakes, they do have good and several options, just not as many as I had hoped for!"}
{"text":"Ordered: SmokeShack no sauce. Fries. Chocolate malted shake.

Burger: peppers nice, bacon standard but plentiful, patty good, cheese standard, bun I think was brioche but nothing special. Overall a good burger at a not bad price for a tourist trap.

Fries: excellent.

Shake: excellent

Service: efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"I've always heard about this place, and when I came to Vegas again I had to give it a try (I don't think they have any around where I'm from in California).

Shroom burger: so happy they had a vegetarian option! It was funny - the cashier clarified it had no meat and I told her I was aware (get the shack stack which has the mushroom and burger if you want meat). The mushroom was beautifully fried to a nice crisp, and it had so much cheese. YUM!

Cheese fries: I'm not a big crinkle cut fry person, I prefer shoestring fries. But these fries were really good!!! Crispy outside and not overly mushy inside. And did I mention cheese? Cheese makes everything better.

Blueberry pie oh my (concrete): honestly nothing spectacular. It was just soft icecream with a few pieces of blueberry pie but not much. Wouldn't order again.

The line was out the door when I went but it moves quickly! Also, I wish the burgers were larger (it's like 6 bites), but it's tasty and worth trying!"}
{"text":"The food is...decent, but not worth the money. We paid almost $30 for two burgers which were just bigger than a slider, cheese fries and two small drinks. I live in this area so I know it's not exactly cheap, but I could have gone to a sit down restaurant with better food and paid the same amount of money, so I would agree with the other reviews to not buy into the hype but it's worth a try...just make sure you save your pennies to be able to eat here and be prepared to still leave a little hungry."}
{"text":"Oh. My. LAWD. This place is fantastic. I went a little overboard and ordered a vanilla shake, fries, the shack Burger and a lemonade. A girls gotta eat, right? LOL.  

The burger is delicious. I think its the bread. And the meat. Super tender and flavorful. The bread omg. I love carbs. But they don't use a normal burger bun. I'm not sure what type of bun it is but its heavenly. Ugh. Drooling thinking about it. The fries are crinkle cut and crispy and crunchy on the outside and perfectly potato-y on the inside. Some burger places have bland fries. But not shake shack. Their fries are ON POINT. also the vanilla shake was delicious. Very creamy and nom. Ok yeah I went way overboard ordering this much food but like everything was amazing so its ok right? #treatyoself 

Prices are pretty high for a burger place. I wouldn't call it fast food. More like a hipster gourmet burger place. Higher up than in n out but less than a sit down/waiter service restaurant...if that makes sense. Anyways, come here and get a burger. And fries. And heck go for the shake too if you're feeling hungry. Worth it."}
{"text":"One of the slower locations without a doubt but i love me some shake shack.

Burger, cheese fries, shake. Perfection... If you like heart disease."}
{"text":"Vile. 

From the wet (not even just soggy, but genuinely drenched) bun, to the grease ball they called meat, this experience was deplorable. Couple that with the employees being as uncaring as possible, and it's a wonder this place is so popular. The burger was so disgusting neither me or my wife could eat it completely. And our bill? $28. Just wow. 

The workers looked like they were forced to be there against their will. Depressed, sad, uncaring. Mumbled their answers back. Was like being at the worst Burger King in the world, except the food wasn't edible like it is there. Look at the pictures we've attached of this stuff. It's THAT disgusting!

Dollar menus are better than this shrill, and I can't believe I'm saying that. It might be gmo free and antibiotic free, but it tasted like they used the squished bun to clean the cooktop with. 

For 30 bucks you could get Red Robin, or four meals at In and Out or Smash, all of which taste much better and actually fill you up. And they'll be so gracious as to give you ice in your water. At Shake Shack? Nah, you get warm tap water out of the self serve dispenser . You apparently didn't pay enough for ice. 

Abysmal. Go anywhere else. Seriously. Any low end place in the world that's in your mind. It's better than this severely overpriced garbage. You'd be better off with a stick of gum."}
{"text":"The people here are so nice, it is incredible. It's basically a fast food place, but they had a gal who came around every 10-15 minutes to ask if we needed anything. There was a line out the door, but every single staff person would help to answer any questions. We ended up sitting there for a couple hours enjoying the football games, but nobody rushed us even once. And the food is incredible as well.  Highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Shake shack in the outlet mall

For the very 1st time I ever went to this place I got the shack burger for me and my gf, I like the fact the burger taste good and and the shack sauce is so great. 

As a person from Hawaii that can't enjoy this back at home I'm glad this taste can linger in my mouth for some time


Thank you for great service today from the girl in the front who took our order

{"text":"We ordered two burgers, fries and a custom concrete. This place looks like a nicer version of In N Out with higher prices to match. My favorite part of this restaurant was the self-serve triple filtered water. Everywhere else in Vegas you have to pay for water or ask for a cup but this place makes it easy! The menu advertises fresh never frozen beef and potato buns but Shake Shack is missing the made from scratch quality of In N Out. The burgers were average. Their beef just didn't taste very good or seem juicy despite being cooked medium. The concrete (shake with mix ins) was the worst item. The mix ins were huge and chunky. This thing has to be eaten with a spoon. The soda straws that were available were not suitable for drinking a shake of this thickness. 

I tried this place for the hype but I rather have spent my calories on a Double Double at In-N-Out. My curiosity has been satisfied."}
{"text":"Meh... thought we would try Shake Shack.  Burger was small and pricey.  Tasted okay.  The chocolate shake was not good.  Tasted like hot cocoa mix was added to a cup of ice milk.  Don't recommend."}
{"text":"Like many of you, I heard about how great the Shake Shack chain is and couldn't wait to try their food.  

This restaurant is beautiful and modern, another venue that improved on the Chipotle clean industrial look. The airy spotless decor feels awesome. It's very comfortable and a definite speak easy with the folks next to you.  

The price point is like a Five Guys or Fuddruckers but that's where the comparison ends. SS has fresh ground beef on fresh rolls with seasoning that is delicious. Every menu item is made with the best ingredients and seasoning. The taste brings you to new heights generally reserved for the rich or really good cooks. I cannot remember having a better burger at a restaurant. My Strawberry milkshake was made with fresh Strawberries puréed and smoothed out and mixed with fresh Vanilla Ice Cream. The flavor will change your life and give you a new favorite.  

I could go on for hours...the bottom line is drop whatever you're doing find the closest SS and bask in the deliciousness that was formerly unattainable by the average citizen.  

This place deserves 100-Stars! But they only have 5."}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack as a fast food chain, but  HATED the service at this particular one.  I was staying at the Aria, so this location was just a short walk away.  Whoever was working at the Cashier on the night of Sunday Nov 13 ( It was the colored girl, nothing against people of color btw.), she must have been having a terrible night.  She was very rude and had that \"I hate my job\" attitude. Not a smile, not a thank you, NOTHING! Not what you want from someone taking your order. Thankfully, the food was good and what I have come to expect.  
If she hates her job so much, here's a tip, QUIT!!!

Got to watch the Patriots Vs. Seahawks too in the restaraunt. Cool."}
{"text":"Had the smokeshack burger, it was more spicy than I anticipated, but still really tasty and delicious. Fries were average, the shakes were dank. Would go again."}
{"text":"I didn't realize you could order a shake outside, so I joined a long queue for an expensive, small but tasty milkshake. 
Too slow, too small and too expensive to recommend."}
{"text":"Food was great!! Wish they had a location on the west side, but I will definitely come here again. The line was super long but surprisingly, it went by quick!!! Everyone only had to wait maybe 5 minutes for their food after the long wait in line.

Food was delicious!! The cheese fries are a little different, you have to acquire a taste for them because it's just totally different than what you'd think. Different kind of cheese. Food was hot and fresh... Was a little expensive though."}
{"text":"Strip location night and day to this one. Used the app for pickup, so they had half an hour to make my meal. Burger over cooked & grisly on the edges, shake sauce no flavor, fries were cold - not just room temperature but not cooked enough and still cold from being frozen. Bummer, will stick with In-n-Out, Strip's a little too far for a burger."}
{"text":"My opinion, I don't get it. Way over priced- but hey it's the strip, I get that. Cheese frys were ok I didn't care for my burger, or my custard - but I had the basic chocolate- it's not luv its! You can have a soda refill...but you have to wait at the counter for 5 minute ps while you for someone to get you a new cup. Why can't they have self serve fountain? I'm probably the only one who didn't love it. I saw , I came, I ate. Eh. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I loved Shake Shack when I had it last time I was in NYC. So now that there's one in the west coast, I couldn't wait to try it. The restaurant is right outside the hotel so it's visible on the street. We went there on Monday around 11:30am and there was a short line. Perfect! 

Here's what I got- 

I always get the Shack Stack which is a cheeseburger with fried portobello mushroom filled with melted cheddar and muenster cheese! It's sooo good! Definitely worth the 770 calories! Lol. (4/5) I'm taking off 1 star because I recently fell in love with the Miyagi burger at Bachi Burger, which is a 5 stars for me. 

I also tried the Shack Attack concrete which is a frozen chocolate custard with chocolate truffle cookie dough. Oh soooo yummy! If you love chocolate, you'll love this! (5/5)"}
{"text":"The burgers were very tasty but way to expensive to justify coming back. Yes they were good in flavor but almost 9 bucks for a burger was too much plus fries and then drink. The staff is rude not very pleasant and they seem to be annoyed when placing your orders. Dining area is not kept clean and the restrooms can also use a little cleaning. They have a nice patio area and pretty good size tables but honestly it's not worth the trip for the price or the rude services."}
{"text":"Shake Shack, we welcome to you Nevada.

I no longer have to look through Instagram photos and drool at the crinkle cut fries and shack burgers my friends are enjoying in New York.

The line here gets pretty long and despite the large dining area, it's sometimes difficult to find seats.  I usually try to get here right when they open or just before they close to avoid waiting too long.  And if you are here with others, have them scout a place to sit while you wait to order.  

My favorites here:
ShackBurger
Shack-cago Dog
Fries with cheese on the side

For dessert: 
Their frozen custard and concrete creations are delicious
If you just want dessert, you can just go to the C-line outside to pick up your dessert on your way out after you've enjoyed your meal.

As for the long debated question, \"In-n-out or Shake Shack\"?  Why does one have to compare? Just enjoy each for what they are -- I like them both!"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Shake Shack in NYC and am thankful they expanded to AZ! I go here every time I'm in Phoenix. I hope they open one in Tucson. I even ate at Shake Shack in Tokyo in September. I am a huge in n out fan, and I also love this place. I usually spend between $12-$16 on my meals, so it's definitely pricier than in n out. I usually get lemonade, fries, and a plain cheeseburger (occasionally adding lettuce). The food is cooked to order and the quality of the beef is great. I consider this restaurant quality even though it's a fast casual place. I prefer this over places like zin burger even. I like the wood tables and spacious layout."}
{"text":"So glad I don't have to fly to New York just for shake shack. Although I love my In-N-Out, I have to admit that Shake Shake wins the West Coast vs East Coast rivalry. Shake Shack is now my favorite fast food restaurant. The Shack Stack is a complete mouthgasm. The double double from In-N-Out has the better sauce, but the giant fried portobello mushroom with cheese from the Shack Stack is unbeatable. The fries here are crinkled-cut, usually not my favorite, but they're actually well seasoned and crispy. I definitely prefer them over Animal style fries. I need to come back and try their milkshakes."}
{"text":"The Shake Shack is known as an old American food at its best - affordable, tasty and plentiful. This location is on the Vegas Strip at the New York New York hotel. It has a good view from the patio. I ate here on Saturday evening and the place was pretty busy. Ordered a regular double hamburger without pickles and a regular order of fries. The burger was smaller than I expected. There was one leaf of lettuce, two unripe slides of tomato and a slice of onion. Meat patties were good size and good quality meat. Fries were so, so... 
All in all, not bad but a little pricey for me. Anyway, this is the Strip..."}
{"text":"How the heck does SS only get 3 1/2 stars? 

The burgers are amazingly delicious and the service is the best I've ever experienced from a hamburger joint..French fries are to notch too..Shakes are a little rich for my tastes, but overall the Shack has to get a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Overpriced burgers and hot dogs. Your burger or hot dog doesn't even COME with fries. You have to buy them separately. The hot dogs are cut in half when they cook them on the grill which means you don't feel the \"snap\" of that Vienna hot dog you purchased. And for a place with the word \"shake\" as part of its namesake... the chocolate shake was terrible. It was clearly vanilla ice cream with waaaaaaay too much Hershey's syrup added. How do you screw up a chocolate shake!??? And... you don't even get a PLATE to eat on. Your burger comes in this tiny wrapper. Stupid, stupid, stupid. We'll never be back."}
{"text":"This place is the best place to get burgers and shakes especially chocolate and vanilla shakes I love this place because their desserts in their food are so good that I would eat there every day you know it's kind 
of unhealthy every day is just but it's so good"}
{"text":"Very expensive for the portions. My wife and each got a burger and then shared fries, a soda and a milkshake. $32.00. 

The burgers were super average. Not even worth taking the time to discuss them. Trendy idea designed to be mass produced. I had to go back up and confirm the coffee milkshake was actually a coffee milkshake because its tasted like an ordinary chocolate shake. 

I understand why the hip crowd like this place. It was very well designed, clean and the staff was friendly. The game was on multiple tv's and the staff stopped by our table a few times to check on us."}
{"text":"Burgers: Vegetarians will love the Veggie Shroom Burger, a deep fried Portobello mushroom stuffed with Muenster (I think) cheese. He had a regular Hamburger which was pretty decent! Crinkle Cut fries - Good! Not the greatest but then again you don't really come to the Shake Shack for fries. 

The Shakes - So good - we had the Caramel and Strawberry, next time I'll stick with my usual tried and true Strawberry. 

Overall Shake Shack is pretty decent (I say decent because I have no way to compare it to the original Shake Shack, never having been there - but it's nowhere close to my favorite In N Outs). If you're looking for a break from the $$$ meals on the Strip, it's a decent choice, but probably won't be back here the next trip."}
{"text":"Visited this place during EDC week, so a line was expected. Not a big fan of the crinkle cut fries (reminds me of the soggy ones in elementary school) but these were actually hot and crispy! The burger was delicious, but definitely not worth the long wait. Will try some of their desserts next time around. Overall a good place to get a burger fix in Vegas over Mickey D's and other typical fast food joints."}
{"text":"I had only a hamburger with shack sauce. There is nothing special about the shack sauce, though the burger was delicious. I would stick to ketchup/mustard next time."}
{"text":"Didn't know that they had a shake shack in Summerlin. Anyways, compared to the one in NYNY, it's WAY less crowded and the service is on point.

For example, after ordering your food, there are always people asking if you want a refill at no extra charge. 

The burger is on point as always, and whenever I'm on the West side of Vegas, I'll definitely stop by at least once. 

Not much else to say about this place, other than when you book an airbnb in Summerlin, it definitely beats the 1+ hour wait time at other locations."}
{"text":"Damn shake shack, your food is so bomb.

Anyways, we're here for EDC weekend so expect the lines to be quite long as usual, which for us the place was packed and had about an hour long line that stretched to the outside. Even in the hot sun, the staff were very helpful giving out menus beforehand, running the built-in mist machines and handing out free cone-esque water cups outside. I had the double smoke stack with a shack Cago dog which is are both so tender and juicy, so think of this like a gourmet dine-in. Note that the smoke stack doesn't come with lettuce if you're into that, but everyone seemed to enjoy their time here and always order 2 things so you don't starve!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack was good. Solid burger, good fries and hey, they serve beer. Gotta have a brew with your burger. Very clean and fast."}
{"text":"Shake stack is very juicy and tender. Cinnamon dulce leche shake is smooth, rich and sweetness is just nice. Fries has an interesting taste with the red pepper!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the grossest places I've ever been to. I went to the one in Atlanta Georgia and It was very good. This one was overpriced and overrated. First off It took 30 minutes to order, and when I ordered I was amazed at how expensive everything was. After taking a bite of my meal It was disgusting. It's a poor man Swensons. I would not recommend this place save your money trust me. I'm an 18 year old man and me and all my friends thought It wasn't worth It. DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for the dog's birthday. We ordered him 2 grilled plain hamburger patties and a pooch-ini. He loved it.  They're so dog friendly and most of the time bring him his own clean bowl of water. 

This gourmet take on classic fast food serves tasty treats in bite size. Even as a female that eats less than most, many times I am still hungry after eating a Shake shack burger and fries. You may want to order two burgers preemptively. Don't get me wrong, I still love the place. The ingredients, customer service, and community service is of the highest quality which are all important to me. 

As a vegetarian the only option is the 'shroom burger and fries. It's great. I come here for it often.  

We've been to many Shake Shacks around the country and this is the only location where you can get your food in less than 10 min from walking in!  Here's a no-line-Shake-shack!"}
{"text":"I thought this was a great tasting cheeseburger, with fresh tasting ingredients. Like other Yelpers have stated though, the price is a bit steep for what you get. I should not be hungry after eating a double cheeseburger. I was not very impressed with their fries which were the crinkle cut fries with what tasted like a cheap canned cheese sauce. No comparison to In N Out burger. If I came again i'd get the double cheeseburger again and the Shack-cago dog, which with tax would probably set you back $16..."}
{"text":"Long lines but fast service.
The burgers are delicious. Try the shake burger.
 The bun is wonderful. The cheese fries are also amazing 
Custard was pretty good"}
{"text":"Good burger quick service for the amount of customers but definitely not worth the price. I'd say it's super comparable to in-n-out BUT costs $20+ for two ppl instead of $10-12. The hype wasn't enough to go back but it wasn't waste the one visit"}
{"text":"We will go back to Shake Shack for sure! Great \"feel\" and will look forward to having a few beers next time- I was surprised they served them! We ordered a double burger and chicken sandwich and shared an order of fries.  Everything tasted great and we left very satisfied.  We were going to get a shake on our way out the door but the line was too long so we have to return!  Better quality burger than five guys, smashburger or the habit... Not as good as switch or fez (but about the same price)."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming here and other than the fact that it cost $34 for my wife and I, I have zero complaints. The attention to detail in the food is amazing. Super fresh tasting and how can you complain about that. The price can be justified by the quality. If you want a cheap burger go to mcdonalds you tight asses."}
{"text":"If you plan on grabbing something quick DO NOT COME HERE. 
I placed a mobile order at 11:52am and did not receive it until 12:27pm. And that was only due to me getting a manager to help me. 
They have over 18 workers in there and still can't get it together. 

Food is good. 
So, Go when you have time to waste in life."}
{"text":"Heard so many people rave about this place so maybe my expectations were too high. I ordered a cheese burger lettuce wrap style...was sloppily wrapped and the burger was rare inside. Big yuck!!! Was also too thick for my liking. My grasshopper milkshake was runny and the mint flavor (which I usually love) had a medicinal flavor to it. Only thing good was I met some friends here but the food was diss appointing!"}
{"text":"Adam and I went to the Shake Shack in New York City a couple of years ago and we really enjoyed it so once we realized we were somewhere that had a Shake Shack we knew we had to come here. 

We did not want to go all the way to New York New York and probably wait in a crazy line with other tourists so when my husband and I were leaving Vegas we decided to stop here and we were so happy we did. 

The restaurant is in a little plaza with plenty of space and parking. We went in and we were incredibly surprised that there wasn't much of a line at all. As we were looking at the menu to decide what we wanted we actually had to let people in front of us because it was moving too fast. 

In the end we wound up getting the same thing. We both got fries and a SmokeShake. My husband got a double and I got a single but it was so delicious I wish I got a double. It came out quickly and hot and was cooked to perfection with a ton of flavor. I don't really eat much beef, maybe about once a month, so if I wanted more, then it was really good. 

The restaurant had a ton of seating and we were able to quickly find somewhere to sit down and eat that was comfortable for us. 

The staff for the most part was pretty friendly. I didn't have any personal issues but I could tell that the cashier who was taking our order was training and I felt that the trainer was pretty short with the new staff member. The new staff member spelled my name incorrectly which to me isn't a big deal at a burger place, this isn't a legal document and it isn't going to make any difference. If the name Daniel was called out and I was able to tell it was everything I ordered I would have known it was for me. My name is spelled incorrectly all the time, it is just one of those names. The trainer could have been a bit kinder about it to the new staff member. I even said it isn't a big deal, I would know it is my order. If this is such a big deal then they need to find a different system, most likely by straight out asking for the customer to spell their name but chances are if the name is being spelled incorrectly, that isn't the first time it has happened to that customer and they would know the order is for them. 

Overall, I was very happy with my experience here. I loved the food and I would certainly come back and I suggest others try it out here. It is a great burger!"}
{"text":"Disappointment. 
I remember when Shake Shack first opened and everyone was super super excited. I made sure I came in to try this place out (if you know me, you know my obsession of burgers). The whole interior and exterior design is beautiful. You seriously cannot miss it. The restaurant front is right on the Strip at New York New York. The signage is huge and clear with their outside patio area. Then you get in and everything is super modernized and very attractive. 
Anyway, many people compare Shake Shack with In-N-Out (Shake Shack being the East Coast burger joint, and In N Out being the west side's). First off... 1. In n Out prices are way more affordable. Shake Shake's prices are pretty high for practically mini burgers, and the fries come with so little as well. The size and price dont match up. 2. In n Out's simplicity and their signature sauce is just so original and yummy, Shake Shack is okay...and really salty if you ask me.. 

I dont know, MY OPINION: not a huge fan of Shake Shack. Maybe I came on a bad day and need to give it another try, but as for my first impression, ehhh ill stick to In N Out - the west coast original!!"}
{"text":"While out and about in the too malls, I needed a quick bite for lunch and Shake Shack as right there so I thought I would give it a try. I got a hotdog, a chocolate shake and I shared some fries. The hot dog was ok, and the fries were fine. For a place called \"Shake Shack\" I expected the shake to be a bit more impressive. Everything was ok, but The prices were high and the food wasn't that great."}
{"text":"quick, friendly service, only held up by confused tourists deciding on their orders  ahead of you. 

I'm a Californian, so I'm gonna say it: in n out cheeseburger beats shake shack cheeseburger. however, in n out fries  beats shake shack fries. I said it. no shame. I liked shake snacks crinkle cuts more than in n out's shoestring. 

the lemonades are even, though."}
{"text":"Are you ready for what you thought you would never Dare say?! Omg is this better then \"In n out!\" its pretty darn close! The meat is seasoned to perfection and no cardboard fries here lol  
Try Shack Shack and you will be addicted trust me!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the French fries taste great and everything taste great.we even brung home the French fries so we can eat.we got 2 hamburgers which were AMAZING!!!!!we got a milk shake and delicious French fries!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time in Vegas, I'm attending EDC. The burgers and cheese fries were so delicious. I recommend everybody have their food!"}
{"text":"Really good place and actually pretty good space if you have small children with car seats or strollers . The 50/50 drink is really good ! Down side for me is there's not a combo everything is separate . But other than that I would totally recommend it"}
{"text":"Line was short on a Tuesday night, burgers were great but they charge for adding toppings like lettuce tomatoes and onion on burgers that don't include it. I wish they had more topping options and told you how much to add them on the signage. Fries were good but cheese fries were nasty, regular fries tasted like they have no salt on them but have a good texture. chocolate shake is kinda weird and has a powdered chocolate (think Ovaltine) texture. so I'd give it 3/5!"}
{"text":"Worth the hype. Try their Shake Stack! Such a good burger!! Strawberry lemonade on the other hand... Lacking. Fries are good too with the cheese!"}
{"text":"Tastes and operates exactly like their locations in NYC! I'm so happy I no longer have to make the cross country trek for my favorite (sorry In-N-Out and Five Guys) burger joint! Despite just opening, the lines moved along in a timely manner and it wasn't impossible trying to find a table indoors. It is kinda pricey in comparison to other burger places but the quality justifies every single penny. The hubby ordered the double shake shack burger and I got the mushroom burger (mushrooms in lieu of a beef patty) and we were in heaven! They serve crinkle cut fries here which are crisp and not soggy at all. It is pretty noisy  in here and towards the back there are game tables that the kids definitely crowd around. We finished off our meal by going back in line and grabbing some neopolitan shakes and my oh my they were AMAZING! We will definitely be regulars here and I am so thankful this location opened up to service all of us here in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Mmm. Drove from LA for the grand opening and got stuck in traffic both ways. Still gotta say it was worth it. Especially since I scored sunglasses and wristbands. They ran out of shirts right before me though. Sadness. 

I got the shack stack and I think they took more care packing the shroom with cheese for the opening because it was packed with cheese. It melted out and squirted everywhere. I don't remember that when I got the burger in NY. 

The all shook up concrete was good and the fries were better than I remember. The inside was nice and creamy and salted perfectly.

The staff was super nice and the line moved quickly. I had to get in line for another shack stack because 1 didn't cut it for me. 

I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I just went here for the first time after reading the mediocre Yelp reviews, but hearing good things.  I ordered a double cheeseburger with all the veggies.  It was surprisingly delicious.  The meat and cheese was very flavorful and oozed with tasty grease.  I would have to say it's better than 5 Guys, the most obvious direct competitor.  (In N Out is half the price for a similarly tasty burger, so that probably gets the nod.)

I didn't order any fries or shake so I can't speak to those, but the burger was excellent."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place out as I had never been to a Shake Shack before but my husband enjoyed eating there when living in NY.

Easily found on the Vegas strip outside the New York New York Hotel. M life members get to bypass the line of customers and go straight to registers to order and pay, so that's a definite plus as there is usually a line, but it moves quickly.

Got the regular hamburger, crinkle fries, coffee frozen custard, and shack cago dog. All were delicious!"}
{"text":"Had to come see what Shake Shack was all about! Indoor and outdoor seating. The bf and I ordered a chocolate cookies n cream shake, bacon cheese fries, the chick n shack and smoke shack. 

The shake was really good! So creamy and it had the perfect thickness! The fries and chicken sandwich were good too. The smoke shack tasted alright. I know it's like one of their signature items and it has their special shack sauce but it just tasted a little dry to me and just like an average cheeseburger. Would return if Im ever in SoCal again!"}
{"text":"I just want to start off by saying I'm a die hard In-n-Out fan, so it takes a special kind of burger to truly impress me. I've been hearing about Shake Shack for months now and finally decided to try it. OMG! Why did I wait so long to try them??? I love simple burgers. I'm not into all the fancy bells and whistles other places add to their burgers to compensate for the lack of flavor from the beef itself. SS keeps it simple, and boy oh boy is their beef tasty. Thin patties, crispy edges, juicy, and full of flavor. Very simple ingredients, and very fresh. Such a flavorful burger! And the way they stack the ingredients looks like a work of art, you almost feel guilty for eating it. There is one thing that stood above their burgers though, their customer service. I'm not sure if she was the manager or owner or both, but ma'am I applaud your customer service. Truly an amazing burger and experience. I WILL BE BACK."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about Shake Shack I was excited to see one conveniently located a few blocks north of NYNY. We're from California so everyone knows the West Coast favorite is In and Out. The first thing I noticed was Shake Shack's larger menu. They have singles and doubles like In and Out but they also offer chicken, hotdogs and a family favorite- crinkle fries. They also have a variety of shakes and custards.

Now for the great debate. All of the food was good. The burger was warm, flavorful, slightly greasy, served with lettuce, tomato and shack sauce between soft buns. Did I like it?  Yes. Was it better than In and Out? In my opinion no. It's personal preference really. I've just been spoiled by large stacked burgers, toasted buns and large slices of fresh lettuce, onion, tomato and In and Out sauce. Would I eat Shake Shack again- heck yea! Shake Shack's fries are better than In and Outs, I loved their crisp crinkle fries topped with cheese. Their chocolate milkshake was thick with just the right amount of sweetness. We're back home in California so I guess I won't be having any Shake Shack anytime soon unless we go on a trip to the E. Coast or back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced for what you get, they don't understand West Coast sizing, and that we like to get our own soda. Oh and they screwed up my first order ever on the burger and having flat soda.

Food was okay but not worth the high prices."}
{"text":"Place is nice, service was pretty good, and the shake I got was delicious. I had one mix-in ingredient that was different than what I asked for, but it wasn't the end of the world and still tasted good."}
{"text":"They're good burgers, don't get me wrong, but for the price I'd prefer inn n out. Wasn't impressed with there options maybe I was expecting more because of what I've heard about them. But definitely wouldn't turn one away, but like I said wouldn't be my first option for a burger."}
{"text":"This place is amazing the burgers are better then in and out burger fat burger smash burgers and five guys Shake shack is amazing I also love because they serve beer there chicken sandwich is amazing to better than Chick-fil-A"}
{"text":"Some positives and a few negatives about this new kid on the block (in AZ).
Fries w/Cheese - solid, crisp fries with a light (non ballpark) tasty cheese sauce
Burgers - you have to ask for well done. Cherry Peppers and bacon and cheese was a new flavor combination for me - worked well.
Custard - Either it melted during eating meal or was never solid, but this was a soupy mess with pieces of blueberry pie scattered throughout the custard.
Prices - About 2 bucks too high on the Burgers, but everything else is normal price.

There was no line at around 1pm. If at the mall, probably would grab another burger, but nothing to go out of the way to eat especially since this area has alot of upgraded burger choices."}
{"text":"Tried to eat at Shake Shack. Couldn't get a Shroom Burger without cheese. The only hamburger place I've been to that you can't get your hamburger the way you want it. If you can't eat dairy, I guess you can't eat there!"}
{"text":"Nothing special at all. Just another hype that's not true. Long line, hard to find tables, whatever burger. I'm good with In and out."}
{"text":"My love for Shake Shack runs deep. So deep in fact, I'm willing to brave the weekend Vegas crowds on the Strip to get to it. This is blasphemy as a native Californian but for me, it's even better than In N Out. The burgers are juicy, the buns soft and tasty. Their secret sauce is tangy and amazing. Plus, did I mention cheese fries? Yes their delicious fries covered in an ooey gooey cheese sauce. Where do I sign? I like the drink offerings they have too. They have alcohol and they always have some kind of special fruit lemonade. 

The builders were smart and knew this place would attract crowds so it's pretty huge. It does get crazy busy though (like line out the door busy) so it's good they opened the park right next door as that added some outdoor seating. They have the queue thing down too. Every time I've been here, even among the crowds, the staff is always super upbeat and friendly. They also get your food our super fast. My favorite is the regular Shackburger and as previously mentioned, Cheese Fries. Their Mango Lemonade is super tasty too as are their Arnold Palmers. 

The prices here are more than an In N Out or even a Habit. I don't think the regular Shake Shack's on the East Coast are as pricey, there's just a Vegas markup here. But it's still much more affordable than any of the fancy sit down places and it's a tasty, quick meal for sure.

The key is to go at kind of off times (so not right at noon or 6 o clock). But, it is Vegas so I think it's probably always fairly busy. If you're staying at Monte Carlo or New York New York, you're literally just steps away anyway. 

Now if they could just open one in SoCal that's closer than Santa Monica..."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of burgers so this wasn't my choice to come but my friends wanted to try it so we came! I've had the shake shack in New York and although I can't speak for the burgers, the shake I had in NY was wayyyyy better than here.

We got the shack stack which is the burger with the portobello mushroom, everyone told us it was a must order, but I was very unimpressed with it. It tasted super ordinary, wasn't very flavorful and definitely did not justify the hefty price tag.

Also got the cheese fries. They didn't taste very crispy or fresh and the cheese was like nacho cheese almost but I think nacho cheese tastes even better.

I was really hoping the milk shake would save the meal but I was yet again disappointed. We got the strawberry shake it was worse than any fast food shake I've ever had. Super bland and had an incredible amount of whipped cream.

Over priced and super meh. I would prefer not to come back."}
{"text":"The Shack Stack at Shake Shack is s surprisingly successful merge of the traditional burger and a \"Shroom burger\". It's a fast food chain, so no one should be appalled at how their version of a vegetarian burger features a deep-fried cheese-stuffed mushroom cap. The vegetarian diet is not strictly synonymous with healthy. But I digress.

It's a tasty burger. A bit too much going on for my personal preference, but definitely something different to try. Beef is fresh, mushroom cap is hot and cheesy, and I found the tangy Shack Sauce added a little something extra. In the future, I'd rather get either the standard Shack Burger OR the Shroom Burger rather than combining them. I wasn't blown away, but I was pleasantly surprised.

For those irate about prices and wait times, it's on the Strip... so deal with it. Try a weekday evening after 8 and you'll have minimal wait. Price inflation isn't any different than WhiteCastle trying to sell $8 burgers, and it's cheaper than a flight to the East coast.

PS, crinkle cut fries are overrated but they don't suck."}
{"text":"Good quality. Bill was $27 for two people. Ordered 2 burgers, 1 fry, 1 drink and a shake."}
{"text":"This place actually isn't that bad. It sounds so good since this is the only location on closest to the west coast. The burgers are pretty good! There's nothing really special about it but compared to In N Out, they have better options than just a regular hamburger or cheeseburger. The bun isn't toasted either which is why In N Out seems better. The patty was pretty juicy in the SmokeShack (the one with bacon) and it did have a kick to it. Definitely something different and nicer for a fast food burger place. The inside looks so nice and they have a separate window for just shakes and ice cream so you don't have to wait in the line. 

But hands down, the shakes are a lot better than In N Out. Try Black&White or Neapolitan shake. Another thing that I thought was good was the Jackpot concrete (frozen custard with Belgian waffle pieces, strawberry purée, and sprinkles). They definitely have better ice cream that's worth a try!!

For real tho, don't compare this place to In N Out... This place is still pretty bomb. I'm definitely gonna try to come back when I'm back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"All I can say is come here if you're a burger fan. One of the best chain burgers I've had in a long time! Loved the Shack Burger there. I'm totally hooked on it. Can't wait to visit the Glendale, CA location and continue my journey through the menu.

They have a very efficient and fast way to order with the registers open and tons of available seating so if you see a line outside, don't let that discourage you. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised!

The burger is good enough to eat alone. The beef is perfect with just the right amount of fresh lettuce, tomatoes and onions. The bun was perfect. It made the burger. Don't know what they make it out of but it's not too flaky or hard. Its's soft and fresh and absorbs the juices to make it a perfect burger. 

Trust me on this, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Clean bathrooms. The chick n shack is amazing and the fries and the strawberry pie ice cream. Overall, it was the most food coma experience ever.  Quick service. Great taste. Worth the price. Total spent $15"}
{"text":"It's 12:04pm on Friday, June 22, 2018 and you're out of burgers! How is that possible? It's Friday lunchtime and you can't even get a freakin Burger! And you don't have the buttermilk chicken either? I don't want no blasted hot dog! You're not known for your hot dogs. You're known for your Burgers, Fries & Shakes. I'm disappointed! I know now to call before I come to this location. I drove over 30 miles to get here because I wanted to try it out. Maybe I'll try it again - maybe not. I would recommend that anyone call first before coming here to see if they actually have Burgers. According to the lady at the door they've been waiting since 9 a.m. and they'll \"be there any minute now.\" I turned around and walked away with several other people. Not impressed!"}
{"text":"Always happy to come back to Vegas and have
my favourite burger and fries! Portions are huge so you can share with people.  
Food is pretty good but expect to wait a long line to order.  We took the double burger, burger with mushrooms, fries and strawberry milk shakes."}
{"text":"We have been hearing about this chain for several years and I finally tried it. The burgers are absolutely incredible!  The flavor of the beef was great & the fries & beer rounded out a great meal!  I can't wait to try the shakes & concretes next time. Don't miss this awesome place to eat!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The service was great I really love how friendly and efficient the staff were. The chicken burger taste great. The sauce really compliments the chicken. The fries is just wow I love it"}
{"text":"I was hyped about going to the Shack after reading all the hype  on the internet about this place.  Well it was okay as all 3 individuals in our party thought the same. Even down to the cheese fries nothing to right home about...  Well the shack is no longer on my list of favorite burgar joints"}
{"text":"This is by far the best burger in Las Vegas.  Unfortunately, I mostly don't eat meat anymore, but their cheesy Mushroom Burger is also very tasty and worth repeat visits.  The Shack Stack (best pronounced in an exaggerated Chicago accent) is the ultimate.  It stacks the regular Shack Burger together with the cheesy Mushroom Burger.  I love how their buns are U-shaped so they captured all the drippings from your burger rather than letting them escape into your hand or onto your tray.

Their crinkle-cut fries are mediocre in my opinion.  Similar to frozen stuff my mom would've heated up in the oven for us growing up.

Their order takers are always friendly and engaging, and the dining room attendants are always prompt and efficient.  The decor is really unique and fun.  We always take out of town guests here at least once per visit."}
{"text":"Having high hopes for Shake Shack, I will say I left pretty disappointed.

Being a gourmet burger chain & having a pretty big cult following, I had some pretty high expectations. My wife and I ordered a Shack Burger, Shack-cago Dog, 2 fries and a soda. The burger was cooked nicely, but the bun was soggy and cold. The size of the burger was smaller than most gourmet burgers I've eaten but still carried the high price tag. The hot dog tasted like an average hot dog but was butterflied, so it had a nice crisp every bite. The fries were hot but had no seasoning and simply tasted sub par to other burger chains.

Overall, my wife and I were not impressed with Shake Shack. The quality of the food in my opinion does not warrant the gourmet price tag."}
{"text":"There really aren't many places that will compare to the one and only shake shack! Originally from Brooklyn, NY so I know all about it. Vegas didn't know what it was missing! So glad I still have the option to grab one of their amazing burgers and a shake when I get the craving!"}
{"text":"Great selection of Burgers, drinks and shakes, floats, etc. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"In short: Individuals with disabilities are not only an inconvenience but worse yet a laughing stock to the staff and the manager at Shake Shack.

Went here tonight (Sunday 8-13) for a late night burger after a movie. In the past, on our visits to Shake Shack we've enjoyed good food and at least mediocre customer service. Tonight as we left the restaurant just after 10 pm, we found the front door locked. One of the female staff members behind the counter informed us that we would have to go to the door on the far side of the restaurant. We told her that it would be easier for us if we could just unlock it. She said no, but seeing the twist lock we unlocked the door. I held up my cane and informed her that it was difficult for me to walk far. She glared, shook her head, rolled her eyes and walked away. I walked out the door, rethought it, and decided it would be good to get her name to complain formally to management the next day. Upon re-entering the restaurant, another female worker informed me that the other female worker who rolled her eyes \"didn't hear.\" Shocked, I informed her that I held up my cane, and I know she saw it as she was staring straight at me. The female worker who rolled her eyes and glared came out, telling me that she couldn't hear. I told her I knew she saw my cane. She quickly informed me that she had epilepsy, a matter entirely beyond the point, and would never discriminate. I asked for her name, and she went for the manager not telling me. The manager finally came out and apologized for the discriminatory and out rightly rude behavior. He informed me he would speak with her, yet  he also was not wearing a name tag and did not give her name or his own. Names are apparently top secret as it allows them to continue a history mocking customers - something that became very visible after scrolling through only two pages of reviews on this location. As we drove off, she had her arm slung on his shoulder and the two were laughing their heads off. One day they will know what it feels like to walk in my shoes. Everyone, as Joe Kennedy stated, will be brought to their knees one day by a diagnosis or accident; it's sad that these two are so incredibly callous individuals that even that may not help them to feel empathy towards others."}
{"text":"just SHAKE it!

As this review is LONG OVERDUE, I'll just summarize the main points:

1.  Located at New York, New York.  Shake Shack is actually located outside the hotel/casino.  Look for the various signs and arrows to help you find your way to this indigenous NYC establishment.  I walked over from the Luxor and all the signage was extremely helpful.

2.  Indoor and outdoor seating available.

3.  The menu is pretty straight forward:  Burgers, fries, shakes, and drinks.  I ordered a smoke shack burger, fries (crinkle cut), and a lemonade.  My downfall was not ordering a shake.  I must have been out of my mind honestly for failing to have the product synonymous with its name.  Well, I guess there's always a next time (which I'm sure there will be).

4.  The burger was outstanding!!  I first visited SS on a visit to NYC two years ago, and I will say that the food is as good as I remember it to be.  The burger was juicy and well prepared, while the bacon provided that extra goodness of flavor.  It was so delicious!  The fries were pretty awesome too; good portion and very crispy.  

5.  The setting / atmosphere is spacious, airy and fun.  The service is efficient and quick.  The staff that helped me at the order counter was friendly but to the point as to keep the line moving.  Incidentally, the line moved at a very decent pace.  I didn't want to wait too long for my food as I observed that the kitchen operated as a well-conditioned machine; everyone has a specific job and all seemed very capable and productive.  The staff in the indoor dining room kept things neat and tidy.

BOTTOM LINE:  The burgers and fries are awesome!  Its cool and convenient to have this NYC eatery in Vegas.  I'll be back....... for a SHAKE!"}
{"text":"Not too bad. 

It is a little pricey but the burgers are tasty.

My favorite is a double Shackburger and some fries. Hotdogs are split and griddled and fairly decent.

Parking can be an adventure if you visit at the wrong time.

Service is friendly and fairly quick. Restaurant was clean and accommodating.

If you haven't been here, try it out!"}
{"text":"Heaven in a bun. I love you Shake Shack! You are worth every single calorie."}
{"text":"Stopped in while I was at the mall for a little ice cream.  I ordered the ice cream concretes and was thoroughly disappointed.  The items weren't mixed together well, size was on the very small side and it was $7.  See pic!"}
{"text":"I am a Henderson resident have been to Shake Shack twice. 

I went the first time in early February which was not too long after it opened. I'm not a huge burger fan by any means, but these are DELICIOUS, especially for the expected quality. (I expected cheaper quality due to the price, speed of service, etc.) I was amazed at how much flavor the burgers had, in addition to the juiciness and seasoning of the patties. The buns are soft and compliment the patties well. 

As for the French fries, wow. Outstanding. I honestly don't enjoy crinkle-cut fries usually, but I was blown away by the ones here! I order the cheesy ones, and they have a perfect amount of cheese. Enough to cover your fries, but not in an excessive manner. NOTE: if you don't like cheap cheese, don't order the cheese fries. 

I did not order the shakes because the prices for the size were high. Regardless, everything else was great! 

The service was shockingly quick both times I went. The first time, I waited in a line of at least 30 people for maybe 10 minutes. I received my food about 15 minutes after ordering. 

I recommend this place to tourists, residents, couples on dates, etc. the food is extremely affordable for the most part, and the quality is outstanding."}
{"text":"Got the smoke shack and bacon cheese fries. Burger is one of the best I've had in a long time! Must try if you've never had."}
{"text":"Two words, tender and delicious burger. Long lines but goes fast and very friendly service. Different category than in&out burger. More of restaurant type burgers thats tasty good."}
{"text":"The food was very good just very pricy I got a burger cheese with bacon fries and a drink and it was 19$ ! There are no combos very clean place"}
{"text":"I love the taste of the burger and crinkle cut fries and I appreciate that shake shack uses all fresh and responsibly raised ingredients.

However, I find it to be way overpriced and I don't see the value in it. A double cheeseburger is over $8 and fries and/or drinks aren't included in the price. 

I wish they would have a happy hour...that would definitely get me in the door."}
{"text":"good food, quick service. i am a major shake shack fan, so i was excited to find one at my hotel! i stopped in to grab a quick lunch after one of my meetings. i'm used to long slow lines in new york, and this place had none of that. line was short and moved really quick. food was tasty. could have used a bit more shack sauce on the burger, but otherwise, it was a quality munchie. i'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"I honestly don't eat burgers. Because my stomach can't handle junk foods. But I fall in love with shake shack burger and this is first burger I haven't get sick my stomach in my life. I think I can eat shake shack burger whole day!! I am so loving it!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars! 
This Shake Shack location is hit or miss in my opinion; sometimes it's a solid 4 as rated, but frequently, due to inadequate service, it's more around a 2.5-3. 

With its prime District location, it can get busy around lunch and I personally think they are rarely staffed appropriately to handle the demand. The counter staff seems a little disengaged and the ordering process can be tedious. 

The food is generally consistent and always good. My personal favorite is the seasonal spicy chicken, if only it could be a standard menu item! Spicing batter and slaw shouldn't be that much of a permanent menu tweak as they have the regular crispy chicken on the everyday menu. The cheese fries are beyond reproach and live up to their reputation; I'm not even a \"nacho cheese\" sauce person and I love theirs. 

I also have to say, similar to the rest of the (generally) apathetic/mediocre service, the shuffleboard is very poorly maintained. It's a bummer to have such a fun, unique feature but have it nearly unusable almost all the time. It's also slightly a pet peeve of mine that they waste a new cup for every drink refill (and don't have recycling disposal); the one I was given when I got my meal 10 mins ago is fine. Not very eco friendly Shake Shack:("}
{"text":"Great burgers with cheese but fries could be better.  Service was done in a good amount of time."}
{"text":"Went here to compare it to in n out. I got the shack stack burger and cheese fries. The fries were definitely better than in n out but in my opinion the burger at in n out is way better. Especially if you compare the value. Shake shack is almost twice the price of an in n out burger. The shack stack was definitely good but for the price I'd rather go get a gourmet burger and pay slightly more. Good food. Line isn't too bad. And I like that you can preorder online unlike in n out. But if I were to chose between the two, I'd definitely chose in n out over shake shack. Still good food though"}
{"text":"Eager to try as this was my first experience at the Shack! Everything inside and out is modern and new so design-wise it looks pretty spectacular.

There almost no line when I came in. There was someone handing out menus but since there was no line I had to think fast! I went with the SmokeShack single burger with peppers and bacon. I also got a side of crinkle fries and their mango lemonade.

This place has so many people in the kitchen. There must've been at least 30 people back doing all kinds of cooking and assembly. As it wasn't too busy I didn't think it was going to take long with all those people but it still took about ten minutes which was a little odd. Not too big of a deal but still worth mentioning. I got my order to-go as the dining room was packed.

The burger, toppings and bun were so delicious! The bun is nice and soft and the bacon was thick and crispy. The sauce and peppers were the perfect combination of flavors to match with the patty. The only thing is that the portion is tiny for the price. It's a $7 burger and its not much bigger than a McDouble at Mickey D's. Still the quality is excellent so that's worth forgiving.

The fried aren't anything to write home about but they were nice and crispy the mango lemonade was good but it was a little too sweet and syrupy.

Overall Shake Shack serves some pretty good food. There are plenty of friendly people behind the counter and the place is nice and clean. If you can overlook the tiny portions (relative to price) I think you'd like it too!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Had the chicken sandwich after taking a look at someone else's burger. Fried in a strange way - tasted okay. French Fries came out hot, but again were nothing special. Did not care for the chocolate shake, but really liked the strawberry shake.  With so many other burger places to go, this one does not make the cut."}
{"text":"I really feel bad for people who cant enjoy the burgers here. It is a thousand times better than some of the 2 star people mentioned. By a long shot. Im so glad there is one on my side of town now. It is pricey but its worth it. I crave the black and white shake all the time. The last time i came i got the shroom burger and it was STUFFED with my favorite cheeese. So much so that i was able to dip a few fries in what dripped out lol. Everything is piping hot when its recieved. The customer service is awesome. I was addressed by my name at the time of order (once she got it). I appreciated that. Also im the type who watches employees just for the fun of it i guess, but they were keeping everything clean and stocked at the condiment bar what felt like every 5 minutes lol i could be over exaggerating but ITS CLEAN !! also i didnt expect the girl who wipes down tables to offer a refill on our soda, that was awesome ! They also dont mind taking your trays when youre done so you dont have to, which sets them apart from a bunch of other burger places. I will return and hopefully never have a bad experience here! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Sooo tasty no wonder long line.  The burger is a bit smaller than I expected but way better than IN -N -OUT!  Please open chains in the Bay Area, CA"}
{"text":"Food is a little overpriced for what you get, but the food is not bad. Hubs was not a fan. I'd say it's like in n out and five guys got together and had a hipster baby that likes cheese wiz and dogs. I found it delicious but greasy. Hubs is not a fan due to the amount of grease. The burger is small and you could prob get away with eating two burgers.... fries came out crunchy and hot. The sodas are behind the counter and you must ask for refills. We're in vegas and spoiled and not used to places like that. The shack burger was good cause of the cheese plus cheese sauce, no mayo or ketchup comes on it, but you don't really need it. Did not have the shakes or dogs. But I will have to come back with my kiddies without hubs. I really enjoyed one of the employees. I should of got his name, but he is REALLY tall and slim, white guy. He went far above and beyond what I expect of a fast food place. He asked if I needed help with getting condiments since I was holding a baby and pushing a stroller. He was quick to clean up our trays and was Johnny on the spot to clean the tables. He also took care of moving the highchair and opened the door for us as we left. If management sees this we ate on 3/17 at about 830 pm. Super awesome"}
{"text":"Is it a good burger ? Yes. I'd it worth the price for a regular eat? No. Should you try it ? Yes. 

In my mind this is the  east coasts's answer to in n out. However , I would be a repeat customer of in n out but not for shake shack. The value is simply not there. 

I wouldn't waste my money on the shakes again. Just a very average shake. The fries are also nothing to write home to mom about. However, the burgers are good and unique. Juicy and flavorful, just doesn't warrant the price in my opinion. But try them once."}
{"text":"The line promised a good lunch. If all these people waiting must be good, right?  Had the chicken sandwich. Chicken was moist but breeding was greasy  for a $5 sandwich was small as well 

Fries are crinkle cut. Well seasoned but needed a few more minutes in the fryer to be crunchy.

Iced tea refill was free but had to ask for it.

Overall might go back for a burger but there are better options"}
{"text":"I LOVE that the beef patties, potato buns, and frozen custards are made w/o any use of hormones and antibiotics (no high fructose corn syrup either). For a \"fast food\" establishment, the quality is great. 

People keep making the comparison between this place and In N Out but the two are completely different thus not right to compare. If I were to judge solely on taste, In N Out burgers win. For variety, Shake Shack wins. 

The organic potato buns would have been better if they were toasted. For the price, I guess quantity shouldn't matter (I need 2-3 of these burgers to be satisfied). The burgers were under-seasoned. I can say that these burgers are not greasy. The fries were fried perfectly and seasoned perfectly. 

The thing that won me is their Shack Attack. I got a single for my son. I tried it and needed to get my own (and one for my daughter in the C-line) right after our lunch. The C-line is for beverages and cold delicacies. What a brilliant idea! 

I'd go here just for the chocolate frozen custard; it is incredibly sweet, rich, thick, and chocolatey. Do not order this if you do not like your desserts sweet.

+ lines move fast though

+ non-GMO offerings
+ water dispenser and cups by the condiment bar

{"text":"Uhh??? So, I just spent over $40 for a couple of sliders and cold fries. Honestly don't see the hype here. I'm from Texas and west and east coast burgers are always different, but for my fellow Texans I would say go win In and Out. Or Fatburger! But this place will leave both your wallet and stomach feeling empty. Pass on this one."}
{"text":"Shake shack is soooo yummy! This location was extremely busy but they didn't let that interfere with the cleanliness or the great customer service. I'm not a fan of their BBQ sauce but everything else was really good. I had a burger and fries and my sister had a chicken sandwich and fries. We will definitely go again in the near future."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try Shake Shack for awhile, but never want to drive to LA for it. Since we were in Vegas this week, it was on the list of things we must do. Unfortunately we had a late breakfast and were not super hungry for lunch, so we decided to just split a burger since we were determined to try one.

When we arrived around 3:30 on Friday there was nobody in line and the food was ready in less than five minutes. Within 15 minutes of us arriving the line was literally out the door, but it seems like service is very fast here, so I am sure a long line isn't an issue.

We split a single Shackburger with no tomato (my husband despises tomatoes), an order of fries, and a salted vanilla caramel shake. It was good. My husband liked it way more than I did. I liked the flavor, the sauce was tasty, and it was very cheesy. But, I like texture, and this had none. Perhaps the tomato would have added a little bit. Also, the burgers are TINY. We cut it in half and each had about three bites to eat. I did like the fries, and the shake was pretty good.

Hubby says he would drive to LA for another one. If he decides to do that I will tag along, probably get a SmokeShack since it has bacon and hopefully more texture!"}
{"text":"They definitely live up to their hype in my opinion! I got a regular shack cheese burger with a lemonade. I didn't order my own fries but I got some from my friend. Fries were just ordinary. If you like the crinkle cut then whooptie do for you. I don't really care what type of cut the fries are, I just love fries in general. Their lemonade was pretty good also. Their burger was the best for the night, the bread was super soft, ingredients were fresh, and their sauce was yummy! It can get pretty busy through out all day!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent - friendly and patient. But the burger was too greasy and pretty flat, didn't seem like much for the price. The prices here are double that of In-N-Out, but the burger size is relatively the same. I know I really shouldn't compare the two, but just thinking about that made me regret coming here. Also, they definitely put less vegetables on their burger so just ask for extra onions or tomatoes when ordering. I wish I had done that. But their signature sauce on their burger is a definite winner, it's very sweet, creamy, and cheesy."}
{"text":"We eat here about once a month. I would have given them 5 stars but they discontinued the special menu they had before. Even with the loss of the specials menu, its still priced well and i don't think I've ever had a problem there. The ice cream, shakes and such, are worth the trip! 
So i hope they add that specials menu back in!"}
{"text":"Our favorite! We come here every time we're in Vegas! So much better than any burger I've ever had. Get the cheese fries omg"}
{"text":"What can I say! When I heard that the Shake Shack was coming out west, I was extremely excited. This is one of my must haves for trips into Manhattan, and I was really looking forward to a great burger and fries.

As for food, I ordered a burger, fries and a shake for around $14.  The food quality was amazing and fresh, and greatly outpaced other fancy burgers we encountered during the week for a much better price. The outdoor seating area was excellent and abundant (something definitely not the case in NYC) and the only thing missing was the bowling lane tables.  Bravo! I am looking forward to Shake Shack coming to LA in 2016!"}
{"text":"With so many burgers available in Las Vegas from celebrity chefs, i still think i prefer Shake Shack's. I was a first timer who ordered one of everything.

First bite of the Shake Stack made the taxi ride from the other side of the strip and the line to the cashier worth it. It's the cheeseburger with a fried mushroom stuffed with muenster and cheddar cheese and shack sauce. It's rich and so good in between the soft potato buns. There's never too much cheese so we indulged in Cheese Fries and i was blown away! Crispy edges and soft and gooey under the almost velveeta like cheese sauce. Do i dare say i like this better than In N Out's animal fries? The simplicity did it for me. I'm not sure where i found room for it but i dug deep and killed a Shack Cago Dog. If you like pickled veg this is for you. Yum though the burgers were the winners. For the holiday season they were offering fun frozen custard options like gingerbread and peppermint chocolate. I went for the classic and had a vanilla frozen custard shake. Thick custard, great flavor but In N Out wins the shake comparison for me. Overall, I'm a fan and can't wait to come back!! Crossing my fingers they open another West Coast location in San Francisco."}
{"text":"Soooo good! Juicy delicious burgers with great simple toppings for a good price. The wait is a little crazy but the service is good."}
{"text":"The burgers are good and I enjoyed the camelshack concrete.  Portions are a bit small for the price but the decor is upscale for a burger joint.  But there always seems to be a line!  And with 5 beers on tap along with custard shakes there's a lot to try."}
{"text":"After waffles, we walked over to this spot for shakes.  I had the salted caramel shake and he had the strawberry shake.  I liked mine better."}
{"text":"Man I Wish we had Shake Shack in the Bay Area!! Their Chicken Sandwich is juicy and the cucumber pickles aren't the tiny ones you see everywhere. They use actual cucumbers which taste so much better!"}
{"text":"First timer at Shake Shack last wk when I was in Vegas, it ended up being basically mandatory that I made a trip there every day. Whatever burger you crave for, YOU SERIOUSLY CANNOT MISS!

First, I tried the Shroom burger because I wanted to try something different that most fast food restaurants don't have. It's safe to say I fell in love in love at first bite.
Then I had the Chicken shack burger that had a sauceless slight spicy kick to the chicken which was just amazing. I loveeee spicy food & would normally go for any item that sounds spiciest on the menu. HOWEVER..

...I finally tried their Shack burger! Their classic burger was the best one yet, which surprised me. Wayyyy better than In-N-Out or any other fast food restaurants. Their beef was just so juicy & contained a lot of flavor; I almost felt like I was eating a gourmet meal! For the rest of the trip, I stuck w the Shack burger. Even got one before I left to the airport & another to-go for when I got back home to Seattle. That's how you know it's real lol I'm drooling just thinking about it"}
{"text":"So we had to drive to Arizona to try this cult favorite (not literally, but we definitely knew we had to try it while in Scottsdale).  We love to compare burgers and in So Cal our favorites are Burger Lounge, In N Out, and Smashburger.  We all agreed, Shake Shack is now tied for number 1.  And we went two days in a row just to see if we liked it as much the second day (we did).  The burgers are near perfect (maybe a tiny bit more sauce?) and my hubby loved the crinkle cut fries.  I'm not a shake person, but the rest of the family said they were really good.  We're all waiting for Shake Shack to hit San Diego!"}
{"text":"Not worth it.  Some east coast friends raved about Shake Shack back there, and I figured I'd try the one in Vegas since it was a short walk from the hotel and right on The Strip. 

Good location.  Clean inside.  But overpriced and a tourist trap.  Two of us had a burger, fries and one very small (there's only one size and it's shockingly tiny) vanilla shake.  It came to over 33 dollars for that.  The \"shake sauce\" on the burger is not great, and pretty darn bland.  The fries are crinkle cut and I swear they look and taste like a poor man's version of frozen Ore Ida brand fries.  Not flavorful.  Not good.  I'd say to skip this place entirely... except for one thing:

They have booth seating (which is cool), but the funny part is the booths are up a small step from the floor.  There's even a little sign telling people to watch their step.  Being Las Vegas, it seems like everyone is a tourist and either drunk or oblivious to signs, and we kept seeing person after person trip on the step while we sat there.  It was hilarious.  I hate to laugh when people fall, but it was almost comically hysterical.  Skip seeing Celine Dion at Caesars or Britney at Planet Hollywood... and come watch this:  it's the best show in Vegas!  Super funny pratfalls by dumb people who keep tripping on those dang steps."}
{"text":"Loved it. We are locals that driver across town to try out Shake Shack. Here's what we had:

Mushroom \"Burger\"...technically vegetarian but anyone would love this. Deep fried mushroom, cheeses, sauce. 
ShakeMeister Burger: Great. The spice from from the red peppers is perfect. 
We also had fries, cheese fries, hot dog, concrete, wine, beer, and lemonade. All good. 

Line was long but service was really quick. Don't let the line scare you away. 

I'd go again. Probably a fun place to take out of town visitors."}
{"text":"Shake Shack
3790 Las Vegas Blvd S
New York New York Hotel & Casino
Las Vegas, NV 89109
The Strip

On one particular day while on vacation in Las Vegas, my mother decided that she did not want to eat at a buffet for lunch. She elected to eat at the Shake Shack. I never heard of the Shake Shack but could only imagine that it was somewhere I did not want to eat since I try to stay away from fast foods. I submitted to her request because I planned most of the other events during our vacation.

Upon entering the establishment, I could smell the grease in the air. I instinctively knew this was a bad idea. We walked up to the menu that was in the middle of the fast food lobby and viewed the fast food options. The foods were what one would expect from somewhere called the \"Shake Shack.\" They had hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken sandwiches, a mushroom burger, fries, soda pops, water, and milkshakes. 

I'm a Pescatarian and do not usually eat meat, except on occasion. I do not like portabello mushrooms, so the vegetarian route was out of my options. I decided to get the Chick'n Shack (crispy chicken breast with lettuce, pickles, buttermilk herb mayo) and a Vanilla Salted Caramel Milkshake. My mother got the ShackBurger (cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce), Crinkle-Cut Fries, and a Vanilla Salted Caramel Milkshake.

We paid for our meals and handed a receipt, similar to Wendy's or Burger King. We waited until they called our number and retrieved our meals. I was not impressed by the presentation of the food. Not only did the chicken sandwich look greasy, but it also tasted as it floated around in grease for a while, and indeed was not crispy. The Vanilla Salted Caramel Milkshake tasted like a regular vanilla milkshake only half the size of a McDonald's milkshake. My mother did not like the milkshake and said that it had a funny taste. I told her that it was probably the salted caramel. She said that she must have missed that on the menu. She did not care for her cheeseburger or the fries.

Although it was not expensive for the Strip, it was a wasted meal in my mind, where we could have eaten once at a buffet and not eaten again that day. After reading other people's reviews of the Shake Shack, I can only surmise that those people are used to eating fast food and think that the Shake Shack is a step above McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King.

I would not recommend eating at the Shake Shack while in Las Vegas unless you are on a tight budget and are forced to eat fast foods. Instead of eating at the Shake Shack, spend your money more economically. Eat at a buffet once a day, the selections are more abundant, not soaked in grease, and provide healthier choices."}
{"text":"The line here was huge and it's all hype.

I was very disappointed with my greasy cheeseburger and overly sweet strawberry shake.

The only good thing were the fries :/"}
{"text":"Relatively fast service and good burger combination, love the shack shoom stack. The shake is too sweet though! Good location, easy to find and quick to pick up!"}
{"text":"Good serving especially the double down fries but popsicles stick that suppoosed to help you eat the fries is useless other than that it tastes good. The burger, i had smokeshack burger(double) of course  tastes good nothing special. A little bit pricey for me. Overall shake shack vs. in and out, hands down to in and out!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Shake Shack, especially living in California.. I don't have many opportunities to get it, so when in Vegas, we get Shake Shack. Also it is a whole lot closer than travelling to NY for it!

We went to one in LA and it wasn't as tasty.. this one is definitely more comparable than the LA one.

Service was fast and everything came out made to order."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good burger, check this place out! One of the options is a cheeseburger with a deep fried, cheese stuffed mushroom in the middle ,and yes, you can have fries with that shake! Mmmmmm! Is it healthy? Absolutely not. Did it matter? No! 

They had a decent amount of seating available and the food came out really quickly. Always a plus. 

The presentation and decor of everything was all clean and tidy and didn't make you feel like you were eating fast food. 

Although my milkshake didn't bring any boys to the yard tonight, I would still recommend trying this place for your burger and shake needs!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try the famous Shake Shack.  The place is a zoo.  Probably because of the location.  But as everybody stated, the line moves pretty fast.  We tried the regular burger and the Shack Stack and a hot dog, which were all great!  I loved the burger!  Since everybody is comparing it to In N Out, it's WAY better than In N Out, which isn't too hard to do.  The only thing is the portions are small and it's pretty expensive.  I probably could have eaten 2 or 3 burgers!"}
{"text":"After hearing all the hoopla about the Shake Shack, we decided to give it a try since we saw it as we were walking by NY,NY in Las Vegas. Simple and to the point, the burger was simple and very tasty, but the beef patties are paper thin. Thicken up those patties, and I would give them 4 stars.
Fries wear nice and crispy without being greasy or having a greasy taste to them, so that was a big plus on the overall meal. If you really want a load of fries,go for the Double Down Fries. It's a big bowl of fries loaded down with Shack cheese sauce, diced spicy cherry peepers, and diced smoked bacon, and is a good share for 2-3 people.
Again, burger size killed it or me, so I'll stick with an In-n-Out Burger for now."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place currently ! The food and staff are great . Always delicious and staff is super friendly and efficient. 

A must go to place !"}
{"text":"This place is really good.. I know it's on the strip you think you'll be waiting forever a seat, NO!!! This place is well run. They give a menu while your waiting in line. The line moved very quickly. If your going the eat here order the shack stack, mmmmm very good. But what ever burgers you order you must I repeat it's must to get the cheese fries.  Sorry no pics I so hungry."}
{"text":"The chickn shack was delicious! As was the smokeshack. And the fries.
I was honestly impressed by the quality of the food.
The only disappointment I faced, was the size and price. 
I understand there is a price to quality, but I'm not trying to dish out $10+ so I can be unsatisfied at the end of my meal... 

So overall, I enjoyed the food but wouldn't come when I'm starving or on a budget."}
{"text":"Another Place I thought would take me a long time to get to but thankfully they opened one up in Las Vegas. Ate here three times on a week long trip to Vegas was amazing everytime. The Burgers are about the best I have had better then 5 guys or In and Out. The Shakes are a yes also they change up the special flavors each week so I caught two of them Caramelized Peach which was good but not my flavor and Blueberry lemon curd which was off the chart good. I like that their sizes of both food and shakes are not huge you don't feel like you ate a Football after you leave there. I also tried one of their hot dogs and that was a hit also their take of a Chicago Dog.  I was bummed I did not get to try the Concretes which are like a Mcflurry but with crazy unique ingredients like peanut butter banana cheesecake. Next Time I will try them.   If your in Vegas its a Must try."}
{"text":"Been hearing about this place and finally tried it out.  I had the cheeseburger with bacon and red cherry peppers or something. It gave it a great flavor.  Fries and a peanut butter and chocolate shake.  Would def try them back home too."}
{"text":"How can a burger just melt in your mouth? That is exact what happens upon contact with your mouth and a burger from Shake Shack. The burger buns are like no other. They are made from a potato dough and are absolutely delicious. The party of flavors with every bite is so satisfying. They have the classic burger and cheese burger options but then kick it up a notch by having the option of a burger with peppers and bacon. As we all know anything with bacon is amazing so make sure you try this burger choice, it's mouth watering good.

These burgers are sooooooooo yummy you'll want them for breakfast, lunch and dinner! 
You know those mornings when you wake up with one sock on, and can't feel one side of your face? Well a burger from shake shack will bring you back to life with just a bite. Stop reading this already and go in and place your order! 



P.s. Long lines as soon as they open and stay around until they close... Plan to wait in some kind of line- remember it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Mooki is the new cashier at Shake Shake, and she couldn't be any friendlier, more efficient...she is so fast all while being funny and sweet. She's made my last two trips here memorable. Congrats on delicious food and a great new employee, Shake Shack! :)"}
{"text":"Service is great, staff is friendly. I really enjoyed the chicken sandwich, pretty basic but really yummy. The crinkle fries were perfect for me today. Crunchy outside and soft inside, just how I like my fries. This is a yummy fast food place."}
{"text":"Just as good as NYC. My wife and I go to any shake shack that is near our hotel. We came out to Vegas for the grand opening because it is finally on the west coast. The hospitality is great and the food even better."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Shake Shack for ever and it's now open! We stopped in on a Monday evening, and the line was out the door. It was a nice night so it wasn't too bad. We ordered a shack burger, shack stack, cheese fries, BBQ bacon cheese fries, and two drinks. You are given a pager and sent off. There are not enough tables so if you see one, grab it. We lucked out and got a table right away, but it was near the food window where people were waiting for take out. No one wants to eat with a crowd watching, so it's a shame the tables aren't arranged in a better way.

Now, the food. We really liked everything. My cheeseburger was delicious, and husbands shake stack (with cheese stuffed mushroom on top of cheeseburger) was awesome. Fries were crisp and topped appropriately. The issue with the food is the size! The burgers are not large. For $9 for the stack, we expected something larger. If everything was 20% less, it would be decent pricing.

All in all, it was good, but the atmosphere left a little to be desired. We had to wipe off the table ourselves (staff threw a package of wipes at us to clean it off). Also, pricing is high for what you get - $3.25 for lemonade?! We might come back, but with tons of other options in the area, it might be a long time til we return."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to this urban burger shop. Good food and friendly atmosphere. Burgers and beer and wine some kind of combination. Burgers wrapped paper...and juicy hot and flavorful. Nice job shake shack."}
{"text":"I tried shake shack in NY and in Chicago and were disappointed both times. I wanted to give it another shot because of the hype but unfortunately the third time still wasn't a charm. 

The burger was small and lacked flavor. The fries were ok. I tried the salted caramel shake and that was the only thing I liked. I paid $16 for everything and I feel like I can get a better deal somewhere else (yes in n out)"}
{"text":"Best cheeseburger ever had in my life my favorite but I have to say this is the best I love the shake shack I love everything there to cheeseburgers the fries the cheese fries milkshakes everything is amazing I would definitely recommend going here all the cheeseburgers are good anyone is good very good place"}
{"text":"Another NYC staple right around my neighborhood!!  Stoked to actually have the first West Coast franchise in Las Vegas instead of elsewhere.  Conveniently situated on Las Vegas Blvd for those who happen to be galavanting around the Strip and in need of some place for a quick meal.  This, however, isn't the case for locals as trying to get here can be such a pain.  Parking alone is a 10-15 minute walk from either New York-New York or Monte Carlo, only to find yourself lining up amongst a large crowd once arriving at the establishment.  At least the queue went by relatively fast so the wait didn't take too long despite of the line being quite lengthy.

Unlike other locations I've gone to, this spot has a C-Line which lets customers buying anything off the menu but food items bypass the regular line.  This serves as an excellent pit stop for frozen custards or even alcoholic beverages while strolling around the area.

Food was just as great as the meal I had in NYC or MIA: seasoned burger patty topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce between pillowy potato bun.  People usually compare the burger from this place to other joints such as In-N-Out and Five Guys, but I have to say, I prefer the ones from here than the latter.  They also serve several beers on tap.  Perhaps my favorite is the ShackMeister which is made just for the company by Brooklyn Brewery.   

Overall, Shake Shack is definitely one of the top fast food burger spots in town.  Excellent burgers, superb customer service and awesome ambiance.  I can already see myself being here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Had this in New York a few ago and I couldn't wait to hit this spot once I found out they had one in Vegas. Amazing!!! And this location looks really cool all the employees were very nice and looked as though they actually liked their jobs. Gotta make the stop when there's a Shake Shack"}
{"text":"Dubbed as the \"In & Out of the East Coast\", I have had Shake Shack when I visited New York. This time, I had my nephews with me in Vegas for them to have a taste of the East Coast. It's much larger and spacious compared to the locations I've been in New York. It gets busy, but the line gets by fast and the wait time for the food was about 10 minutes. We ordered the Shakeshack burger, Smokeshack burger, Hot dog, Crinkle Fries, and their milkshakes.

Food:
Shack burger is like a classic cheeseburger with buns, patty, lettuce, tomato, and cheese with their shack sauce spread. The goodness and quality of the burger gave it a thumbs up. If you're indecisive on which to try out, you can't go wrong with originality for the Shack burger.

Smokeshack burger was what my nephew had. He liked it, but would rather try out Shackburger for a more colorful topping in his burger with the lettuce and tomatoes. Perfect for bacon lovers!

Hot dog was basic. Hot and grilled with the hot dog split open at the center, I can't say much since my nephew likes his hot dog plain, naked, and boring.

Fries: Crispy, toasted fries which were good but may be basic for some. Some like theirs with cheese added, I preferred mine plain.

Milkshakes: I had the Black and White as recommended by the staff as their popular pick and I liked it. It wasn't too thick that I can't slurp like the ones I had from In and Out. My nephew had vanilla for his and enjoyed it as well.

Verdict: Pretty good for a fast food, comparable to In & Out with their food made with quality. As a California girl, In & Out is just as good as Shake Shack that I can't compare the two. Both have their goodness in different ways. In & Out caters more of a classic menu with their not so secret menus. Shake Shack offers a little more variety to their burgers and shakes, also selling alcohol at this location. In & Out's prices are more affordable than Shake Shack. In & Out's burger sells an average of $3, while the Shack Burger goes for $5, and the Smokeshack was close to $7. ShakeShack's shakes costs a little more than the Shack burger itself. Would I have it again? I would, if I happen to be in town since there's no Shake Shack in the Bay Area."}
{"text":"I can understand the hype but its really nothing special to me. We got here pretty early so we didnt have to wait at all

Got the portabello mushroom burger which was good but its not something I would crave later in life. A little too cheesy for my taste and I love cheese but I guess i dont love it that much!. 

Fries are ok. Cheese fries have nacho cheese which I would just prefer with chips and not on fries. Again, my own preference. 

What really got under my skin....was the staff. 
Ok so my friend orders a shake stack, fries and a lemonade. All of our orders were coming out and hers was taking a bit. She goes up to the counter and it looks like someone else just took her order. The staff goes to the table where her order was and takes the food from that party and comes back and says \"Here you go\" to my friend. ummmmmmm.....ok i understand that the food wasnt eaten yet but it was sitting at another table.
Restaurant etiquette 101: YOU DO NOT GIVE SOMEONES ORDER TO SOMEONE ELSE AND THEN RETURN IT TO THEM AND EXPECT THEM TO BE OK WITH IT! 
YOU MAKE THEM A NEW ORDER. 

My Friend complains and the manager comes and asks whats wrong with the order. My friend tells her the situation and the manager replies with..\"Oh you can take that one\". Yea, NO. 

They finally got the point and made her a new order, which they brought over to our table so was still questionable if it was a new one or if they just walked to the back and pretended to bring out a fresh order. 

Sorry shake shack.....Training of staff and management goes a long way. Just FYI."}
{"text":"We went to the shake shack while staying at the New York New York hotel and casino. The burgers were incredibly juicy. Orders came out correctly even with making special requests. There should be a shake shack in every town!"}
{"text":"I plain like the burgers. Also the custard?? Do yourself a favor and get it. Shake Shack is the real deal."}
{"text":"The burgers are tasty, but definitely a bit overpriced. The burgers strike me as being a cross between In-N-Out (freshness) and Smashburger (burger styles). Their most basic burger is the Single ShackBurger, which is about $5 and surprisingly filling and delicious. They have some basic crinkle fries that you can either get plain or throw some melted cheese on. It takes about 10 minutes or so for them to get your food ready, and they give you a little buzzer so you can know when you can pick up your food.

I'd recommend this place if you're confined to this the area and in the mood for a tasty burger. You can probably get a larger burger for a lower price elsewhere, but these burgers will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Alright let me say this: it's really hard to beat Shake Shack. It's been my go-to choice of burger since it opened up in the Buckhead Shops when I lived in Georgia. The reason I love Shake Shack so much is because it sticks to the original burger recipe: cheese, patty, lettuce and tomato. Sometimes when you visit restaurants that want to jazz up your everyday burger, you forget what a burger is truly supposed to taste like and this is definitely it. My go-to order would be a single patty burger with extra cheese and no tomato- can't go wrong! 

Last year in Atlanta, I tried the seasonal Peppermint Milkshake and haven't been able to forget about the melt in your mouth flavor! A good everyday shake from this location would definitely be the Cookies & Cream (or maybe it's called Oreo). Last week was my first time ever trying their hot dogs. Not even going to lie, I initially had trust issues about whether or not I was going to like it as much as their burger... So, like a psychopath I ordered both the burger and the dog. Long story short, TRY THE DOG. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT AT ALL. 

A make or break about any hot dog situation for me is also if the restaurant has quality relish: and they absolutely do. I was taking this order home, so the guy behind the counter carefully lidded two containers full of relish for me to also take along. Oh, and the double order situation? Didn't regret that either. Haters gonna hate but let's face it: double fisting two entrees at Shake Shack is an amazing experience, and you probably secretly want to try it too. Renee Out."}
{"text":"Got the shack burger with added bacon. The burger was juicy and simply delicious. Wasn't a fan of the cheese sauce for the cheese fries though. Either way, I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Mmm, so glad I don't have to wait to travel to New York to get Shake Shack anymore. Everyone always wants to compare Shake Shack to In-N-Out. Well they're completely different. I always get the Shackburger. If you like the meaty/cheesy flavor, you'll likely enjoy Shake Shack more. All personal preference. 

The Chick'n Shack sandwiches are tasty if you want to try something different (might even be better than Chik-fil-a). The concretes are delicious if you're looking for something cold and refreshing on a hot Las Vegas day. The Shackmeister Ale is a nice pairing to drink with your burger while people watching on the patio. 

We came after 1pm on a Saturday and didn't have to wait long, let alone in a line out the door. Altogether a good experience. TIP: If you're only ordering cold items, ditch the regular line and hop into the C-Line!"}
{"text":"This is the best burger I have ever had! I don't like burger so much, but \"shake stack\" is really tasty! I love that mushroom :)) I just had it yesterday, and today I came back again"}
{"text":"Such a great place! The food is delicious, be sure to get the cheese fries! The manager, Matt, was extremely helpful and took great care of us. Cecile at the cashier was also kind and gave a bunch of great tips and tricks for our food! Thanks for a great lunch and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Giving this place a 5 cuz if you've been to Shake Shack, you'll know they deserve a 10.

Dunno what they do to their burgers, but they're damn ass delicious. Doesn't help that it burns a hole in my pocket, but so worth it afterwards. Wish the burgers were bigger, or that it were cheaper, but hey... you get what you pay for.

Splurge and get a double cheese, fries, and a shake (all items I listed are bought separately - yum, gets expensive). 

I've had the coffee shake (OMFG YUM), and the peppermint chocolate shake (ARE YOU F* KIDDING ME?!?!?) - both OUT OF THIS WORLD. Just go.

Try going when it isn't packed. Usually the most congested of all fast foods. We went on a Thursday evening around 9pm."}
{"text":"After cleaning up at the tables and pulling in $20K as part of an all-night bender, I was mad hungry. With stacks in hand, I wanted to eat a stack at the booty shack.

I've heard good things about this place from my cousins who have been to the one in NY.

So for weeks I've been highly anticipating this meal when I touched down in Vegas.
Day 2 of our trip, we trekked down the strip from our hotel to get there for the opening at 11a.
Smart choice as soon after we found a table, the place filled up within 20 minutes. 

As a true burger connoisseur, I always go for the 2 patties or more. 
Smokestack was my choice of burger. Cheese, meat, bacon: How can you go wrong?
I was happy with my decision as the burger was juicy and full of flavor. 
The only problem was with my big mouth (literally & figuratively) I devoured the burger in about 5 bites. 

I regret not ordering another one as I was not completely full. The crinkle cut fries tasted better than I expected given my position regarding crinkle cut.

The jackpot was a jackpot of a dessert. The waffle bites were an interesting element into the frozen concoction. The strawberry puree and cookie dough bites in the vanilla custard all worked in harmony. I didn't care for the sprinkles. For a double, I found the size of the dessert to be rather small (words that have never been said to me in the bedroom). 

Bottom Line: This is better than 5 Guys, The Habit, Smashburger, Fatburger, In & Out and almost any burger chain I've tried. If your in the area, check out this burger joint."}
{"text":"I walked by this place a few times and noticed they were always busy so wanted to stop before I left town.  I came in early super bowl Sunday and it was quite busy.  I had to wait in line about 5 minutes to order and then 20 minutes to get my food.   The food was amazing but the customer service was something else and that's why they got only 2 stars from me. 

I ordered a chocolate peanut butter shake and when it was delivered to me they had a sticker covering the straw hole that said contains nuts.  Why would you do that???  

I ordered an order of Cheese fries which were delicious 

I ordered a Bacon cheeseburger add bacon minus tomatoes.   It came with cheese, bacon and meat.  Where is the onion, the pickle, lettuce?    

On the menu it kept referring to a \"shake sauce\" on all the burgers and I asked the guy taking my order what it was and I was told I can't tell you.  I asked if it was mayo based and he again repeated I can't tell you.   

As I was rushed through my order and could tell I was treated just as another person will cause me not to return here as I attend different events on the strip monthly and I will now take my business elsewhere due to the customer service but I am sure 1 person won't make this place change that."}
{"text":"Although I'm a Cali girl and I'm supposed to be team In-N-Out, I do love me some shake shack. I've only had it twice in my life, during a trip to NY, but I loved it. So with this trip to Vegas, I knew I had to stop by and grab a bite to eat. This location was surprisingly pretty big and spacious. 

Since I've been on a low carb diet, I wasn't able to enjoy the full shake shack experience. I know, poor me. Anyways, I ordered the smoke shack protein style (wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun). Well first off, they messed up on my order and gave me a regular burger with the bun. We told them about it and they fixed the order. I ended up getting a burger that was semi-wrapped in lettuce so everytime I took a bite, stuff fell out. It was annoying. 

Will I come back? Probably. But after I'm done with this diet."}
{"text":"Been waiting for this place to open, and finally got to try it. It did not disappoint...the never ending long line/wait is proof the people of Scottsdale are excited about it! Tried the Shack Stack, Smoke Shack, and the chicken sandwich & of course could not resist the cheese fries & a peanut butter chocolate shake. Great quality food, and really great customer service. They officially gained a new regular customer."}
{"text":"Well. This is my second time here and the food is excellent. I ordered a bacon burger well-done and believe it or not it was still juicy and cooked perfect. The fries are good as well as the service. I highly recommend it to anybody that likes Burger's"}
{"text":"this place is very much overrated if you ask me. It looks like a really cool place from the outside and in but  you can't even get a seat because its to busy. The most important thing everyone knows is the food. The food is just okay nothing out of this world and nothing I would come back for. Plus it wasn't even hot it was cold. If the food was really good I wouldn't mind the LOOONG lines and no seat, but its simply just not worth it. Wont be back. Disappointed I love myself a good burger every now and again."}
{"text":"Please don't waste your money here, go to Five Guys instead- and it's in the same shopping center. It's really hard to get my husband to try new food, so when I suggested this place he was all for it because how can you screw up a burger and fries? Well you obviously can. The cashier that took our order was Shawtrice she was unhelpful, and seemed annoyed that she was even there. I ordered their featured  burger that was \"roadside burger\" and fries and my husband ordered the regular \"shack burger\" with an add on of bacon and fries with a soda. Mind you the soda comes in 2 sizes small and large and the small is a 12oz cup but you get free refills. But getting up and down to ask for a refill is a little annoying and they give you a new cup each time. Which for sanitary reasons I can appreciate but I feel like just give us the big cups and you wouldn't go through so much paper. Anyway, the food. The actual meat had no flavor. No salt, no seasoning, no anything. The only thing I could taste on my burger was the pickles. The fries were mediocre as hell. Just frozen crinkle fries they deep fried. They don't have ranch to eat with your fries which is fine but annoying to me because I love ranch to dip my fries in. The interior is very modern and stays clean because they have employees roaming around picking up trash and trays. We spend $24 for 2 burgers, 2 fries and 1 drink, and the food left us feeling empty and 30 min later we were hungry again. So if you want to try it go ahead but when a Big Mac from McDonalds has more taste why waste your money."}
{"text":"Amazing food--especially the strawberry shake! Definitely a wait due to newness, but overall they have their systems up and rolling well. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I was so eager to try Shake Shack as I had heard great things.  They lived up to my expectations.  I opted for a chicken sandwich rather than a burger, and it was delivered on a soft bun and packed with flavor.  The fries were tasty, and I washed it all down with one of their signature milkshakes.  The meal was worth the wait in line.  The calories were through the roof, but it was an excellent way to indulge in a cheat meal.

It's location on the strip provides great convenience for a casual meal.  It may not be speedy, as the lines can be quite long.  The prices are a bit higher than most burger joints, but the quality makes up for the price."}
{"text":"Thought it would be better. small portions. burger was ok. fries seem frozen. not the best fries."}
{"text":"See your cardiologist after eating a burger here. This is the  saltiest burger you could ever consume. The cheese that comes on the burger is artificial goop. The regular fries were ok. They were not greasy which is a good thing. The staff was friendly. The food is way overpriced. There are so many better places to get a burger. Save your $ and health."}
{"text":"Tasty burgers. Great custard shakes. Great location near the middle of the strip.  Just pricey for a meal but being all natural it could be worth it for some."}
{"text":"People often compare Shake Shack to In n Out so I guess I will say, they are both good in different ways.  Shake Shack obviously have variety of choices with both burgers and fries while In n Out just keeps it simple.  

Shake Shack cheese fries are to die for!! I love it.  The burger was good but I think In n Out burger is still better.  The price of Shake Shack is more expensive but it was small or maybe I was hungry?!

I will give Shake Shack a try again pretty soon!"}
{"text":"Good burger, but it still loses to in-n-out. Their burger is flavorful, but personally one thin piece of lettuce isn't enough. The burger was just lacking in the veggie department. Their buns are nice and soft, but this just further emphasized the lack of crunch of some refreshing veggies. And the PRICE is 3-4x more than in-n-out! Their crinkle cut fries are crispy and delicious, and their shakes are pretty good too. They have a different shake featured every week. 

We stopped by here twice and happened to get the same cashier both times (Kimberly). She could use a refresher in customer service skills. There were 2 other employees that were running around cleaning up tables and they were AMAZING. They were super polite and efficient and friendly! 

Overall, good food and cool experience trying East coast food here. But happy to stick with in-n-out!"}
{"text":"Burger was good and a decent size, but not as large as a burger you'd find in a sit down restaurant. The crinkle cut fries were yummy, crispy and not greasy. My fave was the vanilla frozen custard!  It was creamy and smooth. 

The place was super crowded as expected. The women's bathroom only had two stalls which was surprising for the number of people packed in this place."}
{"text":"The older lady that works here is so sweet and nice ! Our order was messed up and she fixed it right away! Great customer service! Thank you so much! (Sorry i couldn't catch her name!)"}
{"text":"This was my second time back at Shake Shack as I was contacted by them after my last review and was asked to please return with a free burger. I will tell you, I truly appreciate businesses that read our reviews and take action! If nothing else, it tells their customers that they truly care about our opinions and want to make sure we have a positive experience. 

While this is not my first choice of burger joints, my Shake Burger was pretty good. The produce seemed fresh and the bun was delightful. My one area of critique is that my burger was a little overdone, but not too bad.

I must rave about their service. From the moment I walked in, the manager greeted me with a smile and a friendly hello. The cashier was very bubbly and made sure I got extra pickles, which made me super happy. Lastly, the manager stopped by, picked up my tray and asked if I wanted more water. I declined the water, but the gesture was awesome and truly appreciated."}
{"text":"My favorite item on the menu: SHACK STACK!! I was not expecting that portobello mushroom to be fried. Oh so good!! The burgers at first appear small, but just one can feel you up. Other than the shack stack, we also tried the bacon cheddar shack, which was pretty good but not as bomb as the shack stack. The loaded fries were tasty, but not among my favorite. The beer float I can do without. The caramel shake was yummy but also super sweet. Maybe I'll try a different flavor next time. A little on the pricier side but expected here in LV."}
{"text":"I came here by myself because I'm a loser, I was sitting there waiting, quite bored actually when Jenny comes over and starts chatting me up. She was very nice, smiling and even offered to get my food for me when my buzzer went off, and went out of her way to get me ketchup, which I did not even ask for but I did appreciate!! She came back again a couple times later to check up on me. So yeah. Good service. Food was good, but I feel like I don't really need to tell you that.... you guys are like a multinational chain, aren't you? Yeah obviously the food's good, you don't really need my validation on this"}
{"text":"Shack burger and chocolate shake were good but i would be just as satisfied at another burger joint. The fries tho omg... THE best! Loved the crinkle cut texture. Super crispy and not greasy. I'd say the best fries I've ever had....nom nom nom"}
{"text":"I am a fan, but I don't think the wait was worth the food. I'm just saying... . In n Out still kills this spot. Their french fries are amazing tho. Burger was pretty basic, not as amazing as I thought they would be like the reviews said. Root Beer float was on point tho.. ."}
{"text":"Shack sauce: 10/10 would definitely recommend. 

The burgers are really good and come with lots of different options. I have had the regular shake shack burger the first time I went but this time I had the Smokeshack and it is my new favorite. It came with bacon, cherry peppers, and the infamous shack sauce. 

The crinkle cut fries and really well done and I would also recommend the peanut butter shake.

As an added bonus, they have gluten free buns for those with an allergy."}
{"text":"Long LONG wait for a burger, but then it is a good burger and worth the wait. The fries were pretty darn good too actually."}
{"text":"The burger was tasty, the fries and shake were good.  The long line moved pretty good, only 30 minutes from corner to counter. Decent amount of seating."}
{"text":"YUM!! We ate here at least once a day on our trip to Vegas on Memorial Day Wknd. The cheese fries were crispy and delicious and the burgers are so juicy!!!! This place had great prices, funny staff and lots of seating options outside which we enjoyed. Plenty to see around here too for people watching which kept us laughing for a good amount of time. We were a group of 8 and at one point thought we would split up and try some other places to eat along the strip. Ya - we all ended up running into each other back at the shack, that's how yummy it is! If ever back in Vegas this will definitely be a MUST!"}
{"text":"This place is busy, but the line moves pretty fast and there is lots of seating. The burger was a tad over cooked for medium, but still enjoyable."}
{"text":"Forget everything you heard about In-N-Out. Just forget In-N-Out altogether. Shake Shack is where its at! This is your new burger spot when you're in Vegas. I got the Smoke shack, bacon burger with cherry peppers. Simple burger but unique and exquisite in flavor. Better than a lot of restaurant style burgers I've tried. All that plus fast friendly service regardless of the packed house. I'll definitely be returning asap."}
{"text":"I failed. I came to Shake Shack and ordered the wrong thing because...well, I'm an idiot apparently. I wanted a burger with mushrooms, but ordered a mushroom sandwich. Fail. It wasn't my taste. So I took one bite n left it, finished my fries. A young worker noticed I wasn't eating it, asked me about it, I explained I blew it.. He got me a new burger. The correct burger. And refilled my fries and drink. Holy shit. That is service!!!!!!  This place rules. This was Thursday 1/21/16 right at opening. This kid does this company proud. I believe his name was Dee. Just awesome"}
{"text":"I'll all about the fast food joints so I've been wanting to try this for a while and it was priority on our last Vegas trip.

The line was pretty long but we got our order in about 15 minutes later.  Overall our burger was fairly mediocre as well as the fries. Would check it out if they had a California presence but not worth having to head out so far too."}
{"text":"I was told this place was the East Coasts answer to the In N Out burger on the West Coast...not feeling it, good and clean burger but lacked fresh lettuce, tomato, onion options and or fresh cut chili pepper options. Comparable fries but shake was weak, I would eat there again if getting to the Las Vegas In N Out was out of the question."}
{"text":"The shroom burger is delish! It is a panko battered portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese, it was hot and oozing when I bit into it, be careful! The flavors and textures are awesome, soft bun, too! My only problem with it was that I could probably eat two ! 

Cheese fries were yummy too.  I will be back to try the burgers and frozen custard!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger in NYC is here in Vegas. Brought my husband here and it was his first time. He liked it very much"}
{"text":"Shake Shack is always a good go to place in my book. The service is really good to employees to management. Everyone is nice and respectful and go beyond effort to make sure people are satisfied. We asked the nice lady about a baby nappy they had at another location and she asked the manager and he said he was just about to place an order for the baby nappy and would order the gray ones we spoke about."}
{"text":"For me, this place lives up to the hype. Probably the best burger for the money on The Strip.  I haven't eaten at the original to know how it compares but this won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we live in LA coz we went here 2 days in a row! Let me disclose that for some reason this is my fave burger. I've tried a few places like umami, stacked, Holsteins, in n out, 

Hubs and I got a shack burger, smoke shack, shackmeister, choc shake, shack attack custard, fries. We only meant to go once and then grimaldi's the next day, but there must be drugs in the burgers coz I can't get enough!

There's lots of space and it was easy to order as the line moved fast. I hate waiting though so I dunno if I'd bother waiting but we were here thurs night and fri lunch and had no problems."}
{"text":"I went here last night. I got a lettuce wrapped burger, my son got a plain cheese burger, also got a shake, and some cheesy fries. My son lives his burger, he ate it ALL. My lettuce wrapped burger was good. I like that they use romaine (IN n OUT uses iceberg), my burger was a tad greasy but it was still good. We got our cheese sauce for the fries on the side so that we could dip it. They were delicious, my son loved it. We didn't like the shake at all. It's a custard shake and we've come to the conclusion that maybe custard isn't for us. Now, for a burger place, this place seemed kind of pricy. It was $24 for what we got. I would come back here if I was in the area and was hungry but I wouldn't drive out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"East Coast competition is always trying to go for a show down in the West Coast. Who has a better burger? Well, in my opinion, it depends on the tier. This place would get tortured against Plan Check. But against, In N' Out, that would be a fair match.

It's been a number of years since I've been to Shake Shack. The last time was in 10 degree weather in Manhattan walking a mile back and forth to my sister's place. Yup, we had frozen custard too. I remember the burger being good but not memorable. 

This time in Vegas, I was able to try Shake Shack again. Located at the storefront of New York New York where the roller coasters once ran, the portion facing Las Vegas Blvd. has been renovated with stores new walkway. 

I ordered a SmokeShack which is a cheeseburger with applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and Shacksauce. I also ordered fries and a Shack Attack Concrete.

The burger itself is very good. It's tasty, meaty seasoned well. The bacon is good makes the burger a bit saltier. Cherry peppers give slight kick and enhanced flavor. Fries are nothing special to my liking. Definitely doesn't seem like it comes from fresh potatoes. The Shack Attack was my dessert for the day and pretty good. It's a chocolate custard, fudge sauce, chocolate truffle cookie dough (thought it was a brownie), dark chocolate chunks, and chocolate sprinkles. Honestly, I liked this better than the burger. The only thing is that I didn't notice fudge sauce unless it got lost in the concoction of ingredients. I also had Abita Brewing draught root beer. This was more sugary than anything else. I missed the strong flavor of sarsaparilla. 

The interior is pretty cool with lots some communal seating. Great for catching a game. The vibe is more homely and a variety of other items including hot dogs, shroom burger, cold brew, beer, and wine. 

So who wins? In N Out of course. Nothing beats the freshness of In N Out's ingredients of bread made that day, meat never frozen, and freshly cut lettuce and onions (hold the tomato). There is a difference and I can tell. In terms of value, it's about twice the cost. 

Shake Shack is a solid burger but I've had burgers similar. I've had Wagyu Chuck at 4th Street Market in Santa Ana and there is a resemblance. Definitely a cool spot to visit. Try the Concretes (frozen custards) for sure. I'm still a fan. Come to LA. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Best burgers and custard! Worth every calorie! Great people watching on the deck at the NYNY location, free strip entertainment ;)"}
{"text":"Good burgers (bun similar to Hawaiian bread) and fries are really good.  I'm not really a shake person--but my kids and hubby who are--loved the chocolate shake.  I'm a Fuddrucker and Habit fan (and who doesn't love In and Out) but this is comparable. I'd say worth trying if you are around (we stayed in NY NY) and it was an inexpensive dinner. If you need accessibility, go around the building for the ramp."}
{"text":"I've been hearing so many good things about this place that I told myself on my last Vegas trip that I would come eat here and experience all the hype everyone is saying. I get dinner here on my first night and it wasn't packed which was good so I got to place my order quick. I do like how this place has lots of options to choose from compared to In-N-Out but that's all the credit they get. Quantity does not equal quality.

After going through their menu I decide to try their Smoke Shack burger since it \"supposedly\" comes with bacon. I did not get any bacon in my burger so either I got scammed or it's a separate charge. Whatever. I also wanted to get their loaded fries with cheese and bacon but 9 bucks for it? Screw that. I went with the cheese fries for $4 instead and a water bottle for $2.40 which my total came out to $14.31

I didn't have to wait too long for my food so that was a plus. However the burger wasn't mind blowing good like everyone is raving about. I was quite disappointed in the size of the burger for the amount I paid for which was nearly $7. The cheese fries were alright. I wanted to try their shakes but since I was paying a buttload for this place I opted not to.

Workers here were nice but overall my meal experience here was less than to be desired. I'm glad I got to try this place finally and I can say there is no need for me to go try the one in West Hollywood."}
{"text":"First meal off the plane visiting friends in Scottsdale.   Love the setup and layout of this SS.  Ping pong and outdoor seating.  Plenty of room and nice flowing line.   Solid burger as always and our family loves the fries.  My older son got the crispy chicken sandwich and that was tasty, I would get it again.   Probably will have to visit Vegas, AZ or NY for my SS fix, I don't want to deal with the new Palo Alto one."}
{"text":"I just moved here from DC and was so happy to see a Shake Shack in Vegas. It's like I had a little piece of the east coast here with me. 

The burgers are absolutely amazing ! The fries are okay, nothing special but the burgers are soooo amazing. I don't even like burgers and I love their burgers. 

The location is packed constantly and takes a long time to order so that sucks. As a Vegas resident and not a visitor spending all my time on the strip it can be hard to get to. Having to park and go through the hotel is a bit much but the food is worth it. I would suggest definitely eating in to Beth the experience and savor the flavor."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times and it never disappoints! I normally get the shack stack, which is a cheeseburger with a cheese stuffed fried mushroom. I've also tried the ShackBurger and the Chick'n Shack, which are really good too. Their buns are really soft and aren't cut all the way through, so that your burger doesn't fall out through the bottom.

Must try the fries. Classic crinkle cut fries, perfectly done. I love their black and white shake, but they have different rotating flavors all the time. 

You can park at New York New York or at the Park (same parking structure) and walk towards the Strip right across from Monte Carlo."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time a couple of months ago. Had a shack stack and a purple cow float. The float wasn't as good as I was hoping. I was just too hungry after not having breakfast or lunch, and it was 5PM, I just had to eat something before our next stop in Vegas."}
{"text":"A little pricey but it's quality food and very tasty We all had burgers or cheeseburgers and fries  Burgers are not huge but very tasty! We also tried the shakes Chocolate very rich pee my niece but the strawberry was creamy and yummy!"}
{"text":"Took my Granddaughter here for lunch after a day at the spa. She loved it. The ice cream was excellent and so were our burgers. I do think it is a overpriced but living in Summerlin, most things are. In the end, good food but too expensive."}
{"text":"Really good burgers and fries! I normally hate crinkle cut fries but these fries were amazing! They are really crispy and flavorful. Their burgers are also really good even better than in n out. I got the bacon burger and it didn't come with Lettuce and tomatoes but they were really nice and gave it to us on the side. Be sure to request them if the burger doesn't come with them."}
{"text":"I tried to eat this burger on New York and was impressed with that burger very much. Thus we took my family here and ate the burger. They said this was one of the best burgers in all burger shops because of good meat with soft and sweet breads."}
{"text":"Its just okay. Burger seems about the same as culvers and so is the fries. They even have concrete which is a culvers thing too. Their burgers here are really greasy. The shakes are really good tho. No free refills on soda products which sucks. It's also really expensive. Lunch for 3 ran me 45$. I'll  stick with culvers if I want something similar. *note not a culvers fan just found it rereally similar."}
{"text":"Awesome! 3x awesome, can't wait til they open one up in Los Angeles.

Cheese fries
Smokeshack burger
Frozen custard
Shackmeister Dog

Custards no big deal unless you get one of the specialty seasonal flavors. Be prepared to wait in line and wait again for a  table. 

I personally think it's worth it though!"}
{"text":"Was so stoked this place opened up in Las Vegas! Finally got to try this place to see if it lived up to the hype. Heard the wait in NY can be two hours or more. But don't worry! The wait was no more than 10 min to order and another 15 min to get your food. Enjoy a beer while you wait!

My friend and I ordered the original Shake Shack burgers. Always gotta judge the place based on the og burger! I must say the meat was pretty thick & juicy, but the burger was quite small overall. The buns were a bit dense as well. I ended up picking 1/3 of it out. Also, I don't know how they messed it up but one of our burgers came without tomatoes and the other came without onions. Seriously? How hard is it to put in the basic ingredients to your basic cheeseburger. We didn't ask for anything fancy. Just the two original Shake Shack cheeseburgers. (This would never happen at In N Out. Just sayin'.)

Anyway. Idk how people wait HOURS for this burger. But. I'm glad I tried it once. So I have a right to say that In N Out is better than Shake Shack. Hands down. (But maybe I'm a bit biased). 

Check it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Best I've ever haaaaddd!!!! (John legend voice) I'm from Minneapolis so this was the first time I've been to shake shack. I had got the shake stack with the fried portobello mushroom. It was fabulous!!!!!!!! Fast service. Relaxing atmosphere. I never had a better burger from a restaurant. The patty was tender and juicy the bread didn't get soggy, it came with all the fixings and the fried portobello was stuffed with cheese!!!!! I wanted to try the jackpot ice cream but was too full :( guess I'll have to plan another trip to enjoy this wonderful place again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sad. It was just okay. I believed in the hype and kinda left feeling... Meh. 
The husband visited a SS location in Pennsylvania recently and gave me the skinny on the set up. He said the fries were the winner and that I would appreciate the crispness. He also predicted that I would like the bread, claiming it tastes like sweet Asian bread.
We were in town for Halloween weekend and decided to walk to New York New York to have lunch at Shake Shack from the Palazzo. Working up the appetite while being 7 months pregnant, we decided to split a burger and fries while I topped the meal off with a shake and the husband ordered a brew. The black and white shake was nothing to write home about. The burger itself reminded me of a cross between Smashburger and Hopdoddy's. The patty is thin with crispy edges. The bread is not your average bun, but it also didn't really stand out to me. Overall, it's the same size as an In and Out burg. Those crinkle cut fries though.
Damn.
Very crispy. I never knew crinkles could taste this good! Guy's burger place at The Linq are pretty similar- though the difference is you get a mix of different type of fries at his place.
Either way... I would come back to give them another try, but my first impression is a double shoulder shrug, sorry."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is very nice on the inside and has friendly staff.  The location is perfect and is works well for a quick bite.  When it comes to the food I got a double shack burger and crinkle fires.  Everything was good but tbh there was nothing truly stand out about the meal.  I was craving a burger and fries and I was glad that I got it but I also found myself wanting more or rather wanting a slightly better/different tasting burger.  
I am glad that they have other items on the menu because they look quite tasty, especially the desserts.  I will try the food again, especially those that aren't burgers but I won't go out of my way like when I was craving it a few weeks ago."}
{"text":"First time eating at Shake Shack, and I must say the hype is real. The fact that their hamburgers and chicken are free range and chemical free is outstanding. The burgers are very tasty, and the fries are good as well. The shakes are a must try! I say again the shakes are a must try! Prices are a little higher than most fast food chains, but of course, the quality of ingredients they use is not of your average fast food chain. You pay for what you get, and that's exactly what you get. Great ingredients, great flavor."}
{"text":"Was on a family trip to Vegas and burgers are my go to thing so I had to try it out! And it didn't disappoint!! The burgers were juicy and tasty,strawberry milkshake was great (could have been a little more blended to make it easier to drink) but never the less still so good! Double bacon cheesy fries were \"MMM\"! Even had chicken burger and it was so good! The chicken had a very nice crispiness and very moist but not overly oily! 

I like how they have cups for water or their house lemonades. 

Long lines but goes by fast and good service, location was also easy to find and in a good area.

There's always a debate between \"5 guys,In N out and Shake shack\". I like 5 guys but hands down I was converted into a Shake Shack women!"}
{"text":"I just had shake shack for the first time in NYC and OMG it's a million times better than the one in Scottsdale. However, I have already been three times this week because it's closer than In-N-Out and I've been craving cheeseburgers lately. Anyway, the burgers' bun is so cute and is like a little pita the way it's shut at one end. Love that. 

Strawberry shake and fries are epic."}
{"text":"Came here the week of opening. Tried a little bit of everything and can tell you it's all delish. A little pricey for what you get but I expect that since it's on the strip. They have some service issues to work out which is to be expected since it's new (e.g., took 10 minutes to get me a draft bud light, tables weren't getting bussed, etc.). I know there's a huge SS vs In n Out debate and I think SS might have the edge but this place is so hard to get to (parking at NYNY is awful, there's no entrance from the casino, etc.) that for someone not within walking distance, just drive to In n' Out and if you do have a car, this place might not be worth the hassle of parking. Very, very solid 4 stars!"}
{"text":"The worst burgers I had so far. The burgers are so greasy and saggy. I don't recommend the Shake stake, the Chicken N' shake, nor their shakes. The only thing I like is the fries. I would rather order off McDonald's doller menu..."}
{"text":"Just ate here...I'm a big fan of Habit Burger...SS much better. Shake Shack burgers kick ass! Burgers taste fresh not frozen...cheese fries amazing! Quick service! 5 stars! The Goose Island 312 wheat went great the Smoke Shack burger!"}
{"text":"I tried Shake Shack for the first time when I was in NYC, and was immediately hooked! When I heard Las Vegas was getting a Shake Shack, I knew I had to visit while in Vegas! Just as tasty as I remember!"}
{"text":"Being from L.A., the closest Shake Shack I had until very recently was the West Hollywood location. And unless you live in that area (which is basically as far as away from the freeways as you can get), it'll take at least an hour minimum for me to get there...and that's if I'm lucky. So, being the out-of-towner that I am, when I happened to stumble upon Shake Shack in Scottsdale...YOU DON'T GOTTA TELL ME TWICE WHAT TO DO.

And apparently I came at the right time for my very random client visit to Scottsdale, as this location was only open for about two weeks when I stopped by. Pretty shocked that it was as empty as it was at 8 PM. Think there were more employees in the store at the time than customers. You go to the new Glendale location out here in SoCal and the lines are out the door and around the corner. Either way, I'm not complaining. Plus staff was pretty nice, can't complain about that.

Either way, if you come to Shake Shack and don't get the shroom in your burger, I don't really know why you came here. In a straight shootout, In-N-Out's burger is definitely better than Shake Shack. But the shroom is what defines Shake Shack, and it was just as good here as it was in New York and Las Vegas.

This time though, I decided to experiment since I always get the Shack Stack (beef patty + shroom). To even my own surprise, the fried chicken patty with the shroom is BETTER than the Shack Stack. Chicken was super moist and the fried chicken batter wasn't overpowering as compared to the rest of the burger. Might've found a winning combination there! O_O

And yes, do yourself a favor and get one of their Concretes. You'll feel super fat afterwards, but they're too damn good not to have when you come through."}
{"text":"Having made Shake Shack one of my automatic must-eat spots in New York every time I go there, I was jumping for joy when I found out that they decided to open up a Shake Shack in Las Vegas! Looked up the location...of course they would put in New York New York. OF COURSE GUYS.

Anyways, veterans of Shake Shack know that if you've never been here, you always get that Shack Stack with a side of crinkle cut fries. Because, obviously, the Shack's regular burger isn't going to beat out In-N-Out. But last I checked, no one has a fried portabello mushroom stuffed with cheese either. Although hey, they let me add crispy onions on top too this time around. MUCH WIN WAS HAD.

The only issue I have with the location of this place is that it's really only accessible by walking. If you drive here, you end up having to park in NY NY's parking garage. Not bad, but it's still a bit of a walk. That said, when you have the choice between walking 10 minutes vs. flying 6 hours to New York, the obvious answer is obvious."}
{"text":"Shake Shack has always been one of the \"occasional cravings\" I forget I have until I see it available to me on the side of the road. Driving through Las Vegas, I caught sight of the familiar logo and squealed with delight.

You can never go wrong with a chick'n shack or the shack-cago dog. I wish the fries were better, I always get them but they never seem to hit the spot. Occasionally a little cold and mushy--but I feel like that's the brand of fry, the thick crinkle cut-type. 

If you get a change to have their frozen hot chocolate, DO IT. So delicious! Complete with little chunks of chocolate that fit perfect through the straw, it was a delicious ending to top off my meal. 

The employees were fine, they were fast and did their job well. Nothing too brag about or note, but nothing to complain about either. 

TIPS & TRICKS: 
* If you've got a \"furry child\", ask if about their menu for dogs. They have some biscuits you can treat your favorites to! 
* Keep your buzzer close, that's how they alert you that your food is ready."}
{"text":"As fine as it was, I don't quite see what all the hub is all about... Sorry if I just completely offended the entire city of Vegas and New York combined!   

It was totally packed and is an restaurant that everyone needs to go to at least once in their life, but I probably won't be making it a #1 priority in my life anytime soon. 

We got everything \"Shack\" on the menu. The burger, the fries, the chicken burger, the hot dog, and the custard treat to top it off. Here's a little \"mini\" review of each. 

Burger: Could've done without it. It was just a regular cheeseburger with lettuce and a tomato--I'm pretty sure I could've make a tastier one, and that's saying something because my PB&J's are still subpar... 

Chicken burger: This was a winner in my book! Get it. The chicken was juicy and had a perfect crispness to it. Not only that, but the PICKLES helped boost it to the next level. Seriously, this was the best choice of the night. 

Fancy Hot Dog: The \"Shack-ago Dog\" was fine too. It had a pickle spear, some very strong onions, and some gnarly peppers. I've never been a fan of hot dogs; however, if you are, you might like it. 

Fries: They were crinkle cut and I'm sure were very good when they initially came out of the fryer, but I think ours had sat for a hot minute before our buzzer called us to the window because they were slightly floppy. We got cheese fries with the cheese on the side, and that was a good decision seeing as those floppy fries would've been toast by the time we started eating! 

Custard: Pretty melted by the time our hot food met up with it on the tray, but the chocolate and brownie bites were delicious! 

The employees were quick and helpful, and the atmosphere was fun too. We did have to wait for about 1/2 an hour, but that's normal considering we got enough food to feed an army. Again, it was a pleasant experience just not one I'd make time for again. 

TIPS & TRICKS: 
* If you dig the heat, there is seating outside with some nice \"misters\" to help cool you off! 
* Park in the New York New York garage, and if you can order and eat in under an hour, your parking is free!"}
{"text":"Another burger joint in Vegas but this was a semi miss for me.  The pricing for a burger being about $5 without even the fries?  The taste of the burger was lacking.  It needed seasoning.  I'd say this is better then White Castle but I can't say this is a contender as far as Vegas goes.  The fries and burger portions were small personally.  If I paid $17 for food I would expect larger portions.  The shake (the coffee fair shake) was probably the best thing about the meal.  That was a $5 shake.  At least I can say I tried another Vegas eatery, but I would opt for a Gordon Ramsy Burgr by Planet Hollywood if I am gonna pay $17 for a meal."}
{"text":"My bf's first time here, however I first tried this spot in New York. Everything we ordered was delicious and on point. We ordered the double shack, cheese fries, portobello mushroom burger which I added and a meat patty, a regular shack burger, coffee concrete, and a pitcher of beer. Food was even more enjoyable since they have a huge screen tv, cold AC as it was scorching hot outside, and we were able to watch the dubs beat the cavaliers. Go Shake Shack and go Warriors!!"}
{"text":"This place definitely lived up to the hype for me and my group. We were all impressed with the high quality tasting meat and buns. The line was a decent length but went quickly and ordering was efficient and quick too. Despite the line we felt the wait for the burger was reasonable. I highly recommend any burger fans to come check this place out! 
BTW - the place is much easier to find if you enter it from the strip, we got a little lost in NY NY trying to find it."}
{"text":"This place is great! Food was hot, fresh and delish! Service is outstanding. The manager there is what you wish to see in other places. On the floor the whole time we were there. He was making rounds being helpful where he could be and making sure everyone is happy. So far the BEST place in downtown Summerlin we've eaten at. Definitely will be back! Try that yummy bacon cheeseburger and that red velvet concoction of delishousness!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the third  time. Parking  lot was full but the restaurant  was not that busy. We tried the mushroom burger. And cheese hot dog and cheese fries. Single  burgers are a little  small.  Their  buns are buttery.  . Service was a little  slow  but the staff is friendly. Did not like their shakes which is small and too sweet"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place. I'd give it 3.5 stars. The burgers are good. A little less greasy than 5 Guys but still not as good as In n Out. The fries are really good and highly recommend. I would go back but there are more burger places in Vegas I  want to still try. 

I'm glad I went but sort of disappointed in the same breath."}
{"text":"Tried going there previously but lines were too long . The restaurant  is like Culver's or inn and out burger . Prices are a little higher . The bread was light and fluffy. Burger was a little  salty but good flavor . Fries were a little  over cooked.  Shakes were average  but a little pricier.  Dairy queen is better. It took about 7 minutes once we ordered."}
{"text":"Like many others, I've heard rave reviews about Shake Shack and was excited to find out they opened a location in Scottsdale...I was even more excited to find out another location had opened in Uptown Phoenix-a much more convenient drive from North Phoenix.
My son and I stopped in for lunch yesterday before hitting up the Art Detour in the Roosevelt District around 1pm and there was a line out the door. I figured at that time of the day there would be a wait so we didn't mind. They had an employee outside handing out menus and also had umbrellas set up so we didn't cook in the unseasonably warm March weather. We waited in line maybe a total of 10 minutes, but again, going during normal lunchtime hours, I expected to wait a little. 
I ordered the single shake burger, a hot dog for him, fries, a camelshack concrete, and a drink to share which altogether came out to be about $21. I can't say I was blown away by anything. The burger was a pretty decent burger. Whatever the shake sauce is great, and the burger itself tasted really fresh. I loved the crinkle fries, as did my son. And the camelshack was good as well; vanilla custard with pieces of banana cream pie and a caramel sauce. I think next time I'd order it sans caramel sauce because it's was almost overwhelmingly sweet, but live and learn, right? 

Overall, I was impressed. We had a nice lunch at a decent price but I don't see myself going out of my way anytime soon to be back- now, if a location were to pop up on my side of town, I may reconsider."}
{"text":"I'll give it 4 stars since the service was pretty good, but really I found this to be around a 3.5 star meal. I'm sure I was destined for disappointment because of all the hype surrounding this place. My friends from NY are constantly raving about Shake Shack and the fated In N Out v. Shack Shake debate has been ongoing with people arguing for both sides. 

This particular location is a Vegas hotspot, so there's almost always a line and finding a seat for a big group isn't easy. I got the Smoke Shake (cheeseburger with bacon and cherry peppers) and cheese fries. My experience was already going off to a bad start before even ordering because I didn't anticipate the prices here would be so hefty. My burger was about $7 and the fries are $3-4 (I forget). Once I got my food, I noticed the portion size...like, these burgers are pretty dang small. I also was expecting a bigger volume of fries, but I appreciated that they weren't drenched in cheese. 

It wasn't all bad though: for the size, the burger was super filling. It's a pretty heavy meal, which can be good or bad depending on what you're into. The meat was flavorful and the cherry peppers were a GREAT addition to the bacon and meat (they weren't that spicy though, which was disappointing). And while I'm not usually a fan of crinkle-cut fries, I did enjoy the crunch factor of the fries and the flavor of the cheese. 

Verdict: In N Out takes the cake for sure. It's cheaper, tastes fresher, and is faster. I think my friends all agreed as well. But Shake Shack wouldn't have such a loyal East Coast following if at least some people didn't find it amazing, so I'd recommend giving it a try at least once to gauge for yourself.

Also, free refills for soda!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try Shake Shack and wasn't very impressed. If you love In-n-Out like I do, it will probably fall short of your expectations. I tried their ShackBurger ($5.19)- a cheeseburger topped w lettuce, tomato, and Shack sauce and their vanilla shake ($5.25). The portions are tinyyy and food is overpriced. You could probably finish the burger in a few bites. The shake was also a little too sweet for my taste. 

Definitely worth trying once but I'll stick to In-n-Out!"}
{"text":"Takes me back to new york. Line moves fast. Large menu fonts. Great vibe that doesn't feel like vegas ... if you know what I mean. Yum yum yum. What more can I say? Hotdog fries and a burger."}
{"text":"Don't expect a drive thru or restaurant parking lot at this location. I had to park in a parking garage and walk for at least 10 minutes to get to the front door. For that reason alone I brought it down one star. What brought it down another star  was the three dollars I had to pay for a small soda. The burger was very tasty and you'll know where your $7-8 spent just for the burger went when you bite into it. I understand that the single is 4 ozs unlike the single at in and out burger which is only 2 ounces."}
{"text":"Great burger great service love Shake Shake. I had the Stack Shake burger which had a cheeseburger topped with a fried stuffed with cheese portobello mushroom and cheese fries. Great place just be prepared to pay to park at all casino hotels on the strip now which was a surprising first."}
{"text":"Located in Downtown Summerlin, comes Las Vegas, Nevada's second location....only after its New York-New York Hotel & Casino location. This Burger & Shake joint hails from New York, a well known spot where customers line up for a bite to eat regardless of how long it is.

The place is very dapper, hip, with a contemporary classic modern twist. It's simple, not too flashy, but most importantly clean.  Restrooms are pretty clean as well with a stainless steel appeal! ...And on the real...The place just recently opened up a couple weeks ago....so cleanliness should be expected...lets hope they keep it that way.  TV's surround the upper wall ceiling for a casual feel. Wife and sister in law and I came during an off time on a Sunday afternoon, around 3pm, so this place was not crowded at all, plenty of seating to choose from and the line was minimal. That being said the location does boast an outside seating area to match its indoor seating...weather permitting. However, expect this place to be packed during peak hours, lunch and dinner especially on weekends. The good news is that Downtown Summerlin hosts plenty of restaurants and eatery joints with more opening soon, so it does help spread foot traffic from all those hungry shoppers.

Menu choices do contain a variety, but not as much as far as burgers go. They do offer hot dogs and simple yet crinkle fries with shack cheese. Shakes & thick creamery delicacy serve up to those sweet tooth looking for something to go with the delicious meal. Regular drinks come on the smaller side, but they offer free refills, actually when you do refill the drink, they give you an entirely new cup! (How bout that?) 

Staff were friendly, helpful and did provide a better experience. Found the staff to be plenty and in full force. So with a crowd coming in, looks like they were prepared to battle it out. 

All in all, our overall experience was excellent. Everything from service to ambience to food was on par. Burgers were juicy and on point, maybe not the healthiest, but it sure does hit the spot. I do recommend checking the place out to blanket your pallets with a mouth watering juicy and flavorful burger. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Shake Shack and to be honest I was a bit overwhelmed. However, the staff were all more than willing to help me understand the menu and the way the restaurant worked. I met a friend here for lunch and we had a wonderful time. I ordered the chicken sandwich with a drink and it was wonderful. Tons of flavor and it did not fall completely apart when I ate it. We sat inside and it was nice because it was a bit too warm outside."}
{"text":"Good burgers. Hot dog was mediocre. Burgers are a tad smaller for what you pay for, but you can taste the quality of the meat. Fries were good and crispy. Stack shack was a bit too heavy and greasy for my taste, but the regular burger is good. Second time here and will probably just go to In n Out for half the price and deliciousness."}
{"text":"First time here. Came in on a Tuesday at around 5. Line was short and wait time for food wasn't too bad at all. Service was excellent. 

Ordered the double cheeseburger with no lettuce and tomato. Well seasoned, juicy, meaty flavors. The buns were perfect, soft, fluffy, almost spongy. I love crinkle fries- don't know what's up with all the hate. These were better than In n Out fries. Thick, hot, crispy. Burger wise, I love them both. I live 5 mins from In n Out. But if Ss was just as close I'd visit both of them the same equal amount. 

Thank you to the manager type dude who said my vanilla custard was on the house. It really made my day. Custard is soft and velvety and creamy. I really enjoyed my experience!"}
{"text":"I wish I could say I loved this place....but I didnt. Years ago I read about the original NYC location and all its buzz....so I was excited to be able to finally try it. This LV location created some buzz as well, so we paid a visit. Myself and 3 companions went in April 2015 for supper.  I ordered the Smoke Shack single, crinkle cut fries and root beer. The fries were literally no different than the ones you were served in grade school or Ore Ida...the burger was dressed with lettuce, tomato and onion which were fresh enough, then some ham and bacon. ..really didn't detect those much, and the burger was pretty bland as well. The bun was basic. The only redeeming feature was the sauce which had a little tang to it. Quite honestly Culver's or Fat burger deliver better burgers...cheaper. The design of the restaurant was trendy and we were able to sit outside which I liked. Service was very cheery and pleasant which I appreceiated. By LV standards this is an affordable place to eat...but I still can't help but to feel that $17 is too much for a boring burger meal. Sorry."}
{"text":"First timer here and I'd have to say the food was yummy. I got a regular cheese burger but for the pricy I wish it was bigger. The cheese fries are so mouthwatering. I got the pumpkin pie shake which is reallly good. I think I'd come back for the shakes and fries more than the burger."}
{"text":"CA native here born and raised.  Dont compare to In n Out. You are comparing apples to oranges.  In n out is a fast food/drive thru chain.  Shake shack is not.

Now, with that said, WOW shake shack.  I dont kno what yall do or what is in that subtle sauce but wow.  Amazing.  Meat is cooked perfectly.  Soft bun. very cheesy.  Just goodness.

Enjoy!! But remember...do not compare the two burger spots.  Thats like comparing panda express to an authentic chinese restaurant. Totally different worlds."}
{"text":"I have read such great things about this place. My wife's burger was undercooked and it didn't live up to all the hype that it was."}
{"text":"Love this burger.  I'm a fan of their west coast comparison, but this has got to be just as good, maybe a tad better! 

What makes it just as good as their West Coast rival is their BUN and BEEF.  It's a freshly made bun which doesn't over-bear but still has a great texture firmness and flavor to it.  The beef is moist, juicy and in perfect ratio to all the other ingredients. 

Love the ice creams, the concretes, the shakes, and they even serve Craft Beers!"}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing but I just feel like it's over priced even tho I feel that way I still keep going back to get me a double  burger with a strawberry shake no need for fries but the fries are delicious you could get cheese or cheese and bacon"}
{"text":"YAY!!  Shake Shack is in Scottsdale!!  Woot woot!  I discovered Shake Shack when I was working in Washington, DC last year.  It became my go-to place for a very delicious inexpensive all-American meal.  The very best hamburgers I have EVER eaten, and the home-made custard is heaven.  The ambience is great for all ages - from 5 to 100!  We are all here - and the hamburgers never disappoint.  I get two doubles - because they are so yummy.  The first one is to inhale, the 2nd to savor.  The fries are clean, not oily, and made with the freshest potatoes.  Seriously, I come back over and over again for the hamburgers but the custard is an added plus.  To find them in Fashion Square:  across from Harkins Theater in the mall.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Shake shack lives up to the hype, the pictures you see are definitely what you eat. I have had plenty burgers to compare their chicken burger and it is easily comparable to the best of them. 

The service was good plenty of friendly staff. The system they have going for seating and delivery of the food is great nothing to complain about.

A must is the fries it looks like most people go with just cheese on the fries but they actually come with bacon and chopped up little red peppers. The blend of all those toppings on the fries makes them great don't switch it up.

One of the best things is the concrete, it is rare to come across good frozen custard but this one brought back memories of the first time I tried it."}
{"text":"I have been here about 10 times and never had a bad experience. I think I go to Vegas more for shake shack than for Vegas. They have great burgers with potato buns, mealty cheese, and fresh burger patties. Clean establishment, and fun casual/fast food spot."}
{"text":"Let me start with there's nothing wrong with this location (clean, new, bright), the service we received at this location (which was pleasant and prompt), nor the quality of the food we received (wasn't terrible). However, being the first time to any Shake Shack, we were not impressed by the business model - if you're going to be simple, what you do should be stellar - as something we would ever want again. Essentially, while there was nothing wrong, there's also nothing good. So many other options at Kierland."}
{"text":"Honestly, it wasn't as great, but I mean I guess I'll have to try it again. I ordered the shroom burger."}
{"text":"This was the first time I ever had shake shack back in 2015. It was delicious. The fries are also so bomb. They could improve on sauces. We want ranch!

Grade: Oh Honey yes!"}
{"text":"Wow! SHAKE SHACK really lived up to the hype! I went on a solo mission while in Las Vegas and was really impressed with the food and service. 

I had a tough choice with the menu, so many good burgers - simple or special? And their dessert list was huge. I decided on the SmokeStack (double burger with bacon, cheese and peppers), crinkly fries and a \"blueberry pie, oh my\" frozen custard. 

The burger was great! It was spicy and the meat was juicy and messy. The fries were good. And that blueberry pie custard was friggin amazing. I was impressed with this spot. 

Better than In n Out! Can't wait for someone to build one in the South Bay! 4.75 stars!"}
{"text":"had shake shack 2x within 2 wks in 2 different states / cities.

verdict?  the shake shack in lv doesn't quite live up to the presentation standards of shake shack.

our shack burger was squashed and just didn't look as appetizing as the shack burger from previous week.  my 'shroom burger was lukewarm.

those chili cheese fries tho..........  yum.

if you parked at the nyny casino parking, you best hope they can get you in and out of shake shack in 1 hour or else you're paying a hefty parking fee.  the shake shack staff rudely replied \"no one validates parking\" when i asked if parking was validated...

oh las vegas, you are leaving less and less to be desired."}
{"text":"I wasn't as impressed as I was hoping I would be. We got shack burger and a smoke shake burger. The shack just tasted like plain ground beef, nothing fancy. The smoke shack was only tasted better because the plain beef taske was masked by the cherry peppers and bacon. The milkshake we got wasnt much better. Infact the only thing I was impressed with was their free cups of water. It tasted like it was filtered, no city water taste to it. I'm glad we gave it a try but won't be coming back."}
{"text":"That's a winning combo right there.

Hubby and I came in to have some fatty fast food, and aside from In N Out which we have access to at home, Shake Shack sounded like a great idea. 

The restaurant is at a beautiful location, well kept inside and the staff is super nice.  We ordered burgers with bacon of course, crinkle fries, a shake for him and a sea salt caramel hot chocolate for me. 

Though my burger was a wee bit greasier than I'd like, it was quite tasty and reminded me of something home made.  Fries were  very oreida crinkles which I love and that hot chocolate?! Wow, best seasalt caramel hot chocolate I have ever had. And surprisingly, I've had quite a few!"}
{"text":"When I eat a burger, this is my burger of choice. Quality meat and good sauce and juicy burger.  Love the crinkle fries. Love the Shakes.  

Clean place, good location,  friendly people."}
{"text":"High prices, high expectations. Got a meal for 2 and we're at $30. Boy, this better be good. 

We got the Smoke Shack, Shake Shack, 2 Fries, a Pie oh Boy, and a 50/50. Let's go down the list and talk about how each was!

Smoke Shack: this was my burger and hmmm I didn't love it with my first bite. It was drenched in sauce and for some reason was extremely sour. I think it was sour because of the red pepper maybe?  Beef patty itself was salty. 

Shake Shack: 10/10 would recommend! Your typical cheeseburger with a flair. 

Fries: Never really liked crinkle fries til' I tasted theirs. 

Pie oh Boy (Blueberry Pie): Rich and creamy and very pie-like. 

I'm still extremely excited that Charlotte is getting up there in joints that only appear in big cities. Love this city!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try it out after seeing so many great looking pics on IG. The dining area was spacious and clean...cool, simple theme. If it's your first time there, the wall menu can be a bit overwhelming. The cashier was so nice and helpful he got me through my order. Ended up with the chicken sandwich, regular cheese burger, single order of fries and a single vanilla custard. The sandwich and burger looked pretty good, but man are the small...smaller than in n out. $3 for a tray of fries...crazy! I thought they'd be enough to share, but really. The chicken sandwich was good, a bit salty. My son said his burger was good, but not better than in n out. Custard was good, nothing special. So in my opinion, by the number times I used good to describe it...it was just that.. good. Not delicious, not awesome, not spectacular...just good. For the price and portions I probably wouldn't set out to go there on purpose, maybe if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"The chocolate shake was watery with very little flavor.  In-N-Out's is bland also but at least it's thicker.  The crinkle fries were crunchy and ok but nothing great.  The frozen custard had a nice creamy texture but   almost no flavor either.  Food that's an indulgence ought to taste GOOD."}
{"text":"My husband wanted a shake and we wanted to try something new. As soon as I opened the door I was greeted very friendly and welcoming. I told the order taker I've never been there before so what to try. He was so helpful with giving suggestions and even topping it off with - it's free for your add ons. 

I waited less than 5 mins, we ordered the Chicago style hot dog, grilled chicken club, fries and chocolate and strawberry shakes. Like another review, the bun was half cut open so it perfectly kept the chicken and toppings in place. The gal who gave me my food instantly gave me direction where to find straws and condiments. 

Overall, food and staff were great. I wish I had remembered to take a pic of our meal. We will be back."}
{"text":"So I'm from California and I'm not a fan of In-n-Out! I know that seems to be a bit weird but honestly I've had better burgers and the ones at the Shake Shack are better! There just seems to be a difference in quality that stands out at the Shake Shack. 

So I stuffed my face twice while I was on my trip. They open at 11 am and by 11:09 they were already starting to get busy so I would get there early. We passed by in the late afternoon and the line was WAY out the door. They have an outside line or \"C\" line for drinks and frozen custard only which is helpful when you want something quick. 

I had the SmokeShack which had bacon, chopped cherry peppers and ShackSauce. The cherry peppers weren't too spicy but it gave the burger some good flavor. The bacon was nice and they weren't cheap with it either. 

My second visit I had the 'Shack Stack which has a burger patty and the fried Portobello mushroom on it. The Portobello mushroom is fried and has cheese in the middle of it. It is kinda messy to bite into since the cheese just explodes out of it. While it did add some flavor, I didn't think the breading on the mushroom was all that great. It didn't have enough flavor to it. The meat on the burger though was very good and I enjoyed that. 

I had the cheese fries the first time and the second time I added fried shallots to my cheese fries for a $1.00 more. Adding the shallots was worth the extra buck since it added some salty crunch to the cheese fries. 

I had the shake of the week which was a peanut butter banana and it was good but the flavor seemed to get lost. It didn't matter though because I was still eating frozen custard and that makes it the best. I also had a black & white shake which is really just vanilla and chocolate blended together and that was super creamy and yummy. I also had an 'All shook up' concrete and that had way too much going on. 
The concrete had vanilla custard, Gimme Some Sugar banana peanut butter cheesecake, and chocolate toffee. I didn't really taste the banana peanut butter in the cheesecake and the chocolate toffee got hard to eat as it was getting colder in the custard. 

I loved going here and glad that I don't have to go to New York to try them now. I'll keep coming back because it was good and for what I got it wasn't too bad of a price."}
{"text":"We have In N Out here in California and I heard that Shake Shack is the best of East Coast so of course we need to check this place out.

We tried one of their Chick'n Shack (Chicken Sandwich), a ShackBurger (Cheese Burger) and one of their Concretes and all cost about $20. 

The food was good but not WOW and it's kind of overpriced for the size of it. The line is long at this location by New York New York and the staff was kinda of rude keep yelling at us to move the line while we were not able to move any further. 

Overall Shake Shack does have more varieties and choices than In N Out and their burger patties does come thicker. But it did not WOW me."}
{"text":"Tasty food. Friendly service. Nice and comfortable decor. 

There are better burgers, but overall the taste and experience is a good value. It's definitely worth a try if you're at The District anyway."}
{"text":"????????????????5??????????????????????????????????????????????????
????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I just had shake shack for the first time ever, and it was amazing!! The food was delicious, friendly staff, and the restaurant was clean and organized. This staff is on point and I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite burger joint. It was great in London and I was so excited to find it on the west coast. Try the cheese fries. They're delicious!"}
{"text":"Been waiting to try this place for a while because I'm not on the east coast. Wasn't impressed by the thin burger patty or the brownie batter milkshake I got. The best part of the meal was the french fries. The line is long but it moves really fast. Lots of people constantly moving around making it hard to go around the restaurant. It was pretty expensive too. I don't know if I'd come back again. Maybe to try a different milkshake or get fries!"}
{"text":"Coming back from a trip from NY where I ordered from the OG Shack where it all started....I had SS on my brain after being back in town.  

Lets start with that soft potato non-gmo pillowy bun....just great quality ingredients in every layer.  Yup that's right I don't never ever overlook a set of great buns hun.  Personally I would pay $15 for this burger....Yes!  It's a burger.....this ain't no stinkin' buffet....so whenever available hell yea I'm choosing quality over quantity.

Even the fries......YES the ever so popular crinkle cut fries...even the artificial ingredients and preservatives are removed.  So they ain't your run of the mill crinkle cut fries.  So when add this burger + fries combo at SS.  You got a 4 star winning combo!

So bottomline here's the deal.  If you got a big appetite or perhaps your on a \"budget\" than well.....what I'm trying to say is the Shack just ain't going to cut the mustard.  If you appreciate a premium product and your OK eating a relatively pedestrian burger that isn't the size of your dome piece.  Oh did I not already mention they have fantastic soft buns of steel?!"}
{"text":"The old shake shack vs. In N Out debate. The burger aesthetically looks better than in n out and the buns are of better quality but I would favor in n outs burger over shake shack. The fries are about the same depending if you like a crisper fry (in n out) or a softer fry (shake shack). I would say shake shack's shakes are better because you can actually drink it compared to the thick in n out shake."}
{"text":"Two words, THE BOMB!!  It was great, prices were reasonable for a new restaurant on the strip and the burger was awesome, no frozen patties or day old buns here!  

Hoping they bring one of these to Northern California one day!  This will be a definite spot to eat at next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Interior and atmosphere wise it's pretty nice and hip, but the price to portion size ratio is just not appealing at all. Taste is just average. The bun is too dense for me, it sticks together when I bite into it. I mean, I cab get the same thing at In-N-Out for more than half off the price. The milkshakes were pretty good tho because of the different flavors, but it's not like wow. If I have to pay the same price I would rather get burgers at Red Robin's, they get free refills on fries too."}
{"text":"Came through opening weekend with my boyfriend.
It was Sunday afternoon and there was no line at all which was a nice surprise considering that it had just opened! 

Really clean and modern decor inside. All the staff there are so friendly and helpful.

We ordered the shroom burger and cheese fries. It was amazing. Definitely didn't know there was hot piping cheese in the inside of the deep fried mushroom patty. Guess we didn't look at the menu close enough. But the burger was super delicious and the cheese fries... so simple yet so good.

Definitely gonna add this joint to our list of go-to food spots whenever we hit up Vegazzz!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack is here!  Who cares?  I've been to Shack locations in both NY and Philly, and those were leaps and bounds above the experience I had at the new Vegas location.  It was just underwhelming.  Completely underwhelming.  My burger was dripping grease from every spot possible.  I love burgers and I have a tolerance for a certain amount of fat, but the bun shouldn't be soggy before I finish.

And let's talk about that bun.  I dont know what it was but something was just a little off.  There was a little metallic taste to it that was really unpleasant.  

Overall, this was just not the same experience I had in the east coast locations.  If this was my only Shake Shack experience ever, I dont think I would go back.

To be fair to the employees, they were amazing.  Everyone was very friendly, helpful, and happy to be there.  Multiple people offered to clean the table and take away our trays / trash.  This service is the only thing saving this review from being a 1-star."}
{"text":"Hamburgers and shakes are nothing special. Was really disappointed since I heard so much about them. Spent $25 for two hamburgers, two drinks and an order of fries. The hamburgers would be called sliders in any other resturant in Las Vegas since they are very small. The fries were okay but I think they tried to do a double fry technique on them but were only marginally successful. The inside of the resturant was rented out for a party and when we tried to go in one of the waitress told us we couldn't go in just sit outside at the picnic tables and she would take our order. She never came back. We realized that you had to go inside to order so we did. They gave us a buzzer so we could get our food at the counter when it was ready, but some of the food was being brought out and delivered. We had to go get ours. The staff is very disorganized."}
{"text":"Great looking burger but a total disappointment. My friend loves these burger but I don't understand what the draw is. 

The burger was very attractive when placed in the tray, but it was downhill after the first bite. The bread rolls are the big let down in this burger. My teeth just sunk into what felt like a marshmallow that stuck to the roof of my mouth.  Actually it was softer than biting into a marshmallow not a good textual feeling"}
{"text":"Nothing special. I ordered the shake shack burger and split an order of fries with my husband who got the smoked burger. I feel like five guys has a better burger and fries for way less money. Glad I tried it but not worth a return trip."}
{"text":"A Shake Shack in Vegas where I can relive my memories when I was visiting NYC last year? Count me in!

Their burgers and cheese fries are amazing. But it's definitely a little pricey for a meal because you gotta buy everything separately but well worth every dollar. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at an outrageous price!!! I've been twice and I won't be back. My food was just ok. Freddy's is just as good and a way better deal. I payed $30.00 for 2 burgers 2 drinks and we shared 1 fry. The girl behind the counter had an uninterested attitude and they forgot my milkshake. To top it all off the portions are small. I don't mind spending the money if the product is good. It's just fast food with a fancy gimmick, trendy decor, and a loud stereo."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger and fries.  Would like to try some other options next time.  Fast service for sure."}
{"text":"A nice spot for a juicy burger! The service here is impressive for a small burger joint... attentive staff to bring you ketchup, water and napkins. As for the burgers themselves- delicious! I typically like my burgers cooked well, but these are medium to medium well and perfect! Fries are also really tasty. I do have to say that the price is a little up there, but for a splurge I'll spend the extra few dollars. Expect to pay around $14 a person for a burger, fries and a drink."}
{"text":"East Coast Food on the Vegas Desert... 

Great tasting food and shakes at reasonable prices.

I definitely tasted the freshness.

I enjoyed a Smoked Shack Burger which came with applewood smoked bacon, grilled onions, diced red pepper, lettuce, tomato and cheese! 

I also tried a Chicago Dog which was very delicious and filling... Just wish I devoured it first as it did get a bit soggy.

My wife added fries, a shake and a regular Shack Burger.

The restaurant was packed on a midweek late dinner time (10pm) but the lines moved quickly.

I like that there are communal dining areas as well as individual areas. There were also huge TVs and an unbeatable view of the Las Vegas Strip. 

I'll be back again for sure but now I have the dilemma of determining which burger joint I like the best... 

It's a toss up between the West Coast In N Out..."}
{"text":"A bit expensive, and not as good as in NY but I'm glad they have it. The girl who took our order was not very nice and did not pay attention. Giving us only 1 burger (double patio shack stack), instead of 2 burgers (1 double cheeseburger and 1 shack stack)."}
{"text":"First stop in Vegas was Shake Shack. My dude and I have visited Shake Shack in New York before and were a big fan of the cheese fries, so we thought we should get them again in Vegas.

We were expecting a long line, but it went by quickly. However, it was packed.. it was hard to find seating for our group of 4 but people came in and out so we were able to find seats in a big communal table. We got the shack dog (hot dog with cheese and fried onion) shack stack (cheeseburger with a fried portabello mushroom), and cheese fries. All of them were as good as I remember from NY, especially the cheese fries. After eating all that we went to the free photo booth in the middle of the restaurant and took some pictures.

Before I end this review, you may ask me, me being a Socal native: In N Out or Shake Shack? Shake Shack is pretty good.. but In N Out all the way for me. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Um, maybe it's a subconscious NY thing, but I prefer Shake Shack over In n' Out any day. Their burgers are full of flavor with crunchy vegetables and their buns don't get soggy. Their fries are crispy and always cooked perfectly (I can't stand soggy fries!). They also serve beer and malts (two other things you can't get at In n' Out). Shake Shack is a winner in my book. Oh, and if you see the bacon cheddar shack on the menu, get it, it's worth every calorie."}
{"text":"1000x better than my first time experiencing at NYC 

Beef was seasoned really well and cooked just right 

Concrete was heavenly (Jackpot is aptly named) 

Overall Thoughts

Whatever they are doing here please keep it up!"}
{"text":"I ordered the smokehouse burger and it was delicious!!! It had a bit of spice because of cherry peppers. The cheese fries were so delicious! I also ordered a brownie shake and I wasn't delicious!!! Came with brownie pieces inside! My boyfriend ordered the chicken sandwich and it was nice and crispy! Will definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"My actual rating: 3.5 -btw, when can we start giving halfsies!?

I had average expectations even though a friend hyped the sh*t out of Shake Shack to the point I was convinced he worked in their PR department. I was apprehensive about writing a review for Shake Shack because well, I just didn't care for it. Especially those super salty, crinkle cut fries that make me feel like I'm eating cafeteria food -remember those yucky Ore Ida fries? Or its overwhelming prices and lack of a salad option -YES, I do realize it's a BURGER place but at these prices and the fact they are closer to a restaurant than a fast food establishment, they could have at least one salad. I mean, even Jack in the Box has salads... Just think about it.

Ordered:
- ShackBurger - double cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce.

- Crinkle Cut Fries - cripsy, crunchy, salty potato-y goodness! (copied from their menu. Oh yes, they do mean salty.)

- Beer Float - beer with a scoop of ice cream. Pretty self explanatory haha.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for shelling out a few more dollars for a great, restaurant worthy burger (like at BurGR ;) but not at Shake Shack. Although their burger was good, it didn't WOW me. Neither did their \"oh so famous\" crinkle cut fries, or their beer float. And call me a snob, a B, or any other name because you're one of those die hard SS fans but at these prices, I expect to be WOW'ed or at least impressed.

But I'm not saying they don't make yummy food, because they obviously do which is why they're expanding; [it's just not for me]. I waited to read Kevin's response to the whole Shake Shack vs In-n-Out debate: http://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/shake-shack-vs-in-n-out-which-is-better-shake-shack-or-in-n-out  But I couldn't agree more with his points. I think if there's a next time, I'll stick to dessert only and maybe a Bag 'o' Bones for my puppy... that's if I get a puppy too lol!

**try it for yourself and form your own opinion; because that's what yelp reviews are: each individual's opinion. :)"}
{"text":"too expensive for shit food , five guys is way better even McDonald's is better than what I just had . didn't even come with fries and paid 16$ bucks for a burger and a small ass shake . never coming back ."}
{"text":"My husband and I wander all over the valley to try restaurants. Prior to a movie, we stopped in at the Shake Shack and we were not impressed. 
I stuck to the basics - the single cheeseburger. I was never asked or given options as to what I wanted on it (5 Guys) - and when I ordered grilled onions (In-N-Out), was told they don't offer them \"because of other people that may have onion allergies.\"
The counter person also never asked me if I still wanted regular onions.....I had to ask. 
Let's review the \"no grilled onions\" excuse:
~How many MORE people want to order grilled onions than the rare person having an allergy??
~Do you have more than one grill?
~Can you grill onions at the beginning of the day and clean the grill?
~Do you own a skillet you can use separately for onions???

My husband had a bacon burger. Exactly what grill did they cook that on and do they have a \"halel \"
grill??
Someone seems to be lacking in basic critical thinking skills. 
The single cheeseburger I ordered was hardly larger than a slider - with very pink/medium rare meat. It was just average. Fries were good - very crispy, although not that hot when served. 
Lemonade was great. 
Bottom line: 
The food did not equal that of either 5 Guys OR In-N-Out and certainly didn't justify a $26 bill for 2 burgers/sm fries/drinks (no ice cream drinks)."}
{"text":"This was SO GOOD. burgers, fries and shakes. Really affordable. Stopped here on a drive from Sedona to Tucson and it was worth it."}
{"text":"Good burger, YUMMY CHOCOLATE SHAKE, fries ok. Would eat there again! Seating is limited and mostly outside."}
{"text":"ICE CHUNKS in the shakes!  They must be adding water to their mix to increase profit, because frozen custard should be creamy and smooth, and not have ice chunks.  AND the shakes had a funny aftertaste...did not taste like custard...tasted like a bad kind of ice cream.  ALSO, they have a dozen employees taking orders and only ONE guy making shakes.  There were 4 of us in our party, they gave us a beeper and made us wait for 20 minutes.  It was the SLOWEST customer service in a fast food restaurant.  Do not waste your time, or money (it was priced at $7.00 for a crappy shake)...NO THANKS, try another place"}
{"text":"We decided to have a family outing today by heading over to downtown Summerlin. After watching Planet of the Apes at the Regal Theaters we walked over to the Shake Shack to get a bite to eat. 

I was not disappointed by anything there but the only thing short in expectation was the hot cherry peppers that was listed in their Smokeshack burger. Don't get me wrong, the beef patty was fresh and buns were perfection, however, I wanted something spicy so I made my decision based on the menu I read. I forgive them though because there was a great amount of bacon in between those buns...c'mon who doesn't like bacon?!

A burger was $6 + which is a reasonable price for the quality burger they serve and the soft drinks came with unlimited refills (free of extra charge). The waiters were friendly and seemed happy to be there. 

There are booth seating, table seating and quick service. It was a clean and kid friendly setting so we had no problems chit chatting after our meal and just hanging at the shack for an extra 20 minutes. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Lots of hype and just ok food.  We went on a random week night and got a few burgers and fries.  The cheese fries just had melted american cheese, nothing special and the burgers, even with bacon and jalepenos had just ok flavor.  I would rather grab a fast burger at five guys or in n out.  I def wouldn't wait in line for this place!"}
{"text":"My burger, the shackburger, was ridiculously greasy. The fries really tasted like the frozen ore ida fries i buy at the grocery store. Did not try the shakes...have had shakeshack in NY and Atlanta and loved it. Atmosphere was fine, food was not. I do not recommend this particular location. Wont be back. Very expensive for the food quality."}
{"text":"Came here on their grand opening day at around 6:10 PM and proceeded to wait in line and for my food to be ready around one hour later. I don't anticipate the lines to be that long going forward but either way there will probably be a wait for quite some time until more people try out Shake Shack. Anyway I have to say that I was fairly impressed with both the food and service. The people working here were super friendly despite the opening day rush and it was great to see people excited to try out Shake Shack for the first time.

After looking over the menu and what they have to offer I ended up deciding on the Shack Burger, Chicken Shack, Crinkle Cut Fries, and a shake. I know that was a lot to eat through in one sitting but I really wanted to try out as many of their offerings as possible. So far I would have to say that the Shack Burger was my favorite as the burger was of very high quality and it was everything that I expected. I was also impressed with the fries as the outside texture of the fries had a nice crunch to them that most fries don't have. The Chicken Shack was very good as well however I would still prefer to get the Shack Burger over it. Lastly, the shake was nothing too special and will most likely not get a shake next time.

I know a lot of people do compare Shake Shack with In N Out. In the end I do prefer Shake Shack for their burgers and fries however their prices are on the higher end which will deter me from coming here more often. While the burgers here don't look that big they were actually quite filling, so do keep that in mind before placing in the order."}
{"text":"Tastes much better than In-N-Out, but not sure if it's worth the price...

Having grown up in California, I've had In-N-Out regularly. While I still love In-N-Out, I've had much better burgers; In-N-Out is just incredible for its price. I always heard that Shake Shack was the better In-N-Out, so I had been wanting to try it out.

I really liked my Shake Shack burger. I love that I can have both mushrooms and bacon in my burger, an option unavailable at In-N-Out. But it's almost 3 times the price of In-N-Out!! I would rather spend a couple extra dollars and get a higher quality burger at a place like The Counter.

{"text":"What a disappointment. Possibly the worst and SMALLEST burger I have ever tasted. No one in our group liked the burger. The only good thing about it was the green of the lettuce leaf. It just tastes strange and the sauce on it was tastless

The fries were really good. 

The black and white shake had no flavour at all.   

Will not be going back. Cannot understand what the hype was all about"}
{"text":"Great burgers and shakes! More convenient location than the Strip. Friendly servers and comfortable environment. Tons of other places to try around the area as well. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is located on the NYNY Boardwalk.  We came here to see what all the hype was about.  Personally, it did not leave an impression on me.  

You walk in and wait in line.  Then, you order your food and seat yourself.  There is plenty of seating indoors and a few tables outdoors.  There are tvs inside as well.  The decor is nice and clean.  I really like the look of it.  

Now, onto the food:
Yes, they have bacon in some of their burgers, but I still think In & Out is way better.  Shake Shack's burgers are okay and they are smaller than In&Out.  Since I won some money from gambling, I offered to pay for my friends' food.  I was surprised to hear that the total for 4 people was close to $60.  In&Out still wins.. hands down!

Check this place out if you're in the area so you can say that you atleast tried it."}
{"text":"Got the double stack burger with cheese fries and peanut butter shake. Burger is juicy and tasty, a bit on the salty side though. Crinkle cut fries with melted cheese on top were really good. Peanut butter shake if you are a peanut butter fan is on point delicious. Overall good experience but if you're comparing to in-n-out burgers it's not even close. In-n-out has just as good/probably better taste, at a third of the price. Fries and shakes here though are way better and mop the floor with in-n-out, but yet again at double the price."}
{"text":"This was the third burger I had from the strip during my stay and it wasn't the best in flavor but it was the overall most satisfying.

The location and venue is great.  Service was great and the staff friendly.

Burger - way too salty, and the meat too greasy. Other then that it was a good burger.

Fries - cold and pre frozen.  We were excited to try some fresh cut fries and were disappointed when they came out. 

Burger was 8$ and fries were 3$, which is the cheapest I've seen here.  I say the quality you get for the price is spot on."}
{"text":"Looking forward to this place the whole trip! It didn't dissapoint. It was just as delicious as I remember it being when I first came here. This is definitely a place to visit if you're a foodie!"}
{"text":"Went here after hearing so many great things about shake shack. I got the shake Stack and  cheese fries and my hubby got a Hot dog, Smokeshack and shack lemonade. The burgers were good the dog was good the fries were amazing the lemonade refreshing but non of them were worth the super long lines though I have to say the mushroom on my burger were probably the best I've ever eaten. Service is fast a friendly though."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch here and it was great. The shake stack was really juicy and flavorful. Wished it was a little bigger though. I'll be back to try a concrete next time."}
{"text":"As of late, one of our favorite burger and shane joints. 

The bun is buttery, soft and warm. It adds the perfect amount of texture to the burger without being too much. The burgers are always cooked at a medium well so they're not chewy. 

We always order a salted caramel shake and have never been disappointed. Wish there was a shake shack in Tucson."}
{"text":"Unbelievable burger cooked to perfection.  Perfect service and very fast despite a large crowd of customers.  The shakes, dear lord, the shakes! Thank you Olivia and Cheyenne."}
{"text":"The menu was out of this world!!! The had an Octoberfest menu with every type of festive food you could imagine. The service was stellar and the food was to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"I have officially converted from the West Coast In-N-Out girl to the Shake Shack lover. Honestly, I never enjoyed In-N-Out as much as I did until today... Shake Shack just has a larger taste bud profile than In N Out. The line quickly made its way to the front of the entrance, but it moved very quickly. We waited about 2 1/2 minutes until we ordered.

My boyfriend got the Shake Shack Double and I got the Smoke Shack with their red chili peppers that aren't spicy, but taste a bit sour. Almost like a pickled red pepper. You could smell the Smoked Apple Bacon when the good came. Aesthetically and taste wise, the Shake Shack burgers were so vibrant and so tasty! Even I felt that their fried were much better due to the shape and texture of the fries, the crinkled looking shape. We got the fries that had the red chili peppers, smoked apple bacon and cheese on top. I liked that everything wasn't drenched like animal fries do for in n out.

Prices aren't too bad, our friends liked their burgers a lot outside. Restaurant was quite large and still packed around 3:45 when we arrived. Our party of 4 literally killed our meal. Definitely converted us all. Sorry West Coast x)"}
{"text":"Really good burgers and tasty fries. This place is on point!! The concretes are also excellent. Great location and easy door side parking. Games for the kiddos. It's noisy, but worth it. Come on over!!"}
{"text":"We never had a chance to visit the original in NYC, but we jumped at the chance to try it in Sin City. Bottom line...burger quite tasty...hot and juicy, like In N Out, at three times the cost. Shakes are yummy, fries are meh. Forget about the hot dog...griddled beyond recognition. Would try again."}
{"text":"Great Food & Atmosphere. We met the general manager (Son) and chatted with him a little bit. He was very nice and welcoming. Liked everything about him (except he is a Chiefs fan) and the restaurant! We will definitely be back soon for another amazing burger!"}
{"text":"Came here with my Boy and niece cause it was recommended by my good friend and I have to say HOT DAMN THIS ONE GOOD BURGER!!!  But yes I have to say this is the Best Burger we had ever so far. Even asking the kids they responded with their mouths full Umm mmm The Best... There you have out of the mouths of two picky eaters... Did the price fit the food? I would have to say Yes... Definitely coming back, Promise!!!"}
{"text":"I was very confused of all the hype about shake shack until visiting. I've had \"Inn&Out\" and \"Shake'n'steak\" and \"Freddy's\" and I can say this is definitely as good if not better than the three. We went a few weeks after opening on a Sunday afternoon. The line was out the door but just to the curb. It was a quick line. I ordered a single cheeseburger with a strawberry shake and cheesefries. All of it was delicious. The ch see fried have a liquidy sauce on them but not the strange jello kind you get on nachos at the ball game, much better, liquid gold. Shake was thick and creamy. Burger tasted great, soft bun and yummy sauce. It was very busy but we were able to find seats inside"}
{"text":"It's just a burger..and expensive for something especially compared to the quality and amazingneds of innout. Best thing on the many is the mushroom and burger double stack. But that is $10! West coast burgers win."}
{"text":"Do I dare to say that I prefer Shake Shack over In N Out? 

YES

Ordered the single smokeshack, crinkle fries and the black&white shake. I loved the fact the burger had a nice kick to it, maybe from the cherry pepper or the sauce, but wow, I was pleasantly surprised. BACON! Who doesn't love BACON in there burger. 

Besides the food, the wait was short and I was able to find tables right away. The cashier was super friendly too. 

I'm lactose intolerant but I had to try out the shakes, wasn't a big fan of the black&white but willing to try out more. Lets just say the bathroom was my best friend for the next day !"}
{"text":"My first time eating a shake shack burger and I already want more! Great juicy burger with super delish sauce. I had a burger with a mushroom. Fresh fries are the cherry on the topping!"}
{"text":"Not a big burger lover but when I want one I'll go to Shake Shack! Juicy, not oily or too greasy, fresh toppings and soft bun. Delicious! Fries topped with bacon and cheese complete the meal. 

Also offered are hot dogs, onion rings and shakes! A variety of goodness. 

Summerlin location is very convenient and easier to get to than the strip. Visit them!"}
{"text":"Had to see what all the hype was about this burger joint. Coming from NY I have to say nice touch at locating themselves within the NY NY hotel and casino. When we got there the line was out the door but even though to was a pretty long line it moved fairly quickly. They had someone manning the door and letting people in as the line inside started to go down. And once we got up to the counter every cash registered was being used and you could see all the people proactively working hard.  The cashier who took my order, Donna, could probably tell I had never been there. She was extremely helpful, friendly and even though there was a super long line behind me she was incredibly friendly and full of smiles. She helped me with my order and i have to admit she started off my experience quite well. 

The food itself was pretty good. I tried the shroom burger and it was definitely full of mushrooms. The sauce they put on the burger is very tasty and adds to the burger. We also ordered the bacon burger and it had tons of bacon. They have so many different flavors of shakes. I got a strawberry and it was delicious!!! Not too thick but not too thin..just right. 

Only thing that didn't make it a 5 star visit was that there was no place to sit (inside or outside). It was pretty busy so I'm sure that factored into it but trying to savor and enjoy your lunch while cramped up (half sitting/half standing) kinda takes away from the total experience. The way they are set up I guess doesn't really allow for any other way but maybe one day."}
{"text":"One of the better burgers I've had in a long time.  I'd say top 5.  Has the look of a steak N shake burger.  Thin and grilled.  Fries were awesome.  Crisp and add the cheese to make them complete."}
{"text":"Best veggie burger I've ever had! Definitely not healthy but so good. If you're going to the T-Mobile arena or in the general area it's a great place to eat. Can't wait to see them expand to Southern California."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a late dinner on our last night in Vegas! My friend got me really excited for this burger joint since she said its only found in the east coast and that the burgers are really good. Unlike the Shake Shacks in New York, my friend said this location is huge and really nice! Fortunately, there was no wait what so ever and barely anyone inside since we came in pretty late, around 11PM. I ordered the Shack Stack burger and a  hot chocolate with sea salt. Our buzzers rang not too long after we ordered and we went to the counter to grab our burgers. The burgers are not that big but it was really tasty, especially with that fried mushroom in there. The fried mushroom gave  the burger a nice crispiness and I really enjoyed the flavor of the overall burger. I tried my friend's cheese fries and that was just ok since Im not a fan of crinkle fries. The hot chocolate was really good but very rich. If you don't have a sweet tooth like me, then it may be too sweet and thick for you. It was overall a very satisfying meal! :) Glad I finally got to try Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"It was really tasty. The fries with bacon and cheese-I appreciated how the bacon was so crispy. I say (my preference) Shake Shack is way better than in and out burger I don't think I'll ever go to in and out burger again. Shake shack is the best burgers ever! Thank you LAS VEGAS NYNY for having it!"}
{"text":"Well since the last review I can definitely say after the latest back to back Vegas trips that I am a fan for life now and has even left my body with the shakes, but perhaps if it gets bad enough I'll make the trip to LA and get the shack experience there to see if it holds a candle to this gem of the newly further renovated Park area.

I realized that the burger here just didn't cut it for me as stated in the last review and since I have started to try and eat healthier, this go round I gave a try to their chicken shack sandwich and damned if I didn't find my \"go-to\" here. 

It thankfully still comes with the soft buttery hamburger buns that I believe are the best around bar none. I even did take a liking to the lettuce and pickle that is rounding out the lower half of the sandwich and the wife can attest to the fact that I don't ever order burgers with greens (I'd like to think it hides the true taste of the beef and cheese). Ha-ha! Speaking of that, I do feel like I'm able to \"overindulge\" a bit with being able to upgrade the sandwich as I incorporated bacon and cheese which I'm sure brought the calorie count of the plain version up considerably (well you only live once). The coup de gras for me was the chicken breast itself. It was consistently massive in size and juicy from beginning to end. I found it to be less batter heavy and it kept a crunchy texture that just sent it to another level of cluckery goodness (if it wasn't so good I'd care about using the word cluckery). =OP

I admit too over the years since this has been put out on the strip it has certainly grown in popularity. Gee that almost sounds like another East Coast chain that has made its way to the West Coast (*cough* Inn N' Out), but with quality food like this being shelled out it will be a contender for quite some time!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack is here! And. About. Fricking. Time!  I've been looking forward to this location opening for the longest time. And already I've eaten here 4 times in my 2 trips to Vegas this month. 

The first time my friend told me about Shake Shack, I was in disbelieve when he told me he thought the burgers at SS tasted better than In-N-Out. We're both In-N-Out faithfuls (and SoCal residents) so to hear this came as a bit of a shock and disbelief. And then I tried Shake Shack last year in Boston for the first time. And I was an instant fan. Since then, I've been craving Shake Shack for countless months and now it's only hours away in the West Coast! 

Is Shake Shack truly better than In-N-Out? That will always be the big debate for Californians.  I would have to say yes (*gasp!) but it also depends on what you're basing it on.  For overall value, quality, fries, and those toasted buns, In-N-Out wins.  But for overall flavor and the taste of the meat, Shake Shack truly shines. And aren't the elements of a good hamburger judged on the quality and flavor of the meat patty, anyway? And their shakes are also just as delicious. They're thick, but you can still manage to easily suck through the straw without getting a hangover.

First timers, try the original ShackBurger to start your In-N-Out comparisons.  For those that want a kick in flavor, get the SmokeShack burger.  But my current favorite is the new ShackMeister with onion strings. It's full of flavor and absolutely delicious. Pair it with crinkle cut fries and a Red Velvet Shake, and life is complete. Enjoy."}
{"text":"First time here  very clean and fun environment. As I walked in further I seen the wide selection of burgers and shakes. Excited to try them all. I made my choice and it was amazing nice and juicy full of flavor. The manager Derek was an amazing host . Will definitely be back ."}
{"text":"Went to the Shake Shack at the District today. Went to help raise money for the Coronado HS Robotics Club because I was told the Club would be getting half the dollars spent there today.

To support the club's fundraiser, I bought both \"eat in\" and \"take out\" for my entire family.  See my receipt, below.  We ate quickly, then my son went to the cashier because he forgot to mention to her our purchase was for the CHS Robotics Club fund raiser.  No problem, right? Wrong!

When told, the cashier looked at her cash register, then looked like she did not know what to do. Then she said she needed to talk with someone in the back and left. Moments later (not minutes later), she returned, apologized, and told us \"it was too late\", but we could make a new purchase if we wanted.  Seriously?  Like you couldn't just void our transaction and re-ring it?  

I shelled out $40 with NOTHING going to the Club's fundraiser? Sure, my son messed up by forgetting to say something when he ordered, but it wasn't a case of \"couldn't be fixed\", it was one of \"wouldn't be fixed\".  So I get shaken down by Shake Shack for $20 that reasonably could have gone to the CHS Robotics Club.  

Shame on Shake Shack and bye bye to my good will & future patronage too!

PS: The chicken sandwich, though tasty, was too salty."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The meal I had was bomb! I had the shack stack with fries and a strawberry shake. First bite of the burger, cheese exploded and melted all over my hand. You know when burger places have picture ads of the burger and it looks all perfect but when you order it, it's all flat and doesn't look like the picture. After eating my meal me and my friends saw the poster for shake stack and the burger look exactly like the ones we had. Haha very good. Pretty pricey for a burger place, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I really like the Shake Shack I had in NYC. I thought I would like this location in Vegas as well. Between the fries, ice tea and shroom burger, my total came to 13+ change. After living in CA with all the amazing fresh selections for burgers - I find Shake Shack to be pricey compared to other gourmet burger joints I've been to.  The fries seemed to be over fried. They were too crunchy where there wasn't much moist potatoes inside to taste. Thought I liked the shroom burger before but this time it just tastes like a over fried mushroom with cheese. The shake my nephew got was tasty but nothing different or spectacular.  Ehhhhh... Don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  

Looks likes Shake Shack, smells like Shake Shack....but definitely not the Shake Shack of NY.  The one major difference about this location, is there was plenty of seating available....even for large groups.  

The reason I came to check this place out is because I loved the burgers and shakes when I visited their NY location.  

I had a totally different experience here in Las Vegas.  The bun on my burger was smashed and the fries were lukewarm.  However, I am giving this place an extra star because of the great tasting chocolate shake!  It was the only thing that saved the meal."}
{"text":"I made the trek out here to be able to cross this off my food adventure list and let me tell you it definitely was worth it. The ordering process and menu were easy to navigate. Shake shack gives many options for burger and hotdog lovers. The fries were perfectly fluffy and crisp something that can be butchered too often with the crinkle variation. People tend to compare this place to In-N-Out but to me they are on opposite ends of the spectrum. At first glance i found this place to be quite pricey but the quality of food soften that blow. Everything my party got lived up to its menu description. We will be making this a vegas go to for sure!"}
{"text":"Great shakes and decent burgers at a good price! I still prefer the burgers back home, but this is a great option if you are in Vegas.

* UPDATE* Changed my review from a 3 to 4 Star because that peanut butter shake is amazeballs."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Shake Shack in NYC for quite some time. When I discovered there was one in Las Vegas and we were going to be there en route of a trip, I made a special point of stopping in.

Burger was perfect in size and juicy; bun a soft, yeast bread pillow to soak up the patty grease; toppings fresh, crisp, and plenty how I like it.

Fries had a good crunch for crinkle fries (I'm more familiar with the softer version and don't care for it) and topped with the cheese sauce made it even better.

Concrete didn't live up to expectations though. I ordered a small create your own to share considering everything else we ordered. The menu concretes had too many mix-ins for my taste so I went simple vanilla frozen custard with chocolate truffle cookie dough. The latter was very rich, too rich for me.

A table is quite hard to come by during lunch. A number of us were kind of hovering, surveying the tables, and anxiously waiting for people to leave so we could swoop in. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.

Hope they bring Shake Shack to the Bay Area soon!"}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying Shake Shack. Now am kicking myself for waiting so long only because the first location has been in Vegas for some time. Once I heard about there second location in Downtown Summerllin. Hell yay! 

I came for lunch. First impression was loving the whole look of the place from the minute walking to the restaurant. I love the outdoor patio area. Not only because it nice size, great place to people watch, chill, and hang out with friends enjoy the weather. The menu is pretty huge especially for my first time. The staff in the restaurant the whole time was simply awesome. The gentlemen taking my order explained everything well the whole concept of Shake Shack and gave me great recommendations. I ended up ordering the SmokeShack burger. I went double on the recommendation. Talk about mouth watering and tasty burger!!!! If your hungry not doubt would highly recommend going double. Single is decent size but I feel with the double the smoked bacon, cherry peppers, cheese, and sauce get the full burger experience! The burgers cooked perfect nice and juicy. Fresh. The fries was going cheese fries but the first time just wanted taste the fries. They were awesome. I enjoy the fact that the crinkle cut fries not your straight cut. It adds different texture and can only imagine put mound of cheese sauce on it settles nicely on top. The fries were nice and HOT. 

Not only burgers they offer even have a vegetarian style burger, chicken, and more. The shakes need come back try my next visit. Concretes just reading the descriptions sound tasty. The drinks talk about diversity. Burger joint with different daily fresh lemonades. I love it. Selection of beers on tap not just your bland mass market ones but quality micro choices. Wines. More and more. The diversity is pretty awesome and really something for anyone here at Shake Shack. 

The service was awesome. The gentleman taking my order mention earlier answered all my questions being first time great. Positive vibe, friendly, and next thing know talking about endurance sports. Even when I was sitting down couple different workers checked see how everything was going they had that same positive happy go vibe. One of them asked if needed refill on my soda. They have no fountain machine out front. 

Shake Shack another great addition to Downtown Summerlin food scene. One that will be coming back again soon....."}
{"text":"Just OK. my boyfriend and I ordered the shack burger and mushroom burger and the only thing we fell in love with was the cheese fries and the cheese inside of the burgers. The line wasn't too long but seating is tough because they're always crowded. Other than that, I believe in n out across the street would've been a better choice."}
{"text":"First off, I walked all the way over here from Treasure Island. That's roughly a 30 minute walk and I have to say, it was well worth it! I love the layout of the store and the sign is very nice. Very easy to spot.
When you walk in, you can easily read the menu on their wall, but they also give you smaller ones if you want to look at it. I got in line and knew immediately what I wanted. I got to try the Shack Stack. I split it with my boyfriend and half a burger filled me up, and I have a huge stomach! It was delicious! The cheese oozed out and the mushroom perfectly complimented the burger. It was pricey, but so worth it!
It definitely hit the top of my list of burgers. The fries are also really good here! They are perfectly crispy which doesn't happen with crinkle cut fries. I loved it! I want to come back for a custard or concrete one day! I will definitely make this a regular stop when I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Shake shack... You were amazing!! Okay so my boyfriend and I both ordered The SmokeShack burger that has bacon inside. It was delish! For the price of the burger.. I think the size of the burger should be bigger but all in all the burger was delicious regardless! We also got the Shack-cago hotdog, good as well! But... It did come with a pepper on there that I swear was hotter than a jalapeño but still good! 

The ambiance of the restaurant is very hipster and modern.. The lines are always long BUT it goes by fast since they have about 4 cashiers working at once taking orders. Great place!"}
{"text":"So much hype and excitement over Shake Shack + happening by when there wasn't a huge line meant dinner time. Three of us got 3 single burgers, 3 orders of fries, 2 milk shakes and a fountain drink and the bill was almost $50. I don't mind paying that somewhere like Bachi Burger, but these fast-food style offerings were definitely overpriced. The food was good, not memorable, but good. The seasonal gingerbread milkshake I had was very good. If I was on the strip and looking for a burger I would go to Fukuburger or Bobby's Burger Palace...and then swing by Shake Shack for a milkshake."}
{"text":"The hamburgers are nothing special. The cheese fries make it all better. They must put something addictive into the cheese sauce because I want to put it on everything. The shakes are delicious -- I recommend getting it extra thick -- and its creamy enough where you don't need the extra whip cream. For four people expect to pay around $55.00 (this included two young girls and a grown man and woman.)"}
{"text":"I've only been to locations on the east coast, so I was pretty excited to try this one in Scottsdale! I love frozen custard and was craving something chocolate-y after spending the day walking around, and the \"shake attack\" definitely fit the bill - chocolate custard with chocolate cookie/brownie bits and chocolate sprinkles.. I don't think I've eaten that much chocolate in a few years!! 
I'm not the biggest chocolate lover by any means, but this was perfect.. and perfect for the hotter weather we've been starting to experience!  In a previous visit I've also tried their burgers and \"black and white\" shake, which were also delicious :) 
I might've liked everything simply because it is a bit of a novelty, since shake shack isn't located in many places out west, but I'll buy into the gimmick :) Try their custard for sure tho, or their shakes.. definitely worth the calories and time in line!"}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack! The chicken sandwich is off the chain. The fries  are awesome too! I wish they had ranch for the fries. But the fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"I am a huge Shake Shack fan and I was actually planning on moving out of Charlotte until I saw that they were opening one here. The food is great! The line can be a little long but that's to be expected with such a great restaurant. I do have one major complaint though... I didn't really care for the conversation happening between the young ladies ahead of me in line. These girls are having some serious relationship problems with their loser boyfriends. I don't know if it's like a weird daddy issues situation or if they just have low self esteem but they either need to get their personal lives in order or KEEP THEIR DRAMA OUT OF SHAKE SHACK! Save that nonsense for Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"This place is hoppin! Every time I come in here, it's lively and lots going on. Workers are buzzing around doing various duties which tells me that it's a fan favorite. 

I mean, if upbeat, friendly, and fun is your thing, this is the spot. Food is served quickly and with a smile. 

Enjoy the inside but the Golden Knights arena is just outside along with the T-Mobile arena so nights during these events will be extra poppin'."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was pretty good. I really liked the chicken sandwich, the double bacon cheeseburger and the cheese fries. The strawberry shake was simple and delicious. The staff was helpful and friendly. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The line wrapped around the building Saturday when we tried to go so we waited and went back today. There was still a line but it moved quick and staff were on point keeping things going and making sure people had places to sit. Food was awesome and it was definitely worth the drive back. Can't wait to try something new next time!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! My family and I went there the day after thanksgiving knowing yes it will be busy and we completely understand and don't mind waiting.  After waiting for 7 burgers and 4 fries for 1 hour and 15 mins we decided to go check on what the status of our food was.  Turns out they NEVER  put our order in!!!! What was more disturbing was as my brother and sister is standing there talking to the manager an order of 9 burgers and 6 fries and 12 numbers after us was ready.  We never once received an apology from this so called manager so we ended up getting a refund on our order.  NEVER again will I set foot into to place and I will make sure all my friends and family know what kind of customer service this place offers.  I've been a manager for almost half my life and I would never treat my customers this way."}
{"text":"This is my first Shake shack experience. When I first walked in there was a nice lady there assisting people in line, which is a good idea since many like myself are first timers. The menu seemed overwhelming at first but I just ordered a simple single stack burger. I'm not a fancy burger person so I don't like all these crazy toppings on my burger. I like good meat and a solid bun along with tomatoes and lettuce. 

The staff seemed very efficient and they have a good system when it came to refills. They have a lot of drink options. They also came around and checked on us made sure everything was ok. I saw them constantly wiping the communal areas and continuously restocking. 

The food itself was just ok to me. The burger was good but nothing amazing. Their buns were delicious though. The fries i don't know what it is about crinkle cut fries but I do not like them. They recommended the cheese fries and it didn't do anything for me. I actually wished i got regular fries in stead. I probably will give this another try."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a medium rare burger and fries !!! Don't leave out a shake....it will be hard to walk after...or gamble. Eat on my friends."}
{"text":"So we found out there's another new outlet that just opened and we went to check it out. I'm not sure why the reviews are lower for this one but I think the food they brought out were the same quality as the ones in NY NY. Just as delicious. If anything it's LESS CROWDED, which means FASTER SERVICE. It's a bit smaller but I love the ambience here, thus the 5 stars. 

Since this is our 2nd time around, we went easy. Lol! Shake Stack, double shack burger with fried shallots, normal fries and cheese fries. Of course we forgot to get their famous shakes! Bummer! There's always next time! Until then, we will be missing you!!!!"}
{"text":"Going with the hype and ... *drumroll!!!* it's was yummmmmmmay! Super soft potato buns, tasty meat patty and all the works made it delicious. My only complain is that the burgers are tiny. But NO PROBLEM! Just get more burgers! Lol! My favorite item on the menu is the crinkled fries. Yes, I can fry some at home but inner I won't be able to replicate it. With OR without cheese. Both are good. I think I liked the fries more than the burger! 

We here's what we got ( I'm attaching the menu so you can see what they are) :

Shack stack! 
Roadside shack
Double Shackburger with fried shallot and extra shack shake sauce. 
Smoke shack
Hamburger
Shack attack concrete
Half and half (lemonade and tea) 

Close to $60 bucks! OUCH! but hey, for a first visit, it calls for a celebration!"}
{"text":"Not sure why there's so much hype with this place but it's mediocre at best and pricey for sure. 2 hot dogs, 1 cheese fries and 1 shake was nearly 20 bucks! And aside from the shake, the food wasn't good at all. The hot dogs are tiny and taste about as good as grocery store microwavable dogs. The cheese fries were just a handful of crinkle cut fries, aka frozen, with some nacho cheese on top...expected more from a place with this much hype

If you come here, I'd only recommend getting a shake and not any of their food. It's not good at all and you'd just be wasting your money. Definitely overrated. For much better hot dogs for a fraction of the price, you might as well go to Costco across the street"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers that I've had. I had the Shack Stack which had a breaded portabello mushroom cap over on top of the burger and it was delicious.  The burgers are pricey, but it's worth it.  The cheese fries are yummy too.  You can ask for the cheese sauce on the side, if you don't want soggy fries.  I got a chocolate shake and I think they use dark chocolate, so if you like dark chocolate, you will like the shake.  Definitely will go there again."}
{"text":"Single burgers are pretty average size or smaller for a HIGH price but decent tasty. Fries were ok. Very spacious and lots of tables with TVs. Staff was friendly and informative. I want to try their shakes next and also bring my pooch since they have a dog friendly patio & menu. I will give them another try soon. Again, it's an alright place but just way over priced!!! $38 for 3 single burgers & 3 fries & 2 drinks???"}
{"text":"Why go back east when you have Shake Shake in Vegas? 4star  because of that insane wait on this particular location. West coasters will kill me for this bold but true statement but shake shack is hands down better than In N Out. I don't care what they say about the fresh fries, never frozen burgers but there's something about having those burgers unattainable in the Bay that makes me wanting it. Their patties are soft, flavorful, and their shroom burger so juicy and crunchy. I will pick Shake Shack over any fast food anytime."}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch on a weekday... We were lucky that there was only a short line ahead of us. But the dining area remained full throughout our time here. 

Casual environment. You order/pay at the counter, given a light thingy, pick up your food at the counter when it's ready..

Service here is great, friendly guys at the counter, and other employees checking on the dining room. 

The burgers were delicious!!! I got their cheeseburger (added bacon), and hubby got their shack stack... The patty is so juicy and flavorful. The shack stack is a bit bigger. But my cheeseburger was a medium size, not that small, but not that big either. I was able to kill it. Haha the breaded mushroom on the shack stack is amazing. Great mushroom flavor with a little extra crunch and flavor from the breading. 

Yes, I also ordered their version of a Chicago dog to try.. When in Vegas, right?? The flavor was great, but I did have some problems... The bun was too weak to support all the goodness, and it broke as soon as I tried to lift up the hot dog. Had to use a knife and fork... Also, the hot dog itself actually tasted a bit tough. Not buttery or juicy. Sigh!

Their crinkle cut fries were nice and crunchy.  Hubby ordered his fries with cheese, but you could probably do without, bc everything else is so rich and savory (and likely also with cheese), the cheese on the fries actually got overpowered! 

They also have frozen custard and shakes. We asked for a \"Neapolitan\", which they were able to make. Nice and creamy. Good flavor. 

Prices are alright, not to extreme, it's a more affordable meal on the strip. 

Yum!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place time and time again, finally had a chance to stop by and grab a bite.  We got there a little before noon on a Sunday and of course it was packed with everyone grabbing food before the long drive to wherever they came from.  We were in the first row to the door outside, but the line went by pretty quickly (10 mins or so).  That was about the only thing that was quick about this place... 

We ordered 2 shack burgers, fries, and a strawberry lemonade.  Total came out to about $17 or so?  We went to sit down with our pager and......20 minutes later, we FINALLY got our food.  You would think with all the people there, they would be a little quicker and just have burgers on the grill nonstop.  I thought going to In-n-out was bad...this place is worse -_-.

We finally got buzzed, and the guy was totally confused with the orders.  He took one persons buzzer, and then my buzzer...and then someone elses buzzer.... and then.....didnt know whos order was whos.  This added to my frustration for the food taking so long.  Not to mention, the place was a complete mess from all the people there.  May not be their fault completely, but the left corner has a horrible set up.  There is only one way in and out of that area....and you constantly have people going in and out to get their food/drinks/exit.  

Food was alright...burgers were pretty small compared to other places.  The patty itself was salty.  Fries were good, but hard to mess up on that.  Lemonde was good!

Overall, I may or may not be back... maybe will give it one more shot, but price and taste wise...In-n-out may be the winner..."}
{"text":"I'm not sorry to say its very over hyped burger spot. I felt sick when I left maybe it was the sauce. The fries were nothing more than save a lot fries. For the price 33.48$  I could have gotten 2 burgers form 5 guys. Save your money."}
{"text":"Love love loved!

I had fries & a shake! I opt out of a burger BUT I did have a bite & it was the most amazing burger! By far my favorite!!! Will definitely be back!

Customer service was FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"ShakeShack is located on the strip at the New York New York Hotel.

When you walk in, seats are first come first serve. They have seating available inside and outside. But trust me those seats fill up fast~! So I suggest you grab your seats then have someone go up and order for everyone.  

The menu has a nice variety of stuff. They got burgers, hotdogs, fries, shakes and booze.

The Grub. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shake-shack-las-vegas-2?select=-px6rl72eM0-ch_hiPUcIg

[[ SHROOM BURGER $6.99 ]] (Vegetarian) Fried portabella mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheese, topped with lettuce, tomato and shacksauce. 

[[ DOUBLE SHACK BURGER $7.99 ]] 100% angus beef topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato and shacksauce. 

[[ CHEESE FRIES $3.95 ]] These fries are covered with a blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce.

Overall: The shroom burger was alright, I definitely liked the double cheeseburger more! And those cheese fries your delish too!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite quick spots to eat in Vegas every time I come they never let me down I recommend eating here it's good wish there was one in Washington you guys need to open a store there"}
{"text":"A few disclaimers before I start, I think In-N-Out is the standard which every burger should be held to and I also think Red Robin is 95% disgusting.

With that, I find Shake Shack pretty darn delicious. I think they are overpriced - but this doesn't mean I won't pay the price. They are, as the three star review on yelp is appropriately titled, \"A-OK.\" I'll go back with groups, but if I am looking for a delicious burger lunch or dinner I'll skip this joint for a double cheeseburger at In-N-Out everyday. I only had their oatmeal pie milkshake but it too wasn't spectacular. Good - not great. 

I think I am only so hard on this restaurant because everyone discusses it like the epitome of what a burger should be - um hardly. The SmokeShack burger is delicious but not worth ten dollars for a double. The cheese on their cheese fries is nacho style which is good for a few fries but ends up making you want regular fries by the end of it. 

I will say this burger blows Red Robin out of the water for the same price. But at least at Red Robin you get some atmosphere and a waiter/waitress. 

I'll be back, but I'm sure I won't be a regular. Meh."}
{"text":"It's a must for me to come here every time I visit Vegas!

Food: I had the ShackBurger, Fries, and a Strawberry and Chocolate shake (separately, but bought both haha). The ShackBurger's bun is soft and moist! I love the bread they use. The patty itself is juicy, and you can definitely taste all that seasoning it's great! The vegetables they use taste fresh, and the fries always taste like they're fresh out of the oven! The strawberry shake is by far the best shake for me out of the OG 3 (Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry). The strawberry was not too sweet or sour, and it was so creamy. It reminded me of Breyer's strawberry ice cream's distinct taste. I'm not putting chocolate or vanilla down in any sort of way. Honestly, the chocolate was like each chocolate ice cream from Dreyers or Ben and Jerry's -- I loved their shake. 

Service: Nice and orderly! After ordering, you get a buzzer and you wait at a table until they call you up. 

My one tiny tiny miniscule complaint is that the bathrooms only have 2 stalls.. merp. 

Will come back again when I visit Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced hamburgers!

OK I've heard about it and I wanted to give them a try.
BUT!
It's ridiculous what they charge for a hamburger here.
Everything is a-la-carte

I'll keep with my favorite, In N Out Burger 
Half the price

I'm not impressed"}
{"text":"I order my usual shackburger and fries and it was delicious as usual. I added a chocolate shake today and it is SO good. It has a rich chocolate taste to it. The only con about this place is the price."}
{"text":"For the price, this seemed way too hyped up for what we received. 

Was it delicious? Yes. 
Was it $5+ per burger delicious? No.
Was the $5+ shake worth the $5? No. It was so small! 

So, keep in mind I'm an In-N-Out girl. Cheap and true American burgers. I can get out for just over $10 for two people, but here... the two burgers cost much more than that.

I will have to say their bun = amazing. The patty was great and unlike In-N-Out you can customize your burger more + add in more condiments and additional toppings (if you're into that).

But the size of the food + price of it (really, that's all the fries I get?)... I just felt underwhemed for what I ended up paying."}
{"text":"My girl and I were eager to try out the new location away from the strip, only to get sick about 30mins after we ate our burgers. Food tasted great while we were eating, however the pain after was not so good.

We might give this location another try later on."}
{"text":"I would say it's overrated, but the burgers are definitely good but not great. Love the cheese fry's!"}
{"text":"Finally got to get Shake Shack after hearing about it for soooo long. 
Is it worth? YES.
Is it worth a second time during the same trip? Maybe not. 
Burgers were super yummy and I loved the fries. 

I guess it's... better than In-N-Out? But I would NEVER give up In-N-Out for this. Yummy burgers are found here and there, and Shake Shack definitely feels replaceable.

So, yes. It's super yummy! Come here for a great burger."}
{"text":"Burgers were on point. Compared to the one off the Vegas strip which can be hit or  miss at best. Service was excellent and table areas were very clean. Good management, good experience."}
{"text":"The size of the burger is a good amount to go with the fries. Surprisingly I got full and couldn't even finish my fries. This place is so good, I'm craving more!"}
{"text":"My first experience with Shake Shack and I was not disappointed!! I think we got there earlier than the dinner crowd so we didn't have to wait too long to order -- it was nice though because we were given a menu while we inched our way up closer to the cashier. A big plus for me about the menu was they show how many calories every item on the menu was! How awesome! We ordered a Smoke Shack, a 'Shroom Burger, a side of cheese fries and vanilla concrete with caramel mixed in. Maaaaaaan... that 'Shroom Burger!! A fried portabello mushroom filled with cheddar and muenster cheese --- this thing was HOT! There was even a \"Caution\" sticker on it! Every single bite of this burger led to oozy cheese pouring out -- it was amazing!! The cheese fries were nothing special but if you like cheez whizzy-type of cheese fries, you'll be happy... like I was. The concrete we got was really delicious -- thick, creamy and simple. You can't beat that! I wish there was a Shake Shack in Dallas/Fort Worth... but maybe it's a good thing there isn't one. I'd probably be there too much..."}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located right in front of NY NY. It is steps from where I was staying in Excalibur. Being a CA native, I wanted to see how this place compares to our beloved In n Out. When I was in Vegas in June, I decided to put it to the test. I ordered their shack burger, their hot chicken sandwich, and cheese fries. By the end of our weekend in Vegas, we had gone three times to this place! The hot chicken was the star of the show. The breading was delicious and flavorful. Not too hot, but with actual spice to it. The slaw on top was also good. I usually hate slaw as it is full of mayo. This one had what seemed like chipotle or paprika, making it pink in color. No overwhelming mayo flavor. In fact, it complimented nicely with the sandwich. However, the bun was ice cold? I would think it would be toasted. My chicken was fine, but the bun was soggy and cold. Real let down, but still delicious

The burger has NOTHING on In n Out. Trust me. However, it was still pretty tasty. This bun was also ice cold. What is up with that Shake Shack? Toast your buns!! Your meat was juicy and flavorful. The burger was topped with lettuce, cheese, and a couple tiny tomato slices. I advice putting full size slices of tomato and adding some onion to your burgers. Moreover, no sauce? At least some ketchup on top would do a world of good. You have to do more if you want to compare with In n Out's burger with lettuce, big tomatoes, onion, and secret sauce. I do appreciate how fresh and juicy the meat was, so I still give it a good review.

The cheese fries were crinkle cut with a liquid cheese sauce. It tasted a little plasticky for my liking. The next times I went I ordered plain fries dipped in ketchup. They were delicious. Nice amount of salt and cooked just right. Sometimes In n Out overcooks their fries, so this was nice to see. 

When we went back, I ordered the hot chicken sandwich again and a root beer float. The custard they have here is amazing. Creamy and rich. On a triple digit summer Vegas day, this so hit the spot.

TL;DR order their hot chicken sandwich and fries. Just make sure you remind them to toast their buns! 

Will no doubt be back every time I am in Vegas until they do away with their hot chicken!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to visit this new location, at Green Valley Ranch. So close to Lifetime, just hop on for lunch after yoga class. 

You can expect the consistent quality from Shake Shack everywhere. But one thing stand out about this location is how they are clean and spotless. If you are in a hurry, order through their Apps and just come to pick it up. Fast, convenient and efficient. 

I love their original cheeseburger but my favorite is their mushroom burger!! Out of this world! I can eat it everyday if I can. Strawberry mint is also my favorite drink! So refreshing."}
{"text":"The Shake Shack started as a food cart in Manhattan just over 10 years ago. Now there are over 60 locations across the U.S. This is the Valley's first location. I have been to ones in both Boston and Chicago and have had mixed reviews. I thought I'd wait a few weeks after their opening to dine here. The service definitely wasn't up to par. The server never smiled and looked very unhappy to be working here. He messed up twice placing my order and each time had to walk away to get a manager key (I was overcharged an extra sandwich). This place is pretty pricey. 2 chicken sandwiches, 2 shakes and an order of fries came to just under $30. My son mentioned the bathroom was trashed (his words). My positive is that the food came out relatively quick and was pretty good. The chicken was still pretty hot and tender. The fries are mediocre but the shakes are really tasty. The restaurant itself is nice looking with indoor and outdoor seating. It wasn't too busy when we got here (Monday night), but I hear the lines can be pretty long on busy days. Thumbs up on food and speed, thumbs down on price and service."}
{"text":"I've been craving Shake Shack since I last visited New York! So happy they opened one on the west coast! 

This place is located outside, on the strip infront of the NYNY Hotel (of course). The place is obviously new, but it was really well kept inside and the workers were the friendliest!! I had a chick named Inez ring me up and she was the best! I had this for my last meal in Vegas and I wanted to take some back home for my family. She insisted I eat my food first and when I'm ready for my to-go orders to come right back up to her instead of waiting in line. I thought it was really nice of her. Not only that but the other workers were friendly too, they clean your table, and even offer you refills on your drink. 

Okay, but back to food. The Shack burger was exactly how I remembered it! So delicious. I had the Stack Burger this time and that deep fried mushroom in the middle. You take that first bite and the cheese oozes out. OH. MY. GOD. So freakin' bomb! The cheese fries and the strawberry milkshake was on point too.

Man, I'm craving Shake Shack again! I love this place. You get amazing food without the rude, fast paced environment of New York!  Until we meet again..."}
{"text":"Slooooow. Super slow. Went twice, had to wait for 25 minutes for a simple burger. And the lines weren't even long. Mismanagement all along. Plus the burgers are ok, but far from great."}
{"text":"My friends and I were really stoked when we found out that they had opened a Shake Shack in Vegas. No more going all the wayyy to the East Coast for this anymore! Yay!!

Sadly, this Shake Shack was nothing compared to the one I had in NYC. Both my friend and I was hyping it up so much to our other friends. However, after we took a couple bites of our burgers... we just sat there in despair. The burger turned out to be very disappointing. My friend looked like she was about to cry. I also wasn't told that the burger was gonna be rare/medium rare. I didn't think it would be that bad, and the line was kinda ridiculous so I just ate my burger anyway. Of course I had a little date with the bathroom after the meal............

In this case, In N Out totally kicks Shake Shack out of the ball park! In N Out is the same everywhere, and their prices are UNBEATABLE! The burger here was $5+ for a reg. cheeseburger. Fries came separately too. And a drink... you're looking at $16 for a meal you can get an In N Out for about $7. Uhmmmmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Best veggie burger AND fries I've ever had! Line was long but moved quickly. Burgers aren't huge, but they're still filling and taste AMAZING! Got the Shroom Burger stuffed with Muenster cheese, soooo good."}
{"text":"I cannot wait for this to come to STL. The location is great. They have a wonderful \"front yard\" and a porch with a ping pong table. The staff was friendly and our food was very good. I was especially happy with the chocolate shake I got. 

Within 3 months of the location opening at home where I live, I am certain that I will have gained 15 pounds :)"}
{"text":"As a preface, I don't have a ton of friends, so most of my dinners are had alone, but if any internet strangers want to go eat, just send me a message! (Half-Kidding). Trying to now be consistent about reviews, I'll break them down by: Cost, Service, Ambience, Food/Drink, Random Thoughts.

Cost: $10-$20

Service: There are lines. Wow. Now you may be saying, gosh Mike, obviously. The most popular east coast burger chain just opened on the single busiest street in the world...I understand that, but I guess when I knew they were opening on a corner spot on the Strip I figured they would have MORE THAN FOUR CASHIERS. I went to the smallest Shake Shack in NYC and they still had 3 cashiers...

Ambience: It's fine. Seating is hard to find sometimes but it seems that they have a patio that will open up during summer which will be fun! They also have the silly roulette themed lights, which I guess add to the décor but are in all honesty probably a waste of money. 

Food: Burgers are great, charred and super! Fries are great especially with cheese. I thought the hot dogs were underwhelming and lacking the \"snap\" the you associate with a great hot dog. The main selling point for me has always been the Concretes. The two Vegas ones are great, but anytime you can add cheesecake bites, chocolate, cookie dough, or whatever else into some delicious custard, you got a recipe for hitting a jackpot! (HA! A bad pun!). They also have a \"C\" line for cold items which will be really solid when the temps hit 100.

Random: There is no casino entrance. I thought it may be more efficient to park at the Monte Carlo and cross the strip that way than parking at the NYNY and walking through the entire casino. Just food for thought."}
{"text":"Ok.  So, I can see what all the hubbub is about as the original location in New York has such a storied history and loyal following.  Us Phoenicians are fortunate enough to be included in the Shack's aggressive expansion beyond the Big Apple.  I know our Arizona locations will never be like the New York institution, but for many, Shake Shack would only exist, in legend, if it were not for the two new locations in the Valley.

Burgers, much like Mexican food, are so subjective as a food item because of the myriad of regional variables in included ingredients, the specified styles of preparation and presentation - not to mention the bun can make, or break, a burger.  Therefore, it stands to reason that many feel that a Shake Shack Burger is a tasty interpretation of the fundamental American burger.  Although I agree that Shack burgers are tasty, they are not necessarily the guilty indulgence offered up by other establishments. 

Shake Shack does make an appetizing burger, yet I do not find myself not salivating over the thought or mention of any of their burgers, nor do I see myself making a special trip just for a burger, fries and beer.  The ShackBurger, SmokeShack and 'Shroom Burger all have flavor, but not the Pavlov inducing, bacon crunching, cheese oozing, crispy, saucy, deliciousness of burgers that can be found elsewhere.  I do, however, have a more positive opinion of their custard, shakes and concretes.  

Because of the evident quality of Shake Shack's dairy desserts and their creaminess, which tastes as though it is devoid of thickeners or stabilizers (I hope), has caused me to vacillate on my star rating, and thusly has increased my final rating because of my positive dairy experiences here.

Shake Shack will not necessarily disappoint any patrons with its food, but it will not Wow them either.  Outstanding customer service would elevate the entire Shack experience as well as the perceived taste of the food, resulting in overall higher ratings and return visits.  Frankly, I am surprised that there is not a more aggressive training program to foster a Shake Shack Culture with its employees.

Although nothing specific was ever amiss on each of my visits, I have not experienced an enthusiastic greeting, witnessed a gleaming smile, genuinely felt welcome or felt a passionate adoration for working at The Shack by its employees.  Whereas I have, unexpectedly, experienced these things at other establishments - and some of those have drive-thrus - chalk one up to insightful HR departments for creating a dining culture that shows in the customer experience; the Shack and Arizona could certainly use more of it.

Shake Shack has created a niche without filling an existing need, and in doing so, it is trying to fill that need through its own proclamation of hospitality and community.  So long as their expansion is not too aggressive, I know Shake Shack will be successful; it is already regarded as an institution in New York, which the founders have set out to create, and have been seemingly successful.  Given the initial Valley locations and the Shack's trendy, socially/environmentally charged atmosphere which melds well with both the Uptown Phoenix corridor and the trendy Scottsdale shopping neighborhoods, Shake Shack will appeal to these specific and socially astute socioeconomic populations, while still attracting first-timers, thus ensuring the Shack's success here in Arizona.

{"text":"I love this place......the food is always so good. I don't eat beef and they don't have chicken on their menu so I always get the mushroom burger with cheese fries. The mushroom burger and cheese fries are very tasty and their shakes compliments the meal very well.
Place is always busy with long lines and often hard to find a seat but its worth waiting for since the food is so satisfactory."}
{"text":"My second time here and both times it was sooooooo good! The first time in August, I walked from the linq to NYNY by myself in 110 degrees.. i was dying! Definitely devoured my shack stack burger in an instant.. it was THAT good. I usually dont like mushrooms but the cheese and all that oozed out, made it all worth it. Got the salted caramel custard shake to wash it down, so good!!

Came back to Vegas last week and definitely had to make another stop. This time I walked from
flamingo to NYNY in cold and windy weather.. I was so cold! (Just my luck). Got the same thing as last time and it made the walk all worth it.

I found out they just opened a shake shack at the north outlet so definitely worth a try if you're on or off the strip!!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place out on my last trip to Vegas and luckily there was no line when we went! Score! I got the burger with the mushroom in it (forgot the name of it) and it was really good. We also got the shake shack fries or whatever they're called, that had the cheese and bacon on it...those were super good too. I liked the burgers because they were really juicy and the bun was soft but not so soft that they fell apart. I'd come here again if I came back to Vegas and was in that area."}
{"text":"The excitement about shake shack in charlotte is crazy and please believe all the hype. I always loved going up north or down to Florida and making it my priority to get shake shack, and these location is just as great! First the burgers are amazing. My fav is the shake stack...an already delicious cheeseburger but with a fried stuffed mushroom on top! It is EVERYTHING! Get extra shakesauce, you won't regret it! A close second is the smoke shack, that chopped cherry pepper is the secret weapon! 
I must say, I usually focus on the burgers and the perfect bacon cheese fries. I can't wait to venture off the menu and try the chicken, hot dogs and very tempting shakes!

Please not, it's still new and long lines are usual. I like to go on a weekday around 4:30 when I get off work. After 5 you'll get a short line. After 7 go ahead and prepare to wait."}
{"text":"I had waited so long to try this place and super happy I finally did! I used to think it was a copy cat of In N' Out but the flavors and style is totally different. There are a lot of different variations of toppings and they even have hot dogs which was mine and my bf's fave. It had this delicious little green pepper in it that really brought it the flavors. Also the buns used for everything had a lightly sweet flavor and was really soft. The only thing I wasn't too impressed by was the loaded fries; it had a lot of toppings but it still didn't do it for me.. Maybe it needed more cheese hehe"}
{"text":"I have seen Shake Shack all over the world. One of my regrets was not trying it when I saw it, lineless in Dubai. Well here was my chance again and I was trying them, with long lines and all. Got the Smoke Shack, bacon cheeseburger with cherry peppers. Oh it was yummy, juicy, gooey from cheese and the flavor of the cherry peppers..excellent burger. Also their cheese fries are flavorful and crisp. Prices are average, about $7 for my burger and $3 for the fries. Worth every penny"}
{"text":"We are from San Antonio and I have to say, I can't wait until you make over to our city. Blows any burger place in SA out of the water."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burgers on the planet!  Friendly staff, amazing chocolate peanut butter shakes and the cheese fries are some of the best out there.  Highly recommended and a must do if you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good service, nice location, decent burger.  Solid 3 stars on par with similar chains that serve a good burger in a category where comparing them in a blind taste test would be challenging to differentiate one from the other."}
{"text":"The service I have gotten at Shake Shack has always been mixed. I've visited them in Boston, Chicago and now Phoenix and have had good experiences and some pretty mediocre ones. Shake Shack got their start in 2004 in NYC and has expanded to over 130 stores in under 15 years. Sometimes when these restaurants explode like that they lose some of the qualities that originally made them so great. I actually had a nice evening at this location. This Shake Shack is in the Phoenix Uptown Plaza which is becoming a little mini foodie paradise with all the killer eats moving in. I went with my go-to item the SmokeStack burger. You can't go wrong with a burger topped with cherry pepper relish and applewood smoked bacon. I love the crinkle fries and got them with melted cheese but felt it really didn't make it any more special. The big complaint about SS has always been the prices. Just recently in the past ten years it became the norm to charge $7 to $10 for a burger at some of these new burger joints. I've learned to just accept it. Shake Shack makes a killer burger and the shakes are pretty amazing too. Tonight I got great customer service and lots of welcoming smiles from the employees. So hats off to this location for putting Shake Shack back on my good side."}
{"text":"When it comes to cheeseburgers, the faster you can get them in your face, the better.  Although the Shake Shack doesn't necessarily qualify as \"fast food\" (it's more appropriately kinda fast, like 5 mph over the speed limit in the middle lane fast), that's the only real issue one might have waiting at Shake Shack for their burger while thinking they're in a fast-food joint.  All their concerns will melt away when they see that Shake Shack whips em' up fresh for your mouth and in a masterful fashion: super hot, greasy and artfully covered in melted American cheese.

I had a SmokeShack burger which had Applewood smoked bacon and ShakeSauce on it. Sinking my teeth into that baby was my favorite vice in a city full of sin.  If you think you won't be satisfied with just the SmokeShack burger -- or any burger for that matter -- you can get a double of any burger on the Shake Shack menu.  Also, their fries are pretty good too, but they only come in one size, which is between a medium and a large... a ledium.

Surprisingly, the chocolate shake wasn't as good as I expected it to be.   You know, with a name like \"Shake Shack\", you expect socks to be blown."}
{"text":"CANNOT COMPARE THIS PLACE TO IN-AND-OUT!

Food (5 stars!): This place is LITERALLY amazing! The burgers are on the pricier side ($7-$12) but it is worth every penny! My friend and I decided to both get the shack stack burger and the cheesy fries. The shack stack burger comes with portobello mushrooms and OMG it just melts into your mouth! When you bite into it, you have the cheese oozing out. You can taste the freshness from the tomatoes and the lettuce! If you get the chance, PLEASE TRY THEIR SHACK STACK BURGER! I am doing you a favor! My friend and I literally didn't want it to end. The cheesy fries were good also! They used a different cheese instead of the regular nacho cheese that every other place uses! The cheese is what made the fries taste a lot better! Highly recommend everyone and everyone's friends to try this place! It will literally change your life!!

Service (4 stars): There was a long line but the line moved pretty quickly. It didn't take long for us to get our food. They are very busy so when I requested for hot sauce, they took a while to give it to me. They forgot to give my friend his shake. So make sure you double check your orders."}
{"text":"I decided to take my girlfriend here on a small date because I heard some good things about this place. 

After our long wait in line we finally got to order and our meal together for a burger,fries, and a drink was almost $40 alone. Both of our meals were over $15 just for a burger, fries, and a drink. But the food was really good don't get me wrong. But I'm not reviewing the food I'm reviewing the customer service. 

They gave us our numbers and they said they'd call the numbers when the food was ready. So about 10 minutes later I hear my number being called so I go up to grab my food and then they called my girlfriends number which was right after mine so I went to grab both to save my girlfriend the walk and the worker slammed her hand on the tray and pulled it away from me and said \"sorry that's not yours\" I simply replied back saying \"it's my girlfriends and you were the one who took our order and gave us the numbers\" and she said rudely \"well she can come get it herself\" and right after that the manger walks over and asks the worker if she's ok like if I just assaulted her or something and not even asking what the problem was. As my girlfriend and I sat down to eat their employees kept walking by us making eye contact and just flat out staring at us, making us uncomfortable. 

I have not been back since but I hope the customer service has improved for the future."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the milkshakes are amazing!I would like to single out an employee there named Jenny who went out of her way to make my daughter Alexis feel special.Alexis was her special helper and even brought our meal out to us!Later when Alexis wanted water ,Jenny again helped her out.I think Jenny is a wonderful asset to your establishment and we will definitely be returning for the delicious meals and of course Jenny's excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of this location! There's plenty of seating available, lots of outdoor lighting, clean table tops, friendly staff and fast service.

Cheese fries were extra crispy -- yum! And their root beer float was also very good! I ordered a single shake shack burger and it was good, but nothing spectacular.

The only major downside of all Shake Shacks: no spice"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, reasonable price, and the one place on the strip that seems family friendly."}
{"text":"The burgers here are amazing. One of the best burgers I had so far! The price is excellent. I ordered a cheeseburger (with shake sauce),  crinkle cut fries, and a large lemonade all for $12 bucks. 

The Shake Shack is located right in front of the New York New York hotel, right off of Las Vegas Blvd. The location is awesome, and I love the atmosphere. The seating inside the restaurant is pretty cool. It's made to look like a fast food place, but they give you buzzers when you order so you can sit down and wait for your food. The seating area is nice, and they have a bunch of big screen T.V's with sports on them to keep you busy. 

The cheeseburger with shake sauce was absolutely amazing. It definitely has a home made hamburger feel and taste. The vegetables were fresh. The bun was soft, and the meat was soft and tasty.  The crinkle cut fries were cooked perfectly. Not too crunchy, and not too soft! They are fresh made fries. The lemonade went well with the meal. 

I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Fast food service but, restaurant quality food. The shack burger was tasty and not over priced. It's cool that they offer beer considering you don't find that at most fast food chains. Cashier was friendly!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack? Or Innout? I'll have both please! If I were to compared Innout with all the burgers I go to, I'd not like anything but Innout. California have Innout, and New York have Shake Shack. So far all the stuff coming from the East coast, I like this the best.

|Location|
It's outside of NY NY hotel, on Las Vegas Blvd. Just like in NY, the line can get to outta door. We came at an odd hour yet still had to wait for awhile. 

|Food|
Shack Burger ($5.29): When I first had it in New York, I didn't think much of it till the second time. For some, the burger is kinda small but it's a perfect size for me. I was really stuffed after having this with some fries on the side. If one thing stood out from this place is their delicious soft & sweet buns! 

Shroom Burger ($6.99): another good thing about this place is that it has option for vegetarian. And their shroom burger is the bomb. They deep dried the mushroom and stacked with cheese in the middle. Very delicious! 

Fries ($2.99): the fries are okay in my opinion. It reminds me of Del Taco fries. It's very crispy and not oily but I prefer regular fries for burgers more. Everyone seem to get cheese for this type of fries but no thanks."}
{"text":"First time here food was very good i had the shack burger an i tried the chicken sandwich both were good i believe the chicken sandwich was a bit better food was alittle pricey paid $24 for two orders of fries an three burgers but worth ever penny"}
{"text":"First, the food. Yum-o! The Shack Stack or the Shroom Burger are awesome. The mushroom just exploded in your mouth and the cheese and fresh veggies are perfect. Then add some cheese fries and you're good to go. And don't forget the speciality root beer. Oh yeah!

Now for the customer service. The guy that took our order was uber funny and super nice. Quick and easy transaction. Even with a line, he didn't make us feel rushed. He helped us order and let us sample the root beer before we ordered it.

Food came out quick and piping hot. 

Halfway through the meal and nice women (I assume a manager) came to ask how everything was. We raved about the food and chatted with her a bit. As we were finishing up she came and surprised us with dessert. Two of the best cups of custard I've ever tasted!

This place is the best in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The wait wasn't too bad although finding a table takes some skill. I love that they have options for your pet like doggie snacks to take home to them. The burgers were juicy, well seasoned, and pretty filling. Shake was yum! So thick and creamy and had just the right amount of sweetness. The fries were crisp, nicely salted, and addicting! Would come back to visit again!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried the Shake Shack was in Washington DC. I was told one of the best burgers and cheese fries are a must try. Well, I've been waiting to try this place again and finally got one in Vegas. This is not as close as San Francisco but it is only a flight away. Well I was not disappointed. The burgers were juicy and flavorful and the fries outstanding. It made me feel like high school fries but upgraded to adult style. I would continue coming here for great experience with excellent food."}
{"text":"I first discovered Shake Shack via The Message is Medium Rare. Being well over 2500 miles from the nearest location was heartbreaking. When I discovered there was not only one in Vegas, but one in NYNY, where I was staying, was a dream come true.

I ate here all three days of our trip. I had three different burgers. I fell in love.

The Smokeshack was my least favorite of the burgers. Bacon always feels like an unwanted after thought on burgers and even though they tried to balance it with acidic peppers it was still lack luster. The Shackburger is a perfect representation of a classic burger. The soft bun melts away, the burger has a crisp skin and tastes of steak, the toppings are in perfect harmony. The crown jewel of Shake Shack is the Shackmeister burger. Topped with their delicious fried shallots, cheese, and shack sauce. Perfection. Their Fries are deceiving, they look like crappy school lunch fries but they are crisp on the outside and pillowy soft inside. Cover them with cheese sauce because you are in Vegas!

They also serve beer here and no matter what we ordered we were always undercharged for the beer. I guess it was out lucky day."}
{"text":"After donating money to the casino executives the only thing that can bring me back to life is Shake Shack - Not that overrated place called In-N-Out with 80% bun burgers and disgusting kmart cafeteria fries. I'm talking a juicy fresh burger on a roll softer than soulja boy. It's so delicious sometimes i cant help but talk dirty to it. Its so good i call it 'shake crack'. I slap the buns first because if Saltbae can do it to his meats than i can slap the bun and not be judged. I become a slave to the burger like a liberal is to fake news. 

Farmer Boys has a good burger too in Vegas. Few minutes from Shake Shack off the strip on Decatur."}
{"text":"First time at Shake Shack & I love you! This might sound weird, but I am not a burger type of person. I rarely eat burgers! But for some reason, my brother kept telling me to try it and I did & I love it! The line was long, but it moved very quickly. Got our food within 10 minutes. I got the ' Shake Stack ' & the BBQ Bacon Cheese Fries. Both were very delicious! I would def come back."}
{"text":"Food was great. Smaller size burgers than expected.  Line moves pretty fast.  Hot was pretty good. I would get a double patty next time."}
{"text":"My 3rd visit to Shake Shack at the Downtown Summerlin location. Wife and I both had the shroom burgers which is the fried breaded portobello mushroom with cheese in the middle ( their version of a veggie burger) It's delicious. The oozing cheese from the middle with each bite really makes the difference and you won't even realize you're eating a fried mushroom. Cheese fries were also great as usual. Very satisfied this visit as I've been on all my visits."}
{"text":"Came here for a bite with some friends. Friendly staff, clean environment. They had a plethora of items on their menu, but I opted for their Shroom Burger. I felt the price of my order was a tad expensive as I didn't order a side or drink. The burger was fine, but a bit too much grease. 

I've heard a lot about Shake Shack, and I can't really say the hype was realistically met. The food was edible, but the staff and place alone were fantastic."}
{"text":"Great prices very friendly so glad we stopped in this spot. They need to open one in los angeles.  Great food."}
{"text":"We have been dying to try this place and finally......finally we made it! Line as not super long and they moved people through fast. There is indoor and outdoor seating available. Tried the burgers, cheese fries and a few shakes - very tasty, my friends. The best parts were the vibe, the price and the quality of the food. It was one of the better fast meals we had while on the Strip."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Shake Shack! I took my brother and husband last night. Non of us had tried Shake Shack before so I was excited to get a variety of things. After seeing the photo's of the chicken sandwich I was able to convinced my brother to share a burger and the chicken sandwich with me. My husband got the SmokeShack Double Cheeseburger, comes topped with all-natural Applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and ShackSauce. . It was gone in less than 10 seconds. He loved it. My brother and I split the ShackBurger Double Cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce. Along with the Chick'n Shack - Crispy Chicken Breast with lettuce, pickles, and buttermilk herb mayo. As for the burger, it was so flavorful and juicy. Something about this burger patty just explodes with flavor. Top that off with that liquid gold cheese.... one of the best burgers I have ever had. My brother's eye's rolled back in to his head at his first AND second bite. He said it was the best burger he had ever tasted. And yes. The Chicken sandwich was awesome as well. Thick, juicy, crunchy, and fresh. So glad I tried it. We also got 3 French Fries, including one with cheese. I recommend you get one with out cheese. Its delicious but after having it on my burger I was happy to get a little break from it with some of the plain French Fries. My husband had one of their shakes and he said it was very rich but he liked it! 

It was really good all in all. Was it a little pricey? Yes! But I knew that coming in. I would also say that you are getting what you pay for. Quality food."}
{"text":"Everyone is so friendly here! Excellent customer service! I didn't realized that ordering the \"cookies n cream\" shake was off the menu to place the \"holiday shake.\" When I put an order in specifically for the cookies n cream, the gal didn't correct me. When my order arrived I was stunned. They gladly replaced my order and giving me the incorrect order. 

The cheese burger was good! I hear that if you don't want your toppings on burger, just ask for it on the \"side.\" They give you more. ;)

Here's a picture of our spread for 4 adults and 2 young children."}
{"text":"Fast food at its finest, not to mention their beef is hormone free and antibiotic free. They have a fantastic patio for outdoor dining and let's not forget they have beer and wine. Always a bonus with burgers and fries!"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time this evening to see what the hype was about....yeahhh We left there so confused. This place had big expectations to fill...I love five guys and burgerfi, smash burger, and in and out...these are great burger places. But seriously shake shack....Like what? I literally don't understand the hype?? We sat there eating and being in utter confusion. When we would drive by each time it was lined out the door so we figured it had to be good...well it's a great marketing ploy...there is a line outside wrapping around because as soon as you walk in there is the register and no where else to stand so the only place left is outside which explains why people are always in line outside. I love hamburgers and went in there diving into the full experience. My fiancé and I both got the double shackburger, order of fries each, a milkshake each and then I got a small soda. For two ppl it cost $40! For 2 burger, 2 fries, one drink, 2 shakes. But it wasn't even the price it was the taste of the food. It was sub-par...burgers had no taste...at all...fries were crinkle cut and again taste wasn't there and it tasted like the frozen crinkle fries u put in the oven. The shakes were really bad...I mean really bad...I got vanilla and my fiancé got the marshmallow chocolate chip and they weren't good...in fact pretty gross...we took two sips and trashed them. Let me tell u this-I definitely will not be back and will go to the other burger joints in the area-smash burger and five guys...great burgers and fries. I see this place getting a lot of customers at first bc of the hype but there is no way it is a sustainable business... people will try it but they are not coming back for seconds... it will not last more than a year or two...their competitors in the area have way better food. Oh and if you want a great milkshake go to cookout...you can't beat their milkshakes they are amazing (and their burgers too)."}
{"text":"[12.19.17] I'm a Shake Shack fan and started my fix with this delight in NYC,  DC, B'more then Chicago.  I am loyal. The food is consistently good and so was it here in Vegas.  The service has always been good.  This review is about the service and delivery of the food which after eating at so many, I would have hoped for the same.  Came on a Sunday night to intro my bestie to her first bite of the Shack.  Ya'll know the menu can be confusing at first and so it was unnecessary for the cashier to continue to yell at us that she was ready to take our order when we were conveying we were not ready.  Mind you, there was NO line ahead or behind us.  Then we order and my order must have been too small because she repeated: \"That's it?  You don't want nothing else?\" Ok - no biggie, but unnecessary after all the pre-yelling.  Then my buzzer calls I'm the only one within five feet of the pick up with a buzzing buzzer with three employees behind the counter.  Not a one gives a No. 2 about me so I look, it is what I ordered and the ticket has my name on it.  So I put my buzzer down and take the food.  NOW they see me and the employee yells: PUT THAT FOOD DOWN, IT'S NOT YOURS. YOU DON'T KNOW IT'S YOURS. I set it down, she looks at my buzzer, she looks at me, then she goes: oh, haha, it's yours.  And to top the cake, it was the ugliest looking 'shroom burger the Shack has ever presented me."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place since it's been hyped as the In N Out of the East Coast, and having it on The Strip in Vegas seemed like a real treat! Came here on a Friday night around 9PM and there was no line. I ordered the Shack Burger, a Chocolate Shake, and Cheese Fries. 

(+) Shack Burger: Juicy medium rare beef patty, crisp lettuce and tomato, sweet/soft patty. 
(-) Chocolate Shake: Diluted chocolate, tasted mostly like vanilla, melted quickly.
(-) Cheese Fries: I could buy frozen Ore-Ida fries and melt a Kraft american cheese slice on top by myself.

They give you a buzzer, which allows you to go find a seat while you wait for your entire order to be ready presented on a metal tray. Indoor seating is limited to smaller parties, while outdoor seating has park tables. I recommend sitting outdoors because hey, when does it ever rain in Vegas? Sitting and admiring the bright lights, tall buildings, and hustle and bustle while eating your burger is the best way to start the night."}
{"text":"Ok I just want to start off by saying that this location is literally a destination that people travel to come to. People always say they want to go to Vegas and try shake shack. Knowing this, you would think that the employees would have exceptional customer service. This is not the case. I've been here twice with two different people and both times were not that great. One star because the shake was really good but everything else sucked. The employees did not crack a smile one time, they rushed through our orders and I understand that it's busy, however you should be able to try to help recommend something for someone who has never eaten at your establishment. I got cheese fries and they were cold. My friend ordered a burger and asked them the melt the cheese more and they said it's not possible to do so. My other friend asked for ranch and the guy replied \"sorry sweetheart, we don't carry ranch here\" in a condescending manner. The food is not all that great and the employees don't make it worth coming. Go down the strip and spend your money at Taco Bell cantina lol"}
{"text":"Our party was strolling down the strip and just needed a quick bite, glad we stopped by. Tasted some great burgers today and fries were most awesome as well! The lemonades offered were done right and this ended up being a pleasant surprise. Coming from California we have In-N-Out and Five Guys, so I would say that this is basically the next level up! For those visiting internationally, stop if you can but not the biggest deal if you don't make it as there is similar alternatives."}
{"text":"I see them popping up everywhere and had to try as I've heard some hype.
Walked in and liked the atmosphere.
the menu looked fun but I couldn't find a special burger?
I got the hamburger with shack sauce?
Peanut Butter shake and crinkle fries.
My hubby got some bacon double double and a shake.
No special condiments, just ketchup and mustard and a Louisiana hot sauce on the condiment bar.

When our buzzer buzzed and we got our tray, I didn't see anything special. The shakes were small and 5.29 for one?
My hubby's double double was almost 10$.

I pay for good food but I really didn't get anything good here.
Just a scrawny hamburger  (I'm sure the meat is better than other places) and the fries tasted like ore Ida fries you made as a kid at home.
Peanut Butter shake was good as the girl told me it has custard in it. They do sell alcohol here and have sports playing on the tvs.
Nice atmosphere and concept but not worth the 30$ we paid for 2 hamburgers, fries and small shakes.
Disappointed."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Shake Shack in Atlanta! This was my first time at the Charlotte Shake Shack location. I had heard about the wait to order and the crazy line so expected nothing else. What I didn't expect was the ONE HOUR long wait after I ordered my food. I watched a few people demand a refund after waiting just 30 min. One customer even asked if they could open a third register and was rudely shut down. Multiple people who had ordered online and had a scheduled pick up were waiting even longer after arriving. Multiple staff members were taking breaks or messing around behind the counter and didn't seem concerned with all the people leaving or negative comments about the wait. I don't care how good the food is...it is not worth the hour+ long wait when we already have great spots like Soda Shoppe, Mr. K's and Brooks here in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I'm DEFINITELY a fan! Shake Shack ALWAYS wins the battle of the first meal in Vegas.

It's even BETTER when you're holding a MLife Platinum card so you can go up to the express line. There are two lines - the regular line is the winding one, and the express line is right up against the menu. So as long as you know what you're ordering, just walk right up and flash your HIGHER-TIER MLife membership card to get served next.

My go-to is the Shack Stack - \"Cheeseburger and crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheese topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce\". Seriously, if you love mushrooms as much as I do - you NEED to treat yoself to this burger. But be careful, the muenster and cheddar cheese WILL squeeze out the other side of your burger so it's best to eat it from the little baggy to catch the cheese. Or eat it over some fries for extra cheese.

The SmokeShack is the second best, IMO, with the all-natural applewood smoked bacon and chopped cherry peppers. The peppers do give it the tiniest bit of heat and crispy bacon is ALWAYS amazing.

You can also order the burgers (sans Shack Stack and Shroom Burger) as single or double. They'll also ask whether you want onions and pickles. You can also remove the lettuce and tomatoes if you want to make it \"your own\" burger or whatever.

I guess they also have fries and desserts on their menu, but honestly, I'd opt to get TWO burgers (the Shack Stack and SmokeShack) because the burgers are definitely smaller than other burgers. Oh! But their Shack-made Lemonade is the BOMB too! My mouth is watering as I'm writing this review and all I want to do is fly back to Vegas for these burgers.

One last thing - the place can get PACKED! Seats will get taken quickly. Literally everyone is gathered in the center of the restaurant waiting for their order OR getting their drink from the machines. Just wish there was more organization to the madness..."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. GO HERE!! Seriously was blown away by this place. I know it is a chain but tastes so local and fresh! Will probably be a new go to for sure."}
{"text":"Like the burgers,  shakes,  and crinkle cut fries.  Only downside is the price. Very expensive especially if I'm taking my whole family.  I still manage to hit this place up whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is shake Shack.  Not reviewing the food because it's pretty much the same at any location.  Just visiting AZ but what impressed me at this location was the service. Also was refreshing to not wait in a long line,  the locals must not have caught on yet"}
{"text":"Great food. Especially the cheesy bacon fries and the milkshakes and concretes. My personal favorite was the cupcake concrete.

The workers were incredibly nice as well, all of them were very helpful. I'd even give a special thanks to Nakia (spelling?) she went out of her way to be welcoming and friendly to my kids and they were excited to talk to her every time she came around to make sure we were doing well."}
{"text":"OMG SHAKE SHACK IS SO FREAKING AMAZING! NOT.

Sorry people. It's aight. I'm gonna give them 2 star cause it's all hype. I came in expecting greatness. Person taking my order couldn't give me any recommendations or personal favorites. It wasn't too busy could've made anything up I'd get it. 

I went with something simple their single burger. Nothing special. Could've made it at home. Would've thought their base stuff would be at least decent. Nope. A whopper or  something from Wendy's would've been better. It was small and too simple for the price. Its more like In and Out nothing flashy. GOOD!? Get out of here. 

Had to try a shake. Went with red velvet shake. Not bad. Good I liked it especially after walking the strip on a 100 degree kind of day but nothing special. Taste like a red velvet shake from anywhere else that serves it. Small and simple for the price once again. Strip price!? Maybe.

The atmosphere is pretty chill, I like it. They have nice inside with tvs and mostly spacious dining. Tables have lots of elbow room but back to back a little tight depending on who sits next to you. They have some seatings outside too.

I'm sure this place is good and I'm probably not only person to come in knowing nothing about the place but who's fault is it for my experience the employee or mine. Anyways I might try them out again but not anytime soon unless I hear about something I really have to try.

Easily accessible when walking along the strip but not so if your driving cause you have park at the nearest casino and walk."}
{"text":"Not a fan of their fries. Burger was okay. I grew up with In&Out, so I prefer their burgers over Shake Shack. However, I did thoroughly enjoy the milkshakes & environment here"}
{"text":"They say this is the east coast's In-N-Out, but being the California girl I am, I have to say NOTHING beats In-N-Out. I can't help it, but I do have my reasoning. Maybe the actual New York one tastes better? 

Okay, so I got the \"shack stack.\" Try saying that three times as fast as you can, hah, bet you haven't heard that one before! LOL, jk, bet you have! ANYWAYS, the \"shack stack\" is a regular burger with a patty, lettuce, tomato, cheese and the buns, but what makes it a \"shack stack\" is that it comes with a mushroom. Not just any mushroom though, a mushroom stuffed with cheese and breaded with panko all over. This burger is about $10. If I were to get just a mushroom burger or a regular burger, it would be about five or six dollars. I technically paid an extra five or six dollars for the mushroom.

It would have been fine with me if it tasted amazing, but it did not tickle my taste buds the way I hoped. First off, the mushroom was salty. I usually don't think many things are salty, but this, I could tell it was salty. The rest of the burger was good; the meat and the rest of the veggies. The bun was interesting though. It was sweet unlike most places.

Glad I tried Shake Shack, but I don't think I would be coming back for seconds on the burgers. I would like to try their desserts though."}
{"text":"Had to wait in line for about 10 minutes or so but I did enjoy my shack burger! 
There are many friendly people and they were very pleasant and helpful. 
It might be a little pricey for the size of the sandwich but it is so tasty it's worth the money;)"}
{"text":"After a few hours gambling my wife and I were hungry. Pretty much everything close to our hotel, NY NY, was closed. Shake Shack was open. Burgers were a total disappointment, dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"I tried shack shake in NYC  and New York New York hotel at the strip and didn't really like. But this shack shake.. I fell in love! Less crowds and tastes better!!! I waited about 8 min to order. The lady who took my order was super nice! Then waited about ten minutes. The tastes was amazing!!! It was clean and a lot of places to eat! I am officially shack Shake fan! Since I am from west coast.. compared to in n out.. shake shack is bit pricey. But still go and enjoy !! Their chocolate shake is... omg just try!! It's amazing!!"}
{"text":"it had been almost 7 years since my last Shake Shack meal.  this time around, i realized that it's really in a category of it's own.  it's not fast food, and it's not your full service restaurant.  BUT.  whatever category you put them in, the burgers are exceptional.  meat quality is superior to any fast food joint that exists, perhaps just as good as your 4-5 star rated full service restaurants, and better than many of the plentiful out there.

we ordered a DOUBLE SHACK BURGER, CHICK'N SHACK, FRIES, SALTED CARAMEL SHAKE and JACKPOT CONCRETE, and here's how it rolled:

the DOUBLE SHACKBURGER.  mmmm.  meat was tender, no doubt freshly ground.  crumbled easily at the bite.  so flavorful.  and the cheese.  lusciously melted on the patty.  that bun, eggy and a bite gave all the flavors and textures in the burger.  in other words, i tasted the burger as a whole, and not as a sum of all its parts.  each and every part of its components were synonymous with its bigger self, ie. as being A BURGER.  does that make any sense?  i can't think of any other way to explain it.  it was so naturally melded together, every luscious bite seamlessly glorious.  SO.  DARN.  GOOOOOD. 

the CHICK'N SHACK.  so i came in with no expectations.  but this was life-changing amazing.  so crispy, not greasy.  and ahhhh... J-U-U-U-U-I-C-Y.  i was blown away by this chick-a-dee. just perfection all around.  yeah cliché, but it's truth.  sorry...  i just don't think i'll ever want another Chick-fil-Who??  ever again.  YEAH.  THAT GOOD.  and then some.  and some more.  why oh why did hubby and i share??!

FRIES?  yummy.  everyone has their opinion on the fries.  and they compare.  but i like them.  in fact, they're reminiscent of the fries i had as a little girl on those few times mom bought frozen fries from the grocery.  BUT.  yes, these are so much better!  golden crispy outside and fluffy inside. 

SALTED CARAMEL SHAKE.  more please!!  i felt like a little girl again with this frozen custard.  Y.U.M.  i could have used an extra strong flavor on the salted caramel, but that's just me.  i like everything to taste stronger when it comes to shakes.  just wished to God they had extended their featured MISO SALTED CARAMEL flavor from the week before!!!  boo hoo... i'll just hope they bring that to LaLaLand.  i will be there.

JACKPOT CONCRETE - yummy, but mine was pretty melted and soft by the time i got to it.  will have to try again next time.  fun and festive flavor though, with the confetti sprinkles and waffle pieces and strawberry puree.  

overall, my testbuds had the time of their burger-lovin life.  i would have had dinner here too had it been closer to my hotel.  BUT.  i shall wait until Danny Meyers serves me up some in WeHo or DTLA.. #seeYAsoon #cannotFRIGGINwait #cravingSS #hangry4SSinLA

service was very pleasant, despite the long long 5-deep line.  it was high noon and bustling, but the quality of every item we had was perfect."}
{"text":"My $30 meal at a burger place was as filling as a buffet with a whole lot less tasting options. Over priced yet tasty and good quality meat, which in fact is what a burger is. The $30 was for a double, fries and a shake."}
{"text":"Lanche famoso!!! A batata é fantástica !!! O lanche muito bom, porém lanche é pequeno!!!"}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner/snack at this Summerlin Shops location. I loved how friendly the staff was and the burgers were great as usual. Kids were especially happy with their double brownie hot chocolate drinks. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am so glad that they decided to open one in Henderson because going to the one on the strip when all I want is their delicious food would be a headache. 

This location was spotless, workers were friendly and helpful, and the food came out quick. 

The red velvet shake was delicious. If you know me, you know I can be really picky about my red velvet lol. The cheese fries were well proportioned and I do appreciate that they somewhat layer it so that even the bottom ones are covered. The fry stick is also a nice touch. My burger was made well seasoned and made my taste buds dance. 

The one and only complaint I have is that it is pretty expensive. Worth it? Yes. But I still gotta say that In-N-Out is taking the lead because they offer great burgers too at a fair price."}
{"text":"Great place, burger is much better than in and out, and they have food for four legs friends as well Hope they can open a franchise in San Francisco Bay Area"}
{"text":"Yummy burgers and a solid selection! There were burgers, hotdogs, shakes and a vegetarian mushroom burger. I ordered the mushroom burger and my brother ordered the bacon burger. While Yelp showed the \"Shake Shack\" as Vegan, this is only VEGETARIAN. So strict vegans beware. The fried mushroom is filled with Muenster and cheddar cheese. 

The line was long, but wait time after ordering was fair. The portions were relatively small given the price. However, very tasty!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack is really yummy! I love the fries here.. makes me feel like a kid again. I've never tried the burgers YET... I know :( I definitely will in the near, NEAR future! I always order the hot dogs here. The ShackMeister Dog is my favorite! If you love cheese and hot dogs topped with crispy shallots, then this is the go to dog! It is really delicious & price is good too! This place is always packed. The line always goes out the door & it is very hard to find seating,  but it's totally worth! I hope to one day try the location in New York as well. :) !"}
{"text":"Awful. The food is mass produced with absolutely no love involved. I have tried this place twice and both times I was extremely disappointed. They did earn the one star for their concrete ice cream, that was tasty. Spend your vacation dollars elsewhere, this food sucks."}
{"text":"The burgers are tasty and flavorful. I had the smoke stack and there was a little bit of heat from the peppers. The burgers are pretty small. If you love cheese, order the cheese fries."}
{"text":"Food was bland. Shakes were decent. Got my order wrong and had to wait longer. Came 40 min for below mediocre food. Back to Bad Daddy's I go."}
{"text":"For a place so crowded, the service is amazing. They get your food to you quickly and when it comes it taste pretty good. I am not a huge fan of cheeses but my mom and boyfriend LOVED the burgers. My favorite thing was the mushroom burger that we ordered, i still havent found another fast food vegetarian/ vegan option that can compare to it. The place is pretty pricey but for the quality of the food is worth it. My only problems with my experience was that our oreo shake was HORRIBLE it was thick (which i like) but it tasted like nyquil and chocolate mixed together. I honestly could have vomited after tasting it and also the tables are not clean when you sit down, so i suggest asking someone to wipe them or wiping them down yourself like we did with some napkins and water. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some friends yesterday and I have to say that I was really impressed! The Chicken Sandwich and Double Bacon Cheese fries were to die for!!

Kasey who worked at the counter had the best smile and asked how my day was going and Mike the Manager came to our table and asked how our meals were and how everything else was and I told him that it was my first time lunching at Shake Shack. He was definitely the nicest guy ever and went out of his way to just check on us and chat for a little bit.

I WILL BE RETURNING!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try this place and I love it. A lot of my friends were telling me that In-n-Out is still better. However, I don't think you can compare the two. 

I ordered the smoke shack (it had BACON), cheese fries and the chocolate shake! I liked the chocolate the best. The burger wasn't the best burger ever but I'd eat it again for sure. I liked the fries but my boyfriend didn't. I think I liked it coz it had cheese. 

I'd be back for the shakes and root beer floats. And I'd want to try the other burgers as well! 

I'm so glad they opened a Las Vegas location."}
{"text":"Good spot!
Hot dogs are good apparently, fries are ok, burger ok and the chicken sandwich was really good.
Always seems busy. Line goes fast but wait for food... tic toc. Takes a long time.
Decent employees.
Clean.
Love the picnic tables outside.
Would return if in a pinch.
So close to the hockey stadium and NYNY."}
{"text":"Shake Shack has been open on the Strip for a while now, but I was anxious to check it out when I heard they were opening a location in downtown Summerlin. While more expensive than your average burger joint, I'll say you can definitely taste the difference. The dining area could have been cleaner, many of the tables weren't wiped down, but the staff was courteous and attentive. I was not disappointed when it came to the burgers either, they practically melt in your mouth. The offerings are simple but delicious, sticking to what they now best with a bit more \"flair\" than In-N-Out in my opinion. If you like burgers, Shake Shack is a must."}
{"text":"Great food, custumer service is a 10. Very impress. Thank you for having employees of that caliber."}
{"text":"Much better, Shake Shack! We came here last year in August when they had just opened and it was bad. The food, service, presentation and general disorder left us disappointed. We gave it another try and I was happy we did.

I got the Shack Stack burger: the melted cheese-stuffed Portobello patty and cheeseburger combined. It was heavenly. I took one bite and the hot melted cheese poured out. The fresh lettuce and tomato was great and the bun just right and not stale. Everything was fresh and well-made. Husband got a Coke to drink and the Smoke Stack: burger with bacon, cheese and cherry peppers. It was a vast improvement compared to last time. We shared an order of Cheese Fries and I got a side of their Shack sauce which is a bit like a horseradish mustard. 

Dessert: I got a single concrete mixer - the Jackpot. It had vanilla frozen custard with strawberry sauce mixed with Belgian waffle pieces and rainbow sprinkles. This was extremely good! We paid $29 for all of this..not bad by Vegas standards!

Recently, they opened a Shake Shack inside the Mall of America in my home state. I'm going to be visiting that location soon! Once I've recovered from my Vegas haze and replenished my resources."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, best ever!! I ordered the Shack stack which is a deep fried crispy portobello mushroom on top of a patty! It was HEAVEN!!! The portobello mushroom was definitely crispy & the patty was cooked just the way I like it! Omg. I wish there was pickles & it would have been the best burger ever!! I also ordered a malted caramel shake. Mmmm! I don't know the difference between the malt & milk shake because it tastes the same to me! The French fries weren't crackin. You could totally do without it. A little pricy when ordering a whole meal, but SO WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"Wow a really mediocre Steak & Shake.  Burger dry, fries nothing to write home about.  Decent shake.  Disorganized kitchen took forever.  Not sure what I'm missing here .. people love this?  In and out and five guys blow this away by miles."}
{"text":"I love the fact that they have Shack Shake in Vegas! I stick to the original offerings because hey, if it isn't broken, why fix it? Their shack sauce is delicious and is what make the burgers fabulous. Their Cheese Fries are very tasty too and the concretes! Yum! Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I loved Shake Shack in NY.

This one in  Las Vegas is just as good at the NY NY Hotel.

I stopped for lunch and ordered the usual....Shake Shack Double Burger with Cheese Fries!

Another satisfied meal...no BJ needed until tomorrow night....

The Burger and Fries were so freaking yummy!  The Burger is THE BEST!

The Beef is so HUGE and SO GOOOOOOD!

U must try a Shake Shack Burger either here or in NY!"}
{"text":"4th time here and it's still great. The double or single shackburger is always on point!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible in and out so much better! Meat over clocked light taste I feel like they don't know how to cook I'm chef by the way"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try Shake Shack as I have seen the reviews and pictures of the food at this place. But I have got to say first and foremost that I'm an In-N-Out type of girl. So I had very high expectations going into judging their food.

The establishment is pretty spacious and clean for a fast food-type of joint. There was a line when I paid a visit however there were 4 workers working the registers, so it went by super fast. I ordered the hamburger (with everything on it including shake shack sauce), fries, and a coke. Total came out to be around $10-$11. For that price, I was expecting the burger to be pretty decent in size. When I got my food, I was surprised. The burger was tiny lol. The produce in it was very fresh and the beef patty was cooked nicely, but meh it didn't taste as good as In-N-Out's meal for half the price. If you're going to order fries, get the cheese sauce!

The customer service here was superb though. A worker came by our table to take away our trash and to refill my soda without me having to do it myself. But overall it was just an okay food experience for me here!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack is a must try if you're in Vegas!

We got here at lunch time and waited 20mins in line. It took another 20mins for us to get our food, but that didnt bother us because we needed to wait for a table anyways. The place was super packed!

We ordered ShakeShack burgers with cheese fries. The patty was super juicy and tasty! But I didnt really taste the Shack Sauce? Was a little disappointed because that was the main reason why we tried this. 

Overall, I think the burger was delicious (not as good as In&Out tho) lol.

I will for sure come back when I visit the The Strip again!"}
{"text":"Sooooo overpriced for what you get!!! Literally $56 for a few burgers and 3 shakes that were fair at best...... Scottsdale trap stay away I repeat stay away.   It's one thing to pay top dollar for a burger with mushrooms but it better be good when it's this bad I just want to scream.  Please shake shack figure yourself out before you destroy Kierland next!!!"}
{"text":"I love burgers; ike most Americans because burgers are a part of our culture.  I have had great burgers and I have had bad burgers.  I first learned of Shake Shack a few years ago.  My partner and I visited NYC last Thanksgiving and saw there was one near our hotel.  We walked there and found them to be closed.  No big deal.  Thanksgiving day.  Even Americas main food needed a holiday.  As I perused the internet this week I learned that there was a SS coming to our neighborhood.  To add even more excitement to the news I found out that there was one already open in the Woodlawn area of Charlotte.  They had only opened about two months ago from the article.  I went to YouTube and watched some SS videos.  I saw lines of people waiting to get in to other locations.  One interviewer asked two guys inside the restaurant how long had they been waiting for their food and they replied \"40 minutes\".  Wow.  Can this be true?  Counter service -- they call your number, type restaurant and you wait that long for your food?  I gotta try this.  So it is lunch time today and my partner asks where I want to go.  I ask, \"my pick?\", he says sure.  I said \"SHAKE SHACK!!!\".  So off we go.  We arrive at about 1:30 and its the end of the lunch rush.  There is a line out the door.  At this point I am pumped up!  Finally gonna try one of these amazing burgers!  We finally get to the counter after about 20 minutes in line.  I order the Shack Cheeseburger, double.  My partner orders the Swiss Mushroom burger without a bun (low carb).  These sandwiches and one order of fries with water cups was $22.  Ok, these are amazing burgers.  It wont be cheap.  We get our pager and take our seats.  I gather our napkins, ketchup and utensils while we wait.  After about 10 minutes it goes off and we go pick up our food.  It comes back on a small cookie sheet.  First impression was, this is small.  The fry basket ($2.79) was barely full. Lots of little fry bits.  They were hot so I dug in.  My burger looked tasty.  I took it out of its little sack and took a bite.  Tasted good.  A bit salty.  With each bit I kept waiting for that moment like when your on a roller coaster and you begin to go over the other side.  That moment never came.  Did I give this place too much hype, I asked myself?  I heard so much about the Shack Sauce.  Halfway through the burger I remembered the Sauce.  I couldn't taste it.  I finished the fries and burger.  I felt disappointed.  Recently McDonalds rolled out their fresh beef, cooked to order Quarter Pounders.  When those came out I tried them.  They have been delicious.  Huge improvement over the previous Quarter Pounders.  I will go back to McD's for the Quarter Pounder.  I have not come up with a reason to return to Shake Shack.  I really wanted to love SS.  I wanted to brag to my friends that \"hey, we have a Shake Shack\".  I wanted to get back in line and order another, but that wasn't my feeling.  We left let down.  Maybe if they only had them in NYC and it was a destination burger joint only to be found there.  Maybe that would make it more desirable.  I noticed as we drove away, McDonalds and Wendy's parking lots were almost empty.  I believe once the novelty wears off, they will pick back up.  Note: The staff was friendly and they kept things stocked and the dining room clean."}
{"text":"Great burgers and shakes, resturant was packed with limited seating inside due to the cold weather with patio seating. However, food was great."}
{"text":"Did not have any of the service issues others reported. Also did not have anything custard based, so, no problems with melting shakes, etc.

Not busy when I arrived, so, order was taken promptly. Got my pager and grabbed a seat. Food was up fairly quick. Order correct.

Like: beer on tap, and a quality root beer, which I had. Burger (SmokeShack) had right amount of caramelization on it. Nice bun. Overall, nice, just did not get the wow factor that others seem to experience.

Fries: not a fan of crinkle cut, but these were crisp and hot from the fryer.

A fine burger, maybe on the pricey side for what you are getting, but, it's still a burger. I'd go back, just not going to make it a regular thing as there are other very good burger places around."}
{"text":"Great food and a great environment as we ended our day on the strip! Loved the burgers and fries with cheese on the side!"}
{"text":"stopped by herre visited the mall had lunch here pretty good burgers nice outside aera"}
{"text":"Got a burger and fries. They were low quality and very low flavor tasting food, greasy, and overpriced. Won't return."}
{"text":"Review Update: Aug. 2016. This restaurant has gone from 5 stars to 3. I don't mind the overinflated prices just as long as I have a clean environment while I eat. I hate how dirty the dining area was during our latest visit. Granted the patrons are pigs for not busing their own tables. However, I shouldn't have to clean down tables & chairs before sitting down. Suggestion to management: put more garbage bins around the dining area...and spring for large straws for your large drinks. We can't drink your large drinks without a bigger straw. :(
-----------

Previously a 5 star review.....
Take something that everybody loves (hamburger & shakes) and step it up a notch...that's what Shake Shake is all about. 

Located on the Las Vegas strip, just a 2 min walk from NYNY Hotel. The hamburger meat tasted fresh and wholesome. The shakes tasted like they were made from fresh ice cream (they weren't slimy like most burger places). 

Friendly service, big screen TVs, Clean Tables, Clean Floors....and even Clean Bathrooms. ;) This store seems to be well managed."}
{"text":"This place sucks!! Nothing special about their burger or chicken sandwich. Small sized portions and overpriced burgers. A double cheeseburger is 9.00 with tax a drink is about 3.00 and fries don't come with the burger, go figure. A total rip off.  
It should be called The Shit Shack!!!!"}
{"text":"Pricey but tasty. The thick milkshakes are tasty and sweet.  The place is packed so be ready for lines.  I'd pass on the cheesy fries for $4 and the regular fries that are $3 for one small size only was not worth except that a burger without fries would not be right."}
{"text":"Wow, great burger and shake!  The line went fast and they had excellent outdoor seating with a good view of the strip.  These burgers are a little small, but I can't eat a huge one anyway.  They made up for the size with the quality of the meat!"}
{"text":"My wife wanted to take the whole family to Shake Shack since we've heard so much about it.  I love a good burger as much as the next fat guy so I was happy to try out a new place.   First impression: cool location on the strip, chic décor, fast service.  Second impression:  the food is overpriced and marginal.  The burgers were overcooked and small-ish.  And nearly $6 for a tiny milkshake is absurd.  The fries are nothing special.  I could buy the same thing frozen and Walmart and cook them at home.  The cheese fries just had some nacho cheese stuff squirted over them.  

The bill for 2 adults and 3 kids was over $80. I realize this is a location on the Vegas strip, but that is crazy expensive fast food.   I don't understand the hype.  In-N-Out Burger is better value and has, in my not-so-humble opinion, much tastier food."}
{"text":"I finally got to see what all the hype was about for lunch yesterday. The place is bright with plenty of parking and seating both indoors and out. The ordering process was a bit slow as it was lunch time and busy but they only had one person taking orders. The menu is pretty straightforward...burgers, fries, shakes. I always order chicken instead of hamburgers and they only had one chicken sandwich option but they also have hot dogs so maybe I will try that next time. I had the chicken sandwich fries and a soda which ran about $12.00. For what is essentially fast food that's a bit much. My sandwich was good although a bit messy as it was loaded with shredded lettuce, pickles, and mayo. They served crinkle cut fries which I happen to be a big fan of and they have a good assortment of fountain drinks. I never see Fanta grape soda as an option so that was a fun surprise. They also have items on the menu for your dog if you are bringing your four-legged friend along.

It's definitely worth checking out of you are looking for something quick and a step above McDonalds."}
{"text":"This is probably the best tasting and most reasonably priced burger on the Strip. I was even willing to eat there two nights in a row. The single Shack Burger with cheese fries and a soda was a good sized meal for me. The burger was juicy and zesty. The crispy fries had a delightfully different (not Velveeta-y) cheese sauce. And the soda...was a soda. Hubs had a Chick'n Shack - \"very good\" but he was hungry again 20 minutes later. The service was pleasant and speedy, despite the big crowds. The music inside is kinda loud, but bonus points for the outdoor seating with a TV!"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas beginning of May and finally got to try Shake Shack and we loved it!! I was hoping to try the original in NYC first but we won't be on the East Coast for a while so yeah...

I completely forgot the specific burgers we ate but we enjoyed them and their crinkle fries were yummy as well. I personally like a good ole fashion burger and fries place...I don't need any gimmicks or fad. I also like that it doesn't have crazy prices like other places on the strip. 

Ok, that's all I can remember so I will just attach some photos below :)"}
{"text":"So nasty.  Patty was so greasy.  meat is frozen not fresh. way overpriced. Don't waste your time coming here.  Goto in and out or habit burger if you want a fresh real burger. never going back again."}
{"text":"My new late night cravings spot in vegas. 

I had the tots with cheese and bacon, and my goodness it was so yummy. 

My husband had a fried chicken sandwhich, which was even better."}
{"text":"Never thought I'd find a burger that I likes better then In n Out but this place is it. Great meat on a potato roll from NY. Very attentive staff. Fries are great and drinks were ample. We will be back but probably during the week to avoid crowd and many kids"}
{"text":"Wrinkle fries - My favorite type of fry! More crunchy than soft.

Vanilla custard ice cream with strawberry syrup - Lots of space in the center but was filling anyway. The strawberry syrup added an extra layer of sweet. Ask for more next time. 

Price - Nearly $10 for a small burger. 

Staff - Friendly, approachable, and more than accommodating in bringing out food or providing extra condiments (ex. Can I get extra, extra Shake Shack sauce on the side?)

Alcohol selection - Have their own wines! Will try that next time."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place because of all the hype. I will say that it is definitely a must try. 

It is on the pricer side for a burger but it was definitely worth it. 

The Shake Stack is definitely delicious."}
{"text":"I've eaten at shake shack every time I have visited vegas, which is quite often over the past year. The long lines and crowds might deter you away from eating here, but the lines go by fast and the service of the staff is very efficient. My go to order is a double smokeshack with cheese fries. The burger is cooked perfectly between a buttery bun topped with cherry peppers. I love shake shack and am glad that they're beginning to open up chains on the west coast."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to a Shake Shack then you are seriously missing out! The fries are nice and crispy, these are the fries I crave when I want french fries! I have only had the Shack burger (and writing this review now is painful because now I really want a Shack burger) and it is delicious! If you like freshly cooked and perfectly greasy burgers this is the place! The shakes are great too, only downside is, if the place is busy your shake will be sitting there a few minutes before you get your food and is a little melted but that's honestly the only negative thing I can even begin to say."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricey side but food is so good. I guess kind of a gourmet burger joint. Anyways food was fanatic. Went after hitting the gym so I was starving. Got everything lol"}
{"text":"Yeay!! I finally got to try Shake Shack!  Albeit not in NYC where I saw it and wanted to go but the lines there were absurd.

Las Vegas built a Shake Shack in New York New York (makes sense), in the new addition of central park area.  I heard that for like 3 weeks after this opened, the lines were similar to NYC's lines but when we were there, the line was not bad at all.

I ordered the Smokestack (burger with cheese, smoked bacon and chopped smoked cherry peppers) and fries.

Everything was delicious.  I feel l like Shake Shack better that In & Out but I'll need to go again to make sure before I rule In & Out uncrowned as best fast food burger. :)


Definitely check this place out!  I will be trying the one in NYC next to make sure quality is standard!"}
{"text":"As much as I love In-N-Out, I have to admit that Shake Shack is better all around. The fries, the hamburger meat, the cheese, the frozen custard shake are made of quality ingredients and deserve recognition. Price point is higher for that very reason. I'm so addicted to the perfect fries! Cheese lovers can order a side of cheese dip to keep the fries crisp. The shackburger left me wanting more. The shroomburger and the chicken sandwich are also amazing!"}
{"text":"Not sure I understand what the big deal about this place is. It was pretty expensive for a rather small burger, and fries were nothing out of the ordinary--they reminded me the krinkle-cut fries served at my school's dining commons, which is to really emphasize how ordinary they are. I ordered the smokeshack burger, which was very disappointing because the peppers in it did not go well with the rest of the burger, in my opinion. At least the line moved quickly even though it was fairly long. But overall, I wouldn't care to spend so much money on a burger again when I can get a better deal and better taste at In N Out."}
{"text":"OMG! Best. Burgers. Ever. Why did I not know this place existed?! Burgers and bacon cheesy fries are great, service is fast and friendly. Lots of room to sit inside and out. Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I am a SoCal girl, so I'm loyal to In n Out, but Shake Shack was definitely good. I thought the burger was okay, but their fries and custard are amazing! They serve crinkle style fries which is might sound unappetizing because it can remind you of those elementary school days, but they are so crispy and soft. Unlike In n Out, these fries are still good even after 20 minutes so you don't have to down them as soon as you get them. It is on the pricey side, especially when the same meal at In n Out is around $6. I ordered the hamburger with special sauce, fries, and a lemonade and the total was around $11. Overall, if you're in the area, I really recommend this place especially because it is one of the cheaper places in Vegas."}
{"text":"Burger taste like a hybrid between McDonald's and Wendy's; not good. Shake was okay. You would expect better tasting food for the price one pays for a Shake burger."}
{"text":"Prelims: not really a shack and they're more than just about shakes. My wife told me about this place and my first instinct was to be really confused why a burger joint would be called shake shack. The interior is a bit crowded (probably because of all the fricking PEOPLE that are all up in this joint) but there are lots of tables and chairs, even outside. It's located in New York New York (because this shack started in NY - probably the one place they could fit a restaurant) and it's outside in a humongous sign so it's very easy to see. Like most fast food joints, there isn't really a service other than getting your food, which took a little bit, but goddam was it worth it.

My wife and I ordered the burger and fries, along with a salted caramel hot chocolate (hey, I asked if she wanted a shake...and she wanted the hot chocolate. So the review has the hot chocolate. And not the shake. From Shake Shack...). The burger was unimaginably delicious. The umami, mixed with the beautiful acidity of the ketchup, the crispness of the vegetables, the soft and oh-so-buttery and flaky brioche bun, all combining to drop an absolute bomb of flavor in my mouth. The only disappointing thing was that the burger was a bit small so I ended up inhaling only half (between my wife and I) and I wanted more and more and more. In retrospect, I should have said to hell with what we had planned and to eat here instead. The fries were crinkle cut (my favorite!!!!) and super crispy with a deliciously flaky potato center. This meal was exactly what I want to eat. And it blows that it's all the way in Vegas!

TL;DR Damn good burgers. Shake Shack is better than In-N-Out. Burn me."}
{"text":"Love this burger. It can be a bit salty at times, but I gotta say it's all about the meat to bun ratio! The meat has great crust and texture and amazing flavor!! I gotta say that the bun is the hook line and sinker!! Fluffy and chewy, yet strong enough to hold the burger together so not to make a mess."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger place.

We stopped in here after the movies and were generally impressed. I had the Double Smoked, with bacon which was very, very good; while my wife had the Single. We would agree with Betsy B's husband's take, that the Single was kind of small.  

The burgers reminded me of Steak 'n Shake in the Midwest, but with a lot less grease, or even Culver's Butter Burger. We ordered some Fries and shared a large drink. The Fries were okay, but nothing special.  I believe Smashburger is hard to beat in this area. 

At the end of our meal, we sort of thought the same thing. Good burger place, but was it better than say, Habit Burger, In 'n Out, or Smashburger?  Was it worth the price?  

Ah, tough one. I would give Shake Shack Three and a Half Stars. But there's a lot of good burger places in the area now to choose from. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU.  I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU.

Okay, now that I have professed my undying love for Shake Shack, we can continue on. 

It is no surprise that this place is as popular as its NYC roots because they really do take quality into consideration to deliver the same kind of Shack Burger I would expect on 86th & Lexington or MSG. I love everything about Shake Shack, but mostly their burgers. I've had pretty much everything on the menu, but still think their single shack burger is the perfect food for hangover Vegas (as well as anytime Vegas really ...)

I'm a huge fan, and the line isn't as long as some NYC places so A+!"}
{"text":"Tasty burger joint. A bit expensive for burger and fries though. I had the smoke stack, didn't realize it didn't come with produce though. I'd come here again just for the fries alone! Burger was tasty and the coffee milk shake was mediocre."}
{"text":"Omg used to live in AZ and was visiting from Chicago. Best place ever. Won't go to AZ without getting my Shake Shack burger!!!!"}
{"text":"After all the hype I was disappointed. The servers were nice, the decor is nice, the burger was tasty...but was that the baby size? Seriously the burger size is stupid small. The krinkle cut fries were just ok. Nice they serve beer but Five Guys kills them on food quality for a burger."}
{"text":"On the Las Vegas Strip right between New York, New York and the Monte Carlo is Shake Shack. People confuse it a lot of the times with Steak 'n' Shake--don't make that mistake. These two places are completely different.

The burgers at this place don't come with fries. And they're much smaller. And they're more expensive. 

Upon looking at the menu, I saw that the SmokeShack burger (a cheeseburger with bacon) is $7 for a single and $9.50 for a double! I figure the burgers must be fairly big to justify such a price--even in Vegas.

They weren't. I ordered the double, but this thing was insultingly small. Oh, and when I asked what kind of cheese they can put on it besides American, the lady said that's all they have. Really? It's basically not even real cheese!

But despite all that, bites one and two were surprisingly good. I was digging it. The bun was actually really fluffy and buttery. And the meat--which was of pretty good quality--covered up the whole bun without any excess bread at the end. But the more I ate, the more the fake-cheesiness got to me. If it wasn't for the bacon to somewhat balance it out, it would have been a much more miserable experience--for nearly $10. And I was still hungry afterwards.

My fiancee had the Shack-cago Dog at a more reasonable price of $4. This one was actually really good, too. It was your classic Chicago-style hotdog with a nice peppery kick. Oh, and the french fries were addicting as well.

If you don't know good burgers, you might like this place. But after going to other \"faster food\" burger places, like Fuddruckers or Steak 'n' Shake, this place is a step above Five Guys and a step below In-n-Out (although the meat was better here). And I've gotten pretty tired of In-n-Out already."}
{"text":"Had the single Shake Shack and Shroom. Both were juice and flavorful.  Crinkle cut fries are also good as is the Christmas Cookie Shake. 
We are use to eating Habit or In n Out . Didn't think this would compare but I'd say better than those 2.  Service from order to pickup was about 5 minutes. Price is good for Strip location, less than Johnny Rockets or most food court offerings and far better quality."}
{"text":"So happy to have this location in Charlotte. .. centrally located in the Park Road Shopping Center. Just as good as the ones I remember from out of state"}
{"text":"Eh, it's ok. 
Let me elaborarate. It's not as good as in n out. Sorry.  But it is way better than white castle. Hubby and I were craving a fast meal and didn't want to get back in the car again after our 3 hr drive into Vegas. I got the Smoked Shack and he got the Shackago Dog, split some regular fries and a vanilla shake. Total was about $20. The burger was good although a little on the small side and I actually preferred my hubs' hot dog, although he didn't like it because it was nothing like the dog he had at Wrigley's Field. Umm yeah, that thing was a beast, this dog was like Lil beast jr. Vanilla shake was good and it's kinda hard to mess up crinkle cut fries. In all, too much money for just ok food. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this Shake Shack location. I may be biased since I'm from LA, but I will always choose In N Out over Shake Shack. I think it is over hyped - the food isn't that great and it is over priced.

We came here because my friends have never tried it before. The place already had a line outside by 11:10 AM when it opened at 11 AM. The menu isn't anything out of the ordinary - burgers, fries, shakes, etc. My usual Shake Shack order consists of a Shack Burger (single patty) and cheese fries. What I really like about the Shack Burger is their bun! It's slightly sweet and unbelievably soft. The burger is simple - lettuce, tomato, patty, and their famous Shack sauce which reminds me of the spread from In N Out. The downside to this burger is that it's pretty small and much more $$$ compared to In N Out's. This burger isn't anything mind blowing.  

The fries are crinkle cut fries which aren't my favorite to begin with. There is a pile of melted cheese on top which is good at first but can get tiring towards the end. It's a lot of cheese even for me and I love cheese lol. I definitely have to share this with someone because it is a lot of cheese flavor. 

What really got to me here is their water. It had a funky smell and taste to it.... I got a soda instead because I had a hard time drinking the water here."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed burgers at this Shake Shack on four occasions now, spaced a few months apart.  Each time I re-remember why I lack motivation to go here often.  In a word:  Value.  Specifically, poor value.  When I order a fast-food double burger and small coke for over $13, I have certain expectations.  I expect something markedly better that I could get at half that price at a number of other burger joints (In-N-Out, Carls, Farmer Boys, Smash Burger, Freddy's, etc.), and at Shake Shack I don't get that.  It's something on the scale of a double-cheeseburger at McDonald's.  So...it will probably be a few months before I go again and have forgotten that I feel slightly ripped off every time - which is fairly easy to do, because I love the way their burgers taste.  Please note that I'm not complaining about absolute dollars spent, as I'm not actually price sensitive.  It's just a value thing...and SS stretches my tolerance to the max with their tiny but delicious offerings."}
{"text":"After all the hype, I would say that the Shake Shake is much ado about nothing. The portions are small, the prices high, and the wait was long. Rehab Burger is superior and not more expensive. I've had comparable food at In and Out and Habit for half the price."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the service is so fast and very impressive. The employees were very nice and we were given free custard. I'm very very happy with my experience and will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I was iffy on coming to this location at first because of the negative reviews. I had a great experience here! It was my first time here and I couldn't decide on what I wanted. I think the cashier's name was AJ? I think that's what I remembered reading on the receipt. He was extremely helpful and super friendly! Me and my boyfriend both got the smoke shack and the double down fries! We enjoyed our food and thought it was delicious. I love how their double down fries has crinkled cut fries. It was a little on the pricier side but I'd rather eat here than all the expensive buffets I tried in Las Vegas. I wish we would've gone here sooner!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Shake Shack yet, you really need to! These guys know what they're doing. And actually... if you want an idea of the type of burger to expect go search for the video the Shake Shack owner did with Tasty. 

The menu is fairly small, but definitely not minimalistic like In-and-Out. There's a handful of burgers to choose from, but I really would recommend the classic Shack Burger. When you're ready though... their Shroom Burger is a cheese-stuffed portobello in place of a patty. I can't say you'll be ready to go vegetarian, but for a few brief moments you'll probably forget there's any other kind of burger. The more I think about it, go with a friend and get one Shack Burger and one Shroom Burger to split and try them both. (And yes, you CAN get a Shroom with a burger patty added, I think it's called a Shroom Stack, but I've been scared so I haven't tried it... I'm just not there yet, ok?)

Lastly, the shakes are... well in my opinion, good. I wasn't floored or anything though. I guess I don't know what I was expecting of a shake from a place called Shake Shack, but they ARE good. Maybe I'm just not a big shake guy? And the fries? Well... they're crinkle cut so there you go. 
There's really nothing else to say about fries once you divulge they're crinkle cut because all crinkle cut fries are exactly the same. But the great thing about crinkle cut fries is that you know immediately (before trying them) whether you like them or not... because they all taste the same. So if you love crinkle cut fries, you'll love these! They taste like crinkle cut fries! Me... not so much. 

Try this place! It's awesome."}
{"text":"I recently had the pleasure of trying Shake Shack at this location for the first time last week. I was aware of the Shake Shack vs. In-N-Out Burger for awhile but being from North Carolina I was never able to try both. I must say, Shake Shack definitely lived up to expectations. The atmosphere of the restaurant was pretty laid back, it was packed and seemed to be a mix of locals and tourists. I ordered a standard burger but asked for it well done, which they got perfectly right, even putting a well done sticker it. The burger was delicious, fresh, the toppings were fresh as well and the bun was buttery and complimented the burger nicely. I also got a \"concrete\"which is a custard with two mix ins, chocolate toffee and chocolate truffle cookie dough. Unfortunately, the cashier must've messed it up and instead of truffle cookie dough I had some unidentifiable and not pleasing topping instead. Despite that mix up, the vanilla custard I could taste was absolutely incredible, the best custard I've ever had, so rich and flavorful! I had to return my last night in Vegas for another and this time they did get the order correct and the chocolate truffle cookie dough was to die for! I wish we had Shake Shack in NC!"}
{"text":"$20 for a burger fries and shake... GTFO of town with that garbage.   The burger was mediocre,  the shake overpriced,  the fries were fries. I'll save $15 bucks next time and just go to In & out."}
{"text":"Super excited to try Shake Shack this weekend. I had the Smoke Shack; roughly $6 for a single patty, and while the burger was a bit small, all of the flavors were there! Hmmmm. If you're a fan of spice, you should get this! I do regret not ordering something else with lettuce and tomatoes though. Halfway through the burger, that bacon started getting really salty, and there was nothing to balance the flavor.

Next, I ordered a strawberry shake! Hehe... Or my friend did because he was up on gambling and was nice enough to treat me out. Hefty $6~ for a tiny, 3/4 of a pint looking cup. It was very sweet but still sooooo good! And I honestly needed that sweetness to drown the saltiness of the burger. If the burger didn't fill me up, that shake completely hit the spot.

Cheese fries, I hear from my friends, are also very good! $4 for a serving and the cheese is nice and melted.

Around $20 for burgers, fries, and a shake? I don't think it's worth it but when I'm in Vegas I expect myself to splurge anyway. But yeah, size to price ratio is completely terrible. If not to try at least once, come here for the shake! THAT SHAKE IS REALLY REALLY GOOD."}
{"text":"It's ok, but compared to in-n-out, not even close. Plus it's twice the price and can take just as long or longer. Not bad, but I'm a tad tired of paying $10 for a fast food burger n fries."}
{"text":"definitely did NOT live up to the hype!! I usually pass this place driving down the strip, and always see a line outside the door. decided to skip the club on Friday night, so we decided to finally give this place a try. the line wasn't long at all in comparison to all the other times I've seen it packed. yet it took FOREVER to get our food. 

we ordered the regular single stack shackburger, the smokeshack burger, and cheese fries. it was all very average. nothing special. the cheese on the fries was overwhelming, instantly regretted not getting regular fries. I'm not sure if it was because we were hungover, but the smokeshack burger was waaayyy too heavy. it has smoked bacon, chopped red chiles all smothered in sauce. #nothanks. the plain regular burger was the only thing we were able to finish, the lettuce & tomatoes tasted really fresh. 

had in-n-out before we headed out back to los angeles, nothing compares. really."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was good. Atmosphere was excellent. Clean and attentive. Fun for the kids. Don't know if we will be back the prices are a bit higher then we expected. C'mon 50 cents for whipped cream??"}
{"text":"I came here the last time I was in Las Vegas, I actually stopped at In N Out in Hesperia, CA to compare them on the same day. I like the beef it seemed fresh but that was it. The fries looked like they were out a bag. I'll stick to In N Out"}
{"text":"Fantastic  I loved it here! The burger was amazing, the beef was fresh, the bun was soft!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed on my recent visit here. I ordered their Shack burger well done which comes with (cheddar cheese, tomatoe, lettuce and option of pickles or onion). 
The pattie was not warm at all and the overall taste of the meat was dull. I paid almost $20 for 2 burgers (Shack burger and another which comes with bacon) 1 crinkle fries, & a drink. For that price or maybe even less I can go down to Smash Burger to get a better tasting meal."}
{"text":"Wow shake shack takes care of their customers and take their brand seriously. Makes me think twice about the company. Great customer care!"}
{"text":"Pricey but really good!  The only downside was that they were out of the Road Shack Burger they were advertising and that it is so packed it's hard to find seating. I ordered a Smoke Shack, Christmas Cookie Shake and fries. Everything was good!!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is amazing and also how quickly they process customers! After the Iron Maiden concert Monday night, a crowd of starving heavy metal fans descended on Shake Shack. Line out the door but a very nice young lady helping the throng figure out where to line up. (I saw this same staff member later emptying trash and picking up towering loads of empty trays, definitely a multi-tasker!) 

The cashiers were getting people rung up quickly and they have a pager system to tell you when your order is ready. Everyone was calm and efficient - they really have some good processes in place!

Cheese fries with bacon A+
Hotdog A+
Shakes and floats A+

What made the hot dog extra delicious was they split it and grilled it flat, so more crispy grilled flavor! This place is a great addition to the Strip and they're open late!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place and needed a break from shopping in order to stop my stomach from grumbling. 

I had a fries with cheese and added bacon.  I also had a strawberry shake.  I ordered fries with cheese for my companion and almost spent twenty dollars.  That was a bit of a sticker shock!  

The cheese sauce on the fries was better than most.  It was creamier and had a combination of a couple of cheeses. There still wasn't enough to cover all fries and I found the remaining fries a bit salty. 

The shake was good but not what I expected.  My granddaughter drank most of it.There is one fast food place that I can think of that has a better shake than Shake Shack and this was a bit disappointing considering the name of the establishment.  

The service was prompt and helpful.  The food is good. My point would be if you want more \"bang for your buck\" you may want to try someplace else in Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"Just had Shake shack for the first time wow what a delicious hamburger and shake would come back again hopefully they open some in the Los Angeles orange county"}
{"text":"I don't understand how people can compare this place to In & Out. The quality of food is night and day compared to In and Out.

In and Out is equivalent to McDonalds.

Shake Shack is more of a hipster joint. Most people go there because the food tastes great and there are people like myself that will go there because their meat is humanely raised, 100% angus beef, vegetarian fed, and no hormones or antibiotics. 

People are saying that the burgers are over priced compared to In and Out? I just answered why you're paying more. Quality ingredients means more food cost for the restaurant which means more money out of your pocket.  People go to Whole Foods even though their prices are high because they sell food as God intended us to eat. The same goes for Shack Shake. People go there with peace in mind that what they are eating is REAL food and because it tastes great. 

If you're concerned about your wallet, then go to In And Out and eat burgers that Monsanto and other GMO corporations want you to eat. 

***I love the hot dogs here***"}
{"text":"I was so excited when Shake Shack came to the valley. Had the for the first time in an airport. It's nice to have the chicken hot dog option. I was a bit disappointed that they no longer have the spicy chicken sandwich but the original is just as delicious! The crinkle fries are always hot and fresh, but I think I'll skip the cheese sauce next time. I didn't like the consistency. I also ordered a strawberry milkshake which met my expectations."}
{"text":"And on to Monday dinner.

Originally came out here Sunday afternoon, but with a line out the door and not moving in light rain, I decided to go elsewhere.

Stopped back in on Monday evening late (again, around 9pm), and placed my order. I ordered the \"Smoke Stack\" (with bacon) and just got their regular ShackBurger, which is what I was charged for, so I can't argue.

Also got their fries and a chocolate shake.

A very basic, very greasy burger. Nowhere near the top of the list of burgers I have eaten; I was extremely disappointed that I didn't go back to Burger Bar as I had planned. Heck, In n Out would have been a better meal than this.

The shake and the fries were just OK as well, and the service was good.

Now, I can say I've tried this place, and will head to more promising restaurants in the future."}
{"text":"I think what I got here was better than what I ordered in NYC, so that may be part of the reason why I like this place better. I definitely love how it just fits in Vegas with the sign in bright lights. When we lined up, there was hardly anyone in line, so we go to order right away. We had to wait a bit for our food, but luckily we weren't starving by the time we got there. 

FOOD & DRINK: the chicken sandwich is really tasty. I would choose it over the chicken sandwich at Chick-Fil-A even though it's a close call between the two. The prices are pretty reasonable. And they do serve alcohol. I also got a side of fries and a black&white shake. One person in my group did not like the shake after he tried mine. I thought it was okay but definitely on the extra sweet side. I got cheese fries and I liked how they were crispy even with the cheese on top. Still would choose In-n-out fries over these fries, but the chicken sandwich reigned supreme above all the chicken burgers I've tried in that price range. 

ATMOSPHERE: they have a TV playing sports! It was great especially since it's playoffs season. There was plenty of seating and it was overall very clean. The bathroom had a single sink and two stalls, so if it gets busy that's probably where you would have to wait the longest. The bathroom though was pretty clean. I liked how there was outdoor seating. Since it was mid-April, the weather was perfect for sitting outside. 

Satisfaction rating: *Two thumbs up*"}
{"text":"The burgers are awesome.  I don't think these should be compared with in n out as  these burgers are different in that they melt in your mouth.  Overall great service.  The employees and manager were great.  They put forth extra effort to help us when we made a mistake on our order.  

Con: burger is smaller than normal and cost.  I find you almost have to buy two burgers to fill me up."}
{"text":"Good place but over hyped and expensive. Had a lot of great burgers in this town and this is middle of the pack. Smash burger is better in my opinion."}
{"text":"My wife and I just tried Shake Shake for the first time and wow are we disappointed! We wanted delivery so we used Door Dash and everything we ordered was incorrect and ice cold. I can forgive the lettuce that they added even though we requested none but the diced onions on the hot dog meant scrapping off all the relish and celery salt. So disappointing, as was the custard. When we called the restaurant to speak with the manager, we were once again disappointed as there was only an answering machine, who does that!! We will wait and see if we get a call back. For this price the serving size was terrible as was the overall experience. Want to like them but right now, it a no."}
{"text":"Burger tried:
- SmokeShack
- Fries

It took my second trip to Shake Shack before I could give a fair review of their burgers. 

On a previous trip I had tried their Shack Burger and that I thought was rather a let down. 

This time around I came in starving and went straight for the double SmokeShack and fries. The SmokeShack comes with smoked bacon, cheese, two patties, and shack sauce. 

While the burger was good, I feel it could benefit from some lettuce, tomatoes and pickles to cut the richness of all that cheese and protein. I confirmed that their but remains lackluster in my honest opinion. The buns would make the burger better if it were toasted. 

The fries were also just ok. They seem like your ordinary crinkle cut fries (similar to Del Taco's) and didn't leave me feeling they were spectacular. While they are good, I would say they are just average. 

If you've never tried definitely give Shake Shack a try. See how it compares to your favorite burger for yourself."}
{"text":"Hamburgers taste like your backyard burger, pretty good although a little greasy.  Of course I am comparing to \"In N Out burger\" where you get that same great taste and their sauce can't be beat. 
French fries were a pre-frozen Kringle fry they were just ok. 
The premium root beer and lemonade were delicious,"}
{"text":"\"Is this place better than In-n-out?\" Nope, no way. I'm not sure what all the hype is about this place. The burgers and options are okay, but way overpriced and really soggy?! Shakes are also meh. For $5+ shake, I expect a little more presentation or memorable flavor, got neither. Only thing I really liked were the crispy fries. Overall, it's whatever."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers and shakes. Decent price for the strip, but we only stopped in to eat a snack. So we split a burger, fries and strawberry shake and were happy when we left."}
{"text":"Burger was subpar and the fries were cold, didn't expect this from a newer place!  I may try again."}
{"text":"Finally got to try it when I went to Vegas.  We ordered 2 ShackBurger, Chick'n Shack, and a shake.  I wouldn't say it's to die for since but I wouldn't say it's bad."}
{"text":"Here's the deal; it's okay. They have a tried and true menu with burgers and other stuff on bread. There's beer and wine, along with the desserts.

This is a fast casual place, but no self service soda, like every other place. A place like this ought to have a drive thru.

Is there a Freddy's Frozen Custard bear you? Just as good, but cheaper and a drive thru. No booze, though."}
{"text":"After ordering, the food is ready within ten minutes. The food is very good, but watch your wallet - the price can add up quickly if you aren't careful. Get a shake or a dessert if it's your first time to get the full experience, and of course the classic Shake Shack Though the burger may seem small, it fills you up just the same as any other. There is a lot of seating inside and outside, and the arrangement is clearly set up for groups to enjoy together."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time with my boyfriend today! He got the shroom burger and I got the smoke shack! We also got fries, cheese fries, small coke and I tried the new hot coco shake which was really good! My boyfriend loved the burger as I did with mine. The cheese fries were not so much to our liking the cheese was a little different than expected but overall the food was very good. It caught us by surprise on the prices though $34 For just the two of us... everything is separately ordered which is alright but wow made us feel like we were eating on the strip!! Oh and another thing I'd like to mention is the hockey puck game table just doesn't seem like the right pick for the location as it causes A LOT of noise! It was starting to give us a
Headache as it was so loud in the room echoing! Luckily you guys have tables outside otherwise we would of just taken our food to go at that point! But I really wanted to enjoy a meal at a place other than home before we welcome our baby boy in a couple Days !"}
{"text":"We got the double stack and strawberry milkshake.  The shake was pretty good.  The burger was small and greasy looking but didn't taste too bad.  They throw a bunch of salt on the patty which makes it kinda salty versus \"seasoned\".  Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Great burgers, best crinkle cut fries I've ever had and awesome shakes. This place doesn't shy away from flavor. There's so much in everything they make. They also have a solid beer on tap made specifically for them. I really encourage everyone to try the mushroom burger. There's so much melty cheese on this thing it's crazy. Eat here. It's not trying to compete with In-N-Out so stop trying to make that a thing. They do different things and they both do them well. Which you choose depends on your mood."}
{"text":"Yum. Everything here is full of yum. My fiancè and I had the Smoke Shack and Shack Stack burgers with a side of fries. Both burgers were great. The Smoke Shack has pickled peppers on it that add a tangy flavor that goes really well with the savory burger and bacon. The Shack Stack has the amazing cheese-filled portobello mushroom on top of the burger. It oozes cheese every time you bite it and it's awesome. We were also really happy with the crinkle cut fries. That style of fry can get soggy, but these were crisp from start to finish and they were seasoned really well. The only downsides are the prices you pay for a restaurant located on the strip. They're inflated because of the location, but any idiot knows you pay more on the strip. So you can't complain about it. If you want lower prices eat away from the strip."}
{"text":"Wow my new fav casual & quick burger joint (insert heart eyes). I saw tons of Shake Shacks in Washington DC when I went some few summers ago but never got the chance to try out their food! I go to Vegas often and was thrilled to see that they finally opened one right on The Strip! It's located right outside of New York New York by the bridge. You can either order inside or outside the restaurant. Outside would probably be quicker if you're not looking to actually sit down and properly dine somewhere cool. My party and I decided to eat inside since it was summer in Vegas.... AKA 100 degrees and up. 

There is a large menu plastered up front right when you walk in the restaurant. You then wait in line for your turn to order at the front also. Then they give you a buzzer so you can go retrieve your tray of food when it's ready. The line was long when I went but it moved by quickly! Although it was crazy busy, the cashier who helped me was fun & patient, but was also efficient! You can get water and condiments on the side by the registers. You have to find your own table! They have lounge areas near the back of the restaurant and also regular tables. 

I got the single shack burger which is just a regular cheeseburger with lettuce and tomatoes. It was delicious! They have their very own sauce that makes the burger taste kind of buttery, but not too overwhelming with butter. The cheese fries are to die for. Their cheese sauce is really perfection!!! Usually when I order cheese fries from other places, the cheese gets tiring and hardens up quickly, but with Shake Shack's cheese sauce..... Holy moly I'm craving it. Their crinkle cut fries were also really good, with or without cheese! I also got the black and white shake- it was so so. It tasted more like a chocolate shake to me; I'm not really into any type of chocolate dessert by itself so I didn't really like it. 

Nonetheless, Shake Shack is the place to go if you want a nice affordable burger in Vegas."}
{"text":"Overpriced, negligible burgers and the fries were gross. I guess you have to grow up on the East coast to enjoy cheese wiz. That was such a disappointment. I don't understand anyone who thinks Shake Shack is any match for In-n-Out or Five Guys."}
{"text":"Hands down the best fast food burger.  I dream of them.  Not only that though - the chicken sandwich is a-m-a-z-i-n-g!  I still can't figure out why I'm overweight.  I guess it shall remain a mystery."}
{"text":"Boo! I've been to the Shake Shack in NYC which was one of the best burgers I've had. In NYC I was allowed to order my burger medium rare.

I came to this Vegas branch and I was so excited to have another Shake Shack burger. I ordered my burger medium rare but I was told they only can do medium well (the order taker was very nice,btw). Unfortunately, I told her sorry I wouldn't be dining there.

Please bring back medium rare!"}
{"text":"I hate to admit it, but Shake Shack is up there with In n Out. I love the flavor and consistency. I really hate to compare the two, but they are both great in their own ways. I love both of them equally and for different reasons. Because I live in SoCal, where we have an abundance of In n Outs, I crave Shake Shack more. I can't wait for Shake Shack to open closer to home!"}
{"text":"My must stop place in Vegas. Thanks to the Shack Shake app I didn't have to wait in line. Received my order promptly at the scheduled time and I was swiftly off to enjoying my food. Everything was on point."}
{"text":"It was surprisingly delicious. Decent prices. Will definitely have to stop for a fix next Vegas trip"}
{"text":"I've had several missed opportunities of going to Shake Shack in Vegas, so I was on a mission to try Shake Shack on my trip to AZ. After exploring Papago park, my friends and I headed to this Phoenix location.

I ordered the single ShackBurger, a side of bacon and cheese fries, and the ShackMeister Ale. For a standard cheeseburger, the ShackBurger was excellent. The bun was soft like a brioche, but it held together very well. I noticed that the bun wasn't sliced all the way through, so that may be part of the reason why the burger didn't slop around and fall apart. The burger wasn't messy either, so the bread didn't get soggy. I couldn't put my finger on what was in the ShackSauce, but it was good. The burger was juicy and packed on flavor. I totally enjoyed the bacon and cheese fries. I hate the kind of nacho cheese sauce that comes out of a can, but I could tell that the cheese sauce used on the fries was a mixed blend of better quality cheeses. I was a huge fan of Shake Shack's crinkle cut fries in general. 

My biggest regret is not being able to have Shake Shack whenever I want. It could never replace In n Out for me, but it's certainly better than Smashburger. Why isn't there a Shake Shack in the Bay Area? Please come to San Jose."}
{"text":"This place is TRULY the BEST Burger place in the world. Since there is no Shake Shack in Northern California I always make sure to visit while I'm in Las Vegas. The Smoke Shack burger and Cheese Fries are my go to. Shakemeister Ale and Shake Shacks wine goes great with all meals as well. I highly recommend this place, The burgers are always juicy and flavorful, Never dry and dull."}
{"text":"Put this place on my list to try out next time in Vegas. Place was getting hype all over the media when they opened this location.

Friend in town had eaten here a couple days before I went. He wasn't impressed, but I was going to try it anyway. Everybody has different tastes, right?

Well, he was pretty much right on his opinion. Not a huge line at mid afternoon, but it was almost to the door inside. Ordering was pretty quick tho. Got the shake burger, with cheese and bacon added. Order of cheese fries, and a drink, not big on shakes, but in hindsight should'a checked one out.

Took almost 20 minutes for my order. Don't have to worry about overeating here, burger, fries, especially the drink (counter fills on all soda, so no self serve, but I did notice they do free refills if you go back to counter) were all on the small side.

Burger tasted good, no real complaints, but I don't think it was anything out of the ordinary. The cheese sauce on the fries at least had a good flavor, but it would have been nice if the sauce had covered all the fries. Fries are frozen crinkle cut, and while they were done good, crispy, they're frozen. I figured a place like this would be doing fresh cut. Soda cup was about 3-4 good swigs. I can appreciate the free refills, but wow, get bigger cups already. Like drinking out of a glorified dixie cup.

I dunno, almost $14 for the meal. I realize it's Vegas, and it's the strip, but it wasn't good enough I would consider coming back in next trip. Is this what New Yorker's consider a cult worthy hamburger joint?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late evening snack.  This location, like most Shake Shacks, gets very busy.  Order a Chicago Dog for myself with a coffee shake and a hamburger for my companion.  It took a while to get the food.  Seating was available.

I got annoyed when I picked up my food.  The buzzer went off and I went to the pick up area.  The girl had the food on the side and was busy flirting with some guy and completely ignored me and the next customer who's food was ready.

The food was good and the place remarkably clean for how busy it is."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and I did enjoy! Nice place to go for a quick,  good meal. Next time I will try the chicken sandwhich"}
{"text":"The burgers here are delicious and I love the fries too.  I haven't had any of their shakes but I've heard that they are great."}
{"text":"Don't listen to the haters, buy into the hype here because this place is real. I'm going to say this now, this place is better than any other fast food chain burger I've had. 

Okay so let me delve into this. The burgers here are simple but incredibly well done. They also use a potato bun that adds more consistency and texture to the bun and gives you a feeling of eating more. Also when I judge a burger, it's my personal opinion to also judge the main accompaniment, the fries. I usually am not a fan of crinkle cut fries but my glob do they do it well here. A good portion that's salted just right with a great amount of crisp to it. I've been to shake shack five times in the last 6 weeks and I haven't seen a fry ever not fried enough or burnt, it's always perfect, I have no clue how they do it. 

So what do I get? Well I do have a preference. I've tried their mushroom shack which is too overwhelmingly cheesy for me. It's a large portobello mushroom filled with several types of melted cheese. Maybe that's your thing, just know that it's a lot of cheese. My friend usually gets that with a regular patty in one bun (aka shack stack). This is my personal order: hamburger with bacon and a chicken patty as well. Oh my god is it heaven. For a burger place they know how to make an incredibly good fried chicken patty. Honestly it might be better than their actual burger. But that just might be me.

They also have pretty interesting desserts called concretes which is frozen custard. I think this part of the menu along with drinks rotates to give it some variety so be aware! Anyway Shake Shack is great and I want you all to absolutely love it as much as I do. Go and see the light!"}
{"text":"First time at Shake Shack for us and we weren't disappointed.

We aimed to order a variety of stuff so we went with single and double cheeseburgers, a Chicago dog, cheese fries and a pitcher of beer.

Understanibly the place was extremely busy, noisy and the employees were all over the place trying to clean and serve. We lucked out and was able to get a seat inside to avoid the heat. The food came out rather quickly. While the burgers were 'good', sadly their fries left much to be desired. The ice cold beer and Chicago dog saved the day. 

Overall, I liked? the food and would like to go back one day. However, with White Castle, Nathan's and a plethora of other choices down the strip, I wouldn't wait in a long line again."}
{"text":"Came to this place to try it out since Jim Gaffigan seems to be a big fan. Nothing special. Burgers were like a mix of Sonic and Steak and Shake but with a longer wait. The chocolate milkshakes had a strange flavor but the brownie batter shake was more enjoyable."}
{"text":"For national cheeseburger day there was a deal on DoorDash for a free cheeseburger at Shake Shack. Upon check out use prompt code SHACK. Free delivery and free burger, just remember to tip your driver. Good burgers and options available to customize, bun or not, tomato, lettuce, sauce and well done or not.

Thank you Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"So glad Shake Shack has come to Vegas! Came here for lunch with a group of friends and came back again for a late night burger. My vegetarian friend said the 'Shroom Burger was one of the best burgers he's had. If you are a meat-eater, get the Shack Stack. It will not disappoint. And if you're going to order fries, make it with cheese. The frozen custard is delicious and the shakes are also a win. You pretty much can't go wrong eating here. Space is limited so you'll probably have to hover over a table to snag it."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food here is amazing.  

I had a chance to visit this location when I was in Las Vegas a few weeks ago.  The place is very clean, the staff is friendly and the food here is always good.  

My favorite is the chicken and the fries are super yummy.  Also make sure you try the frozen custard.  

The manager even came out while I was eating and asked how we're doing or needed anything.

Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Being my first time to Shake Shack.... I personally really enjoyed it!!! I love them crinkly fries! Add some cheese and I am happy or even with some bacon. 

I've always heard about shake shack and knew that they are a east coast burger joint where in-n-out is the well known west coast burger joint. But slowly these chains spread across the states. Sadly, Hawaii doesn't have such deliciousness and if we do.. they charge us an arm for it.. Oh the struggle.

Although on the strip they had a shake shack next to the hotel I was staying at, we decided to come here since my friend had to work around the area. This shake shack is located on the outside of a mall. 

My friend and I shared a Shake Stack Burger, double down fries (which was big as my head or bigger), I got a single concrete and he got a shake. That burger was so good... the cheese melted on top of the patty and the bun was just right.. Don't you hate when your bun is bigger than the patty ratio.. well this doesn't happen here! I liked my single concrete (it's ice cream or frozen custard.. I'm not sure.) My friend didn't think the shake was that great.

Glad that we shared, we didn't know the fries was gonna be huge when we were ordering. We had a big dinner to look forward to also. Phew! It was so good but I couldn't finish, thankfully he finished it all."}
{"text":"Excellent quality, great atmosphere, delicious food. Get the cheese sauce for you fries!"}
{"text":"The only reasons for the loss of the star would be the small Patty size and the price. Those are the only things I can point to as a critique. Did I  feel ripped off? No! Would I return considering the price? Yes!

We spent almost $40 for 3 burgers, 2 fries, 3 drinks,  and a shake  And it was Amazing!  Worth every penny.  This is not your average burger, nor your average service.  The employees actually listened, and were friendly.  The concern for our experience was shown by the front counter, the person who handed us the order, and the manager who checked on us. 

It is a rare place today where they work so hard to put out a great product, smile, and make sure everything is perfect. I will pay for that!  Anytime."}
{"text":"I checked in to Shake Shack while walking up to the door.  It just closed.  I was getting my Rodney Dangerfield moment.  I could see guest inside and I couldn't get it.  The staff ignored us and didn't give us the courtesy to tell us that they were closed.  I sign on the outside said that we just missed coming in by 2 minutes.  I could see that menu consisted of basic American fare, perfect for a late night snack.  But they don't stay open all night.  Bummer.."}
{"text":"The GOOD: 

-Easy to read and understand menu board 
-Friendly and knowledgeable staff
-Freshness and quality of food was def. present. 
-Well maintained and clean facility 
-Open late Sun-Thur till midnight, Fri-Sat till 2am

The BAD:

-Sweeter than sweet tea and lemonade 
-Not a fan of crinkle cut fries, but hey...

The OVERALL:
-Great value for what you get
-Packed with Flavor
-Convenient location w/outdoor seating 
-Hands down my new In N Out
-Complimentary water at the condiment station shall you need to water down the sweet drinks."}
{"text":"Good burger and great location. Doesn't quite match NYC in Madison Park but the wait was a lot less time too. We are missing the great white cheese they use in NYC."}
{"text":"First off let me warn you - Las Vegas prices are $$$ and Shake Shack is definitely one of those places that're overpriced. But that doesn't mean the food wasn't good! It was great! I got the Smokestack - and it was perfect, chilies and all! The fries aren't usually the type I'd go for but they came crispy so I was happy. 

I ended up going back in the long queue (which moves pretty quickly) and getting a milkshake (vanilla). The small one is small, so if you're looking to share maybe get a larger one. The shakes are super thick so it's great if you're into frozen custard."}
{"text":"Everything is very tasty, came out quickly and fresh. They need ranch dressing available to dip fries in.
Great location right on the strip. The peppers on the smoke stack were a great touch. Can definitely understand all the hype."}
{"text":"Smoke shack was awesome. The portion sizes were perfect. Quality over quantity is the key :)"}
{"text":"If this place is comparable to in and out sure don't know what the fuss is. I'll stay with Deluxe."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is new to Scottsdale and so far it is a hit! The service is fast and the restaurant is great for kids. I ordered the Shackburger and cheese fries. Both were decent and reasonably priced. The best menu item I tried was the DustDevil Concrete. So good! Wine can be ordered by the glass or the half bottle. This place should be tried at least once!"}
{"text":"I'm really surprised to see so many negative reviews for Shake Shack, especially this location. I am a die hard SS fan & have yet to have a bad meal. I love how simple the menu is, their cheese fries are the absolute best! Service is always top notch and the food comes out quickly, I am a fan for life!"}
{"text":"I'm not being nice on this review! I felt cheated! The tiny burgers and disgusting crinkle fries, and ridiculous a la cart prices gives this place one lousy star. I ordered a $4 grilled cheese for my son and looked at it. It was a bun turned inside out and grilled with disgusting unmelted American cheese in between. There is no kids menu, but they sell dog treats? After $15, I didn't even finish the snack sized burger and fries, I left hungry and ripped off. Go figure. Never again coming here!"}
{"text":"Whoot whoot! Shake shack in vegas! It was good but not as good as the one in new york of course. This place is a lot bigger though! Got the shack burger with the fries. It's definitely worth trying out if you've never had it before."}
{"text":"Really good. I think Shake Shack has the slight edge over In-N-Out. The fries are definitely better but I also think there's more of a freshness and selection. Check out their secret menu online as well. I had the Shack Burger and the Chic n' Stack."}
{"text":"Burger gets 3 stars.  Good bread.  Beef patty was superior to In-N-Out.  Onion was too pungent, however.  But the chocolate/peanut butter shake gets 4 stars.  Beer, 5 stars of course.  For the price, Shake Shack is hard to beat.  But my taste buds are not for sale.  So I cannot in good conscience award the highly coveted 5 stars."}
{"text":"two burgers + two shakes + two cheese fries & 1 hot dog for $39 . . the cheese complimented the fries perfectly! the shrooms on the shack stack are fried and stuffed with more cheese.

we went on a Wednesday afternoon,the line went by fast and we were served about 10 mins after ordering.everything was delicious,would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I feel similar to other reviewers who cannot possibly understand what the hype is about regarding this venue. The burger was small, and I definitely did not like the sauce (In & Out is so much tastier). The chicken sandwich was okay. The fries fine. The shake was nothing I haven't had in the past, and was not overwhelmingly flavorful, in fact is was quite sweet. Perhaps the only good thing about this place is it's location- beautiful outdoor patio seating area, where Modern Steak used to reside. Will not be going here again but needed to provide friends and family with our personal review of our disappointment.

Go to In & Out or Smashburger. You'll be WAY more impressed in the culinary experience."}
{"text":"More like shit shack.  Staff was really nice but we spent twice as much than at in n out and the fries were from a frozen bag.  Also I ended up in the hospital for a week after eating here due to a stomach infection."}
{"text":"Food is just okay. Very expensive for what you get. Terrible value. I'd rather go to The Habit for a fast food burger."}
{"text":"Cali pride means I have to pit this against In n Out right? Well no...because this is in Vegas where there is NO in n out. So given that in mind, how's shake shack's burger? Depends which one- the cheese burger or the steak one? Cheese burger is pretty good, steak burger...got a kick of spice that's unexpected. Onto the fries. Crinkle cut. Just like the kind you had in elementary school. 

When I went, it was so popular they had a bouncer at the door. Also their vibrating thingies look like tasers. 

Best thing: Mary the waitress came around to check up on us, asking if we needed water or napkins. That's unexpected from a chain...5 stars for service!"}
{"text":"Delicious burger with fried portobello mushroom. Loved the hot dog with lots of toppings as well. Can't skip the desserts and beer float either! They also offer dog treats!"}
{"text":"This place is RIDICULOUS!! I literally work at a place somewhere on Green Valley Parkway & I asked my wife (who happened to be here at the shop with me) to go out and get some food. I recommended this place cause, you know... Whatever... This place seems pretty cool. Well first off this place is epic.
She got a grilled cheese and a drink for our son, a burger, a fry and a drink for herself and a burger, drink and fry for me. She came back with a bill of $45. 

I was a little hysterical cause $45 people to eat?? Thats kinda ridiculous. Well i looked at my burger and theres this huge brown weird thing on top of it in between the buns. Like what the hell? Why is there a brown looking fried ball of something on top of my burger?? 

I immediately took it off and like the idiot i am i just smelled it and took a bite completely not knowing what the hell this thing is. I immediately flew from my chair, hit the ground and fell into a guardians of the galaxy or twilight zone tower of terror intergalactic starship troopers abyss of just flavor town that would make GUY literally crap his pants.
This delicious freakin amazing thing that i had taken a bite of was a mushroom and it was perfectly cooked and in addition it was filled with cheese. I immediately ate that burger so fast my boss at work was probably wondering if i just came off a hunger strike. The burger, the mushroom, the cheese, the MILKSHAKE I got... Jesus what the hell is wrong with you guys? Seriously if I'm not paying $100 next time I come in, you're obviously doing something wrong. The burgers are underpriced and that $45 literally slapped me on the back, and gave me patriotism cause THAT was a meal worth the FREEDOM we have to eat it. Literally and they dont need a creepy clown, a bobblehead stick figure, a lame king or even a redhead child from a Stephen King novel to sell it. Just the name.... Jesus between this place and 5 guys (who are cheaper and not as good but who are at least better than the other burger places) i WILL go broke. Thank you so much for that meal, I WILL BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"One of the things I love about Las Vegas - especially on the Strip - is that there is generally a good customer service culture.  We went to Shake Shack for dessert after dinner last night because we were craving some decadent milkshakes.  What better place for some decadent shakes than a place with shake in the name?

We walked up the steps and went through the dessert only line which features a takeout window outside on the patio.  We walked up and received a typical mediocre \"whaddyawant\" fast food greeting.  I ordered my black and white shake and paid my money.  The clerk turned around and grabbed a pre made shake, put it on the counter and said, \"here you go.\"  And just like that - my experience was over.

The shake was ok, but, as expected, it was little melted.  Shake Shack - I expected more, but left disappointed."}
{"text":"Veggie burger is not bad, no vegan options except fries.   Cheese fries are ok. Meat eaters love it.  Vegetarians will be good with veggie burger.  All items a la carte-not cheap for burgers

7 dollars a burger
3-4 for fries

Overall would go again."}
{"text":"Was excited to come but wish I could've gone to Chick-fil-A. I expected more for a six dollar malt. I really don't see the draw. Deep fried chicken sandwich. Mediocre fries. Whole experience. Meh"}
{"text":"Great burger. Much better than in n out. Also the shake is bomb. Love it and would come back for more"}
{"text":"Finally went here during my Vegas trip last week and let me tell you this place is absolutely worth the hype. I didn't mind standing, baking in the heat as the line slowly inched its way forward into the venue. They have a huge menu (literally) put up so you can ponder your order as you approach the cash register. They even have dog friendly options! I ordered the Shack Stack and a side of fries. A friend suggested to get the cheese sauce on the side so I can dip the fries in it, which was a genius idea by the way. I don't like soggy fries. What I didn't realize was that the portobello mushroom was fried, which was a little excessive but the burger was still good. The combination of the patty and mushroom was one I had never tasted before. Very savory and I could barely finish the fries. Next time I'll just split them. I have to try the shakes next time too but 10000% very satisfied with my first experience and I will make an attempt to stop by every Vegas trip from now on!!!"}

Cleanliness/Interior- 5 stars
Service - 2 stars
I have been wanting to go to Shake Shack for a pretty long time, and finally, we got to go. We just arrived in LV from SD today, and for a late dinner we decided to go to Shake Shack. We went on Christmas Eve night around 9:30 and they were open. Also it was nice because there weren't as much as people I thought there would be. I ordered the single burger, cheese fries, and a strawberry shake. 
The single burger honestly tasted a bit disappointing. I'm a fan of In-N-Out and their cheeseburger is way better. Shake Shack's burger have buns that look very greasy and taste very mushy and heavy. That really was a downfall for the burger, I prefer the light and slightly toasted buns, like the In-N-Out ones. However, the fries and shakes were amazing! The cheese fries were just perfect! Crispy and cheesy goodness. My brother got the vanilla shake, and it was good but the strawberry was better. Definitely like the shakes better here than In-N-Out. 
Now the service was not so great. The guy that was taking our orders looked nice, but he messed up our orders... At first I wanted whipped cream on my shake,then after finding out you had to pay extra for it, I asked for it to be taken out, but at the end they still put whip on my shake and had to pay for it. Also we wanted 2 double burgers and 2 singles, but he charged and gave us 3 double burgers and 1 single burger. Literally the employee confirmed our order by saying 2 doubles and 2 singles, but still charged and gave us 3 doubles. I feel like he intentionally did that to us because we looked like foreigners. (We are Asian) Well anyways I did enjoy most of the food, but not sure if I would get the single burger again."}
{"text":"I'm a Cali girl and after my few visits to NY, I ALWAYS CRAVE SHAKE SHACK.

WELL THANK YOU FOR OPENING ONE IN VEGAS, JUST 4 HOURS AWAY FROM ME!

Yes, I literally drove to Vegas from Cali just to get my Shake Shack fix.

Shack Stack: A must for me.  The breaded and deep-fried stuffed portobello mushroom is a burger all in itself.  Their blend of beef is perfect and they really nail that yummy crusty exterior from the fat top grill.

To many these burgers are just plain ol' cheeseburgers, BUT THAT IS WHY THEY ARE SO GREAT!! They are SIMPLE, GOOD QUALITY, AND TASTY CHEESEBURGERS.  No array of aiolis, no fancy cheeses used here... just simple, straight forward burgers done well.

MUST TRY THEIR CONCRETES AS WELL IF YOU HAVE A SWEET TOOTH

THANK YOU SHAKE SHACK!

OVERALL:  LOVE LOVE LOVE this joint.  Consistency is there especially having eaten in NY a few times.  Employees are friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Decided to hit up the Shake Shack with the husband.....as we all know, parking to get to any store where the Shake Shack is located is a tough one but we were there and finally managed to find a parking spot in the parking garage....hey, we were going to eat a burger, walking was a must.

The Shake Shack building is very nice, awesome outside patio seating for those who are enjoying the beautiful Arizona weather in March, going to be tough to enjoy the seating when it gets hot.

The entrance is tough....as soon as you walk in you wanna look at the big board to see what burgers you want to try.....however, you're standing at the front door so people are kinda displaced as to where to go. 

Finally we ordered a shroom burger and Shackburger. I couldn't wait to try the shroom burger but was truly disappointed. You couldn't taste the mushroom because it was so over fried. Won't order that again, tasted like chips and cheese in between two buns.

The Shackburger was tasty but I have to say, for the price, the burgers are super tiny.

Our kids, all 4 of them love In&Out and for half the price. Shake Shack is an upscale burger joint, hands down. Pay a lot for a burger still leaving a little hungry.

Happy we still tried it, gotta try something at least once but we will probably stick with Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers for a fancy burger or In&Out for a way inexpensive burger on the fly.

Oh and if you get a beverage the cups are super tiny and you need to stand in line for a refill, nothing convenient about that."}
{"text":"As 1am dinners go this was pretty good.  The burger as meaty and the toppings were fresh. The real surprise was the crinkle fries.  They were light and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"My first shake shack was in NYC where it all began...and I forgot how goooooood it was. I know my reservation about shake shack had always been the price...I mean $15-17 for a burger, fries and drink is pretty steep....but you will hear 0 complaints from me about that today as my shake shack meal was absolutely FREE :) hahah, still only gets 4 stars because I really don't like the price of food here but it absolutely does not take away from how good I think the burgers are here. 

The bun is like a marshmallow.....perfect texture, compliments there beef patty perfectly. Basic toppings such as lettuce and tomato but always tastes so fresh. You can also order beer or wine which is a big plus in my book. The milk shakes are top notch too....i want to try their version of a Chicago hot dog as I love Chicago hot dogs but Chicago themselves don't even sell them for almost $5!

Awesome location right in the heart of the Vegas strip next to the New York New York casino and hotel. Right by the Mgm and Excalibur. They have outdoor seating too which is perfect on a nice day!"}
{"text":"We passed by this place several time and finally decided to try it. Pretty much similar to any other burger places. You pick your burger then order. We came in around 4:30pm and the line wasn't that long probably still too early for dinner but they have all the windows opened.
They use sweet buns for their burger, which taste pretty good compared to regular burger buns.
We ordered the following items:
- burger - add in the shack stack sauce, good for kids
- hot chick'n - highly recommend it
- chickn shack - crispy chicken with house sauce
- loaded fries - top with cheese and bacon 
- shack burger - not a bad choice
- cheese burger with bacon
- shack cago dog
- strawberry, chocolate and vanilla shakes - if you like sweet drink then this is for you
Reason I gave it 4 stars due to the attitude I received when we told the employee that they messed up with our order. Need more improvements in that area."}
{"text":"This \"In N Out\" of the East Coast is in NO comparison to the \"In N Out\" of the West Coast. Everyone seems to go here every time they visit Vegas. Not sure what the hype is about, but my boyfriend always wants to go here for some reason. It's located right outside of New York, New York. Every time we come here we order two meals and the total comes out to be over $30. This is insane! This is fast food! $10 for a burger is ridiculous! We've basically tried every burger on the menu and none of them stood out whatsoever. I would walk myself over to McDonalds and order something off the dollar menu and be satisfied. They have crinkle cut fried here which seems to be the thing on the east coast. The milkshakes are watered down and taste exactly like melted soft serve ice cream. I'm personally not a huge fan of this place because In N Out has already set the bar high for fast food burgers. I suggest trying it for yourself at least once."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in this place. The burgers were small for the price and the smoke stack burger was not that great for being one of three options -- rubbery and undercooked bacon. The cheese on the cheese fries was gritty. The coffee shake had very little coffee flavor and tasted a little bit like dirt. Apart from the really nice and friendly staff I don't think this place has much to offer. Steer clear of this burger place and  go to one of the many other burger options on the strip."}
{"text":"I do think Shake Shack is pretty awesome but let me be clear, I think In-N-Out has a better overall burger for taste and price. Shake Shack wins on presentation and variety and for their shakes
Been to this location twice now, and both times I got the portobello mushroom burger. They add a huge piece of fried Portobello on top of your burger patty.
There's actually quite a few items on the menu. I actually ordered a hot dog as well the first time I visited. The fries aren't anything special, and the hot dog wasn't really anything special either.
The burger is quite good, but again I repeat, In-N-Out has an overall better burger in my opinion.
It gets pretty packed inside here, and they're open until 2AM, so you have a lot of time to stop by and eat. I actually landed in Vegas at 11PM and had enough time to get a burger here before heading to my hotel for the night.
Yes I would come back here again, because we don't have one in the Bay Area and we have a few In-N-Outs with another one being built in Daly City. If I had to choose between In-N-Out and Shake Shack while in Vegas, I would choose Shake Shack because I get enough In-N-Out back home and need to change up the taste every once in a while."}
{"text":"If I could place a zero star I would, my boys absolutely hated the burger... it could've used some seasoning maybe but the taste of the meat was terrible on its own. The cheese and bacon fries were also disgusting, I guess we are not used to this low level processed cheese.  Even the seating is uncomfortable, I just don't get it.  The service was ok, friendly staff, but glad they didn't ask us if it was \"all delicious?\"... Big disappointment for a DT Summerlin location, next time we'll stick to the 5 guys."}
{"text":"Good burger and nice atmosphere, especially the patio and location. However, for the price, I have been disappointed on my two visits here. In-n-Out Burger is just as good for a 1/3 of the price. Shake Shack is worth $6.00 at best. Adding fries and drink (which they dispense) makes a lunch nearly $11.00/person. Not worth it in my book."}
{"text":"The double cheeseburger was super juicy.
Fries were ok
Raspberry Ginger lemonade was great
A little over priced but ok
Worth a stop 
Service was really nice."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Shake Shack since the first time I tried it in NYC and the Vegas location does the franchise justice. I actually might even like it better because this location is more modern, eye-pleasing, and spacious compared to its NYC counterpart. 

We pretty much ordered everything off the menu and dug in. I really like all of the burgers here and even though I prefer eating at In-n-Out I'm not to type to get into heated debates when comparing the two. They both make delicious burgers and it boils down to personal preference. Despite the long line during my recent visit, it moved smoothly and honestly, few things can beat munching down on a shack burger while sipping on beer under some shade on the Las Vegas strip."}
{"text":"Single smokeshack. Burger patty cooked perfect medium. Need seasoning tho, lack of flavor. Not in love with the buns, probably better if it toasted."}
{"text":"The line outside is less intimidating than it seems. It moves pretty fast. I've heard so much about this East Coast gem and I was so excited to learn that one opened in Las Vegas. 

The hype is real. The burgers seem small when you first get them, but you leave so satisfied and not overly stuffed. The staff working is quite nice and the restaurant itself has a cool vibe.  

This place is a definite stop on your trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is way better than In and Out in my opinion. I got the shack stack and it was off the hook. A burger that has a mushroom that is stiff with cheese ! I can say that is the best fast food burger I ever tasted. The crinkle fries were good too. It brought back my childhood days in elementary school when I use to get that on my tray lunch. But overall this place is a must try if you are in Vegas. Skip all the fancy burger joints in Vegas and stop by here to get you a burger."}
{"text":"As another person said. . . Never go into a new place with expectations. What a disappointment. I really thought it would be different than it was. Food is so so at best. They have a decent Chicago style hot dog. That was only thing I actually liked. 

Fries were Nathan's fries essentially. They're fine but crinkle cut isn't that huge to me. Burgers are fast food. 

Staff is excellent. Very polite. Not the look I'd expect from the name but my wife loves it. I pictured 50's diner. Very clean. Trendy etc. 

Short story long, doubt I'll be headed back. Too many better places out there."}
{"text":"Overpriced fast-food restaurant. Burger was just okay. Chicken was so greasy, the paper-wrap was soaked.  The fries, though crispy, were tasteless. On a good note, the workers were friendly and eager to help."}
{"text":"I was he site t to try Shake Shake! My wife and son already had been there and they swore it was better then my favorite. Well, sure enough they were correct!!! Awesome food!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad they had a vegetarian option. The shroom burger was delicious!! Cheese fries were okay, nothing special. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been to the east coast a couple of times, but I had never heard of Shake Shack until the last year or so. It's on that short list of places I've always wanted to try (along w/ Sonics, Applebees, 5 Guys, Chick-fil-A, etc) because we just don't have one in Hawaii. I can pass on something like Applebees, but when the Yelp Hawaii CM tells you to go visit Shake Shack on your visit to Vegas, then you do it! SUCH a good choice!

Where's it at?
It's on the corner (outside) of the New York, New York hotel, across the street from the Hard Rock Cafe. They have indoor and outdoor seating, so spending a sunny day outside to nom could be nice! The inside is pretty modern, and there's a lot of seating.

Don't be scared of the line:
They have stanchions set up to snake the line before you get to the ordering counter, and the line always fills the whole area set up for it. Don't fear! The line actually moves really quickly, and it's the perfect time to decide what you're going to order while you wait. They have a huge menu board set up next to the stanchions. Once you order, they give you a buzzer so you know when you're order is ready.

Food & Drinks:
The burgers are yummy! The buns don't overtake the fillings, and the fillings are good...like, sure, I want bacon and cheese and peppers and tomato and lettuce and extra sauce! Oh, I can throw an extra patty and more cheese in there? Uh...YES! :D 

They have burgers and they have fries, but that's not what they're known for, not really. Shake Shack is known for their shakes and frozen custards! What's the difference between regular run-of-the-mill ice cream and frozen custard? Frozen custard has eggs and cream and is made into a thick custard first before being frozen; regular ice cream is just heavy cream and flavoring generally frozen from its liquid state. In other words: frozen custard is MUCH richer (it's because of the eggs). The point is that you MUST get the frozen custard! You can get it plain or you can go all out and get it with the mix-ins, which is definitely the way to go!

FYI, this fast food burger joint also sells beer & wine! Don't be surprised, it's Vegas lol. They even have beers on tap! Obviously, must be 21+ to order that. :P

Conclusion:
I totally wish we had one in Hawaii...man, it would be SO popular."}
{"text":"Came back for another visit and brought family. Shack burgers: single & double; cheese fries; lemonades, black & white shake.
Tasty"}
{"text":"A friend told me about this spot and seeing that it was one in Vegas, my husband and I decided to try it. The 1st time we went, the line was crazy long and it was 105 in Vegas, too hot to be waiting outside for food. The next time, we decided to go when they 1st opened. The food was blah. Nothing special. The burgers are thin and wasn't juicy at all. I can't see myself ever eating here again."}
{"text":"First time at shake shack, I think this place is overhyped. Don't get me wrong, their burgers are delicious, but the value isn't great. We got a single shackburger $5.29 and a double shackburger $8.09. I feel if all the burgers were $1.29 cheaper the price would be perfect! As it is, I can get higher quality burgers for the price, i.e. The habit burger is a much better value!"}
{"text":"Burgers for us today and Shake Shack was the spot. The fries were AMAZING! Fresh and crispy and not greasy at all. Could use some salt though. The burgers were also tasty and not dripping in grease. If you're at a shake shack you HAVE to get a shake. The shakes were delicious and blended to perfect consistency. Not too thick or runny. My friend got vanilla and I got the salted caramel shake and it tasted like salted caramel. As for burgers my friend got the double Shackburger and I got the Shack Stack which was a 'shroom burger and cheeseburger in one. Both were delicious! It's all a la carte so it can cost quite a bit. They can use some combo meals. Satisfying meal but it is quite pricey."}
{"text":"It was our first time to try this famous Shake Shack. As we were around in downtown Summerlin, we decided to try the food here. 

I love shakes so I chose their weekly shake ( the pomegranate something ). It was very tasty, creamy and rich flavor. Then we ordered the shroom burger & it was very good. Fried perfectly. But the mushroom was smaller than the bun.

And bought some dog biscuits as treats for our fidos at home. 

Price is okay, service was very friendly. Next time we'd like to try the cut fries, burgers and the other flavor of shakes / their custard. And of course always buy some goodies for the fidos."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. When I saw the menu and the prices I figured it must be good for them to be so popular and charge so much for burgers and fries. I was wrong. While the burger patty itself was good (not great or even above average) the bun was soggy, the lettuce (calling this wet, wilted, disgusting green mass lettuce is an insult to lettuce) had to be removed. The fries tasted like the ones I make at home (from the freezer section of the grocery store). The bright spot for me was the cheese on the fries, that was delicious. My wife got a shake, which was good. Will we go back there again? Maybe. But I seriously doubt it when there are places with much better food and at much better prices. I will take a smashburger over this place any day."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience. Had to wait forever for our order then the person gave our food to another complaining customer who swore that was her order even though she was 3 people behind us in line!! Then we had to wait even longer.  Asked to speak to a manager was told that there wasn't one in. Our food was cold when we got it. I asked for a fresh order.  Was told no. Shakes have no taste and are bland as can be. Ordered the peanut butter shake. Tasted like plain old vanilla.  Went to 5he location in Summerland hoping it would be better. The place was empty and we Still waited forever for our food and it was bland there as well. No thank you Shake Shack."}
{"text":"We came here the other day for lunch and it was pretty good. I'm going to piss off a lot of people but.... I love the shroom burger and dislike the fries. I tried the cheese fries and realized out of all of the things I've had, they're not really great. I love the shakes and the burgers though! This location did have amazing service and is in a great location at kierland."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the line and the stop to try one of their famous burgers... Tried their Secret menu peanut butter bacon burger!  Sounds odd but amazing combo.  Also their fries are legit!  Next time I want the cheesy sauce on them!"}
{"text":"I wish they had shake shack in Southern California. I know a lot of ppl compare SS to in n out but honestly, SS is way better. I had their smoke shack and it was so good. They had sweet red chile cooked with the burger which gave it just enough kick to get your tastebuds rolling. There is no lettuce or tomato in the smoke shack so if you are expecting that then don't. Their crinkle cut fries were crispy and perfectly salted. If you're a fan of cheese then get the cheese fries. The cheese is not overbearing and your fries are still crispy even though there is cheese on top of them. The decor is modern and lively with lots of seating. The staff is friendly and well managed. I'll make sure to come back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Pretty decent cheeseburger - got the standard with the shake sauce.  Cheese fries had a good amount of cheese on them, but you better be splitting these with someone.  It's a huge portion and, if you don't eat them quickly enough, the cheese sauce starts to set and doesn't taste as good, so I'd recommend splitting them.  Splitting them is best for any of their fry servings - cheese fries or not."}
{"text":"Modern, great food, decent prices, so far favorite burger place in Vegas. This is what burger places should look like. Other places need to follow suit."}
{"text":"The service was pleasant and nice.  The food was good,  the burger was good, the fries were good and the homemade lemonade and milk shake was fantastic.  I wish my stomach was bigger so I could have eaten the shake chicken sandwich, as well.   I despise my small stomach"}
{"text":"So my husband and I decided to give it a try unfortunately we left disappointed.  Place was nearly empty,had to wait a while for our burgers then had to wait even longer for our fries which were undercooked and raw! The size of the burgers were the size of a McDonald's cheeseburger no joke however it did taste better and it better cor how much they over price it. We ordered 1 shack burger, 1 double bacon cheeseburger, 1 large 50/50, 1 small 50/50  1 regular fry, 1 cheese fry and the total came to almost $30.00 ! In our opinion shack shack is all hype, undeserved hype. We didn't even get greeted when we walked in or out?"}
{"text":"Excellent! The chicken sandwich was extremely juicy and battered well. My mom got the cheese burger which was awesome. I love the bun and the pickles are fresh. 4 or 5 different people asked if I was okay or needed anything and I love that! Don't listen to the 1 bad review which is probably from a competitor. These burgers DO NOT taste like McDonald's. I didn't feel like waiting in line again to get a shake so I'll get it next time!"}
{"text":"I tried Shake Shack the first time in New York.
I personally prefer In-N-Out than this. Yesterday I gave it another try.
The line was long when I came, but it moved pretty quick.
I got the regular cheeseburger and my bf got the Shake Stack.
I like his better, of course it's a $9 dollar burger.
To even compare it to In-N- Out in the first place it's not even comparableable.
I probably will get the Shroom burger next time."}
{"text":"Went to Shake Shack tonight.  I usually don't like corporate places, but I found Shake Shack on Yelp and didn't realize it was the same one I heard about on the internet.  
The pictures on yelp looked good, so I decided to try it out.
When I got there, I realized it was the same corporate Shake Shack I had heard about.  I figured it would not be a very good value for the money, and I was right.
I really liked the menu, and the prices seemed reasonable, so I went ahead and ordered a regular burger and a hot dog.  Then I added a shake.  It cost me about 15 bucks, so I figured I would be full, but after eating, I was still hungry.
I must admit the quality of the food was fantastic, but the burger was way too small for the price.
Although I liked the hamburger better than an In and Out Burger, it seemed to be gone in just a couple of bites.  Shake Shack burgers seem even smaller than The Habit burgers.  The value for the food just isn't there.  At any other quasi-fast food place I could spend 15 dollars and be stuffed out of my mind, but at Shake Shack I was not even full.
The Shake I ordered wasn't even filled to the top of the small cup, and for over 5 dollars I really feel like I got ripped off.
This is the reason I don't really like corporate places like Shake Shack or Five Guys.  They have to kick up too much money to the corporation so the wall street types can become multi-millionaires while dumb people buy small-portioned food.
Shake Shack is certainly an excellent place for quality food, but I would say it is about 40 to 50 percent overpriced for the amount of food you get.
I just don't feel like I should spend that much for a place that really has a fast food feel to it.  Wait in line, sit in hard chairs.  Typical fast food feel.
Another thing I hate about corporate places is that the owners of the brand are usually people who think they are smarter than their customers, so they try to trick you into not noticing little things like charging for whipped cream, not allowing refills, making every item a la carte so prices build up fast, etc.  They also think customers are so stupid that they can be fooled by the hype and that people will almost always follow the crowd and waste money just to be cool.
I'm convinced the upper management of Shake Shack is doomed to fail, and they must be replaced by more wise, realistic management who understand human nature with a little less arrogance and respect for their customers.
I also noticed managers at Shake Shack responding to some of these Yelp posts.  Although I understand why they respond, individual store managers cannot do anything about the prices which are set by corporate accountants.
I am convinced Shake Shack is going to fail unless they have major changes in upper management real soon.
If you don't care about money, Shake Shack is for you.  
For thriftier customers, In and Out or McDonalds is the way to go."}
{"text":"Shake Shack was an interesting choice we made while walking the Strip, I had the cheeseburger and it was delish, the concrete concocoction known as the Jackpot was something to be desired however, next time Ill order a Malt.  The crinkle fries are average.  4 stars for the Burgers and free self serve ice cold water!  On a hot day that is a plus!  Go on get your shake on!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite things about traveling to New York, Chicago or Los Angeles... now right here in Cleveland!  I couldn't have been happier with my first visit. Friendly and relatively speedy service despite the line, and the amazing quality I have come to expect from Shake Shack.   This place lives up to the hype you've probably heard.  It's simply the best fast food/fast casual burger you will find anywhere in the country, and it's miles ahead of \"out and in,\" or whatever that place is called. Order a Smokeshack, and make sure to get a Shackmaster to wash it down."}
{"text":"I like it!  This was my first time visiting a Shake Shack.  Have heard about them for years and was excited to try them out.  We lucked out and there was almost no line.  We ordered a ShackBurger, Cheese Fries, ShackMeister Dog, Jackpot Concrete, Draught Root Beer and Peanut Butter Shake.  Burger and fries were our favorite, root beer the least, just nothing special.  Our total for all that was a little under $30.  Prices are a little high for quick service but not to bad.  You can definitely tell you are getting better quality than your typical fast food."}
{"text":"Shake Shack lives up to its name, the true gold is in... The shakes. Honestly, I don't get the hype of the burgers. Have tried shake shack in both London and Vegas now and I haven't been blown away. Call me biased as a Californian but I prefer In n Out. The shakes, however, are ON POINT. I like that they have rotating flavors and the red velvet, being my favorite flavor in the history of any kind of flavors, was heavenly."}
{"text":"The line was long, the hamburger was very greasy.  Almost all of our party had stomach aches within one hour.  Would not go again."}
{"text":"Looking for a burger, fries and a beer? This is the place!  The atmosphere is simple and clean/ You walk in, order, get a buzzer and have a short wait. The staff is very friendly. They offer tasty hamburgers and great fries. You can make the fries even better when you top them off with cheese, bacon and peppers. Wash it down with a Shakemiester beer and your good to go. They also have a couple of TV's where you can catch the latest sports action. Great place to go with friends after a day of your favorite sport or hike."}
{"text":"We had a yummy dinner. It was worth the drive, I wish it were closer. We sat outside in the patio. We will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"I stayed up too late
Got Shake Shack on my brains
In N Out can stay
That's what people say
I got one too many drinks
Can't stop the hunger pains
Shake Shack is all I can say
That's what my friends say

Juicy beef oozing
Can't stop, won't stop oohing
It's like I got addicted
In my mind, thinking I want some more Shack Stack

Cause the eaters gonna eat, eat, eat
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate
Baby I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake
Shake shack, shake shack
In N Out lovers gonna break, break, break
And fake writers gonna fake, fake, fake
Baby I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake
Shake shack, shake shack

Hey, hey, hey
Just get yourself a shack stack burger, fries, and a drink
Be it concrete, wine, or beer, it's a win
You should be getting your behind to Shake Shack!

Shake Shack is as catchy as Taylor Swift's tunes. A huge spot at the New York New York Hotel is where their newest location on the west side lies and it's bright, spacious, and very appropriate. It may not be as orgasmic as the ones I've had in NYC but absolutely not a deal breaker. I'm still one big fan who's happy they're finally within driving distance to me."}
{"text":"The wait was long to put our order in. We waited in line for roughly 45 minutes to get our order in. Granted it only took 5-10 to get our food afterwards, it stands that the wait must be caused by the cashiers I guess(?) anyways, that knocked down my review a star. 
The milkshakes were average in my opinion. Less than a block away, Blvd Creamery at Monte Carlo has better milkshakes if that's really what you're craving. 
The burgers. I had their bacon cheeseburger. It was average in my opinion. My brother on the other hand had the burger that's a cheeseburger topped with their muenster-filled portobello, and I must say, that was delicious. 
The fries were ok. From other reviews, you'd think they've never had crinkle cut fries before. Or that they've never had cheese on fries. 
Overall, it was an ok place to try, but I don't see myself ever coming back here to eat."}
{"text":"I was super excited for this place to open, I mean... It's shake shack! I frequented shake shack all over NYC and every time I go back I somehow wind up there atleast once. 

We came in a week after they opened, there was a small line but it went super fast. I let my date know about the whole menu and he ordered the smokestack and I ordered the shroomburger, we shared cheese fries and also ordered a coconut shake. My date thought the burger was really good, but that he wasn't sold on the fries. I happen to still love my shroom burger, but could do without the cheese on the fries. The surprising part was how much we both loved the coconut milkshake, with their custard it was seriously amazing! It was like rum chata minus the agonizing hangover the next day.

I have to say that I love the openness and the patio at this location and we only waited 10 minutes for our food but ah.... It's just not the same as the NY locations! I'm still pleased with it enough to go back before a movie though."}
{"text":"This might have been an off experience when I went, but maybe Shake Shack was a bit overhyped in my mind...

We stopped by on a Saturday evening, and the place had a line. I went with the Smoke Shack and fries. We were waiting for everyone in our party of 6 to get our food, which actually took longer than expected. They had switched one of my friend's numbers, so she wasn't called until she had to go up to them and ask what happened. She was then given her burger as well as an extra side of fries, so that was nice.

The food itself was smaller than I originally thought. Maybe it was because the Smokeshack didn't have any lettuce in it, or maybe it was because we were ravenous after having bouldered during the day in Red Rocks, or maybe it was due to the wait. In any case, I finished that small burger in like six bites, and it still left more to be desired. The fries were great, though, and I wish they came in bigger sizes too. Perhaps this is a good place to go to after having had some drinks, or maybe I just needed to get a double instead of a single. Either way, the place was solid A-Ok, but definitely didn't live up to the hype for me."}
{"text":"First time here a little of a wait but who doesn't wait in lines in Vegas? It was worth it. I wish for the double vs. the single since I was really hungry. Their fires were amazing cut fries they were crispy and had no grease at all and the taste was spot on! The service was also exceptional! The salted creamy caramel shake was a hit. Thanks for building a shake shack in LV. A must eat. Great for the entire family."}
{"text":"This place is a must whenever in Vegas.  (I know there's spots open in LA, but since I hate driving to/around LA, it might as well have just been in Vegas for me.)

I love the Shack Stack bc you can't say no to a fried cheese filled mushroom.  Or at least I can't.  This burger is so bomb.  Whenever I'm asked if I like In N Out or Shake Shack better, I'd have to go w/ Shake Shack (blasphemy, right).  I mean, if In N Out started making a burger with a fried cheese filled mushroom then maybe I'd like them better, but for now--it goes to Shake Shack.

One thing In N Out has on them is their fries. Not digging the fries. I usually get the cheese fries--bc, cheese--but don't like the texture of the fries and don't like how the cheese is that liquidy cheese. I prefer that square Kraft cheese, lol.

The line is always pretty long, but goes by quickly.  Good service and they have a guy directing people who don't like to pay attention to open registers."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying shake shack and it was a pretty good experience. The line was out the door but moved fairly quickly. The place was also very clean! I got the shack burger, fries and a milkshake. It was delicious, especially the shake shack sauce. I got a chocolate cookies and cream milk shake that tasted like a cookie! It was very good and I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Smokeshack, french fries, and a strawberry shake- my order everytime! So so so good. Love everything about this place, from the crinkle cut french fries to the custard shakes. The chicken sandwhich is also very delicious and I would put it on your must try list! 

Very casual place with upbeat and friendly staff. They are always sooo quick to get your food ready even if it is really busy. I think Shake Shack holds its ground against other burger establishments for sure."}
{"text":"It doesn't worth your money!!!!
I ordered the smoking bacon cheddar burger, they forget to put the cheese on my burger. When I went back to ask for the cheese, they pumped the bottled processed cheese sauce onto my burger. Yuck! The meat is not seasoned neither. I also ordered the concrete smoking shack attack, this is just a chocolate ice cream that taste like it straight came out of the grocery store freezer. 
I will never eat at shake shack again!!! Never!!!"}
{"text":"Shake shack! Shake shack! Why so much hype? Is it a decent burger? Sure, but is it the best burger for the money? Meh... Also why is everyone comparing this to in-n-out? I think this is more closely related to a habit or a burger city grill. (For the record, I prefer in-n-out for the price). 

Anyways, the burger. Got the smoke shack. Decent quality ingredients that rivals your typical quality grill joint. Best? No. Decent? Yes. I did like the sport peppers that they had though. Long, thin peppers that are similar to peppercinis in flavor. 

The standout for me were the fries. Crinkle fries that were crispy throughout and not too potatoey. Loved them. 

Outside of that, I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I'll be craving this so this likely won't be on the destination list when we're back in Vegas. So many other food options to try here."}
{"text":"After a long evening of perusing the strip with a 100oz yard long Fat Tuesday, my friends and I happened upon Shake Shack and decided to test the hype. 

Too full of liquids but wanting to have a bit of everything, my friend and decided to I split a ShackStack, a single patty cheeseburger with a breadcrumb'ed and fried cheesy portobello mushroom, fries, and a small black and white shake. The burger came with tomatoes and lettuce, and was glistening and juicy and oozing and beautiful. Compared to InNOut, the patties at Shake Shack are larger, and the buns are less toasty. The fries are crinkly cut and crispy, but nothing spectacular. The shake was pretty darned delicious.

If you're looking for greasy American goodness, Shake Shack will definitely hit the spot. Given the huge selection of food available in Vegas, I wouldn't likely revisit, but I would say give it a try if you have never had it."}
{"text":"Lauren was amazing! She came and struck up a conversation with us outside after we ordered, and may i say she was DELIGHTFUL! What an outgoing friendly amazing asset to the company! Any who, it was my wife's 30th birthday and after learning that she arranged to have a mud pie milkshake delivered to her on the house which was fantastic! On top of Lauren and the Ray of sunshine she showers on our table, the burgers were delicious. Highly recommend shake shack & Lauren!"}
{"text":"Wow..... I was surprised at the good taste of the double Shack burger.   Fries were also very good.  Good place to eat while walking on the strip."}
{"text":"I'm confused, did I really pay over $17 for a burger, fries and shake.  Way overpriced.  As a Cali girl, I went with an open mind, hoping In and Out had some competition.   I heard they are now in LA.  No competition for IN and Out or Five Guy's.  Nothing special, but I am going to try again.   Maybe I missed something"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a burger, hot dog, or shake! I love their peanut butter shake. Their crinkle-cut fries are also very good."}
{"text":"I'v been dying to try Shake Shack for a while now and when I found out it had opened at New York-New York in Las Vegas, I went for it. There are usually line-ups that extend outside but we were lucky enough on a Monday evening at 8:30ish to have missed the rush. I must admit this is a well run organization from the staff constantly maintaining the place (wiping windows, sweeping floors), to the bus boy who was kind enough to let me there was free refills if I went up to the counter. Even having water on tap with plastic cups at the condiment counter was a nice touch.

As for the food itself. I ordered the double SmokeShack, crinkle cut cheese fries and their draught root beer. The double was a good sized burger with fresh ingredients and I was impressed the bun held up nicely without disintegrating. The burger was tasty but I personally found it overwhelmingly greasy (I anticipated greasy but not this greasy). It may of been the bacon, or it may have been the burger patties or both but I'm willing to give it another try. The cheese fries were a nice, unhealthy, albeit delicious side. Total was just over $18."}
{"text":"Went to this place after it being recommended by my son and niece who heard that it might be better than Inn and Out. Fresh burgers and amazing shakes here. Trendy, relaxed atmosphere with lots of tvs. Great value for the quality good they were here."}
{"text":"If crying. Insert burger. - Words to live by from a tiny baby's onesie sold at the Shake Shack. 

New York's best is now cleverly dishing out cheesy burgers (and shakes) from the New York, New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas! This bustling burger \"shack\" is quite the word on the strip right now. Although they are connected to the Hotel & Casino, their entrance is actually located right on the strip, next to Tom's Urban and the Swatch Watch store.

There is a sizable, tourist-y line (but it moves quickly), a greeter that passes you a burger of the day card and a menu, efficiently directing you to the order window where you receive a nifty buzzer.

I never tried Shake Shack before, but I think I OD'd on melty cheese tonight. Here are the culprits:

ShackMeister Burger $6.19 (Add Bacon $1.55) - Simple. It wasn't bad... but I've had better. Cheeseburger, Shack Sauce (didn't taste it), crispy fried ale-marinated shallots (didn't taste them) , and we added applewood smoked bacon. The burger got lost in all of that thick cheese. Flavor rating: 3/5

Shack Stack $9.49 - Shack stack you tasty son of a bun! Cheeseburger with a crisp-fried portobello mushroom cap filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses (!!), topped with lettuce, tomato and Shack Sauce (didn't taste it). Get outta town with that portobello cap. The lightly battered, seasoned and fried mushroom cap was oozing with gooey cheese and flavor. The burger was good, but the inventive mushroom cap set it off into outer-space. Flavor rating: 5/5

Cheese Fries $3.95 (Add Fried Shallots $1) -crinkle cut fries topped with lots (and I mean lots) of melted cheese blend. We wanted to be different so we requested to add fried shallots and voila! Cheese overdose. Flavor rating: 3/5

Strawberry Shake $5.25 - it's a good, thick, strawberry shake. Have you ever had In-N-Out's version? They taste identical. My only gripe - they serve you a small and charge you over $5. In-N-Out is the way to go. Flavor rating: 5/5

In retrospect, I would nix the cheese fries and just order regular fries and share the shack stack with my date. But hey, you live and you learn! 

Is it worth a try? Yes. Is it better than In-N-Out? Your mileage may vary. However, I'll forever prefer In-N-Out for their affordable prices and their grilled onions! What's Shake Shack got against glorious grilled onions?"}
{"text":"I go here every week. Love the food and the staff is always on it. The GM, Cameron runs a tight operation"}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had. Fries are great, atmosphere is great.

What makes the burger is the bun. Soft, fresh and just enough sweetness to cut through the saltiness and fat. Fresh tomato and green leaf lettuce are perfect. 

My wife doesn't do burgers and even she gave it a thumbs up."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype.

2 burgers, 2 orders of regular fries, 2 sodas = $30.

My regular cheeseburger was the size of my palm. The bun was some wrinkly cheap bun that looked like some about-to-expire off name brand. The meat was tasty but c'mon. Overall a wildly over-priced failure.

The crinkle fries were awesome. But would I go back there to get them? No.

My regular size soda looked about the size of a child's sippy cup. And no self-service refill fountain. 

It's LOOOOOUD in the place. Didn't get a booth. The tables and chairs are I guess supposed to look like industrial Ikea maybe? They were uncomfortable.

There are so many far superior places for a burger in town at much lower prices. This place was a sad sad joke.

Can we stop by The Habit on the way home FOR A REAL CHEESEBURGER PLEASE????"}
{"text":"Second visit within two weeks. 

This time around had...
Smoke Shack Burger-great little burger with with chopped cheery peppers (Wow! First time for that condiment) applewood smoked bacon, cheese, and shack sauce. Pretty tasty burger. 

Fries with cheese sauce- what can be said about a nice little side dish. 

Salted Carmel shake-right delicious, not cloyingly sweet. Very good. 

My only negative take away is price. When compared to the Holy Grail of In-N-Out Burgers the Shack is two and half times more expensive."}
{"text":"This place is pretty gooood. Cannot compare to in and out or five guys, it has its own flare to it.

I got the chicken burger and it was pretty good.

My gf got the hot dog, but that was pretty basic, like a hot dog from the hot dog stand.

I would opt for a burger or chicken burger instead; I want to try that mushroom burger one time as well."}
{"text":"The hype is real, yo.

It's exactly what I remembered in New York, down to the seating and ordering. yay!

What we ordered:
Milk shake - thick, creamy, everything you want in a shake. Only drawback? PRICEY!
Smoke shack - Niman Ranch applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and ShackSauce... everything you want and need in a burger! So tasty - a little smokey, a little spicy, BACON, cheese, seasoned patty.
Special burger of the month - eh, but when in vegas, carpe diem! It was a \"nacho\" burrito with jalapenos and all. A little too spicy and nothing else.
Cheese fries - simple, clean, yes!

What else is served? Plenty - hot dogs, shroom burgers, turkey. Also, beer and wine (we'd had too much at that point, water for me!)

Only difference? The lovely sparkly vegas bedazzling that everything gets when you're on the strip.

Location: At the New York, New York casino and hotel, for the most obvious reasons, right?

Until next time, Shake Shack."}
{"text":"This place is truly amazing!  The food is outstanding! If you're looking for a healthier choice in \"fast food\" categories, this is the place!! 

Stop by today!  You'll be glad you did!!"}
{"text":"I came to this place at around 11pm last Friday night.  After hearing so much about this place, I wasn't surprised to see that there was a huge line.  Fortunately, the line moved along quickly and after ordering my food, it came out pretty fast.  There is another, shorter line just outside the restaurant for ordering just desserts and custards.  I was in the normal line inside for ordering from the entire menu which featured burgers, fries, hotdogs, etc.

This review is for the shack-cago dog that I ordered.  It was delicious and had a lot of toppings.  The only problem I had was that because of all the toppings and relish on the hotdog, it started getting soggy and was difficult to hold together halfway through.  That was probably unavoidable though.  The price for my hotdog came out  to $4.32.  

My friend ordered just a burger which was around $12.  While I enjoyed the food and atmosphere at Shake Shack, I probably won't be going here very often since the prices are high for the casual fare."}
{"text":"Was so excited to come here for a shake and splurge.  The shake was just okay.  Overly sweet, no depth of flavor.  I didn't even finish it."}
{"text":"First time trying THE fame. Good food, atmospheres, taste, and what's good about it. Only thing that I don't like is portion size of the burger. Looks like junior burger"}
{"text":"Lunch on Tuesday- with all the options close by, parking close is crazy- opt for a few rows out and easy enough to get a spot without long walk. Grab menu before getting in line for efficiency. Moderate line, moved quickly. Staff is plentiful- mostly friendly & helpful. Son & I combined had their basic burger with bacon, cheeseburger, fries and shake. Both rated this a slightly better than average burger. Well cooked, juicy and crisp depending on thickness of Party- overall fairly thin. 11 year old says bacon 9/10, is overall burger 6/10. Cheeseburger was hot and gooey cheese, crisp onions & pickles. Found myself looking for \"more\" flavor. Overall 6/10 as well. Fries were hot, but \"freezer fries\". Milkshake (black & white) was thick & tasty. Glad we didn't wait long. ."}
{"text":"Ever since I had Shake Shack in LA, I couldn't stop thinking about having it again. Coming to Las Vegas, I knew I had to make a stop here and it did not disappoint!

There was a line when we arrived but it didn't take long to get to the front. My boyfriend ordered the double shack burger and I had the single shack burger. We also ordered three sides of crinkle cut fries. They give you a buzzer that lets you know when your food is ready. Every table was taken but we were able to snatch one that was really messy. No wonder it was open, no one else wanted it but one of the workers immediately came over to clean it which we really appreciated.

The food was delicious, just as I remembered it in LA. I think a lot of people tend to compare this place to In n Out. I've thought about it but I think they're both good in their own way and I'd continue to eat at both. In n Out is not as greasy IMO but Shake Shack just might be a tad more flavorful. I can't wait to go back to Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack? Yes pls! This was my first stop while in Vegas. The line was moderate, great minds think alike right! We enjoyed our meal outside since it was still nice and warm. Plus, it's a great spot to people watch hehe. 

I got their classic Hamburger! Make sure you let them know if you want the ShackSauce (yas), lettuce, tomato, pickle or onion. If not, your hamburger will be very naked. :( The burgers can be small for some, but still delicious nonetheless! Of course, you need some fries Crinkle Cut Fries on the side. You can get either fries or the Cheese Fries which is topped with special blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce. And if you still got room, why not grab a shake! They taste especially great during the day. 

If you're craving a burger before heading out for a crazy night of fun, stop by Shake Shack! :)"}
{"text":"First try with Shake Shack, and it will be our last. Horrible customer service. We placed our order on the Shake Shack app and arrived 5 minutes early for pick up. The crew behind the counter all but ignored us when we came in to pick up our food AND left half off the order completely out of the bag - we had to turn back around and spend an extra 20 minutes in the car because of their mistake. Tried calling (multiple times) on the way back to let them know what had happened, but no one ever picked up the phone. Don't order to-go from this location!


*UPDATE - to put the icing on the cake, the service girl behind the counter rolled her eyes at us when we asked her to remake the food so we could actually enjoy it."}
{"text":"Had to try it since I was in Vegas. Overall was pretty good! Burger was nice & juicy, fries were fried just right, and shake was tasty. Would definitely go back again next time in Vegas! I want to try the chicken next time."}
{"text":"Might as well go to the McDonalds. Servings VERY small. Hamburgers about 3.5 inches in diameter. The meat was less than 1/4 inch thick. Not much for given the high price. There are several other restraunts in the complex like The Lazy Dog that gives you more for your money. 

On the positive side. The busser was the best! Very attentive and very friendly."}
{"text":"I'm really torn on how many stars to give. Don't get me wrong, my burger and fries were pretty good....but nothing memorable or \"out of this world.\" Shake Shack is located by MTO café, Crave and Fogo de Chao.

I ordered the hamburger with all the fixins (lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles and ShackSauce.) Also got a side of their regular fries. Super tempted to get the cheese fries but I need to watch my waistline. 

Am I the only one who thought the burger was on the smaller size? It's not as small White Castle (then again, those are more like sliders) and it's not the size of an In n Out burger. Just thought it was.....kind of....an awkward size? It even reminded me of elementary school lunches. Like I could've gone for another burger if I really wanted to. And trust me, I'm 5'1, one-hundred and something pounds and I still wasn't completely satisfied after. I guess in the end, it's for the better. I still got my burger fix without walking outta there feeling like a blob. But for big eaters....or even normal sized eaters....you may have to order two burgers...which will cost you about $8-9 in total. I don't know man....I don't think it's worth it. There are plenty of other better burger joints in this city.

So....3 stars it is. It's really just \"A-OK.\" Don't know why there's such a hype though.....am I missing something??"}
{"text":"So I work at crystals shops and decided to walk all the way to shake shack. I ordered 2 protein burgers with the mushroom and patty. And fries. What I got was 2 mushroom burgers no meat. I paid extra for that and now that I'm back at work I can't walk back there. I'm so annoyed and of course still hungry. Very upset and disappointed with today's service."}
{"text":"If you've had In n Out or you're looking to try a bomb.com burger, this is the joint right here!
I suggest you get the Smokeshack! Definitely delicious and it's a mouthwatering burger!
Haven't tried their draft ale but hoping to try it soon! There are 5 cashiers so the line goes by fast!"}
{"text":"I do agree the shakes at this place is easy to suck up the straw, but so does Jonny Rocket's. Burger is not as good, so if I have a craving for Shake Shack I would just go to Jonny Rockets for better food and just as good shakes."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite, try to avoid lunch/dinner hours. Long lines but goes fast."}
{"text":"A good burger place that has a variety of foods and drinks on the menu! I usually get their cheeseburger and it never fails. The meat is tender and flavorful and pairs well with ketchup. The fries are crispy and complement the burger very well. I like their concentrated, especially the Oreo one! It's thick and tasty but just a tad too sweet for my liking. The price isn't too bad and worth the portion and taste. In comparison with In n Out, I would say Shake Shack is a little under In N Out because of their sauce, price, and burger bun. Shake shack's burger buns tend to get soggy by the time I'm almost done with my burger. The sauce for In N Out burgers is more flavorful too."}
{"text":"This isn't rocket science. It's not even busy and it took 35 min for an order of fries and 2 shakes. Unacceptable. Get it together."}
{"text":"I've been to Shake Shack in NYC and Chicago, but this was my first time going to the location in Las Vegas. I was pleasantly surprised that when I arrived, the line wasn't very long and moved quickly. There was plenty of seating inside or outside.

SmokeShack Burger - cheeseburger topped with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and shacksauce. The burger was as good as I remember with a little kick. 

Cheese Fries - crinkle cut fries topped with a special blend of cheddar and american cheese sauce. While I thought the fries were good, I would prefer to just get the regular fries next time.

I also tried the peach lemonade and it was so refreshing on a hot day! 

If you're in Las Vegas, you should stop by Shake Shack for a great burger."}
{"text":"Having heard all of the insanely high praise about this place, I was ready for disappointment. I can tell you that I wasn't once disappointed in Shake Shack. The smokehouse burger was packed full of flavor and didn't leave me feeling weighed down or tired. The shake had a lot of flavor. The fries, not so much. They could have had a little more flavor. 

I recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I had the shroom burger with their crinkle fries. The mushroom portion of the burger was really good - melty, gooey cheese inside of fried mushroom.. mmmmm. The meat portion was too greasy but was a legit meat patty (compared to other fast food places). Fries on the other hand were not too greasy and perfectly crispy! I'm not a fan of crinkle fries but these fries were GOOD! Crispy and well seasoned."}
{"text":"It was pretty good but not the best I've tasted. Not as filling either. It's super expensive too. I'll not cheap at all but $31 for 2 burgers, 2 fries, and one small drink? That's ridiculous. For a burger place I'd expect more options as well. Not sure if I'd come back here. Great service and it's quick too though. I think In-N-Out or fat burger is way better, more filling, and cheaper."}
{"text":"I was so excited to check out this place but I feel the prices were a little bit high. The milkshakes were delicious but there is only one size. I feel they should offer different sizes so if you want more, you can get more. The burgers were pretty good ingredients but it didn't wow me. I loved the cheese fries since they didn't use a weird nacho cheese sauce. 

The atmosphere in the restaurant was pretty laid back and the overall architecture is nice. One problem I did have was that there was so much sunlight reflecting in off of the cars outside that it came in through all the windows. I would suggest adding some sort of screen that can be pulled down during the day. 

Other than that, this place was ok. It's better than Mcdonald's but I feel other burger places such as Smashburger have a little more to offer for the price."}
{"text":"Best burgers!! The prices are a bit high, but the burgers alone make it an easy 5 star."}
{"text":"Food was very good and the orders came out right. It is a bit pricey at $45 for 3 regular burgers, a hot dog, 2 shakes, 2 small sodas & 2 fries. There are free refills on your soda, but you need to take your cup up to where you order to ask for a refill. We will come back, just not very often due to price point."}
{"text":"Growing up on the west coast, all I ever craved was In N Out when I came to visit cali BUT Shake Shack changed everything for me. I didn't think I'd have a chance to try this east coast sensation unless I traveled all the way to NY but the stars aligned when I found it in Las Vegas. 
The fries are crinkle cut and crispy. The shake shack burger was simple but mmmm, so good. THEIR FROZEN CUSTARD THOUGH. If you were forced to order only one thing off the menu (hopefully that will never be the case), then get the frozen custard. It will make you wonder why you ever ate ice cream...creamy frozen custard in a cone is the way to go. 

Don't order the fifty/fifty, it was watered down a bit. Eh."}
{"text":"So good! Probably the best burger fries combo I've ever had. Try the shack stack, a cheeseburger topped with a fried portobello mushroom filled with cheese."}
{"text":"The ambiance is atypical, yet charming for a central located establishment. Sam is amazing in her customer while the other team members seem to be complacent in the status quo. Over all decent fat American foot that hits the spot, but will terrorize your next health check up."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic - friendly people smiles all around. If you're in the mood for comfort food don't hesitate to stop by here. The food is awesome a little on the pricey side but hey you get what you pay for. I had the smokeshack and the lady had the chiknshack. Both were equally delicious - especially the herb mayo on the chicken sandwich. We indulged further with the cheese fries and raspberry cheesecake shake. Please come on an empty stomach, time for the gym!"}
{"text":"We had burgers, fries and a strawberry shake. All very very good! One little bit that kind of was a drag was the slow and long line to order! They need to be quicker when taking orders or put more people on registers. Getting our food was super quick, so there was no other reason for the long line!"}
{"text":"My friend always stops at Shake Shack when he goes to NY so I was curious what they hype was. This place is order first and then go find a seat. They give you a buzzer to go pick up your food. I ordered the shroom shack and thought it was good but it did not blow me away. Tasty but not sure I would go back. I got it without a bun. Place is very loud which can or cannot be a good thing. The portions are super tiny. For me it is a good size but for my husband, he wanted two! They serve crinkle cut fries!"}
{"text":"Guys, we need to talk... about SHAKE SHACK!

Everyone and their brother have been beating the Shake Shack drum since they announced groundbreaking. As for me, I'm a big fan of local burgers but I'm open to friendly competition. After all, any opposition is either going to highlight better restaurants or force the homestead players to innovate and do better. Shake shack will definitely be ruffling some feathers with their remarkable burgers and high-quality ingredients.

I suggest you go in forgetting any prenotions that you've heard about the place. Just compare it to your favorite burger joint, hole-in-the-wall or upscale, doesn't matter. Everyone else has heard the good word already and the line is going to be unimaginable. I almost left when I pulled up on their second day open because the line was 3/4 wrapped around the building. I decided see how it was moving and to my surprise, they we're churning at 5-6 people a minute. Yeah, I'm game!

What made the wait even better was that they were giving out free samples to the peeps in line. I got to try the raspberry ginger lemonade and two different concretes before ordering, awesome! From the back of the line (estimate 110+ people) to the service counter was less than 25 minutes. It gave me plenty of time to choose my burger: Double SmokeShack with Lettuce & Tomato. The counter staff greet you with a \"Hey, what's shakin'?!\" and I thought it was cute and really breaks the ice nicely.

From the counter to walking out the door with my bag was maybe 5 minutes, great considering how busy it was. I unwrapped my burger as soon as I got to the car and took a moment to adore the perfect char on the outer rim of the patties. Seasoned perfectly, wonderful ShackSauce that is similar to just about any burger joint's \"Special\" sauce, only better. Fresh veggies and great proportions, and the BUN. Oddly enough the bun was slightly squishy/springy (imagine an Asian steamed bun, only starchier). It was the perfect vessel for such a great burger. Price-wise it was up there a bit, but it was one of the best burgers I've had from a restaurant in this neighborhood.

Fries were good, not \"blow your socks off\" but they had a consistent texture and flavor. Not surprisingly, they are definitely par cooked and frozen, and there's nothing really wrong with that, especially considering the size of the company. Once restaurant chains get bigger than a dozen or so stores, most go to the frozen route because otherwise they must test the sugar content of every shipment of potatoes that come in, per FDA nutritional reporting guidelines. That being said, they were really good fries. I wish I had asked for some extra ShackSauce to dip them in, but I got ketchup instead.

Long story short, don't let the lines scare you away. They are going to be slammed for the foreseeable future and have already built up enough rapport to commit to a second restaurant in the QC. It's a damn good burger, just make sure your schedule allows the wait!"}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch double-date with my Vegas favs. Located in the New York New York hotel, Shake Shack has their own entrance from the strip. If you love burgers Shake Shack is a good fairly-inexpensive spot to check out while visiting Vegas. There was a line when we went, but it is definitely worth trying at least once.  

Between the four of us, we ordered 2 single Shack Burgers ($5.29/each), 2 Shack Stacks ($9.59/each) and 2 orders of Fries ($2.99/each) to share. After ordering and paying at the cashier, we got pagers that would notify us when our orders were ready. While we waited, we grabbed our condiments and found a nice booth to sit down at. The seats here are first come, first serve. 

The one thing that really stood out to me was the potato bun that these burgers are served on. My Shack Stack came with everything you would find in a cheeseburger (burger patty, cheese, lettuce, tomato) with the addition of a shroomburger patty, a crisp fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheese and shack sauce!! For any mushroom lovers, I definitely recommend this burger!! It was unique and delicious. We all really liked the fries, almost in an unexpected way since I usually don't like crinkle cut fries. Their fries here were nice and crispy. 

I feel like the burger at Shake Shack is better than your average burger, but definitely not as good as a gourmet burger. The prices are a bit high for such a standard choice and the wait deters me from considering a return in the near future. I might go to their California location if it's convenient, but there are many alternate options for me to explore in Vegas before paying this place a second visit."}
{"text":"Last day in Vegas, the guys was craving for Shake Shack, I did not complain, it's been awhile since I had some.  As always, service was quick and swift, and food was good, had the following:

- 'Shroom Burger - Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce - good as always, hot filled portobello, hmmm

Definitely consistent from other locations!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends took me here for the first time last night and I was impressed.

We went around 10pm and we were promptly greeted by a friendly staff member. She handed us a menu before we stood in line. The line wasn't long and it didn't take long at all. I got a Shack Burger (single, no cheese) and fries. The burger was well seasoned and the vegetables were crisp. The atmosphere is modern and fun. The staff was very friendly and diligent. There was one member who was busing the dining room by the restrooms and he was extremely nice. He kept our table clean and even refilled our waters. I wish I knew his name for this review...but anyways yay for Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Pros & Cons 
Pros: burgers are delicious, French fries are delicious as well. friendly staff overall great customer service, clean environment. 

Cons: small burger big price. Also not only i but my whole family had a upset stomach for the remainder of the day."}
{"text":"The burgers are bomb. Great service. They give you a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The burgers here are amazing! Grass fed, hormone free beef... You think it's something hippy but by golly you can taste the difference when you've got good ingredients. Even the cheese on the fries tastes amazing and I don't even like cheese! The chocolate in the shake is like nothing you've ever had before. It's rich and luxurious. This place... you just have to try it!"}
{"text":"I've gone to the Shake Shake in New York and Orlando and this one is just as great! I went here while on a girls' trip and lucky for us there was no line when we arrived but there was a restaurant full of people eating. 

I ordered the cheeseburger and fries, which I always love. Their hamburger buns melt in your mouth and their patties are seasoned well. My friends got the chicken sandwich, one loved it, the other one wasn't too impressed, but she loved the fries (even though she isn't usually a fan of crinkle cut fries), so that was a good thing. 

Overall, I enjoyed every bit of my fatty goodness! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I think that everybody that posted a review here are not big eaters but I am a burger lover girl and why are the burgers so small on this place?!!!"}
{"text":"Great place and great food. The line was very long but moved pretty quickly. There is plenty of seating outside which we enjoyed using. This location has only been open a few weeks. Parking is bad at Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall. I would probably only go back here if we had shopping to do at that mall."}
{"text":"This place is pretty hard to beat. The bacon cheese burger and cheese fries are so good. I am so happy my hometown is getting a Shake Shack."}
{"text":"My first experience with Shake Shack was very shortly after this location in Downtown Summerlin opened in October 2015.  I've been back quite a few times since, and see no reason why I won't continue to frequent this place for its tasty burgers and desserts.

The restaurant has a clean, semi-urban feel with the cool addition of tables made from the wood of old bowling lanes.  It can be a touch noisy when the place is packed, but overall not bad.  When I've been at lunchtime, I've noticed this is a favorite place for the kids from one of the nearby middle/high school to gather and eat.  Kind of cool, given the relationship Shake Shack has with Communities In Schools.  More on that in a minute.  Most of the seating is inside, but when the weather permits, there's a decent amount of outdoor seating too.  You admire the gigantic menu on the wall when you walk in, order at the counter, take your number and find a seat.  Depending on how busy it is, they'll either call you up when your food is ready, or just might bring it to your table.

The burgers are all made from 100% hormone and antibiotic-free Angus beef, and there are vegetarian options on the menu too.  After trying the SmokeShack, the ShackBurger and the 'Shroom Burger (the vegetarian burger option), my solid favorite is the SmokeShack.  You can't go wrong with a bacon cheeseburger topped with chopped cherry peppers to add a mild zing.  Oh, be sure to get it as a double.  I've also tried the Shack-cago Dog.  While it's not thoroughly traditional, it's definitely a good variation on the Chicago style hotdog.  If you want a Chicago dog and can't find one prepared in the traditional way, this will definitely do.

Then there's dessert, which can be described in just three words:  frozen custard concretes!  If you're unfamiliar, a concrete is basically a shake that's too thick to drink through a straw.  Definitely try the totally addicting Summerlin S'mores.  To make a great place even better, this location is partnered with Communities In Schools (Nevada) and makes a small donation from the sale of every Summerlin S'mores, Red Velvet Rocks, and Crunch-stellation concrete.  So eat dessert and contribute to keeping kids in school!  (It makes the whole dessert thing guilt-free.) 

Parking: this location is in Downtown Summerlin, so there's no shortage of parking lots.  If you're pressed for time or don't want a long walk, be sure to park on the north end of the shopping center.  Now go eat!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  So good I was here 2 days in a row.  The first visit I had the shack stack - oh man is that dangerously good.  Lots of cheese.  The shakes are creamy, heavy and good (if you're stomach can handle).  The fries aren't my favorite but I'm not complaining about fried potatoes.  :)  I did get a stomach from food / cheese overload but it's ok.  

Next day I came back and had a single cheeseburger - so tasty.  Hubs loved it and thought it had so much flavor.  The creamsicle we'll pass on next time."}
{"text":"In a word: Overrated. 

The hype only lead to disappointment, because really the burger here is nothing special. I would take the price cut and go to in n out any day of the week.  

The decor and the amount of staff is prime. They run a tight operation it seems which is cool. The rotation of custard is also exciting, as I enjoyed the shake that I got. The chicken burger was significantly better than the hamburger.

I saw someone who got a burger that was like a big mac with one chicken and one beef patty, if I went back I would probably go down that route, but for the price the burger really is not worth it."}
{"text":"Finally a Shake Shack on the east coast!! Though not far east enough since I reside in Cali, but Vegas will do. I tried the Shack Stack & cheese fries. The cheese was put on the side since I ordered togo (which is better anyways, keeps the fries from getting soggy for slow eaters like myself). The Shack stack is the cheeseburger with a fried mushroom. Meat was good, mushroom was good, veggies are fresh & the cheese was pretty tasty. The only complaint I have is that when I requested the buns to be extra toasted the cashier says they run their buns through a machine so it'll burn the second round in. At In N Out, it is more possible since they toast their buns on the grill. Overall, I see why the east coast takes pride in this joint but In N Out still has my heart"}
{"text":"absolutely yummy!!! My kids agree best burger we've had ever!! Hawaiian bread buns and fresh grilled beef..wow!!! wish this place was in Cali!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to the Shake Shack. The employees were friendly. The menu is al a carte. We ordered two burgers, one chicken sandwich, two fries, one cheesy fry, one hot dog and three milkshakes and our total was over $52... The food was good. Portion size was small, which was perfect for me but the guys were still hungry when we finished our dinner. This probably won't be a frequent stop of ours but I'm sure we'll return. We did enjoy eating in, their decor was comfortable."}
{"text":"Amazing burger, but the price difference between a single and double is almost $3. The single burger is pretty small and I'm left still feeling hungry. The shakes are amazing though, so great for dessert."}
{"text":"Overpriced and nothing special. Burger had a hair in it and was undercooked. Fries are just frozen crinkle fries. Concrete ice cream is okay but really not worth the price. There are loads of better places at Scottsdale Mall. Would not recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"I might make my west coast people upset, but Shake Shack wins the battle of the 'fast food' burger joint.    I've tried Shake Shack at Grand Central Station in NYC and I'm glad one opened up here in Las Vegas.  

These burgers are not \"extravagant\" by any means but they are delicious.  I have tried a few including one on their secret menu.  

Starting with the best in my opinion:

Smoke Shack:  A Bacon Cheeseburger with shack sauce [I think it's like mayo/ketchup/mustard/pickle (?)] topped with chopped cherry peppers which give it just an amazing flavor and some heat.

I've also tried their Shack Stack which is one cheese burger and one Shroom Burger between two buns.  The shroom burger is crisp-fried portabello mushroom filled with gooey muenster and cheddar cheese.  

Finally, on the secret menu, I've tried the peanut butter and bacon burger.  I've never considered the combination before but apparently it's a thing.  They serve the peanut butter in a side cup here in Vegas to prevent cross contamination they say but I think it's pretty fun that way.  My daughter liked it more than I did.  Dipping your burger in peanut butter sauce was cool to her.

Shake shack also offers a variety of deserts, shakes, hot-dogs, and crinkle cut cheese fries!!   Yummy yummy cheese fries.  No need to say more. =)"}
{"text":"Been to Shake Shack in NY and loved it. I usually order the Shack Stack and Black & White milkshake. Vegas location not up to par. The breaded mushroom part is salty and the beef is not as tasty. I always endorse this place but I believe I wouldn't do the same for this location. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Definitely lives up to the hype. Place looks awesome. Long line, but moved quickly. Great location. The cheese fries are wonderful! Great ShackBurger.  Got the single patty, but will get the double next time."}
{"text":"I got to check out this Shake Shack due to a Yelp Elite event! 

I've been a fan of Shake Shack since I had my first burger from them in 2013. My first Shake Shack was in London, England...not even in the USA! I haven't had Shake Shack since June 2014, so I  was very much looking forward to the Yelp Elite Event to check it out!

Try the classic cheeseburger, some cheese fries, and an IPA. You truly cannot go wrong with that combination. Some compare their fries to In-an-Out. I think Shake Shack wins hands down. I would take their fries every day. 

The frozen custard was the only thing that could've been improved on. I didn't think mine was the best in terms of presentation and taste. But, my prior experience with Shake Shack won't influence the rating on that!

There is tons of parking at Downtown Summerlin. You may have to walk a bit, but it is so worth it. They have a nice little patio as well! 

Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This is the best Shake Shack.  My little family and I have been Shake Shack fans for many years now since we lived in NYC. We have tried different locations in both East Coast and Las Vegas.   Since we moved to LV, this Shake Shack in Summerlin has been our family's fav go-to burger joint.  My 5 year-old daughter even prefers Shake Shack over McDonald's (McDonald's has toys). We love the doublecheese burgers, fries, chocolate shake with malt and vanilla custard. Their potato buns are just the best.  Burger patties are juicy not oily.   Plus this location has the greatest customer service.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  They come around to greet customers at the tables. And most often they offer to bring the food to you even though this is a fast food, get-it-yourself restaurant.  The restaurant is clean and spacious. It is not like the ones in NYC -- small and crowded.  You will fall in love with it if you give it a try."}
{"text":"Food was awesome and price was right compared to the hotel restaurants. Closes at 2am every night. They do sell beer as well.

You can eat inside and outside! Didn't care for the water but i am bias because I just came back from Aruba and where the water is exceptional!!

We are here about 3 times in one weekend! That's how good it was!

Highly recommend this place and the employees are very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and will not go again.  The food is mediocre and for the price forget it there isn't much bang for your buck.  Everything is small and the price is large.  Frankly you can get a better burger for this price point elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been to Shake Shack a few times in Hollywood.

This was a first in Vegas and it did not disappoint.  I came in one night with three other people for an after show meal.  I wasn't super hungry from our dinner before so I went with their Peanut Butter Shake.  OMG!  This is the best shake flavor here.  The off menu cookies and creme one was also delightful but the PB shake is the ultimate shake here.  The burgers and fries were also amazing.  Props to those crispy crinkle fries.  Oh so yummy!  Cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"AMAZING BURGERS AND GREAT PLACE TO CATCH UP WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY. Wasn't busy when I came in the morning and the way the dinning is arranged along with the decor creates a sense of light openness and privacy at the same time. First time here and the burgers are the best I have ever tried. Me and my friend shared foods and cutting the burger even with a plastic knife is like the knife-through-butter technique used in taekwondo. 

Me and my friend finished eating and was catching up on life when a professional and accommodating server came by to take our trash which I did not expect to happen. A few moments later we also got refills for our drinks. We really appreciate all that you guys did. Thank you for starting our reunion with an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Literally one of the best burgers I've ever had. Cute restaurant I love the menu setup. I would definitely come back here ;)"}
{"text":"not really impressed first of all this place is to expensive 16bucks for one double cheese burger fries and a small soda not worth it at all .in n out destroys this place I would never come back the food wasn't even close to tasting good  don't waste your time."}
{"text":"During my short trip to Vegas I decided to finally try Shake Shack for the first time... and HOLY COW was I blown away. I can't believe I waited so long to try this place!! I ordered The Shack Stack burger and the cheesy fries and OMG, everything was SO GOOD. Cheeseburger + fried portobello was so juicy and flavorful. Literally melted in my mouth. The cheesy crinkle fries were nice and crispy with a ton of cheese on it. Definitely lives up to the hype and will be back!!"}
{"text":"If you want a seriously meaty tasting (and salty) burger, give this place a try. It'll fill your meat/burger craving. Got the double smoke shack and it hit the spot. Fries with cheese ....oh so good! 

The just ok side...hot dogs. I really wonder how Hot dog can be amazing though.

Don't forget to get your shake!"}
{"text":"Great service. Amazing food. My whole family enjoyed the experience. Victor the manager was very accommodating and made us feel at home. It was one of the best burgers I've ever had! We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"I was excited to check out the new Shake Shack in Phoenix and was craving a burger and fries!  I had only eaten at a Shake Shack back East, so excited to see their growth in the Valley.  We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon around 4pm and it was surprisingly busy especially for as hot as it was outside.  The staff was very friendly and welcoming, the food came out quickly and I enjoyed my meal.  The cheeseburger and crinkle cut fries were quite tasty and definitely a splurge as they are packed full of calories and fat!  Next time, I'll try a shake...couldn't indulge in all of those calories at one time!"}
{"text":"No complaints here. My shroom burger was delicious crunchy and filled w cheese! Line moved quick and tables were clean and plentiful."}
{"text":"I  bias because I am born and breed So Cal In-N-Out eater.  The service does not have smile and also I have to clean my own table.

Although I am a big In-N-Out fan, the sharp cheddar is really good.  The patties have special seasoning.  The food is fresh compared to my mothership."}
{"text":"Delicious. Not much else to say that hasn't been said. Definitely one of the best burger places I've eaten at. Their standard burger was great. My one gripe with it would be that they use green-leaf lettuce instead of iceberg. I think iceberg is better for hoagies and burgers. Their cheese fries are delicious. Wasn't sure I'd be down with the crinkle cut fries (reminds me of high school cafeteria lunch) but I totally am. Milkshake was super chocolaty and tasty. Limited seating for how many people can fill this vegas location. I'll be craving this burger until Shake Shack comes to Seattle next year. Until then I'll stick to Dick's and Burgermaster"}
{"text":"I shoved one of these burgers so hard into my gullet that it left me begging for mercy and screaming for a salted caramel shake to wash it down. Each succulent buttery bun adds that thicc element to my tasty experience. The meat was juicy as all can be and my teeth sunk into it with PLEASURE. Overall I left the Shake Shack and new man and begging for mercy and more."}
{"text":"The burgers here is pretty good. Place was very busy and crowded. I wished they had more seats for people to sit in, but luckily there are plenty of outdoor seating. The staff was friendly and patient. They made sure to double check our order to get it right the first time. 

We had the double smoke shack. It was a double patty burger with cheese, red bell peppers, and bacon. The burger actually had flavor to it and overall was not bad m. The bun was soft and toasted to perfection. 

The French fries were crinkle cut. They were crispy and were not greasy. I actually enjoyed the fries a lot. Just your regular cooked perfectly fries. 

I also had a strawberry shake and that was thick, but delicious!! Perfect amount of flavor and it wasn't to sweet or watered down. I would get this and the fries again.

Overall this place gets a solid four because everything tasted pretty good. Nothing too fancy or special. I would recommend this place and would come back to try it again."}
{"text":"Great burgers and custards. Try their specialty items. They also use crinkle cut fries which are perfectly crispy. If you buy one of their cookbooks you get a free burger coupon for your next visit. The line usually moves pretty quick."}
{"text":"BUUURGGGGERSSSS + SHAAAAAAAAAAAAKES. Let's do this! You really can't miss this place as it's a great iconic place located on The Strip now right next to New York-New York and Monte Carlo.

This always happens to be our first stop when we arrive at Vegas. Most likely because we tend to arrive around lunch time and this is such a great, quick stop.

The line goes by soooo fast! Most of the time, I don't have enough time to make up my mind whilst I stare at the huge menu of options. Burgers, shakes, hot dogs, what's not to get?!

FAVS:
- Shack Stack: SO GOOD. Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce. The fried mushroom does it for me (for a vegetarian option of the same thing: try the 'Shroom Burger).
- Cheese Fries: All the cheesy goodness!! One order is good to share for 2-5 people (depending on how much everyone eats).
- Frozen Custard or Concrete: If it's your first time, definitely try one! I personally prefer the Concrete (it's basically like a mix-up of everything you like + frozen custard!)

I think the brioche bun gets me every time on those burgers. They give it a little oomph! Will definitely be back. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Really good here  .... I have the smoke and the shake burger , I did ask season fries and I got cheese fries still good and got me a Pokemon also ...."}
{"text":"I had tried this chain in NYC and thought it was pretty good, but I honestly didn't get they hype but when I heard one opened up nearby in Scottsdale I thought I would give it another try. The bread on the Shack burgers is really moist and tasty and the burger is good but it just doesnt stack up to other burger chains in my opinion. I personally think In-N-Out or Habit is much better for half the cost. I dont really get the appeal but hey go stand in the 30min line and you be the judge."}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place and the comparisons to In-N-Out that I had to give it a try.   I had no idea they had a shake shack at the mall until I stumbled upon it on a humbug.   I ordered the double cheeses burger with cheese fries and a shake.    The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because the shake was good,  and the cheese fries were pretty good,   The burger was horrific.    How dare you guys compare this to in-n-out!   That's blasphemous at its finest.    The burger was in seasoned,  bland and tasted mediocre at best.    The reason why it gets 2 stars instead of 3 is the cost.  Burger,  shake and cheese fries came up to like 25 dollars.    Way to expensive for the quality."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. As soon as we came in we were offered the special custard of the day!  Ordered the bacon burger and shack stack and cheese fries. All pretty good except the portobello mushroom was not as good as I hoped. Part of it was flat and hard to chew. I think grilling it may be more flavorful. Portion size would be small for a big eater. Place is clean, bright and has a nice energy. Service was friendly, but what the nicest touch was, a host came to clear our table and offered a refill on our large drink. Service is the key!  And of course good food. Great first experience!"}
{"text":"Shack Stack is where its at! 
Came here on a Sunday evening and the wait was only about 10 minutes. 
While I thought the cheeseburger was nothing too special for the price, the mushroom portion of the shake stack was amazingly good. Mushroom and gooey melted cheese? Heck yeah! The size of the burgers are comparable to an In and Out. 

The cheese fries were about what one would expect from cheese on fries. I appreciate that they used the kringle fries. I prefer thicker cut fries. We also had the Concrete which was pretty good, but I think we should of gone with a milkshake instead. 
If were in a 2-3 casino walking range from Shake Shack, I would certainly say its worth the trip."}
{"text":"Since I had never had shake shack before, I told my hubs that we had to try it when we came to Vegas. This SS is located on the strip - outside of NY NY casino. We went during lunch time and even though they were busy, we are able to order pretty quickly and the food followed shortly after we are seated. 

We decided to split a burger (mind you, we had never eaten here before) ordered fries and a chocolate malt. The burger is probably the perfect size for me, but for my hubs, it's a little too small. We ordered a shake shack burger - basically a cheeseburger. It was okay. Every bite I took, I couldn't help but just taste grease. I couldn't taste the special sauce either which was a big bummer. 

But the fries were the best part about the $15 we spent there. The fries were pretty crispy, which is how I love my fries to be. I'm not a big fan of the crinkle fries, but I am if its from SS! 

Overall it was an okay experience. I'm definitely open to trying something different the next time we come across SS."}
{"text":"Hmmmm..... Not a fan at all.  Been wanting to try Shake Shack for a while to compare it with In and Out, Five Guys, etc.  

Ordered a double shake burger, suppose to be a regular hamburger, and regular fries.  The regular burger became a single shake burger when I got it.  The burgers just didn't have much flavor with the exception of the saltiness of the burger.  I was anticipating that it might be a bit salty, hence I order a regular hamburger to see if there would be a difference caused by the cheese... but never got that chance (didn't want to waste food).  The buns were fresh, but to the point where it didn't really hold up to the meat and was too soft.  The best part of the meal was actually the regular fries.  I think I'm sticking to In and Out.

The staff were helpful and efficient in what they were doing and keeping the place clean.  So props for that, but not for the food."}
{"text":"Last night I had the pleasure of trying The Shake Shack frozen custard, while attending An Epicurean Affair. 

Yummy yummy toffee goodness. Perhaps the finest custard I've tasted.
The manager was dispensing this delight and, she herself, took the goodness up a notch. What a winning personality! 

If one is looking for joy to brighten the day, stop on by for the frozen custard and a truly warm-hearted reception!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit! And I got the shack burger! It was very good! I will get it again next time! The fries was good but basic!"}
{"text":"Great tasting burger and best french fries in years crispy and tender inside with a great flvor, and I usually am not a french fry lover, but I could not stop eating them! My husband said that the shake was fantastic and I had soda due to being lactose. intolerant. I would go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Fake shakeshack in the name of New York Shake Shack!!! :/

Ordered the cheese fries, chicken sandwich and chicken hotdog...none of it was good!"}
{"text":"I've seen so many checkins, pictures, and reviews for the shake shack on my Yelp friends pages, that I had to check it out. 
This Vegas Strip location has it figured out. They streamlined the order and payment process by having multiple lines with many cashiers. 
The burgers and fries were very good. They even have beer at this location! Yay .  My expectations were met and I had a very nice experience."}
{"text":"They didn't get our order right and the service was not the friendliest but the food is soooo dang good that I have to give this place five stars! Get the burger with mushroom stuffed with cheese! Yum!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are delicious! They compare so much to in n out but I find these better, being that I'm from California. They are quite small but the quality is definitely there. The service was fast! The way it works is, you order first then find a table then when your buzzer goes off you go pick up! They have workers going around cleaning and picking up trays which I found good. The meat was very good and cooked perfectly. They have crinkle cut fries! MY FAV. I had a wonderful experience here and I will definitely return during my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for the last couple of years and finally tried it. I cannot say enough about this concept. The staff was fast, friendly and helpful. I ordered the chicken shack as I am not a huge fan of burgers and it was out of this world amazing. The barbecue sauce was tangy, the pickles were thick and juicy and the chicken was fresh and fried perfectly. It was better than Chick fil A in my opinion and that is saying alot. My family had a variety of burgers, an order of fries and a vanilla shake and each were equally impressive. I also had the Shack made strawberry lemonade and it was also fantastic."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I want to thank Shake Shack for reaching out to me after my first visit; they really do want to make sure everyone that comes through their doors has a great dining experience!

I decided to give the same Shake Shack location another try, especially with the day having better conditions. This time, I went with the Shack Stack burger (cheeseburger & Shroom burger) as well as their seasonal BBQ Bacon Cheese Fries; I was anything but disappointed his time around!

The burger had some seriously gooey (and Hot!) Cheese, which was just phenomenal. The fries were simply Divine with the mixture of the bacon and choice of cheese. This was no mere canned cheese from Smart & Final (big ups to S&F, though)..!

The cement and shakes will have to wait for next time, but there deffo will be a next time now!

So, yes.. I will admit my script got flipped compared to the initial review. But let it be known I still hate In N Out, as a Native Californian!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations based on the hype from my east coast l friends. It was ok. mediocre and unimpressive. The curly fries reminded me of those I'd get at the high school cafeteria. I loved those back then but is that the bar to set for fries? 

The hamburger was teeny tiny. It was the mushroom burger and for $6.99 I'd think it should have more substance than a small McDonalds hamburger. 

Maybe the shakes are the appeal. It is called Shake Shake after all. 

And yes, as many have said In 'n Out is not only a more substantial meal - it is a better one."}
{"text":"I've had different types of burgers and they were all great. The hot dog is just okay.  Love the fries. The concretes and shakes are good and it's cool that they switch up the flavors. Sometimes it's a little slow, but nothing I've had to complain about yet.  Overall, I really like this place."}
{"text":"Got the smoked burger (pickled peppers make it spicy and strongly sour), mushroom burger, at. Patty's fries (horseradish, bacon and green onions), and black and white shake (vanilla with chocolate syrup). All very good, all very small. It's all kid sized, even the fountain drink. What is this, for ants?! I split it between two people and we were still hungry."}
{"text":"Delicious food, ridiculous prices. Their cheese fries and their SmokeShack paired with any of their shakes is an amazing lunch! I just wish I didn't have to fork out $20+ every time"}
{"text":"A little bit of NY on the west coast. I dig it. 

I will always love this place no matter where the location (NY, PA or Vegas)."}
{"text":"SHAKE STACK. That's all you need to know. It is a cheeseburger combined with the 'Shroom Burger. What is the 'Shroom Burger you ask? Well it is a beautiful creation of a breaded and fried portobello mushroom filled with gooey melted muenster and cheddar cheeses. The patty was perfectly cooked and juicy without getting the bun soggy and the inclusion of the muenster cheese added a nice bit of sharpness. If double cheese isn't enough for you be sure to add an order of the crinkle cut Cheese Fries. Indulge your sweet tooth with frozen custards, shakes and floats. This is an order at the counter and seat yourself type of place, and due to its popularity the line can get long but its so worth it."}
{"text":"My first time at Shake Shack. I was sad that they didn't have a Chicken burger because I don't eat the normal hamburgers with beef patty but my girlfriend loves burgers so we decided to come here. I got the portobello shroom burger and she got the cheeseburger with cheese fries. My burger was delicious. One of my favorites that I have tried and the fries were cooked to a crisp which I love. She also loved her burger. I would recommended the portobello mushroom!"}
{"text":"It's good, but not something to go crazy over.  I could live with without it. Some people say it's better than in-n-out, but I personally don't think so."}
{"text":"I stayed at the New York New York so of course I have to stop by Shake Shack!  I had never heard of this East Coast change before this so when my gal friend said we had to go, I just shrugged and assented.  I wasn't about to argue since she had already graciously to go to In N Out with me!

I ordered the standard Shack Burger even though I wanted the Shack Stack (but since we had a class afterwards, I didn't want to risk nausea or worse, throwing up from eating too closely to exercising.  Since both of us did not care of In N Out fries the day before (we already knew that going in) and ended up throwing away a lot of fries, we decided to share one order of fries between us here.  The fries are SO MUCH BETTER.  They are crispy crinkle-cut style.  Yum.  They were fresh and not soggy (from sitting around) at all.  It was still a good idea to share an order, though.  The quality of burger was really excellent and I'm one who can be kind of picky about that stuff.  Yum.  

My friend ordered the Shack Stack and it looked amazing!!!!  She said it was super good but left a couple of bites uneaten because she was too full.  She had also ordered a shake with it, so that would explain it.  I liked the sizes of the shakes and floats - very moderate and not outrageous.  I prefer quality over quantity.  I went with the root beer float since I wanted a taste of their custard but not a whole shake (again the whole heavy foods right before exercising thing).  I would come here again!"}
{"text":"I have only heard how crazy the wait is at the NYC location. So obviously there's a huge hype. So I decided to try their Smoke Shack (basically a bacon burger), their fries and strawberry shake. Their fries were super crispy and not greasy. The shake was creamy and perfect thickness. However the burger was ok. Tasted fine but nothing to write home about. It was $7 and it was not really big. At In n Out you can get almost the same size burger for half the price. I personally would be upset if I waited more than an hour to eat their burger. I feel In N Out still has the best burger. The fries and shake were good here but I would not come back."}
{"text":"I've been to various Shake Shacks in New York, D.C., and now in Las Vegas. There have been times where I've eaten the Shack Stack burger and the cheese wasn't melted thoroughly inside the portobello mushroom. I've forgiven them for those times because the food there is still legit. This is one of the places people hype up but I think their quality stands true to their ratings. 

I highly recommend to get the following:
-Shack Stack (a cheeseburger that includes a crisp-fried portobello mushroom with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses)
-Cheese fries (crinkle cut fries topped with melted cheese)
-Rootbeer 

Many people compare Shake Shack to In N Out. While I've tried both, I think each of them have their pluses (Shake Shack has a solid Shack Stack burger with actual crispy crinkle cut fries and In N Out has their customizable burgers/fries with their signature sauce). Try out Shake Shack if you're able to!"}
{"text":"Oh Shake Shack, you're the only one who can make me cheat on In-N-Out. Being from California, maybe I'm a little biased because honestly, In-N-Out is literally right down the street from me. But Shake Shack is my special lovely mistress from Las Vegas. 

New York New York hotel now charges for parking, although the first hour is free. You'll need more than that to rest after stumbling on over hungover in the heat. It seems to always be pretty busy, so snagging a table was excruciatingly depressing. Have someone scout for a table while someone else orders for them. 

I always get the good old Shack Burger, no need for fancy toppings. The bun is fluffy but not mushy, the patty is perfectly soft. It just looks kinda soggy and underwhelming, but the taste is perfect to me. They have other options as well, such as a veggie burger with portobello instead of a patty. 

I dislike the fries here, as I like my fries on the crispier side. My friend ordered the cheese fries and they were SUPER salty. Between the five of us we couldn't finish it. My friend also ordered the Oreo shake, personally it was way too sweet for me but I'd give the shakes another chance. 

The great thing about Shake Shack is that there's a lot of menu options, and alcoholic options as well. Shake Shack has stolen my heart and although their food can be mediocre, nothing beats their burgers as a hangover cure."}
{"text":"Wouldn't go out of my way to go here. In&Out style burger cooked well-done. Can't get it any other way and I like my burgers medium-rare. They say the shakes are great."}
{"text":"I really don't get the hype. They're not bad at all, but they're definitely nothing to write home about. Their biggest plus, they have good buns and they don't drown the burger in sauce. Expensive as crap, but maybe that's just cause I'm on the strip in Vegas. Spend the extra money on a Lyft to the other side of the freeway and go to In N Out."}
{"text":"Good burgers, fries ok. Very busy and they seemed to be on a learning curve but very nice staff."}
{"text":"Perhaps I'm spoiled by the amazingness of In-N-Out, but I don't think Shake Shack lives up to the hype. Was it a good burger? Yes. Was it mind-blowingly good? Nope. I prefer In-N-Out's sauce to Shake Shack's and the cheese fries were underwhelming (did they just melt a Kraft Single over the fries?).

Overall, the atmosphere of the restaurant is hip and fun and I can now say \"I've eaten at Shake Shack,\" but I probably won't return because it's just an OK burger."}
{"text":"So I wanted to give Shake Shack another chance since I hear my friends raving about it all the time. I hated it when we went to the location at New York New York casino because it was just so oily and it was so crowded. I had a completely different experience here. 

Located at the District at Green Valley Ranch, it sits at the corner right across from REI. The bf, myself and my son came in for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon and it was not busy at all. There was lots of seating, but the dining area is a little small. I can see this place packed on weekends. The restaurant was clean, employees were friendly and our food came out fairly quickly. 

Here's the rundown on the food. I was expecting a greasy mess like last time, but not here. I ordered the Chick'n Shack and the bf ordered the double burger. My chicken was fresh, hot and crispy. The pickles in my burger were nice and thick, not the flimsy pickles at other places. I took a bite of my bf's burger and it was equally as tasty. The meat wasn't oily at all. The buns for these burgers were so soft. Our fries had the perfect crunch and even drenched in cheese, they were still good. I just wish the burgers were a little bigger. I unwrapped my burger and my first response was \"that's it?\" Don't get me wrong, my food was pretty tasty, but I just wish there was more of it. Especially for the price, $27 for 2 small burgers, fries and a small drink is a bit steep.

I'm glad this location changed my mind about Shake Shack. They do have good burgers and fries. I'm not sure if I'll be eating here often, but I wouldn't be opposed if someone suggested it."}
{"text":"After trying to figure out what we were going to eat last night, we decided to give this place a try. I was really impressed and the wait was about 3 mins until we got our food. Only downfall was the loud music inside. I'd recommend this place if you are looking for a good burger or chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"It sure what the hype is about. Been wanting to try this brand for a while based off what everyone in Vegas tells me.

Came here a couple days ago and decided to go with the top recommendations. There wasn't hardly a wait at all here. It was around 8:30 at night and the dining room was empty. Maybe a couple of people finishing up.

Went ahead and ordered the shack attack. It's basically a burger with a breaded mushroom studded with cheese then fried and put in the middle. Sounds amazing right? I thought so too. When i got the burger i asked where the meat patty was. The young girl said it was there. I lifted the mushroom and low and behold a small little party was there. I cut the burger in half and yes this magnificent golden river of melted cheese began to erupt. Overall the burger was good. My gripe is that for almost $10 it should have had a little more flavor and yes... a little more in general. I was still way hungry. The bun and meat patty were the size of a cheeseburger from the Golden Arches place. 3/5

Decided to try the double down fries.... frozen fries covered in a nacho cheese sauce and some bacon bits on top... $9... yeah... no. 2/5

Overall it was a clean place and the staff was friendly. But for the price I wasn't too impressed."}
{"text":"The first time I ever had Shake Shack was in Chicago and I'm glad I tried it. I had never heard of it before until I watched a Top 10 video on YouTube for best fast food burger places. To my surprise the number one spot went to Shake Shack. I was so confused because I had never even heard of the restaurant before. I quickly googled it and found out there was one in the very city I was living in! After that first taste of Burger Shack, I was sold.

The Las Vegas Shake Shack is no different from any other location I've been to. It's always packed. Be prepared to stand in a long line depending on what time you go. I've seen the lines coil or go out the front door. Also prepare to see some high prices for fast food burgers. They may look intimidating, but I personally think it's worth it.

This Shake Shack has a very large dining area which was great. It was packed but my partner and I were still able to find seating. Every time I've gone the workers have been very nice and high energy even though they are dealing with mobs of people.

Each time I've went I've gotten a burger, fries (sold separately) and a shake. I'll be honest and say I ordered a SmokeShack burger each time. I love the SmokeShack and since I don't visit Shake Shack a lot I always have a taste for this burger.

The SmokeShack has the ShackSauce, cherry peppers, and smoked bacon. Everything blends perfectly together. The ShackSauce gives it a savory sweet flavor, the peppers add a nice acidic bite, and the bacon gives it a smoky and (need I say it?) a bacon flavor. The burger patties are flattened, but that gives them that crispy outer texture and the flavor of the meat is that delicious, rich, fatty beef flavor that I know most people are looking for in a burger. The hamburger buns are nice and fresh which just adds to the experience. The hamburger buns are fresh which just adds to the experience. 

My one gripe is that I wish the burger was bigger. As far as fast food burgers go, these burgers are small. Even the double isn't very big. I'm not sure if the price of the burger matches the size. The quality does though.

The fries are delicious. They are crinkle cut so when cooked well they have that perfect crispiness. I felt that they are salted well and they match well with the burgers. As for the shakes, they are the one thing that I would say are a must (if you like ice cream that is). I've tried the peanut butter, mud pie, and pumpkin pie shakes. Each time the shake has been very thick to the point where it's difficult drinking through the straw (I like that) and each time the shake has exceeded my expectations. They truly taste like their ingredients except magnified. It tasted like I was eating an ice cream pumpkin pie when I had the shake. They are amazing and the restaurant definitely lives up to its name.

If you eat at Shake Shack be prepared to spend more than you would at other fast food restaurants. But also be prepared to have very high quality fast food. It's rare for me to find food where I think the quality outshines the price/quantity, but Shake Shack pulls it off. However, I don't think I would enjoy it as much without getting the whole meal. I think collectively the meal deserves a 5. Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Fun place to get a quick burger on the Strip. Seating can get a little tight at peak times, which probably explains the flat plywood bottom chairs, but it's a great place for fast food that's several notches above typical fast food in Las Vegas. Don't forget to order a shake too!"}
{"text":"What we ordered: Shroom Burger, Chili Cheese Dog, Shac-ago Dog, Chili Cheese Fries, Take the Cupcake Concrete.

Shroom Burger: every cheffy cooking competition TV show needs to try this burger. It's meatless, subbing a beef patty with a stuffed breaded and fried mushroom cap but don't let that stop you from trying it! I love that they left a tiny bit of the bun still attached at the back to keep all the toppings from squishing out the back when you take a bite. I love the crunch. I love the flavor. I love the soft fluffy bun. Most of all, I love the way the molton cheese explodes out of the sandwich with the first bite making it an experience as well as a delicious mess of awesomeness!  5 stars.

Chicago dog: I've hunted vegas high and low for a good Chicago dog since coming here from Chicago. It's hard to live up to the magical creations of those Lakeshore Drive boardwalk vendors with their pushcarts but they don't use two different kinds of pickles and their store bought relish just can't cut the mustard now that I've been to shake shack.   Move over Chicago.  Five stars.

Chili cheese dogs and fries: the dogs and fries are good but the chili is fan-freaking-tastic. It's like the best pulled pork truck in the South met the best chili truck in Texas and they ran here to Vegas and eloped! From the very first bite my tongue was doing backflips and my tastebuds started playing the national anthem on thousands of tiny kazoos!  FIVE STARS because fifty isn't an option!

Concrete: as an avid concrete connoisseur I can't honestly call this concrete. Delicious yes. Custard perhaps. But not a concrete. The hallmark of a concrete is the ability to tip the cup upside down just before handing it to the customer and that would never work with this. That said it was tasty and unique. 4 stars.

Overall: DEFINITELY COMING BACK!!!"}
{"text":"Holy shit, this was amazing. So good. Amazing. Good enough to make me want to go to New York and try it there. Seriously stupid good.

We all had the SmokeStack burgers with drinks and fries. The cherry peppers on the burger gave them a wonderful kick that I wasn't expecting. We shared a side of fries between 3 people and they were amazing. I usually don't like crinkle-cut fries because they always taste weird, but there were fantastic. Crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. And they have mayo in packets at the condiment bar!

Next visit to Vegas will definitely include at least one trip here."}
{"text":"Nope. Not gonna do it. Im gonna have to disagree with a majority of peeps being a fan of these guys with 4 stars. As to all up and coming trends, I usually feel the need to check it out just to satisfy my curiosity.

At first I thought they were actually inside the New York New York Hotel and Casino. Nope. To access them you have to go outside to go inside the restaurant. If you see a line going out the door and down the stairs, don't worry, this is normal for the time being. Im assuming eventually the hype will die down. To my surprise, the line moves pretty fast.

I like how they keep the line moving because they are fully staffed to handle the demand. This goes for cashiers, cooks, and bussers. The only issue I have with the place is that there are not enough tables and chairs to accommodate the lunch and dinner rush. From my observation, about half the time, people that ordered just had it to go because they did not want to hassle waiting for a table to open. If you are not by yourself, have another person scope for a table as soon as you get in line. By the time you order, you should have a table ready to go. 

As for the food, I went with the Shack Stack ($9.49), Cheese Fries ($3.95), and a regular drink ($2.75). The Shack Stack was just a basic cheeseburger with a big ass breaded portobella mushroom filled with a some kind of liquid cheese. Pro tip: when you first get it, dont bite into it right away. Let it cool down a bit. Yes, I freakin burned my lips and tongue on the damn thing but it was pretty good though. The Cheese Fries were just that. Crinkle cut fries with a melted velveeta type cheese on it. As for the drink, THERE'S NO REFILLS! 

In closing, spending 20 bucks for a basic cheeseburger meal with cheese fries and a drink is a bit much. Heck even 10 bucks might be overdoing it. I get it. Prices are jacked up because its located on the strip. It's good. Just not 20 bucks good. Its just ok. I finished my meal and it was just right. So you're telling me I gotta shell out 80 bucks for a family of 4 from a supposedly fast food joint? No thanks. This visit was my first. Might be my last.

{"text":"Exactly that. Simple burger fries and shakes. The seats are uncomfortable but the food and ambiance is great. I don't like the fries the shakes are great. And you can add malt! That is always a bonus."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. I will definitely be coming back. Happy to have a great new burger place in the summerlin area."}
{"text":"I don't always spend $32 on burger chains, but I'm glad to have finally visited the famous Shake Shack. We waited in line about 15 minutes and then waited about 20 more for our food, so this isn't the place to go in a rush. I had the SmokeShack (bacon cheeseburger) with a salted caramel shake and he had the Shack Stack (mushroom burger) with a strawberry shake, and we split crinkle fries -- plenty of food and way more calories than two people could ever need. It was all delicious -- to the point of making us almost glad not to live near a Shake Shack for frequent visits."}
{"text":"Ahh....so,so. Greasy. Expensive. People were nice. Probably won't be back. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would!!!  Burgers are soooooo good!!!!  Prices are excellent for Vegas. We each had a burger and split a fry and had the raspberry ginger lemonade for 23 bucks!!!!
That lemonade is amazing!!!!  It was worth the walk!"}
{"text":"I have been hearing about the Shake Shack for months, so I decided to go while we were in Las Vegas. This Shake Shack is located in New York-New York Hotel and Casino. First of all the line was long but it moved quickly. There were plenty of places to sit outside and inside. It was so crowded we did not get a place to sit inside but we did get a place to sit outside. The burger itself was very good. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger but I did not know that it did not come with lettuce and tomato. My husband ordered a double cheeseburger and that one did come with lettuce and tomato. The Fries; not that great,  they were just typical crinkled fries. Their prices extremely high for the quantity you get. Lastly, New York New York now makes you pay for parking. We were there for one hour and four minutes and we had to pay $7 for parking. So once again the burger was great it was very seasoned and tasty, the fries not so good,  the price is not so good but I do want to go back and try their shake which was almost $6."}
{"text":"The best. Love all their offerings and went twice during my last Vegas trip. Great food and a quality experience every single time!"}
{"text":"This place offers a very high quality burger for a fast-casual joint. The service and quality were both good, for someone that doesn't eat much fast food this was something I could definitely eat again. The only problem with ever coming back here again if I get a fast food craving is the price. For what would have likely cost me no more than $7-8 at In 'n Out, my meal here was just over $16. I would say the quality here is very comparable to In 'n Out or Habit Burger but the prices are tough to justify. The location is good though, if shopping in Kierland. My east coast friends rave about this place and I can see why, since they don't have In 'n Out. There's a good variety here if you're looking for something different."}
{"text":"Best burger in town and the fries are always crispy! Love the local vibe with the desserts and that raspberry ginger lemonade is the best."}
{"text":"Great burger ! fries so good! chicken shack burger with huge chicken patty and pickles is delicious."}
{"text":"First timer here! I must say it's awesome! The menus on the wall to look over. Surprisingly they have treats for dogs too! There's also whinge and beer. The staff are friendly and they look as if they enjoy their job.  You can eat outside or inside. The food doesn't take long to cook either and it's fresh! I ordered a salted caramel shake. It was delicious and sweet.  My friends ordered a chicken sandwich and a bacon cheeseburger. They loved it.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Shake shack wasn't bad, had pretty good burgers, and fast service. Only reason I guess I can't give it a 5 star is because of the pricing. The prices are pretty steep for how small the burger and overall portions are. I also didn't think their milkshake was super fantastic, honestly, I liked in n out milkshakes better. I would definitely visit again though."}
{"text":"I really only came here for the frozen custard, but was surprised how good the burger was. That bread is so good and compliments the burger perfectly. All of my food was great, the only part that was not so great was the prices. I paid about $18 for a bacon cheeseburger, fries, drink, and some custard. It was good but I can't eat here that often with those prices."}
{"text":"Shake shack is good but a little pricey for a small burger. In N Out I still think is better and cheaper. However, this place is worth trying. The shakes and the fries are better than the actual burgers."}
{"text":"Never disappointed whenever I go here. I live pretty far from the strip so this is a treat whenever I'm near the location! It's one of the better places to go for casual burgers, shakes, fries, etc! I love it so much and shakes are pretty good and I love the changing of the flavors they offer. I recommend this place over In N Out (sorry ) my boyfriend always tells his friends from out of town about this place and they also end up loving it too!"}
{"text":"Burger and fries were tasty, but not worth the wait in line or the overly crowded dining area or the cashier who barely said a word to us as we ordered or the walk through a casino to get there. I'd eat the food again, but not until it's open away from The Strip. It's overhyped. Good for them, profit off it while you can!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and not really frozen custard.  Service has been terrible.  In fact, service has gone from bad to worse.  Food is semi burnt and there is no desire on employees part to fix anything wrong.  They just throw and walk away.  Save your money and go somewhere else.  Rita's has great frozen CUSTARD.  This place doesn't even serve rich ice cream--the Dairy Queen vanilla soft serve is richer and more flavorful than the frozen milk they slowly try to serve here with poor results!"}
{"text":"After a long day of flying, we quickly checked into our hotel and took a taxi to the place we were thinking about all day.. Shake Shack!  No lines on a Wednesday night, we walked right in and ordered the following:

1. Shack Stack - Cheeseburger plus shroom burger in one!  One of the best parts of this burger is the crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted cheese, so good!
2. Chick'n Stack - The breaded fried chicken was perfect!  It was a good fried chicken burger, however, the shack stack still wins the gold.

We got cheese fries and regular fries with our burgers. Fries are good on their on - I don't think there was a need for the nacho cheese topping.  

So glad Shake Shack is on the west coast!!"}
{"text":"O__O Being born and raised in LA, I always thought In-n-Out was the best burger you can ever set your mouth on but I was so so wrong... Shake Shack is officially better than anything In-n-Out can offer, and now I don't mind ever moving to New York (if the opportunity ever arises). 

I ordered the Shroom Burger and it was so delightfully juicy and delicious! And their French fries are a thicker cut that is different from In-n-Out's and while I usually like thin fries, theirs weren't bad!

My bf and I talk about Shake Shack all the time when it comes to deciding what burger joint to go, so yeah. Go here!!"}
{"text":"Tasty as always. This location is busy, as expected on the strip. The cheese fries definitely his the spot. The burger was greasy, but delicious. The fifty-fifty (lemonade and iced tea) was a nice thirst quencher."}
{"text":"I have had Shake Shack in Philly, Las Vegas, and Santa Monica. Now here is Phoenix and I have never been disappointed. The burgers are the best burgers ever. Whenever I am near a shake shack I have to go. Although it is quite expensive for a family of four we end up paying at least $50...... this establishment is right in the heart of the outdoor mall. Which is very busy during the holidays. But the food came out fast and there was enough seating for everyone and they were showing football so my husband was happy."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but wasn't to crazy about the price or cheese sauce. I spent 30 dollars on a single shack burger,chicken sandwich one order of fries and two shakes. I guess that's the price for food on the strip or close to the strip.There was plenty of seating and staff was very helpful. The place was clean and the crowd was diverse. Overall I may not eat here again but the experience was good."}
{"text":"To keep it short sweet and to the point.
Burgers are small, very average.
Shakes are nothing special. 
Fries are average and over salted.
Overall for my girlfriend and I to eat it was 26.92$ for 2 burgers, 1 fry, 2 vanilla shakes. Its to overpriced for not nearly enough food quality or quantity."}
{"text":"I had heard alot of hype about the burgers here so we decided to finally try it out. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed.

First of all, the price is very steep. $29.00 for 2 single burger, 2 fries, 1 shake, and 1 large soda. Ouch. Thats almost 15 bucks a piece for fast food. Seems really pricey to me. 

The food was average at best. Burgers were OK but nothing special and not a lot of flavor. Fries were pretty good. My wife's chocolate shake tasted like powder and was really runny. My soda tasted flat.

Definitely not going back. Too many good burger joints out there with a lot better food and a lot less expensive."}
{"text":"High expectations from this place seeing that I am from the west coast. Smokeshack, cheese fries, and shack attack were all really good. Service was great, I almost fell victim to the cult-like following and bought a chocolate bar and onesie for a random baby. The only reason I am giving it four stars is because I wish the cheese fries has more cheese. I feel kind of picky for saying it, but there really wasn't much."}
{"text":"Decent. The burgers are sized like a slider. Milkshake is excellent. I prefer in and out burger!"}
{"text":"For all the Harry Potter foodies this one is for you...

I wish I could EXPECTO PATRONUM this place and protect all the Vegas visitors from this establishment because trust me there are better burger joints!"}
{"text":"Meh... I don't see what all the fuss is about. The burgers are good, not spectacular. The frozen custard was nothing to write home about. I had the \"shack attack\".  I much prefer in'n'out for both their burgers, and those delicious shakes. Better prices as well. But if you're on the strip, and craving a burger, Shake Shack will probably hit the spot."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place and was extremely disappointed. The patty was falling apart and was so greasy it soaked the buns. Even asked for one that was less greasy and got another the same way. Don't waste your money on the burgers, the shakes are good though. For a great burger try The Heart Attack Grill!"}
{"text":"So-so at best.  Okay burger, small for price and served pretty rare.  Odd that all three ketchup dispensers were empty.  I said something to the clerk and she responded \"sorry, we are working on that.\"  Seemed disorganized even with a lot of employees standing around.  Fries and shakes were good but again pricy for what you get."}
{"text":"For all the talk, it was underwhelming. Loud and having to practically yell to be heard. Service was quick. Lots of kids running around. I even tried the \"vegetarian\" 'shroom burger and it was deep-fried cheese with watered cardboard. Fries are pretty okay."}
{"text":"Such tasty burgers! I've gotten the shack burger & the shroom burger (vegetarian, but can add a patty for extra $$) and fries. Both are so delicious! I have no idea what they do, but it tastes like burgers on crack. Both times I went, I was super hungover from a night of clubbing, and STILL enjoyed it... I was shocked myself. 

The shack burger was so juicy and filled with flavor while the shroom burgre had cheese oozing out of it every bite, next time I definitely want to try their hotdogs and concretes.

The line ususally goes out the door, but moves pretty fast so don't walk away just yet!"}
{"text":"Bacon and cheddar burger fell apart easily, making eating a little messy.  The bacon and cheddar fries were tasty.   Root beer float needed more ice cream."}
{"text":"My California friends who have relocated to New York all swear by this place, and are all apparently highly defensive about it. It's almost like they feel like they have to convince themselves that they love this place so that it makes up for leaving all our amazing weather.

This location is outside the New York, New York in Vegas, facing the Strip. (I.e. don't walk inside the hotel, or you'll be lost trying to find it, because it's actually outside.) I can see this place resonating with people who don't have an appreciation for value, or people who want to tell other people that something they've haven't been able to try is awesome. In my experience, it's a really tiny burger with a big price tag and decent flavor.

I'm not a big eater by any stretch of the imagination, but I think that burger took me 6-7 bites to consume. That plus a drink was $10. I had finished my food before my roommate (who was in line behind me, and ordered the exact same thing) had even gotten his order. While the burger WAS decently tasty, it wasn't THAT much tastier than say, Carl's, where this meal would cost $7, and it would come with fries.

I didn't have room for a shake because I'd gotten a shake earlier in the day, and they were out of the signature flavor for the day. I'm not a big fan of crinkle-cut fries, and this place did nothing to change my mind. The ones drenched in cheese were even worse, as the cheese sauce adds very little in flavor.

Overpriced, overhyped, over it. The Father's Office burger is still the greatest burger out there."}
{"text":"Justin Y: In-N-Out is the undisputed champion of Burgers, F*ck Shake Shack.
Charton C: F*ck you, I tried Shake Shack once it's much better than In-N-Out, my favorite burger ever.

A lot of HYPE about this burger. The Shake Shack vs In-N-Out dispute went on for months and months, my head started to hurt.
I was under a lot of pressure to try it by these two in my recent trip to Vegas.

(you may be laughing right now, but too bad i'm serious)

Overall, I think In-N-Out makes a better burger
Shake Shack has crazy toppings to bring out more flavors and textures

In-N-Out just tastes fresh, it's TOTALLY California style with the fresh veggies and slim patties
At Shake Shack, the \"Shake Stack\" with the cheese-filled mushroom patty is so friggen amazingly good. I would eat the muenster cheese-oozing mushroom by itself.

In-N-Out double double with all my preferred fixings is $3.45
My Shake \"Stack\" was $9.49

In-N-Out has chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry milkshakes (simple.)
Shake Shack has frozen custard (heavenly), also tried the black & white, coffee (STRONG, they use Stumptown coffee).

At In-N-Out, potatoes are cut in front of your face, straight into the fryer. 
Shake Shack has crinkled fries (\"no preservatives\" but I'm guessing once frozen)

So in the end, it's really a fight between East vs West.  It's hard to compare the two because it's a great simple burger vs an ok burger with great toppings. 
All I can say is, get the Shake Stack instead of a regular burger.. that mushroom with the muenster cheese ooze was the best part of my Shake Shack experience"}
{"text":"I do not know what the hype is with this place. I got the shack burger and cheese fries. The burger was tiny and way overpriced. It was also tasteless. The cheese on the fries was also disgusting. At $15 a person you should really go somewhere else. This place is so freaking overrated!!"}
{"text":"I have been anticipating a juicy burger from here since they opened & finally got time to stop in, first of all this Shake Shack is very clean & orderly. The staff is friendly & helped with recommending a burger & shake, my order buzzer went off in 15 mins. My shake was salted Carmel was very good, the cheese fries with bacon bits were good, now about the burger what a mess !! it was falling apart before I could pick it up, the meat patty was something you would find at McDonalds and for almost $10 wow not impressed, I think this is a great place to have a shake & some cheesy fries but you can get a much better & cheaper burger at many other places...hint ..Zinburger, 5 Guys, probably won't be returning here anytime soon, maybe my expectations were too high ?"}
{"text":"Alles was das Burgerherz begehrt! Meine Empfehlung: smokedShake! Der Knaller mit Bacon! Man sitzt hier sehr gut und muss nicht lange warten bis der Pager blinkt und vibriert. Dann ist das Essen fertig. 
Ist das Getränk leer, zur Ausgabe gehen, refill. ;-)"}
{"text":"The crinkle cut fries were perfectly salted and not too soggy or too crispy. The burger was deliciously seasoned, but what puts them above in n out for me is their custard selection. They have different flavors of shakes and I can't get enough of their hard custards, which is practically ice cream. When I was there I tried their special shake for the week or month, the golden cake shake or something like that. It wasn't too sweet but still sweet enough tasting like cake batter. It was just the right finish to my burger and fries. I'm excited for them to open up their West Hollywood location!"}
{"text":"I've never been to a Shake Shack and after hiking, we treated ourselves. Prices are expensive here for what you get in comparison to competitors. They do have a lot of options. I got the protein style chicken sandwich, fries with cheese on the side (a good idea to get more cheese), and a small concrete with peanut butter sauce and truffle chocolate chip cookie dough. The chicken sandwich was pretty good - a good thick piece of chicken but it has a thick batter and it's very fried. (Still like Chick-Fil-A's better). The concrete, which is Shake Shack's version of a Blizzard, only had peanut butter sauce on top rather than incorporated throughout. What I LOVED though was their crinkle cut fries with cheese sauce, crispy and substantial. This is definitely a treat yo'self kind of place."}
{"text":"My favorite burgers!! Service was great!! I just love their burgers so much, tries their draft beer (exclusively for shake shack) so good !!"}
{"text":"Two words. 
Super Delicious!
But I have to write more otherwise this is just a tip. 
But honestly the review doesn't need more. If you want a great burger and a good shake. Look no further."}
{"text":"The debate of In N Out vs Shake shack. I'm not sure if my expectations were just high, or it really just didn't satisfy my tastebuds. Well, at least not the burger. I ordered the double shack burger, and it was not what I was hoping it would be. We also ordered the double down fries. 

The service was ok, employees didn't seem happy, the lady that took our order actually deleted my whole burger once I saw the receipt. This was due to me asking for no tomatoes, and she didn't realize she 86'd the whole burger. We also found a table but we had to wipe it off ourselves, even though there was an employee standing next to it just surveying the area. Looked around and there were actually 5 dirty tables around us. 


Starting off with the burger, it wasn't anything too special. The bun was just a potato bun which was too soft and soggy, the meat was very salty. It seemed like a burger you can get at any other restaurant that serves burgers. At least with In N Out, you can say that you can't really find that anywhere else. Especially due to the toasted bun. It was also quite greasy, and left me feeling bleh. 

But I give it the extra stars for the fries. The fries came loaded with cheese, bacon, and peppers. The fries had a nice crunch to it, and I actually really enjoyed them. 

So to end the debate in my own perspective, In n out over Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we didnt eat burgers here just ice cream and shakes.  The cashier was fun and had a great presence I regret not getting her name but we were there on Dec 27, 2017 around 4pm, if that helps.  Shakes were yummy and we had fun sitting outside watching the spray painter at the booth.  We will be back for burgers."}
{"text":"All the way down at the strip my New York New York . The lines can be a bit long coming here but they do move quite quickly . We always get the cheese fries here along with the basic burger is good enough for me . Highly recommend getting some bacon with the burger. Doesn't feel to heavy eating burger and fries here . Service is great just a bit of a hassle to head down there for a burger . I would come back and try the portobello burger next time . Over all good experience here ."}
{"text":"My friend Patrick was right for once. We normally don't have the same tastes when it comes to restaurants, but he was right on the money with his assessment on this one. He told me to walk in with an \"open mind\" though for him, it was, \"just OK\". Well, even with his encouragement, this place is another victim of the hype machine. I've seen numerous food shows covering the lines, the madness, and huge fanfare that covers Shake Shack's NYC location. 

So, you can only imagine how happy I was to find out that there was one in Las Vegas (not having to pay for a flight to NYC to try this out). 

To be fair, since I've had In N' Out and Five Guys, I ordered the following to compare:

Double Shack Burger; good, juicy patties, seasoned well, unfortunately someone had a heavy hand on the seasoning this night as the flavor kept going, as in, it turned out to be salty. Otherwise, it would've been a great burger, even though it is a bit on the small side (especially for the price tab)

Cheese fries; crinkle cut with a cheese sauce. My favorite part of the meal.

Fifty/Fifty; which was just right, even though it might be a premixed drink, it was fine.

Overall, it is worth trying and a good product, but I don't know if I would frequently go here especially for the price point and overall value."}
{"text":"This location made me a huge fan of shake shack! 

First I wasn't sure what to expect as the shake shack in London wasn't good.

This place was amazing! I did not want my burger to end and could have had another one. The customer service was on point and our server was very honest and helpful, which I appreciated!

I will come here every time I'm in Vegas now because of how great this location is!!"}
{"text":"First time here while visiting Arizona. I ordered the mushroom burger. It was smaller than what I expected, but good. Cheeses inside melted in my mouth.

Downside: Jon looked right over me to help the man in line behind me. I guess I wasn't the right skin tone for him?? Even when I walked to the counter, he did not greet me. I ordered my food and he stood looking at me as if I could read his mind. Because of him, I would NEVER come back. However, the gentleman who gave me my food and the young hostess were both very friendly."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try Shake Shack since I heard many good things about it so I made it our first stop while we were in Vegas. It was pretty good but I think I prefer In & Out instead. I thought the burger patties were too salty for my palate. My favorite was the strawberry milkshake! So creamy! It was perfect. I think it was a great compliment to my salty burger."}
{"text":"Visited Shake Shack for the first time.  I was very impressed with the quality of the food.  The food was good, not greasy like some other burger places.  I like that they have a little courtyard and a patio.  We sat on the patio and greatly enjoyed our lunch.  Great company with my co-workers.  This is the first time we had all visited Shake Shack and we all agreed it was good.  We will definitely visit for lunch again.  Customer service was great.   ~yummy"}
{"text":"Wonderful, I had a mushroom burger and hubby had a cheeseburger. I think this was the best meal and least expensive of the whole weekend while we were in Vegas. Chocolate shake was very flavorful and fries were descent. It was all very good. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Well i liked it alot i got the cheesefries with a single burger. A little small and tasted like any other burger but in the end its passable. Needs more sauce in my opinion but will come here again even though a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Ugh Horrible service! L was SO rude to us and irritated just by talking to us. This was our first time at SS and we won't be back. Our order was also wrong and I had a stomach ache after the bland chicken hotdog. I don't know what all the hype is!?! Don't waste your time especially at this one."}
{"text":"I like Shake Shack ! Lots of choices and yummy options for everyone. While I was there I ordered a portobello burger with fries, and mango lemonade. I had a really good first impression and enjoyed the total experience from service to the food. I can't wait till they open a location closer to home."}
{"text":"It's good but I wouldn't want to wait 15-20min for a burger.  I rather go to in and out or habit for something similar."}
{"text":"While in Vegas this is one of the spots you must go to! 

I got the burger with the mushroom in it. It was really good! Definitely seems like the best out of the options for burgers. I've had the SmokeStack before and didn't read about how spicy it was so that wasn't my cup of tea. 

I also had one of their custards. It was Labor Day so there was a special with peach pie mixed in and it was great . A friend of mine had the purple cow and it was an interesting mix haha. I personally wouldn't recommend it but he does!"}
{"text":"Sub standard burger, save your money and go to in and out. The bun was terrible. Fries were fair not hot. Strawberry Shake was ok. The apple pie shake was delicious. Service not friendly. Pickles were good."}
{"text":"Having heard so many good things about Shake Shack when I came across one I had to try it. Overall the burger was nice and the fries were good; I do love the Kringle cut fries. However for the price I was a little underwhelmed 

The good
The burger was delicious 
The bun was soft but didn't fall apart with the burger juice
The bucket of fries ,loaded were delicious 
Lots of parking but it is in the parking garage for the outlet
Even with it being lunch time on the weekend we got a seat and our food quickly
Bathrooms were clean a nice bonus for the road trip stop

The ok
The cheese on the loaded fries was just ok
The grilled cheese for the kids was small and expensive"}
{"text":"In a city like Phoenix, with such a powerhouse of a local food scene, its difficult for a chain from out of state to come in with the presence that Shake Shack did, so I'll give them that. The restaurant is beautiful and the service was very friendly.

We split the SmokeShack burger, a double, and the burger patties were so delicious with that smokey grilled goodness. A touch too much mayo.

I got a concrete. This is custard in a bowl mixed with various goodies. I built my own and got vanilla with cookie dough and fudge, they may as well add it to the menu because it's bomb.

Bryce got a vanilla shake. Good enough, I guess. They charge .50 for whipped cream. Seems a little criminal to me. 

Shake shack was a good stop for us, but we probably won't be back. There are too many better places that are local, and right in be same neighborhood."}
{"text":"First timer trying this burger and wow it doesn't look like much but the taste is phenomenal. It's just cool with so much flavor in the patty. The bun is perfect. I can't describe it, likes like slightly buttered and grilled and is soft to the bite. It works. The sauce they put in the burger is so good. It's like this creamy aioli sauce. It really ties the burger together. I got the the shake burger, it's not super huge and it's around $5 something. So it's not the most cheapest burger but not expensive as well, just wished it was a little bigger for the price. I could of ate two and I'm a small person. Give it a try!! Wonderful burger."}
{"text":"Almost close to perfect except the hot dog was abit overcooked. Love this place! Will definitely come back when I am in Vegas"}
{"text":"Honestly it has been awhile since I've been to a Shake Shack; I've been quite a few times to their location at the NY NY Hotel. I remember the food being very tasty but more so I never forget exceptional customer service which is something that drew me back to the NY NY location so many times. I moved to Lake Las Vegas, which made going to the strip quite a chore; so I've found The District & GVR which is a great alternative. I was thrilled to find out that Shake Shack opened a location at The District and decided to treat guests I have in town to some tasty burgers & fries in a more casual setting for lunch.

With four adults and a three year old we ended up ordering four different burgers, five fries,four fountain drinks, and luckily the employee taking our order informed us that they have a secret menu with grilled cheese for our picky three year old. 
$70 for five meals, I was a little shocked by the price. Okay, I remember the quality of the food being high, so I justified that $70 was worth it for four burger meals & a grilled cheese. 

The restaurant was clean and tables were ready for patrons which is always a good thing. We sat down at a booth with our pager, and about 10 minutes later our lunch was ready. I picked it up on a large tray for the food & a small tray for the four sodas. Handed out each persons meal at the table, and then came to the drinks & none of the tabs on the lids were punched. I took the tray of drinks back up to the counter and asked the female employee who expedited our meal which was which. She looked perplexed and looked at me and then at the cups and then asked the male employee who supposedly poured them. He looked equally as perplexed at first glance as he looked at the receipt and as a gentleman that I assume was the manager on duty was approaching the counter he said very matter of a fact \"those two are the Dr Peppers and those are the Cokes\". I wasn't so sure, and surely enough I take the drinks back to the table. Handed them out according to what I was told, and surely enough they weren't correct. Awesome, my guest who has a nasty cold drinks off my Diet Coke and my other guests who hardly know each other have now drank part of each other's soda. We switch sodas around, and I pray that I don't get a cold and that my guests who are nearly strangers don't mind swapping a little backwash. I unwrap my three year olds grilled cheese, it is literally two pieces of bread smashed together with some cheese between it; not at all appealing to the eye. Needless to say he was weary of this ugly thing sitting in front of him. As I coax him into it, he finally begins eating it & said it was \"yummy\". Whew, crisis adverted! 

Now it's my turn to finally eat, I unwrap my burger with a cheese stuffed mushroom stacked on top. First bite, cheese squirts everywhere. This wouldn't be an issue if there was a plate or even a wrapper, but seeing the burgers are wrapped in a piece of thin tissue paper it did nothing to protect my lap or the mess on the table. I have to use a stack of napkins to clean up my mess & my guests equally struggled with the messiness. Everyone said their food was delicious, and I agree with that evaluation. 
Fries were hot and burgers were fresh. So that was the redeeming factor. 

But all in all, it was annoying to me they didn't have a kids menu of some sort. Kids are a huge share of the restaurant market and I think it's a ploy to get more money. Given this alone, I wouldn't come here with kids again. Next the fact that they charge so much for a soda $4 I want to say is a little steep; Coke is cheap & the markup was very high on that. But given the fact they don't allow you to pour your own sodas or refill them I feel that's even more ridiculous to charge so much. Then the fact the person pouring the sodas cannot even take a second to punch the sodas as they are being poured really annoyed me leading to the fiasco at the table of everyone getting each other's drinks. And then the employee to panic and tell me so nonchalantly like \"duh it's not that hard\" and getting it wrong just further annoyed me. Pricing is too high, I appreciate fresh ingredients but I think there is definitely a huge markup. And lastly irritat d by the fact they don't provide you any type of vessel for your food minus the large tray (which how do you decide who gets to use it); minus a small piece of tissue paper & let's face it burgers are messy! 

Although my guests enjoyed the food (as did I), I did leave feeling dissatisfied by the experience. I felt like Shake Shack has cheapened their product & the experience by trying to cut costs on their end while charging patrons top dollar. It's a shame, because this isn't the Shake Shack I remember. I hope they'll reconsider some of these cost cutting decisions and adjust prices to be a little more affordable. I doubt it, but nonetheless I hope they'll make some sort of change for their sake."}
{"text":"Our first time to shake shack in Arizona. My brilliant wife and I have been in nyc and Boston but never in AZ. Came here on a Saturday when the outside enough was 115+ so the mall was packed and SS was paced as well. Quick ordering a nd we found a seat right away which was very lucky. 

Shake shack burger: standard not customer. Lettuce tomato mayo. I should have gotten it with what I like. Be sure to do that. It was kinda bland. 

Bacon cheddar: much better. The smoky bacon was very nice and this was a much better burger. 

Chicken shack: the best of the bunch. Not as good as chick-Fil-a but good in its own right. Piping hot. Crispy crust. Fresh tasting. Very good. 

Regular fries: sort of bland. Could have used more salt or seasoning. Good Potato flavor. 

Cheese fries: best of the 2 fries. The cheese was good on these fries and made up for the lack of salt on the plain. 

Salted Carmel shake with malt: wow really good. The malt came thru so well. I love that they have a small size. Just right for a desert after burgers and fries. 

Place was paved but clean. Service was 5/5. Food was 5/5. The food was 4/5 overall. I feel hopadady burgers is much better."}
{"text":"What a great experience. The service was very personable, Ceciley did a nice job. We had the burger, fries and 50/50 for lunch. It was delicious!  The store was clean and our family had a great lunch. We will for sure be back soon . Matt the manger visited our table twice to make sure everything was top notch and refilled our drinks!  Thanks again"}
{"text":"better than in-n-out.  a thicker patty with some special seasoning blended in.  because who can't do fresh produce, cheese, and a decent bun?  it's too bad this is the only one around here (and i live in l.a.)"}
{"text":"Small portions. Cold burger. Tiny shake. Generic fries. Iodized salt. (Sea salt has a fuller flavor)
Could you get any cheaper? 
We had the Shack Burger, with fries and a chocolate shake.
They premake the burgers, not made to order. The cheese and meat had been warm before, but were cold when we got them, seconds after ordering. It wasn't busy so there is no excuse for that.
The Shake was small, and tasted like too much Hershey's Chocolate syrup. Not my favorite, and dumping more than needed in made it taste gross.
For a \"Trendy\" looking place you'd hope to get a halfway decent meal. This was bland and uninspiring. I would go try somewhere else.
Blah."}
{"text":"Second time trying shake shack and their burgers are AMAZING. I got the mushroom burger and oh man, the moment I bit into it all the Juices from the patty and fried mushroom were leaking out. Very messy burger but definitely a 10/10 burger. One should always get fries when ordering a burger but I decided to amp it up a bit and get bacon cheese fries and I did not regret it whatsoever. The customer service here is excellent and always check up on you to see if everything is fine. Only reason I knocked off a star was because my burger that I ordered medium came out almost medium rare / raw. I'm not trying to get anthrax or anything but the servers took care of it."}
{"text":"We stayed at the NYNY hotel and walked past this place quite a bit before we decided to stop and try it. I had the Roadshack (I think) with fries. It was delicious. The burger was cooked perfectly and had really good flavor, the caramelized onions on top were also super delicious. We had a chocolate shake that was very good. It was chocolaty but not too sweet, like it was made with real chocolate. It was a little crowded i side but that's to be expected. Customer service was also oustanding!"}
{"text":"My family and I walked into Shake Shack for the first time last week and left a whole new person. I even bought a souvenir shirt on the way out with how committed I was after eating here--the hype's real. 

The  Service: Saturday lines are SUPER LONG but faster than you think! Friendly + Knowledgeable

Going through the line took 15-20 minutes. I forgot the name of the cashier that helped me, but I remember hearing her speak Japanese to the people before me. She was really nice and was patient with my family's large order. 

Shout out to one of the staff there named Edith for helping us out in the line by answering a lot of the questions we did have and coming to check on us when we ate! My dad used to manage restaurants and all I could hear was him comment on how efficient the staff was and how fast their food was coming out for how many people there were in the large dining room. By the time we finished eating, my mom wanted to order a couple more shroom burgers to take away. For some reason it took longer than it did before and when it came the food burgers felt colder. Before we said anything, Edith showed up! She had them remade and we had it in our hands under 5 minutes. We tried tipping her but she refused and said hospitality's always included. We were all so blown away! My parents are excited to see Shake Shack come to Portland soon! 

Food Quality: drive 4 hours, stand in line, and happily wait for food DELICIOUS 

Burgers to get: everything on the menu 
Burgers we can vouch for because we ate them: shroom, shake stack, chicken, smoke shack
-The shroom and Shake Stack are identical except the Shake Stack has the cheese patty. When you see that it says it has mushrooms, it's not like the mushroom you expect like on a pizza. It's a fried mushroom with melt in your mouth cheese inside. 
-The chicken shack was pretty good too! It has a small spicy kick, but it's a good balance between the lettuce and some sort of their own ranch looking sauce. 
-Smoke shack was the cheese burger with bacon and spicy pepper bits. It had their signature sauce, and it was beyond good. I wish the burgers were bigger given how good they are! 

Also you must try the Cookies & Cream shake alongside some cheese fries! 

Atmosphere: Loud + Exciting 
The dining room's modern and simple in design. Main focus points include the front of the kitchen, huge TV screen wall on the other side of the menu, and table seating everywhere. It's seat-yourself type dining so if you had a big party like we did beware wandering for tables may take a while. If you don't like crowds, I would order take out. 

Pricing: More expensive, but worth it

Among 5 people we ordered: 5 burgers, 1 chicken, 2 shakes, and 3 small soda drinks (which by the way, they give free refills on). We paid like $80 with tax."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Shake Shack, so I was excited to see what the hype was about. They offer burgers, shakes, chicken sandwiches, crinkle cut fries and concretes. They do offer gluten free bun and it tastes good! 

I waited about 5 minutes to order, but then waited for more than 15 minutes for my to go order. 

The burger was good, nothing exceptional. The fries were hot, crispy and delicious. 

Got a salted caramel shake and it's so yummy. I will say it's a bit pricey. I ordered fries, burger and shake and it was more than $15 total! Ah! 

Glad I tried it, but not sure I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Downtown Summerlin has been a bit lackluster with food options (all promise, with lack of delivery), so I'm happy to see this place open up and solidly perform both in quality of food and service. I went during their opening week and was glad that the line wasn't our the door long. Our wait time was expected after ordering (not too long though), but it did seem like a few other folks were wondering where their food orders were. Both the burgers we got were solid and the bun finally tastes like how I remember the bun tasting in their east coast locations (something about the NYNY location was a bit off). I know people complain about the higher price tag, but I'm officially a convert... no more In-n-Out for me. I'd rather pay up the extra money and go out of my way for my fast food needs. There are also a few TVs in this location, that were a lot easier to view than the NYNY location. When we were done with our food, a nice, very tall, young man proactively offered to put our tray away, which I appreciated. Some of the things I noticed:

Customers - geez,  clean up after yourselves a bit citizens of Summerlin! The workers do a great job bussing tables, but it kind of sucks seeing people really not give AF. 

Entrance - Not very wheelchair or stroller-friendly, and very tight. Summerlin parents, keep the lanes clear when ordering! (again, another complaint about the customers, but I think the business could do a bit more to ease the situation). The space itself is not as expansive as the NYNY location, and their is some but not a ton of outside seating, so you do feel a bit cramped when they are really busy. 

Restocking - the whole time while we were waiting for the food and eating, this employee took forever restocking the straws/napkins/condiments area and was in a ton of people's way. She definitely could have picked up the pace and finished doing that in 5 minutes or less. Get in, get out, and check on it again in 30 minutes. 

Hope this place thrives and more great places keep on coming to Downtown Summerlin!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the single patty at all.  Tasted like a fast food burger and it was small.  The fries tasted like they were cooked in oil that needed to be changed out.  I would've been just as happy eating a fast food burger and maybe happier because I would've paid less.  The lines were horrific at lunch time on a weekday.  We stood and waited around like vultures for a table then had people hovering and waiting around for us like vultures.  I wouldn't bother returning."}
{"text":"I've only heard stories of this place. I never expected to find one in Las Vegas, although I'm not surprise. I got their double Shackburger and it was AMAZING. Hands down the best burger I had.  Something about this doughy, greasy, yet simple and classic burger makes it so good.

The only downside was its so hard to find a place to sit down and eat. I will definitely crave this for the next year or so. Kudos to shakeshack for setting the standard for me. I'll never look at another burger the same way again."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd shake shack that has came to Las Vegas and so far my worst experience! People and kids running a muck - parents don't care what their kids are doing and the employees aren't doing anything about it. We also had to move because kids kept running into our seats because of the foosball table and shuffle board. Seriously. All I can say is WTF. 

The only reason I have this location 2 stars was because of the employees who came from the previous 2 shake shack locations. The employee who took our order looked like she could care less and didn't want to be here. There is no one walking around to check on you, like the other 2 locations have. 

On top of everything, apple maps, google maps and yelp do not give the correct location. We walk/drove around for close to 30 minutes looking for this location. 

I used to be the duchess at the shake shack in the NYNY casino for at least 6 months. 

On top of it, I just had freaking fooseball hit me because the kids don't care and are being reckless. The parents just laughed. DISCIPLINE YOUR KIDS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! 

I will never be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"This joint is da bomb!  The flavor up in here is amazing.  It's much more colorful than I was expecting in an awesome way!  Great food.  The service was spot on for the opening day.  One team member even hooked us up with a chocolate shake.    She was phenom and had lots of flavor Herself. Definitely had some shade thrown our way!  Had a blast.  Keep it real Shake Shack Kierland!"}
{"text":"YUMMM. I'm still craving it. I had the burger with the fried mushroom in it. It was so nice and crispy and light!"}
{"text":"Surprised it wasn't super crowded at prime lunch time.  Now I know why- this place has burgers that have poor quality meat and artificial cheese- go to In-N-Out if you want a decent burger."}
{"text":"Very attentive staff, great food! Our server noticed we didn't finish all of our food and was concerned. Long story short we got a free shake and gift card! Recommend ordering the food with a low salt option as meat tends to run a bit salty. Overall, great place with amazing staff and food."}
{"text":"Love This place and I'm glad they have one in phoenix. The taste is just as good as the one in New York. They also serve beer in draft which was a plus. Location is good and staff was really friendly"}
{"text":"I'm salavating as i write this. they have a create burger and fry. Wish they had a combo (unless i didnt see it). The shack burger comes with whatever you want on it, but you have to make sure to ask for lettuce, tomato and onion or it will be ommited. But even if you forget and you go up and ask they are really nice and will give you a side. 

The crinkle cut fries are always crisp to perfection, also they dont have crazy lines like a similar burger resturant intown. Overall, i highly reccomend this place if your in the area."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

It seems very fitting that NY-originated Shake Shack has come to Vegas and settled in New York New York. You can see the bright glittering sign and storefront right off of Las Vegas Blvd. You queue up outside, go through switchbacks inside, order, get a pager to know when your order is ready, and find your own seat either indoors or outdoors. I had the original when I was in NY, so I was eager for the bf to try it.

I got the same burger as last time -- a single size ShackBurger, which is just a cheeseburger, for $5.19. Bf tried ordering the hamburger, double size, but I think the server misheard and instead put down a double ShackBurger with bacon, which was $7.99 + $1.55 (for the bacon add-on). Due to the long line and the crowds of people, we didn't bother adjusting the order.

Food came in a reasonable amount of time. We scooped a booth table (score!) and waited probably 10ish minutes. Bf digged the food, especially the potato bun, which is apparently an East Coast thing. Bacon was nice and crisp, so we didn't feel completely gypped by the almost $2 cost for the add-on that we didn't really want. The burgers, however, were on the small size and the price was high for the size you receive. Our order of fries ($2.95) came hot and very crisp--love it! We also ordered the jackpot concrete. The description sounded good (vanilla custard, Belgian waffles, strawberry puree, marshmallow sauce, and rainbow sprinkles), but the presentation not so much. Not worth the $5. I'd say, stick with a shake.

Shack Shake is a nice addition to the list of Vegas eateries. It fits perfectly at New York New York. A quality, but pricy burger."}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly people.  Always fresh food!   Shakes are really great!!!"}
{"text":"Tika is amazing! I hope that's how you spell her name but regardless she is super awesome and single handedly made sure we were taken care of. Thank you! 

Shake Shack in Vegas is perfect, can't wait to see this place open up in the Bay. Just as good as the ones in NY, absolutely love it. 

5 stars + millions more for Tika!"}
{"text":"Good God!  That cheeseburger though.... Seriously, the cheapest & one of the best places we have eaten at in Vegas. I got the Shack-cago dog, which was also bomb."}
{"text":"It was only a matter of time that the Shake Shack empire moved westward. I find it a welcome addition to the New York New York hotel complex - it's a fast, affordable, delicious food option amongst the fancy options on The Strip. It's not buried away inside either, but with doors open prominently to the sidewalk and with lots of seating. Burgers and Chicago hot dogs just as good. For something specific to this location, check out their concrete creations. The jackpot was made with Mast Bros chocolate."}
{"text":"Loved this place since the first time I ate here! Eat here at least once a week.  Amazing burgers and shakes!!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure Shake Shack of all places doesn't need my review, but I am going to do it anyways!  In lieu of waiting in the insane lines for the Hollywood location, I waited patiently to have my first bite of shake Shack during our Las Vegas vacation.  I'm glad I did because, being on the strip and surrounded by hundreds of other dining destinations, we didn't have to wait in a crazy line. 

I chose the Double Shack Burger and cheese fries for my first Shack experience and I believe I chose right!  The burger was cooked perfectly and the flavors were really good.  I will say that the burger had a striking flavor resemblance to Wendy's though.  I'm not sure how to feel about that, but at the same time, I love Wendy's too!  With that said, fast food can never compare to the quality of burger that Shake Shack produced.  I still don't think I will battle the lines in Hollywood to get another burger, but it is my hope that they expand closer to my town so I can enjoy their food more often, without having to make a trip out of it."}
{"text":"I'm a burger and fries kinda girl so trying out Shake Shack was a no-brainer for me. I didn't go in with any sort of expectation however, I've heard nothing but praise about Shake Shack. 

I ordered a single Shackburger, fries, and a drink, which cost me almost $12. I have food allergies so I asked what was in their Shacksauce and was told that it was a \"secret\". What's funny about the whole thing, aside from them saying their recipe was a \"secret,\" is that there is clearly a sign on their registers that says to ask anyone on the staff about their ingredients, especially if you have food allergies. A quick Google search will give you the ingredients, so no need to ask ;)

The burger itself was good but overall, I just wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be. Their Shacksauce is good, but it didn't really add any necessary flavor to the burger. The fries were good but again nothing new. For the cost, might as well take a cab to In-n-Out just behind the Strip.

This location is appropriately inside New York New York and easily accessible from the Strip. We came on a Friday night and it was pretty packed. Despite my disappointment with the burger, I liked the space and that there was ample seating.

If you're into trying burger chains, I'd give Shake Shack a whirl but otherwise pass!"}
{"text":"Great F*%#ing Burger, a bit pricey, but tasty. Better burger than In n Out, but not better value."}
{"text":"Tiny portions and mediocre food. They are way too expensive for what you get. They charge about as much as Bad Daddy's but it's McDonald's quality. Also not happy with the fact that they don't have kids meals. Not into places where I have to pay $11 for my 4 year old to get a burger, fries and soda. The line was out the door and it was packed. But that's only because it's new and just opened. I don't see it staying that way, not with what they charge anyway."}
{"text":"Just \"okay\"...
Been dying to try the burgers here. Went to NYC last year & totally missed out. Figured I hit the jackpot (see what I did there...\"jackpot\"...Vegas)...
Anyway, when I had a chance at this one, I was excited. It wasn't bad, but a little over-hyped. Nothing special stood out. Order taker was unhelpful in recommending \"a good burger\". I thought I'd ask her since it was my first time and they had a few different ones to chose from. 
In-and-Out STILL reigns supreme (in this burger battle.)"}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place and finally had a chance in Vegas. It was next to the shopping mall, New York New York, on the strip. They opened till midnight so it was super convenient for shoppers like us. It was a very modern, clean and efficient place with lots of options. They sold not only food but also merchandise there. Since the first time, I asked staff's suggestion. I ordered a shack stack, chick'n stack, fries and root beer. My sister modified the Shack Stack with protein style so lettuce instead of buns. They would call your number when it's ready. The food came out pretty fast. I loved how they served Stumptown cold brew and beer to pair with your food. I didn't set up any expectations before we walked in. It was amazing delicious for a fast food chained restaurant. The combination of mushroom and cheese worked well and chicken was crispy and tender. I loved the crinkle fries which were crispy and crunchy without any salty or cheese. Compared to the other popular fast food chained restaurant in Los Angeles, I preferred this one. 

Only one day later, I already missed it. Hopefully I will see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Overrated. It's pretty good hangover food but that's about it. Would recommend the ice tea they have though"}
{"text":"Me and my family were walking the strip and decided to stop somewhere to grab a bite to eat. Friends who visited two weeks prior told us about the Shake Shack. I'm so glad they did! The burgers were absolutely delicious - fresh and flavorful.  Decided to have a chocolate shake. Great decision! I love it when you can actually taste the chocolate in a chocolate shake - rich flavor.  The only thing I didn't like is one and done on the fountain drinks - no free refills. Otherwise, very pleased with the decision to eat here."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is located in, or really just outside, the New York, New York Casino. Actually, on LV Blvd. you will find it right next to Tom's Urban.

Ordered:

- Shack Stack ($9.59)
- Cheese Fries ($3.99)
- Shackburger ($5.29)
- 2 Coke Zeros ($2.80 each)


(+) Burgers were tasty, if a bit on the small side
(+) service was friendly and fairly efficient
(+) I actually really dig their crinkle cut fries, either plain or with cheese
(+) as with most places on the strip, great people watching and scenery ;)

(-) strip prices, so prepare to cough up the moolahs
(-) no refills on the sodas
(-) bathrooms have 1 urinal and 1 stall. Not nearly enough for a place that does this kind of volume

Overall, this place was alright. I honestly can't see myself going out of my way to come back. They were okay, but did not live up to all the hype IMO.


3 stars."}
{"text":"I thought the burger was really greasy, the bun was very wilted. Ive had wayy better burgers. Id compare this burger to a fast food place."}
{"text":"New brownie batter shake lived up to expectation but tasted more like an easy bake batter from my kids toys. Orangesicle float was good, but melted fast. Heard a lot of good things about this place. Overall disapointed."}
{"text":"Good fast food.  The burger was good and there was more burger than extras (which is not the case anymore at In&Out.  The cheese fries with bacon are excellent.  They have a great crunch.  They have a good choice of food."}
{"text":"I have dined at this location about three times over the past few years and I have always left satisfied. I always get the Shack Burger single patty option with cheese fries on the side. The quality of their food is great ! 

The menu has a lot of different options. They have burgers, hot dogs, a chicken sandwich, fries, shakes and even alcohol. I mean I guess it wouldn't be Vegas without the alcoholic options lol. 

The staff is always very friendly and helpful even when it's super busy. 

The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because the wait does get very crazy during certain times. Also, because it gets so busy it's hard to find seating inside. There is outdoor seating as well and it is shaded with misters up above. These also get full pretty quickly. The parking will also cost you. We park at the New York New York hotel self parking and the first hour is free but after that they charge you. 

Overall I would definitely recommend this place because the food and staff is great regardless of the wait. Worth a try if you're ever in Vegas."}
{"text":"So I didn't get to try Shake Shack when I was in New York City and was bummed about that. Then I found out there is a Shake Shack in Las Vegas at the New York Hotel, right on the strip.

We ordered:

Shack Burger (cheeseburger topped w/ lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce)
-we asked for no sauce and added raw onion, best tasting burger I've had in awhile!!

'Shroom Burger (Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato, & ShackSauce)
-great for vegetarians, I took a bite of my sisters, very tasty, we also asked for sauce on the side.

Cheese Fries (fries topped w/ special blend of cheddar and american cheese sauce)
-Crispy fries w/ melted cheese, YUM!!! Get it!!

Jackpot (vanilla custard, belgian waffles , strawberry puree, marshmallow sauce, and rainbow sprinkles)
-Meh, it was not my fave. we took couple of bites and decided to toss it. 

FYI- Shake Shack will be opening in West Hollywood in 2016 :)"}
{"text":"This place was on my checklist of things to do/see/eat in Las Vegas. I had seen people post pictures on IG and I'm like we gotta hit it up when were in town.

We went on a Wednesday headed down to the New York, New York, Hotel and Casino, I was thinking it was attached to the inside of the casino, but it wasn't, you had to exit out onto the strip and enter from the front of Las Vegas Blvd, no biggie. 

I ordered the food for myself, boyfriend and niece and was a little shocked to her the cashier tell me $45 for our lunch, but when in Rome, or Las Vegas, you have to try it at least once, right??

I'm glad we did the burgers were nice and good not sloppy from all the toppings, the cheese fries were good and even though they were packed we still got in and out."}
{"text":"I'm very very particular about my burger reviews, specially the ones that are strongly hyped by my peers. I had a lot of expectations about this particular burger joint, and I'm surprised it was met to a tee. I ordered the burger with a giant fried mushroom inside (my apologies for forgetting the name) and that was safe to say, in my top 5 favorite burgers. And the cheese fries was also delicious. It's a long walk to get there but it's all worth it. I highly recommend this place to anyone who will visit Vegas soon!"}
{"text":"We josh had lunch in here reminds the the one in your York and similar to the one in mad hattm by new youth hotke delicious"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place and have been waiting for about 7 months to try it. I came during dinner and although it was packed, they serve rather quickly and there is plenty of room to sit. 
I ordered the bacon burger, bacon cheese fries, and the black and white shake...because it is shake shack and i need to try the shake. 
The burger was a little disappointing to me. It cost about $6 and it was kinda small with no lettuce or tomato. It was patty, cheese, bacon, and shack sauce. It was good, but it didn't taste gourmet. It was closer to a mcdonalds burger. 
The fries were awesome! They were crispy and the cheese and bacon made it even better! These were better than the In-n-Out fries. 
The shake was pretty good. I can see why they call themselves shake shack. It had the right amount of thickness so it wasn't a struggle sucking it out. 
Overall I thought this was worth a try. It is definitely uncommon here since its a East coast chain, so try it if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Closest thing to In&out...thin 1/4lbs parties...thousand island sauce...lots of cheap cheese...tastes very similar and fries are better.  HOWEVER...at literally twice the price!  $9 for that? Expected much more...rather go to red robin at that price."}
{"text":"Please train your order takers to listen well. We had to line up 3 times to get our orders right.. the order taker looked like she wasn't in the mood to work either! Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"This place owns up to the hype, fahshawtys! Do people say that?

Price: Look to spend probably $10/pp if everyone is getting their own burger. Don't expect to pay in-n-out value.

Food:
We ordered the ShackBurger and their  krinkle fries and it was so bomb. The burger was flavorful and the fries had just the right crunch

Service: Long line but it goes fast.

Overall, I've heard so much comparison between shake shack and in-n-out but I don't think they are comparable in that in-n-out is more fasfood-ish than shake shack and therefore, you're paying a lot less. In terms of comparison of deliciousness between the burger and fries between both, I can't decide! I probably have to try shake shack again."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place.  Although it's true that the burgers are too small, they really are de-lish ! Seasoned perfectly and on a soft but not mushy bun...these burgers hit the spot. I see some people complaining about the price but maybe they were ordering the double burger.  I don't get the whole infatuation with the cheese fries tho which were around $4.  To me, the plain fries are pretty much perfect by themselves and a good sized portion.     Very friendly staff & a clean, roomy restaurant and a little more upscale than a typical fast food place.  The music is a little loud but maybe  the young people dig that.  Definitely recommend !     I went again on Jan 14 to try the new chicken sandwich. It's pretty good - seems to be deep fried, kinda on the heavy side... I'm guessing the calorie count is pretty high. Still love this place"}
{"text":"They close at 10pm. We arrived at 9:45pm and they were virtually all shut down. When we asked if they were still open the staff looked at each other as if they were unsure what to do. Finally a young women stepped up to the cash register and was obviously annoyed that we were there. Hey had already thrown out the iced tea and the cheeses sauce so two items I wanted were not available. You know, if the cashier woman hadn't of acted annoyed that we were there I would have left another star. The food was good and the quality was good. The management just needs to make their staff understand that if your open until a certain time, they shouldn't start shutting down the kitchen until then. Ironically after we arrived, two or 3 more parties came in after us."}
{"text":"Our first time trying Shake Shack and it was a deliciously pleasant experience. We opted to dine out on the dog friendly patio, and though it was quite busy, ordering and receiving our food was reasonably timed.

We opted for the original single and original double burger with an order of regular and BBQ bacon fries, a vanilla custard and a salted caramel toffee shake. Everything was superb and that toffee shake was something that won't be forgotten and will be craved in the months that follow!"}
{"text":"Loved Monique!!  Best cashier EVER, I miss enthusiastic customer service that wants customers to purchase the product..."}
{"text":"I was in line for grand opening day an hour before doors opened at 11am. I was at the register at 11:45am! Not a bad wait with around 100 people in front of me. Quick turn around. After ordering, the food was ready after 5 minutes of waiting. They were greatly staffed and energetic, I was impressed! The restaurant was very chill calm, organized and not hectic even with a large customer audience. Burgers were just as flavorful and juicy as their other Shake Shack's I've been to in Manhattan. I went with a single shack burger, fries, and a shark attack concrete. It was all awesome. Great service. Great food."}
{"text":"This place got the best customer service ever. A server mistakenly charged my order for 3x prices of cheese fries, but I only ordered one. A very kind guy that served me meals said I can have all of em and still refund my money. Awesome place. Definetely will return again soon."}
{"text":"First, you have to ask for veggies? Okay, even if you have to ask, I feel like they could make it more clear that you have to ask. 

I don't give many three star reviews. It's not necessarily cuz it's a three star place, but this place is overhyped and overpriced. It's a good burger, but you can find a burger this good for cheaper. Honestly a bacon burger at Sonics with hatch green chiles is a pretty good approximation to their spicy bacon thingy here. That goes for the shakes as well. We shared the fancy fries too. They were good. Just good. There are dozens of places in Vegas that have some sort of signature stacked fries that are just as good if not better (and cheaper). 

In conclusion, there are a lot of poke stops nearby. So maybe follow those poke stops to somewhere that gives you more bang for your buck. If your bag gets full, discard some stuff, you're not in enough gym battles to need that many potions and revives. Shake shack, a three-and-a-half at best."}
{"text":"Got the Smoke Shack - an amazing burger. Very flavorful. Great lunch spot and cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to Shake Shack this past weekend and all weekend that's all I was thinking about.  I was worried that this was going to be one of those moments where you hype something up so much, it's a complete let down after you try it.  So...was it a let down? HELL NO!!! One word...\"WOW!!!\"  The food was amazing.  I went in full \"Fata$$\" mode.  I had a Shack Stack (Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce), a ShackMeister Dog (a hotdog topped with Shack cheddar and American cheese sauce and crispy ShackMeister Ale-marinated shallots), and Cheese Fries (fries topped with our special blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce).  I also had a peanut-butter and banana shake which I wasn't a big fan of.  Let's get back to the food....it was amazing and everything lived up to the hype.  To make this experience even better, the service was outstanding.  Every person was attentive and they were extremely courteous.  I'm a resident of SoCal and love my In n' out, but Shake Shack is better in my opinion.  I will 100% be back when I'm in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. When Shake Shack opened in Vegas I was so excited because the one in NYC is a staple of fast food in that area. It tasted similar to NYC if not the same, and I enjoyed every bite. 

I admit it - I am a sucker for some good crinkle cut fries, and the ones at Shake Shack do not disappoint! Perfectly salted and fried to a crisp, but not too much so they're overly greasy. However, I did have their special fries earlier this month with cheese sauce and bacon and they were painfully salty. I was definitely puffy from all the salt for a few days. 

Their shakes? Amazing. Simply amazing. All of them are fabulous. Grab one and then go across the street to the AC Store for a mini of Bailey's or a delicious dessert vodka to make it extra happy. 

It doesn't matter which burger we get, each of them are delicious. My husband likes the Shake Shack with the fried mushroom or whatever it is and he is in Heaven each time he gets it. 

I get the hamburger or cheeseburger either wrapped in lettuce or on their gluten free bun. Let me tell you something. They have the most delicious, squishy, buttery gluten free bun I've ever had. Their buns make me remember why I missed bread so much when my gluten allergy was at its worst over a decade ago. Perfect meat to bun ratio, and a delicious bite each time. 

For the price, it is great. We always take friends there when they're in town. Great location too! Friendly staff, good food, and good times!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing so much hype about Shake Shack for well over a year from the time that they announced that they were coming to the Phoenix metro area until I finally had the stars align correctly so that I can try this place. 

I had a Shack Burger and a Shack Shake for $11.49. After all, I had to try their signature items to write a proper Yelp review. I thought the seating was awkward since there were many tables lined up together along with over sized booths but little consideration for couples or single diners. The sun setting in the West is blazing into the restaurant during the dinner hours. How about some screen to block those rays? Or at least sell some sunscreen to the tourists and first timers.

Okay, I know some people might not enjoy my rant about the setup so I'll move on to the food part. The burger was mediocre or pedestrian at best. IMO, Smashburger and In-N-Out Burger are superior alternatives as far as taste and price point. The shake was just okay for me but really fell short of expectations.

So in summary, Shake Shack over promised and under delivered in my opinion."}
{"text":"I was there last week on my Vegas trip

great, great oatmeal pie milk shake (one of the best shakes I ever had)

good staff, friendly"}
{"text":"I was in the Downtown Summerlin area so I decided to give this place a try...I heard about Shake Shack burgers so I thought this would be a good opportunity to try it. I ordered just a regular hamburger and an order of crinkle fries. It was tasty, but as other Yelpers said a smaller sized burger. My wife went back to get a frozen custard-Desert Crunch-stellation...it was decadent!

Great menu selection & a wall size menu posted on the wall making it easy to read...very spacious & clean dining area with TV's. Attentive service with employees checking up on you & picking up your trash."}
{"text":"My Life hasn't been the same ever since.
I fell in love with their vegetarian burger. 

The 'Shroom Burger'. 

Ever have oozing cheese come out of your burger bite after bite? It's pretty ridiculous.
An amazingly huge and crispy-fried portobello mushroom filled with unbelievably addicting muenster and cheddar cheese. All melted to perfection with tomato and their Shack sauce. It's entirety is crack I tell you, WITH A LASTING IMPRESSION. I had no idea what I was getting into.
And compared to In-N-Out, I would much prefer Shake Shack over any burger place at this point. We stayed at Hotel32, so happily took advantage of how close it was. We found ourselves taking fieldtrips from the penthouse to Shake Shack all too often. Also, I really like that they have a huge dessert menu and serve beer and wine. 

AH-Mazzing!

Looking forward to our next Vegas trip this weekend!!"}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype and worth the wait in line!! I had the smoke shack burger with cheese fries and loved both. The smoke shack burger has bacon and diced cherry peppers on it. Legit!! The fries are great and the cheese sauce blend hits ever corner of your tastebuds!! I would slap your momma for this meal right now!! Yeah, you could say I'm officially a fan."}
{"text":"I got a shack burger (literally the most basic burger) a chocolate PB shake and a beer.... 

IT WAS $20!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I DIDN'T EVEN GET FRIES!!!!!"}
{"text":"So I have to say I'm a shake shack shanatic!!! Every bite was glorious and so delicious!! Best part is that they got my burger just how I like it!! Forget in n out!!! There's a new burger joint to my heart!! I love ice cream but the custard they have there is out of this world! Maybe even universe! I don't know how I could go back to ice cream knowing that the shake shack is right around the corner! Thanks for being her shake shack!! You win!!! You totally win!!"}
{"text":"Had a shack stack which was a good burger(I'd give it an 7 out of 10) besides the fried mushroom there is nothing special about it. It's on a plain bun with simple sauce. 

We also got the double down fries which can easily feed about 2-3 people. Beware the peppers are a lot spicier than I first imagined and I wasn't a Big fan of the shack cheese sauce it tasted like watered down valveetta cheese to me. 

Lastly, the reason I gave this place the benefit of 3 stars is because of the jackpot concrete. By far the best I've had in a long time!!! The custard was perfect in taste and texture and he Belgian waffle pieces they put inside were still warm on the inside even after I had mixed everything together. It was the highlight of my dinner"}
{"text":"Fun Place... Great burgers. We were six in our group that had the smoke shack which is awesome. Nina Ranch bacon just rocks... One person got the hot dog which they loved. Great ambiance. Great shakes, wine and beer. I know there are people on these reviews saying its expensive etc. etc. For the quality you get, its right on the mark.... Their burgers are much better than In-N-Out. Don't get me wrong I love In-N-Out but this is absolutely 2-5 steps above. Will go back for sure...."}
{"text":"Delicious. I don't care how greasy it was. The line seemed long but moved fairly quickly and the order was processed quickly."}
{"text":"Service was lacking as you should be smiling while your working. Even if you are having a bad day you have to try and shake that off and get lost in the world of work. Some people just have off day and I am not going to fault them for lack of service as I'm sure they where training to and know how difficult that can be. The food was awsome. Fresh, big portions, little spendy and did take little bit of time to get our food but it's vegas so just people watch while your waiting. Thanks for the great burger and fries."}
{"text":"One thing I miss about living on the east coast is the great burger and shakes at Shake Shack. My favorite things about this place: awesome beer selection, chocolate concretes, and that potato bun. Yum!

The Las Vegas restaurant is so much more organized that any other Shake Shack that I've been to. You walk in and there is a line but the great part is that while you are in line you get to look at the wall of a menu (not exaggerating it's legit a wall and its great). Despite the very clear menu, there is also a team member there to answer any questions and direct you to the next available cash register (I want that job). Despite it being crowded every time I have been the food comes out relatively fast and I am always able to find a spot. The only annoying thing is that you have to access the restaurant through the strip and can't go through the New York New York hotel. However, there is one hour free parking at the hotel which was super convenient when I drove through Vegas and saved me $$$."}
{"text":"I have yet to have anything bad at this place! Though lines can get long but it shows how good their food is! I find myself having cravings for a good burger, cheese fries and a shake often so this has become our go to place. I love the smoke shack burger with bacon and red peppers. Every bite is worth it! The cheese fries are delicious and always a must. I love the red velvet and s'mores dessert. Definitely a place that you can keep coming back to and not get tired of it!"}
{"text":"First time at Shake Shack. Got the Smoke Shack and cheese fries. Prices are a little high for me but I compare all burgers to in-n-out - very rarely does a $7-10 burger beat a $3.75 Double Double IMO.

Server was not awesome. Not friendly. Bran new joint never asked if I been here or not. Nothing. Never said hi even. 

So, with that said, I found it pricey. Single burger with BBQ and bacon is $7. It was alright but nothing great. Meat seemed undercooked to me. Inexcusable for a burger shack. Bun was good but chewy. Bacon very tasty. 

The cheese fries are good but severely lacking in amount of cheese making them bad. I like crinkle cut fries, many don't. Like my potato to actually have potato in it so I like the fries here. 

Overall - probably won't be back. One and done. Don't see the point. Should of stayed in NY where they love you evidently - guess they never had in-n-out burger."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to checking out Shake Shack for a while now and finally got around to it today. Took a break from the slots to see if this place lived up to all the hype. First, the burger. Had the BBQ bacon double burger and thought it was pretty good. Burger was juicy and cooked well but it wasn't AMAZING. What was pretty darn good were the shakes and custard. Peanut butter shake was nice and smooth and my son was very happy with the chocolate chip shake. My wife ordered the burger with portobello mushroom and that was quite tasty. She also had the frozen custard with the bits of pie which she enjoyed. The crinkle cut fries were excellent. 

Our cashier that took the order was extremely friendly and polite. When he saw me waiting by the end of the counter, he went out of his way to bring me a cup for water. He told us where the cups were but I just didn't get around to picking one up yet as I was waiting for our remote to buzz and notify us our order was ready. Just that extra thoughtfulness impressed me and tells me this location chooses its staff carefully and they care about the customers. I didn't catch his name but you folks left a very positive impression and would recommend your restaurant without hesitation. Thanks Shake Shake for a satisfying first visit."}
{"text":"I don't think I would have gone here if it wasn't for my friend. We had just gotten into Vegas and she kept talking about shake shack the whole car ride. Burgers are just meh to me but I have to admit the burger wasn't too bad here. I ordered the smokehouse I think? I'm not sure but it was pretty good. I get sick of burgers fairly quick so half way through the meal I gave up. Definitely a first and a last for me. It's good just not something I'd crave for whenever I'm in Vegas. There's tons of other places I rather eat. Plus the wait for the burgers were really long. If I'm getting a burger I'd expect it to come out quicker. If wasn't like I ordered a steak or anything."}
{"text":"Burger was good wait time is a little long but burger was tasty wife thinks in and out burger is better"}
{"text":"We went last night for the first time.
Burgers were really good!! The best $10 burger on the strip? Maybe, maybe just really close. Not sure yet, might take another visit. :-P

They were totally packed, and still moved like a well oiled burger machine! 
They have it down! We moved through the line quickly, our pager went off, and had food on the table promptly as well. Over all it was quite smooth.

It is loud, and kinda of a scene, if you like that. Has an AWESOME outdoor seating area, that when it is warmer will be THE place to sit and grab a burger, no doubt!

Would happily go back!"}
{"text":"Yeah, this place was pretty good.  I got the bacon burger with fried onions, whatever they call it?  The meat seemed top quality.  It reminded me of Smash Burger, but a little better.  The patty was thicker, and more tender than Smash.  It was a a bit more expensive at $8 than Smash.  I didn't try anything else.

I would probably go again, but it is still hard to compare to the cheap yet very good In-N-Out double cheese burger ($3.5), or the expensive ($11 lunch special) super awesome, highest quality \"Perfect\" burger at Bobby Q's.  

It fits the bill somewhere in between.  I think it would be 5 star if it were priced closer to $6 mark."}
{"text":"I am so so so happy that Ohio finally got a Shake Shack! I now have more than 5G and BF to choose from. 

Phenomenal & quick customer service (don't let the line intimidate you-- it goes fast!). Food comes out just as fast as the line. 

I *do* think SS is a little over priced (burgers are the same size as a steak and shake burger) BUT the food is top notch in quality and taste, and their fries are out of this world, so you quickly forget that it's over $50 for 3 burgers, 3 fries, and 2 beers. Lol"}
{"text":"Spicy chicken burger was delicious! Somewhat small considering the price. However, it's free range and antibiotic free! So ideal to me when eating any meat. Tried regular fries on the side, they're decent. And a root beer float to top it off! Realized I've been spoiled growing up with A&W root beer floats and making my own at home. If I went back I would ask for more ice cream in it for sure! But that's just me and the ratio I like."}
{"text":"Okies tons of review about this place... Yes, finally tried Shake Shack for the first time... everyone raving about it and telling me it's so gooood... Well my thoughts on it, I ordered the Stack Shack, Jackpot, and their fries with cheese on the side.  Overall $20 meal for lunch.  Yes the taste is fairly good, presentation is there, flavor and textures are there... But I will not compare to other places since other places has different types of burgers and toppings.  Overall I will come back again.. and try other burgers and shakes.  :)"}
{"text":"Burger Battle Royale... with Cheese.

I love In-n-Out and now I love Shake Shack too! Aww! It's like the Biggie & Tupac battle, except I don't think this will end in blood shed. 

Came here for a Social Media meet up which also happened to be my first time at Shake Shack, ever, and what I noticed right off the bat was the layout. This place looks nothing like a fast food restaurant, much more modern and clean, which is surprising for a place right on the Strip. SS offers a lot of space to sit inside and two different outdoor seating areas, fully equipped with misters for those brain burning one hundred plus degree Vegas days. 

We ordered a ton food, Shack Burgers, Shack Stacks, Cheese fries, Shack-Cago dogs, and a Few Concretes. First off, Shake Shack kills it on presentation alone. The food looks amazing and is stacked with bright and colorful veggies, the perfect sear on the patty, and lots of Shack Sauce. Gotta have Shack Sauce. 

The Shack Burger is the perfect American cheeseburger. A thick patty, SS sauce and cheese. Cooked perfect and the buns are not only delicious carby pillows, but also connected on one end to avoid any filling from sliding out the back. Perfect burger for the SS skeptic. 

The Shack Stack is the same burger, but with a fried Portobello mushroom inside that's stuffed with cheese. This was my favorite of the entire meal, the mushroom was perfectly cooked and the fry coating on it was amazing. 

The Shack-Cago dog was very good, but fell apart as you ate it. Still the flavor was there, pickles, onions, tomato, sauce, and the bun. Great alternate meal option if you're feeling a burger at the moment. 

The cheese fries were okay, and I didn't try the concrete. I'm just not into sweets. 

In-n-out or Shake Shack? The burger at Shake Shack is better, by far, but In-n-Out has the fry game on lock. In my mind, this is a straight burger tie. 

I guess I'll just have to eat at each place again and keeping trying to break that tie. Oh the perils of Yelp life."}
{"text":"Shakes were... okay, so I went to Shake Shack and didn't try a shake, but their burgers and fries were worth it! Especially the fries. Notice that their crinkles were deeper, so the fries were extra crispy. And you can get cheese fries as well. The burger had a good beefy flavor with a nice dark crust to it, with lettuce, tomatoes, and melty cheese. Yup. Not a big burger, but so satisfying all around. Tried their hotdog but it was just okay... nothing to go nuts over. Had some frozen custard that they call the \"Concrete,\" which was not bad too.

Located at the base of New York New York, and usually busy, Shake Shack gets a thumbs up from me! Great burgers, great fries, and probably good shakes too, lol!"}
{"text":"Not my first experience at Shake Shack, but for the first Shake Shack in Ohio, it brought back so many tasty memories!

You can't go wrong with the double ShackBurger, Fries, and Raspberry Ginger Lemonade! I contemplated to skip the fries, but I am so happy I made the choice to order them! The raspberry ginger lemonade was the perfect summer drink to wash down all this great food. 

Come check out Shake Shack at Pinecrest!"}
{"text":"I don't usually like burgers but the Shack Burger is real good. I personally think it's because they took the extra effort to fry the insides of the bun with butter. And the vanilla custard is heavenly, with creamy and smooth texture, not too sweet, not too much of vanilla essence taste. Surprisingly good for a fast food store. A quick meal under $10."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good burgers and fries! Mine came with beef patty, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and bacon. The bread was like Hawaiian buns! The fries are wavy like cafeteria style but much tastier and crispy! Overall, great experience! I would return again!! Great seating inside and outside. Arnold palmer drink was good too! 5 burgers, 3 fries, 4 drinks = $45! Kind of pricy for burgers..."}
{"text":"Ughhhhhhh all I have to say is: shake stack. THEEEEE BOMBEST burger I have ever had in my life. If you love mushrooms this will rock ur sox off! Suhhh good I could literally eat this everyday and I'm not even joking. Try it and you will not complain. The cheese is so messy, you'll fall in love. 

If you eat alot like me get a side of fries, their burgers are smaller in my opinion."}
{"text":"Soooo good! I went with my friends and they're having a deal of buy one burger, get one free Mom-Thurs until July for students! Definitely going to be coming back! We all got the shackstack and I would definitely recommend this burger. The lemonade is also very good but the half lemonade/half iced tea is alright; nothing too spectacular. The service is very welcoming and the tables are always clean. :)"}
{"text":"Burger patty had inconsistent flavor.  Seemed like part of the patty got seasoning and the other part no seasoning.  Bun was really fresh so were the veggies (lettuce, tomato).  Crinkle cut fries could have been a bit more crunchy.  It was real busy so I guess the high volume lowered the quality."}
{"text":"Before trying Shake Shack you need to understand the concept behind it. You are getting a steakhouse quality burger that is made in a fast food setting. You are paying extra for non-hormone, GMO great Angus beef made with fresh ingredients. This made to order concept can take a little extra time but if you are patient and appreciate the care and time they take to serve you, you won't be disappointed. This is by far my favorite burger made by a national chain and I'm thrilled to see it come to the CLE!!! Note: this review is for the burger only."}
{"text":"Very Good! Must checkout ther other things on their menu, but was very pleased with what I had!"}
{"text":"I honestly can't remember the last time I had something from Shake Shack... It had to have been over 8 years ago when I lived in NYC... and the only thing memorable was the long ass line I had to wait on to get my food.

So when I saw that there was one that opened up in Vegas, I was pretty stoked.  I told my boyfriend that we'll go after a few weeks, for them to work out any kinks they may have in the beginning.  

So we went the other day (a month after opening).  It's located outside of the New York New York Casino and the entrance is outside so you have to exit the casino to get to it.  We were greeted by someone who gave us a menu to look at while we waited on line to order.  Although the line was long, it moved pretty quickly.

I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, no bun, cheese fries, single chocolate concrete with strawberry puree and my boyfriend ordered a chocolate milkshake.  We easily got a table and waited for our food.  It came out within 7 minutes and I was ready to dig in.

I was extremely surprised at how non-greasy the burger was.  I had it wrapped in lettuce and usually it gets quite messy but not the Shake Shack burger!  I was really impressed with their Angus meat blend!

So onto the fries... the cheese blend is their own blend and the color looks a little off because it's a little whiteish in certain areas.  But let me tell you, it is a great blend and the fries were nice and crisp!  I usually don't like crinkle cut fries but I will eat SS's any day!  I mean, I couldn't believe how each one was so crispy and I usually don't like crispy fries.  I'm still daydreaming of their fries till this day!

The concrete melted a bit since I didn't want to stand in line again and order dessert after I finished my meal so I had ordered it with the meal... it was pretty good but not something I've been craving... (like the fries)

My boyfriend said his milkshake was very good and he would go back for it.  

There's also a couple of employees that goes around cleaning tables, making sure everyone is happy and has everything they need.  

Man, I still can't believe that burger hardly had any grease!  I am just blown away!  haha

Going to make another trip soon... need to get my fries craving fixed!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place but it's not going to happen. The first time I tried them was in Miami and loved their 100% Angus beef patty. So I was ecstatic to try this East Coast burger joint in Phoenix.  Greeted by their friendly staff I placed my order and waited for the buzzer to alert me. When my order was ready, the bun was smashed and the patty was flappy, thin.  I also ordered the cheese fries which were good but cheese seemed cold.  Just really disappointed."}
{"text":"Two-stars feels like a knee jerk reaction of what I interpreted as an average burger that was preceded by unreasonable hype, but when I see how yelp defines 2 stars, \"Meh.  I've experienced better.\" I think that accurately describes the experience.

Food - 2.5/5 - If anyone has ever seen that burger king whopper jr. bullying video, I can say that my shack burger looked like it was bullied in the back kitchen.  The bun was flattened and didn't really fill out the wrapper it was put in.  The patty was decently seasoned and enjoyable.  However, when comparing to similar quality burgers, it did not stand out.

Value - 2/5 - These things are damn expensive.  Family of 4 in front of me walked away with a $60 tab.  

TL;DR - If someone asked me if I wanted to go to shake shack with them I'd say \"Fine\".  If someone asked \"Hey, where should I go grab a burger?  I would not say Shake Shack."}
{"text":"The food was OK but the service was terrible.  I was expecting better."}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab food on the strip! Located by New York New York, this restaurant was a go-to at all hours, and is the perfect hangover cure. Service is usually quite fast and there is always ample seating. I highly recommend a strawberry or vanilla shake to go with your food! Grab a seat outside on the patio at night and see the beautiful stars on the strip along with the fountains and lit up trees."}
{"text":"I don't even like burgers and I am a huge fan of Shake Shack!  I was transported back to NYC once we got here.  The food is equally good but the service was a lot slower.  

My favorite is always the Shroom Burger but if I truly must eat a burger, the Shack Stack hits the spot!  Can't forget fries, and if you're feeling full on gluttony:  cheese fries.  

Can't wait for Shake Shack to open in LA!!"}
{"text":"I can't shake Shake Shack off my mind if I'm in Las Vegas. I MUST have their burgers when I visit! Shake Shack was on my must-go places while on vacation. Forget In-N-Out, this place is x100 better! 

The restaurant is located outside of the New York New York Hotel and right across the street from M&M World. 

At Shake Shack you have to get a shake AND/OR frozen custard! They had chocolate, vanilla, cookies and cream and peanut butter to name a few.

There are about five different burgers to choose from and two sizes. Small or double. I decided to get the Shack Stack which was a cheeseburger and a deep fried Portabella mushroom. Yum! Of course there's the traditional cheese burger too. If beef isn't your thing, they do have a mushroom burger.
Each burger comes with lettuce and tomatoes. 

If you're not feeling a burger, they do have hot dogs and fries as well. Check out their cheese and bacon fries!! It's real cheese, not the fake stuff from the can.

The restaurant was fairly busy but service was fast and there were a bunch of paces to sit down. I was also surprised how fast our burgers were made. There was a switch-up, so be sure to check your order. 

If you're ever in town or in the area, forget McDonalds and head over to Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack as much I love In-n-Out. Whoever says you can compare, you cannot. Shake Shack is like gourmet burgers, and In-n-Out is good fast food burgers. Totally not comparable. At Shake Shack I generally get the SHACK BURGER which is a cheeseburger w/ lettuce, tomato, and their shack sauce. They have CRINKLE FRIES!!! It's my absolute favorite, and you have to get it with CHEESE!!! If I had to eat burgers and fries, these are definitely the pick!

For your vegetarians the SHROOM BURGER is really great as well. Imagine the shack burger but with a portobello mushroom! :) 

ENJOY!"}
{"text":"On our first visit here, we overall enjoyed it. I certainly wasn't expecting $19 for a double bacon cheese burger, loaded fries, & a lemonade, but the quality of the meat, freshness, and ambiance were exceptional for a burger spot. All in all we paid $51 for 3 burgers, fries and drinks. Holy crap  talk about sticker shock...the burgers were standard sized, at best... to get full, you'd want to buy 2, per my husband. 

As a splurge I'd consider returning because I'm a sucker for exceptionally made burgers, but the price is a deterrent from me going on a regular basis. Bonus; they sell wine and beer also. Too bad I'm breastfeeding and not drinking right now."}
{"text":"Second time here and it gets better and better with each menu item I try. I wanted to give the Chicken Shack a try. It was  hands down the best chicken burger. Crispy and well cooked. Had to pair it with the cheese fries. Even though the location is on the strip it still has the local vibe and great customer service."}
{"text":"The restaurant and service were great I just did not love the food. The burger was just average. My strawberry lemonade had a weird after taste, I think it also had basil in it which I didn't like. The shake was chalky and too rich for my taste and the fries were very dry and crispy. Glad I was able to try this restaurant but won't be back."}
{"text":"Shake Shack, the highest end corporate fastfood burger.  Pricey but awesome.  Go with the shack stack.  It's a munster cheese stuffed portabella mushroom, deep fried, on top of a cheeseburger.  This is their best item.  The fries here are of the crinkle cur variety you might find at your local grocery store, not their strong point.  Summary, if you want $20 a pop high end fast food, this is your destination."}
{"text":"We were so excited to find a Shake Shack since they are not available on the west coast.  This place is fairly large and situated in a new courtyard area outside of New York New York Casino.

The menu is pretty limited there are only a few burgers, shakes, custard ice cream blends and fries.  We tried a cheeseburger and the Stack along with cheese fries.   The burgers were hot juicy and very reasonably priced for vegas about $6. My burger had a deep fried mushroom patty along with the burger patty which was cool but it really didn't add as much flavor as I thought it would.  There was cheese inside the mushroom patty and it was BURNING hot so be careful if you order this item.   The cheese fries were excellent better than the burgers in my opinion.

Overall we were not impressed by Shake Shack, the food is good but not great, but the prices were FAB for Vegas.  In and Out Burger is pretty much the same thing for us peeps on the west coast. I am a fan of custard style ice cream so we will have to come back and give Shake Shack another try."}
{"text":"For my first review of 2016, I'm going to shake things up.  See what I did there?  Now that I got the bad pun out of the way onto the review.

I guess I'm out the loop cause I've never heard of the Shake Shack.  I just happen to drive past it the day of its opening and then heard about it later on that night. So I went there the next day to see what all the fuss was about.

There was a pretty good size line going outside.  But they were very efficient at handling the line.  I got my order and food in less than 30 minutes.  Cons:  The fries I didn't think were that good.  They were just too hard like they were overcooked and I didn't like the taste of the cheese sauce.  It definitely is a acquired taste.  Pros:  The Black and White shack was fantastic!  I felt that It compliment the burger quite nicely.  As for the burger itself...Amazing!  If I could describe the burger it was as if In & Out burger, Five Guys, and SmashBurger had one big threesome and had a baby.  The burger is the size of a In & Out, The meat has the look of a Smashburger.  And the patty has the moistness of FIve Guys...only better.  But the taste from this piece of beef is all Shack.  I can't recall having a burger that was as juicy as this burger.  Each bite was juicier than the last. I didn't try the custard or the chicken sandwich.  I heard those were really good as well, so I will be back to try those next time.  They also serve beer there as well.  The girl working the counter told me as I was waiting for my food if I ever had Shake Shack?  I told her that I haven't.  She told me that I will not be disappointed.  She was absolutely right. Welcome to AZ Shake Shack."}
{"text":"I like the milkshakes here. I got the strawberry one and the ShackBurger. The burger was was also really good. They have plenty of seating and it's super clean. You should definitely give it a try if you are on the area."}
{"text":"So, I'm a California guy, born and raised. Which means that I love In-N-Out. Because thats what Californians do. We love In-N-Out. So, I was interested in getting involved in the old \"battle of the burgers\" and make an informed decision based on actual experience and jumped on the opportunity to do so while in Vegas .

We ordered the Shack Stack which seemed to be their most popular. Its a perfectly cooked burger with a giant, cheese stuffed mushroom cap sitting on top that oozes cheesy goodness when you bite into it. So good. The fries were okay. Pretty pricey. Overall, very good experience.

So, which is better between In-N-Out and Shake Shack? Honestly, they are so different that its hard to say. In-N-Out makes one burger, very well. Shake Shack has more options. Overall, I'd see myself eating In-N-Out more often but that takes time, price and conveniece into consideration. Glad I was able to finally try."}
{"text":"Amazing right on the strip in Vegas outside of New York New York. The line was super long but moved fast, I had the shroom burger with coffee fair shake. They were both amazing I think I liked the shake better. Overall a great spot on the strip."}
{"text":"Your better off going to Bobbys Burger palace.  Food was ok at best. Tasted like  cheap fast food."}
{"text":"Always on the quest for the best ______ (fill in the blank).  Burger is on that quest list.  We don't have a Shake Shake in San Diego (yet...keeping my fingers crossed) so I had to give it a try.  

This was the best burger I have ever eaten.  I came home and spouse asked if it was better than the place that we usually eat burgers here in San Diego.  Told him it wasn't even on the same PLAYING FIELD.   This will be my first stop anytime I go visit my daughter in Henderson.  

Staff was super nice too."}
{"text":"Ended our Vegas trip with a stop here! Their shakes were amazing! Burgers were pretty good but nothing compared to in n out and it's 3x as expensive as in n out. The line wasn't as bad here as it is in New York."}
{"text":"Good burgers. Since I grew up with In N Out, this was a new taste for a change. Yes you can compare it with the Habit, Smash, 5 Guys since they make their burgers on spot. Big plus is you can order beer. I got the fat tire beer. Really went well with the burger."}
{"text":"First off, thank you, Shake Shack for always semi-curing me of my deathly hangovers. 

I've only been here twice and honestly both times, I felt like complete crap and wanted to throw up and pass out while in line (TMI, sorry) but even through the worst times of my life, I have to go to Shake Shack for some cheese fries and shake stack burger because I know I'll feel better after. 

I don't usually like crinkle-cut fries but the cheese fries are just soooo good and perfectly crispy. The shake stack burger is my favorite because of the fried portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese that literally drips out after you bite into it. Talk about cheese porn! Never had anything like it, and I fell in love. It's roughly $10 for a burger and they're actually pretty darn small, but I'm not trying to eat a huge meal while hungover anyway so it's always the perfect size for me. I don't know what it is about Shake Shack, but it literally revives me. We went in feeling like sh**, came out feeling brand new. Shake Shack has become a regular Sunday lunch place whenever I visit Vegas. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack. In fact, the night I proposed to my girlfriend in NYC, we had Shake Shack delivered to our hotel to celebrate!

Unfortunately, the Phoenix location leaves much to be desired. The food quality just isn't the same. My burger was overcooked, but the cheese wasn't remotely melted. My fries were soggy and not the same deliciously-salted, perfectly-crunchy fries I'd had in New York.

The only thing I enjoyed was my milkshake. It was the saving grace.

I really wanted to love this location. It's in a really awesome spot and had so much potential. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Came back again mid day on a Thursday and the place exceeded my expectations again! My first stop in Vegas for the trip and come to realize that NY NY now charges for parking. Not sure why they do that seeing how most casinos in the strip don't. I guess if you are in and out within one hour there is no charge. But I mean if you had free parking I would lose $200 at your tables instead lol.

Anyways, I digress. Shake shack was quick and easy good fast service and the burger is outstanding. I got a double shack and fries. The burger melts in your mouth. Probably the best burger on the strip! The double and fries will cost you about $12. Still better than just about anything I ate on the trip!"}
{"text":"I like the Cali locations but this was a bit below my expectations. I guess I miss no grilled onion option! The cheese on fries is a good idea. Shakes small. Single burger good but small for the bun."}
{"text":"This is SO NOT $30 worth of food!!! 

Burger is mediocre at best.  I'd have gotten a better tasting burger in a Happy meal. It's the same size.

The  bacon cheese fries were Velveeta.
The only saving grace is that coffee shake won't kill me.

My wife has a chicken bacon sandwich, even that would be better at Mickey D's.  At least her iced tea came from a fountain.

After all the hype I've gotten from this place...

Smash Burger is better...
Habit Burger is better...
Five Guys is better...
In & Out is better...

AND THEY'RE ALL LESS EXPENSIVE.

{"text":"I'm updating my review and adding a star based on customer service. After my previous review, someone reached out to me immediately, which I appreciated. I received a gift certificate and gave them another try. Happy to report that our order was correct and I was given the normal cheese for the cheese fries. I'd definitely go back and get them again, but they overall just aren't my favorite. I hate giving 3 star reviews since they are basically invaluable, but my taste buds can't quite stick 4 stars onto this."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have ever had - I had the same feeling biting into a burger at Shake Shack that I had with my first In-N-Out burger. Nearly every review compares the two places and I don't think it is possible to separate either of them. Both excellent burger joints. The price is decent as well, considering how expensive everything else is in Vegas."}
{"text":"What a great burger spot. Had the smokeshack with cheese fries and was a happy girl. The burger had hot peppers but wasn't too hot just perfect. The cheese fries were hot and cheesy. Glad to see that I have one near me at home about 30 minutes away."}
{"text":"all I can say about my experience at Shake Shack is Simply Fresh and Delicious...except I think the chocolate shake could have been thicker but that's a personal thing."}
{"text":"Food is great but wtf is wrong with the employees here? The resting bitch face looks we get from the people serving food and picking up trays. I'm sorry but if you hate your job and it's so hard for you to acknowledge someone coming to get their food when the buzzer rings, get a new job."}
{"text":"Over priced for what it is truly feel like in and out burgers are better tasting . the spicy chicken was pretty good has cole slaw on it that tasted fresh. They do have crinkle cut frys don't see them much any more."}
{"text":"I finally tried shake shack after having opportunities to try it in Texas and New York and passed them. It's not as hyped up as many of my friends tell me it is. It is a little better than In & Out (in the quality) but the price is what makes In & Out slightly better since these burgers are not cheap! But if you're comparing it to the pricey buffets and other restaurants on the strip, this is not a bad place to dine at. You're in vegas, you're on vacation - let it loose and eat fast food burgers! 

Friends & I ordered the shackburger, shroom burger, fries and all shook up concrete (frozen custard blend).  The fries were crisp and favored over In & Out's fries. The shroom burger was decent, not mind blowing amazingly good though. The size of these burgers are also a little small too. As for the all shook up custard blend, I wasn't a huge fan of the banana cake but loved the toffee bits. 

Line may seem long but service is quite fast."}
{"text":"Finally, I ate at Shake Shack so I can now conclude that In N Out is better.   

Overall Shake Shack is a much fancier restaurant...almost Umami Burger level but not quite.
The servers are friendly  (but so are In N Out servers)  and the restaurant is nice and clean.

The vibe is much more hip/urban than the old school diner-ish vibe of In N Out.

The burgers cost quite literally twice as much as their In N Out equivalents.  Which puts them in a bad category of 10-15 dollar fast food burger meals.   This is the category where the meal costs more than you want and never tastes quite good enough to match the price tag.   I always end up wishing I just spent less for slightly crappier food OR more for an actual sitdown restaurant burger meal.   

They have crinkle cut fries which are actually too dry inside...i much prefer the crinkle fries they serve at the random mom and pop Mexican joints in LA.   I got the shake stack which is the shroom burger + regular burger in one.   It's good don't get me wrong...but not ~9 dollars good.  The biggest problem is the tiny burger patty....i have this pet peeve against burgers having a crappy bun size to burger size ratio.   The bun is way too big for the patty in this case.  

They also serve a multitude of shakes, beers, hot chocolate and other drinks.   I got the coffee shake which was not bad but once again it's tiny.   The shake comes in a McDonald's child size cup.    

They have two fountain drink sizes...regular and large, so i'm thinking ok the regular is like a medium size at McDs (or any other fast food place really).   Nope the regular size is the same size as the shake, which is to say it's like a Happy Meal sized drink.   Sure it's unlimited refills but it's pain when you have to ask for a refill after every 2 gulps.   AND they don't take your cup and refill it,  they throw your cup away and give you a whole new one!  After 2 refills the destruction to mother nature was too great and I stopped getting refills.  Well played Shake Shack, well played.


In conclusion,  even if the burgers cost the same at Shake Shack and In N Out i would still order the In N Out burger because it's just more satisfying."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of positive things about this restaurant, especially the frozen custard. The custard is indeed fantastic. I would recommend anyone walking along the Las Vegas strip stop by and try the custard.

However, the burgers were a bit of a let down, especially considering the long lines. I've tried a lot of different burger places in this town, and there are plenty of better options. This particular location is near the New York New York hotel and casino, but there are a number of better burger places in that same area."}
{"text":"Good burger and fries. The shakes were small but very good as well. They are a little slow but the gals at the register were nice. A little pricey though."}
{"text":"I still don't understand what the hype is (I saw a line in GangNam Korea that was unending) but definitely decent burger and fries. I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner there, but I am not sure I would ever write home about it, or feel like my life is incomplete if I don't eat it. And I know there are many comparisons of Shake Shack to In-n-Out, but I feel like even though they are both serving burgers and fries, it's quite different. 
Shake Shack is good, on it's own, without comparing. And even if you were to compare, both are good. Delicious burgers and fries. Definitely would eat here again if given the option, but not to-die-for place to dine again."}
{"text":"Bacon cheeseburger didn't come with bacon  also, the burger was constructed terribly. Honestly could've gone to McDonalds and got a better burger. Shameful."}
{"text":"I don't get what the fuss is about... There was line out the door on a Thursday and let's just be honest it's not that good. Actually if I was being honest it's not that good at all. If you're vegan/ vegetarian right off the bat you should know your choices are minimal, that's not even a complain I have but just fair warning if you come thinking they'd have options. I had the shroom burger and cheese fries or fries with cheese or whatever the heck you would like to call it. Needless to say I was not impressed not in the least. The burger was mediocre at best and the fries were marginally better. The burger was just not flavorful enough and the fries were meh. 

Now also note they do not have wait staff who will come take your order so you basically walk in, order and then wait for your number and the token vibrates wherein you then go and pick up your order. Do that in a busy restaurant as a guy without having anything to put down to claim your table and let me know how that goes - I'll tell you not we'll because someone else is there already ! This however should cease to be a problem once the hype dies out because let's be honest it's kinda like a glorified fast food restaurant and for the price it sure as heck ain't worth it."}
{"text":"I'm shocked this place gets good reviews, OVERRATED!  I waited in line which I'm fine with, ordered the smoke stack, cheese fries and milkshake.  I don't care about cost, because nothing in Vegas is affordable.  The burger was mehhh, the fries were Ore-Ida with nacho cheese sauce on them.  Not sure what the hullaballoo is about this place, but I'll take 5 guys any day of the week!  If you want a better experience go across the street to Fat Burger, it'll massacre Shake Shake every day of the week and twice on sunday!  Shake Shack's stock is tanking for a reason.......BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT GOOD!"}
{"text":"This place is very overrated. I actually decided to try while in Las Vegas because Tamar Braxton praises this place. I'm not sure if she is getting paid to endorse because it was horrible. The food is way to expensive for the portion of food that you get. After eating the burger in 2 bites I told myself it would have been great to have a  real burger. They should have better dessert options. I ordered cookie dough ice cream and when I got the ice cream it was big chunks of dark bitter chocolate not the cookie dough I was expecting. Again, very disappointed I feel I wasted my money. I won't be back. I will try In and Out burger instead."}
{"text":"My first time eating Shake Shack was life changing omg! Lol. I thought this place was going to just be an ordinary fast food restaurant, but I was wrong. I'm hooked! Shake Shack's burgers is probably one of the best tasting burgers I've had. The Shack Burger and Chick'n Shack is so much more high quality and flavorful than your typical, average fast food burger/chicken sandwich. This place is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack! Its so freaking delicious. So many different toppings to choose from AND their cheese fries are to die for. Perfectly crisp fries topped with cheese, my mouth is watering just thinking about it! I wished I lived closer to one but it's always such a treat when I come across one. This is definitely a spot to check out when you're in Vegas! Or if you're ever by one!"}
{"text":"I had super high expectations for Shake Shack, since many of my friends swear it's better than any other burger place.  Here in Vegas for our annual March Madness trip and I finally had an opportunity to try it.

First of all, as other reviewers note, the line can be intimidating.  However, for Mlife Platinum cardholders (not sure if gold is on the sign as well), there is a special line that allows you to bypass the regular line.  Of course, you will get dirty looks from those in the regular line and you may have to explain that you aren't \"cutting.\" What I didnt expect was being rudely approached by a staffmember who immediately said \"this is NOT a line\"...oh really, then why does it say Mlife platinum? Her response....oh, all 3 of you have MLife?  I mean she could have more politely asked to see our cards if she questioned us. 

But I digress.  The food - I had a Shackburger, regular fries (my hubby had the cheese fries) and a lemonade.  The night before I had a strawberry shake.  The burger is good albeit slightly oily, but I wasn't wowed.  Although I do love crinkle cut fries, these were just okay.  The lemonade was a little strong for my liking, but the strawberry shake was delicious.  All in all, it was a good, quick meal but I wasn't blown away by my Shake Shack experience."}
{"text":"oh shake shack.. ive heard wonderful things by my east coast people but youll never compare to in  n out. your flat unappealing $6 burger. tastes like salsbury steak something the lunch lady would serve you in high school. the place was busy. but theres millions of great places to get a burger in vegas but i wasnt a fan. check it out if you want. kinda expensive and not that great. in n out is always #1. affordable, filling,good cost, fresh etc i feel here i was eating mystery meat."}
{"text":"Thank you Steven V. and Tee for providing such excellent customer service! Your smiles and courtesy are what separates you from the rest! Service was friendly, fast and delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing the chicken sandwich and shack cheeseburger was delicious !!! It exceeded our expectations! 

the only thing I would change is being able to make meals here at the shake shack you have to order everything separate (fries,drinks,burger) which makes it more expensive!

You have to get the cheese fries they are the best! 

Definitely will be going back !"}
{"text":"Buddy text me to go to Shake Shack. Said it is opening today (Mon, Dec 29 2014) @ 11am PST. 

I just had buffet at M Hotel. 4 rounds of entrees, and 2 rounds of desert.

Like I soldier, I go to Shake Shack 2 hours later. Gotta do it. Stomach pump me later!

You've had these burgers before. They are sometimes under the names of Jim's, Jakes, Hi-Life, Johnny's, or any burger joints you find on the roadside. It's the same thing, but perfected. Delicious. Seasoned and grilled at the right temperature. Fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and toasted buns.

There's a shakesauce but I think it's just thousand islands. Not sure.

You've also never experienced a roadside joint like this. It's upscale for this type of food and a fun decor. They also gave me a hamburger wristband during my visit!! You'll be paying upscale prices and that's my beef with this place. Whereas with Jim's you can get a combo for $5. Here? Double that.

Is it worth twice the amount? Are you getting whoppered if you do? $10 for the perfect roadside burger once or twice a year I would do in a heartbeat. I wish I had room for the ice cream. I heard that's really good."}
{"text":"Second time here. Vastly superior to the first visit. Really could not have tasted any better. The smoke shack burger was very savory. Both patties had a very nice char from the flattop grill. The melted cheese and the chopped red peppers were a nice compliment along with bacon. The bacon was real bacon not the so thin slices places like Red Robin use. The fries we're perfectly fried. Our boys ordered two shakes. Who knows what the butterfat content might be, but such a great flavor and mouth feel. Still think it is overpriced but I could not say a bad thing about the food or the very nice people working there today."}
{"text":"I had an excellent meal here with awesome service! We do not have Shake Shack in my town so I really wanted to try it out while I was in Phoenix this week. I came straight over from the airport! Lots of parking. The SS is in a really cool shopping center. Looks like they are re-doing it and it's very hip and fab in a retro kind of way. I wished I had more time to hang out here. 

I had the cheeseburger, fries and a milkshake (coffee milkshake). It was perfect. The perfect amount of food and just the right flavor. The meat is high quality, you can tell from the taste. I ordered mine well done and it came well done. Fries were crispy and fresh. Coffee milkshake was the bomb. I wish I could eat here more often!!! Maybe they will build one in Sactown soon.

LOTS of seating. I was worried it would be small inside, but it isn't. I came at the height of lunch hour and easily found a table. The staff and the manager were super friendly and kind. Well done Shake Shack!!"}
{"text":"People said this is the best burgers in Vegas, so here we are. After we try them, i agree with them, I love their burgers, must try!"}
{"text":"i usually judge a burger by getting the most basic cheeseburger w/out anything to mask the true flavor of the burger. with all the hype of this place i decided to try it. huge mistake, these burgers were mediocre at best. i ordered two cheese burgers, one order of fries, and one regular coke which totaled to $17 (ridiculous). burgers were small, fries were comparable to del taco fries, and theres no refills on drinks. i personally think in&out kills them in quality, taste, and price. the only good thing i could really say about shake shack is that it has plenty of seating inside and out. also the building's architecture is pretty cool. other than that, it's just an overrated, expensive, mediocre burger joint."}
{"text":"I prefer this over In N Out although the price is higher.  It provides more options and tastes better.  Coffee shake, 'Shroom Burger, Cheese Fries and Shack-cago dog were all delicious, especially the shake.  The bill did exceed $20 for a small quantity of food.  Get there early because people lined up before it opened."}
{"text":"Food taste was great...service is going to kill this place.  They been open for a month and still are disorganized and staff shows no sense of urgency and customer awareness.  I had to walk through a sea of 7 employees who were on break but talking to the window people in order to get my order.  This will NOT be my go to place, now that the thrill is gone.  I don't mean to be picky, but you pay WAY too much for poor service.   The problem is management and lack of training. 

So my recommendation would be give it a try, get it out of your system then continue to go to your regular burger joint or Swenson's drive-in."}
{"text":"First day in Vegas and needed food. Walked to NYNY, to find out its outside on the strip. Line was long due to EDC week, but we didn't wait too long. Menu was simple and large for you to read in line. Got the smoke shack, spicy chicken, double down fries, and a small scoop of chocolate & vanilla. The burger was good, didn't blow my taste buds away but I was not disappointed. The spicy chicken, was not spicy for me, but had a very good flavor. The double down fries are no joke, 2 person minimum. Locations in phx, so might go again."}
{"text":"The novelty has officially worn off and what we're left with is a burger that is slightly better than an In-N-Out at twice the cost."}
{"text":"Probably the juiciest burger I've had at a fast food place.  There was a wait during dinner time on a Saturday night but it wasn't too bad.  I ended up ordering a double shack burger, cheese fries, as well as a large lemonade.  They have two kinds of lemonade, one regular and a seasonal one.  I sampled both and the regular lemonade was far superior.

I usually hate crinkle cut fries cause I feel they don't stay as crisp and they get really soggy, but these weren't too bad.  The shack burger is just your basic burger, just patty, lettuce, and tomato.  The patty is cooked medium and has amazing flavor and it's really juicy.  The bun is a little soggy though and I wish there were more to the burger instead of just lettuce and tomato.

Everyone compares Shake Shack to In-N-Out, but I feel like it's an unfair comparison.  Personally I feel that Shake Shack tastes better, but it's double the price.  For a few extra bucks you can probably go ahead and get yourself a gourmet burger.  Also when you as for a refill they ask you to throw away your old cup and they'll get you a new one.  Pretty wasteful if you ask me."}
{"text":"Not a bad burger, just a little pricey. I had the Shack Stack burger which is a regular cheese burger with the 'shroom burger added on top. It's cheesy and tasty. Added a side of cheese sauce for the fries and not bad. 
It has a limited menu, four burgers and three dogs, but it has custard \"concrete\" shakes and beer & wine too. 
Bottom line is its good (for a burger) but not cheap."}
{"text":"No more having to fly out to NYC for these bad boys! Ended my most recent Vegas trip with lunch here - order times were super short, but wait time for food was about 10-15 minutes around 1pm on a Sunday. Not too bad!

I had the 'shroom burger and BF had the shack stack. Both were deeeelicious and we loved the gooey cheese that's baked (fried?) into the mushroom. We also noticed the bun was closed off on one side, so we wondered if that was on purpose to keep the cheese from oozing out the bottom. If so, smart! We also shared an order of cheese fries and a custard. I prefer the fries plain so you can really enjoy the crispness 'cause by the bottom, the fries were too cheesy. Custard was good, but too rich and sweet for me to take more than a couple bites!

Looking forward to making this a regular pit stop on future Vegas trips, and CAN'T WAIT for them to open their LA location in 2016!!"}
{"text":"It hurts me to say but Shake Shack's burger is better than In-n-Out but their fries aren't.  The prices were pretty steep for the portion.  

The Shack Stack: So good and proportionally.  The huge fried mushroom was an excellent addition.  It's delicious and it hurts me.
Fries: It's good and golden crispy.  Other then that it wasn't that special.
Salted Caramel Pretzel Custard: Very creamy but I can only eat so much before it started coating my mouth."}
{"text":"Best burger I have had in a while! The sakes are amazing, fries are great and so is the atmosphere! I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Spendy but so good! Been here many times. You can taste the freshness never frozen meat, good fries, great shakes. Organic tea and good lemonade. Legit."}
{"text":"Of all the burger places this is by far my favorite. You cannot find a better burger. And most of the time if you have a great burger, your fries are lacking... not in this case, equally as great! And the milkshakes!! Absolutely perfect milkshakes. They offer a variety of other drinks, including beer and wine, if you are into that."}
{"text":"Went in to get an order to go. The line was long but it was moving fast. Ordered shake shack burger for my husband and chick'n shake for myself. The chick'n shake was as good as I was expecting. The herb sauce on it was great, next time I'll get it on the side as a dipping sauce for the fries. The concrete and mango ice tea were delicious as well.  All of the above plus the fries was $27, a good deal on the strip for a meal with dessert on the strip."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to go to shake shack to see what all the hype was about. I have read the other reviews and thought, ok this may be good. I just ordered a cheeseburger and a vanilla shake. I was under the assumption on what other's wrote about the size of the burger how surprised I was when it came. McDonalds has bigger one's. It came with the cheese, one thin slice of lettuce, four small slices of tomato and their sauce. Burger had good flavor but the sauce took away from that so if I go back I'll get sauce on the side. \"Smashburger\" and \"in-n-out\" have way better burgers for the price. The shake was good but for 5.25 you would expect a larger cup. I'll have to go and try the fries to see how they are next. Seating area is small so you may have to wait for a place to sit or go outside on some of the few tables they have there. Just remember when it's 100 degrees out the water spray may help a little."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorites. We vacation in Vegas every year and it's always one of the first stops on our list. The burgers are really good, but the crinkle cut cheese fries are a must. We got one of the fancier fries with all the fixings but the regular old cheese fries are where it's at! Highly recommend! It gets busy here but you never wait long. It's also nice to get inside away from the heat even though they have a nice patio. It's also great that they have misters outside around the perimeter to help you cool off from the summer Vegas heat."}
{"text":"My favorite fast casual burger is AZ by far! The meat has a fantastic flavor and the bun is really soft. Fries were good too."}
{"text":"It was my first visit to Shake Shack with my husband who eats here regularly due to working there at Kierland. The burger I had was very flavorful and prepared with fresh ingredients! My husband enjoys the chicken sandwich that looked very good also! I had a marshmallow chocolate chip milkshake that was delicious too!! The patio area was clean with nice views of the shoppers enjoying the parklike setting!"}
{"text":"First of all, as a West Coast citizen, I'M SORRY! I KNOW, IN N OUT ALL THE WAY! LOL

Service: Can't really score service since you order at the cashier and grab a table and pick up when they call your number.

Food: The burger was really good, the cheese fries were great, and washing everything down with a coke, you can't ask for anything better...I have to say the reason why I like this place a bit better than In N out is because it gives out more variety of food to order.

Ambiance: A very modern dining decor.  

My notes: I hope my friends don't castrate me...."}
{"text":"So amazingly excited that shake shack is finally in az. The location is awesome and makes you want to hangout for a while. The staff is very helpful and helps all the newbies with the menu. Definitely come here!"}
{"text":"Customer service is great! Food is amazing!  Environment is fun! Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Love love love this location its quick and easy. The staff is friendly and the patio is nice! The hot dogs and fries were good. I did less than 5-stars because the facility was pretty dirty. Tables were hard to find that were clean. The dispensing station was overfilled. The condiment area was messy and there wasn't any ketchup filled in the spout. Other than that I'm sure I'll be back on my next visit"}
{"text":"If youve never tried their veggie burger, its a must! (and im no vegetarian!) 
Deep fried breaded Portobello with cheese and sauce.. Its to die for.  I dream about it constantly, but alas we dont get shake shack here in Canada. 

Its a must have whenever we are in the US and on my last trip to Vegas we went 3 times in 4 days. Lol. Gained 10 lbs but it was worth it."}
{"text":"They're located on the Strip next to Starbucks at NY NY (not inside the casino). Outdoor and indoor seating. Buzzer system for orders.

First day at CES and we hadn't had a meal all day. I heard they just opened this location and had to come here. I've been to serveral locations in NYC and miss the burgers here. Coming from CA, I prefer these burgers over In-n-Out because the buns are so soft and I'm not a fan of thousand island dressing.

My order:
Shack Stack: $9.49
Double Concrete: ($4.50) Oatmeal Creme Pie w/ banana  chocolate cheesecake and chocolate toffee
Additional toppings: +$0.60 each

My meat patty was on the thin side with a large battered and fried mushroom & gushing with cheese. My friend's burger was thicker and more juicy. The fries are crisscut fries and very hot and not overly crunchy. Cheese on the fries had the consistency of cheese whiz.

Allison had said my concrete was made incorrectly when I went to go pick up my food, so she said she would bring it out to me when they were done. When she did, she noticed that we had ordered the cheese fries and suggested adding their cherry peppers if we liked a little spice. We said we'd try it so she came back out with a tray with a condiment cup of the cherry peppers but also a cup of bacon chunks & another order of cheese fries. She said it was in case we didn't like it but boy did we love the cherry peppers!

The weekly flavor was oatmeal creme pie and was intensely sweet and had an strong oatmeal raisin cookie flavor. I had added banana chocolate cheesecake (as suggested by the cashier) and chocolate toffee toppings which didn't help with the sweetness at all.

I've been to serveral Shake Shack locations in NYC and the fact that they're willing to bring you your food if something wrong and the personal suggestions when you're unsure makes this location so much better. So happy they opened up!"}
{"text":"Short of hopping on a 5hr flight to NY, this Shake Shack's the closest I can get. On a recent trip to Vegas, boyfriend and I were starving late-night, and nothing sounded better than a burger, so away we went on a 20min walk down to New York New York. The place was buzzing with people, but the order line was relatively short, so we placed our order (two shack burgers, fries, side of cheese sauce), and proceeded to wait. Roughly 10mins later, we were rewarded with juicy burgers on soft, squishy buns. It's amazing how something so simple (bun, beef, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and sauce) can be so delicious.

If you're looking for something delicious, quick, and affordable on the strip, Shake Shack's your best bet."}
{"text":"Honesty the food is over-rated . The Chicken Shack was tasty but I prefer Chick-FIL-a chicken sandwich over it . The Burger was OK , I've tasted better and it cost less than what I paid. We spent $40 for basically a Hot Dog, a Bacon cheeseburger , Chicken sandwich , a small Lemonade, small milkshake (tasted way better shakes elsewhere) and a beer. The location is nice but other than that, I'm glad I can say I have tried Shake Shack but I won't be eating it anytime soon if ever.  

To each its own though, I know I have read other reviews and they love this place . 

I'm giving this place only a 2 star based on food. Staff was friendly and location was nice."}
{"text":"Line was long but it went by fast. The shakes and burgers were great! No complaints. 12.00 for shakes, but worth it. Appreciate the people watching seating outside."}
{"text":"Good food. Good price. Friendly employees. Clean bathroom. Overall good place to go we will come back."}
{"text":"Let's see, the fries come out of a bag.  The chicken in the sandwich was good, but the coating had no flavor.  Buns are small and disintegrate quickly.  Shake sauce had no flavor.  Shakes are ok.  But the worst is the price.   $30 for two meals.  In-n-Out, Wattaburger and Chik-fil-a have as good or better food for half the price."}
{"text":"This place is cool. Trendy, clean burger spot in the
Heart of Phoenix. There are lots of larger sized tables if you have a large party. And they have a designated table for all utensils, napkins, straws, hot sauce etc. which is convenient. 

The menu is decently sized. They have a few beers on tap which was nice and a few alcoholic shakes which I thought was creative. they're shake menu was fairly small for having the word \"shake\" in the name. Still great though. Just not as many as I was expecting. 

The order process is very similar to Smash burger. You walk up to the register, place your order. They give you a buzzer. You sit anywhere. When you're food is ready the buzzer will go off and you approach the expo table and pick up the food yourself. One thing that bummed me out was my inability to fill my drink.  The soft drinks are behind the counter and you have to tell them what you want to drink so they can fill it. This is always a bit of an inconvenience since most of the time you go back for a refill on the way out. So if you're one of the \"can I get a water cup. And then fill it with soda\" kind of guest, you're out of luck here. Their drink sizes are only small and large and he food comes out very quick !

Overall great experience. The menu is not overwhelming. Great atmosphere and would see myself visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars! My friend has had Shake Shack in NY and is a fan, so when we decided to go to Vegas, we made sure to make a stop at Shake Shack, which is so appropriately located at New York New York Casino. This is a cute burger and fries place. When we arrived, there was a line of people outside. There was an employee who was minding the door and letting people in as the line inside moved along. She also handed out menus. The line wasn't short but it moved along pretty quickly. 

There were several cashiers taking people's orders. My cashier was super friendly. She took my order of the single Shackburger (a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, and Shacksauce), the CRINKLE CUT fries, the mango lemonade, and a cup of the vanilla frozen custard. After paying, the cashier handed me one of those buzzer things, that light up and vibrate when your order is ready. My friends and I grabbed a table that was outside. Even though it was like 3 in the afternoon, the place was very busy and all the tables inside were taken. Very popular! Maybe about 8 minutes later, my buzzer went off and I went to go pick up my food, which came on an adorable little silver tray. I love eating cafeteria-style! There is a condiment station with mustard and ketchup, with napkins and straws and such. 

The Shackburger was very tasty. The crinkle cut fries were delicious. I love crinkle cut fries - they are just so cute and they remind me of childhood - hot meals in elementary school! The mango lemonade was just okay - it didn't really taste much like mango. Just more like lemonade. The custard was just okay also. I would totally come back here to get another Shackburger, or next time, I'd like to try the 'Shroom Burger, which is a fried portobello mushroom filled with cheese - it's their veggie option. Actually they even have a burger that has both the cheese burger and the 'Shroom burger TOGETHER. So this may actually solve my dilemma of wanting both! And definitely more crinkle cut fries. I may skip the custard next time but maybe a shake. We actually thought about coming back the next day for more Shake Shack, but we were too full from buffet, so that didn't end up happening. Next time!"}
{"text":"Lots of 5-Star dining on the strip...and lots of fancy chefs, but I'll take Shake Shack over all of them.  The service, value, and quality is second to none and they just know how to do it right.  Keep it up, and thanks for opening a Shack in Summerlin!"}
{"text":"Our first visit here. Been wanting to try for a while. Staff was super nice to let us sneak in and order right at 10 pm when they could have said they were closed. Thank you!! Agree with other reviewers who said it was over prices for the amount of food. I love the quality of the ingredients but our burgers came out kind of squashed on their buns and with scant toppings. Just looked like a McDonalds quarter pounder. A bit salty too but cooked well and served hot. Fries were good. Got a black and white shake that was great but small for the price. I'd love it if they would add a turkey burger as I'm always searching for spots that serve a good one. I'm not sure we will come out of our way to eat here again, we'll see."}

{"text":"Shake Shack and my taste buds finally got to meet! I had no clue this was here in Vegas and never thought I would ever try it unless I went to the east coast. I opted for the shack stack with the mushroom. Oh em gee. As soon as I chomped down for my first bite I felt all the cheesy gooeyness and I fell pretty much in love. The built in cheese was just pure genius. I have never had a mushroom burger constructed like that before. We went with the cheese fries and now I wish we had went with onion rings or something else. To start I don't like crinkley fries. They remind me of cafeteria food and and cheese was a bit much for me. Unfortunately we were grabbing a late lunch and had plans to eat at bachannal shortly after for dinner so I decided against a milkshake or float. This still makes me a bit sad that I didn't get to experience a purple cow float, whatever that even is.. But it sounds cool and yummy. Perhaps another day. Overall though I still much prefer in-n-out."}
{"text":"After hearing all the rave about the NY location, I was so excited to eat here! We got the SmokeShack and it was delicious. I thought it'd be spicy but it was just tangy from the peppers. The place is pretty big and I like the webcam in the back. The customer service was great. The portions are a bit small but satisfying. It was a great experience."}
{"text":"I got a chocolate shake and the chicken sandwich. The shake was runny and not very good. The chicken sandwich was pretty good. I would go back again."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 SmokeShacks, a Chick'n Shack and a Jackpot Concrete. I had the Chick'n Shack and it was delicious. I was apprehensive as I do not like fried chicken, but the Shake Shack did an amazing job making the outside crispy and the inside juicy. The buttermilk herb mayo was light and tangy. This was simplicity at its finest.

My friends had the SmokeShacks and loved the sweet pepper and bacon. They said that the flavors went well together. We finally ended our meal with the Jackpot concrete, which was vanilla custard with some chilled crunchy waffle bits. I liked how the waffles were chilled and layered throughout the dessert. This gave the concrete a good texture.

We came at 5 pm and they were packed to the gills. There were absolutely no places to sit inside. I was standing around waiting for a table, where the people were taking their time finishing up. Someone came and took the chairs at the table I was waiting for. How rude. 

Not only are the customers here so rude, the staff is rude as well. One lady was loudly indicating that she wanted everyone to leave so she could go home. Also what is up with the buzzer buzzing and the food not being ready? The servers at the food pick up counter told me that my food wasn't ready yet. Well then don't have the buzzer light up. This caused a lot of customers to cluster while waiting for their food. One star has been taken off for the service.

I would definitely come back to another Shake Shack to try their other menu items, due to the high quality. This is so much better than Chick Fil A. However, this specific location needs some serious training in customer service and crowd management."}
{"text":"Dang it. I was so ready for the worlds most mind blowing burger, hot dog, fries and shake.  I can't say I was disappointed because it's different. I saw the lines for the past few months at both locations and I waited to strike when the line was gone. So I hit it up.

Bacon burger was good. The bun was one of the best in the biz. The meat fresh. The bacon- meh.

The fries are good and crispy. They zig zaggers which some either love or hate. Personally not a favorite but people are so picky so whatever.

The hot dog loses.  A competitor has a similar hot dog and the quality of the dog is better and the char on the bun is better. Pass on the dog here. Tastes boiled. Not sure.

The shake/ice cream though. Legit. Went with a marshmallowy, chocolatey, waffle coney cup of wonder. I'll be back just for that after a burger.  Seating was amble and staff friendly so all in all a great little burger shack. Not a place I'd go out of your way to have but maybe cravings will start."}
{"text":"Shake Shack: A personal retrospect of how it managed to win me over from In N Out. 

*Disclaimer - It is inevitable to compare this place to In N Out, please continue reading at your discretion.  

Ever since my trip to New York back in 2011 I have only dreamed of having Shake Shack again so when the news spread that there was one opening in Vegas, I knew this was my chance. Before I've eaten here, In N Out held the throne as the best fast food burger you could get. After many postponements, I finally made a trip out to Vegas with a few Yelp friends. I knew our first stop was going to be Shake Shack no matter what since it thankfully closes late. After checking into the hotel and dropping our luggage off, we headed to the New York New York hotel. 

The restaurant is located on the strip with a huge sign so it is really hard to miss. We arrived around 1:30 am and there was no line at all which was nice since we were all famished! The burger menu is fairly straightforward, there is the original ShackBurger which is their standard cheeseburger, the Smokeshack which has bacon and chopped cherry peppers or you can opt for a vegetarian option with the 'Shroom burger. If you are feeling really adventurous you can get the Shack stack which is the 'Shroom with the standard cheeseburger. Besides burgers they offer hot dogs, a variety of dessert items as well as craft beer and wine!   

Since I've already looked through the menu countless of times, I decided to go all out and get the Smokeshack burger with a double patty with an order of cheese fries and the fifty/fifty drink which is half lemonade and tea. The cashier was very friendly; I wonder how much they make. I think the best customer service for fast food places are in no particular order: In n out, Chick-fil-a and Shake Shack. 

When you finish ordering, you get a buzzer to wait for your order; from here you can choose to find a place to sit at the vast interior or outside. It is nice that they have more than just the conventional seating of booths or tables, but also a few large lounge chair seating available. I sat down and waited anxiously for my buzzer to go off like if I held the winning lotto ticket. The wait seemed like forever but finally it was my turn to head to the counter to pick up my order. Walking back to the table shaking with anticipation I finally took a big bite after 4 long years of waiting and I can only describe it as THE ideal burger to which all burgers should be judged upon, it is THAT GOOD. Where to start? The buns are potato roll that is SUPER soft. Like In N Out, only FRESH ingredients are used to ensure the best taste from the crisp lettuce, tomato, pickle and onions, there is no trickery here. So what makes this place the king of all burgers? The patty. The patties here are larger than In N Out and not as smothered in sauce and super juicy. Combined with the bun, cheese, pickle and onions and last but not least BACON every bite is like a party in your mouth. I am also a fan of crinkle cut fries; there is just something about the ridges and the crispiness to it that a regular fry cannot achieve. Smother it in cheese and you got a clear winner. 

Needless to say that every bite of the burger was just as delicious as the first by the time I finished it I was craving another. It's so good if fact that I came here a SECOND time before I left because I missed the awesome goodness. Scrolling through the more negative reviews, I realized that many people have a common complaint which is the price. I understand how this can be a concern but it's not like you are eating it every day. This burger is better than most sit down restaurants and you are paying equally if not more to eat a burger there so I don't understand the complaint. If there was a Shake Shack locally to where I lived, I would be happy to indulge in it maybe once a week or every other week and I'm sure it is not going to break the bank. 

Well, if you have made it this far down the review then I congratulate you. 5/5, 10/10, whatever your grading scale is, this place takes it EASY. 

For a TL;DR version - The best burgers that I have ever eaten, EVER."}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Yes! It was soooo good!! We live in California and there aren't any shake shacks by where we live so we decided to give this place a shot. It was so good. The burgers are small but they filled us up. The first bite was heaven! We went yesterday and are for sure going back today! The line was long but definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Pricey for what you get

If I am looking for a fast food burger I usually visit In-N-Out Burger. However, today we were loking for something different and thought we would try the Shake Shack. 

The restaurant is well kept and clean and the staff was friendly and accomdating. The restraunt wasn't busy and we were able to place our orders right away. The food we got was good, but other than some variations on the kinds of hamburgers they have, nothing was overly impressive for the extra price. Two single cheeseburgers, an order of french fries, and shake at Shake Shake comes to $23

This is a place to go to if you want alcohol with your burger.  Shake Shack offers a large collection of beers, wines and mixed drinks.  However, If you want a burger and fries and a soda, I would head to Zinburger or In and Out for much less.

{"text":"This burger place is on another level all on it's own. When you first arrive you feel as if the wait will be long, but they have at least 6 registers to order from. When you wait in line they have a huge wall with the entire menu so when you get to the front you already know what you want.

Here you have to find your own seats. It's crowded but you will find a seat whether it's inside or outside. What was cool about their tables, they were made from an old bowling alley lane, which they branded on the corner of each table. Pretty awesome.

I got the single hamburger with shake shack sauce, cheese fries and a coffee shake. I love this burger! The patty was flavorful and the bun was just like hawaiin  bread, and the sauce...so yummy. Pair it with cheese fries, so good. they give you a wooden stick to eat the yumy gooey cheese fries. Even if you are full, the shake is just so yumy that you can't stop sipping on it. The coffee shake was so good, like creamy ice cream...yummy! 

This is a must try when you are in vegas, but it kept us full the entire day."}
{"text":"Customer service suks here. Cashier rolling their eyes taking order and asking for a spoon was too much to ask for. I'm so glad we have Habit burger near us, not to mention they have much tastier burgers. I would skip this ShakeSucks"}
{"text":"The line was ridiculous the beer was good did not have a shake and will have to go back. Visited on Valentine's Day."}
{"text":"Amazing! I have been wanting to try Shake Shack for so long, so of course it was on my list of things to try while I was in Las Vegas for a few days. Worth it - cheap, fast, and amazing burgers!"}
{"text":"I think Shake Shack is a pretty good joint when craving for fast food that doesn't seem so much like \"fast food\". I know a lot of people talk about this place being pricey and that In-N-Out has better burgers, but all in all, Shake Shack is not all bad.

I don't crave for burgers that much, but their veggie (portobello mushroom) burger is really good. That and their cheese fries are the main reasons why my fam and I come here. Sometimes it seems like they don't put enough cheese on the fries, but I'm pretty sure you can request for extra. I don't see why not.

One of their specialties is the frozen custard ice-cream called a Concrete. I highly recommend this menu item if nothing else seems to be striking out to you.

They have a lil menu for dogs too if you happen to bring the furry friend along. My dog taste tested all the treats and loves them!

If you're in the area, give this place a try. Plus you can go shopping right after since this restaurant is located in Downtown Summerlin!"}
{"text":"Over rated and over priced.  Hamburger no better than regular fast food fare.  I prefer in n out burger.  Chicken way too spicy.  Fried were good.  I could have had better service and better food across the way in the sit down restaurant.  Just because they serve wine and beer doesn't make it a sports bar."}
{"text":"I love this place. It was packed but the line moved quickly and we were able to get our food and get settled before I knew it. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very delicious!! Lived up to the hype. Came here for the first time and had a great experience. The patty and shack sauce were flavorful, though the burger was a tad smaller than what I've had at in n out for instance. The fries were perfectly crispy and salty. Lots of seating space both inside and outside. Really good service! The guy who delivered our food also gave us free chocolate custard!! Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Sooo awesome here Riki the manager was awesome and Jessica I think her name was took such great care of us we were a large party too!!"}
{"text":"So many fucking haters on Yelp. If something comes in with a huge reputation, it seems like so many are eager to tear it down. When you review a spot, you should go with an open mind. Blank slate...like if you were the first one to review a new joint that nobody knows about. That's a true reviewer! 
With that being said, the shake shack in Dt summerlin was as good as I expected. Met with a friendly greet. Cashier asked if we needed recommendations. Place was clean and staff was eager to give the guest right-of-way and politely held open doors. Burgers were consistent to what I had in Madison Square Park. Strawberry shake was thick AF and tasty. Crinkle cut fries aren't my fav but good enough. Probably won't get cheese on them again-personal pref. 
How the hell can this be only a half star above Crave? This spot at least tries and should deserve at lowest 4 stars."}
{"text":"A group of us went here after our retreat. We were really looking forward to it. The menu was extensive and the service good!  I had  the shack burger, fries and a strawberry mint lemonade. 

All were passable but not great. It's not a place where I would crave their burgers or fries. At least not like I do an In 'n Out burger!  I found the burger to be on the smallish side. The meat was flavorful and cooked to perfection. It wasn't a big fat two-fisted burger like I thought it might be. The fries were decent; crispy and a good sized portion.  

When our order for 14 people came up, two servers delivered them to our table and went around asking who ordered what. Nice!  I was dreading picking up tray after tray and trying to figure out who ordered what. Thank you for being on the ball staff!  Way to be on top of things. 

Not a bad experience, just not the best burger I've ever had. 

I'd go back and try something new just to see if I change my mind and will update this review then."}
{"text":"Beer Float is seasonal dark beer topped with vanilla frozen custard. If you mix the frozen custard and beer together to form a creamier drink, the flavors work well together. A more subtle stout that has more roasted coffee or dark chocolate flavor forward would work a little better. Otherwise, it was really good and reminded my hubby of his college days. Rating: 4.5/5

SmokeShack is a cheeseburger topped with all-natural Applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and ShackSauce. The seasoned beef patty was grilled to perfection. The lettuce was crisp and the tomatoes were juicy. The onions were not overpowering and had a sweetness to them. The cherry pepper was a little intense but it had a good spicy kick. The bacon, however, was a little dry making it both tough and chewy. The bacon either needs to be thinner and crispier or thicker and fried a little less for a softer texture. Rating: 4/5

Shack Stack is a cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger (crisp, fried portabella mushroom filled with melted Muenster and cheddar cheeses) topped with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce. If you like steak and mushrooms, this is the burger for you. The fried portabella mushroom added a crispy texture, but once you bit through, the mushroom was just juicy and oozing with melted cheese like a mushroom popper. The beef patty was juicy and beefy. The bun was brioche-like and held together to the last bite. Rating: 5/5

Cheese Fries are topped with a special blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce. The fries were crispy and the crinkle cuts helped hold the cheese sauce on the fries. An addition of chili or bacon bits would be great options to add to the menu. Rating: 4.5/5

All Shook Up Concrete is vanilla frozen custard, Gimme Some Sugar banana peanut butter cheesecake, and chocolate toffee. The vanilla custard is made on premises and made with real sugar and milk from hormone-free dairy farms. You definitely feel the presence of Elvis while eating this! All it needed was some bacon. It was a great mix of flavors but the cheesecake was really heavy - maybe less of the cheesecake and more fresh banana. The vanilla custard was creamy and fantastic! Rating: 4/5"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of hype on Shake Shack over the past few years. My wife and I get to PHX fairly often for warm weather and family. I drove past this location last Feb. and was excited to see a sign announcing \"Shack Shack coming soon!\" We were in the area the first week of Jan. 2017 so made a point of stopping by.
     We were greeted warmly upon arrival and asked if it was our first trip {must have been our deer in the headlights expressions.} The menu was explained and we went with two basic burgers with cheese and an order of the crinkle cut fries. Also we shared a chocolate shake.
      The store was very attractive and well appointed. We were there after 1pm so parking was not an issue. Great geographic location.
    Our food was good but not inspiring. I think sometimes the hype makes patrons expect more from a restaurant than is logical. A little expensive and greasy but definitely tasty fare. 
     We have been big In-N-Out fans during our AZ trips but would consider Shake Shack again."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time over the holiday.  The food was good and prepared quickly.  My order was correct and no complaints.  Giving it a 4 Star because it wasn't anything special.  There are a lot of burger places to choose from and this was just ok."}
{"text":"Sorry this place is over hyped. 
1. Expensive $6-7 for a small burger. 
2. Bun gets soggy
3. Chicken is just chicken
Go to in n out and compare. You won't come back"}
{"text":"We had to experience the hype and I have to at that it was really good.  I love the fresh ingredients.
The burgers tasted a lot like In n Out, but with more options"}
{"text":"I'm so glad Shake Shack has decided to venture out west! It's SO, SO good! I've heard comparisons about it being better than a beloved SoCal burger chain, but I think it's an unfair comparison. Shake Shack is what I would consider a \"gourmet fast food\" burger whereas the other chain serves a typical fast food burger. Get it? Got it? Good! Ok, now that we've gotten that out of the way... 

This particular Shake Shack is located within the NYNY Hotel & Casino compound and is STILL worth venturing to. Yes, even with all that traffic on the strip. They have plenty of variety to choose from whether you enjoy burgers or hot dogs which you can have accompanied with fries and cheese fries. They also have shakes and custards along with beer and wine. Yup! You read that right folks, BEER and WINE!!! What's not to love about a good old fashioned American meal of burgers and fries when combined with alcohol? You kidding me? NOTHING! Get here and get here now! Before the lines get even longer! ;)"}
{"text":"Great burgers for a chain, faster food type of place.  They are made fresh to order and you can taste the difference.  They are served in a little paper wrapper and you should keep it in there, I took mine out and took a bite....well it is fresh so needless to say I got a couple of drops of grease on my shirt.  The fries were nice and crisp bit I think I prefer them plain better than with cheese as the cheese did make them a little soggy.  Prices are reasonable, for my single bacon cheeseburger, my husbands double, cheese fries and a water it was just over $20."}
{"text":"This is the 1st time going here and it will not be the last. The staff  was great.  The cashier was wonderful. She answered our questions and offered her favorites too. I had the black and white milkshake  which is vanilla  ice cream and brownies. It was great. I just wish it was bigger. I also had the Smoke Shack burger. It was good, but there was to much of the calery peppers on it and it took away from the burger.   Next time I am in Vegas, I will be eating here at least once."}
{"text":"I am INTO IT. 
I've heard many many things about this newish, hot burger chain from the East coast. Took a short trip to Vegas and some friends wanted to try it so I was definitely eager to see what all the hype was about. 
Now, unfortunately I only had a burger and fries so I cannot comment on the shakes. 
I came for the meat and potatoes and I was not disappointed. I had the double cheeseburger and the cheese fries, which was not the best idea, but still tasty. Next time I'd prefer the fries plain buuuut the burger was delicious. 
It was how  I always want my In N Out burger to taste...beefy. The burgers are a nice size and their cheese is unique because they make their own blend. Honestly, it kind of tastes like Velveeta but I was ok with that! It worked with the burger flavor overall. The bun was nice and soft and I like how they don't cut all the way through, so it's almost like your burger is nestled snugly in a nice potato bun pocket. At least it tasted like a potato bun. Easy to hold and kept everything from sliding out! 
Also they have crinkle cut fries which are my jam. Give me crinkles, waffles, tots...anything but shoestring and you've got me. 
I'm a fan...and personally, I like it more than our classic In N Out.
I know, I've defected!! So I'll just turn in my West Coast card and see myself out."}
{"text":"Like many things that migrate from NYC, Shake Shack didn't quite live up to the enormous hype.  It's a quality fast food burger, but by no means is it the \"Best Burger in the World!\" as others might suggest.  

Stopped in on a Monday night and the line wrapped almost to the entrance.  The ordering is quick and efficient so it only took about 10 minutes to get the to front of the line.  I ordered the Smoke Shack and Cheese Fries with a small drink ($15.00).  The cashier was nice enough to let me know that there were free refills when I tried to order the large drink.  Food took about 10 mins and despite being packed there were plenty of open tables.

The burger had a nice soft bun with smoked bacon, cheese and slightly spicy red peppers.  I had seen on TV that Shake Shack uses a secret blend of ground beef for their patties, but after the peppers, I really couldn't taste the beef.  The burger is pretty small, but by the end I was full.  Cheese fries were nice and crispy, but the cheese sauce was pretty tame american cheese sauce.  It's impossible for cheese fries not to be good, but these were nothing to write home about.  I will take In-N-Out Animal Style fries over these any day.  

What really impressed me about Shake Shack were the employees and how smooth everything ran.  One thing I regret is not trying are the shakes and desserts.  Those looked great.  

It may sound like I didn't enjoy Shake Shack, but I did.  However, Las Vegas has sooo many great burger joints that I have to compare accordingly.  

My Recommendation: If you're in need of a quick, affordable bite on the strip, Shake Shack will please almost everyone.  If you have more time and a few extra $'s there are plenty of burger joints, like Burger Bar by Hubert Keller, that offer a better value and tastier burger.  If you have a car, go to in-N-Out for a double double animal style meal for 1/2 the price."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients but buns are too small and too soft, fries are good, but place is pricey. Chocolate custard excellent."}
{"text":"Used to eat here when I lived in NYC and so happy we got on in Scottsdale. Good quality food and fast service. So delicious!!"}
{"text":"If I could give a negative star rating I would! 
Let me start from the beginning. We asked what the shacksause was and the worker couldn't even tell us what it was, what it was similar to or what was in it. 

We then took the lid off of our $5.29 shake and it wasn't even filled all the way. When I went up to question why my shake wasn't filled all the way the worker replied that they don't fill them all the way!

Next was the burger, while it did taste good it wasn't so good that I would pay $5.29 ever again for JUST a burger. I could go to a countless number of other places where I could pay just about the same amount and get just as good of a burger and get fries and a drink with it. 

And then we come to the fries. Again they tasted fine but were a little over cooked for my liking. 
Needless to say we will NEVER be coming back here again. 

2 burgers, a shake, fry and a soda for $23 no thank you. I came hungry and am now leaving hungry. We will be returning to our usual cheaper prices and good tasting burger places."}
{"text":"I may anger a lot of Shake Shack fans. But sitting down at Shake Shack, the roommate whispered to me, \"This is like an overpriced Wendy's.\" I didn't think that exact same thing, but I kind of agreed with him.

*SmokeShack: cheeseburger topped with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and ShackSauce ($6.69 single)
The roommate's burger. I had a bite. I thought the meat to bun ratio was a little off. More bun than meat.

*Shack stack: cheeseburger and a 'shroom burger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce ($9.49)
My burger. Besides this being hard to eat due to the height, I thought the mushroom overpowered the whole thing. Plus the breading was too thick and hard. I did enjoy the mushroom by itself though. Without the breading.

*Shack-cago: shack relish, onion, cucumber, pickle, tomato, sport pepper, celery salt and mustard ($4)
The roommate wanted to try a dog as well. I took a bite. It reminded me of a Chicago dog.

*Cheese fries: topped with our special blend of cheddar and american cheese sauce
My favorite thing we ordered! The fries were good and the cheese sauce was yummy.

Drinks:
*ShackMeister ale: brewed exclusively for Shake Shack by Brooklyn Brewery ($6.50 for 16oz)
*Fountain soda: Coke ($2.75 large)

I don't get it. Both the roommate and I had friends that adore Shake Shack and told us we HAD to go. Maybe it's better in NY, but I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"My most recent visit at Shake Shack wasn't the least of what I expected out of them. I have visited the location on the strip several times expecting that the service and quality of food would be just as good. That wasn't the case this past weekend. Now I really wasn't in the mood for a burger per say and I was open to trying out something new. My friend and I both decided on the chicken shacks! One of them original and the other just the traditional style. They were offering a new style of bbq bacon fries that sparked some taste bud interest so we went ahead and through a side of those on! Roughly $20 bucks later we were given our buzzer and found a nice spot to sit out on the patio. The timing was perfect and once the buzzer wrong we proceeded to get the food. Now. I know that you can't predict which size chicken patty is going to come out of the bag before you drop it into the fryer however I would like that there would be some sort of consistency on the size of the chicken breast that is ordered. My biggest issue with this situation wasn't just the size of the patty but it was the fact that they chicken was over cooked. I really couldn't understand how an order that consisted of two chicken sandwhiches one was cooked correct and the other was over cooked. My friend brought this to the attention of the person working and really didn't get a very caring response.. more so along the lines of a pretty nonchalant well that's just how it's mad kind of thing. Yikes! If that's how you treat the customers who come and spend good money on fast food then I can easily go to KFC or hell even McDonalds and order a chicken sandwhich.. Without even further arguing we decided that it was a mistake to even give them the benefit of doubt that with this 3-star rating it was actually warranted. Can't say that I'd be back to this location anytime soon. Just left a bad taste in my mouth... literally..."}
{"text":"My first time eating here was a few nights ago and I must say that I actually enjoyed this place! Not enough to rank it five stars because I really didn't see what the big deal was? When I arrived the line wasn't bad at all especially compared to from what I heard can be extremely long! M life members can actually order through an expedited line which is awesome however I didn't need to whip out my Platinum card this visit lol it wasn't that serious..My order of choice was the double smoke shack burger! I waited approximately 7-10 minutes for my burger to go! I will have to return to try out more of the sweet side such as the shakes and ice creams but other than that I'm just kind of like meh.. it's a burger place.. what's next? I personally have another great Burger place of choice but before I completely rule out coming back to shake shack I have to try maybe another burger.."}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers! The bun was light and buttery. I ate the double shake burger, the pattie was a bit salty but the hamber itself was delicious. The fries were the best. They were crinkle fries so they were packed and crispy. I went a little passed 12. There was a slight line but nothing that we couldnt wait. We drank the red velvet custard shake and the strawberry shake both delicious but nothing special. But there beer was crisp and refreashing. The placed was packed so it took time to find seats but overall atmosphere was young and sporty. There were lots of tv and was placing the basketball game."}
{"text":"I always end up eating here when b-tches wanna get burger and fries in Vegas. I hate when people try to compare this to In N Out. its seriously like do you even know food?? 

Anyways, this place is not bad. I just don't think the burgers have enough taste and krinkle fries are what your parents give you in elementary school. :/ I like their peanut butter shake though! 

Reason for low review is that, there's nothing special about this place. Basic af. Also, the prices are ridiculously expensive for that exact reason. When I can get a meal at In N Out for 1/2 of the price and it tastes 4x better, you best know where I be."}
{"text":"Pretty decent location and good consistency. I ordered a double and got a shroom burger (it was a pretty large order) - but I was starving so I managed to finish it both. The burgers are good, the wait can be a bit of a tiebreaker though because the line can get you waiting for your food for around 15 minutes. If you're not starving and want decent burgers that you don't have to wait hours for in the area (looking @ you Gordon Ramsay's Burgr), this might be worth a shot. Growing up in California and subsisting on in-n-out though, I must suggest going there instead (can't beat the price-to-value ratio)."}
{"text":"After much hype by the Arizona Republic we tried the place. EXPENSIVE for what you get. We got a burger that was the size of a slider, french fries that tasted frozen and a milk shake. The bill was $30.00! Wow, we will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"\"How do you go to Shake Shack and not get a shake?\"

That's the question my friend asked me and I literally do not know why I didn't get one because they are amazing! I was lucky enough to get a taste of my friend's strawberry shake and it was creamy and not overly thick. 

The burgers are a bit small for the price and unless you're getting the Shack Stack with the fried portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese, I can't see how you can get full from the regular burgers. What's great about the burgers is that the bun is closed off on one end sort of like a hot dog bun so your ingredients do not fall out. But for almost $10 for my burger, it is definitely not anything to compare with its \"rival\" In N Out in the West Coast vs East Coast debate. In terms of burgers, In N Out wins in my book both for time, price, and taste.

Fries-wise, Shake Shack has the better fries with its crinkle-cut fries and its option of cheese fries which should be a thing across all fast food burger shops.

As for shakes, I also go with Shake Shack just because In N Out shakes are always too thick for me so it's nearly impossible to drink through it without having to use a spoon or wait for it to melt. Shake Shack also have a lot more options in flavors in shakes."}
{"text":"Not real impressive-the burgers not bad -the hotdog not bad-chicken burger not bad.  The fries typical.  The cheese on the fries -meh.  The Shakes are in a small cup?  Loud music!  But wtf? The big screen sports TV is on Bowling???!!! at the exact time the 2018 Daytona 500 was on!!!
Overall -over rated!  Can say I did it -but once was enough.  Don't make this a MUST try!"}
{"text":"Everyone is super crazy about this place. I'm not to sure. I got the mushroom \"burger\" and was disappointed. They stuck to mushrooms together and fried them. This resulted in trapped uncooked batter throughout. Quick fix would be to lightly batter and fry each shroom individually. I think it would have been better that way. I didn't actually go to the location because a coworker brought it to me maybe next time I can enjoy the atmosphere and a better built burger."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying out the Shake Shack burger franchise. My friend and I ate here at lunch in Las Vegas. We walked in and you would see this giant menu that listed various items for you to order. I ordered the original shack and shack burger combo. After you order, they give you a buzzer to let you know when your order is ready which a nice touch is so you don't have to stand waiting around for the burger. The beef patty was nice, juicy and fattening which I simply loved. Fries were good and weren't too salty. The staff were friendly and helpful. One of the staff offered to refill my drink and I gracefully declined but then I decided that I would get a refill so I went out to the counter to get another refill of coke. My first experience was good and now I can't wait to eat another burger at Shake Shack when I visit the states!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect to agree with the semi negative reviews here, but I do. A bit overpriced and the burger was not great. I didn't think it had a lot of taste and the meat seemed a tiny bit, sorry, but almost chewy. The crinkle fries are really good, crispy and salty. I cannot get the milkshake because I can't cheat on Sugar Bowl."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to Shake Shack since I learned they've made their way out West and I knew that my business trip to Las Vegas was the perfect time to do so. There are no places I'm aware of on the West Coast that serve custard, so I was particularly excited to learn their shakes are made with custard. I got the spicy bacon cheeseburger, cheese fries and a peanut butter shake. (You've got to put out of your mind how many calories you're eating when visiting this place.) I was not disappointed with the burger other than the size. My bad. Could have ordered a double patty. I was particularly pleased with the fries, of which I had low expectations going in--I've NEVER been a fan of crinkle cut fries (though I've only had the Oreda version made in your oven). The fries were perfectly crispy and salted. You really can't go wrong with cheese fries, can you? I would definitely go again and probably order another patty. Don't fret over the size of the patty; it's fine. I just happen to think all burgers should come at the half-pound size. Neither of my coworkers who I dragged along had even heard of Shake Shack before (for real!). I asked my West Coast coworker which is better: Shake Shack versus In-N-Out. Shake Shack won."}
{"text":"Had super high expectations for this place and it definitely LIVED UP TO THE HYPE!!

I got the shack burger, which is just the regular cheeseburger. You can definitely taste the high quality patty- super juicy, flavorful, and not dry! It would've been extra bomb if the bun was a little toasted, so it's something I'd ask for next time. Cheese was melted to perfection and their inside sauce was really good!

Fries were PERFECT! Super crispy and potato-y. I didn't even have to ask for my fries extra crispy like I always do, so they know what's up! 

Overall, this place was amazeballlzzz. My new go-to place in Vegas now!!"}
{"text":"The location and cleanliness of the restaurant was good. I had the Chicago Hot Dog and Chicken Sausage. The Chicago Dog was butterflied so it list all of its \"crack\".  The Chicken Sausage was good. It was served on a bun with no condiments.  

The buns were cold and not toasted. Maybe I should have asked for a toasted bun. 

I didn't have a milkshake or side, but they looked good. Maybe if I have one of those, I would have given a better rating."}
{"text":"These days a burger is a burger. There are so many good burgers where I live (San Diego) that I just don't get the hype around this brand. Maybe in New York they don't have many good burger options. 

The burgers are pretty small, but only cost $5-$7 or so. Over all the burgers were unremarkable. Like I said, there are many outstanding burger options out there now so you really have to go above and beyond to get my attention."}
{"text":"Oh my Lord!!! They hype was real for this one. We had been waiting to try this place since we went to NYC earlier in the year but unfortunately, the lines were always well out of the door. When we spotted this gem at the Las Vegas Outlets and on the strip, we knew we'd be making two different trips. 

The first stop was at the outlets. We ordered the Smokeshack double and a regular single patty cheese burger with a highly suggested concrete. Now I've had many burgers, but this place I can only compare to other chain burger joints and I would definitely place this well above In-n-Out but right on par with Five Guys. The burgers were juicy and the flavor was ridiculous! We hit the Strip location the night before leaving town and relived the experience all over again. The only addition the second time around was a Chicken Shack burger which neither of us really cared for. 

Stick with their all beef burgers and you simply can't go wrong at this place. No matter the location, you get the same good and fast service, and absolutely amazing food!!"}
{"text":"Ok, ok, I was wrong. I was overly critical of Shake Shack the first time I visited a location in New Jersey. I have to admit that I'm a diehard fan of In-N-Out, so I'll admit that I went into Shack Shack with less than an open mind. Fast forward several years, and I'm ready to give the place a fair \"shake\" (hardy har har).

Man, the burgers are fantastic. They are smash burgers, with a perfectly browned, Maillard reaction crust. The buns are soft, pillowy brioche-style breads. It's all very high quality. Cooked to order, and delicious.

I previously hated on the Kringle cut fries, but you know what? They're pretty damn good. Dip 'em in cheese sauce, and they're heavenly. Yum.

This location was very busy, being on the Vegas strip, but the line moved quickly and we got our food in short order. 

I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for In-N-Out, but I'm a Shake Shack fan for life now."}
{"text":"Located at the New York-New York, Shake Shack is yet another east coast staple bringing more burgers to the Las Vegas strip. The restaurant itself is actually just outside of the hotel, and is currently (may never be, I don't know) not accessible from inside. It's a pretty good size space, and has a ton of seating, from booths to tables, and even some weird, but cool lounge style areas. They've also got their own restroom inside, which is a nice touch. It could just be me, but having to walk out of a restaurant and look for a bathroom somewhere else in the casino is annoying.

Now, when you first walk up the steps and inside, you'll see a big menu board right where the line forms. On more then one occasion during our visit, the line was almost out the door. So, if you're able to find one, I'd look for a paper menu to view while waiting. On that menu, they not only have burgers, but also a few hot dogs and dessert options like milkshakes and concretes. They've also got a decent selection of drinks including draft root beer, several beers choices, wine and even Stumptown Cold Brew. Sadly, it's just bottled and price almost $1 higher then anywhere else.

I ended up ordering a previously limited special burger that they've now but all turned into something that will always be available, according to the cashier at least. It's called the ShackMeister and comes topped with beer marinated shallots, cheese and their own ShackSauce. For whatever reason, they only allow burgers to be cooked either medium or rare, and even those choices aren't listed anywhere. Even so, the meat was decent and seasoned well. I'd highly recommend getting at least a double though, as the patties are only 4oz. My burger had a good amount of cheese on top, and the crispy shallots added a nice texture. They also use potato buns, which I thought was a kind of soggy, but good and still had a little chew to it. The ShackSauce however, was all but impossible to taste. 

We also ordered some cheese fries and milkshakes. The fries aren't anything spectacular on the own, but they're nice and crispy, and the cheese blend they use to top them is actually really good. My malted Coffee Fair shake was pretty tasty and had a nice strong coffee flavor, but it was pretty thin for being malted, and not sure it was worth $6 for how small it was.
 
Speaking of prices...I expected them to be up there, but not this high. All the items on the menu are a la carte style and my burger alone was $9. Our order of 2 burgers, 1 fry, 1 drink and 3 milkshakes was $44 and some change. With everything we ate tasting very similar to something like In-N-Out or even Steak 'n Shake, it prevents me from giving them anything other than a 3 star rating.

Their service however, is well deserving of 5 stars. Our party of 10 and then 2 others who showed up laters were constantly checked on by more then one employee. Because they don't have an actual soda fountain, the employees have to go around checking to see if you need a refill. We were there eating and chatting for well over an hour, and never had empty drinks. 

For visitors, I can certainly see why it'll be popular and do extremely well. It's a decent burger, the shakes are quite good and the service is excellent. But for locals, past trying it for the first time, I can't see many going out of their way for something that's similar to what you can get for half the price from places easier to get to all over town. With that being said, I'd still eat here again, I just won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Located in New York Casino in Las Vegas Strip. Fries are the best!!!Super recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Been here 4 times now and they never disappoint!! One of the best burger in Vegas!! Drove 4 hrs just to eat there burgers!!! Now they opened one closer to my house so no need for 8 hr drive to get my burger fix. So if you want the best burger in Vegas Shake Shack is it!!!"}
{"text":"This was on my Vegas bucketlist for quite sometime and I finally got to try it ! It was so good that my friends and I came back the next day and order food from here again haha. The location of this place is great ! We stayed at the Cosmo and the walk from there was probably about only 10 minutes. When we arrived there was no line and a lot of extra seats left (assuming everyone's going out to eat somewhere else or getting ready to hit the club) The first day we went I ordered their Shakeshack burger with their famous fries. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Its such a simple meal but forreal tho the burger was outstandingly amazing. Better than the average In-n-out everyone keeps saying is mouth watering every single time. I love their fries though their like a crinkle cut style that still is crispy yet soft on the inside. The Sunday we went to Shake Shack was actually REALLY BUSY. Like so busy there was a line outside and it was about 113 degrees out. Even with the fans blowing mist in your face I was sweating out alot. But dont fret ! The line goes by super quick and staff is always friendly and of service. This time I ordered the Shake Stack Shroom burger with crinkle cut fries and a peach lemonade. A little pricey....but hey, ITS VEGAS PEOPLE. but the shroom burger was worth it ! Its literally a burger with a mushroom/cheesy filling with lettuce and tomato. Pretty filling because I couldn't finish it all. Since it was so busy, the seating situation was a little different than that Friday afternoon. (Probably because it was around 12pm for lunch time)  and we had a group of 9 but luckily there was 2 tables that got up next to each other so we were able to seat somewhat near each other. And i mentioned earlier that the employees here are nice and at service. I say this again because one of my friends accidentally dropped his tray of food all over the ground and literally nothing was saved from that and he brought the tray back and the employees replaced all his food free of charge and gave him an extra burger as well on top of what he ordered (THERYE SO KIND!) so A+++ for shake shack employees, 5 stars for the food and ambiance as well ! Can't wait to come back to Vegas and eat here again !"}
{"text":"When in Rome...

As a burger fan, when in California, I make my way to In-n-Out without fail. When in Texas, I make my way to Whataburger. When in New York, I make my way, of course, to Shake Shack.

The Shake Shack just outside New York-New York hotel & casino on the strip feels a lot like walking into the Shake Shack in the theatre district in NYC. Their burgers are true to the brand.

What makes a Shake Shack burger unique and amazing? It's the Martin's Potato roll. Okay, the Shack sauce is also key. The Vegas location does not depart from this perfect recipe.

So if you're a Texas Whataburger regular or you're a left-coaster with the In-n-Out urge, stop in to Shake Shack and see what the nor'easters are so crazy about."}
{"text":"Rather underwhelming. I figured it would be pricey considering the location, but I didn't see much value here. The same 1/4 pound burger, fries and drink could be had for cheaper at the food court across the street. Speaking of which, the burger, while ok, lacked the flavor of most other high concept burger joints. They also make the mistake of getting cute with their \"Shack Sauce,\" a Frankenstein-ish connoction of ketchup, mustard and mayo mixed together. Granted they had ketchup and mustard stations but why not have that on hand in the kitchen?

And they serve crinkle fries. Really? This isn't an elementary school cafeteria.

And despite their prices this place is too cheap to spring for Coke so you get its dime store cousin, Pepsi.

Sorry. I hear a lot of good things about this place but I'm just not seeing the value."}
{"text":"hands down my favorite burger joint aside from super duper burgers in san francisco, ca. 

smokeshack dbl is my normal go to and I love the combination of flavors! love the sliced up peppers and smoky bacon with all the fixings. the first time I had this, I thought it was better than most burger spots, but I am a regular now because whenever I crave a phenomenal burger and polite service etiquette, this place is consistent in quality. 

I love the shake selection & concretes, & the fries are always delicious and perfect in texture! 

the to-go orders can get a little more messy, but that's expected. I love this place. Great job shake shack! You definitely have a forever consumer!"}
{"text":"Was at the shopping center with family doing some sightseeing and got to dinner time and the aroma of burgers was overwhelming so we had to try,  was good as the fries. Very helpful staff as I am allergic to some items."}
{"text":"Slowly, I am becoming a fan of Shake Shack's burgers -- not when you have to stand in line for two hours, still not my favorite style of burger, and I'm still not a fan of the fries (which is almost a good thing ...) -- but still.  Maybe my tastes are changing, maybe I'm coming to appreciate their dependability, maybe it's the chopped cherry peppers available as a topping.  But I do know that I now happily eat here over available alternatives and actually look forward to it."}
{"text":"I came here two days in a row! 

I came on my first day Monday, July 6. It was pouring rain and super windy outside as we arrived. Inside the place, it was dripping in areas from the rain. I ordered the Smoke Shack single with Fries and a Rootbeer on draft. Smoke Shack has to be requested to get lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles on it. If you forgot to mention or ask about that, you'll just get the meat, cheese, bacon, special sauce, cherry peppers n buns. The fries are so fresh and crispy cooked just right! The Rootbeer, I didn't like. It tasted flat so I had to return it and get another soft beverage. I tried a taste of their peach lemonade, it was way too tart. I went with Coke, to be on the safe bet. 


The following day, I went on Tuesday July 7. No rain, no leaking roofs this visit. It looked like things were back to normal. I figured to order a double this time (Smoke Shack Double), cheesy fries, and their desert. The double was waaayyyy too much for me, I was better off with the one patty, took me forever to finish it and it tasted less cheesy with double the meat and veggies. The cheesy fries we're soo delicious, I wanted to get more but was getting full from my double cheeseburger, and wanted to save room for ice cream custard. 

For desert, ordered two different ones to try. My favorite was the white one (All Shook Up), as the other (Jackpot) was too sweet with the strawberry syrup. I would order just the concrete (custard) all those other flavors were making it less creamy and complicated for my taste buds as I didn't think the mixings blended really good together. 

Oh yes, this place is constantly busy. It will die down for maybe 5-10 mins and the line quickly gets packed again. They do really well for seating though, because a lot of the people just eat and leave. They give you buzzers, and so you grab your food when it goes off. Staffs are really helpful in removing your plate/trash. Bathrooms are clean and well stocked. There's only one sink though in ladies, which is a bummer to wait to use to wash your hands after you use the toilet. Great place to check out and be a total pig!"}
{"text":"I live in the downtown summerlin area so I frequently enjoy the shops and restaurants. 
I stopped in here mid day and it was easy breezy ordering. 
The decor is very sleek and clean, they also have a handful of flat screens for watching. 
Although very friendly, the cashier got both our Orders wrong, We ordered a a shake shack protein style and and one without the cherry peppers. They both came out not correct, both on a bun and both with cherry peppers. 
No biggie they promptly fixed our orders and we greatly enjoyed. 
We will return and this is a must try for anyone who enjoys a freshly made burger."}
{"text":"This place is good if you are a cheese lover. All the fun things to order like the cheese fries, shack stack, etc are dairy galore.

I decided to try all the things people suggested, like the shack stack& cheese fries but because I'm not a huge fan of cheese, it wasn't amazingly the best for me.

My friend got the chick n' shake burger and that was really good! 

Overall, it was a decent burger place... Next time i'll probably go with my basic order of hamburger, normal fries, and maybe a shake ;)"}
{"text":"The food is on the pricer side and doesn't allow for cheese variations. It was disappointing to find out they only had American cheese. No kids meals but offer organic kids apple juice so I'm not sure what kind of generation of customers they are marketing to. Nice that they have natural food products and hormone free. Maybe the prices reflect the quality but compared to other burger places such as smash burger, in-n-out, and the habit it doesn't stand out. I love the philanthropy with the No kid hungry campaign."}
{"text":"Trendy but no substance. The bun was good, the cheese tasted as if out of a can although not, the meat has an attempt at a sear but only served to dry it out, the sauce was simply poor and the were fries were mushy inside. I was expecting something decent but it clearly all hype. Once the hype is all over maybe as  in the fairytale people will realize the king is naked. Go to Johnny rockets for a decent burger and I'll still stick with McDonald's fries."}
{"text":"Save your money... I don't get the hype for the price of a decent burger. Is there a beef shortage? A meal that would cost $12 at most other shops was $23 here. Silver lining I can now say \"I tried it\". The size of the their shakes are suprisingly small, the fries weren't hot or flavorful. I thought the burger was good. I got there basic burger add bacon (of course)."}
{"text":"I came back after some coaxing from the customer service team. This time I had the chicken sandwich and fries. It was an OK size, but it was tasty. The fries were good as always. I just have to say the size and the price just don't add up. Almost $7 for a small chicken sandwich. If only they would just serve bigger portions, I would become a fan of  this place. I was on the phone and they brought my meal to me which was very nice. Customer service was good."}
{"text":"This place is so darn good that it is worth the flight to Vegas just for this burger and shake.  Just before I flew out from Vegas I made it priority to stop by once more :)"}
{"text":"Gross. Save your time and money and go to in n out. Peanut butter shake tasted like eating peanut butter straight from a jar which was way over powering. The burger was bland and soggy. French fries were terrible. I won't take anyone here when they visit. I didn't finish any of it and it was expensive!!"}
{"text":"Meh.  I'm not sure why people so desperately want to make this place cool.  The burgers are very mediocre.  They don't taste much better than  (and are quite similar to) the burgers at the fast food chain Steak & Shake.

I hit up the midtown location in NYC and was underwhelmed.

Tried it again here in Vegas at New York, New York and, again, was not impressed.  

I'd give this place like 2.75 out of 5 stars.  

Fukuburger across the street is MUCH better!  Hell, In-n-Out has a location a short drive (a mile, maybe) away."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite burger joints never have had a disappointing experience always good food and good service a lil more on the pricey side but a nice treat!!"}
{"text":"How i wish it was better than what i was expecting,
Or maybe it's better in Actual New York?!?!?
We had lunch Here and there was plenty of people for a Tuesday during rush hour. 
Ambience was ok. A lot of tables inside and outside. Bathrooms were clean.
I ordered the Shake Stack burger which was actually good well maybe because it had a deep fried mushroom and i love mushrooms! 
My bf ordered the ShackMeister burger (single patty $6.19) and it turned out to look like a kids burger. No wonder they offer double patty for $8.99. He wasnt very pleased with the burger, and i can understand why. He'd rather eat a Big Mac and it would be more fulfilling.
We also ordered the cheese fries which was just ehh! The cheese was ok. I was expecting more of a nacho cheese. 
It kinda sucks that my expectations of this place was so high and now im just bummed! :("}
{"text":"I seriously don't like writing these reviews but when I go out I expect a certain level of customer service. Let me start from the beginning... So my friend and I ordered our burgers fries and drinks, the cashier reread our order to us she got everything correct. She gave us our buzzer we went to the bathroom and found a table the buzzer started buzzing. Went to the counter the tray has only one burger the fries and a drink, I asked where is the other burger? She said \"you only ordered one\" so I went back over to the cashier who took our order and I said what happened you took the burger off after you reread the order to us? And she said \"yeah it was a mistake\" ok that's fine mistakes happen I get that ( i have worked in my share of fast food ) the lady next to her said \"so do you want the burger now or...? I just looked her, I said can I please see a manager because now all this other food is going to go cold while we wait for the other burger. She went and got the manager, she came out didn't apologize didn't actually say anything besides \"do you want me to put that burger on the fly for you? uhmm I had to pause and think the fly ? oh yeah i mean i guess we keep talking about it did they think i suddenly changed my mind and wanted to share my burger with my friend? I don't understand why this wasn't addressed professionally and with some type of apology... shit happens I get that we all get that but i didn't remove that burger from my order and to top it all off we ate cold french fries and my burger was cold by the time we got my friends. We will not be returning here... theres plenty of other places"}
{"text":"We eat here every time we come to Vegas. Everything is spendy in Vegas but Shake Shack isn't bad and the food's great. There may be lines but they crank it out pretty fast.  Hot dogs, burgers, cheese fries, shakes, everything is good."}
{"text":"Those burgers doe... The Shack Burger is probably one of the best burgers I've ever had.  And let's just get this out if the way: they are nothing like In-N-Out's burgs and quite frankly, not like any other burg I've ever had. The buns share the consistency of a King's Hawaiian roll, soft and squishy but not sweet like one. The patty is thin and flavorful, the cheese is basically Kraft American singles and melty, and the sauce is a pickle-ketchup-mayonnaisy mixup. Crinkle fries were good - they're kinda like Del Taco fries, only a little crunchier. 

I was disappointed in the shake though, we got the \"black and white\" and it was nothing to write home about. I took 2 sips and was over that shizz. 

The 'Shack is pretty expensive ($28) for 2 cheeseburgers, 1 fry and 1 shake, with small portions for the price. Don't get me wrong: I'm cool with small portions, as long as the price tag matches. That burger was great but everything else about the meal, meh. This place is also pretty packed, so be prepared. We waited in a long line for about 30-40 minutes at lunchtime. I didn't take pictures of the food because I was too busy stuffing it into my face...my bad for that. There's plenty of really good pictures in other reviews so please do scroll on.

Cool find for you grillers out there: my boyfriend found an awesome Shake Shack burger recipe hack, and it was probably the best burger I ever ate when he made it, so we were pretty excited to try the real deal. Here is the link if you want to try making them yourself, pretty epically yummo:

{"text":"We tried shake shack for the first time today and didn't see what all the hype is about. The burger tasted pretty good but was small, the fries had no taste/seasoning, and the shakes were nothing special and, It was $25 for two people!! 

I will be sticking to five guys, in n out, and Steak 'n Shake."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on the southeast corner of the Premium Outlet Mall North - very closed to self-parking, valet and taxis.  

Food was tasty but reminded me of Smashburger - which is average to me.

I love the French Fries and the beverage center.

Employees are friendly and helpful.
 Restaurant is clean and well maintained.

I would return if in the area."}
{"text":"Fell in love with this place on a trip to New York - the biggest difference is that at this location I only waited 15 minutes for food compared to the about 45 minutes in New York.  

This time around I had the ShackBurger®*, the The Chick'n Shack®*, and their delicious crinkle cut fries. Each bite of everything was an instant trip to Mouthgasmville, and I'll likely be returning once more before the end of my trip, in a lovely drunken stupor.

Peace."}
{"text":"I understand this place just opened. But the lines were way too long for the prices and food quality. For the last 17 years,? I have been going to Shake? Shack in NYC and the service was better in NY. I hope CLE can get there staff up to snuff in the next few weeks because? waiting to order and then get your food. The outdoor seating is nice, but crowded."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Shake Shack since I've heard so much hype about it and it was on my bookmarked list of places to try while I was in Vegas.  Also, my sister highly recommended it since she tried it when she went to Vegas several weeks before I went.  It's located in the New York, New York hotel.  I was staying at the Monte Carlo like right next door to NY NY, so I was able to visit this place several times, since it was close by.  

I loved the burgers!  It was just so tasty, especially the meat patty.  The Shake sauce tasted good.  The veggies in the burgers were cut thick and fresh!  The crinkle cut fries were good too.  I also tried the Cookies N' Chocolatey Cream (special flavor) custard in a cone-that was so good!  You can check the website to see the calendar to preview what upcoming special flavors there will be.  They have different special flavors every week.

It is a bit pricey in my opinion (almost $15 for a burger, fries and a soft drink), but it is located in Vegas, so everything in Vegas is expensive.  They don't have combo meals, you buy everything seperately.  They serve alcohol (beer & wine) here, but I didn't try it because I was already buzzed by the time I came here late at night. 

I've passed by this location several times and I've seen lines out the door.  But luckily, during the times when I went, there was no lines, and we didn't have to wait very long for the orders.  They will give you a pager and buzz you when your order is ready.  Customer service was really good-since it was my first time, they explained about the different items they offered.  I wish there was one back home in Seattle.  I would definitely come back here next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"JUICY MELTY BURGERS

I had the pleasure of coming here for a YELP ELITE EVENT which also made me want to come back! I typically do NOT eat burgers so if you can make me want a Burger I would have to say *bravo*

The staff here are so SWEET & FRIENDLY although I will have to say the so called manager may want to watch what he is saying in an open kitchen... I went to the counter to ask for a piece of lettuce & the worker asked the tall manager guy for a piece of lettuce & he says \" what are we... feeding a rabbit?\" Ummm talk about turn off.... I am standing right in front of you... that will be my only reason for 4 stars.... 

They even have dog treats for sale as well which is freaken cute! 

Also came back here w/ come girlies to grab dessert & another manager that was at the yelp event was giving out little samples of the hot coco which we ended up buying! 

SMOKE SHACK BURGER $6.69 - the SAUCE is freaken awesome & it has a slight kick of spice which I LOVE since I'm not good w/ burgers... but that spice makes it all good. 

DBL SMOKE SHACK BURGER $9.95 - double the patty

CHEESE FRIES $3.95 - crinkle fries cooked to perfection & drizzled w/ cheese sauce 

SHACK 2 O $2.35 - part of the money is donated 

RED VELVET CHEESECAKE CONCRETE - RICH & CREAMY  but the least rich out of all the flavors!

SEA SALT CARAMEL HOT COCO - this is my new FAVORITE place to get hot coco!! It is so thick & creamy & hot!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my stop here. It's like an In-N-Out Burger with an expanded menu. I had the Chicken Sandwich (fat boy trying to cut back) and it was great from the bread to the Chicken itself. 

I adore the location and the patio is great for people watching. Plus it's a contest here to see who can drive the most expensive car through and gives the ladies a chance to showcase their over priced bags and clothes.

It's a very comfortable location and great for the kids to romp around. Burgers seem to be the main stay of the menu with a good selection of shakes. The shopping here rocks and the summer wear can be eye catching (hubba hubba). Not that I look of course.

There are great coffee stops and Postino's is on my agenda every time for a quick glass of wine with friends. The Scottsdale Quarter is across the street and within walking distance. It's a great place to sit and catch all of these great conversations about how each person one ups the person next to them and soap opera like with the drama. Check it out, it's a blast! Bring your Pacer or Neon and freak the crowd out!

{"text":"Love this place! I went with my coworkers then told my husband about it and he wanted to try it! I've had the mushroom sand which and the spicy chicken sandwich. Both were yummy!"}
{"text":"Call me crazy, but I like Shake Shack more than In N Out! I tried Shake Shack for the first time over the weekend, and it was so good!!! It was so good, we went back the next day! I was never a huge fan of In N Out anyway (I know, blasphemous). I tried both the Shack Burger and the Smoke Shack burger. Both are delicious. The buns are soft and pillowy, the meat is tender and flavorful, and the cheese is nice and gooey. And of course, the Shack sauce is delicious. I'm salivating just thinking about it. The burgers are simple yet delicious. The fries aren't my favorite, but they're still good. We also tried their cold brew, peach lemonade, and creamsicle float. The peach lemonade was really good, although it was a bit too sweet. And the creamsicle was delicious (it's basically vanilla ice cream with orange soda; sounds weird but it was good!)."}
{"text":"I'm giving Shake Shack a 4 Stars only because I only tried one item from here to go. The chicken sandwich is amazing. It's probably the best chicken sandwich ever. I'm not one for pickles so I took them off and added tomatoes. But it was crispy and not salty, which happens with fried chicken and why I am so impressed when someone does a good job with it. I will be going back to try more items and maybe next time I'll give a better review."}
{"text":"So being from the west coast I can understand why the people in the east coast love these burgers...they obviously don't have In-N-Out Burger out there and this is the closest thing to it. The lady who worked there said people would line up in NY and wait up to 3 hours in line for a burger.

Totally not worth standing in line that long, don't get me wrong they are tasty burgers but not that good. They are very fresh and the meat, veggies, and buns are tasty. My bf got a hotdog and that was tasty as well. 

Of course being a Shake place we had to get a black and white and that was good also. Overall I wouldn't go crazy over this place because it reminds me so much of In-N-Out but it was fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"Shake shack is where it's at. I always spend under $30 here so everything is fairly priced but it's soooo worth it. The burgers are juicy and the service is excellent. What more can you ask? My favorite burger would have to be the smoke shack with the peppers and apple wood bacon. Literally have never tasted a burger that heavenly and real. Their fries are enticing you just HAVE to order them with your meal or you're missing out. Definitely my favorite burger joint for sure but I wish there were more locations in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"People compare it to In & Out but I think it's completely different. I don't think one or the other is better. They're most amazing and fulfill my burger standards. 

The burgers here taste fresh but definitely on the (oily?) side. Which I like! Their crust of cheese from the grill that's on the meat & burger patty makes it that much tastier. I'm obviously not trying to be healthy when I'm craving a juicy burger!! It's on the smaller side but order fries and shake and you'll be full!

Their strawberry shake is my fav!"}
{"text":"I arrived here on a weekday around noon and was lucky enough not be stuck in Shake Shack's notorious lines. There were only about five other groups ahead of me, which gave me just enough time to figure out what I wanted to order. All four or so cash registers open so the line moved reasonably fast.

Shake Shack offers eight milkshake flavors, including a weekly flavor. For the last week of March/first week of April 2015, the flavor of the week was malted marshmallow. Overall, I ended up ordering one single ShakeBurger (their original cheeseburger with one beef patty; $5.19), one double ShakeBurger ($7.99), two double SmokeShacks (cheeseburger with two beef patties, bacon, sweet peppers, and no lettuce or tomato; $9.49 each), two cheese fries($3.95 each), and a black and white shake (vanilla with chocolate fudge; $5.25).

It took about 10 minutes for our buzzer to go off so that we can grab our food at the pick-up counter. The burgers were seasoned and flavorful, though I wish the buns were more toasted like In-N-Out's. Shake Shack's menu states that all their burgers are cooked medium unless you order otherwise. I like my burgers cooked medium, but all our patties were cooked well done. That's particularly too bad considering that a place that advertises themselves with default medium-cooked burgers overcooked each patty. I tried both the double ShakeBurger and double SmokeShack burger. I like a little heat in my food so I enjoyed the sweet peppers in the SmokeShack burger. Other than that, the ShakeBurger was better because the lettuce and tomatoes made the burger more well balanced. By the way, if you're a fan of onions, Shake Shack's burgers don't include onions... Lucky for you, onion haters!

I love cheesy fries so the crinkle cut cheese fries option is great. The cheese fries tastes just as you think they would - previously frozen crinkle cut fries with artificial cheese sauce. Good, but nothing super special about it other than it's not an item you typically see on west coast menus. As for the milkshake, the black and white shake was runnier and not as thick as I like.

Good burgers and cheese fries, but In-N-Out's burgers has Shake Shack beat in taste and price. I'm glad I had a chance to try Shake Shack without a long line and having to fly to New York. Would I wait here again if the wait was over 45 minutes long? Ehhhhhhh...."}
{"text":"My son has been wanting to try this burger place since they compare it to In N Out.  It did not disappoint!  Burgers were simple but JUICY and TENDER!  We opted for the double down fries with the chili peppers on the side because of my little one, and those were also very good!  Next time we visit we will try out one of the shakes.  Don't know why we didn't order one today.  But this is DEFINITELY a place that I would go back to for a good burger!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time while I was visiting in Las Vegas and I waited in line and while I was in line the manager made an announcement that they had ran out of meat and were still waiting for the delivery. Very disappointed I had to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was scared people were over-hyping this to me but wow so yummy!! Ah I'm getting hunger pains writing this review. So glad we decided to try it out. It's outside of New York New york past the bridge so it's not inside the casino. And no you cannot compare this to In n Out, they're just too different! But Shake Shack the burgers feel a little smaller and are definitely a bit more costly. The shakes here are thicker but oh so good. Got the half and half? I'm not sure but chocolate and vanilla mmm. But I'm glad I shared because the shake was pretty rich and heavy.  

The Shake Burger was delicious. The ingredients are really fresh and just hits the spot when you're hungry. We came here after a day club and it was definitely a good decision. I also got the cheese fries, these were alright but I'd probably just order regular fries next time, nothing too special about them."}
{"text":"If you don't like shake shack, you've been brainwashed by either Mickie Ds, In n Out, or god-forbid Whats burger.  Look, everyone had varying tastes on what the best burger in 'Merica is, but when it comes to fast food burger, Shake Shake for me is it. 

I've had the Shack burger in NYC multiple times and now in Scottsdale. I've also had plenty of In n Out in California and Steak and Shake in Indiana.  For me, the combo of the bun with the fresh Patty and the shack sauce make Shake Shack, in all locations, the place to beat. It's a wonderful combo of flavor and freshness, every bite savory and indulgant. Some may day is on the expensive side and I will have to admit it's a bit on that, but for me, it's worth it. I eat a burger once every so months, so I budget money (and health) around a shake shack burger.  Burgers are very controversial, that's never going to change. But don't let anyone tell you you shouldn't at least allow your taste buds on glorious sampling of a shake burger. Try it for yourself. 

The Shack Is Calling."}
{"text":"For all the hype it was an okay meal at best. The burger was ordinary and the french fries were okay but the cheese sauce was really great. Shakes were okay but for the hype and word that I got from Back East about Shake Shack I was a little underwhelmed overall"}
{"text":"This place is great and very reasonable I had a spicy chicken slider was really good but not spicy at all I loved it I'll totally recommend this place"}
{"text":"Now this is where it's at! Great friggin' burgers, shakes, and fries! I had the Shake Shack burger, which is a double cheeseburger. This is one awesome burger. The patties are 100% beef with no fillers. The patties are bigger than In n Out and Five Guys. The meat is flavorful, grilled, and browned on both sides. It comes with lettuce,  tomatoes, and Shake sauce. The fries are crinkle type made from Yukon potatoes. The shake are so good! I had the vanilla malt and it was had just the right consistency to suck through the straw. If they opened one here, I would not think about going to another fast food burger joint. It's that good!"}
{"text":"Great burgers! I personally like that there's a little more variety than In-n-Out on the menu. And I like that it's a nice casual spot for lunch or dinner with or without the family. Was greeted promptly when I walked in this afternoon and I ordered a single Shackburger and a small fries. I keep seeing reviews that the burgers are too small, but IMHO they're the perfect size (and quite honestly, I think the size is the appropriate portion- if you need it to be more substantial you can make it a double). The burger looked and tasted great. The fries were just meh which is why I can't give it five stars. For anyone who's anti-soda, there is a water dispenser where you can fill a cup if you don't want to pay for a soda or tea as your beverage. Because it's in Kierland Commons, be prepared to take a little longer to find parking since parking is a premium here at peak times."}
{"text":"Again, the shakes were great and the burger was good.  I just wish they were bigger for the price you pay.  I bumped a star up because management contacted me and wants to make it up to me.  That's great customer service."}
{"text":"Many people say you can't compare Shake Shack to In-N-Out.  Burger to burger, I say you can.

Taste
Beef for both are well seasoned, but In-N-Out wins for having a perfectly toasted bun.  Shake Shack's was soggy.

Presentation
Relatively comparable in terms of paper wrapping, but Shake Shack's patty was bigger.

Value
In-N-Out is about half the price of Shake Shack.

Winner - In-N-Out.  
I don't mind paying more to get better quality or taste, but it didn't seem like SS was offering me either of those things."}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday afternoon before going to Dave and Busters. The burgers are fresh! The patty is juicy. The cheese fries are amazing!!!!! I find the strawberry milkshake a little bit too sweet for me. But overall a nice experience!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad Charlotte has Shake Shack. This is my favorite. I love their delicious shack burgers, tasty fries, and yummy shakes. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Love their burgers, love their shakes, love their lemonade, LOVE their French Fries, love their speed of service.  The only thing I don't love is their price, they are expensive."}
{"text":"Nasty food very expensive...too crowded and chaotic. Pls.go out of business asap. Small stingy burgers...and hard unfresh rolls and buns....their hot dogs are garbage........4 stars though for all the nice & polite employees."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm on the strip, I long for Shake Shack!  I think the ingredients and taste is far superior than In N Out.  Everything about this meal is just so fantastic. I always order a shake shack burger with fries, and a custard.  The line, although long at times, tends to move very fast.  I never have a hard time finding seating.  The only downside is that I think the burger is a bit smaller than a burger at your average joint.  However, I guess I'll just have to order a double."}
{"text":"After hearing about the in-n-out vs shake shack debacle, I've been dying to try shake shack. I think they exist in California, but I've never seen one personally. 

I came with my family and we all either ordered the shack burger or the chick'n shack. As I wanted to fairly compare with in-n-out, I just got their regular shack burger. It was a good burger, but felt really not worth it. When it came out my burger felt small, and was kind of expensive, for what it was. My brother described the taste as \"something that you can make at home\"-- which can be good or bad. It was a solid burger, but not filling because it was on the small side. 

What I really enjoyed was the chick'n shack. My mom thought it was dry, but I personally really liked it. It was the perfect amount of crispy.

I probably would not come back to a shake shack, if I have other options. Its overpriced for what you get. The food is not bad, but not life changing either."}
{"text":"First time here. Being in downtown Summerlin I knew the place was going to have a nice atmosphere. The service was five star. The quality is what you expect at any in n out or five guys. The food was delicious but super small portions for twice as much as you would pay at a place like this. It was a great one time experience but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"First visit ever to a Shake Shack, and I simply do not get the hype over this joint.  To be fair....I live in Wisconsin and we have Culver's, so I'm accustomed to great butterburgers and custard.  I had heard a lot of good things about Shake Shack and was near it on the Strip so I tried it out.  I mean.... meh.   It's well executed, but the f you need a gluten free burger just go to In and Out and get a double double protein style.   ?"}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place since people kept comparing this place to In-N-Out. Was it worth the hype? Short answer no.

Long Answer/Review:

I do love me a good burger and this is supposedly one of the better burgers from a chain so I wanted to try it out after seeing this at the mall that I was at.

I am not sure what I was expecting when I went inside as I literally have had no experience with Shake Shack at all. It was a very clean facility and nicely decorated. There were even table games for kids, or some adult children like me. So that was a nice addition. The staff here was also very friendly and helpful.

Now for the meat...;) of the review.

I got myself a double shack burger and the buns of the burger was the best part of the burger. It was very soft and cooked nicely. What I didn't like about it was that it was a very small bun. Also the bun was only cut like 3/4 of the way through which creates a sort of bun envelope which is the first time eating a burger that way. Spoiler alert...I didn't like it. The way the contents of the burger were pushed into the buns made it seem like a big burger...until I took the burger out of the tissue paper. Making a burger this way makes it so you don't get an even bite of the contents which is unfortunate because this could have been a more delicious burger if the ingredients were able to mix together in every bite.

The fries were actually pretty decent. I have had bad experiences with crinkle cut fries in the past. These fries were not dry and nicely salted. There's not much else to say other than these were pretty good fries.

Overall this place is decent at best. Will I be coming back here? Yes, but only when I am shopping at the mall. This place is a little on the pricier side when it comes to burgers so it's not a place that I would be driving out of the way for or anything. Definitely better burger joints out there but not a bad place to be if you're looking for a quick bite to eat.

Until Next Time, Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Democrat vs. Republican. East Coast vs. West Coast Hip Hop. Larry Bird vs. Magic Johnson. Connie Francis vs. Lesley Gore. Only one side can ever be chosen among these eternal rivals--you can like and respect both, maybe even listen to or agree with the other. But you know you've chosen a side from birth, and you will forever be linked in fraternity with your chosen grouping. Thus, on my recent visit to Vegas I was thrust into the most important debate of our times: Shake Shack vs. In-N-Out.

Living in Hawaii, I do not have the luxury to regularly patronize the establishments of In-N-Out or Shake Shack. When I would visit California or Vegas in years past, it became a family tradition that the first (or one of the first) places we would eat is In-N-Out. This is due to our mutual love of their fresh vegetables and toasty buns. But when I learned we would have the opportunity to try the Empire State's favorite franchise, well, I started spreading the news to all comers and goers.

Now, unfortunately for Shake Shack there were a few intangibles that colored our experience here. One: It was about 1am having just strolled on down from the T-Mobile Arena and the #iHeartFestival and we were tired and bodies aching. Two: We were both (me at the time especially), sick with really bad throat and head colds. Three: It's dry as hell in the desert for Hawaii kids used to being moisturized by our fragrant air. So take this all with a grain of gray salt.

Being my first time, I was in full-on EYES greater than STOMACH mode and ordered The Stack Shack (a damn fried cheesy mushroom!), Shackburger with onions (to compare with In-N-Out), Chicken Stack (because we fell for its photogenic tuchus), Cheese Fries, Regular Fries, Lemonade, a 32oz Shacktoberfest beer (because I'm a sucker for a souvenir mug), a Jackpot concrete and a beer float. WHOA ALEX, did you win big at the Blackjack table? That's what my credit card asked me at any rate.

The verdict? Well, The Stack Shack is delicious. I mean, you make a mushroom patty filled with cheese, you're going to get at least my mouth's attention with that. In the head-to-head, the patty is thicker for Shake Shack, but I didn't necessarily get that out-of-body nirvana I got the first time I tried In-N-Out as a young, impressionable collegiate man. That could've been the drugs, but I'm pretty sure it was the burger. I'm sorry Chicken Stack--I don't usually prefer chicken to beef and in this case I still don't. It was okay, but nothing special. Fries were good, but I still give the nod to In-N-Out's shoestring fries. The Jackpot was damn delicious, though. It's too bad by that point we were so full, Shacksauce was leaking out of my left nostril. 

The atmosphere is very nice at this location. We chose to sat outside and it was nice to quietly eat amongst the din of Strip rabblerousers under the romantic glow of neon signs. 

Overall, Shake Shack is definitely delicious and I feel like I know what to order the next time around (definitely get a Stack Shack and a concrete). Is it better than In-N-Out? I'm not sure I can make that decision at this point in time, but I will defer that opinion to my wallet: \"In-N-Out! In-N-Out!\""}
{"text":"Lots of haters, yes. You are probably one too. I docked a star off because the price was high but once you are over that this burger is delicious. Five star delicious no doubt. Don't let the haters ruin it for you and just eat it. This specific location in the New York New York Hotel was the first to hit the west coast, but since then a few more popped up in California. There's no more exclusivity. If there's a line, then come back tomorrow. We don't need to hear nuttin about \"not worth the wait.\"

-=-Shack Stack (double if you can handle it)-=- The secret here is the mushroom patty. The mushroom patty makes the world go round. Without it, you would think it was a mediocre burger that doesn't compare to In n Out. But guess what, add that mushroom patty and you'll do an about face. It's crispy and gooey cheesy. In n Out don't have that so you can't compare. Everyone wins. I don't like anything else here. Sure get fries if you need it, but not everyone can do that $20 lunch everyday."}
{"text":"Very disappointed by a recent experience at this location.  We have eaten at this location around 6-7 times since their inception.   One of the main reasons is that they have a menu for dogs.  They even on occasion provide a bowl for our pup to drink from.  Tonight we popped in there and was immediately told \"the dog has to be outside\" it's literally 50 degrees and too cold to eat outside let alone have the dog out there.  I brought it to the staff members attention that we are frequent customers and we \"get it\" but it's cold outside and it was never a problem during the prior 6 visits.  I added it's really nice you have a dog menu but if feels like a \"colored drinking fountain mentality\" when a business wants your dog money ...but then ya gotta eat outside when it's cold ... regardless I decided to call and express my displeasure to the manager and I spoke and was met by silence.  So I called back and was sent to voicemail.  Awesome job guys, you lost a customer at this location!"}
{"text":"Tastes just like the original shake shack in NYC. The best part was that the staff was so friendly. Good atmosphere and not busy on a Tuesday night. This was a good addition to the Uptown Plaza."}
{"text":"Cheeseburger and fries were disappointing.  Shake Shack is overpriced given the portions and quality of the food.  In and Out is cheaper and better than Shake Shack.  Cheeseburger had no taste and lettuce and tomatoes served with the burger was not properly assembled."}
{"text":"The establishment is flawless. The staff is some of the nicest ever, and is the perfect cherry on top to the best food in Arizona. I have no shame in saying Shake Shack has the best cheeseburger in town. There is not a single thing I would change about their cheeseburgers. That's not even the only thing, don't even get me started on their shakes and concretes. Their shakes and concretes alone are enough to make every other ice cream place around go out of business. All in all, Shake Shack truly does offer the 3 best things any restaurant can have --friendly and perfect staff, the best shakes and concretes, and most importantly the best cheeseburgers in the state."}
{"text":"Came in to try this place again and was pleasantly suprised! I had the smoke shack which came out perfect and the burger looks as good as it taste here. Had an order of the crinkle cut fries that were crispy and perfectly salted. My fav thing here is that they have grape fanta!!!! Yes please. Plus the resturant is super clean and the cashiers was very friendly. Still the food is a little on the high end, but I guess you can see where the extra cost goes."}
{"text":"My kids love this place!!! It's pricey Babur the food is fresh, facility is nice and the line is out the door but the environment is free flowing"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and I have to admit it. I like Shake Shack better than In-N-Out. It's just love. Everything about it."}
{"text":"Solid fast food burger option in Vegas. Outside seating can get windy but was pretty comfortable. The line moves quickly because of the efficient ordering system. I got a single ShackBurger with cheese and a vanilla shake. The patty is thick and was grilled nicely. The beef tasted better than most other fast food burger joints. The bun engineering was impressive. There's a little flap on the back to keep the contents of your burger from falling out. Overall, though, the burger was bland compared to Shake Shack's more established West Coast competitor. The bun and vegetables were a little boring. Fresh ingredients are important but they aren't everything. The seasoning and sauce left something to be desired. The vanilla shake was mediocre. Again, tasted like high quality ingredients were used. The texture was excellent but the flavor was a bit disappointing. I'll try a specialty burger and a malt shake next time."}
{"text":"Cleveland's first Shake Shack! Not gonna lie, the line has been crazy long and they aren't particularly fast with getting orders out. But the food is pretty delicious. As a vegetarian, I was worried that the only option for me would be mediocre. The Shroom burger was amazing! A portobello mushroom cap stuffed with cheese, breaded and fried. So good and full of flavor! The fries were delicious as well. I didn't have a shake, but my friend said the chocolate shake was incredible. My only real complaint is the prices. The portions aren't large at all. 11 bucks for a small burger and fries is a little obnoxious. But when I feel like splurging, I'll be back."}
{"text":"The burgers are definitely delicious and so are the cheese fries (they're crinkle-cut, so they're extra crispy, and their cheese seems more like a sauce with spices rather than just cheese, which is great) but the portions are definitely too small for their prices. 

The beer float was definitely something different to try out, but I only recommend getting it if you truly like bitter stout beers. I was hoping the ice cream would sweeten the beer a little, but with no luck. It does give it an amazing texture, though."}
{"text":"Small burgers, half the order of fries were tiny pieces, inedible ,,,chicken sandwich was good as was ice cream, but very expensive, won't be back

My tiny burger was cooked the way I like it no red, my sons was too pink to eat, not consistent."}
{"text":"Not bad place for a quick bit. The line was kind of long but it moved pretty fast. I'll definitely be going there again to try more good food."}
{"text":"First Time visiting,
The Double Shack Burger and Double Smoke Shake was the bomb! Got the Double Down Fries were good. My only complaint is way too much red peppers and little cheese sauce. Other than that. Awesome price for the meal!"}
{"text":"Location: right outside of New York New York. Next to the fake bridge. 

Food: shack burger with fries 
Drink: 50/50

Wait: not too long. Even though the line was to the outside it didn't feel too long. Especially once we ordered our food came out within five minutes. 

Burger was very good. A little heavy in the flavor for me, but that could be because I was a bit full from all the drinking. Bread was soft and it tasted very cheesy (loved that). But seriously, kind of like a minor heart attack in the shape of a burger. 

Fries: omg so delicious. Just the right balance of soft on the inside and a bit crunchy on the outside. 

The 50/50 drink is like half lemonade half tea. I figured with a burger I wouldn't want something too heavy to follow it. Really light, a bit sweet and totally good. Also free refills! But you have to go up to the counter to ask for refills 

Location has indoor and outdoor seating. Big screen tvs to watch."}
{"text":"Super cute yet classy! This place is super popular in the east coast and I'm not surprised. You guys should definitely check this place out"}
{"text":"In the world of burgers I would rate this a 3 with the vast options like In-n-out, five guys, habit burger, and smash burger. Wife had the single Shake burger and I had double bacon cheddar burger along with fries and strawberry shake. The burger patties were not impressive in juicy and flavor. It reminds me of Costco bulk hamburgers. 

However, I would say the strawberry shake is better than in-n-out. Shake shack strawberry shake was not overly sweet like in-n-out.

I would say to try it if you've never been but don't expect much."}
{"text":"Visited Shake Shack shortly after the mid day lunch period and found them doing a brisk business. We were lucky to get the last available table on the patio. Staff was friendly and helpful. The line had 5 people ahead of me but moved quickly due to multiple people taking orders. Menus are available at the entrance so that you can review while in line. The double Shack Burger was juicy and tasty. All burgers are prepared medium unless you specify other wise. We requested an order of sauce on the side and found it was nothing special, not much flavor. The fries are great, not greasy or salty. There is a lot of competition in Downtown Summerlin for dining and Shake Shack is another one on the list. Glad we waited for the Summerlin site as a special trip to the strip would have been disappointing."}
{"text":"This is the most overpriced burger place I've ever been to.  Don't bring your family here unless you want to lay down a cool $50.  Everything is a-la-cart and drinks are 12 oz. for $2.30.  Stick with McDonald's folks."}
{"text":"Darn...  I should've asked for the name of the attendant who goes around asking if everything's okay and he keeps the outdoor tables welcoming for diners.  He's doing an awesome job!  Well next time I shall learn; cuz I know we'll be back to use our milkshake vouchers.

By the way gals and guys, their SmokeHouse is a burger, but they'll let you replace the burger with the crispy chicken.  I promise to try the burger at some point.  Those pictures!  Some appetizing stuff!

Just yesterday I had the crispy chicken again as a smokehouse.  I cannot get enough of the flavor!  They dice up those spicy red bell peppers and the sauce they use goes so well with everything.

Mmmm and their Portobello Burger nomzzzz!  There's no meat, by the way.  It is fried crispy - so it's pretending to be healthy vegetarian.  Don't over think it.  Vegetarians can have extra fun eating this meal.  It's ooookaaaay :)

Well the salted caramel milkshake is on the sugar high side.  Maybe let them know.  Otherwise their brownie and coffee milkshakes are awesome!  And I love when there's a bit of crunchy ice still in the blended ice cream."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always on the list of places to eat while in Vegas. Best chicken sandwich ever. Bacon cheese fries are awesome too."}
{"text":"This is my first time here, I'm from California where I grew up eating in n out burger. I can say I like this burger a lot better than most other burger joint I've been to."}
{"text":"I wish they open one in NorCal. I love it! I think it's better then chick fila. I had the typical chicken sandwich and man did it taste good!! I love the fries with bacon as well. I had the other sandwich with portobello cheese mushroom and a patty. Be careful the cheese inside is really hot and squirts. I burnt my hands and lips."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last week. The food was great and prices were actually impressively low."}
{"text":"Always 5 stars & always consistent no matter where we eat it! New York, Tokyo, Vegas, etc. I love that this location was not as busy & crowded. We got our food in about 15 mins. Parking is free & seems as if there is plenty to go around. Food is always fresh & served piping hot. If you're up for the drive off the strip I'd suggest you hit up this location. Downtown is opening a new location soon in the outlets so that will be a treat!"}
{"text":"We went 2 times in NYC, 2 times in Tokyo & 1 time in Vegas!! Happy to see this east coast gem making it west. My go to is the Shack Stack & Hubs is the Smoke Stack! Get one or the other and you'll blow your mind. The crinkle cut fries are also out of this world and are never ever soggy."}
{"text":"Good Food! Delicious shakes! Cheesy fries - need I say more! 

You have no idea how excited I was when I found out that they opened a Shake Shack in Las Vegas. I went to the one in New York when I visited last, and I dreamt about their burgers! I went here for lunch one day with my coworkers when we needed to get out of the office, and you have no idea how happy I was. The energy in there is very positive and you leave completely satisfied! 

Food - Absolutely fantastic! I had the specialty burger which had bacon and grilled onions. The meat was so tender, and it made my mouth water just looking at it. I am huge sucker for cheesy fries, so you can guess how excited I was to order those. I would have liked the fries to be a little crispier, but I will definitely ask if they can do that next time. The shake was so thick and creamy. I had the black and white (chocolate and vanilla swirl).

Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a disappointment. I came in with high expectations guess it was my fault. But the food was okay 3 stars had the smoke shake and a hot dog. Management staff does a great job of training the cashiers to up sale their product. 


Shake Shake in San Francisco is a better burger hands down!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, this place was overhyped for me. I kept hearing great reviews on this place, therefore making my expectations high. This place is very beautiful and modern with outdoor seating and water mists to keep customers cool from the scorching heat. However, my burger was also sweating oil due to the hot weather too. My burger was so greasy that the oil was seeping through the wrapper and onto my hands. I don't think it has that presentation that I was hoping for either. I like to eat with my eyes, so when I saw my burger lopsided as if it was just thrown together with no effort in presentation already made me score this restaurant on the low end of the scale. The fries were extra crispy, which I enjoyed. I also ordered a 50/50 (arnold palmer) and it tasted very diluted. Not so much tea or lemonade, just water. I think next time I'll stick to my cheeseburger and animal style fries."}
{"text":"I'm always craving Shake Shack when I visit Vegas. The lines aren't too bad and the food is consistent. Can't go wrong with a plain Shack Burger and fries. Throw in a chocolate shake...and you'll be satisfied! Be sure to take a photo with the selfie kiosk."}
{"text":"My standard of a great burger has been 5 Guys. Not anymore. And we'll worth waiting in line. Burger was the best. Great taste and cooked a jucie medium. Friys hot and crisp. This place is big, clean, and we'll staffed with friendly folks. Hope it stays that way. Lots of outdoor seating also. I'm not as thrilled with the chocolate shake. It wasn't bad just not special and being sold by a place called Shake Shack I really expected better. DQ has nothing to be concerned with. Also parking can be a real pain the the ass."}
{"text":"Such an expensive burger, but if you're offering an east coast exclusive restaurant on the west coast, expect people to line up. My friends and I got here right before peak dinner hour so the line was negligible. 

I got the SmokeShack, it was pretty good, idk if I liked the chili peppers? I really liked the bread and how flavorful the patty was. The cheese fries were alright, kinda felt like it tasted like fake cheese (like they put on nachos) but tasted less like \"fake\" cheese.

The restaurant was really clean and well-ventilated! I like the ketchup and mustard dispensers, you don't have to pump it. It's more like a ketchup and mustard faucet. Lol"}
{"text":"Located in the New York New York casino.  Burgers are made fresh to order.  Patty was juicy, tomato and lettuce was fresh, tasty sauce, bread perfectly toasted but still soft.   Ordered the cheese crinkled fries which were nice and crispy.    The restaurant gets pretty crowded but the line to place your order moves pretty quickly.   Expect to wait but worth it.  Wish they opened one in LA!"}
{"text":"Just like 5 Guys etc. Quality of burger was really good, however they forgot to add my bacon. Milk shakes pricey but good.  I would not get the fries again. They were crinkle cut, luke warm and dry. I could make better ones at home. Went around 4:45 on a Monday. Line out the door, but that's because there is not too much of an entryway. Could see this as a problem when it gets cold out. Only had to wait in line about 10 min and felt food was promptly ready."}
{"text":"I fell in love at the original in Madison Park. The Shack Stack is my favorite. The portabello Mushroom stuffed with munster cheese with the burger is just so delicious. The milk shakes are also really sweet. I can't wait for the Glendale branch to open."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Find a friend with a Platinum or Noir level M Life card and skip the line! Trust me, you'll need it during peak hours! Smoke Stack and cheesy fries please!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack I drool for you.

I've looked at the menu online plenty of times, I've visited in person and saw the smaller menu you could hold but cashiers please please let me stare at the giant wall version of the menu in store. I tell people to go ahead if there's people behind me but I always feel pressured by the cashiers yelling at me to go to them. STOP pressuring me.

With that said my favorite burger is the one with the crispy mushroom stuffed with cheese with the burger patty on top of it. The names here are confusing as all heck, they all sound the same. Shroom shack, shack attack, shack burger, shack stack, smoke shack I mean I just say burger with mushroom thing add some cheese and they get it. 

My husband and I also love the hot dog. It's $3.25 and it's just a plain hot dog but they split it in the middle, grill it and the bread is so soft and good. This isn't a fancy place but it hits your wallet like its a fancy burger spot. However my stomach is so happy leaving here that it never really minds the dent in the wallet."}
{"text":"I'm an In N Out fan but damn I would be lying if I said I didn't like Shake Shack as well. The only times I ever eat at Shake Shack are in Vegas and this location did not disappoint either. Located in Henderson, this Shake Shack is located in what seemed like a fancy outdoor shopping center. Not sure if it's still relatively new but there were no lines and definitely no wait when I went, which was awesome! 

You order at the counter, grab the buzzer, and sit and wait for your food. This particular visit I tried the bacon cheese fries, their strawberry lemonade, and a regular Shake Shack burger. The food servings look small but don't be fooled -- it's a lot. Prices are a little more expensive than your typical fast food burger chain but it makes up for it in quality. 

What's nice about this location, aside from the free parking and no wait is that it also has a shufleboard table and a fooseball table! It was a nice way to kill some time after we were done eating, but I can see it being even more popular had there been a long wait to order food. Either way, I like this location much more than the Strip. Looking forward to coming back here next time I'm in Henderson."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we loved it! Tried both the shake stack and the cheeseburger and both were exceptional. Coffee shake a must try too."}
{"text":"Not really sure what all the hype is about Shake Shack. Honeslty, it was a good burger and I made sure to try the burger with the stuffed mushroom and the fried chicken sandwich and they were both good but they definitely didn't blow my mind either. Fries were just okay too, nothing too special. The best thing I tried here was there custard, that was amazing. Other than that, it's pretty overpriced just for a decent burger, I would rather go to In-N-Out for a much cheaper and tastier burger."}
{"text":"taste good! Still prefer #innout but I would come here again. You can't compare to the west coast counterpart. The bun is a stroke of genius bc the contents doesn't fall at the end. 

The meat is a tad dry but still very delicious. The mushroom burger is one of the burgers you have to try. 

Their custard is basically ice cream. I suggest you skip that. 

Fries are fries."}
{"text":"I ordered the smoke shack burger with bacon and chopped cherry peppers on top. The meat was flavorful and the bacon was really nice and crispy. Fries came out hot and crispy. I was pretty disappointed with their special sauce. It had little to no flavor and just tasted like mayo for the most part. I also wish they did grilled onions but they don't. Overall it's a good burger but it's also a little pricey for the size burger that you get."}
{"text":"I am so thrilled to have a Shake Shack close to my home here in Henderson. Everybody knows these burgers are delicious, but what you may not know is that they have an incredible fresh baked buttered and toasted gluten free bun which is one of the best I have ever had!  Also they have one of the best apps for pre ordering I have used.  Makes order and pick up so easy and you get coupons emailed for great discounts and freebies!:) The Henderson location is always clean and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try this place since they announced they were building one here.  Everyone in NYC raves about it.   Well, it did not disappoint.  They have plenty of people there, so the service is good, friendly and fast.  The food was great.  The burgers are rather small for the price, but the quality is top notch!  The burger was great.  Wasn't a fan of the shack sauce (I ordered it on the side).  Call me old fashioned, but just give me a little mustard on the burger.  I'm glad you have to ask for onions, if you want them... everyone should do that.  LOVED the cheese fries!  They are a MUST order every time.  And I had a creamsicle float to drink (orange soda and vanilla frozen custard).  It was quite awesome!  The burger was the smaller, but it tasted the closest to Whataburger than any other place in Vegas.  Loved this place.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Shake shack has its good points and bad points but mostly good if I weren't comparing it to ya'll know where. The meat is great! Has that grilled taste that we all love and oh my god the chillies in the smokeshack burger really cut the grease and compliment the burger perfectly. However I did not like the buns as they were kind of sweet and the burger itself is really small. Also I paid like 7 dollars for it so it's definitely not worth it and a bit overhyped. However the fries are bomb. Would I come back? Maybe, but I'd rather have a burger from you know where."}
{"text":"First time making my way to the legendary Shake Shack and it had reached my expectations and passed it by far. Lots of employees to hurry the lines up, many options for whatever you're craving, lots of sitting space to accommodate everyone and games on huge tvs to enjoy as you eat. Not much else you could ask for on the strip if you ask me!"}
{"text":"Awesome! The shack burger and French fries were so good! Need to try the one in Los Angeles"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this spot!  Atmosphere was great at night!  Service was fairly quick and food was definitely yummy.  Kind of pricey, so I wouldn't eat very often but if you're looking for more of an upscale burger place then definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This was my first time being at a shake shack since I am Hoosier trash. I ordered the smoke stack and a coffee shake. My husband ordered a shack burger with cheese a Chicago dog and we split the loaded fries. My issue: the topping on the smoke shack and the loaded fries were the same and I had a cherry pepper overdose. Being from Indiana (the capital of the vomit inducing White Castle-originators of the crinkle cut fry) I am not obsessed with crinkle fries since they are common place. The burger was ok, nothing special for me. However, the coffee shake was amazing and I felt like a pretend New Yorker with an ice cream coffee product. My fiancé enjoyed his stuff a little more than I did. If a shake shack open by me would I go? Yes. Will I make a special effort when I visiting Vegas again to go? No."}
{"text":"This is a really good spot to for lunch and this food here was really good but a little over priced for what you get. The staff is not very knowledgable about the food nor beer. It's not their fault. Check them out."}
{"text":"Came here twice and both times haven't been let down. Go to for Shake Shack is their combination of the double stack with cheese fries. Just something about their cheese fries that make it so good. Though the lines can be long, it usually goes by pretty quick as well as waiting for your order. Nice spacious place with plenty of TVs around. They also have an outside sitting area in case you want to breathe the Vegas air or because there's really no seats available inside.

Besides the cheese fries, their burgers filled with lettuce, tomatoes and cheese makes it a great combination with the juicy meat. The juicy burgers make Shake Shack a great option for a quick bite if you're craving a nice hamburger. Of course, their many options of shakes provides a great add-on to the burger and fries. I've only had their peanut butter shake. It's a bit sweet, but can't really complain of how great the taste is. Wasn't too thick like other places which makes it harder to enjoy. Overall, great option and spacious place."}
{"text":"'Tis good! For a cheap and quick burger joint in Vegas, this definitely exceeds my expectations. Both their chicken burger and the beef patty burgers (Shack Burger) taste great, come out pretty quickly, and don't cost too much. 

The line goes fast, don't get intimidated. We had to catch a show next-door and only had about 45 mins, and we made it just in time after enjoying our burgers here.

The burger buns were a little soggy for me, and tasted more on the gummy side. I think if they were grilled a bit longer and were crispier, I would have enjoyed it more. 

Try out their cheesy french fries - it's  a basket of fries with melted (cheddar?) cheese on top. They give you a little wooden fork to eat the fries so your hands don't get too cheesy."}
{"text":"The environment is so cool and keeps up your mood. The service was great, didn't feel rushed at all. The food was also really great, everything was cooked great. It wasn't a long wait at all, and the food came so fast. The only reason I didn't give 5 starts is because I still prefer Fatburger haha"}
{"text":"I went back to shake shack but I went to a different location (off strip near New York, New York). The first place I tried is near red rock. Definitely go to the strip is you want an awesome experience. My food was so delicious and fresh. I enjoyed every bite."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and out of all of the burger places we've visited, this was by far the cleanest, friendliest and delicious place we've been to. The burgers are beautifully cooked, fries are crispy and soft, and they have a vegetarian option if you're not in the mood for meat! (Which, by the way is pretty good considering I love meat) 

One of the things that I loved coming into this place was that there are treats you can buy for your dog! So not only will you be satisfying your hunger but also your dogs! Haha 

Definitely wish there was a place like this back where I'm from, but I guess when I go back I'll settle for chick fil a."}
{"text":"Loved it! Until now, in n out was my favorite - but this is a close second. Tied maybe with five guys. But man every single place should serve beer with good burgers. Dee was especially entertaining serving our food - he's a gem! We maybe back back before we head home!"}
{"text":"my first time having shake shack was in los angeles a few months ago. i had ordered the shroom burger and it was pretty amazing. the cheese was oozing out of the deep fried shroom haha. my friends wanted shake shack in vegas, so we decided to come here for dinner. i ordered the smokeshack with cheese fries and i was satisfied! beef, bacon, and cheese.. so delicious. i really loved the crinkly fries with the cheese too. 

i think i would prefer in n out over shake shack because of the portion sizes and prices. if only shake shack prices weren't so expensive."}
{"text":"A must if you like a good burger and on a budget! It's cheap as far as Vegas standards. Will eat again next time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Texas for most of my life and I eat burgers and bbq like a well seasoned amateur competitor. I'd say their burger tastes on par with the small mom and pop shops. However, my shake stack (with cheese filled portabello) is a third smaller and a third more expensive than Five Guys. They must have brought their NYC prices with them. Glad I didn't get the crinkle fries. Don't they serve those in the grocer's freezer aisle and in public school cafeterias."}
{"text":"I was so thrilled when I heard that the famous Shake Shack was making its way to Vegas!  Located in New York-New York (of course), this is the place to find delicious shakes!

I had Shake Shack for the first time when I went to the real New York & although the food was decent, what got me hooked was their shakes! 

My boyfriend & I ordered:

Strawberry shake - The best ever!
Blueberry Corn Malt - I was weary of trying this because of the corn but it was surprisingly good!
(Shakes can be upgraded to a malt for an additional ¢0.50)"}
{"text":"Once again I am disappointed with Shake Shack. I was at Red Rock Casino volunteering for a breast cancer walk and the group wanted to come here once we had finished. 

My first experience with Shake Shack was at the location on the strip and it was underwhelming to say the least. I had ordered the double burger the first time around and could not fathom how anyone could enjoy paying $10+ for such a mediocre burger. 

This time around I ordered the Shack Stack Burger and I was once again disappointed. The burger came out to almost $10 and I was still fairly hungry when I left. The  \"shroom\" that they put in the burger looked like it would add a substantial amount of mass to the burger, but the moment you bit into it, it flattened and became almost non existent. Not only that, I couldn't even taste the mushroom. 

After trying two different locations of Shake Shack, I cannot justify coming here anymore. You pay high prices for mediocre burgers, that don't do much to satisfy your hunger.

Honestly, gather together a few extra dollars and go check out Bachi Burger. It is MILES ahead of shake shack for slightly more money. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come to Shake Shack for years because people kept saying that it was way better than in-n-out. I was actually pretty excited to try it out today and I must say that it was very underwhelming. I ordered the double hamburger with everything on it. I decided to add bacon for $1.55, which brought the total to $8.80. My friends' burgers ended up being slightly over $10 each. The burgers definitely had decent charred flavor, but it was nothing out of this world. 

The pros: 
- You can order beer and wine (who drinks wine with a burger??)
- The produce in the burgers are more fresh than in-n-out's
- The workers here are nice
- You can purchase overpriced treats for your dog (maybe I should put this into cons) 

The cons: 
- Burger is small... I would even categorize it as petite. After I ate here, I was still so hungry that I drove over to tacos el gordo to pick up 4 tacos.  
- The cost of my burger was as much as 2 double doubles and fries at in-n-out (this was definitely not twice the quality) 

My 2 friends and I ordered different burgers and we all came to the same conclusion... it's not worth checking out again. We would much rather go to in-n-out because it is similar quality at a significantly cheaper price point. Hell, go pay a few more bucks at Bachi Burger for something memorable. If you're in NorCal, go check out Val's burgers in Hayward, CA.... now that's a burger. 

This place is perfect for people who have never tried it and want to see what the hype is all about. Other than that, it's good for people who have the appetite of a prepubescent child."}
{"text":"Memories of the NYC version have faded so I don't have a reliable frame of reference with which to compare this burger.  But I was very impressed with my bacon cheese burger dotted with cherry peppers, though I wish I'd had the forethought to ask for it on the side so I can enjoy the cheesy, salty purity of a bacon cheeseburger.  The fries were just a'ight and didn't warrant the extra $1 for the cheesy variety.  But what made this over the top for me was the black and white shake.  Not sure what made it black and white, but it was gooo-ood!  

Our wolfpack--which, by the way, when you're in your 40s will consist of your child, your SO and your parents for portable childcare--spent $60.  This was a steal and definitely worth this paltry price tag.  The lines do get a little long but be patient as it moves fast."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries! The fries were crispy and cooked well. The burger was fresh and had excellent flavors. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype about this place and seeing the line, my boyfriend and I were excited to try it. 

Menu sounded great we choose the smoke shack burger, dog Mister and cheese fries and the shake of the week ( banana). Sounds delicious right? All for  22 bucks.... 

It was the most disappointing meal we have had our whole trip! The burger was so small and tasteless it reminds me of McDonald's kid menu burger 

The cheese fries where crinkles fries covered in nacho cheese ... Nothing special 

The hot dog was tiny and just plain. Dog bun and cheese with onion chips on top. 

And the shake had horrible presentation! This place is a shake shack and it was like ice cream in a cup 

All in all I'd rather have in n out or Wendy's"}
{"text":"I got the Shack Stack, fries, and a black&white shake for 19 dollars and some change. Everything tasted great, but don't intend on getting full from one burger/fries....BUT i will say I was satisfied. To top it all off, the black&white shake was awesome. As soon as you start drinking it, you don't want to put it down (at least that's how I felt). I would recommend the Shake to top off your meal. I will come again!"}
{"text":"You get a buzzer for your order. Food was very yummy. Shake was thick. I had an issue with an order and it was taken care of immediately. Employees were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Alway a first stop when I'm in Vegas. It's quick, tasty, and helps over spending and over eating at other places on the strip.

I like to keep it simple and order the shack burger and fries. I leave a little room for a milkshake, but never order it with my meal. Sometimes, you can't handle another thing in your stomach and don't want to waste. This time, I also order the hot dog. In general, it was like a Chicago dog. I wish the bun was a bit more toasty because it just melted on the dog making it more like a corn dog. I like spice, so I'll ask for more peppers. It was on the light side. 

Service is always quick and management makes efforts to keep. The place clean despite the heavy traffic.

Tip: Beware if over ordering. While the portions don't look generous, they are pretty filling."}
{"text":"I've never had the food at a Shake Shack, so I can only rate the shakes, but the shakes& malts at this location are just as good as the ones in New York Shake Shacks and the tables are even still made in NY, which is very cool!"}
{"text":"I love Danny Meyer and the hospitality group as a whole despite not having any affiliation to them whatsoever other than being a huge fan of their concepts and their approach to doing business.  

With that said, Shake Shack is just one of those places on my list of must eats every time I'm in a city where they are available to me. 

I would compare the food to that of In-N-Out which is also on my list is must eats when near.  I prefer the crinkle cut cheese fries here and the frozen custard is pretty delicious.

5 stars for a great, casual, fast meal in a clean and trendy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. But they were super skimpy on the cheese on the fries and our drinks were not filled to the top.... If I wanted that Much soda I would have bought a smaller size..."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to check out this place after all the hype I've been hearing. 

Located outside on the Strip at New York New York, Shake Shack is the latest addition to the already saturated 'upscale burger' scene here in Vegas. Upon walking in you are greeted by a massive menu board where you make your selection, order at the window, and pick up your food shortly thereafter. The restaurant has open seating so good luck finding a spot to grub. There is no server/waiter, but they got the orders our fast and turned tables quickly. Now don't let the ordering and seating situation fool you, the price and quality here is pretty much the same as an burger restaurant on the Strip. A burger, fries, and drink/shake will run you anywhere from $15-20. 

During my visit I tried the Smokeshack, fries and their homemade lemonade. I was surprised at the tangy flavor from the cherry peppers and the quality of the ingredients. The crinkle cut fries were thick and fresh, much better than what you get at White Castle or Cane's.  They have the option of smothering them with cheese and I recommend it! The lemonade was pretty standard but they got free refills so no issue there. 

The restaurant itself is pretty nice; as would be expected for any recent addition to the Strip. The interior has a sleek modern look to it; featuring a small lounge area where you can wait for your to-go order and sizeable dining area if you are eating in. There is plenty of outdoor patio seats available and its only gonna get better when New York New York opens its 'Central Park' area right next to SS. Overall its nice to see a place live up to the hype and worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great food! Definitely ask for Jessica because she is amazing!!! Other staff not so much. The manager on duty was rude and not willing to accommodate a request that is on their secret menu. Jessica has always been willing to honor it though! I understand if policy changes but the manager on duty was so rude about it!! 

They also wouldn't give me my drink while I was waiting because my order was to-go and they didn't want me to get a refill. Then they didn't give all the sides for the chili cheese fries i ordered- glad i checked my order before i left! I'll come back but to a different location."}
{"text":"Incredible experience and food!!! To die for food and friendly, upbeat staff. Must try chicken sandwich and hamburgers"}
{"text":"My quest for the best chain burger has been one that's lasted at the very least the five years that I've taken my foodie habit a bit more serious than most, and it's been packed with hidden gems, unwarranted hype, plot twists, and a truly ridiculous amount of time spent on airplanes. However, the past two years or so have seen one champion sit atop the burgery throne, wearing the crown that comes with the title of best burger chain restaurant. Bow down In n' Out, The Habit, Whataburger, Five Guys, and Umami, because Shake Shack, as of 2015, is your king. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Irrespective of the weather, the time of day, or how long you've been in Vegas (too long most likely), Shake Shack on the strip is nothing short of a beautiful oasis. The desserts and shakes in and of themselves are better than anything you can find elsewhere, and the burgers truly are the stuff of legend. Fortunately, these goods will come from the fast, efficient, and friendly hands of a shake shack staff that can burn through a 50 person line faster than nearly anywhere else I've been, and they'll do it with a smile on their faces. Seating? Abundant, and even if things are packed it's likely you'll be able to post up either inside or out. Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

Shake Shack could, without a doubt, slap double digit Chipotle prices on their board and still make a killing, but even in Vegas, they don't. A single SmokeShack burger? $6.70. A hefty double? Still sub $10. Fries are reasonable, shakes are reasonable - everything is reasonable, and especially since it doesn't have to be, it's a beautiful thing because it's more than likely that you're not exactly here to spend the hoards of gold that you won at the casino. Star Granted.  

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

The burgers at Shake Shack are simple, and it's that simplicity that makes nailing down what makes them so good so frustrating. Is it the fluffy but oddly flavorful bun that so wonderfully absorbs the juices of the patty and cheese? It may well be. But then wait, is it the salty but flavorful perfectly cooked patty itself that pairs so beautifully with the bacon and truly out of this world chopped cherry peppers on the SmokeShack? Is it the simplicity of the fresh lettuce, tomatos, and cheese on the standard cheeseburger that make it such that you could down three without even slowing? I honestly and truly don't know the answer, but the burgers at Shake Shack are good almost beyond description. They're everything I've mentioned and even more given the classic but tasty fries and the exotic but equally classic milkshakes that will have you finding reprieve from the oppressive heat trapped within the strip. Shake Shack is perfect. Perfect. Dual Stars Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

Without question or hesitation - Shake Shack deserves all of the love and attention that they're getting, and the Vegas location is no different. This is the best chain burger out there. Star Granted."}
{"text":"The food was ok. The restaurant is beautiful. The staff was awful. When arriving early for an online order I was told they could not go ahead and make the food, they didn't offer to go ahead and give me a drink. After watching people who arrived 15 minutes after me receive their food in under 5 minutes I clearly did not understand what the issue was with making mine early. The pump for the ketchup was broken and left a mess. When trying to show my screen to verify my order instead of shouting my number across a loud kitchen, the cashier insisted I continue to yell. Overall everything except the staff was great."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Shake Shack. 

I've tried the Shack Stack burger (fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheese .. tell me that's not heaven in your mouth), SmokeShack burger (applewood smoked bacon) and cheese fries. The patties were succulent and delicious. It is a bit pricey for their small portion, but if you haven't tried this place, it's a must!"}
{"text":"It's our third time at this location. We're from out of town and we always stay close to this area... this Shake Shack location is very clean, the staff is extremely friendly and the atmosphere at this location is just very family friendly. It's almost like it's geared for families and kids. 

This location, they definitely keep their tables clean. As soon as you get in you'll be greeted by friendly staff, they'll also recommend what to order if you are new or a first timer. We are a fan of Shake Shack and this location always gives us a pleasant experience. It's def our go to place every time we're in the area."}
{"text":"One of the closest fast food spots next to the T-Mobile Arena. This was the first thing we saw after the John Mayer concert and we were lucky enough to catch the line early.

Being from the West, we are fiercely loyal In-N-Out eaters. However, Shake Shack can't be beat. The quality of the food, the variety, and the ambiance just can't be beat.

Our food was hot and fresh, flavorful, and filling. I have dreams about this place, man. If we could get one in Salt Lake I'm pretty sure that my insurance premium would go up.

Try this place when in Vegas, ESPECIALLY if you don't have one where you're from. Or maybe not- because then you'll know what you're missing out on."}
{"text":"A lot of hype was surrounding this place once it came into Vegas. People said their burgers were super good, and it made me very curious. I eventually made my way there. I noticed a selling point of this place is that their beef is raised without hormones or antibiotics and that alone can draw in a certain kind of crowd, but for myself, it doesn't make a difference. They do have a selection of hot dogs, shakes, and frozen custards available as well if you want to add some flavor to your meal. Each time I have visited, I have gotten the hamburger with fries. To be honest, the food is more expensive than other fast food places, and you don't necessarily get more for your dollar either. Their burgers taste just like any other hamburger and their fries are crinkle fries that don't have anything really special about them. The hype around it was not backed up by their food or price at all. It's definitely always worth trying a place once, but these places aren't guaranteed a second visit unless there is a reason to go back. Shake Shack unfortunately has not given me a reason to go back, but definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"So happy with this location in the The District. This has been open a little over a month now and is serving reliably good burgers. We love the Shack Stack and Smokeshack for the unique flavors. Definitely more inventive and delicious than any other burger chain. Don't forget to try their dessert... shakes and concretes complete the wonderful meal. Bonus - this location has a foosball table!"}
{"text":"We've been fans of Shake Shack long before it opened in Las Vegas. This is probably our 5th time here since it opened in town. I always go for either the Shack Stack or Smoke Shack. Flavors are novel and so inventive. IMHO this trumps the other popular West coast-based burger chain with cult following. Also love the Black and White shake and Shack Attack concrete. 

So it is with mixed feelings that I have to put out a word of caution. Two members of our group had symptoms of food poisoning (upset stomach and more). The only thing they ate which was different from the rest is the Black and White shake. I hope this is just a fluke. They recovered in a day or two. 

If you're driving in and not staying in any of the hotels, best place to park is NY NY self parking with entrance on Tropicana Ave. Walk into hotel through casino floor and head towards the strip."}
{"text":"My first time at a shakeshack:-) good food, good experience. 

We came around 10ish on a Thursday night. Not too many people. I saw a lot of pics and already knew I wanted the shack stack. With cheese fries. 

The shack stack was a burger with a huge fried mushroom stuffed w cheese that oozes out after the first bite. It was really good. The cheesefries was good too. The cheese wasn't overwhelming, nor was it underwhelming. 

I like that they have ketchup and mustard easily dispensable. They have mayo too but you don't need it.

For dessert I had the concrete w cookie dough. I tried the toffee and thought the toffee mix was a lot better."}
{"text":"The burger was good and so was the shake. The fries were more like you would get at Dairy Queen and very disappointing at this price point. I wouldn't drive across town but might walk across the street to eat here."}
{"text":"After a disappointing wicked spoon experience, shake shack picked me up again. Even my extremely picky bf said this is good. Better than in n out and we are from Bay Area. Cheese fries, shack burger, smoke house were all really really good. Yum! Wish we had one in cali. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My son dragged me here even though we just finished lunch an hour before. He's from NY and said It wasn't too be missed. I only had frozen custard and it was delicious. (Okay, I also stole some of the fried onions off his burger when his back was turned.) I give them high marks for fresh, tasty burgers, frozen custard, and beer but they lose a star for being a bit too pretentious. I wouldn't be bragging on using reclaimed wood for tables, etc if they haul it all the way across the country!"}
{"text":"It was good, but very over hyped.

I was expecting a lot more from this place. Looking at all the reviews, I was anticipating an awesome burger that would make me want to ditch In n Out for good. That was not the case. We got the shack burgers and the shack stack, which were all pretty tasty, but small. For $9.49, I was expecting the Shack Stack to be enormous, but it was smaller than a regular fast food burger. The fries were nothing special, and the cheese fries were ok too. 

Also, it's located on the strip so there's bound to be drunk people and reckless clubbers out. We sat next to the photo taking thing, and there was a huge crowd of obnoxious people yelling and climbing on each others back right next to our food. Thankfully none of them landed in our food.

Overall, the competition between In n Out and Shake Shack is hardly a competition. In n Out is still the reigning champ in my heart."}
{"text":"Great place for all!  The burgers are delicious!  They also offer fried or grilled chicken sandwiches.  Easy menu, tasty food, great atmosphere.  For the grand opening the line moves fast, the staff is friendly, it's clean and has plenty of seating!  Love a place that also serves beer with our burgers!  Will be a regular!"}
{"text":"This has got to be my favorite burger of all time!! Unfortunately I have only been able to get them once a year when I go back to New York and wait in line for an hour, so needless to say I'm ecstatic I can get one with only a 3.5 hour drive!"}
{"text":"Okay Ben, you've won me over! After my last review, I received two burger coupons and a fry coupon to compensate for our experience on our first visit to Shake Shack. We decided to use them tonight and we had a great experience. My husband got the BBQ burger...I think it was the ShakeMeister? His burger came first and by the time mine came, his was more than halfway gone so I think it's safe to say he enjoyed it. I got a cheeseburger with no lettuce or tomato and it was juicy and cooked perfectly. The fries were cooked well. My husband said crinkle fries remind him of elementary school cafeteria food...after he ate a few he said \"Okay, they cook these a little better than the cafeteria lady\" lol. Our service was great and we were checked on multiple times while we ate. And the good news is, there were no flies and the restaurant was much cleaner. Thanks again, Ben! You made believers out of us. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I recently went to the new location in Las Vegas. 
It's located in area around New York New York. During New Years it was a beautifully decorated. 
Anyway, super busy! I think I waited about 15 minutes in line. Considering the long line, it moved fairly quick. 
I ordered the chicken sandwich, a drink and regular fries. After ordering I waited less than 5 minutes for my food. Pretty darn fast! 
The sandwich was delish. I've had the hamburger before but I much prefer the chicken sandwich. 
Unfortunately I have yet to try a milk shake but that's because I'm lactose. (Sad face)
Overall, great meal and the location was nice."}
{"text":"This was my first time in Vegas and I've heard great things about this restaurant so I decided to try it. I was not disappointed at all. The shakes were amazing!! I had a caramel shake and the caramel was very prominent. Sometimes you have a certain flavor shake and u can't really taste the flavor, but not with these shakes. Everyone that was with me enjoyed there burgers as well. The fries were also delicious."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place tonight. The food is pretty good, I had a burger and fries and liked both of them. But, a few hours after eating I got sick, and it's pretty obvious that I now have food poisoning. I'm usually hesitant about pointing the finger when it comes to food poisoning, but my boyfriend looked up the reviews and noticed two other customers already mentioned undercooked food and people getting sick. I think it's safe to say something isn't up to par here and the food is making customers sick.

***Update***

My boyfriend was so pissed about me getting sick that he started researching Shake Shack and found quite a few disturbing articles related to food poisoning, including this one:

http://seekingalpha.com/article/3147046-could-this-be-shake-shacks-worst-nightmare

The article explains that Shack cooks their burgers to medium versus well done, which greatly increases the risk of spreading food-borne illnesses to consumers. I'm not saying that Shack doesn't obey all laws and regulations, but I do believe this is why myself and so many others are getting sick, and it's something people should know before deciding to eat there."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and fries. I can't say it makes sense to wait in a +45 minute line to pay 3x more than you would at In-N-Out. But if you're stuck on the strip and are looking for an affordable burger, this is a nice option. 

I hope they work out the kinks of the seating. Tables were so scarce, you had a situation where some of the party would squat at a table, while the rest was waiting in line. This created the problem of people with food not being able to sit while people without food were camped out at a table. They need some kind of coordinator to help with traffic control. Just a thought."}
{"text":"Ahhh love this place!! Some of the best faster pace to eat on the strip but not just a little store. I come here anytime I'm down there...which unfortunately isn't often being a local but still. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"FINALLY! A Shake Shack on the West Coast; even better, Las Vegas!!!  

When i visited the east coast, one of the things I was going to miss was the Shack stack from Shake Shack!  I no longer have to stare at my past shack shack photos and drool!

My Opinion: Dont expect to compare this place to in and out.  There is no comparison.  They are 2 completely diff. types of burgers & atmospheres.   They are both equally delicious in their own way.  As in and out is known for their sauce, shake shack is known for their deep fried portobellos stuffed mushroom burger (you can either get it with or without a beef patty). 

This Las Vegas location is spacious and nice!  Bigger than the shake shack locations I've been to in New York.  Of course its placed in New York New York... go figure! Perfect!"}
{"text":"This shake shack is much better than those in Chicago or Baltimore. The meat tastes just right not too salty. we also tried the chicken sandwich. Some raves about it but I am not a big fan."}
{"text":"Value-for-the$? There is none. That's the ONLY disappointment for me. 

My teen and I walked in and eyed the menu board, as this was our first time. His choice was the cheeseburger, which just goes without saying. I got the chicken sandwich and their take on a Chicago-dog. I got him a 'large' soda at $2.80, and splurged on the cold-brew iced-coffee for me at $4.55. I can't recall the food costs, but with no fries nor shakes....total of $24.85. 

His burger was sized akin to a single at In-N-Out, but certainly tasted better. However, the chicken sandwich was clearly the taste-winner here, we both agreed. Thankfully, it was also a bit larger than his tiny burger. The dog was well-prepped, with all fixin's in the right proportions so as not to overwhelm the link. But again, this was a pup, not a dog, LOL. The drinks were, perhaps, 12oz, at best. No worries for my bladder, here. 

We rolled through the McD's on the way home, and got a value double-cheese and a spicy-chicken, because we were still hungry. That sums-it-up nicely."}
{"text":"It was okay...I had it also when I was in New York and the taste is the same. Their burgers are very bland in my opinion. I even added mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard and it still lacked flavor. I also tried their Chicken Shack Sandwich and it was so salty. I can only taste the tartar sauce and pickles. The cheeseburger was $5.29 and the chicken sandwich was $6.29. Not for me folks."}
{"text":"Long lines but they move very quickly. Great alternative to spending $75 on a meal in Vegas. High energy, fun atmosphere and good food. Burgers are pretty small, I probably would've got a double if I'd seen them before ordering. Overall great experience, I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack is one of those places where I've always wanted to try. Come on, it's a New York staple! I've had their custard and I'm quite impressed. I hail from the land of dairy and cheese, so I love the creamy and density of the apple pie custard. 

I like this location as it's situationed toward the end of the south strip, near the Park, and seating is usually available indoors or out where you may people watch or look at the street glitter at night. Lunch or in the afternoon is simply way too packed and lines are too long for my patience. 

For a fast food joint, it's quite on the pricey side. We ordered a burger to share. I wasn't hungry but wanted a bite or two of burger just so I can write a review. Husband order a burger with bacon, no fries, and a drink. When our order came, I was disappointed. The burger was smallish. For $6-7, I was expecting more.

That \"more\" came from the flavor of the bun. The meat, bacon, tomato, and lettuce is just like all other burger joints but the herby bun is what stood out. It was delicious and greasy. Not worth going through the long line for another other priced burger but definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"One of the best fast food burgers I have had; better than In and Out, maybe even better than Five Guys. 

The burgers were a bit expensive, but it was worth it. What I like about Shake Shack burgers is that they use a sweet toasty bun and the meat itself was very flavorful and juicy. The size of the burger wasn't overly large or small, just right. 

I would definitely return to Shake Shack again when in Vegas, and try the other items they have."}
{"text":"After day of shopping today we stopped at Shake Shack for some needed snacks.  Their shake shack burger was okay but we like In and Out burgers much better. Although I did enjoy their hamburger buns, they seem to be steamed. Their Shakecago hot dog and half-half drink was delicious. I only gave 3 stars due to their okay burger and average fries.  And some items were really expensive. I haven't tried their shakes so we might go back for them."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. First time there told the cashier it was was first time and she basically sat there looking at me like I was stupid. Awful customer service. The wait wasn't too bad and I enjoyed sitting outside to eat. 

The hamburger patties were unseasoned...not sure if that was intentional and aside from the small amount of dressing, it was incredibly small. The drinks, were kiddie size so plan on multiple trips for refills if you are thirsty. Bottom line...should have took the trip to In&Out."}
{"text":"The line that was serviced in 5 minutes to a friendly face at the counter..... Good start......Food in under 15 minutes and the best part... They were GOOD .... As well chicken sandwich gets Rave reviews... Naturally had to get the special treat for my 4 legged fur family....cheese fries with order... Ok i like different cheese... Very trendy type atmosphere.. Only one complaint i ordered a double smoke stack. Got a double burger instead with a single smoke... I will call that my fault as the order was repeated to me... Way better than the name brand up the street.   See my Wahlburger review... Better price better food but alas it is on the strip and i choose not to be on the strip as a local that often.....locals may want to try Summerlin as of course the strip would be a parking nightmare... I valet at NY NY...."}
{"text":"I have been going to Shake Shack at Kierland since they opened, and it's very consistently good. I love their hotdogs, so I usually order two hotdogs instead of a dog and fries. I am not a huge fry fan, and somewhat surprisingly, there are actually fewer calories in the two dogs. 
If you like root beer and have not tried their root beer on tap , definitely give it a try! It's amazing! 
The other thing at Shake Shack that is consistently good is the customer service. Everyone who works there is friendly and helpful and wants to make sure that you have everything you need. A manager is always present, and will stop by your table to make sure that you are happy.
There's even a ping pong table outside to entertain the kids, and on Saturday nights in the spring and summer Kierland has free concerts in the plaza right outside, and Shake Shack's patio is the perfect place to enjoy a meal while listening to some good tunes."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places I have ever eaten a burger at! Sam the cashier was so much fun, and helpful, and got our crazy order on the spot! Even suggesting off the menu combos that rocked our world!!! The place was clean, and comfortable and the quiet - could not have asked for a better burger or place to get one!"}
{"text":"The food here is the same as the ones in New York. The burgers are tasty and they have some beers and wines along with soft drinks to was down your food with. If you are craving a burger, you could do worse."}
{"text":"Fast and clean environment. Came during lunch and wasn't too busy. Loved the strawberry mint lemonade"}
{"text":"So after a night of getting my ass kicked at the gaming tables I needed a sure thing. What better than a burger, fries and chocolate shake combo? Right?

Well I'm standing in a line of about 40 people and in comes a guy from the Walking Dead. He is pale and sweating profusely even though it was very cool in the store. He fidgets and moans and I know something is wrong. After moving about 10 spaces in 15 minutes I could tell something bad was going to happen. 

All of a sudden, he makes a run for the door. I could tell he was in a panic and when he approached the double glass door he unloaded a technicolor yawn. People were shocked at stench of this mans' vomit.  Needless to say, you had 40 people who lost their appetites and walked out to other exit. It is one of those experiences that will prevent me from ever returning to a Shake Shack regardless of how good they may be."}
{"text":"Tried their fries and it was pretty good . Many condiments choices. If u don't like spicy food. U can tell them to put the pepper on the side"}
{"text":"When it comes to fast food, few places are on the same level as Shake Shack. This one of a kind restaurant offers excellent burgers and a unique fast food dinning experience unlike most traditional fast food joints. 

The Shack Stack tops my list of favorite items on the menu. The fried portobello mushroom adds an incredible edge to an already good burger.  I likely won't be able to get myself to try anything else on the menu after having already experienced the Shack Stack. It's too good 

The shakes/concretes are not bad. They definitely don't stand out quite like the Shack Stack but taste great with a burger and fries.

Shake Shack's restaurants are excellent places to dine in. Unlike most fast food establishments, SS offers a fun, upbeat atmosphere with up-to-date design features that add to the experience. Unique architecture, modern design and well thought out logistics make things all the better. Large tv's are located throughout the place and Customers are given a vibrating device to let them know when their order is ready - much better than trying to listen for your number to be called. 

Strongly recommend for someone looking for a top-notch fast food experience"}
{"text":"So where I'm from, we don't have a Shake Shack. So being that we were in Vegas, and there is a Shake Shack here, we put it on our list of \"must try's.\" 

I love a good burger, and I have to admit...I was a bit underwhelmed after having a Shake Shack burger. First let me say, the burger and fries were good. It just wasn't what I was expecting considering what everyone was telling me about their burgers. 

I ordered the Shack stack which is a Shack cheeseburger with a fried breaded portobello mushroom. My wife and son had the Shack burger with cheese. We also ordered fries and a shake. My wife loved the shake. The fries were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Again, I want to emphasize that the burgers were good. I was just expecting more. I would still definitely eat at a shake shack again, but I don't think I would list it as one of my favorites."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a client. This a good burgers place. The loaded fries for were great, burgers are little small. Overall if you're looking for a good lunch the shake shack is it."}
{"text":"Shake shack is delicious.   The only other fast food burgers I truly enjoy are Fatburger and In N Out.  This definitely is as good as those.  Everything from the burgers to the concretes are excellent. Only downside is the line, but it moves relatively fast."}
{"text":"I'm also confused as to why this place is getting bombarded with negative reviews. I was vising a friend in West Hollywood and he took me to a Shake Shack near him. I'd never tried it before. I thought the food was delicious. This is not a fine dining establishment. It's almost like restaurant quality food with fast food delivery times. This location did not disappoint me at all. 

To me this isn't something I'd tell anyone to put on their bucket list. It isn't that \"one of a kind\" joint where you can only get this \"one special food item\". If you're close by I don't think anyone would be upset if someone recommended this place for lunch. Is it worth crossing State Lines to eat? Probably not..it's a burger joint lol. Anyways I try to set my expectations with the type of establishment. This place is very good for what it is."}
{"text":"The burgers were pretty good! I ordered the \"shack stack\" for $9.59. Pretty pricy for my liking but it definitely was good. I also ordered a salted caramel shake for $5.75 which is a little too sweet, even for a sweet tooth. 
I liked the atmosphere of the place, there's not much going and it's pretty simple and straight forward. I would give this place a 6/10 for overall experience. It's nothing too crazy or it's not really something that I would go out of my way to eat."}
{"text":"I ordered the smoke shack burger with cheese fries. The burger was okay, nothing to great. Although I loved the cheese on the fries. I also had a red velvet shake it was delicious. Cool place to eat outside while waiting on the apple stores Genius Bar to fix my phone"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come to Shake Shack for the longest time. This burger joint first started in New York in 2004, and spread to other East coast locations, and I was happy to find out they recently started opening on the West coast. Unfortunately, the only locations they have in California are all in SoCal. When they will open one in the Bay Area? I hope they open one in San Francisco someday. But as for right now, I will have to stop by when visiting LA. When looking for places to eat, I was ecstatic to see a Shake Shack on the Vegas Strip! It's near the NY NY hotel.

I came here around early lunch, and there was already a long line near the door, and tables were almost occupied. I ordered the Shackburger which is the standard cheeseburger, and as simple as it sounded, it was quite a delicious burger! This is not the typical burger you get from In N Out (sorry if you're a fan) but the burger had a thicker, juicier meat. I also tried their crinkle fries drizzled in cheese, and the regular kind. But for future visits, I'll stick to good ol' regular fries.

For dessert, I settled for the Shake Attack which is a chocolate custard ice cream with chocolate and cookie dough chunks. Which was a great, sweet treat, which was the perfect end to my meal.

Happen to have a burger craving and have a Shake Shack nearby? Don't hesitate to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Small size burgers for the price I paid. We had the chicken shack, shack stack, double shack burger, 2 shakes and a order of fries for $43. The best part of the order were the shakes."}
{"text":"So I was excited to try this place when my friend, Ryan told me it's one of the popular burger joints in NY. Finally tried it out, I got the single shack burger. Honestly, it was okay, not the best. It has the \"shack sauce\" but I couldn't tell the difference. The sauce just didn't taste any different from burgers I've had. Now, in n out spread or McDonald's Big Mac sauce, you'll know what they are which is what I was hoping for from shake shack.

I'm not a burger person either, so a burger really has to be that good and stand out for me to say \"it's awesome\"! This place is just okay, but I'm willing to give it a second chance!"}
{"text":"Yummy burger and french fries. Shakes and custard were heavenly. Very friendly service and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"I still can't get over how lousy their cheese fries were.
It almost makes me depressed just thinking about it.
For the first time in my life I considered making an appointment with a psychiatrist.
DurIng my downtime late at night I went through my friends list and pondered unfriending anyone that wrote positively about them. 

I would describe the cheese fries this way: think of a bag of frozen fries at the grocery store, warm them up in the microwave a bit so they're soggy and not crispy, and throw on some melted cheese that they use on nachos at Little League and AYSO snack stands.

Ok, now that I got that off my chest, I think I can move on with my life.

Usually an opening with that much negatively would lead to a 1 or 2 star review, but to be fair I will rate Shake Shack as a whole:

+1 star for the spaciousness of their layout and overall presentation
+1 for the outdoor seating facing The Strip 
+1 for their custard window: I could see myself returning just for this
+1 for their burgers: read everyone else's reviews 
+1 for the variety of their hot dog options: hello chicken apple sausage
+1 for the drinks: shakes and beer, and a beer float
-3 stars for the cheese fries

After my meal, I returned to my hotel room and sat in the shower crying."}
{"text":"My East Coast friends swear by this place, so I had to at least give it a try. 

My friend and I ordered their Shake Stack Burger, the most special part is the portobello mushroom, and regular fries. With the hype of this place burdening my mind I thought that this place was just A-OK. Don't get me wrong their burgers were tasteful (the mushroom was a very nice addition) and not too shabby at all; but I don't know if it's the West Coast side of me that will always love the taste of In-n-Out more. However, I did like that the burger felt toastier and 'softer' which was nice. The review on fries are that they are crinkly fries which is a nice change from our regular skinny/steak/curly fries but still ... just fries. I tried my friends cheese fries and I definitely thought that the cheese they used could've been cheesier both oozing texture wise, to the taste to intrigue my palate more.  

This place is rumored to be packed to the point where the line will be out the door, luckily I have been blessed to have missed that crowd and to order within 10-15 minutes of my arrival. So be prepared to have the possibility of waiting. There is a large amount of seating and the dining room is lovely with the sun peaking through."}
{"text":"We knew it would be busy here to we came here around 2 pm in July 3rd. There was a line still out the door however it moved fast. Thank God b/c it was over 100 degrees outside. 

Since it is so popular here it was difficult to find a table to sit inside. Got lucky when we found a table in front of the giant tv screen. I'm taking one star off my review for the lack of tables even at off times. 

The food was awesome!  The crinkled fries are the best!  They also have beer selections as well."}
{"text":"Super yummy burgers and the cheese fries are sick in the best way every glad they opened one so close"}
{"text":"Super yummy burgers went again with some friends from work great people watching burger and cheese fries and oh yeah beer"}
{"text":"Just as good as the New York location! It never disappoints. Always crowded, but there's a reason why. In order to get a table, you have to be like a vulture and circle around your potential victim."}
{"text":"Nice burger joint right under New York New York.  They had a wide selection of shakes and desserts too, but i didnt partake.

After a hungover fiasco, i stumbled in to get some nutrients back on my system.  the burger hit the spot.  I had the shackburger and the fries.  the fries were pretty good, but the burger was amazing.  i would say it has a lot to do with the bun.  its soft and fresh and incredible.  burger was nicely cooked, and the veggies and sauce went well with it.  i haven't had it enough to compare to another \"nice\" fast food burger place, but it looks like it could be up there.  i wont mention the competition, but you know what I'm talking about.  

If you are around and are looking for a decent quick bite, go for it!"}
{"text":"Been here twice in the last two weeks and not my absolute favorite, but not too bad! I might not be the best person to review this place since I don't eat meat, but the other stuff was worth reviewing I'd say! 
The service is good and the atmosphere is nice. It is clean in there too which wins points with me. The first time I went I got the 'shroom burger, which is a fried mushroom stuffed with cheese on a sandwich. It was ok, but not great. I thought I'd like it a lot, but it was just meh, I don't think I'd get it again unless I didn't have a choice haha. I got the French fries which I greatly enjoyed! Crinkle cut fries are yummy, these don't disappoint. The shake on the other hand did disappoint. I love chocolate ice cream, I never get shakes but decided to try one today and the chocolate shake was not enjoyable for me. I'm sure other people would like it, but for me it just seemed too chocolatey which sounds ridiculous haha but it was! But I tried the salted caramel shake and enjoyed it. I'd be down to return and try a different shake.
I think this places deserves more like three and a half stars, there's stuff I really liked but the food and shakes weren't quite as good as I had anticipated. I'd come back though!"}
{"text":"Consistently good across the nation! I have too many good memories of Shake Shack from my time living in NYC - waiting in line from the Times Square location, upper east side, LaGuardia airport, Madison Square Park... so it was so nice to be able to get the same burger in Arizona! 

The cheeseburger has high quality meat, the Smoke Shack has awesome bacon in it, but my fav is always the Stack Shack which is the cheeseburger plus fried portobello mushroom! The fried portobello surprisingly has cheese inside the batter, so the cheese would flow out of the fried mushroom and melt in your mouth with the cheese burger. Heaven! 

We only waited for less than 10mins in line and there were seats available right away at around 7pm on a Saturday night. Good treat after a movie! 

We were too full to have the frozen custard. I usually get the coffee or vanilla flavor! Highly recommend! Don't think about calories and just enjoy."}
{"text":"Killer burgers, crunchy crinkle fries, epic shakes. Long lines and bit of wait. But when your food is this good to be expected.  Fancy burger chefs places don't compare."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  We tried Shake Shack on the strip a week ago and it was phenomenal.  So we went last night (9/23/16) to the downtown Summerlin location and it was like a totally different burger. It was burnt to a crisp, and not even close to the same experience as the other location. Will not return."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town!  They could charge more since they're on the strip but they don't.  Try the original shack burger!"}
{"text":"Love the custard at this place. My first exposure was in Central Park in New York City. This is a little more modern looking and also very much cooler inside thanks to the wonders of air conditioning."}
{"text":"Shake Shack has been hailed as the east coast answer to In 'n Out. Given that both offer burgers that are about the same size with thin patties, and both compete as higher quality alternatives, against the mega burger chains in the fast food world, I'd say that's a pretty good claim. 

So, let's pretend that the In 'n Out Double Double, and the Double Shake Shack burger are the same price. The In 'n Out Double Double is the better burger, but not by much. The Shake Shack Double is as fresh, and is cooked correctly to order with consistency. One thing I really liked were the cherry peppers. Every burger needs a distinctive touch, and the cherry peppers are that distinctive touch for Shake Shack. In 'n Out wins because their beef is tastier, and the beef should be the star of the burger, right? In addition, In 'n Out fries are better too (not that In 'n Out makes great fries, I just think krinkle fries suck), and so is the lemonade. Speed and quality of service is better at In 'n Out as well, but Shake Shack's speed and service was good. Probably not fair to compare, as Shake Shack is working with a much larger menu. Where Shake Shack really shines is in their menu variety. They have much more to offer than In 'n Out in every facet from burgers to drinks and desserts. Their menu is definitely more creative as well. Fortunately, I got to sample several items, as I was with a large party, and everything was good.

So, let's come out of the pretend world and face the reality that bother burgers are not the same price. The Double Shake Shack burger is $7.00 (at least at the Las Vegas location), while the In 'n Out Double Double is $3.75 (for you east coasters that have yet to try In 'n Out... no I am not kidding!). Sorry, but at $7.00, the Double Shake Shack Burger (and neither is the $6.00 single) is not a standout in the ever evolving world of competitive fast food burgers, and certainly nowhere near the value of In 'n Out's burgers. Simply put, while Shake Shack makes a good burger, In 'n Out offers a better burger at almost half the price. End of debate.

I was tempted to give Shake Shack 4 stars because of it's variety of menu items and over all good quality, but I can't. Why? Well besides the burgers being way overpriced, the fries were just average at best. Burgers and fries are the heart and soul menu items of any burger joint. I just can't see anything more than 3 stars for a burger joint that has okay fries and overpriced burgers. If they they lowered their burger prices by 25% or made great fries like say 5 Guys, then I could see 4 stars."}
{"text":"Shake Shack was amazing. One of the best burgers I've ever had. Everything was fresh, the fries were also good, and the strawberry shake was delicious and creamy.

The burgers have \"shack sauce\" which was good, but because they give you your burgers at an angle/slightly vertical, all of the sauce went to the back of the burger. Even so, the burger was amazing and I would gladly go to a location closer to where I live, if that existed."}
{"text":"Overall prices of individual items add up expensive hamburgers and shakes food quality is good and very busy at this Las Vegas location. Felt like cattle waiting for the food."}
{"text":"East coast burger joint meets west coast consumer! It's the next big thing to in and out burger!!!! Omg deliciousness ...;)"}
{"text":"Amazing! Food was great and Allison went out of her way to make sure we enjoyed our food, definitely recommend (Shake Sauce is A M A Z I N G)"}
{"text":"Even though it's a little pricey, the staff is helpful and friendly! It's kept very clean and is very upscale in design! My sister and I loved the water pressure and temperature of the sink in the ladies  room (not usually something people comment on lol) the food was great, I suggested to a waiter/ customer guide that they add a pineapple ring to the shroom shack stack burger lol it would be amazing!

I hate lemonade but after sampling it I got a large with a refill!  Refills are free!

I usually eat a lot and thought the burger wasn't going to fill me but it's been a couple hours since I ate and I'm still full!

I got cheesy fries but I suggest the bacon ones my mom got SOO much better lol and I didn't get a dessert but they looked really good!

I would say the thing I loved most was the wonderful Suprise of seeing the fresh water bowls for dogs out side on the front patio!

I can't wait to go back with my Romeo (Family Dog) and buy him a bag of biscuits!"}
{"text":"After finding out that New York's Shake Shack rivals with California's In-N-Out, I knew I had to try it! How can any burger joint rival with California's MIGHTY In-N-Out?!?!?! Just how?!?! That's impossible, I thought. 

But HOLY CRAP, after the first bite into my Shake Shack's burger, I got confused and I felt like I CHEATED on my beloved In-N-Out because I must confess that I like my meat to show a  little pink. 

Unlike In-N-Out, Shake Shack's patties are a little pinkish and a little rare and that makes the patty taste juicer and therefore more delicious tasting! 

The only downside to the Shake Shack burger is the price, it definitely cost more than In-N-Out but I'll pay more for better quality meat.

So far, I've tried their Shake Burger with double meat, Smoke Shack Burger with double meat, Shake-cago Dog and their crinkle cheese fries and I love their burgers the best! The pink meat in the burger makes a HUGE difference! The fries complimented the burgers really well.  

Ohhhh yeah!! I'll definitely make a stop at Shake Shack when I'm in New York or Las Vegas again!"}
{"text":"I would totally give this place a 5 for the food, but its the prices that got to me. Almost $6 for a very small, unfulfilling burger and then $4 for some fries with cheese whiz?(ok so the cheese fries are pretty amazeballs). And the concretes were tasty, but again, tiny portions and leaves you wanting more. 

I hate to be that person who makes the In&Out reference BUT you get waaayyy more bang for less buck! If I wanted to pay that much, I could go to smash burger and get WAY more food."}
{"text":"Sweet lord do I love this place.  Being from nyc - I was stoked when they started opening here in phx.  The burgers are the best!  In and Out is overrated when you put them side by side.  I recommend EVERYTHING on the menu! I literally get fully aroused every time a cheese covered crinkle cut fry touches my lips."}
{"text":"Did not blow my mind like I thought it might after reading all these review. I guess if I was drunk while eating here I would be way more  impressed. I tried the smoke shack, a bacon cheese burger with peppers. It was good but not great. I also got the cheese fries. The fries were really good but the cheese was meh. I got the kids some hotdogs and they really liked them. I did not try any shakes or specialty items. Be prepared to sit outside because there is very limited indoor seating and it is very busy. Enjoy that burger in 110 deg. Heat!"}
{"text":"Better than In & Out!


OK. As a  Southern California native it's tough to admit this...but there is no comparison! 

We walked up to a menu that was full of options unlike In & Out..what can I say I like options..even better is they have hot dogs on the menu which my two year old loved so much we had to order another one! 


The buns they used are bar none the best! So soft and moist! Here are the main reasons why this place is better I had Bacon and Onion Strings on my burger!! My two favorite items! There is no competition! In& Out its your turn to step it up!"}
{"text":"It seems that everytime I come to Vegas, I try to make a stop here. The burgers here are always great and tasty. They are not fancy,  but simple.  It goes along with the cheese fries I normally get. Its definitely a must try for burger lovers!"}
{"text":"Best of the fast food burger places. Totally satisfying. Secret sauce is special. The fries are the crinkle cut and good."}
{"text":"I've had shake shack in NY and this is nothing like the one in NY!! I was afraid this would happen...Just like Earl's of sandwich in Anaheim, CA tastes nowhere as good as the location in Vegas. Saturday night and the line wasn't too bad. Good thing 'cause it isn't worth hours of waiting for this place. 

I like that their menu is simple so you're not bombarded w/ a bunch of choices, but it's not as simple as In N Out. 

Shack Stack - Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce. I wanted grilled onions instead of regular onions, but they couldn't do that so I settled for adding crispy onions ($1 extra). They're basically the same onions as the Smoke Shack burger. The only thing similar to the original NY shake shack are the buns. The buns are pillowy soft and toasted nicely. Somewhat similar to hawaiian bun texture, but w/out the sweetness! The patty could've used more flavor for sure, but the portabello mushroom oozing w/ cheese was good! I was smart this time and waited for it to cool a bit so the cheese wouldn't burn my mouth lol

I was debating custard or concrete and they ran out of their flavor of the week for the custard so I decided to get the concrete. 

All Shook Up Concrete - Vanilla custard w/ banana PB cheesecake and chocolate toffee. It sounded good, but wasn't worth the price nor cals. In case you're wondering, the concrete is basically like a Mc Flurry, it's a thick frozen yogurt/ice cream type consistency. The single was pretty small, I would say save your $ and go to Sprinkles at the LINQ Plaza for ice cream.

There are better burger places, do yourself a favor and go get Holstein's! Or In N Out if you want"}
{"text":"This is my sons first visit to shake shack. I love the façade and décor of this place. Their burgers are very fresh and delicious with no fancy trimmings just good old fashioned burger. Yes it's pricey but you can taste the quality in the ingredients. Their shakes are also very good. This is my first time trying concrete, the ice cream is good but it had too much candy for my liking. I'll have to ask them to put less next time. Fries are okay.

{"text":"Everything about shake shack is amazing. The food, workers, oh and they even have their own beer which is a delicious pale ale. Although it is a bit pricey it is worth it because they use high end ingredients in all their food items. You wouldn't go to a high end steakhouse and expect to pay Denny's prices would you? I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a great burger and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere and clean. The place was pretty full but the food was prepared rather quickly. 
The staff was friendly and attentive. The burgers and fries were average, nothing to spectacular about the food. The fries were good and the cheese fries had just the right amount of cheese on top. Just your typical burger and fries joint. There wasn't anything that would set them apart unlike Tommy's in Los Angeles or In and Out. I don't think it was worth the price. I ordered two Shack Stacks, fries, cheese fries and a large root beer. Came out to a little over $32. Would I eat here again, probably not. It's not that the food was bad I just don't think it's worth the money they are asking."}
{"text":"just ok. very expensive. 5 guys is better and cheaper.  milkshakes just ok at best. equal to in and out, but three times the price. would not go back"}
{"text":"Delicious! Shack burger and fries were both amazing! Fast service and fresh food, will be back when in the area!"}
{"text":"I'll buy into the hype.  For the price, especially on the LV strip, the price for a decent lunch here is nice and cheap.  For about 6 dollars, you can get yourself a decent fast food burger.  So the burning question is, is it better than in-n-out?  The meat is certainly better (juicier), but I think the overall pacakge of in-n-out is better in terms of bread, ingredients, and sauce (not to mention price).  

However, the hype is real.  Get yourself a decent burger and fries meal at Shake Shack for ~$12 on the strip.  And if you're craving craft beer, they have that too.

4 stars."}
{"text":"The SmokeShack burger is amazing! The beef was just juicy and perfect. Put some fries on it, and bam perfect burger. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the West, Shake Shack!  I've been to the original one in New York a couple years ago, so when I heard Shake Shack was opening in Vegas, I knew I had to stop by during my Vegas trip last January.

We headed straight to NYNY after the Super Bowl.  I was expecting a long line, but when we got there, there was only about 10 people in front of us.  You could see they had the rope out the door as the line gets pretty long during peak hours/weekends. 

I made the mistake of not trying the Shack Stack when I was in NY.  I was going to get it this time. It's a cheeseburger with a fried portobello mushroom filled with melted cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato, and their yummy ShackSauce.  The verdict? Heaven!  My boyfriend took the second bite and steaming cheese oozed out and burnt his tongue lol.  And of course we had to get a side of their crinkle cheese fries

It is a bit pricey for burgers.  $7-$10 for a burger, and that doesn't include fries and a drink.  Still worth it, though!  And this place is pretty popular for its frozen custard shakes as well. They also sell hot dogs, beer and wine, and dog treats!

As said in my Shake Shack NY review, I can't really compare this place to In N Out.  Both are unconditionally delicious.  I still love both equally the same!"}
{"text":"THANK YOU FOR SHAKE SHACK!  I missed Shake Shack twice - once in New York (when we hadn't heard of it yet) and another time in Boston (when we stumbled upon it JUST after we finished eating).  When I heard Shack Shake had opened up in Las Vegas a couple weeks before my trip, I knew I had to try!  Thank the jesus I did because it was pretty dang good.  I ordered the 'shroom burger for myself and when I had my first bite I couldn't put it down and I didn't wanna share. 

I didn't have any expectations but what it would be like, but I much prefer veggie burgers over meat most of the time so I knew I was ordering it.  It was pretty amaze.

The patty consisted of a Portobello mushroom stuffed with white gooey cheese and then DEEP FRIED. It gives it an amazing breaded crunchy texture.  It's lovely with the other fresh ingredients - like lettuce and tomato.  The bun is really fitting too.  Nice and soft but not too soft.

I tried a bite of the smoke shack burger my husband had.  It was pretty good with a nice bite of jalapeno, but I much preferred mine over his.  We also got three things of fries to share between five people.  Two cheese and one regular.  I liked the cheese but the fries are really good on their own that you can just eat with ketchup.  I would skip the cheese next time and save my dollar for a slot machine.

I love you shroom burger.  You get my 5/5."}
{"text":"Simple menu with amazing flavors. 100% grass fed angus beef that's full of flavor and in a soft and savory bun. Fries are freshly cooked and don't forget to ask for their very own sauce for dipping. Summerlin location is very convenient with amazing staff"}
{"text":"I'll start off by giving props to the presentation and customer service. But I was highly disappointed in the quality of food I received for the price I paid. My pink lemonade was disgusting. Which I'm open to giving it a second try for benefit of the doubt, but never the less was not at all enjoyable. My rather expensive, yet surprisingly small burger, although great presentation, lacked flavor. And as for the crinkle fries, let's just say Culver's has them beat. Overall, I'm very disappointed in the taste of the food I purchased."}
{"text":"Finally got the try Shake Shack. Before, I thought I had to go to New York for this, so I'm glad they have one here. 

Let's just say their burgers and fries are indeed good. But I'm a Californian, and I love In-N-Out. The sauce that In-N-Out uses is something that can't be replicated. The Shake Shack Burgers do not have that same sauce that I like, but it is still good in its own way. 

Definitely not something I will eat everyday but worth trying if you're here."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Shake Shack was just alright for me.  The East Coast burger did not WOW me. 

Lots of tables throughout and quick service. 

Order your food at the counter and have a seat.  
The burger I had was just alright.  I've had better.  I also ordered a hot dog and that too was just alright.  Lastly, I had the vanilla custard and meh I've had better."}
{"text":"Was on vacation this past week in Vegas and this was one of the first places we ate at...it was good and flavorful..was expecting the burger to be bigger than what it was for the price but overall it was good..the peanut butter shake is what saved this review..that shake was the BOMB!"}
{"text":"The food is good. 
Hamburger is kind of crispy and juicy.
But to pay $16 for 1 meal of hamburger, small fries and a small drink is a lot . Any other hamburger place charge max of $9."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Shake Shack after hearing about their reputation, but have to say I was very let down and it was nothing like everything I've heard. Service was good ordered the chicken sandwich and fries. Chicken was very dark in color almost seemed burnt or over cooked. Very little flavor and a little dry. Fries were hot but nothing special. Definitely not worth the $10 paid for lunch. Probably not going to try again, can spend half that and get better food somewhere else."}
{"text":"Everyone agreed that it was a good burger, I thought it was the best I've ever had. I got the double hamburger with added bacon fully loaded. It was juicy and crispy around the patty's edges. Perfectly paired with the strawberry lemonade and cheese fries. Too bad they didn't have ranch to dip the fries in. Went a few days ago, not sure if the A/C is still broken. Definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to soak up all the alcohol you've had in Vegas, this is a good option. 

Service was fast and I was ordered their regular shack cheese burger, and their cheese fries with bacon. 

It came out to about 14 USD with a soft drink, not sure if the prices are on par with other shake snacks not on the strip. 

Food came out in about five minutes and looked like the picture (unlike another chain starting with M). 

The burger was on the smaller side, but fresh and not greasy. The pickles were crisp, and the vegetables fresh. 

The fries were definitely decadent and delicious. The cheese is more of a processed nacho cheese. But hey I wasn't complaining.

Didn't get a chance to order a shake, because well I just thought that'd be a bit too much...next time I would just order plain fries or split the cheese fries. 

Also, I did notice they had a veggie burger but that was mixed with cheese-so if you're vegan or dairy free. Probably not your best option."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a trip to Las Vegas because we heard the burgers were a must try. The taste and quality of the burgers were good. It is a tasty burger, however for the price you pay the size leaves a little to be desired. Way over priced!!!!! I come from an In N Out world where we get more burger for half the price and we're always looking for a good burger. Too bad this place just didnt measure up to the hype."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - The Cars - Shake It Up)

Uh well, Yelp all night, eat all day
Don't let the Shake Shack get away
Eat all night, keep the bun
Won't you order bout two servings

Shake it up
Shake it up, oo
Shake it up
Shake it up



I wasn't much of a believer, but I had to try and see what the buzz was all about.

Needless to say, I'm pretty impressed with the Shake Shack franchise and how they've done.  Food wise, I just ordered their regular burger with fries on the side for my first round ever.  I'm thinking what makes these burgers are the butter buns; soft with every bite and melts away on your palates!  The burger itself is cooked to perfection and just the way I ordered it.  I was very impressed since it's like a fast food chain popping out burgers through a line, but with enough care and attention to make it a burger to remember!  The fries were crinkle and cooked to a good crispy bite.  I'm not a fan of crinkle fries; weird since it's just the shape.  I've heard about of their shakes, but man my belly and love handles said NO!  Maybe next time when I want to splurge a bit!  -  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I used to live in NYC and waited for an hour or so at Madison square park to try shake shack.   It was nice to show my husband what the big deal is without the wait.  We got a cheeseburger shakestack fries and black and white shake.   It was pretty good.  It's not the best burger in the world but it's a upgrade to fast food.  And it's pretty freekin good.  Depends on if you want a fancy burger or not.  The. Shake was pretty awesome.   The fries were quite good too."}
{"text":"It's a frigging fried portobello mushroom with cheese melting inside, accompanied with the usual tomato, lettuce, and buns. So how the hell can it taste so good?!? 

Disclaimer: we were surviving on only one meal/ day due to EDC weekend, so I guess all food tastes good at that point. But I would definitely go again. The $$$ isn't so great though!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place but was disappointed. It is way overpriced for the size and quality of the food. I'd compare it to a school cafeteria lunch.

Staff are friendly and wait time wasn't bad so there's your two stars, but I was craving more when I left. What a let down."}
{"text":"I was anticipating the opening of this location due to the fact that I had been wanting to try it and also I dread going to the strip. Everything I have had has been so good. The burger was delicious; but my favorite item is the spicy chicken. I hope they never get rid of it! The fries are always cooked perfectly. I tried the concrete custard that has peanut butter sauce. OMG is all I have to say. I ate the WHOLE thing and I never finish my ice cream. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"4 stars because I was hungry and food was decent but in and out is better. The bun is sweet and the lettuce is crisp. But the meat and the shakw shack sauce wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Long line... like always. Burgers were really good, but a bit small. I'm a petite girl and even I was pretty hungry after eating mine.
Not bad if you are just moseying around and want to have a snack before the night starts."}
{"text":"OMG the best simple cheeseburger ever! Can you please open a location in LA?! It was the perfect ending to my short weekend Vegas trip with the boyfriend. We both agreed the cheeseburger, cheese fries, and the peanut butter banana frozen custard was amazing! Everything is so damn good!!! The pricing on everything is fairly reasonable too. There was a line but it moves fast, your order at the counter, pick it up on the side, and find an open seat somewhere. There are plenty of seats inside & outside. How fitting to open at the New York, New York hotel & casino. GAH! I am already craving for one already... my boyfriend joke about ordering one for the road... lol. Anyways, SO GOOD and the hype don't lie! Get your cheeseburger here if your in VEGAS! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is really good I like the patties and cheese fries but my friend said all their food is good. The tables were clean inside a little dirty outside."}
{"text":"Shake Shack offers a pretty tasty burger, the Smoke Shack to be exact, with the perfect amount of sweet and salty (thanks to a little cherry peppers and bacon), but I can't help but feel that it's a tad bit overpriced. I'm sure rent is high in the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall, but I'm pretty sure they charge the same at all their locations. The quality is about that of the Habit, but the cost of a burger at a nice sit-down restaurant. Very clean and modern fast-casual restaurant in appearance."}
{"text":"Personally I do not think this place is better than in n out like people rave. The burgers are tiny and there isn't a special taste to them. Not worth the line or dime."}
{"text":"Shake shack was pretty good for being a spot so iconic in the east coast. The restaurant looks really modern and brand new. Location and aesthetics are on point.

The food here is pretty good but it is a little overpriced. My friend and I spent 33$ on two burgers, two shakes, and a side of fries. Being from Cali, I could have gotten a lot more at In N Out. 

Overall, the food and vibes are good but I would rather spend that 33$ somewhere else. For a one time experience, you will have a good time! 

4/5"}
{"text":"Over rated.  Cheese fries are plain friend with a side of movie theater cold cheese sauce.   Burgers are decent but for the price in n out wins by far."}
{"text":"OMG, the best burger I ever had! In n Out, The Habit, Five Guys, ain't got nothing on this place. Literally melted in my mouth. Burgers are a bit on the small side so double up! Beef is tender and juicy. The cheese fries are equally good. I wanted to kick my self in the ass for agreeing to share my meal in an attempt to not to be such a fatty. Will return again, wish they had more locations on the west coast. OXOX"}
{"text":"I, too, have to join the chorus of, \"people get excited about this?\" Yelpers. The burgers and fries are fine but, if any part of the meal steals the show, it's the shakes. Unfortunately, it's hard to get past the sticker shock that comes with dining at Shake Shack. Item-by-item, you can't help but feel gouged by an undersized standard-fare burger and a slighted serving of crinkle fries. 

Prices aside, it's fine. The establishment is clean and the staff is friendly. But in terms of value, 2-stars feels about as inflated as their menu prices."}
{"text":"I like this place. ..the food is pretty good...I always order the chicken sandwich and cheesy fries...I stopped eating beef but those burgers sure look good. ..I might have to try one and then I will stop again. ..lol
The employees are really nice too...great smiles and very friendly"}
{"text":"First visit to a Shake Shack. Loved it. Line went quickly and employees were friendly and helpful. Got the Shack Stack with cheese fries. So good! A burger topped with a giant, deep fried, cheese-stuffed mushroom cap? Yes, please!! Just a great burger. 

Food that's hot, fresh and delicious, great service, clean place, and decent prices. Can't wait to go back and try dessert. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"The burger was great. The fries were even better. There are barely enough words in English to say how wonderful the chocolate shake was. Needless to say, I highly recommend Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Shake Shack has opened in Las Vegas with a bang. I have been a huge fan for years, and since moving to Vegas from the East Coast I couldn't be happier to see it in Sin City. 

I went the first weekend it opened, and the line was VERY long for being 5 p.m. on a Sunday night. It was all hands on deck--tons of staff members were working in the kitchen and working the dining room floor.

Here's how it works at Shake Shack: You get in line, place your order, get your buzzer and wait for your buzzer to ring. Try to get a spot at one of the tables while you wait. Then you pick up your tray at the counter.

All of their burgers are bomb--my favorite is the Smoke Shack with bacon and little bits of spicy pickled peppers. Vegetarians will be happy with their portabello burger, which is stuffed with cheese and then fried. So decadent. Their cheese fries are AMAZING--don't think about the calories, just indulge. They recently switched back to their crinkle cut fries, which aren't \"fresh-cut\" but have that nostalgia factor.

I am a personal fan of Shake Shack's hot dogs--their Shack-cago dogs are freaking amazing.

During this visit, one of the staff members saw that it was my friend's birthday and offered to bring her a frozen custard of her choice. When they brought it out a bunch of staff came out and surrounded our table, and then one worker started singing Happy Birthday. She had a fantastic voice!

The only thing I would suggest is that they extend their late night hours. Plenty of people would love to do their drunk eating at the Shack! ;)"}
{"text":"I ventured out to try the Shake Shack! Glad I did. I heard mixed reviews so I decided to try it for myself. Luckily the line was short and the service was fast. However they got my shake order wrong but once I saw it on my receipt the error was corrected before I got my order. I ordered the smoke shack burger, fries and a mocha cookies and cream shake. The burger was delicious, moist flavorful and the peppers added the right amount of kick with the shack sauce . Portion size could have been bigger but with the shake and fries I was pleasantly full. I don't like crinkle fries sooooo not moved by them, fresh cut fries would set this combo off. But that Shake???? May just be one of the best I've ever had. It was so thick and filled with cookie I had to take the straw out a couple of times to keep drinking(eating) it. Definitely was not happy about $15.17 bill for one person but I enjoyed my food and would return."}
{"text":"One star, this place is extremely hyped! 
Pulled up thinking I was going to have an amazing meal. The food was so damn salty. I mean sodium levels were off the charts! For $20 I would expect an amazing burger and fries with no flaws. 
The east coast can have shake shack back!"}
{"text":"Whenever there's hype around a fast food place... I get skeptical so I was keeping my expectations low on this one.  So we got there around lunchtime and I was pretty hungry because I had skipped breakfast that morning.  I ordered the The Smokeshack which had peppers and bacon some fries and a concrete thing called the Shack Attack.

The burger was ok.  Nothing special.  I read some of the other 5 star reviews and everyone seems to compare it to In N Out so I too will compare it to In N Out.  I personally think the burgers at In N Out are better.  The burger that I got at Shake Shack was very underwhelming.  It was tiny for the price and the patty just wasnt all that.  

The fries were fries.  I love the fact that they were crinkle cut fries, but flavor wise, nothing special.  I still think the fries at Mcdonalds is the absolute best and if you think my review is tainted because of that comment, SCREW YOU!  Just kidding =)

Lastly, the concrete thing I ordered.  It was called the Shack Attack and it contained the following:

Chocolate custard, fudge sauce, chocolate truffle cookie dough and Mast Brothers Shake Shack dark chocolate chunks, topped with chocolate sprinkles'

Sounds good right?  It was ok.  The problem was that it was already melting by the time my buzzer went off.

I was so disappointed with this place that I went to Secret Pizza, ordered 2 slices and inhaled it.

Anyways, totally over-rated in my opinion, but to each their own."}
{"text":"Definitely not a better burger than In N Out, in which In N Out is still king. Its a highly refined burger which melts in your mouth. It doesn't have a signature taste that makes you want to come back for more. We all expected more and that doesn't even account for the price based on strictly taste alone. Got the Shack stack burger with cheese fries."}
{"text":"I'm just going to say, go to this location and not the one at NYNY on the strip. 

My first experience, too greasy, ugh. This time around, much much MUCH better.

This night, I got the Shack Stack, which is the Shack and the Shroom Burger together. I have small hands, so the burger, width-wise, is not big. However it was stacked high because the mushroom is thick.

For drinks, my husband got a rootbeer and a chocolate frozen custard shake. We're silly sometimes, so I took a big slurp of the shake and while my mouth was still full, backed it up with rootbeer. Yes, it was good. But, I recommend probably just going with the Float option.

Let me just end this review with, be nice. Just be a good person and thank the servers that come by to ask how you're doing, if you need anything else, or come to pick up your plates. Compliment them on the food and their service (if you should experience these things). Because if you do, they just might have an extra free custard cone card for you that you can use the next time you go. I can tell you, not everyone got one that night."}
{"text":"Came to try this place before heading back to LA. 

The burgers and fries are good.. But definitely not worth the price. 

We prefer In n Out more.

We know this is a fast food restaurant, therefore tips are usually not given. But I never thought their service here be so rude. I will not speak about everyone just our cashier who helped us take the order. Lynn was super rude and pretentious. Couldn't even be bothered to acknowledge what we ordered, just looked at us and gave us a bitch face look. No smile or even a thank you. We sorry if you had or having a bad day, but at least try to do your part as cashier.  

Overall experience? Bleh.."}
{"text":"So good! Organic burgers. They're pretty small in size but absolutely delicious. The vanilla milk shake was okay. Strawberry lemonade had a hint of mint.. yes, mint . It was good though. A little pricey but worth it. $35 for two fries, 2 milk shakes and 2 burgers."}
{"text":"I went to SS at an off time to avoid the long lines.  It still took awhile to get our burgers. They were fresh and had good flavor and I really liked the potato bun.
Unfortunately we could not try the fries because they cook their chicken in the same frier.  I also sample the vanilla shack , good flavor but a bit pricey.
The space is large and they have a nice patio.  I will go back hopefully they get a second frier so I can have GF fries."}
{"text":"Good tasting burger, but I left unsatisfied. Very small for the price. I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's a long line.. Expect to wait. So we went to just ordered their Blizzard type. It's pretty good!!! Definitely we will try to get here and eat here and try their special burger"}
{"text":"Hip, trendy and the food is very tasty.  It's a little pricey (almost 15 dollars for a burger fries and and Diet Coke).  Not bad for a once in a while joint."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a burger. They aren't cheap but they are tasty. The seating is modern and they have a nice outside area. Watch out for the lunch and dinner rush."}
{"text":"As burger joints go it was very average.  The line did move fast and the service was good.  The portions are kinda small. The burger was tasty but not out of this world. The fries are crispy. I tried the chocolate malt and was not impressed.  Overall the price of $16 for a single burger small fry and reg shake seems high for fast food."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place for quite awhile and remember when the founder Danny was excited about putting it together. It's funny but it felt so good to be treated like a human on the Las Vegas strip. Really fair prices, very good food and the staff really enjoyed each other. Big fan!!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to resist writing a long review, but I could go on and on about how many notes this place played on my foodie heart.  After a week of the strip going into place after place that took our money (alot of it) and returned a little food and alot of \"it was ok...\" from our family. This place was a delight. It's the little things that count in the end. And the team, the staff, the \"family\" behind the counter and working the line REALLY liked each other - that is SO rare.  High, high marks SS. Love you guys!"}
{"text":"My east coast burger-lovin' friends always rave about this place -- I've been privy to plenty of aerial instagram pics of crinkly fries pornographically smothered in cheese alongside half-exposed burgers in all their glory.

So naturally, when Vegas was bestowed with a Shake Shack on the strip, I was curious to see just what the hype was about.

First impression: there's a giant menu to greet you when you walk in. As a first-timer, this is useful. The interior has that modern wood/sleek metal combination look. The layout was bigger than I what I was expecting. When we went, late-night on a Thursday, there was plenty of seating available. 

I opted for the standard: the single Shackburger with some crinkly fries. It was good. It reminded me a lot of In-N-Out, but at double the price. I guess this is where you'd go if you feelin' fancy. The crinkly fries were plumper and better than say, Raising Cane's. So I'll give them that.

Maybe I'll come back to try their shakes next time (since it IS called the SHAKE shack), maybe another burger or a chance on the hot dog, but for now, it wasn't really anything special for me...at least I can upload my very own aerial food picture now, though."}
{"text":"I'm a former Californian who moved to Dallas and had to wait for years for In n Out to come to Texas. Now the burger rage is all about the New York Shake Shack outlets. Shake Shack opened up a restaurant in New York New York on the Las Vegas strip. I saw the long lines during peak times so I figured getting there at 11:00 am would beat the crowds. Well there was still a small line but it disapated as soon as they opened.
I ordered the Double meat Double cheese, fries and a drink. It's about double the price as In n Out. The crinkle fries are crisp and tasty.  The burger was fantastic. The quality of the beef tastes like a prime steak house burger. The toppings weren't overwhelming.
The bun was light and flavorful.
Now I rotate between In n Out and Shake Shack when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"My first time here!

I'm a California native so I've heard the comparisons to In-n-out and I have to say that the two are not comparable. They're so different that I don't think they can be compared.

Shake Shack was great!
I got the Shack Stack which included a cheeseburger and the portabello mushroom patty. I was so surprised that the mushroom patty had so much cheese in it! But it made it delicious! :p

The location is very fitting since it is located in the New York New York hotel on the Strip.
Super cute! Would come again!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food isn't terrible. However, it is WAY overpriced for what you get. We spent $38 today on 3 cheeseburgers, 2 drinks and a small fry. The size of the burger that you get was insulting. Especially for around $7. It reminded me of a White Castle slider. Seriously you could go a few streets down to a mcdonalds and get the same size burger for $1!"}
{"text":"I have such mixed experiences that I took the middle road.   The service has ranged from disinterested and slow to very pleasant and slow.  Sometimes - VERY VERY slow.  I don't really get why there will be four employees having a social conversation at the same time tables need to be wiped down and clients are waiting for over 20 minutes for a burger and fries.  This is consistent across DC locations (Dupont Circle, Gallery Place, 14th Street or Tysons Mall).  Slow.  If the food weren't so tasty - I would never return. But if the service were more timely and friendly - I would probably be tempted to visit more frequently."}
{"text":"Can we just take a moment and appreciate the fact that CLT now have a shake shack- yesss. I've never had shake shack, and hearing all the hype I was super duper ecstatic to try it. Also since I don't eat red meat, I was happy to hear that they have a vegetarian burger option! When we arrive, there was literally no parking and the line was super long even after a week it had open AND the fact that this was a Tuesday. Notta problem because it moved fairly quickly. I ordered the mushroom burger, crinkle cut fries & shack sauce of coursee! The mushroom had cheese oozing out of it when you take a bite, yumm. I've never been a fan of crinkle cut fries but I gotta say it was pretty good! They were perfectly crispy. Shack sauce, hm it was alright nothing compared to in and out sauce (hehe)  also I recommend ordering the pie & icecream it was really yummy!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and shakes, however, In n Out is still better. Shake Shack's food is certainly better, but it's much more expensive than In n Out. For paying $20 at In n Out for a good family meal, I'll pay $45 here. Shake Shack's shakes are phenomenal. Probably one of the best I've ever had. This place has a great atmosphere with TV's and the enormous amount of young people. However, this place does get very crowded around the 3 main feeding times. I would not wait in a  20 minute line for this food."}
{"text":"Walked in excited to try some things on the menu. Ordered a chocolate shake and a shack attack. Waited 30 mins for a melted shack attack and chocolate shake. Went up to ask the guy how much longer and he replied with \"whenever it gets in front of me\" I don't think it takes over 30 mins to make those items. Wasn't busy. Super disappointed. Not coming back ever."}
{"text":"This visit probably was quite surprising, it was just a run of the mill type of place and simple menu.  But ordered mushroom burger, a chocolate shake with whipped cream and fries with cheese and bacon. Not only did it come out fresh it was really, nothing at all was burnt and the cheese didn't like dry up fast it was warm an gooey the entire time. 

I really loved the shrooms burger it was better then anticipated. 

Will come again"}
{"text":"Mmmmm, shake shack! 

Shroom burger is pretty good, the mushroom is so thick and it's filled with cheese too (and fried). 

Chicken shack was disappointing because the first time I tried it, it was super juicy and not overly fried. This time it was super breaded and fried, and the chicken was dry. It was a let down. 

Shack stack was great, I would say the best you can order. It's a meat patty with the shroom burger patty (fried portobello with cheese). It's filling and so good. 

Black and white shake was also so tasty! It's not overly sweet. It's a vanilla shake with fudge mixed in. A perfect blend of chocolate and vanilla.

Fries were really crispy and tasty."}
{"text":"The \"East Coast\" of In N Out... would I agree? Not quite sure if I can compare the two burger joints.

In N Out:
1. Fast, very fast food
2. More fresh ingredients
3. Lighter
4. Super affordable

Shake Shack:
1. Not-so-fast fast food
2. More gourmet
3. Heavier
4. Pricier

Shake Shack is more dine-in whereas In N Out (for me at least) is more of a drive-thru option. Shake Shack has more complex flavors and options, which obviously to some people may \"taste better\" since flavors are elevated. If you're looking for a simple, fresh, and cost-effective burger, then In N Out is for you! If you're looking for a once-a-week treat, go head to Shack Shack. 

Both are good, but it all comes down to what kind of burger you're looking for. Shack Shack gives more options - beer, desserts... both delicious.

If you're looking for something unique, try the Shack Stack. Your taste buds will experience the euphoria of melted choose oozing out of the layers of the burger. Worth to pay a visit if you're here (instead of going all the way to NY!)"}
{"text":"Have you ever eaten a burger that whistled? Mine did. At Shake Shack.

I was indecisive over which of their five burgers that I wanted to try, so I opted for the Shack Stack: combination of the 'Shroom Burger and Cheeseburger. One bite into that deep fried 'shroom, and I swear, it let out some kind of a whistle-sigh. Gooey, cheesy goodness then overflowed out and plopped onto my tray. *Homer Simpson drool* 

Here's the burger bummer: all that cheese did take away from the ability to taste the burger patty. Next time around, I might select either Shack Burger or 'Shroom Burger. Unsure if I'd do both again, but dang, I just can't shake off my cravings for the Shack Stack! 

Also devoured was a single scoop vanilla custard ice cream on a cone, which wasn't enough for me. A double scoop might've been the way to go. In addition to standard vanilla and chocolate offerings, there's also a flavor of the week that can be found on the back of their menu. 

Prices are reasonable. The Shack Stack is the most costly burger on the menu, costing over $9. Their golden, crunchy crinkle fries are an additional cost. For being situated on The Strip inside the NYNY, the food is a bargain.

No complaints about the service. Quick, efficient, helpful, and amiable. 

Plan to come with other people if you dine here. Patrons are constantly coming and going, so seats are limited -- seat stalk, but don't be a weirdo about it. There aren't purse hooks on the high tables -- WTF, really? Be prepared to cradle your baggage, or take the chance of leaving your stuff on the table for someone to jack while you're stuffing your face. When the weather permits, it's great to dine outside and people watch -- that is, if you don't mind seeing the occasional rolling advertisements for escorts, but that's just a typical Vegas day on The Strip.

Shake Shack's a decent burger spot, especially for visitors and those who work nearby. On the other hand, being a local and living and working on the other end of town, I would only return if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Shake shack just (well, kind of...) opened up in Charlotte and I had to try it! I'm a fan of the original locations in NYC, so I wanted to see how Charlotte stacked up. In short: Charlotte Shake Shack makes a great burger (especially compared to the burger competition nearby), but it can't beat other Shake Shack locations.

I got a burger and their signature fries. The burger was okay: the patty was a little dry, but it was hot and everything worked well together. The brioche-style bun was great, too. The real star here was the fries, though. They're crinkle fries just the way I like them- crispy on the outside and softer in the middle! With some extra crispy ones throughout, of course. 

The vibe in Shake Shack is great. I think families could definitely come here (lots of booths!), and it would be perfect for watching a game too- lots of big TVs. Overall, SS was so close to being a new staple in my book, but I think I'll be hesitant coming back (though those fries were delicious)."}
{"text":"This place is overrated. Bang Bang burgers is way better and I would have to say Five Guys is as well. Not worth the wait. The food was good but not as good as the hype."}
{"text":"Two stars since it was edible. The burger was much much smaller then I expected for the price and didn't taste very fresh. The fries are also pretty basic and nothing special.  I ordered the shake as well which was also pretty small.  The shake was melted to the point were it tasted like thick vanilla milk.  I am glad we tried it but we won't be back.  Poor value for the cost."}
{"text":"Had an interesting experience at this location.. I wanted to take my SO here as he's never had Shake Shack before. I've been to the one in NY and remember them mostly for their featured lemonade rather than the food. I wanted his opinion on the infamous debate of in-n-out vs. shake shack. 

Mind you, we had a rough night that spilled into the morning.. I mean it's Vegas.. lol. We get to the register and it's not busy at all. We're looking at the menu trying to decide what to get and I suggest the Cheese Fries but he doesn't give a yes or no answer.. He just kept perusing the menu and as he's looking, the girl at the register makes a comment, \"hey she wants cheese fries, if she asks for it, it means you should get it..\" OR something along those lines.. She didn't say it in a rude way or anything but it was just bad timing and the joke didn't resonate to the SO.. I get that she was trying to connect but it just wasn't going to happen no matter what she said.. 

The SO wasn't feeling it so he stormed out.. He felt it was rude for her to make that comment and also felt he couldn't read the menu in peace. So I continue to order the food and follow him outside.. He was very upset about how the register lady treated him and refused to go back inside.. Although I didn't agree with his perspective of what happened, I have to respect his feelings so I went back to request a refund. I didn't even have to explain the situation, just the fact that the SO was dissatisfied with the service, they not only refund the money, but they gave us extra fries as an apology. I rated them high just for that..

I subtracted a star because I do agree that the comment made was unnecessary, the seasonal lemonade wasn't as good as the one I had in NY and because In-n-Out does win the taste test overall in the end."}
{"text":"I agree with those reviewers who found the menu prices on the expensive side.  It's not just that, however.  Given the prices, the portions are small compared to what you usually get at a restaurant serving comparable food.  There were two of us ordering and our total bill came to $26.  That's for two hamburgers, one order of fries, and two shakes.  The burgers resembled sliders, they were that small, and the shakes looked like we had accidentally ordered from the kids menu.  As for taste, Red Robin has them beat, and I'm sure I could think of others if I thought for a bit.  We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I have heard for a couple months that they were opening up a Shake Shack in Las Vegas at New York New York.  To my surprise, it had opened and my fiancee and I happened to be in Vegas that week for New Year's.  We weren't sure where it was actually located in the hotel because we tried using the map kiosk at the hotel and it just wasn't working for us.  So we walked outside, because I saw on some pictures posted it had an outside storefront.  So we walked around the outside of hotel, we found it!  I'll save you the trouble of having to walk outside in either the cold or the heat... in the casino walk towards the Swatch store use that exit to go outside.  There is also a casino exit you can use also which is closer.

Apparently, the day were went was opening day!  When we arrived, I was expecting a line out the door.  I have been to the NYC location in Battery Park and we waited in line for 30 mins.  And with it being their opening day the line could have been hitting the street.  We didn't have to wait too long there were in line less than 10 mins before we were able to order.

We ordered a double Shackburger, ShackMeister Dog, Cheese Fries, and a Black and White Shake (chocolate and vanilla).  The whole thing cost over $20.  We were looking for a table to sit, luckily two women were leaving and offered their table.  They give you a buzzer to let you know your food is ready.

The look of everything look almost the same as I remembered from the original but it has been a while since I've had it.  The food had good flavor but was on the salty side for our taste.  Would I call the best burger on the West Coast?  That can be debatable.  

On value, I think In-n-Out is better based on what you get for the price.  If you're simple, the flavor maybe too salty for your taste.  I liked the fact there wasn't extra bun with no meat at the end, many time I get that when we eat burgers.  This is a good sign the portions of bun to patty is perfect.  The location is better than the one in Battery Park, reasons being there is inside sitting and you don't have to deal with the NYC pigeons trying to steal your food!

I would want to come here again to try their other burgers and other items on the menu.  This was their opening week so like many other eatery you have to work out some kinks to get it right at a new location."}
{"text":"I went to Shake Shack two days in a row. I really like their shakes, although their service is inconsistent. The first time, the server was extremely nice. She offered to let me try a sample of a 3-flavor shake to see if I'd like it--I did. The combination of chocolate, caramel and strawberry was delicious, if a bit too sweet (but what can you expect when there's caramel involved?). The ice cream shake melted extremely fast though, which was its only detraction.

The second day, I ordered a chocolate/strawberry shake and a shroom burger. The server got my shake order wrong (strawberry only), which was disappointing since chocolate is my drug of choice. The burger was tasty, if not a bit too cheesy (shocking, but true). If the cheese was milder in flavor, it might not have been too much, but the pungent taste was overpowering, and I actually like strong cheese. The melty cheese was also stuffed inside a deep-fried breaded mushroom, so it was a bit dangerous to bite into without getting splattered or burned.

Overall, it was a good burger, but what makes this place great are the shakes."}
{"text":"I had heard the advertising for Shake Shack, and without one close to home,,,  I was eager to try,,,,  

We were in town for SPRING TRAINING...  and just came across Shake Shack at the mall,,,  

We came to TEST ,,,   

I ordered the frozen custard with the caramel, and banana pie,,,  OH MY!!!  

Fries, and a Shack burger,,,   

Could there be anything BETTER than In and Out Burger,,???  

This experience was pretty darn close,,,  Burger is juicy and very tasty,, and the fries were crisp,, very similar in texture to In and Out,,  but crinkle cut,,    

I am sold on the frozen custard,,   
I actually got a 2nd shake at the other location in Kierland,,, and I like the texture of the frozen custard,,  soft and you can take it through the straw without getting a brain freeze,,,  

I will stop in when I see another location around home."}
{"text":"Got the chicken sandwich and the fries, the food was good and the price was even better! Families can eat here on the Strip for an inexpensive price."}
{"text":"First time here ... we been seeing ppl post and wanted to try it. Little out of our way but well worth it. It's nothing special just the American classics done right. The Shake dog was a Chicago dog and the cut the peppers so it's a one and done bite. I'll come back."}
{"text":"What more can I say about this place that hasn't already been said. It's epic and everything is good even the freakin hotdog was tasty. Seriously you could just point at the menu and it's gonna be tasty. Don't even think about it just go!!"}
{"text":"I was in this new location Friday between the lunch and dinner rushes.  The line wasn't too long but it was confusing because you can enter from inside the mall and outside through the restaurant's front door.  I hope they can better define where the ordering line starts.

The menu is pretty much the same as the Shake Shack locations that I've been to in New York and Miami.  The employees are very nice and well trained.

I had the Smoke Shack burger and it's tasty with the BBQ sauce and bacon.  I also tried the Dust Devil concrete which is special for AZ and is very good with it's salted caramel and other ingredients."}
{"text":"Five stars is not enough! By far my favorite burger/lunch/dinner/snack place! I've been to all of their locations in Las Vegas but this Henderson location is my fave. I love their shack stack and cheese fries, it is delicious every time I get it. It is very apparent that management and the team take pride in what they do. They offer exceptional customer service from start to finish. Definitely recommend shack shack to every and anyone I know. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Shake shack is a pretty good place to eat. A little bit pricey... Burgers are great but fries are alright. Ice cream is great."}
{"text":"MAJOR TOURIST TRAP ALERT!!!
So yes, for those familiar with Shake Shack you can find many locations within New York and all over the East Coast...us West Coast peeps don't have this CHAIN RESTAURANT. So of course, we want to try it out...

I can appreciate the burger is made with quality ingredients (no hormones in their beef) but as far as flavor and taste of the burger goes, there's much left to be desired! Even with their \"Shack Sauce\" it was very plain tasting and could have been seasoned a lot better.

I had the signature \"Shake Stack\" (single patty cheese burger with fried portebello mushrom) and the \"Smoke Shack\" (bacon cheese burger)...and although both burgers tasted just fine...it was lacking that punch to make me go OMG...very overhyped in my humble opinion! 

Price-wise...well I think Shack Shack is popular because you're not gonna find many places that will serve you anything for under $10 on the Las Vegas Strip! The burgers at Shack Shack range from $7-$10 (depending on what kind and how many patties you get). However, the size of the burger was disappointing as I finished the Smoke Shack burger in a couple bites. For the Smoke Shack (single patty), Shack Stack, and an order of fries...I spent $21!! In this case, I rather would pay a lot less to eat at In N Out or pay a couple extra dollars to eat at a sit down restaurant like BURGR at Planet Hollywood or Holstein's in the Cosmo. 

As an additional note, the Summerlin (also in Vegas, in the Summerlin neighborhood) location has a lower rating then the Strip location...like I said...TOURIST TRAP! 

Shake Shack didn't live up to the hype in my opinion and as a true California kid...I rather have In n Out or Habit Burger if we want to talk chain restaurants!

Final Piece of Dirty Donovan Life Advice - Keep in mind where New York New York Casino is...take an UBER or a CAB because it's a LONG walk from the majority of the casinos on the Strip. Not the business on a hot day!!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre burger. I wish it would have been better. Too much of a chain restaurant. The burger was alright. Cost too much for what I got. Don't have to come back here."}
{"text":"MMMM. The desert is the bomb. The shack attack shake is so chocolatey, only get it if you absolutely love CHOCOLATE. The vanilla malt shake is good too. You can really taste the vanilla. The place is nice and new too, plays good music and the staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken sandwich and it was the worst chicken sandwich I seen in my life.. dry and half way burned. I had heartburn and upset stomach for several hours..that is the last time I'll eat in this cheap restaurant."}
{"text":"Finally tried SS...Atmosphere is nice. 2 burgers and a order of fries and 2 large drinks. $25?  Wow...and the meats is bland and very greasy. Not impressed. Give us Wendy's any day."}
{"text":"A very tasty well seasoned burger on a quality bun with quality toppings Besides the burger they also have good hot dogs and fries (smothered in cheese if you please) what more could you ask for?  A tasty adult beverage of course, this is Vegas and of course they have that as well."}
{"text":"Another one for the books! Shake Shack has the best consistency with their meals. From LA to Vegas, it's still just as good as I know it. This location is so packed though. Tables inside are always full and there's always a line. So if you can, try mobile ordering instead. The app seems to be automatic when it sends you the text about your order being ready at the time that you picked for pick up. The restaurant is so busy that your meal probably isn't ready, but they'll prioritize your order if you go inquire about the pick up. Still beats waiting in that long line to order and then have to wait for it to be made. There's also free 1 hour parking at the NYNY.

If it's your first time, get the Shroom Burger. It's good enough to make you want to be vegetarian!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm not sure if my review of Shake Shack is entirely representative of typical dining experience here, because we came for a light dinner after conquering the legendary Bacchanal brunch buffet. As such, we had limited appetites and disproportionately soaring expectations. (Vegas first world problems.)

1) The CHEESEBURGER is satisfying though not gourmet. There's nothing fancy like bleu cheese and caramelized onions, but it's a carefully tuned version of the classic cheeseburger with cheddar/lettuce/tomatoes. Compared to In-N-Out, Shake Shack stands out with the thicker, juicy patty and the soft, brioche like bun. The SHROOM BURGER is quite good with panko fried portobello, though the mushroom patty is thinner than I'd like.

2) I really liked the CRINKLE CUT FRIES. I may be biased, growing up with a crinkle cut mold in my play dough cooking set and having this ingrained in my mind as the paradigm French fry. Nonetheless, it's something about the texture that somehow makes it extra delicious--my theory is that the shape increases the surface area to volume ratio to augment crispiness. I think I prefer the original to the CHEESE BACON FRIES, which had a savory flair of bacon and bell pepper; unfortunately it gets somewhat soggy and takes away from the crinkle-cut-ness texture.

3) The FROZEN CUSTARD was the highlight, velvety smooth, rich and decadent, with a full-bodied vanilla flavor. It tasted like quintessential vanilla ice cream, except with a creamier consistency somewhat like the intermediate between non-melted and melted ice cream. 

All in all, the visit was a 3-star experience: satisfactory but not mind-blowing. The portions seemed small for the price (like gourmet burger small). It does seem that Shake Shack is a bit over-hyped, which may have contributed to our slight disappointment. My advice would be to go to Shake Shack with a mindset that it's almost similar to In-N-Out--the food is good here, but it's not the place for your grandiose Vegas-level expectations."}
{"text":"Shake Shack... New York prices for ok food, you can definitely do better in Charlotte. Look, if you got a burger, fries, and a soft drink, you are in the $15 range after taxes. Is this burger and fries worth $15, honestly, no. There are plenty of \"fresh patty\" joints in Charlotte where you can get a decent combo for $10-$15 with more choices in toppings and customization.

The value proposition for what you get just isn't worth it in Charlotte."}
{"text":"So I was in Vegas a couple of weeks ago and realized that shake shack was in town. 

I had been following the IPO on CNBC and was super excited to try this place. My friend and I walked from the Venetian to NYNY to have Shake Shack.

When we arrived it was around 1pm and the line was out the door. I have to say the place was pretty good.  I ordered a single burger, fries, and a black/white shake.

The burger was good but seemed a little small. The next time I will probably go with a double.

The fries were good as well. I really like the crinkle cut fries. I think you need to get these with the cheese sauce though. 

The black/white shack was absolutely delicious. One of the best shakes I have ever had. Yummy.

Anyways I have to say the place is really good. I would definitely be back again..."}
{"text":"The line was relatively short which made the overall experience pretty good. Ordering was simple since the menu isn't too extensive and the cashier was friendly. The wait for our meal was about 15 minutes. Our burgers were fresh and the shake was pretty tasty. Overall, good food but nothing to write home about. In and Out still beats these guys on burgers."}
{"text":"Service was great at the counter. Busy place, I assume patrons are to bus their tables and if they don't it takes awhile to get it cleaned as this spot is pretty busy and keeps the workers on the move when it's busy. 

We ordered the single patty shackburger so delicious!!! The burger patty was crispy and delicious, the bun was perfectly soft, buttery, slightly sweet and just the right size. 

My other half ordered the smokeshack thin patties BIG flavor with melty cheese and awesome bacon. 

The cheese fries were pretty dang terrific too! 

The strawberry mint lemonade fell short of the mint flavor and was on the sweeter side. We will definitely in to visit the L.A. location when we get back to home base. 

We hope and wish for a location in Orange County, California verrrrrrry soooooon!  Keep up the delicious flavors and sustainable menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Not as greasy as Five Guys and about as delicious as Chuckbox. Pricing is moderate. 

They give you a vibrating pager to let you know when your order is ready. I had the SmokeStack with cheese fries. Cheese fries were a little salty with the cheese. SmokeStack was on point. It had house-made bacon with bits of cherry peppers with sauce on top of beef patty. I should've gotten a double patty. 

Interior was clean, staff was friendly, parking was plentiful at mid afternoon. Outside area was decently shaded. They don't allow dogs but do have bowls of water outside where your dog can wait for a second while you order. They sell wine and beer. People drive like shit inside the plaza though. Lots of hipsters and cali-types as well. Would recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"Shake or not to shake!!! 

My very first shake was in NYC. These franchises all taste the same so I didn't have high expectations. 

Wrong, blew me away! Crazy atmosphere , located on the strip by New York New York. Almost took me back home with the Brooklyn bridge and of course lady liberty. Had to order something with bacon with it and the fries with shake. 

Overall the service was alright can't throw down the perfect 10/10 rating. Very packed when I got there. Long lines considering it's the strip and everyone wanted to grab something to eat late at night. Seats were plentiful but the back of the restaurant were reserved for the homeless. I didn't mind, they were probably having a blast. 

I can recommend it to people but they already have tried it. Who hasn't???? But give this location a try, worth the trip. Sadly parking is now the devil on the strip. Ty MGM!!"}
{"text":"Shack burger and vanilla milkshake are the best! I like the spacious interior at this location as well."}
{"text":"Very good burger. Had one shake burger. Then ordered another to reconfirm the quality. Yeap....x 2.

Potato bun makes it for me. Everything is fresh. Fries OK. Water to drink."}
{"text":"Nothing horrible here but nothing super exciting either. Sandwiches are a lot smaller than I expected. Good flavor but mine just had lettuce and tomato. No pickle or anything fun. Fries were OK. I recommend NO cheese. Shakes are similar to Zinburger - thick and rich. Nice indoor and outdoor seating including a fire pit. Overall, I'm not itching to return. We got a chicken sandwich, mushroom sandwich, shake, single concrete, and cheese fries and our bill was $30."}
{"text":"I think this place is awesome.  It's delicious and prices aren't that expensive.  

I don't like eating fast food in general, but this place--I approve.  The veggies in the burger seem fresh. And it doesn't even seem so junk-food-like like McDonalds or whatever. 

The first time I was here, I just got the a simple burger: Shack Burger.  Even a simple burger like that was tasty.  The next time, I ordered the Shack Stack, and that was amazing. It has this fried mushroom thing that oozes cheese out when you bite into it.  

My friends and I try to always make a trip to Shake Shack whenever we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had. Plain cheeseburger well done with fries and a strawberry shake. The burger was amazing amazing amazing! AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I really like the meat and bun on the Shack burger. The salted caramel milkshake is also divine. However, I will likely never order their fries again. We tried the fries \"all the way\", which are crinkle cut topped with cheese, bacon bits, and red peppers and it was rather underwhelming. Not enough cheese and too much chopped red peppers, and the fries should be crispier. 

Of the burger chains I've tried so far, I like Shake Shack's burger more than 5 Guys. It is very different from In n Out, so I really can't say which of those two are better. Can't remember the burgers I've had at Habit Burger, so it might be a combo of: it's been too long since I had Habit Burger and they were too unremarkable to remain in memory."}
{"text":"Just bumped this place up to my #1 burger place. Amazingly good! 

The service was a little slow because of all the clients they had but on time when your order is ready. They have an app where you can order ahead of time and skip the huge line they have. A little slower on that but they're response is good and they're all really friendly :)"}
{"text":"I love shake shack. Every time I am in a city that has one, I have to visit it before leaving. This location is on the Strip in Vegas and while it was pretty busy with a long line, they were quick in taking people's orders and served the food in a reasonable speed. The food was delicious. I ordered the shackstack, which is a regular cheeseburger with a fried cheese stuffed portabello mushroom acting as a second patty. The burden way delicious and juicy. I absolutely love how buttery the bun is and how well it compliments the flavors of the meat and portabello mushroom. It may be more expensive, but I'd choose shake shack over in n out in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I went to a Shake Shack in another city last summer and had an experience that was less than stellar. Writing this review, you should know that Shake Shack sent me a gift card to make it up to me. I wasn't sure if I would ever use the gift card because there isn't a Shake Shack in my state. Behold, though, there is one in Vegas! So, I used the gift card from last summer for this experience. That gift card in no way influenced my review here, but I thought it best to be up front about that. 

I love this Shake Shack for a number of reasons: 1) I love that is is close to the new park and that I can sit inside or out to eat my food, 2) I LOVE the prices. So much in Vegas is so overpriced. Shake Shack could charge double or triple what they normally charge and get by with it in Vegas, but they choose to go the route of integrity and charge their typical price, 3) Their burgers are just good, 4) Their custard is to die for, and 5) They stay open late, which means Shake Shack is going to give some of the overpriced places in NY, NY a run for their money.

That said, the fries are just okay. I ordered the cheese fries, and they were a little bland. I'm not sure if it is the fry itself or the cheese, but they weren't great.

The service was amazing, and the way the restaurant hustles folks through line is really good. I can see Shake Shack doing very well in this location in Vegas. I'm excited to add it to my list of places to visit when I'm there."}
{"text":"I was a bit hung over from the other night and it was already 1PM. We were deciding between Shake Shack and Holstein's. Hubby wanted a more traditional burger so we opted for Shake Shack. Plus, we've been wanting to try the Shake Shack in NYC and were excited to see that there was now one open in Vegas.

We got there and the line was almost out the door. We probably waited for about 20 minutes to place our order. I ordered the ShackBurger with cheese and a Chocolate Malted Shake. Hubby got some special burger with crispy onions and a special sauce (i think?) and a coffee shake. We shared an order of the cheese crinkle fries.

The place was filled with large TVs so the hubby was able to watch his sports while we waited. Food came in about 15-20 minutes. I took my first bite and thought it was really good...not sure if it was because it was around 2PM and I was starving. But after a few more bites I realized that I wasn't impressed. It wasn't a bad burger by any means but it wasn't a great burger. My shake was lacking something as well, didn't taste creamy enough for me. Hubby was very disappointed with his burger as well, especially his coffee shake. He did like the fries though, but I, on the other hand, wasn't feeling their special cheese sauce. We both agreed that both In N Out and Five Guys were much better. 

Maybe it tastes better in NYC?"}
{"text":"Shake Shack, even in your prime, you are not better than In n Out. With your soggy buns and gloopy shakes, you consistently find ways to disappoint me. I've been to both the Shake Shack next to Central Park and in Citi Field. This one is probably the worst. It's a serviceable burger, but nothing more than that. This burger right now only has nostalgia purposes. Even the shakes don't taste like custard. When a black and white shake tastes like a slightly upgraded Oreo Mcflurry, you know this isn't where you want to be eating. There's a Burger Bar here, and honestly, I might as grab a White Castle slider if I'm feeling like remembering the good times in New York. Otherwise, I'd head across the way for some delicious In n Out. The two best things I can mention about this place are: the water mister outside and the scenes of New York on their panoramic display screen. And if you think them serving east coast beer is good, remember that most east coast beers (especially NY breweries) aren't very good when compared to their western brethren."}
{"text":"Food:
Ordered the smoke house burger and cheese fries. No shake on the trip! I actually enjoyed the fries more than the burger. The burger was just okay. 
Service: 
The line was out the door but went by really quickly. The guy who took our order was very sweet. We were able to find a table quickly. Definitely need to be quick on your toes to score a table here since its first come first serve."}
{"text":"Came here last Friday night and was so stoked about finally trying it. Not too long of a line, and looking at the menu passes the time, so yeah. I ordered the Shake Stack. FYI, the burger is separate from ordering the criss cut fries, you can't make it a meal. ALSO, you have to tell them you want lettuce and tomatoes, otherwise it doesn't come with it. They give you the light up thing for when your order is ready and if you don't want to order a drink and just want water, there's a water dispenser on the side.

The wait wasn't too long and there's a good amount of seats inside and outside.

The verdict: The burger was just aight. Idk what the hype is, but it was okay, hella whatever. I expected a thick patty but it was hella whatever, no specific taste that made it stick out. The fries were plain too. Let me just say right when I took a bite into it, my I initial reaction was \"In N Out is way better.\" Especially for the price of the burger being $6+, I was hella disappointed. 

It foreal is just the hype."}
{"text":"This was our first time here! We loved it and would definitely come back. Everyone was very helpful and had great customer service. Especially a guy named Tyler! He was awesome with his recommendations and service! It just sucks they can't accept tips and don't even have a tip jar! They need one! Thanks for the great meal Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"I have visited this location twice within the past few months. I personally love the smoke shack it's so good and has a little spice too. My husband ordered the cheese fries which we both thought were a disappointment....the regular fries were much better. This location is busy on the weekends (not surprising) on the weekdays there is a lot less traffic."}
{"text":"Wow. Love it. The rumors are true. I went BACK in line for seconds.  The burgers a little smaller but taste great.  After a day/night of boozing in Vegas......it hit the spot.  I didn't have a shake as they serve beer so I got a beer in a souvenir SHAKE SHACK glow in the dark cup.  I did notice they don't stay open all night but didn't get ahold of what the hours were.  They were trying to close and people kept coming in.  Crinkle cut fries were very good as well.  Its not a fine dining establishment but the food is fast.....its greasy and its good.  I'll def head back to Shake Shack next time in Vegas"}
{"text":"Went to Kierland's Shake Shack. The staff was very friendly and helpful.
Lovely atmosphere.
The food - not so much.
Cheeseburger was tasty, but the patty was very thin- hardly noticed it in the bun.
My husband had the chicken sandwich.
Thickly breaded and deeply fried.
And the French Fries - oh dear, dreadful.
What makes this franchise so loved?
Beats me!"}
{"text":"This place was severely inefficient. Our buzzer went off that our food was done when it actually wasn't done. Then we proceeded to wait for 15 minutes standing there in front of the counter. Turns out, they had not even made our food. We waited another 15 minutes, all while just standing in front of the counter. Our friends came in, already done eating their food, wondering what was keeping us, and our food still wasn't done. The manager gave us a refund but said he would still give us our food. We walked out. I had no intention of eating their food after all that. My advice is go next door to Tom's Urban. Much better service."}
{"text":"I went to Shake Shack again! My last time, it was after Cirque du Soleil's O show and this time, it was after their KA show (this is really a coincidence!) The lineup was once again really long! We wanted to eat this before our show but we would be at least 30 minutes late for our show. We started lining up but had to leave the lineup because it wasn't moving fast enough for us to order, wait for our food, eat and run to MGM. 

I wanted to order their roadside burger for my family since they haven't been to Shake Shack but I ordered the wrong burger... The Roadside burger was not on their black billboard menu and at that time, I couldn't remember what my boyfriend got, so I tried my best and ordered what seems to be the best burger out of the menu: the smokeshack (Cheeseburger topped with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, ShackSauce). I also ordered the strawberry milkshake and their cheese fries. 

Overall, I find the smokeshack a bit too salty for me, it is not as greasy as the roadside burger but I didn't like it much. The bacon was too salty but the patty and sauce was really good. I was surprised to find it a little bit/quite spicy (I must have been blind for not seeing that it contains chopped cherry pepper!) Nevertheless, it was a decent burger but my favorite one is still their roadside burger! Next time, I would try their 'Shroom Burger (Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce),  their Shack Stack (Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce) or their simply their Shack Burger (Cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce), which seems to be the most popular option.

I find their strawberry milkshake to be really average, it tasted like strawberry as expected. I would order their black and white milkshake again but not the strawberry one.

Their cheese fries (Topped with our special blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce) was REALLY good! I really like melted cheese (I'm picky with my cheese since I don't like unmelted ones! Yes, the texture makes a big difference). I don't know why but melted cheese taste much better than unmelted cheese, don't you agree? The cheese was really flavorful but not too heavy, and went well with the fries! I would order this again but next time, I would eat this before it colds down (I don't like it when my cheese becomes \"stiff\", I like it when it stretches)!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! Portions were a bit small for the price but it's Scottsdale. It is an amazing atmosphere and a great place for a date night or family fun night! I highly recommend trying it at least once!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, angus beef, no hormones or antibiotics. We ordered single cheeseburgers which were good but are very small. Husband ordered a second one and said he will order a double next time. Peanut butter milkshake is excellent. The whip cream must be Cabots from Vermont, creamy and delicious. Best milkshake I have had in a long time. The fries were disappointing, crinkle type,very generic, no taste. Will skip these next time. Good seating, TV's in the eating area. Very clean restaurant. Restaurant faces Camelback Road not Scottsdale Rd as others said. Good parking."}
{"text":"2 double burgers, 2 orders of fries (a la carte) 1 med Coke, $35.00. Burgers were small, bun was nasty, taste was below average. Can find much better quality, price and quantity in many other restaurants close by."}
{"text":"Shake Shack makes my favorite burger!  I have been to a few locations in NYC and this location in Vegas produces the same quality of food!  It is also very spacious unlike the locations I have been to in New York.  My order came out fast and hot when I was there.    

Everything about the burger is good.  The meat is cooked well and has great flavor.  The toppings are fresh and the cheese is melty.  The potato bun is soft and fluffy.  I love it all.  There is nothing too special about the fries but they are good and come out hot.  The shakes are to die for too.  I love the black and white shake which is a combination between vanilla and chocolate.  I also highly recommend the peanut butter chocolate shake as well - great peanut butter flavor.  I tried a custard concrete at this location which was super awesome too.  It was very rich and sweet though.  I couldn't finish a whole one by myself.  I definitely think this place is worth a try when you are craving a burger on the strip."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this burger joint for awhile now. I am glad we finally decided to try a new burger joint. The cheeseburger here did not disappoint, and is priced fair. I will be going again!!!!"}
{"text":"I now have tried Shake Shack twice, once in San Diego and once in Vegas. My verdict? It's definitely not worth the price and wait time (if there is still one). I really don't understand what the hype is about. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich this time, and it was just ok. The cut of the chicken was thick, and it was cooked well, but it was definitely over flavored (wayyyy too salty). The chicago-style hotdog was cooked dry and the bun was soggy (it broke before I finished it). The shake was way too sweet.. If you like overpriced burgers, this may be the place for you. But for me, In-n-Out is still way better."}
{"text":"I've waited for this moment forever! Shake Shack is In&Outs competition but I will say they are both amazing in their own ways. I just cannot choose. :) Cheese Fries, juicy burgers and shakes.... All their food is awesome. Even your dogs will love it. ;)"}
{"text":"What a treat to finally try Shake Shack. We were visiting family in North Las Vegas and found this Shake Shack in the Summerlin mall. Best hot dog ever - it came with two types of pickles, tomato and celery salt. The shake was called \"cement\" for good reason. So thick you had to eat it like an ice cream We're excited to learn a Shake Shack will be going in near our home soon. Good service and reasonably priced fare, too."}
{"text":"Meh... This place is ok. Not the best burger or fries I've had. In N Out is definitely way better. The burgers are small and it get super packed... Not sure why considering how the burgers are mediocre. 

Woukd I recommend? I guess, but only if you're too lazy to drive to IN N OUT."}
{"text":"I came here for dessert last night. I ordered one of their Concretes. It ended up being more cost efficient to share a double with my husband than it would have been to order two separate singles.

My only qualm is the mix in to frozen custard ratio. I felt there weren't as many mix ins, and it ends up being basically a plain frozen custard. 

As for ordering, even though the line is long, it moves quickly. The people are extremely friendly, and the service is efficient.

As expected, it's pretty busy and noisy. That being said, it was still easy to find somewhere to sit. 

I haven't tried other food at this particular location, but I have when I lived on the east coast. I think it's a viable option if you're looking for affordable food on the strip. Everywhere else is going to be a lot more expensive."}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack!  Not surprising that my trip to Vegas I was looking forward to this place the most! This place gets a 5 star from me with my order of the Shack Burger. It's located off the strip near New York New York and although the lines get ridiculously long, they're sooo worth it. 

The menu includes things from shakes (must get), to crinkly fries and all different types of burgers. My fat self ordered the Shack Burger and the infamous Chick 'n Shack which comes with a nice chicken patty, veggies, pickles & buttermilk herb mayo! This is the best quick fast food fix that'll leave you satisfied. I'd recommend those two and the hand-spun vanilla shake!"}
{"text":"It was average at best.  Service was ok.  Tables we're dirty when we sat down and had trouble finding clean table to eat.   Way overpriced due to location.  Will not go back"}
{"text":"The best Shake Shack burger I've tried has been the Smoke Shack. The little bit of heat from the chopped cherry peppers is an amazing complement to the smoked bacon and ShackSauce. The Shack Stack with its beef patty and fried portobello is tasty too, but at $9.59 for a single, it borders on pricey for a fast food spot. With all their burgers the buns are too squishy for my tastes (I prefer them toasted and firmer) and the beef patties lack the sear and crust of better burgers around town. The best thing going for Shake Shack are the concretes. In particular, the Red Velvet Rocks with vanilla custard and chunks of red velvet cheesecake is a reason to come back over and over.

3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"This Shake Shack is located in Downtown Summerlin. Inside was clean and the guy who took my order was really nice. The wait to order and get my food wasn't terrible considering they were supposedly making it fresh and they were busy. They have seating inside as well seating outside seating on the patio which is dog friendly. 

Chick'n Shack ($6.59) -  Crispy chicken, lettuce, pickles and buttermilk-herb mayo. My sandwich had both leaf and shredded lettuce, odd. I have to say that I really enjoyed the taste of this much better than the one I had at the other location. I did ask for extra mayo this time and it made a huge difference. I ate every bite and can only hope that if I do stop by for one of these again in the future that it will taste just as good.

Hot Dog ($3.39) - Advertised as flat-top dogs, these hot dogs are sliced down the middle and cooked on you guessed it, a flat-top grill. I added Shack Cheese Sauce for $.50 cents more and that still didn't cover up the not so great taste of this dog. One side was charred way too long and the other was just right. The potato bun was tasty, but this hot dog was just lacking many things. 

Shakes ($5.29-$5.79) - They have soda, water, beer and wine, however we chose to support No Kid Hungry and purchased $2 shake coupons and had shakes with our meal. I was excited to try the Coffee Fair Shake, but it was a real disappointment. The coffee shake tasted like a Jamocha shake from Arby's, but with less flavor. My hubby ended up getting the Peanut Butter shake and it tasted very good! I bought a few of the $2 shake coupons, so I decided to go back and get a peanut butter shake and was so glad I did. 

The fries here are just average in my opinion. I honestly prefer Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken located right across from this Shake Shack because I get a better portion for my money. The burgers here at Shake Shack are too damn small. A double shack burger will set you back $8.19 before tax, drink or fries and let me mention that's for a burger with just lettuce, tomato and sauce. I can get a double double at In N Out Burger for $3.45 before tax, so I just don't get what's going on here at Shake Shack. If someone wanted to come here I'd join them and most definitely I'd go with the chick'n shack, but can't see coming back on my own. One cool thing is there's an outdoor patio with tables/seating and it's dog friendly."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is so hype other than the interior decoration. It's just an overpriced fast food. I don't dislike fast food.  I just don't find anything special about this place but the high price."}
{"text":"I had been waiting to try this place for a long time. Maybe the hype and excitement was too built up for me, but I actually wasn't at all wowed by my experience here at Shake Shack. It was not terrible however it certainly had hits and misses. Shake Shack is attached to New York New York Hotel and Casino, but you have to park at NY NY and walk through the casino out to the sidewalk on LV Blvd to enter Shake Shack. Walking inside I saw lots of heads and was actually glad we were getting our order to-go because seating inside was limited. I was surprised with the amount of customers eating inside that the line wasn't longer, but there was only one customer ahead of us. After placing our order we were told to stand off to the side near the pick-up area where it took a reasonable amount of time to receive our food and the employees who helped us were nice and helpful.

Chick'n Shack ($6.29) - Crispy chicken with lettuce, pickles and buttermilk herb mayo on a potato bun. The chicken was tasty and I really liked it, but the shredded lettuce was hot, wilted, didn't taste fresh and reminded me of what they put on the McChicken at McD's. I'd personally prefer a nice crisp piece of lettuce instead. I recently tried Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken in Downtown Summerlin and they also use shredded lettuce however it had a crisp and fresh taste to it unlike my experience here at SS. The buttermilk herb mayo could have been spread a bit heavier because I couldn't taste it at all and I love mayo on my chicken sandwiches. This sandwich was lacking in the tomato and bacon department and could even have benefited from a slice of cheese, all things I know now to add customized next time if I decide to give them another try. They have a Downtown Summerlin (happens to be right across from BRFC) location which I pass by regularly, so I'd more than likely try that one if I do and the chicken sandwich I'll have tweaked to my liking and I'll pay for the extra add-ons to make it that way. Extra bacon is currently $1.55 which isn't bad considering I don't buy drinks here and just food only. It can add up when buying the full meals, but we usually have our own fountain drinks that we stop at a corner store and get. 

Cheese Fries ($3.99) - The cheese sauce was so thin and hardly had flavor. The fries themselves were just average tasting. I personally wouldn't bother with the fries again.

Hubby liked his Double Shack Burger, but felt it wasn't anything special for $8.09 and there wasn't enough bun for the amount of burger. I thought it looked wrapped in lettuce rather than bun at first glance. Hubby most likely will not return at his request, but I'll possibly give the chicken sandwich a try in the future."}
{"text":"Looking for a burger place and found this on YELP! The reviews were good and so we thought we couldn't go wrong! Burgers were fabulous and the chicken sandwich was delicious! The fries were fantastically crispy (which is what all Fries should strive to be) !  Definitely a do again meal!"}
{"text":"For my second trip to Las Vegas, I KNEW I had to try Shake Shack rather than the typical In-N-Out everyone goes to. Conveniently outside of the New York New York hotel on the Strip. I usually hear that there's a long line for this place but luckily I didn't have a line when I went! My friends and I went after a pool party on my birthday so we needed to refuel our energy. We decided to sit at this long table in the middle of the restaurant with comfy chairs since we had ten people in our group.

I ordered the Shake Burger with fries and a chocolate milkshake on the side. Honestly this is the best burger I have ever tasted! The meat was cooked perfectly and had a little bit of pink and juiciness to it, which I like. The fries and shake were pretty good also, though I couldn't finish both of them. The fries had a nice crispy texture once you take a bite with a little bit of salty flavor, which I like. The shake was probably too rich for my taste buds, which is the main reason why I couldn't finish it.

Overall I was happy that we ate here. A bit pricey for everything I got but I would still come back here next time I'm in Vegas... Or when I visit New York. Whenever that is. (;"}
{"text":"The line was OUT the door. But don't let that stop you. The line moves pretty smoothly. The burgers are pretty good, but they're kinda small, diameter wise, looked like a sand dollar size thing. I got a double patty burger, that helped. Fries were good.

Sadly, I did not par-take in their custards or shakes which is probably the highlight of their menu. Maybe when I'm feeling like going on a massive sugar high I will. 

So, not bad. Not great. If I find myself loathing up and down The Strip again and not wanting to get too fancy about a burger, I'll go back."}
{"text":"Hmm...I was so excited to eat here! Especially to try the chicken shack. The cheeseburger was good, but the chicken didn't come out hot, and my cheese wasn't melted. The crinkle fries were really crispy but nothing special.  

Both the cheeseburger and chicken shack were really small! They definitely don't justify the price. We paid $21 for one chicken shack, regular cheeseburger, one order of fries, and one large drink. 

I was pretty hungry when we came here and even tho it tasted good, I was not impressed. Thankfully there was a minimal line, if there was a large line (like how it was roped off) I would have been even more disappointed. It already took a while for our food to come out I couldn't imagine waiting even longer."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after hearing so many good things about it, but I have to say it feels like just another burger joint with above average prices. My friends have compared it to In and Out and I have to say that In and Out wins because of price, taste, and quality. 

I ordered the shack burger since I figured it seemed sensible to try out their original burger. When I picked it up it looked like a regular burger with no qualities that would make it stand out in my mind. Another thing I didn't like was how runny the sauce and cheese was. The bun was really soft and squishy which was weird because I am used to bread that has some sort of stability. The burger tasted alright. It had a more charred taste to it, kind of like the burgers you would have at a bbq. 

The crinkle cut fries were actually pretty good so that brought in some redemption lol. They were crispy which is really important to me because soggy fries are just nasty. If you are going to eat unhealthy, you got to do it right!

I didn't try the shake this time, but I might come back just to check it out since the place is called Shake Shack haha. I did get the SHACK-A-PALOOZA with my friends which was pretty good! The only downer is that it was pretty small looking for the price of $15.95. 

Give this place a shot if you are near the New York New York Hotel area and are craving for some American fast food (as if you couldn't get enough of that elsewhere). The first time it opened, there was a huge line out the door, but I went on a Friday night and there was hardly a wait."}
{"text":"I heard that this place is from New York so I had to give it a try. The burgers are really good here! Their fries are Krinkle cut which I'm not a big fan of but they were still good. It's a little bit pricey but worth it. I would recommend if anyone is visiting Vegas to try this restaurant."}
{"text":"clean, organized, delicious, pricey compared to its comparative, in-n-out. in-n-out still the winner in my book but you gotta try shake shack at least once in your life to be able to have a say yourself. i like that they have a great system including vibrating remote to let you know when your order is ready and offer alcohol too. indoor and outdoor seating available, outdoor window if you want to order a quick drink"}
{"text":"Pretty fast with as many people that there are. Great food, little greasy, but pretty great quality."}
{"text":"I don't get why people love this place. The burgers are awful. Mushy, small and loaded with the gross shake sauce that tastes like bland mayo. I much prefer in and out or five guys, which is also at the mall."}
{"text":"Finally !!! I wanted to try this place after I had seen it in one of my favorite films from years ago called Something Borrowed... that film took place in New York City but anyway I was happy overall with my burger, i just expected more for the cost...had  the shack burger with cheese and my boyfriend had the barbecue bacon shack burger with bacon cheeseburger french fries.. my crinkle cuts were perfect, crispy and fresh my boyfriend complained of the lemonade he said it was so sweet he probably got diabetes right there on the spot  even trying to dilute it with water didn't help so no go on the lemonade next visit. I would suggest they offer a combo, especially since that location  is in a local outdoor mall and a lot of families visit Vegas or like myself a local who likes to try new things. Al a carte option at the end of the day for two people iwas 30 bucks... this may be my one and only visit considering there are many options in town for a cheeseburger & french fries that are a little less expensive & taste just as good"}
{"text":"Great food, great price. A relief after paying all the high strip prices. Very nice outdoor seating area. Only downside is their ticket system seems a bit disorganized. A lot of incorrect orders. If they could get that to be more efficient, I'd give a 5*."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting a shake shack and I had heard so many great things about it. I ordered a burger and some fries and wasn't very impressed. The burger looked great, but when I bit into it it was sort of bland, and the bun was sort of stretchy? The fries were alright, nothing to write home about. 

For what I paid I didn't feel like it was worth it. The only thing that I would be back for is ice cream."}
{"text":"Tasteless burger except for the 1/2 pound of salt they dumped on it. $6 for an 8oz shake? Lots of better options."}
{"text":"The burgers here were super small though they were tasty. My kids usually don't like portobello burgers but this one was well prepared. They also had a gluten free bun so I'll give them one star for that. Unfortunately their vegetarian option cannot be made GF so I was out of luck but the fries and shake were good."}
{"text":"Ok so I am an in-n-out girl through and through so I went to Shake Shack tonight with a really open mind. I was excited when I saw it first opened and couldn't wait to try this east coast staple. We ordered the Smoke Shack burger, Shack-cago dog, cheese fries and a drink. This all came out to about $20. 

Pros: the fries. Omg the fries. I would come back for the cheese fries alone. The burger and hot dog were also both pretty good as well. But the fries were the standout for me. 

Cons: we came on a Friday night around 6:30pm and they only had 2 out of the 3 registers open so we had to wait in line for quite some time before ordering. 
Next would have to be the size and pricing of the food. I was shocked when we picked up our dinner at how small the portions were.  Like I said, the food was good but if I'm going to pay $20 for cheeseburgers and hot dogs dinner I would at least like to get my money's worth. We were hungry again by the time we got home. :(

All in all I would like to come back just to have the fries again and to try a shake, but if I'm going for a burger I'd rather go to in-n-out for the same amount of food for half the price"}
{"text":"Treated 15 of my nieces and nephewslast night near close after going ice skating, the staff couldn't have been more accommodating, prompt, and friendly!!  Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Located in the District at Green Valley, the Shake Shack was a fun dinner place for Friday night.  It isn't too busy and the burgers are consistently good- a little on the greasy side, but good.  Fries are crinkle cut and usually perfectly cooked.  I love that they have hot dogs as well.  The restaurant itself was nicely maintained- even for a busy Friday night.
 
I was really disappointed that they don't have a kid's menu!  My 2 year old can't possibly eat the small sizes they offer.  It turns out to be a waste.
You can get the same experience at similar places, it seems, for a better price too."}
{"text":"Definitely worth a try so you can contribute to the poll of the year: Shake Shack or In-n-Out?!

TL;DR:

Better burgers at In-n-Out.
Better fries at Shake Shack - don't you dare forget the cheese sauce."}
{"text":"Ok- I finally get a chance to review this.   I was trying to find the right words to say because people are going crazy over this. I just needed time to sort out my thoughts so don't kill me but I must be true to myself...

I prefer In and Out over Shake Shack. THERE! I said it! So much has lifted off my shoulders. PHEW!

Now let me explain- it's not a horrible place but if you put a gun to my head- yeah- I said it....I pref in and out. One major thing is the bun.  It feels and taste like a Hawaiian roll.  If you're into that- then this is the place for you.  Me, on the other hand, I like em soft but NOT sweet.  I always get my buns extra toasty at In and Out and this was soft and I could imagine it soggy iN .2 seconds. It was the type of bun that would get in the nooks and crannies of your teeth and you wouldn't even know it but when you turn to your friends or boo, there would be white chewed up bun pieces in the interproximal of 6 or more places. 

Fries with crinkled- reminded me of middle school and that's where it's gonna stay. The cheese dried immediately and made all of them stick together. Flavorless. 

I'll just drive off the strip and stick to my go to but thanks for the 2nd meal after looking in the mirror :P"}
{"text":"Chicken shack is the best chicken sandwich hands down. The double burger is okay. I personally am not a huge burger fan anyway. Though it's better than all other fast food chains. Too greasy for me. I love their crinkle cut cheese fries. DONT get the double down fries (the cherry peppers does not compliment the cheese fries) but the bacon is good. Def not worth the $8, just get another chicken shack."}
{"text":"Shake shack OMG! Delicious ! I'm a California  girl and love my IN N OUT. But, Shake Shack definately in the same league if you want a fresh, scrumptious burger that is fresh and made exactly the way you want! Loved it soo much we ate it twice while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Simple, fresh, and downright DELICIOUS!!!  We had already eaten burgers at Gordon Ramsey's burGR earlier in our trip, and I didn't really want to eat burgers again, but my brother highly recommended trying the Shake Shack, and when my brother highly recommends something, I take him seriously because it takes a lot to impress him.

I had the hamburger with everything on it, and it was juicy, tasty and had all the right textures. I liked that there was just the right amount of everything so that nothing was dripping or falling out.  Everything was just perfection - not too greasy, not too dry, not soggy.  The veggies they use are fresh and nothing beats hot, perfectly salted crinkle fries.  My husband had the portabello mushroom burger which interestingly, was a batter and fried portabello that is stuffed with oozing cheddar cheese.  Although it's the vegetarian option, it's not as healthy as most vegetarian choices in other establishments.  You can add this oozing portabello mushroom to any burger on the menu.  It's definitely different and I've never seen anything like it before, but one bite was enough for me.  It's very rich. 

If you have any room left after devouring your tasty burger and fries, be sure to try the frozen custard.  We ordered a \"concrete\" to share which had peanut butter, toffee, chocolate and bananas in it.  It was so creamy and so smooth and most importantly, so sinfully delicious!  

We didn't order any shakes, which is absolute blasphemy at a place known for and named SHAKE shack, but I had two more days left in Vegas!  I'm a light packer and my only pair of jeans that I brought with me had to be able to zipper up for two more days!  This just gives me an excuse to revisit Shake Shack the next time we are in Vegas.  

The ambiance here is bright, fun, and modern.  The tables were handmade in Brooklyn (the original Shake Shack is famous in NY) from reclaimed wood that was a bowling lane in it's past life. I appreciate detailed touches like that.  We happened to go on the night of the Grammy's and we sat in our booth while eating and enjoying the Grammy's on the Big Screen in the middle of Shake Shack.  Needless to say, I have never had a better experience with food and ambiance in a burger joint than I did at Shake Shack.  Thanks brother, for leading me in the right direction, yet again!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed the shakes on a few occasions, they are a bit pricey, though. Recently tried the shack burger for the first time. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the meat. The bun did get a little soft by the time I finished. I did enjoy the crinkle fries. So I will be back for a confirmation on quality vs price."}
{"text":"I am not much a fan.  The service was good and fast.  The chicken dog needed some onions and relish on it.  The fries needed more flavors.  I liked the wine though.  I like the location though because you can seat outside and enjoy the view."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try Shake Shack this past weekend. We waited in line for about 45 minutes to order on the 2nd day this location was open. While the strawberry milkshake was killer, the burger and fries were just ok. My boyfriend loved his Chocolate Cheesecake Milkshake, but we agreed that the quality of the food wasn't worth the price. We both tried the SmokeShack burger, which had spicy peppers, bacon, cheese, and the usual lettuce/tomato/pickle on a potato bun. I appreciate the peppers and the nice pickles they have, but the burger itself left something to be desired. The fries were crispy but lacked flavor or freshness. I would come here for another milkshake, but I'd rather have a burger and fries from somewhere else (like Five Guys), especially considering that I spent $16 for my burger, fries, and milkshake."}
{"text":"I usually go to the small shake shack in va, decent. But this Shake Shack was astounding. The interior is beyond beautiful and the food was amazing. I ordered a shack burger, fries and strawberry shake. Me and my family loved it as it was their first time having shake shack."}
{"text":"Came here twice during our last Vegas trip. I had Shake Shack a few years ago in NY, and thought it was good, but not mind blowing good. It is exactly the same with this Vegas location. Imo, burger here is better than other burger restaurants from celebrity chefs in Vegas, taste, portion and price wise. The burger is small (enough for small person like me, but big guy should get two), and I love portion control so it works well for me. At $5, it is inexpensive but not cheap for a single burger. A Shroom Burger is almost $10, expensive but is a must try for first timer since it is quite unique. The meat is well seasoned, on the dry side but still acceptable. Get the regular fries! the cheese made the fries soggy and we didn't like that. We got a shake and half/half drink, good, but not memorable.
The line was long but moved quickly. Place gets crowded but people comes in and out so just be patient to get a seat."}
{"text":"Most delicious hot dog (Chicago Dog) I've ever had.....cheese burger excellent.....cheese fries excellent. Over all 10/10!!"}
{"text":"Lots of hype.

Pretty good burger. I got the smoke shack. Overall tasty and nice kick with the peppers but wish the patty was more seasoned. For the cost, I prefer In n Out.

The cheese fries were pretty good. Nice change with the crinkle fries and not greasy or soggy, but they use the pre-melted cheese. Might be better if it was real cheese.

Got the cranberry lemonade and it was really good BUT the cup was so small.

The hugest negative was how crowded it was. So difficult to get a table. Pretty much have to prey upon people as they finish their food to guarantee you can get a seat inside. Sitting outside wouldn't be bad during the warmer days but I came during the winter so an inside seat was a must. 

Not bad food but you will spend a lot. Thanks but I'll stick to my In n Out."}
{"text":"Downtown summerlin is my neighborhood. So  come here very often and tried every restaurants here (except those typical panda express). This burger place is delicious! Yes, it's pricey. If you enjoy Bachi burger, you'll enjoy it too. And this one is in between In n Out and Bachi."}
{"text":"I want to give a shout out to Daniel for superb table touching service. Having a manager go around by asking how everything is and interacting with the guest was a very positive experience. You only get that kind of service at fine dining restaurants, but getting it here at a fast food burger joint was completely unexpected. Imagine you're at In-N-Out and the manager goes up to your table and follows up on your meal. Tells you a story about the business and how the history came about. Informs the menu in details. That's the service we got here from Daniel, so keep up the great work man!

As for the food, bulk up the burgers a bit... 
Or change the name to Shake Shack Snack :)"}
{"text":"Sorry I just don't get it. Atmosphere is good. Nice patio to enjoy a late dinner (when the parking lot isn't crazy).  But the food is fast food and the fries strongly resemble ore-Ida crinkle cut fries. They may have been ore-Ida. Too expensive for the quality.  I like McDonald's better"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after waking past it since we been here. There were long lines but today we cut a break with just a few folks ahead of us. The order taker was not friendly and I couldn't make out what she was saying. She didn't try to speak above the loud music. I ordered the Shackcago dog and Shackburger. I liked how the hotdog was split lengthwise and grilled well. It was good but not as memorable like the ones I had in Chicago and Vancouver. My hamburger was wrapped in lettuce. I liked that they didn't use iceberg. It was tasty but their secret sauce didn't stand out to me. I did have a bite of the chicken burger which was very tasty, moist and crisp. I would come back and explore more."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick shake and the register girls were totally mean and not customer friendly. Honest will never come here again."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is simple, yet awesome. Looking from the outside in, you might be wishing you went to a restaurant that offers giant burgers that you can't even finish. After you eat a Shack Burger, you will change your mind. Buttery, meaty, excellently flavored, and simply delicious. The fries are a great compliment and super crispy. The shakes are the bomb as well since they are made with frozen custard and not crappy soft serve. I have been three times, and I will be returning every time I see one."}
{"text":"Finally!  I'll admit, I may be biased bc I'm an east coaster who prefers most burger joints over In N Out, so I shall leave you with these tips.

The portions are fairly sized so if you don't want to be too stuffed, try going for a single burger, share the fries, and most definitely treat yourself with a concrete and/or a milkshake.  That custard of theirs is unique and complements their burgers very well, just sayin.  Enjoy the taste of NYC!"}
{"text":"I'm sure I'm going to get a lot of hate for this but I'm from southern CA and it's all about In N Out apparently. I'm not a hater but it gets old hearing about how it's the best. Now here comes Shake Shack and truth be told I might actually like this place more. Every time we go to Vegas I noticed we always stop here. Beauty of a store since it's on the strip but man it can be packed at any time of the day. I think I've gone here at 11am and 11pm and shockingly it's actually less busy at 11am but I guess that's Vegas for ya. I've had a hamburger and a chicken sandwich at this location and I actually loved both. Not to mention they have crinkle cut fries and I am a sucker for them. The shakes, ice cream, and cement are also delicious. It's a close fight but maybe just maybe Shack Shack might win this burger war...looks like Pasadena just got a Shake Shack...I'll be back later to write this."}
{"text":"Solid burgers, a delightful addition to the Vegas Strip.  Just as I remember from NYC (oh how they are missed now that we live in SF)!"}
{"text":"Long wait, but shake shack is always worth it. Had in in NY and loved it! This Vegas store is pretty similar to the OG one in NY. All time favorite is the shroom burger, the cheese in the middle is to die for. Only down side is its expensive :("}
{"text":"I usually go to shake shack in Dallas but since I was in Vegas for the EDC festival, I figured I'd come by and order a to go order to bring back to New Orleans. The order took almost 20 mins mind you other customers received their orders well before me while making orders after me. I was heading to the airport after and while boarding my flight, I realized I was missing two burgers from my order. This shake shack doesn't have their crew in the shape it should be. A disgrace to the Vegas strip and this needs to be recognized. I told the girl that I usually get my to go orders in a box in dallas and she replied \"sorry we aren't Dallas\". . . Although that may be true, she could've done something to compensate for this inconvenience or offered another solution instead of saying \"sorry we aren't Dallas\" I won't be visiting this location in the future and I DON'T RECOMMEND this location to anyone visiting Las Vegas. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Pros:  Quick service, polite cashier, nice setting, good music, good food (according to the person I ate with), good beer.

Cons:  My food wasn't too great (it was hot though),  way too many onions, the shake sauce tasted weird and I wasn't asked if I wanted it (I didn't realize it came on the sandwich).  

This review is short because it wasn't too much to say."}
{"text":"This was probably my favorite burger we ate all weekend. I was a little hesitant to eat here because one just opened a couple hours from where we live, but we were starving and wanted something fast. I got a burger and my boyfriend got the hotdog and they were both delicious! Crinkle cut fries are my favorite and these were cooked perfectly. For fast food it's definitely above par. I would go back in a heartbeat, and need to try the ice cream next time."}
{"text":"It's pretty good. I like their fries and the custard! The burger is pretty good but not for the price. We got the shake shack something that came with the deep fried mushroom. I thought the burger was way to cheese and didn't have enough meat."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got the double the meat in our burgers which meant an extra $5 each patty which we didn't realize! Might as well just order 2 burgers instead for the same cost is what we thought after buying. The food is average. This place is all hype. I will not come back here again because of how expensive it is since it tastes average. I am glad I tried it to get out of my system but there are places that taste the same. The service was good though but the line is very long. It wrapped around the door. I am giving 3 stars because I am disappointed because I was expecting a lot."}
{"text":"Delicious single hamburgers with no cheese. The sauce was so good! Our waitress was delightful!
We will return!
Thank you!"}
{"text":"Never had I had a beef patty that tasted so deliciously beefy! So good! The cheese was melted perfectly - to the point where it was wet and got into the crevices of the patty. 

The mushroom burger was really good too. The cheese in it is opposite of the shack burger. The cheese was very stretchy when I bit into it and was not wet like the shack burger. The mushroom was breaded which complimented the soft bun really well. 

The fries were hard on the outside but very meaty when I bit into it. The best crinkle fries I've ever had! All the crinkles fries I've tried had before this were very soft and flimsy so when I first saw that shake shack only serves crinkle fries I was a bit disappointed. But man was I pleasantly surprised when I took my first bite of their fries. 

The milkshakes were amazing also! I tried the chocolate and strawberry ones and they were both really good. Not too sweet and very creamy. Love it! 

In and Out gets compared to shake shack a lot. And between the two, I like shake shack more. The only thing I wish was different is that the bun was not that soft. 

Shake shack please come to San Francisco! My favorite fast food burger joint for sue!"}
{"text":"So finally made it to First Charlotte location. The burgers were seasoned well and the fries were also fried perfectly and crispy. They  shake shack sauce is tasty look like thousand island dressing but doesn't taste like that at all. 
I went on a Monday and lines were that bad. The cheese for the cheese fries wasn't the greatest and clumped up kind of quickly. They have different burgers and they also offer hot dogs and chicken sandwiches. 
The restaurant is very casual and they have a patio that is dog friendly. Their milkshakes and ice cream are also very popular."}
{"text":"THE HYPE WAS REALLY REALLY HIGH when 15 of my friends came here.

Being CA natives, nothing has ever topped in n out. We got all sorts of burgers, fries, shakes, and beers. 

In summary: it definitely lived up to the hype. This is going to be a very very successful chain of they keep it up!! Can't believe I am saying this, but I'd rather go here than In n Out ."}
{"text":"Pros: I thought the cheese fries were delicious but the shake stack was a bit salty. The peanut butter shake was also very good. 

Cons: Kinda pricey compared to in n out and the portion is also smaller."}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed!!!

It was simply great!!'

A bit of a wait but totally worth it 

The Shack Stack is super good along with the smoke shack

The prices were about $6 a single and $9-10 for a double / shack stack.

Big seating area

Lives up to its hype!"}
{"text":"first time trying shack shack and was pretty excited! food was great. shack was a little too thick and fattening but tasted great with my burger :) service was on top! servers kept themselves busy, i was pretty impressed when they got me a refill of my coke zero because you don't expect that at a fast food place. if this was a restaurent, i would've left a 30% tip for them. great food, just a little too crowded because this just opened in AZ for the first time so i'll come back again in couple months."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I thoroughly absolutely enjoyed this place!! I was about to go to work at. T-Mobile Arena. They have a Shake Shack as well but I decided to find the legit place before I started. It was really worth the time I spent. Crazy right when you hear a local trying out a place on the strip. 
What I ordered: ShackBurger, Fries, & Small Soda

ShackBurger: You know you see on TV and they take all day to make like the perfect burger. That's what I felt like when I took that first bite of the ShackBurger. The burger patty was cooked to perfection having the juices still intact. The thousand island or \"special sauce\" was little bit too much but hey it didn't get on me.

Fries: Crinkle-cut fries cooked to order and they weren't soggy fries like you get at a certain fast food chain that has the golden arches. 

Small Soda: Well I wouldn't say small but it could represent as a medium. 

Overall: Great food, wait time was relatively long but understandable when it's a busy day so it was worth the wait time."}
{"text":"First off I am not a burger fan...I will never crave a burger but after having Shake Shack? Yum! Their burger was so juicy and packed with flavor. I really liked the peppers in there. It adds a good amount of flavor and it's different. 

Man... I'm going to have to either visit NY or LV again"}
{"text":"Words cannot describe what my mouth tastes  hahaha but seriously I would definitely recommend coming here anytime, if you are coming back or coming here for the first time. It was really good and different than other burger places like in and out. The bun is really soft and the quantity and size of the burger is perfect; enough to be full along with fries and a shake! I also bought the caramel shake and it tasted really good! It's not too sweet and not too dull so I really enjoyed it! I don't know if the Shake Shack here tastes like the Shake Shack from New York, but it's really good and I would come back! Like I said, I would highly recommend coming here for burgers, fries, shakes, and/or hot dogs! Great job!"}
{"text":"The worst service and way to expensive. 30$ for 2 burgers a order of fries and 2 drinks! ucking rip off! Terrible terrible terrible"}
{"text":"Nice environment,but the food wasn't that great. Paid $6.00 for a burger (not including drinks or fries).  Very bland I must say. The if this is your first time I highly suggest to get a chicken sandwich instead otherwise you'll be disappointed.  Also, try out the BBQ bacon burger! That burger is really good."}
{"text":"Heard so much hype about Shake Shack, and was excited to try it. I got a bacon cheeseburger, fries, and a small drink. My wife got the basic burger combo. This set us back around $25. For that price I expected much more in terms of quality. The burger itself was tasty but it was ridiculously small, and the bun was a soggy mess. The crinkle fries were below average and the soda fountain is behind the counter, meaning you have to wait for refills. I did not have a shake and I'm willing to try them, but I'll never waste my money on the food again. Smashburger has much better food, far more toppings, better fries  and is a bit less expensive. 

Bottom line: don't come here hungry and expect to leave full."}
{"text":"The best part about dining at Shake Shack were the employees. They were so kind and attentive. Apart from the service the food was delicious as well. There are so many different options. The BBQ cheese fries are to die for!!! The wait wasn't too bad either. Overall, it was a great experience!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to go to Shake Shack since we've heard so much about it and we have in and out in California. Upon arrival, the line was pretty decant. There's a variety of selections of burger to milkshakes, and alcohol. I've decided to get the shake shack burger that consist of a cheeseburger annnnd a mushroom burger on top! Ugh,  mushroom burger, you can't go wrong with that. The sizing of the burger is a good size, it gets you satisfied and full. What I liked about the mushroom burger was that it was filled with cheese! Soooo good. But I felt the burger itself was a bit heavy for me. It's pretty oily. But you definitely can get your money's worth. I also got a side of cheese fries. It's pretty average. I recommend it to any cheese lover at there, don't expect it to be the best but it's something worth trying. 

Overall, I love the side bars with lots of sauce accommodation to your needs with water if needed. It's worth a try but I'm probably going to stick to in and out, being affordable and just being light on the burger."}
{"text":"These burgers were great. You can tell they made the patties and buns. The crinkle cut fries were crispy and good. It was worth the stop. It only cost us $26 for 3 of us. Two of us got waters and we shared the fries since the serving was big enough to share for two."}
{"text":"If you're not ordering a 'Shroom Burger you're doing it wrong."}
{"text":"Sorry California but I have to show love to the Shake Shack over In & Out Burgers. Yes it's hard to admit the East Coast chain has better burgers than California's own In & Out Burgers. Great shakes and burgers. Must try"}
{"text":"Delicious food, but overpriced for what you get. Also bummed they do not offer military discounts."}
{"text":"I made it to Shake Shack the last two nights and my impression of the place was there are better burger places in town for sure.
   There wasn't much of a wait either night. When entering an employee handed out a readable menu in case you don't want to look at the giant wall menu. I was lucky enough on the first visit to be handed a sample of the custard. I prefer custard over ice cream and it was good. With multiple people taking orders the line moves fast. You are handed a buzzer to let you know when the food is ready and it doesn't take long to get your food. Condiments are located at a couple of stations along with napkins, straws and utensils.
   I had the double shack burger and the shack stack. The burgers themselves are a bit greasy but still flavorful. Both came with shack sauce which is a garlic/ mayo spread that is just ok but the downfall was the Crisp fried portobello. Filled with Munster and cheddar cheese it is served with a warning that it is hot. To me it has a steamy watery taste when you bite into and ruined the burger. The fries were your basic crinkle cut fries you can find in the freezer section of the local grocery store. I must of had the bottom of the bag as all the fries were broken off pieces and not the thicker meaty pieces. I liked the draught root beer they served. It is made in Louisiana at a brewing company and is one of the best I've tasted. 
  I want to go back and try a shake or a Concrete( like a DQ blizzard). They have a lot of flavors and have a monthly schedule of custards that change weekly. This is something to grab while in the area but not worth going out of your way for. Their prices are high but being on the strip that's expected."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!! Had the Chick 'N Shack, cheese fries and Strawberry Lemonade. My son had the Smoke Shack, cheese fries and peanut butter shake. All were FABULOUS!!!!!"}
{"text":"I like Shake Shack...I like it just as much as I  like that other place that 95% of you compare it to. Am I  gonna compare the two? HELLZ NO!!!!, I'll Let YOU waste your time on that. If you're trying to compare, Freddy's has a much more similar concept IMHO...moving on...

We were fortunate to have attended the Elite event where it was my first time experiencing Shake Shack. We were planning to try three different burgers, but due to our location in the back of the patio, the very talked about Smoke Shack never made it to us.This was also the first Elite event where we saw DOGGIE BAGS!?!? Yup, Elites went there..classy huh? So a return visit was planned to try the Smoke Shack.

A couple weeks later, we returned already knowing what we wanted, I got a Smoke Shack and also tried a Chicken Dog, Chicago Style. Wifey liked the flavor and simplicity of the Shack Burger, so along with some fries, we were set.......until I saw a sign advertising a PUMPKIN PIE CONCRETE, so that was added for dessert and put on hold until we finished our meal.

Service is always friendly, quick, and efficient here, and although there may be a line at times, the wait times for your order don't seem long at all. As the burgers go, they are quite tasty. Shake Shack burgers have that flavor that will definitely keep people coming back. The frozen custard here is dense, rich, and smooth and a perfect end to your meal. Flavors change weekly, and the concretes are exclusive to this location only. Prices here may be a deal breaker for some, as well as portion sizes, but the Smoke Shack and concretes will definitely keep me coming back. ALOHA!!!

Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  4"}
{"text":"WAY OVERRATED!

I'm blown away by all they hype Shake Shack has generated.  Went here a few days ago.  Prices are certainly reasonable but that was the only upside to my review.  Dined here w/ a party of 3.  The burgers were ok at best!  They were cooked right but lacked flavor.  Our party of 3 split an order of regular fries and cheese fries.  The regular fried came out extremely cold.  I went back up to the counter and exchanged them.  The girl touched them with both her back and front of her hand as if she need to double confirm their coldness factory!  The cheesy fries taste like they have heated up canned cheese atop of them.  Basically Del-taco fries here.

We also had a custard and a concrete which were also just ok especially for the calories listed.  I was hoping the taste would match the calories but it didn't :-(.

I'll stick w/ In & out and five-guys over the Shack.  I recommend you at least try it to formulate your own opinion.  I won't be back unless forced by a group of friends."}
{"text":"Hmmmm honestly not sure what the hype is about... I'm from LA and whenever I tell people I'm making a trip to Vegas, I always get a \"You HAVE to try Shake Shack!\" So I had to try Shake Shack :P The food was good, the prices not so good..
I got the Shack Stack ($9.59) and crinkle cut fries ($2.99)  while my boyfriend got the single All Shook Up frozen custard with mix-ins ($4.59) and the Shack-Cago Dog ($4.25). My friend got the single ShackBurger ($5.29). My burger was pretty good- the fried mushroom stuffed with melted cheese was definitely my favorite part of the burger! However, I finished it real quick and was still hungry for more.. their burgers are pretty small for $10 :/ I expect a burger at that price to fill me up. My boyfriend thought his hotdog was okay (came with a pickle, cucumber, onions, tomatoes and relish) and would've rather paid $1.50 for a more filling and equally tasty hotdog at Costco haha. My friend also thought the ShackBurger was tiny and rather pricy, for such a simple burger. Their fries however were pretty good- texture: crispy & crunchy! 
Overall I wouldn't have any strong cravings or urges that would lead me back to this place, but it was nice to try just to see what it was all about."}
{"text":"Great burger, fries, and drinks, with an eclectic feel and healthy ingredients (including organic beef). Yes, the burgers are small...but who said you had to get just one? :) The associates are pleasant and knowledgeable about the food. The tables are pretty cool, like trendy wood picnic tables. A TV plays a family friendly movie. The location is convenient in downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"Finally Shake Shack on the West Coast! I was so excited to come here since it has been years since I've last had a Shack Stack back in New York. Shake Shack is located at outside of the NYNY hotel. If you parked at the hotel or get dropped off at valet, you will have to walk through the hotel until you reach Las Vegas Blvd.

Shack Stack - combination with the ShackBurger and Shroom burger. This is the burger to get! Perfect combination of a beef patty and fried cheese stuffed mushroom together in a burger. The buns are also super soft. It's the one highlight I always remember back when I was in NY.

Cheese fries - Crispy Crinkle Cut fries topped with cheesy sauce. The fries are good itself but top it off with cheese... drools.

Great addition to the west coast. This is my new must stop place when I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Don't think I've ever had a better burger than here!! Can't wait to try everything on your menu! Thanks Shake Shack!!"}
{"text":"yummy burger, cheap-ish and fast...on the strip.... you can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Good meal for a decent price on the strip. Line moved pretty quick and fries hit the spot."}
{"text":"Ok - as a restaurant consultant, I found it necessary to find out what all the talk was about at the new Shake Shack! Disappointment is an underestimation!
Service - I rate a 4 out of 5. As busy as they are, their system is pretty good. The employees are polite  and, for the most part, congenial. But the food - I would rate a \"0\" out of 5. I eat at different restaurants every night of the week and include many hamburger restaurants but this is by far the worst in terms of taste, size and value. 
The food was very very bland. The cheese sauce was so bland you couldn't tell it was cheese. The fries are tasteless - similar to the Frozen fries you buy at the grocery store and bake in your oven. The shake was very small for the price. All for $33. We ate at the Outback Steakhouse in Henderson the night before and had a nice steak each, wine, soup and an appetizer for $60. And we enjoyed the meal! So, overall, I would rate the whole meal .5. I guess location is everything and they have a captive clientele so will continue to survive, especially at those prices. But honestly, I would never return and for locals that don't want to be ripped off, stay away. McDonald's, Wendys, Burger King, Jack-In-The-Box, 5Guys, In and Out, etc. much better taste, much better value."}
{"text":"Lived up to its expectation!

Since I've heard of this place, I've been wanting to try a Shack stack-- cheeseburger topped with a fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheese. Despite the unattractive 770 calories, this burger really fills you up! And when are you going to be able to try it again anyway? I'm not exactly from NY. My favorite part of the burger was the mushroom, wouldn't have minded if it lacked a fried exterior. Wasn't a fan of the cheese on the burger since the mushroom had melted cheese already, but with so many patrons, it's time consuming for them to customize or substitute items unless you have a food allergy. It's nice that their menu asks you to inform them of any allergies right away. Customer dedication at its best. The employee standing outside the front glass door letting people in was friendly and asks if it's your first time dining there prior to making jokes about it not being all that great. Line moves fast. 

*Crinkle cut fries were good, not overly salty, and are a fun wavy shape.

*Tried a single scoop of frozen chocolate custard, maybe I should've tried vanilla instead. It's definitely thicker and creamier than regular ice cream; it tasted like rocky road to me, almost like the chocolate ice cream and marshmallows were melted and mixed together, minus the almonds.

*Water cups and fountain are past the pick up area toward the middle. Refill as many times as you like. 

*Line/window C outside on the left allows you to order non-hot items such as frozen custard, shakes, fountain drinks, beer, and memorabilia (T-shirts, etc.). I got the black viva Las Vegas sign/Shake Shack shirt for $18. 

I'll be back in the future."}
{"text":"To start with let's get the comparison of In and Out burger out of the way. The Actual burger and fries at In and Out burger are better. 
The Burger at Shake Shack is good and I enjoyed the added bacon (hard to go wrong with bacon) and the peppers and shake sauce. The crinkle cut fries are okay but not fabulous. I didn't partake in a shake but did have the frozen custard (ice cream). I had vanilla with hot fudge. The ice cream custard was tasty but they seemed to skimp on the hot fudge. 
Overall not bad, way better than the Mickey D's, Wendy's, Jack in the Box, Burger King but it doesn't top In & Out."}
{"text":"So happy I decided to try Shake Shack for the first time in Las Vegas it was really good one of my new favorite stops added to my Vegas trips ! Loved it !!!"}
{"text":"Im giving it a three because the burger was okay and the seating was terrible. 

We came on a Sunday around 12, the line thankfully wasn't out the door. But at the start of the door lmao. Line went by pretty quickly, now came the quest to find seating! Stood around and stalked some people, food was ready about two minutes after so perfect timing. 

We all got the Shack Burger. My boyfriends mom (Korean momma) loved the burger. She asked how others places competed with this place  

The burger, for me personally, doesn't compare to in n out. The bun is soft vs the crisp bun at in n out. The sauce also didn't really taste like anything to me. I'm hard hating, but the crinkle fries were good ? 

My second time here, and I don't think I'll be coming back"}
{"text":"We were wondering where to eat my daughter suggested  Shake Shack. My wife is not a big burger fan but she was game. To start  off we had to pay $20 for parking  at New York  New  York  because of some event. But I  was like this place better be worth it and yes it was above my expectations  and my wife was happy as well. She had the shroom burger and I  the chicken  burger, fries were delicious and crispy my daughter's  burgers were great as well. Thanks again Shake Shack customer  service and food was definitely top notch."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! The burgers tasted so fresh! It is a little expensive because you have to buy the fries and drinks separate but it was good!"}
{"text":"My family LOVES burger places!!!  We are all regulars at In/Out and were excited to see what the Shake Shack was all about.  Our decision?  It was just ok for us--out of the five of us, only two would want to come back.  Personally, I thought the first bite was amazing--especially the fresh bun (was that a Hawaiian roll?).  But three or four bites in, the grease becomes a little much and it gets heavy.  The fries and shakes were also just ok for us--nothing over the top (in our humble opinion).  Nobody panic, we ate every morsel (and then felt guilty because of the grease) and nothing was wasted.  

We wouldn't throw them out of bed for eating crackers, but we aren't in a race to go back.  LOL Glad we tried though!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack still reigns supreme in the world of fast casual burgers. Their shack sauce and cheese fries can turn a bad day into a good day with one bite. 

Mom rating: 5/5 I have an infant and their restrooms are impeccably clean and well stocked and their changing table had liners provided as well. I do wish they had changing tables in the mens room as well. As a parent of a child who will soon be trying table foods they have high chairs and provide a clean comfortable environment for the little ones."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is everything I want out of a fast causal burger. I still consider it a fast food burger although some people think the price point takes it out of that category. 

So here's the deal I've been going to shake shack since their OG location in NYC and it's just as delicious as that day 1 bite. Their smoky shack sauce, perfect cheese sauce paired with crinkle cut fries and the potato bun puts their burger in another league compared to InAndOut.  There is nothing anyone can say that will ever change my mind about this burger. We are a family of die hard shake shackers 4 life. 

Mom Rating is 5/5 for self serve water, \"kid friendly food\", high chairs, and a changing table in the bathroom. 

Sigh I Love you Shake Shake never change"}
{"text":"Now I never have to move back to NYC. When I heard Shake Shack would be opening a location in NYNY I patiently waited for months to be reunited with the best burger ever. In and Out can't compete the burger, the bun,  it's all way better. The crinkle cut cheese fries are phenomenal. Who am I kidding everything is great. 

Yea there are lines and wait can sometimes be long but it's worth it, it will always be worth it. 

Do yourself a favor drive to the strip and grab a burger but note the date and time, because you will remember this burger forever."}
{"text":"Now don't get me wrong, the food is fine. And that hurts considering the taste/price ratio. Omfg it's such a ripoff.

The burger is mediocre. Not as flavorful as In N Out, and quite small. I got the double and it was cooked very well, but the overall burger lacked good flavor and mouthfeel. 

Now, the fries and custard are fantastic. Absolutely perfect. However, Shake Shack is known as a burger joint. They should ditch the burgers and sell fries and custard only.

After the meal I felt ripped off. And this is the reason I don't frequent Five Guys. If I want to spend that much on a burger I'll go to Flemings and get a steakhouse burger with oozing, dripping flavor. 

And a note. This location ran out of \"shack sauce.\"
How the hell do you run out of your special sauce? 
Pretty lame. 

All in all, try it once then head out to In N Out and feed your entire family with better tasting burgers for 20% of the cost."}
{"text":"I was so excited when Shake Shack opened in vegas. Came here on a Friday night expecting there to be a long line but surprisingly there was no line at all. 

Ordered the Shack burger with bacon and also added onions to it. I really liked the burger but I didn't like the bun, it got soggy really fast and soaked up the juices from the patty. 

Shackmeister burger: meh this was just okay, kinda plain it was just a cheeseburger with fried shallots in it,  wouldn't order this next time 

Cheese fries: this was way too cheesy for me, wiped off majority of the cheese"}
{"text":"Dog friendly, they even have a menu just for them which includes the custard. Nice employees, burgers are really good and the place is clean. A bit pricey for what you get but it's a fun place."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I have visited the first shake shack that opened in the State, so it was nice to re-visit the flavors of the burgers amongst other things. This location based in the Kierland Commons shopping center. This place stands alone in the area offering the delicacy of a good ole' fashion burgers , shakes, hot dogs etc. 
I had to go with the classic shake shack burger and the famous Crinkle cut fries . The flavor and freshness of the burger is tasty. I do also like how the bun is connected to keep the burger and it's condiments intact from getting sloppy. Fries are so crunchy and freshly cut . All I have to say being a NY chain never hurts coming from a native New Yorker . Cheers."}
{"text":"When it comes to new age healthier burger joints, this place is the spot! Being from New York really nice to have a spot that is nostalgic. The brooklyn ale was refreshing since cant get anywhere else in phoenix"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers. The pepper sauce is amazing and the buns are perfect. The local shakes are just so so, especially considering the price, but I go for the burgers. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Like everyone else, I had to see what the hype was about regarding Shake Shack. I had a late night burger craving and missed the crowd, arriving between 9-10pm. It only took a few minutes to order our food and we waited around 10 minutes to receive it once ordered. We both ordered the shake shack burger with our own custom toppings and included the shake shack sauce. With fries and large drinks, we spent around $30.00 for two people. Eh, on the price. I was impressed both with the presentation of the burger and taste! The shake sauce is definitely a must try, at least on the side if you're skeptical. The fries were crispy and hot and the burgers ingredients tasted fresh. Do I think what I received is worth $30.00, I would air on the side of not really; however it's an experience you have to try at least once. If I ordered shakes with my meals I would say yes! I made the mistake of not trying their shakes my first time around, I won't make that mistake my next go round but I have no doubt this isn't the last shake shack has seen of me!"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband for a late night dinner after a show. Service was great, food was delicious, and the atmosphere was nice. Our milkshake was super good. Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"I've heard of the shake shack of being a popular and hip fast food place. So my family and I tried it for dinner while walking on the strip. My sister and I shared a chicken sandwich, fries, and lemonade. The chicken sandwich was very good, maybe better than Chick-Fil-A's sandwich in comparison. However, the fries and lemonade were just lacking in flavor and consistency. The fries weren't as crispy as I like and the lemonade had such a weird synthetic taste to it.

If you're on a budget and want decent fast food, this place is okay for that purpose. To me, it just didn't live up to its hype."}
{"text":"Shake shack seems to be the popular east coast burger chain like in n out on the west coast. A must try if you happen to be in Vegas!

Line tends to walk out the door but it goes by quickly. If it's your first time I highly recommend the Shack Stack. It's a combo of their cheeseburger + shroom burger. The portobello mushroom is fried crisply and filled with melted cheese. The buns are unique bc they're soft and eggy. 

Frozen custard was practically melted like the one I had in New York :-( The weekly flavor was strawberry almond.

Taste is comparable to the chain in New York but everything was slightly more salty and the fries a bit oily. I would be back for the burgers!"}
{"text":"I heard so much hype about this place. but unfortunately it was disappointing. The burgers are pricey and doesn't taste good at all. They have so many employees and yet the food took about 20 mins."}
{"text":"So freaking delicious. 

I came here two days in a row during my vegas trip because it's THAT GOOD. Order the SHACK STACK. It's a deep fried portobello mushroom stuffed with muenster cheese inside your burger and it's perfect. It's unique, something you can't find at just any other burger joint. Also, they have root beer on draft. BEST. ROOT BEER. EVER. 

ugh, my mouth is watering from just writing this review. Thank gawd I don't have to fly to the east coast to have this again!"}
{"text":"I've been to Shake Shack before in Las Vegas. I didn't really care for it then but I have changed my mind! I've been waiting for the long line to get in to order to die down before I made an attempt at dining here. Luckily, I came by after work and only had to wait about 7 minutes before my order was taken. If you don't know what you want to eat, I would suggest grabbing a paper copy of their menu because it's difficult to see the entire menu while waiting in line. It's usually blocked by other people standing in line waiting to order. The line moved quickly even though the restaurant was extremely crowded. I got my food to go because it was so crowded and loud. There was about a 15 minute wait for my food after I ordered which I was a little disappointed in having to wait so long for a burger and a milkshake but it was a busy night.  I ordered the single shack burger with cheese and added onions. It was delicious. Nice and juicy. I didn't even make it out of the parking lot before I dived face first into my burger. I had a limited edition milkshake that was amazing! I don't remember the exact name but it tastes like coffee, chocolate and mints. I can't wait to go back and try out some more items in their menu. It's going to be hard to beat their Shack burger though!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing burger. Soft butter buns and very tasteful meet...no condiments required. Not too big but very satisfying. Need to bring husband here as this will set a new bar for hamburgers. 

Lines are long but extremely fast and efficient service. Hard to find sitting area so it's best to divide and conquer: scout tables and order food."}
{"text":"Pretty good place!  Great area....Had a group of 9 so took a little wait, but was really good.  Smaller burgers and my chicken sandwich was really small, but tasty.  Fries are good.  Great staff"}
{"text":"3 and a half star here at most.  Good burger, but doesn't deserve 5 stars.  Nice environment and nice set up.  Workers are still learning."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it. Affordable place on the overpriced strip. We snuck in for a quick bite and were pleasantly surprised with our burgers and crinkle cut fries. Nice ambience and vibe for a burger place. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"At first I was disappointed because their prices were a little high for burgers, and their fries looked like crinkle cut fries you'd buy frozen at the grocery store. Boy was I wrong! When I tasted their food, OMG... It was sooo good. Til this day, I can't stop talking about how good their food is.

My party ordered:

Smoke Shack Burger $6.69
Regular Fries $2.95
Cheese Fries $3.95
Shack Stack Burger $9.49
Shack Burger $5.19

I actually liked their Shack Burger the best. But, all their burgers are juicy & delicious. I love the burger buns as it reminds me of the Hawaiian bread that I love. And their fries, those were my fav!!! I don't know what seasoning they use, but it tasted so yummy, & they fried them perfectly for me - well done fries that's crispy on the outside. 

Although they accidentally mixed up our order, they were very apologetic, and the manager took the initiative to hand deliver our correct order to us. The staff were very helpful as well.

I seriously can't wait to go back... This has actually become my new favorite burger joint!"}
{"text":"Updating a previous review. I must have caught them on off nights the first couple times because our third visit was a great success. Food was good (I had the smoke house) and the customer service had improved big time. Will most likely be back."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of hype for this place so I decided to give it a try. It was really good. I would put this place right behind inn n out. Hopefully they open up some chains in socal."}
{"text":"My husband and I were first timers here the other day. We went with two of our closest friends after the RiSE Festival. It was incredibly delicious and definitely hit the spot! We had the 2 stack shack burger, 1 stack smoke house burger, fries, chocolate shake, and a hot dog with cheese sauce smothered on it. Everything tasted sooooo good! We definitely can't wait to go back for more! Until next time Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"I've only been to one Shake Shack and this is the one. The hype was all justified with one bite into the beefy-bacony goodness off this amazing fast-casual experience.

If you're curious about it, just go. Now."}
{"text":"After getting the chance to try Shake Shack, I would say In and Out has my heart all the way. I would never cheat on you - In and Out ever again. Well maybe for the cheese fries ( I want more of those damn fries) and maybe the Shake Stack ( I didn't get the chance to try this burger). 

I tried the Smoke Stack which is a cheeseburger topped with all natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and shack sauce, and it was good, but not memorable compared to In and Out's burgers. The burger was even smaller than In and Out's burgers and the price was about three times more than what you would pay at In and Out. My friends warned me that the burgers were not that impressive at Shake Shack and they were right. However, their cheese fries was a winner. I loved the combination of the warm nacho cheese on their crinkle fries.

I also tried their strawberry shake, which is quite delicious, but I did not care for the price. To me, the burgers and shakes at Shake Shack is just too overpriced and I would stick to In and Out any day. 

Also, lines are long!!! Thank god, my amazing friends were willing to grab Shake Shack while my lazy butt was in the hotel watching Rush Hour. Be prepared to wait in line and don't go while hungry."}
{"text":"I see hipsters everywhere!  Lol the first thing I noticed after the huge billboard menu was the crowd! The line was almost out the door with. I've heard alot about shake shake and me being the burger fiend I am had to check it out. I had the shake stack burger, it was tasty!  The patty on the burger was by far the tastiest I've had compared to other fast food/ burger joints."}
{"text":"This strip side shake shack is pretty darned good . The cherry peppers on the smoke shack make the burger in my opinion .  The crinkle cut fries with liquid cheddar are really good too. The line went fast and the burger came out within 10 minutes. This might be my favorite fast casual burger chain nowadays .  Patio seating is great for people watching on the strip. Overall a good spot especially when hungover !!"}
{"text":"I have ONE gripe about this place...
They don't give enough cheese with their cheese fries. I'm trying to be fat, and I enjoy some fries with my cheese! Help me out here, Shake Shack!

Other than that, I absolutely do enjoy their burgers, fries, and shakes. The price is just fine for what you're getting, maybe a little more than it should be due to location, but I still find it worth it when I make my way here."}
{"text":"AI got the cheeseburger (single), fries, and a drink.  It was ok.  All the portions look small and the taste was very average.  The burger was a burger.  Fries was fries.  But the service from the staff was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is the best! Amazing burgers and Chicago dogs.. Their French fries and also amazing and they have this garlic mayonnaise...BOMB! Can't really explain why this place is so good, it just is!"}
{"text":"Very delicious burger - might have been because we were starving when we went there...the patty was flavorful with texture.  Prices a bit on the steep side, but still worth it!"}
{"text":"Being born and raised in California I have been brainwashed that In n' Out has the best burger and fries.  However, the moment I took a bite into the soft buns of the Shake Shack cheese burger my mind has changed. In addition, the fries with gooey cheese sauce and the sweet milkshake adds onto my positive Shake Shack experience. 

Pros: 
- Lots of places to sit

Cons:
- Pricey compared to other burger joints

I would definitely recommend one to try Shake Shack at least one try in their lifetime. Come on now, who can deny soft buns!"}
{"text":"Great burgers!  Totally reminds me of my time living in New York.  I used to hit the shake shack in Grand central station at least twice a week. 
Great place!!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting forever for this place to be in AZ!!! So happy it's here! Buttery goodness in a bun the holds it all together (it's still attached in the back). Jared (manager) was so awesome! Not only is the food bomb.com but the service on a crazy opening day was amazing! 

Everyone was making sure that we were satisfied with our food and that everything was right. Felt like I was at an Apple store. They got the details right from the food to the actual location. Simple, elegant, and delicious both to be taken by mouth and visually. 

Love this place!!! We will be making the drive from Mesa more often now. This was the only real pregnancy craving my wife had, she is more than satisfied! I just hope they open up a location in the east valley!

Thanks again Jared!"}
{"text":"VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY! and now i can't stop eating here. 

The location on the strip is actually very fast to get through the line and get your food. I order a double \"shroom\" (fried mushroom patty) burger with cheese and fries... i can't stop thinking about it. I have absolutely no complaints. I actually tried them for the first time at a food festival (i think the employees were from the greenvalley location) and they were kind enough to make me a grilled cheese since they didn't have an vegetarian options so i'm pretty happy with shake shack all around."}
{"text":"Food was good. Better than In-N-Out? Well, that's debatable. When considering price, I'll stick with In-N-Out. Salted Caramel malt shake flavoring was too strong to enjoy, like drinking concentrate. Fries are better than In-N-Out, but I don't like natural fries. Go figure. Docked stars due to price. Would have been less than half this price at In-N-Out."}
{"text":"I think this place is overrated. The burger is okay, the shake is not bad, but it's simply not worth the long lines. I personally am just as happy eating Fatburger or In N Out in Los Angeles... so if the wait is long there are plenty of other places I would try to go eat at in Vegas outside of Shake Shake."}
{"text":"Very popular burger joint right on the strip. Burgers are small but flavorful, fries are frozen crinkle cuts that could be better, and the shakes are pretty good and there's a good selection. They also have draft beer which was a plus."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place in NYC, but did not get the chance, so when I saw it in Vegas, thought I see what all the rave was about. The burgers were not bad. It was pretty small.  The line looks long, but it moves fast.  They also is a section where you can just have water with your food instead of buying their drinks.  I thought these burgers were going to blow my mind, but they didnt. The extra star is for having a a cocktail drinks menu."}
{"text":"LOCATION
The location is just outside of the Park and the Tmobile arena.  Convenient and beautiful. 

ATMOSPHERE 
It's a pub feel and nicely lit.  

FOOD
Delicious!  I had the mushroom burger.  Surprise!  The mushroom is crusted and loaded with cheese that oozes out after the first bite.  The size is average, but filling nonetheless. The crinkle cut fries are not my favorite.  Special brews of beer and wine available.  The white wine was good.   

SERVICE 
Order as you walk in, seat yourself and pick up your food. 

OVERALL
Nice place to go to and the burger was top notch!"}
{"text":"Food tasted like microwaved school lunch. Overhyped and overpriced. Place closed at 11pm rather than the 2am time posted on here. Only good thing was the service"}
{"text":"I came here out of excitement after heading about the new York location on an NPR special. I got their mushroom vegetarian burger abd was unimpressed. The mushroom wasnt very meaty and it was overly cheesy. I waited about 30 minutes to receive my dish which was about 5 times longer than my husband's burger. I would have preferred a burger over the taste of my mushroom burger. The only saving grace was a 32 ounce side in a souvenir cup."}
{"text":"Great envoirnment. Long lines on the weekends, but that's a given since it's centrally located on the strip in front of New York New York hotel/Casino. Go for the Burgers, fries and the different shakes! Great for a hot sweltering day to cool off!"}
{"text":"I recommend the veggie 'shroom burger!! If you like a bit of heat, you can ask them to put chilies in your burger for free! They have so many options for shakes-- will have to go back to try all of them. I really like their French fries which taste even better with melted cheese on top of it! Great place for vegetarians!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the newly opened Shake Shack. My husband and I waited in line during lunch rush for about 15 minutes. A nice worker gave us a menu to peruse while we waited.
Once we were just about in the front door, we had to wait for her to tell us when we could proceed to the inside line. The menu is big and visible on the wall near the registers.
We finally made it to the front and placed our order for the Smoke Shack single cheeseburger meal with an order of crinkle cut cheese fries, a Coke and a Root Beer Float. We were given a restaurant pager and we had a seat at a nice, big booth. It would be another 15 minutes until our order was ready.
My husband went up to get it. Once he was seated, we checked out our food and dived into it. It was very good, hot, fresh, delicious.
I think Shake Shack sets itself apart from other burger shops in that it's concept is on using only the freshest and highest quality meat and vegetables, and home made frozen custard. 
The service was good and the people friendly despite it being newly opened.
I recommend everyone give them a try."}
{"text":"I had read about Danny Meyer's concept ever since it was a  food cart at Madison park NYC  ( I have been a huge fan of union  square cafe and gramercy tavern). So I was really curious to what the hype was about

Shake shack is very mediocre and pricey for what it is. My burger was a thin over cooked patty sloppily put together. The fries were ok (crispy crinkle cuts) but the cheese sauce was pretty flavorless and gloppy.

Chicken sandwich ( a rather new addition) was better than the burger. The crunchy breast was crispy and tender.

Shakes , which are made with frozen custard, are okay. Plenty of flavors and monthly specials but they are not amazing at all.  

Two sandwiches,  one order cheese fries, two shakes and a cup of frozen custard: $40 bucks...not cheap

This location is great in summerlin and the interior is very nice but for the price I would rather go to In-N-Out, five guys, or fuku burger."}
{"text":"WHACK SHACK. Sorry but this place is all hype. I would rather go to White Castle or better yet, In-n-Out. Got the Smokehouse burger which wasnt juicy at all. Meat was waaayy lacking in flavor. Ordered the fries with cheese on it which wasnt too bad. To drink i had the cold brew. The idea of iced coffee sounded amazing in that awful heat. When i recieved my refreshing beverage, I was horribly disappointed with the fact that they dont provide any sort of creamer. Not sure if thats what they do over in the east coast but it was pretty unbearable. I just sucked it up and chugged that chalk water."}
{"text":"Burgers burgers burgers all around.

Heard about Shake Shack here and there in various food lists, and decided to stop by during my Vegas trip this past weekend.  Is the burger delicious? Why yes, it is!  Was it worth the price? Not really. Perhaps once or twice, but definitely way too pricey for what it is: burger, fries, and a shake.  Which, will need to be ordered separately (no combo deals here).

The black & white shake was supposedly the most popular, so I tried that. Wasn't really feeling it, but then again, I'm not much of a shake person.

The cheesy fries were delicious. Then again, cheese makes anything delicious! 

One double burger, cheesy fries, and shake for about $20.

Donate $2 for a voucher that you can redeem at your next visit for a free shake.

Located next to New York New York."}
{"text":"Okay, this is my confession. We went yesterday and drove back again today. From Chandler! 
The cheese on the fries is astounding. Hamburgers taste so fresh and juicy. The strawberry lemonade with mint was perfect. 

On to the service. Friendly people. Refills gladly given. We got one burger that had more toppings on it than one of us wanted. They brought out another one to us promptly. They said we could keep the wrong one rather than throw it away. 

I'm torn between wishing they were in Chandler and being glad they aren't!. I think we'd eat there too often."}
{"text":"I must say these are some great burgers. The staff members are very courteous. The facility is very unique. Upscale. Wonderful atmosphere. I thourally enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I was very looking forward to try this place. Only to be greeted with a very wired person. I said hello twice, she did not responded at all, I thought she was muted. No facial reaction at all! Like a robot! Did not say anything back to me until the order was finished. That is not a very good staff training! At least you have to say 'hello' back! Just basic etiquette! Bottom line, staff not friendly and service not good!

We ordered the shack stack, the chicken burger and the cheese fries with bacon. The size of the burgers were smaller than I thought. I thought the meat and chicken were bigger. But they were quite tasty just not as good as I expected form what I see all the pictures on yelp. The cheese fries was good but they don't give you enough cheese sauce to cover the whole fries. Bottom line, worth a try but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"I'd only been in Vegas for about an hour and decided to have a shake burger w/onions,fries and a Diet Coke and it was served (after about a 4-5 minute wait which is just fine w/me) very hot and delicious!!! It's a little expensive tho for a fast food meal , $12 something with tax(which drives me crazy cus there isn't a sales tax in Oregon ) but the burger was very good. I've never had a SS burger anywhere else so I'm guessing you pay more for being on the strip, just like for everything else..."}
{"text":"Super pricey for just burgers and fries . Food is good.  A little greasy though. Shakes are awesome!"}
{"text":"February 15, 2015

First meal for our Valentine Getaway!  Reason the boyfriend planned this trip was for me to get my most beloved burger from my most beloved burger spot in New York! 

The Shack Burger was the best! The cheese fries was the most delicious fries ever! I also had their mango lemonade and I was in love! 

I'm so happy that there is finally a Shake Shack close to California! Granted, we had to drive to Vegas for it, but close enough, right? 

FYI: we came here twice before we left Vegas and on our last day, immediately after eating our Excalibur Buffet, we drove right over for our Burgers TO GO. Yeah, we had to get our burgers to take back to California and enjoy it at home. We got three, and it made it home safely without us scarfing them down our throats! It took a lot of will power for us to fight our temptations."}
{"text":"I had the bacon cheeseburger and the \"shack\"-ago dog (their rendition of a Chicago dog). I also tried one of my friends' frozen custards and cheese fries. The food itself is quite good and the employees are very friendly. The restaurant is clean and everything is pretty much as it should be. Four stars as I feel the food was quite good but not excellent... Something was missing that I couldn't put my finger on.

Regardless- check it out!"}
{"text":"Omgoshhhhhhhhhhhhh. I think I found a burger joint that can possibly be better then In N Out. Yeah that good. I got the double shake shack and it was out of this world! The buns are so buttery and the party is absolutely seasoned to perfection and melts in your mouth. Safe to say it is the best burger I've ever had. Loved everything about it and I can't wait to return and try other menu items. I also had the molten pie custard ice cream and it was just what you need after a good burger."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a little biased as a Californian, but Shake Shack did not live up to its hype. 

Having eaten at Burgr a couple days before, the basic shack burger was just not good, especially for a burger over 5 bucks. My burger was dry and just not that great. 

Cheese fries were executed well though. Crinkle fries were surprisingly crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. 

Shake Shack's offerings are pretty much like In and Out, except their burgers are a little fancier and their shakes have real ice cream.

This location does have ample seating and great staff though. They'd walk by collecting trays and asking if everything was okay."}
{"text":"Lots of flavor in such a small package but severely over priced to be expected from a chain started in New York the the burgers are delicious but I like a meaty burger and I felt very cheated not much meat and overloaded with cheese. The fries are great but make sure you get the cheese sauce on the side it cools and thickens very quick and taste terrible when it does"}
{"text":"1st time here and I was not disappointed , I order the chick n shack and must I say it was very delicious the chicken was so crispy it was the best can't wait to go back to try the shack stack"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Stick with In N Out. Things were expensive compared to what you were getting. I dont mind paying for things, but when you pay more the quality better be there and it ended up being severely lacking. I don't understand what all of the hype is around this place. It was pretty bland and nothing near special. The line was pretty long, and they only had one cashier on the registers. Wont be coming back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I was an In-n-Out girl, but this year I moved and there's not an In-n-Out close by but there is a Shake Shack. I have to say, I've been converted. Sure the prices are a big higher than In-n-Out but Shake Shack has consistently good fries (In-n-Out's are hit and miss), the dining area is much nicer, and you don't have those crazy lines to deal with."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed!! Disappointed that we don't have one here in San Francisco. It's also disappointing that I only got a single not double! Wtf was I thinking??

I got the shack burger, which is a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and I added onions. You have to ask for the onions. One of the best burgers I've had in a while! I love eating burgers that drips burger juice everywhere!! 

There cheese fries were excellent! Every single bite there was cheese!!!

Don't get me started on the coffee shake! O-M-G!! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"We don't have a lot of Shake Shacks here on the West Coast. Only 2 here in Vegas and one in West Hollywood, CA. Obviously, nothing can get better than In & Out Burgers lol. But....I love how Shake Shack offers different items on the menu: friendly to meat eaters, to vegetarians, to those who do not eat red meat but can eat poultry & sausages.

They have an extensive menu offering items such as chicken sandwiches (MY FAVE!) to frozen custards to chicago hot dogs. Since we were already here, we pretty much ordered everything on the menu. Kinda felt bad for the lady at the counter for being so patient with our indecisive selves.

What We Ordered: 

* Chicken Sandwich: THIS WAS DELICIOUS! The chicken inside was juicy, crunchy, and flavorful. Now I know why it's a favorite. I did appreciate how they did not skimp on the veggies.

* Mushroom Burger: For all you vegetarians out there, this one is for you! This is basically a fried portobello mushroom in place of a meat patty. Bit don't be fooled! It's delicious!

* Original Burger w/ Fried Mushroom: Best of both worlds all in one bite. So glad my cousin ordered this, it gave me a chance to keep taking samples haha. The meat patty itself has a good flavor. The bun is very moist & soft. I's order this again.

* Chicago Dog: Not bad. Haven't had an orginal Chicago Dog so I can't really vouch on its authenticity. But I would stick with the burgers if you're not much of a hotdog person.

* Pie Cement: Frozen custard mixed with their pie of the day. It's decadent & rich. Do not consume if you are on a diet or if you are lactose intolerant haha.

Fries: Basic. Still like In & Out's hand cut fries.

Verdict? All in all, I'm glad to have finally gotten the chance to try Shake Shack. I'd definitely go back on my next trip to Vegas. However, I did knock one star down for the price. For 4 people, I spent $89. Well I guess with the amount of items we ordered it would be understandable. But $89 is high for fast food."}
{"text":"Takes just like the shake shack in New York! My favorite burgers. Very flavorful burgers and cheese fries are a MUST!!!"}
{"text":"This is another go to spot for me for a late night snack depending on what my husband and I are feeling like eating. Also if my kids are with us this is probably a place we consider going to. 

I like how they updated the outside next to Shake Shack. It does look a lot nicer by since its right by the stadium now. But during the day this place gets packed pretty quick. It makes it a bit difficult to find seats when you have a family. But in the later evenings it's not so bad so you aren't looking for an open table like everyone else. I actually prefer coming in the evening to avoid the hassle.

Service has always been ok. It's not bad but not superb either. I've been to the other shake shack off the strip where they were extremely nice to me and my kids so this location just has ok service. 

The food is always good. It always tastes fresh. But there are times I feel like my burger comes out a bit sloppy. I think what my husband likes most is that instead of the advertisements of all their locations on their tv, they now play the games on tv so it makes it more entertaining for him. Overall it's ok. Not bad not great just ok.

{"text":"Delicious food. Try the shack hot dog. It's awesome. The wait was a bit long, but overall good experience."}
{"text":"Dude! Shake Shack is so good. This may be sacrilegious to say, but Shake Shack is almost as good as In N Out... Definitely more expensive, that's for sure, but you're getting some real high quality burgers.

I got the SmokeShack burger, which is jam-packed with bacon, cherry peppers, and a delicious Shake Shacksauce. Sooo yummy! And at the perfectly satisfying size. However, the Double Down Fries (which are dressed exactly like my burger: crinkle-cut fries loaded w/ bacon, cherry peppers, etc.) were a little underwhelming... I know what you're thinking -- getting them anyway was my boyfriend's idea! Anyway, I wish they had some other crazy fries to choose from."}
{"text":"Great burger and concrete was best ever.

Knock down for slow, but worth the wait. It exceeds what it is cracked up to be."}
{"text":"Finally another shake...came here for the soft open.  Fries were crispy, just the way I like it.  I ordered a bacon cheese burger plain, excellent!  They had a nice lady walking around asking if we wanted water...nice touch!  I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I hate to give Shake Shack anything less than 5 stars as I love their burgers and shakes but hear me out. 

I used their mobile app to place an order 3 hours ahead of time and it was a disaster. The food wasn't ready until about 10 minutes after the scheduled time and even then, they had forgotten my shake, which added another 3-4 minutes. It seems like there is a disconnect between the mobile app ordering process and the staff. They asked me where my buzzer was and I explained I had a mobile order and they looked at me like I was an alien. 

When I did get my food, it was glorious as always! I got the double shack burger and Cinnamon Dulce de Leche shake and it was as if the angels from above had prepared it special just for me. 

I don't want to bash my beloved Shake Shack but my advice is to steer clear of the online ordering through the app for now. It'll be faster going through the line - no matter how long it is."}
{"text":"Good burger but not a fan of the shack sauce....too creamy and mayonnaisee for me.  Other than that, tasty spot for a quality burger and fries. The custard is excellent too. ...a bit  pricey though."}
{"text":"Some people have really hyped this place up. It was decent at best. I actually like Five Guys, or In N Out better, but I gave it a good try. I came here with my friends after catching a movie and I ordered a Single Shack Burger. The burger was very greasy when it came out, but it wasn't half bad. I tried my girlfriend french fries and I guess maybe I'm not a fan of criss cut fries, because they didn't taste any better than the ones you can put in the oven at home. I should have tried a milkshake here since they're well known for them, but I wasn't that hugnry this time around and just wanted to try the burger. The staff was incredibly famous and the place was clean, but I just wasn't blown away by the burger. I would definitely try it again down the line and try a shake, so I get the full experience."}
{"text":"Shake Shack originates from Madison Square Park in NYC. Anyone familiar with the chain knows they always have a line because they serve great burgers, cheese fries and shakes. I grew up with In N Out but lived in NYC for 6 years, and while I don't like comparing the two, I like both for different reasons. Yes, Shake Shack is more expensive compared to In N Out, but you get a different burger, totally different fries, and more options on shakes and malts (plus they have treats for your pup). 

This location is outside the New York New York hotel and has the same look as all the other Shake Shacks. There's an express line outside for drinks only, with full orders taken inside. There's lots of seating inside and out, with TV screens all throughout the interior. Get the shack burger, cheese fries and any of their shakes. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is the rage right now, located in the new park area.  There is always a line, and they move at a good speed.  Gives you time to look at the menu and figure out what you want?  We stupidly shared the delish Shroom Burger, fries and a 24 oz. Brooklyn beer.  Why do I say were dumb?  Well, we didn't know for $7.50, the Shroom burger would be so small?  It was freaking good, but not what normal burger size usually is.  Fries were okay.  What did redeem the place is their vanilla custard, a must try.  We tried dessert a separate day and so happy we did.

Found out that local to my area, they will be opening a Shake Shack in Palo Alto.  I'm hoping that the prices will be lower so I can enjoy the cheesy veggie burger that just melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"As a true Californian it pains me to say this, but... it was delicious! Don't get me wrong... I'm still a hard core in-n-out lover, but shake shack was still very good. I know the rivalry between the two chains, but I went in with an open mind, and I loved it! I'm definitely making a trip to the new LA location when I have a shake shack craving"}
{"text":"Las hamburguesas bastante buenas , sin embargo un poco caras para el producto. Lo mejor del restaurant son las malteadas , en especial la All Shack, tiene un sabor a vainilla exquisito. Buena localización en medio del Hotel New York."}
{"text":"With all the burger places that are around that are much better than this place. The fries are good the poor hot dog is nothing like Chicago Chicago never Grill the hot dog in its life I'm from there. And where's the seeds on the bun. This shake is Tiny for 550 is ridiculous and $0.50 extra for whipped cream. Dairy Queen across the street you can get for them for that same price. The double burger would be the same as a double double at In-N-Out at half the price period and a better taste. Thought I would give it a try not worth the hype you tried and you say I'm sure you'll be disappointed too. For the price we paid for dinner we could have got to filet mignons at AJ's and cook them at home and had a wonderful dinner"}
{"text":"first time i had food here, usually just get the ice cream which is fantastic but kinda pricey
so i had the dbl hamburger and it was soooo good! juicy meat you can tell its not preformed frozen patties, nice amt of saltiness didnt have to add any other seasoning, toasted bun and those tasty pickles ( i forget what they are called)  but omg it was perfect and totally worth the $7 :)))))"}
{"text":"Tried this place because I see it often on my Instagram feed. I can't say much more than its all hype. The food was okay, nothing special. The house beer though was delicious. I rather go to Five Guys or In and Out. Totally not worth the wait and money. The shakes were overly sweet and not for me. I have a sweet tooth but it was too sweet that I couldn't drink it. It's a pretty place but nothing to rave about. Maybe I need to try it in New York?"}
{"text":"All that drinking, gambling, and clubbing will make you hungry. You're gonna want this... more so when you're drunk. But still good when you're sober. 

Do I dare say that I like the fries better than In N Out fries?!?! I think I just did. California's gonna hate me. 

Portion size was just enough for me and if you get a shake, hopefully you brought a friend (or maybe even one you just met on the dance floor) - because those are filling! I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"First time at Shake Shack, and tragically for me, probably the last time for awhile. My friend wanted to come here, and at first I was thinking to myself \"why come to Vegas and eat at a chain restaurant?\" 

The simple answer. Because it's fucking good! 
A little on the pricier side for a fast food establishment, but you really are paying for the quality in this case. Beef is supremely good for a fast food establishment. Obviously very fresh, which is sadly more than you can say for most in the same category. I got cheese fries, expecting some sort of bagged ordeal melted on top. My friends, this is a nacho cheese type smothering your fries. It feels very middle school-esque but in the most positive way possible. 


Variety wise? Nothing ground breaking. It's pretty simple in terms of what they offer. I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to make it here again. But it seriously surpassed my expectations. 

If I were you, I'd check out another location unless you are staying directly on the strip. It was busy, and is likely consistently busy. Even so, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food was good. The wait is insane though! Would be nice if you didn't have to wait in line for 20 min and then place your order and then wait an extra 20 min for food. Would love to see their line waits go down."}
{"text":"Food was good. Ordered the original cheeseburger and a smoke shack burger with cheese fries and a beer float + peanut butter shake. 

Maybe I'm just a fatty, but honestly.......the portions are TOO SMALL here. The burgers are all around $5-7 but they are the size of my palm and I could eat them in like 3 bites....I came here for the experience though. I wanted to see what the hype was all about. Maybe the one in New York is better??? The taste was very good though. It's just so crowded here and the portions are so small. 

BUT the peanut butter shake was so so so good. I wish it came in a bigger cup!!! The beer float was just okay...my friend and I just ate the custard that was in there - mmmm!"}
{"text":"Boom!   Great burgers, good, hot, crinkle cut French Fries and milk shakes!  This place would get 5 stars if the menu items were just a little less expensive.
I ordered the shack burger, fries, a regular size diet coke, and a small shake and it was almost $20."}
{"text":"Shake Shack seems to have more buzz than its worth but if you are looking for just a good burger it is worth the visit. 

I am a fan of burgers in general and was hungry so here I was. I ordered up the ShackBurger with cheese and fries. It was awesome. The patty practically melts in your mouth. I hardly put it down and just kept taking bite after bite until it was devoured. The krinkle fries were also very good. 

This is a touristy area with the Park near by and T-Mobile arena. The vibe is fun with games out front and great people watching. Its not slightly back from the street so you don't feel overly crowded. 

Getting in there will be a line but it moves quickly. Drinks are self serve except beer and wine they will take care of. After you order you get a pager that flashes and buzzes for your pick up. Pretty easy process actually but do know what you want to order by the time you get to the register because there is no menu over their head like most places. It's actually on the entrance line from the front door.

Food is good, atmosphere is fun and open. I would come back if staying in the NY NY or hotels adjacent."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed.  The burger was tasty but not amazing and the fries were hit and crispy but again...not amazing. With all the hype I expected to be wowed."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with really nice seating and ambiance I just am not really a fan of what I ordered. 

I got the shack stack which had a deep fried portobello mushroom  and burger patty. This had so much hype in my mind be cause I love mushroom burgers but this didn't really appeal to me as much, the cheese filling on the mushroom might have been a little overwhelming. 

I ordered the cheese fries and didn't enjoy them that much. I guess the cheese just wasn't really what I was looking for. Higher quality cheese than your average cheese fries but the texture and flavors weren't my favorite. 

The strawberry shake I got was one of the most basic shakes they have, but it's was super amazing! Great shake, (they better do it right cause it's in their name!) not overly sweet and texture was on point with little pieces of fruit. 

Great spot!!! A lot of seating available and very modern design make this place a cool place to eat, just not really into the burger I got or the cheese fries."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is one of the best burgers in town. Period.  This is saying a ton, as the left coast burger is notoriously In-N-Out territory.  When Shake Shack moved into the neighborhood, I quickly dismissed it as just \"another\" burger joint.  If it wasn't for the massive crowds at the Shake Shack, odds are pretty good that I would not have tried it... I honestly can say I am glad I did.

Their burgers are incredible.  The menu is simple and easy, the delivery is perfect and the first bite is out of this world.  Just typing this and my mouth is watering for a Shake Shack burger...  

My kids love the real hand spun milk shakes, my wife loves their French fries and I am all about the Shake Shack burger.

Shake Shack is conveniently located in the Kierland Commons shopping center.  It is located smack dab in the center of the shopping center.

Expect a decent crowd and line on the weekends.  They are all there for the same reason you are: an incredible burger experience.

I recommend the Shack burger.

There is plenty of parking and the ping pong table comes in handy while you are waiting for your number to be called."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Shake Shack and I was impressed. The burger was tasty and fresh, the fries were delicious and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I was not looking forward to trying this place, but I was pleasantly surprised. 

I had the smoke burger which was awesome and I loved the bacon cheese fries. While I did appreciate the selections of beer that they had available, what I enjoyed the most was the concrete frozen custard. It was so good that we had to go back a second night to get a late night snack.

The only reason that I have this place a 4 instead of a 5 is that the tables were dirty. But luckily we had wetnaps and just wiped the table ourselves."}
{"text":"THE BURGERS ARE BOMB!  I'm not a huge French fry guy but the fries here rock, made with 100% Yukon gold potatoes. Cheese sauce on them is a must.  The cheese sauce is way better than that bright yellow processed cheese sauce that most places use.  The shake is where this place lost a star. Granted I've only had one, the black & white shake. It wasn't good at all. Tasted like Dairy Queen quality, even though it's not.  They claim it's much better quality, which I believe, but it still tastes like nasty Dairy Queen soft serve. Gross!!!!  Hagen Daz and even Johnny Rockets make much better shakes. The frozen custard sounds interesting, I'll have to try it next time.  Portion sizes & price is where they lost another star. This place isn't cheap. I got a single burger, cheese fries, small lemonade, and one small shake for $20. Damn, what happened to the days when all this cost around $10-$12. And this was a small burger and a very small shake."}
{"text":"I have heard so much hype about the \"amazing Shake Shack\" & being a California girl, I have always felt left out. The instant I saw Shake Shack driving down the Strip, it was the only thing I could think about...I knew I had to try it and this was my chance!!! 
Couple hours later I was in line and very happy for the veggie options and got the portobello mushroom burger & the cheese fries. As the buzzer rang and I went to go get my food I was immediately struck by the portions being definitely on the smaller side, I paid 10+ bucks for this, I thought, let's see if the taste makes up for the sizes & long story short I was left underwhelmed.
The burger it's self was decent, the flavor is there - it's very cheesy as the portobello is stuffed with cheese but the buns threw me off and looked very cheap and dry and the veggies inside didn't seem that fresh. The cheese fries were good, covered in a velveeta-like substance, not spectacular in any way shape or form, but good, passable I would say, is the word to describe them.
In summary this place is VERY overhyped, after eating loads of In & Out & Super Duper Burgers...Shake Shack has nothing on either, esp. on Super Duper Burgers. If you want to spend $10 on a burger meal 100% go to Super Duper Burgers if you're in the San Francisco Bay Area and see what real quality burger meal tastes like ( & get the garlic fries and see how cheesy fries should really taste.)"}
{"text":"I don't mind that the burgers are small, but I do mind paying as much as they charge for a small burger. Either way the quality is SPECTACULAR. Everything is fresh and prepared neatly and has really good flavor. They have a great selection on their menu and I love their cheese fries and shakes as well! It's always so fun dining in."}
{"text":"Decent tasting burger but super greasy. If you order protein style (no bun) get lots of napkins. About $14 for a burger, fry and soda. No soda refills and at $2.80 I don't think a refill is asking too much."}
{"text":"I do not get the hype here? Being a NYC person who now resides in San Diego I have had a taste of both Coasts fast food.

This is a place that is hyped up by people who I can only guess are making a McDonalds comparison. Habit and In and Out are just as good if not better. Actually Habit has more offerings and seams fresher.

Fried hot dogs for $4? Gray Papaya in NYC 2 for $2 and blow these away. I had their loaded hot dog and you could barely eat it as it was so soggy after the first bite the toppings were on my plate. Was it tasty? I guess but again nothing ground breaking here. It was a simple hot dog.

It was fairly low cost for Vegas but there is no way I would go out of my way to find this place anywhere else.

Hambergers? Nothing special here at all not even the toppings. Bacon and cheese? Wendy's has had that for 20 years

Hot dogs? I guess creating a creative name like \"Flat Top\" let's you charge $4 for it. Nothing more then a hot dog. 

Fries? Remember those crinkle fries your Mom used to make instead of getting you the ones you wanted from McDonalds? Well here you have them.

Concrete? A poor replica of a Blizzard from DQ at 2xs the price.

People before you make claims about something being the best out there actually get out in the world and do some real world tasting. 

This is for the 20 something with their new overgrown beard who hasn't a clue what good food is. I get the feeling this place was developed in a boardroom by the same bearded group and has nothing to do with actually providing the \"Best Burger\". 

Good deal in Vegas but then again burgers cost $17 at other stores."}
{"text":"A good place to eat, I was not thoroughly impressed for what I got for my money. Would I eat there again? Yes. Would it be the first place on my list? No."}
{"text":"I do not see the hype with this food place. It is average and the burgers are kind of small. The meat is thin and does not have a lot of seasoning. I enjoyed the cheese fries but it was like melted Kraft cheese on top. Even the cheese on my bacon burger was a sauce. I had the Wisconsin cheddar cheese burger. However the cheese was not a melted slice. It was a sauce like fondue from a bottle that was not even warm. Overall I would not come back unless IN N Out was closed."}
{"text":"Burgers are Fantastic!  While I believe burgers are generally fantastic, Shake Shack nails the quick serve/fast food burger.  I had the double SmokeShack and Fries, my wife had a double and fries and two 32oz beers (in souvienier cups) for $53.  Yes the price is a bit high, but we are talking about the Las Vegas Strip and half that price was for the 64oz of Dos Equis.  There wasn't much of a line when we arrived but the dining room was packed.  We waited for a table and were able to snag one before our food came out, people weren't lingering at the tables so don't let the crowded place scare you away.  If you haven't tried Shake Shack and you are thinking of your typical fast food burger joint, or Inn n Out or Dicks (Seattle), you have to try this, its a whole other level!"}
{"text":"They have amazing burgers and shakes! The employees here are very friendly. Shout out to Luke who was super attentive, welcoming, and helpful. Delicious food + great people + welcoming atmosphere = wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Shake Shack, it was delish and had great flavor.  Heads up the burgers are cooked medium UNLESS requested, and it was moist, flavorful and pretty affordable being right on the strip. 
Would come here again with zero hesitation."}
{"text":"Shake Shack? I'm Shake Shook!

FOOD: I got the Bacon Cheese Fries (Best decision I've ever made. SO worth the extra 60 cents from reg. cheese fries) So my advice...do it! Indulge!
Next, I got the Smoke Shack (Crispy bacon, cheese, and cherry tomatoes on a well cooked patty and a warm fluffy bun). I got the cherry peppers on the side since the flavor is sometimes overbearing for me (I can't handle anything remotely spicy). But I liked doing this since I could then control the flavor and how many or little I put in my burger. So, if you're anything like me, it's worth a shot. 

INTERIOR: Busy, busy, busy! It is SO hard to find an indoor seat here. And it's a little chaotic (Think...fast food joint on steroids!) So be prepared to either sit outside, wait like a cheetah trying to pounce on a table, or take your food to go! Ooh, but also random side note: they play the games here (football, basketball etc.), but they don't have subtitles or sound.

I honestly can't express how great Shake Shack is. Please, oh please try this out for yourself, you won't regret it (I never do). Oh, how I wish I were in Vegas right now so I could taste those ooey gooey bacon cheese fries and that oh so crispy SmokeShack!"}
{"text":"Lines get packed...so if your lucky enough to go when it is empty...GO!!! Even if you have to wait, it is worth it. I am from Cali, this is the closest Shake Shack to me that I know of, and I always stop here when I am in Vegas. It is really great and reminds me of New York where I first had it..makes sense considering what hotel it is in...hahaha...anyways I love this place more than In N Out, and for good reason, its delicious. However, it is more expensive so be prepared. Try the shakes they are worth it."}
{"text":"I've heard about Shake Shack a while back and have been meaning to give it a shot and so when I found out there was one in LV I was excited to try it. So excited that I got the whole shabang - a black & white shake, cheese fries, and double shackburger - for a whopping $19 thinking it would be enough for 2. Oh boy was I wrong. 

The double shackburger was really good and juicy. I loved the sauce and taste but it was puny AF. It looked a bit smaller than the In out one but for triple the price. I finished my half in 3 bites and then moved onto the fries in hopes of finding more for my belly. Those crinkly fries were good and an average size. The black and white shake was not what it was sought out to be - a vanilla milkshake with chocolate sauce swirled in. It might as well been just a straight up chocolate shake. After this snack, I was left with wanting more but did not have the dough to fulfill my cravings. Even if I bought another burger I doubt that I would have been full anyway. 

I like how this NY burger joint is located in the New York New York Casino across from MGM. Kinda cool :) The decor was nice and modern. Service uh was a tidbit rude at the cash register.

Long story short: great tasting but puny burgers
And for that reason In N out will be my first choice."}
{"text":"mmm great burgers! I actually really enjoyed shake shack. I got the shackburger, fries, and the shack attack with vanilla custard instead of chocolate. I know a lot of people think this place is overhyped but I loved it. The shackburger was really simple, the quality was great, the patty wasn't dry and it wasn't greasy at all. I really enjoyed dipping my fries into the shack attack for some reason, I like the mix of sweet and salty together. As for the shack attack, it was pretty good too! However it's just a better made McDonald's vanilla cone. I really liked the fudge it came with but the chocolate chunks it also came with made it too sweet so I would prob wouldn't ask for that again. 

Overall I'm definitely coming here everytime I go to Vegas! I kept trying to like Earls Sandwiches and everytime I was disappointed."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I had last been to any Shake Shack.  Even when I went to the east coast last spring, I didn't really have any time to visit one.  So with my last trip to Vegas, I decided to stop by the NYNY location for a late dinner.

I definitely came hungry this time and ordered two sandwiches!  The Chick'n Shack since I had yet to try it, and my favorite Shack Stack.  Because I ordered two sandwiches, I refrained from ordering cheese fries.

Chick'n Shack and Shack Stack -- http://bit.ly/2vM0yzc
The Chick'n Shack is basically Shake Shack's answer to Chick fil-A with a crispy fried chicken breast filet, lettuce, pickles, and buttermilk herb mayo.  It's pretty damn tasty!  The chicken filet was huge, crispy, juicy, and full of flavor.  I would definitely order this again!  As for the Shack Stack, there's really not much else for me to say other than it's still delicious especially with that fried cheese stuffed portobello inside.  It's still my go-to burger there!

NYNY's Shake Shack is still an awesome location and it's gotten even better now that The Park is open.  The last time I was here, The Park was still under construction so the part of the patio area was closed off.  So it was nice to finally the whole area outside Shake Shack opened up.  It makes for a great people-watching spot while enjoying burgers and shakes."}
{"text":"Most amazing burger ever, I think it even beat the In N Out burger. I recommend this awesome place to anyone who wants a super tasty burger like a Shak Burger Double. If you happen to be drunk or in the sky this will satisfy you completely."}
{"text":"Hands down best burger I have ever had. Simple and only about $5 for a burger. The only flaw here is the waiting lines, but everything else is perfect. Their burgers are simple yet fantastic. A taste of New York in Vegas, perfect."}
{"text":"Really? I was so excited to try this place after hearing about it for so long. We got in line at NY NY casino to try the famous shake shack.

Pros: line moved quickly and was efficient
Friendly folks working there
Menu was simple and to the point
French fries were actually pretty tasty
Seating despite the huge crowds wasn't as bad as you would think, we were able to score a table for 8 without waiting more than 5 minutes

I wish I enjoyed the burger more. There was nothing wrong with it but I much prefer the burger at Roam in SF or even In-N-Out more than I liked Shake Shack."}
{"text":"I ordered the double Shack Burger, which was very juicy and delicious------slightly better than In-N-Out. The fries were a bit of a disappointment, which were probably Oreida fries. This is where In-N-Out beats them hands down. There are no self serve soda, but you can ask for a refill. The seating was great and the 4 large screen TV were a plus. Service was fast and  friendly. The cost of the meal is higher than most burger places, but would come back if in the area."}
{"text":"Passed by New York casino when we saw the sign Shake shack and all a sudden my burger craving hits me . I remember one of my coworkers rave about this burger joint so had to check it out. The inside decor is cool and the menu/choices is described more in detail. there was a line but it move quickly. The average for a burgers is about $6 and you can custom pick what burgers you like and customize your fries as well. They also have beer on tap for about $7-$10. I picked double shack burger and regular fries. Burger came out fresh, looks like a really
Gourmet burger, tasty and cheesy as well. The beef really
taste good and fresh with the cheese and other toppings that makes this an amazing burger. They said the beef is  100% percent grass fed beef so that explains why it taste so good. Fries was yummy I say it's about a 3.5/5. I paired my food with shock top and it was a great satisfying meal. I definitely want to try the chicken burger next. Highly recommend shake shack for their burgers."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. Pretty pricey for a \"fast food\" joint. Hamburgers are pretty tiny (at about $10 each) and pretty much tastes like Wendy's with a higher price tag. Shakes were also just average($6) and all their \"small\" drinks are the size of a happy meal cup."}
{"text":"Tried Shake Shack for the first time in Las Vegas over the weekend.  There was a line out the door but it moved fast and everyone seemed to be in good spirits.  They have 4 or 5 cash registers which really speeds the process up.

As for the food, we enjoyed the SmokeShack burger and the cheese fried were amazing.  The malt shake was just okay, almost like a soft serve ice cream shake.  We like a more texturized milk shake like at McDonald's.

Service was great, plenty of seating, and don't be afraid of the long line because it moves fast."}
{"text":"Wow sad eating experience. At first I was like Shake Shack so close to CA?? Oh yeah!! But giving our order was not so great. Our host, Deetreid, was not welcoming: did not say hi or smile and was busy writing as we stood in front of him, did not ask if my mom wanted any burger, was impatient when we wanted mint custard (the special flavor of the week). We said yes after talking to him about it. After verifying he read out our order. Picking up we found we were not given the custard and would have to go back to line. What. The. Heck. Not our fault. And the burger did not have extra lettuce or tomatoes as requested. Lesson learned. Make sure your order is correct not just what was said, but IN WRITING -- check your receipt! So looking again at the receipt: Hamburger, Shroom,  and fries for $15.27?? Not worth it. 

The burger was dry around the edges and hard to chew, fries dry... I made no happy food noise. My mom ate her Shroom (first time) and didn't say anything. Later said the mushroom was small and greasy. I loved all these when I went to the NYC locations (every time worth raving). Always perfect even though lines were long. Here the ambiance is more like a generic burger joint with large TV screens (playing sports) with men staring and eating so this Shack Shack location highlight is mostly the TV not the food. We won't return. If you want a great burger, check out the Counter."}
{"text":"Ok you might die off clogged artery if you ate at this place for 2 days straight... 
But damn the burgers and fries and the shake is one the best hangover food ... It good quality east coast style burgers ... Definitely a spot to enjoy in Vegas ... It gets packed on the weekends ..."}
{"text":"Located in NEW YORK NEW YORK of Las Vegas. Their restaurant is outside of the hotel. It's hugeee and packed. 

But their food orders are really fast so you don't wait too long. Lots of seating booths and high tables and big screen TVs to watch your sports games on. 

I wasn't so impressed by the food. I remember liking it more in NY the state. I got the chicken hot dog Chicago style it was okay. I was hungry. My friend got the stack cheeseburger she was also not amazed. Fries were okay. Not impressed. In n out is still #1 in California or Nevada."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I had a classic burger and fries with cheese. I would highly recommend making a stop here if you're looking for a good burger in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what people expect from a fast-ish food joint.  Your review should be for what it is, not on what you're comparing it to.  GEEZ!!!

Awesome burger.  It may actually become my go-to fast food burger when in Vegas.  Sorry In-&-Out...  This is a really good burger that actually seems more like a back-yard barbecue style than the traditional frozen patty that you seem to get everywhere else.  Good fries, good drinks and good vibes.

Go to Shake Shack if you want to keep your taste \"buds\" buds."}
{"text":"1st time here at any \"Shake Shack\". First off, it's overrated! The burgers are small, but pretty tasty. And expensive! All items are separate. Three stars was for the cool service, small but tasty burgers & fast service!"}
{"text":"Awful customer service. 45 min wait for a hamburger? You might want to let people know that before they order.  Never again.  Should have went to in and out.  Shake Shack, you can go F urselves."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat a Hamburger . Its so delicious.... Its a must to visit if you ever come to Las Vegas!  They have delicous fries! check them out !!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger places. Cheese fries are amazing. Best concrete anywhere! Prices reasonable for being on Vegas strip. Great family stop for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"Had to stop in just to see what the hype was about and came away with a shoulder shrug.  In-n-Out and Dick's are both superior.  Good for them on expanding all over though."}
{"text":"One of the best fast food burgers all around the states! I recommend the shack stack if you love mushrooms with your burger and cheese! Its one of best. As for their fries, I recommend asking for them to be well done if you don't like them to begin with. The fries sort of remind me of school fries which don't taste good. The redeeming part is the beauty of how good the burgers are! This is a must try place for a very good burger."}
{"text":"I want a 4.5 star SO bad! The best part of this place is not only that there are hot dog and juicy burger options, but THE CHICKEN SANDWICH. It is hands-down THE BEST CHICKEN SANDWICH. And I like that chik-fil-a type-a sandwich.. but this is next level, like four levels higher. I honestly cannot make a chicken sandwich like theirs so I am doomed to be a customer for life to buy theirs for the delicious! 

Perks of this place are the ping-pong table, the heated and open air outdoor patio, the speed, and freshness.Also those darned seasonal concrete mixers and hot chocolates always sucker me in.. good one shake shack, good one. 

Why not 5 stars? Well, this place has those french fries that are like taco bell.. if you don't eat it fresh it is a terrible experience; once those puppies come out eat them quickly as the delicious-ness is fading quickly! Also, I love the locally (for Shake Shack) sourced pickles, but I honestly like my pickles more 'dill-y' than theirs. 

Check this place out and I dare you to compare to In-N-Out.. I DARE YOU."}
{"text":"Second time I've been to a Shake Shack. Was definitely craving for a Shack Stack with cheesy fries. For some reason, the experience wasn't as good as when I ate it in New York a few months ago. Same long lines and big crowd but meh, it was all right, all-in-all."}
{"text":"Arguably one of the best fast food burgers on earth. Juicy burgers, fresh veggies, soft grilled bun. The thing that disappointed me were the fries. I'll admit I'm a little biased. I prefer regular cut fries or tater tots. But the crinkle cut fries that Shake Shack offers were just OK. I could do without them on my next visit. I also got a mud pie shake on a separate visit. It was on the richer side, but the taste and consistency were on par of what I would expect from a great milkshake."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is one of the best places to get a burger...and a shake! I was relatively surprised by the small size of their burgers, but the taste more than makes up for it. I always get the SmokeShack burger because who doesn't love bacon?! That and an Oreo shake are my two favs.

Customer service is always friendly here and this location is killer! Right on the corner of The District, it is a great add to an already awesome outdoor shopping mall.

Be sure to try their fries because they are tasty!

The inside of this place is a designers dream. Very comfortable and chill. They also have Foosball and Shuffleboard tables to kill the time while waiting for your food and/or just to hang with friends and challenge them to a dual!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my visit to this location of Shake Shack. When I learned they were opening a location in my home town I was so excited because the ones in NYC that I have gone to were out of this world good. The stuffed mushroom sandwich was really tough, chewy and stringy I couldn't even bite through it. The fries were all ready and sitting waiting to be ordered so I didn't get them. Hubby got the Shack Stack Burger and the whole thing just smelled and tasted of grease. The quality of the beef was terrible. Lots of hard fat pieces gross. I hope they improve the quality because I want to have a go to Shake Shack close to home."}
{"text":"I took the advice of my fellow yelp reviewers and tried the Shack stack burger and ....

Let's just say I was super satisfied !! 

If you're really hungry order 2 different things because the burger is not that big. However, the burger taste amazing! 

Inside the Shack stake burger had a fried portobello mushroom with cheese inside of it + a cheese burger. Wow ! The first bite the mushroom popped open and the taste of the mushroom, cheese + the cheese burger was a heavenly combination. 

Fries were super crispy and delicious as well. 
I will for sure be coming back here."}
{"text":"I love the Shake Shack located in the New York New York Hotel facing The Park across from the Monte Carlo.  The have great tasting burgers, fries, and milk shakes. They even have food for dogs, how cool is that?! 
Plenty of table seating inside or outside on The Park. Great for people watching with the outside seating as it also sits on the Las Vegas Blvd, aka The Strip!
Shake on over to the Shake Shack for great tasting food. Oh yeah...YUM!"}
{"text":"There are no waiters here. You order at the register and pick up your food at the service window. 

The burger itself had good flavor and was cooked well. It was a thin patty. The fries were fresh but if you get cheese on them, make sure you eat them fast. The cheese isn't good when it's cold. I tried a strawberry milkshake and it was fine, nothing special. If you want whipped cream on that shake it'll cost you 50 cents. The price of the milkshake is absolutely outrageous to not already come with whipped cream. It was $5.19 and served in the same size cup as a small fountain drink which cost $2.55.

Overall, the food is good but I drove from Cleveland to try this place and it's not worth the drive to come here again. The price isn't worth it either. It was $30 for two people to eat here."}
{"text":"Do you want the best burger you've ever had?  Go to shake shack!! Such tasty burgers! And the fries are amazing! Their customer service is top notch, and the ambiance is so nice!  The outdoor seating area is such a nice place, they even have a ping pong table!  So cool, I love it!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and fries! Headed over from the MGM for some lunch and the wait time wasn't crazy at all. We ordered a Shake Stack and some cheese fries. My favorite part of this burger was the mushroom Patty...soo delicious! A lot of people mention how the crinkle cheeses fries are amazing and YES THEY ARE! 
So, if you're looking for something savory and mouth watering, check out The Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good burger place. They just opened this location next to New York New York. There was a line going down to the stairs so we knew this place had to be good. I had the shake stack burger with mushrooms and bacon and it was good! My girl got a cheese dog which she also liked. The chocolate shake was out of this world. The after taste is like eating a chocolate bar. I think next time we'll get a larger shake. Prices are also reasonable and I definitely felt like I wasn't getting ripped off like some of these other places on the strip."}
{"text":"I've tried Shake Shack in NYC about 4 years ago and liked it, but didn't remember much about my meal. It was also January at the time and snowing outside, so I didn't order a shake or a concrete.

Went to this new Vegas location at NYNY Hotel with coworkers a few weeks ago for our Friday lunch. There were a lot of people in line but service was friendly & quick! It looked like there were at least 15 workers in the kitchen hauling ass like no other resulting in the speedy production of my meal. 

I ordered the following--

Single ShackBurger ($5.19): I LOVED my burger! The patty was SO JUICY and had a really fresh taste, the bun was perfect, and the tomato & lettuce were fresh & crisp. 

Cheese fries ($3.95): weren't that special imo but my coworker loved them & ate all of mine. 

Black & white shake ($5.25): yummy, but it's just vanilla & chocolate so I'll def have to try one of their Concretes next time. 


I like that this place has plenty of outdoor seating although the current view is a partial Strip view + Las Vegas Arena construction. Indoor seating is spacious as well but fills up quickly during lunchtime. 

PS - MGM employees receive a discount! Just show your ID. Forgot how much the discount is exactly... but something is always better than nothing! :)"}
{"text":"We had cheese fries- so yummy! The cheese they pour on this is very satisfying if you love savory fries. The Shack burger was pretty good. The meat had good flavor like it was fresh off the grill. We also had a vanilla concrete with salted caramel sauce and this was the star of our dinner. Wow! So creamy and the salted caramel sauce was a perfect balance of sweet and salty. 
Service was smiley and patient with us newbies. Quick, organized order pick up. Will definitely go back for some fries and try a shake next time!

Only complaint is that the restroom is.very.tiny. For such a big place on the strip, I think it was overlooked. Prepare to wait, ladies."}
{"text":"If Shake Shack comes to LA, I will definitely be there!  My Shackburger with cheese was great, & so was the chocolate & vanilla custard.  The Smokeshack was a little heavy on the smoky for my taste, though.

Seating inside or out is comfortable, & service was super friendly.  Parking at New York New York was easy, too : )"}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday. OVERPRICED!!!!! $18 for a burger, fries, shake, and small coke. The fries were good. I will NOT go back!!!"}
{"text":"The cheeseburger is good, it is not the best but tasty! The buns and meat are delicious. The vegetables are fresh. The value is not the best in my opinion."}
{"text":"East coast represent. To hell with in and out. Great that it opens late. Come here for grub after your late Vegas shows."}
{"text":"I got the shack stack since it was the most popular and I felt like I couldn't go wrong with it. However, I was very disappointed in the size of the burger. Do NOT let the pictures deceive you people, the burgers here are on the small side. It took about 15 minutes to get my burger after ordering and only one minute for me to finish it. It was good though don't get me wrong. That portobello mushroom was a perfect touch. But for the price and the wait, I don't think it's really worth it.

The crinkle cut cheese fries were pretty good but they were also on the small side. Their shakes weren't that great. I can't remember which ones I tried, but I went with three other people who all got different shakes and I just remember thinking that these were definitely a waste of calories and money. 

Maybe it was just a little overhyped for me before I tried it but I feel like this place is just a solid 3 out of 5 stars in my book. I'll stick to my in-n-out thanks."}
{"text":"This was the best burger I have ever had. It is on the Veags Strip and can get a little crowded but I promise it is all worth it. Hands down this is the best burger place ever."}
{"text":"So again before the arrival to Vegas I had looked into this joint. Tucked into the New York New York it's a pleasant surprise. The decor is modern, the people are friendly. So my wife and I ordered the chick n shack( delicious might I add) with fries and shakes. My daughter ordered the shack burger. I've never heard my daughter ask to come back before we've even finished the meal. She's never eaten the burger before the fries even... Never! She even commented on the fact that before we leave we have to eat there one more time. Guess it's a sure fire hit and a sign that we will be back."}
{"text":"Great Shakes.   The burgers also tasted very good. Reasonably priced and that is hard to find in Vegas. They are also open late so even more convenient."}
{"text":"I was staying at the NY NY hotel a couple of weekends ago and ended up here since it was just downstairs. I had never been to a Shake Shack before so it took me a little bit to decide but I finally went with the Shack burger with fries and a coke. It was about $12 for everything which isn't too bad but as a native Californian, I'm used to paying $6 for this same kind of meal at In N Out. I got a little pager and found a table and I'd say within 5 minutes my food was ready. It was a really great burger, fries were good and it was plenty of food. If I can't get In N Out (being in Nashville now), I'd gladly pay for Shake Shack to get my burger fix if it's around since it'd technically be cheaper than the boutique eateries where 1 burger is $15 alone. I'd eat here again for sure."}
{"text":"Not amazed by the burgers here. I got the Shackburger. It had a thin slice of meat with a Burger-King like egg colored bun. The fries are the best thing they have going for them. I loved the chili fries with melted nacho cheese and homemade beef rib chili. The shake was overly sweet and the custard with apple pie was also a bit too cloyingly sweet for me. I was hoping for apple pie with custard on the side instead of an McFlurry. Will probably be back solely for the fries."}
{"text":"Why does everyone working here look like they hate their lives?

Solid food as always, but god, does nobody know how to smile?"}
{"text":"My expectations were so high about this place from what I've been hearing from people but this place is just okay I'm my book. I ordered a double smoke shake and I was a little disappointed on the taste and overall size of the burger. For a little over 9.00 for a burger one would think you would be getting more of a gourmet burger. Fast food worthy but not restaurant worthy. A double double from in-n-out is much better and half the cost. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!"}
{"text":"We meet again after 3 years, my NYC In-N-Out esque friend :D. I was on a tight schedule to get out of Las Vegas and wanted something quick before hopping on the 15 back to LA. This did not disappoint, but I'm reserving a raving review for when I try more of the menu.

My order: basic single shack burger, fries, and a scoop of the custard.
1.  Maybe its my Californian blood talking but I still prefer In-N-Out's fries. They were crispy enough here, but the price is higher and they seemed to get colder easily. When In-N-Out's fries are freshest they are super hot, crispy, and airy on the inside, which their fries were not by the end of my meal.
2. I may have to give it to these guys on the burger. The bun had a mellower, chewier taste that I loved, kinda reminiscent of asian bakery breads/Hawaiian sweet rolls. The patty was more substantial and juicier. The cheese/lettuce/etc was forgettable, but that's always true. Some regrets about not getting the bacon burger or the mushroom stacked one though!
3. I'll pass on the custard next time. I could be turning into an ice cream snob, but very few ice cream places impress me outside of hagan daz and liquid nitrogen places like Creamistry.

Price: for an order of 3 single shack burgers, 2 fries, and a custard it was 27 bucks. It's more than I'm used to paying for burgers but I'm going to chalk it up to the Las Vegas prices. I swear even the Starbucks was more here than in LA.

Service/Atmosphere: 
Very efficient for a long ass line! I was initially confused as to why the door was closed and people were waiting outside, but soon realized that it was because the line snaked out the door already at 12pm on a Monday. There was an employee outside though that made small talk with us as she managed the crowds, which made waiting in the increasing heat bearable.

The menus are posted in large print while you're in the lines so you can decide. Their buzzer system is great because you can snag a seat and chat while you wait instead of obsessively listen for numbers. The water, ketchup, etc, is centrally located and kept clean. The cleanup workers were also super sweet! A lady walked around our area looking to help patrons clear out their dishes to the trash as they are done eating. 

I'll be back when this hits soCal next year :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, 30 minutes before closing. The line was long (went all the way to the front door), but went by pretty quickly. 

The cheese fries tasted so strange because of the cheese. And the fries itself are basic; nothing special about it."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is located outside NY NY hotel.  Its a great place to grab a meal at an affordable price.  All the burgers range from $5 to $10 bucks depending on what you order.  

I decided to try the Shroom Burger, which is a fried Portobella mushroom filled with melted cheese.  It was definitely a good vegetarian burger.  With each bite of the portobella mushroom, there would be plenty of cheese gushing out.

We also ordered a chocolate shake, which was very good.  It had a thick chocolate flavor.

Overall, I would highly recommend this place.  There is plenty of tables inside and outside for customers."}
{"text":"I ordered the smoke shack, fries, PB shake, and lemonade. The burger was fantastic. Much way way better than what any In N Out restaurant can do. There was more burger than bun, although I had to ask for lettuce and tomatoes. The bacon was so flavorful. The fries were crunchy but not burnt or hard. Each was substantial to bite inti. In N Out fries can be soggy sometimes and the size of each is just bigger than shoestring. The PB shake was good but not phenomenal. Maybe my expectation of the shake was high after reading some of the other reviews, yet I wanted to taste a little bit more PB. The lemonade was too sweet for me. I guess, I'd like it to be more tangy than sugary.  Lastly, there was no hint of mint at all in the strawberry mint lemonade. I would have given just 4 stars. However, the burger and fries were awesome with great service earned star number 5. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Holy heck! The best burger in town! I went two days in a row. Lol. Id get the double!!"}
{"text":"I still prefer In-N-Out Burgers however I do enjoy their Crinkle Cut Fries with Cheese which I recommend. They have a cool selection of dessert offering. The few times I had a concrete/shake here, it was delicious plus you have the option of customizing your own flavor. The vegetarian burger was very good and flavorful with every bite. The cheese and portobello mushroom was fresh and consistent. At most times I've been here the customer service is on point and accommodating."}
{"text":"25 minutes for a burger and fries at 6pm???

We ordered the shroom stack- the cheese burger with the portabella mushroom on top.

It was delicious but so small for almost $10!!! and the wait was insane.  When I finally went to ask for it, after waiting for 6 minutes for the guy in front of me to stop complaining, it turns out my order was sitting there the entire time.  Needless to say, the fries were cold by then.

Would I eat here again? If it was a larger burger, yes. Otherwise, I will eat somewhere else and get a burger worth $10."}
{"text":"Went and got my first shake shack burger today. All the things I read about how great these burgers are were so true!  I got the roadside burger that has the bacon carmelized onions on it.  Had them put lettuce and tomato on it as well.  From the first to the last bite I was in burger heaven!!  From the ultra soft bun to the meat cheese and veggies everything was top quality and well worth the $6!!!  

I also had the cheese fries they were a large portion but I was so hungry and they were so good that I ate all of them!!  The cheese sauce was really good quality!!  

I raved about the food to my coworkers and am still on a burger high!  I will DEFINITELY be back!!"}
{"text":"Now this is gonna sound crazy but the Shake shack in the T-Mobile arena actually tastes better than this one on the boulevard. I don't know why, perhaps it's the sheer amount of burgers they are cooking. Not to say this one was bad because it was very yummy but I have had better burgers at other Shake shack's around the country and surprisingly inside the T-Mobile arena consistently.  If you're going to an event or a game get your shake shack inside the arena on the main concourse it's only a couple dollars more."}
{"text":"Enjoyed it! We should all buy their stock. But I gotta admit not sure what all the hype is about. The burger patty was seasoned well. The meat is really good. The condiments and bun were average. Nothing special there. The fries was plain. Not double fried. More like baked McCain fries from your childhood. Check the place out the next time you are in America and let me know what you think. I'm thinking I should've bought a shake shack t-shirt though."}
{"text":"Everyone loves shake shack. I just wish the burgers were bigger! But for anyone who hasn't been here, come check it out. Awesome fries, amazing burgers. They have really good milkshakes too! They also do hot dogs but I haven't tried those because I always have to get a burger. Came to this location with my husband because we had the pups with us and we needed somewhere with a patio. This is where we went and the staff was so incredibly awesome. I wish I caught this guy's name, but he happened to be cleaning up outside when we got there. He brought treats out for our dogs and even took our buzzer so when the food was ready he just brought it out to us! So friendly and accomodating, I was impressed. Great customer service goes a long way so I'll definitely be back at this location!"}
{"text":"My top 5 \"embellished\" (more than patties, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions) burgers in decreasing order of awesomeness:

1. Umami Burger
2. Bachi Burger
3. Shake Shack
4. Black Sheep
5. The Counter

The SHACK STACK with the cheese-stuffed portobello mushroom - OMG. 

The crinkled fries? You can get far superior fries from Chick Fil A.

Should you come here when in Vegas? Hell yes! Especially if you ain't got the time or dough to track them down in NYC.

-----------------------------
Tip for EDC attendees: make this your one meal of the day. Earl of Sandwich and Secret Pizza will do for the remaining two days."}
{"text":"Small burgers... but they are sooo goood!!   Ask for  some of those cherry peppers on the side to add to your burgers"}
{"text":"Can you say Yummy,Yummy! The food does not disappoint. Great loud place for young and old."}
{"text":"I'm glad to have a quick burger joint on Camelback and Central. The entrance faces Central and the restaurant is pretty spacey. We came on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and there was no line surprisingly. 

We decided to order the Shake Stack (meat patty with portobello mushroom), crinkle cut fries and the concrete single Mallow Monsoon. 

Shake stack: it was a tasty burger! I loved every bite! The problem is the size - are you kidding? It looked like a junior burger. Normally, I split my burger with my hubby because in most places, the burger is enormous. Once I saw it, I was thinking, this size - for $9.59? I could of eaten this whole burger all by myself. It was a little overpriced. I agree with other reviewers - It should be more like a $6.50 or $7 burger.

Crinkle cut fries: nothing special for $2.99. If you look at my picture I posted, I had more fries than I did a burger. 

The Mallow Monsoon was delightful!! It was perfect and worth the $4.59. 

Service was quick and we were out of there in 30 or so minutes so."}
{"text":"Why are you people posting photos of your receipt? Why are you surprised at the total? The prices are right there in front of you when you ordered. SMH.
The place is clean, service is friendly, and the food is pretty dang good for meat and potatoes lol I love it here. Sorry, you can't see my receipt! LOL"}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack, they really know how to make a burger taste great. No matter where I try them, Las Vegas, Miami, Austin,  they taste exactly the same and great. They are a full flavoured burger grilled to beefy perfection on a flattop with good quality fixings, ShackSauce on a soft bun. 

This is the second time I've had a great Shake Shack burger at the T-Mobile arena in Las Vegas, and both times I was completely satisfied. As you can see in my photo there was a long lineup and it was worth the wait. The people behind the counter were hopping trying to get those burgers out, and they did and they did it with smiles and curtesy. I can't wait till I get my next Shake Shack fix!"}
{"text":"I'm not a burger connoisseur but I've had shake shack in New York and am super happy it's now available on the west coast! Can't go wrong with the shake stack, also good with bacon added, and if this is your YOLO meal, then definitely get the fries loaded with cheese and bacon bits. It's also a huuuuge serving in a big bowl. Sharing is caring =)"}
{"text":"Had to stop off at Shake Shack while in Vegas. We only have a few Shake Shacks in California and they're all in Northern LA. I LOVE Shake Shack. My favorite burger ever. I recently went vegetarian and the portobello mushroom burger did not disappoint! Please keep spreading in So. Cal so I can enjoy more often!"}
{"text":"Good stuff at the MGM Grand! It's outside the casino on Las Vegas boulevard so don't for it inside like I did. We ordered a Shack burger & fries but my wife decided to be different and order cheese fries. The food was delicious and was made quickly. The burger had a great crust on it and seasoned well.  The cheese was smooth & tasty on the fries and not overpowering. Great place for a great snack!"}
{"text":"You know how much food I could've gotten for the same price as steak and shake ? Holy crap over priced and not worth the trip at all. Only reason for the one star is because the Dr pepper was good. I'll never be back, EVER!"}
{"text":"love the burger but the location is just too far from the parking lot since you have to get out of NyNy to get here. the buns even has flavor, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I tried shake shack for the first time, and with the food quality, I was impressed with the taste of the burgers, fries, shakes, etc, but customer service was poor. We ordered Sprite, and the drink didn't taste anything like sprite, so we asked one of the people that work there, and she wasn't a help AT ALL! So, the manager came and gave us a refund."}
{"text":"Service is quick even with a long line. I'm a vegetarian, and I'm a huge fan of the 'shroom burger with a side of fries. Next time, I'd opt for a strawberry shake instead of a concrete; the ice cream alone doesn't even compare favorably to Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and shakes. I ordered the original and the chicken burger and they were both great. Don't be alarmed if you see pink in your hamburger meat. Apparently they cook it like that on purpose. I am not a fan of that so I brought mine back and they made a new one that was labeled as well done. Also ordered the peanut butter shake and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"The large crowd made the enjoyment less but the food was okay. The coffee shake and the frozen custard was the best. I also like the fries but they were nothing special."}
{"text":"Solid burger joint. The hamburgers were very good and the meat tasted very fresh. We had the cheese fries and they were good also. Nice place for some quick good food that isn't super expensive."}
{"text":"I didn't grow up with In and Out or Shake Shack, but in my unbiased opinion, I'm definitely Team SS.
I just got a regular burger (no cheese) with all of the toppings. They grill the bun, so it's warm and soft. The pickles have a good crunch and the onions and sauce made for a flavorful burger. The crinkle fries were fresh. 
If there was any question, the custard put SS on top! I love custard, and theirs is creamy and smooth, so save room for dessert! We ordered the custard at the same time as the food and put a \"hold\" on it--they said to go to the pick-up window when we were ready for it. We thought that meant they wouldn't make it until we were ready to eat it, but someone went and grabbed it from somewhere--it had already been made and was a bit melted."}
{"text":"Our favorite burger place hands down! Delicious burgers/ chicken sandwiches, crinkle fries, and of course shakes! This is priced higher than fast food burgers but it should be the service, atmosphere, cleanliness, fast casual counter service, and quality of the food itself puts it above. They are super dog friendly on their patio and you can even buy treats for your dog as well!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything on the menu we love it all! A must go to when in Vegas food was fast and cheap and taste great you can't beat that"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Shack Shake as it has come to my understanding that this is the In-n-Out equivalent over on the east coast! 

Parking: Park at New York New York. Free the first hour! They don't do validation here, so if you don't want to pay extra, order fast and eat fast! 

Access: You actually don't get access to Shake Shack from inside New York New York. You actually have to walk through the hotel and onto the strip. The entrance is very easy to locate, the giant Shake Shack sign is a dead giveaway.

Line: Due to the ongoing hype, the line is pretty long. It wraps around inside, but they have huge menus for you to look at while waiting to order your food. The wait was probably 10-15 minutes.

Seating: Plenty of seating available. My friends spotted a table right away, it's a little dirty but it's a fast food restaurant. We cleaned it up ourselves anyway.

Food: I got the single patty cheeseburger with a side of crinkle cut fries. The cheeseburger was really good. Patty was cooked medium, so it was very juicy. It was a good size too, I wasn't overly stuffed when I was done with my burger. The fries were extremely amazing. Deep fried, crispy, and not soggy! I usually don't like large crinkle cute fries, but these fries totally made me change my mind! 

Overall, Shack Shake is somewhat comparable to In-n-Out. However, I still love In-n-Out because it's a lot cheaper and still just as good!"}
{"text":"As far as fast food burgers go, this place is my favorite (update: Burger Lounge is my favorite, but this place is top 3). Great bun, great beef, great burger. Normally I don't like crinkle cut fries as they invoke images of an elementary school cafeteria but these are delicious."}
{"text":"Tried the shake shack in London which didn't impress. Heard that the ones in America were much better and just had to try in while I was in Vegas.

After 2 days of in n out, I would say that the burger at shake shack was more impressive as they had juicier patties and the shack stack which I ordered had the most succulent deep fried portobello mushroom I've ever had!

The shakes. I ordered the peanut butter shake which was so creamy and fragrant it was like having peanut butter right out of the jar but smoother and not as sweet. Definitely one of the better milkshakes I've had.

In comparison to in n out overall, I would definitely choose shake shack anytime. I've had enough burgers for this trip, but so glad I ended it off with shake shack. I still haven't found a burger that totally awed me, but this is close enough!"}
{"text":"With all of the hype about Shake Shack, I had to give it a try for myself. 

Very nice location at Central and Camelback, the work they did to change this retail space is quite impressive. It's beautiful in fact. More importantly lots of seating inside and some outside. 

Okay, let's get to the real reason I was there. The burgers!  At first I was discouraged by the prices. 
I had the Shack burger with cheese $5.29 and cheese fries $3.99. I had heard great things about the shakes, so I just had to splurge and order one, peanut butter, $5.29. So as you can see, with tax I was over $15.00. A lot for a fast food joint!

I took a seat and my number was called shortly. Presentation was great. Though the burger looked  small, it was well put together. The shake too was in a small cup. 

Ready? It is probably one of the best fast food burgers I have ever had. Flavor was amazing! Their special sauce is quite good. Best of all, they use a potato bun which makes a huge different. 
The crinkle cut fries were also great especially covered in hot cheese sauce. 

My peanut butter shake was soooo good. It turned out to be just the right size as it was very rich. 

In the end Shake Shack is worth it. My only complaint would be the burger size, I could have eaten two, but it's hard to justify getting another at $5.29. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"WHERE'S THE BEEF?
After an insipid and unimpressive burger here I admitted to my Vegas friends that I had dipped my toe into the phenomenon that is Shake Shack. To a man they all panned the place. The burgers are small and bland! Much better options are at In-N-Out and even Gordon Ramsey's.

WHERE'S MY BEEF?
The ordering process is cumbersome. Unlike In-N-Out the cashiers can't expedite the huge lines because there are way too many options, many need explaining and there aren't enough POSs. Worse, my food (and others) sat and got cold for 6 minutes as the serving manager handled a customer complaint...and no fountain refills!"}
{"text":"Finally got to eat here! I first heard of it online seeing celebrities posting mouth watering pictures on Instagram(: I'm not a big fan of In N Out although I've lived here 12 years so I can easily say this burger was better than In N Out in my opinion.  It's located right next to Tom's Urban which is a lot more helpful to follow than saying Starbuck's.  I don't think the location is great for locals- I live on Las Vegas Blvd, but not quite on the strip so I think that would stop me from coming here often.  Also, although the burger and shake were tasty (fries nothing special...5 Guys fries are better) I think this place is pricey.  I came with a friend and we both got shakes, burgers and one order of fries and it came to $26.  If they get one off the strip I may still go again- definitely not disappointing."}
{"text":"We went at 11am on a Saturday morning.  A 20 minute wait and hey we're having a supplier problem... no beef!  

The chicken sandwich is INCREDIBLE.  Honestly, #1 chicken sandwich of all time.  The cookie butter concrete was delicious and the fries a nice combination of fluffy inside and crispy outside.  My wife liked her hot dog and the bacon cheese fries were good, but the cheese sauce wasn't as special as the rest of the meal.

Overall, a wonderful lunch on the patio."}
{"text":"this is crap. people are so stupid to think this is anything but decent. biggest let down, stay on the east coast where flavor must resemble sewer water."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally try Shake Shack! Idk why people compare it to in n out because they're completely different. Shake shack is more on the gourmet side.  

I kept it simple and got a hamburger with everything and added bacon. What I don't like is that they don't ask you if you want onions. TIP:  You have to specifically state everything you want otherwise it'll end up being very plain... 

Shack stack was good but a bit overwhelming so I'd probably just stick to a cheeseburger. Cheese fries were a good touch too.  Can't wait to try their milkshake next time. 

Honestly, it's good but not amazing. A bit overhyped ."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and one thing I noticed each time was the unhappy look on their employee's faces. It makes you not want to bother  them by ordering something. Also,it seems like the later it gets the less cleaning is done on the tables inside.
I agree with another review about the Milkshakes. The taste is there but by the time you get something out it feels like you ran a marathon.
Not sure if I will be going back."}
{"text":"Great burger very pricey but very delicious the shakes were good also the burgers are not that big so get the double"}
{"text":"ABOVE & BEYOND!!!
Last night I met my children and my parents there. There were 6 of us all together- 3 kids and 3 disabled/elderly adults. My parents were sitting at a table looking at the menu. I have never been there, but my mother had been and said it was good. Usually you order at the counter and pick up when buzzed. This is where they earned their 5 stars. One of the crew members, I believe Mark was his name, came over and asked if we had any ?s. My mother said she had a question about the mushroom burger. Mark answered and then went out of his way to ask if we wanted him to take our order at the table instead of us having to walk up and stand in line( I guess he noticed we all had health issues). It blew my mind. He took our order and brought it to our table like a full service restaurant. The food itself was good, but nothing super special. Would definitely go back for the food. I just felt like I needed to write a good review for the service because it seems like in Vegas, it's very hard to find someone willing to go the extra step to satisfy someone. Usually people only barely put out enough effort to say they did their job. Thank you again, Mark(?) for all of your help."}
{"text":"Yummm!   First time here and not disappointed.  Burger and fries are delicious. Staff is friendly.  We will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Shack sauce was not good. It ruined my burger. Way too spicy for me. The sauce was all I could taste after getting a bite of jalapeños. Atmosphere was ok. Not many tables for families. Had chairs about 6 inches off ground that were quite wide at tables just off ground also. Lots of tvs. Manager was super nice and changed channel to Stanley Cup game 1. Food and environment just were not good for this old unhip guy."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Shake Shack. I can't judge on the hotdogs or regular burgers, but the shroom burger and any burger with the fried cheese can't do any wrong. The shakes are great too. 

The cheese was perfectly oozing and hot. 

I don't need to say anymore.

Ooze and shake away!"}
{"text":"Finding a table here is probably more difficult than finding a parking spot at a mall on December 24. My friends and I had to separate and hover over tables we thought were leaving soon. Tacky but a girl's gotta eat!

For being so packed, the food came out rather quickly.

The cheese fries are good. They use like a fancy cheese whiz. HAHA.

The burgers are good and worth a try BUT I still gotta say that In-n-Out trumps this place."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever eating at Shake Shack and based on this experience I will definitely be back. I had a basic hamburger with bacon, cheese fries, and a soda and I wasn't disappointed. The food came out pipping hot and was full of flavor. It was well priced for the food I purchased which is a rarity on the Vegas strip. The place was packed while we were there, but the numerous employees I encountered were super friendly and didn't let the volume of people phase them. If you're looking for something fast, fun, and fulfilling while on the Strip I recommend Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Shake Shack was my first stop once I arrived to Las Vegas and came right before they had opened. You would think people don't want a hamburger at 11 AM in the morning but you would be wrong. There was already a line forming with hungry foodies ready to eat and binge. 

Once 11 AM hit the guy opened the door and a wave of people formed another line inside. The air conditioner is kicking in and the service to take our order was fast. Menu is right there in front of your face to see new items and old. 

Ordered their hot chicken which is a hearty chicken that is deep fried and had some coleslaw inside the bun. Overall I thought the burger was pretty tasty and not that dry. 

Ordered their famous cheese fries which tasted kind of like maybe nacho cheese sauce on crinkle fries. I don't know why but I do enjoy crinkle cut fries more when a topping is on it because it just grabs the sauce and makes it taste different than a regular fry. Or maybe it's just me. 

Overall I enjoyed my experience and thought that this place was pretty good. Sad thing is that if you are driving now it's a $7.00 charge per hour at New York Casino. That would make me not want to go to any establishment at this casino because of having for worry about paying for parking."}
{"text":"A LOT of hype went into this place before it opened, which honestly took almost 2 years. I believe I read articles announcing the opening of the first Shake Shack on the West Coast in April on 2013. I myself was super excited because I had a few friends who tried it in New York and they couldn't stop talking about how AMAZING it was and the fact that it kicks In N Out's butt. FINALLY it opens a few days before New Year's and low and behold my friend's and I are there on opening day December 29, 2014 a Monday to be exact. If I wasn't working that day I probably would of been one of the first customers in line, if not the first. I really wanted to write a review after my first visit, but I wanted to give them another shot before knocking them down. I'm certainly glad I did because I would of given them 3 stars instead of 2.

My first visit, there was no line at all which is good considering all the horror stories with 45 minute waits at the NY locations. I ordered the Shack Stack and cheese fries based off of everyone's recommendation from Yelp and friend's of mine. I was honestly not a fan and did not understand the hype from these menu items. To begin with I am not a cheese at all and both of these are bombarded with cheese. I do enjoy cheese on fries, but maybe there was a too much cheese on these fries. Maybe if you order these you can request for light cheese or even have it on the side so you don't get overwhelmed with cheese. The Stack Shack has the portobello- mushroom breaded on the outside with cheese as well. This is a really good concept, but once again I was overwhelmed with cheese because there was already cheese on the burger itself. If I order this again I may just have to order it without cheese on the burger since there's already cheese in the portobello-mushroom. I also ordered a medium size lemonade and all of these came out to $17 and some change. WOW pretty pricey I must say. So I was kind of whatever about this experience, but I knew I should order different things on my next visit and sure enough I was there again the next week on a Friday. We arrive around 6pm and there was line of about 15-20 people. The line moves fast because there are 3 cashiers upfront and a ton of employees working the kitchen. They seem to be over staffed, but I guess that's beneficial for the patrons eating here. So this time I came here with my cousin and we share 1 order of fries and single scoop of All Shook Up. I ordered a Shack Burger for myself. And sure enough I was way more impressed with my selections this time around. Since there was less stuff going on in the burger I could truly taste the quality of the beef in comparison to In N Out. I also do appreciate the fact they use a better quality ice berg lettuce. Definitely in this case you get what you pay for. Although I do like crinkle cut fries, I still prefer In N Out's because of their freshness. You could tell these are made from Yukon Gold rather than whatever type of Cane's uses for their crinkle cut fries. My cousin and I really enjoyed the All Shook Up. The consistency and texture was perfect and concrete itself was not too sweet. For the most part I can see myself ordering a shake, concrete, or a custard item on my future visits. Next time I'm here with a bigger group I'll order the Shake a pooloza, which looks amazing in pictures. Although it is a pricey for $15?!

Looking around here you could tell all of the patrons eating here are into the up and rising food scene and just life in general? Haha. I do like the interior since it looks like recycled wood they used for their fixtures and table settings. I know I won't take an initiative, but with visitors from out of town they'll be like \"I want to try Shake Shack\" and I certainly be hiding my excitement inside because I've already tried it."}
{"text":"Shout out and rejoice that a small slice of NYC is now in my own backyard! Despite my loyalties to In-N-Out, I have a soft spot for Shake Shack. I first tasted their burgers in NYC a few years ago and have since been hooked. I make it a priority to stop by on every NYC trip. Since I moved to Vegas this summer, I have been looking forward to the grand opening of this Shake Shack at New York New York for months. I can't believe now that it's here, I can have Shake Shack whenever I want without having to fly across the country. 

My go-to burger here is the Shack Stack. I've been burned on more than one occasion by the fried portobello mushroom filled with molten-lava cheese. They now warn you at the register of its tongue-scorching potential. The fries are better than your average fries. Unlike most burger chains, their crinkle-cut fries come out crispy and don't have that greasy feeling. I wash all that down with a cup of root beer, straight from the tap.

This new location right outside New York New York has a very contemporary feel. I love that there's no long wait and it's a lot more spacious than any of the NYC locations. I will definitely be back on a regular basis. Keep an eye out for their ever-changing weekly frozen custard flavors."}
{"text":"Wanted to see what all the hype was about. Here's my review... Burgers are good. The meat had good flavor and wasn't dry. The bread was soft but cold. The crinkle fries were ok considering crinkle fries are not really my thing. The concrete was the best thing I got. Service was great! Overall, it was just good to me. I don't know why people compare this place to In n Out because clearly there is no contest. In n Out will always be my number one. Its safe to say that I can cross Shake Shack off of my bucket list."}
{"text":"Shakes are amazing, as one would assume. I ordered the Chick'n Shack. The breeding is deep fried and so crispy with tender & moist chicken inside. The only shortcoming was that the sandwich is exceptionally smaller than in their ads and even the pics on there in store advertising (I mean literally 2/3 the size) which kinda was a letdown considering the price. I was still hungry after mine, which is never a good feeling. Other than that, good job."}
{"text":"THANK THE BURGER GODS BECAUSE SHAKE SHACK IS NOW ON THE WEST COAST.

Seriously though Shake Shack was one of my mandatory eats whenever I visited NYC and to have it only a mere 4 hours away from socal instead of a 5 hour plane flight away is AWESOME. I may have jumped up and down with pure glee as I found out they opened at the NY NY in Las Vegas.

Needless to say the flavor and service here is on par with the ones I had in NYC. I ordered my usual shroom burger and cheese fries and was salivating.  The shroom burger is absolutely delicious and full of flavor.  I prefer it over their cheeseburger, but their cheeseburger is also a great option. Their crinkle cut cheese fries were on point with the ones I had in NYC.

For the reviewers that are comparing it to In-N-Out, just don't. For one Shake Shack has a higher price point and is a bit more fancier than In-N-Out, which is a more fast food/grab and go.  Although you can get Shake Shack to go, most people eat it at the restaurant. Shake Shack also serves alcoholic beverages and has a bigger selection in its menu plus a weekly custard flavor.  The only reason people would say Shake Shack is the east coast's version of In-N-Out is because it was exclusive to the east coast like how In-N-Out is exclusive to the west coast.  So if you're a first time visiter to Shake Shack try not to compare it to In-N-Out because it's a different experience. I like both of them equally.

Location is obviously in the New York New York Hotel and Casino.  You can see it from Las Vegas Blvd since there is a huge sign for it and definitely reminds me of their NYC locations.  There is ample seating inside and outside the restaurant.  Service is quick, but the quality is still there.  If you want a good, cheap, on the strip, eat, this is a great place to go to for burgers."}
{"text":"I initially fell in love with Shake Shack in NYC several years ago and each time I visit the city, I have to get my fix. So now that it's in Vegas on the strip at the NY, NY Hotel; it's only right that I become acquainted with this location. So immediately after landing at the airport, we headed for this spot and everything from the entry to the exit was like my dream come true. Shake Shack has the best burgers, fries, and shakes HANDS DOWN!!!! No In&Out, no Fat Burger, no 5 Guys and definitely no mediocre chains can come close or dare compare to the deliciousness served here.

It's completely nuts in this location, the beautifully mastered burgers, fresh hot crinkle cut fries and thick custard shakes can really make my day phenomenal! If I win nothing in Vegas, as long as I eat here; I'm winning! The service at this location is extremely organized and well calculated in wait time. In a mere 5-10 minutes, my burger meal was ready to be indulged.

I'm grateful I don't live close enough to come here daily but when I am around you can rest assure...I will find my way back here.

Yes to everything about this place, I love it all!!!"}
{"text":"WOOOO, Shake Shack. I still have dreams about you.

I'm so glad we decided to cancel our original lunch plans to stop in here. Best decision we made all day.

The was a bit of a lineup, but it moved quite quickly. After ordering, we're given a buzzer which was cool. A little more organized than calling out numbers. The location was kept very clean and modern inside. It wasn't too hard to find seats, as there is a lot of turn over here and guests are considerate to leave once done their meal.

We wanted to try the original, so we ordered the double, draft root beer and a strawberry shake. All GREAT! The burger was just so melt in your mouth delicious. It was a tad salty, but that didn't stop me from devouring this beast.

The shake was sooo friggen good. I would go back just for a shake, but it would be hard to resist a burger. The root beer was only alright, I'm not sure I would order it again.

Overall, I was amazed. Burgers are one of my favourite foods, I'm not easily amazed by a burger, but when I am, it's so eye opening. 

This is a definite must when going to Vegas (or NY)"}
{"text":"I wanted to see what this place was about so I decided to come here during the Fourth of July weekend. It was around 9pm and the place was still pretty busy and packed because of a holiday weekend. I ordered the smoke shack burger with a vanilla shake on the side. The service was good, we just had to wait about 20 minutes for our food, which I understand because it was a busy night. The price is high (approximately $6 for a burger, $5 for a small shake and total with tax is $15). There is limited seating, however, we got lucky and found one outside. The burger was pretty good, along with the vanilla shake. Will I be back? Maybe if I'm around the area and really craving a burger and a shake."}
{"text":"One of my fav burger spots! Every time i come here the food is always fresh and hot. Staff is friendly, service is quick and store is always clean! Highly recommend Shake Shack."}
{"text":"SHAKE SHACK TAKEOVER!

I was surprised when I found out a shake shack opened in GVR, but I'm not complaining! We walked right in and got to order, with no line! The staff was wonderful. There was an employee cleaning and she made alot of conversation with us. She was pretty funny and I enjoy a good atmosphere. 

My first time at Shake Shack was in New York, but this location didn't disappoint. Sometimes when chains expand the quality goes down, but I didn't feel like that was the case here. Shake shack has pretty basic burgers, but they're quality basic juicy burgers and that's all a girl really needs! 

Everyone at the table got smoke stacks because who doesnt love a portobello on top of a burger! The mushroom really elevates the burger in my opinion. It was $10, which did feel a little pricey considering it didn't come with fries or a drink."}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack! So glad that we have an LV location that doesn't require me to go down to the strip. The one thing I don't understand is all of the people that compare this place to In 'N Out. They are different price points, different levels of quality and completely different business models. I just don't get it. 

I love Shake Shack's Smokeshack burger, it's delicious. A bit pricey, but the flavor is amazing. Their crinkle cut fries are great. I usually hate crinkle cut fries - theirs are actual the first ones that I've tried that I like! Their wines and beers on tap are pretty good (and I was pretty skeptical) and their seasonal salted caramel hot chocolate was amazing. I am super picky about hot chocolate (no way in hell I would drink that chemical-tasting packaged crap) and theirs was SO good. 

The service at this location is great. I've even been comped fries before with a burger for no reason. The food comes pretty fast, the restaurant (including the bathroom) is very clean, and everything about this location is better than going down to the strip!"}
{"text":"The Chick N Shack is hands down the best crispy chicken sandwich I've ever ate!  So much better than Chick-fil-A!  There's something about the combination of crispy chicken, pickles, & mayo that is great!  And these cheese-fries...a mouthwatering guilty pleasure!  I splurged and also ordered the Shack Attack. I have to say the Shack Attack concrete ice cream dish is a bit overrated and I expected more since it's description on the menu makes you want it instantly.  The food is made-to-order and fresh.  I liked that at this location, it was very open to outside but enough that you were still inside the restaurant; perfect for when it's too hot to eat outside but you still want some fresh air.  If you are looking for a typical greasy American meal, this is the place!  Too bad there isn't one near me in Wisconsin! :("}
{"text":"For lunch : Shroom burger is a must for all mushroom lovers. Well lit ambience, friendly staff, spacious place and unique twist on burgers. Will recommend and will come back. Line can get long so expect it."}
{"text":"Hey, not bad for a quick meal on the Strip. There can be a pretty long line, but if you're going to eat cheap, you can't do much better than this. The cheese fries are good and the burger was on the high end of fast food burgers I've had. There is a variety of seating inside and out. It can be tough to find a seat when it's busy, so you might consider sending someone from your party to scout for a seat while you wait to pick up the food at the counter."}
{"text":"The burgers are twice as good as In N Out.
Three times as expensive.

Not as good as some of the gourmet burger joints: like Burger Bar, or Bachi, or Fat Choy (that's the best burger for the money in Las Vegas!!!)

And insanely crowded. Who in their right mind lines up for a burger?

But....damn good.
Oh, and their fries are 50 times better than In N Out!"}
{"text":"Prices seem WAY more reasonable than on the East Coast for some reason? I got my usual Shake Stack and it was cheesier than I remembered, but delicious and filling nonetheless. It's a little pricier than In n Out but I do love the mushroom option. 

The real star? The loaded fries!!! Topped with cheese sauce, bacon and red bell pepper. That is the hung over person's cure. I would come back for that alone. 

Come early since the line can go out the door by 12 if you're planning on a lunch. Or come after the lunch rush. Wait for food will also take a little bit."}
{"text":"Good service. Good food. Everything was excellent. Smoke shack was really good. They put a cherry pepper relish that really sets it off. The bacon is very smokey. Delicious. The black and white shake was okay. Nothing special. The double shack burger tasted very good and fresh. Cheese fries were awesome. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I inhaled the food so fast that I didn't have time to take a photo (whoops!). If u don't know how I feel about Shake Shack, I LOVE IT! I wish they'd open one in Tucson. My favorite is the shake stack and the cheese fries is a must! I might be totally biased cuz I'm from NY but hey some of the best food comes from there."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way back from Utah, we decided to stop at this location instead of going to the one on the strip. As much as I love the food here, I cannot justify spending almost $30.00 for my husband and I on a burger joint when I can spend half of that on something like In-n-Out and have it be about the same quality. Anyway, the food is delicious, nonetheless! & I do like this location a lot better, plenty of (FREE) parking and easy to get to...and I emphasize \"FREE\" parking because almost everywhere on the strip charges for parking now, which is absolutely ridiculous. Although the service was somewhat slow at this location, the burgers are good, but my favorite would have to be the loaded fries and of course the peanut butter shake. Although I cannot say it is fair to compare this place to In N Out (even though I pretty much already did LOL) I do like both burger joints for different reasons, but my breaking point in this debacle is the price, and that's why I'm comparing the two. Overall, I do love Shake Shack, and I like this location MUCH better than the strip. Although it's kind of out of the way if you're just passing through, I'd much rather go to this location just to avoid all the Strip chaos."}
{"text":"2.5 stars to be exact not 3! I may be bias but I just wasn't feeling hype on shake shack. I will continue to profess my love to in-n-out! Forever and always! The fact of the matter is the price and substance you get just does not pan out. 

What I got:

the Shack Stack: (im not 100% if the name is right) but its the one that is the cheese burger and includes their infamous fried portabello mushroom stuffed with cheese. $9.95

this was alright but it was just TOO MUCH. I felt so heavy. the double cheese (cheese from the patty and cheese from the mushroom) was just way tooo much they should just have one cheese. It was small but surprisingly very filling. I would go back again for this but would never crave this....

Double shack burger: just a regular double cheese burger. No real special taste. just meh.... (IN-N-OUT Double double FTW! )

Cheezy Fries: i mean they tasted like fries.... frozen fries. and the cheese sauce on top was like melted nacho cheese. i just feel like i can get this at 7-11

organic ice tea: very refreshing. free refills.

overall, 
ill stick to inn-n-out. :)"}
{"text":"ALWAYS so delicious. Service is very attentive. Definitely get the bacon cheeseburger. The peppers add such a great flavor. Every time I pass through Vegas I stop and grab a burger. Oh! The fries are so yummy. You have to get them with cheese."}
{"text":"A bit of a long wait because popular but not bad  enough to complain. Service was excellent. I haye hot dogs. I am very picky about them. That being said, I loved the \"shack-cago\" hot dog. My Boyfriend got 2 regulat hot dogs. All were great."}
{"text":"We just happened to be passing by and saw Shake Shack in Downtown Summerlin. A friend had mentioned how good it was so we decided to try it. We were very disappointed. The hamburgers were so small but the fries were good. I was shocked to see the size of a small drink for $2.30!!! We surely will not stop by there in the future. That satisfied our curiosity!"}
{"text":"Un bon shake shack comme on les aime ! Spacieux, avec un large choix de boisson et de l'espace. Ajouté à cela un mur avec des écrans géants qui n'en font qu'un. 
Localisé au début du strip pour bien commencer votre visite ou votre soirée endiablée ;)"}
{"text":"Now that Shake Shack has a few locations in Vegas, it seems that the hype has died down just a bit. I've ordered from the Shake Shack located on the strip; this was my first visit to the outlet mall location. It was clean and it was empty (10:30am ish on a Saturday). 

Ordered the shack burger for myself and my bf decided to get a little crazy with the shack burger with the portobello mushroom on top. I honestly think there are far better burgers out there. Today at least, the burgers were so so SALTY! I'm not even a person that is salt aversive. The meat was so overly seasoned it was unbearable. Also, I really didn't like the shack sauce. The sauce made the buns all soggy and it was unappetizing. I SO prefer in n out to Shake shack. My other criticism is for the burger toppings. I GOT A TINY PIECE OF LETTUCE and a miniature slice of tomato. It was so pathetic. Is it really that much to ask for like TWO decent leaves of lettuce, tomatoes and pickles in a basic burger? Ay ay ay. 


My bf also thought the shack burger w the portobello thing was meh. The portobello mushroom is bread crusted and deep fried. The frying was done perfectly and the crisp outer shell provided the crunch and texture so needed in this burger. Beware the inside of the mushroom thing is FILLED with oozing cheese. It was really difficult to eat! 

Overall, the flavor is poor. It was very salty. Fries were good! Nice and crispy and had good fresh taste and not overly seasoned. The burgers are also lacking in toppings. A little more lettuce, a tomato and some pickles to contrast texture is much needed. I won't return to shake shack because really.... it's so much hype and no follow through."}
{"text":"Just as good as the ones in NYC but much closer to me! Seriously juicy, mouthwatering burger. Expect a line since it's on the strip and expect a bunch of drunk people after dayclubs satisfying their drunchies (guilty). The fries are crinkle cut and are good, but they're not superior to other places. The burger though is heaven. I was sad when I finished mine and was tempted to get back in line to order another (my friend actually did just that)."}
{"text":"5/5 Stars (coming from a former burger hater.. not a fan in general of burger joints)

Food: LOVE the Shake Shack burger, the touch of pickled peppers is amazing. (Peter Piper would be thrilled!) This is the burger that changed my view on burgers, the master of all burgers. I have tried a variety of the burger choices, which were all very well made and fresh each time. Never disappoints (have visited about 20 times and counting)! I am also a big fan of the crinkle fries, I love a good soft inside and a crispy crinkle! Even better with the cheese and/or bacon added.

Dessert: Smooth custards and concretes, their specialty flavors are a MUST. 

Drinks: The root beer on tap is my favorite (which mind you, I'm not much of a soda drinker)! So much flavor, just better than any old root beer. I recently tried their wine by the glass for the first time (red), and it's very smooth! Would order again! Next time I'll review the white wine.

As always, can't wait to come back. If you haven't been here, you're missing out!! HURRY!!"}
{"text":"It lived up to the hype! So good! We originally tried eating at the one in NYC but the line was too long - outside and wrapped around the building. 

We have since eaten twice at the one on the Las Vegas strip by New York New York and the one in Scottsdale, AZ. 

Highly recommend the Mint Shake! So delish! I order the Shack Burger. It's plenty to fill me up. So juicy and tasty. Fries are a la carte. 

It's definitely not cheap. Runs about $40 for 3 people. But we'll worth it."}
{"text":"Very tasty burgers and fries... Chocolate shake was amazing. Very crowded but worth the wait. Service was fast though."}
{"text":"3.6 Stars
Located at the end of the Brooklyn bridge outside of New York New York.

First impressions,  pretty big restaurant with lots of seating inside and outside patio, with heating lamps.  Big menu display as soon as you walk in.

Service was good, line moved fast.  The buzzer system was broken tho, our buzzers would go off, but our orders were not ready.

I ordered: 
Shackburger - its a good tasting cheeseburger.

Crinkle Fries - nice and crispy.

I liked the big screen TV's around the restaurant showing different sports.

{"text":"I'm from SoCal where In n Out reigns supreme. The Shake Shack is a low 3 for me. I've definitely had better from a fast food burger joint but the service here is always quick and friendly a 4 star for sure. However, in the rating for burgers these are pretty basic and average. Not a bad thing just not a 5 star for me. 
I'm so glad I didn't jump on the trendy train and wait for a seat to try them out. Glad that this location is accessible without a fuss. 
Location here is perfect as it is an anchor spot, not in the mall food court. So late night shakes are easy! 
A solid 3 for me and would return for a quick shake at the Shack."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience. The facility was very clean, and calm atmosphere. The food was good and quality was good. Did wait for a little while but that's what happens with fresh food! Will return for sure."}
{"text":"I love this place. My wife nagged me to go here because she saw this franchise on a movie somewhere and now I'm glad she convinced me to have a meal here. I tried their vegetarian burger (Disclaimer: I am meat eater through and through) and it was amazing. As the millennials put it: \"It was Amaze-Balls!!!!\" The shroom patty is fried to give it a nice crunchy texture and its dressed just like a regular burger. Everything else like fries and drinks are a la carte but worth the matchup. The store is conveniently appointed right next to The New York New York Hotel/Casino and usually gets packed early. If you want to try something quick and new... Come into this store!"}
{"text":"The view from the outdoor seating is fantastic. The location on the newly redone walkway outside NY NY is great. A beer or wine at a burger joint is a nice touch. Now let's talk about the food: Average at best. Certainly not worth the hype. In N Out and Fatburger, Five Guys and Umami Burger, all deliver much better. Sorry."}
{"text":"Shake shack burgers are delicious! I appreciated that they didn't have exaggerated portions and the burgers are very flavorful. Our friends said the caramel shake was excellent. The cheese fries were good but not the best I've had. The atmosphere is casual and the seating roomy. They also have a beer and wine menu."}
{"text":"It is just a superb experience. Worth the walk on the strip and Delish food to begin with.  a must try and I may say worth the try. 

Over all: it is indeed a 5stars experience."}
{"text":"Revived my interest in Shake Shack. The Grand Central, Times Square, CPW, DC locations were all a bit disappointing the last few times I tried, but I think this one really hit the mark, maybe because they're making it a point to set a good rep in farther flung markets, with talks of IPO and all that.

All items are recommended. Would rotate through and give everything a try. And I wouldn't invite comparisons to In N Out--they're pretty different. In general I think the individual ingredients here are more \"premium\" though the flavors aren't as unified or as unique as you might hope. I just had a burger from Belcampo in LA today that tastes about the same, except Shake Shack has better bread."}
{"text":"So the battle of the west coast burgers...
In-n-out weighing in at about $2-3 each vs. Shake Shack weighing at about $5-9

So this is a review for Shake Shack but let me give you a little comparison...
In-n-out:
--Mouthwatering? Yes. Both burgers and fries.
--Variety? Not really, but easily customizable.
--Shakes? Good. Nothing special.
--Line? Yes. Always but eh...it comes with the price of good food.
--Price? Yes. Post grad student friendly.

Shake Shack:
--Mouthwatering? Yes. Burgers and cheese fries are yum!
--Variety? Yes. From different burgers to hot dogs to shakes to fries and even for your dog friend. Great selection for everyone!
--Shakes? Good. Small though for what I'm paying for. Nothing to die for
--Line? Very long line. But it moves VERY fast so don't be turned down
--Price? Yeah...definitely on the pricey side...borderline not sure it's worth the price? 

Overall...I think I'm going to end up going to In-n-out more. But yes, I am a fan! I personally loved the Shack Stack the most. Very filling and flavorful. You're paying for a good meal. Cheese fries are also a delicious and worth. It certainly does live up to the hype, my wallet just might not survive if I come back too often.

Also, there's big screens right by the pick up area. You won't have to miss out on a single game going on ;)"}
{"text":"Shakestack burger.. with cheese fries.... HEAVENLY!!! It was easily one of the best burgers I've ever had. And the cheese on the fries were sooooo good. I loved it!! And I loved my nap right after too!"}
{"text":"I had been in the Democratic State Convention for four hours when it was time for a lunch break. I can't think of many more times in my life when a beer and something delicious were so important.

The line at this Shake Shack is ridiculously long, but I was really impressed with how fast they got everyone through--it's obvious they took care in the design and staffing to make sure folks don't have to wait too long to eat.

Recently, they added a fried chicken sandwich to their menu, and a fried chicken sandwich is one of the world's best foods. It was delicious, though I definitely should have added cheese. Also stuck with my usual cheese fries which are never disappointing.

Now, if you're a normal Shake Shacker, I'd definitely give the chicken sandwich a try. It's a nice addition for them and sticks to the quality and taste you're expecting. However, if you're an infrequent visitor, I'd probably stick with the burger (if that's your usual). The chicken sandwich is good, don't get me wrong, but it's not *as* good as the burger. 

After I finished eating, it was exciting and a little bit naughty to get to take the rest of my beer with me on my walk back to the convention. Don't laugh, it's the Reno girl in me."}
{"text":"Best burger in Vegas. Hands down. Exactly like the burger I enjoyed at Madison square park."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is where it's at! I ordered the Double Cheeseburger (protein style) no bun! Lettuce Wrap. It was delicioussssssssss! Made to perfection. So juicy. So yummy! My mouth is watering speaking about it. I also ordered the Bacon Cheese Fries! Oh so bomb! Nice clean tables. The staff was friendly and helpful. I will definitely eat here again next time I'm in Vegas or if I find one close to where I live. Thank you thank you thank you!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see that they have snack shack in Vegas because I didn't get the chance to try it in New York. So how was the burger from the prospective of a person who came from Texas? Actually it was pretty good. I like the style of their burger. Simple yet full of fresh ingredients, which is the key for great burgers. I also liked their fries a lot, and it would do for me. Well made burger and fries are my thing. Shake Shack definitely did it! And plus when you are hungry at midnight, what can beat a great burger? Furthermore, if you are really hungry, you can have their famous milk shakes. I didn't try it because I was focusing on their burger and fries. My friend tried their milk shakes and they said it was wonderful too. Not only they have traditional burgers, they also have options for healthy eaters. In short, check it out! If you are hungry, I am sure you will be well served."}
{"text":"Awesome service, burgers are great and the shakes are amazing! Very speedy with the order, tons of seating, and they show your favorite sports on numerous tvs!"}
{"text":"Cons: lemonade too sweet, burgers need a little flavor.
Pros: accepts military discount. Food very fresh. Many options. Good shakes. Burger bun is awesome. Staff friendly. Place clean. Water available for customers to get there own refills. Louisiana hot sauce available. Fries are great. Glad we came"}
{"text":"Someone in the kitchen is going crazy with the salt. Although the ingredients seemed good quality the burger was average."}
{"text":"Love trying different burgers and fries, just some good ole American food. Unfortunately they were just OK. Ordered the double cheeseburger, hot dogs, cheese fries, and the chicken sandwich. I did like the chicken sandwich, its  breaded and fried and comes with a flavored mayo. My husband really liked the cheeseburger. The meat was good quality they are just really small for the price. The cheese on the fries tasted weird , but the hotdogs were good but incoyld have made them at home just the same. They are over priced. Glad I tried but wouldn't go back!"}
{"text":"Saw a lot of ads for this place that made it sound great.   Was hoping for really good burgers, fries and shakes.

We ordered those three items and found them to be very close to McDonald's quality but at more than twice the price.  

The best part was the electrically pumped ketchup dispenser!

Bet this chain dies when they run out of advertising money."}
{"text":"I've heard of Shake Shack burgers when they were still in NY, so I was really excited to try them out when they came to AZ!

Their burgers ARE good BUT the only thing that did deter me from trying anything else was the the entire menu is A La Carte... each item starts a little over $2.50 + tax. For an individual person, a drink, fries, and burger would set you back about $15 + tax, and you don't really get a sizable meal for the price...

I know they take great care in making their food though, and the employees were helpful and nice when we ordered. I wouldn't mind eating here again, but the prices... I feel like I could get a bigger meal at a sit-down restaurant than at a \"high-end\" fast food joint.

So.. fan of their food!! But not a fan of their prices haha!!"}
{"text":"My first ever experience with Shake Shack was an interesting one.

I love the giant menu upon walking in. I didn't love that there was no menu to reference once you got to the actual register. Set up of the dining area didn't really make sense to me either. There was no clear walkway from between all the stations and tables.

The lady at the register was absolutely lovely. She was helpful and friendly, but I don't know how to say that without making you think of a naive minimum wage high school-er who hasn't had her enthusiastic spirit crushed by customer service yet. This lady was genuinely friendly. Extra star for her.

As for the food itself, I tried the spicy chicken sandwich, the shackburger, the fries, and the strawberry mint lemonade. I loved my spicy chicken sandwich. I think it's way better than the burger. It was actually seasoned and flavored. The burger relied on the shack sauce to save it, but the meat itself was plain. I'm not too big a fan of the buns used, but I did appreciate how it was cut so that the sandwiches kept their form. The fries are just fries, nothing wrong with them. The strawberry mint lemonade was actually too minty for me, but I just mixed in regular lemonade and it was delicious. 

I would definitely be down to get the chicken sandwich again."}
{"text":"My friends raved about this place coming into Vegas this weekend. We ended up saving it for our last day on Sunday with all of us finally together in the area. They had told me the standards were up to In n Out's, which is pretty high for me because I love that place. 

We got to New York New York and made it to Shake Shack, there was a bit of a long line but my friends told me that it was shorter than usual. I looked at their menu and decided to get the Smoke Shack which is their burger with smoked bacon and peppers.

However, I wanted a COMBO but came to realize that they don't give combos and you have to buy everything separate. Well that blows, I ended up paying $15 for a burger and shake only. $3 more if I wanted fries. 

So once I got my food, I was kind disappointed. The burger looked a bit sad but it taste okay, and the strawberry shake was probably the best. However, I would still choose In n Out over this any day. 

Overrated and over priced."}
{"text":"Never been to a Shake Shack and couldn't believe the hype, so I had to try it for myself. Was stuck on the strip and this is a cheaper food option, so why not. Is it a food burger? Yes, it's very good. Is it the best burger I've ever had? No, it's not. There's so many good burgers in this world now that Shake Shack can't hit 5 stars for me. And thankfully, I didn't have to wait in line or they might have gotten ranked lower. 

I will say that this place has 5* customer service. Employees are friendly and are working hard to clean up and give patrons a good experience. That's pretty rare for a fast food restaurant, so they're definitely doing that right!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and overrated #nothanks average burger for 8 $ and overall just not that good"}
{"text":"Easily the best burgers we've ever had, bar none. It was a little disappointed there's not one in Denver, but fortunately they appear to be opening one in 2018."}
{"text":"This place was clean and new so I was excited to try it BUT ... I got my meal to go and when I got home the special order that I asked for was botched. 
1- I asked for sauce on the side for my burger and there was none so I ate a burger dry.
2- when I asked for cheese fries I got plain old fries. 
I specifically paid for special orders 
When I called to complain I spoke with who claimed to be a manager and I was assured I would get a reimbursement in the mail so the lady took my address and after 2 MONTHS I got nothing. 
I was excited to try this place because it was on the news but it seems like a whole bunch of hype with horrible customer service. 
VERY DISSATISFIED!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night and the line was out the door.  Same as other reviews, everything tasted like it had been sitting there for a while. It may have tasted better if the burgers and fries were hot. For 2 burgers, 2 drinks and an order of fries = $29 is a bit pricey for fast food burgers. Not impressed with the burgers either.  We had their organic ice tea and mango lemonade drink. Tea tasted like tea and the mango drink reminded me of the cheap Sunny D drink that I had as a child.  So many better burger places around town that once the hype gets through this place, there won't be a line out the door anymore."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but shake shack to me is not that great. Yes, the cheese fries are better than in-n-out but they aren't spectacular. The only reason why I would come back to eat here is to try their shakes and custards. Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't horrible. People just made it seem all hyped up."}
{"text":"Burgers are okay, similar to in-n-out.  We had the shack stack that has a fried portobello in it.  The surprise was the melted cheese from the fried mushroom  dripping out as I bit on it.  
The chicken sandwich is also good, the meat is tender but the portion is very small.   
Cheese fries is so so, I would rather have an animal fries from in n out.
The shake has no size to choose from and a $5.50 shake is too expensive."}

In A Sentence
I've fallen in love with the arena cheeseburger all over again!

Quick Review
+ Best walk-up food available at any arena, anywhere.

+ Location, location, location! This is the arena's Shake Shack® listing.

- Queues get lengthy ... well ... because of the location: the arena.

Employee of Excellence
N/A. Or, that guy/gal anonymously making the burgers back there.

------------------------------------------

Note: This is for the arena listing. The Park listing is here: https://www.yelp.com/biz/shake-shack-las-vegas-2. Cheat sheet: if you're inside an arena named for crappy mobile service carrier, this is your listing. If you are near New York, New York casino, go to the other listing. There are two locations (believe it or not)! 

It's no revelation that when in an arena or stadium or ballpark or prison, one's choices are limited. It is typically between shit and more shit. Fortunately -- in Las Vegas -- there is Shake Shack. 

It's no secret, as there will be queues of patrons waiting to order, waiting to pick-up their already-placed orders, and to accessorize their orders with condiments. And, for times when I am not physically pinned to the barrier for a pit show, I'll meander over with all the other yuppies to Shake Shack for a burger, fries, and a shake. And you should too!

Final Thought
If you're at the Las Vegas Arena, for a game or show, this is pretty much the only legitimately good place to eat. Keep the hotdogs limited to baseball, please.

-----------------------------------------

Good for tourists.
Good for kids.
Not good for dogs.

{"text":"Yay I am a fan BUT being a socal girl, my allegiance is with In-N-out ! I will say that their crinkle fries are fresh and delicious plus the ambiance of Shack Shake is perfect."}
{"text":"This place is bomb.com ! I really love this burger place. Idk what it is but it beats alot of other burger places. This was my second time trying it out when i went to the states since im from hawaii. I wish they would bring one to hawaii! Lol 
The only downfall about this place is that its sooo crowded. Its so ridiculously crowded. No matter what time of the day you go its crowded lol that jus proves of how good this place is.
If you havent tried it yet then you better do so!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our meal here. I went with the single cheddar and hubby did the double cheddar. Both were cooked to order and very tasty. We shared an order of fries with the cheese on the side to dip. Fries were just the right texture and also had the perfect amount of seasoning. We did not order any drinks. It was good but I am not sure it would be something I would crave and have to come back to."}
{"text":"I personally didn't get the hype on this place. I'm giving it a 3 because the place was clean and the food was fresh but other then that the burger was bland. The only thing I liked was the fries and the hot dog but even then it wasnt worth waiting 20 minutes in line for."}
{"text":"Been twice in three days to this place, and both times I was served by the same cashier Danielle, she alone takes 2 of my 4 stars. Great service!

Chicken burger was very dry and a little salty the double shack burger was salty af though the meat was cooked perfectly. Cheese fries were delicious."}
{"text":"Too much $$$$$ for so little to eat. The cheese fries with bacon. Yuk yuk only have 2 stars for a clean place sorry will not come back unless it is free"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and myself tried it for the first time today and it was great! The customer service was awesome, people seem very happy that you're there. Super busy atmosphere, yet they get everything up and going! The only thing is that I was hoping for was bigger portions, but the shake filled me up real quick! So if you have a big appetite, definitely order a shake to fill you up!!"}
{"text":"On my first night here it was kinda messy.  So after everything was settled down, we went down from our hotel room and was looking for a place to grab some food.  It was about 12am on a Saturday night so I was expecting some fast food.  Well as it turns out Shake Shack was close by and I had it bookmarked for the longest already.  I glanced at the menu and ordered the Shack Stack.  

My burger was delicious.  The buns were solid, the meat was crispy juicy and tender.  The veggies (tomatoes and lettuce) were fresh and tasted great too.  Maybe I was super hungry but I thought this was one fine tasting burger.  The quality was definitely up to par with my expectation.  The fries were really crispy too.  I was very impressed with how my food was able to remain hot during our walk back to the room.  We kicked it all night just eating and having a nice blast.  

The service was wonderful.  Being this was the first meal of my stay, I was left with a great impression immediately.  I knew this was gonna be a great vacation trip.  The place was super packed and it did take quite a while for my food to arrive but that's understandable considering it was a Saturday night.   Overall it was a great burger joint.  Probably the best fast food burger joint on the strip.  

PS don't get the half and half though, I could hardly taste the lemonade at all."}
{"text":"I heard all the hype about this place, so a couple weeks ago a friend and i tried it out. We came to the conclusion it's an overpriced, overhyped fast food place. Trendy and hip, the food is good albeit small overpriced portions. Walk up and order no sit down service. Easy to get to location but no one factor here draws us to return."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with Shake Shack! I love their logo, their signs, the color scheme, and most importantly, their soft, tender, juicy burgers! Prices are a little high but it's worth it. It pretty much tastes like In-N-Out Burger, but you get a cooler ambiance. The fries are crispy and pair perfectly with the burgers. I really want to try their shakes! I went to the Shake Shack in Miami and this one in Scottsdale, they are both super good. I sat outside on the patio at lunch with my husband as we ate our burgers and fries. We didn't have to wait long for our food, maybe 7 minutes, and it was nice because they give you a buzzer so you can sit down and come up and grab your food when the buzzer goes off. The patio area is really pretty! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly
The burgers here are much better than In and Out Burger
The bacon fries are to die for
Nice decor
Will be back to try a shake"}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong at Shake Shack.  Everything is delicious but beware, it can get expensive.  

A group of us came here on a friday afternoon for lunch after driving for about 3 1/2 hours from LA.  The line looked daunting but it actually was not too bad. They have many registers opened and the line went by pretty fast.  My boyfriend and I both ordered the Shack Stack, shared an order of crinkle cut fries, and a large soda.  Total came out to about $30 (OUCH) but it was worth it.  Especially that shack stack burger!!!!! It's even more worth it if you add bacon to it.  But be careful because it can be VERY hot when you bite into that cheese filled mushroom (yummmm).  Fries were crispy and perfect.  

I definitely miss Shake Shack now that we've returned to reality.  Hopefully the next time I take a bite of that shake stack burger, it would be at the original location in New York City :)"}
{"text":"Insanely good burgers and shakes. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality burger. The fries are eh, comparable to Del Taco's. And their prices are very high but for the quality is worth it from time to time."}
{"text":"After hearing about shake shack, we decided to check this place out.  I ordered the hamburger and my bf ordered the shake stack.  The burgers were really good, better than in n out in my opinion.  The restaurant was sorta packed so it was hard to find seating.  There are a lot of tables inside and there are some tables outside too.  I didn't see any workers wiping down the tables after people left so there was a lot of trash and crumbs left on the tables.  The prices for the burgers and drinks aren't bad at all for Vegas.  There's also a separate line for people who just want to order shakes/drinks/ice cream."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Had the best cheeseburger and French fries I've had in a long time!!!! Would definitely recommend the atmosphere was great they also had a football game on that everyone was watching at the time."}
{"text":"First bite's amazing but it will leave you feeling heavy...

Stack Shack Burger - in addition to the patty, there is a deep fried mushroom that has melting cheese oozing out in every bite. You know that feeling when you meet someone new that excites you? Well this burger was simply that. However after a couple of more bites, you start to feel like it's a bit more than you can handle. Definitely something you eat once in a while.

The second time I came back, I tried the Shack Burger which is a more classic burger. Patty was juicy and packed with tons of flavor. My friend and I decided to share 1 order of fries. If you love fries like me, know that that was a terrible idea. When I saw the fries I told my friend I wish I had ordered 2. The girl working there heard me and gave me an extra order of fries, seriously made my day!

Now coming from California you know I'm going to throw out the In-N-Out comparison. To be honest I feel like In-N-Out's simplicity is easier to eat without feeling too guilty, it's also less expensive. In terms of the classic burger I'll stick with In-N-Out. However Shake Shack's unique Stack Burger is a winner in itself. It's something I'll definitely crave from time to time that I can't get anywhere else."}
{"text":"The cheddar fries are amazing!!! I ordered the double shack burger and cheddar fries. The shack burger just had the basic lettuce, cheese and tomato which allows you to savor every bit of goodness from the burger patty.  So good!!! Not overly crowded either if you go to the downtown summerlin location. Staff regularly goes around and cleans up scraps from table and refills the drink. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my boyfriend when I was a little drunk and needed some fries to satisfy my cravings. The place is clean and modern looking. I ordered the double down fries which have cheese, bacon, and red peppers on it. Super yummy and some of the best drunchies! I'd definitely come back to try some of the burgers!"}
{"text":"What is not to like??????? U get that camelshack concrete if u want to know what heaven is like. Fries extra crispy. That burger with crisp lettuce and buttery bun. Ugh this place is so good. I am a California transplant and I'd say this place rivals in n out burger for sure. Would give 5 stars but it's extremely pricey for a burger joint. They do serve beer and wine too so maybe that sets them apart"}
{"text":"Food was okay. I read really good things about Shake Shack so maybe my expectations were too high. I t their cheese fries, peanut butter shake, and a burger that was called the Shacka something or other. 

Fries were average. Shake was average. The burger had fried shallots which were a great addition. Put that on the list of ideas that someone should have thought of sooner. My issue is that the burger seemed kinda smallish. I got the double and paid $8.99 I think. I guess for that amount I'm either expecting a larger burger or one with premium meat.

The burger wars are really heating up on the Vegas strip and Shake Shack benefits from a great location just outside New York New York.  Overall I'd put this place maybe on par with Bobby Flay's place a block down but nowhere near as good as the Broadway Burger Grill inside NY-NY."}
{"text":"One of the individuals in our group wanted to eat here since I guess they are primarily only found back east. When we got there, it wasn't super busy, but it had a long enough line for us to read the menu & figure out what we wanted before going up to order. I decided on the Smokeshack and the group got enough fries for everyone.

The fries were pretty good, but the cherry peppers on my burger just overpowered everything & just made the flavor of the burger one note. Now I love spice & I love heat, but not to trade off flavors. I had no clue if the burger patty was well seasoned, or if the bacon had any apple wood smoke flavor. For those in my party who ordered shakes, they said they were 'good', but did not rave about them.

It was ok, but I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday for an early lunch after a weekend of drinking. I heard so much about Shake Shack and expected something that would blow my mind. Although it was a good burger, it wasn't anything crazily special.

The line was surprisingly very short and I ordered within a couple minutes of entering the place. They give you a buzzer thing that vibrates when your order is ready. I got the Shack Burger (single) and fries. There was no combo option and every item on the menu needed to be purchased separately. The meat in the burger was thick and juicy. I really enjoyed the burger, but wished I got a double patty because it was a bit small. The fries weren't that great and I wouldn't get them again. Next time I would get a bigger burger and no fries.

Seating was somewhat difficult to find for a group of 5. I can't imagine how difficult it would be to find a place to sit if it was a busier time.

Overall, I would recommend this spot if you're in the area and want a change from the typical In-N-Out! I don't know how it compares to the Shake Shacks in New York, but it's pretty good."}
{"text":"To be honest, I don't really understand the hype. Shake Shack has been described to me as this glorious burger and fries joint that I need to try before I die, but honestly, the food was just ok.

Maybe after getting my buzz on, the food would be pretty acceptable. But it just tastes like a fast food burger and fries but at a higher price.

The fries were cold when they came out. Maybe if they were burning hot, it would have tasted better. The cheese is kind of cheap tasting.

I think I'm just comparing the food here to other places in Vegas. There are just much better places around here to get burgers and better places to get loaded fries.

If you need a recommendation, let me know (: I'm a local. 

I did like the ambience here though."}
{"text":"It was good, but just didn't live up to the hype. I'd prefer to just go to In-N-Out for a fraction of the cost.  The burgers were good, not too big or small and allow you to have enough room to finish your shake.  They made a big deal about \"Malting\" the shake but I couldn't really tell the difference.  It's worth checking out if you are in the area, but not worth a special trip."}
{"text":"What can I say? Great burgers and incredible shakes, topped off with outstanding service! This place is a no brainier.

Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday and the restaurant was booming. Plenty of customers but the service was quick and extremely friendly. We were a group of 4 and our food was out in under 5 minutes with a steady line half way to the door. 

First off, the burgers are a little on the simple side but the meat inside really shines. You can distinctly taste the level of quality in their meat. Well cooked, seasoned, and put together. Now I wasn't overly impressed by the fries, however the simplicity of the crinkle cut spuds well matched the shack's relatively basic burger offerings. 

On to the shakes.. Now this is where they really impressed me. I tried the brownie batter (shake of the week), and my son, the strawberry. Both were impeccable. Flavor, texture, you name it.. all exactly what I was hoping for. Overall we were all thoroughly pleased with our visit and will without a doubt visit again."}
{"text":"Shake shack is good but will never be in n out, which I am addicted to haha however, I love their chicken sandwiches and forsure recommend the cheese fries!!! They have lovely ice cream shake options as well. I have yet to try their hot dogs although I've heard great things"}
{"text":"First time with my son- a food connoisseur or so he believes- & wasn't blown away by it- except for the cheese fries (wow!)- everything was kind of like every other burger place around. Kind of missed the pizzazz it could have!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack is a fan favorite for many burger lovers. The place has Vegetarian options like the Shroom Burger. The place is always packed since it is right on the strip. When we walked in there was a long line. However, there were plenty of cashiers so it went by pretty quickly. You have a huge menu to look at while you are in line, so you can explore and really think about what you want to order. It is not convenient to get to. When you park in the NY NY parking garage, it is a pretty long walk, which is the reason for me putting only 4-stars. 

Service: It was good. The interactions with the workers are fairly short. The woman who took our order was nice. She was patient with us as we asked many questions about the menu and her opinion on the food. You pick up the food after your buzzer goes off. You grab your own condiments, napkins, drinks, and utensils. The cashiers are the ones grab the beer for you. If you want to stop by only for the custard, I recommend waiting in the short line outside. There is an express window for the custard. 

Ambiance: The place is loud. Sometimes you will encounter drunk folks coming here. Just ignore them. It is great for kids since they can be as loud as they want. There is outside seating as well. The set up is organized. The place looks clean. I would have someone grab a table right when you walk in. They get taken up pretty fast! 

Food: Delicious. I got the Shack Stack, cheeseburger with the Shroom Burger combined. It is SOOO GOOD! I would never want to eat another burger unless it has the fried portobello mushroom in it. lol We also got the fries, which were meh. They were fries. Nothing epic or special. For dessert, we got the custard with red velvet mix in it. This is very good and I highly recommend it. 

Price: Fairly priced. I would say it is around $15 a person. 

Drinks: Any alcohol you buy on the strip is overpriced. The soda drinks are decently priced at around $2. That is the average for this area. 

Overall, it was a great experience that you recommend for you to experience! But, I must warn you the food is not as good as the Shake Shack in DC or NY and I don't know why."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but this place is WAYYY overpriced. My wife and I almost walked out. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Last stop before heading back to LA. I ordered the shroom burger which consisted of crisp fried portobello mushroom with cheddar cheese topped with lettuce, tomato, and shack sauce. I really enjoyed biting into the fried portobello mushroom because it had a crunchy texture. My friend ordered the smoke shack burger, which was a cheeseburger and consisted with ranch bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and shack sauce. He did not like his burger at allllllllll. He didn't even finish it considering how small the burger was!!! We also got the cheese fries, which was delicious the cheddar cheese they used was like nacho cheese. YUMMY.

Overall, I'm a bit disappointed coming here because the burger was small and it was double the price of how much you would normally pay for a in and out burger. (like everyone says) If I had to choose between in and out or shake shack, hands down I give it up in and out. Sorry not sorry lol.  Also, the wait was pretty long considering it was a Tuesday afternoon. We had to wait about 30 mins in order to get our food."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Shake Shack in Las Vegas this past weekend and I have to say it was a really good experience.  We got there past 8PM and there was a line out the door to order food.  We noticed that there were tables inside and outside and since we had our kids with us, we picked a table outside.  I then lined up and it was very organized, someone was manning the door and handing out menus.  I don't believe I waited in the line long at all.  I ordered our food and then they give you those square things to alert you when your food is ready.  The food was actually VERY good and fresh.  We got a couple of shack burgers, fries, choc shake, a grilled cheese for my daughter.  The staff also keeps the whole place clean.  Very clean.  I can't wait to visit one in New York!"}
{"text":"This was my second time having Shake Shack. The first was in NYC three years ago and I still remember how good it was. So this was my place to hit up in Vegas this time, since the last two trip we came up short. I might have to give Shake Shack a slight edge over IN & Out burgers due to the fact that their burgers patties are more juicy and well season then IN &Out and plus they serve \"BEER\".

What was ordered:
Shack Stack Burger: Cheeseburger w/Shroom Burger lettuce and tomato and Shacksauce. Man what a great combination. The patty was perfectly cook and season and the portobello was battered and fried to perfection. For $9 yes it pretty pricey , but it's good. 

Shack Burger: Cheeseburger w / Lettuce and Tomato and Shacksauce. Delicious! 

Fries: This was ok. IN&OUT fries are still better and made fresh.

Yeah I'm definitely a fan of Shake Shack and can't wait until they open up one down here in southern California soon."}
{"text":"Went here with friends was super excited been waiting to try it since they opened got there line not long the staff however didn't seem to know how to keep the flow of people moving they also called your name when the order was ready but they need a microphone because the music was so loud you could barely hear them . The food was not up to par i spent $14 my friends together spent $31 they ordered milkshakes which they said weren't cold all the way through i had cheese fries barely any cheese on them and they had a weird taste i would prefer Wendy's fries to these the burger was okay nothing special the bun was too small for the patty and was soggy they were also out of grape Fanta which is okay but for what I'm paying i expect to get the drink i wanted one of my friends pointed out they had crap WiFi so if you're going to finish uploading a paper go somewhere else all in all i won't be returning not worth the 25 minute drive or the money spent on the food"}
{"text":"First time here and trying out Shake Shack for the first time. Got here at 10:50am and there's people waiting at the door already. This place opens at 11am. The line moved really fast. The wait order took about 5 minutes. I ordered to go. Chick n Shack, Shack Stack and Fries. 

It was a beautiful, warm day so why not sit outside in the shade. Plenty of tables and chairs outside. Great way to people watch. 

The Chick n Shack was good. It was sort of bland & dry at first until I added mayonnaise. Wow! Mayo totally made a big difference. Tasted so much better. 

The Shack Stack was very good. Served hot, right off the grill. Cheesy, crispy portobello and charred beef patty was a great combo. Wasn't salty at all. Fries were delicious. 

$20+ for 3 items. Not bad compared to other fast burger joints on the strip. Portion was rather small but it was worth it. We enjoyed our lunch. We'll definitely be back when we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Drooooolllll, need I say more? This place has moist burgers that are just so awesome. My guy said that the only thing he did't like was the portion. He's a big eater, he loves to eat. So the perfectly portioned burger for my 5'0\" frame, does not work well for a manly 5'8\" frame dude. Well.... sorry dude, why you gotta eat so much?! :P

Anywhoos, first ate this in NYC, so... it just brings me back to awesome NYC. Ugh... and in all places it is in NEW YORK NEW YORK CASINO hahhaha

My love for burgers have been rekindled due to this place :) I heart you Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"One great tasting burger. Had the double smokehouse and let me tell you the soft potato bun compliments the soft angus beef and gooey cheese. The bacon is not chewy and undercooked. The red peppers add a small kick of spice and flavor that makes this burger taste like a gourmet burger at fast food prices. 
The vanilla shake taste like a Haagen Daz pint in drink form. They definitely use quality ingredients in everything that they do. Eat here and I guarantee you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I would like to give them more stars but I just was not impressed. From all the hype that I heard about this place, I was expecting something better. I'm not saying it was bad, it was definitely good, just nothing to write to mom about. 
So my wife and I were in Las Vegas for her company's offsite. Luckily, we were staying at New York, New York so Shake Shack was right in front of our hotel. We got in line about 11am, we had just flown in. Line was pretty long despite having a few registers open. The menu was simple, burgers, sides, custards/shakes, and drinks. I decided to order the Smokeshack, cheese fries, and an iced tea. My wife got the original shack burger. 
For 2 burgers, 2 fries and a shake and drink, we spent nearly $30. I understand we are in Las Vegas and on the Strip none-the-less but, come on, $30 for burger and fries? 
My next complaint although, not specifically Shake Shack's fault, but our seats were \"stolen\" as we were sitting down. The only seats available at the time were, bench seats with small coffee table seats. I placed out stuff down on the seat to tend to my infant daughter and these two women decided to just place their meals on our small table. Basically, pushing us out. Thank you, someone else saw what happened and they were done with their meal and offered their table to us. I know the seating there may seem trendy and fashionable, but knowing the popularity of this place, it would be nice to have more tables and chairs. 
When we walked in, i expected that it would be a long wait because the line was pretty long, we waited about 20 mins to order. Then I would say 45-40 mins just to get our meal. That is just a little too long for burger and fries. Especially, since what you are serving is simple. We had enough time to feed my daughter her baby food and finish her milk, before we even got our food. 
We finally get our food, The burger was ok, tasted a lot like Wendy's cheeseburgers. The buns were soft and cold, I usually like toasted buns, it gives extra flavor and texture to my burger. Mine came with bacon and hot peppers, which went well with the burger. The bun seemed too soft to hold the contents of my burger, when I got half way through it, the bun had become a flat piece of paper. My biggest complaint would be that the portions were really small. That burger was probably no bigger than a slider. For the amount of money we paid, I would still expect it to be just a little bit bigger. The fries were great, the cheese sauce did not taste like it came out of a can, so I can appreciate that. 
I didn't order the shake but my wife did and I tried it, it was not bad, just very rich. 
My overall experience wasn't bad. I expected fireworks but i just go a small party popper. I don't know if I would be returning any time, people say the one in actually New York, was way better. I guess I would have to try that if I ever make it to New York. I was hoping for consistency, much like my favorite fast food chain, In-N-Out. I explained to the people who said the NY one was better, but as a company, consistency should match to be called a Shake Shack burger."}
{"text":"When I went here the food was nothing special. I'm a vegas local so being on the strip is just annoying but I will say their service was fantastic! They were all very nice and friendly. It's just that the food reminded me of in n out. Which is not a bad thing, it's just average."}
{"text":"Love this place.   The burgers are awesome!
Shakes are the bomb.   The fries are A+ crispy crinkle cut.   10 beers on tap.   All good."}
{"text":"I think I might have found a burger place that can finally compete with In N Out. I tried Shake Shack once before, but I wanted to try again one more time before I can give a comparison. This location is located inside New York New York. I heard and read about the long lines here, but both times, I have been lucky and there was minimal lines. The employees here try very hard to move everyone along so the lines here move fairly quickly. 

I have tried here the Shake burger (which is their normal hamburger with tomatoes, lettuce, onion, and cheese), fries (which are crinkle cut), cheese fries and vanilla shake. I have to give Shake Shack the edge (BARELY) on the burger and fries. The burger is delicious and tasty, with all the ingredients and meat tasting so fresh. The fries are crispy and oh so tasty. But, I am going to give it up to In N out for their animal fries (their version of cheese fries) and the shake. The cheese fries at Shake Shack tasted a little bland. It was pretty much the crinkle cut fries with cheese melted on it. Nothing special. The shake was also a bit of a let down. There was just nothing special about it. I had figured for the price I paid for it (which was a little more expensive than In N Out), it would be amazing. 

So, bottom line, which do I like better??? I don't know!! I think both places are good, with certain items being better at each restaurant. I am sure I will change my mind each time on which is better.  For the time being, I am going to be happy knowing there are 2 fast food places that are so good and tasty."}
{"text":"The line was excruciatingly long and the substitutes I wanted made to my concrete were not available. As for the food, it was fine. I was not too terribly impressed. It was difficult to find a place to sit. The concrete wasn't as good as I'd hoped. The mint shake, the holiday special, however, was good."}
{"text":"Do you want a delicious burger? Do you want a milkshake? DOES YOUR DOG WANT ICE CREAM? Do you like crispy fries +/- cheese? Do you like friendly service? 

It is what it is, it's very good at what it does, believe the hype, don't listen to the haters, and treat yoself."}
{"text":"The burgers are great

Focus on burgers

Nevermind the fries

Focus on burgers

Shakes are great with excellent non-shake beverage selection

Sure is expensive, but if you got your moneys worth it just wouldn't be Vegas"}
{"text":"I've been hearing great things (or rather, seeing great pictures on IG) about Shake Shack for a while, and I finally got to visit this past weekend. 

My family and I tried to swing by for lunch on Saturday, but a gas line in NYNY broke, so all the restaurants there weren't able to cook anything. That meant no burgers. Boo. The next day, I called ahead (no long wait on the phone!) and was able to talk to the manager, who i believe is named Paul, and I confirmed that they got their griddles fixed! 

So we got to Shake Shack right when it was supposed to open at 11:00am, but I guess they decided to open earlier to make up for lost sales the previous day because there was already an impressive line. No biggie though, the line moved so quickly that my group wasn't even ready to order when we got to the front. 

I liked that there were plenty of options on the menu, but it wasn't overwhelming. I ordered the SmokeShack burger, cheese fries and a root beer float. They gave us one of those vibrating restaurant pagers while we waited. The food came out in a reasonable time seeing how busy it already was. When we got our food, I felt like the burgers seemed smaller than I thought they would be. The SmokeShack still tasted great though! Love the bun and cherry pepper. The fries were my definition of perfect fries. Golden and crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. The root beer float tasted like your everyday root beer float, should've ordered a shake seeing how it is called Shake Shack, but I'll do that next time.

Awesome that they have an express line (C-Line) for drinks and cold items as well as a little Photo Booth that they make gifs out of apparently.

Definitely would love to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Well, I have been waiting to try this place. Unfortunately, it was not worth the wait.  I thought that the food, especially for the price I paid would have been tastier. The atmosphere, with flood lights above - could use a design change. If you want to try shake shake, you might as well go to a fast food place, same quality 1/3 the price."}
{"text":"We've been looking forward to eating at Shake Shack since we don't have a location in northern CA. Since we were in Las Vegas, it was on our bucket list. We loved it! The buns are unique...so soft. I liked that the burgers aren't gigantic. I love that the meat is hormone-free. They accidentally place my order as being a hotdog instead of a cheeseburger. When I went to the counter, they quickly refunded my money and immediately had my burger reader. The shakes were perfect. Ordered a chocolate frozen custard to share. Perfection!"}
{"text":"I was to Shake Shack once before but that was for a Yelp event.  I came back to try the place when it wasn't as crowded and busy as when I was there the first time.

Since we were served at the Yelp event, I didn't know the routine of entering the right doors, placing your order, getting your buzzer, and then waiting for the food to be ready.  A gentleman leaving told me to go in the other door and order there.

After looking at the menu for a short time, I got two SmokeShack burgers--cheeseburgers with bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and ShackSauce. I ordered two fries with cheese.   I also ordered two regular iced teas.  I then took the buzzer, took my seat, and waited for for the buzzer to go off.  There was no drink until you picked up the order which is a minus for me.  I could have gotten some ice water but why no drink while you sit there?

In a reasonable amount of time, the buzzer went off and I collected dinner for the two of us from the pick up area.  The burgers were OK.  The bacon was good as was the tang from the cherry peppers but I got no flavor from the ShackSauce at all.  It was a colossal mistake to get the cheese fries.  That was partially my fault.  I should never order fries with any topping.  The cheese on these fries was overwhelming and it made the somewhat soggy fries even more so.  Naked fries as the best fries in my book.  Before we were finished, the fries were a soggy heap that would have made good food fight material.

We decided we'd try a concrete for dessert.  My wife wanted the Red Velvet and I got the S'mores.  After ordering, the counter critter told me their regular blender wasn't working and that the concrete would have the normal mix ins on top.  Really, one of your claims to fame is your concrete and you have one blender.  That's like saying our regular grill is broken.  Is a frozen patty OK?  They weren't concretes and even if the accoutrements had been mixed in, I don't see how this frozen custard could ever be called \"concrete.\"

In summation, it was worth a try.  There are so many better options where you can get your own drinks and refills.  And, you don't have to go through the ordering line all over again."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best veggie burger I've ever had. Been a pescotarian for over 15 years and have tried many, many veggie burgers...some have been interesting to say the least. 

Shake Shack, you're doing it right! Being a native Cali girl, I wish In n' Out could add a better veggie option to their menu. OR Shake Shack, you could make a run for it in Cali."}
{"text":"Their burgers are AMAZING!! I also enjoyed their shakes. I don't like their location which is outside the NY NY but its worth it."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to drive to NYNY! So first time trying here! OMG, The line was out the door but it went by kinda fast. They give u a buzzer while you wait and look for a table...All the tables were full inside but thank god we found a table quickly! Kids loved there hotdogs, fries and choc shakes and our double cheese burger was just ok, just a regular burger! We also tried one the concretes with vanilla custard, toffee and cheese cake and was pretty good...I really liked the cheesecake!!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating here and I was thoroughly surprised by there quick ticket times for how busy they are and the quality of there food. I ordered the chicken sandwich was very good with a side of cheese fries. You must try the cheese fries!! I will definitely come back and i look forward to trying a burger and some ice cream. The only thing I would knit pick is the size of there small soda which is like a kids cup and the fact that they don't carry ranch dressing."}
{"text":"First off, the young guy at the counter was sweet and helpful.  He recommended I try the burger and I should have listened to him.  I was too hungry to read thoroughly and ordered the schroom burger.  My mistake as it was not good at all.  The chocolate shake was a letdown as well. It tasted like a protein drink with ice cream.  Very disappointing to spend $14 on a sub par meal.  I'm sorry for the sub par review, but very disappointing for an adorable establishment."}
{"text":"Yum! I was drunk during my 1st Shake Shack experience because well this is Vegas, but it wouldn't make it any less delicious if I were sober. I inhaled my cheeseburger and bacon cheddar fries in 0-100 real quick. Burger was juicy. Fries were cheesy and bacony. What mode could you ask for for cheap eats on the strip. I think this is the best tasting value in Vegas. 

I would love to be able to try all the other menus items. Will return. Tasty."}
{"text":"Shake Shack has been on the must try list for years, there's none in Oregon where I live.  When I rolled up to the main one next to New York-New York I didn't want to pay the outrageous valet so I had the brilliant idea of driving 4 miles to this one.  Shame on me as they charge $5 to park in the outlet mall parking lot.

Then you sift through a massive crowd - a good portion riff raff - to reach the promised land.  The place was a zoo.  I was tempted by the cheese fries.

I rank premium fast food burgers as follows: Fat Burger, In-n-Out, Shake Shack, What-a-Burger, Five Guys, and Smashburger."}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had in my life!  This beats out five guys and any other burger place you can think of.  I was truly impressed. I am super excited that they will be opening one in Dallas.  It is a little pricey, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"In N Out Burger wannabe. Except not as good, double the price and frozen fries that look like Ore Ida from a grocery store. Not impressed at all. Had to send my burger back because it was raw in a few spots. Had it remade as \"well done\" and it was still luke warm and the $1.89 extra bacon was cold on BOTH burgers.
No thanks Shake Shack.
I will continue to eat burgers at In N Out for half the price and twice the quality.
Honestly, I feel ripped off."}
{"text":"The meat was incredibly bland and the bread was soggy.  The Shack Sauce made us feel sick. The good things were the bacon, which is hard to screw up; the lemonade was good; and fries were very crispy. Buyer beware: much better burgers are available for a lot less money. Bettter off going to 5 Guys in the food court."}
{"text":"Shake shack. My girlfriend raved about this place days and days before we visited Vegas, I must say one of the best burgers I have ever tasted, and yes it lived up to the hype that she told me about. Next time we will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Shackburger - double: very greazy!
Fries: pretty good
Iced Tea: pretty good
When the orders were ready for our group, they forgot a couple items and it wasn't even busy. 
I give one star because i think the burger was way too greazy, the second star is for the person who walked around the dining area several times to make sure everyone at each table was doing alright and asked if they needed anything. although we did ask to refill two cups. they brought the refills to us, but they forgot what was in each drink. and of course, the two people ended up with the wrong drink and had to swap.
We'll be sticking with In-N-Out :)"}
{"text":"If you want a good quality burger go to shake shack! When I eat a burger I always use a good amount of ketchup to add flavor. This burger did not need any ketchup. From the first bite this burger was amazing! I will be back."}
{"text":"Welcome to yet another one of my neighborhoods, Shake Shack!

Here's to my first Shake Shack grand opening since they expanded into DC a few years back. If you've been to any other locations, you know what to expect and it will not disappoint. If you've never been and swear by any other burger joint, please give it a try.

It's got the usual aesthetic vibe featuring those signature and well-crafted wooden tabletops & benches. There's also a fair amount of patio seating with plenty of shade that will come in handy as it starts warming up.

Went with my usual first meal of a ShackBurger and Shack-cago dog. Excellent per usual. Fresh, quality ingredients and big flavor. Mango lemonade & strawberry shake were both fantastic as well.

Definitely happy to have Shake Shack right around the corner from me (again). Now if they would just add delivery service..."}
{"text":"I always order the 'shroom burger, but this is the first time I ordered it here in LV. The cheese wasn't as melted as the ones I've ordered before in NY.  Instead it had a gummy texture. You can do better than that, Shake Shack Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Holy crap!  So I love love love the shack stack. How can you not love 2 portobello mushroom caps stuffed with cheese and then breaded and deep fried ON TOP OF your burger.  But I had seen pictures of the chicken shack and decided to give it a whirl.  Holy crap!  It's the first sandwich where the actually sandwich looks like the pictures.  It has this perfectly crispy exterior with an incredibly soft and juicy interior.  I had it Friday for the first time and couldn't stop thinking about it.  Today I went there before the airport and just got 2 chicken shacks.  Nothing else.  Incredible."}
{"text":"Unquestionably the king of the quick burger. Better than Five Guys, In n Out, and Whataburger. 

There is nothing that is not pure perfection when it comes to Shake Shack. The shack sauce is amazing, the burgers are insanely tender, and the crinkle-style fries are like heaven. 

The shakes are awesome too. And grab a 50/50 while you're there (basically an Arnold Palmer). 

I cannot recommend going here any higher to you."}
{"text":"Great new addition to the community. The parking lot in front of the burger place is limited, but be encouraged you can park in the shopping center behind the place. You will get some of your steps in with the parking situation. I came on a Saturday early evening and it was packed. The line was out the door. I am all too familiar with the brand and quite enjoy their shakes. I got the regular burger with the shack sauce, fries, and a cookies and cream shake. The cookies and cream shake wasn't advertised on the regular or limited edition menu, but it's available.  The shake was great! I'll come back for more flavors. The burger was good but nothing special and the fries compliment the burger. The staff were working so hard to get the food out and turn over the tables, etc. it's busy now because it's new and the only one in the city. I am sure the excitement will die down and long lines will not be forever. It's a good place to get a burger and there are stores you can walk up nearby so location is prime. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Better than In-N-Out.

The burgers here are very good. The best in its class. The quality of the patty is equivalent to the patties used by some restaurants which sell $15+ burgers, and they have the taste to back it up.

The only downside is the size. The burgers are pretty small. If you're an average-sized guy, one wouldn't fill you up. I guess the good thing about that is it leaves room for some shake and fries. However, I would still pick shake shack over In-N-Out any day of the week. This is coming from someone who lives in California, the home of In-N-Out."}
{"text":"I love coming here when I'm on the strip with some friends! This burger joint is always compared to in&out, but I think they are both good in their different ways! The burgers are really good here, especially their shack sauce! BUT their shakes are a must, they are great! Especially their black&white one (Cookies&cream)! Only con is since it's on the strip it does get pretty busy and crowded, but they are good at keeping it quick and getting your food asap. All my friends I've brought enjoyed it, so I say check it out!"}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner with a friend and picked this place. Knew nothing about it other than the menu and location. Got the Smoke Burger, fries, and the Summerlin Concrete. Burger was small, but good. Fries were good. Concrete was ok, we've had better. For the price it was disappointing. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Best part was the cherry red peppers and pickled jalapeños. You will get a better burger at In-N-Out"}
{"text":"As a native Californian I was always an In and Out burger person. Since moving to AZ I have loved this place!!

Decor- Very relaxed atmosphere for being a mall food stop. 5 big screen tv's to watch and relax at. 

Service- During lunch they get slammed!  Be prepared to wait awhile. The workers usually are gossiping, but will talk to you if needed.

Food- I love their chicken sandwich. By far my favorite of everything. They also do specials and they never ever disappoint. Fries are crinkle cut, it brings me back to the good old days. The shakes are expensive and small, but they pack lots of flavor!

Overall- Though it is expensive and you could find cheaper options,  I love this place. I will always come back for the chicken!!"}
{"text":"A cool place to check out.  Very friendly and quick service.  Food is good but not sure if I would put in top 5 burger spots.  If you are near this end of the Strip, Shake Shack is something different."}
{"text":"BOMB. First I've had shake shack and it might just have been the best burger ever! Crowded then again its on the strip but you get your food pretty fast. They got an assembly line thing going. Glad I had it atleast once."}
{"text":"So I had Shake Shack for the first time in Vegas and it was OK.  Then it made it to Charlotte and we went for the first time and the line was still out the door, however, the line moved fast and great customer service.  I would agree that the burgers are a bit pricey and I'm not a fan of their shakes (but that's because I prefer real ice cream and not custard).  I saw a review about their veggie burgers and I'd be open to trying one upon my next return.  Lastly, I wouldn't rush to return, but it was a good night out as we sat outside and enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"If you'd like to waste a ton of time waiting for a mediocre burger and fries (to go) then please come here! If you don't want to wait the 15-20 min for a to go order for one, then I recommend Five Guys! Better taste, cheaper, and not slow as heck!"}
{"text":"My fiancè and I came here when we did a weekend in Vegas.

As a Cali girl, I'm biased and prefer In N Out but since it was late, this place was open- we just decided on a whim to come here. The food was okay, overpriced, but it was the rude worker we conversed with that made me want to leave a review.

Reynna was our cashier and she was very monotone, unhelpful and was rushing us to make our order even though there wasn't a line or anyone waiting, which didn't make sense. Her eyes looked so dull that it seemed like she didn't get any sleep or something, but that's not what I'm leaving a review for. 

After we ordered our food, we asked her if we can get 2 cups of water, but instead of stating nicely and pointing out where they were, she had this attitude and said they're next to the napkins, condiments or pick up counter (I don't even remember) but we're not even from here so obviously we didn't know where that was either. But whatever. Mediocre, overpriced food and rude service from Reynna."}
{"text":"Very happy they opened one in Vegas (even though I don't live here). I've tried Shake Shack in NY and thought it was amazing there, and I can say the same for the Vegas location. Our wait in line was about 30 minutes, which isn't THAT bad. I ordered the Shack Attack concrete and a single Shack Burger. I skipped the fries since I was splurging on the calories with the concrete- and I don't really enjoy crinkle cut fries.. I don't know it just reminds of failed attempts at home of Ole-Ida fries. 
Anyways, their burger patty pretty much melts in your mouth once you bite into it. The bun is soft and puffy& their sauce just goes so well with the meat & bun. Well it must have been extra good too bc I was hungover and nothing but vodka and potato chips all weekend."}
{"text":"Shake Shack did NOT disappoint! I am so glad we went there. We had heard some cautionary tales and being a former California girl, I didn't want to cheat on my beloved In-N-Out that was down the road. I think it was a fabulous idea to put Shake Shack in the NYNY Hotel. We had a great meal in NYC and it was replicated here in LV.

+shakes!
+burgers!

Albeit the price is a little high, but it's no more than a Red Robin, which sucks. I can't wait to come back here again!

Come early and avoid the lines!"}
{"text":"Their chicken sandwiches are fantastic! I had both the spicy and the regular this week. Both were every bit as good as Chick-fil-A and without the guilt of supporting racism and intolerance. 

My wife had the Black and White shake. It's a chocolate and marshmallow sort of thing that's surprisingly good. IMO, get a spicy chicken sandwich and a small shake.

Only negative is that it can get pretty busy. The staff is on the ball though and even the long lines move pretty quickly."}
{"text":"i didn't have fries, but i did have a smoke shack and a malt. and it was ridiculously good. better than in-n-out anyday. i'm a little verklempt"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of hype about this place while living in California and decided to give it a try since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It definitely did not live up to my expectations.

I ordered the following:

Cheese fries 3/5: I may be biased since I do love fries a lot and the cheese on it made it pretty good. It was nothing special, but just simply cheese on fries. Simplicity at its finest, I guess.

SmokeShack 2/5: I was so disappointed in the volume and quality of the burger! I really thought there would be more to it, but it was quite plain and the bacon didn't add much to it. I honestly prefer In-N-Out over this.

It was worth a try, but I probably won't come back. In-N-Out isn't far, hah."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Shake Shack & I have had nothing but good experiences at the other locations in Vegas ( Summerlin & The Strip ) this brand-new location however boggles my mind because twice that I have visited, They have messed up my Shack burger orders on such epic levels. 

Tonight I actually had to get a refund & left hungry because I was so disappointed in the quality & service I got. Seriously is Shake Shack hiring homeless people off the street who can't put together a pricey burger correctly to save their souls?  

My burger looked like a soggy shriveled up mess with no lettuce or tomato ( they forgot to put that on ) and when I went up to let them know they just threw me a side of lettuce and tomato instead of remaking my burger in a very unfriendly manner. 

That's when I decided enough is enough & asked for my money back. 

The first time they got my order completely wrong for both shack burgers. They were kind enough to rectify the situation & make me new burgers to my satisfaction. 2nd time tonight was not the charm, they were not so kind & the customer service was horrible. 

Here's the deal if you're gonna pay these type of prices for a fast food type of burger, they better deliver on the quality of the product. My shack burger looked worse then a 99 cent burger from Jack in the Box. 

This location needs a freshen up course on how to treat their paying customers with more care."}
{"text":"Nothing like a quick fix at Shake Shack to cure your late night munchies. Great location outside of New York New York with a open spacious location. I've personally have had enough In N Out to last me a lifetime so Shake Shack is a welcoming change!

There is comfort to this food that brings me back to my good times of childhood. The crispy crinkly fries, ultra thick Strawberry shake & the flavor explosion of their double shack burger just kicks my happy endorphins up to the tee.

Is it healthy clean eating? Heck no but it makes cheat day so worth looking forward to! 

Shake Shack is YUMMMMMMMMMY SUPREME!!!"}
{"text":"It's really greasy and over priced! Not worth it! I will not go back! We had two burgers and fries and it was 30 I don't mind dishing out the money if the food is good. This was a big let down not even the shake was good!"}
{"text":"YAYYYYY! There's a SHAKE SHACK CLOSER TO ME! Located on the strip at the New York New York hotel (how appropriate! b/c that's where Shake Shack started!)

Man, that shack sauce is amazing! Garlicky & creamy... it goes perfectly with the angus beef and soft and slightly sweet bun. 

1 single cheeseburger, 1 order of crinkle cut fries and 1 fountain drink will set you back about $10. Pricey for fast food burgers, but worth the price b/c of the quality of ingredients they use. You can taste the delicious beefy goodness.

My only gripe about this location they should work out a better system with cranking out their burgers. We waited about 15 minutes for our food and when we got it, the burgers were luke warm. Probably been sitting out for a while and no one buzzed us. Boo."}
{"text":"I love shake shack!  

Gotta say I love the stack shack!  The flavor, the cheesy portobello mushroom....

However, this time going back I was a bit disappointed.....

Got the shroom burger...  It was super tiny! (Slider size) for $6.99... I totally thought it was much bigger... it was tasty but it wasn't worth the money... 

Cheese fries...  $3.95 or so... small portion as well but the cheese sauce on fries was delicious... but man... so little cheese too....  

Concrete:  Got the all in one chocolate concrete... it was not too sweet and yummy... but gotta take out the cookie dough and the toffee next time... way too sweet with those in it...

Final verdict... I would go back but probably won't purposely plan a visit there... (Like I did this time around)  The size of the burgers are simply not worth it... it was much bigger when they first opened but now it has shrunk in size... hope they will take into consideration and make their burgers slightly bigger....  Otherwise, they will not be a competition to in-n-out..."}
{"text":"Really like the burgers here. Much better than 5 guys on par with in n out. Quality meat and bun for sure however the meat is thicker than average burger so be prepared to deal with the feeling of having eaten too much grease. 


Fries were very good and crispy although I still prefer McDs or in n out fries. Also tried the shackago hot dog which was very good. Unique tasting hot dog and something I would definitely try again. 

Overall highly recommend this burger and considering that the price is reasonable I think in n out burger finally has a legit competitor (outside mom n pop burger joints)"}
{"text":"Have always heard about this place, so we definitely wanted to try it out. 

It is suppose to be the \"In N Out\" of the East Coast.

Long line when we arrived, but it went quickly. Food was amazing, and kinda sad to say that it was better than In N Out (AND WE LOVE IN N OUT). Prices were good. Had the shack stack which was a cheeseburger, with a stuffed portabello mushroom inside, OMG. Amazing. 

Had a the chocolate shake with Oreo crumbles also, not bad, but a little too rich for me.. 

Will definitely return, hoping that they'll open somewhere closer to home"}
{"text":"Ok this is  my second time here. The first time I got a smoke shack with caramelized onions and it tasted so so good.  It melted in your mouth. This was back in July 2015. So I was really excited when I had the opportunity to come back.  I ordered the same thing but they ended up giving me a roadhouse shack which was a cheeseburger with caramelized onions and bits of bacon, so not the same thing.  I only noticed the mistake after I'd eaten 1/2 that it didn't have strips of Applewood bacon.  I went over to tell the girl at the counter and I told her I didn't expect a new burger since I already ate 1/2 but I wanted her to know that I ordered the smoke shack and was given the roadhouse instead.  I even showed her the receipt.  She told me no worries and gave me the right one and said I could take the old one.  I was surprised!  I mean what great customer service.  There wasn't a long line and the food came out fairly quickly. The staff is friendly and the burgers super yummy.  I recommend the smoke shack with caramelized onions plus cheddar fries. Their shakes are really good too.  I've been to the one in NY by Time Square but I like this one better. If you get a chance I recommend you try this place.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A must-try in Vegas when you're in dire need of drunchies or just craving something greasy. 

Burgers are filling as it is, but if you add loaded fries into the mix? Hello, food coma. Burger isn't dry and cheese fries are better than the extra loaded fries that come with bacon but that's just my personal opinion. They have a few shakes to choose from--if you like peanut butter the peanut brittle is the one. 

Fast service, order and find seats while you wait with a buzzer. Oh, and make sure you hit the gym after."}
{"text":"Yay! Shake Shack has finally arrived in the West Coast. I love the Shake Stack, which is a combo of their patty and portobello mushroom. I also like the consistency and texture of their French fries. I was also excited to see that they carried gluten free bread! Yes!! I didn't get to try the bread because I ordered a lettuce wrapped shake stack. Yes, they do lettuce wrapped burgers, too! 

If you're eating dairy, you can get their cheeseburger and cheesy fries! Cheese makes everything taste better. Though, I withheld myself and went for regular fries. 

I also ordered an ice tea, which was unsweetened. I found it very refreshing especially on a hot summery day in Vegas. 

Everything was great! The line moved quickly, the service was speedy, and the restaurant is clean. The ambiance is casual, and they've got real plants around the place. I also saw the Manager walking around asking folks how their dining experience was going. This shows me that they care about their customers. This place is, by far, superior to White Castle. However, as a SoCal kid, I have to say I prefer In n Out's burger patty and animal style fries."}
{"text":"I'm  from California so I will always be a die hard in n out burger fangirl for life. Buuuuttt I will say that this place was worth the hype. Came in on an impromptu vegas trip and heard some mumblings about this place from a few people I encountered on the strip. I went with the portobello mushroom AND patty burger. What can I say?  A girl likes a tasty burger.  The French fries for some reason reminded me way too much of the fries they served back in grade school cafeterias. The desert though.... bomb.com (grade school brought me back to the 90s). Go, even just to try it. It's an East Coast thing. .....still can't beat the Best Coast burger/price though!"}
{"text":"The burgers were to die for! I got the shroom burger and it was so good! I've never had a fried mushroom in my burger. I did add one meat patty to it which was actually one of the choices on the menu but I forgot what it was called. The flavors in the burger was orgasmic! I usually don't finish all of my food and yes I did finish this one. We also got the cheese fries which I probably didn't really care for but its a good compliment to the burger. 
The atmosphere was great! You pick your own seat after ordering. There's a patio too! Which I love! T.V.s everywhere -props btw because my bf needs to watch his basketball.
I definitely will be coming back... Maybe after a couple of weeks because it just opened. The line was long!"}
{"text":"My friends and I go here sometimes when we are at Vegas. This is a good place to try at least once in your life. A lot of people are comparing this burger joint to In-n-Out. In my honest opinion, I would go to In-n-Out. However, if you haven't tried this place out, I would suggest you do so. You'll get a different taste, especially if you order the Shake Stack Burger they have on their menu. If you're going to try this place, go all out to see the difference. I don't recommend ordering the plain burger, it's not as flavorful, but though it is cheaper...so weigh your options.

Plan your stay....Line is long depending on the time you come here. Sometimes it goes all the way out of the door and down the stairs. 

Seating is a bit hard to find if there's a lot of people. I suggest having your friends find it while you order. There's inside and outside seating. If you find any free seats, I recommend you just take it for now until you find some place else for you and your friends.

I ordered the Shake Stack Burger and Shack Burger (single). Shake Stack Burger was flavorful and is a big burger. It is filling. The angus meat is juicy with the smoked flavor. It's a bit pricey, but it's worth getting. The Shack Burger, I felt, tasted just like a regular burger with the meat being a little bit more flavored, but not much. 

Fries were ok. They sell the crinkled fries. I, also had the Cheese Fries before too, it was way too cheesy for me. I don't really liked that taste. I personally think In-n-Out fries with their spread is absolutely delicious!! So I guess nothing can compare. LOL.

I still think In-n-Out is better because of their low prices and quality of food is comparable to this place."}
{"text":"The craving came on for ice cream and I have been to this establishment and thought since shakes were advertised on the outside then would be great. The cashier was so friendly and down to earth it felt like as though my ordering was with an old friend. They take old diner style of atmosphere and have modernized it with wood paneling in all of the booths of the restaurant. The tele's all around are a must with all different sporting events at different angles all over the restaurant. If a guest wants a certain sports event the staff will change it, like last night when the Knights hockey game was playing.

Our shakes were very good, I cannot believe that I have waited this long to try them. I had the twins with me so the two flavors we had were chocolate and twist. The twist is a mix of vanilla and chocolate which could of been more impressive with added extra chocolate, but that was it. The chocolate was very rich and creamy. I was snack type hungry so opted for something light and it was a couple orders of their fries. They were so golden looking that they would of been good enough looking for royalist. The true test of a good fry and shake is if they fast good together and they exceeded this test."}
{"text":"So disappointed! Been wanting to go since it opened. Burgers are small and unappetizing, and for a place called shake shack the shake was terrible. Not going back."}
{"text":"I hate that I love Shake Shack so much.  That burger bun!  How do they do it?  It makes all the difference in the world, and yet I live virtually a world away from here.  While I love their burgers, even the secret menu one with bacon and peanut sauce, my absolute favorite is the shroom burger.  OMG, that cheese pouring out when you bite into that giant breaded portabello mushroom is heaven!  The fries are choice and their concrets are great to finish your decadent meal.  

Then I feel guilty because I'm an In-N-Out fan at home.  But wait, Shake Shack is expanding to the SF Bay Area?!?  Oh it's on!  

Fast food burger wars in SF are about to get interesting!  Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"If you peeped my Bruxie Las Vegas review already, great. 'Cause Shake Shack is right next door, giving you a nice option if you're not feeling chicken and waffles, (you're crazy if you're not feeling chicken and waffles lol). Shake Shack is basically the sans-California version of In 'n Out with a more diverse menu. They have hot dogs and chicken sandwiches as well. I went to this location with the wife and my brother and his friend. The line wasn't too long and moved quickly. I ordered the bacon cheese fries and a salted caramel shake. Shake was BOMB. My wife got her burger lettuce-wrapped and loved it. Prices weren't half bad, either."}
{"text":"I wasn't too crazy about their burgers. In N Out and Five Guys burgers are so much better! However, I do love the Chick N Shack with fries! It is a very delicious chicken burger. (When I think of it, it makes my mouth water). 

This location is the only one I've been to. They have great customer service. However, I've been there twice and there is always something a bit off with my order. Of course they remedy whatever is wrong happily. So I can't really complain. 

This is a good location to go to because it is not as busy as other locations I've tried to go to."}
{"text":"We've stopped in here several times. A few of which we made a special trip to DT Summerlin just for Shake Shack. The menu is simple and easy to navigate. The staff is always friendly. The burgers are obviously delicious. But they really nail that chicken sandwich as well. The cheese fries are so good. Not too rich. One thing that bothers me there is that they always give a new cup for soda refills even though they preach a lot about their sustainable practices."}
{"text":"Located on the Las Vegas strip at the New York New York. This is one location on the west of the Mississippi.

We visited not long ago to try to see what the celebrity chefs like in hamburgers. Staff was friendly, quick to take our order and get food out. We ordered a classic burger to share, the famous fries, and shake flavor of the week.

Order came out in reasonable time. The burger was hot. Produce lettuce tomato and onions were crisp. Bun was topped with sesame seeds and warm. Beef was seasoned. Their specify french fries, essential crinkle cut, were boiling hot and seasoned appropriate without need of additional salt or ketchup. 

The milkshake of the week was the pumpkin pie flavor. The milkshake was a good balance of ice cream and pumpkin pie taste. Reminded me of eating pumpkin pie with whipped cream. Tasty. Not ice and not overly creamy. Would definitely order again.

Overall burger was ok. Fries were ok. Milkshake was the best aspect."}
{"text":"This is probably the best burger among the \"gourmet\" burger chain restaurants u have ever tried. Definitely beats in n' out! I little more pricey tho..."}
{"text":"There's a lot of hype around Shake Shack right now, and I have to say....it's pretty cool.

First, I always like trying out 'famous' places, and seeing as how this is a famous burger place from NY, that was originally drawing hours-long lines, I definitely wanted to try it.

Second, the shop is cool. It's more modern than a typical fast food burger, and it has a good amount of outdoor seating. The patio part is strip-side, so you can check out the goings on on LV blvd, but it's still kinda private, tucked away behind some bushes.

Third, they have a good selection of beer, including one from Brooklyn Brewery made specifically for Shake Shack (even though I didn't particularly love that one).

Last, but not least, the burgers, hot dogs, and fries are all good. They are a little higher priced because they're famous and this is the Las Vegas Strip, but it's not extravagant. 

If you're in the area visiting anything at NYNY or across the street (Coke World!), I'd definitely recommend walking over to Shake Shack. And feel free to bring a big group!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!!! Fast Food for Rich People!!!

The quality of the food here is pretty good. There are still throngs of corporate guys and gals everywhere to make sure that happens. Looks like a pretty happy solid crew in this epic and very busy fast food joint.

I thought the portions were a little small, especially for the prices. Burgers run between $5.50 - $9.50 and are pretty small, fries are 4 bucks, again small, and a 5 dollar hot dog looks great. We hit the magic $20.00 per person check average with some drinks, burgers, fries and a shared CamleShack. Heck lot's of people are paying it so if they can get it?!?!. I paid my bill with a little sticker shock, and probably wont rush back based on prices alone.

$hake $hack is a great addition  to The New Camleview Theater$ just steps away, and the new standard for $14 and up movie tickets!$!$! 

Its a big place and huge investment, so I am curious what will happen when the newness wears off both places."}
{"text":"Cool concept, but its not cheap, It's also not fast food.

My buger dog and fries all were tasty, and I now get what all the fuss is about.

Well cooked bugers decently dressed and the split dogs are fantastic. I do like the buns and realize why they are remarkable

Ok ok am a fan!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this burger! I got the smokestack, cheese fries and the jackpot! It was all really delicious and came out quick! I like how you order and get a little buzzer. The tables were super cool wood from Brooklyn. We did have to walk through the casino to get to the restaurant. It was towards the front. Definitely a place I will visit again soon! Yumm!"}
{"text":"Always superb quality, always quick with my order, not a single unhappy employee, this is one of my favorite places to eat. I have to mention Steven as well, I've never had customer service like that at even some of the most famous and expensive restaurants in town. I've had worse customer service buying a car than I did just getting a burger at 9 at night. Promote him and give him a raise, he should be managing the place."}
{"text":"Still the same great taste, unfortunately the customer service is lacking compared to the summerlin location."}
{"text":"FINALLY got to try Shake Shack & it had its pros and cons. 

The line at this location was pretty long, 15-20 minutes, and I noticed the cash register people are pretty chatty, so that explains it. We got 1 Shackburger ($5.29), bf got a Double Shackburger ($8.09) we split a fries (one size - $2.99), a small soda ($2.30), & fifty/fifty (Arnold palmer essentially - $2.55). All of that $22.91, not bad for lunch for 2 people. 

I think for the size of everything though it was pretty pricey, adding one burger patty to make it a double for an extra almost $3, meh. The burger itself was very good, but small, I could have eaten another one.

The bf and I both said we probably would never crave it, and if you wanted more bang for your buck you would go to In-And-Out or something similar."}
{"text":"First time here. Their SHACKburger was decent but not gloat worthy in all honesty. I'd come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Great location!    The food came out fast and it was hot however they got both mine and my friends burger wrong.    Funny thing is we both got  1/2 through our burgers before we realized that they were not made right!    We sat outside at the high table and people watched.    The nice thing is that there was no long line like in New York!   I will try them again the next time we are in Las Vegas at New York New York!!"}
{"text":"Love me some shake shack! If you love hamburgers, good food, plus they got some good craft beer!!  It's is definitely worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the food but -1 star for the prices. They say Shake Shack is the \"In n Out\" of the East Coast so I had to see what the hype was about this past weekend in Vegas.  Shake Shack is located next to New York New York on the Las Vegas strip.  I kind of think the location is not too favourable considering it's towards the end of the strip where nobody really stays or goes to.  

But anyways, the food. 
They offer a couple different burgers but they're all definitely on the pricier side.  We ordered the ShackBurger and the ShackStack. The ShackBurger was a regular cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatos and Shacksauce at $6 for a single.  It was okay.. nothing too special about it.  However, the ShackStack was a whole nother story!  Basically it was a cheeseburger version of the \"shroom burger\" with lettuce, tomatos and Shacksauce.  The crisp fried portobello mushroom was stuffed with ooey gooey melted cheese....  Hands down, amaaaaazing.  I seriously inhaled this burger and forgot I was supposed to split half/half with my boyfriend..oops :) Definitely lives up to the hype & I would highly recommend this burger! 

The only thing I didn't really like was how fries & drinks were not included in the prices and that you had to order them seperately.  I mean, the Shackburger was already $6 while the ShackStack was $10 but I guess you can't really complain when in Vegas.  Would I come back? Yes, but only for that ShackStack burger."}
{"text":"Ummmm. I don't know what to say really. The burger was good. It was really good. But east versus west coast. My loyalty stays with in-n-out. 

But back to this place. Was super excited to check it out. I'm well aware of the hype and tried to make it here for a couple trips to Vegas. I walked over from cosmopolitan.  It was about a 15 min walk cutting thru some other hotels. The street may have been quicker, it was cold outside. I opted for secondhand cigarette smoke. I was thrown off by their burger logo outside.  The signage is all green. Then you walk in and see the signage inside features the green burger.  I waited in the quickly moving line but with anxiety. When it was my turn to order I had to ask, \"are the burgers green?\"  I got a look back like I was being a smart-ass, but it was a legit concern in my mind. 

Back to the review. I ordered a cheeseburger , fries and a soda.  There were other options, but that's what I was feeling.  The wait was standard, 5 min'ish. The fries are crinkled fries. Reminded me of the frozen type mom would buy from grocery store.  Not a big deal to me as I'm not a big fry-guy any ways. The burger was really good. Had little tomatoes on them and some type of secret sauce.  It reminded me (taste and texture) of a Wendy's burger, but several notches higher in quality.  

It was a really good burger.  In and out is better, but this place is a lot quicker than any in-and-out."}
{"text":"I had this review on draft for quite some time,
Since I'm late on this review, I'll make it a rhyme.  

We met some friends on a busy Saturday night,
I got the Quad, some fries, but something wasn't right.

SS is located right next to New York New York.
Of course I took pictures of my meal and fork.

The Quad was good, the fries were fresh,
So, why isn't Shake Shack the best? 

I'll start with the good because I don't want to be mean,
The service was great, the restaurant was clean.  

Refills on your drinks and not on the fries,
They hooked it up anyway, which was a pleasant surprise. 

I had a great time with friends and had some fun,
After only one visit at Shake Shack, I think I'm done.

Now for the bad and don't you get mad,
I got the bill and felt I was just had. 

Curious about the hype and wanted to be hip,
I was so disappointed because our meal was a grip. 

A regular burger is small and I hate to pout,
You definitely get a lot more at IN-N-Out

I can't believe I spent forty dollars on fast food for two,
You all have been warned if you read this review

Peace!!!"}
{"text":"Great Sliders!!!

A lot of people like to compare Shake Shack to In-N-Out.  They are not the same thing.  Plus, it wouldn't be fair to Shake Shack to compare them to an In-N-Out.  Overall, I don't think Shake Shack's baby burgers are bad at all.  I have a lot more pros than cons.  

Pros:
-Conveniently located in Downtown Summerlin
-Parking is great.  You have the whole mall to find parking. 
-The weather is nice in Summerlin. 
-Located close to Red Rock
-Their burgers are so cute and tiny.  
-Shake Shack's Double Shack is one of the better sliders I've had in a long time. 
-Lower in calorie because you don't get much
-Their burgers won't ruin dinner.  You'll be ready to eat again about 30 minutes. 
-Takes about 2 minutes to finish a burger here.  This means people are in and out.  A lot of seating. 
-Love the crinkle fries
-Two burgers, fries, and a drinks is less than $100.  More like $40.  

Cons:
-You have to wait for your meal in order to get your drinks. 
-Takes a while for this \"fast food\" joint to cook your food. 
-Their Double Shack, at over $8, is a really expensive slider."}
{"text":"Overpriced for small burgers with no flavor. And Kroger style fries are not worth the 70 dollars I spent for 4 people. The shakes are literally milky no thickness at all. Good for the tourist but a local There are way better and cheaper places to eat."}
{"text":"Great as far a SHAKE SHACK goes and a strong representation of the brand right here in Vegas"}
{"text":"Always a good casual option that's fairly priced. The only downside is that the line to order can be fairly long, but they are generally pretty quick to bring the food out."}
{"text":"Came to Shake Shack starving late at night. There was practically no line and the food came out pretty fast. Ordered the chicken burger which a bit on the fried/greasy side- not the best but the double down fries with the bacon, cheese, and some kind of pickled vegetable made up for it :)"}
{"text":"YUM, YUM, YUM!! I wanted to try this restaurant while in NYC and didn't have the opportunity. I was so glad to see this one at New York, New York Casino. I tried the bacon cheeseburger, cheese fries, hot dog, and strawberry shake. All exceeded my expectations! The cheese fries are an absolute must!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger places! I wish there was one in my home state. Cheeseburgers and cheese fries, please!"}
{"text":"The food was outstanding.. i'm now a fan... however there are some glaring design problems with this location.
They way they are shoehorned into this area they are going to be VERY difficult if not impossible to fix.
First of all..
What idiot picked that spot / Location??
The Dining room is small and gets constantly overloaded, and they try to use the amazingly under spaced small patio to offload the crowds.
there is not even enough room there.
Because there is not enough room in the restaurant, the line is always running out the OPEN door.
What are you going to do with the restaurant crowds when you can't use the outside (can you say CLEVELAND WINTER).
As it is now you cannot enjoy a leisurely eaten dinner because you feel like they want you to eat and get so the next person can sit.

But wait...
Secondly you have unlimited refill drinks with single stall one-person-at-a-time bathrooms. and the lines to that are running down into the already overcrowded seating area.
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING??

This was just NOT thought out, You can do better than this."}
{"text":"A visit to Las Vegas normally means a stop at Shake Shack just outside of New York New York (since they now have a few locations in Las Vegas). My trip in January 2018 was no exception.

In the evening, my colleague who had picked/suggested Twin Peaks to eat at the previous day asked if I wanted to have dinner together again. Even though I wasn't really hungry due to me having had a large buffet brunch earlier that day, I was thinking of dropping by Shake Shack so I told him that we could meet there. He had never eaten there before so I told him that it was great burgers (albeit somewhat expensive), good fries, and great shakes.

He asked me what I recommended and I told him that I normally order the Shack Stack which is a meat patty along with a mushroom patty in a burger and I also get an order of fries and a peanut butter shake. Even though I gave him my recommendations, he opted to go for his own thing (regular hamburger, vanilla milk shake, and fries). He mentioned that he couldn't believe that I recommended and spent over $10 (not including taxes) on just a burger. I told him that it was a very good burger.

For my order this trip, I decided to get the Shack Stack, fries, and instead of getting a peanut butter shake this time, I went with a float. Out of the float flavours, I decided to go with a creamsicle float. If you like orange creamsicles, I really recommend the creamsicle float.

After ordering and paying, they hand you a \"pager\" which you hold onto until it vibrates. Once it vibrates, you go up to the counter to pick up your items. The wait wasn't too longer and was a typical wait at any fast food restaurant.

As always, the Shack Stack burger was very good. The crinkle fries were good. The creamsicle float was very good and will probably be my drink of choice from now on when I visit Shake Shack.

Total price tag (including taxes) was $20.54"}
{"text":"easy to find if your outside the new york new york hotel & casino. The burgers are not like California burgers. It seems like i can cook it over the stove myself. I also tried the vienna hot dog. EHHHHHHH...i can also cook it myself over the stove. So what i can say, skip the hype & go to in and out. Im still in love with west coast burgers...."}
{"text":"Great buildout. 

Hamburger was good but too small. Needs to be larger. FF were awesome."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to hit up Shake Shack ever since I bought my man a copy of Pat LaFrieda's book, Meat, as a Christmas gift a few years back.  [For those who aren't super geeky about these things, Pat LaFrieda is the master butcher responsible for the meat blend used in Shake Shack's burgers.]  
Unfortunately, the chain has yet to make it to Utah, and every time I've seen one while traveling, I haven't been able to make it work with my schedule.  So, on a recent trip to Scottsdale, I was very pleased to see that there was a location (Kierland) in the shopping area right below the office I was visiting.
Now, I've heard people draw comparisons between In-N-Out, Five Guys and Shake Shack. [Check out a fairly in-depth dig by none other than Mr. Kenji Lopez-Alt of Serious Eats http://aht.seriouseats.com/2011/05/in-n-out-vs-five-guys-vs-shake-shack-the-first-bi-coastal-side-by-side-taste-test.html BUT, just for full disclosure-- this article is a bit dated and doesn't represent the current size of the growing SS empire, nor does it cover some pretty major menu updates.  That said, *SPOILER ALERT,* SS takes the win, and if the article were updated with the new additions to the menu, SS would have completely crushed the competition.]  
As for my own take on the three-- I'm always down for an In-N-Out burger (their fries just plain suck, sorry-not-sorry) and you can't beat their prices.  And Five guys?  Well, I've only tried them a few times, and each time I did, I just felt like the food was sort of... \"meh\" and definitely didn't warrant the hefty price tag.  So, now that I can officially comment on the Shake Shack piece of the puzzle-- SS wins.  Hands down.  No contest.  Like... I'm actually feeling a little relieved that there isn't one too close by, because I'd be tempted to eat there daily.
The ShackStack was BOMB--the chopped cherry peppers killed me.  My man got a ShackBurger just to... get a standard baseline.  He totally loved it (and went back without me after I left town... brat).  We had to try some crinkle-cut fries (loved), and I treated myself to a nice, cold, very tasty beer (\"Shackmeister Ale,\" custom-brewed for SS by Brooklyn Brewery, and on tap, no less).  They even have a house red & white, created just for them by a very reputable winery (Frog's Leap) in Napa!  What the...?!  If I hadn't been so full, I would have loved to try a shake or concrete, all of which sounded lovely.
Look, is it the cheapest burger in town?  Nope.  But, unlike the aforementioned & overpriced Five Guys, it's actually worth it.  For this category of restaurant (what would you call it... high-end fast-food, maybe?  I keep seeing it referred to as a \"roadside burger\" style, which works, I guess) it's totally spot-on.  You can't beat the quality, the selection or the execution.  And... BONUS-- they have booze!  It was all on point.  This particular location also has a stellar patio and was extremely clean as well.  
I see some people complaining, but to me it seems akin to people who go to a new pizza place and expect a Chicago-style deep-dish \"pizza\" and are subsequently horrified to see a Neapolitan-style pie land in front of them.  It's not their fault, they just didn't know that they were ordering a real pizza (sorry, Chicago #notpizza ).   
I'm not trying to diminish anyone's opinion or experience, I'm just saying that, in my humble opinion, this place is the pinnacle of burger-joint perfection, and I will now be making more of a point of seeking them out wherever I roam."}
{"text":"Had the double cheeseburger and it was phenomenal.  Fries were ok - it sort of reminded me of Ore-Ida fries that come from the freezer, but it was just ok.  The shakes were pretty good too.  Pricing of the burgers were decently priced.  I think the fries were expensive for what it was.  The way it works is that you order from the counter.  You're given a notifier for your order.  Once it's ready, you pick up your food at the counter.  Dining area was clean.  There are LCD TVs throughout airing sports.  All in all, great burger.  I'll be back.

Given the location, you would figure they would be open late.  On the weekends, they're open until 2am.  Sunday through Thursday, they close at midnight.  You're on the Strip!!!  We just came out of a Cirque show around 1100pm.  By the time, we got out of Mandalay Bay, it was about 11:45pm and was sad to find out Shake Shack closed at Midnight.  Bummer.  But I made it at opening time before our flight back home.

TIP:  Hook up to NYNY's WiFi for free"}
{"text":"Sorry burger connoisseurs out there.  This place is overrated.  I had to fly from Honolulu, to LAX to LV to try this place out and I felt like going to In-N-Out right after.

First off, I like to buy people lunch and 4 of us cost $75 (compared to me taking 10 people to InzNOutz cost $60)  I don't care much about how much a place cost but Shake Shake is way overrated in both taste and cost.  If you charge $10 bucks for a burger, I had better do cartwheels after I am done...

I had the Shack Stack - I guess it's a burger with a fried shroom and cheese.  Maybe the cook had an off day becoz the taste was just not good.  The oil may have been old...

The fries are a joke.  I gotz the Ore Ida ones with cheese and they weren't anything special.  My high school in the hoods fries were even better.

I had a chocolate - strawberry shake - sorry, LAME!  Taste like a chocolate milk, but a tad thicker.   I can make a better on in Ninja blender at home.  Plus they forgot my shake on my order...

On top of the not so good experience from this Burger Piggy, the workers there are nice but clueless.  They run around trying to complete every order correctly but there was a lot of customers coming back with missing items.  C'mon SS workers, the ordering is electronic - ain't that difficult!  I ordered 4 shakes and you gave me 3..."}
{"text":"Good burgers and shakes. A little pricey for the amount of food you get. Not sure why people are comparing it to In N Out. For the price of a Shake Shack burger you can buy an entire combo meal with shake at In N Out. With that said I still prefer In N Out."}
{"text":"Man, I've never tried shake shack before but I keep on hearing about it from people who visit NY. People tend to call it the in n out of the east coast and I just had to give it a go.

Located right outside of NYNY is this hip restaurant with ample indoor and outdoor seating. Around lunch time, it gets pretty crowded but the lines move pretty quickly. They have a decent selection of alcohol, burgers, shakes, and fries. We ended up getting:

Shack Stack- $9- Basically it combines the beef patty burger with the portobello patty which oozes with cheese inside of it. This was amazing, even though the burger looked small, the flavors blended so well in your mouth. Just delightful.

Cheese fries- $5- How did they get the fries to be so crunchy? It was an aromatic mash of cheese and potatoes. It was like a cheesy potato fiesta in my mouth.

The meal came out to $30 for the both of us so it's a little bit pricier than I hoped. However, it was worth it because that blend of beef and mushroom is just amazing. I was worried to try this place because I had a nasty experience at white castle but this place is 10 times better."}
{"text":"This new-ish location of the hipster burger chain at The District is never busy, which simultaneously delights and concerns me. Don't worry about facing the legendary long lines at this Shake Shack -- there aren't any. That's a good thing for those of us wanting our burger fix but also potentially bad news that the business may be struggling at this location. I hope that's not the case, and I encourage you to head out here today to keep 'em going!

This location is far, FAR better than the one in Downtown Summerlin. I don't know why, but the cooks are better and the food tastes a lot better. This is our go-to stop before a movie at Regal GVR because the kitchen is fast and the food is delicious. 

The menu is simple and inexpensive considering the high quality. Burgers, hot dogs and chicken are what they do best here, and low carb diners can rejoice: they'll wrap any sandwich in lettuce. The original is the way to start, but they do offer specialty burgers too (if it's chili season, get that -- it's so good and made with shredded beef instead of ground beef with a very spicy kick). The desserts are great as well, they are ice cream treats a lot like Blizzards from Dairy Queen. Folks looking for wine and beer will be happy too because they serve both.

The dining space is large and modern, with plenty of seating. Condiments are self-serve but the soda fountain isn't, meaning you have to wait for someone to refill your drink. I really hate this, especially because 1. the cups are TINY and 2. the employees usually throw out your cup and give you a new one every time they do a refill! That's so wasteful and not environmentally friendly. I'm docking a star for that fact alone (although I should dock more). 

Plenty of free parking in the giant office building parking lot across the way (especially at night)."}
{"text":"The food is your standard chain stuff. Nothing spectacular. Although the burger didn't have that \"greasy\" nature one may be used to at other places. Again just tried it since it's not one I had before. Would I go back? Probably not. Just not really anything memorable."}
{"text":"STILL love the burger and still wish fries were hotter but this time I was with a crew so we could try some other items.  The chocolate frozen custard was Delicious and my sister ate her whole root beer float so she must have loved it too!"}
{"text":"My dad is always on the look out for cheap, fast-food burgers.  I'm always on the lookout for amazing food.  Combine those two directives, and one is prone to end up at Shake Shack on the Strip sooner or later while in The City of Sin.

Unbeknownst to me ahead of time, Shake Shack is evidently the \"In N Out of the East\", or so they say.  Probably a good thing they didn't have that bar set for them ahead of my visit, as In N Out holds a VERY special place in my heart (likely literally as much as figuratively).  

We showed up on a mild Friday night to a line about 15 deep, and it moved pretty quick.  The food menu is quite a bit more broad than In N Out (or at least not as secretive?), and there are a LOT of beverages and ice-creamy desserts on offer.  

I grabbed a Smoke Shack burger and a Coffee Fair Shake.  The burger was very, very good.  It is very close to being on-par with In N Out's offering.  There was awesome flavor coming from the burger as a whole, but I definitely want to call out the bacon on this one - it was distinct and flavorful, and really added a smoky layer of punch to the sandwich.  The shake was tasty as well.  Props go out for the different, funky shake flavors!

My brother-in-law was gracious enough to offer me one or two (okay, maybe a handful) of his cheese fries, which combine American and cheddar cheeses, and are as addictive as advertised.  At least that's the excuse I provided my brother-in-law for my heavy-handed 
\"share\" of fries...

I'm willing to say that the East Coast definitely has a hit on its hands with this joint.  So much so that I'm glad one isn't in my hometown, as I could see myself visiting here WAAAAAY too often!"}
{"text":"This place was super good and quick. Makes a great spot for lunch or a quick dinner. 

My date and I got the smoke house burger and the spicy chicken sandwich. The spicy chicken sandwich was good enough for both my date and I to discuss it's deliciousness. 

Service was excellent, fast and welcoming. 

Wish it was a little cheaper - but overall great food and great service."}
{"text":"I experienced \"accidental\" racism at this Shake Shack.  The middle aged caucasion/latin woman working the cashier on 3/20/15 around 4PM - after giving my name for the order asked me what my \"REAL\" name was, assuming my name, Jeff, was not my birth name and it had to be \"some asian sounding name.\"  WTF?  I was too shocked to even respond and to think that in this day and age, we still have ignorant folk.   My given birth name is Jeff and I was born in the USA.  Not that it matters.  Even if I did have an \"Asian\" name, and even if it was accidental,  her comments was rude, ignorant, and racist.  

It is what it is.  But Shake Shack coming from NYC, a place known for its diversity (as is Las Vegas), really should invest in cultural awareness training for their employees.

As for the food - mediocre.  I've had Shake Shack when in NYC, and I loved it there.  Warm and goey and delicious.  THIS SS really has lowered its standards.  My burger arrived cold.  The goey cheese inside the fried mushroom was chunky, not gooey.  

They need to get their act together here.  In more ways than one."}
{"text":"I was sooo happy to find this great family friendly part of the strip with indoor and outdoor seating. It's basic but delicious. The kids loved it and most importantly I loved it  the staff was also very nice. We ordered the chicken sandwiches and cheese burgers with fries and it was delicious we actually went back twice."}
{"text":"Obviously, I've been wanting to try Shake Shack for years. I assumed my first encounter with the venerable New York institution would be in New York itself, but I was happy to settle with Las Vegas (in, naturally, the New York New York casino).

It took a mere glance at the menu to decide that I wanted a double ShackBurger (cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce). I'll admit that the burger was much, much better than I expected. It arrived looking pretty much like a picture-perfect burger and the first bite certainly did not disappoint.

Pretty much my favorite thing in terms of a hamburger is that crust that forms on the griddle, and boy, did this burger have one hell of a crust. The meat itself could've been juicier, no doubt, but the combination of the irresistibly crusty patties and the perfectly proportioned condiments made this one of the best hamburgers I've eaten in a while.

We also ordered a side of the Crinkle Cut Fries, and they were fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I think it's over priced. Everything is high quality and tastes good. I just never get enough burger and fries and a tiny shake for almost 20 bucks. I ate the shakemeister dog last time tasted good not really what I was expecting. The cheese was almost like a nacho cheese but much better."}
{"text":"I visited Shake Shack with my boyfriend on a recent trip to Vegas. Overall I was pleased; the wait time was not long and the burgers tasted fresh. I had the vegetarian burger, which was really good, and we shared fries. We were surprised that the burgers were smaller than expected. They definitely have a lot of variety on the menu, and the custard style ice cream (which I sampled) that is also used in the shakes was thick. 

For the two of us, both with one beer each, the total came to about $35. It was reasonably priced as far as Vegas is concerned, however it left us a little lacking and there wasn't much \"wow\" factor for somewhere that has been talked up so much in the past. (Perhaps it's the novelty of having a Shake Shack out West that gets most people.) However, the wait staff was very friendly and helpful and we had a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I got the 'Shroom Burger with the cranberry lemonade and the fries. The 'Shroom Burger tastes great when it is fresh but be warned that the melted cheese in the middle may burn you if you eat it right away. The fries and drink were good too. The wait for our food wasn't very long and there was plenty of seating at about 8 pm on a Friday night. The location is accessed from outside of the New York New York casino with its own entrance."}
{"text":"I wanted to try Shake Shack to see what the fuss was all about. I went there on a Saturday and the service was extremely fast. I don't eat meat, so my options were limited to the Portobello Mushroom burger to which I also added cheese fries.
The burger was okay, but the mushroom was fried and it was too greasy for me. The cheese fries were served with a container of melted American cheese (to pour over it, I assume).

The nice thing about Shake Shack is that they serve alcohol (or at least at this location).

It was an okay, fast and relatively cheap meal but I prefer In N Out"}
{"text":"Best burger ever! The patty is pretty salty, but that contrasts well with the sweet bun and a sweet shakes. It's just a shame the drinks don't come before the meal as we were pretty parched. My advice is to skip the cheese fries (the cheese sauce is like that creamy gunk you get on nachos at the theatre - it's not great) but the fries themselves are good."}
{"text":"Just ate here and it was pretty great. First thing that struck me was how big and nice looking the place was. There's a huge TV in the middle. The tables were really nice as well as the table used to be part of a Brooklyn bowling alley. 

Ordered the SmokeShack burger with a Shackmeister dog and a beer float. The burger was phenomenal. The cherry peppers added both flavor and heat without overpowering the burger. The pickles was crisp and tasty. My favorite part was that all these ingredients didn't make the burger all sloppy. There's a lot of places where you would order a burger with peppers, pickles, lettuce, and sauce, and it turns into mush but this burger held up. 

The hot dog was great as well. Definitely a very cheesy dog and the shallots gave it a nice crunch. The beer float at first didn't seem too appealing. Don't know what beer they used, it's something pretty dark. Reminds me of the Devastator double Bock but can't be certain. It's a bit much but when the vanilla custard melts and combines with the beer, the tastes compliment each other. I can get used to drinking beer through a straw if it's got that vanilla custard in it. 

Another great touch is that they had calories on the menu. I love when restaurants let you know how many calories you are getting. It didn't stop me from getting all the deliciousness but it's easier to log into myfitnesspal and cry later. 

Place is definitely a place to stop in and eat. It costs a little more than regular fast food but it's worth it."}
{"text":"This Shake Shack is a must-visit for me each time I'm in Las Vegas! It's the closest one to me on the West Coast, and never disappoints in terms of quality and freshness. I highly recommend the Chicken Shack, Shack Stack, and Concretes. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Shake shack is one of my favorite burgers. My wife and I are always excited to come and eat their roadside shack burger. BUT, they took out the Roadside shack burger!!! It's okay, ima settle with the shack burger and their \"non-greasy feel\" fries."}
{"text":"This is \"the burger\". The fresh meat and delicious fries is always served. It is bit pricey but the burgers r superb. I go here every time I go shopping  at the mall. Their shakes r also big YES. It is way better than any other burgers."}
{"text":"What's not to love?  Great burger, beer, good strip pricing.   Great service.   A frequent stop on the way to a Golden Knights game.   Lots on the menu I haven't tried yet.   Need to do the fish."}
{"text":"First time to shake shack, but I will DEFINITELY be coming back. I got their most premium burger, which was only about $10, and was AMAZED at how good it was. The mushrooms were sautéed to perfection--much better than I honestly thought it'd be. I also got a cookie dough mint shake (it is SHAKE Shack after all) and was not disappointed at all. Overall it was great. Also, shoutout to the super friendly staff! You guys are true saints"}
{"text":"What an incredible experience at this location. First time I've tried their burgers and they are amazing. Concrete is fantastic and I'm sure everything else on the menu. Possibly my new favorite burger joint."}
{"text":"the food poisoning was worth it- both my boyfriend and I got food poisoning from this location while in Vegas this week- luckily we were both fine the next day/after many unpleasant bathroom trips- and we both agreed it was the best burger, cheese fries and milkshake we'd had!"}
{"text":"Yummy,yummy, yummy! Burgers were juicy and flavorful. Custard was smooth and creamy. Fried were made well done as requested. Definitely a do over if we are in the area. Line was a little long, crowds are to be expected, but the line moves fast and the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place gets really packed. I first heard about this place when I was living in NY. It was pretty hyped over there but I never got to try it because the line was unbelievable long at Central Park. When it first opened here in Vegas, I was super excited to try and when I did, I was pretty disappointed because it was an OKAY burger. The picture I took, looks awesome but the burgers are pretty small for the expensive price they charged. But our cashier was really happy and had great customer service. That made up for it."}
{"text":"The shroom burger keeps me coming back to Shake Shack every time I visit Las Vegas!  And who can resist crinkle fries?  Great service and good food."}
{"text":"This burger joint is legit love it however expect long lines! This place finally came to Vegas hooked everything is made with love...."}
{"text":"Another chain not found in my city was Shake Shack (though it has been announced that a couple locations will be popping up shortly in the St. Louis area). A friend that lives in Phoenix recommended I try out this place, and I'm glad that I did! I liked it as much as I did for In-N-Out Burger. (I know this will offend some people, but whatever...)

I'm not gonna lie, I thought it was super pricey having to pay $19 for a cheeseburger, cheese fries and a small salted caramel shake. But it all tasted great, so that kind of made up for it. The place didn't seem like your average burger joint, which was a good thing. Quality was what they promised, and I got it, so I guess I shouldn't complain. 

Can't wait till the company makes their way to St. Louis...."}
{"text":"Finally got to try the famous Shake Shack in Arizona of all places.  Conclusion? As a California girl I'm still team In N Out. 

I did have a very enjoyable meal with the burger, fries, and milk shake.  The burger was delicious. However I don't think it was really worth the price. Fries were aight. 

The salted caramel milk shake sounded more exciting than it actually was.  May have just been me but it tasted more like vanilla than salted caramel. I'd try a different flavor.  Also warning that all this food WILL cause you to feel like crap and food coma. Proceed with caution haha. 

I'm glad I finally got to try Shake Shack but now that it's out of my system I may not care to come back again."}
{"text":"Here we go. Shake Shack the latest, greatest thing ... for burgers.

The place looks like a stylish version of Starbucks that sells you burgers, shakes and weekly changing desserts.

Unlike In-N-out you don't need to wait in calling distance to the counter to pick-up your orders. That process is solved with a vibrating thingy you can take to any free table you like... if there are free tables... just like at In-N-Out.

The burgers weer great, the experience was nice and comforting. But is this place worth the hype? It's probably again, like Starbuck. great at first, but it will give in over time."}
{"text":"Ok so here we are in Las Vegas trying out the best from the east.? can they beat our in and out burger?
Well so we came here close to lunch time and what else it's packed. Duh....  Wait time pretty long about 45mins and finally we have our burger. I had the stack burger? It's with portobello mushroom. And dang it's pretty yummy. Not bad but for us Californian in and out still had em at the price, and total wait time. Everyone has different about their burger so for me, not a bad burger at all. I would come back and have em again. 
I gave em 4 star since wait is killing me and if I came during slow time. I definetly gave 5 stars."}
{"text":"Shake Shack has always been hype. I was never impressed by any of the New York locations, but for some reason (a 3-day cumulative hangover) I decided to give the Vegas location a shot.
Shake Shack is notorious for its lines, no matter the location, and this one is no different. The speed of the line, however, was absolutely abysmal. From my time getting in line to when I received my food, nearly an hour had passed. The employees behind the counter seemed to be in no rush to move the line along.
As for the food- it's Shake Shack. The burgers are tasty, the toppings fresh, and the milkshakes thick and flavorful. But for the price, a lot more is expected. So, I guess I was not disappointed in my visit, as I knew what to expect. 

There's an In n Out right off the strip. hint. hint."}
{"text":"Probably the best cheese fries I have ever had in my entire life so on that alone, I will give it 5 stars. I don't eat red meat but I knew that my protein options were limited going in so I had a pretty open mind. I got the chicken dog. It was alright, I needed more toppings like sauerkraut but this is a burger place, not a hot dog joint so I wasn't too upset. Next time I'll have to get one of those scrumptious looking milkshakes."}
{"text":"Let me just say this about Gabby and her staff:

{"text":"I would eat here a lot if it wasn't on the strip. It's the best! My boyfriend gets one of the shack burgers and I get a hot dog. 
I heard there's one opening in downtown summerlin which means I'll be there every other day. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Okay, I was hesitant to give 5 stars because giving 5 stars is rare for me. And maybe it could be just from the excitement of finally getting to try this place, but there it is. I've only had this place once and I'll have to wait until the one in LA opens to try it again, but my first experience at this location was so good. Had to stop by when we were in Vegas. I've heard so much about this place and just had to judge for myself.

Along with burgers, they also serve hot dogs, frozen custards, and alcohol!

Came in on a weekday afternoon. There was a bit of a line, but it went super fast! We ordered the Shack burger, Shack Stack burger, fries, 50/50, and mango lemonade. I gobbled up my Shack burger quickly, it was so good. I liked the soft hamburger bun and juicy cheesy patty. I'm not a fan of mushrooms, but I did have a bite of the Shack Stack and liked it! I especially loved the tasty muenster cheese, I started dipping my fries in it when I got the chance ;] The crinkle cut fries were crispy and delicious. I will for sure try the cheese fries next time.

The woman who took our order was really friendly. She noticed my boyfriend's taiko jacket and started small talk about taiko :) Also, somebody came around to ask customers if they needed anything.

Can't wait for the LA location to open."}
{"text":"Love this place! Good food and good service. That's all you can ask for. Lines are always long but you still get through pretty quickly. Burgers are very good and so are the shakes."}
{"text":"SAM is awesome! His customer service was memorable. I live in CA and go out of my way for shake shack, so it is wonderful to be greeted so warmly. And obviously, Shake Shack is delish. 

*also Sam deserves a raise ;)"}
{"text":"I've finally started to feel good about Henderson's food scene after a long history of discontent, and now it has even more legitimacy with this newest location of a burger chain with a massive cult following.

If you haven't heard about Shake Shack, they're a very popular chain that's grown from a humble New York City park kiosk to, by my count, 75 locations spanning the United States and even more overseas. The Henderson restaurant is located at the edge of the main portion of The District at Green Valley Ranch, with a corner location that is very easily sighted if you're entering from Green Valley Parkway. Expect to have a decent walk from eligible parking spots, unless you're cheating via one of the designated areas for nearby offices...

Today was only my second time ever going to a Shake Shack, and I was surprised that there wasn't more of a line for their grand opening. Although the details aren't publicized, they seem to have free goodies for the first 100 people, including dessert and Shake Shack-branded (cheap) sunglasses. The ordering line was still a bit slow for how many people there were due to training, but I'm sure they'll pick up the pace soon enough.

They do offer an app on iOS and (very recently on) Android if you wish to place your order half an hour or more ahead, then walk directly to the pick-up area at the arranged time. Otherwise, you should probably expect a line as word emerges that they've opened here, and don't be surprised if you have to wait outside in the heat because the indoor designated waiting area is rather small compared to a location like the one on the Las Vegas Strip.

If it wasn't obvious by the calorie counts on the menu replete with a variety of burgers, hot dogs, fries, desserts, and drinks (including beer and wine), the meals here can get quite filling. I didn't expect the complimentary single-size Pie Oh My ($4.65 normally), but it was a fun concrete with pretty good peach pie and vanilla custard. The only concern is that it melts while you're trying to eat everything else, so you'd be better off ordering it again afterward.

I did have to polish off dessert first, lest it turn into dessert soup, but the rest of the meal was delicious. The Double SmokeShack ($9.69) was thoroughly enjoyable from the meaty Angus patties through to the potato bun, with the chopped cherry peppers packing a more restrained punch than the more commonplace jalapeño and the Niman Ranch bacon and ShackSauce filling out the rest of the flavor. I did have a concern about the meat not being cooked to medium (the only other option available aside from well done), but I'll let it go because the cashier was clearly still in training. Next time though, I'll double-check my receipt.

The Fries ($2.99) are quite tasty as well. They're crinkle cut and properly seasoned, and they're fried to a golden brown crisp while still being fluffy inside. They're fine alone or with ketchup. I found myself sorely lacking them during my first trip to a Shake Shack, and they're vital to a burger experience. Split an order with a friend if you want to make the calorie hit a bit easier.

The dining room was pretty spacious but can get crowded. They also have two television sets currently, as well as a shuffleboard table and a foosball table. I doubt that they'll add darts to complete the collection, but those games should at least be fun diversions for the kids, who were the only ones playing while I was there.

I enjoy Shake Shack a lot, although I don't quite _love_ love them to that 5-star extreme yet. They offer fast service but are certainly at least a tier up from any \"fast food\" places. That said, they also come at significantly higher costs (note: all Shake Shack locations that I've looked up are priced surprisingly similarly) that make me start to compare them to local burger joints as well, not just the obvious competitor chains. That said, they're definitely very good based on this meal alone, so I'll likely revisit them more often now that I don't have to make a trek to Summerlin or deal with the crowds and paid parking of the Strip."}
{"text":"Literally AWESOME service and great food if you are looking to indulge a little. I ordered a brownie batter shake and didn't like it, they gladly exchanged it for a custard which was rich and delicious. They even brought it to my table. I was so pleased with the kind service. I definitely recommend it, the food it also very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"To this native Californian, Shake Shack is an almost mythical beast that has received heaping praise from In-N-Out fans. He hasn't been out to New York City to see what the hype was about, and it seemed like it would take ages until he finally would be able to visit this so-called mecca.

But last year, he found out they would open a restaurant to open in Las Vegas. So he waited. And waited. And waited a few more weeks after it had opened, out of concern for the lines.

Today was the day. Finally, he would brave the crowds and navigate the labyrinth that is the Strip. He did not want to try White Castle further up the strip without having given a go at what would likely be the better burger. So he parked at the New York New York Hotel & Casino's self-parking garage, found his way through the casino, and strolled northward down the sidewalk. At about half an hour before noon, he finally arrived at his destination.

The line started outside and led to another maze inside, this one marked by the cordons. The Californian was quite patient, enjoying the air-conditioned room that  even in Spring-like weather was a relief from the desert outside. After perhaps 20 minutes' wait overall, he finally placed his order.

It would be almost another 15 minutes before his pager would ring. He was amused that these receivers were more akin to remote control devices than to the square coaster pagers used by other restaurants. Having forgotten to ask earlier, he was also glad to find stacks of plastic cups for obtaining water from the faucets. While he was playing with his phone, his pocket buzzed, and he knew immediately that the time had finally come.

He exchanged the gadget for his tray. He quickly found a seat on a high table that was being used communally by three other groups. He took a photograph of his Shack Stack burger (you would say \"of course he did!\" if you knew him), and then he ate his burger. Some might call it a slow pace, but he preferred to enjoy the flavors as best he could (as well as avoid potential indigestion).

He found the flavor of the meat patty to be much to his liking. The patty was cooked approximately to the default medium, perhaps medium-well. He regretted not ordering it rare for a brief second. He shrugged and continued to enjoy the burger, noticing the soft bun, the crunchy portobello mushroom, the gooey cheese, and the ubiquitous lettuce and tomato.

As his burger dwindled down to a few bites, he noticed that some of his neighbors at the table had obtained their order and that they had cheese fries. He asked if they would, pardon the odd request, be so kind as to sell him a fry so that he could taste it. They were generous enough to agree without any charge. While the cheese was a bit redundant with all the cheese already in the burger, he found that the fry did have a nice crisp on the outside and was salted properly. He realized perhaps a bit too late that having the fries and some ketchup might have complemented the burger.

In spite of that, he was certain in his belief that the burger needed to be able to stand on its own. In most respects, it did. However, the savoriness of the burger did not quite match that of his other favorite burgers, and there wasn't much sweetness to be found in the Shack Sauce, whereas the sauce provided by In-N-Out did have that element, and the relish he had requested on his burger at a recent Five Guys visit also provided that flavor. While he did in large part enjoy his burger, he did not feel a pressing need to return on his own because those other options are more accessible and would be certain to provide more satisfaction at a significantly lower price.

Lastly, our protagonist would urge you to try Shake Shack for yourself and decide for yourself where they stand in the burger hierarchy. He doesn't place it at the very top, but perhaps you might."}
{"text":"Wanted to see what all the hype was about.  The burger was very good.  The meat was a rough grind (which I love) and very flavorful.  The crinkle cut fries are my favorite type of fry and all of our fries were crispy.  The how dogs are Vienna brand and always delicious.  The shakes were awesome.  The only complaint I could give is the size of the burgers were in the small side and pricey.  Maybe because the burgers are all natural Angus beef freshly ground and  antibiotic-free."}
{"text":"As someone that waited in line for over an hour when Shake Shack opened in Manhattan, I feel very confident posting this review about my experience in Charlotte:

Pros: line was out the door (standard), but only 10 minutes long, there was plenty of seating and that's about it.

Cons: the staff was pretty brutal. Despite being open for several weeks, the staff was disorganized, overwhelmed and seemed to be cutting corners and throwing food and drinks together sloppily.

My fiancee and I ordered two single shake burgers, two cheese fries and two shakes. The patties were average at best. The bun was soggy, there was barely any cheese on the burger, the cheese fries had little to no cheese and the shakes were nothing special. 

We spent $31 which is typical for their menu, and sadly, I wish the food lived up to the billing. We noticed tons of people complaining about their food and often couples next to us not finishing their burgers, fries or shakes. This is very abnormal from my prior experiences in NYC.

Despite the long lines, which aren't really long compared to other large cities, the service and food does not justify us coming back."}
{"text":"How awesome is it that Shake Shack is now in Arizona? SO AWESOME! Shake Shack was a favorite of our every time we went to New York so to have it in our own backyard is fantastic. We've already gone twice in three weeks.

Obviously, the burgers are a must. The burger itself is a high-quality meat, nice and juicy and I love their shack sauce. But perhaps the best thing is the bun - it's like a little pocket so the burger doesn't slide out the back. Genius.  

I also love the cheese fries. One order is big enough for my man and I to split.

On our last visit we tried the Chicken Shack. I will say the chicken was really juicy which is always a challenge on a chicken sandwich but it lacked a little something. Next time I think I would add a slice of cheese to it. It was good but the burger is way better.

And of course there are the shakes! Really yummy and thick. We like the black and white.

Next time we're going for the hot dog. I can only assume we'll have tried everything on the menu by the end of the year - haha!

Both times we went it was dinnertime and the line was long. This may be because it's still new. But considering the locations in NY always had lines too, only time will tell."}
{"text":"The lady who took my order was very helpful, she gave me a taste test of the peppers.  I just got the regular shack shack burger w/fries and a organic un sweet ice tea. Was very good :) fries were cooked the way I like them, crispy."}
{"text":"Today, I went back to Shake Shack after having a not so good experience my first time!
This time around the experience was great! The food was so much better, not greasy and the staff was awesome!!! Definitely will be returning!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Highly recommend if you like burgers and modern fast casual restaurants. I'm not usually super into crinkle fries, but these were crispy and delicious, especially when dipped in cheese! The Shack Attack concrete was also better than I expected. Those chocolate chunks had me like"}
{"text":"I have this friend from New York........ So I go to the shack, no one waiting the place is empty at 2:30 on a Friday. I'm a virgin; I let them know this. Were they anxious to give me suggestions or explain the offerings at all: NOPE! The employees couldn't be less interested in selling anything. In fact the mood was as if I was bothering them. I certainly missed out on some workweek hijinks from the very personal conversations that were taking place. Off to a shaky start, pun intended. Whenever I inquired how is this burger or how is that shake; the standard it's good was replied. I decide to be a purest and go for an original Shackburger, cooked Medium. Fries and the Salted Caramel shake. 

While waiting for you food I noticed the décor which is fun and trendy. There is a fixin's bar with ketchup, mustard, hot sauce, salt and pepper you get the idea. I grab the things I want and have a seat. 

$5.29 The burger a single patty seemed about 3 to 4 ounces, prepared correctly but NO flavor. I added salt and pepper it was less bland. It is very small for the price. The bun was nice and soft it actually had more flavor than the beef. 

$2.99 The fries, let my preface this with I love crinkle cut fries, these were not my fav. In my opinion they weren't even as good as Del Taco's. I don't use much salt but these were in dire need of salting! They were on the hard side as well perhaps over cooked a bit. Which again I normally like but these fell flat. Nothing exciting, small portion and over priced. 

$5.29 The shake was the worst part of my meal, it was so sweet I could not drink it! It tasted like a third of this very small cup was pure caramel. I thought if I mix it up more it will get better and that didn't help, it was unbearable I had to throw it out. The price on this very small shake about 12 to 16 ounces maybe? Um no thank you! I'll go across the street to Dairy Queen and get a better shake. 

So in closing for almost $15.00, I had a kids meal in a fancy space. Sorry Shake Shack I wont be back. 

For a sit down burger joint I will continue with my fav Steak N Shake, Twice the food for 2 3rds the price! Flavorful Original Double Steakburger, Large fry, Large Hand dipped shake under $10.00 Delish!"}
{"text":"This was my second time dinning here. The first time I was shocked that a hamburger, fry and shake cost nearly $20 after tax but it was delicious. 

My husband wanted to check this place out so here we are again. Final verdict: 

The food is pretty good but the prices are a bit high. $5.99 for a small hamburger $2 extra for an extra patty and the drink size for a regular is more of a small which they fill with ice (not a fan of the waisted space technique). I love the butter bun they serve with their hamburgers! Crinkle fries are nicely salted and soft. The shake I had (strawberry malt) was just okay. The chicken dog is not impressive, bun and dog. We ordered two single patty hamburgers, 2 drinks and a chicken dog for about $25... Yikes. These prices will keep us from coming back which is a shame. 

The tables are recycled wood which is awesome! I suggest having a refillable soda area accessible to customers and lowering their price points with added drink sizes."}
{"text":"Like a few others, I also don't get the hype over Shake Shack considering the west coast has a plethora of restaurants offering delicious burgers at varying price points, flavor, and quality.

I ordered the double hamburger with no bun, as I tend to find the bun takes away from the flavor of a delicious burger. The burger patties were pretty small (see photo) and I requested for extra tomatoes and only received a total of 3 small slices. Their shacksauce wasn't memorable and I ended up excluding it from the burger. Sometimes I think, \"hmm maybe I just didn't order the right thing\", but then I remind myself that if the plain hamburger is lackluster, then they probably shouldn't have it on the menu. The crinkle fries were ordered as well done and were tasty, but I still prefer thin-cut fries (especially shoestring!). I skipped on their shakes as I didn't deem them worth of the extra calories, and my friends didn't either after consuming them.

Overall the employees are friendly and there's plenty of seating indoors as well as on the patio area. The line appears long, but it moves fairly quickly and the actual turnaround time of your meal is less than you'd expect. I'd still prefer In-n-Out in SoCal or SuperDuper Burgers in SF because their sauce is delicious, their fries crispy and flavorful, and the burger meat stands out."}
{"text":"This shake shack is always the best. Great service and always great food. They even came around and offered free refills of our drinks. I love getting the shack stack burger because you get a delicious burger, cheese, and a cheesy portabello mushroom with all the regular toppings. I usually get the black and white shake for desert but today I'm going to try the cookies and cream shake. Large fifty fifty- fresh ice tea and lemonade as my beverage while I eat is always super refreshing and tasty as well."}
{"text":"Shake shack was delicious!  On a Sunday at two o'clock, line took about ten minutes to get through.  Their menu is extensive in options and they give you a restaurant pager to let you know when your order is ready.

I ate their Shackburger, regular fries, and had a vanilla milkshake as well.  The burger was very, very tasty, albeit small as others have noted.  The quality and texture of the burger makes up for the size however.  The bun and burger meat was just perfect and it is a softer hamburger to eat in comparison to other restaurants (which is not a complaint).

The crinkle cut fries were also delicious, though not my favorite fries.  (I prefer mine not as crispy and with a softer potato interior, more in like with in'n'out style fries, but I think I'm in the minority here.)  And the milk shake was also fantastic.  Vanilla flavor was very well done and the serving size was great as well.

If Shake Shack was next to an In'n'out, I would maybe go to Shake Shack maybe once for every six visits to In'n'out simply because of cost in comparison to portions.  Still absolutely five stars, and I would definitely recommend going here as the only con would be the serving size.  You will not be disappointed with the flavor and quality."}
{"text":"This is a great hamburger place on the strip! Don't skip the concrete either - somewhere between the consistency of a milkshake and ice cream right out of the container. It will be nice when they open the next location in Downtown Summerlin and traveling to the strip for this place won't be necessary."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is located inside Downtown Summerlin shopping complex right next to the Fogo de Chao restaurant and MTO Cafe.  I hadn't heard too much about Shake Shack except that it was the east coast's answer to In N Out so I was pretty excited to try it.  Walking in to Shake Shack the restaurant itself was clean and open, decorated with wooden walls, tables, and chairs.  To get your food you just walk up to the counter to order and then they bring out the food to your table.  Service was fast, friendly, and efficient.  Unfortunately the decor and service were the only things I liked about Shake Shack.  
 
The prices here are pretty steep for a burger joint because the entire menu is a la carte and doesn't include any meal options.  Between my parents and me, we ordered 3 burgers, 1 soda, 2 orders of fries, and 1 of their red velvet concrete desserts all for about $40, which is pretty expensive to me seeing that usually at other nice burger joints the three of us could eat for about $25-$30.  The fries were crinkle cut style, we thought they there were just okay.  All of us thought that the burgers we ordered were a bit more on the dry side and forgettable.  The dessert was overly sweet and nothing to go crazy over.  When it comes to Shake Shack I say save your money and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I was super happy to catch the opening of Shake Shack on the last day of my stay in Vegas.  Unfortunately, I was recovering from a bout of gastroenteritis (coincidentally, just like when I first tried Shake Shack in New York).  I settle for a simple single Shack Burger and it was just as delicious as the first time.  The patty is a little crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and tastes like real barbeque.  Creamy Shack sauce makes it even more delectable.  It is a little on the pricier side for a fast food burger, but I believe you're paying for a quality product.  My boyfriend seemed to agree- after wolfing down a double SmokeShack, he quickly stood up for seconds- a Shack Burger & chicken dog (!!!)

There was hardly a line on opening day and the staff were super friendly and genuinely excited to serve us.  Maybe they were just well prepared, but hopefully the service stays the same.  Doesn't hurt that they also have their own exclusive beer & wine.

Definitely adding this place to my list of favorite cheap, fast food eats on the Strip along with Secret Pizza & Earl of Sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We're from the Midwest so Shake Shack is not a restaurant we get to eat at often. The burgers were awesome and we loved the fries too. There was a line but nothing outrageous. The cashiers did a great job at keeping it moving."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers. Legit prices, the fries are good too. The milkshakes are delicious as well. I really don't know what else to say aside that this place is really amazing. If you are near, definitely a good try."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly workers. Love the service here. Love the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Nope haven't tried the one in New York, but the one in Vegas was more than good enough for me. I actually didn't even want a burger when my friends and I went, but something about their burgers. They must put crack in it or something. They're a nice dainty size compared to most other burgers, but that's what makes them so good. You don't feel overstuffed or gross after eating it. The bread so so soft and sweet. The fries also nice and crispy. It's just perfection. I miss it :("}
{"text":"First time at a shake shack. Was extremely impressed with everything - cleanliness, service, food, menu options, everything. They are doing a great job everything works like a well oiled machine!"}
{"text":"I did not like my shack attack (took 2 bites)told my server and then I asked for the Vegas one and then got charged for it so I did not eat anymore :( sad place"}
{"text":"Yummy food, was a bit expensive though. Paid alittle over $15 for the Shack Burger and the cheesy fries every one talks about, also a chocolate shake. The ambiance was super cool, explains why it was so busy!! Customer service was rockin!! Definitely would recommend. Mmmmmm just thinking about the food, YUM."}
{"text":"Burgers, chix sandwich, and cheese fries definitely satisfied our cravings ever since we had shake shack for the first time in Florida.  The vibe of the place in Scottsdale was really nice. Will be a once in a while splurge since shake shack is on the expensive side but oh so worth it!!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack holds a near and dear place within my heart. SS is responsible for my love of burgers. Their Non-GMO buns, fresh vegetables, and 100% beef really ignites the fire between my loins. 

A quaint but fulfilling burger joint with specialities in dairy blended ice cream. 

Believe the hype or not, this place is worth the drive. 

Try the bacon cheddar fries. AmaZing."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved Shake Shack when I tried it in May last year in NY and when I found out they have one in Vegas now, I FLIPPED. I have been missing it since last May! 

Located at the New York New York hotel, you can't miss it from the street. It is BEAUTIFUL at night with its glittery letters and bright lights! Anyway, I actually really liked this venue better than the one I went to in NY. There's LOTS of indoor & outdoor seating, televisions for sports games, and the line moves super quick!! I would seriously consider driving 4hrs just to get Shake Shack again. I am craving it now as I type this review..

I usually just order their version of a regular cheeseburger (cuz I don't like mushrooms). But I LOVE IT. Seriously, the bread they use is so soft and everything in the burger tastes good.  I also order cheese fries because it's BOMB. Ask for the cheese on the side though, for dipping. A perfect meal. I wish I had one closer to home (please open one in LA!!)."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars. Since I supplied material on the construction on this project, I wanted to check out the place up close and of course sample the food. I opted to walk here since my hotel was nearby.

The exterior storefront is gorgeous and the interior is chic and has flat screens thru out the dinning room and an extra large one at the center of the dinning area. This night happen to be the National College football championship -  so it was nice to dine and enjoy the game. 

Since this was my first time ever trying out Shake Shack and I wanted to mix it up. I ordered a single Shack Burger, Shack cago dog, crinkle fries and a peanut butter shake. I heart the remote sized buzzer that alerted me when my order was ready.

Overall the food was yummy - the buns are soft and fresh, everything was not overly salted. The hot dog was lean and the toppings were fresh. The burger was delish and the peanut butter shake was bomb! The gal who took my order was a newer employee in training but did a wonderful job.  There was plenty of staff on hand to service the customers needs.

BTW Shake Shack announced they are going public a few weeks ago and will be expanding furthermore. I'm looking forward for them to arrive to So Cal!"}
{"text":"My first time visiting a Shake Shack was their location in Chestnut Hill, MA. I wrote a review comparing them to In-n-Out (see link below); and I did complain about their soggy hand-cut fries, but it looks like that location has gone back to crinkle-cut like this LV location!

My cousin and I visited late night so the line was pretty quick. The service was friendly, and my cousin even got some free crinkle cut fries! The presentation of the burger was much better here (you'd think it'd be similar/the same since it's a corporate company) - similar to In-n-Out, the buns flared out a bit so you could easily see the inside.

As usual, I got my Smoke Shack which was awesome as always. Much spicier from the cherry peppers than I remember from Chestnut Hill. They had a good amount of bacon in every bite, and the patty was juicy! Their buns are also on the softer-sweeter side which I actually like but some may not prefer it. 

Lastly, I was also happy to see crunchy, crinkle-cut fries in comparison to the soggy ones I've had before at their other location. 

Overall, great experience. I'll be back since this is my closest Shake Shack to San Diego (hopefully, just for now)!

My review of Shake Shack - Chestnut Hill, MA:

{"text":"I was so excited to see that Shake Shack was slowly coming closer to the West Coast, as it was one of my favorite things to eat in NYC.

New York New York is located a bit far off the strip, but we made the trek and although the line was pretty long, almost out to the door, it moved really quickly and the food came out much quicker than I had expected.

I of course ordered cheese fries and the Shack Stack because when am I ever going to get a cheeseburger with a fried portobello mushroom filled with various cheeses in one besides Shake Shack? It is great that they also serve local Brooklyn beer in Vegas! Prices are very decent, and it was the perfect first meal to start off our Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"ah, yes, another trendy yet overrated place to munch. that being said: yum, but mostly yum @ their cheese fries"}
{"text":"After reading all the amazing reviews ,felt I had to check out this place since it is close to cosmopolitan where I was staying at.Got the shroom burger and fries. The burger and the fries were ok and nothing special .I felt it was more hype.
Pls do note that there is a long wait time."}
{"text":"It's in the West coast now!!! I can see why people say it's a must try, had to drag the fiancée here before we left Vegas. Tried the Shack Stack...omg! Sooooo good, I love mushrooms so when it's in my burger especially if it's like a patty..yum! I want to try the shakes but when in Vegas usually have an alcoholic drink lol."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time ever when it came to the mall.
Pros:
Clean restaurant for the most part
Convenient location
Great chicken burger
Solid regular cheeseburger
Solid crinkle cut fries that are never burnt
Line usually goes by quickly
So far haven't received a wrong/messed up order

Cons:
Sometimes too busy so no seating available
Slightly overpriced for the quality
The fries portions are too small IMO
The beef burgers are just okay, not amazing like the chicken burger but not bad.

Overall, beats a lot of burgers including In-N-Out. Yes I said it."}
{"text":"Came to try the shake stack burger with cheese fries! 

The burger was delicious! It was super flavorful, and the mushroom patty had cheese in it! I would definitely come back to eat here again. 

People compare this place to in n out but it's completely different. The way the burger patty is cooked is different, the flavoring is different. This place is delicious and I'd definitely come back to try the rest!"}
{"text":"Being a Californian, I get really excited whenever I see Shake Shack because sadly we don't have all of this goodness out there.  I've only been to two other Shake Shacks other than this one (one of which is the one in New York New York on the Strip).  Today, I ordered a burger with fries (no cheese) and the vanilla concrete.  The burger, although very good and fresh, seemed to have a soggier bun than the buns that I had at my previous visits to Shake Shack.  Otherwise, the burger was pretty delicious.  I have no idea what that Shake Sauce is, but it is pretty darn good.  The patty was well seasoned and very fresh. 

Unfortunately, the fries are nothing to write home about.  They are crispy and tasty, don't get me wrong, but  they are nothing notable.  They taste pretty similar to freezer fries.  The vanilla concrete didn't taste much different from any regular blizzard/freeze/McFlurry like concoction.  A single is pretty small and might not be worth the $3.50.

For fast food, Shake Shack is pretty expensive.  But the burgers are so good and fresh that I always come back!  The service here is very fast and friendly as well.  And a huge plus is that this location is much less busy than the one on the Strip - of course!"}
{"text":"Being a California girl, I never had the opportunity to eat at the infamous Shake Shack until I came to the only location on the west coast when I arrived in Vegas.  I got the Shake Stack - a delicious burger with a deep fried cheese stuffed portobello mushroom.  The bun was brioche like - very soft and delicious.  The bun is also a great concept - it is partially sealed on the bottom so juices don't go flowing everywhere.  The patty was flavorful and the veggies were fresh.  However, the portobello put it over the top and set it a part from all other fast food burgers.  The cheese fries were on point too - very crispy and just the perfect amount of cheese.  This was an amazing burger and lived up to its hype.  

The service was great - employees were very friendly and the food came out fast.  It is such a bargain to be able to get a meal on the Strip for under $15."}
{"text":"Sorry NY, Shake Shack ain't that great. I've never actually had Shake Shack in NY but I tried it for the second time in Vegas this past weekend and again, thought it was just okay. I ordered the Shack Burger, which is their most basic cheeseburger. The patty was salty and I don't really like the soft, mushy bun. Also, the size of the burger is pretty small. I eat relatively small portions and even I was barelyy full off the single. I do like their crinkle cut fries and their concretes though. Personally, I don't love Shake Shack but I guess it's nice to have the option of eating at an east coast exclusive eatery in Vegas now."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about Shake Shack months before I found out they're in Vegas, hearing comparisons such as \"the In n Out of the East Coast\". While I agree the burgers and fries are awesome, I hardly think you can compare the two mainly because Shake Shack is much more expensive than In n Out. Two burgers, one fries, and a root beer float cost over $26 - that's not really fast food price, it's more of a sit down burger joint price. I did really like the crinkle fries though - it was so perfectly crispy, perfectly seasoned. My Shack Stack was also delicious, although the whole time I was wishing they'd put more sauce in it. 
I'd honestly just commit blasphemy and bring In n Out sauce to put on the burger here. Now THAT would be the best burger ever."}
{"text":"So freaking good!  I wanted to try this place and so glad I did.  The line moves so quickly and the service is great!  It is easy to find a place to sit so don't be intimidated if you see that it's busy.  We went twice during our trip! We tried the shroom burger, the shack burger, cheese fries, and the chicken shack.  Everything was really good!  A great place to eat if you like burgers."}
{"text":"Quality over quantity. Go for shack stack and cheese fries and a concrete. If you're still hungry after that then you've got a bigger problem."}
{"text":"Shake Shack vs. In-N-Out. Which one is better?

I ordered fries & the Shackburger - their original cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce, which was much pricier than a cheeseburger at In-N-Out ($5.19 vs. $2.55). The Shackburger is satisfying and definitely worth a try if you're looking for a hyped up burger joint from the East Coast. However, there was nothing spectacular about it. Don't get me wrong, the burger was tasty, but quite plain. On the other hand, the crinkle cut fries reminded me of the frozen ones you could purchase at a grocery store. 

In conclusion, Shake Shack makes a tasty burger with minimal ingredients; I would definitely be interested in coming back to try their other burgers and shakes. BUT I still like In-N-Out way better!"}
{"text":"It is shacking over here because my food was too good. First experience at Shake Shack and I'm loving it. Little did I know driving by in my home town I was passing up on some good food. 

I'm not a burger person or into shakes but they offer much more. Today I had a chicken sandwich minus the mayo and crinkled fries. Yum! Yum! The creative concept of a modern day restaurant makes this a happening place. The hip feel, music, and tv's is an added touch. The restaurant is printed  on the wall along with the registers. Many items to choose from that have been creatively mastered to all taste buds. Kids meals included. Fresh lemon dates, draught root beer, sodas and beer to wash the tasty food down. 

The service was great. Friendly staff that help make your fast food experience a nice one. Did not have to wait long. I was given a buzzer to use while I sat and waited. Condiments on point. The right ones for the food they offer."}
{"text":"Convenient location if you're a guest at the Green Valley Resort or if you're playing at the casino. It's located amongst a bunch of clothing stores and other restaurants in a charming outdoor style shopping area. 

If you've never had Shake Shack, please try it as soon as you can. I'm from California and they often compare this place to In N Out. I like the former very much, don't get me wrong.

Pros of Shake Shack: Better beef patty quality, and thicker than In N Out. Better bun, more selec

We visited twice during our week in Henderson. Both times the staff at the register were friendly, polite, and nice. Didn't wait too long from when we ordered to when we got our food, so that was good. As always, everything was fresh, hot, and the fries were crispy. My favorite shakes to get are the Black and White, and the Salted Caramel. 

The burger size is perfect for me. They're a little on the small side, so they don't feel overwhelming. The prices are definitely more than In N Out's prices. To give you an idea, if you order a burger, fries, and a shake, it's already going to be about $14 with tax.

Word of advice, don't look at the calorie count next to each item. Just enjoy and let go for one day."}
{"text":"Its ok! I do like the location and the interior design of the place. Its very open and very spacious. I didnt try a shake but next time I go I'll try one. The bacon burger did hit the spot though."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place gets so much praise.  It was just another burger place.  That Burger Joint and Five Guys are definitely better.  My husband did enjoy the shake but I wouldn't be back for the food."}
{"text":"Very busy location but line and service moves quickly. The lady taking our order was very rude but the lady passing out and organizing the orders people were picking up made up for it, she was organized but so nice too. Same quality Shake Shack - I get the Shackburger and fries. Location right on the strip near New York, New York."}
{"text":"Awesome service the food tasted great. The fries were fresh and the person who served us at the table brought extra fries and even a sample of the awesome custard."}
{"text":"Fuck In-n-Out.... This is much better. The Shakes are better, the fries are 1000 times better and the Burgers are killer. 
 Im sure all the west coast Lemmings would disagree. These are fantastic."}
{"text":"Hot dog was o.k., strawberry shake was better! I would have liked to eat outside, but too many flies. Inside seating was scarce, a bit hectic, and wifi was overloaded, I think due to the masses."}
{"text":"I've tried the ShroomBurger (twice) and I've gotta say that I liked it!  The portabella mushroom was cooked perfectly and the cheese (filling) was excellent.  I'm only taking off 1-star, because they tend to cook the burgers a bit longer than I like.  I know it's allways about Risk for the establishment, but if they would cook the burger a bit closer to medium than well, they would offer a truly juicy burger... and I would offer a 5-star rating.

By the way, the sides are always great... and so are the desserts."}
{"text":"My mom, sister and I were looking for someplace to eat before the Bruno Mars concert and remembered my dad telling us about this burger place. My dad knows when someplace is a good burger place and he had nothing but good things to say about it, so we tried it out. 

The location is very clean and calm not too loud although next to the strip. First impression was great. The line moved quickly and we ordered our food. We got 3 shack burgers, fries, and chocolate shake. It took about 10 minutes for us to get our food. The food looked and smelled great. The burger was juicy and freshly made. Crinkle cut fries that tasted great with just enough salt. We also shared a coke. I was surprised but not tasting the chlorinated water that I usually taste when going to McDonald's, In-N-Out, or Jack in the Box. 

I rarely write reviews but this place was worth it!"}
{"text":"Desde que las probamos por primera vez en Nueva York se convirtieron en una de nuestras hamburgesas favoritas. Y cuando nos enteramos que en Las Vegas habia un Shake Shack supimos que teniamos que ir.\""}
{"text":"Lots of hype around this place.  Very nice and clean restaurant in DT Summerlin.  Little bit of a hipster vibe which is usually a good sign for foodies.  The burger was good but if you here you have to get a shake to make it worth the visit."}
{"text":"Didn't really know what to expect. When In and Out opened here, people went crazy. When Culvers opened here, people went crazy. When Shake Shack was announced, people got excited also.  I never understood why people go wild over new fast food joints opening. It's a meal you can't really mess up all that much, and you get what you pay for. 

Today's visit to Shake Shack Kierland Commons started with managed expectations.  We got there just in time around 11:45 am. Only about 2 people in front of us, but the line behind us started getting longer and longer. If you don't like lines, don't come at lunchtime. 

We ordered a regular burger and the portabella mushroom burger, one order of cheese fries, a regular fry and 2 diet cokes - about $27. As a vegetarian there are usually few options at fast food places so I appreciated the mushroom burger option.  Upon ordering you get one of these pagers that vibrates when your food is ready. 

We sat inside at first; it was however so loud we couldn't have a conversation. Moved to the ample outside seating. The weather was nice enough to do so. We waited about 12 minutes for our food. My friend's burger was good; he remarked that it reminded him of the burger at In and Out Burger. My portabella mushroom burger was excellent. It was filled with cheese, breaded and cooked. The combination of bun, texture of the somewhat crispy mushroom, lettuce and tomato, and the sauce was quite good. Each bite caused the cheese to ooze out. The regular fries were just that. Crinkle-cut, warm and crispy, but nothing you can't get anywhere else. The cheese fries were the same covered with what appeared melted Velveeta, which formed a skin by the time you got back to the table, quite disappointing really.

We picked up a doggie treat (custard, peanut butter sauce and a dog biscuit) for our pooch at home at $5. 

The counter service and the people working the floor were super. They were friendly, offering service and making you feel at home. So good to see! The restaurant itself, located in the center of Kierland Commons is nice looking, with ample indoor and outdoor seating. Aside of sodas they also serve beer and a few other alcoholic beverages. 

I would say Shake Shack did not exceed my expectations and it didn't disappoint. If you want a better fast food experience at prices equal to Red Robin but in a fast food setting this may be the place."}
{"text":"First time at Shake Shack today, Fashion Square Scottsdale. Great layout and seating. Efficient service. Awesome burger and fries. Tip: do not buy a glass of wine! Total ripoff, $8 bucks for maybe a four ounce poor! Realize this is a burger place, but that is ridiculous, stick with a beer or shake"}
{"text":"Great burgers. One of the best burgers on the strip. Would've given it 5 stars, but they got the order wrong. We ordered cheese fries. When I picked up the order I asked where the cheese was. The lady looked at the receipt and said, \"you weren't charged for it.\" She then pushed the tray to me. Not the end of the world, but would've been nice if they had done something more than just push the tray back at me. I would've gone back and paid for it too."}
{"text":"TL;DR - The Burgers here have good flavor, but In & Out Burgers taste fresher. Eat both and compare for yourself. The Shakes here are delicious. The fries here taste like the Ore Ida frozen crinkle fries. Check this place out if you are on this side of the strip (definitely one of the better places in this area)

I've had Shake Shack on the East Coast and the Las Vegas one tastes the same, definitely a good representation of Shake Shack.

Location: On the strip by New York New York Casino by MGM Park.

Staff: Everyone here has been friendly every time I've come here.

Ambiance: Nice open seating area with multiple sections. A high table that seats a big group that is right in front of a gargantuan screen that is constantly playing sports. A more secluded dinning area, and the remainder of the seating is within sight of the big screen.

Food Review: As everyone compares Shake Shack to In & Out Burger, the only thing I'll say is the ingredients at In & Burger taste fresher, but is more basic, and the flavor of the burgers at Shake Shack are better & more unique.

The ShackBurger is their basic burger and tastes like a regular burger, I would go somewhere else if you are looking for just a basic burger. If you are coming here for a shake and just want a regular burger then the ShackBurger is fine.

The SmokeShack Burger is my favorite burger here. The bacon with the chopped cherry peppers are delicious. I don't think you can go wrong by ordering this burger **Recommend*

At Shake Shack you can order 3 different types of fries - Regular, Just Cheese, Cheese & Bacon, and Fully Loaded.
The base french fries taste like the frozen Ore Ida crinkle cut french fries from the grocery store. Are they bad? No. Are they stand-out? No. Are they basic french fries? Yup.
The Cheese fries are the same as the base fries, but you add some nacho cheese... Like the nacho cheese from the snack shack at a sporting event. That's it.
Bacon & Cheese fries are a step up with enough bacon to elevate their cheese fries to eye brow raising, as in *I see what you are doing here ShakeShack and I approve*.
Fully Loaded Fries take all of that and add some cherry peppers to them and come in a huge mega-froyo style cup. With the peppers, it makes the dish worth ordering. In a perfect world, this would be Shack Shake's base fries.

Shakes, their name sake, and they don't dissapoint. They have standard milk shakes, nothing too over-the-top or frilly, but definately great shakes.
Vanilla is what it seems like - a good vanilla shake.

Peanut Butter Shake is the one I recommend. If you like Peanut Butter, as a flavor, you HAVE to get this shake. 10/10 right here."}
{"text":"One of the best burger spots in Las Vegas. No Vegas prices here all the food is made fresh to order and in my opinion beats In&Out hands down. Bread is fresh and meat is well prepared especially smothered with hot peppers. Crinkle cut fries are fried to perfection. No complains what so ever. I wish I had one near by, because I'm positive I would definitely eat there 2-3 times a week."}
{"text":"We ordered concrete, guess what? how the amount was so small.  There was a huge hole in the middle, all the way to the bottom, there were not much ice cream, the mixing was not good, it was not worth to pay $5. We just went to two other shake shacks recetly on vacation, so we have recent experience with the standard amount. We are very disappointed with our local shake shack."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is just THE BEST, and this location is no different. 

I was worried about coming here since it's the only location in Las Vegas, right on the strip. I went around lunch time on a Saturday. There was a line of course but it moved SO FAST. They must have so many people working. 

I ordered the Chicken Shack for the first time and it was truly life changing. I was talking about it the rest of the day. The herbed mayo and pickles really made the flavor of the chicken stand out. 

The cheese fries and custard were as good as ever.

Our party of 8 was also able to find two booths to sit in, so that just shows there is plenty of seating. 

I'm so anxious to try the Shake Shack in LA!"}
{"text":"What a great place to try! I honestly loved everything about this place. The service was great for such a crowded area. They're super organized and they do their best. The portion size for the price I would say is pretty fair. I love these fries that they have. So much better than most places. I did get cheese fries though and I thought that was a little of a disappointment. The cheese on the fries were just slices of cheese that they melted which I didn't really think was worth the price, but overall it was a great meal. Their burgers are really good. I loved the taste and the buns aren't soggy at all. I would recommended everyone to come try it. Oh and the shakes are amazing too! Try it all!"}
{"text":"Everything was okay.  Deco was great but we were not there to eat the deco.  Sizes were rather small (I need second lunch!)  It just made me realize what a great job IN n Out burger does to deliver quality food at reasonable price.  I bet Shake Shack success is partly due to lack of In N Out Burger in NYC.
I wouldn't be back, for this kind of price point there are better options in the area that are locally owned."}
{"text":"If you like burgers, you're going to love this place. It's just a great burger and my favorite place to grab one. If you're in town and just want to get some good service with not the huge overpriced resturants on the strip, just come here and you'll end up liking the service, clean space, and food."}
{"text":"Standard fare Shake Shack which is pretty darn good in my book. This particular restaurant has a really good atmosphere. It was spacious and had a lot of TVs to watch the game."}
{"text":"Finally trying food here. Hot dog is tasty w/ all the fixings. Burger is done well.  Good fresh toppings."}
{"text":"So I've had shake shack before in Vegas and really enjoyed it (thought it was better than in-n-out)! 

My family and I ordered an array of burgers, fries, and milkshakes. I don't remember the prices being as high as they were in Vegas but we spent about $50 on 2 double burgers, 2 chicken sandwiches, 2 cheese fries, a drink and a milkshake which is insane...

But all in all I still enjoyed the burgers they were made to order with fresh ingredients, loved the crinkle cut fries, not a huge fan of the chicken sandwich but at least we tried a variety of items on the menu to know what is good. I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm saying it but I like shake shack better than in-n-out  fries are crispy and amazing, burgers are juicy and delicious and there is nothing bad I can say about it! I love a good burger! I've had in-n-out, White Castle, and Gordon Ramsay's BurGr. Shake shack ranks #2 in my Vegas burger adventure. The ingredients are fresh and amazing and it's fairly priced! Everyone says in-n-out is a must if you see it but I have to disagree! I totally think shake shack trumps in-n-out White Castle is good when you're super drunk and you want something extra greasy to soak up some of that alcohol but seriously shake shack is where it's at!"}
{"text":"Fries were AMAZING, didn't get a shake (shame face), burger was delish!!! But not as good as in-n-out unfortunately (i.e. bun, sauce, cheese)"}
{"text":"5 stars for customer service, 2 stars for how expensive it is, 3 stars for the taste. We had the portobello mushroom burger. Maybe the other items are great on the menu but for the vegetarians ... not so good."}
{"text":"Tasty burger and chicken sandwich. For the price though, I'll be going elsewhere. I've been waiting a long time for shake shack to open in phoenix and was hoping it'd be worth it but my opinion is it's not. Hopdoddy happy hour or a few other local places you'll get more bang for the buck."}
{"text":"I always knew shake shack would make it's way to the west coast! found out upon arriving in vegas with my fam of the grand opening and decided to take them to try out the burgers & shakes. We all ordered the shake burgers with crinkle fries. My mom became an instant fan saying she liked it better than in & out because of the bread and my dad really liked the fries =) bf and have always liked their burgers but we have another favorite whenever we visit NYC We are obsessed with their shakes though! The black & white is our faaveee 
This spot is definitely gonna take over our usual vegas grub spot (earl of sammich) whenever in town now!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to see what all the hype was about so we decided to check it out. Wow ! I was very unimpressed burgers and fries were nothing special at all! Shake was ok save your money and go to Culivers or in and out burger !!! review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"I happened to be in the neighborhood so I decided to swing into Shake Shack to get my burger fix on. 
This location is clean, has convenient parking, and lots of seating. They also have a broken foosball table (just a couple of handles left) that drew in the noisy kids while I was eating.

I will be honest, I misread the menu. I ordered the 'shroom burger with an extra patty thinking it was a mushroom-swiss burger. What came out was the most glorious non-meat burger I have ever eaten. It was two sensuously fried cheese filled portobello mushrooms. I am salivating thinking about them. The crinkle cut fries were cooked to perfection and were just kissed with a hint of salt. Soooo good. I have no doubt I'll be back and next time I'm trying a beefy burger!"}
{"text":"This stop was worth it! My first visit and I was worried the hype would ruin it for me. The lovely young lady taking out order was very friendly and double checked to make sure she entered it it properly (thank you!). I had a smokey double, the cherry peppers were the perfect accent. Yum and yum. The crinkle cut fried were perfectly salted and cooked perfectly. I also tried the Carmel Banana shake. The only down side is that I think I ate too much.

The lines are a little long and the seating for a larger group was tough, but if I hadn't stopped at 6PM I'm sure it would have been and easier run through.

I'll be back for more, no doubt about it."}
{"text":"I've actually never been to a shake shack and I'm pretty sure there is none in a Jersey! It was actually pretty good. The shakes were good, burgers were good, fries were good. So it was I guess just good. Nothing too special about this place and I guess I would go back if I needed a quick cheap lunch and there was one near by. No healthy options here by the way."}
{"text":"First of all, for the multiple reviewers who've complained the burgers here are \"greszy\", and you know who you are, they're SUPPOSED to be greasy. Greasy IS juicy. Juicy is greasy. 

This IS a good burger. Good, not great. 
But the patty is too small. WAY TOO SMALL. WAAAAAAAAY TOO SMALL. 

The counterhelp suggested I try the \"Smokeshack\".  This was a double burger with Neiman Ranch bacon with cheese,  chopped cherry peppers and ShakeSauce. Generous amount of bacon, the problem was the burger was made to look pretty for presentation but made for uneven flavor throughout the burger. There wasn't any ShakeSauce on the front half of the burger. Like Hopdoddy, I don't want to sacrifice flavor for appearance. Very uneven burger 

Crinkle cut fries were fantastic!!  PERFECT. 

Question for management: Why build a roof over the patio that allows rain to come through?!  I realize this is Phoenix and it doesn't occur often but it occurred yesterday and I didn't like it. 

Cutest young woman working the counter added select customer services - did not catch her name but she was very observant and helpful. 

So, at the end of the day, The Stand on Indian School Road serves \"The Standard, ($5.99 with cheese) and it's really good. It's 
a double cheese really similar to the Shackshack. 

Shakeshack charges $8.09 for a double cheeseburger, and therefore is 25% more. than The Stand. Why?  I mean really, Shakeshack is really, really OVERPRICED. 

Here's the list of the preferred:

1) Lucky Boy
2) Harvey's (16th St location only)
3) The Stand
4) Zinburger 
5) Red Robin

Bye for now!"}
{"text":"Pros: fast service, decent prices, relatively good food 

Cons: Loud, IN N OUT is better, has a dog menu (promoting dog obesity)"}
{"text":"Here's the East Coast competition to In n Out from the West Coast.  I was pretty impressed with Shake Shack.  It's a burger joint but better quality than your fast foot like McDonalds.  It's more like a Five Guys or In n Out.  

You can order single or double burgers, I like their crinkle cut fries and it's really good to get it with cheese sauce.  The cheese is a blend of 2 cheeses and is delicious. They were giving samples while I stood in line and they definitely sold me on it.  

The burgers are messy looking which I think they do on purpose.  Makes you feel like you're getting a yummy down and dirty burger.  It's actually great quality beef and veggies and the buns are also unique. The patties are really tasty and I service was quick.  

At this location in Las Vegas most of the cashier's seemed happy and helpful but my particular cashier seemed very disinterested.  She wasn't outgoing or nice, just took my order without really smiling or repeating it back.  

Other than that, I could see myself craving Shake Shack, I also want to try their shakes next time.  Good tasty burger that is quick but way better than fast food.  You definitely want to try it to see how they stack up against the other big names in this same genre.  I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"We always seemed to pass this place by as just another burger joint but its not! this place as amazing! me and my gf decided to try this burger spot since it was close to where we where staying at. We had the shack burger with a side of fries and a vanilla malt milkshake, the burger was amazing! the fries where just as good and the shake just topped it off. Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack is shake shack. The burgers are gourmet (2 burgers, fries and a shake cost us $30), so it's definitely not on the \"cheap\" side. However, I love their shroom burgers and custard shakes, so plus points on that.

This location was very clean and spacious. The line seemed long, but moved very quickly. Will definitely come back again if I have a strong urge for a burger on the strip."}
{"text":"Best place ever.  Super affordable compared to the general rip offs on the strip.  Great service at the ordering counter. I got the hot dog with cheese sauce- sooooo good, my boyfriend got the shack stack burger that had a burger patty and a mushroom one stacked on top and he loved it, then we got an order of the fries to share (so perfectly crispy and delicious), and a chocolate shake to split as well.  Holy crap to the chocolate shake. It taste. Like they grinded up real Hershey's bars into a shake form. It tasted like a real quality shake instead of the powder crap so many other places have.  Getting a main thing each, and then the fries and shake to split, left us both feeling perfectly satisfied, full, but not over the top.  I wish this place was in San Jose."}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack. High quality beef, soft sweet bun, shack sauce, crinkle cut fries, and awesome concretes. The lines can suck during peak times, but they now have an app to order in advance. 

One difference between most Shack's is that other stores have a separate line for concretes, Vegas does not, but you order your concrete and they can \"hold\" it until you are ready and just bring in your receipt when you are ready and they will make it for you."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Shake Shack and first off I don't eat fast food, but my blood sugar was getting low so we had to stop here. Where it's not exactly in-and-out, it comes in second. I had the chicken sandwich and it was really tasty. I was not impressed with the beer, but that's not what I was there for so I let it slide. My fiancé had the burger and fries and they were really good. There was a bit of a wait so apparently the word has gone out. Now they just need to open more of these of the strip."}
{"text":"I love burgers and I must say that this is the worst burger I've ever eaten. The burger patty was bland, the only thing helping the patty was the cheese. Let's talk about the carmelized onions WTF is that. They were past carmelization and tasted like shit; adding those to this burger was like adding insult to injury. I will never eat there again.  If you love burgers this is one to stay away from. Rip off."}
{"text":"This was one of the best burgers I have ever eaten.  We all enjoyed our food and the atmosphere.  It's Vegas, so it's busy, but they had lots of seating which was nice, and a big table in the middle for our big party.  Wish we had one of these where I live."}
{"text":"I don't know. I was expecting more from their burger. They are supposed to be a competitor for In-N-Out in the burger department and well I don't think Shake Shack's burgers are better. They are yummy, but they cost more than In-N-Out and don't taste better. I do however, like their custard shakes. However, their shakes didn't taste overwhelmingly better than other custard shakes I've had. I still recommend people to try it and the food is good. It just didn't meet what I was expecting. Also, don't let the long lines fool you. They have fast service! My rating is more of a 3.5/5."}
{"text":"Place is alright. Very clean and friendly staff.  Nothing special. Way over priced for sure."}
{"text":"Shake stack and French fries were amazing. Best burger I had in Vegas this year. Love the fried portobello mushroom with the melted muenster and cheddar cheese. It's freaking amazing. Hope they open one soon in California. I would put this way ahead of in n out."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Awesome shakes. Pretty fast but ohhhh... It's expressive for relatively small burgers. Plus they are all in Scottsdale... Where's the Gilbert love? Hurry up already and get a moving!"}
{"text":"Wanted to see the hype about this famous East Coast burger joint. The fries are really really good and crispy. The burger was cooked well, but it was really small. I finished the burger in 2 bites. You would think they would make their burgers more filling. So I think this place is too pricey for the burger they are selling, even though it was delicious. I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"if 5 guys & in n out had a baby.. this would be it.. i had the cheeseburger. SO GOOD. my only regret... i forgot to ask for pickles. the double down fries & the black & white shake, also delicious! fresh lemonade! looks like it gets really busy, but they move pretty fast. definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Tried this place. The most memorable thing is it's stupid expensive. The burgers are ok, small. The shake I had was decent but small. For 3 of us, we had 3 burgers, 2 shakes, 1 soda and 2 fries. $45.00. Next time just go to In and Out. Better food and cheaper."}
{"text":"Despite being out of sweet tea, no biggie (I'm not a jerk like some of you are).  The food was banging!  Can't wait until my next cheat meal! Nice polite staff as well.  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Burger was great...the meat has the umami flavor in it! The shake is the bomb... super thick peanut butter!"}
{"text":"Disgusting, don't waste your money. I am beyond confused with the rave of this place.
Over priced, and bite sized burgers that have no flavor."}
{"text":"Over priced average burger that on most days Wendy's beats hands down. Receipt time (visited today, Saturday, June 23rd) was 12:08, food arrived after a bit of confusion at 12:27. What, is the menu that complex? It's a burger joint! This place is a one and done. I can't see what the hype is all about unless the competition in NY was so lousy that people would gladly pay $5.29 for a $3.00 burger. My wife got their Shack-cago Dog, which JJ's on East runs circles around.  It was slightly better priced at $4.29. The French fries at $2.79 are over priced and rate as ok, crispy on the outside and mostly air inside - we termed them as air fries. The brand name may keep the people coming but the food won't be the reason to return."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I was so impressed with the burger. I wished that I remember what I ordered because the second time I went here and chose the smokeshack, it tasted so bad. There is really nothing to say about the service. The place is ridiculously packed of course because this place is fairly new and are known for their burgers. Next time I come here, I'll definitely be ordering a shackburger or something."}
{"text":"The discussion of the best burger chains is out there, and I would definitely keep Shake Shake in that conversation. There isn't one in my town, so when we saw it in Vegas, we said let's see what the hype is about. Got tge double shake shack burger and cheese fries, with a chocolate malt shake. The wait for the food to come out wasn't very long, and they had plenty of seating at this location on the strip near New York New York, but was definitely filling up. I liked the crinkle cut fries, but I wish there was a little more cheese sauce. The burger itself was hot, juicy, and slightly greasy which I didn't mind, i was hungry. The chocolate malt was thick and tasty. I definitely liked the food, more so than Five Guys and on par with Fatburger. Would I say it's better than In n Out? Not quite, but it's different. The fries for sure I liked better, but that's just me. In n Out has fresher, thick slices of tomato and lettuce so it's definitely based on preference."}
{"text":"While in Vegas...you must stop and eat as much as you can. However I suggest you stop for the Shroom burger and Chick 'n' Shake at the Shake Shack. They both were the bomb!! Drunk or sober they will taste good! I wasn't even that hungry and I ended up eating both sandwiches! I couldn't control myself with food tasting this good! 

The Shroom burger is a crisp fried portobello topped with Munster cheese and cheddar cheese. On a potato bun with lettuce, tomato, and Shake Shack sauce. So good! 

I also ended up eating the Chick 'n' Shake which was a crispy chicken breast with pickles, lettuce and buttermilk herb mayonnaise. So darn good! Since the girls I was with were drunk and not hungry I ended a eating both sandwiches. So not my fault! 

I didn't really care for the crinkle fries but then again I like skinny fries. The thinner the better, and no I'm not talking about me! I'm not big on fries in general, I'd rather have a donut. 

The Shake was just ok but maybe I needed to try a different flavor. I think we got a vanilla one. 

While in Sin city calories don't count so stop in and eat your heart out!"}
{"text":"Love this place! 

Food: I had the Smoke shack double burger and French fries with strawberry and chocolate shakes.  This place reminds me of In N Out back in California. The price is a little bit more expensive since you have to buy each item separately. I enjoy it whenever I am in Las Vegas visiting.

Service: Nothing crazy, normal routine and the people at the counter help you decide if you can't really make up your mind. Food comes out on a timely manner. 

Ambiance: The place is cool. Super chill nothing to crazy."}
{"text":"This is the one of best burger shops I've ever had. I love McDonald's Fish-o-Filet, Wendy's Bacon Cheese Burger, Burger King's Whopper.  But Shake Shack 's got its own taste.

Don't exactly know how they make it but their well-done beef burger is so juicy and tastes just great!

Their customer services are very friendly and I'd rate them \"the excellent.\""}
{"text":"Yay Shake Shack is in AZ! I tried it in Chicago back in 2014 and it was an experience. I'm really excited for the Kierland one to open near my house, later this year. Anyways, someone provided a helpful tip on this page to park in the garage and take the elevator up (we took the escalator) and it was right at the end of the wing. The line was out the door around noon today and I placed my order at 12:23, took 10 minutes until my food was ready. I ordered chicken shack burgers, a single shack burger, and a shroom burger. I also ordered fries with cheese on the side and the Dust Devil concrete with added chocolate chunks. The latter two are the winners in my book! That cheese sauce is something else, and the mix of flavors in the frozen custard worked well together. 

Really great customer service, one of the employees gave us samples of the custard while we waited in line. My big order was executed correctly and the to-go bags were easy to carry away. Lots of seating and in a good location at the end of the mall, next to the outside parking lot and Thirsty Lion. I want to try some of their shakes so maybe next time.

Definitely on the pricier side for fast food, but my mom remarked on how good the chicken was and the experience makes it all worth it. They have calories listed next to each item but don't pay attention to those."}
{"text":"I think I'm over the Shroom burger, but I give the service, cheese fries, and custard all the stars. This location is nice and open, easy to get to and plenty of parking.  I'm still waiting for the Kierland location to open near my house, but this one is central to many who live and work downtown. Short wait for your food, check them out."}
{"text":"Ok I may be biased but I tried out Shake Shack to compare it to In N Out. Came mid afternoon and luckily the line was just inside. We grabbed a table outside relatively quickly. We ordered a chicken sandwich and 2 regular cheeseburgers plus an order of fries. One burger had no sauce and tomatoes due to a food intolerance. Also included were two arnold palmer and a custard. The food was good but In N Out is better. The meat and bun ratio is off, the fries aren't fresh like In N Out and the custard was thick but still reminded me of ice cream. At least the design had a nice modern feel."}
{"text":"Taste good but pricy. I like in o out more.
I ordered shake burger and fries. Burger is a little small but tasty. I like the bun. Cheese. 
Fries are wavy ones. I like thin and crispy one so not my favorite.
The place was pretty busy and had long line but the operation was efficient and I didn't wait for long.
It costs a little less than $10 for only burger and fries."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. An upscale Five Guys. If you are at Fashion Square you can do better. Even in the food court."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite fast food burger joint! I came here for the first time (June/EDC week 2015) line was pretty long considering this is one of Vegas's busiest time of year since everyone visiting is attending the huge music festival. But on the bright side, the wait goes by pretty quick.

I tried the smoke house burger , cheese fries, and regular fries the first time. Everything was sooooo good! The quality of the patty, vegetables, and cheese tastes fresh. And the fries were golden crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. They serve crinkle cut fries, btw. Which kinds of sets them aside from other burger joints. 

Everything was so good that I had to stop by again before heading back home to Seattle! Craving it as I'm writing this review, I hope one opens up in Washington sometime soon!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic for lunch! It also has great shakes! The interior is modern and the food is tasty. The outside is shaded and very spacious. The scenery very cute. They also check in with you to see if you are doing okay. My only complaint is that sometimes they put too much Shack Sauce (I think that's what it's called). I couldn't really enjoy my burger with all the sauce on it. I came here with a friend and sauce was dripping from hers! Other then that, this place is nice. There is also something for your dog so they won't be hungry! They have the Pooch-ini with vanilla custard with a Shackburger dog biscuit with peanut butter sauce. I recommend the Smokeshack, which is a great burger to me. It has a nice amount of bacon with a bit of spice in it. Very good. I recommend this place to people who love the taste of a good burger!"}
{"text":"What did I miss?  I didn't have the time to wait in line for SS in NYC so glad to see this added on my side of town. Great vibe and atmosphere.  It was all good until the food came. The two tiny burgers I ordered, fries, soda, and a fifty-fifty (poor Arnold Palmer). $22. Seriously? I should have tried the milkshake but for $7, they'd need to offer financing for the happy meal sized portions. Burgers, aside from small, were unremarkable.  Wait, not true, the Shake Sauce was weird (just my taste) but the fries were funky tasting. Neighboring table agreed.  On the upside, the really friendly young lady offered to clear our table and refill our drinks. Kudos for the unexpected service."}
{"text":"Holy SALTOLY! Came here on lunch break walked it and it smells so good. Clean environment although very loud. Ordered our food easy process. Well we received our food and what a huge disappointment super small burger thin thin patty and super super salty like beyond way to much salt!! The fries tasted like overly frozen cooled in bad grease. I'm sorry but this place is awful. I would never return here."}
{"text":"Tried shake shack in Vegas on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Line moved fairly quickly. We ordered 2 shack burgers and fries. We were given a buzzer and we went to find a seat. The place was very busy, but we were able to find a seat. Tables and dining area were relatively clean (taking into consideration how busy it was). Our buzzer went off and I picked our order up at the counter. Food was hot and looked good. The veggies, beef and cheese were all good. The bun was ok, I know others rave about it, but it wasn't my favorite. The shack sauce to me was just a color tinted mayo - didn't lend much flavor. Fries were good. Overall I wish we could give half stars - I would give a 3.5 and would go back - just wouldn't go out of my way or choose it over some other burgers."}
{"text":"Yum... my burger and fries were great. Not too badly priced for being right on the strip."}
{"text":"1st Shake Shack on the west coast. Do I dare say it?
I just might like it better then In N Out."}
{"text":"I love shake shack!
Whenever I am craving a great burger, SHAKE SHACK is my go to burger place. I love that this location is close by my house, and I don't have to go to the one off of Las Vegas Blvd to get a good burger.

This location has a lot of indoor and outdoor seating, so this place can be packed and you will still have your own little space inside or out. I love the cheese fries and I love that my food is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Its good, dont get me wrong but the hype around this place is just a little much as are the prices. After all, this is not NYC.

I give them credit for tying into local business via the desserts and craft beers they offer. I had the cheeseburger with the mushroom burger on it and would completely order it again if I was to go back. If i do, I wont be waiting in line again. The buger mushroom is stuffed with cheese then breaded and deep friend. The cheese fries were decent. But overall the price for a meal (burger, fries and a soda) was too high for what they serve. Afterall its not Kobe beef they are serving."}
{"text":"We wandered over to Shake Shack after watching a show across the street from the NYNY hotel.  The restaurant is located on the ground level.  Luckily, there wasn't a line at 9:30 pm.  The menu is quite large and it can be hard to choose from all the goodies.  I ordered a single ShackBurger and a small Abita root beer.  After paying, I was handed a pager and we went to secure a table.  The only table available was close to the entrance where the cold wind would blow in as people came and went. 

After a short wait, our food was ready for pick up at the counter.  The burger was delicious.  Each bite was better than the last.  The ShackSauce was savory with an umami note.  The Abita root beer was really tasty.  It's made with Louisiana cane sugar and spring water in Louisiana.  I would try other items on the menu next time I get to visit but since we had eaten earlier in the evening, I only wanted a late night snack.  Shake Shack is the real deal."}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

I am a believer in Shake Shack.  Maybe it's the melted cheese that you can dip into with fries that has my love, but whatever it is Shake Shack is one of my to gos if I want a more expensive burger. I've only gotten the cheeseburger, but it hasn't disappointed yet. The sauce can be a little on the spicy side so I would definitely recommend no sauce for the littles.  The fries is pretty good alone but you need to get the cheese sauce to dip it in. It's probably not the healthiest, but I like any type of melty cheese that you can dip into. Overall, I like Shake Shack. The price is a bit more expensive but it can be worth it depending on what you like. If you are a hungry hippo, it may just take you 2 orders of a burger to get you full."}
{"text":"The best way to experience Las Vegas food is just go to the small cheaper chains.  You're better off saving your money from spending it at the expensive buffets.  

We came here after a long day of drinking at the pool parties.  This was a great way to let loose.  It is by no means healthy, but if you've left the pool party no one else left to impress.  Here in Houston, we still do not yet have a our first Shake Shack, so we still crave it how we used to chase down In N Out.  I always get the mushroom with their cheeseburger, it's the only way to go.  I actually got their cookies and cream shake and was disappointed.  Hopdoddy reigns supreme for that.  As far as their fries, just get the plain fries, don't get the superloaded ones, they are ruined by the tiny cut peppers."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, fast prep. had the single Shackburger & the Camelshack concrete. Good burger, should have did the double! The concrete was delicious!, although I thought it would be served in a shake cup and bigger for the price.
Will be sure to go back for another round + fries!"}
{"text":"I wish they had a Shake Shack in my neighborhood because this was the best burger and shake I've EVER had. The staff was super friendly and the restaurant was clean and well organized, absolutely in love!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. The fries were dried out. I prefer frozen crinkle fries over these. 
The burger was very tender and juicy. The texture reminded me of a thicker smash burger. I did not like how red it was throughout. I wish I would have known so I could have ordered it well done. There were a few bites I didn't eat because of how red they were. 
The bun is too soft and gets soggy from the hamburger juice. 
Overall I think it's overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Prices way to high for these burgers. Tasted the same as steak&shake. 

Not memorable to continue going to."}
{"text":"If you've never had Shake Shack you're definitely missing out on one of the best cheeseburgers you'll ever have. It is one of the most tasty juicy burger I've ever had. Highly recommend this place to EVERYONE."}
{"text":"The burgers were so good. It is a bit pricey but the meat is good quality. The manager that was there during our visit was very friendly and checked in on us, offered to get our refills and helped customers throw away their trash. It was good food and great customer service."}
{"text":"It has been about a month since I left Vegas and I still cannot stop talking about Shake Shack. After coming home and returning to the In-n-Out down the street from my home in California I WISH I could replace it with a Shake Shack instead. 

Although it is a little pricey (compared to In n Out), the quality of the ingredients and taste are sooooooo worth it. Who knew a simple burger and fries could be so mouthwatering?

I came here twice during my vacation and know it is going to be my first stop when I return to Vegas. You know how some people are obsessed with eating at Earl's Sandwiches? Well, my love for Shake Shack is similar to that, but better."}
{"text":"One star enough just for the logo , otherwise the burgers aren't worth to spend your money on it . I'm angry cuz It cost more and taste like Macdonalds"}
{"text":"So I've finally had the pleasure of indulging in the coveted Shake Shack!  This particular location is very open, plenty of seating throughout.  There is plenty on the menu to choose from so your appetite should be satisfied.  I did not try the hot dogs (although it did look tasty) but went with the \"smoke shack\" burger.  This is a cheeseburger with applewood smoked bacon.  It also has cherry peppers to add to the depth of flavor.  I'm not sure what type of bun they use but it goes perfect with it!

The only thing I really didn't care for is the \"shake sauce\".  I'd much prefer the \"other\" popular burger place sauce.  

Ps.  Did I mention they serve beer and wine!!!!"}
{"text":"First timer tonight, and I was impressed. I am allergic to the protein in beef, and pork so I obviously wasn't coming for the burgers. I have had a million chicken sandwiches, and turkey in every way possible, and they all usually taste the same...eh! I ordered the Chicken Shack, and it was excellent! The buttermilk/mayo combo sauce was what really made it special. It was put together in the proper order, and the bun was excellent. The crispness was just perfect. I added some of the hot sauce that was available (Louisiana hot sauce) and it was perfection. There was a guy who was answering questions and handing out menus while we were waiting in line...and he was so nice, polite, funny, and an asset to the Shake Shack company. I didn't catch his name, but he was working March 9th, 2016 at approx the 7:00p.m hour. Keep him. I will definitely be back. Im eager to try the custard, which I hear is excellent ( recommended by the guy with the menus) Yay, welcome to Arizona. :)"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday around 1:00pm and the line wasn't too crazy.  I came here with 8 girls and we stood in line for about 20 minutes, which is fairly reasonable.  You order your food, grab the buzzer and find a seat.  The only problem about this place is there is such a high demand for these delicious burgers but there are hardly any seats since the place is always so packed.  Luckily, I was scoping out the place and found some seats right outside of the restaurant down the stairs so we were in the warm sun!

I wasn't too hungry so my friend and I shared the chicken sandwich, which was very crispy, juicy, and tender.  Lots of good flavor.  I also tried a bite of the shake stack and it was delicious but I can never compare to In n Out.  They will always be my number one.  Im glad they opened one up in LA so I don't have to drive 4 hours to get the burgers!  The fries were also delicious!  Ask for their sauce and dip away!!"}
{"text":"The burger had very good flavor.  The crinkle cut fries were nothing special.  The shake was pretty good.  All this for $16 was just not a good value in my opinion.  I would not make this the first place I think of to grab a lunch."}
{"text":"This place is kinda pricey for just a burger, but I don't have a problem spending $10 on a burger that was that good. I got the double BBQ burger and it was da bomb! The concrete I had was their \"shack attack\" and wasn't the best and had some flavor of mint and will try something else next time but all in all, food was pricey, but good!"}
{"text":"First time trying Shake Shack when I was out in Vegas and it was worth it! Had the SmokeShack and the cheese was melted just right on the burger. It has a different taste then other normal burger joints, meat patty was flavorful with the sweet bun. Also, tried the cheese fries...the crinkle-cut fries were ok, but the hot melted cheese on top of it made it better. 

Only downside is on a busy day good luck trying to find a seat. Once you go up and order, you're on your own to find a seat/table. It took us about 15 minutes to find a table of 3, AND we had to share with two other people. Let's hope your food comes out after you find a table. :)"}
{"text":"Awesome shakes and floats. Traditional cheese fries were great. Burgers were awesome. Only recommendation is to use a different bun-it was a lil spongy"}
{"text":"A lot of people try to compare this place with In N out. IMO shack shack is good for 1 day and get tired of it but In N Out i could eat there several times in a week. This place could really break the bank. 

I spent around $27.00. I got a smoke shack, stack shack, and a chocolate mint shake. I always get tounge twisted  with the burgers. The stack shack has a fried portebello mushroom with a single burger. I got the double smoke shack. The smoke comes with two burgers on top of delicous bacon. The shake was ok.

Overall you should check this place out. There are also chiken burgers, hot dogs, cheese fries, and many different types of shakes. If your in vegas just swing by because its worth it."}
{"text":"I love burgers. Who doesn't? Us Americans are proud of this American staple and rightly so. According to the statistics, Americans eat 3 burgers a week, that's a total of 50 billion burgers a year. That's right, fifty billion. 

Why are Americans so obsessed with a hamburger patty between two buns? Well, you don't have to go far to figure this out. Just read through the reviews on yelp or articles naming the 10 best burger places. The single common denominator is there is no one reason, everyone has their own opinion as to why or how they prefer their burger. 

As for me, I've had my share of burgers. I may not eat the average 3 burgers a week, but I know what I like, similar to the billions of burger consumers out there in this world. 

Which brings me to Shake Shack. Since this New York burger joint has gone public, there has been a lot more buzz surrounding it's burgers. They serve more than just burgers, such as hot dogs, but their core business is burgers. They also have some pretty good shakes I hear made with custard ice cream. 

Their only location on the west is Las Vegas, but I hear they plan to expand into the LA market in 2016. Fortunately, I happen to be in Vegas for my brother's wedding and took the opportunity to see if this was a burger I would be willing to add to my burger diet. 

First thing I noticed when I walked into the Shack was how many offerings they had on the menu. In addition to their burger options, there was a section for shakes and custard ice cream, as well as alcohol which included beer and wine. 

I wasn't interested in the other distractions, I was focused on their burgers. I ordered the double with cheese. This comes with two decent size patties, tomato, one leaf of lettuce, soft bun, and their shack sauce. Onions are not included. 

The size of the patties caught me off guard. They were bigger than I expected and a bit greasy. The paper for which the burger was wrapped in was soaked in grease. The patties had a nice outer crust. The shack sauce was nowhere to be found. I couldn't tell you whether or not I liked it because the flavor was missing. I did like the soft bun, but would have preferred it toasted. All in all, I thought the burger was okay, but a bit pricey. 

The fries were good. I like the wrinkle shape and it the crispiness. They also have a cheese add on option. 

I'm not sure if they offer refills on the drinks as there weren't any self serve drink stations. 

For burger, fries, and small drink, it costs $14. This definitely isn't something I would eat on a regular basis given it's price point, but something I would eat occasionally."}
{"text":"It used to be Fatburger was my favorite burger joint (but it isn't like I eat burgers all the time, either, I must mention, to clarify), but this one is the real deal. The meat (100% angus, hormone & antibiotic free) is the main event here. It is tender, juicy, and it's responsibly-sourced (A + in my book, as I am becoming aware of real foods and nutrition as a whole, so I am trying to eat better, but it's a process...).

We've been here a few times, and the average cost for us (family of three) to enjoy a yummy lunch is about $25 (hubby says it's pricey, but I don't mind it when it's this delicious; this is quality over quantity). Our most recent lunch this past saturday, was three burgers (all different types), one order of fries, and one drink. I had to pace myself and not rush into eating my burger (savor, MMM). It was perfect. The shake shack sauce was a standout too. The non-GMO buns are soft, pillowy. Usually our son gets the all-beef hotdog, but he wanted a crabby-patty (Sponge Bob speak). He finished it, but first he was grubbing on the fries. (I don't usually like crinkle fries because they tend to be soggy and oil-soaked, but not these ones, which were crispy.) He is a carnivore (always wants more meat), though, and he finished his burger, bun and all. It is a good thing when we can get our picky son to eat something and finish it without saying \"I'll finish it tomorrow\" or \"Let's bring it home.\"  

The lunch rush equals busy parking lots nearby, so we had to stalk someone leaving, and we got lucky. The line to order was very long (almost to the front door), but it went fast (you order and pay at the front). All the outside seating on a beautiful sunny day was taken! Inside was a different story, surprisingly, many tables were free. Like all venues in LV when it gets warm outside, inside temps are very cool. The staff is extremely nice and helpful, and while there isn't table service, they clear your table and check in with you and your meal, on the taste of your food. The bathrooms are clean. 

I should also mention that a location is opening soon at The District in Henderson."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat at Shake Shake ever since I saw a long-winding line in some park in NYC that I didn't have time to stand in. Thankfully, at this location, there was no line and I was greeted with a warm smile and excellent customer service! I had lunch here and arrived just before the rush. The menu is straight-forward albeit the prices are yes, a bit on the high end. It the quality of the food you are paying for. You are handed a buzzer and before you know it, it is buzzing! Your food is ready!

I got a ShackBurger (no tomato because I hate tomatoes), cheese fries, and a fifty/fifty. First off, the cheeseburger was delicious. The potato roll was pillowy soft. The patty was smashed and cooked the way I like it. The cheese was perfectly melted. The shacksauce complemented the burger nicely. The lettuce leaf was the right size and didn't overwhelm the burger. My only complaint is that it is a bit on the small size. I am sure that I am at fault of being used to American super-size portions. However, it was so good that I didn't want my burger experience to end so quickly. I probably should have gotten the double. I have no doubt that I could have eaten another burger if I had not ordered fries. I'll give the ShackBurger an A-.

The cheese fries has an American cheese sauce that was on point. The only problem I had with it was that I found a hair in mine! I brought it back to the counter and was quickly given a new batch of cheese fries along with profuse apologies. I think because of it, they gave me extra cheese. The fries are crinkle cut, a classic choice to go with the burger. Although I don't eat ketchup (again, the tomato thing), I imagine these hold the ketchup well. They hold the cheese well. It was cheesy, melty goodness. They were nice and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Basically, just how fries are supposed to be. They get a B+ for me (because of the hair situation).

The drink was spot-on. I love Arnold Palmers. This one was delicious. A sweet, older employee even came by my table, saw that my drink was empty, and offered to get me a refill. You don't get service like that everyday. Just for that alone, the AP gets a A+.

I really shouldn't have but I got dessert. I tried a PB toffee crunch concrete. The concrete is a frozen custard base with mix-ins. This one had toffee bars, pb sauce, marshmallow sauce, and malt powder. It was really rich and sweet. This was definitely one of those I-really-shouldn't-have-but-glad-I-did decisions. I give it a B+ because I wish there was more PB swirls and more malt taste.

Overall, I really enjoyed my 1st Shake Shack experience. It was very clean and spacious with plenty of seating options: booths, tables, bar height stools/tables. There is even a foosball table. I look forward to my next visit! I think I'll try a root beer float with the Albita draft root beer."}
{"text":"I've been to Shake Shack once before in Brooklyn . It's was OK and NOTHING compared to In n Out! 

We decided to stop here to get a quick bite to eat on a Saturday night. It's located outside the NYNY. Indoor / outdoor seating . Inside was somewhat clean. Pedestrian only access. 

Line was somewhat long so instead of waiting in line , I decided to order online via the Shake Shack app. I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and fries. The app was easy to use . After approximately 20 minutes , I received a notification that my food was ready. 

I walked to the pick up area and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....for approximately 15 minutes until my order was finally called. The lady working the pick up area was kind of rude and you could tell she was a little overwhelmed . 

My meal was nothing special. Not hot and the taste was just like any ole fast food joint . 

No offense , but I'll probably never come back to a Shake Shack as long as I don't have to."}
{"text":"T'was our first time to ye old Shake Shack and a good experience we had!

I had ordered the Shroom Burger, understood that it was the vegetarian burger on the menu but did not realize that it was a huge (from what I could tell) portabella mushroom, breaded and that had acted as the \"meat patty\". I have to say that it has got to be the best veggie burger that I've had in town. The El Cortez Café used to have a BOMB.com veggie burger but they have removed it from the menu- BOO El Cortez, BOO!!!

The restaurant has modern décor, the staff is insanely friendly and from what i can tell, they keep the place pretty clean! They also have a ping pong table out front and while it's still not too hot outside (when the sun isn't out) you may find me out there. Just kidding, I don't play ping pong. 

The Gist: If I'm here, I'll order the Shroom Burger bc, YUM!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the shack stack, the shack burger, crinkle cut fries, and the shack cago dog. For the most part, everything was amazing. Quality, cleanliness, and quick lines. The burgers were moist with melted cheese and juicy patties. The cago dog was also amazing, and the crinkle cut fries had just the right amount of crispiness as well. But only giving this place 3 stars for how tiny the portions are for the high price you pay. I paid more than $10 for a tiny burger with a Portobello mushroom wedged inside. I feel more satisfied and full after a $3-$4 In-N-Out burger, and the food comes out much quicker. Our food came out decently quick, but the cago dog took too long. The shack burger had quite a wait too for the most original thing you can order on the menu. Would I come here again? Sure! Would I come here again if there was an In-N-Out nearby? Probably not."}

Service: 5/5

Decor & Style: 5/5

I really enjoy the Vegas location more even so than the New York location. Same great food, Brooklyn Beer, and the wait isn't freaking long like in Madison Square Park. Spacious, and fast service."}
{"text":"Shake Shack lives up to the hype! I had a bacon cheeseburger and a vanilla shake, with shack fries.. Only downer, $18 bucks.. A bit over priced for a burger and fries.. After all this is CLT not NYC.."}
{"text":"Food was great! Probably one of the best burger places I've been to. I'd give it a 5 star, but the girl at the counter sending out the orders was both rude and unprofessional. After messing up my order, I came back to the counter and she accused me of \"trying to play a game\" on her. She failed to get it correct a second time, I came back and she rolled her eyes at me and said \"Can't you see I'm busy?\" NEVER have I been so disrespected by someone serving me, especially since I make it a point to always treat others the way I'd like to be treated. It's very disappointing to see that this location has an employee like this representing their establishment. Overall, great food. Definitely don't miss it. Hopefully this review will help management take proactive action in improving customer service."}
{"text":"First heard about Shake Shack while in New York 2 years ago and I finally got to try it in Vegas, of all places.

Stopped by just after the lunch hour on a Saturday.  Place was pretty busy with football games playing on all the tvs.  We went to stand in line to place our order.  Line moved quickly and we were able to find a seat at one of the communal tables.

The burgers took a bit longer than a typical fast food joint.  They give you a buzzer and you get up and pick up the tray at the counter.  Even though the buzzer went off, it still took an additional few minutes to get our tray.  

So my thoughts on the ShackBurger?  Pretty damn good.  Its a pretty typical smaller cheeseburger w/lettuce, tomato and then there's that ShackSauce.  That's what makes the burger.  Don't know what's in it, but I could see myself craving it.  

Cheddar Bacon Fries-Another standard favorite, but the fries were crispy and the cheese and bacon were better quality.

Glad they have a couple of these in LA, because I will need to make a repeat visit."}
{"text":"QUICK SUMMARY: Overpriced Innout burgers that were worth the price at the NYC locations I've been to, but not worth it here. If you're already here, order a Concrete. 

What happened Shake Shack? The Vegas location was all disappointment and nothing like what I've had in the past. After trying a Shake Shack in NYC I fell in love. You know that high definition TV inside that shows you really glamorous images of Shake Shacks around the world? That was exactly how it felt in NYC. There restaurant was elegant, the customers were all beautiful and everyone was happy and friendly. Vegas felt like a typical fast food hamburger joint with a nice attempt at being more, but nonetheless fell short. The staff behind the counter seemed annoyed at indecisive customers and the amount of time it was taking for them to place their orders (Yes, I know it was CES week and I'm sure none of the customers in line had been to a Shake Shack before and probably spoke English as a second language, but it's no excuse to be rude). 
I don't know what I did to deserve it, but my hamburger came out FLAT. I wish I had taken a picture (the fact that I didn't take a picture meant it was really not Instagram worthy). It was as if someone squished my burger after it came together. 
The fries were good- crispy and on the salt-less side. A+ for those. 
I hope the new Summerlin location is better, because the LV Blvd location needs some work. See you in NYC Shake Shack! Vegas did not do you justice."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is better than In and Out Burger. I said it. 

I know the two are very similar and often compared so I checked out the new joint at NYNY. The line moves quickly and you can pick from the large menu that is right in front of you. 

I went big and got a burger, fries and a shake. 

The burger was less sloppy and more tasty than In and Out, the fries are great and crinkle cut which is my favorite type and the shake was very good (got peanut butter). Overall it was a great experience and I'd totally go back again. 

Obviously this is not a typical McDonalds-like joint and the prices are elevated. The shake definitely could have been cheaper. 

Service was very good and friendly. 

Overall though, 

Five *****"}
{"text":"Sorry guys, but this place was not good. Like legit sucked. I'll keep it short. Here's why.

We get there on a Tuesday night so it wasn't that bad of a wait. Ordered our food...2 burgers, 2 fries and 2 Tenaya Creek hefs...$40. Ok fine, it's in a casino. Jacked up prices are expected. We get our food and right when I unwrapped my burger, it's already an oily mess. Seriously?!? I JUST unwrapped it and it's already gross. Bun is soggy, oil is dripping everywhere...just a big disappointment. I get to the middle of my burger patties and its raw. Like straight red. I had to break the raw pieces off so I wouldn't get sick. I ordered bacon in my burger but didn't get to enjoy the crispness of it because it got soft from all the grease of the patties. When I got towards the end of my burger, it was falling apart and there was a big puddle of oil where my napkins were. I was just so upset that I couldn't even finish it and just threw it back on the tray. I was actually pissed off that my bf had paid $40 for this crap. I haven't been angry over a meal in such a long time. The only saving grace and the reason this place gets 2 stars was the delicious crispy fries and beer. 

I definitely won't be back and I'd much rather have In-N-Out to this nonsense. What a waste of a cheat day."}
{"text":"This is the worst burger joint ever. My burger was soggy,fries too salty and customer service was horrible.... If I give no stars I would...."}
{"text":"I heard many rumors that this place was better than In and Out. However, it's not! The establishment is modern and has a nice vibe. The burgers though are just okay and nothing really special about them. Cheese fries are sub par but the lemonade is good."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hub bub is all about. Smallest, most expensive burger I have ever had. Camel Shack concrete was Way Overly salty. Felt good that 5% went to benefit the kids at the Children's Hospital."}
{"text":"The greatest burger I've had!   Seriously I love these burgers!  The bun is amazingly soft and tasty. The BBQ burger has a great flavor that blends together so well with the rest of the items.  We try and stop here every time we are in Vegas. The shakes are great too but we come for the burgers!"}
{"text":"I first tried this place in New York and really enjoyed it. I was happy to find a location in Las Vegas and the shake shack was good as I remembered it in NY. I think I had customized my NY experience with a double patty plus the shroom patty, so it was pretty thick and juicy. I forgot about that until after I had ordered and just got the one cheese burger plus the shroom patty. Still good, but I like that extra meat.  Overall I do enjoy the burgers here, and highly recommend. If your like me, and enjoy more meat on your burger, try ordering the double cheeseburger plus the shroom patty, it's not on the menu. The original in NY used to do it for me, I forgot to try that in this trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Shake Shack when it came to the West Coast. My friends and I came by here after going to the dayclub. There's a huge menu to look at when you're waiting in line, so that's helpful. I ordered the Shack Stack, which is the portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese and a ground beef burger. First of all, the cheese oozing out of the burger is orgasmic. Besides that, the burger itself tasted pretty plain and simple. In that case, I have to admit what I already believed: In-N-Out is better. I have to say that the cheese fries were the best thing here. It's so crispy for crinkle fries and smothered with melted cheese. 

The location has such open space and I liked the picnic tables outside. It's a nice feel being located at New York New York as if you truly have a piece of the East Coast here."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch last week during my trip to Vegas. It was about 11AM on a Friday and there was no line. My first experience was at the one in LA and honestly, I wasn't impressed. That time I ordered a chick'n stack and thought that Chick-Fil-A was a lot better. However this time, I really enjoyed my 'shroom burger. While my favorite part of the sandwich was the really soft bun, the melted cheese inside of the fried mushroom is really what makes it. 

My boyfriend also ordered a single stack, which brought him back to his trip to NYC and we shared an Oreo shake and cheese fries. The cheese fries were good--really crisp and not too salty. The Oreo shake was standard and nothing really to write home about."}
{"text":"Jon is the only reason I did not give five stars. He is the first person you will encounter at the register and he is miserable and rude. I am glad there is one in LA now because when I come back to Phoenix I will not be returning here. Anyway the food was very expensive but it was very good. The fried buttermilk chicken sandwich could put chic fil a out of business if it was cheaper. The bun was soft just a little too much lettuce. Although cheese fries were good they can definitely stand on their own without sauce, I will order plain next time. The lemonade was also tasty. Plenty of seating, chill decor, and outside seating."}
{"text":"So glad they have a SS in Vegas. Even though we have one in LA I still will come here when in town. The line is always out the door, but they move pretty quick here. My favorite here is their chicken sandwich and cheese fries, a must try. They have indoor and outdoor seating, for people watching. It is a perfect location."}
{"text":"Shake Shack took me for a loop. Their take on the 100% juicy angus beef and non GMO potato fries didn't seem like it was worth the wait. For 4 burgers with 2 fries and a 2 shakes and an iced tea the bill added up to a total of $54. I liked their shakes but that's pretty much it. Crinkle fries were a bit soggy. From the scale of 1-10 I give it a 7. In-n-Out is still my-go-to all time fave burger joint. The best bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"After recently writing up a review for the Camelback/Phoenix location based on a memory from a few months ago, I decided to give Shake Shack another try. My girlfriend and I decided to stop by this slightly bigger location while doing some shopping in Kierland.

This time, I decided to order the SmokeShack in a single patty, while my girlfriend ordered the basic ShackBurger. We split an order of regular fries, as well as a small chocolate shake.

In my original review, I discussed how baffled I am at how Shake Shack somehow garnered such a massive following over the years to the point where many of us locals are confused as to what all of the fuss is about.

Let's be real here, people. Their burgers are average at best in comparison to their competitors. Size is alarmingly small given the price, which is kind of a joke when you can easily obtain burgers elsewhere that are cheaper (and often times better). It's not that it's bad - it just isn't worth their premium prices. Mama might have raised a brat, but she damn sure didn't raise no fool!

Fries are pretty standard and the shake was no different than a chocolate shake from practically any other fast food burger joint. I guess we were expecting something more from a place bold enough to use the term \"shake\" in their title.

For the most part, our opinion remains unchanged. It's not In-N-Out (the prices make that pretty clear). Nor is it a place I'd consider visiting when we have so many great burger joints to pick from.

I'm sorry, Shake Shack, but I just don't get it.

Please don't be mad, okay?"}
{"text":"Like most people, I've been hearing about Shake Shack for years. The New York City-based chain is what East Coast \"peeps\" proudly proclaim to be \"their version\" of In-N-Out. 

Unfortunately, they don't have In-N-Out in New York - so I'm not entirely sure they understand what they're comparing it against. And that's probably what has gotten Shake Shack in trouble with a lot of newcomers. Its loyal fans are grossly overselling it way, way too hard to the point where everyones' expectations have become completely unrealistic.

Despite this, I'm still quite fascinated by the fact that reviews for Shake Shack aren't quite as high as I had originally anticipated. Honestly, I think the corporate suits underestimated the intelligence of their target demographic. Sure, people today are more than willing to pay a little extra for a burger if the quality (and source) are of a high standard - but there's a fine-line between charging a premium for quality and charging a premium just to be greedy. And I'm convinced that this is one of the reasons why Shake Shack hasn't been as openly embraced by the locals like I thought they would be.

We've only visited here once, ordering a couple of single patty burgers with both cheese fries and regulars. I even threw in a \"Bag O' Bones\" for my chihuahua, which come directly from Bocce's Bakery.  

Honestly, neither one of us thought the burgers were too bad. I mean, they were by no means the best thing I've ever sunk my teeth into, but they were still respectable. So, what's the problem, you ask? I think people are a little shocked about the smaller size, which doesn't really correlate to their asking prices. Who the hell knows? 

At some point, we will pay a return visit, because I'm still trying to figure out just precisely why this place (at least in New York) garnered such a massive cult following. But after one meal, I still feel that In-N-Out is a far superior choice for a fast food burger. And after reading a lot of reviews, it sounds like I'm not alone in saying this.

Give them a try at least."}
{"text":"The bacon cheese fries are amazing.  The bacon burger was ok but it's was smaller than expected.  But the fries were just perfect.  So good my friends went up to get more.   Prices were a little high.  Just for me it was $15.00."}
{"text":"I'm about as loyal to In-n-Out as they come.  So naturally, I feel like I am committing some form of infidelity by writing this review.  The burger was exceptional.  I have tried the Shack Burger and the Smoke Shack.  My wife had their shroom burger.  We have been back 4 times.  

Notably, we are from Southern California and don't gamble.  So yes, I have craved the Shack bad enough to drive 3.5 hours, enjoy the Shack, and turn around and drive another 3.5 hours.  The burger is juicy and tender, the toppings are always fresh (a bi-product of quality selection and high-turnover), and the bun is an excellent choice.

Four things to know if you are thinking about going:

1) The line can be exceptionally long.  Honestly, I am always impressed with how fast they move the line.  I cannot complain, but some people need instant burger gratification.  This may not be the place (but by that token maybe avoid In-n-Out too).  

2) The fries are crinkle cut and plain.  It feels a little odd to have such a dressed up well-planned (and executed) burger and then a small tray of crinkles next to it.  I personally am fine with it because they have always been cooked perfectly and seasoned well, but this may turn some people off. 

3)  The burgers are somewhat simple.  Some of their burgers are a little more intricate, but for the most part they are pretty standard.  That said, they take the simple and make each ingredient as spectacular as possible.  The way they \"dress up\" their burgers is to elevate each ingredient individually.  

4) Finally, the price is a little steeper than some other chains.  Everything is served a la carte, so it ends up being around $15 a person for a burger, fries, and drink.  I personally would take this restaurant over any of the \"sit-down\" chains in the price range like Chilis or Red Robin.  I don't have a problem for this reason.  If you are looking for a better costing option - I can't reccomend the In-n-Out across Interstate 15 enough."}
{"text":"Prices were fair for strip location.  Burger was good, not great, but good.  Reminded me of Wendys, but better.  Shake was ok as were fries.  Not the best in town, but it was fun to try it and great location.  Staff was nice.  Fun time."}
{"text":"pretty gooood especially the cheese fries, stays crispy"}
{"text":"Not the best burger you're going to eat. Don't get me wrong, still worth a visit, especially for the hot dogs & milkshakes (which are the roots of the franchise apparently). The chicken dog is particularly excellent. The much hyped burgers I've never found to be as good as other places; the patty is too thin for my liking. There's absolutely no vegetarian options which I think is a shortsighted as well. Overall, definitely worth a visit but I'll be giving the burgers a pass next time."}
{"text":"I love shake shack, so stop asking. If I see one when I'm an anywhere, I will go. Spicy chicken, double cheeseburger, Chili anything. Sooooo good."}
{"text":"First time coming... Amazing mgt, great burgers. Love simple yet aggressive menu, and the lemonade is awesome."}
{"text":"This place was great! Awesome burger, fries were good and the custard desert was delicious. I can see what the hype was all about. A must do when in Vegas and looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Word is out on how popular this location is on the east coast which made it an exciting destination to dine at when visiting Vegas as they just opened this location recently. The atmosphere is great, guest service up to par, the decor inviting and clean. The food on the other hand is far over priced for what you receive. $5.19 for a standard single shake burger which seems much smaller than it should be.

The marketing of this restaurant appears to be following the latest hip trend of serving your food to you on an aluminum sheet and simple, trendy decor. The latest Taco Bell concept called US Taco in Huntington Beach CA followed the same model with little success.

Final verdict for Shake Shack to me is, stick to In-n-out."}
{"text":"The burgers are good here.  The service is great and I'd highly recommend the strawberry shake and cheese fries (of course, to share!)."}
{"text":"The Hype is real
Some compare this to In-N-Out, but lets just enjoy the burger without all the comparisons. (Because I live for In-N-Out).
I've had the Shake stack and the shack burger, both were great burgers. 
I really liked the Crisp-fried Portobello shroom inside the Shake Stake, which gives it that extra flavor.
Cheese fries is a must!
The price is a bit high, but it's worth it.
Wait time WILL be long during lunch hours, so get there a bit earlier"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday around Noon & the line was out the door!! We waited for about 20 min before getting to the cashier (there were 4 working at a time) to place our orders. Lotta people were coming & going, so finding a sit-down spot to grub at wasn't so bad. Instead of yelling out numbers, SS gives you a buzzer that will let you know your order is ready for pick up. After placing our orders, we waited another 15-20 min or so to get our food.


:: VENUE/SERVICE ::

Located right outside of the NY NY Hotel. SS is spacious, clean & modern looking. Customer service here exceeded my expectations for a \"fast-food\" joint. There are 2 counters with condiments & water fill station. There were workers that constantly is cleaning, taking trash away for you, asking how you how was the food & etc. The vibe is very positive. 


:: FOOD ::

STRAWBERRY SHAKE   (3.5/5)
- knocked off points due to the price & size. INO is better & more worth it

SMOKE SHACK   (4/5)
- the raw onions were ok. Better if it was w/ grilled or chopped caramelized onions

SHACK STACK   (4/5)
- the crisp-fried Portabello mushroom filled with melted cheese was yummy!

HAMBURGER - PROTEIN STYLE   (2/5)
- Patty seemed a lil tasteless w/o the ShackSauce (in which I had asked for but didn't get) 
- they don't wrap up the burger but instead they place it on a bed of greens
- green leaf lettuce is good but it doesn't offer the crunch like the iceberg lettuce at INO

SS BUNS   (5/5)
Shake Shack uses amazing soft buns (Martin's potato roll, toasted in butter) that's hinged to keep the everything in place in prevention of a burger backslide.  Mmmm the butter!!


:: OVERALL ::

The burgers are kinda small. Hence for someone like me I had to eat 2 vs just 1 to get my fill. Taste-wise -- it was pretty good (except the Hamburger). Value-wise -- prices are a bit steep. INO has the better advantage on the pricing.  Hmmm... would I come back? Perhaps since it is on the strip & I do want to try their Concrete Dessert."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is one of my favorite burger spots, you can't go wrong with them.  I've had no problems with their service. People are always in and out. Even the one from NYC, that place its always packed, however you don't wait too long and you can always find a place to sit. They can be a little pricey, but they're sooo yummy, you'll be completely satisfied!"}
{"text":"We stayed at Monte Carlo and so it was a really convenient place to grab some food at. During our few day stay, we went here twice. I'm a sucker for the shack stack with the deep fried mushroom and cheese. Their crinkle fries are also pretty good. I had shake shack for the first time in NYC so I was super super excited that they are making their way over towards the west coast. Open one in Seattle please!!! I was pleasantly surprised they also served Stumptown cold brew! Their desserts are also quite excellent. I've had the custard in the past. 

Pretty efficient service - you wait in line, order food, they give you a buzzer that'll vibrate when your food is ready and you pick it up at the counter! Lots of space to eat. They also have misters outside so you can also eat out there. Can't wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"Three strikes and Shake Shack is out. I gave it several tries to see if the first two were flukey bad experiences, but this third one seals the deal. It's a tasteless crispy patty burned beyond recognition with a glop of sauce and cheese on a mashed bun that falls apart. All for somewhere between $6-10. I don't understand the hype one bit. East Coast friends who had raved about this place for most of the last decade either have awful taste or must've been talking about somewhere else. Or maybe they never had a burger before. 

Once the hype dies down the Arizona Shake Shack locations will have a tough time competing in a market with much better burgers for much lower prices. Not going back, don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Food was good not great. Price was way too high. Same or better quality at many places within 3 miles for half the price."}
{"text":"This is all I wanted for my bday dinner with my bff. We drove 25 minutes to eat here and i had it once a few years ago in new York . I kept hearing I needed to try the chicken sandwich it did not disappoint I would pick it neck and neck with the original burger. My bff got the fries with cheese and bbq sauce he loved them.  My favorite fires are crinkle cut I would suggest getting them extra crispy. It tasted exactly like I had it in new York"}
{"text":"Loved the shroom burger! Yummy fried Portobello mushroom stuffed with muenster cheese. Kids said burgers are better than 5guys. Fries were good. Kids like smashburger shakes more."}
{"text":"Had to see what all the negative hype was about. This was not at all what I expected. The burger really had no flavor,  5 guys chuck blend tastes way better than this. Took over 10 minutes to get the food even though the place was empty. Hopdoddy and zinburger are still my 2 favorite places in this area. This may be good for shakes, but so is zinburger."}
{"text":"There's no need to have a paragraph after another paragraph of an review for this establishment. Simple, BEST burger in the world!! To all the Californians, the Shack Stack (stuffed w/ muenster cheese portobello mushroom, lightly fried in a cheese burger) surpasses In N Out Double Double by a landslide! Definitely one of the top food I must eat if I was on death row."}
{"text":"The fued continues.  Shake shack vs In N out

Shake shack definitely has great quality in their meat and buns as well as their malt shakes. 

Shake shack has better fries, their malt shakes are no question the better choice. But the choice between which is better burger, it depends who you are. 

If you love meat and cheese. Shake shack has more meat to bun ratio. Their cheese is completely melted and comes oozing out along with the juicy meat. Their burger buns are so soft you taste all meat and cheese. 

In N Out has a more all around burger, not too much meat, not too little lettuce tomato onion, and their bun is toasted. It has more textures when chewing. IN N OUT wins the all around flavor of burger. 

Shake shack takes the better fries and malt shakes. 

In N out takes the win when it comes to value. 

A double shake shack cheeseburger alone was about 8 dollars alone. MALT shake was about 6 dollars alone. If you got fries for another 6 bucks or so, youd be paying 20 a person just about. In N out is about 7 bucks for a whole meal. 

All in all, pricey but a very very good product."}
{"text":"really enjoy this place. The chicken burger is delicious! My boyfriend and i went there got a smoke stack burger, chicken burger, fries and a shake for around $23. Nice date night outing before  a movie! The coffee shake was worth the calories. They also serve beer!"}
{"text":"Okay I ate here twice. First time amazing! I had the same thing again about 6 months later, the burger with roasted peppers and it sucked. So loaded with sauce a peppers my buns was soggy- eew. So consistency may be an issue but at those prices I'm not willing to take that chance again. I'm sticking with #InAndOut!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located on the strip. Parking and getting to the front door can be a little confusing - we asked for directions twice - New York New York has a lot of twists and turns! A few minutes later we'd arrived!

Very short line - we ordered 2 smoke stacks (one a double) an order of regular fries, one order of cheese fries, a small lemonade, and a bottled water.  We got our beeper and began hunting for a table. The short line was deceiving - this place was packed! Eventually we found a table. There's ample amounts of seats but it was very busy (and raining.)

Got the food - great burger. I loved the peppers paired with the lettuce and bacon. Sooo good! The cheese fries - eh. If liquified cheese is your thing, then go for it! Next time we'll just stick with the filtered water on tap, and get shakes instead. 

$2.89 for the small lemonade $2.49 for the bottled water. $3.99 for the cheese fries, $2.99 for the regular fries, $6.99 for the single, and $9.79 for the double burger.. The prices were a bit steep.

I'd definitely come back while in Vegas, because the burgers and shakes are so tasty. Next time I'd visit while walking down the strip to avoid the parking fee (0-60 min free, anything over that ranges from $7-10.) Again, only gripes parking and pricing...I think I'm just too used to in-n-out. Having only been to be NYC locations, I think this is a well executed west coast version."}
{"text":"Great lil burger joint in dt summerlin. Fast and fresh and they have stuff for your pups outside"}
{"text":"Soooo good after a night out! Their bread tastes so fluffy. The meat was scrumptious and the fries went well with the burger. I was so happy to try this and I got the double that made me so full. If you're not that hungry, just get the single. They also have a self serve station and you can even pour yourself some water so you don't have to bug the employees. It was super busy but I got my food like in 5 minutes. Very efficient! Next time I come to Vegas, I'll definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"Great burgers but expensive for what you get.  I dont have a huge appetite but the regular cheeseburger and fries left me still hungry.  I enjoyed the expansive menu options but so far all the extra stuff beyond burgers and fries have been a let down.  In NYC I had an expensive premium coffee milkshake that was forgettable.  In Vegas I tried the Jackpot concrete that was basically Vanilla custard with some 3-4 stale tasting Belgian waffle chunks in it and sprinkles.
As far as In n Out comparison goes, I'll give Shake Shack a slight edge on burgers and huge edge on fries.  But In n Out murders them on bang for buck.  If both In n Out and Shake Shack had equal prices and were available in my backyard, I'd probably visit them equally as often."}
{"text":"Living in California means In-n-Out all the time, but when the opportunity comes, catch me at Shake Shack! I've been here twice, but usually after 12 am. Why? Because there's always a line anytime during the day. If you have a special player's card, you do get a separate line. Perks of being a baller, I guess.

I've tried the single shake burger, the chick'n stack, and fries. The patties are actually decent sized, so I don't feel the need to double up on the meat. The burgers are pretty simple - lettuce, tomato, cheese, and their sauce. If I had to choose between the burger or the chicken, I'd definitely go with the burger. The chick'n stack was $7 and reminded me of Burger King's chicken sandwich. Not worth it. Stick with the burger and fries. The fries can be a hit or miss, but if you do happen to get a fresh batch, they're really good!

Besides the typical burgers, they have so much more options on the menu. Hotdogs, cheese fries, custards, etc. Must make room next time to try the infamous concretes. Can't make my way to New York just yet, but thank goodness LV has not one, but two locations now!"}
{"text":"Hmm, more like 3.5 stars. Definitely not worth the high prices or the long line... But it's a decent burger and pretty good hot dog. Cheese fries were awesome too, shakes were pretty good. 

Will I be back? Yeah"}
{"text":"WOW! Great food and reasonable for the strip. Most food establishments are expensive on the strip, including the fast food joints. But the food here is GREAT and not bad priced. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant is very clean as well."}
{"text":"4stars for Shake Shack. Everything was fine, nothing to complain about here. But we have TONS of great burger joints in Las Vegas, and while everything was very good at Shake Shack, for the money I would prefer Fukuburger, Fatburger or Bobby's Burger Palace.  And I can get an equally excellent burger for much less $$ at In-N-Out."}
{"text":"The child had a burger, fries, and a shake and I had a double with fries and a drink. The buns complimented the burger and the fries were cooked perfectly. The child was a little let down by the shake, but will try a different one the next time. I would eat here again. While everything was hot and fresh and tasted great, I've never paid $10 for a burger. This will definitely be a treat more so than a staple of eating out. Definitely worth it on those occasions, though."}
{"text":"Always wanted to go but there is never one around when I travel.  Finally got to go one in Vegas.  It did not disappoint.  The fries and shake were incredible but the Shack burger with the fried portabello mushroom was the best burger I have ever had.  I would put that on my three to take on a deserted island.  Hope to get back soon."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Loved that they serve alcohol! Priced a tad bit high for burgers, but then again, they are better quality and have more options than a fast food McD or BK joint."}
{"text":"The food is great! Friendly and prompt customer service. I expected larger portions for the price of the meal. For 2 burgers, 2 fries and 2 drinks, the total was roughly $26. Clean restaurant and very nice staff. I will be visiting again in the near future"}
{"text":"We didn't think Shake Shack would be as amazing as everyone says it is, but it is one of our favorite burger places!  Their fries are also delicious.  The first time we were there, I forgot to order gluten free, but they remade my burger for me and were very nice about it (I felt bad that I forgot to say that when ordering).  Also, Anthony (?) printed out a list of all foods at Shake Shack that had potential allergens.  With that said, I got the burger on a gluten free bun without the Shack sauce, and it was still delicious!"}
{"text":"The family loves shake shack. Great burgers, fast and fresh. Awesome shakes and a nice atmosphere. It can get busy but the lines moves quickly."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Shake Shack and was walking along the strip on their Grand Opening day.  Because I saw a short-ish line, I decided to check it out as it's something I've always wanted to check out and I'm glad I did!!

I ordered the Smoked burger (with bacon & cheese) and a half tea/half lemonade drink.  I really enjoyed their bun and I'm not usually one to eat buns out of a burger.  But their bread was nice and soft!!!  The burger was also really really good.  I like the fact that the patty wasn't too salty.  They did, however, overdo it with the peppers on my burger (I definitely do recommend a bit...but they completely overwhelmed my burger with the hot peppers - so much that I had to scoop some out).  Also, that half & half drink is a must try!!! 

Would definitely go back to try something else again!"}
{"text":"This place has a friendly atmosphere and is pet friendly. The shakes are good and fries are delicious. The reason. For my 3 stars and not 5 are the burgers. The smoke shack burger had an overwhelming vinegar taste and the shack burger was bland. I came in here with an unbiased attitude because in n out dominates the west coast but shake shack doesn't compare to the awesomeness that is in n out. Shake shack is also overpriced compared to in n out. Sorry not sorry."}
{"text":"We Americans are a funny group...don't mess with our country or our burgers! East Coast VS West Coast, gosh how did it come to this? The burger bar is set so high nowadays with each new burger joint trying to out do the other. Enjoying a burger is so subjective, it really is all about what you personally like. Its sort of similar to whether you like your margarita with or without salt, there is no right or wrong answer here people!  

I personally am a burger purist and I don't like anything other than the old fashioned Cheeseburger with LTO. Well Shake Shack has officially turned me around. A burger thats topped with a Cheese Stuffed Portobello Mushroom?! WTH?! Just the sound of that makes me cringe but I knew this place came with high accolades so I took a chance and since that fateful day I have never ordered anything but the Shack Stack here. Its juicy, flavorful and it oozes...CHEESE! How fun is oozing cheese you ask? FREAKING FUN! Every bite I was amazed at how enjoyable this burger was and I honestly haven't been this excited for a burger in a long, long time. The saying.. \"Party In My Mouth\" is fitting here. TRY THIS BURGER!

When I first saw the fries I admit I started getting anxious and questioned this decision to walk through NY NY Casino for a burger with Sysco fries. Upon first glance I saw they are the type of fries I was served in school, you know those crinkled and soggy cardboard things the National School Lunch Program passed off as food? Well thankfully they were nothing like the sad sack of fries I was served in high school. These were perfectly and evenly crisped on all sides of the fry. I started chomping away in amazement on how they were able to achieve such an even crisp on all sides of a crinkle cut fry. How did they do it? nom nom...Why has it not been done before? nom nom nom.. This is amazing! I can't believe I'm going to say this... but I like crinkle cut fries now.

We also have enjoyed some of their shakes but my favorite will always be the black and white shake. I think thats where the east coast thing comes in.. I have never had a decent one here in town. Not sure why.. I usually get a puzzled stare when I have ordered one in the past but at Shake Shack I don't have to feel like an weirdo, I fit right in. 

Shake Shack is by far the most talked about burger as of late in a city full of burger joints.  And Shake Shack is definitely a place that will stick around. I recommend going there.. Its that good!"}
{"text":"First time I've had shake shack was in New york, and I only got fries and a shake..........

fast forward 8 years, had another opportunity to try it in Vegas!

Shroom Burger- DELICIOUS. I am not a burger person, so I hardly ever eat burgers. However, my friends wanted to come here so I did. The mushroom was fried well! AND their shake shack sauce! I love it so much, i asked for two more on the side.
Fries- cripsy!
Peanut butter shake- Delicious! so rich and creamy

It was definitely a sodium filled, but deliciously cooked meal!

Line went by fast, service was great, but wished they kept up with the cleanliness of the area!"}
{"text":"The burgers are so small in size and wasn't filling for a lunch. Shakes are average only. The ambience and location is great though!"}
{"text":"Whhhhyy do I live in Canada. Whyyyy. This is my first time trying shake shack.... it was love at first bite.  I've had in n out before and I thought that was good... my god the cheese fries at shake shack are to die for. I've ate 2 portions of fries each time I went and I went here twice in the span of 3 days....

The burgers were good too. I had the milkshake also but that was pretty much standard.  This has become my favourite burger joint."}
{"text":"If you're looking a quick good burger shake shake is your place to go. Make sure you get the cheese sauce If you're getting fries"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas a few weeks back and happy to find this gem of a burger joint that we love in NYC was in Vegas now!

The size of the restaurant is wonderful, unlike the cramped new York locations and the decor is stunning.

There were lots of staff working and our wait was not too long. The buzzer was really cute.

I had the shackmeister and it was sensational. If there weren't so many people in line and our schedule so tight, I would have bought another!

The cheddar fries were tasty and the raspberry lemonade.

So glad this joint is in Vegas and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Hell yeah Shake Shack! That was one of the foodie goals of this Vegas trip. I like to try any competitor that people say is better than In n' Out ... And another one bites the dust.

So first of all it's the 1st week of summer and to get to the shack is having to walk thru the desert heat.. And if you're lucky enough the line isn't too long you're able to stand in line inside and stare at the one huge menu on the wall. 

So the food, I ordered the, Ionno, I forgot but it was like a double burger w/ bacon and a side of cheese fries and a drink. This order ran close to $17? Gotta be honest the first few bites were good but the 2nd half of it went down hill. I think all burgers should have some type of veggies to even out all the grease ur expecting to chow down on. The cheese fries.. That's all it was, a piece of cheese on top of some crinkle cut fries. Pretty weak. And to add more hate how can you mess up a medium soda? It was bland and watered down. 

Well that's it for shake shack.. I won't be back. Next stop White Castle. I'm glad these guys aren't even mentioned towards In n Out."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I was quite disappointed given the hype this place got going in. 

Steak Stack was all the rage with my group so I went with it, and the cheese stuffed portabella was cooked to perfection but I felt guilty as sin eating the deep-fried monstrosity it was. The cheese didn't seem to add anything to the burger and I found it made it too salty and somewhat disgusting towards the end. 

The cheese fries are nothing special, and looks like something you can make at home with some Whiz and freezer fries. Do not get cheese fries if you get the Steak Stack; cheese overload. 

Had the malted caramel shake which was the special shake of the day, but it was again, mediocre. Once again I got the feeling I could make this shake better at home quite easily....it was overly sweet with the flat texture of a McDonald's milkshake. Needed water to choke it down and I left at least 1/3 in there by the time we left. 

Mediocre food plus hiked up prices makes me avoid this place easily on the next trip. You can do better at Vegas, and you should."}
{"text":"Wow reasonable prices on the strip? Ate there waiting for the doors to open for PBR World Finals. Hot Dogs and fries for under  $9.00 and they were actually hot and edible. Probably will revisit when down there."}
{"text":"So goooooood!!! I first had shake shack in Chicago & the line was out the door. SO glad they're quick at this location. 

Their burgers, fries, ice cream & water LOL are delicious!!

For real though, this place is yummy in my tummy. A little pricey for a tiny burger though. But definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I've heard amazing things about the shake shack in NY, but I've never been before! I was excited to try the one in Vegas in New York, New York.

First and foremost - there will probably be a long line, but it moves quickly, and isn't as long as the white castle line.

The burger - was good, but to be honest, I prefer my west coast in-and-out burger a lot better.

The krinkle cut fries were good, but the cheese sauce was too much.

definitely worth checking out if you've never been."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The burgers were really small but had so much flavor.  I'm usually a Whataburger or In N Out guy but this place will be another burger joint to hit up from now on."}
{"text":"Yum! One of my new favorite Burger places in Las Vegas! Long lines, good food. The staff is less than friendly but they do a good job at keeping the line moving and the place clean for as pack as it stays. It's located at The New York New York and its outdoor seating has a view of the *Brooklyn Bridge* and The Strip. Great location for people watching. 

The Burgers are fantastic. Fresh made, fresh veggies and a fresh baked bun! Yum! But the real star of the show are the big fat crinkle style cheese fries! These are my favorite cheese fries in town. Do yourself a favor and order some! 

Love this place! We'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"When in Vegas, this place is a must visit.  It was my son's birthday when we arrived in Vegas and we asked him what he wanted to have for dinner.  His reply, \"I only want a burger and a milkshake.\" Now, mind you, he's only 11 so a burger and a milkshake doesn't require much thinking so we knew we were in the clear of having to go to Gordon Ramsey's (sp?) Burgr restaurant.  Our first and only thought was to go to Shake Shack.  I had never been and had been planning on going on other trips but simply forgot.  Now that we had the time and it was a special occasion, why not.

We ordered the cheeseburgers, bacon cheeseburger, mushroom burger (not the vegetarian one but they do offer the vegetarian option), and of course strawberry and cookies and cream milkshakes and lemonade.  Everything was delicious.  The bacon was so huge it was sticking out of the burger.  The burgers come in medium or well done.  Well done for the kids, Medium for me and the hubby.  It was juicy and delicious and melt in your mouth.  The mushroom burger (actually called the Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce).  The cheese was oozing out of the burger and it just made it that much delicious.  All the flavors came together well and I didn't even need to add anything to it.  The lemonade had the right amount of sour and sweet.  I believe it was freshly made.  Oh and did I forget to mention that the drinks are free refills.  You just need to bring your cup to the counter (you keep the cover and straw) and tell them you want a refill and what you want as the refill and they will do it for you.  Handy, isn't it.

There were tvs all around so you could watch whatever game, news report, etc. you wanted to watch.  The patio area was well misted so you weren't too warm and uncomfortable sitting outside in the heat.  The walls are glass so you could easily see the tv's on the inside of the restaurant.  There are tvs on the outside in the patio area too.  The menu was easy to read.  Specials are listed everywhere so if you forgot, it's at the cashier too.  There are menus there too if you forgot what you were looking at when you looked at the menu on the wall.  There are so many options to choose from.  The prices are reasonable and not empty your pocket only to find lint expensive. We will definitely be back on future vegas trips."}
{"text":"yes please! I love Shake Shack! Great burgers and probably my favorite fries right now. I also love that this place has concretes with a taste of local flavor. The red velvet concrete comes with cake from Gimme Some Sugar, a bakery that I adore. 
Being the one of two Vegas locations, this restaurant gets pretty busy. However, the couple of times that I've been here, I haven't waited for my food for over 10-15 minutes. There has also always been opened seating, unlike New York where getting a seat is like participating in Hunger Games."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out. I love how they let Platinum and Noir members go first and make them a priority here. I took out my platinum card and cut the line and these people looked at me confused and got mad cause I got to order before everyone. Lol it was a busy day. Came here on a Saturday weekend before the fourth for lunch with my friend Shannon. I ordered the cheeseburger the fries with a chocolate milkshake. Everything was delicious and I loved the cheeseburger. The fries was delicious as well. I like this place better than in n out because the fries at Shake Shack is definitely better than the fries at In N out. The burger had good amount of cheese on it as well and the bread was soft. I definitely will hit this place up for my burgers cravings from now on."}
{"text":"I'm so glad there is now a Shake Shack on the west coast! No more needing 6 hour flights just to get my fix! The smoke shack is my go-to burger and I get it every time. Cheese fries, well done, definite must have! Don't forget to save room for their concretes. The jackpot is to die for! Seats might be a tough commodity, so if you have a big group, its best to send a few to look and wait for seats while the others take the orders."}
{"text":"The worst burger joint in Charlotte. The line wasn't that bad and that's the only reason I didn't give it 1 star. The food  was just okay. I could have went to McDonalds or better yet just cook a burger at home. The employees are in there talking about each other and one employee start d arguing with a guest. The young lady wen through the lobby with trash while this family was eating and was very rude to this young man and his family. I wished I had gotten her name it wasn't even me but it was very rude. This same young lady was talking about the manager and other people in the restaurant... customer service at its worst."}
{"text":"pretty good burger, pretty good fries but a bit over-priced, I mean $5.49 for such a small burger? fries and a soda will cost u around $13.00! what really keeps me coming back here to this location in downtown Summerlin is the exceptional service, always consistently awesome, friendly well trained staff."}
{"text":"Decent sandwiches and seems like the new hip place.  I was expecting gourmet burgers and gigantic shakes but it just didn't materialize.  I had the breaded chicken sandwich which came with the signature sauce.  The sandwich was smaller than I was expecting and the flavor didn't wow me.  This place works in a pinch, but there are other places that I would check out first in that area for a burger or a sandwich."}
{"text":"My expectations were met! I have nothing to complain about. The burger melted in my mouth. The cheese fries on top of the cheese omg ! My chocolate cookies and creams shake .. I mean come on ! I was in heaven."}
{"text":"So Shake Shack is really good just want to start off my saying that . 3 star non reflection on the food , burgers and chicken sandwich are mad good , meat to bread proportion , perfect and great staff great people .  Once again great food .  Price and take out are my once major negative 

1. No call in to order food option,  now the burgers are not like the vig  or a fancy burger place , it's like five guys in a way but more options so I kind of feel like a call in option is warranted.  They have app but I'm not at the point to have an app for places I go to maybe once a month,  but I'm being picky 

2. Prices , so these burgers and sandwiches are not big , they are kinda like sliders and I love sliders but once again 7 bucks for one is little much,  9 for double patty , and those are the standard normal ones. Now I think the burgers here are better than in and out with breathing room But not enough.  

Any ways once again great tasting food , really great but price is my only issue.  Burger fries drink might run you 15 -20"}

{"text":"Go figure - all these restaurants I want to try out in New York, and I end up trying them in Las Vegas!

My Shake Shack burger was flipped in Las Vegas, where they are located just outside New York, New York.  I fully expected a long line up but here's a tip: go late!  We ended up going at around midnight and there was no line up and lots of table space for my group of 8 and myself.

I tried just a regular shack burger with the mint cookies & cream shake.  The burger was pretty good; I am all about the brioche bun, and minimal toppings.  The only downside is that there was (American) cheese (hello, why wasn't it called a shack cheeseburger?!), of which I am not a fan, so I ended up having to scrape it off and that took a fraction of a point off my rating.  The shake was thick and lots of flavour - sooo good! But I could even only drink half of it.  (I really gotta stop eating late). 

I hope to go again, and this time I will try the Shroomburger."}
{"text":"Veggie burger is a must!  Melted cheese will oooze out of the mushroom that is fried to perfection. 

The cheese fries are blah, so don't bother. As a vegetarian I loved the burger. They have a good hot sauce too. All it's missing is onions."}
{"text":"Shake stack... That's really all that needs to be said... but since YELP thinks my fingers are more dexterous than just those few PERFECT words you should know these burgers are DELICIOUS. The shroom burger is stuffed with delicious melty cheese, the burger is SO juicy, the potato bread is so perfect, fresh veggies, great beer... Ugh. Don't pass it up!"}
{"text":"It was our first time coming to the Downtown Summerlin location. Friendly staff and great food. We dined in after a Golden Knights viewing party at the City National Arena. The staff didn't seem to mind that we came in, even though it was close to their closing time. 
I tried the portabella mushroom burger. I really liked it and will definitely order this again!"}
{"text":"Came here from NYC...just like home. Rob. Was super nice and made sure this place is up to snuff."}
{"text":"It has been a very long time since I have been to the original NYC location. I miss the Shake Shack so when I had the chance to visit the Vegas location, off I went!

I didn't partake in any food but just had a salted caramel shake. So good!!!! It's a thick custard shake so it is rich and at first it was a tad too sweet for me but it grew on me. Oh yum!!!

I wish they would open a location in the Bay Area. 

There is a separate line outside for just shake and drink orders. Never a line there so keep that in mind if you are not ordering food."}
{"text":"As a lactose intolerant person who is constantly traveling around, it's important that I don't consume too much diary or it causes gastrointestinal problems. So naturally I shy away from the cheeseburgers and ordered the burgers.

I got the double-double and when the cashier told me, no cheese eh? I told her that I just couldn't have diary products.

So she printed me a receipt with all the diary products and what I could and could not order. This is one of the only \"fast food\" chains that I have ever seen give me an allergy list, and they also sent back an allergy listing to the back so they were careful with the preparation of my burger. I had the sauce on the side which contains mayo, which contains some lactose, but it was fine in small dosage. 

The burger was quite juicy and it was really delicious. Together with a double double hamburger and a large drink, my total came out to be around $11, which is pricey for fast food. 

The strawberry mint lemonade was too sweet and I recommend you water it down with soda water or something of the sort. But overall I had a great experience here."}
{"text":"My wife and I first time here, and was wanting to try something new, so we popped in. My wife ordered the Chik'N'Shack and I ordered the SmokeShack and shared the cheesy fries. It was incredible! I love a non-traditional burger place over any chain. Sorry In-N-Out. New West Coast Favorite! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to try out Shake Shack since i've heard many mixed reviews from friends that have previously went. I really can't pass up a place that has been hyped up just to see for myself. This particular Shake Shack is located in New York New York. Although the prices doesn't really justify what you get, everything connected to a Casino is always a little pricier than normal. We arrived at 5:00pm on a Saturday. The line was pretty long but it went by fairly quickly.

Double Shack Burger ($7.99): Double patty with cheese, lettuce and tomatoes and shack sauce. The burger was pretty good (we were also starving after the day club). There was nothing TOO special about it but the flavors were different than others I've tasted.

Crinkle Cut Fries ($2.95): My heart lies with in-n-out fries =( I am not a fan of the thicker cut french fries.

Strawberry Milkshake ($5.25): If there's one thing Shake Shack knows how to do right... it's the strawberry milkshake!! Price is steep but it was an absolutely perfect shake! Right consistency, sweetness level and strawberries. The strawberries didn't taste processed and this was not overly sweet compared to In-n-out! If you don't want a burger, at least grab a milkshake! +1 star itself for this yummy concoction."}
{"text":"We ordered two single shacks, fries, and 2 lemonades. The burgers are better than in n out and this is coming from a California native. They are better seasoned. In n out spread is better though. Their fries are crunchy on the outside soft in the middle. The lemonade was bomb. At first I thought they were way too expensive, but the food is fresh and high quality. I wish they had more in California. Hollywood is good far lol. They need to expand more. I never thought I'd betray in n out."}
{"text":"Great food...good price! It would have been better if they offer a complete meal in their menu. Burger/fries/drink have to be purchased separately. They all tasted good, though! We love it when we first tried it in New York. We love it here in Vegas, too!"}
{"text":"My sister and I knew we were a bit hungry, but dinner was only a few hours off, so we decided to split a chicken sandwich. Good thing we were not very hungry, because it was quite small. not at all worth the price we paid for it. It tasted OK at least."}
{"text":"First time here & it's BOMB! The meat is cooked right & the cheese melts in your mouth. It doesn't come with fries, but it's worth it! The shakes are amazing! I will be back for another one next time ;)"}
{"text":"Great food. Great prices (for the strip). Line was long, but moved fast. We had to wait for a seat, but eventually we got one before food was available for pickup. We went around 8:30 pm on Sunday night (Labor Day weekend). Wife and I shared Shack Stack burger and cheese fries. We had complementary water. Burger was really great. Portobello was loaded with cheese and popped when cut in half. Meat was cooked just right. Wife did not like cheese on her fries; I did. I am happy that Shack Shack is coming to Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place five stars. I ate at one in Philly and the one on the strip. I really loved both experiences. However, I tried this one and did not have such a great experience. Maybe I was just really hungry the other two times. There was a long line (just like my other Shake Shack experiences). The burger was under cooked. It was done on the outside and pink in the middle. I took it back and the guy said \"That's how we do it here.\" He said something about it being safe to eat raw because the meat is pasteurized. WTF?! Done on the outside and pink in the middle means that the heat is too high and the kitchen is trying to turn them out too quickly. They have teenagers on the grill, not chefs. Give me a break. Anyone that has ever cooked for themselves knows the difference. The cheese sauce on the fries did not seem very high-end. Once cooked, the meal was pretty good, but not worth the price. Looking for a good burger and fries for reasonable prices? Stick with In-N-Out."}
{"text":"I've only tried the shakes and they are tasty, service was slower than I'd wish but they were busy because they are popular."}
{"text":"I've been to this location 2x and the first time was just so so. The 2nd visit was much better with food and service. We got 3 cheeseburgers, fries, and shakes. Talking about the 2nd visit the burgers were good fries were fresh and the shakes were good. The service we received was also good. Friendly staff to greet us when we walked in and took our order. We ate and someone stopped by to check on us while we dined. Overall a better experience the 2nd time around."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers! 
We ordered one with bacon and the other with mushrooms and bacon. Both really great, flavorful juicy and the sauce is tasty."}
{"text":"Arrived around 6 PM on last Thursday and the place was not too busy. Ordered a 'shroom burger and if I wanted meat. Also, had Shakcago Dog, Crinkle Fries and Dr Pepper. My wife had the Smoke Shack Burger, Fries and a Milk Shake. That meal was $38. When they added the single Burger meat to the 'shroom burger it was an additional  $4.30.

Portion wise, the burgers are small. Crinkle Fries were good and crispy. The 'shroom patty was different. Glad I tried it, next time when I go to a restaurant that charges $14, I won't complain.

The Shacago dog was really messy. They just shoved a lot of condiments onto the dog. Wasn't enjoyable. What a shame. Better stick with Portillo's or Sonic's Chicago Dog.

My wife has been to the Shake Shack in NY and loved it. I'm a first timer and won't be back unless someone twists my arm."}
{"text":"Yelp challenge 2017 5 of 100 

So now I know what all the hype is about! I feel like I've been secretly at war with everyone from the East Coast because we have In-N-Out, but I've been humbled. Once walking in I noticed the large wall that explains their specialty burgers, fries and shakes. So immediately my eyes fell in love with the shake shake stack, a burger nestled in a fried cheese party with all the burger fixins. Also went with then bacon cheese fries. 

We took a seat and waited for our creations, surprisingly we were helped pretty fast considering we were at the Las Vegas location. Our burgers were dropped off table side and it took one look to know this was going to be delicious. The cheese fries were crispy and buried under a cheesy fondue with crispy salty pieces of bacon. Along with the fries the burger had this taste that couldn't compare to any, a perfectly charred burger under all the loads of fries and melted cheese, it was magical!"}
{"text":"I don't get it! We finally tried the Summerlin location and had the Shake Shake cheese burger. We went to try it and see where we thought it placed relative to Five Guys, In and Out and Red Robin. The burger was the size of a junior burger, too salty, the cheese was like one of those plastic spread cheese. Cheese fries very average. When we want a good burger- Red Robin, next In and Out and then Five Guys. Sorry wish it was a better experience."}
{"text":"Food is okay but really overpriced. I feel that Hello Bistro on Cedar gives a better value, tastier food and more options. They just don't offer shakes or ice cream but do offer salads."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and it lived up to the hype! Crunchy fries, amazing Smoke Shack, and PB crunchcrete. Will definitely come back the next time i need a burger fix!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. The Baja chicken sandwich was really good. Our tots and fries were cold, but that what you get when you arrive ten min before it closes"}
{"text":"I bow down to Shake Shack. They stole my heart at their NYNY location, and their Summerlin location is even better! Less crowded, no lines, faster service. 

I am not a meat-eater, so I opt for the 'Shroom Burger every time (even meat-eaters like my boyfriend love this too). A deep fried portobello mushroom that oozes of muenster cheese. MM.

Don't forget to order your OWN crinkle fries (I say this because they are so simply good, you won't want to share). Not overly salty with a perfect crunch.

And this is the first time I've had room for dessert. After hearing so much rave about their \"concrete custards\", I tried their exclusive 4th or July blueberry cobbler concrete. First bite - OH MY GOD (I said just that, wide-eyed with my hand on my mouth). It's basically custard with a scoop of ice cream, but tasted like a milkshake with broken pie pieces. I aim to try their S'mores and Red Velvet concrete next time around.

There's plenty of indoor and outdoor restaurant room to dine in, or you can take your food to go. All the employees are consistently welcoming and smiley. Such an awesome atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Seems pricey. I got the shack burger amd it was more than $5 but the size of a double stack from Wendy's. Their shakes are great but also on the smaller size and more than $5. It's worth a try but not on my top five burger joints."}
{"text":"Always good to come to shake shack. I have missed their burger since I moved back from Philadelphia in 2013. Their burgers are yummy as always.."}
{"text":"A New York burger joint in New York-New York? Rather creative if you ask me. But is it worth the hype? No, not at all.

After hearing about Shake Shack opening up in Vegas, I practically begged my cousins to eat here for an early dinner just to see what the fuss is all about.

Shake Shack follows an order-and-pickup routine. In other words, brace yourself for long lines! This new addition to the Strip will certainly draw in some crowds (both locals and tourists) during peak season. During my visit, the line went pretty fast, as it wasn't terribly long. However, by the time we left, the line was already heading out the door.

I ordered the Shack Burger (single). It was fairly average for the most part. Nothing really stood out. I did like the buttery buns, but other than that, I wouldn't recommend the burger itself.

We also shared orders of cheese fries. I personally enjoyed the cheese fries. The cheese sauce was creamy and tasty. I did notice that we weren't given as much cheese as other pictures posted on Yelp (which may be due to a shortage of cheese sauce that a few unhappy customers were complaining about when we were leaving the establishment), but any more cheese, and it would've been overwhelming. The fries itself are not mind-blowing, but they compliment the burger nonetheless.

I also had their strawberry malted milkshake. Just like the burger, it was fairly standard. No artificial strawberry flavor, which was nice. However, I've definitely had better milkshakes.

Price-wise, it's quite expensive. A single Shack Burger, cheese fries and a strawberry milkshake went past the $10 mark, which is pricey for the quality and portions you get.

In conclusion, it's awesome that they've opened a NY burger joint in Vegas (New York-New York to keep with tradition.) But if you don't know what to expect, don't excite yourself. You may be disappointed with the end result.

I most likely will not return."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm disappointed. I love a good burger and the fact that one of the most hyped burger joint in the country was opening up right down the street was huge. I didn't go right away when it opened, but finally after a few months I was able to go. After waiting 40 minutes in line on a Wednesday at 2:00pm, I was able to order. The prices definitely surprised me for what I thought was a fast food style burger spot. I got a double burger, fries and chocolate shake and ran me $18! The quality does NOT live up to that price. It's very similar quality to 5 guys and the shake was nothing special. It costs extra just to get whipped cream. So all in all very disappointed. If you want an overpriced burger that really is nothing special, and want to wait quite a while to get it, then this is your spot. For me I'll just go to one of the other much better burger spots at that price around Charlotte."}
{"text":"Um, can someone say best burgers ever? I think I have found my new favorite burger joint but it's all the way in Las Vegas! There's nothing like this place in California. The burgers are definitely better than the ones at In-N-Out!

My husband and I shared a burger, fries, and salted caramel hot chocolate and were very pleased with our purchase! The burger tasted super fresh and we gobbled it up in a matter of seconds because it was so good! The fries were equally as delicious and has become my husband's favorite fries!

Unfortunately, we did not have a shake so I cannot comment on the shakes but I highly recommend you stop by for a burger lunch meal!"}
{"text":"Like their burger, very juicy. I prefer their  burger over in and out.  But in and out has better fries. Overall good food, priced right. It dose fast food right, no gimmick. No unnecessary flashy stuff that so many Vegas places"}
{"text":"My husband and I really like this new location and are glad to have one closer to home. We've always enjoyed Shake Shack, but didn't want to drive to the Strip or Summerlin for burgers and shakes. 

This location is so easy to access. They are on the shopping side of The District in the front near REI. On weekends there is plenty of parking in the closest surface lot. There wasn't much of this style of dining at The District and it's a nice addition to the current restaurant offerings.

The inside of the restaurant is clean and bright with a nice amount of seating. There are additional tables outside under umbrellas. I'll definitely take advantage of the outdoor seating when the weather cools down a bit. 

My husband and I visited last Sunday for lunch and didn't have much of a wait to order or receive our food. We both loved our burgers as much as we remembered enjoying them at the other two locations in town. The fries seemed better than I remembered. I'm not a soda drinker, but I couldn't resist when I saw that root beer is offered from the tap, delicious. My husband has always enjoyed their peanut butter shake and this was no exception. 

Last night my husband ordered with the mobile app to grab on his way home from work. He chose the earliest time and then the app updated immediately after ordering that it would be ready 12 minutes early. He said the food was indeed waiting for him upon arrival.

I'm glad to have another casual burger option at a shopping center I frequent. We will be visiting regularly."}
{"text":"Hopefully it wasn't just because I was starving after my hike, but I liked this location a lot more than the location at the NYNY. We arrived around 1:00 on Saturday afternoon and found a small line which was a nice surprise. Our food only took about five minutes to be prepared.

This location has a large indoor dining room as well as a large area outside. I was impressed with how much seating they had. Even on a Saturday afternoon it was easy to get a table outside. 

I had the Chick'n Shack since I've heard so much hype over it. I really liked the crispy texture of the fried chicken, the herb mayo, and that there was a lot of lettuce for a fast food sandwich. Great sandwich, but I think burgers are probably still the best option here. The crinkle fries were nice and crispy with the perfect amount of salt. I also enjoyed a 50/50 of iced tea and lemonade that really hit the spot. 

My husband enjoyed a double Shackburger. He did note that a double was necessary because the single would not have been filling enough. He also appreciated that they were able to prepare a burger without accidently putting cheese on it like most burger places. His hatred for American cheese is intense. The peanut butter shake was yummy as well.

Another pleasant surprise here was that they post the calorie counts of menu items on the large display menu. Awesome! I visited on my diet splurge day, but now I have another spot that I can visit on calorie counting days. For fast food their calorie counts are not that bad either."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries here are pretty good, definitely better than your usual fast food burger. I'm only knocking a star because when we visited they were out of several items on the menu which made ordering an awkward event after standing in the long line."}
{"text":"After a long walk on the Vegas Strip, we stopped by for dinner as we knew we needed to try these famous burgers before flying back home. We wanted to try a variety of items so we ordered the ShackBurger, SmokeShack, Chick'n Shack, Chocolate Milkshake and Shack Attack. 

I enjoyed all of these items but my favourites would have to be the Shack Attack (chocolate-y goodness!) and ShackBurger, which is the original burger that you typically see on social media. The portions were huge and the ingredients were good quality and fresh. The Shack sauce which is added on each burger is a must-try!

I also enjoyed the atmosphere here - they were playing a playlist of songs from 2010, and it made me feel so nostalgic. The restaurant is roomy enough that we are able to find seats for our entire group. We sat in a booth, and it was the perfect spot to chill after a long day of travelling. I'm happy that I made the visit to go here, as this will be a memory of mine for years to come!"}
{"text":"We ordered a regular burger, fries, & their specialty beer.

It tasted amazing!!! Would rate it as high as In n Out burger.

The only downside of this place is that it is crowded & it is hard to find seating.

Everything else... 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I was completely satisfied with my meal. I'm tempted to go back before I leave Vegas. That's how good it is. The line was very long when I arrived but all cash registers were open and the line went down pretty quickly so it wasn't too bad. There was also limited seating inside, luckily my family was able to quickly grab the next seat before someone else sat down. I thoroughly enjoyed my chicken sandwich, fries, and lemonade. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great prices very good quality food. Indoor and outdoor seating. I went here twice during my 3 night stay in Las Vegas and I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"First time at shake shack! The burgers here were smaller than in & out and have A  LOT more grease (it's really apparent on the paper) but I still enjoyed my burger. I got the classic shake shack burger and tried some other new stuff as well.

I would not recommend getting the concrete because its so thick and overpowering sweet. The portions here are crappy considering how each burger is $7-$10. I did however enjoy the milkshakes but all in all, not bad but the prices here are not worth

In n out  over Shake Shack"}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE!

Oh the battle of In-n-Out vs Shake Shack. You already know if you're west coast repping it will be hands down In-n-Out and if you're over from the east coast it's shake shack all day every day. They both definitely have their charm and they both are definitely delicious in their own way.

But back to Shake Shack....

This location is located outside of the New York, New York Hotel, on the corner of Park and Las Vegas Blvd. Parking at New York, New York is first hour free, second hour $7. I think parking at the Monte Carlo next door was cheaper with second hour being $5. The place is always packed as expected. I love the design concept of the place though, big, open windows, wood finishings, very modern, urban design with a huge Shake Shack sign so you can't miss it. They also have huge tvs with sports games on inside.

I highly highly recommend the Shack Stack. It's your average cheeseburger but with a deep fried portobello mushroom in it. It's a game changer. I think what I like about Shake Shack is the buns they use. It's super soft with like the consistency of a Hawaiian roll but they toast it to perfection so you have that crisp outer layer to it too. Everything always tastes fresh and the burgers are oh so juicy. The chick'n burger is not too bad either. It's made with real chicken and has a great flavor to it. The Shake Shack Sauce is a light ketchup flavored mayonnaise. And if you're feeling adventurous, try one of their shakes here, super thick and creamy.

A definite recommend if you've never been."}
{"text":"I finally got to try Shake Shack for the first time on a recent Saturday night. It wasn't an exceptionally busy night on the strip, but we must have picked the wrong time, because the line was out the door and about a block long. Luckily the line went fast and it wasn't that hot yet, so we toughed it. It also provided us with time to people watch on the strip. Just can't beat seeing a dirty Olaf with a man purse.

There were three of us so we shared two orders of fries. The fries were pretty good - definitely tasty. My kid got shackburger and the hubby and I shared the smoke shack and the Shackmeister dog. Overall the burgers and dog were good, but definitely not my favorite. I wasn't a big fan of the shake sauce - it almost had a cream cheese quality to it - maybe that's what in it? Whatever is in it, it's just ok. Also, the crispy shallots fell short. The young lady who took our order (who was very nice, by the way) described them in a way that made them sound more like grilled onions. The breading was just too much.

Luckily, there is a separate \"C\" or cold line so you don't have to wait in line for a dessert. We decided to all share the Shack Attack. It was good, not great. For one thing, the dang thing was expensive and the way they fix it, you end up with a giant hole in the middle of the cup. You seriously get about half of what you expect.  Also, it was supposed to be a concrete, but it wasn't that thick. Just seemed like a milk shake that was a little thicker than normal. I do have a favorite neighborhood concrete place so maybe I'm biased.

Overall, it was a good visit, but I'm not sure I'd venture back to the strip, deal with crowds & parking, lines and higher than normal prices for a burger. The In-n-Out down the street satisfies my burger need every time!"}
{"text":"Not going to lie but it's pretty darn good. I got their **Shack Stack Burger (fried mushroom and beef patty) and the **Cheesy Fries. Totally RECOMMENDED. It was delicious! However service was extremely slow, especially at the cashier station. At one time, they only had 1 cashier when more than 50 people were in line. The wait for my burger was about 45 mins. 

To compare, its more like San Francisco's Super Duper more than West Coast In & Out. Prices are higher for Shake Shack. 

The restaurant itself has a lot of seating and room. Clean. Expect a long wit on the weekends."}
{"text":"I went to Shake Shack for the first time today. I had a promo code for a free single shack burger. Used the app to order - worked great! The app gave me a choice of times to pick up my order and when my order was ready, I got a text. All good!

I ordered fries with my burger - they were what you want fries to be, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Yum!

Once I got to the restaurant, the person I spoke with was friendly.  The place itself is nicely laid out and has outdoor seating.

So why only 3 stars? The burger, while very favorable, was cooked rare. I could only eat around the edges. Thank goodness I didn't pay full price for it. Some people may like their burgers rare, but not me.  

Will I go back?  - yes. But I will order in house not through the app so I can tell them to cook the burger through."}
{"text":"Always super quick service for how slammed they are! Food is definitely over priced but sadly worth it. I've been here several times and will be back in the future."}
{"text":"Husband and I were in town just to meet up with family and friends and this spot was one of the places on our list.  Having lived in California for over a decade, I've been biased with having In-N-Out near where we always lived.  Well Shake Shack was a place we definitely needed to try.  We tried this place out on our last day; took a Lyft from our hotel to this spot and it wasn't busy at all.  The menu was pretty simple for the most part (not as simple as In-N-Out) but had a good amount of options.  I prefer simple burgers so that's what I got... Shack Burger (just a regular burger with lettuce, tomato, and shack sauce) and the Cheese Fries.  The burger was good and I'm always a fan of melted cheese on anything so them cheese fries were very good.  The staff seemed nice... nothing exceptional and the place was clean and lot of seating area.  Overall, I'd have to give this place a 4... the food was good.  I'd come again!"}
{"text":"This is my first time ever going to a Shake Shack and I am very disappointed. My burger was undercooked reallllllly bad. I even mentioned it to a worker and she said that they could make me a new one but I just wanted to leave. My friend said she enjoyed her well cooked burger and cheese fries, but now I'm afraid I'll become sick!!!"}
{"text":"Great burger and fries ! Place is clean employees very friendly ! Prices very reasonable, will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Delicious product, clean and nice looking store, friendly staff.  Advance mobile ordering!!  What a great idea!!

Their fries are whatever, but supposedly people love crinkle cut fries.  They are just okay to me.  The burgers here are really good.  I also tried the mushroom burger, it was good, but I prefer the hamburger.  The mudpie shake was on point!

If you've had shake shack before, you know what you are in store for.  If you haven't had it before, TRY IT NOW!!!!

They also passes out free samples of strawberry shake in line ( I didn't have to stand in line b/c of the mobile ordering, but I got one on the way in ;)  )."}
{"text":"Sheera is awesome! It's our first time here. Sheera not only went over the menu and her recommendation with us but she had the friendliest smile and made us laugh! I haven't tried the food yet but even if it sucks sheera made the visit worth it!"}
{"text":"Not sure why or how I waited this long to try Shake Shack. I didn't want to give in to the hype but I have an open mind so I thought \"what the heck, let's try it!\" and let's just say it did NOT disappoint.

I got the classic ShackBurger (cheeseburger), cheese fries w/ bacon, and ginger raspberry lemonade on my first visit. ALL DELICIOUS! I can't explain it but something about the cheese and meat is just fresh and really delicious. The size of the burger at first seemed a bit small but it turned out to be perfect (not too full but very satisfied). With the cheese fries with bacon... mmm delicious! The cheese fries were so great.

The ginger raspberry lemonade was also pretty dang good! I honestly don't taste the ginger whatsoever, so it really just tastes like raspberry lemonade... but still good.

Overall atmosphere and service was great at this location. It's a bit pricey for a burger and fries but it's on the strip - whaddya expect?!

I'm definitely coming back here to try the rest of their menu.

Protip - this restaurant is right outside of NYNY so on a nice day you can dine al fresco."}
{"text":"Stopping for lunch before getting on the road. Had the shrooms burger and cheese fries. My nieces always like eating here in NY, so I figured we give it a try finally. Mushroom was crispy and flavorful, and the fries hot and delicious. It's after 12 now in the the middle of the week but it's still not too crowded. Had friendly service and the establishment was clean."}
{"text":"'Shroom burger is where it's at. Chocolate shake is on point. Fries are crispy and taste like fries and you need them because no burger is complete without fries. Sorry, but that's on the real. 

I came on a school night before a movie and it was perfectly empty. No waiting at all. 

Not cheap. But you're in Scottsdale and you want a bite of New York, so deal wit it."}
{"text":"Quick service - prob took less than 1 minute to get my cheese fries, hot chocolate shake, and 2 shack burgers. The orders were right and fresh as well. Tremendous improvement from my previous experience!"}
{"text":"Gimme dat Shake Shack!! Their burger was heaven, pure heaven. I loved that it wasn't too intense. It was a perfect greasy spoon burger that didn't make you feel like a greasy spoon. The chicken sandwich wasn't bad either, but the burger is where it's at. I would also highly recommend getting a root beer and some custard. 

I have to give it to the Shake Shack owners because they really nailed it with their Las Vegas outpost. Of course it had to be in NY/NY, but the fact that it's outside adjacent to a park that looks like NY made it that much better. I loved it. There were even pigeons. I would like to think they flew them in so you really get that feeling of being in NY, but I can't say for sure. I can't even say at all, but that's my story and I'm sticking to it."}
{"text":"It was first time to visit and try shake shack burger.
I ordered shake shack burger with extra lettuce and french fries.
It costs was kinda bit pricey than I thought cuz I'm from California and In-n-Out is quite cheaper than Shake shake.
But overall  I enjoyed to have it. Patty was so juicy and burger bun was soft. 
Usually In-n-out burger uses lots of sauce on their burger but I couldn't even taste Shake Shack burger sauce which was good tho. I cannot say or don't want to say which is better. If you never try this burger before try it! You will love it."}
{"text":"No wait for Monday noon time! The burgers were what I remember in NY.  the shake stack melts in my mouth with cheese from the portobello oozing out. I could have done it without the cheese fries though, maybe just regular extra crispy fries next time."}
{"text":"Tried this twice on two different trips out west. Both times I was not impressed. Decent burgers, crinkle cut fries, and pricey. The grills at my apartment building have been out of order for over a month so I caved and decided to give Shake Shack another try. My opinion hasn't changed. Still decent burgers that are overpriced for a fast casual restaurant."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I tried a little of everything and wouldn't want to order any of these again. Maybe if I'm crazy drunk I will. At least m life members can get points on shack shake orders! Bring your receipt to the m life counter to get your purchase associated to your account. 

Here's the scoop..
- fifty fifty drink: half ice tea and lemonade tasted like nothing 
- shackcago dog: soggy bun, interesting toppings with cucumber, peppers, relish but I'd eat a Costco hotdog over this
- smoke shack: cold toppings were awkward in the burger. I can imagine the regular cheeseburger being really tasty though without the extra fluff toppings. You probably need to eat 2 burgers to be full. 1 is kinda small but perfect for a light snack/meal
- vanilla custard: ok, kind of melting before it even touched the outside warm las Vegas air. Reminded me of McDonalds soft serve. I'd probably prefer McDonalds. 

Really wanted to love this place but I'm not seeing the specialty. Perhaps this is more of a childhood memory, nostalgia type of grandness that I don't know about yet like White Castle."}
{"text":"Wait was fast and staff are friendly! The menu is simple!  The bacon and cheese fries so good! The \"shake shack\" burgers were delicious! My kids new favorite spot for burgers!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a chance, hello it's Shake Shack!! I'm not sure if this location is just run differently but the quality of the food here was average and over priced. We couldn't drink our Coffee Shakes since it was so thick the straw was barley picking up anything but after holding it for about 20mins it was so runny it tasted just like a melted coffee ice cream. There was no wait to order the food but it seem like there was a huge line of tables of people waiting to get there meal. Although they shout out the order number many of the orders were still getting mixed up or things were being forgotten. I didn't feel that the team here cared that there were issues with the orders being called out."}
{"text":"I heard about Shake Shack opening and had to try it out. The decor is modern inside with plenty of booths, tables and chairs. It opens at 11am and the line to get in was long. We waited in line and order my food at the registers. The cashiers are tightly squeeze in. The waiting staff are nice and friendly and they help with refills on soda. The burger and fries are small in portion and more expensive. Nice place to try."}
{"text":"Small burger, too greasy and the menu is over priced. It was a quick fix though and the restaurant was clean!!"}
{"text":"Here in Vegas I figured I would use the app for Shake Shack and it worked like a charm. The manager Cameron is so awesome and made sure my food was on point! Love the juicy burgers and the consistency of my meals. It is a must that I have shack as soon as I get to Vegas. New hot & chikn is so bomb. Keep up the good work Shack. Happy customer here"}
{"text":"I first had Shake Shack inside Citi Field several years ago and I found it delicious. Mind you I'm from San Diego so I'm very familiar with all burger options. Shake shack is not an on the go burger.

I hate to say this but the more I've had it, the more I prefer it to some California chains. The eggy bun is so tasty! Charred beef! Cheese fries! (Although I do prefer fries at other said California chain better). This place is made to order so often food can take some time depending on how busy they are. Also they have a rotating menu among their usuals so that gives you a new experience every time. I need to try their Pie Concrete because the pie mix in comes from a Brooklyn Bakery! 

If you want a good sit down experience, have time to chat and watch tv, and want decent burger quality, check this place out with an open mind.

I still like the other place.. and have my cravings for it.. but I've eaten at Shake Shack more often in the last year than other place."}
{"text":"finally got to try Shake Shack and the burger is not bad at all. i ordered the shackburger -- just a simple burger on a potato bun and you get the usual sliced tomatoes, lettuce and cheese. Overall the burger itself is not bad. Like i said it's very simple and will satisfy your burger craving. None of those fancy schmancy burgers. But for a simple burger like so, it was a bit expensive. 

the shake was delicious. i ordered the oatmeal cream pie shake since it was limited time offer and OH MY....i felt like i was eating a cookie but blended in milk. that strong oatmeal cinnamon flavor -- it was SO good. 

i enjoyed my oatmeal cream pie shake more than the burger."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Burger melts in your mouth!! Friendly and quick service. From Cali and we go here every time we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"I do like a Shake Shack burger and fries. The potato bun and cheesy goodness on a well seasoned patty. I got the double this time and didn't regret it."}
{"text":"Yes ! Le meilleur des hamburgers est à Las Vegas ! Après avoir trouvés ces restaurants sur New York il y a quelques années, nous sommes heureux de  tomber à nouveau sur un shake shack. Rien a voir avec les autres chaînes de fast food, ici tout est bon (hamburgers, frites avec du fromages fondu ...) dans des proportions raisonnables et le lieu est très sympa. Vite, vite, on y retourne !!! Un seul bémol pour celui-ci : L'accueil."}
{"text":"2.5*s NOT about the hype & I am NOT being bias because I grew up eating in & out. There is no comparison for me or the other 11 people I tried it with. It wasn't bad.. it wasn't hella good it was just okay burgers and fries to me. I split the chicken and regular shack burger & fries with my boo. Actually.. I took a bite of the chicken burger and gave it back to my bf because it was hella dry and greasy. Their shack sauce or what I think is mayo & 1/3 serving of ketchup ain't NADA compared to in & out's. Their fries reminded me of the ore-ida pixie crinkles my uncle use to make when I was younger, again nothing special here. If it was convenient and I wanted a burger I might come back but I definitely wouldn't recommend it as a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"I heard this was the \"east coast version of in n out\" pfftt if that's the case I think I'm moving! This place was awesome. So much variety :) reminded me of a true burger place and I'm not really a burger person but I loved the burgers they were delicious!!! The first  I visited  this place I was in vegas and me and my friends got there just before the giant line formed yaassss"}
{"text":"We loved this place. First time there and we were there when the doors opened. Everyone met by a smile and a menu.  We ordered SmokeShack Burgers. Larry had a shake. They were very good. Along comes Brian who couldn't believe we didn't order fries....and he brought us out some fries to taste!! Left with very positive impression! Will repeat visit next year. Just know this place can be VERY busy!!"}
{"text":"Such a nice atmosphere! Very Modern-OC looking. Line goes fast but our cashier could have been more patient, I understand there's a lot of customers to see but she could have been better in just being more patient (otherwise I would have given 5 stars). The burgers- kinda salty but very tasty and it's good with the crispy onions but I couldn't taste them too much and not much flavor overall good though. Fries- DELICIOUS!!! I would recommend just getting regular, it doesn't really need cheese but the cheese fries are good too. Shake/ custard/ concrete- not a fan of custard in general but good flavor and my family enjoyed it."}
{"text":"These burgers are the best! It's like eating a steak burger! And the cheese fries with bacon are the bomb! Finally to top it off the have the BEST lemonade!!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you to the crew at ShakeShack LV, my family and I came here for lunch and of course it was busy. Upon getting our order we forgot to order one item. I went to the pick up counter and asked if I could buy the  item there instead of standing in the long line again. She said of course. That is what I call customer service finding a way to satisfy the customer. Instead of saying no. You have customer for life."}
{"text":"Amazing  love this place and the staff is super friendly. Very attentive and the food is just heaven sent"}
{"text":"First time I've been to Shake Shack. It had a lot of hype. 

I got a shack burger with onions. The meat tasted good. It was cooked medium to medium-well. The bun was like a potato bun. The condiments were unremarkable.

The fries tasted like your standard frozen Ore-Ida crinkle cut fries.

I got a coffee shake. Excellent coffee flavor. The shakes only come in one size. It was a little small considering the price. But the flavor was premium. So the burger was expensive but tasted pretty good. The meat they used was clearly real hamburger with a good beef flavor. The fries were just average and not worth $3. The shake was delicious but small.

Overall, it tasted good but was nothing special for the price. ~$14 for a single patty cheeseburger, fries, and modest size shake. I guess it tasted a little better than In-N-Out. But a double double, fries, and shake from In-N-Out costs about half the price of my meal at Shake Shack."}
{"text":"TOSHONNA was sooooo nice on Sunday night! She was super friendly, and when we asked about shakes she recommended a half strawberry / half salted caramel shake. Omgggg this girl knows what she's talking about. It was delicious. 1st you taste the strawberry,  then a little salt, and a caramel after taste. Honestly the best shake I've had since I can remember. I highly recommend it.

I ordered the chicken shack and it was awesome. A bit on the small side, but full of flavor. A man would have to order 2 to be satisfied. My husband and nephew ordered the Smoked Stack Burger.  They said it was busting with flavor and the best burger they've ever had. My husband practically inhaled his Cheese fries, so they must have been good.

If we're ever back in the area we will definitely come back, because it was great. Thank you Toshonna for being so awesome."}
{"text":"I have only been to this shake shack and the one on the strip in NYNY. The one in the strip is okay, great food but of course you face the chance of waiting in a line and even more for the food. This shake shack experience was totally different since there was no line, the food was actually bright to us and a kind lady actually saw our waters were empty so she offered to bring us more. The person that brought us our food even picked up our trays as we finished. The staff was just so inviting and most likely whenever I visit the Las Vegas strip, I'll be driving out to Summerlin to get my Shake Shack fix. Like I said before the other Shake Shack on the strip is totally fine but the one in Summerlin is worth the drive out from the strip."}
{"text":"Like most people; I had to try the legendary Shake Shack.
Like most people; I had to see what the fuss was all about.
Like most people; I loved the food that I consumed.
Like most people; I just can't justify how much money I spent on what's essentially fast-food.

The burger is delicious. the quality of the beef and whatever other ingredients that are used to make the patty may be of a higher quality and freshness than you find at most upscale burger restaurants. It's also presented beautifully even if it is just wrapped in paper. The bun, lettuce and tomato are all the perfect size and taste to compliment the beef. The sauce is just alright. I'm not too sure what's in it, but it's heavily mayo-based, which remains the predominate flavor.

The shake is also incredible. Shake Shack doesn't just stick with the standard vanilla, chocolate and strawberry options. There is a pretty solid variety of unique flavors. Once I saw salted caramel on the menu, I had to try it. I was not disappointed. Not into shakes? There's beer, wine, and plenty of unique soft drinks to choose from.

The ultra modern ambiance makes for a nice dining experience. The wood tables made form refurbished bowling alley floors are a nice touch. The three flat screens playing sports and news make for a nice distraction if you need something to look at. And the patio looked like a nice spot to dine as well. The restaurant was also spotless despite a pretty sizable crowd at 9:30 on a Sunday night. And if you're wondering, it took about 10 minutes from when I ordered, to when the buzzer went off to get my food at the counter.

So, why just three stars? The price. I don't mind paying good money for good food, but I paid nearly $12.00 for the single patty burger and a shake. No fries or other sides. While not overly expensive, and certainly a filling meal, I could have had more food at a lower price at other quick-service restaurants. I also could pay just a few bucks more and get full-service at many other places. If there was a location closer to my home, I would happily treat myself to a meal there every few months. But since there is only this spot, and the one in Scottsdale, I can't justify going out of the way to grab a burger here. Shake Shack is good. Just not that good."}
{"text":"LOVE the mushroom burger and cheese fries with all the toppings! It's the In-N-Out of the east coast for sure"}
{"text":"Wow I'm 100 percent in n out fan but after shake shack I'm sad to say shake shack wins the prize."}
{"text":"Yup-couldn't believe I was eating at a chain hamburger place in this spiffy area of Scottsdale- but I need to say.  It made us all pleased as we were all pretty \"HANGRY\" as we arrived and we came out with smiles on our faces. Sometimes a burger, fries and a malt can reset the family."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a summer weekday. Wasn't too crowded. Ordered a medium well cheeseburger with only meat, cheese and bun and fries. Fries were crisp hot and delicious. Burger had everything on it and the meat was very pink inside. Didn't feel like going back up to wait for another burger so I took the extras off and ate half of it. It would've been good if the girl got it right. The meat was tasty and the bun was soft. Portions are small and prices are about double In n Out's prices. Can't beat In n Out for a simple cheeseburger and fresh fries."}
{"text":"Good food but a little pricy for what it is. My husband and I went here this evening and got 2 burgers, 2 orders or crinkle cut fries, 2 beers, and a milkshake. Our order was almost $50. However, the food was good."}
{"text":"This is a very good burger joint. I am always concerned when trying out places that are over hyped. While I do not believe it is the best burger, it is certainly worth the trip.

There was a long line. It did move at a good pace though. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My food was out in no time.

I ordered the ShackBurger and Cheese Fries. The burger comes topped with cheese, lettuce and ShackSauce. I opted for no tomato. The burger was juicy and tasty. The bun was solid as well. The sauce is a nice complimentary flavor. The single is more than enough burger.

The cheese fries come topped with a mix American and cheddar cheese as a sauce. The fries are good. The cheese was very good.

I was quite happy with both the fries and the burger. New Yorkers may over hype this somewhat, but it is still a very good burger."}
{"text":"Love the energy at this place! All of the employees are so friendly and genuinely seem happy to be working there. I was able to check out a few of their menu items before the grand opening this past December. I had the signature ShackBurger, Shack-cago Dog, and a Strawberry Milkshake. I inhaled the burger - it was delicious! The Shack-cago Dog is supposed to mirror Chicago style hot dogs, but there were a bit too many flavors going on for my taste. I thoroughly enjoyed the milkshake though. Strawberry deliciousness. 

I give it 5 stars for the wonderful service and their signature burger. I highly recommend for all burger lovers!"}
{"text":"I really have to disagree with all the great ratings of this place. I was wholly disappointed when my husband and I made this our dinner stop for the first night of our staycation on the Strip.

Located at NYNY, but actually outside of the casino, the outside of the restaurant is visually appealing, and draws the eye. Once inside you get immediately wrangled into a queue in front of their large menu board. This is nice as you can decide what you want while you wait in line.

I got a single ShackBurger with everything ($5.19), my husband got a double ($7.99). Note, this is just the burger, doesn't even come with fries or a drink. Maybe I'd be OK with the jacked up price - if the burgers were not BABY-SIZED. Seriously, they're tiny. Ya, they're good, the taste is awesome. Yes, very well cooked, but STILL. And yes, I know it's jacked up strip pricing. Still don't care.

Also got the black and white shake (small) and a large Fat Tire that came with a plastic souvenir cup, and a bottle of water

All in all, two people, for dinner at a fast-casual place ended up being $36.98. Yes, almost $40. We could have actually had a sit down meal for that much. 

Will not be back."}
{"text":"Coming from California, I am an In-N-Out enthusiast so maybe I am being a little bias. A lot of my friends would rave about this place so I was so excited finding out there was one in Vegas... but alas, OVERHYPED.

Quick points:
* They don't do grilled onions or any type of garnishes, not even lemon wedges.

* Strawberry mint lemonade was just weird, where's the mint purée that the description said?

* We had a little conversation with the cashier about not having grilled onions, and it was fine and whatever... Then they buzzed us with the buzzer they gave us and thought we were getting food, but all they did was talk more about the grilled onions and why they don't have it... Like, why would you tease me with that buzz? I was over the grilled onions already, geez.

* They did have bomb crinkle cut fries though.

* Burger was good, just not as good as I was expecting.


Overall, In-N-Out till I die."}
{"text":"We LOVED eating at Shake Shack! The ordering experience is fun, the atmosphere and decor are casual, tasteful, and modern, and the burger was one of the best I've had from a chain restaurant. Shake Shack is a bit pricy for the full experience (burger + fries + drink/shake/etc.) but probably on par with the price of Five Guys.

Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Apparently this is s place many people like quite a bit.  I did not think it was that great. The food was ok, shakes are better elsewhere and spent as much as I would have at a full serve restaurant."}
{"text":"There's In-N-Out, Five Guys and Shake Shack

We've never tried Shake Shack so when I found out they a place in Downtown Summerlin I told my husband we should have lunch there.

I've seen many YouTube videos of Shake Shack and how people said this place was awesome, so expectations were really high.

I don't know if we expected too much but I have to say we were disappointed.

The burgers were okay.  The cheese fries were okay.  The lemonade was okay too.

Needless to say, for our $25.11 it was really disappointing.

My husband still prefers the burgers from In-N-Out and I have to say that Hot Dog On A Stick makes a better lemonade.

This place did not make our list for places that we want to come back to.

Sorry - we really wanted to like this place.

Sadly, we didn't like it all that much =(

It wasn't horrible so it's a 3 from hubby and I"}
{"text":"Shake Shack or In N Out?  Hands down Shake Shack!!!!  Burgers with portabello mushrooms with melting cheese, sooo good!! Pricey though.  Price wise In N Out wins."}
{"text":"Love this Green Valley Shake Shack location! Easy parking, right off the freeway. They have the nicest staff here. We had such a pleasant positive experience. It's a little more expensive than in-n-out, but worth it because the quality is so good! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food that is very reasonably priced. Love the Lemonade. Have the best chocalate custard"}
{"text":"In my opinion Shake shack is way better than In-n-out. The shack burger is simple yet delicious, I also loved the fries with cheese. Wow I can't wait until the next time"}
{"text":"\"Fast food done like they give a *bleep*\"

The service is actually a bit better than you'd probably expect at a fast food high paced environment from the employees. The quality of my food here was fantastic. Today I got the smoke shack burger, and it was way fresher than anticipated. I finished order off of the salted vanilla toffee shake which is one of their seasonal shake options right now and it was fire. 

Seriously, I can preemptively imagine a heart attack coming along in my future but this food quality made it so worth it. 

Fast food restaurant owners take note. This is how you do it."}
{"text":"The burgers are fantastic, while more on the pricey end. Especially for fast food. The shakes are fantastic while also pricey for fast food. We got away with two shakes, two burgers and one order of fries for $32.16 which would be $16.08 per person if broken down. Now, while the place is nice, it's not restaurant nice. I note that because a lot of actual (mid-tier) restaurants you get away with a bill like this for two people. 

If you are about that bougie fast food life, this might be the spot for you. Because I can definitely vouch for the taste. I just don't know that the quality exactly matches the price tag, in my opinion."}
{"text":"While I'm waiting in a 2 hour line for Oyster Bar, I might as well write this review to kill time.

Shake shack is definitely GOOD... The food is fresh, juicy and really rich. I got the shack stack which includes a fried portobello mushroom (that seemed to also be infused with cheese) and it was DELICIOUS.... Their hamburger buns are unique. They're really moist and fresh. The meat patties are bigger than In-n-out's. I will say the burgers are really small for the price. This place is PRICEY for what you get.  The shack stack was $9 something and it's about the size of an in-n-out burger. 

The concretes are good but aren't really that crazy or special like they're hyped up to be IMO. I got the chocolate with Belgian waffle bits. It was crazy rich and sweet. And dense. And melted fast. 

The cheese fries are soo good... I don't normally like crinkle cut but I liked these--probably because they were smothered in cheese.

Overall, I'd say:
Really good but too expensive 
Burgers are much oilier than in-n-outs 
Service was good. Place was clean and lively 

We got 2 shack stacks, 2 cheese fries, 1 chocolate shake and 1 chocolate concrete with Belgian waffle bits and it was $40."}
{"text":"Vegas lunch, long lines, but worth it for a good burger and a little frogurt.

I'd been to an East coast Shake Shack so I knew what to expect. A gussied up McDonald's or Five Guys style place with kitschy add-ons and beer. Is what it is...the burgers are slightly better than fast-food and you can get them your way...prices a re dirt cheap and for milling about Las Vegas all day hunger it was a good filler-upperer.

Line was quite long, but the place was easy to find (on the street access off Las Vegas Blvd), attached to the north corner of the NYNY hotel/casino.

Please is great for Vegas cheats, prices are cheap, food is decent...cannot go wrong. Eventually there will be Shake Shack all around the country as they try to court the gourmet burger market.

Good luck to you Shack!

ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I really love the burgers and fries at this place. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because of the what-you-get-for-what-you-pay-for ratio, which is just a tad low for my liking. It's not low because of the quality, mind you, but because you don't get enough of all that deliciousness to walk out stuffed. Even though I get a double burger every time, I'm always left feeling a bit hungry, even with the fries and drink. The meat here is always seasoned nicely and perfectly cooked, and the potato bun is fantastic - perhaps the star of the show. I even like the special fried chicken sandwich that they've had lately. It's delicious. Being from Utah, I'd love to see them come to the Salt Lake market, and in a hurry."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Shake Shack and quite frankly the first I have ever heard of them.
It was very busy the day we visited, but didn't mind waiting in line, since we heard this was the place for a burger.
There were several selections, I had the original chicken sandwich with fries and my wife had the hamburger with fries.
They were both good, but were no Whataburger like we have back home in Texas, just good.
We really like the lemonade they have, that's something a little different.
The wait for the meal took a little time, but in all honesty, they were covered up.
We tried it, you should too.
Go get Full"}
{"text":"Went yesterday cause I was really craving hamburgers. They were so good! And the fries too. Very crowded thought. But the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"The burger is great. Really... Their burger is wonderful, clearly quality and the taste proves the quality. The meat is perfectly cooked, cheese tasty and veggies fresh. My third time visiting and I am still shocked at the price. I am all for getting what I pay for, but this is just a burger place with no fancy servers or special meat. The price you pay for counter-serves burgers is a bit too high. The value is lacking. If the $8 double burger (burger only) isn't enough.... Try $2.50 for a small soda!?! Seriously!?! For a soda?? This is one ridiculously exorbitantly priced small soda. Oh... And it's not self serve, so you need to ask for a refill. Not sure if it's free or not.

Clearly the soda machine here has the best ROI. That followed by the beer, the frys. I would pay an $8 burger all day long for one this quality.... I'll consider if I will return every time due to the drink prices.

Owner: Be reasonable with your soda/beer prices. You are a counter-serve burger joint.... Not a steak house."}
{"text":"First time trying a Shake Shack, highly disappointed awaiting their grand opening in Summerlin. Purchased the double cheeseburger, fries and a chocolate shake. Bill came to $15.00.The meat is tasty but very thin; a double burger wasn't enough to satisfy my craving. The chocolate Shake wasn't very good, average at best. In & Out or Five Guys is far better and much cheaper."}
{"text":"The 'Shroom Burger opened a whole new world for me. Being a vegetarian, the options at burger joints often leave a lot to be desired. You either get a bad processed veggie patty, or a grilled cheese sandwich.

The 'Shroom Burger is two portobello mushroom caps, stuffed with muenster and cheddar cheeses and deep fried, served on a soft, toasted bun with lettuce, tomato and Shack Sauce.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So many fuss about how great this place is so my family and I decided to try it out.  It was 1:15 on a Saturday afternoon so the place was pretty busy.  Once we were inside, we had to line up to place our order.   Everything in their menu is carte. It's pretty pricey for a burger and fries.  Customer service wasn't that great.  Nothing extraordinary about this place.  The burgers were juicy and the fries were fresh.  Again, nothing that would tickle my palate.  Overall experience was okay."}
{"text":"OK, not going to complain about the prices since they're not deceptive: if it's too expensive, no sense complaining, just skip the place altogether.  The food itself is good. Last time I went - I had vegetarian burger and it was actually soggy and yuk. But today I got chicken BBQ sandwich and it was actually good. The outside was crispy and inside tender. My family had shackburger and some other fancy burger with bacon and seem to be happy. Also had a salted caramel shake and it was delicious.  Total was about $40, including hotdog and fries."}
{"text":"Was in town on business and connected with my cousin for dinner. Kids picked this place. I was not disappointed! Surely a repeat visit if I'm back in town."}
{"text":"This is my favourite fast food burger joint.  The burgers are just so tasty and the meat is hormone free.  You can also get alcohol here; how can you go wrong. I haven't tried the custard but everyone who has raves about it. We went to this place four times during our trip."}
{"text":"It Was, it had, and it did! 

Buns extrodinarilly sweet soft, and burgers great flavor , fresh.   I had the Carmel shake, sooood good.

I will go back!"}
{"text":"Decided to mix it up on the strip and try a locale we have heard is popular in other cities.
We started with the \"cheese\" fries and thought they were the best part of the meal. Crispy salty crinkle fries with \"cheese\" sauce smother...and they have no calories!
I ordered the ShackMeister Dog which is a Vienna frank split down the middle and crisped up on the flat top grill, covered with the same \"cheese\" sauce and crisp onions... My wife tried the ShackBurger and we enjoyed them both. 
We could not leave without sampling both of the namesake products and opted for the custard of the week shake...peanut butter banana, which in my opinion was just so-so.
With average food, and above average prices I will stick to In-n-out for my burger cravings where available, and Five Guys everywhere else..."}
{"text":"I had been to the Shake Shack in NYC a few years back so I was so excited to see it in Vegas! I thought the staff was very friendly. The shakes are to die for! I recommend the strawberry. The burger tasted very fresh and homemade, which is my favorite. The fries are delicious too. This is a great place to order a meal and sit outside!"}
{"text":"We loved this place too! We were so busy and didn't have time for a sit down meal every time, so we stopped here twice.  I have thumbs up from everyone in out party that The Chicago hot dog, chicken sandwich, cheeseburger, fries, shakes are all delish!  Great price too."}
{"text":"Jessica was extremely personable and helpful! And of course my burger was delicious as always!"}
{"text":"Nestled in the Vegas Outlet Mall.  Good for chicken and beef burgers.  A must try when u get to Vegas.  Plus the shopping is great.  Outlet has Kate Spade, Dooney Burk, Tory Burch, and Marc Jacobs..."}
{"text":"One star for creating lines out the door because they -purposely- short-staff the registers.  And....(let's go to five guys in the meantime)"}
{"text":"I like the bread. I think it's a bit pricey for the amount of food you get, I got a double patty burger... Slightly more food than in and out but it's over 8 for the burger alone."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a quick bite to satisfy your hunger. Super fresh tasting burgers and the fries are delicious too. My wife gets the milk shake and tells me how delicious they are even though im not a milk shake drinker she insist on having me try it..but I wont give in so I'll just take her word for it. I can tell you that I've had different burgers from here and they all have been oh so good. Never disappointed after coming here for some grub. Yes, theh are a bit more expensive than your typical fast food spot, but then again, they dont even come close to those \"other\" burger spots. 

Trust me, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place as my son is a shake aficionado, but they def disappointed. The shake wasn't bad, but def not worthy of anything above 3 stars. We also had a concrete which was basically a DQ blizzard, just twice as pricey for half as much and poorly presented in a sad little cup lol.. Didn't get a chance to try the food, but it smelled HEAVENLY and each time we tried to grab a burger, lines were insane, so they must be doing that right at least :) skip this place for shakes, though, I'm fairly certain you'll be :("}
{"text":"Good food but definitely over priced; quality reminded me of Culver's. We had a party of 6 and paid around $80 for everyone to get a burger and a drink (some were shakes) then we shared some fries. You are paying extra for the location. We went on a Tuesday afternoon and the line went out the door. Seating really is limited so you have people standing around watching you eat, waiting for you to finish so they can pounce on your table."}
{"text":"I feel like I missed something. I didn't get their shake, so maybe I missed that...

I got their fried portabello burger with fries. So the burger was alright. I realized again that I am a meat dude and the fact that it was an entirely vegetarian burger made me not like it as much. However, I can tell that if you are a vegetarian then you'd love this burger! It was good for what it was. Also, the burger... looked perfect. Like it would go on an advertisement if that's something you look for. 

The fries were surprisingly good given that they were just fries. Fresh, crunchy, warm, perfectly salted. I would come back here again. The atmosphere is very inviting too. I thought I was going to be a loner eating by myself but there are lots of people eating by themselves as well as groups of friends and families. It's a very nice place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love that their burgers are super fresh & the shakes taste exactly the way you would expect. I had the holiday cookie shake & it was as if I was drinking a Christmas cookie! At one point my sister and I (whom I was sharing the shake with) were in 6th heaven when the shake seemed to hit a \"cake batter\" taste that was amaaaaaing!! Definitely one of the better places on the strip to get a good burger."}
{"text":"First time here and tried a milkshake.  Had a few questions regarding the ingredients of their custards and mix-ins (toppings, pies, and syrups).  The cashiers and runners were friendly and patient; if they did not know the answers to my questions, they made sure to find someone who did-- in this case, the line cook leader (perhaps the manager).  I didn't encounter any impatience nor condescension, which shows me that they take customers with allergies seriously.  Love that!

Wanted to try their CamelShack**, which was made of their vanilla custard, milk, sea salt caramel, and a slice of their banana cream pie, but no one could get the info I needed regarding the pie's ingredients (mainly, if the banana custard filling contained powdered sugar) that afternoon.  The custard and caramel were corn-free, that they knew.  So, the Fair Shake it had to be.  I also wanted (Mast Brothers) dark chocolate chunks mixed in, but their shake machines cannot handle the big chunks of chocolate, so I had to get them on the side.  I enjoyed the thick consistency of the shake- had to use a spoon in the beginning, and still was using it until I finished- as well as the dark chocolate chunks, but I thought that the Fair Trade coffee flavor could've been a lot stronger.  I wonder if they could add a Fair Trade espresso shot, or two in it?  Better yet, throw in some chopped chocolate-covered espresso beans into the mix?  Oh, yeah.  I'd have to order that on the side...  Note to Shake Shack:  Please brew stronger coffee for the custard flavoring AND offer dark chocolate-covered espresso beans as a topping choice!

I'll be back to try a burger and fries and other shake variations!  I wonder if I could just order a scoop, or two of their frozen custards to enjoy?

**5% of sales of CamelShack help support the Phoenix Children's Hospital!

p.s.  The manager promptly responded to my review and said that scoops of custard could be ordered to be enjoyed and not just in shakes and concretes."}
{"text":"Way better than in n out or any American burger joint. All you need is their normal burger and you're set. So bomb"}
{"text":"Where else would they put a Shake Shack on the Las Vegas strip? Of course... it's outside of New York, New York! When I saw there was a location in Las Vegas, my mind was already made up. I knew where I was going to be eating lunch on one of the days even thought I had it - twice - about a month or two prior. 

This location is outside of New York, New York in what is known as \"The Park\" area. It is next to Bruxie & Tom's Urban. If you are on the strip, you cannot miss it. 

The place was like a very well oiled machine. You are in the line as soon as you walk through the main entrance. There is an employee managing the line and answering questions. They also make sure customers are heading to the registers as soon as one becomes available to keep the line moving. There is a big menu board to look at while you are in line with prices and calories.

We ordered with a friendly employee at her register. We got our beer order first. Then, we waited for our food. While waiting, we saw how crazy good the employees were at their job! There were a ton of them, and they were getting food out quickly! If someone came to the counter to complain or ask for something, they were quick to resolve the problem or get the items customers needed. I was definitely amazed.

And our food? It was great! It was just as I remembered and the reason I had to go to this location when I heard about it!"}
{"text":"First & last visit to Shake Shack. Burgers were so greasy I wanted a hot shower afterwards.  Fries were average at best. Chocolate shake was gritty, like it was made with a powder - so bad we didn't drink it. Floor dirty.  Disappointed, but full of regret."}
{"text":"The food was tasty and fresh; Fries were great!!! I wish they had other sides other than just fries. Enjoyed the visit!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Shake Shack. Although the 4/5 is because WOW the prices here are insane! For a burger, fries and shake is about $15-$20. I could go to In&Out and get the same thing (even if I'm not their biggest fan). I do have to say, Shake Shack's food is phenomenal! The cheese fries are to die for! The staff is very friendly and it's a great place to hangout with friends and family. They have an indoor and outdoor dining area with a ping pong table outside for the kids. The burgers, fries and shakes are some of the best in The Valley! For a big business they know how to make those 3 things! Highly recommend, if it's payday/a night out!"}
{"text":"The burgers are fried and look pressed. The buns are undersized. The smallest buns i have seen. The burgers are from About 4.00 to 9.00. Not such a good deal. The sodas are dispensed from  behind the counter.  They do offer refills. The drinks are very small. Our meal, 4 burgers, 2 were the cheapest on the menu, with 2 fries and 3 drinks, small our bill was 40 dollars Hmmmm. I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"Good burgers. The service was very good.  The cheese was melted cheese wiz type. Fries . They serve coke... yay. The buns are really good.  Nice outside seating."}
{"text":"Good burgers. 
Good shakes. 
Good fries. 

Great value for the money ESPECIALLY in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best crispy chicken burgers I've ever had! The size is actually perfect and not huge like the rest of Americas burgers. The crispy fries were awesome and golden. I tried a coffee shake and it was pretty delicious:) overall tho, the prices were more than your average burger but that's what you're gonna pay at these hipster places. 

I also really liked the decor of this restaurant. It's very modern and you order once you enter and then go find your own table. Seating was a bit hard for a large group but we managed and then it's located in the Summerville mall so that's super convenient to just go shopping after."}
{"text":"Went there one time a while ago, and was underwhelmed.

Went this weekend, and I don't know what happened, but I was completely turned around. Had a strawberry shake, double down, and double shake.

Strawberry shake: real strawberries, tastes like real strawberries, definitely better than the in-n-out shake.
Double down: Fries, sauce, cherry peppers, and bacon. The bacon feels a bit displaced from the rest of the bowl, but the entirety of it is fine.
Double shake: Inhaled. Solid."}
{"text":"Quick service, even when the line goes out of the door.

Milk shakes are good.

Hotdogs are small and overpriced.

Burgers are good but overpriced. Small thin patties but they do taste good.

Good to go once to try it out but if you want bigger protein portions for the price, go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers, comparable to In n Out although I think Shake Shack is better especially the French Fries. Everything is al la carte so it can get pricy fast."}
{"text":"I'm a shake shack fan from way back. 

This location is true to it's New York roots. Best burgers ever. 

Convenient location at New York, New York. It was a staple of my las vegas diet. 

Always a little bit of a wait because they make burgers fresh...but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Even after having Shake Shack in New York, and thinking it was over hyped, My nephews wanted to eat there. Wait in a line out side, just to get in. Order Burgers, fries and drinks . $2.80 for lrg Iced tea. No refills. Maybe you can if you go to the counter? But with the horribly long line, I didn't bother. You are paying the price of a sit down burger, Maybe someone should come around and refill for you?? Or, Hey Shake Shack- Put the drinks on the OUTSIDE of the kitchen and we'll refill them. $44 for three burgers and fries and no refills......"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to eating here ever since having it on the East Coast.  The line was long but not out the door just yet.  It moved pretty quickly.  We were able to snag a shared table inside.  It was my friend's first time here, and she liked the burgers better than In 'n Out because the buns were so soft.  I still think In 'n Out is better, but this is a close second.  Crinkle cut fries are better here than the fries at In 'n Out - got it with cheese on the side for an extra $1.  I didn't get a shake, but my friends did and I had a sip.  The chocolate taste more like a cross between a milk and dark chocolate, so it wasn't too sweet, nor was it too thick.  It was actually pretty good.  If the line hadn't been so long, I would have tried a custard dessert at the end.  They also don't do grilled onions, which they should totally add!  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger joint from New York, they know how to do it right. Everything thing is great, I mean it."}
{"text":"Had the double smoke shack. 2 stars for super yummy burger. Lost the rest of the stars for the cost and size. For $10+ burger, I expected to be full (I had fries too). Had to order another to fill me up. 
The burgers were way too small, even the doubles. This is more like kids size. If my 9 yrs old had 2 of the regular cheeseburger (he's a skinny kid), then the burgers here are kids size. $90 for 5 people is a bit steep. 

The staffs were nice though. Clean restaurant. Just doesn't make up for the ridiculous size in portion and costs. The burgers are not made of top quality wagyu and should not cost this much. I don't care if it's non gmo either. I used to work for a 5 star fine dining restaurant on the strip so I know my beef. For that size, it should be a $5 burger. Would not come back even if u bribe me with free meal."}
{"text":"I only came here for their shakes as I think they're the best shake out there (coming from someone who grew up going to In-N-Out). This location is on par with all the shakes I've had at their NYC locations so huge thumbs up there!

Only complaint is that this is the busiest Shake Shake that I've ever been to which says a lot since they're all busy no matter which location you go to. We were hoping to go through the line outside that only sold shakes & malts, but we could tell the longer line inside was actually moving more quickly. What we didn't realize is that we'd have to wait longer for our order to be called in that line since it'd be competing with people getting full meals. Oh well. 

But in the end, yes. Their shakes are still amazing. I won't compare the food to In-N-Out because they're just different. Just keep that in mind. In-N-Out does their thing. Shake Shake does theirs. Why can't you just enjoy both equally? I know I do!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't tried Shake Shack during the times that I've visited Vegas. I've grown up with In n Out in California. However, I've definitely been converted to Shake Shack after this.  The line to order food was quite long, but moved along quickly.  The burgers were delicious and full of flavor. It really lived up to the hype. We also ordered the double down fries which had the perfect amount of crispiness, cheese, bacon, and peppers on top. We will return!"}
{"text":"I had a very good hotdog and my friend had a burger and fries. We both enjoyed our good and the French fries were delicious. I'd love to try the custard next time!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack or IN N OUT? The million dollar question. For me, both are good but Shake Shack has way more options for non-beef eaters. I ordered the Chicken sandwich which is pretty yummy, especially when you have the drunchies. The crinkle fries are good as well and their shake menu is to die for. They specialize in different sweet treats and each one is yummy. This is a usual spot for us to visit when we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Good food, I got light headed and diarrhea after eating here but that's my fault for having a double burger and shake"}
{"text":"Soooooo delicious. Super juicy and flavorful. I had a single smoke shack and it was the best. I'm so glad they brought this wonderful establishment to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Customer service here is amazing! The food is worth the hype. The burgers are delicious and the crinkle cut fries are a great addition to my meal. I ordered a strawberry milkshake which was a little too rich and creamy for my taste (others may like that) but the staff was kind enough to refund me and not make me feel guilty for being \"that person.\" 

Shake Shack has a very welcoming, fun, and upbeat atmosphere. There's lot of Instagram posts and hype around this place for a reason. It's worth the insta! 

Come here with your friends and your family. I guarantee you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is alright.  Nothing to wait in line for.  I have ate at In-N-Out, Five Guys etc.  The smoke shack burger here was good not great.  I will say the crinkle cut fries were perfectly cooked.  Most places have trouble with that but not here.  The prices were a bit on the high side for what you are getting.  For whatever reason this place just didn't really do it for me."}
{"text":"Definitely not bad.. I can see why people are comparing it on IN n OUT, but if you take into consideration.. IN n OUT can't be beat..

I actually like the fries here better than INO..

Del taco still has the best for fast food tho"}
{"text":"Good burger and amazing buns! If you like crinkle cut fries, you'll love their fries."}
{"text":"Still not too sure why everyone keeps comparing Shake Shack to In n Out... to me, they're nothing alike.

Price: Shake Shack is definitely up there when it comes to fast food joints. Think Fat Burger prices, but maybe not quite as steep. 2 Smokeshacks, 1 cheese fries, and a 16oz Shackmeister ale came out to about $25. Meh.

Burger: The Smokeshacks we ordered came with bacon and cherry peppers. The peppers really added a great deal of flavor and they were a nice touch. I wish the cheese fries had them! The meat had a nice char and was good overall. It's about the same size as an In n Out burger.. but that's where the similarities end for me. The bun was soft and yellow, and looked much like a potato bread bun to me. Good overall, but not sure it's worth the ~$6 price tag.

Cheese fries: Crinkle cut fries tasted like the frozen kind you can fry up at home. The cheese sauce was too salty and just made the whole thing turn into a cheesy mashed potato-like dish. Wasn't too big of a fan and didn't really care for it. The dinky little popsicle stick-ish fork wasn't the most efficient eating utensil either...

Shackmeister ale: Ok so I wasn't expecting anything spectacular but since we were here, I wanted to try their house beer! Brewed by Brooklyn Brewing, it popped up on my Untappd as a pale ale... uhhh no. It didn't taste anything like a pale ale, or at least what we're more familiar with on the west coast. It tasted like a light lager. Boyfriend said it reminded him of Dos Equis... Take that as you will. Wouldn't order it again.

The line: It wraps around inside, but when we got here around 3pm on a Friday, it reached just to the front door. The wait was about 15 minutes or so to the front counter where we placed our order. The wait for food was maybe another 10 minutes.

The service: They mess up orders here. A lot. The table behind us had their orders messed up from what we overheard, and they messed our order up as well. I had originally ordered the 32oz Shackmeister ale to share w/ the bf... but the server rang me up for the 16oz one, despite him verbally repeating my order to me and me, again, clarifying with him that I wanted the 32 oz. What'd we get? The 16 oz. (It's okay though--he actually ended up saving us bc the beer wasn't good anyway). And I'm not sure if it was intentional, but they also gave us 2 cheese fries, instead of the 1 we ordered. Were they making up for the other 16oz of beer that they didn't give us? Idk. But it worked to our advantage so whatevers. 2 cheese fries it is. Too bad the fries were too salty and mushy & we didn't even finish them anyway.

---

TL;DR: Good burgers, soggy/salty cheese fries, expensive and not necessarily worth the wait if the line is long. I wouldn't mind eating here again, however I wouldn't wait in a line that went past the door if I had other options."}
{"text":"Didn't feel like walking or driving so we ate somewhere close to the theatre.  Lo' and behold, the famous NY burger shop Shake Shack.

So this place was supposed to be da bomb.  Meh...I wasn't blown away.  First bite was full of shack sauce.  To me, it was mayo with thousand island.  Plus they had cheese sauce and a cheese slice I think.  I could only taste the cheese sauce.

I was cheese overload so the cheese fries didn't hit the spot.  I should have ordered regular fries.  My daughter ordered a chocolate shake and she wasn't to happy with it.

Gotta say In N Out still rules the West Coast."}
{"text":"First time here and also the last!  Let me begin with something good though. If it weren't for the manager on duty [Paul], and the way he took care of me after the incident, this review would be ZERO stars, if possible. He refunded me totally and was more than kind. 

   Ordered a shake, \"smoke shack\", fries and a bottled water- simple enough order.  To keep it short- food was overall OK, and I'm still an In and Out fan- more so now, more than ever, because of places like this. 

  Here's when it happens...after receiving my order and taking two bites, I realize where is the bacon in this? Is it THAT small?!  Come to find out, it's not there. A simple enough fix- go back and get the right burger. Mistakes happen.   As they apologize, a short, mouthy and unhappy woman comes from the back \"who's this smoke shack burger for?\" As she hands it to the other server to give to me, I hear her say clearly- \"he ate HALF of his burger already.\"- in a disgusted tone. I could have done without this comment. I don't want a free meal- I can pay for my own.  If I wanted 2 burgers I would've bought 2. 

  Good customer service will do wonders for this place. Bad customer service will do 5x the damage. If you plan to create a large customer base that continuously comes back to this location- Remember- treat everyone nicely and with respect. You'll never know if they're a local.  Keep the manager. Lose the attitudinal back of house."}
{"text":"No no no and no. Shake shack you have nothing on In and out. Bf says the shake is better than in and out so they get one star but when it comes to a overall review this is a burger joint so let's rate the burgers. Wait...first I must complain about the seating...there wasn't enough. Lol. Onto the burgs. We both ordered the shake burger, I ordered it with everything he ordered plain. We got cheese fries which were not that great. I don't like nacho cheese so perhaps that spoiled my expectations. Even my bf who loves velveeta and American cheese didn't care for the cheese fries. So now you know we both gave the shake shack a thumbs down. Once again Cali based In and Out has our vote on best burger.
Updated review.
Bf told me to add that there is zero provision for grilled onions at the SS. There is no ice for water and there is not a soda dispenser at your whim."}
{"text":"It was our very first time trying Shake Shack. We missed it the last time we were in NYC. The verdict?! I really enjoyed it!!! You guys might all wonder, which is better? iN-N-OUt or Shake Shack. Both burgers are made differently, I want to say, they are all a different breed. Each burger stands out differently.  Shake Shack adds their specialty sauce in each of their burger. Also, we can't forget about their amazing fried portobello mushroom with oozing cheese or some sort of sauce after each bite. I like to add red peppers to my burger, it adds a nice tangy- spicy-ness kick to the burger.  Don't forget to add a side of crinkle cut cheese fries! . I suggest sharing, the portion is not big, but it is pretty heavy due to the cheese. Can't wait to go back and try the frozen custard next!"}
{"text":"The shack chicken is amazing, of course I added bacon and cheese. We also had the shake stack which was to die for. Chocolate and strawberry shakes were awesome. We came for lunch on a weekday and it wasn't packed."}
{"text":"My hubby and I were super starving around lunch time and I searched yelp for some good burger places and this place popped up as #1! We just had to check it out!

The line was super long but they had a lot of employees working and the line ran pretty quick. The prices are reasonable and the burgers, hot dogs and cheesy fries are to die for!! I think we spend about $35 for 2 burgers (1 ShackBurger & 1 Shack Stack), 2 hot dogs (Shack-cago dog), cheesy fries and a drink! Not bad! We definitely left full! I wanted to try one of the shakes or ice cream but I had no room left! We were stuffed. 

When my husband went to the fast order window to get a drink refill, he received 2 free chicken sandwich coupons! So nice! I wish I remembered the name of the staff member that gave this to us! Very much appreciated! Because of this, we definitely came back the next day and the food tasted just as good as the day before. Love this place! I wish we had it in KS!"}
{"text":"I've heard people compare this place to IN N OUT and 5 Guys, so I had some expectations. Unfortunately, this place did not hit the target. While the meal was slightly better than an average fast food burger, it failed to impress me or my spouse. To summarize:

1) portion was kinda small.
2) burger was a little dry.
3) I forgot I ordered bacon on my burger until it was half eaten....not worth the $1.55 extra.
4) WAAYYY overpriced! This is probably what stuck out to both of us. $20 for 2 smallish burgers and smallish fries is not going to cut it.

Overall the food is a 3 stars, but the value is only 2 stars. It's a really nice venue, and maybe I'll come back and try a shake, but I don't ever see myself coming back for a burger and fries."}
{"text":"After hearing so many people talk about shake shack we all had to go check it out... After waiting 45 minutes to order and another 15 to receive our food all 4 of us were thoroughly disappointed with the quality, taste, and simplicity of their burgers and fries.

Fries tasted like the same crinkle cut fries you get from the freezer section. The cheese sauce was something you'd find at a gas station.

Burger was simple and lacked basic flavor. 

If you like basic food with no flavor then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"First time here and it is one the best burgers I've tried for its cost. Prices range from maybe $5-$6 for a burger. I don't know why people compare it to In-n-out. Shake shack is waaaaaaay tastier and offers more variety. Never compare the two lol. I recommend  the cheese fries to go with your burger. Also, the Louisiana hot sauce is a MUST to drizzle on top of your burger! 
Overall, I will take every chance I get to eat at a shake shack whenever I see one!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Shake Shack. Today, I ordered the following:

'Shroom Burger
French Fries w/ Cheese
Small Coke
Total cost: $14

I arrived at 2:15pm, there was a small line and the eating area was about 70% full. I quickly ordered and waited about 10 minutes for my food to be prepared. The fries and cheese sauce were okay but luke warm. I would prefer both to be hot, especially the cheese sauce. The 'shroom burger was a little messy but tasted good. I think it is a little on the smaller side but did find it tasty. 

Ultimately, my meal cost about $14, that is a little high for fast food. I will probably be back at some point because I live close to this location and I want to try other items on their menu. That said, my first impression is that The Habit and The Stand provide better food at a better price."}
{"text":"I ate here about 2 weeks ago. Was it good? Yes but I also thought it was overhyped. I think of it was a better version of Five Guys. If you haven't had Shake Shack i definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"The mushroom burger OH MY GOSH!!!  The bun, the sauce, the flavor - even the fries were excellent and soo super crispy!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place, as I'm sure most of you have. In SoCal it's known to be the \"In-n-Out of New York.\" I didn't know what to expect and also tried to make sure I didn't have extra high expectations. Took my first bite and LOVED IT!!!!

It's definitely not as cheap as In-n-Out, but the burger is a lot JUICER and the bun is a lot SOFTER. The only downfall is that they don't have onions in their burgers. However, I was quite surprised that the burger can STILL be delicious even without the onions!!


SHACKBURGER DOUBLE: Cheeseburger stacked with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce
- I'm all about the double-double at In-n-Out, so I chose to eat the double here as well. DELICIOUS! Super juicy and just plain good. If it's your first time, I'd recommend to always start with the original - Shackburger (single or double - however way you like it; add a bacon if you'd like).

SHACK STACK: Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger (Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses) topped with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce.
- ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Cheese-stuffed mushrooms?! What more can I ask for!!!

FRIES: Crinkle cut fries
- I wasn't too happy to find out the fries were crinkle cut. Crinkle cut fries reminds me of high school cafeteria fries.... BUT ITS NOT! The fries were very crispy and delicious. We ordered one regular fries and one Cheese Fries. They were both great."}
{"text":"5/5 because Shake Shack always knows how to satisfy my belly! The Smoke House Burger, Loaded Fries (don't forget to request some cherry peppers!) and some amazing frozen custard. I always enjoy checking out the special flavor of the week. Also, I'm pretty picky when it comes to milkshakes, but this place does them right. They've never lost any flavor, they're very rich and thick. 

This location is great because it's never going to be quite as crazy as the one on the strip. That means shorter lines and shorter wait time! Also, the service is very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Shake Shack in a few years. And the last time I went I was a vegetarian and only got to try their fries and custard. But I have now had the full experience and I can say that I am truly a fan!

Hubby and I shared a burger that was topped with bacon and a roasted red pepper sauce that was absolutely bursting with with flavor and juiciness! And while I'm not usually a fan of crinkle fries because they scream frozen and flavorless. But these not only had a decent crunch on the outside, but they also were nicely seasoned. 

I chose to get a small custard. Being from the Midwest, I'm no stranger to awesome custard with which to create an amazing concrete. Usually with as many mix-ins as they allow. However, I decided to follow their lead this time and simply pick something from the menu. While it forever for them to prepare (compared to how fast I'm used to) and I did feel like the mix-ins were a bit on the skimpy side, this is some amazing custard! I'm not usually a fan of plain vanilla, but this stuff is extra good! It has a depth of flavor that I simply can't explain. On top of that, it has all the creamy perfection that you crave when it comes to custard. The more I write about this, the more I am convinced that I need to go get some right now, but this time get a large!..."}
{"text":"Oh man, Shake Shack is just so good. We don't have them in our area of Ohio, and we always try to find one while on vacation. This was a really nice one. Great location, clean, plenty of seating.

The Stack Shack is like a burst of flavor when you bite into it. It's amazing. You won't find it anywhere else. So unique. The hot dog and fries were good too, but that Shack Stack, if you like mushrooms, don't pass it up. Can't go wrong with a milkshake either!

I think I need to move somewhere closer to a Shake Shack....."}
{"text":"We almost missed this place on our Vegas trip but decided to try it on our way out of town. 

It's a fun fast food place. We ordered two burgers, BBQ bacon cheese fries and a mud pie shake. The burgers and fries were both delicious! They had a unique taste to them. We did feel that the burger was smaller then other similar restaurants. Next time I would order a double patty. The only disappointing item was our shake. It left a weird taste in my mouth and I did not find it very good."}
{"text":"yeah all the hype.  all the fuss.  all the food.  all the shakes.  delicious.  I had the hotdog and chicago dog and they were good.  now the coffee fair trade shake, i could not get enough.oh did I mention the coffee shake was delicious?  

If you know what you want, there is a virtually no line window outside to get small things like drinks and cements."}
{"text":"Just as good as the one in New York! I went here twice on my last Vegas trip and it tasted a lot better drunk......

My favorite is the shack burger with a side of cheese fries and custard for dessert!

TIP: Add on pickles and onions with a side of chili peppers!!"}
{"text":"I'll just say this...Shake shack may be the best fast food burger I've ever had! I will admit that you have to turn your head if you are calorie counting. I enjoyed a single shake burger with cheese and a strawberry milkshake. I'm not sure I was able to fully appreciate the food due to how fast I inhaled it, haha! It was a perfect quick meal while sightseeing on the Vegas strip. Please, please, please bring a location to Indianapolis!"}
{"text":"Despite the cult following of this burger joint, this establishment has opportunities in a few ways: service, food quality, and price competitiveness.

Not the most friendly welcoming or informative staff, the interaction was very transactional. I was hoping that the food quality would make up for it, especially since the menu is very narrow for burgers. Disappointingly, the meat was under seasoned, riding on the sweet bun flavor.  It was bun show more than anything. Fries were hearty and crisp. The lemonade and shake was overly sweet. Not something to write home about. On top of all this, I paid over 20 dollars for substandard service and food in an \"affluent\" mall."}
{"text":"Originally I was very excited to have a Shake Shack on the west side of town where I wasn't having to fight down Strip tourists, but after having burgers from some similar competitors around the valley I'm just not as impressed anymore. 

The service here is great don't get me wrong there. The cashier was super friendly and a few employees offered to throw out our trash and refill our waters while we were eating in the dining room. Super attentive and friendly! The food though was just meh, ok to me. I had the shroom burger which was basically a large breaded mushroom filled with cheese and topped with the standard burger toppings. I love the uniqueness of it and that it was vegetarian friendly, but it was just a little bland in the flavor department. The cheese fries were pretty disappointing too. I thought they'd use an actual cheese sauce, but it tasted more like the artificial slice kind. The only good thing I had was the chocolate shake, very rich in flavor and taste.

I'm not sure I'd really come here again unless it was super convenient or for a specific purpose. It's a little pricey for what it is."}
{"text":"Not spectacular, not bad. Seems to be more style over substance. I would compare this place to the most famous national coffee chain. Nice clean location.

Had a smokeshack, really cold peppers that made it seemed like eating a popsicle in parts. 

Giving it three to be fair. Drop the price 20 percent and it would be more in line with the food quality."}
{"text":"I've heard sooo much about Shake Shack and how it compares to In-n-Out so I was looking forward to finally being able to try it for myself!

My friends and I came on a Saturday afternoon during Labor Day weekend and the line was pretty long but it moved fairly quickly. It was actually kind of nice standing in line because it gave us an adequate amount of time to decide what we wanted to order.

After reading through a bunch of reviews, I decided to order the Shack Stack and a side of cheese fries. The burger was a little smaller than I had anticipated but it was still so good nonetheless! I'm a big mushroom lover so the cheesy mushroom on top of the patty made the entire burger taste delicious. The ingredients tasted pretty fresh too. Even my friend who doesn't like mushrooms really enjoyed the bite she tried! From the rest of my friends' feedback from their orders, it seems like the Shack Stack is the only burger worth getting here. I could be wrong.. But they definitely didn't enjoy their burger as much as I enjoyed mine! So if you're a mushroom fan, definitely get the Shack Stack. It won't disappoint!  

It is a little on the pricier side and definitely not as cheap as In-n-Out but it was good enough that I'll be back again whenever I'm in town next!"}
{"text":"Before going to a concert on the strip tonight we decided to stop here for dinner. Well it was a good choice! The hamburgers were fantastic! I had the portobello shake shack burger. It's a hamburger and a fried portobello cheese stuffed mushroom on top of it will all the fixins. The cheese exploded all over the burger and it was yummy!! Everyone else had the original shake shack double burger and loved them. Burgers are very juicy! Cheese fries were nothing special just cheese fries. Milkshakes were pretty basic also. Next time we come back we gotta try one of there hot dogs! They looked amazing!!"}
{"text":"Satisfying but nothing like experiencing it in New York. 

Lines were nothing like NY. Service was quick. 

Shack Burger - $5.19 - Basic burger. Tasty but I could get 2 In n Out burgers for this price.

Shack Stack - $9.49 - The cheesy portobello patty! Sad it was not gooey this time. Pricey for the size. 

Cheese Fries - $3.95 - Love the elementary school style fries. Soggy cheesy fries are my favorite so I like them.

Overpriced if you compare it to In n Out but still a great place to grab a burger. Good to try if you never been to the NY one."}
{"text":"Second only to my beloved In N Out.  Burgers are juicy and huge!  I wish we had one in the Bay..."}
{"text":"Five stars for the fries!! How anyone can go to In and Out and eat their soggy fries is beyond me! Shake Shack alll the way... (I recommend cheese sauce on the side)"}
{"text":"Okay, so I don't get it. 

For two people, two burgers and fries and two drinks it was $30+.

The burgers are tiny. Like fist sized. Good, but nothing spectacular. 

They're good, just so...small. 

Maybe I'm spoiled by big food or similar sized food that is significantly cheaper, but I just don't get it. Why is it so expensive for fast food? I'm paying for the reputation, right?

Place is nice, people are nice, location is nice. Price sucks."}
{"text":"Considering its location and famous name, the service was decently fast regardless of the long lines. What I like about shake shack is the taste is consistent and great quality regardless of which location I've been too. Their burgers melt in your mouth and the fries are probably one of my favorites. I love this place. Go try it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Not bad. Definitely pricey for a burger and fries. I decided to get the cheese fries which were 3.99 and a regular shack burger single. I also got a small drink. I think it was 15-20? The burger was good, kinda tasted like a thicker Steak 'n Shake burger but less greasy. There sauce is just a mayo mix and horseradish taste. I liked it. The cheese fries were awful. Tasted like cheese wiz in a cheese sauce form but worse. So I'd just stick to the regular fries. They were also a bit salty."}
{"text":"We went in about 30 minutes before closing, we'd been to a show downtown and hubby had heard about this place from some co-workers.  

First, it's very clean and nice seating area.  Loved the tables!  The service was also decent, friendly cashier, so no qualms about that.

Second, surprised at how expensive it was for 2 burgers, fries and drinks.  I had a bottled water, and unless it cost $15, this place is way overpriced.  Especially since their burgers are incredibly thin, so you're not paying for big, thick, juicy burgers.

Third, OMG...how much salt did they use on those burgers?  I didn't even taste anything else on it.  It felt like I had a salt lick on a bun...very unappetizing.  Also, very greasy.  When the little baggy holding the burger is greasy on the outside, you know the burger will be, too.  Hubby took a bite of his, he looked at me and said, \"what am I tasting?\"  I said...\"salt!\"  He nodded and took a sip of his very small shake.  

Four, the reason for the 2nd star...the fries were very crispy.  Which, is unusual for crinkle cut fries.  So, they were actually pretty good.  Although, as I got to the bottom of the fries, they were so oversalted that I had to stop eating them.

Five, we didn't really enjoy our meal.  When my hubby apologizes for bringing me someplace that was recommended to him, I know he didn't like it, either.  We will not be going back..."}
{"text":"Shake Shack delivers!  Ok.....not like to your home, but they surely do provide FLAVOR and SATISFACTION!  I have been dying to try Shake Shack since my fiance visited Las Vegas without me a few months ago, and was so glad to finally squeeze in some time to stop here on our recent visit.

I ordered the Shack Stack, which is a combination of their vegan burger (stuffed portobello mushroom) on top of their signature patty.  Don't judge me....it was my first experience so I wanted to GO BIG!  My boo insisted on ordering their cheese fries and you know I don't argue when it comes to cheese. *heart eye emoji*

For a busy night on the strip, we didn't wait TOO long.  Our burgers were ready in about 5-10 minutes.  I mean, they have a whole army behind the counter cooking!  The portobello mushroom was fried nicely and had a great crispy outer layer, while still remaining moist inside.  The cheese filled center was absolutely delicious!  Crinkle cut fries are my favorite.  Cover it with a creamy cheese sauce and I am a happy girl!  Finally, their house made shandy was the perfect touch for enjoying our burgers in the hot Las Vegas heat!  

The prices are kind of high, but for a restaurant on the strip it's reasonable.  Don't plan to share - portion sizes are just enough."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Shake Shack. What is there not to like, qualities burgers and shakes offered at a fair price. We were excited there will be a Shake Shack closer to the west coast.

I always order the \"Shake Shack Stack.\" It's the best of both worlds, a burger patty and mushroom patty nicely sandwiched between a buttery bun.

Be warn there is usually a line at this establishment."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this is a Postmates issue or Shake Shack's, but considering that all Postmates has to do is pick up and drop off, I'm going to lean towards SS.

I ordered a custom concrete, fries, and a Shack Stack. The fries and Shack Stack were fine - burger was nice and juice, bread soft, cheese gooey, and the fries were nice and crisp. My concrete though? Completely melted and Shake Shack is roughly 2.6 miles from my office. Even if my driver was delayed a little bit, it shouldn't melt completely during a 7 minute drive (according to Postmates). On top of that, after it melted, it literally only filled up half the cup. Shouldn't my concrete be the last thing to be made to preserve it's temperature? Well, I guess I'm lucky that they forgot my napkins and utensils. I ended up having to drink my concrete.

To be clear, it wasn't so much the food, but the way my food was brought to me."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of Shake Shack(I've only been here once). Everyone was super friendly and the restaurant was very clean. The food was great, I ordered a side of fries and an ice cream cone . I'll definitely be trying a burger next time. There was a \"floor manager\" type employee who was always making sure the tables were clean and the condiment station was clean. I really appreciated that role and it is a great investment IMO. Keep up the great work Shake Shack."}
{"text":"what to order: shack double burger and cheese fries
tip: ASK FOR ONIONS!! I love onions and they don't ask so I wasn't aware it was an option.

FINALLY! I got to try the infamous East coast version of In n Out... It was really good, very tasty and surprisingly filling but In n Out has my heart. I also really liked their modern decor and decorating! Very nice.

Shake Shack has a much bigger menu and I would love to try their other items but I went for the simple double party cheeseburger. We also got the cheese fries and regular fries.

The cheese fries were good. My boyfriend said it was too cheesy for his taste but \"too cheesy\" doesn't exist in my world.

The double patty burger looks small but it's quite filling. I love onions in my burger and decided to ask if they had any about half way through, and surprisingly they do! They just don't ask if you would like in your burger (like In n Out does) 

Basically, it's like fancy fast food. Shake Shack is good, but I can't eat it too often like I can with In n Out."}
{"text":"Finally!!!!! I was able to try the burger everyone is raving about. What better place to do it? Las Vegas of course.

We ordered the Shake Shack cheeseburger. Love the way they package their to go orders. 

First bite says it all--Its texture is soft, right away after chewing I knew this burger was good quality beef, so very good. The bun is excellent. However, I couldn't taste the lettuce or tomato, and I couldn't tell if the burger had a sauce/spread. What I could taste was the overpowering salt. Was it the meat or cheese that caused the saltiness? 

All in a all, a good quality burger-- loved the bun, soft warm texture, a bit pricey but I get it. Overall way better than Five Guys (yuck), but In & Out is still the winner. With the Habit a close second--IMO. 

I will definitely try a Shack Burger again is Los Angeles--and give their fries & shake a taste too!

Now on to try Wahlburgers......"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and fries, excellent milkshakes...the wait lines can be horrible because it's a New Thing in Charlotte, but they're always super nice to our dog and the food, as it happens, is worth it. The special sauce is why to come. Ask for extra for the fries.

I'm trying the mushroom burger next. :)"}
{"text":"Would I say that this place is comparable to In N Out? My answer is NO!
Although this place is probably considered fast food, the quality is  just as good as a sit down restaurant.

Shroom Burger: 
This is the vegetarian burger. The meat is replaced by a portobello mushroom, with  some added cheese, the entire thing is then battered and fried until it is crispy. Mmm Mmm GOOD! I am a sucker for fried stuff and this place does it right. The outside of the mushroom was super crispy but not  super oily which is slightly better for my health.  If you decide to try this, BEWARE of the hot cheese when biting into the burger, because that stuff seriously burns!

Fries: 
I am a sucker for thin crunchy fries, unfortunately shake shack's version is crinkle fry which has more potato. I was not very impressed with this, but in this case it was based on a personal preference. 

Frozen Custard:
I got a chance to sample a spoonful of my friend's frozen custard flavors. One of them got the vanilla and it was pretty good, definitely tasted better than the Wendy's freezie. Whereas, another person got the S'more's flavor. This was just alright in my eyes because it was just all chocoate and graham cracker crumbs on top. Personally, I liked the vanilla more out of the two.

Final Verdict: 
This is the first time that I have eaten something like the Shroom Burger, so unless I can find a better variation of it than I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this establishment because we saw some Facebook posts saying how their burgers were worth the long wait. But frankly I don't understand what the hype was all about. Their overpriced average tasting and overcooked burgers may satiate the appetite of a midget or fashion model but my 9 yr old daughter was still hungry after her \"burger\". And what's up with krinkle-cut fries? The last time I saw those were at a school cafeteria served by people wearing hair nets. In & Out kicks the pants out of this place hands-down- and I'm not a big fan of In & Out either."}
{"text":"THANK YOU AGAIN, VEGAS FOOD GOD!  First, you gave us Earl of Sandwhich. And now....Shake Shack!!!

Shake Shack is New York's version of California's In & Out (kinda).  It's considered a fast food joint like In & Out, but the burgers are a bit more gourmet (the bun is soo squishy and soft, noms).  Shake Shack is also a bit more hefty on the wallet for a fast food place.  

I ate a meal at a Shake Shack in New York in 2011, and I seriously have been daydreamin' about eating it again someday.  Someday came when I randomly had a 3 hour layover in Vegas a few weeks ago and boom!  I took a cab (which was quadruple the price of my meal roundtrip) to recreate my love at first bite.  What can I say, love makes you do crazy things.

If you're in Vegas, experience a little bit of New York and order a ShackBurger, Cheese Fries, and a STRAWBERRY custard shake.  (Don't be tempted by other flavors...strawberry!  And if you fall victim to ordering something else, don't say I didn't warn you).  Just a heads up...this meal is about 1500 calories and $23.00 ish.  

Fat belly, skinny wallet...but worttttth it."}
{"text":"The perfect place for guilty pleasures. A nice classic burger, fries and a delicious shake satisfies any craving. A tasty and classic treat!"}
{"text":"Fabulous!  Burgers are soooooo good!  Can be a bit of a wait for food, but that's okay.  Cheese fries are good but get soggy fast.  Black and white malt was great!  Had someone offer to get us refills on sodas and she took our tray for us.  We ate here twice while in town.  I'm going to miss this place when I get back home."}
{"text":"Shake Shake in DTS:

You order at the counter as soon as you walk in then they give you a pager to notify you when your order is ready. There is plenty of seating in the dining area. The dining area is mostly comprised of booths, with some chairs. The entire place appeared to be very clean.

We tried a few different menu items. The bill totaled 43.71 for the following order:

2 - Shack Stack Burger - Good burger, but pretty small for the price.

1 - Chicken sandwich - Pretty good chicken sandwich. I like the pepper taste in the batter. Again, small for the price.

1 - Chicago Dog - I guess it is good if you like Chicago style dogs. I don't care for all of the toppings.

1 - Chicken Dog - the chicken apple sausage dog was good, but I should not have told them to top it like the Chicago dog.

1 - Crinkle Fries - good fries.

I like the fact that the chicken served here is free range and all of the meat is natural (No hormones and no anti-biotics). I would recommend trying this place. The burgers and the chicken are worth coming back for. No more Chicago hot dogs for me."}
{"text":"I'm originally from the East Coast...I should be leaning more towards Shake Shack...but I don't know!

In it's own respect, Shake Shack is good, albeit, a little bit on the pricey side.

I got the Single Shack Cheeseburger, fries, and the 50/50 (aka the Arnold Palmer).

The fries...meh.
Tasted like freshly fried frozen fries. I've had better.

The Arnold Palmer was probably the worst thing I've ever had.

The burger is good.
That bun tho. That bun.
For the price I paid, I wish it was a little heftier.
But the meat was really good and the veggies were fresh.

But I gotta say, In-n-Out wins over everything."}
{"text":"It's almost as good as New York.

Crinkle Cuts and Concretes!

I was craving some comfort food after my team took a narrow loss and their season ended so I headed to Shake Shack. I asked a bunch of people for  directions and nobody noted that the entrance was outside of the casino, but now, you'll know and not suffer the same misery of walking in circles for 15 minutes.

Once we arrived i saw a medium size line, nothing compared to a normal Madison Square Park line though so I could handle it. I also noted that they have a \"C-Line\" for non hot food. It differs from the \"B-Line\" at the original in that you can et Shakes. 

Once i ordered the food was on a similar level to what I'm used to at MSP location. The only weakness was the burger which tasted just a little bit off, but I couldn't figure out exactly why. Even one day later I still can't seem to figure out what was off with the burger. I only finished 3/4 of it before I moved on to the Crinkle Cut fries, which  are just as good as I recall, and happen to be my favorite thing about Shake Shack.

Finally I went on to my Shake Attack. It's my go to concrete and it was spot on. I had the chocolate hazelnut (custard special of the week) subbed in for the normal chocolate custard and it was delicious.

Now for the bad. It is Vegas priced and it seems like it is more than it is in New York. Secondly the staff, though friendly, just don't seem to have the same order taking efficiency as they do in New York. Maybe it's not their fault since most people going to this location aren't regulars, but it was definitely noticeable.

Will I be back? Yes, next time I'm in Vegas I'll stop by for a concrete or crinkle cut fries. 

Is it still worth it to go to the original Madison Square Park location in Flatiron?
Yes, because nothing beats Shake Shack in the park."}
{"text":"While in Vegas I stopped twice here the mushroom burger is delicious. Fries are good too if I'd go back I probably wouldn't get cheese fries. The custard is delicious I had the Elvis custard forgot what it was called but it was so good. The forks for the fries are so cute too."}
{"text":"East Coast versus West Coast. Pac versus Biggie.  Gotham versus City of Angels.  We can now add onto that list: In N Out versus Shake Shack.  And like the other comparisons, there is no real winner.  It all really depends on your mood.

Shake Shack is great because the burgers are cooked by smashing the patty onto a griddle and letting it develop a nice charred crust. The meat is the star of the burger.  The toppings are average.  The bun itself is soft, but it could really use some \"extra toast\" (borrowing from In N Out terminology).  The standout item, and one I am sure everyone knows about, is the \"Shake Stack\".   It is a tremendous construction of a breaded cheesy mushroom patty stacked on top of a regular meat patty.  If you really want to go for gang busters, add bacon for a nominal fee (side note: I really don't give a damn if the WHO thinks processed meats causes cancer). The cheese fries make for a worthy companion.

I would be remiss if I did not toss in my two cents regarding \"who wins\" in a comparison between my beloved In N Out and Shake Shack.  The Shack wins for the superior meat patty, the option to add bacon, and for that glorious mushroom patty.  In N Out has better quality  ingredients and customization options (e.g. toasted buns, grilled onions, chopped peppers).  Taking in the whole experience of eating an In N Out burger, it really is greater than the sum of its parts.  Where it may be lacking to Shake Shack, In n Out's je ne sais quoi keeps it on equal footing.

So where does that leave you?  In N Out? Shake Shack?  Bro, have you not been reading my completely unnecessarily long review?  

West Coasters: Order the Shake Stack with bacon.  Add cheese fries.  Maybe a custard if you have the space.  There is beer if you want it, too.

East Coasters: Order the double double (animal style if you are some monster) with extra toast and chopped peppers.  Animal style fries. Neapolitan shake or root beer float for dessert.

Or, if you are feeling up for it, get both.  Gotta love Vegas."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating at Shake Shack and I was very impressed. My brother was raving about it since the time he tried it in New York. The customer service was outstanding! One of the workers stood by the door and handed us a menu. He took the time to help us choose what we wanted since it was my first time there. The line was extremely short and the menu had a lot to choose from but not an overwhelming amount of items. The cash register person was very professional but I was a little bit confused when she didn't know what a plain cheeseburger was. I got the cheese crinkle fries and they were the best! They tasted a little bit like nacho cheese and the cheese was really smooth and gooey. I got the shakeshackburger and it was ok. The burger was a pretty cold. The patty was just as thin as in n outs but less charred. The veggies were extremely fresh and you could actually taste it. I also got the strawberry milkshake and it was better than in n outs because it was less sugary. All in all, everything was great except I would rather get a burger from in n out. The price was outrageous for a fast food restaurant. The total for me and my brother was $35 and we each got a burger, shake, and cheese fries."}
{"text":"I love Shake shack, from the one on the strip and New York New York to the one actually in New York.

This shake shack conveniently located at the district really excited me, but I may have put my expectations a little high. I think a few set backs this restaurant has is that the staff is not too friendly and for some reason the food felt a little off from the one I'm used to. The beef was a lot flatter and larger than the bun than what I am used to, giving it a little more of a burnt taste. I also feel like my cheese fries were a little raw on the inside.

Overall, this restaurant isn't bad but I think I just got a bad batch. I will likely try it again, but I just wanted people to be aware of the possible experience from this shake shack."}
{"text":"I don't want to sound like a simple peasant, but the best thing I ate while in Vegas last week was at Shake Shack. Had the double w/ fries and was pleasantly surprised. Everything you want in a burger - juicy, beefy, cheesy deliciousness. The prefect way to end a night of drinking and Amy Schumer. I hope this chain goes nationwide."}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable. Really nice staff members and very chill ambiance. We stayed well past closing time and weren't pressured to leave at any time during our stay. Solid service shake shack!"}
{"text":"Yum! I made sure to try out Shake Shack in LV, since I missed out in NYC (where its originally from). So the lines here are always incredibly long, but the process was pretty quick. Didn't have to wait for too long. Nice and open space with many windows and proper seating. Their were many young people here just chowin down on some fancy fast food grub. I opted for the mushroom burger (its a fried mushroom burger with cheese). Felt like eating vegetarian, as its the option I primarily try to choose when dining out. Ordered some fries and the chocolate concrete as well. The food was decent, mushroom burger was a bit on the small side. It was a bit difficult to eat as the mushroom became rubbery and chewing after getting fried. French fries were okay. The chocolate concrete with the chocolate sprinkles was probably the best thing I ate. It was creamy and luscious. Their were a few brownie bits sprinkled in, but definitely not enough. Overall, my experience at Shake Shack was okay, not too bad. I'll definitely try something new off the menu if and when I visit. Supposedly they'll be bringing a location to Houston, TX. Until then!"}
{"text":"Happy day to treat yourself on a shake shack burger!  

Shake shack is on the high end of a burger chain because they serve up wine and have TV screens displaying sports.

I was loving the vibe and outdoor seating area! 

Their signature fries are wedged to uniqueness.  They have milkshakes if you want to add that to your dietary regime!

Staff was nice and line moved fast."}
{"text":"I steer clear of the burger wars.  I'll let people with more skin in the game argue over whether In & Out, Five Guys, Habit, or some other fast-casual chain ultimately comes out on top.

I'll say this, though: Shake Shack is freakin' delicious.

First of all, I'm embarrassed that it took me until 2015 to finally eat at Shake Shack.  I dropped by their Las Vegas location (in front of New York New York) for an early lunch.  There was a short line but it moved quickly.

I had a Shackburger (with added pickle and onions), a small side of crinkle cut fries, and a \"Shack Attack\" concrete (chocolate custard with fudge sauce and chocolate truffle cookie dough).

The food was ready for pick-up within 5 minutes, and in my belly in something like 3 milliseconds.  It was that good.  The burger was juicy, the fries were crispy, and the concrete was decadent.  I left Shake Shack feeling very, very happy.

Prices are some of the best on the Strip.  No up-charges to speak of.  I can't think of anyplace else on the Strip where you can get this caliber of a burger for $5.

I'm pretty much obsessed with Shake Shack now.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll skip so-called \"fine dining\" and eat all my meals here instead.  And I'll Instagram the results in obnoxious detail (natch).

Better yet: Shake Shack could open up a San Diego location.  That would be nice......"}
{"text":"Though I prefer the Shake Shack at NY NY, I like how the lines weren't long here. The service was fast and the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like the place. After hearing about it for years from my sister in NY, I was thrilled when one came to Vegas. Only problem, it is really gross. The burger was blah, the fries were really greasy and overcooked. I think someone new was on the fryer because it seemed like if I'd dropped a fry it might have shattered. The chocolate shake WAS great and I might go back just for a shake. But I'd certainly not order other food."}
{"text":"Came here to eat lunch today. Have had shake shack in New York. Thought we would try this place out. 

Can't really compare this place to In and Out because this place is more on the gourmet side to where In and Out is more on the fast food side. 

I do like Shake Shack but it is a tad overpriced I feel. The Shack Stack Burger is darn good but way too small. I could eat three of these. And their $10.00 each alone! No fries or drink. I'd rather do In and Out. 

The fries are good too. The cheese on them makes them really good. 

My niece got a hotdog and loved it. I had a bite and thought it was just any other hotdog haha. 

Clean place and lots of tv's around if you wanna watch sports or the news. Great burgers and fries if you eat moderate to small portions and are willing to pay a little more than most burger joints."}
{"text":"What's shakin' on the Strip?  The best \"fast\" burger from the East, that's what.

This burger mecca boasts nice clean contemporary interior design and plenty of space.  By far, much pleasanter dining ambiance compared to sterile refridgerated chains.  Primo atmosphere, primo venue.

The double-S serves a very tasty burger:  fluffy soft bun, patty that tastes like really beefy proper ground beef, and all the basic toppings of tomato onions pickle and green leaf lettuce.  I devour it sans condiment.  Yeah, pass on sauce.. inevitably some version of thousand island.  Because when beef is as quality as this, no need to mask it with sauce.  Price point for a standard burger is somewhere between In-n-Out's and Five Guys's.

Don't like burgers?  No worries.  You can get chicken, hot dogs, mushrooms, krinkle-kut fries, frozen custard, milk-shakes... plenty of variety on the menu.

Extra star for easy-to-find location right smack at street level.  No hunting high and low, wending your way through casino mazes.  Shake Shack sports a massive neon sign on New York New York casino.  Practically impossible to miss.

Plus, they are finally FINALLY shaking things up on the burger front lines in California.  WeHo, dtLA and Glendale are scheduled to get their very own Shake Shacks over the next twelve months.  Now what burger-obsessed Angeleno can complain about that?"}
{"text":"I was impressed with this burger joint. The burgers are fresh and juicy with so much flavor. Yes, it's a little pricey, but it's not trying to compare itself to Burger King or McDonalds. People who want quality meat and great service will enjoy this place; people who are value conscious might not like the prices and may look elsewhere. The shakes were amazing, the decor was very ulta modern and the service was very professional, knowledgeable and friendly throughout my experience."}
{"text":"It's safe to say that Shake Shack is a gourmet fast food burger chain. The price screams gourmet, while the service and atmosphere is fast food. Of course, your first time here, the name tells you to get a burger and shake, right? I ordered the single Shack Burger, a side of fries, and a strawberry shake, totaling to roughly $15. 

The burger was juicy and flavorful thanks to the Shake Shack sauce. Fries were fresh and crispy, the better end of the spectrum of crinkle cut fries. Shake was above average, I mean you can't really go wrong with a shake. 

The overall meal was really good and served fresh. The only downside to Shake Shack is the size of the burger."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of excitement over this place so decided to give it a try.   I heard it was the In and Out of the east coast.    The burger was good, on par with In and Out, Smashburger and 5 Guys.  

The main difference is the price.   Holy shnikes.  Over $15 for a burger, fries and drink.    I'd give it 3 1/2 stars for food and 1 star for price."}
{"text":"It's nice to have Shake Shack in the neighborhood! I, for one, love Shake Shack, but I'm not crazy-impressed by it either.

Food is great! The 'Shroom burger is their vegetarian option with a crispy and juicy portobello patty. The vegetables taste fresh, and there's gooey, melty cheese that oozes out as you take bites from your palm-sized burger. Some may find it's size relatively small, but I think it's a healthy portion.

A burger, a side of fries, and a milkshake is a good combination that will satisfy the average sized person! If the portion were any bigger, I would feel unhealthily full! (Psst! You know exactly what I'm talking about! It's that, \"I just got hit by a truck\" feeling after gorging on junk food!) And side note, I love cheese, but I definitely prefer the fries without it. If this review were based on food alone, I'd give it a solid 5 stars!

Now, why is it a 4 and not a 5? Well, I was put off by the customer service, which is indeed essential for a prime dining experience. The place just opened, and I understand they need to work out some kinks, but I didn't enjoy the atmosphere of the place either. The walls do not absorb enough sound, so the noise levels were a little high for my sensitive ears, and it pales in comparison to the more spacious Strip location. These are the reasons why it is a 4-star overall rating from me.

Also! I've noticed others mentioning the price... I expected that and accepted it, as I've been to Shake Shack before and understand that it needs to maintain the image of a more \"upscale\" fast casual restaurant (which also explains the trendy, industrial decor). 

Overall: Shake Shack is definitely my choice for a burger treat! I can always take my burger outside in their nice little patio :-)"}
{"text":"It was okay, love the tables were made from a part of a bowling lane.. The Shake Cago Dog was ok... I prefer Sonic's Chicago dogs better!  The restaurant was freezing- it was cold outside and cold in there. My hot dog was not as temperature heat wise  I would have preferred  Everyone kept their jackets on.  My husband had the Shake Stack which was very tasty but with a price tag of $9.49 it should have been.   Interesting size of drinks too?  Regular looked more like a small.   We had one of their Concrets Dairy Queens Blizzards are way better."}
{"text":"The burger meat reminded me of McDonald's meat (which I don't mind, just made me wonder why I didn't go there for a cheaper burger). Condiments are much better than typical burger joints. Fries looked and tasted like the fries you can buy from the frozen section, but the cheese made them taste better. Milkshake was pretty dang good. 
Apparatus was maybe a little too loud, but it was clean. 
Price was probably more expensive than what it should have been, but this is probably due to it being located on the strip."}
{"text":"As if vegas needs another burger place........

But fortunately, shake shack is a solid addition to the vegas scene.  I had the shack stack which is essentially a bacon burger with some spicy condiment added.  Very delicious.  The crinkle cut fries are nice and crispy.  The shakes are super thick and very yummy.  

Service is phenomenal and why shouldn't it be with over 20 staff on duty either behind the counter, greeting at the door or cleaning tables.  Everyone we encountered was pleasant and genuinely seemed like they enjoyed their job."}
{"text":"Over-hyped and over-priced for just sub par quality burgers and fries.

Sadly, Kierland got greedy and took the money for this place to be built, getting rid of the beautiful fountain and park that was there before."}
{"text":"I don't think you can really call anything at Scottsdale Fashion Square a \"shack.\" ;) Especially this modern looking behemoth of a building! I had heard of Shake Shack in various parts of the country, so when I heard they were opening up a location here I knew I had to check it out to see what the hype was about!

The menu consists of various burgers, fries, hot dogs, and various shakes. Each menu item has the caloric count on it so you know exactly how much you are cheating on your diet :). I tried some of the chick 'n shack, had a 'shroom burger, and had a black and white shake. 

The chicken sandwich was delicious, with crispy and tender meat, soft potato bun, with toppings that went well with each other. The 'shroom burger had a batter that was light and crispy, with a well seasoned portobello mushroom. While overall it was a good tasting vegetarian burger, I didn't really like the gooey cheese that went with it. 

The burgers themselves are a bit small but the quality of the ingredients make up for it.

The shake was a perfect thickness, easy to sip through a straw, with rich chocolate and vanilla flavor.

My order took only a few minutes to be made and I was out the door in no time!

Overall it's a tasty option for a meal if you're at the mall."}
{"text":"I said I'd be back. I couldn't be out here and not stop by. This time I went simple a double cheese burger, boy oh boy! Simply delicious. So glad I came out. Simply amazing"}
{"text":"I love this Shake Shack location way more than the Fashion Square location. Everyone here is soooo FRIENDLY. It's also VERY CLEAN. Food tastes AMAZING. My Go-To is te Smoke Shack with everything except pickles (I don't like pickles on my burgers), a lemonade drink and bacon cheese fries! There's treating seating and again the customer service is just wonderful they're all so nice and very helpful and so kind. Even though I would consider shake shack to be a more \"high-end fast food chain\" their attitudes are so humble and warming. I've gone in after my 9:45pm class down town. (Keep in mind I'm a student who barely a gets sleep so I'm usually \"bumming it\") I don't feel judged or feel out of place since they are always so welcoming no matter what. It's honestly my one favorite places to eat after class or after work on Saturday. 
Keep up the amazing work Shake Shack Crew!"}
{"text":"I work right down the road and I am unsure how I have missed this place. I have even been in the parking lot for other businesses multiple times. My wife and I drove into central Phoenix to find dinner one night, and the place we were going was closed. We kept going trying to decide. I picked another spot, but didn't see it in time and drove past. I kept going to turn around and instead found this place. We were there so thought why not. It was a good accident. We both enjoyed our burger. She had a milkshake and I had the beer brewed for them. I would definitely go back now that I see it is just a few miles from work."}
{"text":"I wanted to see what the hoopla is all about. Well, I'm still trying to figure it out. The Shack Stack was what I ordered and it was good. But I definitely had better tasting hamburgers (aka The Habit & In N Out).

As for the price, to much in my opinion. $10 for that hamburger? For a couple more bucks, I would have gotten a better tasting burger at Red Robin. I'll pass next time I come across this place in Vegas (and New York if I ever visit that part of the woods)."}
{"text":"The line was out the door! I went on Monday because we decided to check out Pinecrest. They were kinda slow but other than that it was lit! I don't particularly care for their hopscotch ckncrete. But my sandwhich and fries were delicious. They didn't have much seating however. Reccomend on a day less busy"}
{"text":"Customer service top notch I ordered the Shack Stack & Cheese fries. The portobello was too salty though. May have been a fluke. My wife ordered the shroom burger & she said it was good. Cheese fries were just OK. Would order regular fries next time. 
Tons of tv's everywhere. Very cool."}
{"text":"I have heard nothing but good things about this place and people have even compared it to my beloved In-N-Out...so best believe I had to come give it a try when I came to town! I definitely had high hopes but left feeling just okay. :'( 

Here we go: 
Shack stack - This is a cheese burger with a deep fried portobello mushroom filled with cheese, shack sauce, and your typical lettuce and tomato. It looked so good in pictures and the first bite definitely was glorious but I grew rather tired of it after 3 bites in. This burger was just too hearty and rich for me! Not being dramatic at all, but my heart felt heavy after the few bites. All the cheese was rather overwhelming, even for a burger lover like myself. The shack sauce was definitely too rich...as it tasted like it was just pure mayonnaise. The only reason I finished the burger was because it was $9.49. 

Double down fries - These are crinkle cut fries topped with cheese, bacon, and red peppers. I love my fries, do not get me wrong...but these were just meh, nothing to rave about. The portion was pretty generous but the price is still steep for what it is...for ~$9. 

Vanilla shake - Sadly, I think this was the highlight of my meal. The consistency was just right: not too thick and definitely not runny. Kept me pretty refreshed in the 103 degree weather this weekend. 

I'm glad I got to try this place out, but nothing compares to my beloved In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Nothing to wait on line for. Was a more expensive version of In and Out and the fries were not as good. The burger was tasty, but chicken was so-so. Liked the fact we could have a beer and Sonoma Coutrer. If this was the only game in town that's one thing, but Old Town Scottsdale has so many options. Just a few doors down  the Z burger @ Z Tejas would be my burger choice @ the mall."}
{"text":"My wife and I and our two boys went to Shake shack for the first time tonight. I had heard a lot about it on the radio because I listen to talk radio that's based in New York City and they rave about Shake shack all the time. So when when we were driving up Central to go to get some tacos and we saw that Shake shack was now open we were pretty excited.  We got lucky because when we got there there was no line but it filled up quickly. We ordered on the staff was friendly and the food came out fairly quickly. The burgers were hot, cheese was melty, and the fries were perfect crinkle cut fries.  It lived up to all the hype plus one of the girls working there (Emma) was so nice and telling us all about the shakes and even brought us a sample of their new pretzel flavor.  She was so nice and another reason we can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Great burger - dare I say...Better than In and Out????  I know - I feel like a traitor, but its just that good!  The only thing is that they are expensive for what you get - we got 2 burgers, 2 drinks, and 1 order of fries for almost $30 - that seems pricey for fast food."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is great. The burgers are good.  We first had it in New York and had to have it when we saw it in Vegas.  I'm always torn as to whether it is better than In-N-Out and I just recently heard that the quality of beef is much better at Shake Shack which definitely makes my decision easier.  We will definitely be having it again."}
{"text":"They have a solid system and even though it may look like a zoo when you first arrive, you will get your food fairly quickly. Beyond that, I found it to be just an upscale McDonald's. It's definitely not good for you and the burger made my stomach angry at me. It's ok for a once a year visit I guess, but for me personally, I could never make this place a staple."}
{"text":"Fries are the best around.  Hamburger kinda looks a little sad but is delicious.  I also got a float not that good but gotta try a shake.  Would definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas, super yummy!!! All my friends enjoyed the place too. Plenty of seating and friendly staff !!"}
{"text":"You can't beat the price for the food!! Love that it was fast, cheap and very good!! Hope we can eat here one more time before our trip ends!!"}
{"text":"Been here before for their shake shack burger which I liked. But i never got to try a shake...til now. (Actually last week)

They actually have an express line for MGM Platinum or higher players.

I ordered a peanut butter shake then the girl asked if I wanted to mix it with chocolate.......hmmm.....hell yeah! Good suggestion. 

My only negative, there's only one size! Need to add a larger serving!"}
{"text":"Good customer service! Food ehh. Is it the In n Out of the East...maybe. But I had high hopes for this place and when I finally got a glimpse of my hopes were soon crushed. First, the size. It's small. So buy 2, 3, 4...single burgers for sure! Fries were good. Hot and Crispy! Shake was good. Got the black and white. Again SMALL! Good was juicy but definitely not greasy like other places.  Overall, these items match NYC apartment sizes. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm in love with shake shack. That is not a joke, they do not compare to others they are above all. 

We went at opening on a Wednesday afternoon there was no one in line, score. It's my husbands first time, and mine.... I've lost count. 
We go wild here, shackburgers, chili dog, chicken sandwiches, cheese fries, apple pie shake and a blonde beer. 
HEAVEN on earth. 
They hand us the buzzer machine. 
The wait gives me mixed feelings of impatience and hungry anticipation. Hunger is a real thing for me. 
Finally, a few minutes later, we get to dig in! It looks beautiful. It smells delicious. The apple pie shake tastes like thanksgiving day desert in a cold glass. 
We eat every bite with no regrets. There are no photos, no evidence, no calories. 
Just bliss."}
{"text":"So good
Cheeseburger is great
Chicken sandwich is great
Fries are great
The vibe is fun and the service is really good for the pricepoint the food is at"}
{"text":"My husband and I loved the atmosphere here. It was loud enough to bring your kids. The food was excellent and the prices were just right !"}
{"text":"I've always loved Shake Shack. They never disappoint! To me it's worth the line. I even got a free ice cream this time"}
{"text":"I love the burgers and shakes here. The patty is always cooked to perfection and the fries are on point. I especially like the fresh lettuce and tomatoes in the burgers. The shroom burger is delicious with the cheese-filled mushroom; it's also vegetarian. If you want more substance, go for the ShackStack (it's basically a shroom burger plus a patty). The shakes are always good. One thing that sticks out from the menu to me is the purple cow float, though I haven't tried it yet.

If you feel like your shake is too thick to enjoy with a burger, they have complimentary water next to the condiments.

Location is convenient, next to the parking lots. Entrance is kind of weird. Use the door on the right when you walk into the vestibule and it takes you right up to the line to order, but be ready to order otherwise you'll be awkwardly standing off to the side while you glance at the menu on the wall!"}
{"text":"Great, very beefy tasting burger. Fries were crispy and delicious. Custard was good. Very clean, great service. We ordered one of every burger and everyone liked their food. I'm excited to try the hot dog next time."}
{"text":"My east coast savvy-friends have raved about Shake Shack for a while, so needless to say I was very excited to try it out upon arriving to Vegas this weekend. And boy, it did not disappoint! Can't wait to have it again.

For a Friday afternoon in Vegas, the wait for Shake Shack was not as busy as one would think, but it was still very packed in the seating areas. We were in line to order for about 10 minutes, and were able to find a table and retrieve our food in about 15. While in line the staffmember was very helpful with familiarizing us with the menu, and even playfully invited us to compare the experience with In-N-Out (which I will get to later)!


* Food * 
Our party ordered a number of yummy menu items. 

Savory
1) ShackBurger - Has lettuce, tomato and Shack Sauce, and is possibly the most comparable to an In-N-Out cheeseburger. The patty is MINDBLOWINGLY delicious. I miss it already. 

2) SmokeShack - A unique burger that features Shake Shack's signature red peppers. Any burger with bacon gets an A+, and this is no exception.

3) Cheese Fries - Crinkle cut fries topped with a special, creamy American and cheddar cheese sauce (TIP: Ask for bacon and red peppers on top!).

Sweet
1) Neapolitan Shake - My love asked for a combination of the strawberry, chocolate and vanilla frozen custards and they gladly complied. Possibly the best neapolitan shake I've tried.

2) Blueberry Concrete (Flavor of the Week) - A concrete is a more dense version of the shake (think McFlurry's from McDonald's... but 10x better). This concrete had blueberries mixed in and it was wonderful.

3) *HIGHLY RECOMMENDED* Shack Attack Concrete - By far one of the best chocolate desserts I've ever ordered. This concrete was creamy, chocolatey, and filled with plenty of delicious mix-ins such as sprinkles, dark chocolate chunks and chocolate truffle cookie dough.  


* The Verdict: Shake Shack vs. In-N-Out * 
After discussing it with my friends post-meal, I have decided that the two burger chains do not invite comparison with one another bc they're in entirely different, elite leagues. SORRY if that's not what you want to hear! While their menus seem similar and their burgers are similar sizes size, their offerings, quality and taste are both on another level.

As a born and raised SoCal girl, my heart will forever love In-N-Out. There's nothing like a classic #3 hamburger, protein style with animal style fries and a chocolate shake. But their desserts do not hold a candle to Shake Shack's epic frozen treats menu. Shake Shack admittedly has a more extensive menu, so their prices do not compare to In-N-Out's affordable menu. 

Overall - head to Shake Shack for more menu options and great flavor and taste, but if you're looking for simple, classic and tasty options for the best value, then In-N-Out is the way to go."}
{"text":"Long, long line!!! And very limited seating!!! But so worth the wait. Best burgers & hotdogs we've had!!! Glad we finally have SS in AZ!!! The cheese fries are a hit!!"}
{"text":"Best burger place hands down!!!! 
My entire family is obsessed!!! I haven't had anything I don't like. Cheese fries are to die for!!"}
{"text":"Great burger, fries were good.  A little pricey for burgers and fries.   Would go again for sure."}
{"text":"Would you like some flies to go with that shake?  My last visit to Shake Shack was probably my last, at least until after fly season is over. There were flies everywhere.  The problem is that their doors stay open all the time because their ordering area is too small to accommodate a significant amount of people, so the line out the door holds the doors open for the flies.  The flies don't even have to wait in the line like everyone else; they just fly in and start eating. SS really needs to do something to address this unsanitary condition. 

As for the food,  the burger was pretty good, but too small for the price. The chocolate shake was good, but pathetically small.  I can't believe that they only offer the shakes in what is essentially a kid's size when the place is called \"Shake Shack\". \"Tiny Shake Shack\" would be a better name. You can get a much better meal deal across the parking lot at the Soda Shop - better food, better quantity, better price, and a delicious, grown-up-sized shake."}
{"text":"What's with all the hype?

I watch a lot of CNBC. And within that context, I have been hearing a lot about Shake Shack in recent months. The hype got me curious--but I am not going to travel from CA to the East Coast for a hamburger.  So while in Las Vegas, I made a deliberate trip to the Shake Shack location on The Strip, on the New York New York casino property.

I visited on a Saturday night at about 11:00pm. The place was packed - not a surprise. The kitchen staff was active, and they had staff to constantly clean the dining room to accommodate the turnover of patrons.  The décor was very nice: modern, bright, and very inviting. This location had a both indoor and outdoor seating. There is a patio misting system to cool the outdoor dining area.

Since I knew nothing of this chain, I stuck to the basics:  I ordered a Double Shack Burger with cheese; \"standard fries\", and a vanilla milk shake.

The vanilla shake:  It was a very good vanilla milk shake. I cannot say that it is the best I have ever had, but it was not poor, and definitely better than mediocre.

The French fries:  Their offering of French fries is the \"crinkle cut\" variety. When served, the French fries were hotter than warm--but not \"piping\" hot. I was surprised. Based on the rate at which the kitchen was turning out orders, I would have thought that the fries would have been \"freshly hot\". They were warm and flaky on the inside, with just a slight \"crunch\" to the surface. I was not disappointed--but not impressed either.

The \"Shack Burger\":  I am sure that they have some story about their hamburger bun. The first thing that I noticed was that the upper and lower halves were conjoined, like a clam shell. The standard double burger had two patties, cheese, lettuce and tomato, along with their signature sauce. The hamburger was nice and hot--surprising, since the fries were not. The beef was juicy and flavorful.  All in all, it is a very good hamburger.  

But while eating the Shack Burger, the flavor palate reminded me of another burger I have eaten. Then it struck me:  the Shack Burger's tastes a lot like an \"In-and-Out\" burger. The flavors of the Shack Burger are a bit lighter, not as strong, but the resemblance is there.

The total bill for my meal was a little over $17.00. (If I wanted the same combo at In-and-Out, the cost for my meal would have been about $7.00.)
 
All said, it is a good hamburger. This location is very nice if you are already on The Strip, and are seeking eating options. I just don't understand what all the hype is about this chain."}
{"text":"I was born in New York and currently reside in Las Vegas.  I can't imagine this Shake Shack getting any review less than 5 stars!  If it allowed me, I'd give it a hundred stars for this location!

First off, if you are a Mlife platinum member you don't have to wait in the long line, luckily if you show your card at the door, you'll have your own!  Then when I got to the counter, I was greeted by an extremely nice, personable cashier named Michael.  Patient and knowledgeable about the burgers and hot dogs, he kindly took my order.  I truly wanted to tip him, but every which way, he refused to accept it!  After receiving my order from the pick up station and selecting my table, I was nicely greeted by Dorian, whom I believe was a busser perhaps.  He was extremely attentive to all the tables and was very observant towards everyone's needs!  He kept all the tables really clean and was very sincere and personable, too.  By far, there was excellent customer service overall!  

Now about the food, I prefer the double meat patties, because you can really taste the freshly grilled flavor of the meat.  If you like your burger with some kick to it, there are options to accommodate your taste.  Also they're shakes are really tasty too.  If you're not full yet, which I truly doubt, you must try their extremely smooth frozen custard.  It's really delicious and yummy ending to your experience there!"}
{"text":"As a disclaimer, I have never been to the NYC location. This was my first time trying out the chain. I've had just about every major fast-food hamburger and fries. You name it, In&Out, Fatburger, FiveGuys, Culvers, SteaknShake, Whataburger, etc...I am giving this experience in the \"fast-food burger\" category 5 stars. The service was prompt. The Shackburger double melted in my mouth. All the ingredients were complementary with each other from the bun to the burger to the condiments(Umami). The strawberry shake was right-on, plus I love crispy crinkle fries. I will be back! I hope they have a stand-alone building near Eastern so I don't have to drive to the strip!"}
{"text":"Can't beat this place !! Burgers are amazing and cheese fries are too die for. 
If you don't want a cheeseburger try their fried chicken sandwich it is equally amazing."}
{"text":"Shack burger + fries + chocolate shake = the American (hormone-free) Dream. Burger has no weird after taste from meat and cheese, shake isn't too sweet and fries are not over-salted. Excellent blend of goodies for a meal. No grilled onions available but I like this place over in-n-out any day :)"}
{"text":"There wasn't anything special about the burgers I'm not sure what the shack sauce taste like because were pickled peppers in my burger that over powered any other flavor and spent most of my time spitting out pepper seeds.  The cheese fries were good."}
{"text":"I actually enjoyed my cheeseburger. My friend let me try her fries and i liked it. I ended up finishing her fries. This isn't my favorite burger place but it definitely beats johnny rockets."}
{"text":"Our first time eating shake shack and it was delicious! I think I like it better than in n out! And I'm a big fan of their crinkle fries!"}
{"text":"It was just ok. Lots of hype but not a lot of substance. The shroom burger was disappointing. As soon as I bit into it all the molten cheese drained out leaving me with a greasy, bland, fried mushroom on bread. A veggie burger would have been preferred. The hotdogs were a big hit with my kids but I had to use a napkin to soak up the grease. My husband had the smokestack and said it was good but nothing special. The fries were good--crispy and delicious, but not enough cheese on the cheese fries. The concrete was really good in the center where all the goodies were concentrated but the outside was a waste. Decent strawberry shake--wish they had kids sizes."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas for EDC weekend and my group and I were trying to figure out what to eat for lunch. We heard a lot of our friends talk about the Shake Shack so we decided to give it a try.

The Shake Shack has a really nice contemporary vibe with many seating areas, inside and out. 

I got the cheese burger with bacon and got cheese fries with bacon on top.

The burger was really good. It had so much flavor in it. I wanna say it's almost or equally as good as In-N-Out Burgers, and that's saying something.

The reason for the loss of star is because i ordered an ice cream cone but I was given a chocolate shake instead. Normally, it wouldn't be a problem, but I also ordered a drink. So I basically had two drinks.

But overall, a great place to eat, especially if you're drunk or recovering from a hangover from the night before."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, GMO free all at a great price point.

My favorite is the Smoke Stack!!! Oh hello cherry peppers!! Mmm mm good. This is not your typical burger joint, these guys don't fit into a cookie cutter category and if you've had Shake Shack you know what I mean. Each burger is made of 100% Natural Angus beef and served on a non-GMO potato roll. You can ask for your choice of lettuce, tomato, pickles and onion and I believe there's no up charge. With that I always get their famous crinkle cut fries with cheese. Ohhh mah gaw, shut the front door! These fries make my heart sing, literally my heart screams with such love and hate as it may not be the healthiest choice but it's darn tasty!! Excuse me while I wipe away my drool...

And I'm back...

Customer Service is so good, too! Those working at the counters aren't rude or rushing to take your order like other like establishments. 

The Shackmeister Ale is also a tasty one which is brewed by Brooklyn Brewery. 

This review could go on and on about how much love I have for the Shake Shack brand but I'll end it here and hopefully I've convinced you just how much you should fly to your nearest Shake Shack, I believe SoCal has the nearest location to Hawaii. They are coming further west so let's hope Hawaii is on their next destination list."}
{"text":"I'm a big in-and-out fan (who everyone always compares it to), but I'm definitely a fan of this place as well. I wanted the cheeseburger, but I also wanted the mushroom burger and guess what? They have one called the Shack Stack. Uhm. Score! FYI - the mushroom is fried and that in combination with the cheeseburger and shack sauce was amazing. The burger was really good, but the fried mushroom was the best part. Unfortunately, I ate this before going to a day club, but the burgers aren't that big (that's actually the unfortunate news).

Overall, I'm a fan! The fries and shakes are really good as well!"}
{"text":"My friends told me about his place, it was all hype. The burgers are pretty small and expensive. I ordered the double smoke shack and it pretty okay. I don't think it's that worth, maybe just to try. I also got the jackpot custard and it was pretty good as well. It's a bit busy and crowded but we were able to find seats.

Cool place to go to for the hype if you're visiting Vegas, but idk if I'll come back."}
{"text":"When I'm usually craving a burger and want it at it's best quality, my Go-To is always \"In n Out\" 

However in my opinion, Shake shack's burgers outscales In n out's burgers by a long shot. 

A burger and fries at In n Out is always fresh, and the quality is always A1, but these two burger joints just don't weigh on the same scale. I've been to Shake Shack many times and I'm surprised a lot of my homies haven't been here. So when I decided to take them here they were BLOWN away by the taste! The feeling of the burger literally melting in my mouth is what drove me to write a 5 Star review!

All the employees want satisfaction, and we are always welcomed with the best care. 

Fresh never less, and the quality is beyond belief.

This place is a bit pricy, and since they do not offer combos everything is bought separately. 2 apparent Shack burger combos came out to over $31. 

You get what you pay for and what I got was quality and supreme satisfaction.

The bill a tad bit higher than usual but hey, it's worth it and once in a while is ok. 

Will return!"}
{"text":"Great location,friendly service,sub par food. Nothing to get excited about.
Small overpriced burgers. 2 burgers,2 shakes,1 order fries  = $31.00. 
Burgers were small with little to brag about. Shakes were nothing special.Fries were lousy. Don't know how these places survive with nothing
that makes you want to return for more. I'm one and done!! Smash Burger puts this place to shame!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after a morning sightseeing stroll with friends. Right when you walk in, you receive a menu to look at while you wait in line, which is better than zoning out staring at the large menu board while the line moves and you're still...just staring.

I ordered the Shack Stack, which is a cheese burger with a Shroom burger on top (deep fried portabella mushroom filled with muenster and cheddar cheese) with lettuce, tomato, and its Shacksauce. Plus, an order of crinkle fries.

It wasn't a large (circumference-wise) burger, but it was packed thick. The fried portabella was very good, especially with the two cheeses oozing out. But it ate very, very rich and heavy when you add the flavorful and juicy cheeseburger underneath. For me, I needed a lot of ketchup to balance the burger out. It was still very delicious though! The best part of the burger was the bread because the outside was soft and the inside was very crispy and stayed that way throughout, which is amazing with the sauce on there and the gooey cheese.

Seeing crinkle fries, I was hesitant about it as I automatically see them as those store-bought frozen kind where you throw it in the oven, and the end result is either mushy fries or super hard, dry, and tasteless fries. I'm sure they were frozen once, but these fries were super good! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and very well-seasoned with the right amount of salt.

This place had a more modern feel to it. The seating area was comfortable and spacious. There was a LOT of people just working registers. They literally stood shoulder to shoulder taking customer's orders. There were also a few workers, bussers more like, standing around and waiting to grab your empty tray to take to the trash.

Overall, the burger was more on the heavy side with the cheeses and fried portabella, but it was a delicious burger. Plus, the fries were very good. It's kind of pricey considering it's just a burger joint locating outside on New York, New York Hotel. I think it's a decent once-in-a-while place to eat, but not a must return visit if you're not from here."}
{"text":"Couldn't come to Vegas without a visit to Shake Shack. Just stopped in for dessert and ordered a peanut butter and chocolate shake and the shake attack. I would say both are good and worth ordering but would I say they are anything special? No they are just good...they taste like they are made from scratch ingredients and not something that comes out of a machine so therefore it's good. I don't know what more I was expecting..."}
{"text":"Over rated.....Way over priced food. Noise level to high."}
{"text":"The fast food playing field is changing drastically. The era of fast food chains getting away with serving mediocre food cooked in greasy oil with impersonal service in a sterile environment designed to get you in and out is facing intense competition from the newer generation of fast food chains. This new generation of fast food chains is being led by Shake Shack, Five Guys, and Smash Burger. 

   After hiking in Calico Basin and the streets of Downtown Summerlin, my brother and I were up for a post-hike dinner in Shake Shack. I had been looking forward to biting into a Smokestack burger. In recent times, I had visited Shake Shack four times and  developed an appreciation for their Smokeshack burger. 

   Just like downtown Summerlin is the future of the regional shopping mall, Shake Shack is the future of the fast food restaurant. My experience describes dining in a futuristic fast food restaurant. After ordering from the menu on the wall (not over a counter), the friendly cashier presented me with a beeper. Instead of waiting by a counter for other people, or hearing order numbers go off, the gentle buzz of a beeper went off when the food was ready. The dining room is an environment that encouraged me to relax. This is totally disparate from a sundry of the fast food restaurants walled with plate glass windows overlooking the highway where the psychological message has been to eat up and get back on the road. In Shake Shack the interior feels more like a casual full service restaurant than a fast food restaurant. From my table I overlooked a couple of close caption HD TV sets playing football and \"Shriek.\" If it was a warm day, I could of sat outside in the patio overlooking the beautiful arroyo park in downtown Summerlin. Whether I sat inside or outside, there was an employee offering to dump my garbage. And if I really wanted to relax, instead of a Coke with my crinkly fries, I could have enjoyed a draft beer. Biting into a Smokestack burger was more than enough to make me relax. 

    Shake Shack has been consistent with quality. In similar fashion to the past three visits the Smoke Shack burger elevated my taste buds. That 100% angus beef between two soft buns were the delicious prime ingredients that complimented Applewood bacon, red peppers, and that mysterious Shake Shack sauce. The crinkly cut fries were good but not Nathan's greatness. 

   It seems that Las Vegans including yours truly Daniel. S love Shake Shack. But Shake Shack is doing a Winco business strategy where they build a couple of restaurants that require  people to drive a distance to come to them. Currently the only other Las Vegas location is in New York - New York. 

  Speaking of New York - New York, I want to clarify a major Shake Shack misconception. There is a misconception that Shake Shack is the IN N Out Burger of New York and they are all over the New York metropolitan area. Not true at all. I grew up in New York and never heard of them. Throughout my young adulthood there was a few locations in the city. Only recently did they expand to the Suffolk County suburbs of New York. They are totally different from IN N Out. Shake Shack goes for around $12 where In N Out is about half the price. Shake Shack offers several different items where In N Out offers a few. From growing up in New York, I feel thar White Castle would be comparable to IN N Out.

  On the other hand what is the antithesis of a misconception is that Shake Shack is fantastic. With all the four star reviews including this one, it is foreseeable to walk into this futuristic fast food restaurant and set eyes on the \"People Love Us on Yelp\"  sticker."}
{"text":"When you step inside Shake Shack you are setting foot inside the casual fast food restaurant of the future. This is a futuristic fast food restaurant where people can eat fast food while watching professional sports on the overhead television sets, where instead of waiting on a long line to pick up your food, you can sit on a circular bench while watching sports until your beeper alerts you know it is ready. This past weekend, on the Sunday where Green Bay played Seattle in the Super Bowl playoffs, I spent some time inside the fast food restaurant of the future. 

  Shake Shack is located at the northern periphery of the New York New York property near the Monte Carlo. In the very near future, Shake Shack will be a Gateway business to the Park, the exciting entertainment complex that will link the Las Vegas Strip to the Arena. 

  When I visited Shake Shack, it was understandably busy. People are saying it is the In N Out Burger of the East Coast. When people say that a fast food place is the In N Out Burger of the East Coast, a long line is guaranteed. This was a long line that moved fast. This was my first impression of sharp management. The line is a small room with a wall of menu boards (pictures are below). I am impressed with the selection. Their menu includes hamburgers, hot dogs,  crinkle cut fries, concrete, shakes, wine, beer. At the end of the line, a friendly person took my order. After paying, he presented me with a beeper. Once the beeper would go off, I  would pick up my food at the pickup window. I'd plant myself on the circular bench to watch the Super Bowl playoffs. What's really neat is that there is a gigantic HD screen covering a good part of the wall above the condiments. 

  After picking up the food, there was fortunately a table. The dining room is decent size with a modern interior. In addition to the dining room are the outside seats along the Strip. With the staff persistent on cleaning the tables, and dumping your trash, Shake Shack is a clean place to eat. 

  Decisions! Decisions! I ordered the Smokeshack Burger with crinkle cut fries, and a Coke Zero. The cost was nearly double than In N Out. The Smokestack burger made up of Angus meat was out of this World. I savored the cheese, applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and Shack sauce. This is the second best burger I had in recent times (my favorite is Portillos in Chicago). The crinky cut fries I felt were good, yet inferior to Nathan's. I hear the shakes are phenomenal. After trying Boulevard Creamery nearby, I might be delaying their shakes for an indefinite period. 

  Is Shake Shack the New York In N Out? 
    After eating here and having grown up in New York, I feel that Shake Shack is more comparable to Nathan's than In N Out. Shake Shack is higher priced than In N Out, features more items, serves crinkle cut fries, and in several ways is just different. White Castle would be a better comparison between a New York fast food restaurant and In N Out. In my opinion Shake Shack doesn't have a large presence in the New York metropolitan area. For the record, there are more Nathan's and White Castles in New York than Shake Shacks. Currently , there is only one Shake Shack in Long Island, NY. Shake Shack started in 2004, where White Castle and Nathan's were established in my grandparents generation. 

  Regardless that Shake Shack, from my perspective is no East Coast In N Out, it is a futuristic fast food restaurant that is fun to hang out in. It was a ball to share in the Super Bowl playoffs while enjoying delicious food. I never had this experience in McDonald's or Burger King. 

  I am a fan of Shake Shack. It is nice to go into a fast food place watch a game until the beeper goes off, enjoy quality food while watching a game. It is nice to have friendly employees take my order and volunteer to dump my trash. I can see Shake Shack in my check-in future."}
{"text":"Everyone seems to love this place.  They have tons of great 5 star reviews.  The prices are good, great even considering it's on the strip.  It reminds me of Culver's or Freddy's back home.  They have the thin burger patties, kinda overly greasy.  This is just a preference thing, I'd rather a thicker, juicy (not greasy) burger.  
You wait in line and order, then you wait in line to pick it up.  Everything considered I'd give them three stars because although the prices were crazy cheap the burger was just ok and as far as chains go I'm not huge on the smashed flat burger patties (except for In n Out)."}
{"text":"So good and such an awesome treat! The burgers are buttery and juicy, the buns are super soft, and the fries are perfectly crispy. I can't wait to go back for burgers again in the future! 

This location is a great one if you're a Shake Shack fan, there is a lot of parking around the district area, and the restaurant has a pretty large dine-in area. 

The food is really good and tastes very fresh, and they have options for those that don't want a burger. They offer a chicken sandwich, a portobello mushroom burger (meatless), hot dogs, and they also have a gluten free bun option. We've enjoyed both standard burgers and the portobello mushroom one but I can't wait to go back and try the chicken sandwich too. I haven't had the shakes or frozen custard at this location, but the frozen custard I've had at the location down on the strip was really good so I imagine it is going to be superb at this location too. 

One of my favorite things about the shake shack is that they have draft root beer. It is definitely the superior way to serve root beer and I am so excited to have a place to go and get a cup of it! 

Ultimately, we really enjoyed our dinner at the Shake Shack and we can't wait to get to  get to go back and enjoy this new location."}
{"text":"One of my fave burgers. Period. 

The highlight of this Vegas trip was being able to eat at Shake Shack. Located at the New York New York, it's next to Tom Urban (look for the Brooklyn Bridge replica) & across the street from the M&M store. 

It was exciting to witness the grand opening, order from excited employees, & meet the CEO (he even graciously took a photo with us) but it comes down to the food for me. 

My husband and I ordered the Shack Burger & double Smoke Stack with fries, a shake, and fifty fifty (an Arnold Palmer). I contemplated letting my husband have a bite of my burger but I realized it would be one fewer bite for me so I kept eating. 

I was surprised that there weren't more people in line for the grand opening but I trust that people will flock here to the first West Coast location based on its stellar reputation. I will say that the friendly staff (both behind the registers & the ones in suits) on top of the delicious food have made us lifelong Shack Shack customers. 

As a Californian, I do prefer Shake Shack to In N Out. I love how soft the bun is, the freshness of the lettuce and tomato, and something I can't put my finger on. This was the first time I finished my food before my husband & I was lamenting when the burger was gone. That said, keep in mind that the regular Shack Burger is on the small size (something I realized when I first tried it in NY)."}
{"text":"This place was bigger then I expected. They have a huge wall menu plus little ones on the side. Food was fresh. Loved the fries and the burger. Got to try the stack shack!"}
{"text":"Definite Food Stop 

The Shack Stack.....if you are a Mushroom Burger person you need to try this. The crispiness from the Mushroom just adds that little something to the burger. The fries are not greasy at all, which helps with the guilt of eating them :)"}
{"text":"Thank you shake shack for treating the new H&M employees to delicious cheeseburgers on opening day! Not only was it super friendly and good business but the burgers were soooo good the whole staff couldn't stop talking about how yummy they were. Will definitely be making a trip down to shake shack for lunch or dinner soon."}
{"text":"Its a burger place, that is fresh. Yes they have great custard. So that's worth it but honestly no better than Five Guys."}
{"text":"Many folks compare Shake Shack to In N Out but I would compare Shake Shack to Five Guys instead because the menu options for their burgers are similar. 

FOOD/PRICES:
You can choose from a variety of burgers (bacon, mushrooms, and cherry peppers), chicken sandwiches, hot dogs, crinkle fries, shakes made from custard, and beer and soft drinks. Prices range from $3-10 and because there are no combos, your bill may end up being pricier than expected. 

QUALITY:
The food is made to order and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. The strawberry shake was tasty and the chocolate shake was too chocolate-y. Not a fan of how thick the shakes were though. French fries were whatevs in my opinion. Hoping to try the cheese fries next time. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
The cashier was friendly and somewhat helpful with the menu. Nothing super great and nothing bad. 

ENVIRONMENT:
More restaurant type feel than fast food. 

Overall, I would not come to Shake Shack if I wanted \"just\" a burger. I'd go to In N Out first - better prices and great quality too. Shake Shack would be more of a special treat due to the prices."}
{"text":"Burgers aren't usually my thing, but the burgers at Shake Shack were something else. 

Shack Burger
--The buns were nice and soft. The medium (degree of doneness) beef pattie was really juicy and flavorful. There was a good amount of super gooey cheese too! I downed this burger before I moved onto the crinkle cut fries...

Cheese Fries 
--The cheese really makes a difference (my other friend also ordered the regular crinkle cut fries). This tastes like nacho fries. I wanted to keep eating more of these!!

Frozen Custard (Strawberry Cheesecake)
--The custard tasted like a combination of frozen yogurt and ice cream. It was intensely rich and creamy, but unfortunately a bit too sweet for my liking. I ate most of the pint since my friends were too full or didn't like this as much after we ate our burgers and fries. 

I found this burger place to be super satisfying and will try to come back for the burger with the shroom!!"}
{"text":"You gotta love Vegas.  Where else in the entire country are you going to be able to get In n Out, White Castle, AND Shake Shack!?

I knew when I saw that Shake Shack had opened up in Vegas, that I had to eat there the next time I was in Vegas.  It is located by the New York, New York casino on the outside though, directly across the street from M&M world.  I was pretty excited to try it out and make the comparison between Shake Shack and In N Out.  

The line was out the door long when we got there but it moved relaitvely quickly and gave us more than enough time to check out their pretty extensive menu.  They have a lot of things on their menu.  I remember seeing 4 different burgers, fries, a few different style of hot dogs and a bunch of delicious sounding shakes.  Their prices are a lot higher than In N Out but I feel like at Shake Shack you are not getting just a wholesome regular burger.  I feel like Shake Shack is more similar to 5 guys or The Habit than In N Out.  Price wise, when compared to those burger places is about the same.  There were plenty of seats despite how crowded it was.  The workers there do a pretty good job of moving the crowd and cleaning up tables.  

We settled on a Shack Burger, a Shack Stack burger and cheese fries.  Their fries are amazing!  They are crinkle cut fries smoothered in a cheese sauce.  I love cheese.  My boyfriend and I had a disagreement because I wanted to just get one order but he insisted on two orders because he wanted fries and he knew that since they were covered in cheese I would end up eating all the fries and he would not get any.  We got two...he was right.  They are deliciious!  They are so much better than IN n Out fries which I was never a fan of.  I do not know why they are so good, but they are crisp, moist with just the right amount of saltiness.  My Shack Burger was okay, it came with tomato, Romaine lettuce, Shacksauce and cheese.  I do not know if I would pay $5.20 for it, I thought that was a bit pricey.  The burger was juicy and the sauce complimented it nicely.  I liked that they use Romaine Lettuce vs Iceberg.  

The Shack Stack burger...now that thing was on a whole nother level.  It was basically the Shack burger but with a fried, cheese stuffed portobello mushroom inside.  Man, biting into that thing and the cheese exploding everywhere, wow.  That burger was almost $10, not sure if it was worth it either but I would say that was more enjoyable than the Shack Burger.  

I did enjoy Shake Shack and I would say that I am a fan.  Hopefully they open one in Southern California sometime soon so I can enjoy it a little closer to home.  I would definately check it out.  The burgers are very good but remember to get the fries!  Those things are amazing!  I am going to have to try a shake from their next time I am in Vegas.  The flavor of the week when I went was buttery brown sugar....sounds like diabetes to me."}
{"text":"One of our go to places when were in town. It may not be the BEST burger place but The Portobello Burger and explosion of cheese has won me over. Plus my kids love this spot. 

Staff is always friendly. 

Sticky tables and water tastes GROSS. 
 
Can't wait for the LA location to open."}
{"text":"I was completely bummed on my trips to NYC and Boca Raton that I was unable to try a Shake Shack burger. I was so excited when they opened a location in Scottsdale, in my  own backyard. Let me tell you, it was worth the wait. So yummy!!! The cheese fries were very tasty and the burger was the perfect size. Even my son, who is super picky enjoyed his cheeseburger and that never happens. There is a long line, but it goes by quickly."}
{"text":"First discovered SS in NYC. After an hour wait... (YES, we waited in a line for at least an hour for a cheeseburger and fries!) we were hooked. Been to a few others including GA and FL. So, when we first moved to Vegas 6 weeks and discovered SS... oh happy days! I don't usually like fast food and I'm not sure this qualifies but let me say this... either way, it's a great cheeseburger. The fries are really good too... and better yet, they have beer and wine options. The shakes and concretes are awesome, as well. Dinner for 2 with drinks and dessert can get a little pricey but well worth the dollars!"}
{"text":"$5 for a tiny shake. $10 for a miniature double burger. $6 for a single burger that was two pieces of bread. Fries were good. Red Robin prices with White Castle size food. Save your money and go to Five Guys, Smash Burger, or In-N-Out. Service and fries are the only reason this place gets 2 stars."}
{"text":"Line was long during lunch time when I went but it did moved pretty fast.  Have heard lots of great things about this place.  Had the usual orders for my family of five with 3 double shack burgers, 1 plain cheese, single shack burger, 3 chocolate shakes, 2 fries and one cheese fries....came out to almost $80.  Have to admit it, the burgers were good... but fries and shakes were disappointing.   Good place to eat once in a while but can't top In&Out with overall satisfaction especially with the price."}
{"text":"Fries were good, shake was good, burger was more of a slider. Five guys has a better burger in that class."}
{"text":"The shack burger was good but I thought the burger itself was a little too salty.  It was good but j would choose in n out to be honest.  Also we got water from their fountain and it had stuff floating in it.  Gross.  But they gave us a free bottled water instead.  We also ordered the black and white shake and for some reason, it came sort of watered down or melted.  It tasted good but the consistency was as if it was sitting out for a good half an hour or so.  Another person from our party had the peanut butter shake and his was fine so maybe we just had a crappy batch.  It was all good but would still prefer in n out."}
{"text":"My first time going to Shake Shack! And wow it's pretty good! People kept saying it's the In-n-Out of the East coast. I'm pretty impressed! I like how they're really clean and organized compared to In-n-Out. They actually have places for people to sit and it's like a sit down restaurant but fast food style."}
{"text":"Some people tell me how amazing Shake Shack is. And then there's other people who tell me how overrated it is. Well my verdict: solid 4 stars!  

Everyone compares it to In-n-Out, but I personally think they are quite different. First off, the atmosphere. In-n-Out has the all-American fast food feel. Shake Shack is a bit hipstery with their wooden benches and fancier menu boards. They also have no drive-thru (at least not the one in Vegas). Second, price points. In-n-Out is ridiculously cheap, as all fast food institutions should be. Shake Shack's prices are higher up there. Not gourmet burger status, but close to something you would find at a sit-down burger joint.

Now onto the food. I would pay $7-10 for a full meal here. I ordered the cheeseburger. The patty was juicy, the lettuce and tomatoes were fresh, the bread was nicely toasted, all tied together with a thousand-islandy sauce (not as good as In-n-Out spread though!). Simple and clean flavors. We also ordered the cheese fries. They were hot and crispy with a good amount of cheese melted on top. Overall, I would come back, especially if I'm around the NY NY hotel. But if I'm driving back to LA already, In-n-Out at Barstow is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Not a fan at all!. Tastes like McDonald's to be honest!. Burger was cold and no flavor at all."}
{"text":"I really like this burger joint!! The menu is really nice and I like the fact that there are dog food items too:) I got he SmokeShake burger and it was the perfect size and very yummy! The fries were nicely seasoned too:) service was great, but I didn't like how I had to wait for my drink since the soda fountain was behind the counter.. overall I loved the atmosphere and would come again!"}
{"text":"Place was was good , we went during the hockey game and food came out fast and hubby order a burger that was mushroom and I had the cheese burger and the menu is kinda small and not bad so We'll be back someday during sports games ."}
{"text":"Five stars so far because Michael Deen at the register was so helpful, pleasant and friendly for my first time here. Had a smile the whole transaction and was just the person I needed to come in contact with when entering a new business. I haven't tried the food yet, still waiting for my buzzer to go off, but I just HAD to talk about the customer service from Mike!!"}
{"text":"As a native West Coast person, it's shameful for me to admit, but I am in love with Shake Shack.

I have had Shake Shack while traveling in New York City. It was there that I fell in love with this chain. 

Price: Much more expensive than In N Out or other chains like McD's.

Selection: a wide selection that includes burgers, hot dogs, milkshakes, etc.

Taste: I love their bread! I'm the type of person who goes for protein style but man, their bread is soft and delicious! Holds in all the juicy patty and gooooodies. I always order the SmokeShack! It has some peppers and bacon and that juicy patty, omg I'm like drooling as I think about it!

I have turned quite a few people onto this place. The most unfortunate thing is it is only in Vegas (for now)... when I'm here I annoy people by telling them I'm going to eat here every meal time..."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes, this place completely lived up to the hype.  I've been dying to try this place for the longest time, but haven't had the time to make it to New York.  I am so excited that they are coming to LA, but I couldn't wait and had to try out the place in Vegas.  Boy oh boy was it good.  I ordered the chick n shack and it was amaaaaazing.  Wow.  The fried chicken was perfectly breaded.  It was so crispy and flavorful, without having too much batter.  The chicken was so juicy inside.  My boyfriend had the shack stack, and he loooved it.  He was amazed at how juicy the fried portebello mushroom was.  I cannot wait for this place to arrive in LA!!"}
{"text":"Tasty, juicy burger.  A step up from you usual fast food burger joint. It seemed to be popular (possibly because it's new or could be convenience or could be because they have great burgers) because there was a line to the door every time we walked by. Prices were better then a full service restaurant.  If your only looking for a sweet fix you can hit the walk up window for some delicious custard. Burgers were a bit greasy but tasty. Definitely will stop back in on our next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Shake shack is a must try if you're in Vegas and wanting some classic American burgers, fries, and shakes!  This location is by New York New York, and although there is a line out the door, the line goes by pretty fast because the workers regulate it quite well.  There are both indoor and outdoor seating, so it's not a huge deal trying to find somewhere to eat.  It's a fast ordering layout and you can customize all your orders which is fun and delicious!  Although it was busy, the worker that took my order had a huge smile on wanting to help us make our lunch items perfect for what we wanted to try.

We ordered the classic single shake shack burger, smoke shack, cheese fries, and their black and white shake to share. I loved their burger meat because they weren't packed tight, making the meat flavorful and perfectly cooked. The burger was honestly cooked and paired perfectly with all the fixings and my boyfriend definitely loved his smoke shack as well. The smoke shack also comes with bacon and chopped cherry peppers, which adds a really good flavor to their burgers as well. If you're a HUGE meat person, you can also order the burgers as a double portion.  I loved their cheese fries: Simple, crisp, with smooth and creamy cheese on it!! I rarely find a place that cooks crinkle cut fries very well, but their fries were perfectly crisp but fluffly on the inside.  I love oreo flavored milkshakes anywhere, but Shake Shack's black and white shake definitely hit the spot: cold, creamy, and velvety.

If you're in any town that has a shake shack right around you, I definitely recommend trying it out! The food was delicious at a good price in Vegas, and you can never go wrong while you're walking along the strip if you're near that area!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for three days and I ate here twice yep its that's pretty good! Get the burger and the cheese fries and your will leave happy"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. Since its in downtown summerlin, it's pretty busy. They have mists outside for the outdoor seating. The place isn't too big. 

I ordered the chicken shack or something like that. I ordered it without pickles & they forgot to take it off... No big deal. The sandwich was so good!! I don't like burgers so I often opt for the chicken sandwich (& let me tell you, on my first bite, I knew I made the right choice). I also ordered the bacon cheddar fries. Holy moly, delicious! I'm not sure why people complain about the size of the food because everything is so heavy and filling lol. 

I also ordered a chocolate cookies & cream, but I didn't really like it. It was WAY too sweet. I had to give it to someone else cos it was giving me a headache. It was good the first couple of sips lol. 

Some guy - I think he was the owner or a manager or something - gave our table 2 free bacon cheddar fries! :D best customer service ever!"}
{"text":"Looks like when a big order comes in they don't care about the rest of their customers.  After being paged to pick up our food they kept pushing out order back and we waited and additional 30 minutes after being paged.  The excuse \"we just got a big order that we have to fulfill\" not cool at all Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"Ok I understand people are craving something different. People want fresh beef hamburgers. They like being able to customize your order. They like some variety. Yeah, Shake Shack offers all of that. But it comes at a price that borders on being ridiculous. 

My first visit ended up with an order that got messed up. Want a drink refill? It was a bit of a pain to get one. And at that price point surely they can direct someone on their staff to empty the dang trash cans. Sure the burgers are fresh and flavorful. But when you pull out your debit card and get the total, then look back at the cost after you finished your meal it comes across as seriously overhyped and way overpriced. 

It's worth trying once or twice, or if you're in downtown Summerlin and are craving a good burger it's an option to consider. But otherwise, I think I'll keep looking for better burgers elsewhere as Shake Shack just ain't all that."}
{"text":"Double down fries. Cheese sauce diced cherry peppers and applewood smoked bacon deeeeelisssh.  Burgers  are awesome quality meat including the bacon.   This particular store I like service is quick even if busy. Oh did i mention the peach pie oh my concrete hellooooow"}

{"text":"Great burgers for the price.  The place is clean and has a friendly staff.  We had the single burgers, and the sauce is great.  The buns are aren't soggy."}
{"text":"Like all the others commenting on here, I just had to see what the hype was about. In the end it's a mediocre burger that is WAY over priced. The restaurant is very busy and you can tell by the poor service, cashier never looked at me and when my Togo order was ready the girl slid my bag across the counter at me, luckily I caught it before it took a dive.

Thanks but no thanks"}
{"text":"A lot of my friends hype this place up a lot and I had to try it for myself. Definitely met my expectations. Their burgers weren't sloppy and I was a huge fan of the shape of their fries. Shake shack definitely has their own unique kind of flavor in their burger that other burger places do not have. If I had the chance, I would want to try all their different kind of burgers in their menu. Nothing special with their milk shake. I assumed their shakes would be very good because of the name of the place, but it tasted like a regular milk shake. I wouldn't get a milk shake with the meal since a burger and fries was enough to fill me up.

I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a quick bite before getting somewhere. Best average quality burger you can get in my opinion."}
{"text":"I went to this place on March 13th, I had a basic burger that tasted anything but. It was so juicy, tasty and perfectly cooked. I only wish they had an option for avocado ( unless I didn't see it). I'll be back next month and this time I will have a shake :)"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just not the type. Maybe it's me. If this were a dating relationship, I would be saying, \"It's not you, it's me\" and hitting the road. Truthfully, I'm apparently the only one... but here is my review.

I'm vegetarian and really love a good veggie burger. House-made ones are my jam. When I see portobella mushroom burger instead, I automatically assume-- no, KNOW-- they are writing it in. It's not unique or fun or at all delicious. Does any vegetarian truly say, HOORAY, a GIANT mushroom on a bun! My lucky day!

NO. We don't. I can tell you things vegetarians like: effort, good veggie burgers made with nuts, legumes, grains and spices. 

We also like fries. These crinkle-cut fries are obviously from a bag and truthfully, In n' Out, Burger King and INSERT YOUR FAVE CHEAPO GREASE JOINT HERE have better. Not playing.

I ordered a grilled cheese. At In n' Out, they give this to you with all the toppings. Not here. It's child-sized, almost $4 a la carte (!) and made with peelie cheese. 

The burger-eating people and my hot-dog eating kids were fine with the place, but admitted it was no better than In n' Out. And in fact, it was not AS good either. Not coming back. Resisting the cute ambiance and fun atmosphere and cool firepit (which earned it some stars). 

Goodbye $40. I legit came home and ate a salad because grilled cheese and fries wasn't enough for my belly."}
{"text":"Good burgers. I had the single SmokeShack and my wife had the single ShackBurger. The size is on the smaller end, which is fine as I left without feeling super stuffed. The spiciness of the SmokeShack really appealed to me. The regular crinkle fries were good. To finish, we shared the CamelShack frozen custard concrete, which is basically like a soft serve ice cream, the flavor was good, a bit tad too sweet. Overall, ShakeShack fills a niche in the fast food industry. It's a little higher end than In & Out and Carl's Jr but not as good (or as expensive) as the closer to \"gourmet\" burgers joints (e.g. Hopdoddy)."}
{"text":"Came in to try the burgers, was hoping it would live up to the hype and it did! Great flavor, soft bread, and good customer service. Located at The District in Green Valley Ranch there is plenty of space to sit down and eat. Good for groups as it has foosball and shuffleboard in the back. Lots of families hanging out and grabbing something good to eat so the atmosphere was positive and bright. Very clean too despite being pretty busy. There was a lot of employees working in the open kitchen which was nice to see because I got my order pretty fast. The burger is not huge and not small. It's just the right size for one person. The crinkle fries were crispy and not salty. I also ordered the Take the Cake Frozen Custard. The cake chunks in it was chocolate which was good, but I was expecting frozen custard to be thicker, so now I know their custard is not on the thicker side. Would try their other flavors in the future though. The featured flavor was Red Velvet, but I didn't see that until later. They also offer hot dogs here so that will be something to try out next time too. Overall, very clean facility, friendly and fast staff, and really tasty burgers. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I may be alone but I'm going to say it $7 a burger 30 minute wait at opening time $3 fries not good at all. It was (burger) salty and just ok and the burger was small in size what is up with the hype?  I was thinking this was going to be some blow your mind burger cause everyone talks about it, but it was just average. When I go home I won't be trying that again..."}
{"text":"Don't really understand the hype.

I was so excited to try Shake Shack after all the great things I heard about it.
Decided to go with a basic Shack Burger, as original is normally the way to go when you first try a new place.
So... dry...
It tasted like a beef patty from McDonalds (I've actually never had a burger from there, but I assume it would be around that quality)
And while the beef patty was really dry, the bun was soggy. Wtf?!
I did not dig the \"secret\" ShackSauce they put on it either. Tasted like the cheap melted cheese you get with nachos at the movies.
On top of that, the whole burger was freaking tiny! If my mouth wasn't so small I could've eaten it in two bites.

I'd pick In-n-Out over this place any day. Plus, it's half the cost!

But I do give +1 star for the friendly service and another +1 star because I have to admit, their fries are pretty darn good."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Shake Shack. All it took was one bite less than a year ago and I was hooked. I know, blasphemous for a West Coaster. (Insert eye roll)

My favorite is the ShackBurger (cheeseburger). I enjoy it as a single or a double with the standard lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce. Plus, I like to add onion (raw) and pickles. Amazing. The SmokeShack is really great as well. My favorite part of their burger, besides the delicious 100% Angus beef patty and fixings, is the soft and chewy potato bun! (Potato bread is awesome!!) Hamburger buns usually drive me bonkers because so many of them are dry or disproportionate to the amount of meat, etc. Their burgers are perfect.

Crinkle-cut fries aren't the most amazing or exciting potatoes in the world, but they're still tasty. Plus, if you're feeling extra gluttonous and order them with cheese, it's so darn good.

I've had a couple of their concretes and they're good, but I'm not crazy about them. Their shakes are pretty tasty, too. I don't focus much on dessert since I'm all about the burgers and fries!"}
{"text":"This is coming from a devoted In-N-Out fan - why do people continue to compare the two burger empires? The only thing to compare is their respective cult followings. That's it. As far as comparing the actual food, there is no contest. I tried each chain's burgers and fries back-to-back and Shake Shack's burger was clearly superior. The overall flavor is much better and their burgers even look more appetizing. I also like their potato buns A LOT more than In-N-Out's dry, flavorless buns (I always order protein style for this reason). I can't say I'm ready to kick In-N-Out to the curb because, let's be honest, a lot of this has to do with nostalgia, however, I'm giving the crown to the Shack.

The first time I tried Shake Shack (Shackburger), I thought it was good, but not better than In-N-Out. I was going based on my fond memories and how much I enjoy their food. I concluded that both burgers were good in their own ways and that I could enjoy both separately. A month later, I had the opportunity to try their burgers again (Double Shackburger, Shackmeister, Shack Stack) and I couldn't believe how good it tasted! It solidified my thoughts about the quality of their burgers. That same evening, I visited the nearby In-N-Out and much to my surprise, their burger looked a lot less appetizing than I remembered (especially compared to Shake Shack). And all it took was one bite - I couldn't believe the vast difference in taste!  It was flavorless. It reminded me how much I dislike their buns. I did, however, enjoy the tangy-ness of In-N-Out's secret sauce. 

I still need to figure out what I like best at Shake Shack. I like raw onion on my burger and I have yet to order a burger with it, so that'll be my next visit. I like their natural crinkle cut fries, the Cheese Fries were really good, and their shakes and Concretes are tasty as well. The prices are a little high and the location makes it difficult to want to visit often, but the food makes it worthwhile."}
{"text":"So out of all the popular chain burger places, I think shake shack is at the top of my list.  I am not one of the cult followers where the rest of the options are garbage but I do think that shake shack has been consistently better than others.

This one is right in line with the others.  Service was pretty good, food has been pretty consistent from location to location.  Ate here twice on a recent trip and both times were very good.  One of the biggest differences between the chains to me is the buns.  I like the potato buns that shake shack uses best.  Fries are solid.

Definitely would recommend.  Prices are high but not the worst of all the chains."}
{"text":"First time trying Shake Shack. Best burger I've ever had eating out. Bacon fries are awesome. Salted caramel shakes are delicious. Food is extremely high quality. Will be coming back"}
{"text":"I knew this place going to open couldnt wait to try 
it however I we t to NYC an ate there first.  Great burgers an cheese fries.  Wait was not long very impressed.  But the one in charlotte they will need to get it together before I go again.  The line was out the door the design of the place is backwards.  In NYC the line is inside.  We orderedI saw a table empty had my friend sit so I waited fir our food. 
I was getting drinks an a lady in front if me said they are out of ice an she asked the young lady behind the counter, the employee said she get ice in the cup she handled just odd.  Mind you nobody was filling up the machine with ice an there had to be 10 of us tryin to get ice.  Than there mustard an ketchup      Station both mustard pumps were out.  I told an employee an the young lady said both ketchup are full.  Bless i want mustard she finally changed the bags thank goodness. So after most have there food than what looked like the manager came out wiped a table or 2 an put ice in the ice machine SMH if they want to stay busy I suggest they figure out how to keep things filled an the line down.  I think if times square can keep the food coming out quickly than charlotte can surely fix the problem.
I cant say ill go back until its  more organized but a good burger much better than theres is HOBOs in fort mill 
."}
{"text":"Shack stack, crinkle cut fries and a vanilla shake. Definitely delicious as a midday lunch to give you energy going through the strip. Would say that the only downside is fighting others for a table.

I wouldn't say this lived up to the expectations of being a super amazing and best burger, but it's not bad and I'd revisit if I were in Vegas (or NY) again. I still think I'm a bit more partial to In-N-Out b/c of the price point for a no-frills burger with fresh veg."}
{"text":"Love this place to pieces! Best burgers around. Definitely have to get it at least once during my trips to the strip. Love the shack burger lettuce wrapped. Amazing French fries too. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place probably has some of the best burgers in Nevada! There was kind of a wait at midnight but the line was quick! I just got the normal hamburger and I was originally Shake sauce. Well the lady asked me if I wanted it and I said yes. Well 15 minutes later my friends and I finally got out our food and I burger had no Shake sauce. I will say with how fresh that burger and fries were I honestly didn't really that matter. The cashier was super nice too!"}
{"text":"I can't give it less than 5 stars. Let me tell you why: it's so good that I'm willing to wait. We've been twice now and both times lines were long and everything we ordered was right. Pro tip: dong sleep on the chicken sandwich! It may be even better than the burger. It's crunchy, ranchy, has just the right amount of pickles. I'm craving it just typing this review. Order it with a side of their cheese fries and roll out of there smiling. One day, I'll have enough room for a custard. One day."}
{"text":"Don't show up expecting a five-star steak and something you eat with a cloth napkin.  It's a burger joint, but a damn good one.

This place is GREAT for weekend late night snack as you stumble back to your hotel after losing your rent money...again.  I had the chicken sandwich and some fries and thought they were the bomb (welcome back 1999).

The service was good considering the number of customers waiting for food.  It took about 10 minutes to order and 10 minutes to receive, but there were a TON of people in line so it really wasn't bad."}
{"text":"I went here during the weekend of the Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight. I'm not sure if pricing is the same as the ones in New York or just in Las Vegas, but I thought it was expensive for what I ordered. I took my family here for a late night snack and pretty much ordered almost the same thing all around except for shakes and a beer. We all ordered a single Shackburger and fries. I thought the burger was small for $5. At In N Out, that's almost a Double Double meal. Although $7 for a double cheeseburger is a little expensive, the flavor of the patty does stand out. The Shackmeister Ale was fairly priced at $6.50 as far as beers go at burger joints. I had a chocolate/strawberry shake for dessert because they ran out of vanilla custard. It was a delicious blend of ... you got it... chocolate and strawberry at $5. Shake Shack is worth a try when in Vegas, but I won't be craving it that much for what it's worth. Anyway, good burger joint if you're curious to try, but The Habit Burger and In N Out are still my favorite go-to joints for casual burgers."}
{"text":"The line should be the first indicator of how good this place is.  We decided to split a meal since we were having a buffet for dinner.  We ordered a single patty burger, bacon cheese fries, and a chocolate brownie shake.  The fries were good but the burger stole the show!! The meat was seasoned and salted just right.  The pickles were thick and fresh and the bun...the bun was buttery, soft and fresh. We wanted to go back and order another it was so good.  This should be on the list if you are out walking the strip and you want a delicious affordable (as meals go on the strip) meal."}
{"text":"After riding the roller coaster at New York New York,  we stopped by here to have lunch.  I have never been to a Shake Shack and wanted to give the a try.  The line to order was short and the ordering process was standard.  We paid and went outside to wait for our buzzer to go off and collect our food.  Some odd reason it seemed to take awhile for the food to get prepared.  People ordering burgers behind us were getting their meals before us.  For some unexplained reason, our order took longer than usual.  The double burger I had was good, but the fries were so so.  I was surprised that they serve beer!  I didn't have any beer at this place."}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times and the staff is always friendly and I always receive my food in a reasonable amount of time. 

Now, you can't compare Shake Shack to In N Out or Five Guys. If you love a good cheeseburger, you know they all fall into their own category. And I'll leave it at that for those comparisons. 

If you're a first timer, you definitely have to get the shack stack. I don't go for that now - the deep fried cheese filled mushroom is something you must try but I'm definitely cool off of getting a smoke stack or a regular cheeseburger. Yeah - it can be a little pricey but their patties are always good and I've always received a consistent product at this location.  

The fries though - not a big fan. I am not a Kringle type of girl and the cheese sauce is not my cup of tea but I still think they're worth giving a shot if you've never been here but for like $4 - I could definitely live without it. 

Their shakes are also creamy and thick AF. Bomb - but use a spoon. I like that they have seasonal flavors but I can't finish one on my own. Still gotta get it if you're a first timer. Go big or go home, right? 

Not sure if there are soda refills since the machine is kept behind the counter. They do have a couple items for dogs and if you aren't into cheeseburgers, they have hot dogs and a chicken burger too. 

All in all - if you love cheeseburgers, you should definitely check this place out and I believe you can now online order if you wanna save some time."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, nice atmosphere, but the price does outweigh the total value (hence the 4 stars). My meal consisted of the Shack Burger (Double), side of fries, and large drink, totaling $16 and some change.

The burger was cooked very nicely. The red peppers atop the melty cheese and excellently seasoned patty were warm and soft, the bun slightly toasted, and the slightly sweet \"southwest\" style Shack sauce was a tasty and flavorful touch. The fries were fresh and crispy, cross cut style. The drink was a regular soft drink, nothing out of the norm. 

The atmosphere was busy. It was a warm environment full of socialization. Not too loud as to not hear your company in normal conversation, but not too low as to give off a boring vibe.

The staff seemed to be friendly, clear and concise with my order, though this is a counter style restaurant so interaction is limited.

The only qualm I have with this place was with the price. It is definitely a more upscale burger joint, and much of the price could in all fairness be contributed to its location on the Las Vegas Strip, but I would not  allow that to prevent you from at least trying it once.

All in all, this dining experience was solid and pleasant to say the least."}
{"text":"I wish I could review this place based on its food but instead I'll have to rate it on our experience while waiting to try and get food. Let me start by saying we were very excited to try this new place! After waiting in line for over 30 minutes, we were finally inside which we expected given that it is new. Unfortunately what we found once inside were tables full of people still without food, visibly frustrated and multiple people at the register saying they had been waiting over an hour since ordering! The menu looks great and I'm sure they'll work out the kinks, but they were way overwhelmed and could not keep up. Hopefully they'll figure out how to speed things up. Until then I'd recommend staying away."}
{"text":"Always delicious. I'm a fan of their burgers, not so much their crinkle cut fries. I'm a \"soggy fry lover\" so these ones don't do it for me. You can't go wrong on their burgers though! Shake Shake is better than In N Out. Mic drop."}
{"text":"Best burgers! The meat is so good not like a pre-made hockey puck like fast food and the bun is delicious"}
{"text":"This place got pretty busy once the doors opened at 11am. I tried the single stack and cheesy fries and It was good. If I could give a rating of 3.5, that would be my score for this burger joint.  Compared to In-N-Out's fresh off the grill flavor and fresh veggies, I choose good old In-N-Out.  The cheese crinkle fries were not impressive, shake shack's melted cheese tasted artificial compared to In-N-Out's animal style fries. I did not try the shakes or concrete as its called and custard ice cream though, maybe next time."}
{"text":"This place is great & it reminds me of New York in such a huge way. Maybe because it's such a big deal at Citi Field, where the New York Mets play. I ordered two burgers w/o cheese, fries & a Brooklyn beer. It was the perfect combination for an excellent meal. As much as I love In-N-Out Burger, the fries here are way better, IMO."}
{"text":"With this whole In and Out debate vs. Shake Shack I decided I had to try it out for myself.  My girlfriend told me when she visited the one in New York she felt as if In and Out was still far superior than Shake Shack.  I was in town for an entire week for SEMA and decided to pop into Shake Shack for a quick lunch.

I love a goo burger as much as the next person but this place really disappointed me.  I paid a little under $20 for lousy food.  Literally I had very high expectations but came out more disappointed than anything else.  I ordered the SmokeShack double, cheese fries and a malted black and white shake.

SmokeShack- 2/5, it wasn't good at all.  Super salty burger, only the pepper gives it a nice flare but really nothing special at all.  The meat tasted dry and uneventful.

Cheese Fries- 3/5, it wasn't bad, just very oily, so oily, between two people we ddi not finish them.  

Malted Shake (Black and White)- 1/5, this was just bad.  It tasted like blended chocolate milk.  This is probably the worst shake I've ever had at a place known for their 'shakes'.  Very small potion for a very high price as well.

Although this place is very hyped up, when I went there was no line, walked right in, ordered, got my food in 6-7 minutes and left fairly disappointed a few minutes later.  Would I come back?  No.

It's one of those places you try and you see what the hype is for yourself."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place since it came out but never have had the chance to try it. Gotta say...it's a damn good burger. I also tried the shack-cago dog which was also really good. Great shakes and fries too. Simple and effective menu that covers all the basics. Great service with a smile. Very well ran establishment. Management is on point here."}
{"text":"YAS it's not in-n-out but it was pretty dang good and better than the Habit or Five Guys in my opinion. I love that similarly to in-n-out, the veggies are cold but the meat/bun is warm!! Great flavor contrast that makes the veg taste extra fresh! I think I enjoy the in-n-out sauce more than the shake shack sauce though. I couldn't even taste any sauce in my hamburger to be honest ... And I don't know how to compare patty meats since I think they all taste the same, but I think the meat here was less visually appealing due to its lack of circularity (the shape was pressed to look au naturale). 

Cheese fries were surprisingly super good. The cheese was so creamy for being a melty piece of cheese instead of liquid cheese! I do not understand. 

Also picked up a brownie milkshake which was super rich and heavy, probably more so than in-n-out's. Too heavy in my opinion ... i regret not trying orange creamsicle-ish flavor instead.

This place is a must try for all west coast peoples who need to prove to themselves that in-n-out is better :-) Line moved quickly and the food came out fast! Shake shack is a very worthy burger spot that can take #2 place in my heart, lol"}
{"text":"I've been waiting so so so so LONG to try a Shake Shack. Every city I've been too, the lines were so long and I wasn't going to deal. Saturday we went to the PHX museum. We were looking for a place to eat after, started driving and my husband saw the restaurant and it was just starting to fill up for the lunch crowd based on the parking lot. We got in and the line was barely a line, but I did notice all the tables were almost full. I sent my son to find a table and he did.

We ordered 1 ShackBurger Double (Cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce), 1 Hamburger Double with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, 1 ShackBurger Double (Cheeseburger topped with lettuce, ShackSauce and bacon), 2 Fries, 1 Chocolate Milkshake, and 1 Beer all for $40

After our pick up order buzzer went off, we picked up our meal, one of the burgers were missing so we had to wait, the beer was missing and so was an order of fries, plus the burger that was missing came with 1 patty after we paid for 2, by then we were so frustrated... not happy. Finally we got everything we ordered. We took a vote, Burgers were OK maybe they forgot the ShackSauce or something but I had to go get ketchup to add some flavor. Fries were good. Milkshake was good.

I'm finally glad I was able to try a Shake Shack to find out what all the HYPE is about which I still don't know why... and the icing on the cake is since this was the only meal I ate that day I had food poisoning from my burger all night."}
{"text":"So apparently this is the In-N-Out of the East Coast? Or so I've heard.

In any case, I knew that this would have to be a MUST try in Vegas. I ALMOST didn't get a taste of Shake Shack, but luckily enough for me, the Shake Shack on The Strip isn't the only one. 

My friend took me here on a Sunday night around 9PM and it was fairly busy. There were tables, but a good amount of people were there. I had overheard my friends talking the other day about a burger with mushrooms and how good it was...so I came in look for it. However, it was nowhere in sight...I was about to order the Shake Burger, when I noticed that there was a burger called the Stack Shake or something along those lines, which was the burger I was looking for. 

It was a big on the pricier side of burgers, but I told myself it was worth it, and luckily it was. This burger was absolute perfection. The mushroom is actually a patty that has melted cheese in it, stacked on top of the meat patty, which also has cheese, served with the shake shack sauce and lettuce and tomatoes. 

I took my first bite and cheese oozed EVERYWHERE, which is what I LOVE. I devoured my burger because of how tasty it was! Shake Shack is totally worth it if it's a once in a while thing, but I don't know if I can afford to come by every week for it. 

I feel like a traitor saying this, but Shake Shack is half a step above In-N-Out because of how amazing those fries are. I didn't order the fries at this location, but when I tried them at the one on The Strip, it was AHHHMAZING. 

I definitely need to try the shakes and cheese fries next time I come across a Shake Shack! This is a definite, must try when you're on the West Coast and in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Yes! East coast meets west coast! 

This always hits the spot for me when I'm drunk or craving a burger. The line moves fast so don't worry if you see the line.

Some nights like last night with all the hungry drunk people order gets missed so make sure you check up on it. 
Order: 

Must get the the shack stack $9.95 ( if you don't like mushroom this is not the burger for you. But deep fried portobello mushroom with cheese, such a great idea!) 
Salted Carmel pretzels shake ( so good! $5.39) 
Vanilla ice cream cone single scoop( not worth the price $2.49) 
Crinkle fries ($2.99 reminds me of childhood yum! )"}
{"text":"After trying this place 1 time, it's already overtaken 5G as my 2nd favorite fast food / fast casual burger. Sorry 5G, you're #3 now.

The food is really good.  Especially the burgers.  I had the double Shack Burger, fries with cheese, a large Arnold Palmer, and a Triple Ripple Concrete.  

I have zero complaints about any of the food.  The burger was juicy, flavorful, and had a fantastic grilled crust.  The fries were crinkle cut and crispy, even while topped with their white cheese sauce.  The concrete was fantastically thick with plenty of PB.

My cashier was friendly, and knew what she was doing on the register.  The other cashier looked like she was having some problems. In her defense, her customer was ordering for 4 people and had a complicated order.

Two things prevented this place from being 5 star.  First, it's quite expensive, despite being really good food.  My order came to 22$.  #HolyCrap!  My other issue is this place a bit small.  There was a line 10+ people long waiting just to get in the door...and after placing orders, people had to stand and wait for a table to open up.

I will be back because of the food....but not often, because I'm not rich."}
{"text":"Going into my dinner here at Shake Shack, I never thought anything would come close to my love for In N' Out Burger. Much to my surprise, Shake Shack came close and even surpassed In N' Out in several ways!

Service: Sorry, but In N' Out wins for service. When we arrived at Shake Shack there was a very long line, which wasn't a problem because it gave us time to discuss the menu (prominently displayed on a large wall right when you walk in). The line moved fast and soon enough it was our turn; however, the woman who took our order was ornery and short with us. B-

Decor: I LOVED the ambience and decor in Shake Shack. We snagged a spot on the large bar table in the center of the restaurant (shared by up to fifteen diners) and had a great view over the open kitchen and large flat screen TVs. I noticed couches, tables, and benches all throughout Shake Shack. A+

Food: We waited about 8-10 minutes for our food (as expected, given the large amount of people). It was well worth the wait! The burger patties were absolutely DIVINE. If you are looking for fresh and juicy, order the Shack Burger. I can't say enough good things about the patties. The only problem I had was that I asked for a lettuce-wrapped burger, and instead I got a patty on top of a slice of lettuce (making for quite a messy meal). In N' Out wins for food presentation and sauce but as much as it pains me to say it, Shake Shack has the better patty. A+

For three burgers (with added bacon), a side of fries, and a mango lemonade, it came to about $25. 

Shake Shack definitely deserves the five stars."}
{"text":"We love this place!! They're quick, yummy and not expensive at all!! Shack burger and fries is the way to go!!! I take the shake for the road, never can finish it lol....always a stop here."}
{"text":"I was a loyal In-n-out fan but I decided to give Shake Shack a try after hearing all about the hype. And the hype is real! The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the design of the restaurant which was really modern and sleek. The line was also really long but the things we do for food. The menu had a good amount of selections but I decided to go with the classic shack burger and fries. 

Food: The burger was a lot smaller than I expected. At first look, I was definitely not impressed by the size of it. But after tasting it, my mind was blown. The patty was so freaking juicy and the buns were sweet and soft. Personally, I'm not a fan of crinkle cut fries so I thought it was just ehh. The burger was so good that I decided to go back again the next day and I also got Concrete, which is a type of Frozen Custard. It was a little too sweet with all of the candy in it but the custard part was really good and creamy.

It's a great burger place to grab a quick bite and it's definitely worth the line."}
{"text":"Outside of In N' Out, I can't say I've enjoyed a fast food burger ....UNTIL NOW.

Shake shack burger patties have a great meaty flavor that amplifies them beyond their thin, fast food patty dimensions.

The shack burger is good, but the bacon green chile burger is incredible.  The chiles add a vinegary taste (serving a pickle-like purpose) which is a great balance to the savory meaty patty and creamy sauce.  I hope chiles become the new exciting pickle replacement at more burger joints."}
{"text":"OMG the hype is real! the shake stack (burger + mushroom burger together) was AAAAAAMAZING! the mushroom is battered and deep fried to perfection and then when you bite into it, cheese oozes out! what??? 

the cheese fries are also a must! don't know what they put in the cheese but it's BOMB! I also got the vanilla shake and that tasted pretty yummy as well. so glad I made it here before I left Vegas! so happy to know that they have a location in Santa Monica because I already want to eat it again!"}
{"text":"I went to the Shake Shack for an early-bird dinner on Thursday. It was a perfect sunny day. 

 We walked right up to the cashier and placed our order. They had three cashiers open at the time. I think it would be easier if there was a larger cashier area. Or more space between each cashier, if it was roped or guard-railed to feeder some of the line. The cashier gives you a buzzer and asks for your name. You are suggested to find a table there after. We found as booth right away. There was plenty of open tables inside and outside. Though a lot of people congregated in front of the pickup window, whom were picking up to go orders based on their bags rather than trays.

While we waited for our buzzer to vibrate, we selected our beverages of choice from the fountain. There is a choice of coke products, iced tea, lemonade, beer on tap, milkshakes and floats. I crafted an arnold palmer with the homemade lemonade.

 I ordered a BBQ Cheddar and Bacon Burger, crinkle fries, a beverage and we shared a Black & White milkshake. I believe the burger is a summertime special. The BBQ Cheddar & Bacon Burger is a handcrafted patty (based on its shape), smoked cheddar cheese, bacon, crunchy pickle chips, and homemade BBQ sauce.  It came in a white sandwich bag, which helped prevent a mess. The crinkle fries are crunchy, but could of used more salt. I would have liked the option of vinegar to put on them, however I did use my go-to sauce, hot sauce. The Black & White milkshake tasted like it was a standard chocolate. 

It was a good burger, just didnt live up to the hype that I heard about the NYC location. I definitely wouldn't wait in a line of 30 people in front of me."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend that tourists should stop by this gem when visiting Las Vegas !! It's a well-known gourmet fast food joint in New York, so they decided to open one in New York New York @vegas. Much clever~~

FOOD:
1) Shack Stack-- ($9.49) 
I thought this was the best thing on the menu! The fried portobello mushroom literally melted in your mouth. If you're not fond of mushrooms, you shouldn't order this bc the taste of the mushroom is infused into the cheese. The buns are buttery and crispy when bitten into & the party is cooked to perfection (medium to medium rare to be exact) 
The actual burger is the size of a regular burger that you can order from in-n-out (maybe even smaller). But the height of the burger is 3.5-4 inches! You better open your mouth wide for this !! 

2) Smoke Shack-- (single: $6.69)
Shake Shack is also popular for their bacon! It had a smokey applewood taste to it. The burger also included pickled sweet red peppers which gave it a tangy-ish taste! 

3) Chicken Dog-- ($4.50) 
The texture was pretty chewy... And not worth the $4.50 in my opinion. The overall taste wasn't all that great either. It was smokey with a weird aftertaste. It didn't come with any condiments. No ketchup, mustard, relish, or anything. It was just the sausage and the hotdog bun -__- 

Buttttt overall, I really really REALLY enjoyed this place. I mean, it's famous in New York for a reason right ?"}
{"text":"Really wasn't sure that the price was going to be worth it. I really couldn't believe that they were charging so much, but thought it must be a really great meal. I was really excited about their lemonade selection though!

It was a good burger overall. Meat looked really fresh and well cooked. Here were my beefs (haha) with their burger: 1. The bun was good, but it wasn't cut through. So when it is packaged and wrapped, the grease all runs into the bun. I think some people may like that, but a soggy grease bun for me was not tasty. 2. The bacon on my burger really didn't stand out flavor wise. Bacon on my burgers is a huge deal.

The other thing about the cost and food in general for me was that they didn't have any subs for fries. I always want onion rings with my burgers instead of fries and there was none to had here. So that was disappointing.

The Watermelon Mint Lemonade though was amazing. It really was the saving grace for me on the meal. This place is overpriced, not unique enough to compensate for price, and had some things I didn't particularly like about the burger. Probably won't go back again just because of preference to other burger places."}
{"text":"It was good, but the line was ridiculous and so was the wait after we ordered. It's just a burger place, and Five Guys has better burgers."}
{"text":"Finally! Phoenix (well Scottsdale, technically) has it's very own Shake Shack! I've always equated it to being the In-N-Out of the East Coast, and in a way, it is, but it also really isn't. It has a fairly simplistic menu, at least on the burger side, but they do have some alternatives that In-N-Out does not.

For one, the 'Shroom Burger. It was actually a lot better than I was expecting. I was forewarned that it was a vegetarian burger, but even though I'm more inclined to beef on my burger, it turned out to be pretty darn tasty! Melted cheese, sandwiched between two portobello mushrooms, deep fried in batter sitting below two tomato slices and a lettuce leaf, all within my hamburger buns. Diameter-wise, it was small, like an In-N-Out burger, but also delicious. Be careful of that melted cheese though, cause it definitely oozes and explodes out on the other side of the portobello patty when you least expect it.

The Bacon Cheddar Shack looked small (again) but amazing, with a white cheese sauce threatening to takeover the entire burger. And bacon, of course. However, it seems like it looked way better than it tasted cause the hubby was less than impressed. He was rather disappointed that it wasn't actual cheese and that the bacon and cheese sauce essentially overpowered the entire burger, so much so you couldn't taste the meat (pun intended) of the burger.

Now, the damage was about $7 per burger and $3 per side of fries. So basically, you're paying restaurant prices for fast food. Worth it? Eh...I'm on the fence on that. Maybe if I tried a shake or custard, I might be more partial towards it, but with this experience alone, I think I'll stick with my usual haunts of Five Guys or In-N-Out."}
{"text":"yum!!!!!!!!!!

FIRST OFF, do not compare it to IN & OUT. It's completely different.

I want to say it's a fancy hybrid of Wendy's & White Castle version... 

On the tab
Root Beer Float
Cheese Fries
Shake Burger
Smoke Stack
Shroom burger
I think the Elvis custard

Recommended:
cheese fries
shake cheeseburger
custard (any flavor/any style)

Even though the line was pretty long, we ordered and got our food pretty quickly. If you   can walk there, I would walk or take a cab cause it's on the corner and the parking structure is pretty far from there.

I did not like the breaded shroom burger...it was just weird."}
{"text":"Okay. I was always a OMG In-N-Out is my favorite, I don't need to try any other burger places in Vegas, that's the best. Uh. What? I was wrong!

I loved Shake Shack! I got a Shack Burger, and it was soo juicy and delicious. And crinkle cut fries?! Ya'll know the way to my heart. It was busy and food didn't take long either! Hot and definitely fresh. The staff was very friendly and efficient. Great prices too!

Very loud and upbeat atmosphere. More of a gathering place, it's pretty open and has lots of booths and tables scattered about. 

Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty fast food burger . . . I really like the soft buns (almost brioche like) buns they use. The whole leaf lettuce (instead of shredded iceberg) also made the burger seem slightly higher quality than In-N-Out.  The crispy, crinkled fries are WAY BETTER than In-N-Out.  That said, I find a Double Double just as satisfying as a Shake Shack burger from a taste standpoint, and In-N-Out is much cheaper.  So, at the end of the day, my vote still goes to In-N-Out."}
{"text":"The food was good and the line goes fast, but they left our food unsupervised on the counter and another customer put his hands all over our food to check if it was his order. When we asked the woman to remake it because of this, she acted really annoyed and didn't want to do it."}
{"text":"Not sure why the food tastes so bland today or if they changed something. If you like beef patties that are not seasoned, this is it. I didn't detect any salt or pepper in the meat. The onions cannot be grilled. $6.99 for a bland burger? The fries are not salted either. I tried looking for signs of salt crystals but my beedy little eyes didn't detect any. The best part of the burger is the bun. Its like a soft Hawaiian bun. The patty was cooked to the right consistency and not over cooked. The apple pie shake was good and tasted like apple pie. Next time I'll stick with 5 Guys on the other side if I want a burger. Shake Shack. They must've shook all the seasoning out of their food."}
{"text":"Interestingly, this was my first time experiencing Shake Shack, despite the fact that a location in Orlando had been around for a few months before my trip to Las Vegas. In general, this location is very typical of other eateries along the strip--always busy, loud, and bright. However, we stopped in here twice and they do a very good job of getting the line moving along, even during the lunch rush. 

As far as the food is concerned, there are a variety of burgers to choose from including beef, chicken, and veggie burgers. I decided to go with the smoke shack, which is served with cherry peppers and bacon. Crinkle cut fries and a fair trade coffee shake were also ordered to complete the Shake Shack experience. Overall, the burger and fries were delicious, with the burger patty slightly reminiscent of Steak N Shake, but much thicker and meatier with more flavor to it. The crinkle cut fries were also great but in my opinion could have been a little thicker to give them more flavor. The star of the meal was the coffee milkshake which so far has been the only custard style Ice cream I have truly enjoyed. Perhaps the coffee flavor balances out the twang of the custard that I'm not a huge fan of (probably because I didn't really experience this type of ice cream growing up). Regardless, I enjoyed our meal and look forward to trying out the other burger options offered by Shake Shack in the future."}
{"text":"These burgers are by far some of the best I've had. They are so juicy! I'm only in Vegas a few days but this is definitely worth a second or third visit. I was originally going to go to In N Out, but the route was not pedestrian friendly. I am happy to have discovered this place, it does not disappoint! I was particularly impressed by how fast the service was. The restaurant was PACKED and my food still came out in a reasonable time and there were still plenty of seats outside."}
{"text":"OMG I love Shake Shack! I had never been to one before (west coast girl here) so I was super excited to see one in Las Vegas and MADE SURE to try it on my first day there.

I came in a little after Noon on a Friday and was glad to see that there was no line, but all the tables inside and outside were packed! Luckily I was there by myself so I was able to find a rouge chair and table to sit at and eat. They have a lot of seats and tables, but it's just that busy! When I left at almost 1:00pm it was even worse, so make sure to come early! They open at 11:00.

I ordered their Vegetarian Shroom Burger and a Peanut Butter Shake. They both came out quickly and the Shroom Burger was DELICIOUS! It's a fried mushroom cap stuffed with cheese. Nom nom nom! I actually don't really like mushrooms very much but I loved this one. Definitely a must try! The Peanut Butter Shake was yummy as well, and I loved that it was made with custard. I've missed frozen custard ever since I moved out of Colorado and was stoked to finally get to have some again.

I liked Shake Shack so much on my first visit, that I dragged my Husband back a few days later. He had the Chicago Dog which he thought was good (but messy to eat) and we split their Cheese Fries which were sooooo GOOD! Would definitely get them again. I got the Shroom Burger again (yum) and a Peanut Butter Malt this time, but it tasted exactly like their regular shake so don't spend the extra $$.

I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Love me some shake shack...and the Vegas location did not disappoint. The food was quality, reasonably priced (especially for the strip) and tasted exactly as it did in NYC. A great addition to Nee York New York casino!"}
{"text":"I've been anticipating trying out this place. The food was great. It was worth the wait. Can't wait to go again!!!"}
{"text":"This a great place to get a quick and delicious bit. I know there are numerous places you can go in Vegas, but if you need something quick and don't want to go to a chain that's in every town. Go to the shack."}
{"text":"I will start with saying the food we ordered tasted good.  It was flavorful and was ok.  I had the burger with mushroom on it and I liked it.  

This is what you need to know when you eat here.  I had a burger and fries... NO DRINK.  My bill just for myself was almost $14.  There was nothing about this food or the service that warranted being 14 bucks.  I was not impressed with the service and the food was not larger portions by any means.  I can get the same caliber burger or better at nearly any restaurant in Phoenix.  Think about this, you can get a steak with sides and salad for that price at Texas Road House.  Just a thought.  I probably would not go back here because their prices are those of a sit down restaurant... this is a fast food burger joint.  The prices should match.  Not worth it at all. Also, for the price they are charging they can do way better on the cleanliness of the dining area."}
{"text":"So this is the East Coast version of In n Out?

We got here about opening time at 11AM on a Sunday Morning. There was already quite a line and it was pretty hot already but we got inside and ordered pretty quickly. Once you order you get a buzzer thing and then you pick up your food when the thing buzzes.

I got the single shack burger along with regular fries since I didn't like being a fatass in Vegas. My friend got the double burger and cheese fries. When my food came it honestly tasted like a regular burger to me. The fries were OK at best (not really my preference). However, when I tried my friends cheese fries, I regret not getting them. They were good. Price wise was medium to expensive for a fast food burger and fries but it's understandable because it's in Las Vegas.

In n Out is still my go to for a quick cheap good tasting burger and fries. Not everyone is gonna agree with this! 

Overall, not bad for fast food but I'm still sticking with my In n Out in California."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sat for lunch. There was a long line way past the door but it moved pretty quick so we didn't have to wait for TOO long. We've been wanting to try Shake Shack for awhile now I was super excited to find out that there's one here in Vegas! The food did not disappoint! The burger was delicious, a little too small for me but delicious! I love how the buns are different from other burger places. The fries were pretty bomb as well. I wouldn't say it's better or worse than In N Out burgers because it feels like that's comparing two different things, but both are good! I would love to come back and try their hog dog selection and maybe the shakes as well."}
{"text":"So glad this opened up in Vegas! I have heard so many great things about this place, as I am sure you have too! Walking up to the building you just know things are going to be good! The place is very well lit and super cute and trendy inside. My favorite thing is the tv wall that showcases a bunch of images and videos from the NY location. It almost seems like you're in NY! 

And now to the food! I love that they have seasonal desserts, great knowing the dessert menu isn't set and gives you a reason to want to come back. Of course that is asides from coming back for their awesome burgers and hotdogs! The burger is as good as people claim is! What really sold it for me though was there cheesy crinkle cut fries! So simple, yet so delish! My only disappointment was how small their burgers were. I def. could have eaten two in one sitting.

Overall, this place is def. worth the hype!  Now go out and try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype! What do people love about this place? the burger was small, the patty tiny and my bun was soaked in grease. Yuck!

There are so many good spots to get a burger in Phoenix and especially around this area, next time I will keep driving."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good!!!  Went in after a basketball game w hungry boys so I was able to try a lot of the menu items.  The burgers are flavorful, piping hot and served on a soft pillowy bun.  My only complaint is that it is rather on the small size and I'm a woman.  My husband, sons and the rest of the team had to order 2 burgers each which means it is very pricey.  Crinkle fries were good but get the cheese fries w/ bacon, so much better!  The chick n shack was also very good, crispy not greasy.  For me personally the shack stack was the best there.  Dessert wise shakes we're not bad but the red velvet concrete was amazing!!!  In my opinion, In N Out still reigns supreme but Shake Shack is tied second alongside The Habit."}
{"text":"Went to Shake Shack 2 weeks ago with some friends. Now don't get me wrong, the food is good, but DEFINITELY not worth the hype. For the price, the Bacon Cheddar burger was honestly about the size of a Wendy's Jr Bacon Cheeseburger. Was nice to go there to see what the food is like, but more than likely won't go again"}
{"text":"Its one of my favorite burger places, i was so excited when they got this to Charlotte. I would have given 5 starts because they deserve it for the quality of the food and taste of the burger but, they need to understand that any customer doesn't like to wait in a line which takes him about 15-30 minutes to get to the cashier just to place an order. Thats one of the points that you need to take care about and it would be great if you can have couple more registers open during weekends in rish hours, and the time to get the burger is about 45 minutes which is actually making the fame and the craze for this brand to fall apart. Now coming to the burger its amazingly delicious i had the chick n shack and it was so good fresh meat not too soggy not too crispy it has the perfect texture of s burger and the fries were decent. I loved it and woul like to come back if you'll would try to reduce the wait time."}
{"text":"I came here because people told me they had better burgers than In N Out and I had to try it for myself. Boy were they wrong! The wait time to get your burger at this fast food joint is not so fast. We waited a long time to get our order and to try to find an empty table. Very busy spot but definitely not worth all the hype. The place is actually pretty clean for a fast food place that does that much business."}
{"text":"Damn... I love my In-n-Out but I have to give it to Shake Shack. Ordered the DBL Smoke Shake and Fries and I'm admitting it was phenomenal. Patty was cooked perfectly and you can never go wrong with bacon. Fries were crunchy and not soggy. I still have love for In-n-Out but Shake Shack is definitely up there. We came during lunch rush so it was busy as expected. Only thing is shake shack's prices are double that of In-n-Out and given that this location is right one the strip."}
{"text":"Many people are comparing with In-N-Out and I think it's not fair for Shake Shack because it has its uniqueness. I tried their Smoke Shack (single) and Bacon Cheese Fries and they were so yummy! Next time, I am definitely ordering double because the burger was smaller than I thought. The fries are crinkle fries so it was soft and crunchy at the same time. The bacon and cheese was adding more to the flavor so I highly recommend it! For the drink, I ordered Fifty-Fifty, which is basically Arnold Palmer and they just hand me a cup so I asked where I can get my drink and the clerk pointed me to the drink station. I had to make my own drink, which I think it was odd. But, other than that, the restaurant was clean and it had a great vibe. You can watch sports games since they have many TVs around you."}
{"text":"Straight up good burger spot with great shakes! They offer the option to have malt added to your shakes which is a nice touch. First approaching it looks like a mad house but they really got it together and keep this location running very smooth and fast. I was impressed how fast I got to order and my food to my table with the overwhelming crowd. This is my \"go to spot\" for a good burger love the taste from the shack sauce down to the bun! Everything is a la carte which can add up. Be sure to stay up on the secret menu don't miss that!"}
{"text":"The first time I had Shake Shack was in NYC around 2005/2006.  I remember that it was pretty good but I didn't want to stand in a long line for it. Over the years I did go several times to the NYC location and the last time I had it was at least 6-8 years ago. So at this visit, I ordered the cheese fries and they were great!  A good amount of cheese on it and the fries were nice and crispy. The chick'n shack was crispy, lots of pickles but the bread was a little too soft to my liking. The boyfriend ordered the shack-cago dog and the double shack burger. He liked both but he really preferred the cheese fries and he ordered another serving!

There was plenty of seating and no long lines at this location. Their facilities were clean and their employees were very friendly. There was a particular employee that was awesome because he asked if we wanted a refill for our drinks, we said yes and he delivered it to us. We didn't even ask. He was awesome!  I would give the service 4 stars and the food 3.5 stars. 

If I was in Las Vegas and around the Summerlin area, I would visit this location again."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Shake Shack after my friends raved about it in New York. I'm a sucker for shakes and ordered the strawberry shake. You order up front, and they give you a buzzer. My shake took over 25 minutes!!  I would've been fine with the wait if it was a delicious shake, but it wasn't! It wasn't very thick and not much flavor. I hate to say this, but McDonald's shakes are better. Total and complete letdown."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the flat greasy burgers, small shakes and crinkle fries that weren't even close to being crunchy. The cheese that they  use was unappealing in taste Price.... For 2 burgers, 2 shakes and 2 fries $37.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"A friend told me about a wonderful 'Shroom burger at Shake Shack. I drove pretty far to experience said goodness, first time here. I love DTS, parking was a bit rough but it's always like that. The place was clean and spacious and there was no one in line, so far so good.. I ordered the 'Shroom burger and the host at the register (Andrew) said \"are you sure you don't mean the Shack Stack\"... mind you, it's my first time here so I'm unaware of what a Shack Stack is, but there IS an item on the menu called the 'Shroom Burger which is what I asked for, so I found it odd that he would question my selection. Moving on, I ordered the fries since very few places have crinkle cut and they're my fav. When I picked up my food first thing I noticed (and I'm not a big eater) was the size of the burger... I said to myself \"did I accidentally order a $6.99 slider?\"... The burger was everything I expected and then some as far as taste, the melted cheese with every bite was nice (tho there were only like two bites). I just don't see how they justify the size of that baby burger, it was so off-putting... Have larger options  and charge more (like Smashburger), people will pay.  On to the fries... they looked amazing, I couldn't wait to dig in... when I did, right away I tasted subtle sweetness which I wasn't expecting and honestly didn't like. Also, they seemed like the store-bought frozen ones... Just straight nasty. People know what fresh tastes like....  Honestly, the fries ruined the meal, along with a pesky bully gnat that kept trying to have his way with my food and actually landed in my ketchup.  SMH. Bottom line is I'll never go back. I left hungry and feeling ripped off, not a good feeling."}
{"text":"I've always liked Shake Shack! This one is usually busy but still have great customer service! They were quick and it was clean. The cashier who helped me out today (I don't know her name) was really friendly! And they put my concrete on hold so it wouldn't melt while we ate out burgers! I love that that do that!"}
{"text":"I love all shake shacks Ive been to. The lines are always busy at this one but they have enough knowledgable staff to keep it moving. Clean bathrooms and never had a problem finding seating."}
{"text":"Wonderful chicken sandwich and fries, never disappoints.  Even with delivery, everything is fresh and delish"}
{"text":"+ Great burgers
  - The cheese option on the fries doesn't worth it"}
{"text":"Wanted to give it 2 stars, but I'm open to giving them another shot and bump the rating. Not great burgers, kinda bland actually. I got the smokeshack burger, honestly thought it lacked seasoning and the \"damn, that's flavor!\" aspect of eating a burger. You want the right amount of fat, greasy goodness that doesn't take away the flavor of the beer. Shack shack was more \"meh, I make better burgers at home.\" I want to try them again, every place has an off day, maybe last night was it for them."}
{"text":"There burgers here are good but, the price isn't! Lol

I love how their beef is organic, which too me is much more tastier! My son loves coming here after his football practice and he loves getting their malt shake. 

Atmosphere is nice and relaxing! Burgers, I think are a little small but, very tasty."}
{"text":"Been to ones in New York and I'm happy to say the quality at this one is spot on. It was a pretty long line just to order but the food came out quick. I've always liked their burger and fries (I may like it more than In-n-Out), though I wasn't a big fan of the hot dog. Will come back again if the lines aren't too bad."}
{"text":"First time here and I have heard so much about this place so decided to give it a try. I tried the chicken shack and it was delicious!! I'm a huge chic fil a person can't believe I found a place with a better chicken sandwich. The chicken was super crispy with pickles, I added cheese and a herb mayo. Not to mention crinkle cut fries which are my favorite. Will definitely try their burgers and concretes next time."}
{"text":"Don't be discouraged by the line. It moves quickly and the food is worth it. Their shake beer pairs really well with their burgers. Shroom burger and shack stack are really good. I really enjoyed how cheesy the Shack Stack was. The Smoke Stack does not come with veggies. You can ask for veggies when you receive your food or you can add it as you are ordering. Beef patty is a decent size and it is cooked perfectly! Their bread is not filling at all, melts with the burger. Glad I finally made the trip here!"}
{"text":"Our first time in, we dealt with a gentleman that took our order and answered ever question above and beyond our expectations. Our son has a severe peanut allergy and most quick service places do not know how to answer our questions or are educated about the details of the food preparation. This gentleman not only answered our questions but helped us in ordering all of our food and offered his opinion. I have been in the food service business for over 20 years and I can understand how hard it is to hire and train people, It is also impossible to teach someone to care if they don't want.  This  gentleman cared! I tried tipping upon paying and they were not allowed to tip. After eating our food I went up to this person and complimented him and told him how thankful I was. He said thank you it was a pleasure serving you, I am a retired officer and I love being around people, which is why I do this. How great is that?!! By the way... the food was good too."}
{"text":"The restaurant food was good. The service was very good. The decor was great! And the milkshakes were outstanding. Great place to grab a burger and some fries! Great service!!"}
{"text":"Everything was good except you have to ask for refills for your fountain drinks and it's too pricy."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Shake Shack for years in Philly and NYC, and being on the West Coast now, I was so excited to see the beloved establishment in Vegas. I was in Vegas for 5 days, I went to the Shake Shack 5 times.
- I always go for the Double Shack Burger - the beef is super moist, seasoned, tasty. The cheese is delicious as well.
- Crinkle cut fries - get them with cheese on it!
- Concretes are solid as well.
Be prepared for a quality, delicious burger here. The only drawback is I wish it were bigger!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack cheese burger on lettuce wrap was delicious. The burgers are organic meat and very tasty with their special sauce. The atmosphere had a lot of energy flowing through the restaurant. This location on the strip was crowded but the line went by quickly to our surprise. The food took a while but it was worth every moment. The custard ice cream was creamy and tasty. We definitely will be heading back to Shake Shack for a late night bite."}
{"text":"First time at Shake Shack... I didn't have any expectations but for the food to be delicious given the fanfare. However... I can't honestly say it was a great burger... I do like how the buns are cut only partially so your burger and condiments don't fall out. Other than that, Sorry. Just didn't cut it for me.

The fries were great though :) 

The milkshakes in my humble opinion are not worthy of the price tag. They are good but not blow your mind good. Maybe I'm too partial to my other burger joint favorites..facilities were clean and service was great. Which is a definite plus!"}
{"text":"Our son asked my husband and I to check out the burgers at Shake Shack as he had heard that they might be the best around. So, we had to try it out. We both ordered a Shake Shack cheeseburger. Well, OMG. Yup. We both gave it a #1 on the burgers list, even ahead of In & Out, Smashburger, and 5 Guys. Juicy, flavorful, fresh. The burger itself was outstanding, the bun was soft and just the right size, special sauce was, well, special! We were asked twice how we were doing by staff; the atmosphere was inviting and not too noisy. The line moved along quickly and efficiently. We will be back, and we'll bring our son if he would ever get out of his meeting!!"}
{"text":"The great food notwithstanding, I'd like to share my experience. I ordered a single patty burger, forgetting I usually get a double. I noticed when the lovely woman brought my food to my table. When I went to correct my own self-admitted error, they refused to let me pay for a new burger, or even the difference in price between the two, and brought it to me where I was sitting. They also let me keep the original burger (unhealthy but delicious snack for later). I don't know of another non-server-style restaurant that would treat me the same. A pleasant experience, A+++ for service."}
{"text":"Meh this place is whatever. It gets really packed quickly and they stay open late, which is a major plus especially in Vegas.

It was my first time here and I paid $15 for a burger, cheese fries and a milkshake. The burger honestly just tastes like something you can whip up at a picnic bbq. The cost of a burger here is almost an entire meal at In-N-Out. Nothing really impressive other than the decor and location. I thought it was really cute to put a Shake Shack in New York New York. Other than that, 3 stars goes to the cheese fries!"}
{"text":"First time here and I loved it. We tried the bacon cheeseburger, cheese fries, and hot dog with cheese. Finished it off with strawberry milkshake and doughnut concrete. The service was ok. The place was packed but people moved through pretty fast. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We are here today and it was as good as when I had it in New York. Shake Shack is one of my favorite burger joints and I think better then in n out. Can't wait till they open one in the LA area."}
{"text":"Very tasty! I'm in love with their brioche bun which is very soft and moist, and the bun is not cut across all the way so when ur eating the ingredients are not going to fall out the other side, genius! They have a special Shack sauce, which actually kinda tastes like garlic infused mayonnaise. The Shack burger will come with cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce, but if u want to add pickles or onions, they most definitely can. The cheese fries sauce are hot when they are served to you which makes it so much better, it's sort of similar to a nacho cheese. 

There are of course tables to sit at but there are also some lounge areas without a table. But I don't see it being a problem since your food is served to you on a metal tray which u can set in ur lap. Service is very friendly. It is located right outside the New York New York hotel right by the Brooklyn Bridge."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!! That was one of the best, if not THE Best Chicken Sandwich I have ever had. Located in downtown Summerlin this Shake Shack is so clean and the staff is really on top of things. Menu has a decent variety and is pet friendly meaning they actually have desserts for  your fur friends. Clever and cute little touch might I add. Super friendly service when taking our order which always makes my meal start off on a good note.

 Next the guy (Matthew)going around making sure everything was clean by wiping off tables, sweeping etc. was super friendly as well making a point to clean tables off with a separate,  and NEW wet wipe every time!!

 I watch this stuff my friends so you don't have to ;).

Food comes to our table the presentation looks good, however we all know that looks can be deceiving. I'm here to tell you that it not only looked good but,\" Oh My Gosh\" it tasted even better! So yummy it should be a sin. The buttery bun, the crispy batter -that hugged my chicken cooked perfectly might I add, was just absolutely delicious. Others including husband, reported their burgers to be so delicious as well, that we have decided to come here again for our next Saturday \"lets not cook day!\"  Best $40.06 spent on a splurge \"QUICK\" dinner for 3 in a long time.

Kudos staff at Shake Shack you guys are doing a fantastic job please keep up the good work!! Shake Shack Is AWESOME!! :)"}
{"text":"I really miss Shake Shack and when I saw it on the strip I was so excited. The mint strawberry lemonade is to die for and all of the burgers are amazing. I cannot wait to be in the same vicinity as Shake Shack again so I can veg on its excellence. The shack sauce always draws me in and the lemonade keeps me. I really do love Shake Shack."}
{"text":"The last time slave girl had shake shack was in New York a long time ago. Imagine how excited she was when we found one in Vegas. Since our friends never had it before either, we decided to hike up to get burgered up. (Oh yes it was a hike alright)

After trying it, I would say our In n Out still wins. Don't get me wrong though, it was still well above average and beats most burgers I had before. What really caught my eyes were the roasted red bell pepper they used in my smoke shack. Well played shake shack. We will return again even though you are pricy."}
{"text":"This place is all hype. The burgers are extremely overpriced and they are tiny burgers. $7 bucks for a small burger? Screw this place and avoid it."}
{"text":"Omg, their chicken sandwich was bomb! I am so glad I decided to try it rather than getting their burger. I have had their cheeseburger before, and to me there wasn't anything really special about it. It was good, but not the best I've had. However there isn't a shake shack back home, so when in Vegas, we had to stop.
Back to what I was saying... The chicken sandwich was amazing! Definitely a top contender, and a must try. The chicken breast used was super juicy and had a good flavor. The breading is their own recipe and they make it there in the restaurant. It was very good and the seasoning was on point. I usually like to add hot sauce to my chicken sandwiches, but it was good without, and I didn't want to take away from the good flavor. (My mouth is watering as I'm just thinking about it) I ordered the cheese fries and I don't think there was anything special about them. 
The place was busy, the line was long, but it moved fairly quickly. The prices were average, and the place was pretty large inside with many tables inside and out. If you are in the area and want a quick good bite to eat, check out their chicken sandwich. It won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is a burger heaven. The burger is perfectly cooked and just has some of the juiciest burger I've ever had. Melted cheese and their signature Shack sauce, you can't go wrong. Simple but so so good. The shakes are fantastic! Believe the Hype! From New york to Vegas! Its all good!"}
{"text":"In this day and age with todays technology, how can you open a restaurant in the nicest, cleanest mall in Vegas and NOT make your restrooms touch-free. How much money did they really save by opting for the cheaper , pull flush and touch faucet? 
   And if you wanna sit outside, be sure to put some OFF on your skin because the flies will be having a feast on your skin, thanks to the \"open top\" garbage cans they have in the patio.
  As for food, thats why i gave an extra star. Burger is promising. If it was served hot, i could consider 3 stars. But no, cold burger, terrible fries. $27 for 2 burgers, 1 fries and 2 drinks. For this price and location, i expected better."}
{"text":"It has been forever since I last ate at a Shake Shack.  I met up with a friend around dinner time.  The place was definitely bustling with people.  There was no line so we were able to look over the menu on the wall and order without problem.  We found a table and before I knew it my buzzer was going off.  I picked up my meal (regular cheeseburger and drink)  and headed to the condiment bar.  After getting what I needed, I sat down and began eating.  The burger was definitely fresh, not frozen.  The bun they used reminded me of the Hawaiian rolls from the store.  I had tomato, lettuce and the Shack sauce on my burger as well.  The different flavors really helped to enhance the flavor of the meat.  I'd say the burger size itself was about medium. A little bigger than a fast food burger but smaller than a traditional sit down restaurant.  The burger went down fast!

The menu is filled with tasty treats from burgers to chicken. Hot dogs to shakes.  They even have specialty drinks and beer.  Definitely a great place to meet up with friends and relax a little."}
{"text":"Omg, I loved it!!!  The atmosphere is so cool here...a nice lil hang out spot if you want to grab a bite to eat and people watch. There are some interesting people out there especially on Halloween night.  Anywho I ordered a single shake shake burger with cheese all the way (well done meat) and cheese fries.  Everything was delicious. I wish I wasn't leaving tomorrow morning else I would visit again. Anywho stop by here if you're in the area.  

Side note: My friend went to the other burger place...where's the burgers are \"plump\" and let's just say the Shake Shack seemed more organized. The other place were a little bit slow and one of the cooks was putting her fingers in her mouth. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Since I heard so much good reviews about this place. Got excited that they had one in Vegas. So had lunch on my last day in Vegas about a week or so ago. It was a tad expensive but OH MY GOODESS..it was really good...wouldn't mind going there again when I'm in Vegas..."}
{"text":"DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!  With that said by all means go try it and see for yourself this place is nothing more than a trendy overhyped overpriced waste of time.  I will say the Order via App option is solid and worked perfectly, food was ready promptly when promised and line was skipped accordingly.  

Someone said that this is the new best burger in Charlotte that is laughable at best.  I would obviously rank it above any of your big fast food chains, McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King etc etc it blows them away and it should.  It might be on par with 5 guys but for me falls below smash burger, hwy 55 and Culver's and wayback burgers which are your typical fast casual burger places and I feel offer a better product.  And I wouldn't even rank it with non chain places because it's not even in the same ball park.  

I tried double shack burger, the fried chicken sandwich the cheese fries, cheese is on the side, and a orange creamsicle float.  First things first the burger, meat quality is good, it had a nice char on the meat, taste was slightly above average but I found it to be overly salty for my tastes.  Chicken sandwich was excellent but you will still find better at a Chick-fil-A, sauce they use on the chicken sandwich was very very good.  Fries were good, crinkle cut and crispy on the outside, slightly different crinkle cut than the super mass produced shape most places serve, cheese sauce was meh for me, glad it was on the side I didn't really like it, it's suppose to be a blend of American and cheddar I believe but overall just lacked flavor for me.  My orange creamsicle float consisted of them handing me a cup with a small amount of ice cream/custard in the bottom and pointing me at the drink machine to fill it with orange soda, the order was to go I'm assuming if you dined in they might construct it for you but I could be wrong.  

There shakes which they are named after are $5+ which to me is laughable, now I don't mind spending money on food but to not offer any size option and have one price for a shake I think is kinda bad practice. My friend tried the shakes and said they weren't that good, they didn't even finish them and threw part of them out,  I will go back to try a shake just so I know for myself but I'm not expecting much.  

I have to commend them on their hype/advertising you would think it's the best food in the world and it was free if you just look at how busy they are and how long the line usually around the outside of the building is.  But for me that's all it was is a trendy overhyped place, if you want a better burger there are many many options available to you, and if you want a good milkshake for a lower price then you also have plenty of local options.  When I'm craving a burger I will go out of my way for a good place, this is not one of those places for me.  I will not say I'm never eating there again but I doubt I'll be back very much in the future just not worth it to me. 

I know food and I know burgers and this place is average at best, there are worse options and there are better options.  So go try it for yourself, form your on conclusion, and leave your own yelp review!"}
{"text":"The line was long when I arrived, but it moved quickly. 

I got the standard single hamburger. I think one patty is a good amount of meat (unlike what others may think of in and out's burgers). The ingredients all seemed very fresh. The onion is raw. I forgot to ask if they might grill it. They're very busy. The food takes a little longer than I would have liked to come out. Although, that might just be because my buzzer went off way before my food was actually done. 

The selection of drinks both alcoholic and made in house is quite large. I didn't get to try any this time but I will next time for sure. 

It's priced pretty decently for Vegas. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Yikes, bad all the way around. Had to wait because they forgot my order. Got a double burger and both patties were crispy and overcooked. Then when I take a bite, the cheese squirts out between the patties on to my shorts and leg. Epic fail."}
{"text":"Thank goodness that Shake Shack expanded in Las Vegas because I love coming to the Downtown Summerlin location. There's some other locations too that include The District in Henderson, The Premium Outlet Mall North, and of course, New York, New York hotel on the strip. I also just researched that it's at the T-Mobile Arena? Didn't even know that.

When Shake Shack first came to the strip, I didn't know what the hype was about. It was another burger joint from New York that was really popular. Anything that's hyped up, I have to try it. Their burgers are full of flavor with their known shack sauce and I also heard they are known for their cheese fries. \"Whatever I'm getting cheese fries.\" - Mean Girls

I usually get the Shack Burger and their cheese fries. I recently tried their Smoke Shack and bacon cheese fries and it was my new favorite! The Smoke Shack has these peppers and it gives it a little kick. Their menu is huge so there's a lot to choose from."}
{"text":"Had shake shack before when they first opened on the strip as my sister said it's a must try. It's my second time here since I was out with my sister shopping and wanted something fast to eat. In my opinion it's just a regular burger place, nothing special. I'd rather go to Bachi burger for the price. 

One good thing is that the place was busy and they kept cleaning tables for fast turnover."}
{"text":"I went to the location in Atlanta and loved It. Here was no different. I've already made my sentiments known about the food so I won't rinse and repeat. 
I will, however, repeat the complaining about the seating - or lack thereof. 

This place has been packed since opening day. Standing in a long crazy line in whatever weather Mother Nature decides to bestow on us. Whether it's pouring rain or sweltering heat, You wait in long lines outside the door just to order food. Once your order is in, it's another battle finding seating. Obviously if the lines are long, tables will be packed as well. If you're in a large group, good luck finding a seat for your entire party. But let's say you find a seat - whatever you do, you can NOT leave that seat without someone holding the table. People stand around with trays of food, searching for a table and once it's open, there are several folks waiting to grab your spot. I saw a lady with an infant who got up to grab a booster seat, and when she returned, another couple took her spot. The confrontation that followed... awkward... 

Limited seating is the only reason for losing a star."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time. Never got a chance to go when I was in NY. Came for lunch and luckily it wasn't too crowded. 

Shack Stack - I opted for this and while it was good, I'm not sure I really needed that fried shroom with cheese. I think it made it a bit salty. The bun was so soft and fresh. 

Coffee Shake - Good

Cheese Fries - I love fries, but these were just okay. 

ShackBurger - My brother got this and really enjoyed it.

I'm glad I tried it and would come back for a ShackBurger."}
{"text":"Amazing food for everyone! #gluten #vegan.  Service was extremely good and fast. This place has T.V.'s Stationed every where , Amazing for Rio '16. Very entertaining!"}
{"text":"All Shook up concrete was so delish. A refreshing & delicious desert to break away from the typical chocolate & vanilla. The banana peanut butter cheese cake was reminiscent of banana nut bread with just enough toffee to top it all off! I must come back! Plus fries were nice and crispy/fresh & friendly staff. A bit busy when we arrive, but they still managed to make awesome food. The burgers looked so delicious, that I wished I had a little more room to squeeze in a taste."}
{"text":"The hype is real!!! So the wait on this rainy opening night was still serious and the line was out the door at 9:30pm!!! 

To start off I've been to Shake Shack in NYC and the hype didn't hit me until the Queen City got their very own! 

On this visit we ordered 2 single patty ShackBurgers and a Cookie Butter Concrete. I was most excited about the concrete but once I tasted it it didn't really excite me. The concrete wasn't mixed that well and there was just one big glob of Cookie butter in the whole dish. (Note this is the opening day so you've got to allow for some hiccups). The star of the show tonight was the burgers and the fries!!! 

Now our order was togo since it was close to closing and I had the kiddos. So you know we grubbed on fries on the car ride home. The fries were amazing. Perfectly seasoned, fresh and hot! They didn't need anything else added to them ie ketchup, extra salt or even my southern staple: ranch. 

We didn't eat the burgers until we got home. My nephew got his custom burger order: Cheese, Pickle and Ketchup only. The ketchup is in a dispenser on the side and I had to grab a few to add to the burger once we got home. I got mine with Lettuce, Pickle and Shacksauce. The pickles are crisp and there was just enough Shacksauce. 

Just a note they don't have a kids menu (smaller kid size portions) but they do offer things kids would like like grilled cheese and hot dogs. My nephew was able to demolish a single patty Shackburger! 

Now to top off the experience they have the most amazing young lady named Consuela working the pick up line. She was very entertaining and kept everyone's spirits up. She made customers shimmy/shake for their food and had a very fun conversation with my nephew using the pagers. 

I'm really happy to have Shake Shack in the Park Road Shopping Center. They are a great addition. I can't wait for the menu to grow and to see what treats they have planned for the summer!!!

{"text":"I celebrated Fathers Day today with my three children and we had a great time. Excellent quality ingredients and an affordable price. On top of that they have all Father's free Custard. They came by three times checking in on me, we were all very satisfied and it's a great family stop at the Mall versus the Food Court."}
{"text":"The rivalry between Shake Shack and In N Out is real! I've always heard that this place is really good, but now that I've tried it, wow its pretty bomb!

Their menu is larger and has more options, but is still simple and easy to navigate. I have ordered the Smoke Shack and the Shack Stack which is basically a Cheeseburger with a fried stuffed portabello mushroom. Omg yassss both are so bomb! If you want something spicy, get the Smoke Shack, but if you want to experience greatness, the Shack Stack is my go to! And of course you gotta get the crinkle cut fries. Sooo perfectly crispy I love it! 

Besides the food, I have tried their shakes and their cold brew coffee and yes, I would highly recommend all of it! Obviously with better ingredients comes a steeper price which is fair. The best way I can describe this place is a midway between gourmet burgers and fast food. You get high quality ingredients (yeah none of that ice berg lettuce garbage), decent sized servings for a fair price. At In N Out, the food tastes just as amazing because of the spread sauce they use, but on a budget. If you're willing to spend $5-10 more for the meal, I'd choose this, otherwise you just can't beat the taste and price of In N Out!"}
{"text":"This place is WAY OVERPRICED!! Almost $6 for a shake, OVER $8 for a double cheeseburger and it comes with NOTHING! Seriously? Want fries? Oh, that's ANOTHER $3! Ridiculous! You can get the same thing (quality & quantity) at Wendy's for literally 1/4 th the price. NEVER AGAIN....."}
{"text":"Vegetarians and gluten free friends alike. They have options for you. I had a mushroom burger which consisted of a patty made of portability mushrooms and cheese as well as the signature sauce. It's tasted great and the service was quick."}
{"text":"My favorite burgers period! I was a fan of Inn N' Out until I had a Shake Shack burger.  They are worth the extra few bucks for a better tasting and quality burger."}
{"text":"Yum! Tried the shack stack, cheeseburger with a fried portabello  mushroom \"patty\". So cheesy, nice texture changes & tasty! Mushroom flavor was strong. It had a little sticker on the paper that said \"caution hot\". They weren't lying. I burned my tongue on the fried portabello, so wait a few minutes & let it cool. Cheesy fries were ok. Cheese sauce from a can I'm guessing. Next time I would just get the plain fries. Burger is not huge, so price was a bit high. But again, we're in Vegas on the strip at New York New York. I'd get the burger again!"}

{"text":"I couldn't decide whether to give this place two or three stars, but I think their dessert and cheese fries can account for the extra star. I was really excited to try this place with my friends because we were all really hungry waiting for the night. Simple menu with delicious choices, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. I got the snackmeister burger for 6.69. Kind of pricey, but it's probably in the novelty. The burger itself was just average. The meat was a little dry and salty, but all the toppings made up for it. My friend got the hot dog and it just looked like a measly little meat stick. It was a bit cold too :( A bit overpriced for what you're getting, in my opinion. I did, however, love the cheese fries. Carbs galore, so who can say no to that? The dessert was also really good. I believe it was the jackpot concrete, but I'm pretty sure I'm wrong. It had custard, sprinkles, and cake bits. CAKE BITS. It was definitely enough to share between three girls, and I'm glad we got it. If you're looking for something quick and filling, this can probably satisfy the craving. I just don't see the hype if you take out the name though."}
{"text":"Finally made it into shake shack recently and the interior is very nice + modern. I don't really get the comparison with in n out and while looking at other reviews, it seems as that is the case... While in n out is good, I don't think there is much to compare... 

Both establishments make a decent \"plain\" burger... I do think that the shake shack patties have a little more flavor than in n outs... Also, in n out fries taste like cardboard, idk how anyone could like those... Shake shack crinkly fries are good and so I guess that's where my comparisons end... In my opinion, I would rather hit up shake shack then get in n out... 

But enough about that...

I had the single Shackburger which comes standard with lettuce, tomato, and shake sauce... I also had an order of fries and the meal was good! 

The size of the single Shackburger is a little on the small side so with that said, next time I would go for the Double... They're small but not White Castle small...

Next time I hope to try the Double, the cheese fries, and a shake...."}
{"text":"Great concept, definitely better than in and out with a little more in price.  Hipster twist to the average hamburger joint with rustic and hip ambience.  Concretes are crave worthy and cheeseburgers are filling, perfect size for me.  Fries are exceptional.   Quick in and out service and will be back for more!"}
{"text":"This is my second time trying SS and it was just as delicious as the first time! First time I tried was at the vegas location and ever since been wanting to go again. The fries are soo good and crispy and the buns are really soft and fresh as everything else. There still a lot I want to try from here so I'll be back again maybe soon! You should try it too!"}
{"text":"A lot of people compare Shake Shack to In-N-Out. After trying both, I like both but for different reasons. I don't feel like they are comparable. In-N-Out is your typical burger that's just made fresh and with high quality, so it's a classic. Shack Shack I feel is a more high-end burger place, as you can see from it's higher pricing. They have more variety in the types of burgers on their menu, including the Shack Stack, which is what I ordered. It's a cheeseburger and a 'shroom burger (crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses) put together. So freakin' good. The cheese just oozes out of the mushroom when you bite into it and it's amazing. I'm usually not a fan of mushrooms but this made me a fan!

In addition, I got the crinkle cut fries. Shake Shack differs from most burger places because they have crinkle cut fries instead of just regular french fries. At first I was hesitant to get some because I'm not really a fan of crinkle cut. I feel like they're too soft and potato-y. However, these fries were pretty good! They were fried to a level of perfect crispness, unlike most crinkle cut fries.

Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Shake Shack. It's probably not a place that I would go to all the time due to the slightly high prices for a simple burger and fries. However, I will definitely come back when I feel like indulging a little."}
{"text":"Lived up to the hype for sure. Had cheeseburger add pickle and strawberry shake and fries. Everything was delicious and amazing. Loved the bun and the cheese and the burger. Sooooo good. Will be back!"}
{"text":"YOU GUYS.
I have something to confess.
I like Shake Shack better than In-N-Out Burger!

After first trying Shake Shack at the pop up event at the Source (in Denver), I was hooked! I knew I had to introduce everyone to it when we hit the strip!

++ Located just outside the New York, New York casino, it exudes all things NYC! Brooklyn bridge, I love NY signs and more surround the space!
++ Ample seating! Whether you're sitting inside to see where the magic happens, or outside on the patio, there is a spot for everyone!
++ Brooklyn beers on tap! Or freshly brewed tea, lemonade and soda for those none drinkers.
++ Staff is friendly and beyond efficient! They have the burger ordering process down to a well oiled machine - which runs smoothly!
++ Food is outstanding - duh! I opted for the \"Shack Stack\" which featured a cheeseburger and a fried cheese portabello mushroom topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce! Seriously, SO GOOD.
++ Hot dogs and chicken is also offered!
++ THE BEST CRINKLE FRIES EVER.
++ Open until 2am to curb those late night cravings!

While you will have to shell out a pretty penny to enjoy this greasy goodness (our bill for 2 burgers, 2 fries and 2 beers was $45!), it's entirely worth it!"}
{"text":"I love shake shack!!! My friend, who was originally from Chicago got me hooked!

I had the shack stack. The meat was so juicy and had lots of flavor. I also surprisingly enjoyed the fried mushroom with cheese in my burger! I am not a huge fan of fries, but I like theirs. I did not care so much about my chocolate milkshake. I think I did not like the chocolate that they used. 

On my second visit, I had the same order except I opted for their mango lemonade! Their lemonade tasted like REAL lemons were squeezed, so I recommend it!"}
{"text":"This was my very first stop after landing in Vegas. I've been here a handful of time, but I just had to take a first timer from California to compare Shake Shack vs. In-N-Out. We made it for lunch around 1pm on a Thursday and we were starving after our flight. Overall I'd have to give the edge to Shake Shack if you are willing to spend a little bit more, but quality for the price I'd lean towards In-N-Out (I've only been to the Vegas location, so even this might not be true against other locations). Definitely a must if you are in Vegas and craving a burger.

Food - 5/5
We tried their regular shack burger, crinkle cut fries, and of course a shake. The burger was simple, but delicious. The meat was juicy, the tomatoes and lettuce were fresh, and the bun was super soft. I enjoyed the crinkle cut fries as they have the extra surface area for more crispy goodness.

Service - 4/5
I was a bit surprised that the line was so short (~5 people). We were basically through the line and ordered within a few minutes. Maybe it was because we were so hungry and impatient that it felt like the food took forever, but the reality was that it came out in a reasonable amount of time. 

Ambience - 4/5
This particular location fills up quickly and seats for a big group (more than 4) can be challenging. It did end up getting noisy, but still an overall great spot to come with a small group to eat in."}
{"text":"I have to say that this place is the one I always look forward to eating at (other than Eggslut) whenever I'm in Vegas. All the other locations are in Manhattan so this is the closest to us. While I love my In-N-Out and Super Duper Burgers, this burger joint is definitely in my top 5 for fast food burger joints in the US. 

This Shake Shack is located on Las Vegas Blvd. at The Park outdoor area. It says on Yelp it's at the New York New York Hotel, but it's actually outside and not connected to the hotel. There's also another one inside the T-Mobile Arena which is only accessible if it's open for events. 

The reason I like this location more than the original one in Manhattan is that it's super spacious. (Maybe because the original is just a \"shack?\") You can bring your whole family plus extended family PLUS close friends. There's also extra tables outside. We usually go early when they just open so as to avoid the lunch rush. Even if you get there at that time, there will probably be a line at the door. But really, the wait is short. They expedite so well it's like a well-oiled machine! Another reason I love Shake Shack is that they have other tasty options;  like their Smoke Stack, Shroom Burger and Hot Dogs. They also have a more flavors of shakes than other places including new seasonal flavors each month. My favorite is their Chick'-N-Shack; their version of the Fried Chicken Sandwich."}
{"text":"Great Quality Food! I like Shake Shack--First time I had it was in Chicago back in January. They were super busy today, and they did pretty good considering they did not have training that long maybe like a week or so--We live in the area and we were definitely waiting for when they opened. If you are use to paying .99cents for burgers then you will feel the crunch at this place. This is for people who are use to quality food. We are use to paying around 8 bucks a burger at The Stand on Indian School. Glad we have a spot that uses great quality close by. 2 Burgers 2 Shakes and 1 Fry was a good 33 bucks. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Ordered cheese fries for delivery and received regular fries while being charged for cheese fries... not cool shake shack.... not cool"}
{"text":"Such fond memories of east coast work trips and vacation visits! So to my surprise seeing a Shake Shack was a must. 

This shake shack holds up to its name and its original east coast origins. The location is prime on the strip adjacent to the new T-Mobile arena. Be prepared to wait awhile since this location is super busy and a definite tourist hot spot! 

They have tons of seating indoor and outdoor. 

Their food is phenomenal as always! I always get the Portabella Mushroom burger with cheese fries. Their cheese fries are amazing!! The food tasted great and fresh!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. I heard this place was really good so I was super excited to finally get to try it out. 

I ordered the Shack Stack burger: Cheeseburger with a fried portobello mushroom & muenster cheese. It supposedly came with the shacksauce but I couldn't taste it at all. The mushroom had a VERY weird taste to it. I love mushrooms. I don't understand why the flavor was so weird. I didn't enjoy eating this burger at all. I can make better burgers at home myself. I hated the flavor so much I needed ranch with it but they didn't even have ranch -__-  
I also got a beer float. Which was chocolate beer and vanilla custard. It tasted like root beer... Still confused if they served me the root beer instead of real beer. I did not enjoy it either.

My boyfriend ordered a Smoke Shack: Cheeseburger with applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and shacksauce. The flavor on this burger was better than mine. It was very heavy on the peppers though. Still, didn't get to really taste that shacksauce because there wasn't a lot and the peppers over powered everything. 

We shared the Cheese fries: nothing special either. Crinkle cut fries that taste like they came out of those frozen bags from the store. There was no seasoning at all. The cheese didn't even taste good. Seems like they got generic canned cheese and threw it on top.

So, I don't understand the hype about this place. The meat on the burgers aren't even good quality. Very thin and not great in flavor either. Tasted to me like the patties from McDonalds' cheeseburgers."}
{"text":"Great spot for a juicy Shack Burger, shake, fries and their Shack Beer is recommended.  It's casual and fast nice outside seating."}
{"text":"With a few hours to spare before heading back to SF, I wanted to hit up as many restaurants as possible.  Prior to coming to Shake Shack, I had just scarfed down tacos and a slice of pizza hence why I only ordered fries and a milkshake but no burger.

Fries - Probably the best fast food fries that ever existed.  Super Duper use to be good and maybe it's the locations that I've visited recently but the fries are not crispy and super greasy.  Shake Shack however, has the perfect texture, taste, seasoning, crisp factor, and I did not feel guilty afterwards, well I never do.  
Black & White (Vanilla ice cream with drizzled fudge) milkshake - its hard to make milkshakes with the right consistency.  I was sucking pretty hard, my cheeks were starting to ache.  After letting it sit and melt for a bit, it did the job but I wasn't satisfied.

Overall, LOVE the fries.  Will have to revisit and try the burger."}
{"text":"When my friends asked me to come along to shake shack, I was a bit hesitant as I wanted to pig out at a buffet but oh man I'm glad I didn't ditch my friends. It was superb! I love shake shack. As I'm leaving a review now, I can't help drooling lol

I got a shack stack, cheese fries, and chocolate shake. Shack stack has this lil bomb of fried mush and cheese(?) in it. The moment you detonate it, the cheese oozes out and oh man.. Their fries are my favorite type of fries; fat and juicy. their chocolate shake was really chocolatey and somewhat heavy. Maybe I'll skip on the shake next time. 

I would have given this place five stars if it weren't for the price. I believe this is better than in-n-out but you could get three burgers at in n out with the money you spend at shake shack. 

I'm certainly glad I tried this place. if you like burgers, you should def try this!"}
{"text":"Basic basic basic.....it was small. It was aiight.   Was the hotdog suppose to taste cold?"}
{"text":"Wow! All I have to say this place is really good! I was reading others reviews and I was really surprised at what people had to say. 

First off yes it's pricey and if you're looking for a 99 cent burger then what are you doing here?? Go back to your processed fast food burgers for that! Lol their meat here is organic grass fed, and cage free. So you pay for what you get. 

Ok so I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and it was delicious! The chicken was fried to perfection! And if you complain about a crispy chicken sandwich being too greasy why are you ordering it?! They serve it with pickles and a herb mayo everything about that sandwich was amazing. 

I also got cheese fries, because why not. And they were ok I am not a huge fan of cheese fries in general, but the person I was with insisted. For dessert we got a strawberry milkshake it was yummy as well.

Customer service is great. Very friendly and helpful staff. The menu gets to the point. All in all it's pretty delicious and I am now a shake shack fan! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Eating there in person is good. Of course the burgers are overpriced but I'm paying for the no antibiotics and hormones in the meat. This is the only burger in town that doesn't make me physically ill. I have lots of food sensitivities and food allergies including gluten. I have no problem with Shake Shack except that their deliveries are done by Postmates which will be their downfall!

Postmates does their deliveries and I will NEVER order from them again! I ordered from them because my car is in the shop. Also, my son has a heart condition and can't be left alone. We waited over 2 hours for Gabby S. to bring our food. This scam artist never even drove close to my house! She claimed she delivered the food! 3 burgers cost me over $30! She basically stole my food! Postmates has NO CUSTOMER SERVICE PHONE NUMBER! They refunded less than what I paid for the food! You have to report problems in the app and wait for an email!

I deliver Postmates and if you can't make a delivery, they let you keep the food so this ghetto hood rat stole 3 burgers from two young kids, one of which is a heart patient! Trash! I wish only bad things on her like a gypsy curse or a fiery crash. I'm so sick of all the scams here."}
{"text":"Hit up the one out in New York and I liked it, so might as well try this one since I was at New York New York hotel and casino, hehehe.

Well, first off, it's definitely NOT a shack...but it's Vegas, so what do you expect?   It's a big huge restaurant on the strip; should be called \"Shake Palace, the Shake Shack's big brother out west.\" Anyway, one thing to note is that you cannot access it from the New York New York hotel and casino; you have to be ON Las Vegas blvd to get there, but that's not a problem. So if you're parking you can park at either Ny ny or Monte Carlo, I think it'd be the same distance.

Burgers...same as the shake shack out east; flavorful burgers, a little on the smaller side when compared to the likes of in n out, but definitely tasty and you get more options than the former.  Any burger is good, esp the spicy ones, I usually go for two different types of single stacks, a regular and one of the other types and of course a hand-spun shake. And this being Vegas, we here have the option of alcoholic beverages with one's burger, always a plus.  

Service staff, was good and friendly and they try to keep the line goin, but the place can get rather crowded and it's hard to find a table sometimes, so you'll have to find the best non-peak time to go. 

BUT...as Vegas goes, you gave a ton of better options, so I would come here if I had a big craving for a shake, and if it wasn't busy and I was already close by. Otherwise, I would rather go to a Vegas Buffet or somewhere else...when in Rome..."}
{"text":"Whoa, are these hamburgers small.  The ingredients are very good.  

Loved the chicken sandwich and the garlic mayo. Also, loved all the pickles on my sandwich.  

The fries with cheese and peppers was very good as well.  I would order those again. 

Not a fan of the 50/50 drink at all.  It was very watered down. 

This location is snooty, not the employees, but the patrons.  

I would visit shake shack again, if some was inviting me or wanted to go, but it would not be my go to choice."}
{"text":"Starting out in 2001 as a simple hot dog cart in Madison Square Park, Shake Shack has phenomenally expanded all over the world, including locations in Japan and Russia!  Hearing all the rave reviews from friends, it was on the top of my Must-Eat-List on a recent trip to Las Vegas.

Conveniently located outside the New York New York Hotel and Casino, Shake Shack is known for their long lines.  As we waited, my dad was in awe of why all these people would wait and laughed that it was just a burger.  But then he had his first ShackBurger.  He admitted that it was very good and that the sauce really set it apart.  I totally agreed.

While the burger is on the small side (I could easily eat two!), it is made from 100% all-natural Angus beef and cooked to medium (unless you request otherwise, but don't you dare!).  I absolutely loved the soft potato roll it's served on.  The crinkle cut fries were delicious as well.  Didn't try a shake, but saving that for next time.  Definitely worth the wait at least once in your life!"}
{"text":"The portions are actually appropriate, and the burger meat was seriously amazing!!!  Bit pricy for what you get, but realistically its the strip sooo...  Overall great quick stop while on your adventures!"}
{"text":"The hype for this burger joint is palpable- but I don't think it really lived up to the spectacular reviews. The service was great and the lady taking my order was really pleasant and friendly! The food was good but \"nothing to write home about.\" The fries were honestly the best part of the meal!"}
{"text":"Our first time at this legendary burger joint.  Location is beautiful, full of modern touches.   Food was good, but nothing amazing. Definitely better than In and Out, but nothing compared to a place like Pearl's in San Francisco. Note the entrance is on the Strip, so you have to exit New York, New York and walk around.

 Picks:
ShackBurger ($5.19 Single) Cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce was good but not great like expected. Good ingredients but not much meat.

SmokeShack ($6.74) Cheeseburger topped with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and ShackSauce. The addition of bacon helped a little, but we did not detect high quality smoked bacon.

'Shroom Burger (vegetarian) ($6.99) Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce. Anything deep fried is tasty, even veggies.  Not very healthy though, but its Vegas Baby!

Shack-cago Dog ($4) Dragged through the garden with Rick's Picks Shack relish, onion, cucumber, pickle, tomato, sport pepper, celery salt and mustard. This one actually impressed us more than the burgers.

Crinkle Cut Fries ($2.95) were fantastic.  If only the burger could be this good.

Hand-spun vanilla Shake ($5.25) 640 calories and worth it. Thick and creamy.

Creamsicle Float ($5.25) was beautiful and hit the spot. (It was 105 degrees outside)

Just OK:
None

Would not reorder:
None

Overall - Good
Food - Very Good
Decor - Very Good
Service - Very Good
Value - Good

Would we come back - Maybe"}
{"text":"Honestly overrated. Heard all my friends talking about how I needed to come to this place. I got a shack burger and fries and feel like I got jipped. Came out and it looked like a kids meal. Wasn't worth $10. Fries aren't special. Really nothing special about it. I also got a peach concrete and legit spent $5 for vanilla ice cream. They didn't mix anything in and the pager to notify me when it was ready didn't go off so my ice cream was also melted. Not impressed. So if you want to spend $15 for a $5 meal in my mind go ahead. Save your money and eat at McDonalds."}
{"text":"I'm not a burger person so I was iffy about trying shake shack. They don't have it where I live so my friends wanted to try. I ended up getting the shroom burger and I really liked it. I like how the cheese is inside the mushroom and then the mushroom is deep fried. The burger itself was kind of on the small side. Cheese fries were not bad. I also tried the beer float. I think it was the frozen custard in Guinness beer and it tasted really bitter to me. I didn't get a chance to try their shakes so maybe if I get a chance to go again I can get one."}
{"text":"Totally worth all of the hype! I know. I know. I went to a chain restaurant and was excited!

Here's the breakdown.

We went at almost 2pm on a Monday and since we had reservations for a restaurant later that night we decided to split everything. Oh, and we didn't have any sort of line when we went.

Single shackburger - fan-freaking-tastic!
Shackago dog - no poppy seed bun but still delicious none-the-less
Small order of fries - so damn good! (I'm usually not one for \"crinkle\" fries but these were awesome!)

Didn't try the shake - will put on my to-do list for the next Vegas trip

I really liked the way the inside of the restaurant was set up. Had some seating areas that looked as though they would evoke conversation rather than people keeping their faces buried in their phones.

And the tables had a branding on them that said they were previously parts of a bowling lane in NY. Love the repurposed wood.

Lots of tables outside."}
{"text":"Food was alright. I tried the Chick'n'Shack, fries, and mint cookies and creams shake. All for $15, and really friendly service. Really good!"}
{"text":"I've only heard people rave about this place in New York.  They finally opened one up on the West Coast.  Vegas of all places.  Why not?  Tourists galore and it fits within the hole idea of being \"in New York\" since it's located at the New York, New York Hotel.

If you take a taxi, you have to pretty much make your way onto the Las Vegas Strip outside.

Ordered a Single ShackBurger and Cheese Fries.  My gf got the Shack Stack and regular fries.

My ShackBurger was okay.  It reminded me of a Wendy's burger.  My girlfriend's Shack Stack is a burger with a big piece of breaded mushroom.  That was alright except for the fact that it's priced at $10.  Worth $10?  No way.

As for the Cheese Fries.  Eh.  Cheese sauce on crinkle-cut fries.  Didn't wow me.  The regular crinkle-cut fries, it works.

Not sure how people can compare this to In N Out.  This place reminded me of Wendy's.  Sorry.  Not to say I wouldn't come back.  It's not something I'd crave."}
{"text":"I don't do a lot of fast food so its a pretty good burger for fast food. Burger is seasoned, bread is soft and sweet, I enjoy when I'm having a cheat day. I don't like a lot of condiments so I never get the shack sauce so I can't comment too much on that. The fries are ok, not worth the calories so I usually skip them unless I'm having a bad day then fries it is but they are just okay. Service always good not always fast. They are usually pretty busy, probably because its new. I like that they have beer and wine so you could actually make it a date but won't be mad if you just stick with the mint lemonade because its good too. Can kinda get expensive but heck you won't be going every day. If you haven't ever been try it, but don't get carried away with the whole wait in line for it, its just not that serious."}
{"text":"Shake Shack has been on my \"I want to try list\" for a long time. I love burgers, and in Reno, NV, it's hard to find a good one. 

We made a special trip to this mall, just so I could try SS. 

I have to say the burger was 4 stars. I asked for it cooked medium, but it came out just under well done. If you cook BURGERS for your business, this is a BIG DEAL and something that Inn and Out with the smaller burgers has ALWAYS done right! 

I tried the Custard, sounds amazing, did not deliver in the flavor department. I was expecting something to WOW me, and it was okay, probably would never order again. 

I tried the Fries at $2.99, I thought they were pricey, but hey I need to get the whole experience, and okay, not sure if they are fresh on site or frozen, but at that price point if I had a SS in Reno, I would only order the fries sometimes. 

My burger was definitely the best part at just under $6, I was a Fan, and would dine there again, and try the different versions, like bacon, mushroom, etc."}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack, but my husband begs to differ. I am one of those few who can honestly say that it's better than In n Out. Many people think I'm crazy and I think it's because they have so much West Coast pride that they don't want to admit it or if it's because I'm sick of In n Out all together. Either way, I must say Shake Shack is oh so divine. Yes, it's not as cheap as In n Out, but their potato buns are so soft, the patties are juicy, different toppings to choose from and it's just delicious. 

Does In n Out have mushrooms? No. Does In n Out have bacon? No. Does In n Out have beer and wine? Nope.

The first time I tried Shake Shack was in New York, we fell in line for over 30 minutes and it was definitely worth it! Thank God, amen, alleluia they opened one in Las Vegas and Los Angeles!

My favorite hands down is the Shack burger with bacon! Plus, this place serves wine, hello!!! Today we tried their newest burger, the Bacon Cheddar Shack burger. It was pretty good.

I can't stop drooling about Shake Shack. I wish they would open one in Orange County, it wouldn't even be a competition to In n Out."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I was excited to see what the hype was about. Personally I found it to be over priced and just meh. I definitely prefer In-n-out. However, the fries were really great."}
{"text":"Went here last night, what a treat! 

I had their mushroom burger and it was outstanding! I was pleased that they serve this burger on a gluten free bread. To my surprise the burger was breaded though, ixnaing the whole \"gluten free\" deal but my stomach ache was well worth it!!"}
{"text":"We enjoy a good hamburger and got one here. The drawback was the size, it's kinda small. I was expecting the size to be like 5 Guys or Hamburger Habit. I had the regular cheeseburger. Fresh tasting bun, meat was tasty and not over cooked. Had the chocolate malt, very good BUT too pricey for the size. 
We stopped in cuz this place was featured on 60 Minutes. Service wad good, staff helpful.
We won't make another special trip to eat here."}
{"text":"As a native SoCal girl, I was a little skeptical of Shake Shack. I mean, why, In-n-Out is easily the best burger in the NATION. But I followed the hype during my last 3 trips to Sin City and found my way to its sunny outdoors location right outside New York New York.

My first trip in February, I got the classic ShackBurger, which is basically a fancy cheeseburger with fancy pink sauce, their famous ShackSauce. Eh, it was okay. While I thought the yellow-y bun was good, the meat was a little over-cooked and definitely didn't sink into my mouth. The next trip, in June, I decided to go with something a little different, venturing over to their flat-top dogs. (Why is it called that?) I got the ShackMeister Dog (again, with the weird names--In&Out keeps it simple/classic) which has cheese sauce and \"Ale-marinated shallots.\" Whatever those are. For $4, it's a pretty decent size/interesting taste, but it's definitely not a meal. Finished it in four or five bites... so I had to order the cheese fries. Which are basically crinkle-cut fries with melted American cheese on it. Meh, I'd give that trip's meal a solid 6, maybe 7.

But this past weekend's trip, on Halloween--now THAT was a game changer. I wanted to take my boyfriend here because it was his first time in Vegas with me, and I wanted to see what he thought of the infamous East Coast fast food chain. In short: he got the SmokeStack, satisfying his love of bacon, and he LOVED it. Said the bacon made it amazing and he was the best thing he's had. (But he still likes the Habit better.) And i went back to the burger route, this time trying something new and WAY better--the Shack Stack, combining my love of traditional cheeseburgers and mushrooms (not the gross kind)! and I don't know if it was hunger or the long night before or what, but it was HEAVEN. Finally, something that combines all my taste buds with something different and new--a twist on the classic Cheeseburger--and I'm a fan. 

Overall, ShakeShack is pretty good. It's a pretty quality burger. And when in Vegas, it's definitely one of those must-go stops because it's the closest one to the West Coast. But hey, I'm from Southern California, so I gotta be loyal."}
{"text":"Living in NY, I'm a big fan of Shake Shack, and I was so excited to finally enjoy it on the west coast! This Vegas location is pretty big with a lot of seating, larger than any of the NY ones I've visited. It's also brand new and really nice with a large tv screen in the middle. 

I came at 1am and there weren't too many people in line, they close at 2am. Found out that one of the managers came from NY, awesome! The food was as great as I remember, and my BF commented that he liked it even better than the Shake Shack we had in NY. Service was on point, and we got our food pretty quickly. This place looks like a well oiled machine!

Must get the shack stack, the portabello burger on top of the cheeseburger is incredible, especially when you take that first bite and the muenster cheese ozzes out! And those crinkle cut cheese fries are so good, I have dreams about them! And can't forget about those shakes!"}
{"text":"I think the burgers were okay. The meat was good but I felt like I could've made a better burger at home. The employees were great and the food was brought out in a timely manner. Kudos!!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait! First time here. Great food, great drinks and great dessert.
Family of 4- shroom burger, shack burger, spicy shack burger, plain hot dog, 2 cheese fries, 1 regular fries, lg grape fanta, 2 regular fifty/fifty (organic Arnold Palmer) no refills on drinks but self serve water available and double scoop shack attack= $52
Burgers are small but good! Buns are soft and sweet like Hawaiian buns. Give it a try! 4****'s for the burger size but enough for me, hubby still hungry."}
{"text":"I didnt think that the burgers were gonna be that great. Seeing 3 stars i really wasnt expecting much. The pictures are what really sold me to come here and im glad i did. It reminds me of In n Out except the meat seems to be a lot bigger and seasoned. I got their double shack burger and i just fell in love.
I cant really tell what the Shack sauce is supposed to be and i couldnt really tell it was there. The bun was buttery and soft. The cheese just oozed everywhere.
5/5!

As far as the french fries im not much of a fry person. But these were crispy and perfect. Ugh, you can tell just by looking at them that they are going to be perfect.
5/5!

Try their strawberry mint lemonade its different but soo good!

What i will say though is this place is really over priced.. my meal for a drink, fries and a burger was $17. You pay for everything on the side, nothing comes as a meal which is what makes it so pricey.. be ready to PAY because you most certainly will.

Will i come back? Yes!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. The smoke stack burger is amazing. The cheese fries are hot and crisp. The shack' cago  dog was also amazing.  For the money this place is easily the best deal in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best burger we've ever had. Their hotdog had the best pickles on them! Not too pickled and still very crisp and refreshing. If you order the beer float, give it some time to melt. It's better that way."}
{"text":"Yessssss. Shake Shack is delicious! 
I guess since everyone else compares it to In N Out, I should too.....yea, Shake Shack is better.
There are so many delicious options that it's not even a contest.
I got the Smoke Stack (Cheeseburger topped with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, Shack Sauce), it was delicious and I would get it again. We also shared Cheese Fries, I would also order those again. We also shared a Black & White Malt, I would probably try a different one just because there are so many to choose from. 
Thank goodness this location is on the strip in Vegas, where you can walk all those calories off."}
{"text":"Came here during vacation and I can guarantee the smokeshack(bacon, diced tomatoes cheeseburger) is one of the most unique burger I ever had. The diced tomatoes are like no other. It doesn't have that plain tomato taste but rather a very interesting spicy bell pepper tomato taste. It was very delicious. It's a must try!!! I also go the bacon cheese fries. For both the item it costed about $14. My sister only complaint was that she wish the buns were toasted but I prefer my buns the exact way they made it. (Untoasted) so if you prefer your buns toasted, remember to ask them if they could. It was my first meal at Vegas and my last. Out of all the restaurant I went to in Vegas, Shake stack had definitely left a good impression on me. I will definitely be missing this place at home."}
{"text":"Since this is a touristy place, it might take a while for you to place an order because some customers barely speak English. Anyways, tried this place out and it wasn't too bad. The fries was good. The bacon cheese fries was good also. The chili dog was ok but the cheese sauce was good! Seating can be limited so if you see a group or couple leaving, best to take the seats as soon as you can! Also, there are seatings outside if you don't want to eat inside."}
{"text":"Shake Shack was authentic and old school. Trying to figure out what makes it so delicious and we think it's the oil that is used to prepare the fries and burgers."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this is the only fast food review I have ever written, but c'est la vie; if I see a Shake Shack I will eat there. I have been to this location a couple of times in Phoenix now and it has been super clean, super prompt with service, and hella delicious. Shake Shack lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in the area. The location is very convenient, on the New York New York hotel facing the strip. As a matter of fact, this appears to be the only Shake Shack on the Strip. You can easily get here if you are staying in any of the several hotels nearby. 

The food, specially the burgers and the fries, are amazing and you can taste that it is made with quality ingredients. You can't beat a Double Shackburger with a side of Cheese Fries and a pint of ShackMeister Ale. Plus, the prices are exceptionally reasonable compared with other food joints in Vegas. Two people can have a proper meal for less than 30 bucks.

Service is above average.

During our stay in Vegas they had this special oktoberfest-themed menu, from which I had the chance to order a Bratburger (Hamburger topped with a flat-top griddled Usinger's cheddar-stuffed bratwurst, crispy ShackMeister Ale-marinated shallots and ShackSauce) and the aforementioned ShackMeister Ale. \"Sehr gut!\""}
{"text":"Alright yall. This place is bomb.com. The line can get pretty long so expect to wait during peak hours. There's a window outside if you're just ordering drinks but otherwise, you gotta order inside. The workers are very friendly. You order your food, receive a buzzer, and then pick up your food at the counter when your buzzer rings. 

Cheese fries. YES. Get it. I got a hamburger with their specialty sauce on the side. YUM. I liked having the sauce on the side because sometimes, sauce can get overwhelming. The quality of their ingredients is mm mm mm! Good! GET THEIR STRAWBERRY LEMONADE AND ROOT BEER! Soooooooo freaking good. And on top of that, FREE REFILLS! The only thing I didn't really like was that they waste cups. They give you a new cup with every refill. Some people may prefer it this way, but I'm pretty sure they go through a gang of cups a day. 

They have indoor seating and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating can get hot in the summer but they have misters outside (not that it's that helpful when it's 100+ outside). I heard the East Coast locations are way better but hey, I've never had it there and I got nothing to compare it to. Therefore, I'm just sticking with \"This place is BOMB\""}
{"text":"I heard this was like an In-n-Out but with more choices. I think I might like this more than In-n-Out. I ordered a shack stack with bacon and man, it was so delicious. Their fried portobello mushroom with melted cheese inside is to die for. I never had something like that and oh my god, I'm so happy I was able to experience such delicious-ness. I wish they had avocado as a topping because that would have made it more delicious. And man oh man, their crinkle cut fries tastes so much better than In-n-Out fresh cut fries. I can probably eat a whole basket to myself but the burger surprisingly filled me up before I could even finish it. Don't let the small burger deceive you and over order! 

The only con was that the burger was a little too greasy for my liking, making it hard to finish but it was good so I had to force myself to finish it lol. Also, their cheese fries are a disappointment. The cheese is the cheese you would buy in bulk to make nachos, you should skip that. Be prepared to wait forever though because the lines are crazy. Thankfully my friends ordered to-go for me and I didn't have to wait half hour-45 mins to get this delicious-ness. 

When I come back to Vegas, this will be one of the places I must eat at again. So nom!!!!"}
{"text":"Go someplace else!!!!  Teeny tiny burgers aren't worth the money.  I could have eaten 2!!  We stood in a super long line and then had to scramble to get a table for this???  They don't taste bad, just super small.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Good eats but can't better 'Inn N Out'. Cost is outrageous when comparing the two. 
Still good tasting though."}
{"text":"YUCK pretty much sums up what I thought of this place. Can we rename it Shit Shack? That's what it should be called. 
My friend and I got the shack burger, fries, and a drink. Total was almost $12 (this is how much I pay for a burger at Delux, which is wayyyy better and gourmet). At that point I wasn't bothered by the cost. We took a seat outside and our buzzer went off. 
The burger is TINY. It's almost like a slider. I took a bite of the burger and was extremely underwhelmed. So I took another bite and another and nothing. It was gross. The drink was a small...but this drink was also tiny! The fries were just whatever. They tasted like regular frozen fries. So disappointing. 

The restaurant itself is nice. Service is ok. Not only is it not worth $12 but I wouldn't even pay $6. I'll stick to In-N-Out."}
{"text":"One of the many reasons I will return is because of Ron. He let me try the beer and explained the food to extraordinary detail before I ordered it! And it came out as described to a T. I will come back because of Ron he visited the table as we finished to check on us to make sure the meal was up to our standards and it was exceptional!!! One of the many reason will come back is Ron described the Food Perfectly and came out as described!"}
{"text":"First off awesome burger. Double shack had good flavor. No complaints on the food. Now customer service. We were sitting near the restroom and happened to see two employees  cleaning or trying to at least to clean the restroom. ( female ). One girl goes in and comes out laughing, other girl said something to the nature of watch it someone is in the stall. Then she goes in, at this time a customer comes out in a hurry and looked back embarrassed but she walked outside.  Then comes out the other employee laughing. Both employees now laughing all the way to the counter/ kitchen area letting everyone know and laughing for over 4 minutes that the restroom smelled. Various other female customers were a bit mad that they would come out laughing and embarrassed a customer. Those two would not work in my retail stores. They need training in customer service skills. If u see employees near restrooms prepare to be embarrassed. At your own risk. The two ladies that had great customer service and not sure who the are, but one took our order an the other one was trying to clean the tables."}
{"text":"I went here last week for a milkshake. I'm glad I didn't want food because that line was out the door! But if you want a milkshake you can go to a separate beverage line outside. There was no one in this line so I was able to be quickly served with the salted caramel milkshake I had been craving! The milkshake is thick so if you order one you might want to ask for a spoon. It was very good.

On a side note if you do come here for food try the Cherry Bomber, by far the best burger on the menu!"}
{"text":"My bf and I were at Downtown Summerlin yesterday afternoon and were looking at the directory for somewhere to eat. \"Pieology.... Rice Republic... Ribs & Burgers... CRAVE... SHAKE SHACK?!?! OMG.\" We absolutely love the flavors of their burgers. This is the burger we crave over every other burger in town and we never knew there was a Shake Shack with much easier access than the New York New York restaurant. We quickly made our decision and explored the quiet, relaxing, landscaped area of the mall on our way over. 

When we arrived we noticed an awesome ping pong table outside which I turned down just in case I was awful at playing ping pong. I didn't want to hit any cars parked on the curb right next to the table. I ordered my regular, the ShackBurger and took a look at the concretes and custards. I noticed a smores concrete, specific to Downtown Summerlin's menu which was awesome. When I went to my first Shake Shack in Washington D.C., I had a s'mores concrete and I was always looking forward to having another one but there were never any on The Strip. My bf ordered the new ChickenShack which he really enjoyed. He was actually upset when he was done with it. haha! He also ordered the brown sugar (the flavor of the week) shake. 

Overall, it was a great lunch experience. The cashier was a sweetheart. Our food was prepared fast and the burgers/sandwiches lived up to our standards. The desserts were sadly not enjoyed by either of us. We actually decided that we would stop ordering the desserts from there. That's alright though because those burgers and fries will always have us coming back for more."}
{"text":"Yummmm. The cashiers are always friendly. The burgers are always on point. I would choose Shake Shack over any other burger place any day. When you take your first bite of their burgers it's as if angels start singing. There is so much flavor! & I only order the most simple burger, the shack burger. I actually enjoy the fries more without the cheese sauce. Also, the custard favors are always a hit or miss. Sometimes the flavor is fantastic... Sometimes it isn't enjoyable at all. BUT- that's just from what I ordered anyways. I also love the design of the place and the ambience. Best burger place ever!"}
{"text":"After hearing Danny Meyer speak at a work event about hospitality and the principles of their industry leading restaurants, I couldn't wait to try Shake Shack during our stay in Vegas! I dragged a group of 6 that would probably have rather stayed in our hotel across the street out in 115 degree weather to make the walk for lunch, and couldn't be happier we did! 

Very simple menu which makes it easy for a newbie to figure out. The place was PACKED so we did have to scope a table for a bit but managed to get one all together. I'm not entirely sure what the shack sauce is, but I wish I could bottle it up and drink it. The guys got shakes and loved them. One person in our group even commented that it was the best burger they ever had. I just saw online that they brought one to Westchester, OH, so I sure hope that Louisville, KY will be on the list soon!"}
{"text":"Finally got my shake shack fix after trying it for the first time in NYC in 2011 so I was pretty excited when I heard they opened one in Vegas! My favorite is the shack stack burger that has a Portobello mushroom in it. That first bite had cheese oozing out of it yum! Lines move quickly and they're located at NYNY next outside of the hotel next to Toms Urban."}
{"text":"First time I've eaten at Shake Shack. I ordered a Chicago- style hot dog, some cheese fries and Prosecco! All was delicious. I kinda wish the portion was a little larger, but I was satisfied, nonetheless. Loved the Prosecco!"}
{"text":"First stop to eat when arriving at Vegas. Line was long, but quick. The food options were simple but vast. I loved the interior, it was so urby like. I got a simple cheeseburger. The only thing that made me knock off a star was the fact that i asked for grilled onions, and then when I got my food, they put an onion in it, but it was not grilled...sad thing is also that the person who gave me my food said they do not do grilled onions....is it so hard to throw an onion on a grill? :( anyways! Besides the point, food and experience was great. Even though it was pricy, the quality and freshness was worth it. The bun was different, but so fluffy and yummy."}
{"text":"Since the Hollywood location was always so busy, I was eager to try this location while on a business trip in Las Vegas. I wanted to see what is the hype for myself. I ordered the Shake Stack. A portobello mushroom filled with muenster and cheddar cheese serve on top of a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato and the shakesauce on a potato bun. The burger was juicy, taste fresh and the bun was soft to absorb the beef burger. The crinkle cut cheese fries was just okay. Not a fan of the processed cheese topping. Overall quality was just okay and does not compare to our West Coast favorite In and Out. Also the price is higher than your average burger joints prices. Love the location, but not a fan of the food."}
{"text":"I think Shake Shack is really good, but it's just super pricey for what it is. I think it's a little over $6 for a Shackburger (just a cheeseburger) which I can finish in like 5 bites. You have to order fries separately. Would probably come back here sometime when I'm in Vegas but when the LA locations open up, I wouldn't drive that far for it when In N Out is cheaper and closer :)"}
{"text":"We were having my daughters birthday at build a bear, it was raining all day, we switched plans for food and went here. Did not tell anyone we were coming or celebrating anything just ordered food like normal. The manager and several members of the staff went way above and beyond any expectations. They tended to our group, gave free custard, sang happy birthday, and treated us like we planned the whole thing in advance. The food was hot, delicious, and the order was perfect. Burgers were great, kids devoured the hot dogs, fries weren't to salty, shakes were great, and what a great bonus moms got a drink too! The custard is also wonderful!  What a great experience overall, thank you to the entire staff! I only messed up by not getting names!"}
{"text":"This place is good. Very tasty burgers, fries, and shakes. Pricing is fair based on recent trends of no combinations with meals. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Went here for our cheat day. Happy they opened a Henderson location. It's right across from REI. They make a good product and they have been consistent. I enjoy their juicy burgers and my hubby loves their peanut butter shakes. We shared that huge tub of fries with melted cheese, bacon, and red peppers. All I can say if you're doing a cheat day, this is the place lol. Service was attentive and courteous. The place is new and clean. We'll be back on another cheat day!!"}
{"text":"Best burgers on the strip if you haven't been to eat here you're missing out we need this restaurant in Australia"}
{"text":"These burgers and fries are delicious, definitely try the cheese fries!!!! Tried the black & white shake sooooo good !!!! Very happy we stopped in !!!"}
{"text":"Of course it's good! The burgers are no frills but taste great! The shakes are yummy! I would definitely pick this place for a burger over the Gordon Ramsey BurGR restaurant at Planet Hollywood!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Every time we've attempted Shake Shack in NYC, it's been a crazy line and we've headed somewhere else. This time in Vegas, we decided to wait it out and I'm glad we did.  Not cheap but not super pricey either.  I had the Smoke Shack Burger with a giant beer and some cheese fries it was great.  I'll get slammed for this but I liked it better than In N'Out which we visited the next day.  In N'Out was cheaper and quicker but not better.  Put me on team Shake Shack."}
{"text":"This place is way over priced. We paid a little over $30 for 2 burgers, 2 fries, and 2 shakes. Honestly, there was nothing special about the meal, the actual burger was pretty tasteless, thankfully it had toppings. If this had cost $10 we wouldn't feel like we were robbed, but since it was $30+, we were robbed. I think those who say it's great must be drinking and not notice the lack of flavor, quality, and the high price. Wendy's does a lot better with a burger than this place. 
  I will say, the shakes were good, but really small for the $5.19 cost! 
  At least we learned one thing: were not going to get robbed by the Shake Shack again."}
{"text":"I don't see what's so exciting about this place, In N Out is definitely the winner in this rivalry battle.
Their menu is large and more extensive than In N Out, but I'd honestly rather have 5 solid options than 10 so-so ones. 
I think their best things are their shakes(haha), but their burgers were sub-par to what people hype it up to be, and their fries and burger buns were a bit wet. WHY?!"}
{"text":"The burgers are good. I do give them that.
The fries taste store bought. They were okay.
There cheese sauce they put on the fries was nothing impressive at all. Bland really.
Lemonade is good.
Little over priced to be honest. 
$26 for 2 burgers/ 1 lemonade/ and cheese fries.  
Portion was small. Between the two of us eating we are still hungry. 
Simple menu and service was great.
Basically over priced/ spoofed up fast food. 
A 3 is fair."}
{"text":"Been waiting on Shake shack for almost a year now ... worth the wait. The burgers are great and the fries very tasty. Location and wait for beverages are the main issues with this place. There is no NYNY entrance, just LV blvd."}
{"text":"Given its location, the staff here deserve a million and one free milkshakes/pats on the back/extended lunch breaks. Yes, the line is always long. But also yes, the staff will get your food to you quickly and in an organized fashion (I love the little food buzzers almost more than life itself.) Corraling a horde of drunk hamburger enthusiasts sounds like my personal hell, so more power to 'em for cranking out delicious drunchies all day long. 
You kinda know what to expect as far as food, but I will say as an avid In-N-Out fan, I find myself craving Shake Shack because it's different, in a good way. Come here after the dayclub, you need it in your life."}
{"text":"After all the \"hype\" people said about Shake Shack I expected more. Yes, there is a line to wait but there is no space whatsoever. I was mashed between 2 strangers. When I finally got to the front to order, the cashier kept laughing and looking at the other cashier. I got a single shack burger, cheese fries, bacon cheese fries, and 2 chocolate shakes. It came to a total of $24.25. A little expensive for that but I figure it would be really delicious at the time. The cashier gave us a pager and I waited in line to pick up my to-go order. The pager buzzed and the lady gave me the food but it was incomplete, I was missing some fries. Once I finally got to walk out, after a couple seconds the bag handle rips. So i carried it to my car and i looked in there (note the fries are in a boat) the cheese for the fries is spilt everywhere in the bag. UGGHHHH! Took out the burger that was the size of my palm, my hands are tiny so the burger was small. I would rather have a McDonalds cheeseburger than the shack burger. I ate my fries with the little cheese sauce I had left. The fries are good but I recommend salt on them. The chocolate shake was pretty much the best thing out of all of the food i got. Not the hype I was hoping for, probably will never go back and most likely will not recommend to a friend! The space is tiny, things are unorganized, the food isn't really good, and its kinda expensive for the servings they give you."}
{"text":"This trendy burger joint off of Las Vegas Blvd and NewYork NewYork offers solid burgers with real ingredients, but be prepared to wait in long lines and spent some dough. Everything is a la carte, no combo deals. 

Décor: outdoor and indoor seating with some big tables to share with other diners.

Shack Stack: 9.59: signature cheeseburger and 'shroom burger all in one with crisp-fried portobello mushroom, melted cheese, lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce and onion ring. It looked big and thick, but it was not problem after a good workout.  The cheese oozed out that it dropped at times which made eating somewhat messy.

Black & White Shake: $5.29: vanilla shake with fudge. This popular shake was indeed very thick, but I didn't think it was extraordinaire. I'd try either root beer float or coffee fair shake next time.

Fountain drinks are unlimited refill, but there was no fountain machine, so you need to go up to the pick up counter to get replacement drinks. Water and condiments are self-served.

Parking: park in Monte Carlo parking structure, beware that they're installing ticket booth in the structure, so not sure if they will validate or charge parking fee in the future. 

Although you can taste the difference from In N Out or Island's, Shack Stack is not a burger I crave for like I would Bachi Burger."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing a chain, but it's a new and rare chain in these parts, so get off my back!

We're flooded--absolutely inundated with chain burger places, so Shake Shack, brought to us from NY, has some big shoes to fill. 

Here's what I like: The smokestack burger. Great, premium toppings. I enjoyed this thoroughly and it was over too soon. I also like the beverage selection. Abita root beer to wash it all down was amazing, but you can get a grown-up beer if you feel that way as well. True to its name, there are a variety of milkshakes, so there's quite a bit of options to enjoy on the side. 

Here's what I don't like: They seem kinda small, and the beef itself was just good, but nothing above average for the price range. I like my buns nice and toasty, these were plain and very soft--almost as though they were steamed. A small, single burger and a fancy soda is like $11. With fries, we're getting into the price range at which I may as well just go to a ;real' restaurant.

I don't think it's the best, but it's good enough and you should try it. It looks spiffy and the people are nice. A-OK with me!"}
{"text":"For how busy this place is, I guess I expected it to be a little better. 

The burgers are good, don't get me wrong. But they're not unlike anything I haven't already had. I thought they were similar to Sonic or In 'N Out, actually. 

We also got the cheese fries on the side. They were also pretty good, but probably would be easier to eat with actual forks and not the little wooden prongs they give you."}
{"text":"My wife had never had it before and I've been hyping up this place the past few months. I was a bit afraid that all the hype would've led to a let down, but she loved it so much that we ended up eating here 2 nights in a row....Yes, it's that good. I know the West Coast is all about In N Out, but I have to say, Shake Shack takes my vote for being the better burger of the two.

The only items I can vouch for at this place are the Shack Stack, Cheese Fries, and the Purple Cow float. The Purple Cow float is basically grape soda with vanilla ice cream. The Shack Stack is a beef patty topped with a breaded portobello mushroom filled with cheese."}
{"text":"Shake Stack all day! This place has one of the best burgers I've ever had. The Shake Stack is a beef patty AND a cheese filled portobello mushroom patty stacked on some of the softest and most delicious buns you'll ever have the pleasure to put your mouth on. The shakes are pretty good and the fries were average. You need the Shake Stack in your life, 

The burgers are comparable in quality to in n out, but double the price. Still not bad since in n out is dirt cheap."}
{"text":"Beat burger ever. In and out burger was my favorite but not anymore. The crinkle cut fries are fabulous i recommend adding a sprinkle of salt when your order arrives."}
{"text":"Yum it's soooo good! Just a little overpriced in my opinion. I love the chicken sandwich  I can't help it I always mean to try something new. The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried is very tasty.  Pricey but it won't stop me from going back,  just not as often as I'd like."}
{"text":"This place is probably overly hyped but I like it! It's not bad but not the most amazing burger I've ever had. It's easy to spot outside NYNY. Came here on a Friday night and it wasn't packed. Thank goodness! Lots of seating inside and outside. Lots of different things to try on the menu. We got a root beer float, black and white milkshake with burger and fries. Burger is kinda small and crinkle fries weren't bad. It's hard to rate this place after having Bachi's gourmet burgers. But it does feel comparable to in n out.

Overall it does its job and hits the spot. I wouldn't mind coming again while in Vegas. Especially since they're open till 2am. Good late night snack. So many different things to try on their menu!"}
{"text":"It's not worth it.. paid $16 for burger fries and a shake and everything is just so small. I'm still hungry. Go some place else"}
{"text":"Missed the opportunity to eat at Shake Shack when I went to New York, so I decided to redeem myself by eating at this location.

Upon first glance, this place is aesthetically pleasing. The interior is not like your average burger joint, and almost looks more like a lounge than a restaurant. 

I ended up ordering the SmokeShack burger with fries and Fifty/Fifty tea/lemonade. 

Pros: 

- Bacon + Cherry Peppers + ShackSauce = Yes

- Patty was deliciously smoky and flavorful

- Crinkle cut fries were probably the best crinkle cut fries I've had

- Free refills for the drinks

Cons:

- Burgers are very small

- Tea/lemonade flavor and sweetness is determined by who makes the tea as opposed to having a set recipe

- Fifty/Fifty tea was bitter w/little to no lemonade flavor I could discern

- Did I mention how small the burger was?

Although this was a pleasant experience, I do not see myself coming back anytime soon simply because it wasn't worth $14. People say quality over quantity, but Shake Shack's quantity is almost too small to overlook."}
{"text":"Welcome to the shack of shakes.  Inside, expect to find burgers, fries, and shakes, among other things.  I had the mushroom burger, cheese fries, and a vanilla shake.  Once you order, they give you a device that vibrates, symbolizing that your order is ready for pick up at the counter.  

The burger was good.  The bun was moist and fresh.  The mushroom was perfectly cooked and well seasoned.  The fries were a bit of a let down.  Crinkle cut fries are second on my list for the least desirably cut french fries.  My number one dislike is thick potato wedges.  I do not like crinkle cut fries because they tend to get soggy, and  rarely, have I had them crispy.  The cheese made things even worse.  There was also a weird taste to the cheese.  Imagine nacho cheese with a curd-like texture.  It was just strange.  

The shake was definitely the star of the meal.  This was one of the best shakes I have ever had.  It was thick and very enjoyable til the last drop.  

Overall, I would recommend this place just to try.  All it is really, is a glorified In N' Out."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect when I walked in, but my group of 27 was extremely happy and the food was great! We came home and even a month later, we are still talking about Shake Shack.

I had all ages. From 65 down to the age of 5.

Great meal and a great price!"}
{"text":"First time at a shake shack and I have to say I had a very good experience.  Staff was very friendly and helpful! Fries and a shake are a must try!"}
{"text":"The shakes are great, burgers are good, and people watching couldn't be better. Just remember you are paying for location."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this for the longest and my god was I impressed!! I still love my in n out thou, shake shake just takes sole possession of 2nd place in the burger game lol"}
{"text":"My second time eating here.  I still love it.

Came here around 8pm on a Monday.  The line wasn't out the door so it wasn't that bad.  The line actually moved pretty fast.  Only waited in line for 10 minutes.  Worth it.

- shack burger:  added bacon.  So good!  

- shack stack:  this was the one with the fried portobello mushroom in it.  I thought that the shroom over powered the burger but my friend really liked it.

- smoke shack: I really like this burger too, but I need lettuce and tomatoes on my burger so if you get this, add lettuce and tomatoes! Lol"}
{"text":"Love the simplicity of the menu.  The burgers are so good.  The sauce is delightful.  Cheese on fries always a good idea.  And they have cakebread wine, which is crazy....in a good way!

Shakes are good too. 
Not in the same league as McDonald's or bk. 
This blows all other burger joints away.  

This is the way a burger should taste.  Sometimes the line is quite long but it's because people understand the quality of these burgers.  

Worth the wait.  Every time."}
{"text":"I live in California and all I have to say is shake shack is way better then in and out burgers. The shack stack gives you a exotic taste with the mushroom and gooey buttery cheese sauce."}
{"text":"First time at Shake Shack and it lives up to the hype.   Wanted to see how the cheeseburger compared to In & Out, and it compares quite favorably.   The meat had a real meaty quality with a good flavor and very juicy.   Had a black and white malt shake that was much better than the shakes at In& Out.  I wish we had a Shake Shack in the bay area. 

Want to complement the manager on duty for being super professional and personable,  going above and beyond in the service department.   She gave us a taster of the shake since I asked about it.   (It's called a \"custard\")   She checked on us while we were eating to ask how we liked our food.   Really impressed with her and Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"The best burger ever? Hm might be debatable. It tops Dick's in Seattle. I like In n Out a bit better. The crinkly fries are the winner when you come here. These might be the best fries I had. Don't forget to get a shake at Shake Shack."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of all the hype, but after trying these burgers I am a fan! 

I had the shack burger, cheese fries, and a strawberry shake and they were all delicious. The burgers have a unique taste that you cannot get enough of. I strongly suggest getting a double! The cheese fries were very good, and the shake was excellent as well. 

The only reason I give it a 4 is because the prices are a bit ridiculous. I spent over $20 for a burger, fries, and a shake, and even though it was very good I could go have a nice sit down dinner somewhere else for that price."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Shake Shack, ever (we don't have them where I'm from) & my first time in Las Vegas, period. My husband & I had been looking forward to checking out what all the fuss was about, and so we stopped in for dinner, the night before St. Patty's day, since we hadn't planned on being on the strip at all the next day. (We're not really into Vegas, we were there on a business trip) Like all places on the strip, it is busy, a line out the door, but we were determined. We actually kind of felt like we were in the soup nazi's line from that episode of Seinfeld, we just wanted to go up one at a time, order correctly, and move forward.. I decided to try the chicken shack, as I don't eat burgers, and the cheese fries, with a literal bottle of wine Lol & my husband had the regular Burger, regular fries & a lemonade, well, we were not disappointed~ I enjoyed my chicken sandwich very much, but the real winner was the cheese fries, I would describe their cheese as macaroni and cheese cheese, on top notch crinkle fries, and they were absolutely delicious! My husband says his Burger was the best Burger he's ever had & even the plain crinkle fries he insists are the best fries. I had wanted to try the chicken dog when we went back later in the week, but they said they were all out, but no worries, I'll gladly gain 10 pounds for another shot at those cheese fries, so I just had the same thing all over again & loved it just as much. Overall, I loved Shake Shack, and while I doubt I'll ever find myself in Las Vegas again, if I come across another shake shack somewhere else in the wild, I'll be all over it! Yum yum yum!!"}
{"text":"Endroit génial, chouette ambiance et décoration.

Cependant, je dirais que comparé à son concurrent \"direct\" (In-N-Out), Shake Shack est un peu cher.

D'un autre coté, les frites sont incroyables bonnes (au-delà de leur aspect \"accordéon\" plus travaillé)."}
{"text":"THE HYPE IS MOST DEFINITELY NOT REAL.

Not the biggest fan of this burger joint. The portions are relatively small compared to other places. The food wasn't groundbreaking either. I'd definitely opt out for Steak n Shake. The portions are bigger, they have quality food and it's less expensive."}
{"text":"OK all, I do not enjoy being the lone  3 star rating in a sea of 5 star raters from truly burgerlicious yelping gurus.  I went to the NY NY Hotel today to try Shake Shack and overall, I am rating the food a solid 3 star!

First of the location ambiance and feel of the place is 5 star. I like the location right on the strip, plenty of views to see all, and outdoor seating when it get's too busy!

Location - 5 Star - As above

Ambiance - 5 Star - As above

Menu and Choices - 5 Star - Check out their menu online or on the wall. It is great.

Service - 5 Star - You have a rather large menu on the wall or laminated menus to review your plethora of choices that can be amazing.  

Food - 3 star - We opted for a simple hamburger with cheese, a Shack Burger SIngle which comes with lettuce, tomato and their special sauce. and a Shack Stack with is a cheese burger with a crisp fried portobello mushroom filled with melted cheese, lettuce, tomato and their special sauce!  I had a big bite of the Shack Burger and it was alright.  tasted nice, however it was NOT mouth watering to me. It did not perk up my senses to say, ahhh, I have arrived.  I was also surprised at the rather small size of the burger itself.  For me my main meal was the Shack Stack with both the meat and the mushroom.  When you bite into this, a gusher of warm melted cheese will ooze out and that was really great.  I found it really hard to taste the mushroom as it was fried and I thought for the longest time I had the wrong order as i could only see the mushroom and not the hamburger itself. It was there, just very thin and nearly non-existent.  I give this a three star overall for the fact that there was nothing remarkable about either burger.

The Fries - 2 Star - Much has been said about their crinkle fries, and their cheese fries. I would say that the fries were cooked just right, and at the same time, I must NOT be a fan of crinkle fries because I found myself missing the small, thin, crispy fries that many other places serve.  The cheese fries were highly recommended and it felt like someone had melted simple sliced cheese on the fries. I mean, the cheese to me had a processed taste to it. I did not get it, but you can betcha it was darn decent as I ate the entire THING!

The Bouncer - 5 star - They have a greeter at the front to give you a menu and to give you a quick idea of what to get. I thought the greeters were both amazing and very friendly!  Keep it up!

Frozen Custard, Dogs, Concretes- I cannot comment as we did not order this or any of the concretes.  I will give this a 5 star because you know that when it warms up a bit, I am gonna go for the works on these puppies!

Cold Brew - 2 star - orderd the $4.75 Cold Brew, steeped and cold pressed iced coffee brewed and bottled in Brooklyn.  They serve it in a 10.5 oz bottle. Tasted like simply cold coffee and it came in a plastic cup with a lid. Definitely not a bottle, and definitely I did not say - \"Wow, how do you make that!\"  Instead, I said \"Wow, glad I did not order that\".   OK, actually I did, however for my son. 

I will be going back, as I cannot ignore all the yelpers who rave about this place. I maybe just was expecting something different. However, for now, I just don't get it!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack never disappoints! I was so astatic to learn we were getting one. I had it years a go in New York and fell in love. Everything is delicious, the staff is super friendly and helpful. The staff always is super helpful if it's your first time in and we help you decide what would best fit you. Shack burger, fries, shake, or custard you can't can't go wrong. The line is definitely worth waiting in, we went opening weekend and it only took 45 mins from start to food. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"When I think of Shake Shack the word vegetarian is not something I automatically associate it with. But I am glad I was wrong! There is one dish in this restaurant that I absolutely love! The Shroom burger is a crispy fried portobello filled with gooey cheese. The sandwich comes with lettuce and tomato. Even if you are not a vegetarian I would suggest giving this sandwich a try...because it is really good! 

The service at this establishment was fast and friendly. The place is also very clean and accommodating. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"What even. This place blew me away and I don't even like hamburgers. But I love veggie burgers and Shake Shack managed to make a sinfully good (most definitely unhealthy) vegetarian option, which most fast food establishments desperately fail at - the Shroom burger. 

Upon ordering, the lady at the cashier asked me if I'd had it before, basically warning me that it was just a giant fried portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese (no burger patty). As if that wasn't enough?? I also got one of the concretes, which is essentially frozen custard with mix ins. I decided on the Shack Attack, which is chocolate custard, fudge, cookie dough, chocolate chunks, and chocolate sprinkles. I love chocolate so this was good but a tad bit too chocolate-y. 

The shroom burger is meaty with a crispy shell. Upon biting into it, cheese oozes out and it's heavenly. It didn't even need ketchup.

Luckily, I came at 5pm so there was no wait. They give you a buzzer after you order and I only waited maybe a minute or so before my food was ready. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"this one is located in the Summerlin shopping center, has outside sitting area, inside has TV hanging on every corners, try their smoke shack burger, bacon cheddar shack burger and bacon cheddar fries, all taste delicious, meat on the burger is not dry at all, bread is very soft, 
fries are fresh, good place for a fast food meal, price is on the high side, but the quality is good."}
{"text":"I saw a video on Shake Shack vs In-N-Out, and was super stoked that Shake Shack was coming to AZ. I rarely venture to the east coast, so this was the perfect opportunity for a taste of their burgers. Being from CA, I'm a huge fan of In-N-Out, and simply can't help comparing these two places. First off, the burgers at Shake Shack are double the prices at In-N-Out. A double-double at In-N-Out is $3.50. A double hamburger at Shake Shack is $6.59. 

I had the single Smoke Shack burger, which is a cheeseburger with bacon and chopped cherry peppers. Overall, this burger was overly greasy. The meat was tender and flavorful. I really enjoyed the cherry peppers which added a unique touch and complemented the burger well. However, the ShackSauce did not blow me away. The sauce ran on the ordinary side compared to In-N-Out's addicting spread. My boyfriend paid $9.64 for his Smoke Shack double, which was really worth $6-7 max. I was pumped up to try their crinkled cut fries. To my disappointment, the fries were equivalent to frozen fries anyone can purchase at the grocery store. Fries were poorly seasoned and lacked that fresh taste. I have to say that the best part of this meal was the shake. I had a delicious salted caramel shake, malted with whipped cream. The shake was creamy with a good consistency, not too sweet. The other flavors available were chocolate, black & white, strawberry, peanut butter, and coffee Fair Shake. 

The location is fairly new, so there was a line that was no more than a 10 minute wait. We ordered our food, and was given a buzzer. It was awesome that they have free wifi. There are four TV's distributed around the spacious dining area. Since we went on a weekend, it was quite busy. Some customers had to find seating in the outdoor patio when the indoor tables were full. I really liked the idea of having water and cups of water conveniently situated by the ketchup and mustard dispensaries. It would be nice to have access to some ice for the water. They also serve wine and beer. This is a very family-friendly place with a lot of children around.

I conclude that this place does not live up to the hype. Personally, I would rather go to In-N-Out for their tasty burgers and fresh fries - all for an affordable price."}
{"text":"I like their shack burger, the food is on par and the place is clean and the employees are helpful"}
{"text":"I got the smoke shack I think it's called with bacon it was very good. My wife got the chicken sandwich which tasted horrible. Kids got the hot dog that was not good neither of them finished. The cashier was absolutely rude. It was our first time and we had questions, he did not answer a single question and proceeded to make it seem like we were wasting his time. Very disappointed because we frequently visit downtown summerlin. We will look elsewhere when hungry."}
{"text":"Is it good? Yes 

Is it fresh? Yes 

Are the fries good? Hells yes!!! *only if you like crispy crinkle fries* those that like soggy thin fries, you will not like these 

Is it the best burger ever? No 

The burger is good. Don't get me wrong. Fresh bun, fresh meat, good ingredients. But..... For the price.... I could've eaten at a gourmet Burgr (As in Gordon Ramsey's place across the way). 

Shake Shack is a staple. It is a must visit when in NY so when at the NYNY in LV, it's also a must visit as well. 

Go check them out. Holiday GingerBread shake is amazing! 

Service? Fast, friendly. There was no wait when I went so the food came out fast. The ones in NY are always packed."}
{"text":"Inconsistent. First burger was great the other burgers were a bit too greasy to the point the buns were all soggy. Fries could be crispier. Expensive meal by the time you really see what you get."}
{"text":"We went here 2 times for lunch in 2 consecutive days.  You do have to pay up for the burger though and at least $10 dollars.  You get the fries too and with the extra cheese is $1 dollar.  We ended up also getting the shake as well.  The burgers were awesome and good, but rather have Inn-n-out to be honest for a cheaper price.  It does get crowded too, but the wait is not too bad. The atmosphere was okay as you get interesting seats, but felt like you are in New York though.  I would come back here for sure."}
{"text":"I really liked the hamburgers there and I could tell they were actually homemade. They had the \"shack sauce\" which I wasn't a huge fan of... It seemed to be too much garlic in the sauce.

The cheese fries at first taste weren't amazing but the Mir I ate the more it grew on me. And the milk shakes are really good especially with malt!"}
{"text":"If mortality has ever knocked on my door, it was definitely after eating at Shake Shack. Sadly, I will not be eating there again. I will however go into the positives of this cool new add to the New York New York in Las Vegas. 

This is a great location along the strip and is accessible through the casino and outside. The line inside wraps around, until you reach a friendly person at the cash wrap. The menu is pretty straight forward and there is a lot to choose from. I went for a cheese fry, Shack Burger, and Mango Lemonade. 

All good choices, I initially thought. The food came out fast, and I can appreciate that condiments are set aside for eaters to choose. There's free refills too, which I definitely think is way nice!

The mango lemonade, though sour with a touch of sweet, I feel is a nice attempt at a cool summer beverage; the bitter aftertaste I wasn't a great fan of. The burger was good. I wasn't raging over it, but hey, it was worth the try, I think. The cheese fries in retrospect I could do without, nothing special about it... Just... No... Cheese... Please.

Fast forward a couple hours, and meh, I couldn't. I couldn't stand by my nice thoughts about my first trip to Shake Shack. I got super sick afterwards. It's frustrating not knowing exactly what it was... Could have been the cheese, or maybe the meat was undercooked. Nothing tasted bad at first, but now, I can't even think about Shake Shack without thinking about how sick I've felt since eating there. :-("}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, service and food!! The manager is very nice and very tall and very friendly!!! He knows how to run a burger joint!! The only thing bad about the regular shack burger is that its not big enough!! I have not had a burger like this ever!!! It is so yummy and tasty that i wanted to punch someone!! Each employee was very very nice as well!! Keep it up guys!!! High five!!!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack is located outside New York, New York. Very appropriate. If you're coming from the parking lot, just head towards the Village Streets. Like all places in Vegas, there is a wait. Unlike Earl's, the line does not disappear as quickly. Good news is that it gives you enough time to think over the menu. There is a lot of outdoor and indoor seating.

Shroom Burger is my sandwich of choice. Oh man, the the taste of the ooey gooey cheese and mushroom juice when you bite into the patty - so great. But if you have a bigger appetite, you might need two or a bigger burger option.. or add a milkshake, fries, or a soft serve. The bill will stack up."}
{"text":"Shake Shack! I finally made it back, unfortunately it is not New York. Still good as ever. Tasty burger and shakes. We were at North outlet shopping mall in Vegas. Shake Shack is right across guest services near freeway side of mall. Service was fast and very pleasant. Again food top notch."}
{"text":"We ordered from Postmates and we ordered 3 shake stacks and an order of fries. This was my first time having it and it was very delicious. Was a little disappointed that our food didn't arrive hot, but I still enjoyed the food a lot. The shake stack burger was sooooo good."}
{"text":"Double Shack burger pretty good.
Chicken Shack burger really crispy and pretty good.
Shake pretty good.
Fries pretty good.
End of the story is two burgers, one order of fries, one small shake and one small soda was $28!"}
{"text":"Wifey always want to go shake shack in DC but never did.  Went to this new location on friday night.  The wait was minimal compares to ppl who went earlier of the day.

Ordered two burgers to go.  

We like the shack stack more than the smoke shack.  The smoke shack has spicy peppers (pickled), spicy and sour, i think the taste doesnt blend with burger.  Overall it is also more saltier than the shack stack.  However, we enjoy the shack stack, the breading on the portabella mushroom well stick together and didn't fall off after the first bite.

However, for 2 burgers only that cost close to $18 is quite expensive.

I wish they have the option for how the Patty is cook, we love medium raw."}
{"text":"Since hearing all the hype, we had to try this on our vacation to Vegas. Knowing these joints can be super busy we decided on this outlying location in an outdoor mall and coming at an off-peak time, 4:00 pm. 

Glad we did! Only 2 people in line before us. We ordered and received our food quickly. The person taking our order was not rude but not friendly either...just meh.

Tried the Shack Stack and the regular cheese burger. Both were tasty and cooked to perfection. I really liked the pickles! Not impressed with the special sauce or the french fries (plain or with cheese). I would come back again, but only for a special treat and only for the burgers, as this is absurdly expensive fast food.

Worth trying though!"}
{"text":"I enjoy comparing the various burger chains and tend to go back to my favorites with regularity.  That being said I am an In-n-Out fan and use that as my measuring stick when it comes to other burgers.  I have to give major props to Shake Shack for being right there with them.  I don't have one in Reno so when visiting Las Vegas I had to return to try it again and was not disappointed at all.  Their menu is extensive (unlike In-n-Out) but I stuck to getting the double cheeseburger which was delicious, juicy and filling.  Everyone in our group liked theirs, including one with the chicken sandwich. I'm not sure if all locations serve beer and wine, but this location did...probably a Vegas thing but certainly a nice benefit.  The line to get in is continuous so obviously they are doing something right.  I would recommend them if you have a hankering for some American grub!"}
{"text":"Sorry shack shack.. My heart belongs In n out. I do have to say the burger patty is pretty damn delicious but not something that will keep me from coming back. They do have crinkle cut fries here which are my fav. Custard was good when sampled but when we got a full cup it quickly became too eggy."}
{"text":"Delicious burger, all the way from the East Coast! 
This place is amazing. Cheesy amazingness. I was blown away by these guys. They offer a mouth watering burger at a very fair price. The toppings were all fresh, and the meat was incredibly juicy and just covered in cheese. It's like a East Coast version of the West Coast In-N-Out Burger. 
The fries were crinkle cut, and fresh. I'd never had fresh crinkle cut, it's always been frozen for me. Yummy. Had their Vanilla shake, which was creamy and delicious. I was amazed to see that they do offer the regular shake flavors, as well as one weird, monthly flavor. This month's flavor was blueberry custard. I wasn't feeling that adventurous at the time... 
There was hardly a wait to get served, and the food didn't take long at all to arrive. The place was clean and well lit. I enjoyed the fact that you could post a selfie from their photo booth and email it to all your jealous friends!  
This burger place is attached to the NY, NY Casino, since it is a Manhattan burger establishment and all."}
{"text":"Warning: you will leave Shake Shack in a food coma if you go all out with a burger, fries and shake. Burgers are comparable to In-N-Out, crinkly fries are really fantastic. I prefer them plain as the cheese makes them soggy, but to each his/her own! 

My favorite items are the concretes which are out of this world and understandably how this restaurant gained a cult following. Made from frozen custard, it is no wonder the shakes and concretes stand out from the main stream.

Shack Attack: Super chocolately goodness, almost chocolate overload. I would have this concrete again on its own (sans burger and fries).

Camel Shack: My favorite so far, salted caramel and banana cream pie in vanilla custard."}
{"text":"REEKED of sour vomit. Place was dirty. Burger had rotten tomatoes on it. Got food poisoning the next morning. Seriously.  Don't ruin your trip.  DO NOT EAT HERE!!"}
{"text":"Let's talk about how long these lines are. They are very long. The food is also very good though. I have to say the cheese fries were a little disappointing since the cheese basically was nacho cheese out of the can. BUT the chicken burger was very crispy and very moist at the same time. How do they do that?! I usually really like chick-fil-a crispy chicken sandwiches, but the chicken sandwich from here does not even compare. The buttermilk herb sauce was flavorful but not overwhelming, and everything tasted very fresh. I also got he lemonade expecting it to be fancy or something, but it just tasted like fountain lemonade and was not really worth it. I would come here again, and would just hope that the line is shorter !"}
{"text":"$15 for a burger, some fries and a shake. Really?!?!

The burger was damn good though, I'm not gonna lie. Damn good. 

That shake? My goodness. Full of peanut butter flavor. Yes Lord. 

The fries...eh.Probably the worst part of the meal.

As soon as I have another $15 to spend, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Having now eaten at the Vegas outpost of the famous Shake Shack, I have to wonder:  why?  Why do people wait hours for this in NYC?  Maybe it tastes different there, I don't know.  I hope it does.  But, if I waited 4 hours for the burger and fries I ate at this location, I would be furious at both the situation and myself for allowing it to happen.

First of all, Shake Shack is \"inside\" NYNY, and I put inside in quotations because there is no way to access it from the casino.  You have to walk outside to get in.  This is incredibly annoying, and I can't remember another restaurant with a set up like this.  I could certainly be wrong, they may exist, but I've not seen it on the Strip.

We ate at Shake Shack at around noon on Thursday of the Pacquiao/Mayweather fight weekend.  There wasn't much of a line, although after we ordered it took a long time to get our food.  Far too long given how many people were working back there.  So long that I don't know that I would call Shake Shack \"fast food.\"  I went with the double smokestack and cheese fries, but I was told they didn't have the cheese sauce.  So, second annoyance.  

When my food arrived, it was hot.  It had clearly been made fresh, which is good given how long it took.  The fries are crinkle cut, they were just the right amount of crispy and seasoned very well.  Most places just give you naked fries and leave the seasoning to you, so I've got to give it up to Shake Shack for seasoning properly.  The fries are good, but that's it.  Not earth shattering, not mind blowing, not revolutionary.  They're good.  I prefer thinner fries, so I like In N Out's better.  But, these were crispy and tasty.

The burger was a bit of a mess, it was difficult to eat without it falling apart.  The veggies were fresh; I particularly liked the pickles.  The meat is cooked all the way through but retained some juiciness.  It had a couple of crispy edges, which are my favorite.  But, not too many.  I would like it the patties were a little thinner.  The sauce was good, it's mayo based with a bit of a tang to it.  Tasted a little like dijon mustard to me, but only a little.  It's not like other fast food special sauces, which is a good thing.  My bacon needed to be cooked longer, it had virtually no crisp to it.  Again, I prefer In N Out.

The place is clean and employees are constantly asking if you need help, so that was appreciated.  Overall, glad I ate here.  Maybe it's me, maybe I am just missing something.  But, I don't see this as being worth a multi-hour wait, and for $13.50, it wasn't cheap either.  I'd eat at this location again, but only if I was near there and didn't have other plans.  I won't seek it out."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had! Idk why people argue about Shake Shack vs. In-n-Out. There's no competition here. 

The Las Vegas location is quite busy, but the long line goes by quickly. Wait time for food was about 15 minutes. 

I got the 'Shroom Burger - a hot crispy mushroom filled with gooey cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and sauce all nestled in two delicious buns. Ughh I'm drooling as I write about this. I also got a strawberry shake which was good but nothing too special. They have a special for the shakes which periodically changes, so check out what the special is on the menu wall if you wanna try something different! They also have a few beers on tap which is nice. 

I'm surprised I liked this place so much since I'm not usually a big fan of burgers. But I gotta say this one definitely makes me want to come back for more!"}
{"text":"OMG! In-n-out is in so much trouble if these guys get a drive-thru location. Tried them for the first time today. Absolutely amazing! Very definitely adding these guys to our regular burger haunts!!"}
{"text":"So 1st star deducted because Customer Service here is Bad. I dont mean like super Horrible But its just Bad. Asked a question and i swear the people who work here are clueless! When i asked what type of drinks they had the girl helping us was like \" whats that? \" seriously? 2nd star deducted because of the prices. 31$ for 2 burgers 2 fries and 2 Small drinks. What the heck! 3rd Star deducted because the staff here preferred to be watching a game instead of helping me out when i simply needed a refill . And 4th and foremost THEY ARE WASTING CUPS!! When i asked for the refill she told me that shes going to give me another cup. I had mine right there! Thats a waste seriously. This place is just frustrating. Rather go to The Stand where the food is great and good prices and the people are awesome! Not coming back"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick and inexpensive burger and fries! It is inexpensive and a short walk from the MGM. The burger are fresh and fries are not overly greasy."}
{"text":"I honestly don't see what the big deal is. It was good but it wasn't like, \"HOLY SHIT, THIS WAS THE BEST FUCKING HAMBURGER I HAVE EVER HAD!!!! ...It wasn't bad but it wasn't worth the 30 min wait. The fries I can get in the frozen section at HT, the hot dog was dry, the smoke shack burger was pretty good, the Chick'n Shack was ok..they forgot the lettuce and tomato and was bland. Good luck trying to get a refill or anything from the guy at the counter..Would I go back..yes, maybe if there's no line..but I just don't understand the drink-the-kool-aid type cult that this place has. Brooks in NoDa is WAY better. If you want a real hamburger and real cheese fries (With Chili)..go there"}
{"text":"The burger it self is delicious and the shakes are delicious too. So why 3 stars? Well the burger ($6) I got the one with cheese and carmelized onions with bacon pieces and cheese fries ?($4)? And shake ($5) and I was still hungry after the meal. The fries were so small. the burger was even smaller like the size of a fist and I could barely taste the toppings also the \"bacon\" was invisible. The shake was about half the size of a normal cup. Not worth it. Maybe the real one in NY is better."}
{"text":"Never, never, never ever again! This is one big shame! Hamburger is an one bite size, shake is exactly the same as Chick-fil-A with that difference that you get half of the size cup for the same price at shake shack. We came in with 3 people, everyone was very disappointed, ALL THE FOOD WAS TASTELESS , I couldn't taste that I got a mushroom burger..
We don't like Mac Donald but we think it's way better there!
Overall it was a waste of money,  they are WAY OVERPRICED!
Next time we go to HopDoddy, Chick-fil-A or ...we can choose from lot, a lot better food and way cheaper but the most important reason is way more quality and food for your money."}
{"text":"Shake shack I love you

Ok so to be honest I haven't tried an actual hamburger yet because I fell in love with the chicken sandwich 
I used to think chick fil a had the best chicken sandwich but Shake Shack is my favorite. 

I love the crinkle cut French fries they are my favorite type of fry if I had to chose any. 

My food always comes out and cooked to perfection. My experience with the customer service has been great as well!"}
{"text":"OMG, I was surprised when I saw a Shake Shack here! I thought it was only located in the East Coast! I was just so happy that I was able to eat Shake Shack burger once again since I thought that I would not be able to eat it until I go to the East Coast! I got the Shack Burger, bacon cheese fries, and a salted caramel milkshake. Like In n Out, this place never fails to disappoint me!!! It is sorta relevant since it is right next to the New York New York hotel!"}
{"text":"We were walking around Kierland and the Shake Shack was right in the middle. I always wanted to try this place so lunch time it's SS. 

We walk in and it's nice and clean. Very bright with booths and long tables with bar stools. So we got in line and ordered. 

I got the double smoke shack burger with fries and a coffee shake. I thought the burger was really good. A little salty and the chopped cherry peppers really added a small kick to this burger. Thought the burger was nice and juicy. Bun was nice and soft. So a very good burger. The fries were pretty good too. Enjoyed those too and the shake. Got the coffee shake without whip cream. It had a nice coffee flavor. Not overwhelming at all but I thought the shake was very good. 

My son got the shack burger, fries, and a salted Carmel shake. He really liked it and thought the burger was really good. Not bad for a semi fast food place. 

Once you order, they give you a pager when you food is ready. I like that so much better than people yelling your name out and having to wait by the counter. We could just relax at our table and get up to pick up our food. 

Very surprised that the manager was walking around and making sure everyone's meal is okay. Very nice touch for a fast food place. Also noticed that they had people who would wipe the table very quickly after people left.  Nice touch too. I like a clean restaurant and clean tables. 

So I thought the food was really good. The people at the counter were nice and friendly plus the manger walking around making sure we were good. This makes then service really good. They have indoor and outdoor tables. Very bright and inviting environment. So I  will be back again if I can find parking at The Kierland (if you know what I mean). Enjoy"}
{"text":"This goes down as the Shake Shack with best outdoor seating and service! He chicken Shack was phenomenal, perfectly crispy, just the right amount of buttermilk ranch. For about 3 seconds I contemplating ordering a second one...yes it was that good. The crinkle fries were crispy, not soggy, served warm. The peanut butter toffee crunch was any peanut butter lover a dream. 

And as if that weren't enough, it's nestled amongst a beautiful outdoor mall making it a prime location."}
{"text":"We were thrilled to find a Shake Shack in Scottsdale and although we had already had dinner, decided to stop in for dessert. We shared a marshmallow and malt concrete as well as a banana cream pie concrete. If you're a banana cream pie fan you'll be sure to love this cold treat. This location ha the added bonus of indoor-outdoor seating like everywhere else in Scottsdale and makes for some great people watching."}
{"text":"While in Las Vegas we love trying multiple restaurants and places that are new. We had been in Shake Shack before, but it had been a while so we decided to use the app to order our food to skip the line. Best idea ever, the line for Shake Shack is always long and seating is limited. 

So we had to wait about four to five minutes after walking there from our hotel and our food was ready. I had the ShackBurger( cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, and shack sauce) and my boyfriend had the Hot Chick'n Sandwich, I do not like spicy but he enjoyed it very much and they are never disappointing. 

Inside the front doors they have a giant menu board so while your waiting in line you can browse through the choices available. They also have a small outdoor patio however in the summer time I do not recommend, it will be way to hot."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I got the cheese burger with bacon, it was a 3. I got the fries with cheese and bacon, they were a 1. The fries were pathetic. The concrete CamelShack was a 5, it was delicious. Overall this place was mediocre."}
{"text":"Crispy chicken sandwich was good, but small for the price.  Hamburger was very tasty!"}
{"text":"Lets just get this out of the way: Yes, it taste better than In N Out, but at cost. In N Out is still my favorite overall choice based. 

The fact that we dont even have shake shack in the bay makes it really hard to compare a burger that cost 3x more money. 

I was in Vegas EDC weekend and decided to check out. The first thing that caught my eye was the prices. It is a lot more expensive for fast casual dining. at $10 per burger alone its pretty steep. I got the mushroom burger. The burger was a little bit bigger than In n out. Inside the mushroom was stuff cheese which i didn't know. It was awesome. I wish more places would cook the bun from the inside so its nice and crunchy and will hold its composure more. 

There are a lot of better tasting burgers than In N out, but it still can't beat its value. SS was awesome but $16 meal is pretty steep. I will def make my way back her when i come back to vegas tho."}
{"text":"Just like the one in NYC...just slower. They have shuffle puck and foos ball. Messed up my order but are fixing it right now.

Chicken was burnt."}
{"text":"It was my first time & the employees were comparing the place to in n out so Yes, the meat is better than in n out but it's also more pricier than in n out. Other than that the employees are great & helpful. the atmosphere was very calm and chill, i like the set up inside! will come back again!"}
{"text":"Its your standard burger shake place that is a little noisy
Not impressed, but kids liked it."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is all hype.  

I had heard a lot about Shake Shack but was truly disappointed when I finally went there.

Yes! they are located in cool locations in town.  
Yes! their stores are modern and sleek. 
No! the food is not good.  
No! they are way over priced.

Their burgers a tiny tiny.  I'm a skinny Asian guy and thought that I needed at least 2 burgers for it to be considered a meal.  They use a heavy potato bun and a pretty boring piece of patty. Their burgers are also fairly expensive - it was $17 for 2 basic single burgers and one shake.  At that price, I can go to In-N-Out and get four burgers that are spectacular.  I can now say I've done Shake Shack, but there's no reason for me to go back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and they have a very good burger. The burger is well-salted and well balanced. My first experience was with the smoke shack that had mushroom in it. I thought it was good, but wasn't impressive on me. When I went back and had the normal shack burger double, that was when it was the best for me. Having that burger, with the cheese, was definitely as good as it gets. The bun is also awesome as well. It is the spongiest bun in terms of texture that I have ever had. It meshed well with the rest of the burger. The fries are pretty good as well. I'm also not really a fan of fries too, but I have to say, they are pretty good. I also tried the peanut butter shake which was really good also. It wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be, but is good to share."}
{"text":"Best burger in town hands down.
Also, these crinkle fries have never been replicated. Seriously the outside is crispy and the inside has FLAVOR. It's not just dull potatoe. I don't know how they did that. We will be back.
The chocolate shake is on par with a Culver's concrete mixer. Classic but not extraordinary.
The space plan for their location is lacking."}
{"text":"Please.......Don't Believe the Hype!!! Steak and Shake at South Point will crush this place. I lived in NYC for 18 years and I can find 10 delis with better burgers!!!! My ratings: 1. STEAK AND SHAKE, 2. In and Out, 3. FAT Burger, 4. SHAKE SHACK! They do make a dope Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate that's off the chain!!!!"}
{"text":"They have gluten free buns and potato buns. Vegetarian options chicken beef. So tasty."}
{"text":"Shake stack: think of a double cheese burger, but instead of 2 patties, it's one patty and one mushroom, and 2 different cheese (just refer to the menu for specific ingredients). The price for any double-patty is about $9-10. My boyfriend said a single is pretty small and won't fill me up, so I got the shake stack.
I honestly don't think the beef patty was all that special in terms of taste. Yeah, the quality of beef may be fresh, but meh. 
-The mushroom was good! Nice little crunch from the breading, and it goes well with the cheese that's melted inside the mushroom. I would probably suggest getting the mushroom on its own, instead of a shake stack. The mushroom patty sort of loses its shine when eaten with the beef. 
-Most memorable part of the burger was the sauce. It's just right, not too heavy like innout's thousand island spread. Maybe cause it's more of an aioli. 
-Lastly, I love the buns on these, because they're so soft. It's a personal preference. I'm not sure what it is, but it reminds me of potato buns/bread. 
Shake: I got the shake of the week: mudpie. 2/5 stars. I don't like chocolate all that much, but I LOVE mudpie ice cream. Sadly, it tasted nothing like it. It was very sweet, and completely lacked coffee flavor. This (expensive) shake tasted like a milk-chocolate milkshake-reminded me a lot of Nestle milk chocolate, but in a thick milkshake form! Was it bad? No, it's just not what a mudpie is suppose to taste like. 

Overall Thoughts: 
-If youre in Vegas and want a good burger, I suggest spending an extra 5 bucks (14-15$) at Gordan Ramey's \"BURGR\" in Planet Hollywood. Yes, it's a little more expensive, but it's also bigger. But more importantly, you definitely taste the difference in flavor and quality of the patty!!
-Many people compare this to innout and I don't think you can really compare the two. But if I had to choose with pricing excluded, strictly cheeseburger to cheeseburger, I'd pick innout. The seasoning on innout's patty is just so darn good and more complex. I feel like a shake shack burger can be emulated with some quality ground beef and some fresh cracked salt and pepper for the natural beef taste. It's good, but not exciting."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Good food. Way over priced though. Fast food for double the price. 
I thought it was strange there were no plates for the burgers, the hot dog had a paper tray. Size of burgers reminded me of Wendy's junior bacon cheese burger. Thin patty, thick bacon slices and filled with lots of fillers like lettuce tomatoes pickles and what not. I could possibly visit again but definitely not somewhere I would go out of my way for but then again I'd probably choose the dairy queen across the street."}
{"text":"Hamburgers are amazing..worth the wait, generous soda refill policy..they give a new cup each time."}
{"text":"Holy cow this place was good! I got the Shake Stack and it was incredible with the breaded stuffed cheesy portobello and beefy patty. Literally drooling right now as I'm recalling each bite. To wash down the burger and my fries was their cookies and cream shake. Yes I was treating myself to the fullest! It was pretty busy when we visited as there was conventions in town, and of course being on the strip. But the line moved so quickly and they had a lobby person controlling the floor. The menu has so many options, including a doggie menu. I will definitely save another lunch break to visit there again!"}
{"text":"The mushroom burger is soo good. The fries taste like orida frozen French fries but theyre good and crispy. The cashier was a little diva and sort of rude, but I understand considering how many people where there and how hot it was. Really recommend the portobello mushroom burger! Or get the shack stack that's also good."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this so badly since my cousins were always talking about it. When I got here, the line went all the way outside. I was very hyped and excited, but unfortunately, it took us about 1 1/2 hour for waiting in line. There were only 2 cash registers and they were super slow. After that, we still had to get the pager/buzzer thing to wait for our food. It took probably about another 15 mins. Finally, we got our food and I just got the regular Shackburger, Black and White milkshake, and french fries. Their prices are high and to be honest, I don't get the hype of this restaurant. It tastes like a plain regular burger that you could get at any other restaurant. In n Out is still way better than Shake Shack. Also, In n Out is so much cheaper! Shake Shack's burgers were very small and their buns are flat. The milkshake was pretty good though and the french fries were not too crunchy, more like hard. Although the food is okay, the service was meh. It took extremely long to get our food."}
{"text":"I gave Shake Shack several chances, but it never lived up to the hype. The burger is tiny and expensive, it tasted pretty good but I was still hungry afterwards. I'm honestly shocked when people prefer Shake Shack over In N Out. I've also tried both the peanut butter and vanilla shakes before, and both times have been overly sweet. I probably won't come back here unless my friends want to."}
{"text":"Amazing Chicago Dog (ShackDog)

Came with all the usual sides like relish, onions, pickle, celery salt but what made this dog next level was the perfecrly grilled dog and house bun.

A bit pricey at $4.50 but well worth it since every bite of this hot dog was heavenly. A bit amazed to say this but I like their hot dogs now better then their burgers or shakes.

Def try the dogs!"}
{"text":"It was good! I believe I got the single smoke shack I recall while my BF got the double. Then I had their root beer float that not so good because the ice cream was thick and it was mediocre. Other than that it was a nice first hand experience and I'm glad I was finally able to try it out. My BF said the way they make it out here in Vegas is similar back home in NY."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers with tasty gluten free buns. They have the perfect cheese to beef ratio that makes the burger perfectly tasty the entire meal. I love the shakes too. The burgers are perfectly seasoned and not too salty. I got the double bacon cheeseburger which is just a sexy beast of a sandwich.  The bacon is super flavorful and in fact I liked it better eating it off my sandwich as it seemed to be a bit too flavorful for the sandwich. The double burger is like two meals. It's a perfect sloppy goodness. If you are fussy about not getting food on your hands use a knife and fork. This baby is just jam packed full of flavor and sauce.

This is a high end burger joint with no gmo's and natural fresh ingredients. Think gourmet burgers for a hip burger bar experience. Everything is super fresh and it comes through clearly. You get what you pay for! This place is on par with other gourmet burger joints in town. It's definitely one of my new faves! If you don't like something just let them know, they will make it perfect for you. They are super into making sure you have a great experience! Great food, great service, totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Omg I've been dying to try Shake Shack after all the hype about it. I agree with others when they say it's not comparable to in n out though. I really liked shake shack as there were more options and the flavors were really good, but as a SoCal resident, I also love in n out. 

When I arrived around 2 pm during Labor Day weekend, I saw a long line and I thought that the wait would be forever! Luckily, it moved very fast and we got some seats inside. After you order, you get a buzzer that will let you know when to pick up your food. 

Food: 
ShackBurger - I actually had this the next day as leftovers but it was still pretty good. I'm just mad that one bite and the tomato or lettuce is gone. It doesn't tear apart very well hahah so I just had to take it in one or two bites. 

SmokeShack - I had like two bites of this because it was my bf's but it was so good! Ahh I wanted more...

ShroomBurger - I got this and it was delicious! Even though it was a deep fried panko covered mushroom with cheese and had no meat, I wanted this because it was unique. I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed it. I just wish the cheese was more melted and didn't get cold quickly. 

Black n white shake - so this is a vanilla shake with chocolate fudge apparently. It was good. Can't tell if it was special but I liked it. 

Overall: really tasty but expensive for the size! I'm not sure if I can justify the price for how small the burger is. I felt like it disappeared so quickly :( I want mooooore. Much better than bobby's burger palace (love watching him on food network but not eating his burger).

{"text":"Really good burgers which must be compared to In N Out and Five Guys to give the right perspective.  I grew up in CA and instinctively am biased against Shake Shack in favor of In N Out so this review hurts a little.


Quality of Meat: Shake Shack - In N Out - Five Guys (from best to worst)
Shake Shack the easy winner here.  Juicy on the inside and cooked at high enough heat to get some charring on the outside.  A really solid patty you wouldn't have an issue with if you paid $15 at a steak house for(besides expecting a bigger patty).  Five Guys, to me, has the worst meat.  It's bland and cooked at lower heat so there's nothing happening on the outside.  In N Out has some charring but the patty is too thin and not juicy enough.

Quality of Bun: Shake Shack - In N Out - Five Guys
The Shake Shack bun is awesome. Soft and pliable.  It lets you bite down into your burger without all the toppings flying everywhere.  That's a problem Five Guys in particular has and to a lesser extent In N Out.  In N Out does toast the buns....I couldn't tell if Shake Shack did but definitely didn't taste the toast like you do at In N Out.  Still.....have to go with the Shake Shack bun.  If they sold that bun in any supermarket it's what I would buy to take to a bbq for burgers.

Quality of Toppings: Shake Shack - In N Out - Five Guys
In N Out has the best tomatoes, lettuce, and onions.  However, Shake Shack has bacon, superior grilled onions, and other toppings like peppers which give you much more variety.  Five Guys has the most options and they're free...but I've always found their toppings to be bland, poorly cooked, and just not good.  

Fries: Shake Shack - Five Guys - In N Out
Well seasoned crinkle cut fried over at Shake Shack.  NOT a good value by any means as you get an average portion at around $4.  That's insane pricing.  In N Out has pretty brutal fries IMO.  Five Guys gets silver on volume alone.  But fries are too big which means you have to put a ton of salt and/or ketchup.

Cost: Shake Shack - Five Guys - In N Out (meaning Shake Shack is the most expensive option)
Shake Shack is flat out expensive.  For a double cheeseburger they charge around $10 vs. $3.50 for In N Out and somewhere in between for Five Guys.  I don't know why anyone would eat at Five Guys with the prices they charge.  Five Guys does have an awesome soda machine at Downtown Summerlin.  If you're price sensitive, Shake Shack is gonna trigger you.

TLDR; Shake Shack has really good burgers and fries.  But it's very expensive for what is essentially a fast food experience."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  Next to In In Out, this place SUCKS!!!!  decent burger, decent fries, and the shake is below average,  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!"}
{"text":"My cousin raves about Shake Shack in NYC so of course I had to stop in when I saw it was opening here. Immediately I can tell it's definitely better than Five Guys. All the food we had was very good. The chicken might be better than the burger, with the house-made sauce and the breading! The fries were very crispy but still soft inside, it's like fryer magic!

Still, I prefer Culver's to Shake Shack. For one thing, both restaurants have thin patties with crispy edges due to the Maillard reaction, but Culver's are juicier. Then, Culver's has a larger variety of custard flavors (vanilla-to-vanilla comparison, they are comparable but SS is better). And, for the $8 pricetag at Shake Shack for a double cheeseburger, you get a full double cheeseburger COMBO at Culver's!

Still, no complaints whatsoever about the food, so 4*."}
{"text":"Didn't want a burger so we got hotdogs instead. The cheese and bacon fries were good. The hotdogs were average. Not bad but nothing special. Portion size is kind of small and it's pricey. I get it's Vegas but I'd rather just get average food from someplace cheaper."}
{"text":"Made it a point to make it over to Shake Shack on my most recent trip to Vegas for CES.  Wasn't that crowded at ~10pm

Ordered the single stack, cheese fries, soda and a custard cup.  First off, don't compare it to In n Out.  They are both great in their own right.  I would compare Shake Shack to Super Duper Burger in San Francisco.  The patty was very good. Seared nice and juicy.  The highlight was the bun.  I believe it is a potato bun.  It is awesome  and just a moist bun, nothing I had before.  The burger is pretty small and I was thinking I should have gotten the double patty but I think I had my fill of calories.  That is why it reminds me of Super Duper Burgers.

The cheese fries were great.  As good as Nathan's cheese fries.  The custard was great.  Almost as good as Luv-it Custard.  The odd thing is that sodas are single serving and not the soda fountain.  

All in all, I thought it was a great burger joint, and I wish they'd open on in San Diego as we really don't have many good burger places except for In n Out and Islands"}
{"text":"Great selection. I tried a chocolate malt shake, cheese fries and a burger. The bread is awesome and the meat is really flavorful. People say it is better than to in and out which I kind of get but, it's a better quality burger for twice the price of in and out! It's great but to compare it to fast food I don't feel like they are the same level. Both in and out and shake shack are great just depends on what kind of burger you want"}
{"text":"This is a decent spot for a quick lunch if you're on the strip. The best part of my meal, the burger, tasted so fresh and authentic. The fries were decent, but forgettable. My shake tasted like it came from a self-serve ice cream machine. Stay away from the shakes. Prices were ok for the location. Around $15 for double burger, fries, and shake."}
{"text":"Will I compare this place to In and Out? Nope.  Why? I think they are very different, and while I like them both, there isn't a Shake Shack in SD, so there's no point.  

Our first time here last year, the line was out the door.  It moved fairly quickly, but the wait for the food was a different story.  Not that it took too long, but that there wasn't a single place to sit while we waited.  We pretty much stalked a few people and jumped on their table as they left.  We each got a Shackburger (cheeseburger) and shared an order of fries with some cheese sauce.  The kiddo got a shake, and I really appreciated that it wasn't a huge, monstrous serving.  It was just enough shake, since it was super duper sweet.  The burgers themselves were super tasty.  I loved the simplicity.  But it was way too small.  I could've easily had another one.  The meat was flavorful, the cheese melted to perfection, the bun, and little soft.  Done in just a few bites.  

Fast forward to the next trip here, and the line was again out the door, but not nearly as long.  The line moved super quick again.  This time, I had the SmokeShack which was a bacon cheeseburger topped with cherry peppers.  Man, this was it! The single was plenty.  Those cherry peppers added just the right amount of heat, and the bacon...yup, perfection.  We also had the chicken sandwich, and that too was delicious.  It's all about the pickle on this sammie.  As usual, we got it with the cheddar fries and were not disappointed.  Plenty of seating this time around.  

If you're staying at NYNY, having this place so close would be deadly.  We've eaten at the Times Square location as well, and this location serves the exact same food.  Good to know it's consistent,  no matter what location you go to."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night after hearing the raves and knowing the popularity of this place. My boyfriend and I walked in and saw the massive menu and instantly got excited. Since we were hungry we decided to try a burger and the chicken shack after the gentlemen raved about how awesome and \"filling\" their burgers were. My boyfriend isn't a small guy and we both lift. The guy ringing us up could see how huge my boyfriend was but continued to convince we didn't need large fries with our burgers because we would be full. After we ordered and they called us when our food was ready, I watched my boyfriends face in serious disappointment when he was walking towards me with the food. I looked at the size of the burgers and thought this was a joke. The fries were basic crinkled fries you could buy frozen at the grocery store and while the burgers were good they were so tiny. My boyfriend took three bites and was done. His cheese fries were weak!... Same basic fries with some American cheese barely on them. We paid $26 bucks and still hungry. We paid $16 at smash burger and love every bit of it....for a better price. Sorry but I'll leave this place be. Don't come here if you're really hungry......"}
{"text":"I don't know how they make their burgers or what they put in them but it tasted like one food, not a bunch of ingredients. I've eaten here twice. The first time i ate here it took a really long time to get my food for some reason. But the manager apologized and gave me vouchers for free food. The burger was just as good the second time. I also had the chicken sandwich which was excellent. Better prepared and crispier than Chick-fil-a's but with a similar taste."}
{"text":"I happened to stumble upon the infamous Shake Shack while on a family vacation to Arizona and so when I saw this I was so excited to finally get the chance to try it out without having to go to the east coast!  

Being from California I've only known of In and Out (and other burger joints smash burger....burger lounge etc) and I've read several comparisons between Shake Shack vs Five Guys vs In and Out.  Upon reading the menu there were several items to choose from.  All their ingredients are all natural no hormones no antibiotics etc etc the new trend in \"natural\" foods.  They use a potato bread which is very soft and in addition to the burgers they have chicken options as week as a shackago-dog.  Shake shack has several shakes to choose from in addition to the standard chocolate, vanilla and strawberry flavors and they sell several custard dessert concoctions to satisfy anyone's sweet tooth craving!  Shake shack also serves a variety of adult beverage options.  I loved shake shack's fries probably because I love crinkle cut fries even though some may say it's similar to eating them straight from a bag of frozen crinkle cut potatoes from the grocery store.  I feel like I'm betraying In and Out by saying that since they have the fresh cut in house fries!  To each their own!  Everyone has their own opinion right?  Shake shack's cheese fries are good but it just tastes like cheese whiz to me nothing fancy but I enjoyed this also!  The meat patty was so juicy and definitely a lot bigger than the other fast food joints.   However, it wasn't as flavorful as other burgers I've had at other fast food joints.  Nonetheless I still did enjoy the burger.  A little pricey in my opinion for the burger, fries and a drink (~$10+) but I guess it is what i would expect or a place that sells fresh high quality ingredients.  I love love loved their strawberry mint lemonade which was their featured flavor of the month.  I hope they open one in San Diego soon because I would definitely want to have it again!"}
{"text":"Warning: Watch them prepare the food if you order something topped with bacon or don't order anything topped with bacon. I saw the lady at the counter take the buzzer thing from a customer, and with the same gloved hands, grabbed bacon bits and drizzled them on top of someone's fries. Those buzzers get passed on from one person to another, and some may even bring it to the bathroom or whatnot.

Would I come back? yes. especially if I'm staying at Monte Carlo or NYNY hahah I like their burger, fries, and milkshake."}
{"text":"Good greasy burger.  I had the Smokestack, bacon with the special sauce. 
Crinkle fries are always good.  

A bit pricey for a small burger and fries but better than average.  

Good beer selection.  

Now that i've had shake shack, I can say that, although shake shack is good, In n out is still better and cheaper."}
{"text":"After finally trying out Shake Shack in SoCal, I fell in love. When I learned there was one in Vegas, I had to get my fix! 

It was super busy but the line moved quickly. I ordered the Shack burger and my boyfriend ordered the fried chicken burger(?) -- the one with the BBQ sauce in it lol. And we also got two orders of fries. Everything was delicious, though I wish the fries were a bit crispier. 

Customer service was great. An employee rushed over to bus a table for us so we could sit down. And despite it being overwhelmingly busy, all of the employees were still friendly. 

I love love love Shake Shack! I wish there was one in Sacramento! :("}
{"text":"Never been here before but then again i don't remember the last time I came to Fashion Square mall where it's located. (Right near H&M) we ordered smoke shake hamburger and a chicken sandwich and some fries to share.. everything here is a la carte, it does get busy pretty fast and full.. but the line fast and food came out fast too.. defin will be coming back in the future."}
{"text":"One of my go to places to eat in Vegas when I'm not looking to have a decent burger on the strip. Not my most favorite burger place to eat at, but not the worst.

They have a lot of stuff on their menu that is consistently high quality compared to most quick burger joints. I still prefer In-n-Out for their price point, but again I'm not a Shake Shack hater and they can definitely compete with most gourmet burger restaurants."}
{"text":"(Update)

Two words: Cheese Fries

I'm not the biggest fan of Crinkle Cut fries, however, Shake Shack has a killer cheese sauce. The cheese actually tastes of cheddar, instead of the American Slices or Velveeta stuff. Shake Shack isn't fast food, so don't expect fast food quality here. Yum!"}
{"text":"THE GOOD: Location and overall menu

THE BAD: Shake Shack is straight up greasy burgers, frozen fries, long all served with extra weak sauce. I was so wanting to like this place, but for the extra wait time and cost, the food is just so pathetically average. 

THE BOTTOM LINE: Do yourself a favor and stick to In N Out. The hype on this place is off the hook, I just wish the actual food was also."}
{"text":"4 burgers, 3 shakes, one beer, $62. Are you kidding me???? Never again. We've tried it once and can't afford to go back."}
{"text":"With all the ravings here, I had to try this place. I decided to try the Shack Stack which was a regular cheese burger with portobello mushroom. The deep fried portobello mushroom with cheese was probably the highlight of the burger. So so good! I also ordered a side of fries which was nothing special and a chocolate shake. The chocolate shake was so creamy and chocolatey! Yum! The entire meal cost about $20 which is pretty pricy, but what can you expect on the strip."}
{"text":"Yeah it was super hyped up but it held up. Very juicy and delicious burgers. For their opening day their execution was on point so a pat on the back to the staff. Burgers came out hot and well made, I had the double Shack cheese burger add onions and pickles. Had the bacon cheese fries which were good as well."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Shake Shack before and have always heard it's the East Coast version of In N Out, so I was in the area and thought I'd give it a try-especially because of all the high ratings on yelp. Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out how the ratings are so high and positive. I ordered the Smoke Shack single burger, cheese fries, and the Shack Attack concrete. The burger was ok, but the cherry pepper gave it an extremely strange flavor and the entire burger was pink inside. The cheese fries were the biggest disappointment. I waited probably all of one minute to eat them and by then the cheese was already congealed and turned to nasty chunks. I wouldn't have even ate them but I spent $17 for the whole meal and hated to waste it. The concrete is an absolute rip off. I was expecting it to be like Culver's where it's actually in a shake cup but instead it was like a sad melted single scoop of custard with 5 little pieces of brownie and a few giant chunks of dark chocolate that's so bitter it almost doesn't taste like chocolate. Overall, this is by far one of the worst, waste-of-money meals I have ever consumed. Maybe it's better on the East Coast, but I'll never be back here."}
{"text":"Great burgers, beers, and shakes but its a little pricey and plan an being in there for at least an hour between the line to order and wait for the food. As long as you nkow what you are getting into just enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've always heard the hype about this NY staple, but honestly was never that intrigued to try it.

But since it was in Vegas and so was I the opportunity was seized. Really like the design both inside & outside. It's themed and branded throughout. I also was very impressed with the various vendors that were featured inside on the video screens. It shows a commitment to high quality and local vendors.

Now for the burgers. Let's use context. As the East Coast competitor to In & Out I'd say it tastes better. But before all you West Coast people start hating, here's why: the ingredients are better, but it's also more expensive so In & Out is a much better deal. I think you can get a 4x4 and In & Out for the same price as a Double Shack. But also the different kinds of custards and the cheese fries look amazing. So based on value In & Out blows this place away, but sheerly on taste Shack Burger wins. Not only are the patties bigger and have better quality meat, but the buns are softer and compliment the burger better. 

Next time I want to get the cheese fries and try a shake. I wouldn't put this place in a gourmet burger category yet, but after tasting it I actually don't think it's a competitor of In & Out. 

If you love burgers like I do it's worth a try."}
{"text":"First time trying shake shack and I must say I was impressed. I think that 5 guys, In n out and Shake Shack are all basically the same, although as you can tell by the reviews some people disagree. I like the fries at shake shack and the concrete and milkshake dessert options."}
{"text":"Awwwwwww man....the size!!!  I had to order two of double cheese burgers to get filled....sorry NY you got nuthin on California In N Out.  The taste was good but...sorry still In N Out kick your Ass...the bun was the stand out...the fries...ok...still won't compare...lol
The shake...ok different and kewl...but I usually don't get shakes from In N Out...sorry but in the burger race...
In N Out is king Smash Burger the queen and you guys ....a  knight in dull armor...sorry honest
The price almost $50.00 for the 3 people.....OUCH!!!!!!
Probably never again...sorry"}
{"text":"This location fell short, it doesn't even compare to New York. We ordered the shack burger with the mushroom that is supposed to explode with cheese. Our cheese was contained and just tasted blah. What a let down. We looked at each other with surprise because the burgers were so lifeless. The concept here is a great one...nice location, nice decor, convenient condiments but the burger was overcooked."}
{"text":"It's ok... A bit pricey.  Skip the cranberry lemonade!  It's just concentrate and tastes like it.  Not a better burger than 5 guys or In & Out.  But the beef is all natural w/out hormones. Fries are just ok too... Not bad... Not great. Whah whah"}
{"text":"Made a mistake and thought the shroom burger was a mushroom burger like a burger topped with mushrooms. But it was a stuffed fried portobello mushroom.  It was delicious."}
{"text":"As always the food is fresh and delicious! I got the chicken sausage dog 'Chicago style' and it was absolutely wonderful. The shack attack concrete is a must for dessert."}
{"text":"I lived in New York for a brief period in 2007, and as soon as I tried Shake Shack, I was hooked. I'm so glad they've finally made it it west!

Is Shake Shack pricier than typical fast food? Yes, but it's also not typical fast food, both in terms of food quality and the aesthetic atmosphere of the restaurant itself. How many fast food places outfit their restaurants with great patio space and tables made from reclaimed bowling alley wood from Brooklyn?

I've noticed a lot of reviews comparing Shake Shack to In-N-Out, Five Guys, Habit, even McDonald's. Are those places cheaper? Definitely. But I'd also venture to say the quality of Shake Shacks beef is far better. I'm not sure what seasoning Shake Shack uses, but the beef is far more flavorful to me than any competitor. When it comes to bun quality, Shake Shack wins that one hands down. The butter toasted Martin's potato roll is way better than buns used anywhere else. And if beef isn't your thing, the Chick'n Shack is amazing! I'm definitely more of a beef fan than chicken, but I've gotten the chicken my last two visits here. Super flavorful, crispy, and juicy- everything that most chicken sandwiches lack.

I know the French fry battle is always a hot topic, bu I also prefer the Shake Shack Yukon crinkle cut fries to any other burger place (save maybe the truffle fries at Zinburger).

One of the best part of Shake Shack is the beverage selection. Anywhere I can get a good glass of wine or a good beer is an automatic plus for me. I like that they feature local drafts on tap too. If you prefer your liquid indulgence in the sweet variety, the shakes and concretes here are also great. I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but I ended up drinking more than my share of the black & white shake my husband ordered. They've also got two concretes special to Phoenix. I've only had the Camelshack (salted caramel and banana cream pie), but it was really good.

What really pushes this location to five-stars for me is the service. Every worker I've encountered has been super friendly. They've even come buy to offer water or to clear the table- not something you see in most fast casual places.

If you're looking for the most food for the least amount of money, this is not your place. However, if you'd rather have a quality burger, in a nice atmosphere, and maybe enjoy a beer or wine with your meal, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"There's something wrong with you if you don't like this place.   

I do agree that the burgers are on the small side but the quality is there.   

Get the cheese fries and thank me later.  

Get a milkshake too.   I got the black and white milkshake.  YUM! 

Very quick to get the food and a nice large dining room to enjoy it in!"}
{"text":"Fast food at its best!!  I had heard this compared to in n out a lot. People said this was like the east coast version with the limited menu and fresh ingredients.  I grew up in southern California so in n out is one of my favorites... and really hard to beat in my book. But... i hate to say it... Shake Shack succeded.  This place is great.  We tried the the regular fries, cheese fries,  the smoke shack burger and the shack stack.  Every thing was delicious!   The cheese stuffed mushroom on the shake stack burger was amazing!   I will for sure be back!  Now they just need to open a location off the strip for us locals!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack makes great burgers. Our group tried all of the options available and everyone was happy. Our vegetarian friend said the shroom burger was the best burger he's ever had. Typical fast food place, long line that moves quickly, ample seating. It's not as cheap (and probably why most people compare it to in-n-out) but the taste is definitely there. Check it out when you're on the strip, it's the only one on the west coast for now anyway."}
{"text":"The burgers are good. The concretes are delicious. The service is friendly and the prices are not bad for Vegas."}
{"text":"Don't understand the hype around shake shack, it's overpriced burgers for decent quality. Nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Really good food! It's on the strip so it's going to be busy.. (Go to a Shake Shack off the strip that isn't so busy & they won't have to rush your food out)"}
{"text":"Typing this review is making me want to come back to LV. 

I ordered the coffee shake, fries and portobello burger. It did not disappoint! The portobello surprised me when I bit down and melted cheese came out. Can't wait to come back and even though the line might've been long, the food still came out fairly fast."}
{"text":"I love shake shack! I get the chicken sandwich (AMAZING) and have tried the burger with bacon and two extra patties... All really good! I was expecting it to be expensive so I wasn't upset! I thought the atmosphere was very fun and unique and I enjoyed the customer service!"}
{"text":"Great greasy post Vegas night gut bomb that gets the job done. First time experience and the service was fast, food was fresh and the place was clean. Can't ask for much more than that. Strawberry shake does help it all settle nicely as well..."}
{"text":"We wanted to see what all of the buzz was about. The food was great. There is a long wait. A really long wait. You will get pumped faked when your buzzer goes off. It doesn't mean your food is ready. It means...well I'm not sure how to calculate what it means or when it will be ready. It means it's coming close to being ready. I did have some enjoyable conversation with others who also thought their order was ready. I think the volume of customers and the demand on the kitchen makes it difficult for them to keep up. I will admit that the food was worth the wait.

I had the double smoke burger. It was very tasty. I also had the shackstack concrete. I enjoyed it thoroughly. My wife had the single cheeseburger and a  vanilla milkshake. She received a chocolate milk shake and she didn't like the taste of it. When she finally got her vanilla milk shake, she loved it. 

I recommend everyone to try it. I will come back and try the chicken."}
{"text":"Visited Thursday night and luckily there was a very short wait and our large order came out quick.  Service was friendly and the burgers and shakes were great.  The reason for the three star review came as I was eating and decided I needed to get some water to wash down the shakes.  As I grabbed the cups to fill at the water dispenser I noticed every cup came with sediment that really made me think twice about everything I was eating.  The water made me feel like the ice and everything else was not sanitary.  Hopefully the management will take steps to filter the water they are serving the patrons.  Left a bad taste in an otherwise good experience."}
{"text":"Great addition to the District in Henderson...if you haven't tried their burgers yet, now is the time!"}
{"text":"I tried this place cus I heard of all the hype. I had the shack stack (cheeseburger with fried portebella mushroom) and fried chicken sandwich. Food is pretty good but nothing about it gave me the wow factor. Service is good. At least I can say that I've tried this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the shroom burger, it was a hella small porta bella mushroom that was fried and well to be honest it wasn't the greatest. The burgers are expensive and small. The fries and cheese on the other hand were very good. Shakes are good too. The tables are cool, the location is nice, and the staff was attentive. The food came fast, we had a party of 13."}
{"text":"The food doesn't look like a lot, but boy, is it filling! I purchased a shack burger, fries, and a black and white shake! The burger was delicious, the fries were indescribable, and the shake was the cherry on top. I gave them 4 stars because the food was great and the price was decent, however the shake was pricey. Almost $6 for a small shake is insane to me when it is similar to an in n out shake I can get for less than $3. It was also hard to find a place to sit, but that may be because of its prime location on the strip and the tendency to be cheaper than most restaurants on the Vegas strip. Overall- good food, reasonable price."}
{"text":"If you're going to have a burger from a fast food type of joint this one is by far my favorite. The meat is juicy and fresh and you can taste the quality. The chicken sandwich is my favorite I've ever tried and the milkshakes are bomb! We tried the peanut butter and it was super Ono! (Yummy). Service was pretty quick despite being busy and I like that they have wipes available to wipe my own table down and a high chair for my son who is still young so keeping germs away is pretty important to me. Shake shack is yummy! Bring one to Henderson please."}
{"text":"Solid four stars. Great and creative hamburgers that are fresh. Good fries. They are fast and go through the line quick. One of the better fast foodish places for hamburgers"}
{"text":"I guess my review is for the disappointment I had going here. Yes I'm a so-cal girl so I had to compare it to In-n out.  We got the shake burger?, stack burger?, the other burger with the bacon (don't know the official name), three shakes, cheese fries, and regular fries. First off, for all of that? It cost $50, way too much for mediocre food. The hamburgers were very small, probably smaller if you made it at home. The hamburgers were just, ok. Nothing special to it. No, OMG ingredient, this is amazing. Fries were ok, they made our order to go so I had to dip my cheese :( shakes were good but I don't think you can mess up a shake. I probably will never come back here. I'll save my $50 and place it on black."}
{"text":"Cheeseburger was great with their tangy mayo \"special sauce\".  Crispy crinkle cut fries with amazing hot cheese sauce (mix of American and cheddar, non-spicy). I got the cheese sauce on the side so the fries didn't get soggy and I could dip to my heart's content! YUM"}
{"text":"I went back here to give this place another try after I got a response from the owner apologizing about my messed up order.  I ordered the chicken shack and a white mocha shake.  The chicken shack was good and was also good however I felt the shake was better in my opinion.  Overall a decent restaurant I would go back to."}
{"text":"Stopped by the Shake Shack as we were heading out of Vegas. We came about 12 minutes after the place opened and it got pretty busy right after we ordered our food. I ordered the SmokeShack and it was very good! The chopped cherry pepper gave the burger such a nice kick to it. I also had a bite of the Shack-cago Dog and I've never had a hot dog that tasted... refreshing? I don't know. It was interesting haha"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see Shake Shack in Vegas on my last trip here! I've been to the one in New York and loooved it, like, was in love with that burger! This place is not like the real NY Shake Shack. It was an ok burger but not nearly as good as the one in New York. Sorry.... but don't waste your money and calories here. Go to NY for the real thing!"}
{"text":"It is worth the wait in line to get Shake Shack! I tried Shake Shack the first day I was in Vegas and ended up going back 3 more times. The price for a burger and fries is great compared to everything else in Vegas! 

I ordered a cheeseburger and fries. I can't even explain how good the burgers are! They are unlike any burger that I have had before. It a combination between the soft bun and juicy beef!  The fries were always crisp and delicious. Overall the food was always hot and fresh. 

They are also very aware and helpful with allergies. Someone with me had a peanut allergy and the cashier made sure to let the cooks know to keep our food away from any allergens. For a fast food restaurant, that is very impressive! I can't wait to go back to Vegas for Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"Affordable and delicious. The fries are amazing. The shack burger and shack chicken sandwich were both delicious. It is like the school lunch you got as a kid while in elementary school except really great quality. Great seating. Very kid friendly. Lots of patio seating with misters. Definitely going back and definitely recommend especially if you have kids. After your done cross the street go to sambalatte for a coffee."}
{"text":"Went here because they said this joint supposed to be the arc enemy of in n out from the east coast. Order the smoke bacon burger plus the frozen custard with caramel. its not even close to beating in n out burger. Patty is small, overall is rather blah! Good location, pretty fast service if there is no line, but its just meh for me. Dont judge me cos I ate some pretty expensive burger compare to this one. So yah, try it for yourself, but its a one and done for me."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about this place and decided to give it a try...it originated in New York and I think they should have stayed there...the West Coast loves In-N-Out for a reason...cheese fries were gross...hamburger was just ok...the hot dog was actually pretty good though...we also tried the smores shake which was just average...staff was very friendly and the place was really clean but I will not be a returning customer because of the food...go to In-N-Out instead."}
{"text":"Shake shack is a place to try if you are in the summerlin area! The food is very consistent and the staff is always friendly! Today my family and I went in for mothers day and the general manager Mike was amazing! He went above and beyond to make our experience the best one yet! The smoke shack burger is delicious with a little kick of spice from the peppers and their shack sauce is so yummy! The strawberry mint lemonade is also a winner in my book! They have tvs all over the restaurant which makes it more enjoyable with children.

Once again Mike was one of the best managers I have ever met and engaged in conversation with us! Mike made us feel as if we were home with family enjoying a delicious meal! Thank you Mike! I had a wonderful mothers day thanks to shake shack and their staff!"}
{"text":"It's your go to fast food if beer is a requirement, & they have cool burger & dessert options. The regular burger itself is probably not as good as In n out, but I gotta give it up to a place that has beer & wine, plush 100% all natural angus beef burgers and options for vegetarians. I had a shroom burge which is a crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce. Hey, it's Sin City so enjoy your vices :) I'm glad they opened in the west coast, and I've been meaning to try beer floats for a while! Checked."}
{"text":"Oh, man. I've been waiting to try this place (yes, I know. I'm so late! Don't judge me, lol) and am so glad I finally did! This location is such in a prime spot on the strip, right on the corner, connected to New York New York. I ordered the Shackburger, pretty standard as I typically like to get the original of a restaurant's speciality for the first meal at that restaurant. I got the fries (which were crinkle!) and I HAD to get a shake...I mean it's SHAKE Shack. I had to! I chose the Mud Pie Shake, which was a seasonal flavor. 

My first thought of my burger when I looked at it was 'wow, it's so mini'. To be honest, I expected it to be more sizable, especially for the price you pay. But I suppose it was the perfect size for me since I was able to pretty much finish that, all my fries, and also drink my shake. 

The burger: The bread was so memorable. Perfect amount of sponginess and bounce. Not dry and airy. It was nice and dense. And moist. The bread is the first thing I think of when I think of the burger. The meat was fresh and tasted like an actual burger (well, duh lmao) but the meat tasted real. My burger came with lettuce, tomato, and Shacksauce, though I was a little sad to see that there were no onions. The hamburger comes with onions, though! But for some reason the other burgers do not. I'm assuming it's because all the other burgers come other ingredients like mushrooms, Shacksauce while the hamburger does not.

The fries: I am always so excited to see crinkle fries on the menu. But I can never find good crinkle fries. Maybe I just don't go to the right places, but the crinkle fries I usually have aren't very good- they're dry and too soft and often get soggy by the end of my meal. But the ones from Shakeshack were the complete opposite. Nice and crispy, firm, did not go soggy. Fave crinkle fries so far.

The milkshake: it was nice and thick, but not so thick to the point where my eyes would be bulging out because I could not suck it up the straw. It was  creamy and sweet and perfect with my meal.

Honestly, I've been craving another Shackburger ever since I left Vegas and am quite sad I'll have to wait until I visit SoCal or Vegas again. Until next time, Shake Shack :)"}
{"text":"Had a burger here for the first time last weekend and it was great.  Ordered the double cheeseburger without sauce - tasted fresh, loved the potato bun, and seasoned well.  Will cost a few bucks more than In N Out or Five Guys, but better than both in my opinion.  Thy also have alcohol options which is a plus."}
{"text":"Ate at a shake shack in Washington DC and it was amazing. Ate at the one in Las Vegas (outside New York New York) and... it was amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad there's a Shake Shack in Vegas. I have been wanting to try this place for a long time. A burger and fries makes the perfect hungover food. The lines do get pretty long during lunch time. They have outdoor seating with mist shooting above your head. Mmmh mmmh good. Craving satisfied :) honestly I feel like you can't go wrong with whatever you decide to do order, I got the Shack burger with and a side of fries with cheese. The cheese on my fries didn't harden up at all. It was gooey even till the very end."}
{"text":"Had been hearing tons of stories of friends that keep going to NY for biz trips keep posting and raving about how awesome the burgers were.  Was out in Vegas for CNY and right after we checked into the hotel, we headed straight to New York New York hotel.  

Walked up and saw a short line forming and was afraid we'd have to wait for a while but surprisingly, we were able to order our food within 5 minutes.  Not bad since I've heard people waiting hours at the location in NY.

Quickly browsed the menu and saw that they had a new addition to the menu which was called the shack meister http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shake-shack-las-vegas-2?select=A3AtT1ZyKFgnYMkVIOcWgA#Fu4YiaFfkDwMOilF7kayjw.  Opted to try it out since it sounded pretty tasty.  Next we ordered the shack stack, shack-cago dog, fries and a coffee fair shake w/ malt added http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shake-shack-las-vegas-2?select=A3AtT1ZyKFgnYMkVIOcWgA#TvJZf0wIulUraPZNeWK4iQ.  

Wasn't overly impressed with the shack-cago dog nor was I impressed with the shack meister but damn was the shack stack unique!  As most have already commented, what makes this burger so damn tasty is the cheese stuffed portobello fried mushroom.  Fries were just so so but they were nicely golden fried.  I loved the coffee fair shake though it could've been a little thicker.

Would definitely come back and am still keeping my fingers crossed that they open up a location in LA."}
{"text":"My first trip to NYC was magical. It was foodie heaven. One of my most favorite meals was at Shake Shack in Madison Square Park. Now it's here in Vegas and off the strip! How awesome is that?!

Mushroom lovers, the shack stack is a must try! It is a breaded portobello mushroom with warm melted cheese in a cheeseburger. Warning: it's a lot of cheese, but in a good way of you really like cheese. Negatives: the priciest of all the burgers. Some people can't justify paying that much, but for me it was well worth it to relive that original Shake Shack experience. Plus it saves me a plane ticket. 

Vegetarians, the 'shroom burger is a great choice also. Basically, the same as mentioned above minus the beef patty. Love this option on my non-meat days. 

Do you like a little heat and a little sweet? Bacon? I think I have your attention now. I highly recommend the the SmokeShack, which has chopped cherry peppers and applewood smoked bacon. It's so tasty! Definitely, a man's burger. My husband gets this every time! Also, available as a double (patty). 

Truthfully, you might be disappointed with the ShackBurger. It was not bad at all, just not memorable. I would rather spend a little more for the ShackStack or the SmokeShack. 

The crinkle cut fries here are okay, but I recommend the cheese fries over plain fries. The cheese adds some extra oomph in the flavor department. 

What I love about Shake Shack is the quality ingredients. Although, burgers are on the small side it doesn't bother me. I'm full after one burger and sharing fries.  Pricy overall, but it's a nice splurge. Honestly, Shake Shack is not really comparable to other burger joints out there. 

With desserts and cold treats nearby, I usually skip the shakes and concretes. I've sampled some before and they were delicious and extremely smooth. Look out for limited edition flavors that rotate weekly / seasonal!

{"text":"Fries awesome ! Shakes yummy! Burgers nasty! My burger was not cooked! If you like your burgers pink go for it otherwise there are plenty of other burger places."}
{"text":"Crinkle cut fries are so good! Love how they're crispy but not greasy. The bun on the burger is a bit buttery but overall really good. Just had this last week in NY and it's just as good here in Vegas"}
{"text":"This Shake Shack is located on the Vegas strip at the New York New York Hotel. The reviews were great for this place so I decided to check it out. We went to eat there, as soon as got off the plane, and checked into the hotel. We were staying at the NYNY, so we didn't have to travel far.

I got the single ShackBurger and the Double Jackpot Concrete. Their burgers are 100% all-natural Angus beef, with no hormones, and no antibiotics. What sets this burger apart from the rest, like most burgers, is the sauce. The ShackSauce is like a tangy Thousand Island dressing. It tasted really good on the burger. My favorite item from this meal was the Jackpot Concrete. It's a frozen vanilla custard blended with strawberry puree, marshmallow sauce, and rainbow sprinkles. What I loved about it is the crispy funnel cake pieces that I tasted in there. 

My hubby doesn't eat red meat, so the only entree he could get was the Chicken Dog. He said it wasn't bad, but wished they had more options that he could choose from. They only offer Crinkle Cut fries, which was fine. I'd prefer shoestring.

I really like how they arranged the seating area. There are TV's throughout the restaurant. They also have their humongous TV screen that's great for catching games. Outside seating is available, if you want to eat right on the strip."}
{"text":"mmmmmmmmmmmmm! i just got a single patty cheeseburger and shared the cheese fries with my boo!! this place is not too shabby at all!! my boo liked it and he is super picky!! my friend told us to give it a try she is a foodie so i trusted her!! and this place didn't disappoint us!!"}
{"text":"\"The In-n-Out of the East Coast\" my friends shared with me. I passed the opportunity to try out this joint when in Indiana, so I figured, why pass it up again?

I play it safe when trying new places--this time a ShakeShack burger, regular fries and a shake. I asked the cashier which flavor shake she liked most and enthusiastically made conversation and recommended something I not only didn't notice, but totally loved: a Cookies and Cream shake. 

Three televisions all on different channels, perfect for kids, parents and adults of all ages. The staff was so friendly and eager to help from the moment we walked in. 

The burger was soft and not too greasy, and the shake though a little small packed one hell of a punch. 

All that's left is to bring a couple stores to Cali ;)"}
{"text":"So glad we can go get our Shake Shack fix without having to fly clear across the country and we can hop on a plane and fly an hour to get to it. It's just simply magnificent! I love burgers and I just love shake shacks' burgers. I even love their fries. Not sure what they are called but they are delish, especially with them covered in cheese! 
Oh man...just thinking about it I want to go get one right now....yummmmmm"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Update review here.  Tried the new burger - the bacon cheddar burger.  I contend that this burger is superior to the regular Shackburger.

So there's no veggies on this thing.  Just a meat patty, bacon, and a cheddar cheese sauce, not slices.  This is straight up tavern burger, not a typical burger, but all the elements come together better than the regular burger here.  The beef patty, and maybe it was just this time, was less salty.  The saltiness of the bacon (which was also thicker and crisp) seasoned the burger and the slight sweetness of the bun balanced all that out.  The cheese spread, though only lightly tasting of cheddar, made for a good median between all the components, and they put a lot of it into the burger.

So more than the original Shackburger, I would put the cheddar bacon burger almost on par with their chicken burger.  It is a good, quality burger that comes together better than the original.

Cheese fries and vanilla shake were no different than visits past."}
{"text":"WOW! 
I was excited to finally try this, but even I was blown away at the taste and quality of their food.
The burger meat is high quality, cooked to perfection, and with just the right spices. Love the fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and the not-from-a-jar pickles. Also love the sauce.
Thier fries are also very good. I think these may be the best restaurant fries I've ever had. 
But the best thing I had during my Las Vegas Trip was the Mushroom Burger. Stuffed with melted cheese, I've never had anything like that. A must-try for everyone.
The Chicken Sandwich is also very good. Perfectly cooked. Nice and Juicy.
Shakes were good, but nothing special.
Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"Thank you Buzzfeed!  Oh sorry, bad very bad, fake news.  A secret menu promised the most beautiful slice of chocolate cake.  Lies, all lies.  

Sorry, too much Colbert lately.

No chocolate cake but the secret menu has two true stand outs; a burger and a hard beverage.  The first, released for one day, then pulled over concerns of peanut cross contamination, the second, who knows.  Both remains unpublished and unlisted but even on the Vegas Strip, they know what you want when you order them.
 
Peanut Butter Bacon Burger - The solid, salt and pepper seasoned single hamburger, meaty applewood smoked bacon and a side of peanut butter sauce.  Just pour the sauce over the patty and let the residual heat do the rest, making a oozing, slimy coating as the melting peanut sauce mixes with the beef fat.  Sounds horrible but wow, it works.

Shandy - Half and half mix of their Shack made lemonade and ShackMeister Ale.  Weird combo that somehow washes everything down without being off tasting..  Hair of the dog or just needing to cool down from the rising Vegas heat.  Oddly refreshing with its sour citrusy notes, sweet punch from the sugar, and bitter notes of the beer.

The two go together like peas and carrots, \"run Jeffery run!\"  Oops too much SNL.

Fast food and a Strip experience.  Strip proper fast food service.  Inflated Strip prices.  Good in a pinch when playing tourist but not destination worthy."}
{"text":"I work for post mates and this is one of the worst locations to come too.  There is no parking anywhere near here."}
{"text":"My first experience was in Los Angeles. My first time in the Vegas location. Big restaurant with overall clean seats and decor. Quick service was nice.

I grew up as die hard in n out fan but lately I've been having second thoughts on the whole in n out vs shake shack ordeal. I think I liked the shake shack meat flavor better . I got the single and the fried chicken sandwich with order of regular fries. Fries were alright but the sandwiches were on point. Highly recommend the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Hotdog was really dry and greasy. Concrete thing was literally half full, even mentioned it, and it wasn't fixed. Are the fries those microwaveable ones we all grew up on? This place was not worth the money in the slightest and I wish I could get my 22$ back. Free water, only perk."}
{"text":"Could it be that the hype added to the disappointment? I've heard many comparisons between Shake Shack and other burger chains and I was finally able to try it. A quick scan through Yelp found that a lot of people ordered the shack stack burger ($9.95) which is a burger with a shroom burger (like a fried mushroom with melted cheese).

I thought it was pretty good; the gooey-ness of the cheese was really good in the burger and the mushroom had a nice unique taste. The fries were... meh. I've never been a fan of crinkle cut fries and they weren't the crispiest either.

Overall it was kind of just an expensive burger that's not that big. At first try I would prefer In N Out but there is a Shake Shack opening close to me soon so I might have to give it another couple tries before I really say I like one over the other."}
{"text":"Ah there is nothing better to eat at 11:30 in the morning after a workout than a burger, fries & a shake! Oh Shake Shack, I saw your sparkly lights as I was heading down the strip & knew that I had to visit you sometime before I left. Luckily it was on my last full day in Vegas.

Shake Shack is located outside of the New York New York hotel on the strip. There is lots of indoor  seating with many TVs around to watch some TV while you grind your burgers. If the weather is cooler, which it wasn't when we went, you can sit outside where there is lots of shade & cute seats. 

I was overwhelmed with the menu since it was my first time! I got the regular hamburger with their signature sauce, a chocolate PB shake & I shared fries with my friend. My first bite was heaven, it was like biting into something so delicious that you are torn between eating it all or savoring it forever. Shakes were off the hook! You can do a combination of their flavors. & lets not forget crinkle cut fries which were both crispy on the outside & fluffy on the inside. The couple I was with ordered 3 sandwiches & loved all of them. People from Hawaii go all out when it comes to food because we want to try everything. 

The staff at this location were so patient & sweet especially when I was still deciding what I wanted. When we were done they even offered to take out trays! 

This is a must when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I don't get this place at all. 

This is like any other fast food burger from a decent resto (in and out, tom boys, jonnyrockts etc).  If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, i'm pretty sure it's a duck.  Gourmet just isn't served in a 10cent paper fry holder and paper wrapper.  The patty is thin, and the burger is tiny.   

If you wanted a REAL restaurant gourmet burger, I suggest yardhouse or fusion burger, where the burgers have restaurant style sized patties served with shoestring fries, ON a plate WITH waiter service.  And maybe order a side of french onion soup too. 

I can't taste the difference if the potatoes are actually from yukon (where is that anyways) and if you walked the cows home from the farm and you fed it organic strawberries it's whole life.  It tastes like burgers and fries, just like Dasani tastes like water.

Now as a point of reference, the one star is just for it claiming to be gourmet burger.  If it had claimed to be a normal burger joint, i'd rate it as a normal burger joint."}
{"text":"Love coming here whenever we're in Vegas! It's a must have. $21 for a burger, chicken sandwich, cheese fries, AND an ice cream cement. (Ps I'm convinced it's better than in n out)"}
{"text":"I've always heard about this famous spot- but have never been in the flesh! I was pleasantly surprised by the decor and the ambiance in here. We arrived for an early lunch around 11am and I was shocked how quickly the restaurant filled up! I got the classic for my first time around- cheeseburger w everything, small fry, and a chocolate shake (had to). The burger was good! It's a pretty flat patty, so if you like a meaty burger I'd go double. Fries were DELISH and the shake was very yummy and easy to drink, not too thick. This meal was $14, so this isn't comparable to a Wendy's meal. The service, cleanliness, and food worth the money I'd say. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out has nothing to worry about. 
Shake Shack is an East Coast favorite that's now doing business in Vegas.  I've been to ones in Philly and NYC and liked them a lot.  

My experience at this location was less than average. Our menu choices were not available because the ingredients were all sold out - sold out of hot dogs and got the chicken dog.  It was just ok for $6.50.  A basic Nathan's dawg could have beat it easy. 

Also there was no root beer, no cheese sauce, no water cups, no bacon, no mushrooms - this just neutralizes the greatness of what this burger could be.  It's disappointing because I hyped it up to my family and set the expectation higher than this location could deliver.  They basically thought it was an overpriced In-N-Out. Given that it's opening week for this new operation I can't fault Shake Shack too much.  I will come back in a few months and I'm sure they will sort things out for the better.  

Milkshakes were on point and had that rich flavor and quality ice cream taste. You can rely on great shakes when you visit.  In fact, if you just came in for shakes and fries I think you would be Fatisfied!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack you better feel special to always be compared to in n out!!! Not sure if I would say shake shack is better than in n out yet but it's definite comparable. The fact that they have alcohol is always a plus for me.. I see big things for this chain.. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Parking- NYNY 1-2hrs $9 2-4hrs $12
it's located at right side by street. 

Smokeshak is my favorite! Comes with bacon. Also their cheese fries with  bacon is good. 
Chocolate shake is good and very rich. Not too sweet so it's good."}
{"text":"Helpful Hint: When there is a long line that forms and the eatery is not open yet, that says more then words can describe. 

I have wanted a Shack burger since I went to NYC, but did not have enough time.

On our last day of our Vegas trip, we stopped by here for lunch. I ordered a Shack Burger with no cheese and my cohort ordered the Smoked Shack.

As people that grew up with In-N-Out, I have to say that Shake Shack is slightly better. We also ordered the Shac-ago Dog and some fries. 

I like that Shake Shack doesn't put too much sauce, but just the right amount. The bun was fluffy and I think a potato bread. It had the nice amount of lettuce and tomato (In-N-Out sometimes put too much lettuce). The patty was a nice portion around 1/3 lb and the fries (crinkle) and was the perfect end to the trip. 

However, I still love Super Duper in SF the most, for my burgers."}
{"text":"i'm sure there will be an ongoing comparison between in n out and shake shack. it's unnecessary. both are great in their own ways. my friends and i went to vegas just to try shake shack. that's right, we drove 4+hrs for a burger. was it worth it? combined with the experience and spontaneity with friends, sure! 

we made it here shortly before closing ~1:45am on a saturday and there was no line. we ordered one of each burger, the shackmeister hot dog, regular fries, and cheese fries to share. they have their own unique names but basically you have the (burger) options of: a hamburger, cheeseburger, cheeseburger w/cherry peppers + bacon, the shroom burger, and the shroom + cheeseburger combined. burgers have special sauce and all the other stuff you'd expect in a burger (lettuce, tomatoes..). 

the verdict? the meat burgers were solid and delicious, but not uhhhhhmazing. couldn't even taste the special sauce, and pretty small. the surprising favorite of mine is THE SHROOM BURGER. it's this amazingly deep fried pocket filled with a portabello mushroom and oozing Muenster cheese. it's so delicately fried, but packed with lots of flavor, and the mushroom is nice and tender. hands down my favorite burger there. 

the shackmeister dog was nothing extraordinary. tasted like any other hot dog, but with crispy fried shallots at the top. good, but meh. my friends also tried the shackmeister ale and were impressed. as for the fries debate: cheese vs no cheese? i actually preferred the non cheese one because the cheese makes it soggy..HOWEVER, you can also ask for cheese on the side so i'd recommend doing that. best of both worlds. 

service was great even though it was so late at night, lots of seating, beautiful venue with pretty glittery sign. DEFINITELY recommend this place i'm a hardcore in-n-out fan and will stick with their burgers, but the shroom burger is outta this world! we wanted to grab some burgers to bring back home, but the next day, line was loooooong around noon =( 

TLDR: get the SHROOM BURGER, get regular fries and ask for CHEESE SAUCE on the side."}
{"text":"I was finally able to get in the door and find a seat. In the past every time we would think about coming the line was way too long. I now realize that one reason the line is long is due to the proximity of the front door and the ordering line. Also everything is cooked to order which is awesome. Finally it's because the burgers are delicious. 

The staff was extremely friendly, helpful and patient. They explained the menu options and were in no way in a hurry. We ordered 2 burgers, 2 fries, 1 sweet tea and 1 water. Our order totaled  just above $30!!  Our burgers: Double Bbq bacon cheddar and a double cheeseburger. Additionally we had 1 regular fry and 1 bbq cheese bacon fry. 
The burgers are very good. The meat and topping are fresh and make to order. The fries are fries. They are crinkle cut but nothing to write home about. The bacon was crispy and plentiful which are 2 qualities I enjoy in bacon. 
I wanted to give this place 5 stars but I can't because of the price. The service was good but there is no table service it's fast food style seating. So overall it was a good burger but not the best, and it was pricey."}
{"text":"Ney York, is this all you got? I can't believe people are comparing this place to In-N-Out Burger. You can get a Double-Double combo for about $6 bucks at In-N-Out while a Double Shack Burger is $8 bucks a la carte. 

I ordered the Shack Stack which is the cheeseburger with the cheese stuffed mushroom all in one. $10 bucks. 

Burger was too salty. I couldn't taste the meat due to the giant battered and cheesy stuffed mushroom overpowering the meat. So the meat to cheese to bun ratio was way off in this burger. Does not live up to my expectation of what a $10 dollar burger should taste like.

Girlfriend ordered the double Smoke Shack: Double bacon cheeseburger. $10 bucks.

Burger again was too salty. She got 2 patties so this time the meat to bun ratio was much better. The pickled red peppers with its acidity balanced well with the richness of the melted cheese and bacon. Not a bad burger but not a $10 dollar burger by any means.

Fries: Probably the highlight of the meal. These are crinkle cut fries with just the right amount of crunch on the outside and they are thick enough that you get some chewy potato on the inside. Decent sized portion for $3 bucks.

Summary: Burgers are overpriced by $4 bucks. If you're comparing this to In-N-Out then do yourself a favor and get In-N-Out, you get the same size/type of burger at the price that it's worth. 

If I was to spend $10 on a burger, then I'd go to Bachi Burger instead. Take notes Shack Shack, Bachi Burger is what a $10 burger should look and taste like.

TLDR: $10 price tag, $5 dollar burger."}
{"text":"I love burgers... yes I do. And I'll admit, I was intrigued to try Shake Shake since they opened up shop in Las Vegas. It was hyped up for sure.

That being said, I'm not thrilled to pay $25 for cheeseburgers, fries and hot dogs. Yes, they're good but not THAT good. 

The servers here are very nice and the restaurant is clean, but you can get a good burger at lots of places for way less money."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is one of those places where once you have it, you're addicted for life! 

The District desperately needed a chill, high quality dining option and boy... did we get one! I've been a huge fan of Shake Shack since trying it a few years ago - my go to is the Chicken Shack and the original Shack Burger. They also have a lot of other great offerings that most \"burger\" joints don't have... beer & wine, cold brew, dog biscuits and so on. I've come here more times than I'd like to admit since opening... if you haven't been, give it a shot! You may run into me 

Pro tip - Order on the app before you get there to skip the line!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the west coast, Shake Shack! Tastes just like the Shake Shack I had in NY, just the space inside is way bigger. I recommend the shack stack burger or even just the shroom burger because their portobello mushroom is cheesy crispy goodness. I'm not a fan of the cheese on the cheese fries (I don't really dig the processed cheese taste). Workers are nice and even refilled our drinks for free. It gets pretty damn busy in here though, and it took quite a while for my order to come out."}
{"text":"All comparisons aside. I'm a burger fan and enjoy many of the varieties offered in the category. 

With that said, Shack Shack has some tasty food. Their menu has a variety of options one is surely to find something to order. I've been to this location a couple times and have enjoyed my meal each time. 

So far, I've ordered the ShackBurger, cheese and regular fries and nice cold brews. All satisfying without feeling \"bleh\" after. 

My only mini gripe about SS, is the price. For a complete meal, a ShackBurger burger, fries and drink (beer in my case) is over $15! (more if you get higher priced items). If you're feeding a family, it gets pricey. However, the quality of the food has been consistent and doesn't disappoint in taste. 

Located next to the strip and the T-Mobile Arena, the atmosphere is very Vegas, with good people watching and large crowds at times. It's definitely touristy and loud when it gets busy. There is ample seating inside and outside. 

Shake shack is a nice treat when visiting Las Vegas and worth a visit. I'm definitely a fan and wouldn't turn down a chance to dine at this location again."}
{"text":"This place is so hype. I'm really glad I got it off of my bucket list but one time is enough for me, I wouldn't eat it again. Service is fast and friendly. 

Single shackburger: it was so squished and very tiny. Couldn't really taste the shack sauce either. Cheese fries: I only liked this! The problem with it was it came out cold sadly, but it's very addicting I wanted to eat the whole thing but of course I had to save some for my friends. 

I prefer sticking to in-n-out forever and always."}
{"text":"O-ver-ra-ted. *clap* *clap* *clapclapclap*.

Make that... overrated and over-hyped. Other than In-N-Out, I wasn't looking to a particular place in Vegas more than Shake Shack. Clearly, I was disappointed. While my pictures may make you think \"Damn, that looks good...\", don't let them deceive you. The fries? Simple crinkle cut may-as-well-be-frozen fries. Not bad, not good, they're whatever. They have a cheese sauce they put on them, but I'm pretty confident it's the same radioactive goop you'd find on your nachos at a carnival or baseball game or what have you.

The burger was decent, thought the patty was fast food patty/paper thin. For the price, I expected a lot more. My Shack Stack was a little salty, and almost tasted more like a grilled cheese with lettuce and tomato more than a burger. The Shack Stack has a fried portabello and cheese patty looking thing on it, which is set on top of a burger patty... the problem is, that pretty much overpowers the wafer thin hamburger. Was it bad? No, not at all, but factoring in my expectation, what people say about the place, and the price, I don't feel inclined to revisit. 

My girlfriend's Jackpot ice cream or shake or blizzard or whatever they call it was pathetic in appearance ... half melted and not loaded with toppings like suggested. Despite that, it was very good, and the best thing I had at Shake Shack.

Shake Shack may well taste amazing after a long night of drinking in Vegas, but as a sober guy just looking for a midnight snack, Shake Shack just didn't cut it for me... not to mention Shake Shack (as of July 1st) doesn't honor room charges. Boo... $20 for a mediocre meal."}
{"text":"Okay the wait is definitely worth it especially for the shakes and burgers!!! The burgers are so good especially the shake sauce! Once we placed our order we only waited about 10 minutes or less for our food to come out. 

My only negative comment is that the fries leave much to be desired. I don't even think they used a hint of salt on them. BUT, my strawberry shake was amazing and once we got inside the line moved fairly quickly. They have a large outdoor patio and plenty of seating on the inside!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack is fine, but that's it. It seems to be powered by hype alone. It's burgers aren't bad, but if you've had 5 Guys or Smash Burger there's no need need to bother with Shake Shack unless it's nearby. You probably want to try it for yourself anyways, so at least don't wait in a ridiculous line for it."}
{"text":"First off if you order through an app, it may have a different name. You asked my name not the order name. No common sense because she couldn't figure out Angel is part of the email address it's under. Cold food for over $12, unacceptable! I ordered via the app. I was told that I would receive a text when my order was done. I'm thinking if you say 1:30, the food will be fresh. I guess they start cooking it when you order! I'm so disappointed. I ordered it well done...There were red and pink spots throughout the patty. The only hot thing was the cheese sauce. Tired of spending money on bad food. First time, last time."}
{"text":"A visit to Shake Shack is a must when we are in Vegas. Leave your calorie-counter at home - you're in Sin City, after all! 

The bread is soft, the meat is crispy/soft/savory, and the veggies crunchy. The cheese fries rich, salty, and mouthy. I love it!

I've also sample the jackpot concrete - its a tasty sprinkle-y custard dessert only available at the Vegas location. I've also enjoyed the Shroom burger - its a deep fried mushroom stuffed with oozing cheese! MmmM.... If I had to choose though, I prefer the meat burger.

Service is also friendly and efficient. You order at the stand, and your pager buzzes when the food is ready to pick up. We got our meal in less than 10 minutes when it was pretty busy."}
{"text":"Yeah, $32 for two burger combos (fries and drink) is rather steep and the reason for 4 stars. On a positive note, our wait was only 10 minutes compared to the 60 minute wait in West LA. 

The verdict: Fries were good, but don't hold a candle to the In-N-Out well done fries. The meat in the burger was awesome and the bacon on mine was BAZANGA (meaning it wasn't some flimsy piece of micro-bacon but a crispy slice of thick cut deliciousness).

Overall: Good place, but this is the one and only time I will go out of my way for it. Where I live, there is no need. Within a mile of where I live, there is an In-N-Out, 2 Habits and a 5 Guys being built. 

Best of Luck to you Shake Shack! May I suggest Muncie, Indiana for your next venture?"}
{"text":"The burgers were all good. Flavors are Great. We all got double meats and we got the bacon cheese fries. Daughter got her chicken shack. We were all surprise on the taste. This place should of gotten 5 stars BUT the price is crazy! Almost $10 for the smoke shack double burger and the fries was around $4.50. For that price the burger should of been double the size. Overall it's good! But don't complain about your bill afterwards. Lol"}
{"text":"Came around lunch time and there was a long line but it was worth it. Ordered the double cheese burger and cheese fries. The cheese burger was delicious, but the cheese fries weren't as amazing as everyone made them out to be. BUT the fries were still very good. Visiting here is a must in the New York area."}
{"text":"Went to Shake Shack for the first and last time tonight. First I was disappointed at the large notice next to the shakes basically saying they can't guarantee cross contamination of allergens. While I'm grateful for the warning it was a disappointment they can't seem to make cross contamination a priority. Since I'm allergic to peanuts I didn't take the chance so over half their menu was of no use to me. 
I had the shack burger and cheese fries. The burger was seasoned with some kind of garlic salt, I didn't care for at all and the size was kind of like a baby burger. The bun was good but other then that, mediocre at best. The fries were...well fries. Nothing special about them or the cheese sauce. In and Out is 10x better. Especially considering we could have had the same meal for half the price."}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack! Fast food doesn't get any better than this. I tried their new chicken sandwich and it was as expected.. great! Seasonal Christmas shake was so ono! Consistent. Crazy good. Convenient. Awesome for a post rough night in Vegas baby!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack is incredible. I heard about it, but now that I have been there, it is the bomb. The food is super clean and full of flavor. It's executed well. Love the shakes, crinkle cut fries, hot dogs lemonade, and of course, the burgers. I tried them all on my recent first visit. They do it simple but they do it all extremely well. No weak links. Way better than their competitor, I&O. On a whole different level."}
{"text":"I got the chickn shack and my boyfriend got the smoke shack. The chickn shack was good, no complaints however my boyfriend got the smoke shack. It was alright but they over did it with the diced cherry peppers and he only got one slice of bacon on the burger. The portions are small, I personally think that you're paying more for what you get. The food isn't bad but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype! 

I heard a lot of people rave about Shake Shack burgers and know that they line up to get them but, I was really disappointed when I decided to give them a try on my last trip to Vegas. I wanted to keep it simple so I had the \"ShackBurger\". There is absolutely nothing special about it. It's like a much smaller version of something that you would get a family chain restaurant. Bleh.

I can't comment on the fries because I didn't try them. They looked OK but I wanted to try a shake instead. I enjoyed the shake. They had a few more flavors to choose from but I went with the basic chocolate ( 'cause I like to keep it simple). It was on the \"runny\" side but I actually like them when you can get them through a straw right away. 

I don't know what it is but maybe people are too caught up in the publicity and say something great about the food to go along with the crowd. I'm pretty sure if you did a blind taste test against some smaller fast food chains these burgers would be at the bottom.

If you like long lines, beer or wine with your fast food or IPOs, this is your place."}
{"text":"There will never be a time where Shake Shack disappoints. Even will lines out of the door, service is fast,  efficient and overall impeccable. It is obvious that workers care about their customers which is always appreciated. The food alone is outstanding- I would recommend to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Incomparable to In and Out but as far as as an entity of its own, not bad--I can see why people crave it. The burger is extremely soft and a bit cheesy if you opt for the cheese burger. The menu has a variety of little add ons and even has alcohol to compliment the burger. 

Fries are pretty good, the cheese fries
Are better. The only complaint I have is that the burger is pretty salty...but that's what the shake Is for I suppose, to wash it all down. Ordered the vanilla custard shake and thought it was alright. 

All in all I'm pretty happy they opened one in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Never been disappointed with their burgers or chicken burgers. 

Double down fries is a must try. Just make sure you have enough people to take it down. 

It definitely one of the better fast food burger places I've been too. Always a must stop when in Vegas. 

The hot chicken is a must try as well."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of chains, but damn son... I have to give credit where credit is due!!! 
This place does it right. 
Let's be real for a minute. They are definitely no Wine Burger or even a Giant Hamburger out in Mesa, but clearly head and shoulders above smashburger OR 5 guys. Jesus Christ 5 guys... 
Also they have an incredible patio. The dipshit that owns Lux should come look at that patio.
I mean seriously. The patio at Lux is the most depressing thing I've ever seen, and I've been to the holocaust museum."}
{"text":"The quality of food is not as good as the ones in New York. They shack stack burger and the shack burger was good, but not great. Over all the service and the experience was good."}
{"text":"We were on the strip late one evening and decided to try Shake Shack and see if it was any good.  We ordered the burger with a mushroom on it.  I was impressed.  The mushroom added a lot of flavor and the beef has a nice grilled taste.  The cheese really adds to everything else.  I think this far exceeds In and Out burgers.  Next time will have sample the fries and shakes."}
{"text":"Everyone should go try the Chick N' Shack! The pickles are simple delicious, and the sauce that comes on top is creamy and full of flavor. It's a little bit on the pricey side for a \"sit and order\" restaurant but it never disappoints. Additionally, the staff is always attentive and the sitting area is always clean!"}
{"text":"Expensive for a burger that was not the best. 

BURGER:
My boyfriend ordered the SHAKE SHACK DOUBLE which he described the meat to be juicy, the melted cheese was great but did he didn't taste the shake shack sauce if there was any. He expected a stronger taste. But overall a good burger for him. 

I ordered the SMOKE SHACK DOUBLED. The first bite into it was great but after a few bites it was plain to me so I stopped eating. 

FRIES: 
Me: too salty for my taste
Him: the crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and they don't get soggy right away 

ENVIRONMENT: 
The vibe is great. There are TV screens that run sport programs which is a plus in my book. Welcoming environment and makes you want to stay. 

I would like to try the one in NYC for the authentic feel."}
{"text":"Ordered the deep fried mushroom burger and fries.

The cheese that was in the fried mushroom came out cold even though I bit into it right upon sitting. Fries were okay."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for the day where I would be able to enjoy the East Coast's most hyped burger. A few weeks ago, that day arrived. I could finally toss my opinion in on the \"Battle of the Burgers\" - In n Out vs. Shake Shack.

I grabbed their basic cheeseburger, the crinkle fries and a water. I did not want to allow one of their tasty (and damn, they are tasty) shakes, custard, or a 32oz beer to cloud the flavors of the burger and fries. 

Well, the burger was solid. I'd rate it higher than Five Guys and most other burger joints. It tasted clean and by clean I mean, not a greasy-bun-destroying-mess. In-n-Out wins this one.

The fries were alright. I'm not a crinkle fry kind of guy, but I respect the fry they put out. In-n-Out takes the fries title, too.

After I thoroughly demolished my burger and fry, I ordered a 32oz beer. It was Brooklyn Brewing's special Shake Shack ale. I've had Brooklyn's offerings before and this was par for the course. Nothing mind blowing, but a pretty damn serviceable offering. I enjoyed the beer in my collectable mug as I strolled the Strip. In-n-Out doesn't have beer, so props to Shake Shack on this one.

I got tastes of both an incredible shake and their well-known custard. Both were winners to me. 

OH and the chicken sandwich looked world class. Might grab one of those instead of a burger next time I hit up the Shack in Vegas."}
{"text":"Visited on Christmas eve and it was packed. First time ever at SS. I did not know what I was missing. I am not a big fan of In N Out. I'd seen videos of the SS/INO debate. I can say that SS has INO whooped. Their crinkle fries dominate INO's feeble potato slivers. But, their pricepoints are significantly different also. Basically triple. So to be fair to INO would I rate SS as thrice as good? Yes. So, I guess by my metric then they are equal.

The double Smokeshack I ate was flavorful. I could taste the seasoning on the meat & not just cheese like INO's. *Disclaimer-I order my burgers dry, no spread. Also, tried the Shack-cago dog. Pretty good. 

Everyone was friendly except for the girl calling & handing out food. She had a sour look on her face especially for one as attractive looking as she was. The only negative. Perhaps she was having a bad day so I'll give her the BOTD.

Wish they had SS in OC. Closest location is Glendale or Hollywood. Boohoo."}
{"text":"And so it begins, the war between In-n-Out and Shake Shack on west coast turf. 

I came in on a Saturday afternoon and surprisingly, there was only a few people in front of me in line! Talk about some good timing. It was a little more challenging finding a place to sit but we managed to snag a table in under 5 minutes. Person who served me was super cool and super nice, even when I handed him the wrong amount of money (how embarrassing). I have to say the service here is pretty amazing considering it being just a fast food joint. 

The menu is huge and clean; you can see it once you walk in. I'm a pretty simple person so I opted to get the Shack burger, which is the basic cheeseburger. The burger was pretty good, but I was a bit underwhelmed while eating it. There wasn't anything special about the patty but it was definitely cooked well. What won me over were the cheese fries. I love cheese and I love potatoes. I'm usually not a fan of crinkle-cut fries but holy cow, every ridge of their fries were crunchy and the cheese oozed over it made it 100 times better! Also got a vanilla shake which was delicious.

Overall, I'd come back again but I definitely prefer in-n-out more."}
{"text":"They don't call it Shake Shack for nothin! Best shakes ever! The burgers are really tasty too!

We used to drive all the way to the strip for Shake Shack so we were really happy when they opened one around the corner from our house. 

Lots of indoor + outdoor seating w/ misters.

They also have great customer service! You can now place your orders online so it's ready when you get there! We mistakenly placed our order for the LV Blvd location. We tried calling the strip location to cancel w/ no answer then we got a notification our order was ready for pickup but we're at least a 30 minute drive away. So we called this location & explained the situation. They said they'd take care of cancelling the other order & transferring it to their location so we didn't get charged twice. Our food was ready when we arrived & so so yummy!!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Fries were very good,  burger was actually very good,  had plenty of flavor...but the burger was not much bigger than a slider,  and it was more that 6 bucks!  A double would have been almost $10,  add fries and drink,  probably 16-17 bucks!  Good food,  but not worth the price.  I'll would go back,  but only if I happened to be in the area..."}
{"text":"Shake Shack has landed in Phoenix.  It was.... 

Not that great.  The citrus matcha shake was incredible.  The fries were meh.  The burger was... okay.  Not worth nearly $6.  

For two burgers, one order of fries and two shakes it cost $27.00. ouch.  In-N-Out burger is MUCH better and a better price.  $30 isn't expensive but... should be better quality.  

Now, I would return for a Citrus Matcha shake in a heartbeat.  The staff was really friendly and they were well trained.  

I do, however, plan to return for the chicken sandwich to try it out.  It will definitely NOT be a destination for me."}
{"text":"A little underwhelming after hearing all the raves on this chain and looking at so many Instagram photos of people's meals here.  I came here on a super hot day and we came in here to escape the heat and grab a quick bite to eat.  I'm sure everyone was trying to do the same because it was pretty packed.  The line was long and took about 10 minutes to get to the front.  Finding a table to seat all 7 of us was tough even though the restaurant itself is relatively large.  

I tried a burger, cheese fries and black and white milkshake.  I much prefer the fries from In N Out.  Thought cheese on top of crinkle fries would be revolutionary but I think I actually prefer it without the cheese.  The fries were just mehhh - I just prefer thinner fries I guess!  The burger was good from what I remember.  But what was worth coming back for sure was the milkshake! So creamy and indulgent...makes me want to go back and try all the other flavors!!"}
{"text":"Good burger, Vegas prices. Tried this for the first time to compare to In-N-Out and I would say Shake Shack is comparable.. definitely better fries. Basic burger with a good amount of veggies/meat. I would 100% recommend getting their crinkle cut fries, it's basic but not all places make them perfectly crunchy on the outside and fluffy/potatoey on the inside."}
{"text":"Good burger if overpriced.  Although tasty i felt like the patty outs dropping grease.  Novelty start to wear off pretty quick.  I do like the buns they use.  Overall a bit overrated if you ask me"}
{"text":"I've heard of this joint for a long time. I've been wanting to go for a while to the New York New York location. That never happened and while strolling through the mall today looking to pick something quick up. We decided on this place when we spotted it on the directory!!! I was so disappointed to see fellow yelpers gave it an average of 3.5 stars. Regardless, that didn't stop me since it was my must go to list.

I must admit as a loyal in n out lover these burgers are better! Yeah it's $2 bucks more and same size but the quality and juicy flavor is well worth it. The staff served us with great service as well! I'll have to come back to try other options including the eye candy shakes. 

They have a patio with thoughtful water bowls for your dogs and dog treats on the menu. Winning !!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been in NY, I've never been able to make it to a Shake Shack (there are so many good restaurants, that burgers are the last thing on my mind), so I was happy that they opened one up in Vegas. I was actually in Austin last week and a Shake Shack had just opened there a couple days before and the line was insane, like at least 100 people deep, so I decided not to go.  Thankfully, the line wasn't so bad in Vegas.

I'm not sure if this version is as authentic or as good as the ones in NY, but at least I got to try to the West Coast casino version of it, lol.

The shakes are aight, the fries aren't bad, but the burgers are very good.  As good as In-N-Out?  Nah, but it wasn't too far off.  I would say that if you like Five Guys, then this is more for you.  It has a very Five Guys feel regarding the grease and the meat.  I do like it more than Five Guys--there's a bit more going on and more flavor.  The fries are also pretty good (better than Five Guys and perhaps In-N-Out).

Overall, I'd come back.  Would I make a trip out of it?  Probably not."}
{"text":"Great burger and fries! Shake was just average. Enjoyed the experience. I would take the family here again for sure. Nice location too"}
{"text":"Shake Shack was high on our list of places to go in Vegas. We were 20 minutes ahead of the 11 AM opening, no one around, so we wandered around the park in front of the arena, and came back 5 minutes before they opened to find a long line! The wait wasn't too bad, as ordering at the counter was pretty efficient. It took some time to get our food as they were just starting for the day. Navigating the crowd to pick up our food and bring it to the table took some patience. As we were finishing our meal people were hovering near by waiting for our table. So the crowds are kind of annoying.

We both got double cheeseburgers and shared an order of chili cheese fries and an order of plain fries. The burgers were extremely good. The beef patty is full of flavor and has that hand-ground texture that marks an excellent burger. The bun and toppings were all very nice. The plain crinkle-cut fries were nothing special. Similar to Del Taco but we like the flavor of Del Taco's fries better. The chili and cheese brought the fries to another level, very good chili, but there was not enough of it. Despite the crowd, a server came by and asked how we were doing and if we needed anything. \"More chili?\" said David, joking. But sure enough she returned a minute later with a small serving of chili. With that addition, the fries were excellent. Top marks for attentive service.

Is it the best burger? Well it's right up there. We placed it above Smashburger and Habit Burger, which we both like, in the company of such burger luminaries as Umami Burger and In N Out. You will have to make your own ranking. We would go back there again, but given the crowds I might be just as happy going to one of our other top spots."}
{"text":"So the big question for all the Californians: is it Better than in n out.  Well it's not totally comparable .  Shake shack is more expensive and feels more like a restaurant than fast food.  So here is the comparison: 

Shake shack: 
-Way better for fries
- chicken sandwhich is really good and better than chick filet
- more flavors for shakes

In n out
- would say the burger is better for the price. I like the thousand island sauce and shake shack does not offer grilled onions
- burger bun is not as soggy as shake shack"}
{"text":"Awful food and shakes are made with syrup.  Would not recommend this place at all. Nothing comes with anything everything is ala Carte."}
{"text":"So they had the BEST Spicy  chicken sandwich Ever!!! 
I did not know it was only a temporary item!! I was sooooo disappointed when I arrived here today and they no longer offer it! 

Always great service and very clean restaurant. 
I had always eaten here when I was in the area.... I am so sad now"}
{"text":"I wasn't blown away I was hoping SS would take my imagination to NYC where SS originates but no.  Nothing. It was just OK!

Customer service was great, super friendly and welcoming Major stars for that! 
I got the smoke shack burger.  The bun was spongy and soft reminded me of White Castle it was just alright-I feel jipped!
It wasn't very big either considering the price per burger.  The French fries were ok, Kroger brand frozen fries are just as good
my kids got the shakes and they were happy with them, I think or maybe they were just SO parched because we were in Vegas on the hottest day! 
I got the beer from Brooklyn, tasty indeed.

I don't think I'm going back again but I'm glad I got to try the place."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and found the service to be a little lacking but the awesome burgers kept me coming back. I came in tonite expecting the same but instead I was greeted by a friendly face and a great attitude. I mentioned my less than stellar experiences and thanked her for being so nice. As I was waiting for my food the manager Jeff asked me about my previous  experiences. I told him it wasn't bad enough for me not to come back. He was very sincere and wanted to know all about my last visits. I felt that he really cares about his customer experience. I will definitely be back on my next trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"Only 3.5 stars? Why? I had a good experience my first time here. There was no line, service was quick, many employees working to help with the orders and clean up. I loved the cheeseburger! It was delicious. They have crinkle fries, which are my favorite. And hot dogs!! Not to mention the dessert. 

I ordered the single cheeseburger and added pickles and onions. It came out hot and fresh and the taste was very good for \"fast food\". I was impressed. I also had half of the shakecago dog! Wow!! It was great!! 

I see a lot of reviews talking about how expensive the place it. Compared to what? McDonald's? Because if I can get away with a dinner (not lunch) for myself plus dessert under $20? I'm doing good. Will definitely recommend and return!! 

Outstanding customer service as well."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I just LOVE this place. I had it in NYC for the first time last year and tried their chicken sandwich, crinkle fries, and lemonade.. loved it all.. I was so happy to find out they recemtly opened up one here in Ohio. I tried their burger and it's delicious as well. I will be back.. btw.. the lines have been long, but totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place since hearing that it is the in-n-out of east coast.

I got the smoke shack and holy shiiz I didn't expect it to be that spicy. My mouth was burning when I was only halfway done with the burger, but it was so good. The fries are a MUST, they are so crispy. 

Sorry, shake shack, but in-n-out is a better because they grill the buns, but I do love your fries. Def can't wait for shake shack to open in LA next year."}
{"text":"I'm basing the 3 stars on food alone. But I'll start from beginning.... The line is incredibly long to wait for burgers. It it extremely busy inside and you pretty much have to wait standing around... Waiting like vultures for someone to leave. 

As far as the food, it was just ok for me. The flavor of the burger didn't live up to the hype. I felt that inn n out had more flavor. The fries with the cheese was good. The cheese tasted like that fake cheese on nachos at a baseball game and actual real cheese... Weird, but it wasn't bad. The meal didn't taste bad, just didn't blow me out of the water. I have had a better burger."}
{"text":"Had a cheeseburger, cheese fries and a chocolate malted shake.   Everything was really delicious.  Definitely satisfies a burger craving.   Nice, clean and spacious atmosphere and courteous staff."}
{"text":"Was starving when I came here so maybe my review will be a little biased.

Ordered the ShackBurger, the cheese fries, and a vanilla milkshake. I ordered two burgers (one for my friend) and the total was $22.

I thought the ShackBurger was sooo good and the cheese fries also great. The vanilla shake was also super good. Honestly I was just amazed and this is coming from someone who loves In n Out. I don't really believe the two to be comparable because it's different tastes in a way but I guess Shake Shack is ridiculously expensive for what it is. I also finished everything really quickly (small portions).

If anything it's a must try for Vegas and they're going to open one soon in LA and I will definitely be checking that out!"}
{"text":"Great little burgers with tons of flavor. Fresh ingredients makes a world of a difference in taste. Good beef with the right amount of fat. The sauce they put on the burgers is great as well I can eat that with just the fries. I think it's a little step in price but it was the cheapest burger place other than fast food on the strip. I would definitely have it again."}
{"text":"Decided to put this to the test against the king \"In-N-Out\". Let me start by saying the staff was friendly and helpful, the kitchen area looked organized and clean, and the rest of the restaurant was trendy modern and pleasing to the eye. I felt like the music was to loud, but to each their own. I ordered a single patty shack burger with cheese, lettuce, tomato, shack sauce, pickle, and onion. I also ordered a side of fries, and a strawberry shake. This came out to $15.13!!!! This is quite literally double the price I would pay for the same thing at \"In-N-Out\". The first thing I tried were the crinkle cut french fries, and they were burnt. After tasting them, I took a closer look at them, and you could visually tell they were over done french fries. Considering the price I paid, they should have somebody in the kitchen paying attention to these details. I have been going to \"In-N-Out\" for 20+ years, and I can count the number of times on one hand that this has happened there. The burger was actually very good. It tasted fresh, light, and almost healthy. The shake was also very good. Was it worth 15$? Absolutely not! Honestly, I do not understand how they get away with charging these prices? I do not see this business model penetrating the market as far as its main competitor \"In-N-Out\", especially when \"In-N-Out\" has better quality control, consistent friendly services, and quality ingredients. \"In-N-Out\" wins 10 out of 10 times. If I wanted a different burger that has a somewhat lighter healthier taste I will go to \"The Habit Burger\"."}
{"text":"Wonderful bun and delicious burger. Fries are very ordinary. The problem is that it is a very small burger. If I was 90, it would be the right size. For me, it was very small. Especially for the price, I was disappointed."}
{"text":"They are really busy but they are quick. They have excellent customer service!!  We always stop by here when we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I loved my burger. I ordered the cheeseburger with the bacon and diced cherry peppers with crinkle fries. The burger was cooked to perfection and the fries were crispy and hot. I took a bite before I remembered to take a picture, but I did manage to get one in lol. Also, I'm not sure if it was just me, but I totally fell in love with the sweet tea there. The staff was super friendly and the restaurant was spacious and clean. I sat indoors, but the outside patio area looked inviting and several patrons took advantage of it. If you like really good burgers I recommend you give this place a shot. The sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's been over 6 months since I've been out to Vegas, and to Shake Shake specifically, but since when people ask me for recommendations in Vegas, SHAKESHAKE is basically my #1 recommendation, I figured I'd better write a review!
I initially heard about ShakeShack from friends that traveled to NYC, and basically it was described as a \"classier In & Out\" Burger.  haha, which may or may not be true.  They have different menu options, so that is what appeals to me.  As a Vegetarian I was thrilled by their SHROOMBURGER on the menu!!  It was nice to be able to have actual protein source instead of just getting to try fries & a milkshake like at other classic Burger Places.  Also, when I was there I ordered the CONCRETE-SHACK ATTACK with chocolate custard, chocolate truffle cookie dough, chunks of dark chocolate and plenty of chocolate sprinkles and fudge sauce!!  And naturally I ordered crinkle Cut french fries to accompany all this yumminess!

My hubby opted to by a pure Chocolate Milkshake as a classic, and a baseline to compare to other places.  He did think it was delicious, but after having a few tastes of my Concrete, I think he wished he would have opted for one of their specialties!  And, you can even design your own concrete, and pick the toppings to go in as well, so that is always an option if you don't want to try their Signature Concretes.

To be fair, in Vegas, there is not a shortage of burger places such as Gordon Ramsay, White Castle, Wahlburgers, Burger Bar, Fat Burger, In & Out etc.  And, I haven't been to a majority of those to be honest, so I can't really speak to what ShakeShack compares to.  But, I just figured that I'd trust New Yorker's... I figured they would know what is up with their New York-based fast Food Chain. ;-)  And, they have vegetarian choices, so that is even an extra bonus to me!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers! You can't go wrong with the Shack Burger. This would have to be my go to when ordering. The soft hamburger bun is sweet and tastes so good. Some other good burgers that I've tried and were good are the Shroom Burger and Shack Stack.  Note: the shroom burger has no meat. Don't forget to order some fries to compliment your Burger. The fries are crispy and yummy too! Love Shake Shack not only for their delicious food, but because they also serve alcohol! Shake Shacks burgers are different compared to In N Out burgers because of how their hamburgers taste, but for those wondering, I still prefer In N Out over Shake Shack."}
{"text":"YES for the best fast food in Vegas. This is a really nice Shake Shack restaurant, considering that it is fairly new. There was a line outside when we got there, but the line moved really fast! Once we ordered the food, the food came out in 10-15min. Their fries go perfectly with their chocolate shake. I ordered a chicken burger as I wasn't in mood for beef burgers, but my friends enjoyed their burgers. The only downside to this place is that there are a lot of people that hogs tables before they get their food, making it hard to find somewhere to eat your meal."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhh! Greasy goodness. I don't understand why this place has such an average rating. Its a great burger. I would definitely put it up there as far as something I would crave for when wanting a burger. And Crinkle cut fries with nacho cheese. Yum. I think if you're into cheese as much as I am then this would be your spot Goey cheesy goodness I had the bacon double cheeseburger and the bacon was cooked perfectly it was crispy yet chewy I enjoyed it. I'm also very interested into trying the chicken sandwich here my friends that came here with us said it was the best chicken sandwich they ever had. I'll have to try it for myself next time. The reason for my 4 star is because I feel that for $35 bucks for burger fries and drinks it just doesn't make sense why it's so pricey. I'll still go back though."}
{"text":"After buzzing me that my order was ready, I went up to the counter and stood there for almost 10 minutes waiting for my meal. I thought this was fast food. After finally getting an answer from a rude employee, she told me my order was wrong and they had to redo it. One burger and one order of fries. Not that complicated. They finally got it right and she hands me the tray without any apologies or thank you for waiting. Save your time and skip this place. You can get a burger and fries this mediocre anywhere."}
{"text":"After all the hype and hearing about this place over and over and over.  We decided to come here for a burger before seeing a show at the T-Mobile arena.  I would have given a lower rating but the really amazing Shack Ale made up for the seriously lacking flavor, size and price of the burger that I got.  The place was packed and the service was quick but I'm not to happy with the food.  Burger is the same if not less than a backyard burger that anyone can make on a grill.  The fries were your same old crinkle cut fires that places stopped doing years ago.  The beer on the other hand way was good and put a smile on my face.  I like beer and smiles so it's nice when they come together."}
{"text":"Loved every single bite.  Just what I was craving after a long night in Vegas.  Wish it opened earlier than 11:00 am :)"}
{"text":"Man, why are people comparing Shake Shack to In-N-Out? Come on now. Theyre so different in MANY WAYS. Let's just be straight now. Come on seriously. Even their price range is different, tsk tsk.

I'd tell you that I have been to Shake Shack in NY (2 different locations) and I have also tried it in Korea but no, I didnt get to try in Glendale, CA or Hollywood yet. I had no plans of coming to this location but my friend has not tried any SS in the past and she really just wanted to try it.

We both got the Shack Stack? burger, the one with the patty and the mushroom. It was so big but juicy and cheesy. I was eating the burger with the vanilla shake and their infamous cheese fries so burger was a little too heavy for me at some point. I dont normally eat any condiments or sauces but had to put on some hot sauce on my burger because without it, I probably wouldnt have finished my burger, haha. Even with the aid of hot sauce, I didnt get to finish the burger. Oops.

I had to go up to the register to ask something and the guy at the register was super funny and nice but the girl who took my order was just OK. She looked mad and stressed. She didnt really greet me or nothing, which is pretty unprofessional because she lacks customer service. 

This location is pretty spacious and clean since its pretty new anyway. I wouldnt recommend to come to Shake Shack in general but if you really really want to try then just come and try it. I dont think you need to come here more than once honestly."}
{"text":"Seriously, this branch was better than the one i had in NY (near times square)

When I first tried shake shack for the first time in NY I wasn't really impressed. I decided to give it another shot and I'm so glad I did. I cant even put into words. SO AMAZING. 

It was BOGO shake day too (in celebration of valentine's day) 

The only complaint I have is the service. We asked for the shack stack with no cheese and the cashier said he couldn't do it which is fine because the mushroom patty had cheese in it. So we asked if we could get a regular burger with no cheese and he said no. I don't understand that logic because - isn't it just a slice of cheese on a burger .. that you omit ? 

Whatever - this place is too bomb to let that matter. I'll be back! So glad they made one on the west coast!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for burgers, and that's saying a lot since I will only eat at select places for fast food anymore.  The cheeseburgers here are phenomenal!  I always order mine well done, I think they come medium done if you don't specify your order.  The bun has potatoes in the recipe, so I've heard, and that may be why I love it so much.  The \"Crinkle\" shaped fries are delicious and I end up eating too many of them!  My mom is a big fan of hot dogs and this is her favorite place to get one.  My dad likes some of the local beers that they offer.  It's just an all-around great place for foodies to get top notch fast food!"}
{"text":"Meal #4 of 2017 Las Vegas Trip

There's a reason this place is called Shake Shack. You don't go here for a meal. You go here for custard. Okay, wait my reasoning is flawed since \"shake\" is in the name. What I'm getting at is that this place should be called Custard Shack or at least it should be related to dairy desserts in some way.

I remembered the burger being overhyped so I decided to try the classic hot dog instead. That was more disappointing. FRENCH'S mustard? Are you fucking kidding me? And then the whole thing fell apart about one third of the way in. There was too much moisture from the relish wetting the bottom bun, when it should have been on top. Also, serving it in a wrapper would have helped.

The manager went table to table to check on customers, and was nice to bring my daughter a new bun for her burger that fell apart. (I sense a bun structural integrity problem.)

The crinkle cut fries were really good. As I mentioned the real reason to go to Shake Shack is the frozen custard. I think plain vanilla is better to taste the frozen custard flavor. We had their Shark Attack - chocolate custard with mix-ins (I don't remember which ones now). But at Shake Shack chocolate really just tastes like frozen yogurt so everyone should know to get the vanilla, which I've had in New York and was fantastic.

{"text":"Don't eat here if you care about what you put in your body. From the street, it looks like one of those \"good food, fast\" type of places, but it's just fast food. Since the portobello mushroom burger comes with Munster cheese, I figured I could get decent cheese on a cheeseburger, but they only have American \"cheese,\" which isn't actually cheese at all. Absolutely everything is fried in soybean oil. Even the burger without cheese is oily and gross. The burger place inside New York, New York (Broadway Burger) is much better, though it is a little more expensive."}
{"text":"Based on the number of orders they were screwing up, I initially thought this was a new location. Turns out they've been there for almost three years. Staff didn't seem to care that none of their soda had any carbonation. We were in there eating for a half an hour and they never bothered to fix it even after customer after customer complained. They screwed up our shake order as well. Multiple customers brought back screwed up orders back and they didn't seem to care. That's a lot of food waste. The burgers and fries were good, but not having anything to wash them down with stunk. I hope this was an off night for them. Will definitely try another location back home in Arizona because the food was definitely delicious. Not sure I'd go back here since they don't care because most of their customers are probably from out of state and there just for a visit."}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoy this, I heard a lot about it this place. When I saw it arrived at kierland in Scottsdale that was my chance.

Strike 1 
Someone at kierland decided that a 15th burger place in 2 square miles was worth removing the sprinklers that the kids played in during the summers. Bad move

Strike 2
Went ib on a Friday night longer move quickly, order was a burger, fried and a drink. 21 dollars please, wait what? Did I heard correctly.. 21 dollars please. Ok pay the bill

Strike 3
Opened up my togo order. And what I saw was an in and out burger ...except the fries where crinkle cut.

So exact same food as in and out for 3 times the price

Huge disappointment"}
{"text":"Primero las comí en NY, ahora en Phoenix, y siguen estando igual de buenas, muy recomendables. Buen servicio, el lugar muy agradable."}
{"text":"Ever since eating at one of the locations  in NY I've craved the drug that is Shake Shack! Some of the best burgers I've had and I love that they're not some monstrosity of of patty, really allows you to enjoy the flavor.
Anyhow, while the Vegas location was delish, it wasn't nearly as good as what I had in NY."}
{"text":"Located in a posh part of Scottsdale, we decided to visit this location after stumbling upon it when visiting the adjacent Cheesecake Factory. In N Out Burger's fiercest rival, Shake Shack felt more upscale and polished as reflected in the quality of the menu items. If it wasn't for these two bitches looking at our shoes - we were catching a flight and didn't want to pack our bulky hikers - this visit would have received a higher rating."}
{"text":"First timer. Went for the basic: shakeshack burger and cheese fries. My tummy and wallet left v happy."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place as a \"Have to Go to\" place in Vegas. Eh. Long wait. Having to run when we find an open table, dirty or not. Food was ok but limited menu. Now I can say I did it. No plans to go out of my way for it, though. Another chain burger joint."}
{"text":"Pretty small portions and expensive for what you get. It was very busy and received some rave reviews, but I was a bit disappointed. Food was good, but it really wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"Yay! We loved another yummy burger/shake place in Vegas. The shack sauce is wonderful & we got the mud pie shake. Everything was great."}
{"text":"I can definitely say that the food here is delicious, but the mitigating factor is that this place is really proud of their own product. I ordered a meal consisting of a hamburger fries and a shake, and paid over $20 for it.   It's always hard to compare two places, because it is based on taste, but I know that the five dollar in and out double double tastes better to me then the $10 hamburger from this joint.  
      I definitely want to say that the staff who was working was awesome, the ambience is really lovely, kind of like an upscale sporty pub kind of vibe.
      They have some very interesting food, and if what I had was any indication, it will all be amazing, but be prepared to pay for it."}
{"text":"Went here around 9 after the Sunday night football game was over. Not too bad off wait about 5 mins. Hubby ordered the shack stack and I the smoke stack with cheese fries. My burger was really juicy and the cherry peppers gave it a slight spicy flavor! Hubby didn't like his burger.. He said it was too cheesy???!! I guess if your not a fan of Ooeeyy cheese don't order that and go for smoke shack! Fries were Bonn! Till next time!!"}
{"text":"Tried it a couple times in new york. just as goood here"}
{"text":"Had my favorite, shack stack, order of crinkle fries and a mango lemonade. Delicious! We also ordered a strawberry shake which was on point. I do think the prices are equivalent or even a tad more than NY (felt that way) which my friend agreed."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place that is supposed to be a staple on the East Coast, but I've never been to that part of the United states and I am only able to judge on my experience here.

I myself have grown up eating at the legendary In-N-Out burger, but I prefer to judge an establishment based on its own merits.

I ordered a single stack smokehouse burger, a small order of crinkle cut fries, and a chocolate peanut butter chocolate shake.

The burger had a very nice, well cooked flavor, but I found the size to be a bit lacking . The fries were excellent with a crispy texture and the shake was pretty good too!

Overall, I think if the burger's were a little bigger they'd be receiving a 5 star rating instead of three."}
{"text":"this is probably the only burger joint you will go to without feeling guilty  or greasy after you're done.  a little pricey  but worth the quality of meat. shakes are perfect not too thin and not to thick and bursting with flavor! 

yeah its crowded and the lines are long but eh. it's the strip .. for locals it may not be enough to walk  on the wild side and trek the ever annoying strip and crowds of people. but if you have to go there anyways might and well  stop by for a bite. 

everything is A la carte with strip prices so about $11-15 a meal  I took my kids and it wasn't too bad. it is loud so good for the family ... (not a date night place ) 

lines breeze by there's lots of cashiers. food is about 20 minute depending on the craziness. 

the smoke shack double is the way to go (bacon...duh) cheese fries yum but plain is also good. 

we've been here handful of times so we don't mind coming on a Sunday or weekday when it's not so crazy

things only reason the lack of a star is my roadhouse burger had carmelized onions that were way to gooey totally smushed my burger. shoulda stayed with my original smoke shack ."}
{"text":"I've seen reviews and pictures on multiple social media sites from my friends about this place. I'm happy I finally visited it, and enjoyed my meal. The Shake Shack was delicious, and well presented. As were the fries and my Oreo shake! The table setup is open, and all self served. You get an electronic fob with your order number and wait for it to buzz. That buzz indicates your food is ready! And you better run because it tastes amazing!

Pros: Good presentation, delicious, appealing decor, wifi, good location, lots of seating, wait time is minimal, fast service

Cons: Was a little dirty, high traffic flow, small dining areas, non cushioned seats at tables

Overall: I'd venture back here if I was near the strip again."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is not just for burgers! I'm a fan of chicken sandwiches and I had to try theirs. The loaded fries looked so good, I got those too. Let me say, all the food was good. I really did enjoy the chicken sandwich, but the reason for 3 stars is because the chicken to bread bun ratio was not OK. The chicken was smaller than the bun and I had to tear off the excess. Just being honest because for a $13 meal, I want a chicken breast the size of the bun."}
{"text":"Great place with friends and to have a good burger. The wait was short. Worth it if you want something fast yet close to in-n-out."}
{"text":"Vastly over rated . Cold small burger in a good bun.  I did not come here for the bun.  Way over priced,  this is not  NYC.  Cold drinks also $$$. Root beer.
Way too many good burgers around to avoid this
Place."}
{"text":"Ehhh.... I probably had my expectations way too high... but ice cream I got was sup par. They were OUT OF PEANUT BUTTER which is a serious offense in my books. The lady working was rude and acted annoyed at the world. 

Maybe I came on a bad night? 

Maybe it is just not as good as it seems."}
{"text":"Two stars for service only. The first thing I noticed upon walking in is that it is smoky and they need to clean/repair kitchen vents. The service was great.

The food was very small portions and poor quality along with overly greasy. The whole time I was thinking \"Why didn't I just go to Five Guys?\" This chain has an old trailer park feel, serves beer and plays sports on TV. So I can see some attractive features to some visitors but I'm all about the food... Feed me good food. Please don't charge me outrageous prices for AMPM quality food."}
{"text":"The food here is great! A lot of options and great taste.
The 3 stars is for the service. The cashier and food server were super rude and unresponsive to customers.

Tip: Order on the app to skip the line."}
{"text":"Service was very fast and on point..even with the line out the door. The cashiers all were attentive and very eager to serve the customers. Will definitely make this a spot to come to dine in next time."}
{"text":"It's better than I was expected. 
Good quality as you all knew already. 
Cost is little bit high then expect ion on burger but it worth it I guess. 
Team of Shake shack was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"The food is good but definitely overhyped. I got the snokeshack and the shack stack. Thought the burger would be a bit bigger but its about the size of in n out. I would love to come back and try their concretes though! 

Four stars because the customer service is awesome!"}
{"text":"One of the main reasons I stay at nyny or Monte Carlo is because of shake shack. The line and amount of staff makes this place super efficient. I'm somewhat sad that the spicy chicken burger is discontinued because it was a seasonal offering. I'll still come back. The food is out of this world."}
{"text":"For all the hype and the price you pay, the visit here wasn't worth it.  The fries are the cheap type to make and they're not that good.  You can make the same quality of fries by going to the grocery store and buy the cheap thick fries and fry them at home yourself. You'd pay the same price or less for a bigger quantity, too.  And the cheese they use on the fries was so artificial, one fry from my friend's plate was enough for me.  I thought the shake would stand out in taste, but I was wrong.  It tasted like melted ice cream.  Nothing special.   What a waste of money and calories. I should've listened to my sister...
I spent $36 on 2 strawberry shakes, 1 regular and 1 cheese fries, and 2 special Octoberfest burgers (super greasy burger that came with a patty and a sausage)."}
{"text":"Dragged my family to Shake Shack for what I thought was going to be a \"life changing\" burger experience and was left extremely disappointed...took one bite of the burger and would have rather spat it out than continue to eat. Not only did it taste terrible, but I thought I had mistakenly ordered a slider burger due to the smallness in size. The only redeeming quality were the fries, which were so tasty and the half decent black and white shake. Taking all said into consideration, it would be highly unlikely if I were to ever return."}
{"text":"All I ever hear from New Yorkers is how amazing Shake Shack is, so I had to try this place. The line was long. The menu is only located where you stand in line and not where you order. Food is pre-made sitting under heat lamps. Even the sodas were already in containers, losing their carbonation awaiting to be ordered. 

Smokeshack - I'm so glad I ordered a double because they are small greaseballs! The bacon could have been crispier. The brioche bun was a nice touch but was soaking in the burger grease. It was a good burger, not great. I would equate it to a burger at Wendy's. 

Cheese fries - the cheese was semi cold by the time I got my order. 

Seating - limited. This place is really small. 

20 minutes after dining at Shake Shack, I was siting on the toilet praying to  Jesus to make the diarrhea stop. Would I come back? No! In-N-Out wins this round hands down!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  They did screw up my meal, but were overly compensating to correct it and let me keep the mushroom burger they originally made.  

Hubby and I shared a cheese & bacon fry...loved the cheese sauce.  My Shake Stack came out quickly after the return and it was freaking amazing! Two portabello mushrooms with melted cheese in between, deep fried and added to a burger patty...special kind of lovely.  Loved the special sauce and just the whole damn visit!

Go there, it's a must!"}
{"text":"Pretty good comfort burgers. Expect a lot of flavor. Sizes are normal. But Good flavor.  Nothing spectacular with the fries. They were fine."}
{"text":"My top 5 favorite burgers goes 1. In n out 2. In n out 3. In n out 4. In n out 5. Shake shack lol shake shack will have a special place in my heart there bread is so moist and burgers taste second to in n out which is awesome. Everytime Im in vegas we stop here to eat. Just wish they had something compared to animal style fries and also the bomb dressing at in n out. But if your out of town i recommend this place if your from CA and want something different."}
{"text":"Cute place easy parking, nice upbeat atmosphere for 9pm on a Friday with teenagers with me.
Something for everyone if you are looking for burgers and fries. For all of us 3 people, burgers and shakes were under 28.00 not bad.
Less than I expected. 
I like the outdoor seating, music not overly loud inside.
Cashier answered questions we asked and she was right on. One of us had the Shack burger he said it was a little small but big on flavor. I had the chicken burger which was a treat... and we all shared the cheese fries.
Quality ingredients. More cheese would have been good..but quality on everything was great and would come back again!
The crispy fries are delicious !"}
{"text":"If I had to summarize my whole experience at Shake shack I would say.... underwhelming. The burger I was kind of small and carelessly put together. The SmokeShack I had was definitely tasty, but as soon as I saw my burger, I felt instant buyers remorse. It didn't look good and fries weren't portioned consistently, my partner had a mountain of fries and mine barely peaked over the side of the container."}
{"text":"I only ever order the chicken sandwich. And it's amazing everytime. I add ketchup and hot sauce. Yes they have hot sauce !  So it's just delicious. Their pickles have a very nice crunch to them also."}
{"text":"Wow!  Delectable juicy burger and soft bun.  Yum. Yum.  This modern fast food place does greasy spoon RIGHT-  and the crisscross cut fries were not greasy.  Super popular place, convenient location.  

Smooth and intense flavor concrete. We loved the pumpkin pie concrete - seasonal, so get it asap!!! 

We are probably going back tomorrow.  Yep.  that good.  Reasonable prices for a restaurant on the strip."}
{"text":"Pricey and not sure why. 
They serve very average hamburgers, and freezer-burned crinkly fries. The ketchup was weirdly sweet.... What's that about?! 
The iced tea also was overly brewed, like the teens that work here forgot it was supposed to have water added to it. 
Meh. Pretty much just meh. 
Pretty sure I won't need to come back.

{"text":"Shack Shack you're my right hand, you're my go too, told me everything about you, that's old bold move. I know that you're out here, and there's thing you gotta go through. Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do... As DRAKE would say LOL

Shack Shack fan in the house!!! Ever since I tried it in the East Coast, from New York, Washington DC, Chicago, and Florida. Now that they have it in Vegas and in So.Cal it's my to go to. So if you're wondering if it is the same as the East Coast, the answer is YAS!"}
{"text":"I've heard lots of buzz about this place and I never got around to going to the one on the Strip so I figured I'd try the newly opened on in Summerlin. I've always held the belief that there is really only so much you can do with ground beef on a bun, and other than seasoning it a bit differently, it's really all about the same stuff. Shake Shack is absolute proof of that.

I went there with a buddy of mine for lunch and the place seemed kind of busy. I figured I'd try their normal bill of fare and go with a single bacon cheeseburger and a peanut butter shake. I had them throw on a cheese fries to my tab also, and got a little sticker shock when I saw the total was about 18 bucks. Seriously, for a burger, shake, and fries in a chain joint. Ugh, whatever.

The food showed up at our table about 5 minutes later and the burger looked like someone sat on it...at least 3 times. It looked about a thousand times worse than anything I've seen come in a paper wrapper in a drive through at any fast food joint. It looked terrible. I regret not getting a picture of this very disappointing burger. The fries were in a paper tray and it looked like they just took a slice of American cheese and melted it on top. It looked gross and unappetizing and didn't taste much better. The shake tasted good but it was VERY rich...it was like trying to suck a stick of butter through a straw. Once it melted down, it was OK but just too heavy.

If the price had been half of what I paid, I would probably give this place a bit better rating but overall, I have to say it was VERY disappointing eating here, especially considering the price. I will absolutely not eat here again and in the future, when I'm craving a good burger, I'll go to an In-And-Out. Hell, I'd get a Big Mac and fries instead of this place. It was definitely not worth the hype at all."}
{"text":"First time there and was not impressed with it at all. The shack burger was just ok nothing special. The sauce overpowers any meat flavor and the black & white shake was again not a stand out at all.
Think In and Out gives a better burger and better value for your money."}
{"text":"After having lived in NYC for 6 years I was so excited to get a taste of NYC in AZ. While waiting in line to order however, I was disappointed to see two employees throwing food at each other back and fourth over the line. This is not acceptable. When I asked to speak with a manager the cashier told him/her my complaint but the manager never came to speak to me. I saw the manager ask some of the employees if they were throwing food and of course their answer was no. The food was as good as it was in NYC but with the excitement and rush of customers it appears more training needs to be spent on who is hired."}
{"text":"Manager is the nicest person I have met- makes sure you have a good experience! Very professional. Great food, great atmosphere. Burgers can't be beat and the cheese fries are ah-mazing."}
{"text":"Well, this is the second time we have tried Shake Shack.  Tonight we had it delivered to our home via Postmates so we could catch up on Star Wars.

I am pleased to say that the food was in fact great.  While I still believe it's a bit pricey for a burger, the meal tasted really good.  Quality meat, cheese and I really liked the bun.  Fries were good too.  Sad we didn't order a shake but maybe we will swing by after the movie tomorrow.  

Postmates and the restaurant did a good job sending enough ketchup and napkins.  Can't tell you how annoying it is when they forget that sorta stuff.  

Good job on changing our minds on your food, Shake Shack!  I do believe we will be trying your food again in the near future!!"}
{"text":"Best burgers hands down. Always taste fresh and seem to melt in your mouth. Been to shake shacks all over the country and have never been disappointed. This location is a great stop when your feet are tired of walking up and down the strip. 

I usually don't waste my time with the throwback elementary school cafeteria fries, but thought I would give them another chance with the cheese sauce. Just stick with the burgers and shakes and you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"Disappointed

My girlfriend and I came to try shake shack because the one back home in California had just opened up and still had a ridiculous long line. We said since we were out here we can try it and cross it off of list. This place wasn't busy which was perfect because the one back home would have us in like for like an hour. This place is very expensive and you have to order everything separately which makes ur bill high. We spent damn near $30 for 2 sandwiches, fries and drinks

We ordered our food took a seat and waited for some bs food. We got the chick shack with regular fries and cheese fries with drinks. The chicken sandwiches were salty. The fries tasted like the were old and the cheese fries had some funny flavored cheese sauce on them. 

I seriously doubt that I would go back to a shake shack. I know different locations taste different but we were disappointed and over the whole place."}
{"text":"I've never been to the ones on the east coast. In fact I'd never heard of this place until they put one up out front of the New York New York casino here in LV. I took my lady and my visiting niece for lunch. I enjoyed the burgers. The bun was the best part, very soft and chewy. Not too greasy or dry like some burger places. I also enjoyed the crinkle cut fries and cheese. 4 stars because of the price. Fun experience if visiting the strip."}
{"text":"I am not a huge hamburger eater and so when I crave one, it's usually one from years past from a restaurant long gone (I'm doing a good job of making myself sound so old)
So when I crave the burgers from the drive in dives of high school, this place hits it close to spot on.

The burgers are not enormous and not greasy.
The options are easy and pretty predictable but in a good way.

When I am craving a burger I will indulge on occasion especially if I am wanting some cheese fries, I have to admit the old wives tale \"once on the lips, forever on the hips\" rings thru your head while you devour these but they are yummy.

I have only had a shake here once and I chose the chocolate malt and it was an 8 out of 10...


I have grabbed a bite here a couple of times, it is out of the way for a quick grab so it seems more of a dine in place if you are shopping in the mall.
It makes it a little difficult compared to the ease of other places with drive thru or easier take out options available .  Just sayin.

Great burger and worth the wait especially if you have been shopping and want a good bite for lunch."}
{"text":"Best Quick Service Restaurant Burger hands down. How anyone can say this burger is not super flavorful I don't understand. It is perfectly seared and so flavorful. I am a burger snob and the ratio of bun to burger to sauce to fresh tomatoes and lettuce is absolutely perfect. Everything is so spot on and how a burger should be: from the soft potato bun, to flavorful seared fresh burger patty, and super fresh tomatoes and lettuce to the amazing sauce (the sauce is a bit heavy, but there is a little zing to it and it is the perfect accompaniment to the burger). This burger is everything I had hoped it would be. And the best part is that it doesn't make you feel gross after eating it like some other burgers do. The shakes are ridiculously over priced but also delicious. It is worth the wait in the line and now I understand the lines. My one suggestion would be the ability to put a cheese other than American on the burger.  I had to update my burger list after eating here though: Best burgers in AZ list: new #1) ShakeShack original, 2) Hoppdoddy good nite burger, 3) Rehab Burger Therapy (all of them), 4) Howie Burger at Chelsea Kitchen, 5) Steak and Shake original. If you know of others please let me know. :)"}
{"text":"We tried the Smoke Shack burger and the Shack Stack Burger with one side of cheese fries and one soda: $25 and change. Overpriced but food is good. 

The SmokeShack burger's pickled cherry peppers adds a nice tangy flavor to the burger. A welcomed change compared to typical bacon cheeseburgers. I like that they add a regular slice of pickle to it as well in addition to the lettuce, onions, and tomato. 

The ShackStack burger has both portabello mushrooms with a beef patty and cheese. Nothing special to be honest but still good. We probably won't come here regularly but we had been looking forward to trying it out and we're glad we finally did. 

The cheese fries are typical crinkle cut fries smothered in a bland cheese sauce. Decent but again, nothing special."}
{"text":"Loved it. Best cheese fries ever and the burger was to die for. Will def come here again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Fabulous burgers, sides and shakes. The wine was a bit pricey but I really enjoy burgers and wine! The line was long but the food was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"The burger was pretty good, the 5 star rating is for the incredibly friendly and accommodating staff. This is easily the best customer service I have had in a long while.  Shakes were delicious and I will most definitely be back next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"The hype is real. I wanted to like this place, I really did. Burgers are my all time favorite food, so it's extremely disappointing when it's not what it's made out to be. My girlfriend and I came here for lunch on a Monday around 12:30 or so. It was quite busy but the lines were moving fast. We were able to snag a table before a flash flood of people came in. 

The pager I was given for the food buzzed about 10 minutes after I ordered. I thought to myself \"Wow! This place has already impressed me\" Nope, I was wrong. I hand the person behind the counter my pager and she dumps it into a basket with a bunch of other ones. She proceeds to talk to a co-worker, when she finally turns back around she stared at me with a blank face as if I didn't just hand her my transponder. She asked if she could help me, and I'm stunned. I couldn't believe she did all that mindlessly. She takes my receipt and locates my beer and said the food will come out shortly.

15 minutes have gone by since my pager first buzzed and I'm getting quite impatient. I'm standing at the pick up counter at this point and she finally acknowledges my presence. She says \"You've been standing here for a while, what did you need?\" I tell her I'm still waiting for my food and she asks for the receipt. I tell her she took the receipt the first time and crumbled it after I got my beer. She then goes on the accuse me of lying and saying that the receipt was only for the beer. Ridiculous!!! I wish they had name tags, Jesus Christ. I recite my order and she turns around and like magic, my order appeared. 

At this point I'm fuming and don't really have an appetite. But I paid $40 and damn well need to eat it now. I ordered the Smoke Shack for me, Stack Shack for my girlfriend and the Double down fries. The burger is mediocre at best. And the double down fries are pretty plain. Just has nacho cheese drizzled over it with small chunks of bacon on it. The ShackMeister beer also sucks. 

It might just be that I came on an off day, but from what I experienced, it's all hype. Don't believe it. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere for a burger."}
{"text":"First time here a couple weeks ago and I've got to say, their menu is pretty good. Love the crinkle cut fries! I ordered a cheese dog and my boyfriend got the SmokeShack. We also got a root beer float and salted caramel shake. Everything we got was pretty good and the salted caramel shake was definitely one of a kind. The only thing is, when I was eating my hot dog there was MOLD on it! I quickly told staff and without hesitation they made me a new one, the manager came out and personally apologized. Even though I was grossed out I was amazed by their customer service. They gave me a full refund, a free fry and also a $10 credit for next time. That service was better than any service I've received!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack was pretty good.  I understand the prices here on the strip are higher but my $6 burger wsa good but the size was reallly small.  The cheese sauce was good along with the cheesy fries.  The frozen custard was good also.

If you've never had it, give it a try."}
{"text":"I wish we had a Shake Shack back in Hawaii, but until then, I got my fill in Vegas.

Located right outside of the New York New York, its hard not to miss. Although I've only gone both times around 8pm, there is ALWAYS a line, however, its never a long wait to order. Both times I got the Shack Stake and both times there were amazing. Tried to get the fried mushrooms on the side, but they don't sell it, Sad. I've tried a few of their shakes and wasn't too impressed with them. The strawberry was decent. The same as everywhere else so nothing I'd go out of my way for.  I also tried their salted peanut butter shake and that was just a mistake. So salty. I know its salted, but it was as if someone was mad and decided to get back at the customers by loading up the salt content. 

Other than that, the wait time was an average of 10-15 minutes for the food. Service was great. The place is kept clean even though they're so busy. I loved being able to sit outside with all the beautiful lights in the background."}
{"text":"Long line in Vegas but easy to order and worth it! Any kind of burger YOU WANT!!"}
{"text":"The question to be asked about Shake Shack is not \"Is it good?\" (it is) but rather \"Is it worth it?\" In my opinion, the answer to that latter question leans ever so slightly towards no. The food is delicious for sure - juicy burgers; soft, buttery buns; unique sauces; and big flavor combinations. However, the high-quality taste isn't enough to offset the $15 price tag and small portion size for me, especially since the fries and the shake I also purchased were pretty average - typical fries, a typical shake. I do plan to return, but not often, and if I do, I might opt out of fries and definitely will opt out of a shake. The burgers are what shine at Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Pricey but good. The mushroom patty burger was delicious but small. Same for their burgers. Fries were also good. Oh yea so was the hotdog. We just arrived to Vegas and the kids wanted a quick bite to eat close to our hotel. Very tasty, kids even said the burger were up their with in and out! It was good but pricey! Very nice modern decor!"}
{"text":"My family has been wanting to try this place for a long time, but something's always come up before.  So, we were finally able to for Father's Day and treat the hubs.  Overall, it was so underwhelming, especially when the reviews for the strip location are pretty decent.  Both the hubs and I got a burger on special, some cheeseburger with bacon and their ShackSauce.  We also got an order of regular fries, and an order of cheese fries.  The burgers were so small, when I was done, I could have eaten one or two more, but not at about 600 calories each!  The fries were also so blah - the fries themselves were ok flavored, crinkled cut.  But the cheese sauce fries were just so blah!  The sauce just tasted like something close to cheez whiz.  The only good thing was, since it was Father's Day, they were giving out one free custard, which our little one loved.

Overall, a very disappointing experience, and I have to say, we will not be back.  At least we can say we've been there, but I will not be recommending it.  There are lots of other good burger places around."}
{"text":"IF ZERO STARS WAS AN OPTION IT WOULD BE A ZERO STAR. let me start off with.. How rude this manager or whatever this person is. Her name is Chelsea, she discouraged us from eating here. I am lactose intolerant, she still discourages me from eating here. Denied my party of 4 DRINKS AT 1 in the fucking morning on a Saturday. What a rude ass person. Honestly don't eat here. DONT. Terrible food terrible service. Fuck that"}
{"text":"Best burger ever!!!!! Best frozen custard ever! Best shake ever!!!!! 
If you didn't get the gist of where I was headed, I loved this burger joint!!!!! I highly recommend checking this place out. The burgers were very fresh and non-greasy. It was oozing with goodness and plenty of flavor. It's easily visible that the beef is quality. The fries left me wanting more since I didn't need a napkin to wipe off excess grease or oil. The frozen custard was a happy ending to a wonderful meal. The texture was smooth and creamy. I had the flavor of the week which was the salted caramel. My fav!!!!! 
Burger lovers check this place out!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a homemade, pure rich in flavor type of burger, I would definitely say this place has it. I would recommend upgrading to a double to really enjoy the savory flavors of all the toppings! The employees and manager were super nice and attentive and made my visit worthwhile."}
{"text":"For all the excellent reviews and fanfares of Shake Shack, my family and I were not impressed. Let me clarify, the burgers and fries were good but not of the extraordinarily awesome kind we were expecting. I mean, for the same quality AND much less (half the price), we could have ordered pretty much the same thing at In-N-Out and would have been much more satisfied. 

Chick'n Shack ($6.29) - Fried chicken in a bun. The chicken was admittedly fried really well. Seemed to be average in terms of flavor. It is a small burger, though, so you'll definitely need to pair it with something else on the menu. 

Cheese Fries ($3.99) - Crinkle-cut fries appear to be their \"thing.\" Fries with a few pumps of nacho cheese. Nothing to write home about. 

Our main disappointment is with size, flavor, and price. We don't know what it is about East Coast fast food joints but In-N-Out takes it home any day."}
{"text":"I truly love Shake Shack, but I feel like this location did not do the burgers much justice! Sloppy presentation and appeared smaller than usual.

The burgers were still very good and came out fast. However, it was not worth what I had paid for. I'd rather get Shake Shack on the East Coast."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger places.  I love to have lunch out on their patio when weather permits. It smells like the Fair in a good way.  Hotdogs, burgers and beer smell in the air!!  The french fries are always fresh and hot.  I love the cheese burger with the cherry peppers, it was one of the first meals I tried.  Lately my favorite has been their crispy chicken sandwich on a bun that is so buttery good, with lettuce and sauce.  The line moves quickly and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Humid + hot af weather. Googled the distance it takes to get to Caesar Palace to NYNY, it was approx. 0.7-0.5 miles. Okay, I can walk that. 0.5 miles is no problem.

wrong.

with the crowd traffic and the humidity + heat AND no water to hydrate us along the way, yeah you can say we almost didn't make it. That would've been a story to tell. 

Shake shack is located right on the strip. No need to enter NYNY and search for it inside. The line was relatively short on a Saturday night around 10-11PM. I wanted to see the difference between shake shack burgers and in-n-out burgers. So far, in my opinion, in-n-out still has the best taste in burgers. BUT the fries at shake shack were far superior. Crunchy and didn't get that weird soggy texture like in-n-out fries. The SHAKES WERE SOOOO GOOD. Got the Chocolate cookies and cream. Def. a fan of their fries and shakes now. Lemonade was aight, it wasn't as sour as I wanted it to be but it was still great. Overall, great first time experience."}
{"text":"Really disappointed.  Very pricey for what you get!  My family of 4 got lunch there on Sunday.  My daughter got the chicken sandwich and did like that.  My husband and I both got burgers and one of them with the peppers and bacon.  We both felt liked they lacked flavor.  Very bland and patties are real small and thin for a $7 burger.  My son who would only eat the fries didn't even finish his. The fries for the most part were good however we all had a couple raw nasty ones in each of our baskets. Then the shakes...the chocolate was so overwhelming strong it wasn't good.  The black and white was good but again  pretty high priced for what you get.
Have to say - many other places with much better tasting burgers and even better prices.  I don't mind paying a bit more if the food is worth it and in my opinion - Shake Shack is not."}
{"text":"Excellent food to eat after late nite party, clubbing, drinking, gambling etc..
All the food menu delicious & yummy.
Best place to eat in Vegas baby..."}
{"text":"As soon as we got inside, there was a big line to get to the cashier. We waited about 20 mins before we got up to the front to order from the menu.  We ordered the Smokestack double, a shackstack, fries, milkshake and a soda.  The burgers itself was not to salty and the flavor combination was good.  I really enjoyed the burger.  The fries was always delicious.  I enjoy eating fries very much.  The milkshake was better then I thought."}
{"text":"Delicious, juicy burgers. Good price for the strip. Team shake shack or team in and out? Have to say this time it went to the shack 

Don't miss out on the mushroom burger! The gooey melty cheese in the middle will change your life"}
{"text":"Finally! A Shake Shack in our neck of the woods! Shake shack is an addiction! Their food never disappoints!

Our wait in line was not long at all - maybe 5 minutes which gave us enough time to figure out exactly what we wanted to order. The lady that took our order looked like she did not want to be there, slumped over on the counter almost as if it hurt to stand up! (If that was the case get her a stool!) She said hello, took the order and repeated the order all without making any eye contact, along with an uninterested attitude. 

There were a handful of empty tables, none of which were clean. They had 1 person cleaning the dining area, 5 at the registers and at least 10 in the kitchen area. It was strange to see tables not bussed with that many on staff. 

The set up of the dining room is a cluster. I think they can do better with the loose chairs next to the line, as you can't even get in between them to walk through, or even get into your seat once you find one! They have a foosball table and shuffle board table - which is nice to distract the kiddies while waiting for our food. 

We ordered: 
2 ShackBurgers (single)
1 Smoke Shack
1 Bacon Cheese Fries
1 Large Root Beer
1 Cinnamon Dulce De Leche Shake

I have never had a bad experience with their food, it has always been fresh and aesthetically pleasing. Their prices are the same across the board, not bad for a quality meal! 

Overall we enjoyed our experience tonight, and I'm sure we'll return. Hopefully the staff will develop their rhythm and get into the groove of things for a smoother operation."}
{"text":"We got the Shake Burger, Cheese Fries, and Custard.

Shake Burger: the patty was sooooo salty. Maybe this is the way New Yorkers like it? However, I did like how the ends were kind crispy. I also loved the sweet potato bun! It did become a little soggy but the sweetness was very unique!

Cheese Fries: Awesome crinkle fries with melted cheese on top. The cheese kind of tasted like those Ritz cheese dip with crackers that you ate as a snack in elementary school. I know that's super specific, but it did!!! I was expected a nacho kind of cheese. It was unexpected but I liked it!

Custard: Yeah, you've got to get this! It's a great dessert that's very rich and smooth. Perfect ending to your meal.

It's really expensive (like they all say) but I guess that's how it is in the east coast? Yes, I did compare it to In n Out and of course I love In n Out better. It's cheaper and I can't get over their secret sauce. However, Shake Shack does have its perks so I can't really compare these two totally different burger joints!"}
{"text":"Came to Shake Shack on the Vegas Strip after hearing all the raves. People yelped it was comparable to in & out burger but i would equate it more to 5 Guys Burgers. And I'm not a Five Guys fan. So having tried Bobby's burger palace burgers that would be my preference over Shake Shack."}
{"text":"The lady that took my order was so rude. The wait for the food was HORRIBLE. After we ordered it took like almost 45 min. The food was a bit cold by the time we got it. Even when the buzzer rang for the food that it was ready. We spent another 5-10 minutes waiting for it at the pick up window. This place needs to manage better and differently. I give it one star because the fries tasted delicious but that was it."}
{"text":"Good burgers, shakes & fries. Food came out pretty fast considering it was very busy. Good place to hang out with big tv screens for sports fans. Only issue I have is that the burger size was small for $8-10."}
{"text":"This place was $$$$.  I did the shack burger and was a happy camper.  My only complaint was the buns of the burger were soggy almost the moment I got the burger and became more soggy with time.  My wife's burger did the same. Maybe this is part of their style but I wasn't feeling it.  In turns into a flat pancake almost.  With all of that said I will still return and enjoy their tasty burgers."}
{"text":"Yes.... better than in n out.....

Tasty juicy burgers and fresh French fries with a delicious milkshake can make anyone a happy person 

Came here a few times and every time I wanted more food."}
{"text":"Loved the flavor of the bacon burger! Kids got cheese & plain burgers and enjoyed them. Fries are ah-mazing!! Everyone loved the shakes (mint & coffee). A bit pricey but, hey, we're in Vegas! Enjoyed the experience!"}
{"text":"Located next to Tom Urban's and \"The Park\" (a misnomer, really) on the New York-New York property, Shake Shack is a fast food burger joint offering Strip visitors a more affordable dining option. A tab for a family of four was $51. Shake Shack was super packed on a Sunday night, and Strip walkers found no cool refuge inside. Instead, temperatures inside the restaurant were sweltering. Maybe the A/C was out of order?

SHROOM BURGER ($6.99): A fried portobello mushroom with an overload of melty cheese inside. Comes with lettuce and tomato. The mushroom was kind of chewy at times. 3/5

CHEESE FRIES ($3.99): Crinkle cut fries topped with a thin cheese sauce. I think I'd like the fries better without the cheese sauce. 3.5/5

SHACK ATTACK ($4.59): Chocolate custard goodness with brownie bites thrown in the mix. Delightful. A single serving is more than enough for two people. 4/5

I think if it was cooler inside and the cashier was friendlier, I probably would have given Shake Shack four stars. Their second location in DT Summerlin has much friendlier employees (and A/C!).

Chick'n Shack - Crispy Chicken Breast with Lettuce, Pickles, Buttermilk Herb Mayo

Not one to go out of the way for a Burger, let alone to wait in line for hours during a trip to Manhattan, Danny Meyer's Shake Shack had always stood out as a sort of novelty until rapid expansion dropped two into the Las Vegas community, a recent look showing the experience to be typical Union Square Hospitality Group in terms of the smiles and service exhibited while the food itself is decent, though certainly not \"destination\" worthy in terms of quality, price or concept.

Situated in Downtown Summerlin, a location in the dining alcove nearest Red Rock Resort and Casino adjacent Wolfgang Puck, Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken and Pub 702, Shake Shack takes up a significant footprint with indoor and patio seating, the entrance bringing diners face-to-face with a big board of options and the counter with room for queuing. 

Pure Meyer in its concept, the non-GMO Buns, antibiotic-free Meats and Organic Produce all showing a passion for quality while also commanding a premium price, ordering at Shake Shack is a streamlined process with weekly Specials augmenting a list of classics plus the recently launched Chicken Sandwich, the prices really no different from Panera or other \"quick casual\" concepts with a five part order totaling just a shade under $34.

Amused by the Calorie Counts, just in case the toll on one's wallet for what is essentially fast-food delivered tableside despite a flashing pager is not enough, it bears mention that Shake Shack has actually designed their food to be \"Instagram Friendly,\" and with each Sandwich presented as if birthed from the wrapper the visual appeal is undoubtedly compelling, though first bites of the ShackStack were far less-so as the melty Mushroom completely overwhelmed an underseasoned Meat patty that really added nothing to the flavor of the Cheese, Sauce and Fungus.

More impressed by the Chick'n Shack, a brined Breast fried golden with a pleasant spice profile that outperforms Chick-fil-a from Bun-to-Bun as Pickles, Herbs and Lettuce all mingle nicely with the Bird, the rest of the afternoon focused on Shake Shack's famous Concretes and Custards, the weekly Blueberry Sweet Corn a lackluster attempt to do something Jeni's has been doing for a decade with a taste not much different from Vanilla with a spoonful of sautéed fruit drizzled over it, while both the Summerlin S'more and Desert Crunch-stellation fared better largely as a result of the Mix-Ins as the texture of the Custard was far less creamy that either CJ's or Luv-It."}
{"text":"Shake Shack delivers exceptional service and beautiful burgers that look like they have been Photoshopped. Don't worry, the burgers taste just as good as they look. 

This fast food chain has elevated their fry game by not just giving you piping hot, perfectly seasoned crinkle cut fries. They have a cheese sauce that complements the fries nicely.  I'm convinced that if you cover your napkin with the cheese, it will even taste good.   

I had the pleasure of sampling the following shakes:  chocolate, Christmas cookie, and chocolate peppermint.  As a die hard chocolate fan, I hate admitting that their Christmas cookie was superior to the chocolate shakes.

As a Las Vegas local, it can take a lot for some of us to venture to the Strip, but Shake Shack makes it all worth it."}
{"text":"In n Out has a competitor, and its called Shake Shack. 

Right on the strip, you get to people watch as you sit and munch on a hot, juicy, burger wrapped in paper with two patties, two cheese, sliced tomato, leaf lettuce, sliced onion and a great sauce - this is one fantastic burger. 

Shake Shack - one of my new favorites."}
{"text":"Solid, nostalgic burgers made with high quality ingredients at a reasonable price. The shake was made with delicious real ice cream and the building g is clean and well designed!"}
{"text":"4 stars because it's mandatory that we compare this to in-n-out and it DOES NOT beat it, sorry! 

However, I think the burger just melted in my mouth. One minute I was holding it and the next, it was gone! The fries were so delicious, and the shake was Fireeee."}
{"text":"I work across the street from a Shake Shack in NYC, I've been to 5 different Shake Shacks in NYC, I named my kid Shake Shack.  All true, except that last part.  This Vegas location also rocks.  Had the Shack Meister burger, as good and delicious as the east coast Shake Shacks.  Great location outside the NY NY casino and hotel.  Line moves fast and plenty of seats inside with flat screen TVs.   I have to admit the fries weren't half bad either as I dipped them in mayo and ketchup.  That's how we roll."}
{"text":"How many items can you name from the Shake Shack menu?  LISTEN, I'm sure I can name more...
As a born & bred NYer I'm always drawn into a Shake Shack- curiosity of the frozen creations just for each particular location!  I need that special concrete, you know;)  
I will admit I'm one of those of the cult-like followers of Shake Shack. 
No robots or iPads taking your orders here!  Well, not yet at least. 
Pleasant staff, clean facility at T-Mobile.  
All natural burgers, but no burger this evening.  Just concrete please! ;)  
Literally something for everyone.  I mean, it is that favorite 'street food'.  I usually Opt for the 'shroom burger, or burger with ketchup.  
NO! No mustard. 
Immediately received my concrete and off in pounding the non-concrete floors of t-mobile arena back into our seats for Depeche Mode."}
{"text":"Thrilled that one is now in Summerlin!  I'm from L.I. And missed this place! Make sure you save room for a custard (try jelly's last donut)!  The chicken sandwich is delicious as well and is hormone free.  I'm a fan of the Shake Shack bottles of water;)  made this a staple after a hike at nearby Red Rock Canyon."}
{"text":"Came here with high expectations but it just didn't live up. Over $40 for four of us, which is about the same as a full service restaurant. None of us were impressed with the meal. For the money, In-N-Out is a much better option."}
{"text":"Stayed at a nearby MGM resort and didn't get a chance to come here last time. Well, fortunately for me, I made it a priority to pay a visit here a few days ago.  If you are near Park Plaza or NYNY, this would be the place that would have the longest line hands down. However, it moves pretty quick and it's one of those places you order and you'll receive a buzzard while waiting. 

You'll see a board of the menu or a plastic hand held version so you know what you should get here. Pretty much most people will get the single or double patty and it comes with the cheese. We tried that and also the Mushroom burger. Let's not forget the crinkle fries and the shakes here are just as popular amongst the crowds. Oh yeah, this place closes at 2am so it's pretty much busy all day long. 

The regular burger is cooked thin and I would say medium rare. I thought it was good, but not great because I like a little char on the edges of the burger and I didn't get that. As for the fries, they reminded me like the cafeteria fries you get while in grade school. I'm sure Ore-Ida sells those in the freezer aisle as well. 

However, what won me over was the 'Shroom burger that deceivingly looks like an onion ring but when you bite into it, cheese oozes out and it was also crispy on the outside. Terrific burger with their potato bun. The shakes here are awesome, they taste just like ice cream and the lady over the counter made cookies and cream just for us. Like a secret menu kind of thing. 

Overall, food is good. The wait can be long for food (We waited 15 minutes longer than most people because we wanted unsalted fries).  The bathroom and tables were in dire need of a cleanup at 7pm. I basically had to clean a water spill at the only table I can get. They do have those wipes by the trash/ketchup condiment station in which you can clean yourself as well. 
So I probably wouldn't come back due to the wait but you can also DL their app so you can have it slightly quicker. The interior and music had this club like feel and the 4 different lemonades here are nice addition to the menu."}
{"text":"A serendipitous find =)

Ordered a burger (don't remember which one) and cheesy fries. The cheesy fries are very delicious but the cheese sauce just looks like melted cheese whiz. It gives you the 'this is gross but it tastes so good' kind of guilt trip. The burger was okay, not much to be said.

Worth stopping by and grabbing a bit if you're having the munchies =)"}
{"text":"Just as suspected shake shack has nothing on In N Out, they don't compare at all, more like 5 guys greasy overpriced little burgers. I had the one with grilled onions and bacon. Where is the bacon? The onions a slimy mess...over $6 for a few bites a rip off. Passed on the fries as I am not a fan of crinkle fries. Service was nice and the space clean. After a line out the door the previous night, we came right at opening the next day to no line but still a 20 minute wait for a single burger. Why? My husband and son each had a bite and I could not convince either to have a second, coming from two people who enjoy burgers much more then I do,  that speaks for itself. Not worth going back, but at least I tried it and can rest assured I am not missing out on a thing."}
{"text":"High quality burgers and fries. Service was pretty fast. Prices were not great, but the food was fresh and tasty. Very good."}
{"text":"Greasy food, crinkle cut fries. Seriously folks, there are so many places to get a good burger around here. What's the big deal about this place? Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The one in Vegas is as equally as good as the one in New York. I love their special sauce they put in their cheeseburgers... I believe it's spicy mustard mixed with thousand island sauce. The offer good customer service and I specially love their shake shack water and root beer. Don't forget to purchase one of their graphic T-shirts... A definite must if you have a graphic T collection."}
{"text":"I ordered their double Shack Burger and it was one of the tastiest burgers I've had. I also compared it to Bobby Flay's burger and that one is a notch below Shack Burger. Well done Shack burger....well done (pun intended)!"}
{"text":"I want to give this place more stars but it's kind of hard to. The burgers are tiny! I'm comparing this to in n out. Your  on the west side now not new york! You gotta bring your a game here! Shake shack doesn't compare to that in my opinion. 

Long lines... Vegas croud.... ehhh. The seating is nice. Good tvs.

The burger. It was okay pretty damn salty but pretty damn small.  It was good thought just not \"wait in 30 minute\" line type of good. 
 
6.5/10


The fries were better. Different type of fries those were good. I dipped those in the shake shack sauce. Not bad.

I got the salted caramel shake since it's a limited edition....ahhh not amazong!but good

{"text":"Shake Shack on the west coast!! Say what??!  

Seriously, there was a line outside the door before the opened and within 10 minutes the place was packed!!!  I ordered the Smoke Shack and it was so good and full of flavor. 

There was a bit of a mix up with my order, but it was easily fixed without issue and a big plus which I very much appreciate.  

Having tried the Shake Shack in Central Park these burgers seemed small in portion and of course since its Vegas the price is also steep."}
{"text":"First time to a Shake Shack and my whole family loved it. Cute and clean location in Kierland Commons, a very helpful and friendly staff, and really good food. The cheese fries were beyond good and the strawberry milkshake was the best I've ever had. Looking forward to going again on our next Scottsdale trip!"}
{"text":"Had to try a few things. Black and white shake, a burger, and chicken sandwich. Shake was amazing and so was the chicken sandwich. Very different from an in-n-out burger, but if one had to compare I'm more partial to in-n-out. Wonderful environment and great cheese fries. Would go again in a heartbeat, if one is left after all this eating."}
{"text":"So good! We had been anticipating this place opening...well worth the wait. Super cute atmosphere. Staff is friendly. Prices are reasonable for the quality of the food. Had a burger, fries, and create-your-own \"concrete\". Nice size portions (I hate over paying for a giant burger I could never finish! Haha). With the nice weather we opted to sit outside. Turns out the patio is dog friendly so I'm sure we will bring the canine along next time! Love!"}
{"text":"Very good hamburger. I asked for mine \"protein style\" like I Do at in and out, but I don't think they have mastered that yet. Very flavorful hamburger though... My first experience was satisfactory."}
{"text":"Yummy best burger I've had for a while!! Will be going back for sure!!!   Perfect size the fries are Delish"}
{"text":"I first had Shake Shack when my mom brought home some cold cheeseburgers from their Chicago location. They were delicious, but technically that incident doesn't count as my \"first time\" having Shake Shack, so fast forward to a couple of months later when I visited Vegas with family and friends. Immediately upon checking into my hotel, I asked where the Shake Shack was and they happily told me it was right across from our hotel! To sum it up, I pretty much had Shake Shack every day during my short vacation. Oh, and I guess I should note that I am from the West Coast, so I will be making comparisons to In N Out.

Shack Burger 
This is heaven in between two buns! From their website, 100% all-natural Angus Beef with no hormones and no antibiotics cooked medium unless otherwise requested. I opted for a single, which is your standard cheeseburger with tomato, lettuce, and Shack Sauce and was pleasantly full every time I had it! I also had it bacon ($1.55) but I prefer the cheeseburger without it! The burgers aren't cheap though at $5.19 for a single and a whopping $7.99 for a double - both more expensive than an In N Out meal. A tough one, but I prefer Shake Shack Burgers over In N Out.

Fries
I love crinkle cut fries simply because they are reminiscent of my childhood hot lunches. Shake Shack fries, however, are definitely not your standard childhood lunch fries! These are perfectly crispy, golden, morsels of piping hot potatoes with a slight crunch with every bite. $2.95 will get you a nice tray of them! I also had them with cheese aka cheese fries, but I prefer them plain. Shake Shack fries over In N Out fries any day!

Frozen Custard
I read somewhere that Shake Shack was known for their custards, since I guess custards are more of an East Coast thing? I don't know. All I know is that the shakes at Shake Shack are pretty darn delicious! I had the standard vanilla and strawberry, which were good, but if you want that extra kick of sugar, definitely try the caramel because it was literally my favorite one out of the three I tried! Shake Shack shakes over In N Out shakes, ONLY because they have a caramel flavor.

Floats
My sister opted for all three floats (not all at the same time, of course!) and my favorite was the root beer as I found that the Purple Cow (grape flavored soda) and Creamsicle (orange flavored soda) tasted too artificial. Unfortunately, I didn't think this was a stand out item as I found it had too much soda and not enough custard! In N Out over Shake Shack floats, even though In N Out only has 1 float and it's on the secret menu.

Things I wish I tried
I wish I had tried other things on the menu like the Concretes, the Beer Floats, and of course the wine, but my time and belly wouldn't allow it.

For reference, 7 people each ordering a \"meal\" (burger, fries, shake) was close to $100. 7 people ordering a meal at In N out will be around $40, which is obviously a fraction of the price! Shake Shack, I wish you had a location in SF, however, your prices are just too much for me. I will be visiting whenever I go to Vegas, though!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but it's pretty pricey. I paid $15 for a small soda, small fries, and a small burger. I would not come here all the time. You could go to so many other burger places!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about the burgers. They weren't bad but they didn't blow my taste buds out the water! I can get the same satisfaction, if not a little more, for half the price at other local burger joints! Needless to say that will be my one and only visit!"}
{"text":"Best burger around!  I'm from the west coast and this place is much better than in n out.  Tasty patty, soft bun, and really good shakes and frozen desserts.  I will probably come here every time I'm in Vegas.  The only weird thing is the way their ordering system works.  The buzzer shouldn't go off unless the food is ready to be picked up.  My buzzer went off to go to the counter and get my food but I still had to stand and wait for a few minutes; it didn't make sense but once I tasted my food I didn't care anymore.  Better ingredients, lots of seating, and of course, very yummy burgers!"}
{"text":"New Shake Shack experience for me was the Crispy Chicken Sandwich! The chicken is so delicious, so crispy, and so flavorful. The only downside is how small it is. Regardless, I still love Shake Shack and the cheesy fries with the krinkle cut is the best."}
{"text":"UPDATE: after getting assistance from corporate, I decided to try Shake Shack Summerlin again. The cashier seemed a bit unhappy, but I'll chalk that up to being busy. Also, she might have been new, because she seemed a bit confused. All good though! I received my food quickly (with everything in it), and it was SO GOOD. I'm very happy with my second experience!

Also, I got a Poochini for my pup; it was so cute, and my pup loved it! It has custard, peanut butter, and a Shake Shack biscuit. 

I'm so bummed. I love Shake Shack a ton. BUT, the last time I went (this past Sunday), they forgot to put my bacon cheese fries in the bag (app order). Things happen, so okay. I decided to call because that's $5, and I wanted my fries. I left a message with the 'manager' (just an answering machine), and the prompt said they would call me within 24 hours. I never got a call. 

The food was great (what I got of it), but I'm really disappointed in their customer service on the manager's end. I'm not sure if I'll go back to this location, just because I'm irked the wrong way by the lack of call. Again, super bummed. 

Picture of my dog with the Shake Shack water bowl (the staff was very friendly and helpful! Thanks for that)"}
{"text":"This shake shack is awesome! I tried the one in Washington DC and didn't like it but gave it another chance here in Vegas.

You HAVE TO get the Shack Stack with the beef and mushroom! It is UNFORGETTABLE. So cheesy and warm and satisfying. The is also on the sweet side kind of like those Hawaiian rolls. You can skip the fries, they're average. I ordered the biggest order with the cheese and bacon and regretted my decision.

I love the vanilla shake! So creamy and deliciousssss. The frozen custard was just okay and so was the root beer float."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place opening up so last night we finally went and gave it a try. Boy were we ever disappointed. First the price.. single shake cheeseburger, chicken shake sandwich an order of cheese fries, and 2 shakes strawberry and salted caramel. total = $28.00.  Next.. taste..ordinary at best. The chicken sandwich which is deep fried had a slight \" the oil needs to be changed taste\" and was not golden brown..very dark brown (old oil) and the herb mayo that is supposed to be on the sandwich.. well if it was there was  a tiny dot of it. cheeseburger was nothing special again where's the shake sauce (still in the bottle I guess). cheese fries were a tiny portion with an even tinier cup of cheese that was almost to thick to pour over fries, it came out in clumps. the shakes were excellent, however a bit pricey. all in all I think I will stick with Lenny's on central ave. or Habit Burger."}
{"text":"Love the food here as usual.

However, their restroom is not wheelchair nor stroller friendly. A dining table is blocking the restroom entrance, it's very hard for person with wheelchair or strollers get into the restroom.

I visited earlier today with my son in his stroller, I had to move the chair blocking the restroom entrance and one of their employees were just standing there (about a feet from me) and watching me moving their chair :) 

The changing station in the restroom was kinda dirty. 2 used plastic cups were placing right there, and I notice the employee had just \"cleaned\" the restroom and filled up the paper towels like a minute ago.

Will not come here again if I have my baby with me in Vegas."}
{"text":"If you want a place with great costumer service, this place is NOT it!! What was the point of creating a mobile order app if I was still going to have to wait 30 mins for my food? Let alone after receiving not one but TWO text messages saying my food was ready?! Also, people who were waiting in line and did not order yet received their food before I did?! What's even worse was when I asked an employee if my food was ready, she told me with a very rude attitude that my food is almost ready. 10mins later, I asked her again & she said \"mam, I already told you, your food would be coming out soon.\" 

Let's just say their food was good, but it definitely WAS NOT WORTH THE WAIT OR THE RUDE COSTUMER SERVICE!"}
{"text":"The SmokeShack Burger and the Shackmeister Dog were pretty good. The special Roadhouse Burger was awful. It was supposed to be topped with carmelized onions with bacon mixed in. Instead it had a cold, mildly onion tasting goop on top and no sign of any bacon. Need to turn the music down as well."}
{"text":"Meh I don't understand the hype. First thing we decided to do in Vegas was to eat shake shack again. This time I ordered the cheese crinkle fries along with the shroom burger ($11 total). Shroom burger was amazing as expected and will remain the only thing I'll ever eat from here. 

I don't understand what's so great about the cheese crinkle fries.. It was literally just like fries with nacho cheese on top. Definitely not worth the money. 

My BF got the roadside burger which was like a double cheeseburger with grilled onions. It sounded and looked good BUT he didn't enjoy it. He said if he were to get In N Out instead, he would have enjoyed that more. Ha ha I agree! 

Honestly... These burgers are mediocre and lack so much in flavor. They could do better.

Another downside about this place.. It's always packed and it's difficult finding seats indoors. Outdoor seating is available but wtheck I need air conditioning too man."}
{"text":"We've never been to a shake shack, and probably won't come back. 
The lady taking orders was biting her fingernails and chewing on them while we ordered, and she had rotten teeth. Very unappealing. 
The OWNER was standing behind the counter talking about how her new baby won't wear diapers and will be potty trained early... She's also having a baby shower right now, in the restaurant. 

$31 for 1 shake, 1 large soda, 1 bacon cheese fry, 1 regular fry, 1 chicken sandwich and 1 bacon burger. 

My chicken sandwich was sooooo fried. 
The cheese on the cheese fries is goopy. 
Just not a fan. 
Husband likes his peanut butter shake."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Shake Shack in Vegas to see what all the hype was about and it was definitely worth the trip. We split a Shackburger and a Smokeshack. Both of the burgers were quite good especially considering it's a fast food establishment. The next time I'm around a Shake Shack I will be stopping by for some burgers and frozen custard."}
{"text":"If I must eat fast food, it can only happen on my cheat day. If I must eat fast food, it has to be from Shake Shack. I've been to their locations in New York and Boston - lines are always long but move quickly. And if you only want a concrete, shake or drinks - use the C line which is almost always empty.

I know most people would complain about the price. $5-9 for a burger? Why not? It's antibiotic and hormone-free Angus beef. They use quality ingredients. I personally don't care paying more for better quality ingredients. 

The process is simple. Fall in line. Decide what you want so, when you get to the front of the line, you're not THAT person holding up the line. Place your order. Pay. Get your vibrator. Find a table - sometimes you have to share a table and that is normal so, learn to share and be social. Pick up your food when you feel your vibrator go off. Enjoy.

My favorite burger is the Shake Stack which has a beef patty, lettuce, crisp-fried portobello mushroom, melted muenster cheese and ShackSauce...I have to get mine without tomatoes. Soooo tasty, warm and the cheese just oozes out. Mmmm...so yummy! I prefer the regular crinkle fries over the cheese fries. The cheese fries don't excite me. For my drink, I get white wine/ black and white shake/ coffee fair shake."}
{"text":"We came here craving some ice cream. It was good ice cream. A bit over priced if you ask me but what isn't on the Vegas strip. I got the chocolate peanut butter concrete and I wish I had the shake. The concrete was super tiny. I also had a Chicago dawg. Great bun, tasted yummy... Espensive... But all around this is a decent place to get burgers and shakes!"}
{"text":"This is NOT shake shack quality food. Terrible and sloppy service as well. Had to wait forever to get served and when we did get the food. The burgers were greasy, patties were burnt, frozen custards were bad as well. This is the worst shake shack ever. I hope I don't fall sick!"}
{"text":"At last, I finally made it to Shake Shack! So much has been made about this place, so it was time to give it a try! I decided to dine at the location in Scottsdale at Kirkland. The location was hidden in the middle of the complex and parking access was difficult. Once inside, the set up reminded me of a rip off of Hopdoddy, or maybe Hopdoddy is the rip off of Shake Shack?!? The menu on the wall was complicated to read and found myself lost on what to order. Finally after seeing a small photo of a double bacon cheese burger in the corner, I decided that was what I was in the mood for. The burger overall was very good, well cooked and flavorful! But............ despite the taste, nothing about he Burger stood out that made it different than what I would get at a Freddie's Steakburger, Culvers, Five Guys or Hopdoddy. Maybe I have it wrong here and Shake Shake is the \"original\" and all the place listed prior are the \"posers.\" Either way I couldn't tell the difference from what made Shake Shack better than the rest of the burger places I listed . I wouldn't say it's over rated, but it is over priced compared to other burger restaurants. I would recommend you go and decide for yourself, just be mindful it's nothing different or special than you get at just about any other burger place."}
{"text":"Bit over priced but it is a resturant on Las Vegas Blvd. Eat outside and have a view of the las vegas blvd foot traffic. Milkshake not worth it for $7"}
{"text":"Well.  This foodie's dreams came true finally.  I got to try a couple places that have been on my list for awhile to try.

Shake Shack in New York New York was amazing.  While we visited on a Sunday evening it was packed  (but would you expect anything less for Vegas?)  My friend had been talking about a 'Shroom burger all day.  So of course, that is what I had to try.  

When i got to the register to place my order - my cashier was amazing.  She asked if I had Shake Shack before - which I hadn't.   She suggested I get fries and a shake as well.  Which - I had been planning.  

That 'shroom burger was - AMAZING.  I am not a huge burger gal - but I could eat that daily.  It was THAT good.  Add to that burger - fries and a peanut butter milkshake?  Best meal ever.  

Shake Shack you have a new fan.  I can't wait till I visit another city that you are in.  But please - come to Pittsburgh.  We would love you here!"}
{"text":"I brought several people from the convention and I was attending and they were very quick the service was great the people were at excellent to work with the pricing was good and the food was delicious"}
{"text":"so glad I do not have to go across the country for some Shake Shack. Definitely tastes just as good as the ones in NY and not as bad of a wait. The soft burger buns are what is best about the burgers to me. This is a great addition to the NY NY hotel."}
{"text":"First time trying Shake Shack on the Strip. Located right by New York New York. Very spacious/clean interior and has a very appealing design to it as well.

Decided to try a shake burger (cheeseburger), crinkle fries, and a black and white shake. Maybe it's because I chose the wrong thing to order, but the burger itself didn't amaze me at all. It just tasted like a plain ol' cheeseburger, nothing too special about it. The crinkle fries were good dipped in mayo/ketchup. I personally don't like shakes/milkshakes of any kind because I feel they're too heavy, but the shake I got was surprisingly really good and not too sweet. It's easier to drink compared to In N Out shakes.

Nothing here that would keep me coming back. $5-9 for a burger? I'd rather stick to In-N-Out. It's still forever #1 in terms of flavor and price!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack is a decent burger place located outside of New York New York. It's a classic good burger; I can't really say anything bad, but there's nothing special about it either. I got the shackburger which is a regular cheeseburger. If I had to choose between in&out and shake shack, I would probably choose in&out. The buns at in&out are nicely toasted where as Shake shacks buns are soft. I guess it's preference. The shakes are amazing! I sampled my friends and all of them were thick, creamy, and just great. I also tried the cheese fries, which was also pretty good as well. They were crinkled cut fries with artificial tasting nacho cheese melted all over. Overall, it was a decent meal and the environment is cool too! We got to watch the games a giant screen while enjoying burgers"}
{"text":"went today and was told no burgers available since they ran out meat  very disappointed what is the reason to stand in line for hot dogs !!"}
{"text":"What a great burger. So Incredible this was my wish list meal for my birthday. So yummy. the patty was a perfect portion and cooked just right, the buns were awesome, the veggies all in appetizing shape, and the sauce divine. I also munched on the crinkle fries, which at other places I am not a fan of, but shake shack does them justice."}
{"text":"Review from Tripadvisor posting:
-----------------------------------------------
My first meal off the plane HAD to be this place. I've been waiting to eat at this place again since I first tried to in LA earlier this year and the line was already at the door despite it being 4pm. 

The menu is right in front of you so you can look at it and decide all you want while you're waiting in line up once you're at the counter, the menu board is way behind you so you'll have to know your orders off the top of your head. 

As much as I loved Shake Shack on my first experience, I forgot how pricey this place could get. I got a full meal of cheese fries, shack stack burger and chocolate cookies and cream shake which cost me over 20USD; compared to In-N-Out lovers, this place is definitely a lot pricier. 

With the long line means that the wait time is equally as long for your food and overall, I was actually pretty disappointed on this second experience. 

The shack stack burger has a deep fried mushroom and on my first experience came with a \"caution-hot\" sticker since the mushroom will ooze out with juices when you bite into it but the disappointing thing about this one was that firstly, I didn't get a sticker and most importantly, the mushroom was not pipping hot! 

The cheese fries were too salty for my liking and perhaps I'd suggest getting just the fries itself as the cheese cools down and hardens quite quickly. 

So unfortunately the they didn't have the mint cookies and cream shake I tried last time since it was a seasonal thing so I tried another seasonal special which was the chocolate cookies and cream. I'm generally not a fan of chocolate ice cream but I'd say this was the best part of the meal and definitely a very good way to beat the Vegas heat!

Guess I'll have to come back here again cause...third time's the charm right?"}
{"text":"I had the Chick n' Shack and it was delicious! My husband had the Bacon and cheddar burger and said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had! The fries weren't anything to write home about, but I don't really care for crinkle cut fries."}
{"text":"The saddest awesomeness thing happened here .... I came to vegas alone and I told the cashier named Jarde that my bday was comming up in a couple of minutes she was super nice I kid you not she went to the back and gave me a free Ice cream ... Dude this is amazing costumer service! Give this chick a medal or something   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Solid burger joint. My family felt it was on the same level as In n Out. The service was great. The burger was very good. The fries and shakes were also good. No complaints. Definitely recommend it if you're in the area and have never tried this place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger places! Fries are always hot and the shakes are always cold. Chill spot to watch a baseball game. Super friendly staff too - Victor went the extra mile."}
{"text":"I love this Shake Shack.  Unlike the sister ones in NYC you can pretty much get a table.  Is it because there's plenty of both indoor & outdoor seating here in the Nevada desert?

Same great menu offering burgers and dogs and their great frozen kustard which really is a softee.   Great fries.  They also offer shakes, beer and wine.

It's so appropriate that this Shake Shack is located at New York New York hotel & casino.   Located outside on the Strip.  

If only there were a Shake Shack in San Francisco."}
{"text":"Shake shack is good but pricey!  The burger is already $5-6 then you have to order fries separate.  Plus there is no ranch just seem weird mayo."}
{"text":"Those crinkle cut fries... Wow.  I can't think of any fries i've had at a burger chain as good as Shake Shack.

Pretty good burger.  Premium pricing, and good quality.  I had the double shack burger, which is their standard double cheeseburger.  Loved the char on the meat, which is hard to do on a thin burger patty without overcooking it.  A bit small, but overall solid burger.

I dont understand the in n out comparison, since its comparing a premium burger to fast food.  For a standard double cheeseburger, you still cant beat an in n out double double!"}
{"text":"I sort of want to give this place a 4 star, but since this was my first time, I'm reserving my opinion until I try it again (which I will).  This is the Shake Shack attached to the NYNY hotel/casino.  I was there during the Golden Knights playoffs (which I hadn't even known about) and omg, this place was insanely busy.  Swarms of people in and out!  And being right near TMobile arena where the game was held, you can imagine how crazy it was in there!  But hey, that's Vegas!  

Anyway, after surviving the huge onslaught of people, I finally got a cheeseburger and fries.  Most burgers these days are pretty big, so I assumed (wrongly) that it would be fine to share with my guest who was with me.  Nope!  This is a small burger, so be forewarned if you want something that's a normal size, this one is small..  It also ain't cheap.  But I guess it is what it is these days, esp. on the strip.

The crinkle cut fries were good, too.    

The good news is that I really liked this burger.  I wasn't too thrilled with the big piece of lettuce they put on it, but it's the meat on the burger itself that I really liked, probably better than any other fast food burger I've tried and I've tried a lot.  The bun was cold but that may just have been due to the huge rush and crowd of people in there.  Who knows?  That was a crazy location!  

I also tried their frozen custard.  Never having had it before, I didn't know what to expect.  My guest has had it  numerous other places (out of state), and says this was  just okay, she's had better. A good frozen custard should have a more \"eggy\" flavor, which this didn't have. (in other words, it should actually taste like custard that's been frozen).   This tasted to me like very high quality homemade vanilla ice cream, which certainly isn't a bad thing!  I enjoyed it, but probably wouldn't get it again.

This Shake Shack has an indoor and outdoor seating area.  We ate outside because inside was a madhouse!  We ate at around 4pm and it was still fairly hot outside (and this wasn't even summer yet!).  Soooo, not sure how appealing the outdoor area will be once summer really kicks in.

I definitely am going to try another of their burgers at a different location in town, just to see how it goes.  But I may have to order two to get a decent amount of food, cuz these are just too small for my tastes!  (and I'm not a big eater!).  Shake Shack, make your wonderful burgers bigger!  I'm glad I tried this place, always fun to try new burger joints! For as crazy as the crowd in there was, the service proceeded fairly smoothly.  Hats off to the staff in there, they keep it moving!"}
{"text":"First timer.  Smoke Shack is yummy. Single is the perfect size, especially if you get the cheese fries. (Which I did) Super fresh and not overly greasy tasting like In n Out, which I am a huge fan of. I gave it 4 stars only because of the price. Come early, I was here 15 minutes before they opened and the place was packed by the time I left."}
{"text":"Food is \"good\". But the price for what you get is not worth it.  It really surprised me they do not offer grilled onions.....it's a burger joint come on???  You can get just as good if not better at In n Out and some other great burger places.     I got a single cheeseburger, fries with cheese and a shake and it was over $15.  Oh and if you want whip cream on your shake it is extra.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"This is such an over priced establishment it's insane how this is a chain. 
In terms of price no way is it in the right ballpark, the burgers were super small and buying everything separate really sucks because you end up spending way more than with a combo.
Service sucked the employees weren't very friendly or caring about a question I asked regarding the food. The manager seemed to be friendly when she was doing refills though.
I will say the burger was pretty decent, I was just shocked by how small it was, especially for 6$. The shakes were absolutely abysmal. If I knew that the red velvet shake was just a strawberry shake with red velvet cake chunks in it I probably would've passed, but I guess you have to learn the hard way. 
This place is just a combination of Smash Burger and Steak n Shake just double the price for not really adding anything new or exciting into the mix. 
Really disappointed I didn't go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is the third location with two of the shake shake burgers on the strip. I believe a fourth one just opened in Henderson. This place is far from the strip so you don't see much tourists here and there's hardly a line. They open at 11 am and it is near the edge of the complex beside the California pizza kitchen.

I always get the shroom burger. Mainly because the burger isn't too special compared to other burger joint and the shroom burger stands out and this is the only place I get it.

The shakes here are good and thick but for 5$ for such a small amount... that's a negative. I'd rather go to in and out for a similar concoction.

It's cute they have stuff for dogs and alcoholic beverages and they have tons of tv and good a/c but honestly I only come here when people visit us here."}
{"text":"First visit there- we went at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. Ok food and service. Not a good value - I'd rather eat at Zinburger or In and Out Burger. Probably a lot of the price is paying for the uptown plaza real estate. The camelshack concrete dessert was tasty."}
{"text":"Shake Shack has excellent burgers, hotdogs, chicken sandwiches, crinkle fries, and of course amazing shakes. For dessert or a \"shopping break,\" they have Concretes with mix-ins, and Frozen Custard cups or cones. Every location has their own special, but at this location the specialty Concrete is the \"Kierland Common.\" It is fantastic, with all of the ingredients of S'mores. They also have their own brand of draft beer, \"ale,\" & their own brand of red or white wine. The restaurant is immaculately clean with an open view of the kitchen behind the counter, where you place your order and receive a pager. The service is very efficient, and I didn't have to wait long at all; I was there between lunch and dinner times, however. The seating area outside is a dog friendly area, and also has a ping pong table. (See photo.) They even offer 2 options on the menu for dogs. Another thing that sets them apart is that a friendly staff member, cleaning the tables with sanitized, disposable towelettes (See photo.), checks to see if everything is to your liking or if, for example, you would like a water (which I recommend with the shakes).  
Excellent Food, Service & Staff
Cleanliness: A+ rating

Casual: very
Dog Friendly: yes
Parking: limited (however, parking lot nearby)
Outdoor Area: great view, great for people watching"}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Went back to our hotel and realized we were missing a burger. If we paid nearly $50 for our order we expect to be given the correct order. Very unhappy."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment. $24 for 2 tiny, greasy, tasteless burgers, frozen fries and a fake strawberry shake! Anyone with half a brain will go to In N Out or Culvers for a much higher sh quality meal at a fraction of the price. The hype will fade very soon. Shake Shack should be named S#%* Shack."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. Super yummy!
At first, I thought \"I'm here in Scottsdale, why do I want to go to a burger joint?\"  And then I saw the picture of the cheesy fries. 
Wow. I am so glad I didn't skip over this gem. I got the crispy chicken burger and cheesy fries. Amazing fries with cheese sauce. The chicken was super crispy and moist, the pickles are amazing, as is the buttermilk mayo. 
Must come."}
{"text":"Second time I've had they're food and very good. With three us eating there, we had Shake Burger, Smoke Shack, Shack Stack, fries, cheese fries, and Mud Pie shake. All burgers were excellent but the fries, with the cheese, really didn't need it. Shake was really good and another high recommendation. A bit expensive but with the experience."}
{"text":"Food was good but WAAAYYYY overpriced for the portion size. Had the chicken sandwich which was excellent but tiny. Half the size of a child fil a. It was almost $9 without fries. Also had the burger with the beef and mushroom patty which was ok but also tiny. It was $9+. Again fries are extra. The two sandwiches, 1 order of fries, and 2 sodas were $28. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! We ordered the portobello mushroom burger, the smoke shack, reg/ cheese fries, and a strawberry mint lemonade. Line can get pretty long, but they make the food fairly quick. The portobello was so bomb! It was perfectly fried and had melted cheesy on the inside. The lemonade was also good! It was just the right ratio of sweet and sour. Only down side would probable be the cheese fries because they were a tad basic. Wish they had a location in SF!"}
{"text":"Yummy! This place has amazing burgers in Las Vegas! 

We were looking forward to trying something different while visiting our trip to Vegas. We are tired of eating the same burger joints in our area such as In N Out and The Habit. Since we stayed nearby at New York New York Hotel, we decided to come here for dinner time. There was a long line when we enter, but the line moved quickly. It was very crowded when we dine in. There was plenty of seats outside if you can't find a table inside. 

Shake Shack is located downstairs outside of The Strip where T Mobile Arena is. It was a close walk. They have a few menu to choose from. 

{Foods}
SmokeShack
Shack Stack
ShackBurger
Fries
Double Down Fries

The burger tasted good and freshly made. It is interesting that they serve it with potato bun. You won't find anywhere else for that. Pretty decent price for what you pay for. I think it is better than In N Out in my opinion.

{Service}
The cashier lady was patience. They give you the buzzer when your food is ready. 

I haven't had their frozen custard yet, but will try it out next time for sure."}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich was yum yum yum! Oh my goodness, it blew away my expectations. I loved the crunch on the outside, the tenderness on the  inside, and the pickles were like icing on a cake. Ooh so good, I'm hungry just thinking about it. That piece of art is my favorite thing on the menu.

The regular burger was good, but too salty (I love salt too) and the crinkle fries were crispy and non greasy. 

Good service and I appreciated the manager coming by to take our trays away from the table, thank you!

Lots of seating, open areas, bright, and a good experience. We came in late November on a weekday and there was no line, yes!"}
{"text":"There has always been a battle between In & Out + Shake Shack-- but let's just say, it's a tie (well, IMO).

This place is located next to the Chocolate Bar in NYNY, facing the strip.

I ended up with the Shake Burger (or something like that), which had this amazing fried portobello mushroom with this oozy-goozy cheese melting out of the burger; however, the patty was meh. But the entire burger was still heaven in your mouth, hashtag foodgasm. I also had the cheese fries, which were amazingly cheesy, similar to the nacho cheese and way better than animal style fries (sorry , In & Out)!

Overall, I really enjoyed Shake Shack. I really enjoyed the fried portebello mushroom with the cheese oozing out, which was the game changer in the burger game. It's definitely not Bachi Burger, but this place is somewhat a bang-for-your buck. Will I return? You betcha!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Never a bad thing to say. I had the smoke shack burger today it's amazing. My two year old had the fries"}
{"text":"So yummy and customer service is excellent, place very clean definitely returning to have more of these yummy burgers!!!!"}
{"text":"Took a taxi up the street just so I could make it in 5 minutes before closing. The quality of the food was just like I would get mid day. Crispy fries, crunchy chicken sandwich's. And even though they were closing down the service was normal and did not seemed rushed."}
{"text":"This is my first visit here. Lisa was amazing and helped us out. She gave us recommendations and was very patient with us newbies! She was also really nice to my son and didn't make us feel like we were taking too long. Thank you Lisa for a great visit!!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went out to a concert and decided to stop and eat beforehand. We ended up at Shake Shack , the line was really quick to get through, the employee who took my order was really nice. We waited about 10 minutes for our food. It looked really delicious when we received. (We got the Shake Burger, cheese fries and the draught rootbeer). The Burger was beyond disgusting. The taste was horrible. The \"sauce\" they have on the burger was a horrible orange looking color and it tasted like it was spoiled. (The same taste you get in the back of your throat when you have a cold). We would never eat here again. It was a waste of $5 and the burger was small. It did not live up to the expectations of In and Out."}
{"text":"My friends that had lived in NYC for a bit said I HAD to visit Shake Shake while in Vegas and were so kind as to order me a meal while I snuck away from a convention for a quick lunch.  Liked it so much I returned another night and brought other convention goers from Hawaii that had never heard of the joint.  AHHHH!  So good!  I tried the cheeseburger on day #1, which was fatty, juicy, and delicious.  Bread was on the sweet side.  Crinkle fries were fun, although I'm not as into the cheesy ones.  Shakes were crazy delicious.  

Day #2 I opted for the mushroom burger (well just a mushroom, no meat).  I like grilled portabella, not so much deep fried but if you like fried things and are a veggie lover you would probably enjoy it.  Hitting this place after a night of drinking would probably be a perfect Vegas nightcap."}
{"text":"We loved everything! Got a burger shack, hubby got a smoke shack, chicken shack regular crinkle fries. All were amazing! Drinks-the mango lemonade  and for dessert we got a strawberry milk shake and camel custard it was Custard with caramel sauce and banana bits. The banana flavor tasted artificial not fresh just an f.y.i. My number didn't go off (they give you a number like at PPP) so they came to find us and gave us an extra order of fries for free! Overall experience great."}
{"text":"My favorite fast food restaurant!!!! And the view is stunning! Definitely going back, the burgers are to die for!"}
{"text":"Tried this on my last trip to Las Vegas. I must say I have a biased to in and out burgers. With that being said I was very impressed with the overall sandwich and shake. I think the thing I enjoy the most about the hamburger was the bun. The fries also are more of a type that I prefer.

I know this is Las Vegas so there is a little bit of a benefit of the doubt but service isn't as prompt or as professional as  in and out.  In addition, cleanliness was lacking throughout the entire facility. The dining room was a wreck as was the kitchen where you could look back.

I give bun quality to them shake shack over in and out and that is it. Other than that overall value for dollar, taste, cleanliness, promptness to guest and overall customer service I give to in and out."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Shake Shack since I was in New York and I was surprised when I saw a location in Vegas when I was in town. My girlfriends really wanted to eat there so we went for lunch. 

I ordered the Shack Burger, cheese fries, and a Shack Attack concrete. My meal was delicious. The burger tasted very fresh. I loved the concrete best. The cheese fries were pretty good too but I probably wouldn't order again. They were great to share though."}
{"text":"MMmMM delicious! I can't say that this place is better than In n Out or vice versa but I enjoyed the food here! The Shackburger was our favorite. It was juicy and had a nice simple flavor to it. We also enjoyed the 'Shroom burger---something for the non-meat eaters! It was good bout I could not eat the whole thing by myself. It is a bit on the greasy side (it's fried?). Then crinkle cut fries with cheese. I'd order the fries without the cheese since it's just this cheap quality Velveeta-like. We also had the seasonal peppermint chocolate shake. It was okay.

For lunchtime on a Friday, there was a line....but it was pretty quick. Maybe 20 mins to order than another 5-10 mins for food to come out. I wish there was one closer to me because I want a shackburger now."}
{"text":"Shake shack really is bomb dot com! Everyone has been raving about this place because they had it in New York, and after trying it, I see why! The burgers are really good, with their special sauce. The patty tastes fresh. The buns are sweet buns. It's just a perfect concoction of deliciousness. I would say I like this better than In-n-Out. Only thing is, maybe I was really hungry because I wanted another one right after having my first burger. But I held back and ate crinkle fries instead. I was full in the end but I will want to try the Shroom burger next time. Shakes are also good by the way! 

Try this if you come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"My friends in the East Coast always rave about how awesome this place is, and now I can too! For starters, Shake Shack is its own unique burger joint. Despite the constant comparisons to In-N-Out, I can say after trying it today that they are nothing alike. So let's put an end to this East Coast/West Coast rivalry nonsense. :)

Okay, back to the burgers. Whenever I order a burger, I usually look for an option with sautéed mushrooms if one is available. I saw they had a \"Shroom patty\" and just assumed I could order my Shackburger with mushrooms. The cashier, however, informed me that the mushrooms only came in the form of the \"Shroom patty\". Um, okay. I'll pass on the mushrooms.

Despite the initial confusion, I ended up really enjoying my burger. Subbing regular burger buns for soft, buttered potato buns is just genius! The meat patty was juicy, flavorful, and perfectly topped with melted cheese, fresh lettuce and tomatoes, and pickles. I really liked the pickles because they aren't the precut, dill chips most burger joints use. They are actual, freshly cut dill pickles! The fries are good as well, especially if you're a fan of the crinkle-cut.

I will, however, attest to the overly high prices. You can easily find yourself spending about $20 on two burgers and fries here. Hubby also commented on the rather small size of the burgers. He isn't a proponent of large portions either. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if I'm in the Summerlin area, I will definitely make a Shake Shack stop.

P.S. Ask for a side of ShackSauce for your fries. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and taste just as great as the locations in NYC! I had their portobello mushroom burger which tasted so so great! Huge huge menu to choose from. They have hot dogs, burgers, shakes, fries, and sooo much more! Honestly, I would definitely choose this over In n Out any day however, it's not really comparable either. Shake Shack is still on the pricier end, while at In n Out for $6 you can get a drink, fries, and burger."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this since I saw it on Million Dollar Listing: New York! We got a burger, a hot dog, the fries and the shack of the week. The burger and hot dog portions were smaller than expected, but both cooked very well. Usually I'm not a big fan of the caterpillar fries, but they were pretty good. Especially like the shack it was was chocolate cake mix, probably the highlight of the visit. I'm surprised they don't have more shake shacks around, this was a really nice experience. Food wasn't too greasy or overpowering. Usually when you enjoy a meal like this you want to take a nap afterwards, yet this didn't give that appeal. All in all great experience, can't wait to try it again when I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great prices for the quality you get. The buns here are to die for. Melt in your mouth. Fresh, quality ingredients at a decent price (especially for the strip). Also got a black and white shake - the chocolate was very rich but not overpowering. Fries were fresh and love their house sauce and cheese sauce. Yum!!! Will be back next time !"}
{"text":"Disappointment but still yummy.  Just not having it in New York.  I think that the burger was kind of smaller this New York too.  We came after a basketball game and it was kind of late so maybe I didn't give them a fair chance.  I have to come when I am not tired and hungry.  The water is not filtered so I could taste the nasty faucet water. 
The place was super clean and service is super fast.  I just had the taste for ny and I didn't get the memory of it."}
{"text":"Great cheeseburger and delicious carmel shake. We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the beef.  Burger and condiments were fresh and seasoned perfectly."}
{"text":"Very good lean clean tasting burger... probably the best tasting but it's really small and u have to buy fries and drink seperately making it a pricey meal."}
{"text":"So I am not a huge burger girl but I have to say that I love this place. I just get the regular cheeseburger and of course I have to get that huge bowl of cheese fries with peppers. 

I like the burgers here because the meat patty is not to thick and you can taste the veggies on the burger. I hate when all you can taste is hamburger. I wish that they just had grilled onions and it was not mixed with bacon. That would be amazing.

The cheese fries with peppers are the best. I normally have to share these but I am pretty sure I could eat the entire bowl myself. They are that good. 

I have never tried the custard but it looks delicious. The staff is always very nice and I love that they have a patio. This restaurant is always very clean. People say that the prices are high but I think the quality of food here is worth it."}
{"text":"First time trying shake shack and was kinda of disappointed by the quantity of food vs the price. Don't know if shake shack out side of Vegas is cheaper but the one at NYNY is pricey in my opinion. 

I got a side of fries, a single shack burger and a peanut butter shake was $16.00 plus. The burger was a size of a white castle burger which you know is not very big. The set up of the burger was similar to in and out but tasted a little different. In my opinion in and out is better tasting burger overall but it's a matter of opinion I guess. The fries are better at shake shack. There's alot of options for shakes they use frozen custard so it's very smooth and rich. 

If you like over hyped over priced burgers then shake shack is for you."}
{"text":"Burgers are so juicy, very well seasoned, cooked perfectly. Bun is soft and yummy. My husband replaced his bread with lettuce which still keeps the burger delicious and cuts on the carbs. Love this place"}
{"text":"This is located at New York New York. There is no way to get to it inside of the casino. You have to walk outside for it. It looks like it can get really busy here but the line to order goes by fast and the food comes out fast as well. You get a pager to alert you when the food is ready. 

I ended up getting the shack burger. The patty has a nice char to it,and the patty is pretty big so you are not left with an empty bun for your last few bites. The bun is delicious! It's like a dinner roll. The cheese fries were good too. I got the strawberry shake recommended by an employee, and it was good too. Overall, I'd come back for a burger when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Shake Shack! You are one of the reasons why I'm coming to Vegas, besides partying I guess! Every time I go there to party, this is a must stop to grab for a quick meal. Those crispy fries with cheese drizzle on the top, I love you and I can eat them all day long. And guys! Their portobello 'shroom' burger, oh my god, this was so delicious and there was cheese in between portobello and that deep fried shroom ball with burger buns, they were just so freaking delicious. Highly recommended to this burger, I wasn't even a vegetarian myself and I love eating this! I enjoyed every single bites of it #Foodgasm! And their milkshake was very rich too, but too heavy for me not a big fan of it. Overall, I really dig this and I hope to meet you again in the near future!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to visit the  Shake Shack in Las Vegas for our girls weekend-getaway!  I have heard the original Shack is located in NYC and if this is any indication of the original, I'll be coming back to Vegas again and again and again.

We visited the Shack during the less busy season of January so the tourists weren't in FULL swing yet, but it was still quite busy, so we had plenty of time to decide what we wanted because the menu was visible as we stood in line.

We weren't very hungry, but wanted to try a variety of items since it was our first time.  We decided to share a Shack Burger and a Shak-cago Dog.  We also got an order of crinkle fries with cheese and a large diet coke to wash it all down!

  There were 5 of us and our order came to about $21.  We found a large corner booth that fit all of us.  We were given a buzzer to alert us when our dinner was ready.  It took about 7 minutes to get our food and we were super excited!!!

Everything was delicious.  The hamburger was small like a larger slider style and we ate it all quickly! The hot dog was the best, just too small for 5 people to share...haha.  We got back in line and ordered another round of burger, dogs and fries!  We mixed it up a bit and got Smoke Shack burger which was the winner of the night.  

We are heading back again tomorrow for lunch.  Gotta get a concrete icecream sundae :)

Tips and Tricks...We were told it was located inside the food court of NY/NY but it's actually outside on the strip next to the Brooklyn Bridge.  
Refills are free and they bring you a new cup of your choice of beverage! 
Get the chz fries, with the chz on the side....game changer!!"}
{"text":"Food = DELICIOUS and unhealthy.  The cheese fries and a concrete are a must!
Service = SO SLOW.  We waited for a long time for our food.
Location = an easy spot to get to on Las Vegas Blvd by New York New York
Love this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. If you're looking for an excellent burger and delicious fries this is the place for you. Sure it's pricier than In N Out as everyone here is comparing it to, but hey you're paying for a much more quality burger. Love love love."}
{"text":"I wish I had gotten the chicken sandwich because I had heard good things about it, but I went with a burger, I wanted to give it a try. Meh...it was just meh. Super small as well, especially for the price. I don't like crinkle cut fries so we skipped those and got a chocolate shake which was also very small and very average.
The service was great and the set up of the restaurant is modern and clean. I like you can grab a cup of water if you need one.
So we came with our dog, it was nice day for winter but the entire patio is in the shade so I was freezing the entire time, they have heaters out there but they weren't on, my husband tried to turn on a few of them but none of them had gas, so we ate quick. We did get our dog a Pup-tini (cup of vanilla ice cream, pb, and a dog treat)..which he absolute loved, so that was worth the trip.
I'll try them again but next time...chicken and ice cream!"}
{"text":"We tried the cheese fries, loaded fries (bacon, bell pepper and cheese), shake-cago( hot dog with onions, tomatoes and pickles) chicken shack, shack burger and all I can say is \"who is in-n-out\" jk but it's honestly really good quality and in my opinion legit better than in-n-out . My favorite has to be the chicken shack burger (it's better than chick fil A by far) with the loaded fries! Great service and definitely a great experience! Cant wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Ive heard so much about this east coast hype, I had to check it out

I ordered the regular (single and double) shake burger, fries, and a frozen custard. We waited about 10 minutes for our buzzer to go off to pick up our food. 

The burger was good. The buns were so light and fluffy (I'm sure that a lot of people love this, but I'm a toasty/crunchy type person, I wasn't the biggest fan). The ingredients were fresh and the cheese was perfectly melted. But a single burger DID NOT fill me up at all. Their crinkle fries were perfect. Hot, toasty, and just the right amount of salt. It wasn't until I finished my fries was I moderately content with my meal. I can't remember the frozen custard name that I ordered but it was the one was peanut butter. OMG IT WAS TO DIE FOR. Thick, creamy, sweet, didn't melt while I was eating my meal. I highly recommend this!

If I was to compare this east coast goodie to our west coast rival, I'd still choose WEST COAST. Why?
 - Cost: I paid $27 for 2 burgers, 2 fries, and 1 frozen custard. Thats too much for just burgers and fries for lunch. The price would have been higher if I ordered a drink/shake too!
 - Burger: Was a little disappointing. A single didn't even come close to filling me up, a double didn't even come close to filling a man up either (weren't not even crazy hungry eaters). The taste was good, but nothing crazy special which would make me crave it in the future.

I don't think I will go out of my way to come here, but if I am in the area, I won't hesitate to come here again. 

Recommendations:
 - Fries
 - Frozen goodies

{"text":"This is a convenient location right on the strip.  We sat at the outdoor patio.  The location was busy but pretty clean.

I still think this place is overpriced and that In and Out is better.  The burgers are ok and the fries are kind of dry.  Still it hit the spot and was not too outrageously priced for being on the strip."}
{"text":"The Food and service is not even marginal!  We ordered two cheese burgers, one order of Fries, a strawberry concrete and a small beer ant the cost was $33.  Way over priced.

Keelin the guy that took our order screwed that up three times, I corrected him on what we ordered and he still got it wrong, for the cost there is way too many burger joints in town to waste your time with Shake Shack.  The burgers taste was good, nothing to write home to mom about, fires were on the oily side.  The Highlight was the Brooklyn Ale, it was good.

Over all I would pass on the Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"I do not understand the hype.  We tried it today because of all the media attention and because it is walking distance from our house.  Not impressed.  Like other reviewers mentioned, its expensive for burgers and fries.  So our expectations were high.  We didn't finish anything we ordered including the shakes.  Waste of calories."}
{"text":"How Shake Shack has made 4-stars is beyond my comprehension 

The good: 
* shakes = THE BOMB
* food was HOT and made to order
* the staff SUPER friendly

The bad:
* the burger patties were as thin as a piece of paper and waaaaay overcooked 

If you wanna shake = 5-stars
If you want a burger = 1-star"}
{"text":"Environment is great, service is great, the only thing that I  dislike is the serving size. I got a chicken shack & the burger was small. I finished it in 5 bites. Definitely smaller than IN N OUT or 5 guys which are two popular burger joints."}
{"text":"Good burger and fries, though not as good as the Habit.  Also $5 more than the Habit for the same order. Definitely a choice for millenials."}
{"text":"This place is the best, great food ( a little overpriced for me) but well worth it. I love the burgers, just the right amount of taste that I love and it actually fills me up. I am upset about one thing though, why is it that the BBQ bacon cheese fries are only there for a season? When I tried that, that would be the only thing I'd get because it was so delicious. The employees are really friendly and they don't seem to get frustrated when they're asked questions. A little overpriced, but worth it."}
{"text":"Delish! Skip the hot dog and go for the burger or chicken sandwich or both! Cheese fries are yum and the frozen custard is amazing.. Go for the dust devil if you are a peanut butter fan. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack more than In-n-out. Yep, I said it. I grew up with In-n-out and can see why people love it but Shake Shack's burgers have so much more flavor!! I  love the Shackburger with cheese crinkle fries! The shakes are seriously make-you-get-off-your-diet delicious. 

I love that this location closes at 2am! I even got Shake Shack delivered via Postmates before! That was fun.

I usually park at New York, New York and walk through the casino to get the this location but now that the T-Mobile arena and park area is open, I can park at Monte Carlo and walk through that side street to get to Shake Shack. 

People watching is definitely fun at this location. There is outdoor seating complete with water mists to keep you cool. However. the water mists do nothing on those 100+ degrees days.

Tip: If you are an M-life baller (\"noir\" level or whatever), there is a separate VIP line for you. I'm not one but wish I was!"}
{"text":"ARGH I wanted to hate Shake Shack. To me it was an imposter from NY who just over-complicated the already perfect burger with high prices that couldn't hold a candle to In n Out. Though I am loyal to In n Out, I have to admit there are times I would admit I want Shake Shack instead.

The lines are crazy in the Vegas one so time wisely. Hubs and I got lucky and went on a Monday before lunch time and waited maybe 15 minutes while the line was still inside. I got the Shake stack because I wanted to give this a proper chance, also I love meat and mushrooms. Hubs got the Shack burger with a hot dog (maybe Shackago don't remember). We also got the crinkle cut fries. The food was piping hot, fresh and surprisingly good. The Shake Stack was almost suspiciously flavorful and delicious and I wondered how, hubs' burger was good too, just pretty basic and this is where a standard burger would lose out to in n out. The crinkle cut fries I had super low expectations because not once in my life have I ever had properly cooked crispy crinkle cuts. These were good though, what fries should be, hot, cooked through, crispy AF on the outside and soft on the inside. The hotdog was not memorable. I don't think the prices are justifiable especially considering their small portion sizes but whatever, imagine you're in NY and you're paying extra for the privilege.

Though this place is pretty big, there's very limited seating for the # of people going through, so don't plan on sitting down here to eat. Some of their seating is annoying, my hubs and I luckily acquired some seats and we were sitting on benches with little knee height round \"tables\" to balance our food on. It's annoying because we're stooping and bending over to eat the food, also gives me indigestion to eat like that. 

This place is located at NYNY hotel and it's pretty obvious from the street. Lines get absolutely ridiculously fucken crazy so watch out. Prices are too high for me to feel like it's a GREAT value but overall, I sometimes crave the shake stack still."}
{"text":"Went there during NFL playoffs and the place was pack. We ordered the smokeshack and cheese fries. My daughter had their all beef hotdog. I enjoyed the burger and my daughter finished her hotdog but the cheese fries was just 'alright'. I like the cheese fries from in-and-out more for some reason... Will be back there and try their other items in the menu like their custards and shakes next time."}
{"text":"I don't really understand what all the hype is about. It's pretty good, but nothing like what I expected. I got the shack stack burger and it was good. Not super heavy on the grease, so didn't feel sick after eating it, which is a plus. You can tell they use quality product. I also got cheese fries, I can do without the cheese next time, the fries were good themselves. I also got the salted caramel shake... now the shakes, I can see why the hype, SSSOOOOO GOOD. The service was superb, I was greeted upon entry, they asked me if I needed any help navigating the menu, my order was taken promptly, thanked me for coming in, and my order was ready to go in about 10 minutes (they were not busy)."}
{"text":"We had stayed in Vegas for New Year's weekend and saw that New York New York had finished remodeling their new strip sidewalk with the new Hershey store and some restaurants including Shake Shack. We've heard of the name before so we wanted to try it out. 

Shake Shack just opened before New Year's day so outside there was an introductory line where a guy handed out menus and introduced the items they had to offer. He briefed us on their purpose to use \"all natural premium ingredients\" with no hormones, etc. Briefly looking over the menu we see prices are a bit high than we are used to but it's okay, we're thinking it better be good cause we'd be comparing them to other popular burger joints like Umami Burger and Slater's 50/50.

Service was efficient; we had gotten our food without much wait. The condiments counter was simple with utensils, lids, ketchup/mustard, and water. I wish they had the sport peppers on the counter that they use in their dog, which I'll get to in a bit. Chairs and tables here remind me of Mendocino Farms in L.A.; they're made from recycled and sustainable materials. Everything about this joint reminds me that they're trying to do good for the environment and our health. Hipster, as they call it?

The presentation of the food was cute. Each burger fit in a paper sleeve and hot dog and crinkle cut fries sat in small trays. Having said that, we were disappointed in the size of our meal especially for the price we had paid. It's all quality over quantity here so you gotta give up some of your wins from gambling! However, the taste of the burgers were mediocre. I had the single ShackBurger and my bf had the SmokeShack (yes these are registered trademarks already). The ShackBurger was a simple cheese burger with one leaf of lettuce and one slice of tomato. Pretty minimal that I couldn't even taste the ShackSauce (spread). The SmokeShack was a bit better with cherry peppers but nothing really stood out. Turns out they were originally a hot dog stand in New York so it was a good thing my boyfriend ordered a Shackago dog too. This was pretty good with the toppings placed perfectly in and outside the split dog. The sport peppers was really what gave this dog a kick! We had all three concretes: Shack Attack, Jackpot, and All Shook Up, but nothing was that great about it either. I've had better concretes elsewhere.

For now, I think I'd only go back for their hot dogs which isn't much of a selection; neither is their burger choices. Also I'd like to note that their burgers and fries are good because of the quantity of oil they use. Cheese burgers and cheese fries on top of that? To me, that just sounds unhealthy too. So for being a proponent of eating natural, non-GMO, and all that crap, Shake Shack should consider adding much more veggies and using less oil in their items. Just saying!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm. That's a tasty burger!  For you pulp fiction lovers!  I had the shake stack. Cheeseburger with a 'Shroom Burger with cheese, lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce. The shroom burger is a fried Portobello mushroom patty. Then there was cheese stuffed in there somewhere. It needed a little extra sauce, but I like my condiments. It was very tasty! Went well with a draft beer. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had!!! Do not miss out on the smoke shack burger and as for the fries.... hands down best fries I've ever had. Make sure to ask for extra cheese....you won't regret it!!! Shake Shack....I beg you...come to Utah!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place !! I'm so happy it's finally here in the west coast. This is definitely a must... Especially if you find yourself in Vegas."}
{"text":"very busy spot. but food was amazing. the patties were cooked really juicy and the cheese melting was the highlight.... the employees were so nice. I asked if the lemonade was moderately sweet or very sweet and the cashier just stopped and got me two sample cups of each lemonades even though it was busy! i really appreciated it. so glad there was a shake shack here, made my tummy happy."}
{"text":"Not really impressed, burger tasted good and was hot. The fries was the best part of Shake Shack. After that it went down hill. Shakes were way to sweet. Not much flavor and small for $5. Not many choices for burger toppings. $45 for 3 is a bit high for a burger joint."}
{"text":"First time here. Food and service are fantastic!  Try the double down fries-- loaded with cheese and bacon. How do you lose with that? Bonus for the throw back pub games. They got fooseball and shuffleboard. Kids had fun and ate all of there food which says a lot."}
{"text":"While most people readily compare this place to in-n-out... I can't seem to just do that as they seem to be completely two different things to me... What I liked about this place though is that it is not as crowded as that of the one on the strip... More than anything... The burger patty crumbles in your mouth and that for me is a party in my mouth and belly!"}
{"text":"Sry had to give this place a 3 Star ..food is ok nothing that special I just feel people hyped this place up to much ....another thing is seating sucks in here it's so hard to find a seat ....and people are constantly hovering over your table and asking if your almost done eating ...shakes are ok as well I still think Nelsons frozen custard is way better"}

its a modern, trendy burger joint. where they offer a tasty variety of shakes and known for their 'shack' burger. 

all items are A La Carte so u order a burger, fries and drink separately ...sorta custom

we tried the Shack Stack ...great tasting meat with a portabelo mushroom in it  drenched in melted cheese ...awesome! 
...sided with a Salted Pretzel Shake and some fries, thas good eatin! 
also got their Shack burger with the bacon in it and a lemonade ...not bad either.   has its own remarkable taste
food was made to order and only took a few minutes to come out, just wait for the 'taser' to buzz(u'll see what i mean   haha) 

the big plus was their wait staff. there was this one lady tending to the dining area who was pleasant, kind, helpful, informative and got refills for us ...thas wassup!

overall, good place to hit up at least once on ur LV visit"}
{"text":"What can I say ... AWESOME ... gfs parents don't eat burgers but after some convincing they tried it and loved it ... It's bigger then the location in NY and they have a patio ... Enjoy"}
{"text":"We came to Vegas on a trip to visit some family and wanted some SHAKE SHACKKK!! We did not want to brave the line at the location on the strip and was a teeny bit hesitant about this location per other reviews. But I am sooo glad we decided to go!! Although the store isn't placed in some cool and hip area, it's at a mall. BUT there was NO CRAZY LINE and parking was right there!

The restaurant was clean, service was very friendly and helpful, and the food was great! The burgers were fresh and the shakes were yummy! My sisters got the chicken sandwich and it looked so good. I'm already thinking about my next visit to Shake Shack (either in LA or NY) and am already salivating. My first visit was at the Grand Central Station subway so it wasn't the best first impression as it was part of a train station foodcourt, but this visit has definitely redeemed itself!"}
{"text":"Ordered a vanilla shake and was somehow given a chocolate shake. Waited for 10+ minutes for a vanilla shake. The employees seem annoyed that they made a mistake and so decided to just not bring another shake."}
{"text":"Unfortunately.. I was let down and underwhelmed by this place. I remember being in LA when the West Hollywood Shake Shack opened. I saw the line down the block and asked my friends if it was a new club or something. Nope, just the new Shake Shack. So needless to say, I had high expectations after seeing the crowds and hearing how much people love this place. 

Simply put: it was okay. 

The building is cool. I like the atmosphere of the place, it's modern and a decent size. Pretty clean as well. Granted tables can fill up quick during peak times. There is plenty of outdoor seating as well which is nice for non summer months. 

You place your order at the counter and then receive a buzzer. When it lights up, your order is ready and you pick it back up at the other end of the counter. The girl taking our order was nice enough. We came in right around 2pm on a Sunday so it wasn't too crazy, I think we were probably in between rushes. We found an inside table easily. 

We wanted to experience it all so we had a decent order. One single shackburger, one single plain cheeseburger, cheese fries, coffee milkshake, Kierland campfire concrete (vanilla instead of chocolate custard) and one small soft drink. 

The burgers we thought were pretty basic. They weren't horrible but they didn't blow us away. The shack sauce tasted like slightly jazzed up mayo. Again, it was fine but I was expecting more.

The cheese fries were ok as well. The cheese sauce was more subtle than the processed nacho cheese sauce you get a lot of places but it was just kinda blah. The fries were crispy, they are standard crinkle cut fries. 

The coffee milkshake was good but for the size and price I probably wouldn't order it again. They also charge you like 50 cents if you want whipped cream. I'm not saying 50 cents makes or breaks me but it feels a little cheap. I rather just pay 50 cents more for the shake and get the option without knowing there was a cost to it. I declined whipped cream when they asked just because I felt meh about it. 

The campfire concrete was tasty with vanilla custard, graham cracker and Zak's Chocolate. 

You have to tell them what soda you would like when you order. If you want a soda refill you have to bring it back to the counter and ask. Not a big deal just a heads up. 

Our total was pushing $30. Honestly for the price I just felt like there was much to be desired. If you want plain fries, a single burger and a drink you are already going over $10. Let alone cheese fries, shakes, or a double burger. They do have beer and wine here though if you are in the mood, which other casual burger places lack. 

My two favorite things: the water tap by the condiments that you can grab a cup from at any time (no need to get back in line to ask for one if you forgot to ask initially) and them using Zak's Chocolate in their concrete. Zak's is a local chocolate shop that is amaaaazZiinnnnng. 

Overall: okay, but not totally sold."}
{"text":"Though this is not the best burger I have ever had it is the best fast food burger I ever ate. The prices were a bit outrages . But it was the strip. It is a must try for anyone who has not had it ."}
{"text":"I could never go to Vegas or any East Coast city without going to Shake Shack. Period.

The first time I ever went, I knew it would be trendy and I had some expectations. The first thing that caught my eye was the branding. Their branding is everything, and 3 years ago something like that really does set a business apart from the rest. To me, it shows they are passionate and care enough to have their business be different yet up to date. Their brand is cohesive and I can tell just by looking at it that is Shake Shack.

I ordered a Smoke Shack because bacon, fries, and a plain chocolate shake. I don't normally order anything dairy since I can't have it, but I was feeling rebellious. The sauce is amazing, the toppings are perfect, the bun is only cut 3/4 of the way so the stuff inside doesn't fall out as easily, the burger is an actual beef patty which I am picky about, and the fries were the perfect balance of fried but baked and not overly greasy. I didnt eat more than a few bites of the Shake, but it was also amazing. 

Since that visit, I have had pretty much their entire menu except for the hot dogs, and I am nothing but impressed. I can order anything and know I am getting something delicious. The first time I had their chicken sandwich it rocked my world. I know will switch off between the burger and the chicken sandwich since I can't pick a favorite. 

I wish I had more to contribute as far as shakes go, but I've heard to always go with the concrete shakes since they have the best consistency. I also know that each location has their own specialty Shake. 

Bottom line, you are a fool if you don't make a trip if you have one close in your travels."}
{"text":"ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS go to Shake Shack when you have the chance!

I am a HUGE fan of Shake Shack, this being my 6th or 7th location I have been to (Utah does not have one) so I am over the moon when I see there is one in my area.

My go to that is yet to disappoint me is the Smoke Shack with the flavored lemonade of the day. If I am feeling extra hungry I will get some fries too. Usually the burger and large drink do the trick.

Can't leave without mentioning the buns. Not sure what you do to those but keep doing what you're doing"}
{"text":"The burgers here were the first thing we brought up when telling our friends about our trip to Vegas. So good!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Nothing more to say, but I will ;) The burgers and dogs are amazing and the toppings are on point. It's pretty affordable too. The only complain I might put forth is the size of the single size custard, but what there was in the cup was delectable."}
{"text":"It's an east coast chain, so it's guaranteed to have that uniform-Shake-Shack taste. Their greasy burgers hit the spot when you're hungover.

In case you didn't digest the name, this place is known for its shakes. So, ya gotta try one. Handspun options include: Vanilla, Chocolate, Caramel, Black & White, Strawberry, Peanut Butter or Coffee Fair Shake. They don't come in a fancy glass cup...so that was a bit of a let down, but the creamy consistency made up for the glass.

The specialty Shake Shack sauce isn't too noticeable on burgers but does enhance the flavor.

My friend said the gluten free bun \"wasn't disgusting and actually good.\" A rarity for her gluten free burgers.

I wouldn't go out of your way to visit, though.

If you are staying at the New York New York hotel or nearby, try Shake Shack for lunch, but attempt to limit your chain consumption in Vegas! Plenty of great local eats that are just as affordable."}
{"text":"After hearing that they were opening a SS in the west, I got so excited because I seriously LOOOOVE Shake Shack. It was my favorite spot back when I visited New York a few years ago.

The Vegas location was definitely a nice reminder of my blissful NY experience, but unfortunately was not as amazing as the holy burger franchise that I know and love. 

Sure the burger was good, but it didn't have that wow factor from the Shake Shack I've had in NY. The shroom burger is supposed to be mindblowing the moment you bite into it, a huge slice of portobello and cheese slowly melting into your mouth. Disappointingly, this fried shroom patty was smaller than expected and just tasted plain greasy. 

The cheese fries were just as delicious and the custard was no disappointment either. THE CUSTARD....wow. So smooth, creamy, delicious, and not overwhelmingly sweet. The perfect dessert. 

Also the seating situation is a nightmare. People are gathered like vultures and waiting around for seats to open."}
{"text":"I love shake shack, I go every time I go to Las Vegas. The meat is so tender with good flavor. The burger seems to melt in your mouth. The fries are usually just okay, but I love fries with burgers. The shakes are also so good and nice and thick!"}
{"text":"I visited for lunch on a Monday shortly after noon. The line was probably about 25 people deep, and I was amazed that is took only 15-20 minutes to order, pay and get my food. There is plenty of seating and everything came out piping hot and fresh as expected. I had the Shackburger with a side of fries. Everything was great. I'll definitely be back now that I've confirmed the 'plain' burger is good. I can't wait to experiment with toppings, the chicken and shakes!"}
{"text":"Great food ,many choices, very nice people. Really injoyed waffles and chicken together!!!"}
{"text":"Place is awesome. Burger is solid. Do it!
Modern McDonalds. I'm pretty sure Super Duper in SF copied this place. (But Shake Shack is better) the end."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to eat at Shake Shack while in NYC so I was ecstatic after hearing that they opened a location in LV! The location is larger with much more seating, but the portion sizes were tiny! I ordered the shroom burger for $6.99 and cheese fries for $3.99. The fries were just as good as I remembered but I was so disappointed with the shroom burger. It was more like a snack for me. For $7, I'm expecting more than just a snack of a burger. A bigger dude would probably need 3 of them to feel full. It was fun to eat because they stuff the mushroom with cheese and fry the patty, but I was sad to see the burger done after 3-4 bites. At least the strawberry lemonade for $4 was good (regular size). 3 stars for the good cheese fries and larger seating area."}
{"text":"Probably pains my friend to hear this, but shake shack makes a bomb burger. Greasy, cheesy, meaty, beefy, oh just get in my belly goodness! Probably one of the best over the counter burgers I've ever had. I can see why this place is so hyped.

Got into Vegas at 12am. So hungry, what to eat? Oh shoot, Shack shack is open til 2 am. Perfect spot to grab some late night munchies. The soft potato buns are the perfect vessels for the well seasoned beef and gooey cheese to get into your mouth. I could taste some sort of seasoning from the beef or sauce. That sauce provided a creamy texture in my bite while not being over powering. I absolutely loved every bite of the burger. 

But wait there is more! In addition to the fantastic burger they serve here, the crinkle cut fries were fried and seasoned perfectly! All the crispy edges and no soggy fries. Thank you for not fking this up. Probably the best crinkle cut fries I've ever had. 

It's Vegas, so I had a beer. It was an IPA, paired wonderfully with my burger. Not gonna lie, it's kinda expensive for burger and fries. When compared to any other burger place(oh lets just saying IN N Out burgers), 1 shack burger costs almost the price of 2 double doubles. 

I love their decors inside, it's very clean, and service was very straight forward and quick. I was generally quite hyped for this place because of my friends, but this place totally exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"This is a must stop whenever I visit Las Vegas now. Shake Shack is the famous burger chain from New York. I always get the Shack stack with a side of cheese fries. Shake stack comes with a fried portobello filled with cheese.  That fried portobello really makes the burger stands out. I can't wait for this place to open in LA!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack first timer and I must say it was pretty good!  Got there maybe 15 minutes after opening and it was already busy!  We got one of the last tables available.  About halfway through our meal though there were quite a few people finishing up and leaving, freeing up more tables, but they were quickly filling up.  There was also a bit of a line to place your order but it seemed to move very quickly.

For my food, I got the single Shack Burger with bacon.  It was really good!  A bit on the small size though, so if you come really hungry, you might want to get the double.  Got some crinkle cut fries on the side.  It's a generous serving so you might want to split it with someone else.  I had so many fries left over that I just could not finish!  To drink I had their mango lemonade which was just ok, and I had to get a Concrete.  I got their All Shook Up which I enjoyed and definitely recommend.  

Great and friendly service, from the person who took my order to the person who took my tray when I was all finished.  Can't go wrong with service and food like that.  Definitely check Shake Shack out!"}
{"text":"Hubs and I loved the burgers here. We both got the Shack Stack. They did not disappoint. We didn't take pictures because they looked as good as some of the ones already shown here. But really liked the slight 'shroom flavor plus the oozement of cheese. Nice. Crinkles fries good. Our order got overlooked and we waited 20 minutes unfortunately for our food, and they gave us an extra order of fries for the flub. Otherwise, will definitely come back. Like the different seating options here. You can get a table inside or outside, or snag one of the cozier couch like areas."}
{"text":"Fresh burgers, delicious shakes and dessert and totally affordable! Yeah!!! You can't go wrong with anything you order here. If you want something fast, order from the express booth outside. Make sure you save room for dessert as the frozen custard is A MUST! Access the entrance outside of New York New York."}
{"text":"Wow, I was quite impressed with the place. First you are greeted warmly by a Shake Shack employee who welcomes you and inquires whether it is your first visit  there or if you've already been. They then take the time to explain the menu.

My only peeve is that they don't have a grilled chicken sandwich...Just a fried option does not fly in my book...

I ordered a simple single hamburger with lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles. I thought it was quite awesome but maybe a little steeply priced at $ 4.69 (with tax)...

The seating is comfortable and plentiful inside as well as outdoors. The employees were very courteous and friendly and seemed happy to be working there."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Nothing really that great about it. It's a mediocre burger. It's hard to find seats because people just linger around. 

The cheese fries are terrible! Literally nacho cheese drizzled over the fries, nothing spectacular about that. 

The burgers are small. They are flavorful but not worth 25 bucks for two burgers and fries. 

Definitely won't come here again."}
{"text":"i'm giving three stars solely for how smooth this place is ran.

i was excited to try this place because we don't have one in michigan, and i have a friend who works at the philly location. however, i was actually really disappointed after trying it. i got the smoke shack, cheese fries and a drink for $15. fast food is almost never worth $15! the food was fresh and wasn't greasy at all. but for $15 i got a super flat burger with barely any flavor and cheese fries that were barely cheesy. i wish i had tried the shack burger instead but what's done is done. the service is pretty great though and they have buzzers for when your food is ready to be picked up at the counter. i would try it again if i was near one, but def. not the smoke shack!"}
{"text":"If yelp can do .5 stars this would have got a 3.5/5

This place in my opinion had wayyyyy to much hype associated with it. Seeing what the hype was about I decided to try it with a few friends...I originally wanted the ShackMeister Burger as I heard it was the burger on their secret menu to try but they sold out of it...so if you actually do read this review keep in mind I didn't have their best item on their menu...that's like going to In-N-Out and not having the option to order Animal Style...

I ordered: 

Shack Burger - IMO the best burger out of the two that I tried...tasted fresh but god damn them buns were heavy that Sir-Mix-A-Lot would fuck with them...

Smoke Shack - sounded good, looked good, however left underwhelmed as the mixture of cheese, cherry peppers and bacon tasted borderline fake...no idea but it wasn't just my tastebuds that were fooled as everyone ordered the same burger at the table....

Shack-cago Dog - Basically a Chicago dog that was decent

Crinkle Cut Fries - Nice break from regular fries....

Jackpot Concrete - I love frozen custard....the Jackpot has Belgian Waffles and many toppings you would put on Belgian Waffles....I fucks with this 

I don't usually provide a whole lot of weight on service in my reviews but let me be clear...the service to Shake Shack was fuckin incredible and they make sure to take care of you it's just that with other options in this city the food fell short imo..."}
{"text":"BELIEVE THE HYPE! Man I'm new to Vegas but I just might stay now. They got three of the most popular burger chains all within one mile of each other. In n Out, White Castle, and the incredible SHAKE SHACK. I didn't really expect too much besides a good burger. I've heard the comparisons to In n Out but I knew better than to compare and to take it as its own beast. Now I'm from LA, so In n Out is my thing but DAAAMMNNNNN. Not gonna lie we were blown away. 
Ok first, we were trying to not be fat, so we decided to share. We fixed that later. We started with a smokeshack double, cheese fries, a coke, and a vanilla shake (Our idea of not being fat). 
So first and foremost; the cheese fries are off the hook! I know it's just cheese and fries but they were bomb. My 5' girlfriend demanded her own cheese fries next time. 
The vanilla shake was really good, and the fact that they only use sugar and milk products without any corn syrup makes it that much better. 
Now the smokeshack double was good, however it came with peppers and that really affects the taste of the burger. So while it was good, I felt I didn't get a fair chance to really experience the flavor of their burger. So after we finished what we already ordered we did the fat thing and went back to get a shack burger with lettuce and tomato. And man, that's where it's at. They have different variations but I believe the original is the best. I'm coming back tomorrow. No lie. If they weren't already about to close when we left I would've gone back again tonight! Super bomb. And I didn't even know until we left but my girlfriend informed me that they only use grass fed certified Angus for their patties. That's just a bonus for me because I'll be back regardless. Good job east coast. Good job.
Oh and the service was impeccable. But it wasn't busy when we went so I'm not sure how they handle the rush."}
{"text":"I can never go a trip to Vegas without stopping here before the end of it!

Shake Shack is pretty much busy at every waking hour of every weekend, so if you're lucky enough to catch them during their slow season then it makes it even more worth it. Even though they've expanded to SoCal, I still find myself coming here because it's become part of a tradition for me. That, and because nothing beats walking the strip with alcohol that you can bring in and out with you.

I always get the Original Shack Burger but you'll have to remember to ask for your fix-ins or they won't put it in the burger. The shack sauce is amazing and always worth adding on, and the fries are a must.

As far as drinks go, I like to do a blend of a chocolate and strawberry shake or an orange cream soda float. 

This is located on the exterior of the New York New York hotel and is easily visible on the strip. Overall, I would certainly recommend coming here because of the decent prices and amazing quality food.

(8/100 - 2018)"}
{"text":"Bomb! 

Got the double cheese burger with the double down fries. 

The fries were huge and it was too much IMO. It comes with pieces of BBQ, red chili peppers, cheese and lots of fries. I liked it but it can def be shareable or just eaten by itself. 

The burger was bomb! The place was huge and it was packed since everyone wants to eat it. Overall, great food and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack is such an EAST COAST staple that finally decided to move over to the West Coast and share their goodness. 

I've been to both locations, Summerlin & The Strip. I love the The Strip's ambiance and set up compared to Summerlin's, but both amazing! Also, in Miami on  Miami Beach is small, but cute! The one in Brooklyn in DUMBO is somewhat cute and trendy and has outside seating as most locations do. 

I've tried the burger and shroom burger with their crinkle cut fries and cheese fries. ALL ARE AMAZING! I also recently tried their gluten free bun, which was a preference and definitely preferred the regular almost like Hawaiian bun that melts in your mouth. I also tried their vanilla custard with sprinkles as a birthday surprise for our friend. It was definitely the cherry on top to our meal!"}
{"text":"I must live on another planet because I JUST realized that I have a Shake Shack super close to me now! .. either I was on another planet or in the new mom fog, anyone else feel me?

I LOVE Shake Shack. Again, I am the trainer that tells her clients to live the 80/20 life to enjoy the FOOD with balance!

I remember a previous Yelp event that had me HOOKED on their Smokeshack burger which I got again and also their crinkle cut fries. The smokeshack has cherry peppers along with their special sauce and you can get it as a single or double, just like with all of their burgers. Hubby and I enjoyed these two, without fighting, and passed on their amazing custard and shakes only due to a dairy intolerance that must be recognized. 

I love that Shake Shack has the most friendly staff, beer and wine selections, and enough space for everyone to breathe and enjoy their time here!"}
{"text":"I first came to the Shake Shack during our Yelp Elite event here and hubby had to come try what I kept raving about! 

We LOVE the Smoke Shack with cherry peppers and bacon and it never disappoints! The burgers are so juicy and the soft potato bun is a perfect pillow for the burger! We even got to try the new custard flavor: SHACKENSTEIN! (vanilla vistas with a brownie on top!) I decided on the Desert Crunch-stellation with vanilla custard and toffee bits! The texture was so amazing and rich but not overpowering in sweetness and flavor! 

Service here is on point! The staff at this location offered samples of new flavors... Advice on beer selections and even seconds with fries when we joked that we needed more to give them an honest opinion - what's the worst that can happen when you ask for seconds right?? 

Yes, this is a place of indulgence ... And I'm the fitness trainer. I'm also all about the 80/20% lifestyle so we can enjoy foods that are in our city and all in moderation! .. I mean we did just finish up a Red Rock hike beforehand"}
{"text":"This place is way to hyped! It is crazy busy and loud. The food is pricy for what you get. I so wanted to love it, but I was disappointed and went searching for something else. 

Tried the smokeshack burger and I love burgers and couldn't eat more than 2 bites. I love getting g unique burgers but this was just gross in my opinion. Didn't care for the red peppers at all on it. 

The custard was good. Nothing to write home about. But for me I would skip the burger. Maybe I should have taken off the strange tasting red peppers. Mind you I love peppers."}

Well,  I  want you to forget about all of the negative remarks from everyone else on here!  After enjoying a meal here tonight with my Son all I can say is FABULOUS!!  We both had single burgers with Fry's, his were cheesy ones. And we both had shakes.  Everything was absolutely perfect couldn't have been happier with our choice for dinner this evening. As far as price, I feel it was adequate for the quality of food we received. If you are in Vegas you must give these Burgers a try.  I promise we will be back again."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had in my life. Well worth the price. They have a good selection and plenty of hotdogs and desserts as well. The beer selection is fantastic also. The Shackmeister is the best. I get it in the 32 oz souvenir mug each time. The shakes are phenomenal. This place is the best addition to the strip in a long time. The place is always clean and very busy. But the staff is always on it with excellent customer service. Kudos to the Shake Shack staff."}
{"text":"Great American food with a gourmet French restaurant price tag. I ordered the mushroom burger and it was delicious, but it was the size of a slider. For my slider, fries and a shake, the receipt was around $18.00. That's ridiculous for a burger joint and not even to be full after. Luckily, I had a $10 gift card, or I would have been furious. I won't be back, since the portions don't match the price tag. When places charge this much for so little, I find it insulting. It's like they're trying to a Jedi Mind Trick on me so that I feel like their meal sample is actually a meal."}
{"text":"Only rating the shroooooom burger. it's good, but be careful... the burning hot cheese filled shroom burger can burn ya! These burger portions are not really american sized, which is probably better for everyone.. but prices should be about a dollar cheaper. Their customer service is pretty stellar though... unsatisfied with something. Get it changed."}
{"text":"Have no clue how others give this place anything but 5 stars.  Yes it costs multiples over McDonald's but the taste is light years beyond it too.  The special bacon cheeseburger w cheddar sauce is a masterpiece.  The shakes are also amazing."}
{"text":"Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2015 #39 - #365

So, another east coast company tries to get a taste of the west coast just like 5 Guys. According to a few news sources, this Shake Shack location is making way more than their Times Square location. I consider it a positive thing because Shake Shack has definitely left a mark on the Las Vegas strip. 

What I heard through the grape vine is that it's better than 
In N Out but I disagree. In N Out in my opinion is still the best when it comes to burgers and fries. I ordered a double cheeseburger with regular fries, to be honest it's just average in my opinion. Maybe I'm not a burger enthusiast but I still side with the food at In N Out. 

The New York New York Hotel is constantly reinventing itself from a family resort to a hip and trendy hotel and I see it with the addition of Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Wow this place was so good!

Came super late at night (its Vegas so normal hours do not apply) and the line was out the door. It is definitely worth the wait.

I went simple and ordered a shack burger and fries, but simple in taste it was not! The bun was so soft and buttery, the meat was like steak, and the fries were crispy. I could not believe how good something so uncomplicated was, quality was definitely there.

For sure second favorite burger ever, next to In-N-Out because I'm a California girl."}
{"text":"Never have I ever had a better burger for this cheap. They also had beer, so that was awesome! THEY ALSO HAVE GLUTEN FREE BUNS!!! Guess what, THEY ARE GREAT!

The Decor/Atmosphere/Vibe: I loved the rustic feel to the restaurant & the layout, it's a very open and inviting space. The people are nice and friendly, and it's clean which I very much appreciate.

The Service: Every time we visited we always experienced great customer service. The ladies at the registers are just so friendly and patient, even when there's a line out the door and they've been working all day.

The Food: Cheap & delicious! What more is there to say? I was pleasantly surprised and very happy with the food. The French fries are wavy yet crispy, the burgers are well balanced and just down right delicious. I wish they replaced Washington's 'Dick's Burgers' with Shake Shack.

Overall: I will gladly go there every time I visit Las Vegas and I had a wonderful experience each time we ate there."}
{"text":"East Coast vs the West Coast, Bad Boy vs Death Row, Shake Shack vs In n Out Burger.

I'm sorry, even though I grew up here in California and around the venerable In n Out Burger, I would tip my hat off to Shake Shack, the definitive winner (IMO) between the two rivals. 
My first encounter of Shake Shack was when my sister-in-law visited us form Delaware. A connecting flight through New York she gave us a bag full of Shake Shack burgers. Upon first bite, I was scratching my head and was thinking: \"how the heck does this burger still taste hella good after being in a bag for at least 8 hours?\" That is when I researched and learned the wildfire growth of Shake Shack in the Eask Coast. 

Well finally, we have a change to try Shake Shack; freshly made. They have a location at New York New York at Las Vegas so we just had to try it out. Of course, I tried out their SmokeShack, cheeseburger topped with bacon. I just had their regular crinkle cut fires to accompany my sandwich as I am focused on their burger. 

My prediction is confirmed form my previous encounter: a very delicious burger with an equally delicious bun. The only word I can describe their bun is Artisan. And the beef, mmm. The beef patty is so delicious, Prime grade beef is what I could only think off when I taste Shake Shack's beef patty; that and a generous portion of fat. Just so delicious.
And still I chose the wrong burger.

The rest of my family ordered different Shake Shack burgers. The Stack Shack (IMO) is their flagship burger. Coupled with a large whole Portobello mushroom, (a different new approach to mushroom btw) Stack Shack is crème de la crème. 

With objectivity still present, Shake Shacks' fries were alright and In n Out's is better. My daughter ordered their cheese fries and it was mediocre. But I have not yet scratched the surface of Shake Shak's menu: Custards, Chickens, Hot Dogs, and a multitude of drinks. But as far as I know Shake Shack is the king of fast casual burgers. 

When will you open here in the Bay Area?!!"}
{"text":"There isn't a shake shack in San Diego at the moment (coming to La Jolla in 17) so I was interested in trying it out while in Vegas. I ordered a double burger and fries. Prices are notably higher than my favorite fast casual Burger joint, the Habit Grill.

To start I was not a fan of the bun. It was soft and mushy. I prefer it being slightly toasted to have a little contrast to the meat and toppings. I also felt the double patty was a little too much meat for the bun that was used. I ate about 4/5th of the burger before I was full. The crinkle cut fries also lacked seasoning for me. 

Out of the three of us that ate, one friend liked his burger but none of us need to eat here again. They also orderd the cheese fries but it was severly lacking on the cheese sauce. One of them ordered a burger, cheese fries and shake and the total was $18 after tax."}
{"text":"3 stars cause it's nothing out of the ordinary. The burgers are small and overpriced. Could've gone to in n out for a bomb burger combo and paid less than this. It was good, but nothin to brag about. 
It's cool how it was close to our hotel and the line was long but moved very fast. 
I had the spicy chicken sandwich and chick fil a was better. 
Gotta try something else next time"}
{"text":"One of the best burger places i have tried yet! Very delicious burger  for reasonable price..fries were delicious as well. I Wish you could refill your own drink..this is the only downside..back to the positive..customer service was top-notch..plenty of indoor and outdoor seating..i will be back!"}
{"text":"I've had my first Shake Shack in NYC four years ago and was in love with this spot.  When I was I Arizona last month for a week for work, I was delighted to see a Shake Shack location in Scottsdale, so we gave it a shot and ordered the same burger and fries we loved from our first meal at the NYC Upper West Side location.

The restaurant itself is nice, plenty of space for you to sit indoors or outdoors and there's a Disneyland line type of queue for you to stand in (as you wait to place your order at the counter) if they get busy during peak meal times.  When we arrived, there were only two customers ahead of us, so we were able to order right away.

Between my hubby and I, we ordered the Smoke Shack and cheese fries, but asked for the cheese on the side. When our order came out, our fries were covered in cheese, great.  When we looked at the burger, we didn't realize we ordered a chopped cherry pepper burger, there was an abundance of it in our burger.

After scraping off most of the cherry peppers in our burger, we enjoyed our burger, but wasn't in love with it.  The fries would have been great if I had the option to dip my fries in the cheese sauce I wanted on the side (I didn't want to deal with returning it to get the sauce on the side).

Overall, our Shake Shack experience was just okay.  They're opening their first San Diego location sometime next year (where I live), but I'm not as excited about that news after getting my fix at the Arizona location.  Oh well, on to the next burger."}
{"text":"This is my first visit and I'll just say that I love the burger that I had here. I ordered the bacon double cheeseburger with everything on it. I like burgers with everything on it but I think the next time I will just order it plain. The flavor of the meat is so good that it doesn't need anything else. 
The burgers we ordered look so good I forgot to take pictures. Sorry.  We also had a salted caramel shake that was delicious. Other food that was ordered was the cheese fries, double shack burger and the smoke shack. Everyone loves what they ordered. My father in law wanted a beer and asked the person taking our order which beer was an amber. She didn't know and just stared at the drafts. The manager came out from the back and gave us a sample to make sure it was what we wanted. He then saw my Star Wars shirt and asked if I I saw the new trailer. We talked for about 30 seconds about it. I must say that, that manager made us have a good experience even though the lady who took our order got our order wrong."}
{"text":"I was so pumped when I heard they were opening a Shake Shack in LV... So much closer than NY...and I am happy to say Good God the hype is REAL!!! 

The burgers here are amazing. Fresh, juicy and delicious! They are the perfect size too... Not too big and not too small. The use quality ingredients and you can definitely taste it.

The fries were good, I'm not a huge fan of crinkle cut in general but these were pretty good. Dip them in Shack Sauce and they are golden! 

Service was EXCELLENT. Fast, friendly, warm, helpful...all that good stuff. The space itself was extremely clean and spacious. I will be back for sure next time I'm in LV!! My mouth is watering writing this review right now!!!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is so good.  I wish I had two stomachs so I could get even more.  I eat nearly every meal here when I am in town.  No shame."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and good. Never one time disappointed. One of the best in Summerlin. As always excellent customer services! If you like chicken sandwich it's is the best here. It's a must try."}
{"text":"Worth the hype.

I saw the pictures and read the amazing reviews and now it was finally my turn to partake and man, it did not disappoint.

Let me just weigh in on the great burger war I've seen going on in the reviews... my favorite quick serve burger is from the Habit.  But that doesn't mean I can't love and appreciate another burger.  So just because you enjoy one, you don't have to trash another.  It's not a Sophie's choice here.  It's a burger.  That being said, Shake Shack is friggin delicious.

The line is usually long, but don't let that deter you, it moves quickly.  The server who took my order was super friendly and answered all my newbie questions.  I went with a standard shack burger fries and a drink.  First time, you need to make sure the core menu items can stand up.

After about a 10 minute wait, the order was up.  And yes, it looked as delicious as all the pictures people take.  Is there any better combination than meat and cheese?  Besides Penn and Teller, I think not.

Forget the look, the taste was amazing.  Moist and every single element was bursting with flavor.  Their secret sauce is a nice touch as well.  If I had to compare, I would say it's kind of similar to Smashburger with the overall type of burger it is, yet the flavors are definitely distinct.

I'm glad there isn't a shake shack closer to me... this could become a problem.  A delicious problem.  

Honestly, the strip is loaded with burger joints - some casual and others super fancy, but you'll be hardpressed to find a tastier burger.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Just as good as the NYC locations, so happy you are here!  I see some people complaining about size but this food is substantial; a burger, fries, and a beer (from Brooklyn Brewery I must add!) are just the right amount of food to fill you up without making you feel disgusting.  These are quality ingredients!  I almost added pickles to my SmokeShack and am so glad I didn't, the peppers are pickled and spicy.  I don't usually like bacon on my burgers but they use superior (Niman Ranch) bacon, it's crispy and flavorful.  This place has ruined \"fast food\" burgers for me and I couldn't be happier about that.  GO NOW!"}
{"text":"Simply the best mass produced burger in the land.  Sorry In and Out... It's really not even close and I love InO.... Better patty, better bun, and the coutremounts are a slam dunk winner at SS.  One of kind!"}
{"text":"Hits the spot every time. Burger patty is flavorful and combines well with the sweet brioche bun. Cheese fries delights. Sorry In n Out, it's just a few notches above..."}
{"text":"Consistent yumminess.
Overpriced but worth it.
Sorry, In n Out.

Lol,my review isn't long enough? 
I really have nothing more to say... still too short?  It's a burger joint!"}
{"text":"Not worth the 30$ we spent.  We got a Chick-shack, single shack burger. 1 order of cheese fries and 2 shakes. Each of the sandwiches and the shakes were $6 a piece.  The cheese sauce on the fries was not that great.  Regular nacho cheese would have been better. I don't think I would be willing to drive 20 minute to pay for overpriced food."}
{"text":"First time trying this east coast treasure. Tried the 'Shroom burger on two different occasions. Both cooked to perfection! Less guilt, though you do feel like you're getting a well-rounded Shake Shack experience. Devoured the crinkle cut fries, which were amazing. Going to go for the cheese fries like the one's my BFF had next time. If you are sans a peanut allergy, prefer rich and decadent flavors -  I did love the peanut butter shake! Overall a nice experience location near the T-Mobile Arena and in the New York, New York hotel."}
{"text":"Super Fast service.....

amazing food. WHY DO WE NOT HAVE THESE IN THE BAY?!?!?

Ugh, totally worth the wait if theres a line....burger buns are like hawaiian rolls (i think) and these cheese fries, omg to die for! totes worth squeezing in the dress you'll have to wear later that night!"}
{"text":"I was dieing to try shake shack since we don't have one in utah. I got the shack stack burger which had a deep fried mushroom filled with cheese inside. The burger itself looked freaking beautiful and just oozed with cheese and all the yummy juices. Needless to say, it was delish and satisfied every craving. I scarfed it down fast, along with the crinkle cut fries and a beer."}
{"text":"Went to Vegas for a business trip.
My coworker introduced us to Shake shack, the In n Out of the East Coast. Going here for lunch was crazy...actually a lot of places on the strip for food was crazy but not impossible (to find seats). I ordered the smoke shack and a black and white shake. The burger was HUGE! The black and white shake was vanilla custard stirred with chocolate fudge. I was in heaven :D My coworkers ordered the double down fries, the mushroom burger and the regular shack burger. I would ask for help eating the double down fries, The bowl is HUGE. Us three gals finished it, but imagine if you were just one person eating it!! The mushroom burger was interesting and as my coworker described it, it was cheese filled and it exploded on her LOL.

Seats get filled fast, so make sure you have friends to help look for spots as you wait for food. Overall food experience was great~ Would definitely eat here again when I come back!"}
{"text":"I am fully on the Shake Shack train. Located right by NYNY, this place is too good to pass up on a trip from Cali to Vegas.

During the inaugural (and maybe after) season for the Vegas Golden Knights, they have a deal called the Hattrick Special. It's a burger, fries, and drink for about $18 all in. The fact that it costs $18 and they wouldn't let me upgrade my soda into a beer is the only reason I dropped a star. Oh right, you also get a hockey puck as part of the special!

The taste of the burger is probably one of the top two fast food burgers I've ever had. Almost convinced me to grab a second, except for the fact that I was stuffed by the end. The fries were also tasty. Gonna just gripe again about the fact that I couldn't upgrade my soda into a beer. 

As for seating, there is plenty of seating indoors. If it's a nice day you can also grab a table outdoors as well.

Fully recommended, and definitely will be back any time I'm in the city."}
{"text":"Loved Shake Shack! Awesome burgers and shakes!"}
{"text":"This location is just as good as the ones back east. Huge delicious burgers and fries that have no business costing less than $10 on the strip. The perfect hangover cure and very kind to your wallet."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time there, and let me say this first, I didn't even touch the front door handle and I was greeted with a genuine 'welcome.' 

Our cashier was absolutely amazing. His name is Steven. I asked him about a couple of choices I had in mind, and without hesitation, he was able to recommend a burger that I said yes to (the smoke shack). He asked about fries, regular or with cheese, and I asked about the cheese. Steven excused himself for a second and came back with a sample of the cheese - whoa! Who does that without asking if I'd like to try it...I was sold and ordered the cheese fries, with the cheese on the side as he recommended that too.

The burger was just the right amount that didn't make you walk away feeling stuffed. The fries were crispy and the fondue-like cheese didn't overpower my flavorful burger.

It was a nice Friday night burger meal!! And an even better service staff that makes you feel happy!!"}
{"text":"It's like an overpriced In & Out. If you blindfolded me, I would not be able to tell the difference between their burgers or shakes. Save your dollars."}
{"text":"First time trying the Shake Shack.  Got the Stackshack, which is a cheeseburger stacked on a mushroom burger, and added grilled onions (called Road onions here); it was just alright, with the cheese making it slightly salty.  Star of the meal was the crinkle fries for sure.  Still like like my 5 Guys burger & fries better."}
{"text":"Cool greeter at door...put us in a kind longer than probably the line to enter an amusement park then had chatty with us and realized we're just getting ice cream and directed us to a different window...made killer recommendations and after a five min wait had killer custard concretes ...."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place since seeing the 60 minutes interview. I was not disappointed! The burger was off the chain! Fries were okay, tasted frozen, not hand cut, but the burger was perfection!
The order taker was super sweet and friendly! No complaints, price was fair for the Vegas strip!"}
{"text":"Just like NYC. We went opening night...it was crowded but not mobbed yet. We all got the SmokeShack (our regular) and cheese fries. Service was perfect, food spot on, and everything screamed of Shake Shack's high quality. 

It's expensive if you are accustomed to paying less than $20 for fast food. This isn't typical fast food though, it's made from the best quality ingredients. I've seen reviews that complain about the price....yes, it's higher than McDonald's but they aren't even apples and apples. Can't say enough about how great it is to have a Shack in Arizona!!!"}
{"text":"Can I tell you how excited I am that I can now get both Shake Shack AND White Castle in Vegas?!? 

It's all about the Shack Stack. And the shakes. Fries make it a well-balanced meal, if you're into that sort of thing.

This SS location stays pretty true to the chain, making me feel like I'm not in the madness of Vegas for a bit... and back in the madness of NY! 

Nice to see you on this side of the country, Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"I love a good burger! And this place delivered. The bugers, fries and shakes were yummy! They even have Gluten free buns!

The staff were friendly and knowledgeable despite the place being super busy! It's more of an a la carte style ordering and a small menu. The prices were okay compared to other District eateries.

It's a pretty kid friendly quick service place to grab a bite to eat with a shuffleboard table and another game."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype.  I got the classic cheeseburger and some fries, while my sister in law got the shack burger with a fried mushroom and it was heavenly.  Busy and loud, not a lot of seating, but it is pretty popular so you expect it."}
{"text":"Originally from NY and now it is everywhere. Some of NY branches make great burgers including the first store in Madison square park of NYC but not all branches. Finally opened in Charlotte and was not great as much as I expected. Ordered shake burger and the patty was not that juicy. Also adding cherry peppers and pickles was not a good idea as it gives too strong flavor. It was not balanced well with other ingredients. BBQ cheddar and bacon burger was okay. Sauce was good but a little salty and patty was a bit dry. Still like their soft bun and crispy french fries. Somewhat upgrade version of fast food burger but still can do better!"}
{"text":"o-m-g! When it is 2am and you are starving, this place is GOLDEN! The cheese oozing burger was to-die-for! The shakes were ahhhMaZING! It is so great to have a decent meal in vegas that will not cost you an arm and a leg and is good! I would highly recommend this place! Head over towards NYNY to find this amazing burger joint!"}
{"text":"Finally, I've had the chance to try out New York's pride and joy burger joint. And how fitting of it to be located outside of NYNY on the Strip. It's hard to miss, all green and lit up. For such a popular 'Hot & New' place, it was surprisingly uncrowded and line-less at the register. Ah, the benefits of visiting Vegas when it's not peak season...

We ordered the ShackBurger, SmokeShack, fries, and milkshakes, which all was about 10 minute wait on the buzzers. My burger, the SmokeShack, was okay. I do love bacon on my burgers and theirs was good, but I felt that the peppers were overpowering and took away from the patty juice. Sidenote: is it me or does the water in Vegas have a funny aftertaste? Luckily we got milkshakes, which were okay--the chocolate was much better than their Smores custard of the week)--but cost just as much as the burgers. They did serve out crispy, good crinkle cut fries (which usually aren't my preferred style). 

Shake Shack Las Vegas wouldn't be my first choice to dine at on the Strip, but it was a decent visit when trying out the brand. I'm not quite on board with the price to quality ratio, though, so 3.5 stars for me.

Disclaimer: My guest from the UK convinced me to bump up my 3.5 to a 4, mostly because this was \"the best fast food burger I've ever had\" and we ended up going again the next day. I tried the ShackMeister Burger that time, which was much better. The crispy shallots were a nice compliment to a more balanced flavor on the burger. Though spacious, there was a weird indoor smell, so we moved out onto the patio to sit both times."}
{"text":"We finally got a chance to come here last Sunday night. Got here around 8 PM and line was long but it moved fairly quickly. The guy who took our order had his finger in his ear for about three seconds,  and when I saw that I was saying to myself that I hope he doesn't handle our food which he didn't. 

My boyfriend and I both got the Smoke Stack burgers with fries. Took about 10 minutes for our food. The single stack burger was quite small but very tasty. The fries were ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"Shake Shack had a long line out the door when we arrived for dinner on a weeknight.  This gave us plenty of time to peruse the menu to pick out what we wanted.

We ordered and then waited another 10-15 minutes before our food was ready.  A good strategy to have would be to have one person order and the other go hunt down a seat to avoid a fist fight.  The dining room is fairly large but people were packed in there like sardines.  

I ordered a single Shack Burger with cheese and cheese fries.  The burger had really nice flavor and was cooked to my liking.  The burger was very small...that was one downside.  The cheese fries were okay.  If I ever visit again...I agree with another Yelper...order two burgers and skip the fries.  Milkshake and concrete weren't very special.

Shake Shack serves up a legit burger, but the overall experience was not worth the hype, price, or wait time to eat."}
{"text":"Well, have finally made it to the Shake Shack! Got the Double BBQ Smoke Stack. Good Burger, But to me an average burger. got the Cheese fries and the Fifty-Fifty, there take on the Arnold Palmer, which was not bad. Which brings me to a 3 star. The burger was good but average good. the only other disappointment was the cost. Burger, Fries and Drink was 18 bucks, and to me I cant see paying that much for an average Burger."}
{"text":"My first impression of Shake Shake is that it is a fancier version of In-N-Out. The price point is higher. The setting is fancier (TVs, fireplaces, etc). The food quality is just as good. 

I opted for the single Shack Burger - good size, bread is a little sweet, and meat was very flavorful - and a side of fries - really crispy and good. A friend got the cheese fries and said they weren't worth it. 

Seating can be a little hard to come by at this location. You kind of have to hover around and swoop in when someone leaves. 

Overall, Shake Shack is a solid fast-casual option on the strip - better than spending $14 on a burger at some of the fancier burger places, and better than eating overpriced food court food."}
{"text":"Okay, so here's the thing about New Yorkers. They overhype everything from New York. They have to! When you're paying $3,800 a month for a 200-square foot \"efficiency\" where you're peeing and washing your dishes in the same sink, there has to be something special about your surroundings in order to justify it.

Well. Shake Shack is one of those rare New York things that actually is every bit as good as New Yorkers tell you it is.

The burgers are incredible. The Smoke Shack, in particular, with cheese, bacon, cherry peppers and Shack sauce, is great. The Chicken Shack is really good too, as are the hot dogs and cheese fries.

The Jackpot concrete, with crispy Belgian waffles, strawberry goo and sprinkles, is worth blowing your diet. Like you didn't already with the burgers and cheese fries."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My first time visiting Shake Shack was in Las Vegas. I had heard about this small chain but never tried it because there aren't any locations in my home state. Luckily this brand is gradually expanding and openly welcomes customer feedback (suggestions, praise, complaints). During the course of my 3 day vacation I dined here twice. They are open later on weekends so that was very convenient since we don't always eat at typical meal times when in Vegas.

Per my sister's recommendation, I tried the shake stack which is a traditional burger with a unique addition. Nestled in the middle of my burger was a fried portobello mushroom with gooey cheese that oozed out when bitten. If you aren't a fan of mushrooms you can order a regular burger, and if you're a vegetarian they have a burger with all of that minus the beef patty.

Word of caution, be sure to wait before taking a bite! Everything is made fresh from the moment you place your order. If you're an avid fan of fried food then you're all too familiar with the sensation of hot oil burning the roof of your mouth. The portobello mushroom is no different! Not only is the crispy crust emitting heat, but the mushroom and cheese inside are piping hot too. I wasn't given this warning before my first big chomp and quickly regretted my impatient stomach's desire to eat right away. This may not be a tactic that everyone would agree with, but my second time around I pressed down on my burger to squish the mushroom center enough to burst the crispy outer crust. Yes, cheese came oozing out immediately, but it allowed my food to cool down faster so that I could eat sooner :)

If you're ever in the Las Vegas area do your stomach and palate a favor and eat at Shake Shack! Here is a useful or maybe not useful list of all the lucky states/state capital that have been blessed with SS locations (Maryland, New York, Texas, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and DC)

Until my next trip, I will be impatiently waiting for them to takeover in California :/"}
{"text":"Still 3 stars. 

Came ahead of what - presumably - is going to be a Friday-night dinner-rush. No line. A few occupied tables. Many of which, it turns out, had diners waiting for their meals. 10 minute ticket time. Not bad. But, even though cooked to order, seems slower than it could be. Actually much better than my first experience. But, there was a long line that time.

The place is spotless which cannot be overstated. Too many fast food \"restaurants\" that are far from clean. Friendly staff. Time to lean? Yup. Time to clean! They were on it. Their self-serve condiment bar was fully stocked. The dining area and what I could see of the kitchen were clean, too.

I had a single ShackBurger and small fries. $9. Not cheap! But, OK. And, here's why: the burger had a nice grill flavor and was cooked medium rare. Fresh lettuce and a tasty slice of tomato. I don't like what they use for cheese - it reminds me of melted Velveta. Not usually a fan of crinkle fries for a lot of reasons. These were OK, though. Good amount of salt. Good amount of crispiness. And, the oil used was clean. But, crinkle fries fall apart easily IMO. These were no exception.

I'm not a fan of custard in any form. So I skipped the shake, the Concrete and the whatever else. It's an east coast thing. I get it. I'm Surf City, dude. Gimmee ice cream. The higher the butter fat, the happier I am. Skipping this cut my ticket cost nearly in half.

Not sure I'd come back if there was a line. I'll be back but it won't be a priority lunch stop, either. I see this more for lunch than dinner. So, for me, though I like a brew with a burger, that's not happening for lunch.

I hope they find a following of Raving Fans to support them. Uptown deserves this kind of boost. So, NYC to PHX: time to represent."}
{"text":"A few years back, during a 2 week trip back East, me and my buddy hit up 2 different Shake Shacks.  We hit up one in Washington DC and another one in Philadelphia, PA.  At the time, I had never been to one before.  Once I sampled it, I thought it was one of the best fast food burgers I had ever tried and couldn't wait to try another one.  Everything was pretty much perfect!  The only thing I didn't really like was the price.  They do use great, high quality ingredients, but you definitely pay for it.  Better bring a $20.00 bill and expect maybe a few bucks back.  Anyways.......on to present day.

I had heard rumors that Shake Shack was going to open 2 locations in the Phoenix area (About damn time!) in early 2016.  They opened their first restaurant a few weeks back, and were just about ready to open this one here at Uptown Plaza.  I had sent Shake Shack an email asking about when they were opening and if they had any \"sneak peek\" type days where a person could come in and try their food.  They emailed me back and told me about the \"Friends and Family Day\" and invited me down to try out some of their food a day before they opened to the public.  I drove down, checked in, was handed a menu and then placed my order for my meal.  They gave you the choice of 2 \"hot items\" and one drink/dessert.  I went with a single cheeseburger, an order of cheese fries, and a \"CamelShack\" concrete.  I gave the lady my menu, was handed my buzzer and went to grab a seat (cool building btw...open space, modern, couple of flat screens playing basketball, plus a nice outdoor patio seating area).  My food took about 10 minutes or so and here is how it was...................

Single Shack Cheeseburger-  I was a little confused when I ordered my burger.  At my previous visits, I ordered a Double Shack Cheeseburger and a Double Smoke Shack Burger and they came with everything on them (lettuce, tomato, sauce etc).  I asked her if I could get light on the shack sauce, and she replied, \"I could make my burger any way I wanted.\"  I took that to mean I could remove the ingredients that automatically came on it.  So I told her just plain, no sauce.  What I got was a plain cheeseburger.  Bun, meat and cheese.  I was not mad though...I love plain cheeseburgers and sometimes less is better.  (Shake Shack does use good produce though!).  I bit into my burger and noticed that it was just kind of warm.  Not piping hot, not cold, just warm.  It was cooked more towards well done, but it was still juicy and moist.  The cheese was melted nicely, and then bun is flat out awesome.  Shake Shack buns are the best!  Super soft, pillowy, with a great texture...I love them.  Best fast food buns out there!  The burger was ok but I would have liked it hotter, and if I was buying it myself, I would have went with a double (A double was not an option on the friends and family menu).  3 stars for the burger.

Cheese Fries- On past visits, I raved on how much I loved the cheese fries.  They use a great cheese sauce and cover a pile of crinkle cut fries with this delicious sauce.  Today, the cheese sauce was just as good as I had remembered!  The fries though...meh.  They weren't that great.  They seemed a little bit stale and weren't that crisp (even ones without cheese sauce, so I know it wasn't due to the cheese sauce).  I ate them all because of the cheese sauce.  If they were just a plain order of fries, I would have been disappointed.  3 stars for the fries.

CamelShack Concrete-  Wow!  The best!  Super impressed with this one!  I am a sucker for ice cream and sweets, so this was right up my alley.  Its vanilla custard, salted caramel sauce, and a slice of The Bakery Phx banana cream pie smashed in there.  It was awesome!  The custard was rich and creamy, the salted caramel sauce provided a nice sweetness, and the chunks of bananas and pie crust pieces really tied it together.  This particular dessert is also beneficial to others in the city of Phoenix, too.  Shake Shack donates 5% of their proceeds from this dessert to charity in the Phoenix area.  Good job, Shake Shack!  5 stars for the CamelShack!

I finished my meal and was outta there!  Overall, it was not nearly as good as my first 2 encounters at a Shake Shack.  It was their first day though, so they may need to work through some kinks.  I do appreciate the hell out of the invite down here,  and the free lunch!  Saying that, if I had to pay $15.00 for this lunch, and if this was my first time ever at a Shake Shack, I would have left a little disappointed and probably wouldn't be fixing to come back anytime soon.  Because I know how good their food can be though, I will be back in due time to see if this Shack can become as good as the others before it!  I'm sure it can get up 4 to 5 star territory!  Welcome to Phoenix, Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"Had a dinner during my weekend getaway over MLK weekend. We were lucky enough that we don't need to wait for order and get a seat (it is fast food style). Shack Burger is good (Bacon burger is other story), fries are OK, beer is wonderful. I am kind of debating between 4 or 5 stars due to a little bit loudly environment for this but consider the location and I got a good time there so 5 stars as is."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this burger place for awhile now and finally got the chance. We were quite happy with our experience. We got here on a weekday around 2p, so its after the lunch and the place was not crowded at all. You place your order they give you a buzzer and you wait at the table until it buzzes. 

 I knew I was getting the Shroom burger and a shake, that's all I had been wanting since knowing about this place. My daughter got the Shack burger which is their take on a cheeseburger with their special sauce.
I didn't know what kind of shake to get since they all looked good, and so I asked the cashier what he would recommend. He said salted caramel and that's all it took because I was leaning towards that flavor. It did not disappoint! Next time I will try the Marshmallow chocolate chip if its still available as its a limited time flavor. 

The Shroom burger came with a warning sticker that it was Hot. It didn't register to me why, because shouldn't all burgers be hot? well, when I took my first bite, I realize why. The cheese that comes oozing out of the middle! I almost burnt my lips off! hahaha! I'll never make that mistake again. Needless to say, I had to let it cool off with a little bit of shake. Once it got to a decent eating temperature I was quite pleased. I like how the portobello mushroom is lightly breaded and cooked crisp. The melted cheese is held in by the breading. 

I was a little surprised at the size of the burgers when they came out. To me, they weren't full sized burgers nor were they sliders. It was in between. Like the size of a whopper junior. It was perfect size for me and my daughter and we shared an order of fries which were also cooked to a nice crisp. there was not one soggy fry.  We left here feeling satisfied and also noticed the restaurant had gotten full. Can't wait for the next trip back!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out is #1 butttttttt Shake Shack can be a #2 (and so can 5 guys).    

Location is in the district and not far from Green Valley Resort (walking distance).   The food tastes exactly the same as the other Shake Shack locations.   What is nice is that it's really easy to get to off the freeway if you're in the Henderson area.   

As far as what I get?   That depends.  I like the buns on their burgers and the shakes are great.     A quality burger that you can't really go wrong with."}
{"text":"This is the most western outpost of the NY chain Shake Shack.  My wife likes this place much more than In-N-Out.   Personally I think In-N-Out is better.  In the end, it doesn't matter since both places make an excellent burger. 

If you're the first time ordering and you like spicy, I would suggest a Shake with chilies (it's more of a relish).   It's OUT OF THIS WORLD.   Personally, I'm drooling when I think about it.   Also there shakes are pretty darn good (try them all).   A little more on the pricey end of a fast foodish burger place but you won't be disappointed.

Get the: Shake with chillies (off menu, have to ask for it)"}
{"text":"I didn't think they would renovate the North Outlet, but lo and behold! I come back to Vegas one year later and I see a brand new Shake Shack open for business at the very front of the outlet. I've heard all about the hype about Shake Shack in NY, but there wasn't an opportunity for me to go out and try it so easily...until now!

I've tried the cheeseburger, cheese fries, and strawberry milkshake. Wow, the cheeseburger and milkshakes here are BOMB. The burgers themselves are kind of smaller than usual, but they're so flavorful that I think it's the perfect size. I'm a bit disappointed in the fries though, they're more on the soggier, softer side. The milkshake isn't too sweet, and it successfully quenched my inner sweets craving! 

If they had this back home where I live, I'd probably visit a lot for the milkshake...but maybe it's for the better, otherwise I'd be gaining a good 10 pounds! ;)"}
{"text":"Since the last times I've been here, I've have to say that the quality of the food has really gotten terrible. I can't remember what I said in my last review but now I can confidently say that Shake Shack comes nowhere near our good ole In N Out. 

My updated review is solely for this LV location. But yeah, seems like the quality of the food has really dropped. Basically I'd say they can now be compared to maybe a Carl's Jr or Burger King meal based on the super soggy and deflated burgers my friends and I got yesterday. The only difference would be that Shake Shack's burger costs you $8-10 when you can get a similar soggy burger at Carl's Jr for half the price. 

ALSO, the one thing that used to be my sole reason for liking this place... their cheese fries. We got one order of cheese fries and an order of regular fries and they came out almost exactly the same but the cheese fries having a little drip of cheese on like 4 French fries. lols If you're gonna sell an item whose only difference from regular fries is... cheese. Then I think you guys should actually have some cheese on the fries? 

Bleh, overall yesterday's lunch here was super disappointing, made me feel guilty for insisting our friends come here over White Castle. 

Hopefully someone from this location actually reads these reviews and tries to make some improvements, but until then... probably won't be back for awhile."}
{"text":"Came to check this out because of the hype you hear online or from word of mouth. What a disappointment. 

Burgers are like $5 and not even worth it. Don't get me wrong, the food didn't taste bad but it's just overpriced and nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I'm not ashamed to admit it - as soon as I booked my airfare, I was dead set on hitting Shake Shack for dinner on my first night in town.  Really, it's like it was meant to be - flight arrives, check in across the street at MGM Grand, watch the Warriors game, head to Shake Shack for a late dinner.  Talk about the perfect plan!   Well, except for the part where the Warriors ended up losing the game, that is...whoops.

Attached to the outside of New York New York (and right by the T-Mobile Arena), this Shake Shack is by far larger than the other two I've been to (City Center in Philly and Midtown Manhattan).  Which is fortunate, since it made getting a table super easy despite the steady crowds (they have seating inside and out).  I had figured on getting their Double ShackBurger and fries like before, but after perusing the rest of the menu, I opted to go for something different!

-- SHACKBURGER (Single) - Cheeseburger topped with American Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, and ShackSauce...$5.55
(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shake-shack-las-vegas-2?select=IuqhtFY9c5FZKl9KXC7aAg&reviewid=DeouFRFe-mp5Sji8O1ZlNw)
Though it may not have amazed like the first time, this was still quite AWESOME.  Between the buns, the juicy, flavorful patty, the fresh lettuce and tomatoes, and the slice of gooey cheese, this was super tasty.  The patty got a little oily towards the end, but this was still a fantastic burger (and seemingly larger than the one I had in Philly).

-- CHICK'N SHACK - Crispy Chicken Breast with Lettuce, Pickles, and Buttermilk Herb Mayo...$6.55
(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shake-shack-las-vegas-2?select=mAkplibTShvTNTD4Hx6Jbg&reviewid=DeouFRFe-mp5Sji8O1ZlNw)
Just a bit short of the ShackBurger, but still really solid.  Besides how big and juicy the chicken was, it was complemented nicely by the lettuce, pickles, and mayo - very classic flavors.  I liked how crispy the batter was as well, but it was a little thin and needed a little more spice/pepper to it.  

While I still waffle on whether Shake Shack or In N Out are better, I can definitely say this - I'd more than happy to come back again and again, even though it didn't amaze like my first Shake Shack experience did.  Then again, maybe it's just because this time around, I didn't have the whole \"ermahgerd I'm finally here and it tastes so good\" angle to it.  Rather, it was more like, \"ermahgerd I'm so hungry and this tastes awesome but I'm also dead tired and want to go to bed\" vibe going on.

FOUR AND A HALF STARS rounded down for now, at least until I can finally try their shakes and custards!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I went there tonight for the first time with high hopes. Needless to say those were crushed. Terrible we spent 25 dollars which was ridiculous. So greasy no flavor.... even the cashier had a bad attitude. We got the shake stack.  Usually we are easy to please but paying 25 dollars is alot for no flavor. We would have rather went to five guys or Culver's. Wish I could get my wasted money back."}
{"text":"Place was sooooooo amazing! Hands down one of the best hamburgers I've had in my life. Service was quick and amazing from the staff."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, really.  I think they're overpriced and you could easily get the same quality burger from Five Guys without spending that much money.  

I ordered the smokestack with all the fresh veggies and  without peppers cus it was cheaper than ordering a regular burger and adding bacon. We also got a side of cheesy fries which can easily feed two folks.  

It's pretty much self serve after you order at the counter so I can't say much about the service. They do have a nice variety of tasty lemonade available,  so definitely give those a try."}
{"text":"This is my second visit as the first one 3 months ago was not good on service.  I revisited this past week and found the place buzzing with super staffing and service!  I had a mushroom burger which was fantastic.  If you order, be careful of the hot cheese stuffed inside the mushroom.  Fries are very tasty too.  Great family stop when shopping."}
{"text":"Not great for the price. I'm not a huge fan of a-la-carte dining, but when a girlfriend recommended the shakes we had to try it out. 2 burgers, 2 fries, custard blizzard thing, & chocolate shake - $32. The portions were small for the price. The fries were the star of the show. Shake was not thick. Custard thing was too thick. Burger wasn't anything special. Fries were definitely on point!"}
{"text":"When the best thing I had was the Abita root beer.. there's a problem.

Cheeseburger was horribly over salted. Finished it because I was hungry, but I'm glad I got the root beer to help with that salt. I'll spend the extra money to get a burger at Holstein's any day.

After finishing the burger, got back in line for custard. I've heard so much about their custard that I had to try it. I missed out on trying it in NY when the line was over 50 deep.

First off, huge debacle for trying to order a \"Shack Attack\" with vanilla instead of chocolate custard. I've worked fast food before and it isn't hard to ring up a substitution. Except the guy at the register had no clue what he was doing and rung it up as a create your own that cost almost $2 more.. and he wouldn't budge from it. OK, fine. I cancel that and just order a small vanilla custard.

Worst vanilla custard I have ever had. Lack of flavor or creaminess. Thought I was eating milk ice cream. I'm familiar to good custard having been introduced to Kopps & Culver's in Milwaukee. Even BurgerFi has better custard.

I came for the custard and left horribly disappointed.

2 stars for the Abita and the non-register customer service. The people cleaning the tables are as friendly as ever."}
{"text":"Came here in the evening and was pretty excited to try the Shake Stack. The one that has the burger and the mushroom. I ordered it and received a very good burger. I don't think I can really say anything bad about the burger but I am not sure it is really worth $10. Minus a star for price.... other than that I may be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since it's close to my job and a lot closer than the one at Downtown Summerlin. It's the strip so long lines and a wait are to be expected, but the service at this location is poor. After waiting to place your order, you're still looking at a decent wait to receive your food. I had to wait 30 minutes after I had ordered once just to get two shack burgers and a drink. I understand having to wait a little, but the food should be hot at the very least. More often than not the burger comes out cold and I've had to send it back.  The most recent time I went, which was earlier this week, I had to send my food back twice. The first time the patty was cold and the second time the bun was almost frozen.  They are pretty good about replacing your food quickly though. 

Overall, the quality of the ingredients they use in their food is good, portions are small, price is on the high side, service is poor, burgers seem undercooked, and there are long waits to both place orders and receive food. It's just too much of an inconvenience and too big of a hassle for me to keep going here and I really wouldn't recommend this place until there is improvement in relation to some of the above-mentioned critiques. 

I've heard that they're opening one up in Henderson later this year. I might give that a try and see how it goes."}
{"text":"I love the Shake Shack in NYC. I love it in Miami, and I nearly cried when I heard they were coming to my neighborhood. I'm a big fan of Danny Meyer (plus he is originally from St. Louis - my hometown - and I love my fellow St. Louisans) and a huge fan of his cheese fries, chicken sandwich and the Camelshack. I love the burger too, but the chicken is heavenly. Icing on the cake, they also love my dogs and make sure to have nice items on the menu for them, too. Plus, I love beer. They have beer, you guys. I can't drink it at the moment because I'm pregnant, but I love that it is there waiting for me. Already planning my baby boy's inaugural visit (sure he can't eat it for a while, but if mommy's happy, everyone is happy and Shake Shack makes mommy very happy). Thanks for bringing it to us, St. Danny Meyer! Keep doing what you do - you do it well."}
{"text":"Descent section of draft beers both domestic and imports.  16 and 32 oz size.  Burgers have good flavor but are lacking in size.  Crinkle fries and cooked with good seasoning.  Fun upbeat light atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Shake Shack and I love that a NY business is located conveniently near the New York New York Hotel. The burgers were tasty and fresh. The fries were crunchy. The shakes were creamy and delicious but not overpowering on the sweetness level. The food came out relatively quick for it being busy all the time.

While I am a die hard In-N-Out fan, I will say that Shake Shack has the better fries but In-N-Out has the better deal. At first, I thought the price was expensive because it was in Vegas and in Vegas, a bottle water from Starbucks costs $6. However, it does cost that high even in its home state of NY (tried it over the summer since they were located everywhere) I get more for my money at In-N-Out so I prefer that. So sad that neither one is located in Denver."}
{"text":"I liked this location because it was not busy, free  parking and it was nice and clean. The workers were nice and the food came out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Very good experience thus far, been here twice. The first time I ordered a hot chocolate, and shack-cago dog and fries. The hot dog was very good. The second time I had a shack burger, coffee shake and fries, very good as well. I would recommend the hot dog over the burger, it was just more exciting. But overall 10/10 very good!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack on the West Coast? HECK YAAA!

On my latest trip to LV I made it a point to get my fix of cheesy fries :) I also got the SmokeShack which has hot cherry peppers and bacon. 

It was delicious, oh so delicious....but when did SS get so pricey? I wanted to get a double burger but it was almost $10! Still good but the prices make me feel a bit gouged for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Decent fast food burger, nothing out of this world. I first had Shake Shack in NYC a few years ago and thought it was incredible. Not sure if the Vegas location is different, but I was disappointed this time around. The burgers are tasty, but a bit small - next time I'd get a double patty. The fries are basic crinkle-cut fries, nothing special. Also, the price is pretty high for a fast food place. Overall, in comparison to other similar burger fast food places like In-N-Out, it just doesn't hold up. 

Tip: Wait to get your meal before you sit outside. They give you a buzzer, but mine never went off even though my food was ready. When I went back to check, my burger and fries had been sitting there for ten minutes and were cold."}
{"text":"It's a petty cool place. There is a variety of food and drinks. The burgers are relatively small, but they are certainly satisfying for adding a different twist to a normal burger, making it more special than other burger chains like in-n-out or MacD."}
{"text":"I'm an Asian dude and burgers are not my favorite food to eat but the Shake Shack is different. I come here once or twice a month. One of the best for sure."}
{"text":"Not only taste good but it uses no anti biotic
meat. I eat shake shack at least once a month, and I'm not fat."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  Bang Bang Burgers and Five  Guys is so much better all the way around. Not impressed, total chaos. They are super slow and the staff take their breaks at tables where customers could be sitting.  Also, my order was wrong and the line was too long to have them correct it so they made an extra buck off me for nothing!! Lol"}
{"text":"Best burger chain for sure! Last trip to Vegas I ate here and also had a $25 burger at another high end burger restaurant. I would have a hard time taking that burger over my shake shack burger, regardless of price! This is now my go to for good food in Vegas. I like both the shack burger and the smoke shack. I can't pick a favorite but I really like sauce and the chilies on the smoke shack. Their cheese fries are good and if you can fit in a shake too, it's worth it.

I love in n out but I can't for the life of me understand why some people claim to like it better"}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good. I got some fries, a lemonade, and a chicken sandwich. When I was eating the chicken sandwich everything was fine until I found a hair in my food. Also the chicken was dry and greasy. I would rate the chicken sandwich a 2 and the rest a 5."}
{"text":"Shake shack has a really cool concept. I was in Las Vegas for a one nighter and walked by thinking I have to try this place I've heard so much about. Got the shake shack stack with the fries mushroom and burger with the crinkle fries. The price for portion was decent. The food came out quick as each burger was made to order. Biting into my burger it was scorching hot (temp) I loved the freshness. All though I like the mushroom on the burger I think I'd prefer them separately as the shroom didn't break as you're biting into it causing a bit of a mess. Although the combination worked fine it got messy. Lastly I'd go without the sauce. Given it lacked a bit of taste to me. Overall great place for a burger, very big space and has several drink options. I'd like to go back and try a few other items as I had to get up and work early the next day."}
{"text":"In my opinion, there's two types of burgers. Your fast food joint and your gourmet. Each deserves some sort of respect... And I'm not talking about Mickey D's or Burger King. Shake shack's burgers are super flavorful and their shacksauce is their money maker. I'm not talking in n out's \"spread\" (don't get me wrong, in n out will still hold a special place in my heart). The shack sauce is somewhat of an aioli and I LOVE aioli. If you're feeling frisky, get the shack stack. It's the shroom burger WITH a patty. Umm yes please! Also get a side of their cheese fries. I'm a sucker for the gooey cheese. I got the creamsicle as well. Orange soda float. Tickled my taste buds back to the third grade. I can't wait till they open the one in Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"Just as good as the New York locations. Great tasting burger and the concrete was gooood.  Since they're new in town and everyone is working furiously, the line moves fast. If you want to avoid lines, stay away after 5 on weekdays and all day on weekends until the novelty wears off. They also have an app where you can pre-order and cut the line. 
Bottom line, enjoy the good burgers."}
{"text":"What I had:
- Shackburger ($8.35)
- Cheese Fries ($3.99)
- Vanilla Shake ($5.39)

How it tasted:
- It was good.  This place seemed over-hyped, however it did provide a satisfactory experience.  I enjoyed the burger, fries, and shake.  On the other hand, I have enjoyed my meals from In-N-Out equally, if not more, than Shake-Shack.

Why did I give it a four?
- Good experience, but considering the typical wait and overall taste, I'd say it was satisfactory.  Perhaps a second visit will make this experience stand as above average.

Verdict?
- Try it out."}
{"text":"I usually come to Shake Shack for their burgers, cheese fries and milkshakes (which are all great), but tonight I decided to try the Chick'n shack sandwich. I was pleasantly surprised! It was probably the best chicken sandwich I've had!! Crunchy fried chicken breast (not dry, fried hard), seasoned well, soft bread, pickles, lettuce & an herb mayo...quite tasty!! Sooo good!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack in DT Summerlin is a great lunch/dinner spot. The prices are a little high, but the food is great. You order before choosing whether to sit inside/outside. It gets pretty packed on the weekends, but on the weekdays it's a very relaxing lunch experience. The chicken is wonderful and I definitely recommend it. The cheese fries are also great, and I usually share them with my lunch date. Prepare to spend a little more than your typical burger joint."}
{"text":"Great burger and fries. Every time. Not much to say just that the BBQ bacon burger is delicious, the cheese fries are worth it, and the strawberry shake is so good. Fast service and always correct"}
{"text":"Loving that I have the taste of NY so close to home.  Shake Shack is a delicious chain based out of NY.  

I love the crinkle cut fries, the tasty hamburgers, the crispy chicken sandwiches and there Mushroom Juicy Lucy Burger, which is melted cheese in between (2) pieces of fried Portobello.

The prices are a bit higher compared to other fast food burgers, but I think the food itself is better than your typical burger joint.

My wife really enjoys the Mushroom \"Juicy Lucy\" Burger as she is a Vegetarian, but says it's so hardy it reminds her of a yummy burger.

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Salty crinkle-cut fries? Check. Creamy chocolate custard shake? Check. Perfectly cooked cheeseburger with fresh veggies, amazing sauce and pillowy bun? Check, check-ity, checky check.

And to top it off, the line goes quickly and they keep the place clean. Bonus points for awesome branding and swag, too.

In-N-Out will always hold a special place in my heart, but Shake Shack is moving in next door!"}
{"text":"The cheeseburgers & fries are so delicious they even have shakes to take home for dogs I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite spots for a cheat meal.  The concrete mixers are amazing with the salted caramel sauce.  A little pricey for what you are getting, but really tasty."}
{"text":"I was so excited when news spread that they opened a location in Vegas and I have been raving about this place since I first tried it on the East coast... but the quality just isn't the same/what I remembered (and loved) from my first Shake Shack experience in D.C. :(( the food came out luke warm and it seemed very \"Blah\". If I'm paying $40 for a couple of burgers, waiting 20+ minutes for the order, & driving/parking on the dreaded Vegas strip, it better have a \"wow\" factor. Willing to try it again in a few months and see if quality control improves but I was pretty disappointed tonight."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to eat at a Shake Shack and I have to say that I am a little disappointed by the price and quantity they give you.  I paid almost $18 for a Shake Stack, fries and regular drink.  Overpriced in my book when you go get a double double meal and still have about $5 left to spare.  Taste wise, it was pretty good, but can't justify the cost for the amount they give you.  The burger itself was nicely seasoned and you can taste some fat.  It's probably a 80/20 blend.  I also enjoyed their crinkle cut fries.  It was nicely salted and crispy.  I don't know if I would come back here, but I would recommend you try it at least once."}
{"text":"Small portion and pricy. I paid $13 for a chicken shack + French fries and small drink! It tastes ok but I think it's overrated"}
{"text":"Concrete. 'Nuf said. Just kidding. Here's more. 

Stayed at New York New York for a get out of town because we're adults and we can. Had plans to drink and eat. Can't go wrong with that plan in Vegas. 

A friend of ours at work swears by this place and since it was right next door...

Had the smoke shack. Most awesome burger. Beef with bacon, cherry peppers and shack sauce. OMG. Get one. 

Concrete for dessert. Frozen custard. Yes. Please. Thank you. Get one or two. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here...I've heard many reviews about their food in comparison to In n' Out. 

We order the Chick n' Shack, fried chicken in buttermilk batter, crinkled fries, lemonade and a Shack attack: chocolate custard, dark chocolate, and dark chocolate truffles. 

Everything we ordered was good, delicious and affordable. It was worth a try. Next time I'll try a hamburger to compare it to In n' Out."}
{"text":"So happy this location is now open at the Downtown Summerlin location! Now I don't have to drive all the way to the Strip to get my Shake Shack fix! :D

First thing I loved was how the customer service was spot on. Everyone was seriously SO friendly! They all kept holding the door for the guests, personally handing them the menus, and just making you feel like your first time experience there is a great one! 

Now on to the food, my BF and I ordered the ShackBurger and the SmokeShack. ShackBurger was superb; it was so juicy, cheesy, and delicious that I even considered getting a second one cause it was that good! The SmokeShack was good but the cherry peppers made it too sweet for my liking. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant was really nice! They have an outside patio where my BF and I enjoyed our meal since we had our puppy with us. One employee was even nice enough to give our pup a Shake Shack dog biscuit! He gobbled it right up. We thought it was so sweet for her to do that! 

Definitely recommend this place if you want to enjoy a delicious a antibiotic-free, hormone-free burger with a wonderful atmosphere and excellent customer service! :)"}
{"text":"Cherry peppers on the burger are great!  Their shakes are awesome and the burgers are the best you're going to get from a fast casual restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best I've tasted.  I ordered a Chick N Shack chicken sandwich.  The chicken was crispy, the lettuce, pickles and sauce complimented the sandwhich. Awesome bun too.
I didn't order a burger, but took a bite of the Cheddar Bacon burger.  That was amazing.  Going to get that next time.
I also ordered the crinkle fries which was so good.
Next time you are in Vegas, you should definitely stop by."}
{"text":"First, my disclaimer:  I'm NOT a burger person.  

My friends and I came to this place at the start of the year.  The place is new and everyone raves about it.  I figure I'd try the place out.  I ordered one burger with fries and an ice cream cup.  The bill came to $18.  For that price, I could have gotten three double doubles at In n Out and had a GREAT meal.  Their burger is about the size of an item on the McDonald's dollar menu with a little bit of extra secret sauce.  The ice cream was horrible.  I must have ordered the wrong thing because I could have gotten that cup for $1 at McDonald's and add in some dark chocolate chips.  My friend who really enjoys food, didn't think it was great either.  None of us will return to that place as the food and desserts are way overpriced."}
{"text":"In-N-Out: Undisputed, affordable for good portion of a simply delicious burger. 

As many has written, it's impossible not to compare the two. FINALLY after almost 4 hours of driving from LA, we had reached our first and holy destination that is SHAKE SHACK. There were people, but the line was super short, at most only had 2 people head of us. Yay for us!

FOOD:
Ordered a regular protein hamburger (still charged as a regular hamburger at $4.16+ tax is about $4.50) already double of what an In-N-Out Double Meat Protein burger costs. Opted out of double patty at Shake Shack since that was $7.00. Portion and presentation were super lackluster, BUT they hella sold me when I took that first bite. GOOD LAWD. Literally felt like someone punched me in the face with bag full of godly flavors. I had to look around to see if my tongue was trippin' on me. The size might've been small, but fawwwk that is some deliciously cooked patty. But sadly the flavor itself couldn't save the fact that I was still starving afterwards.

Shake Shack is definitely good, but for the price- doesn't feel like good value for what I'm paying for. But still cheap eats in Vegas if you're on a budget."}
{"text":"My Aunt said that we had to eat at this place for lunch, for a Friday at around 2:30 ish the line was not that long at all. Even if it was, they had a lot of people at registers so it goes quickly. The workers were very nice and overall a very clean restaurant. I got a ShackBurger Single and it didn't taste like anything special but the sauce is delicious. I was going to give it three stars, but the French fries deserve their own star haha. Probably the best fries I have ever eaten. They have large picnic tables outside, while inside the seating is limited to 2-4 people tables. My sister had a hotdog and she said it tasted very good. Prices seemed average. They also had water coolers full of ice water which was nice to fill my water bottle up with."}
{"text":"Not much to say that hasn't already been said, had the double cheese burger, awesome! Just the right ratio of fat/meat grilled perfect. I love In-N-Out but the fries at Shake Shack (in my opinion) are better. 
Overall, quality food when you want a burger."}
{"text":"Loved the Chicken Sandwich! Light and crispy breading ... pickles delicious... o and try Mud Pie shake! :) definitely will go back when back in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Everyone from the west coast makes a trip here to compare to our favorite In and Out, and I did the same. We ordered the most basic items (Shack Burger and Cheese Fries), and they were pretty good. If you're not a fan of processed cheese, skip the cheese on the fries. 

Burgers were juicy, and their crinkle cut fries were delicious. Pricing is more expensive than in and Out, but still one of the most popular/affordable eats on the strip. They also serve beer!"}
{"text":"A will review Shake Shack in the form of a Haiku:

Please come to our state"}
{"text":"Shake Shake, Shake Shack, Shake Shack.... what can I say. Your burgers are so delicious, your frozen custard is like a breath of fresh air on a humid summer day. This was my second Shake Shack experience and it was as good as the first. I ordered their Bacon, White Cheddar Burger with all the fixings except for onions and I savored every morsel, in like 2 minutes, lol. It was so good and gone from my fingers too fast. I also had a side of fries. Crinkled cut these fries are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and worth the diet I broke to eat here. My husband ordered the Double Down Fries which feature melted cheddar cheese, bacon and chopped red peppers and they were just alright, nothing to brag about and something I don't think he'll order again. 

For dessert I had their Blueberry Lemon Custard, their seasonal flavor of the day and it was wonderful. The flavor combination was perfectly balanced so that you could actually taste both the blueberry and lemon flavor. I'm looking forward to the day Shake Shack opens up in the Bay Area but until then, Vegas it is."}
{"text":"I haft to say...many people hyped this place up for me and I feel somewhat let down...Not sure what differentiates this place from all the others that saturate the market as is... No combos, no ranch and average service. It must be the shakes which I did not get because I was worried I wouldnt have room but was again dissapointed at the small burger size...No wonder people order a double..."}
{"text":"Prices are way too high for what you get: small servings, long wait, below average burger. Go to In-n-out instead. Better in every way. My date and I ended up going to another restaurant directly following visiting this location because we were both unsatisfied with the small portions and didn't want to wait for another order."}
{"text":"My bestie and I stayed at MGM Grand this past weekend (Nov 4, 2016 - Nov 7, 2016) to celebrate her 26th birthday and we gave this place a try. The line was long but moved fast and the place was clean. The staff was also nice and the food was absolutely delicious! The hamburger tasted real and was cooked well, the buns were soft and buttery, the bacon was thick and not too crispy, the fries were just right, everything was cooked to order and hot, and their shakes also tasted as if made with real, natural ingredients (we both tried the strawberry). Highly recommend this place if you're looking to enjoy a burger and fries and possibly a shake!"}
{"text":"Good food, lines are too long, so yeah. Do you really want to wait 30 minuntes? up to you"}
{"text":"Can Shake Shack please move to more places on the west coast? Definitely gives In N Out a run for their money and I've never been anywhere they weren't SLAMMED with people waiting for delicious burgers. Their fries are better than any other fast food spot and I love their vegetarian options and local concretes. Plus booze? Sign me up."}
{"text":"Food is good service is so slow... No line but still waited 15 minutes for the food to come out. I saw other customers get wrong orders on their food. The people that prepare the food need to be faster, I saw plenty of food that was ready to go."}
{"text":"Nom Nom Nom Nom!!! Get in my belly!
There is something the the Shake Shack is doing right for them to get such a long line of customers waiting to get their hands on their burgers. I believe its their secret shake shak sauce. I've never tasted anything like it. The burger was perfectly cooked and seasoned served on a warm and toasted bun. The best part is the sauce. 
If you do not believe me then TRY IT. I still dream of it.

This location has become our office lunch staple."}
{"text":"Finally! Shake shack opened their doors! It has a very nice interior and patio sitting. Its located between  outside of nyny and monte carlo, so its way better to park at nyny and go through the food court. 

Best burger ive had in east side and finally now here in vegas!!! I highly recommend the SHAKE STACK and second the SHROOM BURGER. i love how the cheese will oooooozzzeee out once you bite onto your burger, one word, BOMBDIGGITTY! 

Also, their staff was very attentive and friendly! Please keep it up guys! Good service good food! ;)"}
{"text":"The best!! Been wanting to try them since my foodie friends have been posting them.  I'm so glad they opened one while I was in Vegas.   The burgers were excellent and the shack sauce was delicious.   I love the cheese fries. Tried the salted caramel frozen pudding. It was creamy.  I took 1 star off because they only have Red Velvet on the 3rd week of the month.  I was pretty disappointed on that cuz I really wanted try it.   They need to open one up in LA, ASAP so I can try the red velvet.   Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Greatvlaye night option. Priced right and tasty. Burgers took some time to come out, but they tasted great. Hubby loved the mushroom in his burger."}
{"text":"Average burgers, I find them a bit pricey. Shakes are tasty but, again, for the price I would at least expect the cup to be filled. Not the cheapest, quickest, or best in Vegas. To each their own."}
{"text":"Shake Shack does it right! The burger is delicious. The fries remained crispy despite my hike back to my hotel. I could eat here everyday while I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Shake Shack in NY yet, but was happy that I had an opportunity to try Shake Shack in Vegas at NY, NY. We went with my parents during off peak hours, so the line was pretty short and moving. My parents have been to Shake Shack many times and are familiar with the menu. My hubby and I had the double ShackBurger - cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce. Hubby had the crinkle cut fries while I had the cheese fries - crinkle cut fries topped with special blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce. I had the black & white shake - vanilla & chocolate. Next time I want to try the caramel or coffee fair shake or their frozen custard. Our daughter had the single Shackburger, crinkle cut fries and caramel shake. I like Shake Shack better than In & Out because the burgers are thicker and the buns are soft and sweet. Shake Shack serves 100% all-natural Angus beef burgers with no hormones and no antibiotics, veggie burgers, 'shroom burgers, hot dogs, fries, frozen custard, drinks, beer and wine and even doggie treats for your dog. Shake Shake will always be on my list when I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"The burgers are very similar to Culver's in taste. However in size & price, they are very different. The burgers are tiny & are extremely overpriced, $8.55 for a single burger with no sides. The buns look like they were purchased from the dollar store. 
It isn't that the food is bad, just really overpriced & underwhelming. If your looking for a burger place there are plenty of better cheaper options out there; Five Guys, In N Out, Habit, Culver's, etc..."}
{"text":"My first shake shack experience was in New York, I heard people claiming it was better than in n out burger so I had to try it. The thing is it comes damn close! Their burgers are deliciously satisfying. The atmosphere is awesome. Really nice music and they have cute little tables with logs as seats! How fun. I got the shroom burger which was a crispy fried portobello mushroom filled with cheese. Yummy! They have more than burgers, they have hot dogs too. 

Pros: vegetarian options! they serve beer and wine. location is great. crinkle cut fries are classic and bomb! they also have frozen custard. And of course the atmosphere 

Cons: NONE :) 

Would I come back? Always! 

Tips: the peanut butter milkshake is a must try! also the burgers are always cooked medium but you can ask them to cook if differently."}
{"text":"The shakes were nothing to brag about.  We stopped in here for a shake on a hot day.  I am only giving the 3 stars because the prices are too high for what they offer."}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  We just had shakes and no food.  Yummy shakes.  Glad I stopped in to check out this place.  Thanks"}
{"text":"This review I actually give them 3.5/5 shake shack I believe is pretty overhyped. I would say if you are just coming in for a casual regular burger and fries the overall price for the meal is overpriced and quality is not up to par with the price tag that comes along. However if you come for the shroom burger and their shakes, which is a lot pricer than your usual burger then yeah shake shack would get 4/5 stars but other than that, this is not something I'd come back for. We ordered bacon cheese fries, a hamburger, and a double shack. Total came out to be around 21$.  

Bacon cheese fries: 4/5 this was pretty good for the taste of it. Your average crinkle cut fries and creamy cheese sauce similar to nachoooo cheese without the pepper taste. For the price tho and the amount they give you, it's overall eh. 

Hamburger 3.5/5: nothing special about this. It came out to almost 5$ for just a regular patty and burger. The meat was juicy though and the bread soft and chewy. 

Double shack 4/5: with the cheese and the double meat, this burger was quiteeeee juicy. I think this is a good comparison to in-n-outs double double but overall in-n-out wins with price and quality. Can't beat that. 

To sum up, shake shack is good, not spectacular. Is it overpriced? Yes for sure. Is it something I'd eat often like in-n-out? No lol. Come here if you are in the mood for a shroom burger or something that's worth your money but other than that a reg burger here isn't worth the price, I'd just stick to in-n-out."}
{"text":"A coworker of mine recommended this place. She told me about how she prefers this place than In-n-out, so of course, knowing how much of a food junkie I am, I definitely had to try this place out. 

My aunty and I came here for lunch and I ordered the single smokedstack and bacon cheese fries. I must say, I was very surprised how much I liked the burger and fries. The sauce that they used for the burger was delicious and the fries were just amazing. I would definitely come back here if I am ever craving a burger!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Shake Shack to come to the West Coast ever since I first laid my lips on the Smoke Shack in New York in 2013. I can't believe my prayers were answered and they opened one in Vegas!! On my most recent visit to Vegas, I just had to pay a visit to the Shake Shack at NY-NY hotel. 

I ordered the SmokeShack - single cheeseburger with smoked bacon, chopped cherry peppers, and ShackSauce. I thought the burger was aite... I think the original NY location/version is better. It was enough to curb my craving, but not nearly enough to compare to New York's version unfortunately. 

I got their signature fries which were really good - classic golden crisp crinkle cut fries, and a strawberry milkshake which was on point too. Kevin A. was not impressed by Shack Shack Vegas and put it 3rd on his fast food burger list behind Super Duper of SF and In-n-Out (he was especially disappointed they don't have grilled onions on anything). Despite my meh experience this time, I'll be back to give it another try!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why people want to compare this place to In & Out, And when they do, I'm not sure why the Shake Shack doesn't ALWAYS win the comparison.

The line was long, but the wait was short. The service was great! The burger was seasoned well and very tasty. The bun was even better than the burger. The fries were tasty. The vanilla shake was DELICIOUS!

There is one HUGE negative about this place. It is definitely an inconvenience for us locals just to get a burger and a shake. I went there because I was doing a Staycation on the strip. I can't think of a time that I will drive to the strip, park, walk through a casino...all to get an EXPENSIVE (yet good) hamburger. It just won't happen. And just so that you know...I won't be going to In & Out either...yuk...."}
{"text":"Ate here at our first night in Vegas this past December and it was a great decision. Got a Shakeburger, fries and drinks for around $11. The burger was delicious! Every bite was great. It was juicy, well seasoned and topped with fresh ingredients. The fries were crispy, salty and hot. It was my first time at a Shake Shack and I really liked it. 

Beware: if it's a busy night there can be a bit of a wait but the line moves fast so just be patient. If you want a cheap meal then I definitely recommend you go to Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"I want to give this restaurant 5 stars because it is one of my favorite places to get a burger. However the customer service is always lacking and the last time I came the girl seemed to have no clue what customer service was and came off like she didn't want to be there and had a bad attitude. The employees do not greet you or even smile. If shack shack could take more pride in their customer service and training their new recruits better I would be inclined to go there more often and suggest it to other people."}
{"text":"I want to love this place but I can't. The burgers are ehh.. the Frys are gross and the price is like HOLY COW EXPENSIVE for what you get. The only thing this shack has going for them is the chicken sandwhich after I take out a second mortgage. Yikes."}
{"text":"I always go to Shake Shack in every city I visit. I always get the Smoke Shack and cheese fries. Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Favorite burger place! Fast, friendly service and really good prices. Wish there were more locations in Las Vegas. Try the peanut butter cup shake!"}
{"text":"Everything up in here is delicious!! I especially like the chicken sandwich. The environment is cool. Fun games to play in the back. Can be difficult to get a spot to sit at times but worth the short wait."}
{"text":"If I heard one more person saying Shake Shack was better than In N Out I was going to lose it. Partly because I love In N Out and also because I had never tried Shake Shack and felt left out. We ended up here for lunch on a recent trip to Vegas. I was really excited to finally try it out... I hate to say it, I was not impressed. 

We walked in at 1pm. There was a pretty long line, but went by pretty fast. I ordered their Shack Burger with cheese fries. The burger was very small and lackluster. The bun was chewy and doughy.  The meat tasted fresh and I think I remember some form of sauce, which was good, not great. Their cheese fries were pretty disappointing to me. It seems like they had just defrosted some curly fries that came in a bag you get from Costco, slapped on a Kraft cheese slice, microwaved it and charged me $4 bucks. How anyone can compare these fries to animal style fries worries me. 

I finally tried it, so I'm happy, but I will probably not come back. I personally prefer In N Out. Much better food, portions and pricing."}
{"text":"+ Food tastes awesome!
+ Service is super friendly
+ Prices aren't bad at all!

+/- While the line may look long, it goes by pretty fast

I came here during busy EDC weekend to see what my friend's hype was all about. He told me all the other Shake Shacks are in the east coast and that we had to try this place out. So after a few minutes of deciding whether I want to walk from Vdara all the way here.. We did it. 

I had their Shack Burger, a hot dog and some cheese fries. Surprisingly, you get some really good value here. Especially out of the fries.. I believe they're only $3.50 or so, and they were pretty damn good! Very very good. 

You know that feeling when you're hungry and you just order lots off the menu, but don't finish it? Well, I ordered a lot and ended up finishing all. The food tasted that good and I just couldn't help but killing everything. 

I highly recommend coming here if your hotel isn't too far and you don't mind walking here, or hell just come here because it's that good."}
{"text":"I don't know why people do big deal of this fast food, tried it once because this place close to work, burgers  small, french fries  doesn't taste good at all, no refills on drinks and overpriced for this poor quality food"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Shake Shack its first few weeks of being open when it made its way to Las Vegas. Located just outside of New York New York on the strip. I always wondered how their burgers were because being living in California, In N Out is the undisputed champ. I have friends that have been eating it on their trips to NYC and some have said it was better than In N Out. Others disagreed. Finally, it was my turn to taste and judge for myself.

I ordered a ShackStack ($9.49) and a SmokeShack ($6.69). The latter, I split with someone. I also ordered crinkle cut fries ($2.95) and a large strawberry lemonade ($3.50). That ShackStack was pretty tasty. Soft bread, fresh ground beef patty, melted cheese and that breaded shroom burger that oozes cheese once you bite into it. That's good use of portobello. All that with lettuce, tomato and shacksauce are what you get. I thought the bun was maybe a little too soft. The burger had good flavor but the sandwich overall was a little salty. Its not cheap at almost 10 bucks. The SmokeShack was interesting but not my favorite. It's just like the ShackBurger except it has smoked applewood bacon and chopped up cherry peppers. I wasnt a fan of the cherry peppers. I should have read the menu more carefully. Not a fan of spice on my burgers. I probably would have liked it better without that. The fries were good and crispy. Serve your own ketchup. They give you a pager so you can come up to the counter when your order is ready. I also got a onesie ($18) for my friend's newborn.

There was a little bit of a wait but we got there within an hour of them closing so it wasnt too bad. But you still have to wait as everything is cooked to order. Service was ok. You could tell it was the end of the shift on a long Vegas night. Is Shake Shack better than In N Out?? No... in my opinion, I'd still take Baldwin Park's finest any day. Dont get me wrong. I still enjoyed it and I'd have it again. Maybe I'll get a custard or concrete next time. Plenty of seating inside, out front or on the side-garden looking area."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is much MUCH better than In n Out. Get the shack burger as a starter. Greasy, to-die for burgers with 10,000 calories but worth it once in a while."}
{"text":"The burger was not what I expected for the price I paid.  The bun was flat and cold. The bacon was also not that heated. Like it was sand bagged for quick setup. Even though I had to wait 15 minutes to get the burger."}
{"text":"Food and milkshakes = bomb (marshmellow chocolate chip shake is out of this world). Also... the fries are PERFECT. 

Don't let the long line intimidate you, it's honestly a 10-15 min wait. And yes many people say it's over priced, but honestly, you're probably spending $5 more here for an entire meal than you are at mcdonald's for an entire meal. Most meals at mcdonald's come to about 10-11 bucks, my meal (burger, cheese fries, shake) was 15.. Not a big deal."}
{"text":"You have no idea how long I've been waiting to try Shake Shack. I've always envied my boyfriend who gets to go to NYC to visit his family for annual summer trips and I would always hear great things about Shake Shack. Ever since I heard that Las Vegas was going to be a new home for the franchise on the West Coast, I just knew that I had to get here!

So for starters, we came during a weekday so the crowds weren't that busy. We were able to get our orders down and find a table easily. However, for sure the weekends will be much more busier. But other than that, when you walk in, you will just order at the cash register and they will give you a buzzer while you take some time to flag a table to sit and wait.

We ordered:

1. ShackBurger: It's your basic cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato and delicious sauce. My bf, being the Shake Shack guru he is, said that the meat patty was lacking a bit, but overall the sides and drinks were just as delicious as the ones in NYC (4/5)

2. Shroom Burger: I'm not a vegetarian, but I was definitely craving for this one after reading positive reviews. It's crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with ooey-gooey delicious cheeses with lettuce and tomato. SO GOOD! (5/5)

3. Cheese Fries and Regular fries: I love the crinkle cut fries! I just wish there were more cheese sauce for the cheese fries - but overall, you can't go wrong with any of these. Very delicious! (5/5)

4. Peanut Butter Malt Shake: My bf swears that this is the best he has ever tasted. He says that it is very comparable to the one from NYC. So yay! (5/5)

5. Peach Lemonade: Very refreshing AND you get free refills! Nice! (5/5)

Prices can be a bit steep, but the food here is good. Until then, I wouldn't mind coming here again to get my Shake Shack fix!"}
{"text":"Location is beautiful, parking always sucks but that's because it's in a shopping district but if you wanna walk around after and burn some calories/shop it's a perfect spot. Burgers are consistently good, crinkle cut fries are a personal favorite so always love those. Around $14 for a double cheeseburger with bacon and fries is the only downside but, you definitely get what you pay for! A Burger aficionado must try"}
{"text":"Very excited to finally have a Shake Shack! The Shack burger is delicious. Not only that, the fries are perfectly made. Especially the Bacon Cheese fries. They are worth it!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite burger joints now. The patty in the Shack Stack was very well done and plain delicious. The fries were also very good as was my vanilla shake. Everything was good basically. The portion size is a bit smaller than expected but that's because American food portions are massive. It's perfect for my Canadian self. I would say you do need to order at least fries on the side though if you're getting a single. Lastly they have a neat pager system to let you know when your food is done, which is great because this place was very busy."}
{"text":"This place was great again the second time around. The line and waiting for your food was worth it. I got the shake stack and my boyfriend got the double. Both were very yummy and so were the fries. We'll definitely be coming back on our next trip. You guys need to open up a place in the Bay Area!!!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas and had to try the burger.  I am a LA native.  The burger was tasty but less than what I expected.  It was small.  Light on the sauce.  The fries were good.  I would eat it again but I did not taste all the fuss.  I bet it's better in NYC."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just pure West Coast burger fan...(In 'n Out)

Let's start with the location space.  Well done, well done.  A well designed space with plenty of room.  Top notch materials and abundant light.

To order was easy enough.  Tell them what you want and they help you out if needed.

Food.
Single basic Cheeseburger.  Now, everything tasted as it should.  Fresh, well cooked and properly handled.  For me, when all put together, it has an off flavor that I just can't wrap my head around.  And the burger is a lot smaller than I expected.  But no deductions for that.

Cheese Fries.  These were good.  No complaints here.

Peanut Butter Shake.  Very, very good.  

All employees were more than helpful and just plain nice.  For this reason alone, I'll be back to try something else."}
{"text":"The westernmost outpost of the Danny Meyer burger empire is located in Vegas, most befittingly in an outdoor courtyard of the New York-New York hotel/casino. Considering how popular they are in the eastern half of the US it has generated a lot of buzz; it's been on my Vegas bucket list ever since the opening was announced. A year later I got the opportunity to go as my sister had a Shake Shack craving.

CONCEPT: Fast-casual burger chain with burgers priced between $5 and $10, along the lines of a Five Guys or Smashburger with the cult appeal approaching that of In-N-Out Burger. According to Shake Shack's official website, the burgers are made with the following ingredients:
- 100% natural all-Angus beef sourced with cows not fed with hormones or antibiotics. The meat is freshly ground.
- Fresh veggies - choose from a combo of lettuce, tomato, pickles or onions.
- The bun is a non-GMO Martin's Potato Roll.

The fries are of the frozen crinkle-cut Yukon kind and the shakes are made from freshly spun frozen custard. 

VENUE: Located *outside* the casino formerly the site of ESPN zone.

SERVICE: Counter service only. When my family went on New Years Day lunchtime we were in line for less than 5 minutes. This was considering that the line was outside. There was a slightly longer wait for our food to be ready. 

Your meal is ready when your buzzer rings.

My first Shake Shack meal consisted of a Shack Stack burger (Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce) and their crinkle-cut fries. I sipped a little bit of my sister's shake as I wasn't in the mood for a shake at the time.
- My sister says that it's an East Coast thing for softer buns (dunno if this is true). I appreciated the softer, sweeter bun and it's comparable to a perfectly toasted In-N-Out bun.
- Veggies were fresh.
- The portobello mushroom was freshly fried and I could hear the pop of the mushroom meat opening. The melted muenster cheese just made the mushroom burger just taste meatier.
- Burger patty was cooked to my liking. Cheeses made the burger slightly moist.

Crinkle fries were cooked consistently so all fries were crispy but they were a little on the plain side. The shake was also a little on the plain side but this was due to my sister's preference. Next time I'll get a different flavor shake and have it malted.

Though the prices reflect the Vegas standard (read: expensive!) the burger quality is worth a return visit. Though my preference still is a good In-N-Out burger more I can appreciate this burger for what it is and I understand why the East Coasters are up in arms about this chain. It certainly beats White Castle and Five Guys."}
{"text":"So my apartment complex gave me and my little brother free burgers coupons on move in. As I am not a newbie to the Las Vegas area, but never tried this place, I decided on a Sunday to walk in. 
Well, I now know why they were giving free coupons out. As the people behind the counter were pleasant and seemed to care about the customers the food was disgusting. 
As I have traveled the united states, I could of obtained a better burger from the food stand in Flatbush, NY. As i did not have to pay for the burger, my bill would have been 11.00 plus, which was not worth it at all. Even down to the 50/50 drink was disgusting. 

I would never recommend this place to anyone, especially with so many other eateries in the area."}
{"text":"I used to have to fly to New York to enjoy this goodness. So glad it's here in Vegas. I'm a burger girl but the 'shroom burger is my all time favorite. It's a deep fried porabella mushroom with melted cheese. Yummmmm! Lines are consistently long but moves very quickly. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"When you're in Vegas, let's be real. What is there really to eat? You either got chain food like Chipotle and Panada or you go all out at Giada's, Serendipity or their grand buffets.

So of course, I like to think this is the grand medium of Vegas food greatness at a (somewhat) reasonable price.

Burgers? Don't have shake shack at your local town? Shack Stack allll the way. Cheese burger with a FRIED PORTOBELLO MUSHROOM WITTH CHESSE. And that stuff oozessss out. Oh gawd, yes.

Drink? Coffee shake. Make it a malt. Worth it. Too much for yourself? Ask them to split it in two! They're do it for ya.  

Sides? Cheese fries. Oh gawd yes please. Wanna go all out? Top that off with fried shallots and ohhh baby, you better be going to XS to dance that alllll off.

All in all, good food for a good price in Vegas. Otherwise it's a literally pricey for a burger but other than that, def recommend if you have a huge crowd and hustlin to go to the clubs after, teeheee."}
{"text":"Not as great as new yorks shake shack.. BUT !!! It's still freaking De Lish Ousssssssss!!! That cheeseeeeeee with the shack stack... Omg . The fries were cooked to crispy perfection! The cheese they put on top of the cheese fries is pretty much the same cheese they use in the burger. And I AM A-OKay with that!!"}
{"text":"I always look forward to Shake Shack when I am in Vegas. The service is pretty quick for the amount of people that are in there at any given moment. The ingredients are fresh and made to order. There are always a ton of people in and around the restaurant so seating is hard to find inside. You can download the Shake Shack app and order ahead which I did not have a chance to try out when I was there last. I will be trying it the next time I'm in the area. I got their hamburger which was juicy and good size even though they don't look like it. Their fries are good and lightly salted. Wish you would come to WA Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"Ok, this place is just ok. If you are in Vegas and just trying to sober your self up a little, I guess I can see the appeal. If you aren't drinking or drunk, I wouldn't recommend. It's not very tasty, just greasy. I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"Woo-hoo! I was so excited to see this place while walking on the strip I decided I had to at least get a shake. 

The line was quick since I did the c express line which is basically only for drinks. 

I asked the cashier what the best milkshake was and she said the black and white. The price was a bit high at 5+ dollars especially for the size of the cup but I honestly loved my shake. 

The consistency was so thick and creamy and the flavor combo was so good. It had a fudgy chocolate taste mixed wit the vanilla that I enjoyed. 

Overall a great experience for me! Hopefully I'll get a chance to try their burgers in the new location in LA!"}
{"text":"First timers- tried a little of everything and not only delicious but priced great for being a nice hang right off the strip at New York New York.  Went with the basic cheese Burgers, cross cut fries, Shake-Cago Dog (awesome by the way) beer, Diet Coke and a Concrete chocolate thingy with all kinds of stuff mixed in all for $30! Awesome place, definitely with a second visit to try more of the tons of good stuff on menu."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon with 2 friends. This was a extremely busy time at Shake Shack because there was a football game on and no seats. I ordered the chicken burger .  The seasoning on the chicken burger was very salty and they chicken was only fried, there was no option for grilling. I also noticed there are no other side options besides fries. I would of preferred a salad or something else besides fries.  Although my burger was very salty, it was good. The bun was surprisingly the best part of it. 
I would of enjoyed more menu options even vegan/ vegetarian. Its great they offer a glutten free  bun tho!"}
{"text":"Sooo disappointed with this shake shack. I've been to the shake shack in London and New York and LOVED the food there. 

I got a shroom burger which is a deep fried mushroom filled with cheese but there was barely any cheese in it. I'm not even sure it was in my burger. 

I also got the cheese fries but the fries were super oily. I didn't even finish them. 

Shake shack has really good food and even though it's pricey and has small portions, it's absolutely delicious and worth it. HOWEVER I was really disappointed with the shake shack here, especially since it's the closest one available to the west coast."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much from this place, yet I was surprised! The burgers have so much flavor, I'm not a big burger fan but the meat tasted fresh and so did the toppings. Don't forget the cheese fries! 
The price is a huge plus, it's very decent compared to others on the strip. 
Just a Tip- They do not have jalapeños as an add on yet, if you feel adventures they do have ghost peppers... I wasn't brave enough! 
Oh and look for the photo booth! It's FREE!!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am in LA or Vegas, shake shack comes in mind because of their Shack Stack. Their cheese is melty, fried mushroom is delicious, and the beef is cook to perfection. 

This place always satisfy my burger cravings. It may be a bit pricy, but I do believe you get what you pay for. 

Shake Shack never disappoint"}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack! The fries and burgers are good (and very filling). My friend really liked the cheese fries. I like how they serve alcohol there, too, and the milkshakes are decent! I always come to Shake Shack when I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Never had shake shack before but heard two of them just opened up so I decided to check it out. I ordered shack stack and cheese fries. She dhack stack had a tasty portobello stuffed mushroom in it but the burger as a whole only tasted alright. The cheese fries were scissor cut with just melted cheese on top, nothing impressive. However, the cost of the burger was 9.95$ and the cheese fries costed 4$. For the price I paid and the quality + the quantity received, I dont think I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"This burger was nothing special. Sure, it was good but not worth the wait in line. For $8 I was expecting more bang for my buck. The burger was a tiny bit bigger than a McDonald's burger. The patty was juicy and the shake shack's sauce made it tastier than a burger from McDonald's but it was far from  filling. The fries were decent, but, again, nothing special. 

And their \"red velvet\" custard was vanilla custard with a few red velvet crumbs on top.  Wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I used to see this place on Instagram and I was SO happy when they opened one here. It does not disappoint. Place is so delicious, and I love all the natural choices."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better hamburger chain that I have ever ate.  The quality and taste is to die for.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is due to being too expensive for a hamburger.  One regular shake shack hamburger $6 did not fill me up.  I need to spend approximately $12 to fill me up.  That is pricey for eating hamburger. I also had the strawberry shake but kinda pricey for the amount they gave me.  I prefer the west coast In N Out burgers over the NYC's Shake Shack for the price and amount you get.  By the way, Go CUSE!"}
{"text":"I tried this place Becuase of the hype. Not going to lie it was worth the hype Til it died down. I say their burgers are just pricey then smash burger. But I gotta love the concretes they serve in this place. I will go here again one a chill hangou lt day with my friends."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. I don't get what the hype is all about. Fries and ice cream are good. Burger is meh. Not at all worth the price. I love how they put out games to play though!"}
{"text":"Proof New Yorkers can't even do fast food well.  Disappointing. Greasy. Low grade food.  Go to In-n-Out or Tommy's and save $10. Each time I follow up on the latest New York fast food craze, I'm left thoroughly disappointed but perplexed, pontificating: How could such otherwise intelligent, \"progressive\" urban people show such enthusiasm for such inferior food?  Whether it be the cupcakes at Magnolia Cafe, the pastrami at Carnegie Deli (vs. the superior Jewish delis in L.A.), the Cronut or the frozen hot chocolate craze, I learn hard.

Here, the fries are not better than frozen Ore-Ida French fries sold in plastic bags at the market.  You know the variety: corrugated, large, tasteless.   The patty was of the caliber you get at a church luncheon.  Store bought, fatty.  Vegetables and bun also below par. 

A gourmet cheeseburger at Mesa Grill~ Caesars Palace is a better buy, $18, and it comes with real French fries.  

Shake Shack: What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Great customer service!  I paid $16 for two hot dogs, a fry, and a double scoop of custard.  Food was awesome so it was worth it.  Fresh ingredients, and very tasty! I would have no problem coming back!  Definitely worth the money and the food hit the spot!  This place is very popular and the line gets craaaaaazzzy long. Fortunately I got here right before the line got long.  Like I've said before,  it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say the burgers here just aren't as good as the originals. Bun was a bit different it seemed and it was overcooked/dry. Chickn shack was good. Just not as good as sitting in the park in NYC good. So if you got a craving and want a decent cheap burger, by all means do it. But..."}
{"text":"Having only been to the Chicago location, I was very impressed with this Shake Shack in New York New York! We came at 10:45 pm at night after a UFC event. The line to order was about 8 min long. Not too bad for a Saturday night. We ordered the Shack Burger, Chick N Shack, side of fries, and the vanilla frozen custard. Everything was ready about 10 min after we ordered. I was very happy with our food! The fries were perfectly fried: not overly cooked and not soggy. The burgers were also nice and juicy. The lettuce they use is the real romaine lettuce and not that iceberg lettuce that gives no real crunch. It was SO good! Not to mention, the frozen custard was creamy, thick and not too sweet. I think it was just the perfect amount too to satisfy my sweet tooth. My only problem with our experience here was the bathroom was pretty gross. Toilet paper everywhere and really messy. Need to keep up with the cleanliness of the restrooms! Other than that, we had a fantastic late night dinner here! Plus the prices are pretty reasonable; we had a full meal for $24! Definitely stop by if you're on the New York New York side of the strip!"}
{"text":"Loved the burger and shackmeister dog! Rootbeer float was awesome too!  A must go to when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is my second Shake Shack visit! I was SO excited to see they have several restaurants located across the Las Vegas area.  

We walked in ready to eat! We ordered two burgers and their (new) chicken sandwich. PLUS the special Shackmiester Ale, brewed by Brooklyn Brewery. Which in case you didn't know is awesome! It pairs well with everything on the menu and is made ONLY for Shake Shack. 

I have to say I wasn't impressed with the layout of the restaurant. I feel like a better layout could tremendously improve the flow. It felt a bit closed off, I feel like there wasn't enough counter space, and the condiments were near a bunch of tables. It was crowded. 

HOWEVER, I love love love this establishment. I make it a point to locate a Shake Shack in every city I go to. The food is incomparable. The experience is incredible. Go to Shake Shack - do it!!!! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"It's not all that.this was the first and the last.near over cooked.the even had heating lamps with burgers pre done! What is this B.K. or mc 's? Pricey, for me to say that.hmmm!"}
{"text":"Not good. I ordered nacho cheese fries, a chili dog and a shake and a malt. When I received my order I only got one shake. I tried telling the girl and she said you only ordered one \" I repeated your order\" ( all snotty). For one I know I ordered two and two the place is so loud ! Also , Ordered chili cheese dog for my 8 year old and the employee knew it was for her and she didn't even mention it was super spicy! It was way to spicy for her and she loves spicy food. Plus , it was cold. The cheese fries were good , but small, and the shakes were good as well but it didn't even come with whip cream, really? 6$ and whip is extra! Talk about nickel and dimming you. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ah the never ending battle of In N Out vs Shake Shack. Although there are many great food critics and blogs out there who have many opinions on this battle and each burger, I've decided to also throw my hat in the ring. Granted no one asked for a review, but I've proactively decided to give one.

What Shake Shack deserves a 5 star for is their Smoke Shack Burger and their Frozen Custard. The Smoke Shack burger is an amazing burger that doesn't just rival In N Out because In N Out has chosen to go the simple burger route. It's not a bad thing though. The burger is so moist and delicious with a bun that perfectly fits with the burger. Nothing is worse than a burger with a thick bun that sticks out like a sore thumb. It's like you're eating bread with a side of meat rather than a cohesive burger. Thankfully, Shake Shack and In N Out both do well with their buns.

As for their fries, they're very average. The are the same type of frozen crinkle cut fries that you buy at the store. The cheese fries isn't great either. It's practically nacho cheese. But even though they lack a bit on their fry game, In N Out is in a similar boat. Some people may disagree, but In N Out's fries are very mediocre as well. You can get it special ways by asking well done, but even still neither compare to a nice McDonald's fry.

So with all that, on the regular, I'd probably choose In N Out, but Shake Shack makes a valiant effort. It's a great option for when I want In N Out but with a bit more of a twist. But first it needs to become easier to access in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"You can't beat these burgers.  Fries aren't anything special but the burger is the best burger you will ever eat.  Loaded with cheese and the meat is perfectly grilled. You will pay a little more, and have to wait in line, then wait for your food, but it's worth it.  Sauce is good too. I get the bacon double cheeseburger.  So good."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is the new king of fast food #burger spots. I've heard the hype and kind of ignored it until now. Chick Fil A , InNOut, Five Guys, and McDonald's better watch out because Shake Shake is going to crush wherever they go. The bun is phenomenal. Super tasty, soft, and fresh potato bun. The beef patty is a good portion, juicy, and beefy goodness full of flavor. The opposite of other spots rubber patties full of glue. The #cheese and sauce ratio is great and the produce is fresh. Plus the menu has great variety and quality options across the board. Love this place."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I went with my boyfriend who had only tried Shake Shack in Minnesota, and when they opened a new location in Henderson he was excited to take me. The place itself is nice and trendy. They have a foosball table and a shuffleboard table for people to hangout and play with groups. It was pretty busy for a Thursday night but it is very new! We both ordered single shackburgers, one side of fries, a drink, and a salted caramel shake. We waited about 5 minutes for our food. The burgers were good, the only thing I would comment on were the size of the burgers. I am pretty small so the single was fine but if you eat more food then I would recommend trying the double. Some of the fries were a little brown but the good ones tasted great especially with their Shacksauce. It had a different taste than most burger joint sauces I've tasted but I really liked it, but my boyfriend was not very fond of it so it isn't for everyone. Service was great, everyone was very friendly. Overall great burger place and happy to see them in Henderson! Definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"Not really sure what the BFD is with the Shake Shack. I went to the Shake Shack with family and we shared many items. I tried their insane double decker burger that consists of a fried cheese filled mushroom burger, a cheeseburger patty.... and we had to add bacon, of course. It was alright, but for the calorie count, I would expect it to be bigger. I tried the chicago dog, which was legit, and I would order that again. The cheese fries were covered in gloopy cheese sauce... no thanks. The desserts were good, but.... come on.... it's ice cream... can't be bad. Would I go back to shake shack? Sure... but it isn't anything mind blowing."}
{"text":"Delicious! It was my first time, I ordered the smoke shack, fries and a black and white shake. All were amazing! The only down side was the long lines, but all the employees were friendly. I will advise you to eat this meal if you're not going to be doing a lot of walking or actives. Although very tasty, you will definitely get the itis."}
{"text":"Shake shack never disappoints! The chicken sandwich and spicy chicken sandwich are what's up! The milkshakes are addicting and they have a great on tap selection. Great setup outside and the staff is always on the ball. Oh the cheese fries...get them. No questions asked."}
{"text":"I am only rating shake shack with one star because there is no option for zero stars. This was my first time to any shake shack. SO NOT WORTH IT. The only reason we tried it was because we were picking up Lou Malnatti's pizza as a take out a few doors down and we had a long ride home. Thought it would be a 'tide me over' until we had pizza for supper. So overrated. Too expensive for such a small burger like the size of a White Castle slider. Ridiculous. Cashier was somewhat nice/rude. We had taken some change out of the car to use that was hanging around. Had told her exactly the correct amount of change. Bill was 12 something. Had three in coins, mostly quarters. She gave a rude look at the change, like, seriously? She then proceeded to tell a co-worker to put the change into her drawer. Why couldn't she do it???? Asked for fries well done, crispy, and hot. Brought food to table. Fries were cold and not crispy. ewwweeeee. While I had them re-make the fries, the burger got cold. Will never go back. Just don't understand the hype and excitement of this burger chain. If I am going to go out for a burger and to a chain, it's Five Guys all the way!"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. Everyone raved and went on and on about shake shack and I left completely confused what everyone is so up in arms about. It was really expensive for a ok tasting fast food burger. I think the Mcdonald's cheeseburger may be bigger and taste better, Maybe it's the location? off day? Or perhaps the obviously bored and underwhelmed staff working the counter. I don't know. The girl that rang me up literally looked like her life was ruined by being there. I find it hard to believe what I tasted was what I've been hearing about. The fries sucked. Like elementary school cafeteria sucked. Can't say I'll be rushing back. Habit burger is way better and cheaper."}
{"text":"After seeing the line out the door and seeing other reviews we had to try it.  ShackBurger and fries were good.  Ordered a root beer float but they were out of root beer.  Fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Shake Shack ever, and I have to say this was probably THEE best fast food burger I've ever had. 

Food: I ordered the Roadside Shack and it's basically a cheeseburger with grilled onions and bacon bits but I also added lettuce and pickles. The very first thing I noticed was the superb quality of the meat--so fresh and flavorful just by itself. I love how all of the ingredients mixed very well together in unison and complimented each other. The burger was absolutely delicious. I also was able to try the Smoke Shack, which I actually liked better than the burger I ordered. At first I thought that the cherry peppers and bacon would overwhelm the flavor of the burger, but it was just so perfect.

Service: Everyone was very helpful and attentive. While we were still deciding on what to order, one of the workers (I think he may be the manager or some type of higher-up) gave us a sample of their Frankenstein (Shackenstein) dessert, which was delicious. Mark also gave us an amazing experience by talking to us while we were seated and cleaning after our trays (we went for seconds and dessert).

Great place for burgers, I'm so happy they're in Summerlin. A MUST try!"}
{"text":"So I really wanted to see what all the hype was about for this place so we decided to come here for dinner. It's like a fancier fast food place is how I can describe it. 

I ordered a single shackburger and a salted caramel shake. I thought the burger was good. Not the best burger I've ever had, but still good. On the other hand though, my shake was delicious!! They do not mess around with these!! 

I like that they are dog friendly and also had some dog items on their menu too and the customer service was good. However I wouldn't have waited an hour in line for their burger."}
{"text":"Heard about this place on tv. Las Vegas location outside of NY Ny hotel. Very long line inside. Luckily we only wanted to try the shakes so we stood in the faster line outside. Shakes made with custard not ice cream. I ordered the caramel- it was good not too sweet. My daughter had the shake of the week with raspberries and my son had the frozen custard of the week which was even better.  The peach lemonade my husband ordered was only mediocre. Outside has fans and misters above seating areas. As I am not a fan of shakes in general- it was not the greatest or the worst I've ever tried. Just wanted to see what all the hype was about."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and fries! My friend have been bugging me to go try them, so I finally did and they were right! Customer service was excellent. Ronnie was able to help my friend with her burger order as she has a gluten allergy.  And their fries are cooked in soybean oil, so that people with gluten allergy can have fries. Best thing ever, as she couldn't have fries. Had the stack burger, it is a cheeseburger with a breaded portobello mushroom in the burger. It was very flavorful and delicious. The crinkle fries were great as an added bonus to it. I definitely prefer Shake shack over In and Out and the Habit. Prices are a little on the pricey side but hey everything is more expensive on the strip. Wish they would open one here in the Bay."}
{"text":"We were looking for a burger place to eat, but something under $10 because the MGM hotel likes to charge $25 for a burger....smh Fat burgers was expensive too....and Johnny Rockets. We saw shake shack and heard good things about their burger and we decided to try it. Not only their prices are amazing ($5.88 one burger and $2.99 fries and I shared it) but they're are really nice. The customer service is awesome! The burger is amazing I love it!!"}
{"text":"The menu is limited, but the food is awesome. They tend to be busy on the weekends but the atmosphere is very relaxed. Outdoor seating is available. Love their shakes, it's very smooth. Cleanliness all around including heir bathrooms."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times before but my last visit was a great experience. Located on the strip, this place can be busy but the line usually moves quick. I feel the food is a tad bit over priced but the foods delicious. I got the shack stack and it's flavorful and super cheesy. I'm not a fan of the French fries, they remind me of microwave fries. Overall the burger was good and I enjoyed my experience there."}
{"text":"Ohhhh so i finally get to try the shake shack!! This place is located on the strip next to Monte Carlo. Their burgers are so good! i really like the buns they use. Its like the hawaiian bread. I also like their fries! They are super crispy with a fluffy inside. i also got their concrete and it was alright. i got the strawberry syrup one. i didn't really like it i wish i got a different flavor. Im definitely gonna come back and eat here again cause it was so good."}
{"text":"I have to say I've always been an in n out fan. Once I had shake shack I have not been back to in n out. 

I want to start at the ordering process, it's easy but if you want a well done burger you have to ask; otherwise its coming medium. I personally love my burgers well!!

The burgers are literally the best I've ever had with a tasty sauce. The milkshakes are thick and yummy. I love dipping my crinkle fries in the shakes.  
Nothing like sweet and salty fried potato!!

They always have free self serve water!! 

The staff is always friendly and they will pick up your garbage and get you refills. 

The facility itself is always clean and the atmosphere is comfortable."}
{"text":"Ehhhh, not sure why this place is a must try. I do believe in n out has a better taste due to their spread. I wasn't impressed by my shake burger. I ordered the burger with a portobello mushroom inside and it was okay. The cheese tasted kind of bitter to me. The best part was that the crispness of the mushroom helped make the burger taste better. Other than that, nothing special. Their \"special sauce\" is kind of like innout spread except it's more yellow in color, a little creamier, and tastes like it has a hint of garlic powder. Fries aren't amazing either, just tastes/looks like crinkle fries you can easily buy in the frozen aisle. 

Place seems like a nice place to hang out though if you want to take a break from the strip."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time we've been here but the first time eating inside. I had the Shack Stack (mushroom burger AND shack burger) w/ bacon added. Very soft and warm egg bun is a twist I haven't seen before. The mushroom party is stuffed with Gruyere cheese and then deep fried. Compared to In & Out, this is pretty good, not as good as a double-double animal style IMO, but pretty good and it fulfilled my burger craving. I also had the crinkle cut fries which are meh. Peanut butter shake for dessert was well worth it! Real peanuts blended into the shake! 
I know there's one that opened near home in LA. Maybe I'll try that if I'm craving another Shack Stack and peanut butter shake."}
{"text":"Shake shack is number one or number two in the commercial hamburger arena. Hamburgers are season very well ."}
{"text":"Clean Restaurant and fast service. There's just nothing special than any other chain."}
{"text":"Friday night it was time to check out the long awaited arrival of Shake Shack at DTS, I have heard so much about this burger joint through the years from friends who have tried the one in NYC to the recent one that opened in the NYNY Hotel. 

When we arrived, we were greeted by an employee who was energetic and excited about explaining the items on the menu. She helped us decide what to order. This was helpful and I decided to order the Shack burger with fries and a chocolate shake! My daughter had the chicken hotdog! I was like Really? They are known for their burgers, but she is slowly moving towards becoming a vegan so...I couldn't say a word.

As I was walking away to find a seat there was a lady stating she was so excited to try their food and hoping it was delicious and I chimed in \"so you can Yelp about it\" and her response was \"Yelping is for cowards\". Excuse me??!!?? I took the higher ground and chose to ignore her obvious stupidity. Ok, on with my review!

They give you a little beeper which lets you know when your food is ready to pick up. We chose to sit outside and it was a gorgeous evening! There is plenty of seating both inside and out but with our terrific fall weather why eat inside? Our food arrived and I have to say it was good not great! My burger was tasty and I liked the special sauce but I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. My bun was really flat and lifeless and although I love crinkle fries they had way too much salt. The chocolate shake was rich and heavy. It was also not blended all the way as lots of lumps. 

I understand that they just opened and probably have some training issues to work out. I am going to give them one more try after they have had a chance to be open for a while and work out some of the kinks and hopefully it will be better. I will be open and optimistic on my next visit!"}
{"text":"* This fast food restaurant's look was nothing amazing but the food definitely makes up for this. It has TV's in every corner with different channels to fit any viewer. The atmosphere is very quite, all you can hear is yourself and the TV. Since it's kind of empty, you have a lot of space to yourself. I do love the location of the restaurant though, because it's in Downtown Summerlin mall and the outdoor designs are so aesthetically pleasing. 

* There was this student discount that they having going until July, where it is but one get one free. I ordered the shackstack and my boyfriend got the smoke shack (or smoke stack, I forgot, whoops). These burgers ooze out flavor. It is so amazing but it also oozes out oil; like lots of it. My boyfriend thought that the meat was very tender and juicy, but the burger fell apart quite easily. Very hard to handle and keep clean. 

* Like I said, there was a student discount from Mon. - Thur. Until July. I recommend going there for the buy one get on free burger if you're a student. It's a quite deal. You basically only pay $7-$9

* Boyfriend Rate: 7/10
* My rate: 8/10 
* Price: $"}
{"text":"Ah yes Shake Shack. I heard about this place through some East Coast youtubers who rave about it and knew they had one in Vegas so I hyped it up to my friends and made us walk all the way across the strip to get here (near New York- New York). The exterior building is pretty cool and when we got there it was late lunch but there was a decent line that went by pretty fast. We waited about 5ish minutes in line before we could order, which wasn't bad. 

I ordered the original shake burger (I think that's what it's called?) a regular cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato with their supposed shake sauce. I also got fries to share with my friend. We grabbed a wooden table in which I appreciated the decor and waited for our food via an electric beeper. Didn't take long before our group got our order.

Honestly, when I got the plate I felt a little underwhelmed. I expected so much and it looked like a small, regular cheeseburger. Now I must admit that the meat is juicy itself and was well made compared to the likes of In-N-Out, however it was just so small for the amount that it was that I just couldn't justify it. I could barely taste the shake sauce and even began wondering if there were any in my burger. I finished it in no time and started on the fries, which I must admit was pretty good. But that doesn't make up for the fact that the cheeseburger was just so...ordinary. 

I thought this place was too hyped up and would not come back again unless it was for the fries. Would prefer In-N-Out way better, but it was nice to say I tried it!"}
{"text":"It's just like any other Shake Shack -- delivers what you expect.  My level of rating changes with the size of the line --- it just isn't worth waiting 30+ minutes BEFORE you even get to order."}
{"text":"It was good! But I still love my in and out! Burgers tasted fresh but just felt like it was missing something. It is a little overpriced, we paid 30$ for two small burgers 2 sodas and 1 order of fries. Extra star bc the workers there were super nice!! I would come back if friends wanted to try it but probably wouldn't go out of my way to try it again."}
{"text":"To start off this review, I wanna say, this was my first time at Shake Shack, and I was drunk.  Please continue reading if you'd like to hear about this restaurant from a drunk point of view.

I love, love, loved it! I was starving since my friends and I went to a day club, we wanted something on the cheaper side so we decided to come here! I was starving since it was almost 3pm.  I ordered the Shackburger with bacon and some cheese fries.  I know this place is typically compared to In n Out but I feel like they are a different style than that (or maybe I'm biased that In n Out is better).  I liked the burger a lot, it was very flavorful and meaty which is the type of burger I usually enjoy.  I think the best part of this meal were the cheese fries.  They had just the right amount of cheese and definitely a different style than at In n Out.  I really liked them a lot and wish I ordered more.  The burger and the fries filled me up pretty well. 
Since this is the only location close to me, I have to give it a 5 stars.  Especially for the drunchies."}
{"text":"My boyfriend vacationed in New York in early December where he was introduced to Shake Shack and fell in love and left me...just kidding!

My family and the boy took a short trip to Vegas before NYE and he found out there's a shake shack at the NYNY hotel so he dragged me there the first night we were there. I let him order the shack stack, crinkle fries, and a cranberry ginger lemonade to share since it was a midnight snack. My favorite burger place have always been In-N-Out and I can't imagine something else being more tastier and satisfying. The price is definitely pricier here, almost $10 for each burger so I had high expectations.

The interior was very nice and it was packed so I was lucky to find a table for my boy and I. Food came out about 10 minutes later and from the look of the burger, it looks really good, but I was scared to taste it just because I'm In-n-out biased. 

Not much of a fan of mushrooms, but it was fried with some cheese filling so I guess that hides it. The first bite of the burger made me cry...not because the mushroom disgusted me, but because with the patty, lettuce, and everything...IT WAS ACTUALLY GOOD..like REALLY GOOD. The cheese-filled fried mushroom exploded in my mouth which gave me an instant reaction. I combined both burger and fries together for a combo bite and it literally can't get any better.

So now I'm here writing this review, crying in the inside, because for the first time I can admit that I can't be a bias for In-n-out if I fell in love with Shake Shack. The quality all around is way better for the burger AND fries; I always had a lowkey issue for in-n-out fries.

So my final statement is that if I could, I would go to shake shack overall, but since there isn't a location in California, I'll stick to In-n-out WHICH IS STILL TASTY AND SATISFYING.

Someone should petition to open a location in southern California. PLEASE. #ShakeShackCA2K16"}
{"text":"Tried the double stack and the black and white milk shake. Unexpected super duper deliciousness! Unlike five guys or in and out burger. 

Must try!"}
{"text":"First off, 5 stars for the chicken shack sandwich! This is one of my favorite fast food chicken sandwiches ever and holds a special place in my heart. I always love when the chicken-to-bun ratio favors the meat :). 

This is the newer Shake Shack in the Metro Phoenix area located in the Kierland shopping center. We had the hardest time finding it based on the Yelp location that I immediately updated the actual address when we arrived! It's smaller than the downtown Scottsdale location, but not busy at all! We ordered 2 chicken shacks and cheese fries. After the first experience eating cheese fries, I thought these were the better option than plain fries. So many regrets. The cheese looked way more pale and fake than the last time I had them and had only 20% fry coverage. Nevertheless, my hunger took over and I dug in. I understand this is a \"fast food\" type of restaurant with so many crazy added preservatives, but this cheese sauce was whack! It got really clumpy too quickly and I kinda lost my appetite to eat the rest - but I did because I love fries and eating. 

I'll just stick to my chicken shack sandwich and skip the fries next time. I'll spend the calories on a concrete instead :)"}
{"text":"The burgers tasted super fresh and the fries were fantastic! We got here as soon as they opened so we didn't wait long at all. It's a good experience to try it out while you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Vegas gets a taste of New York!

It's been ages since I had a burger at Shake Shack. Now I can indulge more often than I like! My go-to here in the Shroom Stack: a beef patty combined with a breaded deep fried portobello & cheese burger.

Its conveniently located on the strip, at where else, but the New York New York hotel. Walking distance from Hakkasan night club and open until 2am of the weekend. This location is HUGE compared to the original in New York. It's spacious and modernly decorated. Service was pleasantly friendly. A server kept coming around asking if I needed more water. Much appreciated after a night out partying!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. Fries are so crunchy and good. The burgers are delicious. I'm drooling just thinking of it. My bfffs, bf, and I stopped by for a late lunch and it was pretty empty, no line. I want more!!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. Shake Shack serves my favorite burgers and I can't get them in California so whenever we come out to Vegas I make it a point to come here at least once. Their patties are never too greasy, buns are soft and lightly toasted, and the fixings are always fresh. People usually forget that Shake Shack started off as a hot dog stand but give the Shack-cago Dog a try and you'll realize that Shake Shack is more than just burgers and shakes. On that note, you have to order their crinkle cut fries too and if you like cheese, definitely add that cheese sauce. It's straight up liquid crack, it's so addictive!

The frozen custard is also ridiculously creamy and delicious. I just tried their holiday cookie flavor this week and it just might be my favorite yet, too bad it's seasonal. Vanilla is usually my default when ordering.

The interior is spacious and even though in recent times I feel like Shake Shack is becoming insanely popular, the ordering line moves fast and usually a table will open up while you're waiting for your food to be ready. It's a surprisingly relaxing place to eat and the staff is always kind. Even though they close at midnight, they'll accept orders right up to the last minute and they won't kick you out if you happen to be inside still past midnight."}
{"text":"I love Shake Shack. Is it overpriced? Absolutely. Is it worth it? I say yes.

I had originally been to the Strip location and really love their burgers. I don't know what they do to them, but they are able to get great flavors. 

My hubby needed to pick up a new library card at the Paseo Verde library, so we decided to head to the District for dinner afterwards.

The staff was super friendly, the Gentleman who assisted us (Ron I believe) was very kind and thanked us for coming in.

My hubby tried the Shack-Cago dog for the 1st time. Although it was tasty (I tried it), it was too small for almost $5. I was starving and got a double shack burger and we shared bacon cheese fries. We also split a concrete for dessert and I ordered the Shackmeister beer, made by Brooklyn Brewery. 

Overall, everything was delicious. I like the restaurant itself, it's laid out well and there is a foosball table, plus patio seating. This isn't a regular stop for us, but I love the convenience of it being at GVR instead of having to go all the way to the Strip. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I would usually wait to visit a couple of times before reviewing a new business, but Shake Shack managed to knock it out of the park on the first try, so here it goes...

They've been open for 2 days now and I figured it would be a mad house.  I was there around 4:30pm and although it was busy, they had plenty of cashiers and there was no line. (I had a friend who went around 12:30 and said that it was a 45 minute wait, so be prepared to wait during peak lunch hours)

The staff is all very friendly and helpful and there is a large menu just as you enter.  There are also paper menus at each cash register. As you order, you can see into the kitchen, which is always nice.

They seem to have more than enough staff to cover the opening. It appeared as if things were (basically) running smoothly. I did see a couple of hiccups while waiting for my order, but everything was fixed immediately.

I ordered take-out and it didn't take long for my food to be ready. The food is all reasonably priced, unlike most Strip restaurants.  The cashier gave me my receipt and a buzzer to notify me when my food was ready.

They have a couple of areas of counter space where you can get ketchup, mustard, napkins, mayo, etc. They even had to go cups for the condiments, which is nice.

The décor is super cute.  There doesn't appear to be tons of seating, but there are low tops, high tops and booths, along with a small round bench for people waiting for take out.

Now for the burger....I ordered the double Shack burger ($7.99), which is a very basic burger with 2 patties, cheese, lettuce, tomato and Shack sauce. I also ordered a side of crinkle cut fries ($2.95). For being \"no frills,\" this burger packed major flavor.  Consider me impressed.  The fries were also very good. I like that they are fat and not wimpy like some other places.

My coworker ordered the 'Shroom Burger, which is vegetarian. It's a fried Portobello mushroom, filled with both cheddar and muenster cheese, topped with lettuce and tomato and Shack Sauce. I love meat, but this seriously looked and smelled so delicious that I can't wait to try it.

I also can't wait to go back for the desserts - they obviously specialize in shakes, but they make theirs with custard instead of ice cream.

They have a great beer selection, and I love that they have made an effort to support local businesses (Bad Beat Brewing has a beer on tap and Gimme Some Sugar's banana peanut butter cheesecake is in the All Shook Up concrete).

They are also active in the community, with 5% of sales from the \"All Shook Up\" concretes going to the First Friday Foundation.

I expect this place to be very successful, and they are off to a great start!"}
{"text":"This was on my must try list on my most recent trip to Vegas. We came here for a late night snack at midnight and the line was still insanely long. I ordered the shack stack and a side of fries. 

Shack Stack: 4/5 stars. Delicious! Especially with that fried Portobello mushroom with cheese oozing out yummm. The burger was smaller than I thought it would be... so it's definitely a bit pricey considering it was almost $10. It also came out lukewarm--it would've been even better had it come out hot. 

Fries: 3/5. Pretty standard fries. Came out nice and hot. 

We came back the next day to try their concrete and I must say that I was immensely disappointed by it.  We ordered a vanilla with the truffle cookie dough mix in and a vanilla with strawberry puree mixed in. It wasn't really anything special and for about $4 a scoop I should've just gotten regular ice cream elsewhere. 

Overall, I would come back for the burger but I would skip the custard and concrete."}
{"text":"Food: Hamburger, shack-cago hot dog, fries, fifty-fifty (half unsweetened ice tea/half lemonade), chocolate shake. Ingredients tasted fresh and I liked their fries, which were crispy and potato-y. They don't have kids size hamburgers, but the hamburgers already seemed kind of kid size, but just the right size so you have room for a shake! 

Service: Very service oriented. Reminded my of Chik-fil-A in that they give you a buzzer when you pay and then after you sit, a server asks if he can take your buzzer and bring it to you when it's ready. They also offer to get you free refills of your drink. There seems to be a lot of workers available to clean up and get you what you need.

Ambiance: I really like the added fun for the kids of the foosball table and the shuffleboard table. The place was very clean. I also liked the handy water station.

Location: So happy to have another family-friendly place to go in The District. We've been going to Smashburger, which I still really enjoy those juicy hamburgers, but I really like the location of this place plus the fun stuff of the kiddos."}
{"text":"As good as the New York locations. 

Now that I can say I've tried all of the burgers, the Shack Stack is my favorite. The dogs are pretty good too, but you can't beat the burgers here. 

The cheese fries are a must as well!"}
{"text":"After enjoying a strawberry shake from the Shake Shack in New York last year, I was excited to hear that one was opening in Phoenix.. I had not previously tried the burgers so I was looking forward to try one.. We ordered 2 cheeseburgers,2 crinkle fries and 2 milkshakes .. The price was $32 which I thought was a little high.. The burgers were were small and just ok.. little on the greasy side as well.. The fries were served warm, they keep them under a heat lamp which is odd since they cook your burger fresh,  the fries should be also.. The strawberry milk shake was good but we asked for no whip cream but they served it with the whip cream... The restaurant is clean with very nice friendly employees .. Overall would not come here again.. Would be better off going to Five Guys if you are in the mood for great burgers!!"}
{"text":"Very nice! Really enjoyed my hotdog here! The price is ok, but hey, it's in Vegas!

I liked how they had the calories listed beside the hotdog too.
The decor is nice and modern inside. Bathrooms were clean.
There is a patio outside so you can people watch or listen to the street performers.

I would return."}
{"text":"Living on the west coast, I've never heard of Shake Shack before. My cousin told me that New Yorkers pretty much go crazy for these burgers. So we all decided to try it out for the very first time. 

We walk in as a group of 4. The lines looked long but they went by pretty fast. I ordered the Shack burger and a chocolate milk shake. The food came out within 10 minutes. When I first saw the burger, it looked like a Mcdonalds cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato. I didn't realize how small the burger was going to be. I literally ate the burger in 4 bites. No lie. I was a bit hung over still so I figured the a single shack burger would be enough. The patty to me seemed pretty flavorful. Our group ordered 2 cheese fries. Big mistake for me. I didn't really enjoy cheese on the fries. I think I was just craving more of the plain fries with ketchup. My chocolate milk shake was okay. I tried the strawberry milkshake too and it was also okay. 

Overall, I was not blown away by this place at all. Maybe if I tried the burger where it was born (on the east coast), it would have tasted better. Probably because its in Vegas it was just okay. But then again, based off of what I had, In-N-Out poops on this place. Maybe because I'm a west coaster, but In-N-Out in all aspects is better than this place. Maybe when I go back to vegas I'll give this place another go or i'll just drive a little and get In-N-Out. 

PS: TVs everywhere here. Perfect place to watch the games."}
{"text":"We shared the expensive, double smoke stack- it was ok tasting.  However, the fries were delicious!"}
{"text":"I like Shake Shack a lot. It was one of the first places I went to eat with my husband (then boyfriend) and I'm emotional so there's that. They were like just becoming popular when I moved out of NY and the only ones I knew of were the one right by my school in Westbury, the one inside Penn Station, and one random one we found one day walking from the Museum of Natural History. And now I know this one, located inside the Scottsdale Fashion Center. This was my first time in Scottsdale, period, and all I have to say is it must be nice to be rich, lol. Anyway, I love that all Shake Shacks have treats themed around whatever area they're in, that's super cute. But Shake Shack was already fairly pricy so once you put one inside of a mall you're dealing with really overpriced burgers and hotdogs. My husband ordered a Shack Burger with regular fries and I ordered cheese fries and a black and white shake. I remember begrudgingly ordering that shake because I KNEW it wasn't going to be $6 worth of shake but to my surprise  the waitress swiped a coupon and I got it for free so thank you, sis! But for $6 I want a lot of shake, I want a shake and that it was not. It was delicious though, my first time ordering a black and white. I love their crinkle fries and I think their cheese sauce is super tasty, my husband is not a fan but he's picky. I have to really be in the mood for a burger to order one but I had a bite of my husband's and I would put the Shack Burger way above any burger from In & Out, Sonic, McDonalds or Burger King, for sure. It even looks fresher. So yay, I'm still a fan and I love the fact that it's so far from my house because if it wasn't I'd probably go more often and that would make the Shake Shack experience not as special for me."}
{"text":"We had been looking forward to trying Shake Shack but I must tell you I'm not disappointed in the food just the portions and the pricing.
I don't think $33 for two hamburgers, two milkshakes and a soft drink is a good value. Don't get me wrong, the food was fine but I feel the prices are too high when you can get just as good quality at half the price at In-n-Out."}
{"text":"I purchased the smoke house burger with a fry and a black and white shakea companied by a shack-cago dog. First off the burger was pretty good not the best but it was descent. My shake was thick and tasted amazing. The fries were average they were ok. But the thing that stole the show for me was the hot dog it was Amazing. Flavorful and al I'd recommend the hot dog."}
{"text":"The hubby and I went here for lunch yesterday.  It was our first time.  We were greeted by Tee (turns out she is the manager) and she offered to help us navigate the menu.  We got 2 burgers and fries, and we got to try the hot dog.  To say this food is delicious is an understatement!!  It was fabulous, just burger comfort food to the max.  Everybody there was friendly, the place was super clean, and having a manager make sure that our first time there was a good experience was a major bonus.  It makes a difference when you feel that somebody really cares that you support their business and that you get a good bang for the buck.  The burger buns are soft as silk, the burger meat was cooked perfectly and was delicious!  The hot dog was great too!  You want to get a side of the melted cheese for the fries and dog, worth it.  Trust me.  This place will now be in our lunch rotation.  (We are going back today, we just can't help ourselves!)..."}
{"text":"Came with my friends to see what all the hype was about. We went on a Monday afternoon, so the line wasn't too bad. We only had to wait about 5 minutes before our order was taken. The cashiers were super friendly. 

I wasn't that hungry, so I opted for some cheese fries and a concrete. When I received my order, the fries were crispy and delicious. The cheese was a bit salty, but great on top of the fries. The concrete that I had gotten, on the other hand, was really disappointing. As soon as I got it, it was already half melted. Since it was called a concrete... i thought it'd be a little more \"concrete\"... ya know? 

My friends both said that their burgers were good. The patties were a good size, but they both agreed that the meat was a little on the dry side and both said that they couldn't taste the \"shack sauce.\"

Overall, it fell below our initial expectations. It wasn't a horrible experience.. neither was it a phenomenal one. I probably won't be back. 

Three stars: For the average food and the good service."}
{"text":"Delicious. 
Cheese fries = heaven.
Buns are soo soft. 
Chicken sandwich is big and crispy. 
Cheeseburger is perfect size and hits the spot.  
The wait has been really long on occasion, and finding a seat can be tricky. Go at off times."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time at Shake Shake, we have one here in Dallas but, I wanted to wait and go to the one in Vegas! And I'm glad I did!! 

Burger: 

The cashier suggested I ordered the Smoke Shack. I was not impressed w/the chopped cherry pepper. Don't get me wrong the burger was cute! But, I know what I wanted & should've just went w/the ShackBurger add bacon, I'll know next time. 

Fries:

The table had bacon and cheese fries, they were ok probably would of been better had the cheese been hot!? I played it safe and ordered the regular fries & they were good. 

Shake:

I could not resist so I ordered the black & white & it was thick & smooth. Wish they had bigger straws, you will need a spoon! 

I will visit Shake Shack again..."}
{"text":"Had the smokeshack burger and it was delicious. Glad we have one in Los Angeles now. Those chopped cherry peppers were amazing"}
{"text":"Went opening day and second day of business, both days consistent service, food, and quality across the board. Best quality hamburger and fresh potato roll!! Fries are the perfect mix of crunchy and soft. Shakes are tasty and not too filling. Second day, treated myself to a hot dog and the chicken sandwich...wow! Chik Fil A watch out!!! Great tasting sandwich!! Hot dog is very, very, close to surpassing Portillos. Bottom line, go if you like quality, tasty food that is not greasy, too well done, or doesn't sit well with your stomach after eating.  Highly recommended!!!! Cannot wait for the location at Kierland to open!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this location!! Best chicken sandwich, grilled or breaded! Shakes are awesome. Best hamburgers and tasty quality hamburger buns. Highly recommend!!  DEFINITELY get the Shake Shack app!!! Saves time and allows you to order and pay in advance."}
{"text":"After reading some of the articles about this chain I decided to try it while in Vegas since they haven't expanded to all large cities. Ordered the chicken sandwich which is very crispy but not as moist and tasty as Chick-fil-A which hasn't made it to Las Vegas and may not given their religious beliefs. The fries and shake were OK. Staff was a little spacey on Monday morning."}
{"text":"SO OVERRATED. A cheeseburger, shake, and fries cost me $20. That's like three combos at In-n-out. I found the burger to be mushy, and the fries were really plain. However, the shake was really good. I would only come back for the shakes or dessert. In-n-out wins hands down."}
{"text":"Nom Nom! Is all I have to say. Our 2nd time here and we always put Shake Shack on our places to eat while in Vegas. On this trip we ordered cheese fries, vanilla shake, lemonade, and 2 Shackburgers (bill total $25). On a chilly December day at lunch time, service was quick and friendly and line was pretty short. We quickly grabbed a seat at the communal table and waited for our food. Really the star of the this meal was the burger! Bun is soft, condiments are good, but it's really the meaty flavor of the burger that won me over. Dare I say I prefer the Shackburger to my beloved In-&-Out? I might just say that! Just try it, you won't be disappointed by the hype."}
{"text":"The Shake stack shroom burger and a side of cheese fries are to die!!! My husband got the bacon cheeseburger which was just ok. If you're going to go to shake shack, the only thing you need to order is the shake stack and cheese fries!"}
{"text":"Food was cold and also the girl who is in giving out the food and drinks is so unpleasant. If you don't like your job or being around people (aka customers) then I suggest you find a different job. Everyone is here to have a good time and all she did was make us pissed and left a bad taste in our mouth."}
{"text":"I I am a huge shack fan after first discovering it in NYC Times Square. So I was so excited that it was coming to Vegas a little closer to home. 

Shack-cago dog is my fav. Love those crinkle fries. 

My only complain is the shakes are made ahead of time. Still awesome taste but not a firm as they should be. 

Shake shack is still my all time favorite burger place."}
{"text":"I heard this might give 5 Guys some competition so I decided to give it a try. The place was packed. Line almost out the door. Yet my order came out fast. Impressive. I had the Smokeshack burger and it was delicious. Burger was seasoned. Fries were crisp. Food was good but the sitting wasn't. I wish I could give this place a 4.5 but since no .5 system...4 is good. I didn't like the seats. *shrug* Also, need more seasoning on my fries...if they do that."}
{"text":"I love this place, also the camelback location. My husband craves burgers and now he craves Shake Shack. That's ok. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. I want to especially thank Vonda!!! She is totally about customer satisfaction. What a wonderful person!!!"}
{"text":"As good as New York!

Favorite is the Shack Stack burger! Love the fried portobello mushrooms filled with cheese. Nomnom! Cant forget about the cheese fries! 

Definitely check out it when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've heard the legends about this place and I've seen the pics of it about 1000 times on my snapchat and Instagram. When I came to Vegas with my friends we made sure to make this the first place we eat when we landed. It's at the beginning of the strip and we stayed at treasure island. If your familiar with the strip, you'd know it's on opposite ends. It was about a 30 minute walk just b/c there's so many people and it's not a straight walk. We were also really hungry so the walk seemed even longer. Shake Shack is located at NY NY and has a restaurant front you can't miss. You fall in line to take your order and then they give you a pager while you wait. There's a ton of seating both inside and outside that it's never really a problem. Their restaurant is so cute. I really enjoyed the retro look to it.

Their menu has a lot of options. They gave different burger variations, chicken sandwiches, crinkle cut fries and many different shake/custard/malt options. I ordered the trailer burger (burger with grilled onions and bacon) and a side of fries. Their burgers don't come with a side of fries. I only wish I ordered a milkshake, but my friend ended up not finishing hers so I finished her strawberry milkshake and it was delicious. Their burger and fries were so good. Best way I can describe it is that it's a higher quality innout burger. I think it's better than innout. It is pretty pricey though. My burger and fries were about $13. But you get what you pay for right? It was cooked perfectly and it was so good. At first it doesn't look that filling but I was so full afterwards. My boyfriend and guy friends were still hungry afterward words though and they ordered doubles. 

Overall, great burger place. More expensive, but way worth it with the quality. I will be eating here everytime I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is the new hype in Vegas so we knew it was a must on our trip. 

We got there early on a Saturday afternoon. The line was not too bad, about a 15-20 minute wait. You must order first and they will call you when your order is ready. 

I decided to go with a hamburger with lettuce, pickles, and onion with shack sauce. I thought my burger was delicious. I thought it was better than in n out cause of the bread they use. The bread was nice and soft and it soaks up the juice perfectly. I could eat this burger forever. 

I also got an order of crinkle cut cheese fries and jackpot concretes. I thought the two didn't live up to the hype. 

Shake shack is a little bit more expensive than the fast burger joint here. I would skip the sides and just get the burgers time and time again."}
{"text":"Shake Shack never disappoints! We visit this location often to avoid the chaos on the strip. The food is always on point, quick, fresh and cooked to perfection. We will undoubtedly continue to be repeat customers!"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning here this past weekend. Based on an article I found regarding food poisoning at NYC Shake Shacks, it's now nationwide. Fever, chills, diarrhea. Thanks for ruining my Vegas trip! 

I got a cheese burger, cheese fries, and a concrete. Cheese fries and concrete were shared with my husband, who was fine. But my cheeseburger was only eaten by me. I doubt the quality of the meat truly allows you guys to safely serve it medium rare. That, or your food safety needs to be given a second look. We also got our food last out of our group of 6 despite ordering first and having the smallest order...

On to the food quality and taste--it's just okay. Definitely not worth the price, nor is it worthy of the hype. I could make something better at home with Costco ground beef and ore-ida fries. 

I had it in NYC last year and wanted to try it again since I thought maybe my dislike was a fluke. Nope. Reconfirmed my dislike, and I will NEVER BE BACK AGAIN! 

Thanks for the memories... Or lack of memories from my husbands 30th birthday weekend since I was stuck in bed or in the bathroom all weekend."}
{"text":"Get in my belly! Mmmmmmm. This is the spot! Reminding me of the Central Park experience I had 10 years ago!"}
{"text":"Visited shake shack with some friends and bf on 2 separate Vegas trips. The line seemed to always be long and out the door. But don't let that deter you from trying shake shack! The line moves quite fast! 

I got the shack burger both times. People I know always seem to compare it to in n out burger, but I personally don't see it. The buns here are what makes their burgers impressive. They're soft and yummy! I much prefer the sauce at in n out though. Also the single burgers here are smaller than in n out ones for reference.

If you come here, definitely try their shakes! I ordered the Salted Vanilla Toffee and it was AH-MAZING!"}
{"text":"I took my kids there after school  today and apparently everyone had the same idea. The line was out the door and down the sidewalk.  Amazingly, it moved really fast.  When I asked about doing a bun less burger for my daughter who can't have gluten, the young lady taking my order was really helpful and conscientious about getting her order dialed in.  Despite a hectic atmosphere and total inundation of high school  and junior high students, our order came pretty fast and it was all delicious. The place didn't feel chaotic; just lively.  Our burgers were awesome; just the right size.  We loved the crinkly fries and the shakes were great. 

  I wanted to say all that before I tell the next part:  When the cashier rang up my order, I realized I didn't have my wallet.  In a panic I brought out my phone and asked about using Apple Pay.  The regional manager walked over and told me they weren't set up for that and then smiled and told me, lunch was on him.  I tried to hand off the little bit of cash I had and offered to go home and get my wallet. It was such a huge kindness, and I am now officially a loyal customer ,who promises to double check she has her wallet."}
{"text":"Ehhh... I was honestly kind of disappointed. I got the cheeseburger with bacon and it came with the \"special\" sauce and some red peppers. It was nothing special as the burger was pretty small and ordinary. The best dish was the loaded fries which was basically my burger topping on the fries including the peppers, bacon, sauce, and cheese. The fries were crinkle cut and nice and crispy. The lemonade? tasted like it was from a mix. Worst part? $7+ for the skimpy burger! Sorry New Yorkers, I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"Gotta try the Chicago Style hot dogs they are so good! overall good service and prices are decent"}
{"text":"$17 for lunch is a little pricey to me (especially for burgers and fries) but it was good. Went yesterday Sunday 5-10-15 around 1 PM. 
I had: 
Cheese fries (5/5) OMG loved these cheese fries....crispy crinkle-cut fries with cheese sauce...and not that neon yellow junk from a can.  Have you ever had Stouffers frozen mac & cheese?  Imagine that over french fries.  Amazeballs.  
Jackpot concrete $4.50 (2/5) Cloyingly sweet and the waffle pieces in it were super oily and kinda turned me off. The custard flavor of the week was Red Velvet which I hate so I chose a concrete.  Maybe I'll try a different one next time. 
Draft root beer $2.75 (5/5) One of the best home-made rootbeers I've ever had.  It's right up there with Ellis Island to me. 
Shack Burger $5.19 (3/5) Not bad...just not that great to me.  Reminds me of in-n-out.  It was drenched in their \"shack sauce\" which tastes like mayo, ketchup, and horseradish.  Not my bag but it was worth a try.  I was surprised to find Roma tomatoes on it."}
{"text":"It's a decent burger but it's greasy and way over priced. Fries are pretty good but a lot of them were soggy. Probably won't eat here again, food made me feel gross and not great the rest of the day."}
{"text":"People keep complaining that this place is expensive. We ordered a burger, hotdog, cheese fries, and a shake. 22 bucks, didn't seem like all that much to me. 

This is an upscale fast food type place. You order, sit down, and a little pager goes off when the food is ready. There was someone helping/cleaning up and she was amazing. 

We will for sure be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in the planet. BOOM! There, I said it!!! Sorry In-N-Out, its definitively NOT you guys!  Well, this joint is legit and their burgers are delicious. I try to go here every time we are in Vegas. Theres really no point in going elsewhere.  Fantastic and filling, this place is great before pool parties or before the club."}
{"text":"Came here for burger and fries and holy it was good. I thought there would be a huge line outside but I was pleasantly surprised that the line was not that long and the inside was huge with many table to sit and eat. This place was easy to find with its bright green lights and signs. 

They have different flavors of the week for the custard but I went and tried didn't think it was all that but I would go for their burgers, fries and milkshakes. Super cheap eat that we can get throughout the day."}
{"text":"Yummmm! So good here!!! This is the location to go to in Las Vegas.. The LVB location is horrible and tastes like Wendy's! The burgers here are on point! The food is always piping hot and service is great! The managers here are awesome! So good!!!!!! It's a must!!!"}
{"text":"This location is horrible! The food was so bad! It was our first experience with shake snack and I told myself I'd never go again! Tasted like Wendy's!!!! The cheese fries were the only good thing here . It wasn't until I went to shake shack in downtown summerlin and got a wayyyy better experience ... My advice .. Pass on this location.. It disappoints !"}
{"text":"First time at a Shake Shack... Had a Shack Stack and regular order of their crinkly fries. Burger was nothing special and the fries were ok. Portions were kinda small... check out the pics.

Service from the cashier was apathetic too...

Can't recommend the food or the location."}
{"text":"Loving this location and everyone who works here! It's always a great experience to shop around and have a burger. I'm seriously in love with the chicken burger. I think I love the fact that there is always this lady who come around asking if we need anything like forks or water. I always forget to ask for her name but she's wonderful. There's a lot of space to sit inside and some seating areas outside as well. They have great options if you are can't decide whether you want a chicken burger, beef or vegetarian. I tried their chicken hot dog here and it's pretty good! I can't complain. I always take family to this location because it's closer to home and not as busy as the strip. My mom tried their bacon burger and so did my cousin. It must be really good because my cousin totally finished it in a blink of an eye. Like literally!! I was surprise so that means she liked it. Cheese fries are probably my favorite style fries because I love cheese! If have to update this post the next time I go there. They have your self serve water, condiments and utensil bar after you order. Beers on tap. Delicious shakes! Can't go wrong with a simple vanilla. It's perfect on those hot summer days. Happy eating!!"}
{"text":"As a former resident of NYC, I couldn't wait for Shake Shack to open! Hard to believe we finally have one in Charlotte. Even on opening day, the quality of the food was just like in NY. My favorites are the Shroom Burger and cheese fries. It's a nice touch to have local beer options. 

A few things to note for first time visitors. 1. It's fast food, but you can't think of it as fast food. The quality is much higher which makes it more expensive. Think of it like going out to eat. 2. There will be a wait. Just expect it. Even opening day I waited 30 minutes. In Shake Shack world, that's not bad. 3. They have an app now that you can order food in advance. Use it. 

Great place! I highly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"Coming from LA, many people would compare Shake Shack to In-n-Out. If you get the Shack Burger, it's simple. I would prefer In-n-Out better than the Shack. But if you get the SHACK STACK, it's BOMB. I'm not a huge mushroom fan, but it's delish! It's the Shack burger with the fried mushroom. It felt like it melted in my mouth. With a touch of crisp. The Cheese Fries are good too!
Also, if you purchase a beer, the pint size is just a cup, but if you purchase the mug size, you get their special mug for free (:"}
{"text":"Yup. Still a loyal fan of the franchise. First time at this one in Vegas, but just as good as the ones in New York. Honestly, if you want to understand the hype, you have to order the Shroom Burger. Try something you can't find in other burger joints and you'll appreciate this place a little more. I can feel the saliva building up in my mouth as I recall the details of my meal. 

Shroom Burger + Fries + Black & White Shake

Long lines because people know it's worth the wait. I still love in-n-out, but try the shroom and you too will drool a little when recalling your cheesy experience dining at shake shack."}
{"text":"I spent $28 dollars there on food for just myself and didnt regret any of it. I would take shots of the cheese sauce if they were available. I would equate me going to Shake Shack when I go to Las Vegas like a trip to Mecca."}
{"text":"Shack Shake got it right again in NC! I've been to several of the locations across the US and this newly opened restaurant only had one issue.. too many people wanting to get in. No need to worry though, once the hype dies down a little (or they open another in Charlotte), that problem will be solved. On this visit I tried my first shroom burger and chicken sandwich, both held up to the beefy standards set forth by other Shack offerings. Go to here, try it, leave with a full belly!"}
{"text":"Wow. Heard about this place. Finally made it here .
The burger was so soft and yummy. Melts in your mouth.
It's up there with In and out , Habit. Took some time before my order was up  . Well worth the wait. The fries were delicious, could have been s little warmer .
The tables haven't been clean up yet. So I star deducted.
All in all good experience. Stop in when your in the area. You won't be disappointed.. ?"}
{"text":"This should read 3.5 rather than 4, but I usually round up. 
I think this place is definitely more hype than the taste of the burger. 
There was nothing impressive about the burger itself. I guess I was just disappointed because all my friends hyped it up so much that when I actually did try it, it was a little underwhelming. 
My comrades and I ordered a variety of the burgers including the fried mushroom burger. Which was okay. Nothing to run and tell mom's about. 
The French fries were subpar. 
I may come back and try the chicken selections which I heard were a little better than the need burgers. 
The reason why I'm giving it 3.5 stars is because of the overall experience and vibe. It has a very trendy decor and ambiance. The burgers were okay. But maybe it was a fluke that day. You'll just have to try it out for yourself. But don't get too excited. If it does exceed your expectations, then it was a plus!!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the visit! I had the Smoke Shack Burger with Applewood Bacon & it was juicy and made perfectly. The crinkle fries were crispy & not too greasy. Just how I like my fries!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite hamburgers & the fries are excellent crinkle cutters.

The chicken sandwiches are also really great, but I love the burgers so much that I almost never order it.

Also love that they have glasses for super cold water already set out.

Nice building & interior. Plenty of seating and TVs."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite at Downtown Summerlin.  The burgers are so tasty and the bun is delish!  
The hot dogs are also yummy!   The service is very friendly!  They come around a lot and will refill your drink!"}
{"text":"For the price, one of the worst meals I have had. More processed than McDonalds, took 20 minutes to get me a burger, shake and cheese fries. WAY TOO SALTY."}
{"text":"The burger is fairly basic but tasty, and I think they use fairly high quality meat, since they by default cook it medium (so, they're not giving you garbage quality meat). Service was running a bit slow when I went there. But while I do think In n Out is a little better, I would say that Shake Shack is in the upper tier or fast(ish) burger joints around."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is better.  There, I said it.

A greasy, thin-pattied burger.  For what it was, it was good. I could have used a lot more lettuce and tomato.  The peppery sauce they used was alright, but the peppers actually hurt the flavor.  The crinkly fries were a bit dull.  My wife disliked her too-small and not-spicy-as-claimed chicken sandwich.

I very much liked their house ale, which was easy to drink and a lot better than some bud light.

Vegas prices are ridiculous.  I'd feel like these prices were at least twice as high and maybe even three times higher than they should be.

In-N-Out is better.  Five Guys is worse.  The Habit is about equal."}
{"text":"Our food was delicious when we just went about and hour ago. I got a burger and it tasted so good! But the bun was like, not baked. But it was great! Definitely a must!"}
{"text":"Remember, there is no such thing as burger monogamy. We are allowed to love multiple burgers at once.

I honestly waited until I tried Shake Shack a few times to come to this conclusion. I wanted to make absolute sure that I was not making a mistake. Yes, Shake Shack is more expensive. Value-wise, there is no competition to In-N-Out, but if you don't take into account price, then the burger at Shake Shack tastes better. Simple as that.

The griddled meat is the star of the show, as it should be in any burger. That sear develops a crust that adds so much flavor to the burger itself.

This may be a preposterous and unpopular conclusion as a California kid, but I love Shake Shack. And guess what, I also love In-N-Out. There. I said it. Don't @ me.

PS Don't get the Hot Chick'n."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this after the hype but was not impressed. Very overpriced burger and food. Fries seemed frozen and re heated. Will not be coming back to waste my money"}
{"text":"I've heard really good things about Shake Shack for so long so I seized the opportunity to go. First off, the line was insane and took at least 30 minutes to just order. The food was good, but it didn't live up to the hype for me. I got the Shack Stack, it was delicious and did the job well for me. My main issue was the fries, they were really basic and tasted like they came out of a frozen bag and were thrown in the fryer. The concrete shake was really good, the Belgium waffle mix in added something unique in flavor. It was good, but that's all it was. Would have been just as satisfied if not more satisfied with In-N-Out."}
{"text":"The hype is real, y'all. 

Burgers are juicy, cooked to medium perfection. I tried the Smoke Shack (the cherry peppers add a little bit of a kick that partners well with the crispy and salty bacon) and the ShackBurger (fresh veg that didn't overpower the meat and cheese combo). 

The Chick'n Shack wasn't too shabby - the chicken was cooked well, kinda crispy breading that tasted slightly like the KFC breading of their original fried chicken. Though I enjoyed the potato bread they served these on, that was the only gripe of the people I was with. They said it tasted slightly sweeter than, say, the In and Out burger bun. 

Fries are good - nothing extraordinary but don't mistake these crinkle cut fries for the ones they used to serve with hot lunches at school. These had a slight crunch on the outside and tasted fresh unlike the crinkle fries of the late night Del Taco run variety. 

Now the shakes ... I've tried the seasonal Blueberry Pie Shake and then the Chocolate shake the next time I was here. Let me just say, if you like thick milkshakes, this is your jam. But even though the burger and fries combo doesn't look daunting it fills you up fast. So if you do order a shake, try sharing. 

Would definitely go back to try the hot dogs people keep raving about."}
{"text":"Over hyped!!! Save yourself the money and hit up in n out for better burgers with a much better price! Couple girlfriends and I stopped by here after a long drive to vegas and was not satisfied! Burger was bland and the cheese on the fries tasted weird. Long wait and food was not good. 3 stars because location allowed us to sit outside and view the busy vegas strip! At least the water tasted filtered and fresh!"}
{"text":"How can you not love a juicy burger with a shake for cheat day?  I don't often do cheat days, but when I do... you will find me at a burger joint. It's a casual dining spot, so you can come here for a quick bite or with a group of friends. 

We were actually walking into Public School but since we have been there multiple times we decided to give this place a shot.  This place was SO yummy.  First off, I love ALL- natural beef (no hormones or antibiotics).  I ordered the SmokeShack burger with fries.  The meat was juicy, the cheese was fresh and the bun was soft :) Hungry yet? Check it out!"}
{"text":"Not your typical fast food joint that's for sure. The line was a little intimidating at first looking at the place but luckily that went pretty quick. The menu placing was great. It was just all printed out on a giant wall while you waited in line. I had ordered their original burger and fries then the frozen custard with waffle pieces was to die for. The meal was so good after it arrives in a quick manner which was nice to not have to wait long. The burger was very soft and had very good flavor. You can really taste the difference from a regular fast food joint. This is definitely a place to visit again!"}
{"text":"Meh. Taste like Wendy's. Frozen fries...was away overpriced. Wouldn't come again. Hamburgers good ingredients but again...meh. Wish they left the grass to hang out instead. Decent patio for dogs."}
{"text":"Excellent food. A great burger and fries outstanding lemonade. With the drive. I'll come back"}
{"text":"When u walk in, the line may seem super long but it actually moves quite quickly. Got to the front in about 10-15 mins. This review is based on my 3rd time visiting this location. I got the Shack Stack the first two times and I got the Chick'n Shack my last time here. I gave it two stars because I was not impressed with the burgers at all. This place is way over hyped. 

-1 star for the price. This place is freaking expensive for a tiny burger. I can pay the same amount and a little bit more for a gourmet burger at a restaurant. 

-1 star for the presentation. The Chick'n Shack looked like a McChicken from MickeyDs which I can get for $2. I paid $6 for this. 

-1 star for the taste. The burger doesn't taste as fresh as it looks on the pictures. The ingredients seems to be lacking. 

Overall, this place reminds my friends and I of an up-scaled McDonald. I rather go to McDonald than here haha. I probably won't return next time i'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"We ordered two double shackburgers and they were tasty, but GREASY. The fries are nothing special and are like ore-ida golden crinkles from the supermarket. The shakes were good. We had chocolate and strawberry. The restaurant is nice outside the NY NY with a huge HDTV and multiple TV's. I can now say I've been to a Shack Shack, but I would only go back for a shake. I'll stick with In-N-Out on the other side of the 15 freeway and get a better quality product at a price that is much less."}
{"text":"Great customer service from one of their employees. Food was warm and so delicious. Yummy yummy."}
{"text":"I've always heard about Shake Shack from all my friends who have visited New York but never got the chance to try. Super happy they decided to open one in Vegas even though I live in California :') 

Stopped by here over the weekend on my way to Utah. Once you walk in they take you through a Disneyland type waiting line. The girl who took my order was super sweet and helped me pick out a burger since it was my first time.

I ordered the Shack Stack a cheeseburger combined with the shroom burger which has a delicious crispy portobello mushroom filled with both ooey goodness of melted cheeses and muenster cheeses topped with lettuce and tomato. SO SO GOOD!! Especially with their shacksauce! Must try!!

I also had a side order of their fries that I sprinkled with a bunch of pepper and dipped in ketchup, my fave :') I can't wait to visit Vegas again and stop by shack stack and try all the other things on their menu!!"}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of burger places in Las Vegas. And this one is by far one of my personal favorite. The burgers here are amazing, and they are always introducing new burgers for customers. My personal favorite are the hotdogs, because there's not a lot of good places around Las Vegas to grab a nicely done hotdog. The custard here is amazing, and they also make their own wine and beer! If your in town for vacation, this is MUST. :)"}
{"text":"A deliciously, decadent burger! We had the double bacon burger and fries. We came in at 11pm and it wasn't overly crowded. Service was friendly and really quick! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by someone staying at New York New York and we gave it a shot. I had higher expectations honestly. The biggest thing that got to me was the size of the burger. Tiny as hell for the price. It didn't even have anything on it when it came out. Just 2 buns and the meat. I had to ask for the insides lol It's a flipping burger that stuff should automatically come on it if I'm spending more than $4. The fries and the shake was the best part. Crispy fries and a very bold chocolate taste. Needs to be thicker however. But seriously corporate needs to not skimp on the size of the burgers. Dissapointing! In-N-Out has bigger burgers and that's saying something!!"}
{"text":"Amazing concrete...seriously!!!!

Been dreaming of the vanilla custard, mixed with banana peanut butter cheesecake chunks, topped with chocolate toffee pieces!  Such a great combo. 

If you are near New York New York Casino, use the express line outside and get one! Yummmmmm!!!"}
{"text":"Having just went to shake shack in Baltimore on Pratt st I can say this new location in AZ is huge compared to it (so much indoor and outdoor seating)! Place is pretty empty right now (8:40pm on a Friday), but I could see it getting more packed as more people discover it. 

****Be advised any who think this a \"fast food\" place. Food comes out quick, but not that fast. There's a reason why there isn't a drive through window and they have a stack of 50+ pagers.****

That being said, the food came out hot, delicious, not very greasy, and traveled well. Is this my new staple burger joint? Probably not, but I'll be back again. 

All things considered I'd say Shake Shack is somewhere between In N Out and Zinburger. Both in price, quality, environment, and overall dining experience.

*pro tip* get fry well! Super crispy and extra delicious!"}
{"text":"I don't eat red meat and to come to a burger place that serves Portobello mushrooms - FRIED portobello mushrooms with cheese inside, is the place for me. Unfortunately it doesn't come as a meal, fries and a drink come separately...but you surprisingly get full even after eating a smaller sized burger. I never have enough room to try their Malts or milkshakes! Hopefully my next visit I'll save some room :)"}
{"text":"Interior had an eco natural look. The music playing was epic, pop and hip hop. There was about a 15 minute wait for 2 chicken shack sandwiches, hot dog, fries and a small shake, not long at all The chicken sandwich was delicious, just very messy."}
{"text":"Not all shake shacks are the the same unfortunately. I've learned this the hard way and wasted my precious calorie intake on a VERY crispy chicken sandwich. The chicken breast also seemed half the size. Quality was very low. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Amazing strawberry shake and burger cooked perfectly to medium. I would definitely try this place again if I was in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The line was out the door but surprising it went by fast and there was plenty of seating inside and out.

I really like the extensive menu choices and especially the shakes.

The burger was just okay - not better than In N Out or Five Guys.

I usually love cheese on my fries, but they weren't the best here."}
{"text":"Overall: Shake Shack is overhyped and overpriced.

Food: 1

Hamburger: For $5, I was disappointed by the size of the burger. It's as small as the In-N-Out burger, but it's twice the price. The meat was too salty, and the potato roll was soggy because it wasn't toasted. The only redeeming quality were the crisp, fresh veggies.

Griddled Chick'N Club: Again, I expect a larger or better made burger for a whopping $7. But this burger suffered from the same faults as the original hamburger, the chicken was salty and the potato roll lacked substance against the meat and veggies stuffed inside.

Service: 4

The cashier that took my order did a great job of answering questions since it was our first time, and she got our order correct despite our numerous specifications.

Ambiance: 5

This would definitely be a nice place to hang out with friends or family. There's plenty of seating, tvs, and foosball tables."}
{"text":"Too expensive for what you get!  Bread and fries are nothing special.  Meat patty was tasty, but for $42 for three people? Fool me once..."}
{"text":"The day we visited, there were long long waiting line. It was first time to try their burgers. 
Bun was pretty soft and melted on my tongue. Petty was cooked perfectly and juicy.
Only thing that I'm not satisfied is veggie were not fresh and very small amount. 

Compared with In&out burger: Price is more than double price of In&out. I think In&out is worth for money but if you want different type of burger, Shake Shack is the one of choice."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm local and I go down to the strip for this! I'm glad they have another location too and have been to that one yet usually I'm near the strip and it's so worth parking and walking. Amazing food and just an array of choices to choose from! Definitely happy giving this place my business! And the staff is amazing!"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom! 

The menu was the perfect! Not too overwhelming but not too limited. The burgers are absolutely delicious and their shake options are yummy too. The staff was friendly, attentive, and gave great recommendations when you're stuck on what to get."}
{"text":"I came here with my sister. I'm a Vegan and my sister is not. When I ordered shroom burger for my sister, I asked if they can make shroom burger for Vegan. They said \"what do you mean, this is for Vegetarian, not for Vegan.\" That it. They didn't explain the reason why they can't make it. Anyway, I ordered \"black& white shake\". The cashier asked again. I said \"black&white shake\". Then I saw she wrote \"Vanilla Shake\". What kind of the service is that."}
{"text":"Really don't see wtbfd is about this place  ok I can get buzzed drinking is drunk  driving  here. I'm at half-raised about this joint  - Juan Moore  double  oh  nuthin"}
{"text":"My friend did an expose' on who has the best franchise burgers, and Shake Shack ranked #1 on his list, so that made it a must go to place for me.

I wasn't as impressed as him. I had a single Shackburger and a peanut butter milkshake. Granted the burger had decent flavor, and I probably should have gone with a double to get a little more meat because it was small, for $5.19.
The milkshake was $5.25, and if you have read my previous reviews regarding milkshakes, you can't serve an expensive milkshake and only provide 12 oz of creamy goodness. It might have been 16 oz but if sure felt like 12. So that didn't work for me either. 

Place was pretty busy for a Tuesday at noon, with a lot of tourists. The wait for the burger was only 5 minutes, which is better than In and Out. They give you a pager so you can wander around looking for a table. Fortunately one opened up just as I got my burger.

I'll come back, try the double burger, maybe add some bacon. I'll stick to ice tea for a beverage. Now I have to go give my friend some crap about his burger list!"}
{"text":"I was drinking I was hungry heard a lot about this place it was OK but that's it white Castle was way better lol but this spot is a cool spot on the strip"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  Hella packed though.  Shake Shack is one of my \"must visit\" places whenever I hit Vegas.  I'm glad they opened one in California, and I go to that one too.  My favorite is the Shroom burger, and of course all their shakes."}
{"text":"Went in on a Thursday around 2pm. No line. I ordered the SmokeShack and the ShackBurger with cheese fries and a root beer. 

The staff was amazingly good. Friendly. Helpful. Funny. 

Order was up in less than 10 min. 

Food was killer. All of it was very good. I ran out of root beer and they gave me free refills. Free water is available by the condiments also btw. 

Great spot for a great burger in Vegas."}
{"text":"Shake Shack.  what the fuck.  its not nice to intrude into someone's territory and try and claim it as your own.  you have the east coast.  go back home.  the west coast is home to in n out.  

i heard so many good things about you, but you failed me.  :(
don't get me wrong, the food is delicious, but compared to in n out, its a joke. 
burgers are like 8-10 bucks if you get a double stack.  and the amount of people in this specific location is horrendous.  it took 5 mins just to get a refill.  wtf.  its so dumb that they do not have a sofa machine and you need to ask the people working there for a refill.  

we ended up getting the double shackburger and shack stack and cheese fries.
the burgers were decent, and they definitely fill you up, but its not worth the cost.  the shack stack was kinda interesting though... its a regular cheese burger with a crispy-fried portobello mushroom filled melted muenster and cheddar cheese.  the fries were also nothing special.  its just del taco wave fries with cheese.  i rather have my animal fries all day.

the only thing this place beats in n out on, is the interior decor.  but then again, its located in vegas, so everything is more flashy.  not worth the premium. 

i think you'll either hate it or love it.  there is no in-between.  
in n out for life."}
{"text":"It was our 1st time at the Shake Shack!! Actually, my husband & I have never heard of this place until we saw it in Vegas! We really liked the place! We enjoyed what we ate! I had their all beef hot dog , my husband had a burger & fries! I wish we had one of these places by my house. Their staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"The line was a bit long but well worth the wait!!!!  The burger was amazing!!!  I special ordered it and it was perfect!  Staff very helpful...menu is very easy to read...location is amazing and they have dog bones from a bakery to bring home for your fur baby and I did buy a bag which our pooch really likes!!!  Best burger ever!  Price was right!!!"}
{"text":"I don't care what people say! Shake shack was amazing! Something so simple, mastered to perfection! Every bite was filled with melted cheese and meat cooked perfectly!

Item ordered: chicken shack burger with cheddar cheese fries! 

I don't care about the rivalry between in n out and shake shack! They are both different and offer something unique to the table. Shake shack really stood out to me. The flavor gives you a kick of freshness with the taste of rich cheese and a well cooked chicken breast. Things got even better when we tried the bacon cheddar cheese fries! The melted cheesed was Fire! And the bacon pieces gave it an amazing tase.  

Overall, I really enjoyed shake shack! The menu was straight forward and the service was fast for a restaurant in vegas! Plenty of seating available! Just a great burger! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is definitely classic and delicious fast food fare.  And for 15$ on the las vegas strip, a great price. The service however needs to be better. Cashiers were rushing, food waa slow to finish and alot of orders were wrong for customers around me. Despite this, it was packed. The ups outweighed the downs."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the burger(SmokeShack) that I ordered. Burger patty was big and juicy and the fries were crispy with the right amount of salt! My friend and I agree that Shake Shack is definitely more upscale, therefore it doesn't fit in the category with in & out since in & out is a complete fast food chain. Overall, GOOD! Worth stopping by whenever you're in Vegas and looking for a cheaper meal"}
{"text":"I've never tried Shake Shack at other locations before but heard it is good so I gave this location a shot. I had hot dog and cheese fries, they were so good especially cheese fries! good portion and nice location in Outlet malls, Las Vegas. Shake Shack is a must for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service, food is great, but don't get what everyone is going crazy for? I ordered a burger, shake and cheese friesAnd was over $20. I think i can expect decent burger for this price anywhere?"}
{"text":"What makes the Shake Shack stand out from the rest is their juicy and thick patties, custard and surprisingly crispy and delicious not-your-cafeteria crinkle cut fries. Otherwise, the burgers are small, needed a pinch of salt and EXPENSIVE fow what it's worth. A burger alone will cost you close to $10. The food is good so I suggest it's worth trying for the first time it."}
{"text":"Don't remember the adorable guy who helped us with our order, but he was awesome! We had never eaten at Shake Shack before, but my sister insisted we eat there. We ordered a regular cheeseburger, a bacon cheeseburger (I think?), one of those loaded fries, an Arnold Palmer, and a peanut butter shake.

My husband got confused with the shakes and the ice cream choices. So the adorable cashier guy says, \"this is how I interpret it, you can eat it, lick it, or drink it\" while pointing at the different options. It made a lot of sense lol.

The staff were very friendly and nice and the food was yummy as well. The burgers were sadly on the small side though...not really worth the price tag."}
{"text":"Located in the middle of Kierland commons with plenty of tables inside and out. There's also a ping pong table outside for customers to play. 

This location is very efficiently run. Food is prepared fresh and comes out hot. Condiment corner is well stocked and cleaned regularly. 

Food is yummy. Their cheeseburger is really good. Their chicken shack was slightly over cooked but tasty nonetheless.  Would go here again to get a burger or fries fix. Enjoy."}
{"text":"We've had the opportunity of eating at several Shake Shack locations across New York and in Philadelphia, but this location in Vegas certainly stands out.

1. This location is much larger than any we've ever been to. The original Shack Shack in Flatiron is merely a stand in the middle of Madison Square Park. Meanwhile, the Vegas restaurant offers plenty of seating and a large TV that broadcasts ongoing sports games. 

2. The lines move quickly. 

3. Customer service is unmatched. After placing our order and seeing a customer heartily enjoying her double shack burger, I immediately regretted my decision of getting a single shack burger. We asked one of the staff members, Diana, if there was a remote possibility of upgrading our burger to a double patty. She went above and beyond by heading straight to the kitchen to change our orders at no cost to us - even though we insisted that we were willing to pay extra. After we received our burgers, she followed up with us to verify that our orders came out correctly. 

4. The food was consistent. The burgers, fries, and custard were on point, as usual. 

Vegas may have a number of burger joints (Holstein's, BurgGR, etc.) but Shake Shack is one of a kind."}
{"text":"We decided to go here and out of the way of the one that's on the strip at the NYNY. When arriving, we definitely liked that there was no crowd and it was dinner time. We were so excited to try Shake Shack because we've heard a lot of good things about it. But we quickly learned that this was just hype. 

I ordered a regular Hamburger with bacon. I order my burgers plain because I like to see just how the burger stands up with minimal toppings or condiments. I found that the burger was tasteless and rather dry. 

Wife ordered the Shack Burger and she also chimed in saying that it wasn't great at all.

I had to reach for some pepper to season my burger. With the pepper added, it was somewhat better. However, I was going to put some ketchup in but decided against it. The burger doesn't even look like a burger. It looks like slivered meat. 

Another thing to note about this location was that the rubbish cans were overflowing. Nobody cared to empty trash or to take the trays back in. It wasn't even crowded. 

I'll skip this next time. Over-hyped and the food isn't tasty at all. At least I can check this off my list of \"to try.\""}
{"text":"It's ok to indulge in the classic American \"burger, fries & shake\" trio every now again. And if you're gunna do it, then this is the place! 

You'll find lots of indoor AND outdoor seating here. First wait in a line to order, then pay, seat yourself, visit the condiment bar, and when your pager goes off, you go back up to find your metal tray of yumminess patiently waiting for you. 

Variety is the spice of life, and there is no shortage of options when it comes to your style of burger and type of fries. You can even order a beer on draft! Kid friendly, probably not Heart Dr approved."}
{"text":"The food is quite good here, but when you've been walking on the strip and your feet hurt, and its hot out, and you're hungry, the last thing you want to do is stand in a long winding line to order your food and then have to fight to find a table. 

This is definitely quality food in a fast food style setting. Thats why I dropped the fifth star. It would be nice if it was half sit down and order style for those who prefer it."}
{"text":"This is a good burger place, they have good fries and good variety of foods also. I did not try their shakes but plan to in the future, they are fast to get your order and have your food up faster than other places on the strip! I want to try other foods. Good fun place to eat with family and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Another home run   Sent some visitors in over the weekend. They loved it and now there is one in TOKYO!   Paul is a total gentleman and so is Karl. Met him tonight when we had to stop in for some concretes! What a great place."}
{"text":"My cousin, who is an East Coast native, was pumped when he heard that Shake Shack was coming to Scottsdale. So when it opened up, he took us to check it out.

I ordered the Shack Burger with fries and I wasn't pleased. They really skimped on tomatoes and lettuce and I couldn't tell what their Shack Sauce tasted like at all. Did they even put any sauce in my burger? I was disappointed with the flavor. The meat patty itself was fine, but everything else about the burger was underwhelming. The price was the final deal breaker for me.

Perhaps the Shack Burger was not the best thing on their menu, but for their signature name burger, it was rather disappointing. I read that some of their other burgers are better and that their shakes are really good, though, so if you try Shake Shack, take a pass on the Shack Burger and get something else."}
{"text":"Since this location has opened up.... it's prolly the closest one to me & I can get a quick pick me up for the best burgers in the east coast since in n out is hands down the best one on the west coast lol Depending on my mood I'll pick my burger... bacon, mushroom, onion rings.. etc.... but the main item I usually almost ALWAYS order is the double down fries (fully loaded) are a MUST try for everyone!!!! My always ordered item with my burger & shake. They have seasonal shakes so make sure u try which ever one is in season before they change it. Last time I got the grasshopper (mint chocolate) & the most recent time when I went last week it was coffee. & there shakes do not disappoint... so indulge & make sure u grab ur meal here. great spot for burgers!"}
{"text":"Nothing special except that they do offer a chicken sandwich. The fries are horrible right out of freezer. In and Out, Smash Burger and Five Guys are much better."}
{"text":"This place is not worth it at all.. I got the burgers here and they r so tiny i could eat ten of them..they remind me of mcdonalds cheeseburger.. And what gets me is that there is always a line? you kidding me? I much much rather have in n out burger. Better yet try Burgr or Holsteins. I give it 2 starts because even though the food sucked, the employees were nice"}
{"text":"Shake shack is kinda like Khloe Kardashian. Like shes attractive for sure, but she's just not like actually hot. No ones gonna pick her over Kim or Kendall let's be real. The shack burger is good but not great, and that goes for everything else there. But I would I come here again? Yeah sure why not."}
{"text":"The shock shake burger is delicious. Something about that sauce. I also had a refreshing cider and really good fries"}
{"text":"I'm normally a burger and fries girl.  I'm such a cheap date.

It was a beautiful Friday afternoon when we stopped by Shake Shack for lunch.  The line was long but it moved pretty fast.  I think we waited 10-15 minutes before we were up front and ordering a great meal.  We shared a SmokeShack, ShackBurger, shared some cheese fries, washed it all down with an Abita draft root beer, had a couple of bites of the Shack Cago Dog, and a spoonful or two of the CamelShack.  I really enjoyed my SmokeShack which had bacon, cherry peppers, and Shack sauce in it. It had a good char and it was juicy and flavorful. The peppers had a nice bite and I dumped any remnant peppers onto my cheese fries which were amazing. Crinkle cut fries with all their curves and all their edges, all their perfect imperfections, smothered in cheese sauce...Aw yis! *kisses fingertips*

In my opinion, the burgers are the perfect size.  It's certainly not a fork and knife kind of burger where you have to slice it in half just to eat it but it filled me up all day.  Being happy and full is what you pay for, right?  The ingredients were also of good quality so it justifies our $30 bill.  Yeowch!

In the mood for a sweet treat?  You can't forget dessert!  Get the CamelShack [vanilla custard with salted caramel and a slice of The Bakery Phx banana cream pie].  5% of sales for the CamelShack gets donated to the Phoenix Children's Hospital.

All in all, in my opinion, Shake Shack was worth the hype! I just wish it wasn't over the river and through the woods. Third AZ location in the east valley please!"}
{"text":"Did you know that Shake Shack broke into the scene by serving hot dogs?

I know, I know, we have Shake Shack back in Phoenix but Matt C. can't get it in his hometown so here we are!  I did get to try their Single PB Bacon Burger with pickles finally so I was equally excitedly. 

The Single PB Bacon Burger... This stuff right here is the business. So Gucci!  We're talking a perfectly seasoned burger patty with applewood smoked bacon and a side of peanut butter sauce.  I spread that PB on that bun thicc like Rihanna!  The warmth of the meat with the hot burger fat makes the PB sticky and gooey but it just adds to the appeal.  Toss on some cold crunchy pickles and it's perfection!  The cold pickles works well with the hot burger, the crunchiness adds more texture to the tender beef, and it gave it a different flavor element.  I know it sounds bad but it works, babie!  Now I get why pregnant women do this!  And to add to the indulgence, of course we had to get an order of the cheese fries.  We ended up taking back up to our room at Park MGM, forgetting about it, got drunk that night, and drunk-ate it.  They were still good even with the cheese being cold and all congealed and stuff.  *kisses fingertips*

So while I may not show Shake Shack enough love here in Phoenix, I will never hesitate coming to Shake Shack Las Vegas.  Platinum and Black card M-Life members gets to cut the line by the way.  The staff here are super friendly and the place is kept clean.  I like it!"}
{"text":"Great simple burger and fro-custard. Smoke Shack + concrete w/ straw. purée. 
Great and clean place. Cold water fountain + unlimited ketchup! Their table was made from used bowling alley's floor! Amazing experience! Plus they're dog friendly restaurant who sells doggie's treats, too! I will be back when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"When I'm in town, I like going to this location instead of the strip. It's cleaner, less crowded, and the staff just executives food and service very well. If you haven't been to shake shack, go!

Disclosure: I always get a rental when I'm visiting and crash at my cousin's place, so I wouldn't recommend taking a rideshare or cab from the strip."}
{"text":"Shake shake is never a disappointment! They have a great way to take orders and gets it done in a  quick manner! Do you want. A great burger and fries! Come on in!"}
{"text":"Five Guys need not worry! MickeyD's need not worry. At Shake Shack my overpriced hamburger at this place was so thin and small that the profit margin must be over 200%. I had to send the cheese fries back because the \"cheese\"  was like orange glue all over the fries. Yuk. I am not alone.....the table next to me people were eating food they had brought over from Panda Express."}
{"text":"As a California girl you'd think I'd love in n out burger right? Well, I don't. It's good once a year for me. When I went to NY last May I was told to try shake shack and I instantly fell in love, it's honestly all I ate. I just went to Vegas last weekend, and again this is all I ate. I could eat this everyday. The shack stack burger is my favorite thing on the menu with cheese fries & a shake. Yes, I eat all of that. But there's nothing on the menu I wouldn't eat! I tell everyone to try this place, it's too good not too! If they ever make one in California, I'm doomed, but I'll be so happy too"}
{"text":"I used to love shake shack but the quality has gone down. The past two times I've been there the buns were very soggy."}
{"text":"I moved from NYC to SLC and this is the closest Shake Shack location around. My boyfriend had never tried it so I dragged him here while we were in Vegas. My mouth waters thinking about their shroom burger. So good. It was a big hit! He got the classic shack burger and we both got fries. His were with cheese. 2 beers on the side. Wait was a lot shorter than NYC, still longer than normal fast food, but anyone that knows shake shack knows it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This is my second time trying Shake Shack (first time was in the NY Grand Central Station). My boyfriend and I wanted to try this place out again to see if In-N-Out is better, or if Shake Shack is better. We both ordered the Shack burger (BF added onions to his burger), and it took about 5-10 minutes for them to make it. It was about $11 for two burgers, which is pretty ridiculous compared to In-N-Out. 
The burger is pretty small in general, with a Hawaiian bun type, a nice piece of patty, lettuce, tomatoes, and shack sauce. I didn't really like the taste of the burger that much, other than the patty since the shack sauce had a strong mayo flavor and the bun was too mushy. I definitely like In-N-Out burgers better than Shake Shack, but my BF disagrees. He thought it was good since it tastes dirtier than In-N-Out, but overpriced for the size. 
I would try this place out if you have never tried it, but overall, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to try it again."}
{"text":"Not worth the trip to the strip.. I'm a New Yorker, this doesn't compare to the one in NYC. Oh FYI they don't serve the chicken sandwich here. Burger was messy and over priced for what it is .. In n out 10 times better n 10 times cheaper."}
{"text":"Delish.....the burger here exceeded my expectations. Given the analogy of this being new yorks version of what in and out is to california I had to give this a try. Having arrived here at noon there was a fairly long lone but it moved quickly. After our order was placed we didnt have to wait too long either. Standard cheese burger we ordered was juicy with a thin patty. Came with tomatoes, onion, pickles, their special sauce which was basically like a tangy thousand island without the relish  or aoili style,  not bad. The crinkle cut fries were very crispy and not bad for being crinkle cut fries. Also ordered a root beer milkshake made from their custard which had good consistency and flavor.

Will def be back and would go to the one in Ny when/if i ever go there."}
{"text":"Im from California and I was super stoked to try this place.  

The burger is inferior to in-n-out. The fries are much better than in-n-out. Especially the cheese fries.

I will definitely come back to try other menu items, but if i want a tasty burger ill stick with In-n-out."}
{"text":"What do you do when your first choice decides to close 15 minutes early?  You discover Shake Shack.  Good service, friendly smile and made to order food in a reasonable time frame.  Burgers were delicious, fries tasty and they have a customer now.  If you are looking for a burger that doesn't feel like it came off an assembly line and a nice place to enjoy it give the team at Shake Shack a whirl."}
{"text":"We love love LOVE to take our two dogs to this location after a long morning playing at the dog park. This is one of the most dog friendly casual restaurants in central Phoenix we have found. We always get our boys poochinis (vanilla custard with peanut butter sauce and Bocce's special burger flavored biscuits), and it's their favorite treat ever!

Additionally, all of the staff is super friendly! They always bring out a bowl of water for our boys. One time, one of the girls working even brought out my order to me when I was there alone with my dogs. It's hard to find a place we can bring our dogs to, and even harder to find one that's good and we can take the boys to. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Review of chicken, not a burger:
Too greasy. I was starving and didn't bother finishing it. It was very bland, and disappointing. The fries were good. I probably won't come back, there wasn't anything that wowed me."}
{"text":"Awww man it's Shake Shack!!!!! - my new answer to \"Where you wanna go to lunch?\"

I've had a lengthy relationship with burgers and shakes, as my 2XL tee size will tell you. Throughout the years, my favorites have ranged from Wendy's in grade school, to Jerry's, the local counter near my church in middle school, to In N Out for high school and college, then reluctantly to Five Guys when I moved to the East Coast. Now, even back in the West, I think Shake Shack has the crown. (No offense, In N Out - I still do the pilgrimage to the crossed palms a few times a year)

But Shake Shack's combo of stellar burgers combined with still stellar, yet delicious options beyond burgers, bring them to #1!
The bacon cheese fries, the portobello mushroom patty, the peppers, the floats and shakes, the seasonal lemonade, all bring it! The burgers are the standout, as it should be, right up there with a Double Double animal style, but everything else beats In N Outs fries by a mile. 

It's a Boy Dance Party - Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"I got the salted caramel pretzel shake which was amazing. A single burger with everything was also a wonderful tasting burger for the price. I was not a fan of the vegan Portabella mushroom burger. Beware of the hot cheese that oozes out of the mushroom when you first bite into it."}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever eaten!!! I got a double cheeseburger with onion and pickle. The meat was absolutely cooked to perfection and juicy and full of flavor. I also had the crinkle cut cheese fries. Fries were crispy and delish, I didn't really care too much for the cheese sauce , but I did eat it. Shake Shack blows In and Out Burger away ! My only complaint is the line to wait to order was wrapped outside and in. We waited atleast 30 minutes to order and another 15 for the order to come up. Seating is limited and it is not a guarantee you will find one inside or outside."}
{"text":"Ohhhhhhh shake shack! How so many people love you. 

I must say I went back as I was craving their greasy shack burger. If only it was 1/4 bigger in size and came with fries and a drink, I would think it's so worth it for $9. 

I enjoyed the shack burger, but their price point still really bothers me as I see them as a fastfood chain, and not a sit-down restaurant. The crinkle fries are whatever in my opinion. 

The smoke shack (that comes with bacon and some spice) is good. It was overly salty for my taste buds,and I'd stick to the regular shack burger if I were to return. Maybe if it was someone's treat I'd continue to come back, but I still feel the same way about giving my business to In n Out when the quality is equal to me and price point is way more awesome at the other. Plus, you can't beat fresh fries."}
{"text":"I had super low expectations due to my first attempt. I went for their basic cheeseburger. It was surprisingly good. The fries were crispy and decent as well. Just those two items cost $8 or so. I think it's a bit overpriced for what it is. The burger was almost half the size of a regular burger. Maybe they smushed it by accident? I still give them a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"I have heard of the Shake Shack once or twice before but didn't really know anything about it. I have heard people compare it to In N Out Burger, and some say it's better, some say it's not (more on this to come). But the best descriptor I heard from a friend is that \"the burger literally melts in your mouth.\" What I can say about that is, it's totally accurate.

I must be honest, when we arrived just before catching a flight home, I was not too happy about the long line. In fact, every time I saw the line, it was long. But the line is long for a reason. I also must admit, I did not wait in line (my wife did) because I had to run across the street to the M&M store for the kids. Therfore, I cannot comment on the friendliness of the staff or the ordering process. What I do know is that upon my return, I was greeted with a mouthwatering burger and tasty fries. And it really did seem to melt in my mouth. So while it compares to the gloriousness of the best burger joint invented (In N Out, for all you non Californians) it was definitely close. It is slightly more expensive than In N Out, which is one of the amazing attributes of the best burger joint. I don't have a Shake Shack near home, so I'll definitely make this a regular stop when I'm in Vegas, or anywhere else I can find one. You should too.

The only negative I can report, which is no fault of the restaurant, but getting dropped off or picked up by Uber or a taxi is impossible without walking a few blocks because of the street laws here in Vegas. So while it took some significant effort to get here and leave every time, it was well worth the trouble."}
{"text":"My husband and I split a burger but after getting we were disappointed by the small size but it was tasty. My husband tried their beer and thought it was really good. The concrete with peanut butter and dark chocolate chunks was small but really good too. All in all it is pricey for what you get but I would definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Had single cheeseburger fries and drink. The burger was fantastic great flavor cooked medium not dried out by any means    fresh crisp lettuce and sauce. Fries fresh crispy great taste. All in all a great meal for the price, highly recommend a try if you haven't tried them yet."}
{"text":"The Shake Shack is a little old place where... weeeee cannnn get togetherrrrrr... Shake Shack Bay-ayy-byyy (The Shake Shack Baby!) 

If you see a green and white sign at the end of the road, you're less than fifteen seconds from the Shake Shack, baby! We were headin' down Park Avenue, looking for the burger... getaway... headed for the burger getaway!

So I see you've probably got the point. Shake Shack gets me excited enough to attempt a terrible B-52's rendition. You KNOW these burgers got in my head. Burgershake Delirium 2018. Keep me in your prayers, peeps!

I'd never had Shake Shack so of course I was all about the opportunity on opening day, where I will say they handed out some pretty stellar coozies and Shake Shack sunglasses - summer staple, ya'll! The line seemed pretty rough and it was a bit hot, but I cannot stress enough how absolutely worth it is to wait for a while. Just maybe pack some almonds so you don't start gnawing your neighbor's arm off. The smell that kept passing by me was enough torment for a lifetime... but when it was finally my turn to sink my teeth into my burger... all was forgiven.

I went with the standard Shackburger. It had some tasty Shack sauce. The cheese was melted ever so perfectly on my juicy burger... I honestly NEARLY inhaled this thing. The fries were golden brown and had the absolute best texture which SURPRISED me because honestly I'm not a crinkle cut girl. These were far too legit to quit. I ate every single one. I dipped some in an extravagant cheese sauce, which was truly the best balance of rich and creamy without being overkill. Others I enjoyed the simple pleasures of ketchup, which was classic and delish!

I tried a sip of my friend's shake and it was definitely nothing to scoff at! Man! This place being around may be a blessing and a curse to all of Beachwood man and womankind. I can feel the cravings coming...

Bang bang, on the door baby, bang bang! Shake Shack, baby Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place after a million referrals and have to say I wasn't disappointed.  I will admit that In & Out still has the best burgers ever, but shake shack isn't too far behind.  They have their own taste to their burgers which is great.  Buns were soft and burger was cooked perfectly.  Fries were good and shake was delicious in the 110 degree heat.  Price was a little too much though.  $40 for 2 burgers, 2 shakes and 2 fries.  In and out that's half the price maybe less.  Not sure if that's Vegas pricing though.  But still would come back since I don't think there aren't any burgers this good on the strip."}
{"text":"Everyone told me that this place rivaled our infamous In n Out burger... so I went. I was told to order the shack stack. It contains a portabella mushroom stuffed with melting cheese, inside a cheese burger. It definitely tickled my fancy. I got in line and took a look at the menu and noticed that there were no combos. You had to order everything a la carte. What the hell kind of burger place is this?!?! The burger costs about $10, the fries were about $3, and the drink was about $3. My total came out close to about $20. Strike 1 for Shake Shack. 

I received my food, and the party I was with, all said the same thing... \"this is a small ass burger for 10 bucks.\" It really was. And it was really greasy as well. Strike 2. 

I began to masticate my burger and nothing really hit me as... WOW. This was my first shake shack experience, and there was no emotions that stirred within me, unlike my first In n Out burger. Strike 3. 

I didn't order any of the shakes there because I'm lactose intolerant, but a few of my friends did, and no one raved about them. The only thing they mentioned was that the cups were freaking tiny for what they paid. 

Overall, it's overpriced, no combos, small portions, no wow factor, means I wouldn't go back. In N Out definitely wins out in every way."}
{"text":"File this under the \"not sure what the fuss is about\" file. I have heard such glowing things about this place I couldn't wait to try it. Damn was I bummed out. The burger was tiny! I couldn't believe how small it was for the price. Definitely not worth it. 

It's ok...the fries could redeem the meal...nope! They seriously taste like frozen Ore Ida French fries you would buy at the supermarket. Again for the price of the fries I expected a much bigger serving. 

Lastly, they dont trust you to get your own drink refills so you're forced to bother one of the workers everytime you need a refill. Just put a drink station in your dining room! It will save your employees time from refilling drinks all the time.

I got a double burger, fries and a drink for 14 dollars. It's just as expensive as five guys but nowhere near as good. If your looking for lots of different toppings...you will be disappointed. I was still hungry after paying 14 dollars because the portions were so small. :("}
{"text":"I was told if you goto Vegas  you need to try the Shake Shack.  I was here with my daughters for a basketball tournament and this seemed like the perfect time and group to take.  It was cool and clean and the service was top notch.  The hamburgers were tasty and the fries were delicious.  We will definitely be coming back on our next visit."}
{"text":"Finally we got over to Shake Shack to try its ballyhooed burgers and somewhat novel flat-top dogs.  Food and service met all expectations.  A busser even took my tray as I was getting up to toss it.  Only the men's restroom needed attention, with piled up paper towels making it a mess.

Although the order taker said it would be substantially pink, the beef patty of a ShackBurger ordered \"medium\" was just starting to show pink.  But, festooned within a nice chewy bun with fresh tomato slices, ragged but fine lettuce, Applewood smoked bacon, very tasty pickle chips, and a great orange-colored lubricant known as ShackSauce, the burger was juicy and delicious.  I quickly determined that with a sauce resembling Jack's secret sauce, no mustard was needed.    

A Shack-cago Dog was a little unorthodox being grilled spread-eagle after the all-beef wiener was nearly severed lengthwise in two.  But the grilled meat's juices flowed out and helped make this dog very tasty.  And, when bit into, about the correct amount of zip spurted into the mouth from the included Sport Pickle.  Other than the unconventional treatment of the hot dog itself, and relish that was green but not emerald green, this looked and tasted like a classic and very good Chicago Dog.

Crinkle Cut French Fries and Cheese Fries were springy, flavorful, and satisfying.  And a regular Chocolate Shake was small, but Diane reported that, being rich and chocolately, it was quite ample enough.  We will definitely be back to this very tasty burger and dog joint to enjoy more of the same."}
{"text":"As far as fast foodish burgers go, shake shack and inn n out are the top of my list and for the first time they are in the same town.  Unfortunately InNOut does not have an outlet on the strip, and since I don't have a car while visiting Las Vegas, I have been stopping into ShakeShack and have not been disappointed, the burgers have been spot on.  I have noticed at lunch time and early to mid afternoon there has been a line there but not much of a line at all at dinner time."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place!  The reviews were good, and the lines long, but ...

Some staff is friendly, and the food is OK, but we had so many problems there I cannot recommend it.  We ordered fairly quickly, but the person at the counter got two items wrong.  Going to the pick-up counter proved very difficult to correct the order as they ignore you trying to get their attention unless you are rude.

The food was good, but since I didn't get what I wanted I can't tell how good.  Didn't go back again.  I'll give it a second chance on my next trip and will update review then."}
{"text":"One of the busiest and crowded place to be at night! Especially when it's so cold at night, and there are people walking and needing to stop in for warm up. It's quite known for their burgers and shakes obviously but I was so cold that night I didn't want anything. I did enjoy people watching out the windows thou. Lots of hype for this place and you have some people dancing while dining. Pretty interesting experiments. After all, it's Vegas!"}
{"text":"had a shake stack in NY, this place does not compare.  the burger was dry and tasteless....the shake was alright.  i was so disapointed because i love the one in NY.  glad the frozen custard tasted ok."}
{"text":"If this is the East Coast competition to West Coast's In-N-Out, then I'm proud to say the West Coast won this one. Located on the outskirts of the New York New York Casino, this brightly lit place is definitely a tourist trap for those of us unfamiliar with the Shake Shack franchise. The menu is pretty basic with burgers, fries, hot dogs, and shakes. I opted for the basic cheeseburger with fries and I was super disappointed. The burger was smaller than a McDonald's dollar burger and was not very well seasoned. As for the fries, they were definitely those frozen crinkle fries, which again were super basic. I was so let down with my entire meal after everyone who had eaten at Shake Shack on the East Coast claimed it was on the same level as In-N-Out. Overall, if you're looking for a delicious burger experience and have a car, you might as well save a couple bucks and go to the In-N-Out down the street from the Strip."}
{"text":"Good.. BUT.... IN-N-OUT greater than Shake Shack

So I've been hearing about the In-N-Out vs. Shake Shack for a while now, and now that I've tried both I can finally chime in. In-N-Out by TKO!!!

In-N-Out has better everything except milkshakes (which I don't order at In-N-Out anyways). Shake Shack's food is still good. Don't get me wrong. I'd definitely come back to SS and totally grub out.

Both yummy!"}
{"text":"Don't get it but not from back east?! Expensive for what it is and really not worth all the noise. Prefer in-n-put + no pkg issue + no need to get outta ya car."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries, but a bit expensive for portion sizes. No kid's meals and everything is seperately purchased. The food was delicious, meat tasted fresh and fantastic! Will be back, but really wish they'd consider kid's options."}
{"text":"For whatever reason the Shake Shack on the LV strip tastes, smells, and even looks better than this one in Summerlin. We ordered several of the Shake Shack burgers and most were served with soggy buns. Not sure what happened, but the burgers here felt and looked considerably smaller than the ones served on the strip. Taste wise, the meat tasted just like the other one. The crinkle fries were crispy and served warm. The Shake Shack Ale was a bit warm and not very hoppy. The restaurant wasn't very clean with food remnants and trash scattered throughout the floor. Because this location is anchored to an outdoor mall, the vibe I got was that of an outlet food court. Too bad and no thanks."}
{"text":"Is it better than In-N-Out? In some areas, the answer is yes, while other areas, definitely not. First of all, everything at Shake Shack costs more than In-N-Out. Maybe it's comparing apples and oranges? 

I tried the Shack Burger, Cheese Fries, and Chocolate Shake. Everything was really good. I'll start with the burger. Meat quality I think is better than In-N-Out, but it lacks sauce (unlike that infamous spread at In-N-Out). I actually added some mustard to bring out some of that meat flavor. Moving onto the cheese fries. Yes, very good especially with that cheese drizzled on top. Can't go wrong, especially if you like the crinkle-style fries. Having said that, the In-N-Out fries are thinner and you can taste the freshness. Again, hard to compare? The shakes at Shake Shack definitely beats the shakes at In-N-Out. First of all, you can actually drink the shakes from the get-go versus having to wait  for some defrost action with the shakes at In-N-Out. My chocolate shake was not overly sweet and cold enough to make a decadent dessert drink. All in all, solid All American burger shop right on the LV strip. Plus, they have decent selection of draft beers. Must try Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger & fries with the family. got the bacon cheddar burger and cheese fries they were delicious! Couldn't resist a shake & the custard special blueberry pie oh my! And that was really good! I wanted the chicken shack which they no longer had any(we came in about 30 mins to closing) so a little disappointed but the staff was really nice about it. All the staff we encountered were super friendly! We will go back and hopefully get to try the chicken shack!"}
{"text":"Im not much of a burger person, but the burgers here are delicious, the fries are crispy and the shakes are perfect. Staff at this location are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Very greasy and disappointed. Eaten at Shake Shake in France and remember something quite different.  Over priced and under quality. Will not go back"}
{"text":"This is what a quality hamburger should taste. The Angus beef was so tasty. The deep fried Portobello was a surprise twist in the shack stack. Fries were perfectly cooked. Ever had something so delicious that you still think about it the next day? Yup this is the place."}
{"text":"Great food and extremely friendly staff! I had the shack burger and my husband had the smoke shack burger. OMG we'll be buying seconds, thirds, fourths, and so on! The bun is not cut all the way through so that the burger doesn't fall apart. The bun, meat, and secret sauce combination is amazing. The bun is not any regular hamburger bun either. I don't know what it is but it complimented the burger so well! We also had the cheese fries and a chocolate shake. Both were amazing too!. THIS PLACE IS A MUST VISIT!"}
{"text":"If you come here Ron is definitely who you wants as your cashier he goes over and beyond with a friendly face and smile. He acknowledged my name and help me by putting ketchup and mustard in containers. Even though it's self serve he politely showed me where everything was. He mentioned about ordering from the app and how it's faster if your in a rush. He's definitely a model employee and we need more Ron's in the service industry. Thanks Ron"}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are just right in size and flavor i prefer shake shack over in and out burger"}
{"text":"If there is a line the wait is worth it. We spent $200 a person down the street and wished we just went to shake shack so we went back at 2:00 am."}
{"text":"Fantastic first visit!
Quick fun service at the register, a succinct and easy to choose from menu. 
Food is wonderful with a creative edge. Relaxed atmosphere. 
Great place!!"}
{"text":"Hands down impressed. The flavorful, juicy shack burger was fresh and unforgettable because we just don't have anything like it in San Diego.  We also enjoyed the mango lemonade, cheese fries and concrete with the strawberries and waffle. Food took awhile though... Blame it on the Vegas factor!"}
{"text":"Shake Shack is always super busy in Las Vegas. Definitely a tourist trap located in New York New York. We parked in the structure and it's free for the first 60 minutes. It's crazy hectic and loud in here and it can be hard to find a seat.

I'm from Cali so I'm definitely going to compare this to the In N Out burger, which I love! The shack burger is pretty good, but I actually liked the crispy mushroom burger better because it's unique. I really like the crinkle cut fries and you can tell everything is cooked fresh. I do think the employees here can be friendlier, but I guess their jobs are hard and stressful so I can be understanding of that. In N Out wins in my book because it's cheaper and burgers taste better to me. This place is good, but overhyped and not worth dealing with the large crowds."}
{"text":"Not bad. The shakes and fries, meh. The burger and bun were obviously fresh and quality. Personally, bang for the buck, and personal taste, I like I&O better. If I'm paying over 5 bucks for a burger, there are many better alternatives in Houston and likely here in Vegas. Jax, Hubcap...to name a couple."}
{"text":"I LOVE SHAKE SHACK SO MUCH.

It's been a really long time since I've eaten at In-N-Out in Las Vegas because I would always rather eat a burger at Shake Shack. The first time I ever ate here, I tried the SmokeShack, which is basically a bacon cheeseburger. It was sooo good! However, every other time that I've been here, I always order the 'Shroom Burger and I can't get enough of it. Instead of a hamburger patty, they use a fried portobello mushroom that is filled with cheese. I don't know why, but it hits the spot every single time. The fries have the perfect amount of crunch and are really good whether or not they are topped with cheese. Another great thing is that there is a \"no bun\" option for the health-conscious people who want to indulge in a burger, but want to skip the carbs. Last, but not least, get a shake! They are delicious and perfect during the summer when its extremely hot outside. I've tried the strawberry, coffee and cookies & cream shakes and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"I can't believe how far I walked to try this place, due to the hype.  Don't believe the hype.  I had very average food at ridiculous prices.  Better burgers can be found many other places.  They were very ordinary and nothing special.  Niether were the fries.  The vanilla shake was OK."}
{"text":"Spacious area, lot's of seating, fast ordering, and another great quick and easy bite on the strip!  Haven't tried too much of the burgers here, but their crinkle fries were perfect, and their chicken sandwich is one of the best I've had.  It is very generously battered, super crunchy, and a great basic sandwich.  I really enjoy how the lines aren't too chaotic, and that there is plenty of seating available (no need to battle it out too hard)."}
{"text":"YEEEESSSSS!!!!!!!!!!! Finally i dont have to fly to New York to have the best East coast burger on the west side. Shake shack man its been 5 years since ive had this place but man one bite and BAM flavor town flash back. This spot is head to head east coast vs west coast in n out many can debate and say but im west coast and this burger is up there; is it better than in n out not gonna say but its def can rival it. Why do i like shake shack, well for starters they have a more flavorful bun, their meat pattys are bigger and more flavorful and all that cheese. Something about this burger also is less greasy than some other places but this is what an all american burger should taste like. Now the fires MmmmMmmm a little crispy nice and add the cheese oh my goodness!! All i can say is im a fan i was a fan when i had it in NY and glad its out here on the west side; sorry in n out but ill be going here more often"}
{"text":"This is the casino of fast food.  You go in knowing the house is going to rip you off, but the novelty of this joint is what makes going at least once mandatory.

My wife and I went to an early movie and for the first time there was no line at around 9:30 on a Friday night.  I ordered a double shack burger and an order of fries, while the Misses had a single with a strawberry shake.  Total bill was $23 for four items.  The burger was tasty, but come on, $8 for a double burger ought to include the fries.  The wife's shake appeared to be about 12 fluid ounces.

For slightly less money, you can go around the corner and visit Smashburger which the food is about the same quality, or you could go over to Zack's Hamburgers and get a Zack Special for about half the price of The Shack.  As a matter of fact when we were watching the movie \"American Animals\" I told the wife that one scene looked like Zack's, and found out later that the movie was filmed in Charlotte and that was Zack's Hamburgers.  They don't make movies at bland establishments like Shake Shack, but they do at Zack's where you can go for the ambiance but stay for the food!"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed lunch here. He had the mushroom Burger and I had the cheeseburger both were good. I got a chocolate oreo shake and he had the strawberry shake both were good. We shared some cheese fries, which were really good. Our meal was like $30 for the two of us. Overall I would come back."}
{"text":"You couldn't pay me $30.00 to eat here again...which is how much it costs for the following: bland not special fries (also cold); I could make a better milkshake at home in my vitamix (which we're assuming I own for the purposes of this review); burger might be good without that disgusting wonderbread bun; chicken sandwich decent. #dissapointed"}
{"text":"Came here on the day of Christmas and boy was it packed! We ended up sitting outside, luckily it wasn't that cold for us. Ordered the chicken sandwich (chick n shack) and it was delicious! Finished it so quickly, I didn't realize it was gone and I wanted more! Their cheese fries was so yummy! It was soft from the cheese and the cheese was so cheesy I wanted more cheese. I wish the portion was bigger but I loved this place! Can't wait to go back. Hoping they expand more - hopefully the bay area!"}
{"text":"Shake Shake was next to our hotel. 
We ventured out to find a spot to eat with our hungry boys. Yelped our some contenders and Shake shack was one. Walked in - menu is on the wall and you order before you seat, right as you walk in. 
The burgers were amazing. Everyone raved on how juicy and tasty they were. We loved how fresh the buns were to. Nephew ordered the black and white shake and our son had the reboot beer float, both were thick and very good. I think my fried chicken sandwich was the best!!!"}
{"text":"Shake shack has it all -great burgers, crinkle fries, root beer on tap, custards of the week, beer, and so much more. With outdoor patio and lots of indoor seating to enjoy you delicious meal"}
{"text":"I really liked the food here! The line was long as hell, but it dwindled in size fast:) The place was clean and the cheese fries, burgers & shakes were all really yummy. My family and I didn't care for the bacon and cheese fries, though, as we felt the bacon over powered the taste of the cheese and fries."}
{"text":"I've never spent so much on fast food before...over $70! The food is really good, though (except for the mushroom in my burger...which was too chewy:/) and my kids really loved it. I also really like this location because it has the shortest lines out of any location."}
{"text":"No one wants me to compare Shake Shack to In-N-Out but....I couldn't help it :(

Shake Shack burgers were really adorable and small and squishable. Visually very pleasing and clean, with bright yellow American cheese, dark green lettuce instead of icebergs, contrasting red tomatoes, and juicy thick patty instead of an extremely pounded-thin one. However, the Shake Shack burger really doesn't hold well - I feel like after a few bites into it, everything just melts with the squishy bun. The cheese is gooey - the gooeyness is great with the crisp crinkle fries, but in the burger, it sogs up the thin single leaf of lettuce that is inside. So at the end of it, I did not feel great haha. Maybe a Coke or a beer could help wash away the heaviness. 

But the service is great, the interior here is very clean and in a great location. I still prefer In-n-Out because of the fresh onions and chili peppers and thicker leaves of lettuce that make me feel less heavy than Shake Shack, but I'd probably still go to Shake Shack for the gooey cheese fries haha."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good environment, dont think any other place has better burgers and specially shakes in town!
10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Those buns though.

Seriously, the buns at Shake Shack are soft tender carb clouds. Every time I order a simple burger and try to be good by not eating the bun, I cannot. I have to eat it. It's an addiction.

The set-up at Shake Shack is always the same. A large menu greets you like the all powerful Oz, you order at the counter, grab a buzzer, and wait for your order. The service is friendly (usually) and the food is consistent. 

I love this place."}
{"text":"OMG HELL YES! 

SHACK STACK!! 
- portobello stuffed with meunster/cheddar cheese deep fried - ooeey gooey and so juicy!  it the cheese and juice spilled over onto the burger as i bit into this piece of heart attack heaven!  at the same time as biting into this shroomy goodness, the beef patty is also releasing delicious juices and the burger was pure bliss and was devoured in less than 10 minutes.  it was SO GOOD.

chocolate frozen custard
- SO SO rich and deep in chocolate flavor and smoother than butter! no lie.  TOTALLY worth it! 

Coffee Shake
- MMMMMM....can't go wrong with vanilla and coffee, thats for sure!

was it more expensive than in-n-out?  yes.  was it better than in-n-out?  eehhhh, not necessarily, they are both great in their own respects, i would actually prefer to eat 4 in-n-out burgers for the price of the one burger at shake shack, BUT that does not mean that you shouldn't try this place!  it's deliciously different!"}
{"text":"Prior to cooking, the 4oz. of single patty was not going to fill me up.  Contemplating about the steeper prices, I opted to try the single cheese burger for taste first for $5.55.  My husband went all in and got the double Smoke shack with bacon and cherry pepper adding a tad more flavor to the burger $9.79.

The layout of the place accommodates the Vegas crowd nicely and boy do they whip through that line like nobody's business with tight buzzer control and have your food out in minutes after ordering.  Plenty of outdoor and indoor seating, it's fast food, but I enjoyed their decor.  Customer service at the counter can be more friendly or offering more suggestions.

Now, let's get down to the burger and fries.  My crinkle fries definitely needed to be well done, because the normally cooked ones didn't cut it for me.  Not my bag of potatoes and yes shapes do matter.  I don't mind them, they're just not mind blowing.  The plain buns, similar and tiny to In N Out is smothered in the Shack sauce, topped with their burger, a nice leafy lettuce, and two slices of tomato.  Slight difference in their sauce, but signature even to rave about?  This is all subjective.

I got a tiny sample of the chocolate shake, and it was a little too sweet for my taste.  Coming back for more?  Definitely won't be my first choice.  We're on a mission to try all the burger joints and see how they stack up to my all time favorite.

TMI- A little burp about an hour later got me feeling like the burger was too greasy for my taste.  Not a good feeling either."}
{"text":"One of the best fast casual burgers I have had. My husband and I were visiting in Las Vegas and I've long heard the debate of In-N-Out is better than Shake Shack or vice versa. We decided to test it out our selves. 

I honestly don't think there is a true comparison between Shake Shack and In-N_out, because Shake Shack is about double the price for a standard burger, yes Shack Shake tastes better (perfectly seasoned patty, crisp lettuce, yummy bun), but because In-N-Out is a drive through and cheaper, I would expect a little less from them."}
{"text":"I will take a Wendy's single over this.  I think the original shake shake was probably great - but the chain format is just another ok burger in a crowded burger market.  I ordered the double, it was good, but the bun was soggy because the service was horrible and I saw my burger sit for 3-5 minutes before it got to me."}
{"text":"The best burger I've had! Love the Shack Stack! Have been dreaming about this burger ever since. We also ordered cheese fries. Excellent. Not huge portions, but probably appropriate portions. Lol

Most of all, their service is A+++++++. Since it was our first time there, the cashier was very patient with my husband, who always needs to know what ALL his options are. So as I'm rolling my eyes, the sweetheart cashier is patiently going over all the beer selections, etc.

There is so much poor service out there that when service employees know how to perform their job excellently, it is sooooo appreciated. Thanks for a great outing with the hubby. Thoroughly enjoyed it"}
{"text":"First time at Shake Shack and WOW. The burger was delicious. I'm a sucker for crinkle cut fries. I didn't really enjoy the cheese sauce tho. The vanilla shake was tasty. I'm gonna miss this burger when I get back home."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying.. it's not better than In n Out ! Pretty good . Pickled peppers didn't really go with the smoke shake burger. Bacon was stringy.. no crisp.. just kind of soggy after a minute. Fries were ok taste like frozen bag fries and kind of greasy. On a good note their lemonade was really good !"}
{"text":"Delicious shroom burger!!! Must order Black&White shake. Waiting time was a little longer than I thought it would be, but it was worth. One of my must eats in Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious. Juicy. I got mine lettuce wrapped and it was good too. 
Simple menu.
Good efficient service. 
Nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"I was expecting great things from this place after reading the reviews but I was disappointed.  I got the shack burger with cheese fries, both were just ok.   Just under $10 bucks for a single burger and fries in this case was not worth it. Great location, busy place and I'm sure it will do great but i think I would rather catch a cab to im and out rather than eat here."}
{"text":"This place is the go to place when you are starving and walking around Vegas.
If you're lucky the wait is only 20-30 mins. My group and I just arrived to Vegas and was wandering around looking for food. It was pretty close to closing time so there wasn't much of a line. 

They have a pretty extensive menu. Everything sounded so good. If I had the money and stomach, I'd order everything on the menu. I got the single shakeshack burger (a cheese burger with lettuce, tomato, and shakeshack sauce). I also got the cheese fries. My friends all got cheese burgers and got the double and fries. 

The food took about 10 minutes. This place reminded me of a higher end In n out. The cheese burger was delicious. The cheese fries were good but the cheese was in a separate container (seemed like nacho cheese on the side). Price of the food was a a bit expensive but the quality of the food outweighed that. The atmosphere was great! Would definitely come back for the burgers but would stick to the crinkle-cut fries!"}
{"text":"Good burgers and fairly fast service given the long lines. Ordered the cheeseburger and cheese fries and they didn't disappoint. Customer service is great as well. Staff is attentive and asks how your food/ experience is going."}
{"text":"After reading about their secret menu, I was game for the peanut butter bacon burger.
Trust me on this, you gotta try it! 
Delicious. I had mine with cheese and that was a great decision. I also got a generous serving of bacon after some confusion about getting my order right. The peanut butter is served on the side and it's more of a sauce but just like regular peanut butter! No lettuce, tomato, etc. just lots of yummy bacon, peanut butter and cheese good!ness. 

I also had the black & white milkshake which was pretty tasty but not that great for almost $6. 
I've read many reviews calling the Shack fast food. I'm not sold on it being fast food, maybe it's fast casual- a step up from traditional fast food places. The prices certainly aren't fast food prices and the quality is better."}
{"text":"For some reason when I look at the pictures of burgers from Shake Shack, they look so amazingly dry, but lemme tell you, THEY'RE NOT. It's actually really soft and loving on your taste buds lol. 
I got a Smoke Shack for of course: BACON, but I'm sure you can customize the burgers to whatever you can imagine. However, it's Vegas and you're still drunk from day club at 8 PM and you cannot process any self thought-out combinations.
The fries are pretty good considering they stayed crunchy, but THOSE are kind of dry.
Someone recommended my friend like peanut butter sauce or something?? I highly do not recommend it - it's like... melted peanut butter and that's just weird on a burger.
I'm probably going to have to try everything on their menu. I heard there is a lot of cheese involved."}
{"text":"Super good! Definitely worth the price.
Awesome shakes, cheese fries, and juicy hamburgers."}
{"text":"First and last time going to this location. First, it'd like to know something - Is it an inconvenience to order from the app? Because the workers basically look at you like you're scum. 3 separate workers gave bad customer service. I had received a notification to go up to the counter - I'm not trying to rush the workers in any way and just kind of stood there, everyone who passed me went out of their way to not look at me and when I did meet their eyes, gave me unwelcoming looks. The large man with the large beard in the kitchen gave me a very rude look and it stopped me in my tracks. I'm not sure where I went wrong in order to get such an unwelcoming vibe. Maybe the man was upset because it was late in the night but hey, the app let me order and there was still 1:15 left until they closed. The girl who gave me my burger asked \"are you the one with the mobile order\" again with a sour look. I said yes thank you I appreciate it and took it. I was the only person around in the entire time and the all of workers seemed to be dreading the thought of dealing with customers. What horrible service I experienced in those 10 minutes. The place was empty and still, my order late. And not to mention that my burger was burnt!... all I could taste was char. The entire experience was very disheartening and made a tough day even worse. I still love Shakeshack but I sure hope my next visit to the other locations will make up for this terrible experience."}
{"text":"I never knew there could be anything better than In n' Out, until I tried this place. By far, it's the best fast food burger place I've ever had in my entire life. I've always wanted to try the restaurant place after hearing raving reviews about it in New York, but I hadn't been to New York for over 5 years and I was afraid I would never get to try NY's favorite burger spot ( comparable to In n' Out in CA ). They also serve beer and all kinds of milkshakes. My boyfriend and I came here with a hangover after partying in Vegas .After eating, we felt so much better but maybe it's because we hadn't eaten in over 17 hours. The burgers were so juicy and delicious. I was whatever about the fries ( because all fried potatoes generally taste the same  to me ). I had the Shack Stack Burger ( I think that's what they call it ). It's basically a burger with a fried portabella mushroom in it that has cheese inside the mushroom as well. Food was messier than I expected but they had plenty of napkins so I didn't complain. I forgot what the other burger my boyfriend had was called , but it was the one with bacon. Both were really good. Price is reasonable and fills you up pretty nicely. I want to say that besides Earl's, this place is my favorite go to in Vegas for affordable food."}
{"text":"After hearing about it we decided to give it a try a few weeks back. The food had no flavor an very bland.  Two adults a child and it was over 40.00. Basically don't waist your time and money."}
{"text":"I'm from the west coast where it's all about In N Out Burger so I was dying to try the east coast's best burger joint. We might be the best coast, but they definitely got us beat on this one!

I got the Smokeshack burger with a side of cheese fries. Everything about the burger straight down to their signature sauce was so delicious! The burger was juicy and buns were nice and crisp. I'm not a fan of wavy fries, but this definitely changed my mind! Everything was so much more flavorful than In N Out. 

So glad I gave this place a try and I'll definitely be back when I can!"}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place in New York but haven't had the chance so when I was in Vegas, I had to go. I went on a Monday and there were no lines or any issues finding a place to sit. Everything was really good. I wouldn't say it's the best of any of the things I tried, but it was really good. Plus it wasn't crazy expensive which is nice in Vegas. It was a good meal for a good price."}
{"text":"No no no no no. I try not to have expectations as not all experiences are the same; however, I will not be going back. I'm not going to get on here and bitch about the pricing, because of the \"quality\" of the meats (grass fed, veg diets, cage free etc) and because, I thought it was worth paying for. I was wrong. The burger was greasy the bun was literally drenched in it and started falling apart. Vegetables were fresh though. The fries reminded me of elementary school style free lunch and were less than desirable. Super disappointed with my meal, and to follow I had stomach cramps before I even finished half of my meal. I'm assuming again, that it's the grease. I'd report more about the atmosphere, service and furniture but really, the crappy food is enough and the reason why we review these restaurants. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I can't say that I've ever tried the original Shake Shack in NY, but I guess going to NYNY is kinda close enough, right?

We are all creatures of habit, and I grew up eating an In'n'Out double double with grilled onions, so that will always be my \"gold standard\", but Shake Shack definitely puts up a good fight. I got the Smokeshack burger, and it was good. The patty was meaty with good flavor, not overly greasy, but I didn't care much for the cherry peppers, and overall, the entirety of the burger was underwhelming. The burger was also kinda...small? And I could probably make a similar burger myself at home. Bun was nice. 

Where Shake Shack has In'n'Out beat are the shakes themselves. I had a vanilla custard float, and it was AWESOME. The custard was creamy and heavenly!! I would come back just to try more shakes/ custard flavors :)  They also offer wine and beer, which is a huge plus. 

I love the location, and especially love the outside seating with the view of the strip. There is usually a long line, but it moves quickly. 
FYI, new locations coming in 2016.....including West Hollywood!"}
{"text":"Another Burger place?
So what makes The Shake Shack different from all the rest?

In one simple answer: \"The Shack Stack burger .\" A breaded and fried, portobello mushroom stuffed with gooey cheese on top of a juicy cheese burger. 

This is what separates shake shack from everyone else. Although they offer regular burgers and cheese burgers as well as hotdogs, it's the uniqueness of the shack stack that I found SS a burger place I would keep coming back to. 

On the downside, the price for the shack stack is just under $10.00 and nothing else but the sandwich. You may order  fries or cheesy fries or just a thick custard based milk shake. 

I love East coast restaurants venturing  out here to the West coast, so keep them coming."}
{"text":"amazing! best cheese fries ive ever had! and amazing burgers!!! i love this place"}
{"text":"I see what everyone is talking about. I got the shroom burger and it was freaking amazing! With a small shake to go it was a great night. Just wished I'd gone ahead and gotten the fries, so I was stuck sneaking them off my companion's tray when he wasn't looking."}
{"text":"This is a very busy location especially lunch time on a Saturday!!! But the food is just as good as the regular New York New York, Henderson, and downtown Summerlin location. I'm so happy we got to try it out! This just means they're consistent with their food quality.

My friend got the shroomburger & I got the smoke shack. Fries extra crispy (crinkle fries). A chocolate shake and a cookies and cream shake.

We sat outside and it was very nice. Tip: have one person order and the other find a seat because it is packed! Be prepared to share a table with another party."}
{"text":"My experience was top notch for a little fast food joint on the outskirts of the strip. With big flashy letters, \"Shake Shack\" can't be missed!! It was cold out and they even had outside seating with warmers! Awesomeeee to just sit and people watch. When you walk in the line seems pretty long but it went by really quick as I caught myself still staring at the menu still when the customer in front of me was waving in my face to let me know a register had opened up. I feel like I didn't even have enough time to decide! Lol. Nonetheless, I ordered the Shack Burger  and my boyfriend got the Smoke Shack. We got a side of crinkle fries, a lemonade, and their featured lemonade which was mango. It cost about $22 which for fast food is a bit on the pricey side, but let me tell YA... It was worth it!!!!! They give you a pager that goes off when your food is ready. We went to find a seat and the interior design was pretty dope. It was as if we were in New York itself. Little park benches and comfy couches. Our food was ready and I was super excited! The burgers weren't as big as I thought they would be, but it was enough to fill us up. The meat was cooked to a tee. It was so tasty, beyond the fact that it only had tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, and shack sauce (delish). The fries were yum, golden crinkle cut. And the lemonades were pretty good! You'll definitely see me back again. Gotta try out their shakes and custard! Welcome to Vegas, New York!"}
{"text":"My first experience at a Shake Shack and it was a good one. Upon walking in on a Sunday afternoon I noticed it was extremely noisy. I am pretty sure it was a bad combination of open high ceilings, lots of kids, and loud music. 

As it was my first time I checked out the menu and walked up to order. I ordered the smokeshack with fries. The girl at the register asked if I wanted \"Everything\" on it and I said yes. I was given my \"buzzer\" and found a seat. I love the water station, very thoughtful for those that just want water. 

By the time my buzzer went off someone was already bringing my food over to me. I was a little disappointed in the burger when he put the tray down. I didn't see any lettuce, tomato or onion. I came to find out that only the regular shack burger comes with that. 

My disappointment was quickly erased after the first bite. The burger was cooked perfectly and had a great flavor. The thick niman ranch bacon was a fantastic addition to the cherry peppers and shack sauce. A really good burger. The fries were excellent as well. They were also cooked perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Besides the mix up on the toppings and the loud atmosphere I really enjoyed my first Shake Shack experience. I look forward to returning to try one of their shakes."}
{"text":"We're fans and have been anticipating the arrival of Shake Shack to the Charlotte area. 

When we arrived the line was all the way out the door and past the building. It took us 15 minutes to get to the cashier to order and then we waited about 15 minutes to get our food after we ordered. So a 30 minute wait all together wasn't that bad for me.

I went with the Chickn'Shack which was amazing. My only gripe was that I wanted more. To start I am a fan of potato rolls and bread. This bread is the perfect accompaniment for these sandwiches. The crispy battered chicken with the herbed mayo was perfect. 

Since they don't have a kids menu my son went with the Single ShackBurger with ketchup only and he demolished it.  

My hunny ordered the SmokeShack and it was good too. He let me take a bite. And then another when I asked for some more! LOL! The cherry pepper on the burger is not overpowering and balances out the smoky and saltiness from the bacon. 

We ordered two fries - one plain, one bacon cheese fries. The fries themselves were good but not sure we order the bacon cheese fries again. At almost $5 they were skimpy on the cheese and bacon. 

I really love custard but the custard here did not do it for me. It was just okay over all. 

The lemonade was overly sweet. And that may just be our taste buds and preference. We had to water it down significantly in order to be able to drink it. 

We'll be back. The burgers are made right and so are the chicken sandwiches."}
{"text":"Omg their chicken sandwitch is to die for! This is my most all time favorite chicken sandwich! They got perfect fries and you can add cheese to them ! Also have great awesome burgers! Great Shakes and great staff always happy!"}
{"text":"Next to in and out this place is good. I never tried shake shack before and heard so many good things.  Once I saw it in Vegas I had to try it and trust me it does not disappoint.  The line is very long do be patient but it's worth the wait.  Fries are crispy and good and everyone is friendly.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is boss
The shakes are amazing. The staff is friendly and there's a water tap!!! Talk about a win!!!!

But the thing that ruins it isn't the staff it's the customers.  
CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF AND YOUR DAMN FAMILIES.

This works just like a cafeteria, people seriously leave their mess on the tables. Ummm this isn't a dinner there's no waitress here how are the other people suppose to sit and eat? And this is what your teaching your children, to be slobs? Instead to have common sense and courtesy to others? 

But the food is legit, my fave the shackstack!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my god, Becky look at her buns 
It's just so big, she looks like one of those five guys girlfriends 
I like big burgers and I cannot lie. You other brothers can't deny. When a girl comes in with a burger and shake and some cheese fries in yo face get sprung, cuz you know that burger was stuffed
   Shake shack wasn't around in 1993, but if so I would guess that the lyrics to his most famous song would go something like that. Now even though I have traveled to New York, I rep west coast like and had never eaten shake shack until this location opened and I truly understood that shake shack vs in n out was the burger version of 2pac vs biggie except this beef is a lot more delicious. Shake shack made sure to come correct, the venue is on the outside of NYNY, sleek design and I randomly like that they used old bowling lines for tables. There's two windows to order from. One is a quickie for drinks, shakes and swag and the Other is for food. There's the shack burger which is cool, but essentially just a cheeseburger, but what really had me speaking like ODB was the smokeshack. Take a cheeseburger, make it double, throw bacon, peppers and shack sauce and you have my attention. I could serenade that burger 24/7/365. That's the kind of burger that makes you call your significant other and tell them you ain't never coming home. I tried two of the beef hot dogs an I wasn't impressed to say the least.The crinkle fries are good, but the cheese fries are incredibly overhyped. Like Magna Carta overhyped. I much preferred regular fries dipped is shack sauce I also tried out the shake, and while it's good, it's not Better than in n out, but it's almost double the price. Which is quite possibly my only gripe with this place. A double smoke shack, fries and a shake is about $20, a meal I can get from in n out for less than $8. I'm not sure how much of that is shake shack and how much of that is the fact that it's on the strip, but you get what you pay for and tha shack is quality yo.  
So to paraphrase sir mix a lot again:
Ladies if the bun is round, and you want a double patty showdown
Dial 1-900-CHZBURGR and kick them nasty thoughts
Baby I'll be back"}
{"text":"The first time I had Shake Shack burger was when I was in N.Y.C 5 years ago. That time, I was not quite impressed with In 'n Out as a basis (I am an Angeleno). I heard how popular this burger chain in the East Coast and slowly coming here in the West side. 

Couple of weeks ago, I went to Vegas with my family. Upon hearing that there's a Shake Shack that recently opened along Las Vegas strip, I was eager to give it a try again before going back to L.A.....and that time, I was impressed.

I ordered a cheese burger. What I like about this burger is that the patty is the thickest one I've ever had recently. As most of the burger chains's patties have been shrinking, Shake Shack maintained the same thickness of patty I had 5 years ago. Thumbs up!! I also had French fries and chocolate milk shake, which there were nothing special. 

It was a very busy night, and so, our orders got messed up and missed a lot of orders. However, they were corrected promptly after telling them what we were missing. And also because it was very busy that night, it took a while to get our orders. 

I was glad that I gave it another try. Although I'm still an In 'n Out fan, I'm very enthusiastic about them branching out here in West Hollywood."}
{"text":"Came here with a coworker yesterday and their food is just as wonderful as their customer service. I got the chicken sandwich, some fries, and a Carmel shake. My friend set the expectation high with their chicken sandwich. She told me that it was better than chick fil a. I have to agree. It taste very fresh and crispy. The cashiers are quick and friendly even bough there was a long line. Appreciated someone coming over to clean our table and grab our trash when we were done eating. Place was nice and clean and has a hip style to it. Definitely recommended and will bring my husband along soon to try one of their famous burgers and another flavor shake."}
{"text":"I have Shake Shack for the first time in Austin and loved it!! One just opened in Dt Summerlin and thought I'd give it a try. I love the way they cook their burger meat. I like when the meat is tender and cooked well. The bun is soft and overal a good burger. I remembered the fries to be a lot better BUT it could have just been a batch that wasn't so fresh or the oil. Hopefully next time they Taste better. And I got a lemonade and it was a good lemonade! 

Seating inside and outside."}
{"text":"We had heard the hype.  My hairdresser related how he stood in line for hours to get in to the store in NYC and it was the best he had ever had.  Other folks I talked to were all worked up because it was a hip place.  We watched it being built as they updated and remodeled Uptown Plaza.  It was fun to see the place change from Boston Market to a Shake Shack.  When they first opened there would be lines around the building and the lunch crowd was huge.  We waited a while before we went and maybe that is why I have to say - MEH.  They definitely have NYC prices on the food - yikes!  I got a single Shack Burger which was mediocre.  The hubby had the Bacon Burger and felt the same.  We split a $2.99 order of fries expecting it to be large but it was barely enough for us!  Generic crinkle cut fries too.  I got an iced tea because I could not wrap my head around the $6 shakes.  The hubby got the shake of the day - chocolate cardamom - and it was small and again - MEH.  It is no where near the quality of burgers we've bad from local places like Wineburger or Hamburger Works.  Glad we tried it but doubt we will return."}
{"text":"The first time I came to Shake Shack, I didn't like it. Ordered their Hot Dog at the time, which was tasteless and horrible. Seriously, a hot dog from a movie theater tastes better than the one from here! I didn't come back for a while, until my husband later heard from some friends that the chicken sandwich was very good. So I decided to try the Chick'n Shack on my next visit and I loved it!! This is honestly one of the best chicken sandwiches that I have ever had. The chicken is always juicy and not overcooked. My usual preference is no mayo in any of my sandwiches, but their buttermilk herb mayo was pretty good. Also, unlike the Hot Dog, the Chicken Dog here is awesome and packed with flavor. I have always been a fan of crinkle cut fries and usually order the cheese or the bacon cheese fries.

Although the food here is expensive, customer service is top notch! There is always an employee walking around the dining area, asking how the food is tasting, offering to get a drink refill for you and taking away trays and throwing the trash away. They also clean up the tables in a timely manner, which is great because at other fast food places, you sit down in the restaurant and find oil, crumbs and other trash on and near your table. 

Other than their Hot Dog, the only other thing that I don't like about this place is that they give you a buzzer while you wait for your food. I'm sorry, but those things have a lot of germs and who knows how often they are sanitized! Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"On our Las Vegas trip we decided after a day full of sun to take a nap, but by the time we woke up there were hardly any places open! We had heard of Shake Shack before and due to the pictures and menu on here we decided to give it a try! 

With all of the money we had spent on food during our vacation so far we were expecting expensive, this place was not! We were pleasantly shocked. We also asked about MLife perks and found out that we could essentially \"skip the line\" which is awesome because their lines were out the door at 11PM! The ladies at the checkout counter were so nice and helpful even though we knew they most likely dealt with crappy people all night long. 

I got a hot dog, fries, and a soda. My husband got a vanilla shake. My hot dog was a little on the greasier side, but it would have definitely made for good drunk food had I not been stone sober ha ha. The fries were perfectly crispy and salted, which to me is something very rarely done right! My husband loved his vanilla shake. 

When we come to Vegas again there is no doubt in my mind we will visit Shake Shack!"}
{"text":"Very well manicured and managed establishment. TV's showing sports is a big plus in my book. 

The ambiance is laid back and Melo with pop music playing in the background. 

All good but food could use an upgrade. Burgers were relatively small compared to other burger joints. Had two single cheeseburgers with two orders of fries and a drink. ~$20, not bad for two people on the Las Vegas Strip. 

But the meat was thin, the meat was greasy and salty along with the fries, too much sodium. 

Overall good value for the price but food could have been better."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of the burgers here. Everything tasted really fresh and the service was good. The fries don't do anything for me. They're not good or bad; they're just crunchy crinkle fries with salt."}
{"text":"Shake Shack was nothing but a solid experience. We stopped by for an early lunch (~11:30am) on a Monday and found no wait, though the place was still pretty busy. 

I ordered their Smoke Stack Burger which had peppers, applewood smoked bacon, and cheese and also added pickles bc I live for pickles. My boyfriend ordered their classic double cheeseburger and we shared a side of cheese fries and a chocolate malt. 

I loved my burger and it solidly deserves 5 stars. The bun is fluffy and flavorful the meat is juicy without being too fatty or drippy, and the toppings really enhanced the burger without being too much. I thought the cheese fries were solid also, but probably come closer to a 4/5, mainly because there could have definitely been more cheese. 

As far as comparison goes, I like it better than some of the fancier burger chains, especially when you factor in the price, but once you do factor in price In-n-Out is still my first choice if I want a meal under $10."}
{"text":"This place was soooooo good! It was one of the only places we went to to eat while on our LV get-away! The customer service was amazing. The employee at the cash register was so nice and she helped me decide what to order. It was packed but we luckily found a round table that could sit all seven of us! The burger was really yummy but the thing that won me over was the shake! It was so good! My other friends ordered different seasonal shakes so we got to try each other's, but mine was by far the best one!

I hear that there's a rivalry between In-N-Out and Shake Shack, and as of now I need to try more of Shake Shack's option to see the competition. Regardless, it was really great and next time I see one I'll try it. I hear there's one in Glendale, CA!"}
{"text":"Friend from New York recommend to try Shake Shack, Sunmerlin, Las Vegas.
Here are my experience today; (1 to 10)
Clean, service = 10
Bathroom = 8 (clean but smells)
Price = 9
Portion = 8
Quality of food =2 (had a smoky shake, my burger was very chewy and freezer burn taste

In & Out Burger is 10 times better
My friend was surprised hear my complain about the burger, because she loves to eat @Shake Shack in New York. She told me she never had a bad experience. Wonder why so different quality of food in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever tasted... the bacon cheese fries are amazing and not to mention the lemonade. Every time I come to Vegas I have to hit this spot at least once!!!! I usually order the smoke shack and bacon cheese fries... I haven't tried the shake but the food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"As delicious as the shake shack I had in NYC. Ordered the smoke stack and fries. The line was pretty short at 11pm and we were able to easily find a table inside. We're waited 15-20 minutes for the food, but when it came out the fries were fresh from the fryer and the burger was so satisfying. Friendly service. Open till 2am which is awesome. Keeping it on my late night eats in Vegas for sure."}
{"text":"After having visited the original location in Madison Square Park several times, I was disappointed in the Las Vegas expansion.  The wait time for our food was excessive and they let our burgers sit under the hot lamps while our shakes were being made (which came out liquified and mostly melted).

If you want a mushy burger and want to wait for it, check out Shake Shack. Otherwise, grab a burger elsewhere in Vegas and go to Shake Shack the next time you are in New York."}
{"text":"hamburger PERFECT it so yummy you just want to leave it in your mouth!! french fries BOmB!! def coming back!!"}
{"text":"The only thing that needs to be said about this place is that it officially dethroned bang bang burgers as the best burger spot in Charlotte. The line isnt as bad as it looks. Go.

I recommend the regular shackburger and add bacon. If you are a big eater get the double patty. The single with fries was more than enough for me. Also got the cookie concrete ice cream.... Incredible. A must try."}
{"text":"We always have to stop for Shake Shack when we see one, since Northern CA does not have them!

The short and dirty of this review is :Yes its super yummy, but NO, its not as good as in n out!!!!

Their burger is fresh and organic, no doubt. But its nothing any more special than in n out. The only thing I like better about Shake's burger is their bun. Its a potato bun and way moister than In n outs IMO!

Onto Fries. Fries are Better than in n out. They are crinkle kind and actually SALTED. I get their cheese sauce on them every time which is seriously magical. Its like queso- not a piece of sliced cheese melted on top.

Shakes are good- but not as amazing as a Neapolitan at In n out.

Also- its more expensive. $25 for 2 cheeseburgers, 2 fries and 1 shake.

You get more bang for your buck at In n Out!

PS-they sell doggie biscuits which is A+++++ in my book."}
{"text":"Every bite of my delicious chick'n shack was memorable! Definitely became a fan of Shake Shack. The chicken was fresh and the employees were nice. Good food + good service = happy me."}
{"text":"In N Out is still the winner. I tried this place because I heard that it was a good competition for In N out but it was not as good. The burger was pretty small, but the flavor was okay. The fries were pretty good, they were thick and not as greasy, but they didn't taste as fresh. The shake was good as well, it was really sweet so I couldn't finish it. It was all pricey though since they do not offer combos or a meal, everything is separate."}
{"text":"Custard is not super flavorful, I had the pb toffee crunch and the topping were only on top not mixed in like I expected, so there was not much on it. My husband did not like his root beer float, said it tasted strange with the custard not like a classic float. And it melts very fast! Im assuming that is what custard does, but I'd prefer to go to the Ben and Jerry's around the corner. We did not try the food just the ice cream here."}
{"text":"A total treat for west coasters who are in visiting Vegas. The service is fast and efficient, and the food quite satisfying and tasty. You can tell that the quality of meat is better than most fast food. 
Don't forget to leave room for the frozen treats. Go for the concrete or a milkshake."}
{"text":"Been to the NYC location many times.  Always long lines in NYC.  Surprised to see a Shake Shack in LV with no lines at 10pm on a Thursday.  Now I know why.  The quality of the food does not match that of NYC.  Burgers were dry and sloppily put together.  Shake Shack better pick up their quality or they won't be able to compete on the Burger Joint studded LV strip."}
{"text":"If I could eat here every day I would, thank goodness I live in Henderson otherwise I'd gain so much weight! (Although it would be so worth it) It is by far my favorite burger joint in Las Vegas. I have never left here disappointed. 

Since they have put the new chicken shack sandwich one the menu it is my go to item of choice. The chicken is so juicy and the breaking is crispy and flavorful. I've had other chicken sandwich places and this sandwich is heaven. 

When I get the burger I get the shack burger, the sauce makes it and I am not one for sauce on burgers but shake shack's sauce with the melted cheese just makes the burger."}
{"text":"The place was crowded upon entering and there was a 15 minute wait. 

Food was mediocre, overrated and expensive to me. I ordered a chicken sandwich and my friend ordered one of the burgers. Both sandwiches were decent but it's safe to say that I've enjoyed Chic Fil A & Five Guys more."}
{"text":"The most over hyped operation since CMG ... but I wish I bought their stock."}
{"text":"First time at any of the Shake shack locations. There wasn't a line and they were very happy to hear that we were first time guest.  Got the Shakestack , fries and a red wine. Wonderful service. Great food.  They even checked to see if everything was going well during the meal.  I would go back to this location"}
{"text":"Good service...pagers for pickup nice touch... Burgers were very good ...simple cheeseburger..soft steamed bun slightly toasted...house beer is a Brooklyn ale..nice match.

I can see why this place is always busy! Hit it between lunch and dinner- relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has decent burgers, way overpriced. $15 for a small burger, fries, and a small drink is nuts. The taste is alright but I've had better, at a cheaper price. I don't feel this is a place that I would come to if I was craving a burger. Just my opinion..."}
{"text":"I'm a burger girl. I love burgers. If I could I would eat them every day. So it was necessary that I try Shake Shack. Came here while shopping at Downtown Summerlin on a Sunday. 

Walked in and there was no line. Loved the decor, this place has a cool ambiance. The menu was pretty extensive. Since it was my first time here I kept it simple and ordered the double shack cheeseburger, fries, and a strawberry shake. My bf got the double burger with bacon and red peppers, fries, and a chocolate malt. The cashier was very friendly and informative when it came to our questions. Our order was over $30...somewhat high for burger place. But I do like that they use hormone free meats...

Didn't take very long for our food to be ready, which was a plus. My burger was awesome. I got extra sides of the shack sauce to dip my fries in. Loved the crinkle fries, perfect mix of crispy outside and soft inside. Only downside was that I really wished they had ranch. I love ranch with my fries...but what can you do. My bf really enjoyed his burger and thought the peppers perfectly complimented the meal. 
My strawberry shake was delicious, I wish it was bigger! My bf wasn't too impressed by his chocolate malt. He thought mine was better. We are big Luv It fans so we're picky when it comes to custard shakes.  

Overall everything was good. The price was a huge turnoff, if I ate alone it would be almost $20. And I wasn't too happy about there not being any ranch. This is definitely a place worth trying."}
{"text":"I've never had a chance to try Shake Shack before, so I was interested when the new location opened up at NYNY Hotel & Casino. 

The line wasn't too crazy based on what I've seen to be the norm. I went for the shake stack, cheese fries and a drink. All this for $17.50. Yikes!!! 

The burger was solid and the I enjoyed the fries, but for a fast food burger, that price was steep. I liked the burger, but if I were ever to happen upon Shake Shack again, I would skip the fried stuffed mushroom. The concept sounded delicious, but I was disappointed in the execution. It was over battered, dry and the cheese stuffed inside was a watery mess.

It was good for a one off, but I'll stick to other notable fast food stops for my burger fixes at 1/3 the price."}
{"text":"Shake Shack has finally made its way west haha. im a big fan of shake shack have been lucky enough to try it in NYC, DC, and even London so i am super excited that there is now one in Vegas! the look and branding of this location is pretty much the same as any other location that i've been to but the space is pretty big! lots of seating - both indoor and outdoor which is nice. 

i was hesitant to wait in line since it was stretching out past the entrance and down the stairs, but it moved really fast and it really was only maybe 10-15 min from waiting in line til the time we got our food. the staff here is all super friendly too. the cashier taking my order was especially cheerful which was cool that she was so excited about my burger haha. prices seem pretty fair too. single shack burger was $5ish. love that they also serve beer and wine here too to keep your buzz going. its only fitting that this location updated up at New York, New York and this is a welcomed addition to the las vegas strip!"}
{"text":"Very good hamburger . I got ye double and my gf got a single . Not as good as in n outs burger but a very good burger if you're looking for something fast and different than what you can get anywhere else . Fries were basic and nothing real special . No combos which is kinda a drag because it increases your bill"}
{"text":"First time here at Shake Shack at Kierland. (Parking is a hassle by the way) Ordered the Shroom burger deep fried portobello mushroom with muenster and cheddar cheese melted on a burger with lettuce and tomato. It was very good, not real big, but satisfied my hunger. The fries were Kringle cut with cheese sauce. I didn't particularly care for the cheese sauce. Kind of bland tasting cheese wiz style. I will be back to sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"My second visit was great. Celebrated my grandsons birthday. This was his choice he calls it hamburger and ice cream place. I ordered our food on this visit and was impressed with the employees and the way they interact with their customers. The best service I have had. Polite, helpful, caring, friendly."}
{"text":"Okay okay okay. It took me almost 30 out of the 25 years I've been alive to have Shake Shack, but lemme tell you, I am glad I went before my 30th birthday.

It's a hip environment. A real breathe of fresh air. Especially because it's down the hall from a massage parlor, so you may want a change of scenery after a manicure, pedicure, or whatever is your poison. But Jesus Roosevelt Christ I digress.

I went basic as a ham sandwich and just got a burger with some ketchup and lettuce with a side of fries. It was like someone poured love in food form
into my mouth! All the answers to life were in that hamburger. It was so good. Even the little
things like getting water were cool - they've got these little handles that look like they are from a Speakeasy. I like details.

Hit up Shake Shack before you make a dietary choice not to eat meat for personal or health reasons. You won't regret it unless you eat like 8 in a row, and even then you probs won't, but will just have a tummy ache."}
{"text":"This place is extremely popular among the tourists as well as the locals so the lines can sometimes be out the door and down on the strip.  Theres a good reasons for the lines though.  = )  

Our first try at about 2 pm on a Sunday made us turn around and go to Fatburger. The lines where crazy.  We decided to give it another try on a weekday and where there about 20 minutes before they even opened.  The manager came an opened up about 10 minutes early when he saw that there where people waiting.  Thats what i call customer service! 
In comparison we had to wait 20 min pass opening time last winter while we wanted to try Berlins Berlin Burger International. Quite a difference in customer service there so applause to Shake Shack.  

As this was our first visit after hearing all the rave reviews we did not want to go crazy but sticking to what made them famous. The burgers of course.  Had the double shackburger with pickles and cheese.  

All burgers here looks amazing and picture perfect. Biting in to it i noticed that it was very juicy even though they cook the burgers well done (i prefer medium rare if the meat is good).
The lettuce was crazy crisp and the tomato ripe. The Shack sauce is a 1000 island similar sauce and not that far from In n out's sauce.  The best thing about the burger was the amazing cheese that had melted and felt almost like a creamy cheese sauce.  One of the best burger cheeses ive had.  

What brings the burger down for me was the bread that i think is too thin and doesnt make the rest of the burger justice.  Still a solid great burger without any crazy stuff too it.  

The ambiance and layout of the restaurant is nice and the location on the middle of the strip outside NY NY is hard to beat.  

I would say that the burgers are a 4 star for me, the value is a 3.5 as its a bit more expensive then In N out while i would hold the latter a tad higher also in taste.  

The manager opening up 10 min  early bumps the place up though so without him i would have given Shake Shack a 4 star rating.  So enjoy your 5 star rating and give the manager a raise!"}
{"text":"I honestly didn't see what the hype was about? Their milkshakes didn't even bring any boys to the yard. (haha yah i'm a dork). I've had better shakes and burgers at local joints with shorter lines and less expensive. I don't think I'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"The smoke stack is my favorite burger! What makes it is the cherry peppers! The double down fries are a must buy make sure you have someone with you to share it cause it's a generous size order of fries! The double down fries is the cheese fries with bacon and the cherry peppers"}
{"text":"My favorite burger joint I've ever been to! The burger is seasoned to perfection! The double smoked stack and cheese fries are my go to's! The chilies are a must also"}
{"text":"I love this particular Shake Shack especially because it's the only one I've been to without having to stand in line for an excessive amount of time for a burger. But they're so famous I was willing to stand in line for an hour in New York City to try it and then again when one opened on the Vegas strip. Now, no line at Downtown Summerlin for the best burger in my humble opinion (yes even better than In n Out, Five Guys, Smash and FatBurger)...and you pay for that extra dose of gourmet but it's worth every meaty bite  And now they have a chicken sandwich that was so good it will now substitute Chick-fil-A for me until one opens in Vegas. And I'm obsessed with Chick-fil-A. But on second thought it's all the way in Henderson so I may just convert to Shake Shack chicken. The crew at this location were nice and didn't judge me when I had a beer for lunch, cause why not, I work in morning radio, noon is my happy hour."}
{"text":"One week after it opened we went there on a Friday night around 745 pm and the line in the mall was about 20 mins long.

We ordered the smoke stack burger which is a Single or Double Cheeseburger topped with applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and ShackSauce. I had the single and thought the burger was no bigger than a McDonald's regular hamburger.

Also had the Shack-cago Hot Dog which was very good. The mixture of peppers and pickle made the dog tasty.

Also had a chocolate shake, regular fries and a mango lemonade.

The chocolate shake was a little melted and could have been a little bit more solid frozen.

The French Fries were crispy the way I like them and not soggy. 

The Mango Lemonade sounded interesting enough to order and was good but definitely had a tang to it at the end.

Overall we had 2 burgers, fries, a chocolate shake and a mango lemonade which cost $31. Those might be New York prices but thought it was on the high end which you could get a gourmet burger for similar cost.

Rating it a 3 for high cost compared to what you get."}
{"text":"Small size burger for price you pay. McDonald's size burger at NY prices.
Shack Stack, burger with mushroom for $9.59, burgers taste good but when you compare the prices of the gourmet burger restaurants, I would not come to shack shack.

The Shack Stack burger comes with a beef patty and a portabello mushroom that is slightly breaded and the size of the burger patty.

Food is tasty and fresh, qauntity and price are the down fall"}
{"text":"This place isn't worth the wait. The burgers aren't anything special and are rather small. I feel like In-N-Out is better. I will say that the portabella mushroom burger was actually tasty - although not a healthy alternative (deep fried and stuffed with cheese). The fries lacked flavor as well. I also had their Shake Attack, it was good, but still nothing special."}
{"text":"I'm from California and had never tried one before. Burger was good but nothing spectacular. Fries weren't great, was wishing I'd got the cheese fries. Will have to come back to try a shake."}
{"text":"Had lunch was ok. I feel it's over priced. You have to pay for each item a double cheeseburger,fries ,large coke and a small chicken on a small dinner roll and small coke $24.31. This was for 2 people. The fries are small. You get more fries at McDonald's and have to say McDonald's are better
 If they are busy No seats. Had people standing next to our table and asking are you done"}
{"text":"I believe in the hype!!! First of all, please do not compare Shake Shack from In N Out burgers! Those are two different burgers. 

Anyways, I recommend getting the Shack Stack burger (if you love cheese and mushrooms)!!! It's a combination of their cheeseburger & their mushroom burger. The best part about this burger is that not only there's a patty inside, but a deep-fried portobello mushroom filled with cheese. IT IS HEAVEN. Take a bite of that & that cheese is oozing on your burger! Bite with caution though because the oozing cheese is hot! I also recommend getting their cheese fries! Their fries are fresh and fried to perfection and it's that perfect melted cheese that tops it off! 

Shake Shack, you just gave me a different perspective in burgers now! Thank you lol."}
{"text":"Shake Shack is okay. Their shroom burgers are a good option for vegetarians. Unfortunately that is about all. For those vegetarians who can't eat mushrooms, the cheese sandwich is pathetic. I asked for a cheeseburger without meat, what I got was a horrible grilled cheese sandwich with a cooked piece of lettuce and thin slice of tomato, no sauce. They should go on a field trip to In N Out to see what freshness looks and tastes like (I have included a picture of an In N Out Grilled cheese for reference). As well their shakes are nothing special, despite being part of their name."}
{"text":"I read good things about this place . I waited in line for about 10 minutes , ordered a single smoke shack burger with a strawberry milkshake.  My order was ready in about 10 minutes and l took my food outside to enjoy the perfect weather . The burger was flavorful, and juicy. The milkshake was very good . All that being said , l don't think they are better than In n Out. And you can go to In n Out more conveniently than going to the Strip. But if you are up there playing tourist and want a good burger it's a good place to try ."}
{"text":"Shake yourself on over and give this place a try!  I found it to be very appealing to visit on a beautiful Saturday.  The decor certainly doesn't scream shack - more chic, less shack.  At this time of the year, sitting on their outside patio is prime time people watching and is very desirable.  I highly recommend giving them a try.  Definitely a good burger.  But the fries are the stunner here!  Oh their fries are but pure perfection!   Crispy salty outside with a delicious moist center that makes for an amazingly delicious pomme frite!

If you are into a traditional kind of burger (ie lettuce tomato onion pickle) then heed my warning.  When you're done paying $10.61 for a burger and fries, only --- no shake, no drink, I say go back to Five Guys and pay ~$6 for a burger that is just as amazing or better in the same mall with less of the \"Wow-factor-of-an-overrated-chain\" line.

Return Factor: 30%"}
{"text":"Best burgers I've ever had !! I love this place ! I came here when i was on a weekend get away and honestly it was the best burger i have however tasted and not to forget those fries !"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I had a shack burger and fried with a peanut butter milk shake. Extremely decadent and all for a great price. Staff is wonderful, best service in a fast food restaurant ever!"}
{"text":"My first time trying the Shake Shack ever. The interior is nicely decorated, they need more seats inside though since it's always so hot in Vegas! As many fast food places are: you order, take a seat, and wait for your buzzer to go off to grab your food. Lines are quite long but go fairly fast and service is phenomenal. 

Of course I had to try a SHAKE, hence the name! Our cashier said the 2 most popular shakes are the strawberry and coffee. The strawberry was so so, nothing amazingly special, I'll have to try the coffee next time. The strawberry shake tasted exactly like in n out burgers strawberry shake, but just more expensive. The cups seem small.

The BURGERS I tried were the Shackburger and the Smoke Shack Burger. I enjoyed the regular Shackburger more. The burger buns were made like pockets, I thought that was very creative and cool. The special shack sauce they used was tasty. And cheese was really good. The burger patty was a bit chewy. And the FRIES, the crinkled fries were my favorite part!!! We tried both the cheese fries and regular fries, both very crispy and again cheese was very delicious! Overall, I prefer in n outs burgers more, but fries more at the shake shack. As of now, the shakes are the same. And the selection is much larger than in n out, but it's also almost double the price! I don't know if they do free add ons to you burger like in n out does or not, will have to ask next time."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came out to Vegas and decided to give this place a try. The cheeseburgers were so good !!! Way better than in n out in my opinion. They were a little smaller, but he meat was well seasoned. I think that's what made it stand out. The fries were nothing special, probably won't order them again. I'll get a chicken sandwich and a cheeseburger lol. The staff was super nice and for the amount of business they had the restaurant was well kept. 

I came here on a Saturday and Sunday just because it was so good lol."}
{"text":"One of the items on my to do list in Vegas was to find a fun place to grab dessert. After leaving the nearby T-Mobile Arena, this seemed like the perfect place to stop (close by). We walked in the door & went to stand in line only to be told by an attendant at a completely different door that we would have to go out through that door & wait in line. The attendant at the door was letting one to two people in at a time. I felt this was kind of strange but she opened the door just far enough so we could slip past her to stand in line behind one other person. As soon as we walked out & got behind that person, she said it was ok for us to go in. Note: why not put a sign on the door leading everyone to the one door to stand in line. This was just awkward. 
There was a short wait in line. We ordered a chocolate & strawberry milkshake. We waited for our order for about 5 minutes which wasn't bad for the number of people that ordered ahead of us. I was pretty disappointed at my milkshake. When you pay $6 dollars for a milkshake, I would expect them to at least fill the cup to the top. Well, they didn't. I was too tired & hungry to say anything but I was kind of annoyed. 
The strawberry milkshake tasted really good so I was happy about that. And, my husband really liked his chocolate milkshake too (and his cup was filled to the top)."}
{"text":"Let me keep it funky with y'all on this one. This place is OVERRATED and OVERPRICED. It's not that it's not good, because it is, but for the hype I was expecting mouth changing orgasmic food. I can get similar foods from various places. If I want crinkle cut fries, American Deli does that. For a good flatop burger you can go to Mr. K's, Zacks, or even.....Smash Burger. Even the concrete is essentially run of the mill soft serve ice cream and cookie butter you can get from Trader Joes. They are able to overprice the food because of the name and following. 

Again, I'm not saying this place isn't good for what it does and it may sound like I'm ragging on it, but I just want to be one of the few that gives a different realistic opinion from the masses of \"It's Amazing\"."}
{"text":"Was walking down the strip, unsure of what to eat and then i came across Shake Shack which sounded catchy at the time. How i would describe it... to a larger chain fast food restaurant would be.... Smash burgers. The burgers are of quality and the cheesy wrinkles fries are pretty bomb. Something that i would highly recommend is the black n white milkshake..... which is soooooo goood but yet sooooooo bad for you. It has that creamy cookies n cream texture but goes down smoothly with the fries and burger. shack burger, cheese fries and milkshake came out to be around $15. If you're looking for a decent prized... quick meal in vegas... slide through to shake shack and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not much to really say about the shake shack. You can never go wrong with this place. Burgers are always great and even the fries are tasty. My last time here I ordered the regular shake burger actually 2 of them cause I was hungry, fries, and a peanut butter shake. Everything was delicious and price was pretty good. Cost about around $23 or so. 

I'd always recommend this place to the burger fan. If your hungry I'd order a double patty or two separate burgers because they are kind of small. Similar to the In and Out burger joint."}
{"text":"Shake It If You Must

Overall:

Eh. If you want a burger this is the place to be. Just do not expect something mind blowing or special.

Parking:

Typical strip parking. Walk, taxi or just park at the Monte Carlo or New York self-parking/valet. *5 stars*

Establishment: 

Nothing too special about the decor. Service was okay. You order at the counter. I did feel a bit rushed during the order process but nothing to cry about. *3 stars*

Food:

Smokehouse burger: Decent burger with a nice spicy kick nothing mouth burning. *3 stars*

Cookies and cream shake: Again nothing amazing just a decent shake if you are in the mood for one. *3 stars*

Shake of the week (Cookies and cream): Nothing special about this either just a bit rich and creamy. *3 stars*"}
{"text":"Move over In and Out, your east coast competitor, Shake Shack is in town.  There's something about Shake Shack that makes it so good; maybe it's the soft steamy bun, the cheese, or the seasoned meat.  Or memories of New York... Whatever it is, Shake Shack is one of my favorite fast food stops in Vegas.  

The ShackMeister, RoadSide, and Shroom Burger are some of the favorites I've tried; the hotdogs are pretty good too.  The sound of crinkle fries and nacho cheese doesn't sound too appealing, but at Shake Shack, is surprisingly good.  

If you have room, try one of their delicious shakes; and if just looking for a drink, their lemonade is pretty awesome and resembles the lemonade from Hotdog on a Stick minus the hot girl churning lemons.  

Can't wait for Shake Shack to come to Los Angeles."}
{"text":"The line might look long, but it moves really fast. 

The burgers were SMALL but DELICIOUS. We preferred them to In N Out... but we live within a couple miles of In N out, so maybe it's lost its special uniqueness to us.

We all thoroughly enjoyed the fresh meat and the soft buns. Ironically, we all thought the shakes were just OK... nothing to scream about. But those burgers... YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Luckily, I was able to try this place when it wasn't too busy. I was sad to have missed it while I was in NY, so I couldn't pass it again. 

I highly recommend getting the Shack Stack. It pretty much sums up the whole Shake Shack experience and you can totally forget about the rest of the list. The buns here are soft and cut half way through like a Bao. The angus beef patties are cooked medium topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato and their signature combo, a fried cheese stuffed portobello mushroom. Every bite was a flavor bomb! You can't miss out! ($9.49)

If you're wondering about the SmokeStack... It was just okay. I didn't really like the grilled cherry peppers. It didn't complement the bacon as I thought it would. The bites weren't as cheesy or juicy as the Shack Stack. Instead it was a bit dry. (single $6.69/double $9.49)

I also tried mixing the vanilla and chocolate milk shake. Nothing special. ($5.25)

The crinkle fries were a decent size and crispy but not wow. It would've been better with the cheese. (plain $2.95/ cheese $3.95)

My only complaint is the price to food ratio. Yes, I get it! It's the only Shake Shack in the West Coast. We welcome it! But, for the price you are paying (Vegas price), I could've had a gourmet burger that's 2-3x the size. The burgers here are way too small to really fill you up. That is unless you load up on their fries and other menu items. Now, I know I didn't come here for the fries! Not after all the hype... And especially when you have hungry tourists waiting for 40+ mins in 100+ degree weather. It can be very disappointing. 

Let's just say its like an itch/craving that you have but you didn't satisfy it. It's good to have checked it off my list. Thank you Vegas!"}
{"text":"My family and I had a great time... Service was fast and friendly food was hottt and scored an extra burger lol ... Highly recommend the double down fries fed entire family we will definitely  return..."}
