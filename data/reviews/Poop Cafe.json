{"text":"The only attraction of this place is the novelty of it, and that too isn't anything that will have you coming back. It's a cramped space with barely any air circulation, so be prepared to sweat. The menu items were completely mediocre, ranging from sickeningly sweet to bland. All of this could be put aside in favor of giving it another chance if the waiter who served us hadn't had such a terrible attitude. Will not be going back and would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This poop cafe IS a 'poop' cafe, afterall. Its interior design and decorations does not disappoint and I would have to admit, its design was amazing. Our water came in urinal bottles and if you are lucky, you get to sit on toilets! The toilet was covered with a 'poop' face cover. All the walls were decorated with poop characters and fun facts about our poop(s). Honestly, I really enjoyed the ambience of being in a poop cafe and it was one of the primary visits that I came during my visit to Toronto. The service was good, except it did take awhile for our mango bingsu to come. Our mango bingsu came in a toilet bowl, but it looked more like a bath tub. Other people had actual tiny toilet as their dessert plate.  I've had better bingsu before, but the poop theme made up for its 'alright' food. The waiter was really nice, and took care of us well. But I would have to say, if they had better food, it would have made this place much much better. But, you should come here for this one of a kind experience at a poop cafe. I guarantee that you will get a good laugh sitting on the toilet bowls and reading all the facts that had on their walls as decoration (even in their bathroom)."}
{"text":"Very disappointed not enough varieties of Poop food, need some poop soup and poop sausage. Also where is the mild nudity warned about in the App Store."}
{"text":"I went to poop cafe and didn't have to wait long because it was a weekday. Once you enter the store you notice the bar to the left where the food is prepared and you can also check out the merchandise they sell. The decor is really cute with all sorts of poop drawings on the walls. You are seated on toilet seats although it may get uncomfortable after a while since it does not have a back rest. The desserts are presented in various toilet bowls or tubs. It's definitely poop everywhere you look."}
{"text":"Came here a couple months ago when they first opened with my sister and let me just say that their customer service was reaaallyyy bad. We had to seat ourselves because no one was there to greet us when we were told to go up and it wasn't even busy at all. I also had to ask them to replace my water TWICE because both times I saw something floating in it. We saw their staffs using their phones out in the open which I just find very unprofessional. Anyway, food was ok, nothing special other than the fact they're served in toilets or whatever. Would never recommend this place though because of our bad experience and honestly you can find their desserts in other places for a more reasonable price and they would probably be more tastyz"}
{"text":"My sis & I came here over the weekend. First impression was not good at all. We were just told to go up the stairs & seat ourselves lol we didn't know what to do at all. We found that our server was very rude. There was a bug in my sister's water TWICE. Had to ask them to change it twice. Food was okay, nothing special to it. Just the interior & the theme was unique, other than that, it's rip off. Overall, honestly would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Staff is very very unfriendly. we went crowded. staff told us we cant use credit card device because we are crowded. service so slow. i dont recommend"}
{"text":"I really want to come to a poop cafe for experience.I ordered the mango bingsu.It was okay.It was fun.It's nice if you just want to relax and enjoy your dessert in a cute little toilet bowl.The place is cute.It's just a little expensive but it's okay."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place 0 stars, I would. Being a big party of 13, we called ahead to see if they made reservations. The girl who picked up said that they did reservations and assured us that they had space for a party of 13. We arrived 10 minutes before our reserved time and wanted to let them know we were here. It took some time to get a worker's attention,but when we did, we were told that yes they did reservations, but they were too busy to accommodate us at the time. He told us that the girl who picked up the phone was new and she didn't know, and we should have made a reservation earlier. If we wanted to wait for a table, it would be an hour's wait. We didn't want to wait, so we left. If you want to eat here, I would recommend that you call ahead and call back again before you go just to confirm."}
{"text":"Staff was nice but the Oreo that was on top of my ice cream was stale and I didn't like how it was only one scoop of ice cream on a bed of shaved ice milk. For the price I paid it was not worth it and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"came when it was first open and it was so hectic, line was crazy long and service was slow and mis managed but now it's been settled in and service is much more organized and order comes in faster 

food itself is okay, like it's good i never tried anything i didn't like but it's not super bomb that i'd comeback for the food by itself 

the atmosphere is really cute, they did a good job on decor like the chairs and all the drawings is so nice!! the only reason i keep coming back is for the atmosphere it's nice and chill to relax with sweet with friends 

the price is okay a little on the more pricy side (around $10) but the big con i really dislike is how the desserts come at different timings. when you come in a group, you want everyone's food to come at once not  wait around while it starts to melt :/ 

best thing i think you can get is the bingsu and milkshake"}
{"text":"A great dessert shop. Even passed the novelty aspect of being washroom themed cafe, the desserts make this place a must stop in Koreatown. 

The Oreo bingsu (shaved ice, condensed milk, corn flakes, crushed oreos, a scoop of cookies and cream ice cream served in a mini toilet) was fantastic! ($9.99)

My girlfriend ordered the Hong Kong waffle cone which was served with a scoop of Oreo ice cream and topped with a mini kit kat bar and 2 reese's peanut butter cups. ($6.99)

Service was quick and very friendly. 

Only problem was my girlfriend and I didn't know that we were supposed to sign in in order to be seated, so we stood around for 7 minutes before we found out. Other people seemed to have the same problem. But other than that little setback, this place is definitely a place to stop in if you've got a sweet tooth. I'm definitely going back sometime to try the Thai ice cream rolls, milkshakes and Affogato."}
{"text":"Dirty, bad service, expensive and bad food.
When we told the waiter that the donut in the milkshake was stale, he responded that \"they buy them and sometimes they are not good!\".
I guess the cafe theme, extend to the food they serve. 
Not worth the time!"}
{"text":"It's a great place to go once, but the food is overpriced. We went on a Sunday and it was really busy, there was a waitlist and we waited 40 minutes for a group of two people. They sat us at a 4 person table, so we asked them if we could move to the 2 person table to make room for other people. They then forget our order because we moved tables and 25 minutes later we asked them where our order was, and nobody knew, so we had to reorder and wait again. We did not even get an apology. I would recommend going only once and be prepared to wait if you go on a weekend. The ice cream is sub par and good but not the best I have ever had for a whopping $10."}
{"text":"This place is clearly not for adults, the quality was pretty bad... The waffles were undercooked and the strawberry cheesecake was full of shaved ice which made the dessert watered down and tasteless. It was definitely overpriced! The decor was cute and fun for kids, your kids might enjoy it but I wasn't too impressed with the quality of the desserts."}
{"text":"Coming here on a rainy day brought us more laughs than we could have imagined. After reading the reviews, we had no expectations of good dessert. It was more for the experience, how often do you see a poop cafe?  

The service was very friendly, nice and helpful. I really have to applaud them for running back and forth up the few flights of steps with the desserts and drinks. Those toilet mugs and bowls are not light! 

The strawberry bingsu was very filling and they were very generous on the strawberries! With the rain and cold, I got a Japanese Milk Tea, which I had no expectations but I absolutely loved it. I enjoyed it so much, I tried looking for such packets where I live (no luck). 

We had a side table which was to the end corner but the rest of the space felt spacious enough. One thing that I didn't like that much was that for the side table we were sitting at, there was no additional spacing to put our stuff except the floor. And the seats (toilets) did not have a back so I couldn't put my bag or jacket on the back of the seat, it was just slouched. 

Overall, it is a cute place to go for dessert with friendly service. The puns and drawings on the walls are funny. Also, they have poop cafe stickers!"}
{"text":"very disappointed and a bad dine in experience... the dish and container are old and broken.. the food is ok, no surprise. we left money and tips on the table, but the waiter  still chased us and said we're not paid. the table is not big enough for us to hide the money. how come he cant see it. only I can say he 's f***ing blind. definitely will not come back and NOT recommend to any friends."}
{"text":"The furniture and the general feel of the restaurant is fun. You'll be sitting on toilets and getting your food in a toilet bowl. But nothing special about the desserts. You kinda go for the experience but will probably not come back regularly"}
{"text":"We went early on a saturday and were the first in. Everything is super cute and you actually are sitting on a toilet while you eat, it's pretty funny. My friend and I were both happy with what we ordered, everything was so cute. The menu has good options for dairy sensible people. It's easily accessible since the metro is two minutes away. It's a fun place to see, and get a dessert at. Kawaiiiii!!"}
{"text":"FAIRLY DISAPPOINTED! This place is NOT WORTH THE HYPE at all - save yourself the trip. We went about a week after this place opened, on a Tuesday evening. Waited over 30 mins for a table for two! We didn't even get the toilet-themed seats! We were seated at a regular, makeshift table in the corner at the back because they were so busy - which took away from our experience. Finally, when it came time to order, all of their bingsu had sold out!

To be honest, none of the menu items seemed 'poopy' enough. It just seemed like a mish-mash of asian desserts that have previously or currently worked in Toronto (green tea ice cream, hong kong waffles, elaborate milkshakes, thai rolled ice cream, etc.). There is NOTHING really original or special about this place. They really could have taken full advantage of their 'poo' theme and been more creative with their desserts. They didn't.

After settling for a hong kong waffle with a scoop of ice cream (I chose espresso), and another side (I chose strawberry pocky sticks), we ended up waiting another 45 minutes for our desserts to arrive. I had to ask another server if our order even went through. She never came back to reply. Concerned, we had ask front desk again to see if our order had went through. 

Finally, our food had arrived. The only good part about my order was the hong kong waffle, which was more crispy and well-done than what you'd find at your typical waffle place in Chinatown. Everything else, I seriously could've just made at home for 1/8 the price. Although the chalk drawings on the side of the walls were cute, it wasn't anywhere near decorative enough to be worth the experience of a 'poop cafe'. 

The $10.40 I paid was definitely NOT worth it! I won't be coming back anytime soon.

Lastly, THEY ONLY ACCEPTED CASH!!"}
{"text":"Place is very crammed. Service is very slow. Deserts do not taste exceptional at all. 

It's all about the theme.

It was nice to give a try, but not a place I would go to again or recommend."}
{"text":"HYPE!!!  It's okay if there isn't any lineups.  Just come here for the experience,  the food isn't that good."}
{"text":"Interesting idea coming from Asia, however poor execution. Expensive for what you are paying for. The only \"poop\" related part of the experience was sitting on the toilet seat chairs. No POS system, so all bill amounts are calculated manually on a sticky note.  Long lines and tacky decorations. Don't come in with high expectations."}
{"text":"I'm not the type of person to go to places just for dessert. I prefer, when having dinner, to do everything at a restaurant. Dessert places always seemed to be packed and Poop Café was no exception. Luckily, when we arrived, there was a table of 4 available, but when we left, there was a huge line to get in. So not worth it.

Menu here is just  basically waffles (the kind you get at a Holiday Inn Express free breakfast bar) with a variety of ice cream flavours ranging from the Western to Japanese/Asian. At $10, the bland looking waffle with melting ice cream on top (and two random Pockey sticks sticking out), was a let down.

My husband and I shared a Nutella Poop Waffle which is basically a small palm-sized crap-shaped waffle (which was uber dense) with a smear of Nutella on top (not even inside the waffle). But I get it...the smeared Nutella is designed to look like diarrhea - yum.

Waffle dishes come with spoons. No forks or knives available.

There are three drink options only. The special Vietnamese coffee was basically crap-colored water with 10 pounds of sugar dissolved. I left it untouched. Bubbletea flavours here come with a weird aftertaste. 

The novelty of sitting on toilets and drinking out of urinal-shaped cups quickly dissolves when you pay $35 (excluding tip) for bad waffles and tea.

Our waiter was awesome though - he had some funny jokes which was definitely the highlight of the evening."}
{"text":"Most of the glorious desserts are ice cream or ice related. Best to go in warmer weather. 

As a Hong Konger, their HK egg waffles are delicious. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  The Waffles with ice cream is a great marriage together.

The bingsu is a giant beast.  If you do not have a super sweet tooth, share with a friend.  I was mindblown to know cereal and ice cream are meant to be together. I spoke about this to many people after. It is served in a novelty toilet bowl, but definitely everything is clean.

The decor are drawn to the theme, with multiple \"fun\" poopie facts.  This is a nice place to relax with a few friends just to giggle and talk.  Free wifi!

Employees are nice and chilled. They are around the corner if you need anything, and isn't constantly up to ask you questions.  When you are laughing over your mess, sometimes you just don't want to be disturbed right?

Although its not as fancy as the asian countries poop cafe, its a great place to start, and to test your adventurism."}
{"text":"You can't help but smile as soon as you walk in. Everyone needs some time to just forget about life's troubles and have some fun, silly time.

While the decor has a poop theme but not a hard core, gross look.  It has somewhat of a kawaii feel(poop emoji style with mini urinal for drinks, mini toilet bowls or bath tubs for food.), the food does not have a poo theme(not at the time I was there).  I was told on my visit that while yes the cafe decor has the poop theme, Lien, the owner, wants her food to be beautiful and to me it sure was. She doesn't want it to look like people are eating crap.

Lien made me a lovely mango bingsoo/ Korean shaved ice dessert. It was delicious and lovely looking. Mangos were sweet and perfect ripeness.  I don't know what type of ice cream it was or if it was housemade but it was some of the best I've had.  Her shaved ice has a flavoring as well to give it her own touch so as it melts, you don't have a watered down tasting dish.  Sauce was served on the side to add to your liking.   

I was impressed that she thought to ask me if I was safe with eating nuts before she made my dessert. The owner was very polite, kind and fun and we had a good chat. She has done pretty much all the decor herself so she's talented both in that and in food. She's worked hard on perfecting her own recipes and I can't wait to try more.

The place was very clean, cheery and I definitely recommend to anyone to go once it's officially open. I know I'll certainly be going back!!"}
{"text":"HYPE ALERT: Toronto's first poop cafe is finally open!

Essentially Poop Cafe is a dessert bar with ice cream, shaved ice and cereal (bingsu), HK egg waffles and thai ice cream rolls. Only the ice cream (bingsu) is served in the toilet bowls. Very gimmicky but super insta-worthy (if that's why you were there).

We ordered the mango bingsu (shaved ice with ice cream), matcha hk waffle ice cream and a coconut bingsu. Overall it came to $35 with tax and top. (Btw they accept cash only) It was all very average so be prepared to pay a premium for the whole gimmick. 

The service was pretty bad - our water glasses were dirty and all of the food came at different times so people were still waiting for food while others already got theirs. Overall, mediocre food, bad service and premium prices all for shit."}
{"text":"Having read some reviews about this spot already I'm really surprised by the poor reviews. Who thought poop could be so damned adorable?? Definitely not this guy. But the kitsch here really works. There are poo-themed decorations abound, toilets for seats, urinals for water cups, items served in little toilets, .... when we stopped in there was even a poo-themed Xmas tree!
We waited all of two minutes to get a seat as a couple were just opening up as we arrived. It's busy. But they seem to be managing the crowd well. Our service was exceptionally friendly and if I had to call our waitress over to order or get the bill she was very apologetic (I honestly didn't see the need but I appreciate the enthusiasm).
I hope you've got a sweet tooth for this spot. The menu is desserts and various degrees of sweet and it's all as sweet as all the unicorn poo on the walls. It's not stellar food but it's good and presentation plays out well. I brought my daughter here (age 7) for a fun experience while she's in Toronto and she left with smiles and great memories. Don't let the trolls smear their poo over the Poop Cafe's reputation. It's a unique spot with a lot of charm."}
{"text":"The absolute worst service I've ever had. 
At first we noticed the line up was long and quite disorganized. They screwed up on the list and sat the wrong groups ahead of patrons who were waiting for over an hour. This happened twice while my son and I were waiting. Once seated we had to wait an additional 20 mins for service. The water cups were dirty. After a gaze at the menu, I asked our server who hardly spoke English about ingredients in the berries almond açai bowl. Apparently sweetened with stevia. He said no it was sweetened with dates and didn't know what stevia is. I asked another waiter and she said it didn't have any dates and was sweeten with sugar. They weren't able to answer any of my sons questions about the menu either. The people sitting next to us noticed our frustration and said they just went through the same thing as well. 

Unfortunately my date with my son wasn't the best due to the horrible service and quite frankly tasteless and boring menu options

I'm not one to complain much and give bad reviews but if you have any class and don't want to be taken for a chump, stay far away from this place. Just horrible!!!!"}
{"text":"Is the infamous poop café the $hit? Conveniently around the corner from the TTC Christie station, right in Korea town, this quaint little cafe serves a limited assortment of trendy asian desserts. You want egg waffles, Thai rolled ice cream or Korean bingsu shaved ice? Then squat down here on their (actual) toilet seats and appreciate the fece-themed decor. No detail was spared as even their water glasses come in mini urinals! But how does the price digest? You're paying almost $10 for desserts that cost half of that at any other asian place. The food is fine but nothing spectacular or crappy. I'm squeezing a recommendation in. Come for the novelty but in terms of visits I doubt I'd drop a deuce."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for our food. Mad gimmicky, mediocre overpriced dessert. Go only if you wanna sit on toilet bowls and look at all the poop puns. Novel idea, very poor execution."}
{"text":"Food is very good and comes at a normal rate. They should be more comprehensive about their vegan ice-cream option.  The atmosphere really gives off the theme. The walls are painted, the seats are toilets, and there are two huge poop statues. However, when we first arrived we were confused. There was no one there to help us get a seat, and just a sheet with waiting list. We were not sure if we should write out names on the waiting list and come back after. There was a small hole that lead to the kitchen, so we had to ask them through there."}
{"text":"Terrible service!

The food is so mediocre and although the decor is fun and playful, if you like long waits, and disappointing slow service were they forget what you ordered, can't get their attention and don't give you cutlery this is the place for you. The hype is not worth it."}
{"text":"Came here at night on a Sunday and it was pretty busy.

Pros:
- Very unique (centered around poop lol)
- Food was pretty good.
-Decently priced for the portions offered 

Cons:
- Slow service"}
{"text":"Super slow seating and even slower service. This is definitely just a one time visit for the concept."}
{"text":"We came with a party of 4 and waited for 30'. There was no menu at our table for the next 10'. Ordered matcha ice cream and oreo ice cream. Not too impressive. 
There next day, 3 of us got diarrhea."}
{"text":"Its funny, I'e past this place a number of times but had no desire to go in until a friend of mine who loves novelty decided we should investigate. We are both big lovers of random gimics but I felt like the poop cafe kind missed the mark. I tried the poop bowl  almond caramel  flavour with shaved ice. It was good but kinda became a mostly icy decadent lactose heavy sludge which I could not finish. My friend had the croissant thing and had a similar complaint. Also the water out of the little urinal was also a bit off-putting. Its funny about the psychology of all this. I really wanted to convince myself the water was fine but was hesitant. 

I'd recommend it for someone who has a stronger ability to drink water out of mini urinal cups and likes getting super lactosed!"}
{"text":"I'm given 3 stars because you should know what you're getting into when you enter a place called \"The Poop Café\". However I would highly recommend one of Toronto is fine other dessert spots instead. But, if you enjoy drinking hot chocolate out of a toilet bowl then Poop Café is your place!"}
{"text":"I went here already once but just thought I ordered something I didn't like out of luck so I went back in hopes of redeeming my first visit.

Honestly the whole cafe decor is pretty exciting since it has a niche/novelty thing going on. There are great signage and decor and you even get to sit on toilet seats. Most of the plating has a toilet bowl or sink as their dish. Overall it's cute.

One actual complaint I have is that both times I went, the washroom, which is unisex and 1 washroom, ironically actually smelled like poo. Like it was very strong, idk if they wanted to keep up with the novelty in there as well but it was really bad.

However once you pass the novelty of the washroom theme, overall the food wasn't that great. First time I went my gf and I got the nutella, oreos bingsu and the poop waffles.

 The bingsu wasn't that great. The best part of it I guess is just the one scoop of icecream, other than that, it sits on top of shaved ice that didn't really taste like anything and surrounded by some chocolate pieces and cornflakes cereal. Once you get to the end, it's basically just watery and not appetizing. The waffles during this first visit were actually okay, but just okay 

The second time we went we just got the holy milkshake that looks like a very instagrammable foodie pic. But the milkshake toppings were just cheap and overall was just diabetes in a jar. The cotton candy is just cotton candy, there was cereal bars on sticks for show (basically fruit loops bar and Reese's Pieces cereal bar), there was also dollar store rainbow candy, a donut that could've came from Timmies and 2 pretzels covered in punk chocolate that didn't taste that great. For the milkshake itself, it did not taste like anything at all. What we did was that on the side of the jar, we put these pop rock like things in just to have taste. 

Overall this milkshake is just for show and doesn't taste good at all. It was also $15 and not worth it.

This will probably be the last time I come back here, it's just a novelty cafe and you can get better desserts elsewhere."}
{"text":"Two weekends ago I visited the poop cafe and was thrilled to see they had a vegan and lactose free section on their menu. As someone who is both gluten and lactose intolerant, it is difficult to order desserts at restaurants.

The dairy free section of the menu mostly included rich tasting smoothies.  Since I really wanted real food at this point of the day, I ordered a peanut butter smoothie, which seemed to be the least sweet option. 

When the smoothie arrived, it tasted fantastic! It was so good but a little too sweet for me. 

This cafe is okay but I didn't think it was anything too special. My advice to the restaurant would be, when people come in groups, not everyone wants dessert. Perhaps it might be wise to add some snackable items onto your menu like edamame and other things that aren't infused with sugar. 

Honestly, I think this restaurant is mostly hype and we had to wait a long time for a table. I would go back if they add some gluten and dairy free snack items to the menu. I think that would improve the experience for many people."}
{"text":"When you arruve you have to sign yourself in on the waiting list. The service was good. However, the desserts were not that great."}
{"text":"The 3 is the balance of the fun decor versus the too-sweet desserts. Who can eat a donut on top of an Oreo milkshake with whipped cream and like six cookies stuck to the side with cake frosting? Beware and share one dessert per 3 people."}
{"text":"I think it's actually named after the level of service. The decor is just to reinforce that theme. Super slow and disorganized. They didn't seem to actually know how to make the menu items. They threw away a lot more waffles than they served. The desserts we did (finally) manage to get that were actually what was ordered were... just OK. There are far too many places in Toronto to bother going back there."}
{"text":"I went here with my 7 year old son and he had a blast. Toilet humor is definitely right up his alley. We were the first customers there so we were waited on quickly. The decor is cute and funny and my son received a toy with his kids order. He enjoyed his dessert and my iced tea was refreshing. I will say that the carpets in the entrance we're in desperate need of replacing and had balls of hair all over them (yuck!). The owner was very nice and accommodating, but some of her staff not so much. I wish I could give it a higher score but the cleanliness and lackluster service from a couple of the waiters forced me to only give it 3 stars. I think you should definitely check it out especially if you have kids, but I don't think we would return anytime soon. Once is enough!"}
{"text":"Other than the theme of the cafe, there isn't anything remarkable or different about it. The service was mediocre and the treats were bland. Prices were reasonable though."}
{"text":"I saw a pic of this place on Instagram so when my friend and I walked past it on Sunday on our way to lunch, we decided to go to the cafe for dessert. When we went back, the line was out the door but we didn't think the wait would be that long since the place just sold desserts and drinks. I mean c'mon, how long does it really take to eat ice cream. Oh how wrong I was lol. We waited in line for over an hour! Some of you are probably asking why we just didn't leave after like 30 mins. Well, honestly I felt like I invested all this time standing here, I might as well wait it out. It was so unorganized at first because there we were in this line that was barely moving and none of the employees were addressing us. Some ppl were sitting down on benches or by the window so I had no clue if they were in the line or just ordering to go (some ppl gave up and ordered to go but those orders still took long because there were only 2-3 girls making the food for everyone). Finally one of the servers grabbed a notepad and called someones name to finally seat them. That's when we realized there was a list by the register so when I asked the server to write my name down she told me to do it myself. She wasn't mean or anything, she explained that it's basically the customers responsibility to write their name on the list, so that's what I did. After I did that then a bunch of other ppl behind us went to write their names down too. The line was getting longer and longer outside so the server decided to take the notepad herself and write down the names of everyone in line who wanted to stay. Anyways, we finally got seated and I was so relieved because I was tired of standing. We ordered the egg waffle with pumpkin spice ice cream and my friend ordered the Vietnamese coffee. Our drinks came in urinal/toilet shaped cups and our seats were toilets too. The cafe is cute but the food was just ok."}
{"text":"Poop cafe is ok. You sit on toilets. You drink out of urinals. You eat desserts out of toilet bowls or basins. Everything definitely goes with the theme.

There are cute poop-themed dolls that you can take pictures with. Last time I went, they had two massive poop dolls placed in the store.

Being a dessert place, you'll get to choose from a few different types of desserts/snacks. Bingsu, thai ice cream rolls, egg waffles with ice cream, milk tea, milkshakes, and poop-shaped waffles.

I had the nutella bingsu and the custard poop waffle. They are not bad. Bingsu is really small for what you're paying for, but they at least throw in a ferrero rocher in there I suppose. It's definitely not enough to share with two people. I can't remember if there was even that much shaved ice. There was a lot of corn flakes and almonds though. Basically lots of cereal.

While my review is not particularly favourable, the Problem is, where else would you find bingsu in koreatown? You'd think there'd be more dessert options beyond baskin robbins."}
{"text":"Honestly nothing more than a gimmick. I would just genuinely avoid places like this unless you actually just into the gimmick itself.

Personally didn't find any value of coming here other than the fact that a few acquaintance of mine dragged me here the one time. 

Food: Generic Bingsu that was quite over priced. Although it wasn't bad it was just generic dessert. Had the mango Bingsu and it was okay. Sweet with vanilla icecream and mango chunks on the side. 

Service: Friendly staff, nothing out of the ordinary just your typical order taker type service.

Ambiance: Poop decoration everywhere. 

Recommendation: Stay away from this place unless you want to pay in for the gimmick. Otherwise I don't see any redeeming qualities with over priced desserts and a concept that is dependent on the poop gimmick."}
{"text":"The theme of the restaurant although REALLY FUN the ice cream it self was not the best. It was really cute, a cool place to hang out with friends. The ice cream was decorated nicely, but tasted really...icey? Would not recommend coming here for food only for the sheer enjoyment of going to a cafe with toilets as seats"}
{"text":"Very cute little cafe! It is in a very nice neighbourhood, Koreatown that is not much of a walk from Christie Station. 

Everything is poop themed. The water cups are urinals, you'll be sitting on toilets and desserts are in tiny toilet bowls. What I liked most is the hilarious poop puns and decorations around the cafe. 

I would give this 5/5 but the food is a bit pricey for the quality. There are Hong Kong style egg waffles, Thai ice cream, bubble tea, Korean bingsu (shaved ice), etc. 

However, the customer service is amazing. They welcome you once you walk in and check on once and awhile if everything is okay. There is also free wi-fi that actually works well. The washrooms are also decorated with hilarious poop stuff, would be perfect if you actually had to poop. 

Worth coming and enjoying some quality poopie time!! Perfect for everyone and all ages!!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars 

The decor is super cute. The seats are actual toilets, the lights were the shape of plungers and the drawings and puns on the wall were very creative. Thoroughly enjoyed the overall design of the place. 

Now the food....the food itself was meh. You get pretty mediocre dessert for such a high price. Really disappointing!
I thought it was cool that the ice cream were served in a \"toilet\" and \"bathtub\" bowl and the water came in a \"urinal\" cup - but that was about it.

Not worth the hype."}
{"text":"This place may be a gimmick, but it's a gimmick of the highest order (is there a word for poop hype in the dictionary? #shipe?)... Not only is this cute cafe poop themed, but it commits to the theme throughout the experience -- from the chairs that are shaped like toilets, to the wallpaper adorned with toilets and poop facts, to the water glasses (that are also kind of shaped like toilets). 

Assuming you've come for the experience alone, it must be stated that the food is pretty good. The sweets are all delicious and have a good range of flavors and textures. The highlight was the Nutella ice cream dish complete with corn flakes and chocolate dust. 

A few detractors set the experience back, however, of which perhaps you should be informed:
1. Be prepared to wait. It may only be 20 minutes for 4 on a Friday night at 9 (and you can leave you cell number), but there's no place online where you can make reservations :(
2. There are only 5 toilet-shaped bowls floating around the restaurant. Your probability of getting your ice cream in one (as opposed to a bed-pan shaped one) is kind of slim. We did ask specifically for one and luckily our server was kind enough to hook us up.
3. Service seems a little sloppy, but it's there. Servers seem overly busy and, while they are calm, keep coming by and asking if you if you got everything (as if to imply you should have). We were missing 2/3 of our order. They kept coming by and asking us what they were missing.

Anyhoo, 3 cheers for poop! Kawaiiii!!"}
{"text":"Following the hype, decided to check out the newly opened poo cafe in Koreatown. 

The decor is very cute and very sh*t themed of course. The toilet seats are pretty comfy and the urinal water glasses also add to the glamour. 

The menu is pretty small right now and only has desserts. They are all asian desserts aka bingsu (shaved ice), bubble waffles, and ice cream rolls. There are also \"crazy\" milkshakes for 9.50 each. 

I ordered the matcha bingsu for 9.50. It came in a toilet bowl (more like bathtub) shaped bowl. It had greentea flavoured shaved ice, green tea gelato, chocolate sauce, cornflakes, red bean mochi and pocky sticks. The cornflakes was actually a delightful crunchy experience with the gelato and the ice went well with the mochi. I enjoyed this dish a lot! Albeit small for the price. 

We also ordered the avocado cocnut \"milkshake\" with a bubble waffle, The milkshake was just vanilla gelato, mashed avocado, milk and ice with coconut shavings. On top was a bubble waffle topped with whipped cream and more coconut shavings. This was a prettyyy heavy dessert and the avocado and coconut was a bit too much. Its pretty filling though. 

Overall, the service is friendly and pretty quick. However, the place is honestly mostly fueled on hype because the desserts are overpriced and not that memorable. The funny thing is, everything is poo/toilet themed in this restaurant except the food. There is only really one menu item (poo shaped waffle) that sticks with the theme. Ill be awaiting for a chocolate soft serve swirl dish if I ever decide to return."}
{"text":"This is a poop themed dessert house that serves Asian desserts (i.e. Thai rolled ice cream and Hong Kong style waffles). I found the desserts to be slightly overpriced, but you are paying for the fun and novel atmosphere. 

We ordered a Thai ice cream roll ($6.50) which was served in a bathtub like container. It was delicious. 

We also ordered a Hong Kong waffle cone with matcha ice cream ($9.50). The waffle was fluffy and flavourful. It contrast nicely with the cold match ice cream and the fruit toppings. I would recommend it. 

Overall, I would recommend the Poop Cafe if you are in Koreatown. It is a fun and novel dessert house. A caution to the wise - poop themed cafes may not be for everyone."}
{"text":"Went with our kids on the weekend.  The food is pretty good, fun presentation and a decent price but the service is terrible.  It was very busy when we arrived - they didn't seem to have a host/hostess - then we saw a sign on the wall indicating that you had to write your name on the waitlist.  We waited about 20 minutes for a table.  When the waiter came to take our order - he barked \"NEXT\" to me when I was ordering for myself and my kids.  The food came pretty quickly which was nice but then we waited and waited for the bill.  We finally stood up hoping they would take the hint and my husband ended up standing and waiting at the waiter station so we could ask for the bill.  We could have just walked out with out paying and I am pretty sure they wouldn't have noticed.  The kids enjoyed the poop theme and it might be fun for a one time visit but we won't be back in a hurry."}
{"text":"It's not even worth coming here even for the kitschy stuff, and just to say that you've been here. 

The food isn't any good, let alone over priced. The drinks, out of a small toilet was fun, but tasted meh. Most affordable thing was the \"poop waffle\" at $3. A small little pastry shaped like a poop, and get it with nutella and it's smeared on top, not even inside (why?). Much better actually than the waffle I got. Their staple dish is also egg dot waffles with ice cream and toppings ($8.50) but their machine was broken, so I got a regular waffle with \"hazelnut ice cream with almond crunch\" (nutty chocolate with almond pieces sprinkled on top), and oreo topping (just 1 oreo cookie). Really hard to eat with just a spoon (no forks or knives available)

I've seen more creative ways to incorporate the theme into the food (like soft served ice cream in the toilet cup?!) I just feel like they didn't even try. 

Skip it. You'll have a better time at Baskin Robbins"}
{"text":"This cafe is okay the desserts are unique but have basic flavours and there isn't much space in their shop. I went there twice and got ice cream rolls with my friends. But the concept of the store is funny since there are so many poop decorations inside and plus while you're eating you're sitting on brown fake toilets. You can go to my instagram to see more pictures @alannaemmalee!"}
{"text":"We had a blast experience at this poop themed cafe.. excellent food & service.. Must try there new fish waffle \"taiyaki\" with sesame flavoured ice cream. Yummmm!"}
{"text":"An underwhelming experience at Poop Café ...
A bite from our full review here:
\"As we looked at the menu with numerous photos, we realized that there is a reason why there was an exhaustion of poop-related decor prior to seating down. They were compensating for something indeed, as the most unique part of the orders was the dishes it was served in \""}
{"text":"All the concept it's very fun and it was a surprise to me that the ice cream was very good. I recomend the peanut butter ice cream. The service is a little bit slow. It's expensive, kids loves it even adults have fun here. Normally you have to wait to get a table I think is because they only have one waitress and one person doing the desserts."}
{"text":"The only reason my friends and I went here was to experience the whole sit on a toilet seat and eat out of a toilet shaped bowl! The ice cream didn't taste any different than any other ice cream place. The waiter wasn't really helpful with giving us recommendations. It's a cool once in your lifetime kind of experience. Wouldn't go out of my way to go here again."}
{"text":"So is much is this place seems cool I think it's more about the while factor. As many of the other yelpers have noted I would also say that this establishment really really needs to work on his cleanliness. My husband got the Thai green tea and I got the unicorn hot chocolate. They were both served in commodes and at least mine was all decorated with things but my husband was completely chipped from all edges and there were splashes on the side which really did not make this clean. We also got an Oreo waffle which basically only meant that it was a waffle with a scoop of Oreo ice cream and they stuck one Oreo and two or three gummy worms on the top. It really didn't make sense for it to be such a simple dessert and then the gummy worms were completely out of place.

The waffle was actually not bad and it tasted good but after seeing how tiny this place was and how sought after and the lines were long I was utterly disheartened and disappointed to see their lack of professionalism and cleanliness. When we were trying to leave we literally have to wait 15 to 20 minutes just a flag down one of the guys. 

When my husband was asking what was in each of the milk teas the employee had no idea and said this is green and this is red which made no sense at all so they should definitely work on their communication.

Again cleanliness is key. Especially when you are drinking or eating a desert out of a commode you really don't want to think about it being dirty such as a commode"}
{"text":"This place is only a novelty but cool to experience. The wait seems to be long as there isn't a ton of seating and its a small place. Food is delicious and the toilet shaped dishes etc are cute but I can't see going here more than once. This would be a nice place for a kid's part or to take an out of town guest to. The ice cream they give you is HUGE and everything looks like it will give you diabetes. Wait staff was hard to find and when we were ready to go it took a long time to get someone to come over and check us out."}
{"text":"My friends and me came here a week ago,we been here for 15 minutes and no one came and asked us for the table until I mentioned that. One of my friend ordered green tea matcha, she waited 30 minutes and finally got wrong order. Server didn't smiling at all the time they served us I guess because they have to climbing the stairs so often. They only accept cash so make sure you bring carsh"}
{"text":"A friend and I took a road trip to Toronto, and we arrived a lot earlier than anticipated. As a way to kill time, we drove around Koreatown to park, walk around, and take in the view. While I was looking for a parking spot (this was a little after 10AM and I couldn't find a closer spot than 4 blocks away), my friend yelled that she saw a poop cafe, but I already passed it. I made a couple of turns and got excited, but found out that it doesn't open until 11. 
We came back around 2:20 and it took almost 20 minutes to find parking, but the place is just so darn cute that it was worth it. We were seated immediately* and ordered right away and I just want to emphasize how cute this place is: urinal(?) cups and toilet bowls?! Talk about dedication. The next time in Toronto, I'm definitely coming back!

*I shouldn't have been seated immediately. I apparently cut everyone in line, walked up to an empty table and just sat there. I didn't know that we had to wait to be seated, and thought it was a self-seating cafe. There were a bunch of people waiting before me, but nobody said anything to me when I went up. Canadian kindness? If anyone that I cut is reading this, I'm really sorry and tell me to get to the back of the line next time!"}
{"text":"Came here after seeing Instagram photos with the cute toilet bowl ice cream. The parking here is pretty bad, so be prepared to walk a bit! The staff are friendly, but the service was kinda slow. 

My boyfriend and I got the Oreo Bingsu with a poop waffle on the side. Honestly, it wasn't the greatest thing I've ever tried. It was just okay, not particularly special -- except for the presentation. 

I don't think I'll come back here, but the experience was unique and it's quite an interesting place!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday afternoon and waited an hour for a table. This I could understand because they are still quite new with a lot of hype. Killed time by visiting some of the cute shops in the area. What I didn't understand was why the table of 4 next to us sat empty the entire time we were there even though there was clearly a long line of people waiting.

Got the coconut bingsu, poop shaped waffle with nutella and matcha latte. All three were disappointing. The bingsu was watery, the waffle had no taste (thank goodness we got the nutella on top so it at least tasted like something), and the latte had barely any matcha flavour. The water comes in glasses shaped like urinals which goes with the theme but it did seem a little off-putting to be drinking water from a urinal...

The service was a mess. Our 3 items came out separate from each other, and the drink came out last when we were almost finished eating. The servers all looked a bit confused and flustered.

The worst part was being overcharged for the experience. You pay at the front desk where the person adds up your order from the piece of paper that your server wrote on. There is no bill that they print out for you and they do not show you the itemized pricing. After paying, we asked if they could write out the prices for us. After reviewing it, we found out we were overcharged for the drink and somehow it added up to be about $7 more than it should have been. (We paid $30, when it should have been $23).

I felt they did a good job with the poop theme in the decor, but they had some drawings on the wall and phrases/puns that were strange. One included a pun on some swear words which I didn't think was appropriate for a cafe that is supposed to be family/kid friendly.

I really wanted to like this place, but it left me really disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered the doo doo waffle and the dough was still slightly raw on the inside when it got to my table. Very underwhelming. The only redeeming factor here is the novelty of the toilet themed decor."}
{"text":"Read various articles on the hype of this café so my friend and I decided to go check it out after dinner. It was packed when we went on a Thursday evening and waited about 10 minutes for a table which wasn't too bad. It was $9.50 for the Nutella Bingsu. I thought it was good. It was served in a toilet bowl filled with mostly shaved ice, ice cream and of course Nutella! I love this place because everything is themed with poop and how the café is designed from sitting on the toilets as your seats to the various poop comic drawings on the walls makes this place a lively and fun place to be. The staff are quite friendly and helpful. Overall, it's a nice place to visit and get some ice cream and desserts."}
{"text":"Great fun for kids! The wait was too long, the staff were nice but inefficient and the overall ambience was fun but a bit cheap. The food was all sweet desserts nothing of substance and way too much for any kid (so lots of waste) and they would benefit a lot from at least making a decent coffee for the grown ups who have to tag along..."}
{"text":"It's a fun place, but the service is terrible. It took over an hour for us to get an iced tea and a small poop taiyaki. 

I don't think I'd come back here just based on how long it took for us to get served."}
{"text":"What sets this place apart from any other place is the social media draw of going to a cafe with poop theme, and I was certainly excited about going and about being there. As you would expect, everything is poop themed from the toilet seats that you sit on to the poop facts on all the walls. There are big poop mascots you can take pictures with.

Unfortunately it becomes a place you come only once or twice because of what it lacks in quality as a reputable cafe/dessert location. It has a variety of dessert variations (waffles,  but some were not available. While portions are big, they are unnecessarily so and are pricy for the quality. It is a good deal if you're paying for the sugar content as all options are very sugary. We had the Taiwanese waffle cone with black sesame ice cream and fresh fruit. The waffle is store bought and not fresh, and the fresh strawberry was a single unwashed strawberry and fresh mangoes were some canned mango pieces. I liked the ice cream but it was also not what I expected.

What bothered me most is the cleanliness - our serving plates were visibly stained and I wiped off some brown stuff off of it. I DONT think that is part of the poop theme and is probably some left over chocolate, except we didn't have chocolate in our order. 

This is a novelty cafe and it is fun for the first 30 min but I am rating it as a restaurant/cafe, for which it was subpar."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the negative reviews are for, this place is a lot cheaper than some of the fancy ice cream places like Dunk N' Dip...you get exactly what you came for here...I had the Hong Kong Waffle with nutella gelato with Kit Kat and M&M's...pretty sure they used chocolate ice cream and just drizzled some nutella on it but that's pretty much what I wanted...too much of the hong kong waffle which is was actually quite tasty but too filling. Great place for kids, every kid that walked in were memorized by all the poop stuff and toilet seats.

Best to call for ahead for a reservation as it ain't that big and always busy."}
{"text":"It's a fun atmosphere, I like the humor. The food was great, a little pricey for the milkshakes but it tasted amazing. I'd recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Very cute cafe. Very small. Very nice decor. Clean.  The desserts were actually good and the presentation was very nice. Fun to bring kids to. 

The bad: had to wait for the table about an hour. No one greeted us. After a few minutes one girl that was also waiting for the table told us we had to put our names on a list in order to get a table. Stuff did not acknowledge us at all. Not too friendly. The waitress would not let me keep the receipt. Said they need to keep it for their records."}
{"text":"This is a fun, kitschy place to visit in Toronto. It really reminds you of how multicultural Toronto is, and how a place like this would never make it in America.
It's themed with poop everything! From the dishes to the walls.
The wait and the crowds have become very tolerable now that the initial opening rush is done. There aren't very many seats, so you still may have to wait. We did make a reservation by using FB messenger and they had a table waiting for us- no problem. The menu is much larger than it used to be! There are lots of delicious options. 
It is a dessert shop though- so don't expect any savory foods. Most of the desserts are ice cream, too. They do have a lactose-free ice cream if you need it.
It's a cute little novelty shop to check out!"}
{"text":"I never got the chance to check out a Modern Toilet Restaurant whilst in Taipei, so I shat myself at the chance to explore Poop Café when the concept was brought over to a Koreatown location back home.

First off, the seating area is raised up 1/2 storey, so this desserts restaurant may leave those with accessibility requirements feeling pooped. The front part has very crammed in benches for the waiting you may have to do to get a table.

Oh, they did their best to theme the business in globs of poop. You can sit on a toilet (which must stink when it comes to comfort or having to move them around). You can admire the wall covered in poo jokes and doodie doodles, and hey, the light fixtures are plungers! Water is served in urinal shaped cups; coffee and bingsu (Korean shaved ice, mashup with cereal and marshmallow and stuff, topped with an ice cream scoop of your? choice) gets the toilet bowl treatment. They ought to bust out the toilet paper rolls for napkins.

The treats they serve won't floor you down the drain, but is kinda pricey for the serving portion. But the service, while not downright shitty at all, could use some more attention. There's a lot of rushing around, not a whole lot of being able to get staff attention.

All in all, just another flushed out novelty business worth checking out just to scratch your curiosity's ass for.

{TTC: around the corner from Christie subway station.}"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend a few months ago. As per usual its all by accident; I forced her to get dessert with me here since it got popular  and who wouldn't like to try out a poopcafe theme. (Summer months)

We had to leave our name on the waiting list and waited to be seated. 
As we got our seat. I noticed that some of the seating are already worn out but the decorations and lighting changes (same with the wifi password too) 

I got the melon bingsu. It was literally half of the melon with melon balls, ice and milk. And my friend got the thai ice ream with 2/3fruits.
The area was a bit stuffy so they did have 2 large fans. (Its kind of dangerous coz its near the cashier area and the server are wearing aprons. The apron might get caught with the fan or server might hit it etc) safety reasons. 


With that being said we we're actually in front of it. Our food melted faster because of it. 

I also notice the other people around us that are getting hit with the plunger lights hanging from the ceiling. 

Overall it was okay.. At that time not really worth the hype. Its fun to try out atleast once."}
{"text":"I discovered this cafe when I was traveling with my family to Toronto. I got really excited that we found a poop cafe here because it's one of the major attractions in Taiwan which I didn't get a chance to go to yet. However, this one is such a disappointment. The store looks cute but it's super cramped with the heavy toilet seats that are placed so close to each other. You can barely move them around to get to where you want to go. But that's not even the biggest concern. The thing that threw me off is their terrible service. They totally forgot our order and made us waited for abt an hour. I only noticed that they forgot our order because our neighbor who got to the cafe later than us got their order already and they ordered the same food we ordered so it couldnt be that our food took longer to make. So I asked them if our food was coming yet. The waiter just quickly answered \"yes it's coming\" then brought over a poorly made bubble tea to my table. When I say poorly made I mean it's terribly made. The cup wasn't even filled to the top. There was an inch gap between the lid and the milk tea. The Tapioka were no where close to bubbles; they came in all different shapes. And they gave me a thin straw, the one that clearly does not allow you to drink the tapiokas from the bottom. So I had to ask them to give me a bigger straw. So then we waited again for the rest of the food which contains 3 more bubble teas and a Hong Kong style waffle. They only brought over another bubble tea after my second inquiry. The bubble teas tasted way below average( they were 4.50 each, and I ended up throwing both of them out after a few sips. I tend not to waste food as much as possible, but these bubble teas were not drinkable)By then my patience had worn off. It's been over an hour and only two bubble teas have been served. (Ps. Our neighbor had already finished their food. )So I asked the waiter to cancel the rest of the order and we will just pay for the two bubble teas. They just told us ok, then moved on to serve other customers. That's when I became really angry. How much longer are they going to make us wait?! They did not care about my needs obviously and they straight up ignore my requests many times. Is only when we got up and was about to leave the table they hastily brought over the bill that took them 2 seconds to print out. 
Bottom line, check the reviews before you decide to go to this shit cafe. My biggest mistake was that I was so hyped up about this poop cafe thing and did not check the yelp reveiws before I went in...."}
{"text":"Fun place to go :) 

As this place is brand new,  there is a huge waiting list and waiting time. Once you get a seat you also have to wait to order and get it. So don't be in a hurry. 

So just seat and relax ;)"}
{"text":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Way too overrated. Very kitchy place, poor decor, incredibly poor service. Line out the door, but the small place only had about 10 tables. This place is way too overhyped, and didnt deserve all the publicity it did, because they definitely can't handle the amount of traffic that comes through here. The theme is great, but I expected A LOT more from a place like this. If they go on at this pace, they won't keep customers coming. We had to stand for about an hour, and people were standing around after coming in, wondering how to put their name on the list. There is not a designated person at the door putting names on the waiting list, which creates mass confusion. The workers preparing the food are quite slow, which burdens them and the customer. Once we finally got a table (after an hour and a half) the table we were seated in (which was free for a good 20 minutes before we were seated there, not sure why we werent seated there earlier) was dirty as were the dishes. Our waffle was COLD and didn't taste good at all. Tacky place. Wouldnt reccomend or come back again. 

Honestly, if you want the same experience, sit on your toilet, eat a waffle, and google \"poop emoji images\". There you go. That's the Poop Café in a nutshell."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out because I thought there would be poop shaped treats, however the desserts we ordered looked nothing like the picture. And the Nutella covered poo shaped waffle tasted really bad. Not worth the money but it's still a cute place. The mango dessert was okay though"}
{"text":"The service was a little spotty.    I asked a server to clean the backs of the seats because all of them were covered in dirty hand prints but the server refused.     It took them forever for them to serve our ice cream.     Everyone who had arrived after us were served before us.
The servers where a little yonge  and inexperienced but a big part of the problem is the set up.     The servers looked tired climbing the stairs so often and the store had only been open for 2hrs.
They need a POS system and a server station with a small sink close to where the customers are so the servers don't need to go up and down the stairs so often carrying glasses of water.    
They could do the same business with fewer servers if it was planned out a little better.  Maybe a dumb waiter from the basement to the customer area as well.
When we cashed out the person behind the counter used a calculator to ring up the bill on two items and she had to do it twice to make sure that it was correct.    Again a point of sale system would make this a lot easier, and would make your account a lot happy come tax time.
  When we left there was already a line up and they didn't seem that busy.
Hopefully this will improve as they gain more experience. 
If you go here expect slow service and dirty tables and chairs.     On the plus side the floor and washroom was clean."}
{"text":"Mediocre. Unique and cool place.  Basically, everything goes with the theme-COMFORT ROOM/WASHROOM/TOILET. LoL. A bit pricey for some less sugary/sweet desserts."}
{"text":"This place is very engaging. The service isn't the best and my god it is not the cleanest but the food and interaction of DJs and such is nice. The concept is great especially considering society today loves emojis! The WiFi is written all around the wall however it does not work and I believe the staff knows it doesn't work and may purposely lead customers on to believe that it does considering there are 2 wifis here. Loved the food and the concept however, needs to work on sanitary habits, service and wifi offerings."}
{"text":"Food
Honestly, prior to coming here and reading these reviews, we were really skeptical if it was actually going to be crap. I don't see why this place is getting these harsh reviews as my friend and I truly loved it and would totally come back. We ordered a mango bingsoo, which they had no more of, but they did offer us a strawberry bingsoo. it had so many strawberries on it, and all were really fresh. Besides that, we also got a Japanese milk tea. It tasted different than your typical milk tea, as the tea flavor was heavy, but it was still good! . 

Service
The waiters were so sweet and polite even though they looked extremely exhausted. The place is severely understaffed, but those two really put their best faces on. 

Atmosphere
Imagine a world of poop ... that would be this place! The walls have all these poop related drawings on it, and even your seats are a toilet bowl."}
{"text":"Im sorry. How could you not give the poop cafe5 stars!? Sitting on toilets while surrounded by giant poops and poop themed walls, how freakin awesome is that?! Their desserts are nothing super special, but you come here for the fun not the exquisite food. Oh even the menu was a toilet! Definitely worth coming here if youre visiting toronto."}
{"text":"Took a long time to get seated, service wasn't very good, limited seats.

The theme of the cafe is very interesting, however, the food wasn't up to par. It took around 20 minutes to get seated and on top of that, the cafe only had around 5 to 6 tables available. Initially, I was very excited to try out the desserts and getting the opportunity to sit on a toilet was interesting. Water was served in a urinal. The dessert came quite quick, and tasted very generic.

I ordered the Nutella Bingsu and of course, it was very sweet. It tasted like any other chocolate ice cream, but it being served in a toilet was very fascinating. There were very cute and humourous drawings on the walls. The place claimed that it had wifi, however, I was not able connect to it, even though the password was plastered around the cafe. 

When it was time to retrieve the bill, there were almost no waiters around. There was one waiter who constantly kept looking at the menu and refused to look up and help the customers. Overall, I would not come back here, despite the cafe's unique theme."}
{"text":"The service sucks here! We sat down ourselves and waited like 10 minutes to get menus, and then another 15-20 minutes for our order to be taken. Once the order was placed, our food came out in about 10 minutes but our drinks didn't come till we finished all of our food. 

Service aside, the decor is cute however all of the China is chipped, and the poop throw pillows are dirty and have marks on them. The restaurant has a pleasant smell and you can tell they make their own waffles. 

We ordered the Oreo Hong Kong waffles, which was tasty but nothing special to rave about. For drinks we ordered iced coffee with tapioca which was extremely swwweet. Thank god, we didn't ordered too much food. Definitely will not be coming back, waste of money. Owner should get new servers, replace China, and clean the place up."}
{"text":"Here comes another themed cafe inspired by Asian trends.

Even though I have seen many poop cafe in China I haven't actually been to any of them, so I decided to give this place a try. Before coming, I took a look on Yelp on the existing reviews to get a sense of what to expect. I think generally speaking a lot of people didn't have a good experience here, possibly due to the cafe being quite new and didn't have the resources to handle the large crowds. However, my experience here was overall pretty pleasant.

Environment:
The cafe is quite easy to find as it's located very close to Christie station. I really enjoy their decor, as we get to sit on toilet bowls and the wall is drawn with cute pictures of bathroom objects and funny puns. The tables are decently far from the people next to you, so you don't feel cramped either.

Food:
For any themed restaurant usually there's a premium on the food, but I find this place to be quite reasonable in their prices. I think all of their items are under $10 each. I got the avocado coconut smoothie with egg waffle and it was really good. I like the crispiness of the egg waffle and the smoothie flavor was good. But I think overall their desserts are too sweet.

Service:
Like any Asian restaurant, you kinda just gotta accept that the service wouldn't be that good. Within 1 minute we sat down the waiter was already asking what we'd like to order. I get that they want to have the patrons move as quickly as possibly but this is downright annoying. Also, it's a little confusing that the cashier is downstairs and you have to walk down to pay. As of Wednesday Oct 19 they still haven't installed a VISA machine yet, so cash only, but I was told that they are working on it."}
{"text":"The food was nice, there was also free wifi but the place is a little hot and the services are alittle slow but all an all it was good."}
{"text":"Wasn't enough that this place gets poor reviews for service, but when you get seated after a long wait and half the customers have there food, this might be a real situation.. we were offered, drinks and menus quickly. Them our waters showed up... mine in a white urinal with someone else's chocolate on the glass (urinal) and on the straw. Like it was being reused.. as well as something dark on my daughters white straw when she took it out of the urinal to look at it after seeing mine... meanwhile only one other plate of food came out during this 5-7 minutes and one other couple left without eating..
We're gone!! #outahere #kindashady"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I was curious about the poop theme which lead us to this dessert place one night.  If you've ever heard the phrase \"curiosity killed the cat\", then this dessert place definitely killed my experience. 

We went as a group of two and waited for about 15 mins. While waiting we took cute photos of me sitting on a toilet, surrounded by poop paraphernalia.  Service was busy, and the waiters look mildly frazzled. We were also looking at other Yelp reviews, and the negative reviews were making us reconsider waiting. However, we decided to give it a try. 

We ordered the Nutella poop waffle, and the sesame bing su. The prices were kinda outstandish.  Both dishes were served in a bathtub, and our order came relatively quick. Our Nutella poop waffle ($3) legit looked like poop. It was a cartoon shaped poop with Nutella slabbed on top. Man, was that thing stale. The only thing worth eating was the Nutella. No wonder it was so quick, because it was already premade. The bing su was good, but the price exorbitant ($9.50). 

When we went to pay, our order amount was precalculated and written on a post it note. Cash only. They have a cash register, but choose to use a calculator to pay instead. I use post it notes to write notes, or send love notes... not use it as a form of receipt. 

Overall, very tacky furniture and decor, as well as underwhelming dessert. The washroom for some reason had a long wait, I'm unsure why. I hear it may be very instagramable."}
{"text":"I like the theme and the restaurant is very cute.  I ordered mango bingsu, the ice was powdery the way I expected but the mango was sour."}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to check it out as we were strolling around the hood and for the price and for actually been a restaurant is much better than going to Baskin Robins next door. The place is super cute, not disgusting at all. Well, maybe the urinals for water are a little bit. lol...but the mango bingsu was actually cute inside its toilet bowl, and tasty too! The staff was smiley and one lady even stopped to explain how the milk shaved ice is made as she overheard us taking about it. I think it was the owner and that was really nice of her. It's fun to visit, everyone seemed to enjoy themselves and kids of course love that stuff. I wasn't too impressed when I first heard of the place but now wish them luck and will be back for sure ; )"}
{"text":"I expected to wait a while since I know there's a lot of hype with this cafe right now so waiting an hour and half on a Thursday night was ok for me. What I wasn't ok with was the fact that: 1. 3 tables that ordered after us received their food first 2. our food was taking so long that we had to get our waitress to check up on it twice 3. our orders were placed at another table who clearly received their orders already and we're confused why they were getting another dessert. The waitresses don't have a system to take orders or who's taking care of whom. One waitress took our order and menus, 5 minutes later, a second waitress gave us menus and tried to take our order. 

The desserts were lack lustre as well. Their signature dish: bingsu weren't good. Do not, I repeat, do not get their mango bingsu. It's such a weird combo; fresh mangoes, chocolate sauce, cornflakes, condensed milk shaved ice. 

The hype isn't worth the wait, the food and the frustration."}
{"text":"Can I just say, the idea is hilarious but actually dining inside is severely uncomfortable. It's covered in poop from floor to ceiling, but the worst part is the little urinal cups you drink from. I honestly felt like I was lapping up toilet water... or something.

Anyway, when we arrived it was completely empty, so we could pick wherever we wanted to sit. The menu is comprised solely of desserts- bingsoo (korean shaved ice), thai ice cream rolls, egg waffles and regular waffles stuffed with nutella to truly resemble poo. 

We ordered the mango bingsoo, which is served in a toilet bowl (but also looks somewhat like a bath tub). The shaved ice is waaaaay too watery and the toppings tasted really average when mixed together. Fortunately the mango is very sweet, so I suppose that's the only plus here. 

The ice cream is really... okay. It's decent. Pretty ho-hum. You really only stop by here to bask in the poopiness, but if you're actually looking for delicious dessert, you should really try elsewhere. PS- cash only, and you can put your tips in the tip jar."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. We ordered an hour ago and are still waiting for our food. When we asked the server for an ETA, they didn't have our order on record. We were then told that they sold out of the things we ordered and we had to change our orders... Don't know if the food is any good yet because we didn't get any yet."}
{"text":"I'm sorry for being so harsh but this place is literally \"Crap\"
Upon walking in, your initial reaction is quite pleasant. But soon after the novelty wares off you soon realize that your about to completely waste your hard earned money.
Firstly, I went to the washroom and it was exactly what you imagine when you think Poop Cafe because it smelled of dried pungent urine. Furthermore there was used tissue papers everywhere and on top of everything there were multiple flies. I would have taken a picture but honestly I wanted to gtfo of there asap.

The food was also disappointing... I got the matcha bingsu. My friend beside me also got the same thing. His came with the matcha pockey sticks but mine were no where to be found. They also put some type of black bean paste which was really salty (maybe expired) and it wasn't even in the description...

Lastly they spent 10 minutes looking for our bill which they lost and had to recalculate our bill. To be honest me and my friends wanted to leave without paying but that does solve anything."}
{"text":"Very very cute interior! I wish the seating area was a bit bigger and the toilet seats were more comfortable. Deserts are on the pricey side but it's pretty decent. Service is kinda slow and there are MANY people there waiting in line."}
{"text":"Felt a little silly coming here after lunch but I've wanted to try it since it opened. We ordered the Vietnamese coffee and green tea. The coffee had no flavour and it was way too sweet - think of an instant coffee that is diluted with sugar water. We also asked for a black coffee... the green tea was good but you can't really screw up tea. For dessert, we tried the poop shaped bun with Nutella inside - this was actually pretty good!"}
{"text":"I am surprised by the negative reviews - I have no complaints! I wandered in with my brother while visiting Toronto and we found the place funny (cheeky, if you will), and super cute. I was surprised and impressed by the amount of vegan/dairy-free options they had, and really enjoyed my grey vanilla coconut 'ice-cream'! Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"The shop, decor and furniture are really cute. You will enjoy being able to visit for it is very unique. Lots of choices for desert. I ordered macha bingsu snd oreo bingsu and find both very sweet. I was excited to see they have poop waffle but it came out disappointing. Just the waffle bread with nutella spread on top unlike what is shown on the menu."}
{"text":"Me and my friends wanted desserts so we gave this place a try. The interior was cute and all, but very small place with limited seats. 

When we were seated, I ordered within 5 mins but it took about 45 mins for our desserts to come. I specifically asked for no almonds due to allergies and after 45 mins wait, my dessert came with bits and pieces of almonds. Very disappointed. I just picked out the almonds because I didn't want to wait another 45 mins for a replacement. Didn't enjoy the dessert at all and didn't even finish it. Extremely disappointed"}
{"text":"I think that many of the reviewers here are cute poo themed dessert restaurant connoisseurs, but I am not, so in my naïveté I will comment that this place was very fun and yummy. Kids are very excited to come here too. It was busy because the cute poo is clearly a fad right now, but my daughter and I waited about 15 minutes after being told 20, which wasn't too bad for being seated on an actual toilet which probably in itself cost a few hundred bucks at least. Desert is supposed to be fun, right? I tried the coconut bingsu and loved every bite. I guess there is cheaper ice cream but is seriously that the reason you are visiting an excrement themed restaurant? The smiles on my daughter's face were worth the 8.50, the servers were really nice and they had a card machine so it wasn't hard to pay at all when I asked for my cheque. Whatever guys, don't take things so seriously!"}
{"text":"Took some coworkers here for a catch up. There was a large party (16+ people) who had taken up the whole back end of the place (no tables or chairs for hardly anyone else) and were letting their children run wild and into both staff and other customers. This isn't the cafes fault, but it's super annoying. They had ordered so much food that the two people making everything took literally hours to give me a waffle with a single scoop of ice cream and mini marshmallows because they were so backed up and understaffed.

My coworkers got green tea ice cream in a bathtub, which arrived almost immediately as it was just ice cream. There was a couple beside us on a date who arrived around the same time we did. They left after an hour of nothing, cancelling their order on the way out.

We never got our drinks, or even refills on our water. It comes in a urinal which is hilarious, but only gives you about half a cup of water, if that. No one asked us about refills or took our cups, etc.

I watched another small family get someone else's order, to which their child put his fingers in the topping on the ice cream and ate some of the cornflakes and THEN the parents said they didn't order that for him-- so the employee grabbed it and gave it to the bigger party because it was for them instead. Didn't check it nor did the family mention their kid already ate some and touched it? Like he touched the actual ice cream. So gross.

We went there at 6:30 and left around 9:20...then went to Tim Hortons to get sandwiches because we were still hungry.

There was one waiter and two people making the food. The people making the food were also cashiers to the people downstairs buying novelty toilet and poop items they have for sale. A man who I think was the owner came in and out frequently during our wait to be seated. Myself, two friends and at least 5 other people were all crammed downstairs around the food/cash area and at one point we were all just standing in the front window display because that's all the space that was available.

The food I had was great, but not worth the wait. This place is too small and super understaffed. The furniture and counter spaces are too big for the space and it feels very cramped. The walls are also chalkboard with drawings all over them, which is cute, but you can't lean back when you sit down on the bench, and you can't touch the wall while you wait.

Only go if you have a small party, and a lot of patience and time to kill. Won't be going out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Had a poopy experience and poop cafe. They took our down down, yet let 3 groups ahead of us who came after. Sat down and there was no server for a long time. Best part, is we came for the HK waffle. After informing us they ran out of avocado they also mentioned their HK waffle maker burned out!! Maybe a bad night but wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Worst dessert place so far. Decor was the only thing that was nice. Service was slow. There was no music. The waffle on my ice cream was almost burnt and hard to eat. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"It's a nice plate to hang out due to the novelty and the washroom-theme concept. However service was lackluster, food was average. I ordered the mango bingsu it lacked the different layers of chopped fruits/condensed milk/fruit syrups and other toppings. The bingsu was also too icy, not enjoyable at all."}
{"text":"Came at around 7pm and the service was a mess. Wrote name down and number of people in party on a list and they'll call us when our table is ready in about 1-2 hours. There wasn't any place to sit so naturally, we walked around ktown to kill some time and when we came back after an hour, turns out that they already called our name and we had to wait another 20 minutes for a table to free up. Would've been better to write down our phone number to call us when the table is ready.

Got seated and we waited about 10 minutes to get our water (which had a greasy film on top of the liquid)  and 40 minutes to get our food with dirty spoons. We all ordered a Hong Kong waffle w/ ice cream and 2 toppings. By the time we got our food we were tired and hangry. Finished the food at around 10pm. Was the Hong Kong waffle worth the 2 hour wait? Absolutely not, it was very mediocre. You're much better off ordering takeout or getting hk waffles from dragon city mall, the whole experience of the cafe is not worth the wait or the hype

My advice? Go around the morning on a weekday. Or just don't go at all."}
{"text":"Poop cafe is a place you'd come to once and never again. Nothing wrong with it.. but there are plenty of dessert places that are cheaper and better. There were some items on the menu that were unavailable. 
And what I ordered was very average."}
{"text":"I'd heard that the Poop Café had opened ... interesting name!  I was in the area this afternoon so stopped in to check it out.

Water is served in a urinal glass.

I wasn't sure what they served and discovered it is a toilet-themed dessert bar.  I ordered a Thai ice cream roll.  You choose an ice cream flavour and then two toppings.  I got strawberry ice cream with M&Ms and marshmallows.  It was a fun tasty dessert and was served in a bathtub.  I've never had rolled ice cream before and it was good ... flavourful and a bit crunchy.  I'd go back.

The servers were friendly and service was quick."}
{"text":"Dont come here during the weekend at night time, it gets extremely busy and the service is terrible and disorganized. 

The concept of the café is cute and funny but definitely not worth all the hype it's receiving. 

The utensils given to us were dirty we had to clean it ourselves, constantly bugging the waitress about our order (which took almost 40 mins to arrive), they ignored us a couple times, they gave our order to a different table and simply just terrible service. I dont recommend anyone to go there, its nothing special. I mean, the ice cream and waffle was alright but not worth the 1-2 hour wait for a seat."}
{"text":"More like 2.5 stars. This exceptionally awkward cafe has eccentric utensils and seats that make your experience a memorable one. Perfect for taking pictures, but food wise, there was nothing special or good about it. Good for a one time experience, but definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Been wanting to visit this place since it opened. But there was always something that prevented me from coming whether it be the long lines or my friends not wanting to come because it's unappetizing to eat and drink from toilet bowls and urinals. Finally had the time to get around to visiting this dessert shop. 

First let's start off with the entrance. The place seemed very unorganized and the people were not too friendly. When we first entered no one greeted us even though they knew we were standing at the door. We did not know what was going on. However, when a group of white people entered they were greeted and were told that there was a signup sheet. Like rude.. are you not supposed to inform us.. Things started off pretty bad already.      

Once we were seated they brought water and menus pretty quick. But they never gave us any tissue at all. The menu offers a variety of Korean bingsu, Thai rolled ice cream, Taiwanese shaved ice, milkshakes and etc. All priced around $8-10

The desserts are decently priced I guess. Not that cheap but not too expensive. As for the quality of dessert. It was blah. Not recommended. We got the matcha bingsu and the strawberry bingsu ($9.50). Presentation was nice. The matcha ice cream on the matcha bingsu was ok. Pretty good. It was topped with cornflakes and pocky. Felt like there was too much cornflakes which kinda killed the taste of the bingsu. As for the strawberry one, the strawberries on top were fresh but sour. The ice cream on top was bad. I believe it was supposed to be vanilla but for some reason it tasted like a subtle mint flavour. Did not like this and it did not complement the dessert well. As for the bingsu (Korean snow ice) at the bottom of the toilet bowl. The bingsu was too icy. It was not fine enough and you are able to taste all the ice bits. Felt like it was poorly made compared to other places that serves Korean bingsu. Not authentic. It's supposed to be fluffy and taste like snow and melt easily in your mouth. But this one did not. Moreover, the desserts were missing like half the stuff mentioned on the menu. The strawberry one was missing cornflakes, and condensed milk. The matcha one was missing almonds and honey bear cookies. I feel like they shouldn't advertise for that many items in the dessert if they are not able to make it accordingly. Extremely disappointing. They should reduce their menu and specialize in a few different desserts rather than try to cover everything. This way the quality of the desserts would be better.

As for cleanliness. This place rates pretty low. The place isn't really dirty environment wise but their utensils...bowls and spoons are not clean. The spoons were left in a box next to the table and there was dirty spoons that have stuff stuck on them or they were sticky. There was also crumbs inside the box... gross 


When they brought the desserts the bowls were sticky and wet. There would be a trail of ice cream when you move the desserts . There was also dried chocolate on my toilet bowl even though my dessert doesn't have chocolate of any kind in it. It was really noticeable because my bowl was white. I'm very concerned with the sanitation of this dessert shop as their items are so poorly cleaned. Wonder how clean their kitchen would be then.. 

Additionally, there was chocolate smudge on the lights switch in the washroom. 

As for the interior is nicely decorated with the pooped theme decor. Everything related to the theme. Some of the seats are toilets whereas others are benches. The dining area is located on an upper floor. It's not wheelchair friendly. People with wheelchairs will have difficulty getting up the stairs and dining here. The washroom is located on the upper floor. There's no hot water running in the sinks only cold water. 
Which is weird..

Overall, not worth the hype. Not worth your money. Poor quality of dessert and unsanitary dishes and utensils. Probably one of the worst dessert places I've been to."}
{"text":"I was really not looking forward to this place. Simply because it would be just another dessert place to spend my money and forget all the effort I put into working out. 

Anyways my friends and I came here on a Sunday 5ish and we were told 15 minutes. Ended up getting seat in 5. I guess that's a bonus. 

Water comes in the form of a urinal. And because it's tap water, I joked that it tasted like toilet water (not that I know what toilet water tastes like) 

There bubble tea isn't exactly bbt. It's like a latte and you have the option of hot or cold. I got cold which is basically hot with ice that waters it down which is also a bonus because it's sweet as all hell. That comes in a toilet bowl. How exciting! (Sarcasm) 

The poop thing with nutella was yummy and soft. Like a two bite brownie. Noth no special to be honest. 

Honestly, this place is only fun if you have good company. Otherwise it's not worth it. I may bring people here to just get the hype and try it out but for the price and items, not really worth if"}
{"text":"Came here earlier this afternoon and was extremely disappointed. Nice concept, but when your service is 'poop', it doesn't really matter how pretty or cute it is inside. I ordered a parfait, which came after a short wait, but a friend and I also ordered a Vietnamese coffee and after waiting, waiting, waiting, asking to cancel, told that it was coming multiple times, waitng more, we finally got up to pay 50 minutes later. I had somewhere to go and couldn't wait any longer, but as we were paying we saw someone rushing to make our drinks. We ended up getting our drinks to go and received the worst Vietnamese coffee we have ever tasted. I know that this is a new place, but until they get things sorted out, I would avoid it! Also, bring cash because they do not accept cards at the moment."}
{"text":"I have to hand it to the owners, they are very committed to the poop and bathroom theme.
Urinal water glasses
Toilet bowl bowls
Bing-poo
Doo doo waffle
Facts about poop on the wall
Poop emoji pillows everywhere 
Sitting on actual toilets
Toilet painted benches
The list goes on. It was fun seeing all these theme related things.
Would I come back? Was the food amassing? Prob not and not really, but it was a good tourist experience!

I had good and fast service unlike reviews below."}
{"text":"Cute cafe, they didn't have a lot of the stuff on the menu, told us it was sold out, everything was too sweet except the rolled ice creams"}
{"text":"Situated in the heart of Korea-town, the Poop Cafe is the perfect stop for tourists (like myself) and locals craving dessert and wanting to spice things up! The cafe takes a fun and playful twist on poop and other bathroom-related items (i.e. the water cups were urinals and the seats were toilet seats with cushions). We had arrived around 2 PM on a Friday and were immediately seated. After about 15 min, the place started filling up.

1) Doo-doo waffle. The perfect snack size (a little smaller than my hand) yet so filling! I tried the custard and red-bean filling. It's crispy and rich; I just wish there could have been more filling though!

2) Served in a cute toilet bowl, the avocado gelato was sweet, refreshing, and kind of creamy."}
{"text":"Super cute and good ice creams/desserts! I loved the concept. The service was surprisingly spectacular!"}
{"text":"Cafe decor and concept was nice. Portion was a bit too small for its price. Taste wasn't as good as expected - 4/10. They got our order wrong but service was friendly, so we just let it go."}
{"text":"After seeing so many pictures of the Poop Cafe on social media, I decided to make a visit with my friends and let's just say, the name held true... The Poop Cafe was actually \"Poop\". I was quite disappointed with the Poop Cafe as I had high expectations. 

To start off, the Poop Cafe is quite small in size and the decor was very cute. They had toilets for chairs and even served desserts and drinks in toilets and urinals. My friends and I ordered the Oreo Bingsu and the Avocado Ice cream with a random assortment of recommended toppings from our waiter. Let me start off with the Oreo Bingsu. In a normal \"bingsu\", they usually put toppings over shaved ice and bam. I found it very weird that the Poop Cafe's Oreo Bingsu was over shaved coconut instead of ice. Not sure who thought Oreos and coconuts go well together, but let me just say, we didn't even finish half of it. Also, the avocado ice cream had parts where it tasted fine, but others where it tasted rotten kind of. 

Overall, I will definitely say the desserts looks better than it actually tastes. Don't waste your money here even if you are tempted by pictures you see online."}
{"text":"Awesome place  fun with friends .. the place is quite small and compact but the service is great. The food is amazing. Do not go for \"dinner\" as it is a place for snacks, so a milkshake and side snack will definitely not be enough for dinner. There are vegan options .. and they taste soooo good! It's also a really good spot for insta pics"}
{"text":"So apparently, the staff told us that it'll take 30mins to get inside. However, it took us 2 1/2 hours to wait. I'm super disappointed as we were hungry that time. If you have patience to wait, you can go try it. But if not, just eat better healthy food."}
{"text":"Cool concept, cute items, love the theme, but not that great. Definitely something to experience once in Toronto, and the concept is really cute including ice cream served in toilets, the aesthetics/interiors, and the treats designed around the theme. For the price, the food isn't anything amazing and you're obviously paying for the experience, but the decor can only make up for so much. I'm definitely glad I tried it out, but the service was quite on the slower side. I spent about an hour or so there just for ordering an ice cream. Overall, this cafe is something to try, but I probably won't go back there again."}
{"text":"The interior of the place and how they present the food and the drinks is extremely cute. People shouldn't be overly surprised that the food/drinks and service are only ok and slightly pricy. You go once for the experience and just to say you've been. Limited seats, but that's to be expected as well, you don't need a giant place dedicated to a poop cafe as this isn't something you need to go to often. It was cute and something to try once if you wanted something unique."}
{"text":"Rarely would I want to give a low rate. The idea of a \"Poop\" cafe was very catchy I'd give them that but the food needs a lot more improvement . It's not downright bad , it's edible but your better off eating dessert and drinking coffee at home . Your paying more for the novelty , tour and perhaps even the \"prop and setting\" of your instagram worthy photos . The place definitely showcases the owner/s' creativity in coming up with a theme that markets itself  but that's all there is to it. First time I saw Urinals for a glass of water though ."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday morning. Ordered the Nutella bingsu (?) which is one of the toilet bowl dishes and it's a definite hit. The cafe is poop themed. The seats are toilets, the cups are urinals and the walls are drawn in all sorts of poop themed art. Dessert is good on it's own so worth the trip for the ambiance ;)  it's cash only for now"}
{"text":"While unique and super cute, the dessert was mediocre and slightly overpriced. You can get a plain scoop of gelato for $3, which is nice if you want to order something for the experience of eating out of a toilet. 
However, the most disappointing thing about this place was the service. They served us a dessert that was $10 that we didn't order. When we tried to send it back, they pretty much said \"well, we made it, so maybe just take it to go?\" We had to ask 3 servers before someone took it off our check. On top of that, service was EXTREMELY slow. To order dessert, eat and get our checks it took close to an hour and a half.
While it is a fun treat for a unique atmosphere, I wouldn't suggest this for a really outstanding tasting dessert. If you are planning on coming here, make sure you aren't in a hurry! 
There isn't any air conditioning either, so be prepared to sweat!"}
{"text":"Service is slow, the dishes and glasses we were served with were clearly only power rinsed and were still dirty, and the actual food quality is abysmal. I'm not sure how you can get dessert so wrong. But the \"poop theme\" will continue to hold this cafe up on 4 legs.

Kudos to the business owner for the excellent novelty poop theme, attracting all us sheeple so desperate to throw our money away. Fun to say I visited, but will never be back."}
{"text":"It's majorly hot in this place! Hot as in temperature wise, they need to turn on the AC! The interior is pretty cute and creative. I also love the chairs, very impressive seat covers. 

I arrived here around 5:30PM, and there were so many people waiting. A lot of people before us were getting upset cause they said they have been waiting for an hour. My bf and I waited for 40 minutes at least to sit. It's finally our turn and we already knew what we were going to order. We got two bingsoo's, one mango and one oreo. The guy said we're quick and he's very happy that we were :). Anyways, 
Mango bingsoo - lots of mango bits! Some were very bitter but it's an even amount of sour and sweet. Comes with coconut ice cream, but I would prefer if they gave us an option of having another ice cream flavor. In the beginning it tasted weird, but later on it's just ok since the ice cream melted into the shaved ice.
Oreo bingsoo - whooo GREAT TASTE! I highly recommend this one. All I can say is this was yummy! You can never go wrong with vanilla ice cream and oreo though. I also really liked how they put cornflakes in both bingsoos. 

Overall: I'd say to just try this place once. Wouldn't really go back for desserts."}
{"text":"Welp.... It was poopy alright. Aside from the funny poop themed cups, etc, the food is trash and they give you a bucket of hot chocolate, i dont know how they expect you to finish it. Not very tasty, but worth the visit i guess"}
{"text":"Perfect for kids! After hearing several not so great reviews from parents but happy reviews from kids, I finally took my 4 year old on an afternoon date to Poop Café. When we arrived there were no tables available so we waited in the entrance area. We took photos with all the photo-op areas (welcome wall, poop Xmas tree etc) and by then we had a table available. 

I think the key thing is to order off menu - I saw all the crazy jumbled assemblages coming out and knew there was no way my kid would eat all that (way too much sugar!) and it would be a waste of $$. I got her chocolate ice cream with no extra toppings in the toilet bowl and a plain HK waffle for us to share. It was perfect amount! I had the sesame matcha latte - probably wouldn't order that again- I like sesame so it was ok but not my favourite. Would stick to regular tea next time. 

Service-
Was friendly but it took quite a long time for our simple order. So keeping in mind this is a place of leisure- not a rush in and out place. 
I would recommend as long as you have low expectations on the service pace!"}
{"text":"You really only come here because it's fun and intriguing. I actually found it gross to drink water out of a urinal cup and the desserts were only okay. It's really just a one time thing..."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place is so hated by people that its cumulative rating is 2 stars. It's definitely not a 5-star place, nor is it necessarily a 4-star dessert place, but 2 stars? C'mon. IMHO, it's definitely worthy of at least 3 stars.

All the desserts are over the top and really sweet. Yeah, yeah, you get the usual reactions from people to everything being poop-themed, with poop jokes and stuff. I think it's cool that we have a poop-themed cafe. It's all the range in Asian countries, so why not in Toronto? I think it's cool and novel. Personally, I found their seats made from recycled toilets very comfortable. A lot more comfortable than most old-fashioned seats in restaurants.

I liked their Vietnamese tea. It strikes a nice balance between sweetness and bitterness. The Japanese milk tea was way too sweet IMO.

The desserts are pretty much all way too sweet for my taste, so I would not be coming back. However, a lot of people with a sweet tooth will love this place.

On a somewhat unrelated note, I think they waste a lot of space in that little area right where the entrance is. They have a giant poop surrounded by some kind of a fence. Weird and a total waste of space.

I say, don't listen to the naysayers and 2-star reviews. Go there. Check it out for yourself and make up your own mind on whether you like the place or not."}
{"text":"This place was very cute and definitely a must visit if you're into the novelty cafes. Or into poop. Wall art, giant poop statues, toilet seats, etc. Butt...it was ridiculous hot in there. It was a little amplified because we visited during the heat wave, butt based on the other reviewers, it's always been like this. I did want to get a giant dessert, butt I didn't feel like I had the stomach for it. My friend and I shared the affogato which was fitting with the theme and came in a toilet bowl. The service was sub par. We had to wait to be seated, butt they didn't look majorly busy. The table seated after us got their order in first. They gave us tiny water cups and didn't come back to check on us. We went to the front to pay, butt it turned out we were supposed to pay our server. Overall, I'm glad for the experience, but likely would not return again."}
{"text":"Just went cause its called a poop cafe. The aesthetic is cute and all but the food fulfills the name of the cafe, poop. I got the matcha bingshu and the presentation and plate was cool, but I think the use of porcelain, the same as toilets gave my food a very toilet water taste which wasn't good. 
All in all cute place but not really good food."}
{"text":"I hate having mixed reviews on this place, because it could seriously be a gold mine if it was done right. 

We walked to the cafe at 11:00 am on a Sunday (when they opened) with people waiting outside, since they hadn't even opened yet... so that took a couple minutes, since she had just turned on the lights. The front of the cafe looked like a mess, with poop stuff to buy (maybe? I couldn't even tell) thrown all over the place. 

The atmosphere was pretty cute - the seats are toilets, everything is served in a toilet bowl, and there are tons of things on the walls. Enough to think it was funny! 

Our waitress COULD NOT understand us... we weren't expecting that, and could not communicate other than what was on the menu. 

It took us 30 minutes alone to get our check, and that's only because another worker - who was not there to open - finally came in to help and could talk to us. 

Honestly, we went to get something for my nieces, and walked away with barely T-shirts - we couldn't find anything else to buy them. It took forever and was super unorganized. It's cute because the food is good, and the atmosphere is funny, but we questioned whether it was even worth it."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not the hype it created. It looks all cute and unique. The menu is very confusing. They gave us 2 menus which had the same items. The portions were very small compared to the pictures shown. We ordered the hong Kong waffle with ice cream and the Oreo bingsu. There is a lot of room for improvement and could do so much better with what they have."}
{"text":"Upon entry we were told to seat ourselves. Immediately, I was annoyed when I saw you needed to purchase a minimum of $10.00 in order to use our debit card. What the hell is that?

It took the server 15 minutes to come see us because he was texting  on his cellphone. I asked if they had coffee and he told me yes that it's right on the menu. He flipped over the menu, the menu was so worn that you couldn't see it. Like as if I was dumb because I couldn't see it. 

We ordered the coffee to start and again had to flag a server when we were ready to order food. The next server to come to us was female and when we told her we were ready to order she walked away and didn't come back. 

We quickly sipped our coffees down and went to leave. The server yelled at us to tell us that we pay upstairs before we leave. I was like \" I'm glad someone wants to talk to us now when it's time to pay.\" 

When I asked why they had the rule of $10 dollars for debit, the girl did not answer me. We walked out and we were told to have a nice day at least. 

To sum everything up. I was ready to leave as soon as I flipped over the menu. The coffee selection is slim to none and the service is super bad. 

I was so excited to try this place and was so displeased. Such a great ideas gone to waste.."}
{"text":"The Poop Café is just a novelty restaurant, but the food is nothing special for the price. My friends and I have been wanting to go here, but there's always a line. We finally managed to come at a decent time and found the place was pretty small - there's seating for about 20 people at a time, which explains the long lines. 

The menus are confusing - you get two different sets with different information in terms of flavours and availability. After trying to order a couple seasonal flavors that they no longer carried, I settled for the waffle cone with pistachio gelato. The waffles were hard and not the soft and fluffy egg waffles I'm use to, but the gelato was good. I tried my some other desserts that my friends got, but everything was pretty average.

It was nice to try once, but one experience is all you really need."}
{"text":"A+ for their concept. The second our cab drove past this place I knew we'd be returning to check it out. It's claim to fame is \"Toronto's first toilet themed dessert bar\" but lets be honest, it will likely be Toronto's only toilet themed eating establishment. I was hesitant about the quality of the food, thought it was more of a themed place that wouldn't deliver. Boy was I wrong. The desserts were the shit! (Pun intended ;) 

I enjoyed their dedication to the theme, upon walking upstairs to the seating area we were intrigued to see that we would be sitting on maroon toilets while we enjoyed our food. The rest of the cafe has a cozy feel, with IKEA furniture, and chalkboard paint on the walls with cute drawings. The ice cream I ordered was served in a toilet bowl, and was one of the best ice cream desserts I've ever had. 

I commend the commitment this establishment makes to their theme. A few things to note though, they only take cash so make sure to bring some. Secondly, they don't offer take out so you'll have to wait if it's busy. This place is very new so I am sure they will work the kinks out over time, I just hope it doesn't lose its novelty too quickly because the quality of desserts really is very good."}
{"text":"Nothing special. I was looking forward to this place but again it's overrated. It seemed very unorganized and a lot of angry customers"}
{"text":"I came around 9.40pm on friday to get a takeout, there was no cash only sign so I wasn't aware until later. people everywhere, noone acknowledged me, no clear line. I waited 10min without being spoken to until I asked where to order, I was able to order 5mins later and then I had to walk one station to my bank ATM and back while they prepared my ice cream which was great but there was still empty space left in cup, I saw other ppl get bigger portion. anyway 4 for food (quantity) and 1 for the rest!"}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place! There was a lot of backlash about the theme of this cafe ever since it was announced, but I think that was really petty of people to be harassing the owner. I thought the idea of a poop cafe was interesting because while it may be more common in Asia, it's really the first of its kind here. I had originally thought it would be more like a restaurant, it ended up being a dessert cafe. 

The pros of this place is that it really is toilet themed. You sit on top of toilets, you drink out of urinal shaped cups, you eat from toilet bowls. The walls are covered in little poop pictures and jokes. The bar where they make the food is a toilet bowl and the light fixtures are plungers. It's just cute allover when it comes to the theme.

Alas, the cons of this place are the prices. It really is overpriced for what they're selling. I wouldn't mind so much if the portions were bigger, but you have a waffle the size of my palm (and I have small hands) for three dollars. The matcha bingsu I ordered was around $8.50 but it wasn't that great either. The menu said gelato but it was ice cream (though there was mochi so that was a pleasant surprise). It was my first time having bingsu, and it was a little disappointing. 

Service is a bit scattered, but that might also be because the food is on one level while all the seating is on another. Servers are trying to run around but the place is a little cramped (I hit my head on a light three times). They are friendly though, so I will give them that.

Overall, I just wasn't impressed with this place. It's cute, but it's not worth the money or journey to come. It is still in its first few months, so I wish the owner all the best and hope that it improves by my next visit (if I come b"}
{"text":"I have to admit, the poop cafe was appealing and I fell for that gimmick. When you walk in, you'll see cute poop emoji's and artwork everywhere. Social media worthy. The seats are actual toilet seats, and the food comes out with everything in relations to your bowel movement. Their customer service was great, decor was pooptastic. My only complaint, is their food. Everything was not so great, from the vietnamese coffee to the bingsoo. The only thing I liked here was their egg puff and that was it. I probably won't come back here, but it was good just for the experience."}
{"text":"The concept from brought over from Asia. Neat cups and plates to serve the food items on. Drinking Vietnamese coffee in a toliet bowl cup makes a nice pic for the gram. The music was extremely loud, playing pure trap (future, migos) music. Seating is pretty limited as people often come in big groups. Overall, this is a joint where you take a out-of-towner too so that you can have something to talk about (\"remember that one time we went to that poop cafe?\")."}
{"text":"Waited a long time to get served but this place is always crowded with people! Although the long wait the waiter was very friendly and apologetic. I ordered a Hong Kong waffle with vanilla ice cream Nutella and strawberries it was sooo good"}
{"text":"Its fun! We ordered Oreo Toilet paper roll, match latte  and unicorn Hong Kong waffle. Everything was delicious. I loved the waffle itself with the melted icecream on it. All decor and plates/cups/lights are toilet themed. Kids had a good laugh and enjoyed the icecream."}
{"text":"Yikes, the hype is real, but the food is utter crap. But puns aside, it really isn't much asides the hype. The deco for drinks come in assorted bathroom items (toilet, urinal, bath tub), and hilariously enough, the drinks play the part perfectly in both appeal and taste. 

Coming from a rather heavy lunch, I ordered the red Thai milk tea, cold. It came to me grossly lukewarm and the colour of the drink made it even less appealing to my tastebuds. I mean, it is the POOP CAFE so I'd assume that's what they were aiming for but dang, would've been nice if the food was at least decent. We're paying $5.5 for a small cup of sugar heavy, lukewarm, with undercooked tapioca drink that I could've gotten better at say last minute Foody deals. 

My friend who got the thai ice cream said it was rather pleasant, however. The one bonus is how much there was compared to other Thai ice cream places, but lacklustre for those returning. It's good but it's not good enough for me to think of this place just to come for their ice cream. 

I can't say I was a fan of the gelato and waffles either. Waffles was so meh, and gelato melted way too quickly. 

Service was underwhelming too, she was nice but she looked like she wasn't sure of a lot of things when we asked or talked to her. It was also slow af getting our orders, especially considering how the cafe was completely empty when we were there. 

I suspect the hype will die down soon considering how mediocre the food is."}
{"text":"I had such a great time previously that i decided to bring my other friends back.  While i still enjoyed my time there, my poor friend got hit on his head by the lighting that dangled low near where he was sitting.  Perhaps there needs to be a rearrangement of table placements.  Also my friend ordered a waffle dessert that took a long time to get to him.  We were half way done with our bingsu already."}
{"text":"This place spot opened up late last year which generated a lot of buzz featuring various Asian-oriented desserts in a washroom-themed restaurant. Everything from being seated on a toilet, dining out of tiny toilet bowls, and drinking out of urinal-shaped cups really adds a sense of humour to the experience. It's a fun place to check out with a group of friends for the novelty, but don't expect to be blown away by their menu items."}
{"text":"Since this is the first poop cafe in North America (I think) I definitely had to check it out. If you think bathroom humour is funny then you'd enjoy this cafe. We arrived a bit after 1 pm on Sunday and were glad there wasn't a wait. Once we were seated that's when people had to start waiting for a table.

The tables only have toilets on one side and the other is a bench. My fiancé and I chose to sit on the toilets and the other couple had the bench. The toilets were not comfortable at all! I thought there would be padding on the toilet lid. It was quite uncomfortable that I stood up a few times. 

We all ordered a variety of bingsu's and also an Oreo milkshake. Not all of the bingsu's were in toilet bowls. I'm not sure if they don't have enough toilet bowls but they also served them in bowls that looked like a bathtub. The bingsu's were delicious though! The shaved ice tasted like milk and it went really well with the corn flakes. My friend wanted to order the poop waffle but the machine wasn't working. 

I still see a lot of poop opportunities they can use to make their cafe more shitty. For example, instead of tissue they could replace it with toilet paper. The desserts aren't really poop themed. 

I wouldn't mind going back but it is a bit of a drive."}
