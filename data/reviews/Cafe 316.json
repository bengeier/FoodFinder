{"text":"The owner/chef of Cafe 316 is so nice! He takes pride in the quality of the food he serves and I can see why! It is delicious!   I had a turkey wrap and it was the tastiest wrap I have probably ever eaten. The best part too is that it's also healthy! I will definitely be visiting Cafe 316 quite often!"}
{"text":"Amen to this perfect cafe in downtown Las Vegas.  Cafe 316 is amazingly located in a nice area in the heart of Las Vegas.  The name is what is most attractive.  Cafe 316 was named after the address 316 and also John 3:16 making it the main reason to go here.  It will be a blessed experience for you and your friends.  I'm happy to share my knowledge about Cafe 316 with anyone... Thanks for being the best!"}
{"text":"I feel bad about this, but not that bad.    I ordered The Deli. A pastrami sandwich with spicy mustard and a pickle on a French bread hogie roll. I asked for The Deli with Swiss cheese.   What I got was a dry bread roll that tasted of cardboard, a slice of Swiss cheese and a pile of \"pastrami\".  That's it. Really. Not even mustard, much less spicy mustard.  The meat tasted like it used to be pastrami but all remnants of spice or flavor had been boiled out of it. What was left was an unidentifiable \"meat\" that tasted like a day old glass of water... Seriously, dusty water, if you can imagine it.   This sucks because I'd really like to see this place do well. It's in a location that has seen more than its fair share of occupants. They've done a good job rehabbing the place and the sandwich special was only $8 including a bag of chips and a drink. I hope they get their game together and turn this place around."}
{"text":"I only had a cappuccino from here so I can't go on for very long about it. It was a pretty darn good cappuccino though. The ratio of milk to coffee, and the amount of time hearing the milk, are arts that they have done well in."}
{"text":"The food was great and so was the service. I had a turkey wrap, soup of the day - minestrone, and an avocado smoothy. Daniel waited on me and recommended the smoothy which was creamy & tasted great. His dad made the wrap and both were easy to talk with. The place is newly open and I will definitely return anytime I'm in Vegas. They are opening early starting this week with bagels from the east coast. Can't wait to try. You won't be disappointed eating here."}
{"text":"Awesome smoothies with real and healthy ingredients! Kale, spinach, and avocado made my morning and surprisingly unlike other places didn't break the bank."}
{"text":"Cafe 316 is now called Ameribrunch. 3/19/16. I have not tried their food. I was looking for Cafe 316 which had sub sandwiches."}
{"text":"The people were very nice, but the food was not good. Ordered a Philly cheese sandwich and it was tasteless.  I drenched it with ketchup just to be able to taste anything. The bread tasted old, and it was very thick.  The meat had shiny spots on it, not sure if it was old meat. The \"cheese\" was not even cheesy, just melted dry product. I hope they step up their game. Would give them another chance, if I can ever name myself go back."}
