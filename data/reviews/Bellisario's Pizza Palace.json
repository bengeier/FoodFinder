{"text":"We order pizza from here all the time and it is always great.  Consistent each order.  We just had a white pizza w tomatoes...it was exceptional.  Bubbly crust, cheesy, and flavorful but not too greasy.  Also the staff is ALWAYS friendly and considerate....."}
{"text":"Our fav pizza spot in Pittsburgh! 1/2 butcher block & 1/2 veggie lovers is Awesome!

You get what you expect- Delicious PIZZA!  Toss salad is good with the pizza and the Calzones are great too!! MMMMM I'm getting hungry remembering it.   Look at the specialty pizzas on the back of the menu cause that's where it's at!!! 

Honestly, this place is mostly deliver and take out orders, the restaurant is not impressive and leaves much to be desired for ambiance.  10 old booths and lots of old sports memorabilia.  It seriously hasn't been updated since the first time I've been here, 18 years ago.  Don't expect an immaculately impressive bathroom, but you can find the only cloth roller towel I've EVER seen, straight from 1949.  

It's BYOB so bring some B or buy some from the store next door. 

 (I don't really understand the previous reviewer's complaint about greasiness, I've never had this issue.  But I probably would not buy a piece of cheesecake from here cause come on, it probably wasn't make fresh here and it it wasn't then what's the point of getting it??)

This is always a good choice for pizza!!"}
{"text":"I used to get delivery from this place fairly often and never had a problem until this one day when I called after waiting nearly 80 minutes with no pizza. I was told that the delivery driver had come to my apartment building, tried calling me on my phone, said nobody answered but then said he managed to get into my apartment building (someone was coming and/or going and let him in) and that he knocked on my actual apartment door. No answer so he left. That's crazy because I was home with my phone next to me. I never got a call nor heard knocking on my apartment door. They said they could send the pizza back out but by then it had been 80 minutes since I first called and I didn't want an old pizza. They didn't seem to believe me when I said I was home the whole time and it was all so strange I just said something like, \"I'm sorry then but I no longer want the pizza\" and hung up. I hoped it was a one off strange event since I never had a problem before and had ordered an average of every other week over a period of a year. So after a couple of months I decided to try them again. They remembered me and declined to deliver. When I told them that they had delivered successfully many, many times in the past and that I don't know what happened last time and that I was hoping \"we could get over that as just a one time oddity\" they basically hung up on me. I just can't figure it. One bad delivery experience after ordering many, many times and now they refuse because it's my fault somehow that one time? That seems like poor business to me."}
{"text":"Their food is good ., in desperate need of remodeling and is hit or miss when open .. They are closed sometimes at 9 pm on a Friday .. Very bizarre"}
{"text":"I like your pizza, sub sandwiches, but the best are the steak wedges and there Roast beef open sandwich with Home made grave and fresh French frys are Super Mmm... Great prices not like some pizza place who cost a lot more than these guys but don't taste as good. I will be coming back here for more.
Thank you , please ...!!!"}
{"text":"I recommend Bellisario's if you are looking for a good pizza shop out here in the South Hills area. They use a very tasty sauce that isn't too salty and the crust is light with the right consistency."}
{"text":"Place is still as great as ever. Wings are a must when ordering from them. Pizza, hoagies, sandwiches, calzones--in fact everything on the menu--is delicious. I live in Los Angeles now and miss this place terribly."}
{"text":"owner is a terrible terrible person. tossed me out for no good reason. i found the food very average overall"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this place since moving to Castle Shannon. Delivery was fast. The pizza was really REALLY greasy. My wife went to grab a piece and it was so saturated with grease everything fell off. Pizza is pizza, it wasn't terrible but wasn't notably better than any others I've had. We also got an order of 10 hot wings. They were also extremely  greasy and had zero flavor of any kind of sauce. Their texture was rubbery and they had a \"reheated\" taste to them. They were pretty terrible. We won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Something different. I don't order pizza but they have so many other choices. I love their chicken bacon pita wrap. Tonight I had a fish sandwich, HUGE! and big and flaky and properly cooked. Not greasy and breading thin and light! Their wings are amazing too! I like their fried califlower. Other apps are not that great tho. Onion rings and fries can be limp and soggy at times.Maybe okay on sight but we get delivery."}
{"text":"Best pizza we've found in the South Hills.  Not fancy but service was great (owner's daughter) and the pizza was just right.  Lots of toppings.  Good crust.  Definitely a place to go back to.  They also deliver in the general area.  You can bring you own beer and can get it next door if you want.  Only about ten tables but reminds me of an old local pizza place with good food, service, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I have tried all three crusts and the traditional is the best by far. Good sauce, nice thicker crust, bubbly and lite. Tried the steak wedgie and it was delicious! The only thing I would recommend is asking them to go light on the lettuce. Way too much for my taste, but it's a pizza crust wrapped around the meat and veggies, with no sauce. They also make delicious fresh cut fries. The large is more thank enough for 2 people. I can barely finish the small by myself.  Big portions , good prices, quick pick up and delivery."}
{"text":"recently ordered a couple pizzas from them after assuming they were just mediocre suburban pizza .  i was wrong .   it's dalish .   a unique crust texture/consistency and good pizza 'guts' .
the delivery time was reasonable considering i live on the outward fringe of their delivery area.   the driver was 'cool' and was able to communicate in native english (i'm really very tired of all the pizza joints owned by serbians/russians/middle-easterners who can't / hardly speak english...one has to admire their tenacity in making a life here but ....)
i will be a repeat customer of bellisario's ... hurray .   my new fave pizza joint in this area (outside of Fiori's)"}
{"text":"Boyfriend swears by this pizza and I agree that it's pretty good.  It delivers to our house in Brookline and usually gets here in 30 minutes.  No complaints"}
{"text":"The salads are very good! Pizza is cheap but good. Used to order delivery from here constantly when we lived nearby. Prices are reasonable and the guys are usually really friendly."}
{"text":"I have only ever had their wings so my review is limited to those.  However I have always been impressed by the quality and flavor of the different sauces.  Their wings are cooked perfectly, crispy outside and juicy inside.  My favorite flavor is probably the regular hot.  It is not over powering and has a great buffalo taste."}
{"text":"This is how pizza should be. Great ingredients, bubbly crust, not greasy, reasonably priced. 

I've lived in the north hills on and off, I can't believe I just found this gem. 

They also have a full menu: eat in or take out. The prices are unreal!
Will have to eat in soon to find out more."}
{"text":"First eat in visit after recently moving to the area. Really delicious pizza with a tasty, doughy crust (reheated well the next morning too). The waitress was super nice too. Will definitely be our go-to pizza joint!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently moved to the area and he spoke so highly of this place that we decided to order some for delivery. However, when we called we told the man over the phone that we lived off of Overbrook which was a mile away. He then proceeded to very rudely challenge that we lived that close because he had no idea where we were talking about. We then told him that from where he was located he simply had to turn left on 51 and then make the second right. He scoffed and said I'll be honest I have no idea where that is and we won't deliver there. Completely unprofessional and ridiculous. We will not go back or order."}
{"text":"This, could be the best pizza in South Hills, if they could only give it two more minutes in the oven. Slow down folks! Nobody wants blond crust. Let it cook- I dont mind waiting an extra minute."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza in Pittsburgh!! Great crust, lots of ingredients and not greasy! Consistently good every time! We've tried other local places, but none come close to Bellisario's!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!  I will never order from there again.  I was hungry for some pizza and found a Bellisario's menu in the back of my desk (I suppose from the girl who worked here before me) and decided to try them.  Got a pizza with pepperoni and a slice of cheesecake.  When the driver brought it, it looked like he sat on the pizza box. He opened the box up and said to me that the box got bent and the cheese and pepperoni was all stuck to the top of the box.  He asked me if it was ok and he said it was only one piece that was ruined.  When it was really 3 slices that the toppings were stuck to the top of the box.  What was I gonna say, I was hungry, so I took it.  The pizza was awful, greasy and just ehhhh i can't even explain it.  

So I had a slice of pizza and was done with that and moved on to the cheesecake, which looked like it was about a month old and tasted pretty bad as well.  Only had a bite of that and threw it away.  I will never order from there again!"}
{"text":"This was our second time eating the pizza from here. They are two doors Down from McNeilly Six Pack Shop. You can get food from here and take it to the six pack shop and eat it while you have a few beers. The pizza is in my top 5. The crust isn't too thick or too thin. They put more toppings on pizza than any other place that I know. But you have to have a good foundation to build on and hopefully not using toppings to cover a bad pizza. This pizza would be great even if it was just a plain cheese pizza. Now that I am hooked on their pizza I need to try other menu items."}
{"text":"If Vincent's pizza is a hellspawned ogre, Bellsario's pizza is a shining knight.

I was reminded of why this is tonight. It had been too long. 

Although, I think DeMino's in Brookline wins this duel of pies. There is a new champion in the South Hills Pizza Federation, but Bellsario's is still a worthy, worthy contender. 

Bellisario's has two other hoagies on their menu that I didn't mention in my first review; the Tuna Melt and the Steak Deluxe. Each is the best specimen of either breed of hoagie I've ever munched on. The Tuna is so creamy and full-bodied and oh-so filling that one half is a meal in itself. Make sure you have a beverage to wash it down with. And it's great if it's chilled and eaten the next day. The Steak Deluxe is the Bill Gates of steak hoagies because the meat is so generous you'll be wracked with guilt after eating it, as if you just grifted someone. They also don't skimp on the mushrooms, fried onions, peppers, cheese, or dressing. It doesn't fall to pieces either. The bread for both is just dead-on, especially for the Steak which they have to dip in juices of some kind since the inner surface of the bun is wet like a Philppe's torpedo. Man, I had totally forgotten what a dandy, superior Steak zep Bellisario's makes. The Subway down the road must be eviscerated!!!! HAHAHAHAHA!!! 

Wanna know why hoagies are sometimes called \"heros?\" Try these and you'll be up, up, and awaaayyyy and bustin' through brick walls!"}
{"text":"Bellisario's is one of my fave pizza shops.  As Darren claims, Bellisario's pizza is a shinning knight.\" 

If you are in the area and looking for a good pizza this is a good place to get your pizza.  The shop still has mucho sports figurines and sports memorabilia on the walls."}
{"text":"This is a perfect example of a really disgusting Pittsburgh style pizza, you guys love this awful crap for some reason.  

I called in and asked how big their medium was, the idiot responded with \"8 cuts\" which obviously tells me nothing considering you can cut anything into 8.  When I asked again he said 14 inches so I ordered a medium cheese and an order of breadsticks.  

I will confess that I didn't actually try the pizza because I had to send it back because it was well past the point of being edible.  It was like pizza soup in a crust bowl. 

This place is using deck style brick ovens, which is about the only thing they are doing right.  They do not cook directly on the brick though, they use pizza screens.  The screens that they use are the ones with the really big holes as opposed to the grid style screens that everyone else uses.  I have never seen another shop use the big hole screens, and probably for a reason because the dough was really really terrible cooked.  It was burned to the point of being black on the bottom at (which I usually don't mind at all) but somehow they managed for it to still be completely doughy and soft and not the least bit crispy.  Honestly it seems like some kind of miracle of science to have a black pizza bottom and for it to not at least be a little bit crispy.  The pizza was definitely on the overly thick and doughy side and even if it had been cooked well it probably still would have been too doughy to be very good.  The dough recipe may or may not have tasted good, no one will probably ever know because it will probably never be cooked evenly enough to even have a chance at tasting good. 

The biggest problem with the pizza overall was the 2 pounds of cheese sunken into a large gelatinous wad in the middle.  It smelled like decent cheese, probably Grande (although probably cut with something cheaper).  They are wasting so much money on cheese its sad.  Whoever the pizzaman was obviously took no pride in it whatsoever.  The sauce was all dropped into the middle with most of the cheese.  The edges of the pizza had big bubbles where all of the cheese and sauce should have been, but they were NOT the nice crispy kind of bubbles that could be enjoyed...just lumpy masses of sadness.  

I can't comment on the taste of the sauce because I am not a brave enough man to have put a slice of this DIY toilet clogging kit into my delicate stomachular system.  Fake words aside, this pizza really sucks guys. 

The icing on the cake were the breadsticks, a side item that I consider to be pretty un-f*ckable.  So for breadsticks, Mr. Bellesario (BTW, I hope that this is just some made-up Italian restaurant name and that someone doesn't actually put their family name behind this crap) just cuts up slices of the premade Sicilian dough and slaps some oil and herbs on it and calls it breadsticks.  Its the most ghetto attempt at this particular appetizer that I have ever heard of.  Its pretty funny, really. 


So yeah, this place is definitely worth avoiding at all costs especially considering the prices aren't even good and the restaurant itself is completely filthy inside.  The owner was nice enough about refunding the money for the pizza.  Its a shame when I see businesses like this that are set in their ways and are really wasting their potential with a general lack of pride."}
