{"text":"My family has gathered at Joes for years! The food and service never disappoints and the atmosphere is wonderful. We really love the new grass area outside! We met there for my mom's 50th, with a party of about 20 people  and enjoyed the outdoor seating area and letting he kids run and play in the grass. We will continue to come to joes as long as its here. I would say it is definitely a Gilbert landmark!!

Warning: it can get busy and there can be a line out the door but I assure you it's worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Part of my birthday trifecta! Delicious. Especially the cornbread and applesauce! They will give you $10 towards your meal on your birthday! It's been an annual tradition for years!"}
{"text":"Wanted to go out of my way and leave a review for one of your workers. I was told the young lady working name is Abbi. Abbi is a straight up ROCKSTAR!!! She went above and beyond here usual work duties this particular day and was very attentive towards a rather non exciting task to take care of. Through it all she did this with a smile while other co-workers seemed to watch and not offer any help."}
{"text":"This is the perfect Gilbert restaurant. Family friendly, quick cafeteria style service, the agricultural ambiance fits right in with Gilbert 's image as an historically agricultural community. The BBQ sauces ( one sweet, one hot) are to die for. The smoked and barbecued meats are wonderful. The only reason I can't give it five stars are the sides and desserts which just look tired. Lemon cake, which looked promising was dry, and the root beer cake was dense. Cheesy potatoes tasted good, but I'd be happier if they were just a bit juicier. Beans, however were delicious. Perhaps the dryness factor comes from having to sit out too long, but if you're not too fussy, you won't mind. All in all, however, a great place to eat. We'll be back, if only for the BBQ!"}
{"text":"I was so excited thinking this was gonna be good BBQ. I was so disappointed. Sorry, took this one off my list of great places."}
{"text":"my first visit of many more to come, and what a perfect day!  this is comfort food all the way!  had their pulled pork sandwich, 2 sides - mac & cheese and their famous cheesy potato, and homemade root beer. yes, homemade root beer.  mmm! ran out of room, was too full to try their famous sweet potato dessert, so will have to return soon but will hold back on the sides so i have room for dessert. oh! there's indoor seating and outdoor park-like seating, so for those who have pet dogs, this is a casual and relaxed setting your pup will love (outside), and there's a large grassy area with huge shade trees. the only thing missing... a hammock. another bucket list item.  top3 reasons... 1) great selection of quality, tasty comfort food dishes (entrees, sides, desserts, beverages) 2) ambience (setting is relaxed, casual, family and pet friendly) 3) value for portions"}
{"text":"Wow. This was amazing. The people there are super friendly, and I have no complaints to make about the customer service even if I tried. Still, I'm raving about the delicious food instead. I was slightly disappointed in the baked beans, but that's a personal preference sort of thing. Too many onions for me. I also ordered mac n cheese, chicken breast, ham, and the apple crisp a la mode. It was to die for. I couldn't help dipping everything in their homemade bbq sauce, followed by a gulp of their amazing homemade root beer. Even the place itself is cute and has a very warm aura. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place very much. They have a great selection of Smoked Meats from Turkey to pork and all kinds of in-between.  For Gilbert this is definitely the best barbecue place in town."}
{"text":"Great BBQ food! Definitely a great place to take the family out we go here at least once a month and the children love it as well, and I have the world's pickiest children!"}
{"text":"my favorite restaurant.  they do one thing and do it well.  amazing.  great service too.  keep the sweet potato pie please!!!  joe johnston knows his business and it shows.  fantastic."}
{"text":"Been here several times and loved the food and service. I had weight loss surgery a year ago and my wife wanted to come up for some BBQ. I ordered the kids rib, as I can't eat larger portions anymore. They refused my order. I've never been refused a kids portion before ever. I was floored. We asked for the manager; he stated that the owners will not honor kids portions to anyone over 12. We will not be back. It's unfortunate as we liked this place. Side note: the cashier, Florrencia, was completely rude about the whole thing. Managers name was Bill. Bill stated that they lose money on Kids meals. They are 6 bucks. 2 less than a regular meal. I'm sure they don't lose money. I'm sure this review won't matter to them as this place is always busy. Just wanted to speak up about it."}
{"text":"The food was brilliant and the best we have had since our move from Alabama!! First time coming here so I got the BBQ Sampler. The chicken was by far the best very tender, flavorful, and moist, the second in line was the ribs they were especially great with the sweet BBQ sauce added. Third, was the pulled pork as is and fourth was the brisket. The brisket was a bit too oily for me. Of the sides we got(in order from best to the least favorite) BBQ pit beans, cheesy potatoes, coleslaw, mac n cheese, and potato salad. The coleslaw has a great apple after taste. The homemade root beer is real sweet almost tastes like a cream soda. Overall it was a great experience, long lines but they move quickly only drawback is if you want a refill on your drink you have to either stand in line again or be rude and push your way through the people waiting to order."}
{"text":"This place can't be beat.  I have never been disappointed!  So many things to choose from for meats--can't miss with any of them.  The sides are great as well.  I wish I could duplicate their mac and cheese.  Don't forget you get a $10 credit on your birthday!"}
{"text":"A sign of any good BBQ place, in my book, is how the beef brisket is done. Joe's brisket is right on. Thick sliced with a nice pink smoke ring and burnt edges. Accompanied by the thin tangy sauce, it makes for a solid BBQ experience. I tried out the sampler plate complete with ribs, brisket, pulled pork and smoked chicken. Everything had a distinct smokey flavor and while it was good BBQ, nothing stood out as fantastic. The dry slice of herbed bread didn't add much either as it was a strange contrast to the sweet smokey meat. Side dishes I tried were just average - the slaw and sweet corn were decent if not a touch bland while the beans and potato salad earn high marks for their savory flavors. Altogether I have to say I'm a fan of the meat, but the side dishes-not so much. But hey, who goes to a BBQ joint for the sides anyway!
Update:
After dining in, I'm now a true believer. Jalapeno Turkey Sausage and fresh lemonade alone warrant 5 stars, and the service was fantastic. All the fresh side dishes I tried were solid. I'll write off the negative comments above to the fact I got take out that time. The atmosphere, with its down home, communal feel also lent to a great BBQ experience. And the beef brisket was still phenomenal."}
{"text":"Come for the barbeque, stay for all the rest -- this is an old-fashioned joint, cafeteria-style lineup but with a LOT more charm. 

The BBQ is the star of the show here -- I had the sliced beef brisket and the pulled pork, both of which were superb. The ribs looked great as well. My side of coleslaw had a touch of fennel to it, and while I don't normally like fennel it wasn't overwhelming and I found myself eating it all.

Now, theoretically you could eat healthy/paleo here -- stick to the meats and veggies and iced tea -- but why would you, when there's fresh hot cornbread with honey butter? And root beer cake? And a bourbon-blueberry cheesecake? And the rare-but-delicious Barq's red cream soda on fountain? We fell victim to all of the above, and I don't regret it one bit. I'll be recommending Joe's for sure."}
{"text":"The prices increased and the portions are quite small . Overall I like the chopped brisket best and I usually get the chopped brisket sandwich . The Mac and cheese lacks flavor and the cheesy potatoes need way more salt and seasonings. The service is ok , the takeout service can be rude sometimes . When I asked for more than two barbecues they told me I can only get two ? Which usually didn't happen to me . I don't really like the patio because there are way too many flies :/ the backyard is nice if you have kids lol .If you are going here I recommend you get a chopped brisket sandwich ."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I keep putting off reviewing Joe's BBQ, because it's definitely one of my favorite restaurants in town. I guess I have TOO many good things to say! Here are just a few of them:

The service is always friendly and fast and the food is cheap. Even though I've never made it in on my birthday, I love that they offer a free complete meal on your day! 

In general I'm not a big fan of BBQ. In fact, the only thing I ever get at Joe's is their chicken breast sandwich, but I'm hooked for life. The mac & cheese is amazing and I've been known to get two portions of it because it is so good. I recently discovered their cornbread, and it is also a winner. The root beer cake was intriguing but not as good as I was hoping for, but the lemon cake is great. Oh and the chocolate chip cookies are the best I've ever had.

My only little complaint, and it's not even something that can be fixed because of the restaurant setup, is how it is difficult to get drink refills when there is a long line. I always feel awkward trying to maneuver my way through the line up to the drink area. 

It's probably a good thing I don't live closer to Joe's because I'd be in every single day. No joke."}
{"text":"As a sibling to Joe's Farm Grill, this place was a must try...

As i've said many times before, believe the hype ( i know i say that a lot so sorry if its getting a little annoying)...

This isn't your typical sit down, order from a menu and wait for your food type of joint.  You walk up, pick your meats (as is, in a sandwhich or sample all, etc...), pick your sides (great variety), grab a drink (no sweet tea! seriously?), pay, then sit down.  Best way to describe it is \"cafeteria style.\"  Its clever but boy the line gets very long during busy times.  Luckily me and my lady went just before the dinner rush but i suggest picking a seat or booth as far away from where the line forms because you will get blocked in (and people will hover over you watching you eat while waiting in line).  Another cool thing they have is a takeout window on the side of the building.  Looks like they make it real easy to call in, pick up grub or just order to go.

For meat i ordered the brisket and hot links.  Both were amazing!  As far as BBQ sauce you have 2 choices (their regular, very delicious homemade BBQ sauce or a spicy version which is friggin amazing and not too spicy unless you're a whimp) which keeps the theme of being simple (unlike famous daves where you have many to choose from).  I smothered both my meats in the spicy BBQ sauce and seriously ever since then i've been dying to go back and have more.

For my sides i had the mac and cheese and buttered corn (not on the cob). Both were also very very delicious.  Of course i had to try the cornbread and oh my goodness it could be one of the best i've ever had.

The cafeteria style, perfect portions and great food makes this my first choice for BBQ in all of AZ.  The two small complaints are no sweet tea (a requirement for all BBQ spots) and the prices only because i'm broke and unemployed but believe me, once i'm back working this will be a once a week (at least) type of place.  

As far as i'm concerned, this Joe dude knows whats up.  Until we meet again..."}
{"text":"My wife is not a fan of BBQ, so I only get so many chances to get to this kind of joint.  I love to use Yelp to find the best around, and this place did not disappoint.  I really like to try all the menu items, so I usually order a \"sampler\" platter to get an idea.  Good thing the BBQ sampler plate was on the menu!  3/4 pounds of ribs, chicken, pork and beef came with this item, along with a side of pit beans and cole slaw.  Every meat item was very good.  My favorite was the ribs, which just fell off the bone, so very tender!  The cole slaw was a little bland for my tastes, but he pit beans were excellent, with just as much meat in it as there was beans.  Very filling meal.
I can't wait to go back again and get the ribs, and try some of the other sides.  Oh, and the homemade root beer was fairly good, but not my favorite."}
{"text":"My wife picked up a to go order for the family as we have done often before. She forgot to order a side of spicy bbq sauce so I stood back in line to order it. When it was my turn in line, I ordered the sauce and gave the cashier my credit card. She stood there, and then she was going to take the sauce back. I asked if it was cash only she said \"no\" but that the charge was only a few cents and not enough to run the credit card machine. I get it there is a nominal fee to process a credit card, but you are the one that is deciding to charge for the sauce. And I asked if she can just process it. \"No\". So I asked if she could just give me one. And she was going to actually refuse, so I asked her again if she can't just sell it to me. She hesitated and then finally relented to give me one, but gave me a disgusted look. I don't know if these mine these sauces in the snow capped mountains of Peru, but apparently half an once of bbq sauce here is not worth giving or charging a fairly regular customer in the name of good service. I refuse to ever recommend this place or give Joe's or any of their family of restaurants any of my business again. Seriously half an ounce of bbq sauce and you want to make it a big deal to sell or give one to a regular customer? Give me a break."}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy.  Always a good time at Joes.  Family friendly, wonderful food served cafeteria style as you go through the line. A must visit for Gilbert."}
{"text":"I can't believe that people like this tasteless fast food BBQ! Sausage is extremely dry and horrible. Brisket needs to be drowned in BBQ sauce and was very chewy. Why on earth would you put the soda machines in the corner where the main caelfeteria line is? If people say this is the best BBQ what are you comparing it to - the pulled pork at McDonalds? I challenge you to look elsewhere to get your BBQ fix. I won't name places here but look in Chandler, Mesa, Phoenix for some of the best. I gave a try again recently to give it a shot and still sucked. I will not return."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat =) 
Their food is sooo good. I have never gotten anything there and not liked it. I usually get the huge baked potato stuffed with chicken and a put lots of the bbq on it and i get the beans too (really good) if Im really hungry I get mac n cheese too.  I always get the homemade rootbeer. Their rootbeer was the only thing i craved while i was pregnant...LoL.
And we always buy a couple bottles of the bbq sauce. 
It is a great, casual, fun place to eat."}
{"text":"This is an okay place somewhat ruined by all the hype surrounding it. I'll just do a \"pro/con\" thing:

PROS

-The beef brisket was pretty badass.
-The homemade root beer was pretty nice, especially after not having root beer for a long time. 

CONS

-The lines. We went on a Tuesday night and it was packed. I know there isn't much to do in Old Town Gilbert and maybe this place is the highlight, but geez. By the time you get all the food on your plate, it's cold from waiting in line so long.

-The sides. While the meat offerings all seem super-tasty and well-seasoned and all that, I think they kinda got lazy with the sides. The mac and cheese surely comes out of some frozen package, and other offerings that my table mates had weren't much better. The cornbread was really the low point for me, as it was more the northern \"sweet\" type and was dry and crumbly.

-BUTTA. Yeah, this is just a pet peeve of mine, but the \"butter\" they offered was not butter, I'm pretty sure. I'm anal about hydrogenated oils and polyunsaturated posers, and it had the consistency and look of one of those tub margarines, so let's call a spade a spade.

-The seating/atmosphere: Since half of the area is taken up by people waiting in line, you have to sit on the far and dark side of the place (or outside) to avoid people standing over you while you eat. Guess you can't blame a place for being busy, but that doesn't really give any consolation. The place is also so dark, and not in a charming Italian restaurant way. 


All-in-all, I'd say this is more of a 2.5 review than a 3. It really just feels like a soup kitchen with a bunch of starving homeless people, but hey: The meat's good."}
{"text":"I was transported back to the twenties when I stepped into this establishment. I was expecting a sit-down place but Joe's is cafeteria-style! Totally reminded me of Clifton's in Los Angeles. Joe's is an oasis of character in a suburban wasteland.

The pulled pork sandwich is to die for. I ordered the beef tips sandwich and had a major case of food envy when I tried my friend's pulled pork. Oh, pardon me as I dab the drool from my mouth!

With decent sides and an array of old-timey bottled drinks Joe's is a fun place to eat. In my opinion there's no better way to end the week than with a cold bottle of orange Crush, good BBQ and homemade mac n cheese!"}
{"text":"A carnosaurus rex's home from home. Could I be any clearer? From the post-modern retro American decor, with a slightly agricultural flavor, in this family-owned and family-friendly, gastronomic paradise to the scrummy nomnomnomalicious treats, Joe's Real BBQ has it all. This is undoubtedly one of my all-time favorite restaurants in the Valley. 

I invariably survey the whole menu every time I go and I end up going with the ribs, which are always juicy (read a couple of reviews in which the reviewer said that the ribs were dry; I dunno, I think you went on the one day of the year they are dry) and coated with a BBQ sauce that is to die for. I've never gone wrong with the potato salad, coleslaw, or corn, but I hear the BBQ pit beans are great too. I'm not a root beer fan, but my son swears it's awesome and he's usually pretty forthcoming about things that don't sit well with him, so I've got to believe the root beer doesn't suck too badly. The pulled pork and the chicken rawk the sawks, so check them out if you get a chance. 

Also love the take-out window outside. If you don't feel like standing in line inside (and there's always a line around lunchtime and dinner), then get your quick fix with some take-out instead. 

All of the menus can be found at Joe's Web site: http://www.joesrealbbq.com/menu.php

The prices are on a par with Famous Dave's, but I think the food is much better, so Joe's offers better value and a real down-to-Earth, all-American family atmosphere."}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to try out Joe's last night with my family.  I hate to say it (I really wanted to like the place) but I wasn't very impressed overall.  The food quality overall was very average, nothing stood out as phenomenal from any of our choices (we sampled from each other's plates).  Not to say anything was bad, just not superb.  The portions were a little small for the price.

All in all it was an okay experience, but the price ($40 for 2 adults and 2 kids) is high enough to keep us from going back."}
{"text":"Went here with the fam and we loved this place. Ribs are fall-off-the-bone and by 6 year old loved the brisket kids sandwich. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because some of the side dishes were not....great. The Mac n cheese, cheesy potatoes and potato salad were just 'eh however add in a little of their house bar b que sauce to the potato salad and you'll be happy. Baked beans? Yyuuuuummmmm!!!! And lets not forget about the choc chip cookies.....deeelish! Overall we absolutely love what downtown Gilbert has to offer (we are huuuuuge fans of Postinos East, the Farmhouse and Liberty Market....need to try a few of the other resteraunts as well) and Joes Real Barbque served up some tasty food."}
{"text":"I'd say 3.5 stars, but since I can't rate half stars, I'd rather say 4 star than 3 star.  

Let's cut right to it.  The ribs are fantastic.  They shine above all the other things we tried.

Went and had dinner one Saturday night.  There was quite a line, but it seemed to move pretty fast.  It's cafeteria style - you stand in line, order at the front, they hand you a cafeteria platter and you move down the line, selecting more things if you want.  Check out at the cashier, then find a seat wherever you can.  Despite a very large crowd, there was ample seating.

The ribs are the stars here.  A little smoky, nice and tender, good BBQ sauce.  Great flavor overall.  

The brisket was decent, as was the pulled pork.  The BBQ chicken was surprisingly good (if I'm eating BBQ, I *rarely* get chicken because it pales in comparison to the pig usually).  

Sides don't look like much, but they are plenty.  Mac N Cheese was good, as was the cheesy potatoes.  They have a giant baked potato that we didn't try, but it looks both enormous and delicious.

Cornbread is served warm with this delicious honey-butter.  Don't miss this.

Desserts were lackluster.  We grabbed the pecan brownie and a slice of lemon cake - both were very OK.  Next time I'd just end on the cornbread (or possibly try the sweet potato pie which looked pretty good too).  

An interesting place to try.  Not my favorite BBQ in Phoenix, but it's up there."}
{"text":"Great BBQ and sides.  My hubby and I always order the sampler and two sides to split.  Plenty of food without overeating.  The only negatives are that the location of the ordering line and the soft drink machine are too close and the outdoor seating is overrun with birds."}
{"text":"Moving to the Gilbert area, I scouted the downtown area with some hope that I would find some good food. Thankfully, I read about Joe's Real BBQ, checked it out, and continue to visit every chance I get."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I looked up this place on yelp and decided to try it out.  When we arrived, we walked inside and the line was to the door.  Instead of waiting, we went to the take-out window outside, which we thought was very convienent.  They were very fast and friendly.  The ribs were tender and very good.  The pulled pork and hot sausage had great flavor!  Their bbq sauce is sweet with a bit of tang.  The mac and cheese was EXCELLENT!  The only thing that I was not pleased with was the cornbread.  I feel that they could make it much better.  We will definately be going back to eat bbq.  Overall experience was very good."}
{"text":"Our favorite Bbq spot! Shredded brisket sandwich and Mac and cheese are favorites. Best chocolate chip cookies ever! Friendly staff and great family atmosphere."}
{"text":"great BBQ! long lines but it moves pretty quick. they have really good corn bread as well. always love this place. $10 off on your birthday!"}
{"text":"Joe's Real BBQ is simply great comfort food fast at a reasonable price.  No fancy garbage but simple home cooking.  With a cafeteria style atmosphere, fear no line because service is quick.  Upon my trip back, there was at least a line 20 people deep.  Within a few minutes, I had picked my meal, paid, and had found my seat.  I'm a big fan of beef brisket, full slab of ribs, and pulled pork.  This place does all of these... for lack of a better phrase--right.  Ribs should never be stringy or chewy...ahem...Don and Charlie's (Carsons Ribs of Chicago just aren't that great).  You can actually separate these smoky, sweet, and a tiny bit of kick ribs by pulling them apart--that is, they aren't falling off the bone but definitely tender.  The brisket, like the ribs, have the same flavor.  Sometimes when you go to a BBQ restaurant, the brisket is awfully dry and therefore is sometimes masked in a virtual sea of sauce ;however, this is not the case.  Tender, succulent and add your own amount of BBQ sauce makes this a winner.  My niece loves the pulled pork sandwiches here because portions are great and the meat is just overall great quality.

As for beverages, it provides a nostalgic and country atmosphere as the have several differen't classic sodas in glass bottles, as well as their own homemade rootbeer--which is not some chemically obnxious tasting carbonate.  Along with your meal, the sides are also the best I've seen this side of the Mississippi.  Macaroni and cheese, baked beans with actual chunks of ham, coleslaw, cornbread... you just can't go wrong with any of them.

All in all, this is probably one of my top ten favorite spots in AZ.  It's definitely worth the time and money."}
{"text":"Visited last night for the first time.  Wife and son liked it, I thought it was OK.  I deducted a star for lack or alcohol service.  I was really in the mood for a cold beer and ribs and Joe's doesn't serve any alcohol of any kind.  Food was excellent quality, but the sauce was rather bland.  There is a sauce bar where you can get some extra sauce with a little kick to it.

It's a family place in the southeast valley which probably explains the \"no alcohol policy\" and bland preparation.  But, it's a nice place with good food if you don't mind iced tea with your ribs."}
{"text":"I love eating at Joe's. The dining room is really cool, but I like going outside to the picnic tables and eating there. On this day, I got the half slab or pork ribs, potato salad, mac and cheese and a diet soda.

It's nice eating on real china with real silverwear. The sides were fine except for the toast. Did we toast it within the past hour? I do like really good bread with my meals and this did not do it. Joe's needs to figure a way to give us fresh, hot toast. A piece of white bread with butter would have been better. 

The sauce on the ribs was great. Not the sweet kind, just right. It makes the meal. The pork did fall off the bone, but it wasn't the best tasting. Not sure why. Not bad enough to return, but not 'oh my god' good.

I'll go back. Especially in a couple weeks on my birthday. Joe is kind enough to let me eat for free on that day. Up to $10 bucks. Not bad

I did end up taking half of my ribs home. Maybe, I'll sneak out to the kitchen.  BRB."}
{"text":"Thanks to Joel's family and staff for their FREE  community BBQ  for lunch and dinner today. We appreciate it.
I'm a regular customer for the turkey breast, turkey sausage, side dishes and desserts.  The meats are cooked to perfection and very tasty. Yummy!!  I'm planning to return for dinner next week."}
{"text":"Ack. Smoke.

I guess I just like to taste my meat, not just an overbearing smoke flavor. Both times we went, we were burping smoke for hours and had upset stomachs. The ribs were tough, sauce is blah, the checkout people (???) were distant to the point of being rude... on the plus side, it's cheap and they have big portions. 

But I'll eat a cigarette instead."}
{"text":"Went here on Sat and it was FANTASTIC!!!  Best brisket we've ever had.  Tender, great smoke ring, not too fatty and excellent sauce.  The mac & cheese and potato salad were great, too.  The bread would've been better if it was toasted.  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ. Staff is always cheery! Can get busy get there early! There take out window is really fast! You gotta try it."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*

In the interest of supporting local AZ businesses, my husband and I had dinner here on my b-day (5/13). The first thing I observed is that they have a couple walk-up windows on the southside of the building so you can place your order and get food without having to go inside. Thought that was pretty clever! We arrived close to 8 pm and it was still pretty busy inside, but the line moved quickly. 

The restaurant is set up cafeteria style with a kitschy country look. There is a huge mural on one wall dedicated to farm living and a John Deere tractor with accompanying bric-a-brac on the other side. Once we got through the line, I choose the meat plate with 2 sides...beef brisket and pulled pork for my meats, mac 'n' cheese and beans for my sides. I really wanted to get chicken instead of the pork, but they had unfortunately run out of chicken :( . My hubby got the full slab of pork ribs with sweet cut corn and mac 'n' cheese for his sides. We shared a piece of cornbread and for dessert, split the root beer cake. Happily I received a discount on my meal because it was my birthday (they advertise a \"free\" meal, though it's basically $10 off).

The beef brisket and pulled pork were so good! Tender, juicy, and delicious! Those meats really are the best reason to go Joe's. The beans and mac 'n' cheese were just ok...so far Fleming's beats everyone hands down when it comes to mac 'n' cheese! The cornbread was so-so, tasted like it came from a box, but the honey butter that comes with it made it pretty tasty. Regrettably, my husband's pork ribs were pretty fatty as compared to Lucille's (Tempe Marketplace). The root beer cake was good, but not as delectable as we thought it would be. Maybe we were expecting too much after reading how much fellow Yelpers enjoyed it? Another thing worth mentioning (some others have commented on it too) is how strange the beverage station is. It's smack dab at the front of the line where you get your food so you have to fight your way through the crowd (if there is one) to get a refill. Weird.   

To conclude, Lucille's is still our #1 favorite place for BBQ, but we would still go to Joe's again."}
{"text":"I love it here. We eat here all of the time. I usually get a Brisket, cheesy potatoes, and beans- All are very flavorful. On the weekends there is always a line out the door but it moves pretty fast. They have a side window so that you can order food to go. You can also call it in and pick it up at the window for faster service. It still tastes great when you get it home. If you haven't eaten here I would definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"I love good bbq, and in this city this the best you will get. If you go here get the sampler plate. It will leave you feeling full. I normally have to bring home some leftovers. One word of advice it can get very busy on Friday's after work."}
{"text":"There is no better place for brisket than Joe's!!! And best part, it is always consistently good. Try the chocolate cookie too!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ restaurant. Nice laid back feel and awesome food that makes me want to dance when it hits the tongue. I have yet to be disappointed. Eat here!"}
{"text":"I just brought my family here on Saturday. We make the trek from Scottsdale because this is hands down the best BBQ. 

While there a line formed out the door. That says one of two things about a restaurant, either the service is bad, or the food is great.

I'll tell you what, the service is not bad at all. They are friendly, fast and as helpful as they can be, even to newcomers. So that leaves only one conclusion, the food must be great, my family sure thinks so. 

When someone says let's have BBQ, they mean Joe's Real BBQ."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, food was okay for a smoked bbq joint.  Brisket decent, ribs and pulled pork were a bit dry and chicken was good... The mac and cheese was delicious!"}
{"text":"The BBQ 3/4 Lbs Sampler was really good and worth the money! Also the Salad w/pulled pork was delicious! Not as great as Texas BBQ but very close!"}
{"text":"Bbq is spot on. My two favorites were the ribs and the pulled pork. Delicious. Will be back next time I'm in Arizona!!"}
{"text":"Joes is a must for birthdays and fun on weekends.  The lines can be long but they more quickly.  If you are lucky enough to meet Joe then dinner becomes a family affair.  The food is hot and fresh and so tasty.  My favorite is the loaded potato with pulled pork.  

My family raves about the Mac and Cheese and other great sides but we all agree that the pulled pork is amazing!  Will continue to go there for birthdays and fun occasions."}
{"text":"First of all, I did not expect to come into a cafeteria style eatery. They serve the basics of BBQ, nothing too fancy. A few appetizers and side options, like cheesy potatoes, baked mac n' cheese, fresh corn bread, etc. All were very tasty. 

For entree, they have a wide variety of meats and combos and samplers. Overall, this is a great place,... meat was well prepared, a little pricey for what I was expecting."}
{"text":"I've only had the pork ribs, potato salad (they use red potatoes, YES) bread, and their cheesy potatoes, but they are truly delish! I even had some left over that I ate the next day, and I never eat leftovers, ever. Not to mention the amazing smell that hits you like a ton of bricks as soon as you walk anywhere within a mile of this place. My good friend tattoos at a shop next to this place and he took me here on his lunch break. I was reluctant to go because I've never had good bbq that wasn't made on a grill in a backyard, but boy was I wrong. This place does it right with a price that won't make you feel guilty about eating out. And they sell old school candy like bazooka gum and wax lips! SCORE!"}
{"text":"Fresh flavorful food served up cafeteria style. Inside and outside dinning. A great place for the whole family. Friendly and fun!"}
{"text":"The bake potato and BBQ ribs are to die for! The ribs fall apart in your mouth and the potato in sea salt with all the fixins is unbelievable! We recommend this place all the way!"}
{"text":"This is definitely more of a family place than fine dining. The food is pretty decent especially if you are a serious meat eater - big portions and big value. They make their own root beer which is very yummy! 

What I don't like about Joe's Real BBQ is the feeling of being in a cattle call. You stand in a line to order your food and the line is always very long. It kinda reminds me of Southwest Airlines which I'm also not a big fan of! It is however a great place to take your kids. It's loud and any sounds of screaming children blend in well together. ;)"}
{"text":"The decor for this place is amazing, just loved the vintage poster and the restored classic John Deer tractor in vivid green.   Even the glass soda pop bottles still in ice in the tin tub were just so gosh darn cute.

Unfortunately, the food didn't quite match up to the decor.  The main flavor profile was the sweetness that permeated the beef brisket, the pork rib, the hot links and...yes the baked beans.   My favorite was the baked beans and the house made rootbeer which had an almost medicinal kick to it

Overall, the food was ok and the fun retro atmosphere is worth the vist if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Me and my husband love joe's it is some of the best BBQ around. The staff is always friendly and the food is great and the owner is such a nice guy. My husband loves the hot links and the corn bread! I love the chicken and there cheesecake. I would have given it a five star but it is so busy all the time that sometimes it takes forever to get in and find a seat. But that does not stop me from going! The other is I hate the bread that comes with the food I don't know why I just do. But again does not stop me from going cause I love there food!"}
{"text":"This is probably fantastic BBQ for many but not those that are from the heart of BBQ country. I'm still in search of GREAT BBQ. Where do I find pork cooked long & slopped with sauce the whole time its being burnt with fire? Uber tired of smoked meat with little to no flavor and sweet sauce. The sides here are really good but I'm still in search of bbq like you find down South & Kansas City. The atmosphere is great and I was so excited to eat here because Joe's Farm Grill is so unbelievably good. If people turn there head like a confused dog (and EVERY PHX BBQ joint has so far) when you ask them for chopped outside, they have NO business being in the BBQ business."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ Sampler Plate today... Superior tasting, ribs, chicken and pork without any sauce."}
{"text":"Great Texas style BBQ in Arizona.  Lots of great food and not that expensive."}
{"text":"We have been to the other restaurant and liked it so we wanted to try their bbq. The restaurant is decorated like the inside of a barn, big and open. The food is ordered cafeteria style with the drinks first. This creates a bit of a log jam because you have people re-filling their drinks and people that can't decide on what to drink and what to order. After that it was easier to get to the food. We ordered  the chopped brisket sandwich, sliced brisket, turkey sausage and  pork ribs. For the sides we had baked beans, cole slaw, mac n cheese, corn and corn bread. The bbq items were good but, the various sauces made them better. Our favorite was the habanero bbq sauce. The chopped brisket sandwich had too much sauce and too sweet for me. The baked beans were good, as for the rest of the sides they were ok. The big flavors of the bbq overshadowed the flavors of the sides. Overall a decent bbq joint to enjoy with the family."}
{"text":"Visiting my cuzzos in AZ for Memorial Day weekend, they took me to Joe's Real BBQ. The place itself is very nice, it's spacious and has ample seating. When we got there, there was a huge line that stretched out to the door, but an employee (who I'm pretty sure is Joe himself; he looked like the man on the logo)  came out and assured us that the wait was only 20 minutes or so. I felt assured after that.

If it's your first time, then I'd definitely recommend getting the BBQ Sampler Plate. It has good portions of ribs, chicken, pork, and beef so you can sample from everything.

Although all my Arizonians relatives found Joe's BBQ to be delicious, I personally found Joe's to be less than stellar than some of the BBQ joints I've been to in California. For starters, they totally skimped on the BBQ sauce, and for me, when I eat BBQ, I NEED all that sauce to be smothering my meat. 

One last note: Joe's Real BBQ gets the most points in my book for having cream soda. I'm a HUGE cream soda aficionado, and well, let's just say the highlight of my night was owning up the cream soda fountain. I killed it (though the same could be said for my bladder).

Joe's BBQ is definitely nice for large family outings. You can talk, take your time, and just really chill here. But for real BBQ taste, I wouldn't say this is my first choice."}
{"text":"This was some of the worse BBQ I have had in a long time. This has been an iconic BBQ  spot in Phoenix for years, but now it is just plain awful. The meats were bland, the ribs had more flavor but not much. The buffet did not look very appetizing and all of us returned the cole slaw due to lack of flavor. The canned corn was just like school lunches. The three of us have eaten there before a few years ago, and remember how it used to be, delicious and worth the calories. Today they had cheese potatoes, not so good. same flavors as the mac and cheese. Cornbread passable, but far from moist. No one finished their food. Even the root beer was not delicious or refreshing. It used to be outstanding home made root beer.  The root beer cake used to be standout, and now it is some sort of cake with a sugary crust frosting and the cake dry at the edge. Sadness! 
On the other hand the people that work there are wonderful, kind and ready to help with what ever you need. The atmosphere  with the tractor in the middle of the room is outstanding. The buffet and sit down style works well and families seemed to have a good time. 
But many of us have grown to know fabulous BBQ from many places, and now this place no longer meets the grade. And not worth the calories or a trip."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite barbecue place in Arizona. Treated myself to a pre-4th of July sampler. The brisket, ribs, chicken, and pulled pork were all tasty and good. The baked beans and cheesy potato sides were tasty as well. I'll definitely go here again."}
{"text":"We use to love Joe's... Atmosphere/Service is the only thing that saved it from getting no stars! However, their meat has gone ****DOWNHILL in a big way****! There never use to be any fat in the meat, at-least NOT EVERY BITE!  Who ever does the meat QA, needs to be fired!  We use to have all our big family celebrations at Joe's because the food WAS so good! We have given Joe's Real BBQ two visits. However, this third AND last time we had to pick through the meat(I use the word loosely)!!! We ordered the Salad with Meat(w/o sauce) on top and a Jumbo sandwich neither could be finished due to the amount of fat in EVERY bite!  Please, Joe's Owners, go back to where ever you got your meat before, or whomever did the purchasing of said meat!!!  You were our GoTo BBQ place in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE Joe's. Delicious! We also use them for private and business catering. It's always a great experience.

The brisket and baked beans are to die for! They are our favorite go to options! 

Yum!!

Great service!!! Great management! Great location!! Great vibe!!"}
{"text":"Must have: stuffed baker with chopped brisket and root beer. Great food and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Great place for bbq, they've been doing this for a while, it shows. The staff is friendly, the place is clean. I have yet to be there and the line isn't halfway through the restaurant.  Great Brisket, Ribs and Pulled Pork, tasty sides. Prices are fair for what you get."}
{"text":"I have always loved Joe's. The food, selection, the staff, and the atmosphere is always fantastic. Joe's gives AZ BBQ a great name and I always get excited when I get the chance to go. Do yourself a favor and get some Joe's Real BBQ."}
{"text":"Can I just say in a nutshell we loved this place. I had been hearing about it from some customers of mine and the family and I decided we would give it a try, It did not disappoint!! We order the mixed meat platter, mac and cheese, chicken and pulled pork sandwich. Dessert was the sweet potato pie with graham cracker crust alamode. I love how the coffee is offered and the variety of sauce. The ambiance is great vintage candies and cool comfortable seating. Will definitely return, if in Gilbert this is a must stop."}
{"text":"While on my first visit to this place, I decided to have their BBQ sampler plate.  Their pork ribs were my favorite thing, but they were just okay.  The pulled pork was less than average, and the beef brisket was by far my least favorite thing.  The reoccurring theme for all of these meats was blandness, which was most pronounced on the brisket.  Also, the sauce wasn't my favorite.  It was overly sweet and reminded me of syrup you put on pancakes because it had a distinct maple flavor.  I certainly wouldn't buy a bottle of it to take home.

However, it wasn't all bad.  Their sides were pretty good.  The mac and cheese and baked beans were pretty good, and the homemade root beer was excellent.  In the end, I go to BBQ restaurants for the meat not the sides, which means I might not be back to this place.  

Another post indicated that this is good BBQ for Phoenix and just mediocre by southern or Kansas City's standards.  I'm not sure I agree.  I have been to other BBQ places in the Phoenix area, and I have found several--Pork on a Fork, Haps, Honey Bears, and Waldos--to be better than this place, but none of these places meet southern standards.  Only Pork on a Fork or Haps comes close to achieving that feat."}
{"text":"Hot links are a must! The brisket can be a little dry but you can always cover it in delicious sauce."}
{"text":"How did it take so long to come up with the idea of a topper? Man has truly evolved. Pecan smoked pulled pork drenched in hot BBQ sauce topped on a full pound baked potato filled to the brim with all dem fixins. Shame on you Obama."}
{"text":"Ugh, I have been dreading writing this update because Joe's has been serving such good barbecue for so long. Nothing has really changed about the quality of Joe's food or the spectacularly friendly staff here, so I feel really bad moving them down to four stars. However, I had used the big words \"Best BBQ Ever\" in my previous review, and unfortunately for Joe's there is a new heavyweight champion of the world. I still highly recommend Joe's if you live in the East Valley or if you want barbecue 7 days a week or don't want to wait in a long line (go to the pickup window!) or want service later in the evening - Joe's still has all of that over this other competitor. Also, swing by on your birthday - if you can show them an ID with your birthday on it, they will give you a $10 credit on your meal! Thanks for all the memories, Joe's - it's been a wonderful ride. :)"}
{"text":"The food here was delicious! I got the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese and my husband got the same with potato salad. I felt like it could've used more bbq sauce, but fortunately, you're able to go up and get as much as you want from the condiments counter. The kid's meal was perfect - my daughter got a pulled pork slider with chips, a cookie, and a milk, and she ate every bite. This was the best meal we had on our vacation!"}
{"text":"The meat is dry, the \"sauce\" is ketchup-y, the potato salad is godawful, the beans taste as though they came from a can and the buns are just terrible. 
This place is disgusting. Stay away, far far away! Take it from a Texan, they wouldn't know good barbecue if it bit them. How on earth they have a line out the door on a Thursday night is beyond me."}
{"text":"Every time my husband and I go to Arizona this is THE place we have to go eat.  Joe's is always hopping so it is best to go before or after the major lunch and dinner hours.  We have had both the pulled pork and brisket and they are full of wonderful smoke flavor, juicy and tender.  The sauce is the perfect mix of sweet and tangy.  There is also a extra hot version which is also delicious.    We always buy a couple of bottles to take home.  The sides we have tried are the baked beans which are fabulous.  Great smokey flavor, burnt ends mixed in.  The mac and cheese.  Also a favorite with plenty of cheese and lots of flavor. The side salad is average and so is the potato salad.  The homemade root beer is the best and a must order every time.  If you do happen to go during one of their busy times.  It is worth the wait and the line moves quickly."}
{"text":"I came here with 3 other girls, and we ordered basically everything we could on the menu to split between all of us. We ordered the ribs, cheese potatoes, monster potato, macaroni and cheese, corn bread, and the BBQ beans. I must say it was a hearty meal! The price came out to be around $10 a person, which was great to be able to try everything!

This place is a self serve restaurant. You order up front and find your own seats. I would recommend coming before prime lunch/dinner time because a flood of people come in. Also, unless you know exactly what you like from this restaurant, come in a big group! Try everything you can!

It's a very family style place, so it's great for a family outing, a quick date, or even just a hang out! Really cute place!"}
{"text":"We have been before and had a great experience, but today was a disappointing day.  
They started by messing up my husband's order and it held up the line.  It took two attempts to fix it.  As as a result the line worker forgot about me and I had to stay put and ask if I could please get some sides.  They helped others behind me before I was able to have service in line.  It was fixed after a few minutes, but it sure added a few minutes to our somewhat rushed schedule.  
We also went to celebrate my birthday, which is supposed to include a free meal.  Due to the birthday being on a Sunday we weren't granted the deal since today is Saturday.  I understand they have to have policies in place so people don't take advantage, but I felt a little religiously discriminated stating you must go on what many people consider a sacred day.  
The food was great as always, but we felt a little shafted by our experience waiting in line for 20 minutes to be forgotten, and told an offer we thought existed wouldn't."}
{"text":"I now live in Georgia and have been looking for a substitute for Joe's Real BBQ.  I have yet to find one.

This place is just the best.  To begin with, their bbq sauce is unmatched.  They have two sauces, mild and spicy.  I have never had a spicy sauce as good as Joe's.  I crave that sauce and sadly, cannot find anything similar here in Georgia.

The menu at Joe's is extensive and everything is delicious.  My personal favorites are the beef brisket and pit ham.  My wife loves the pulled pork sandwich.  Joe's also offers a variety of sides, with the best mac 'n cheese in the country.  For years, we have tried other restaurants' mac 'n cheese and nothing has come close.

Be prepared to wait in line a while to get your food if you arrive around 5 or 6 pm, but the food is well worth the wait.

Joe's BBQ has become my standard for a 5-star rating for a bbq restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate here the other day. Food was fair. Had the sampler plate. Chicken was dry and a bit well done. Had eaten food from here which was catered in and it was much better.  Staff and service is good."}
{"text":"Wonderful BBQ! The meat is always perfect and the sides are great, not to mention the tasty sauce. The knock on JRB is the drink situation, a real pain in the butt! You'll know once you go."}
{"text":"Always amazing, great food, friendly helpfull employes, and very kid friendly."}
{"text":"Joe's BBQ is the best around. Smoked meats, home made BBQ sauces. Sweet and Spicy. Side dishes with a twist. Like the beans an cheesy potatoes. Outside for young ones to play. Oh, and it's free meal for birthday. Bring your drivers license. Sweet. Our family lives Joe's Barbecue!"}
{"text":"The Very Best BBQ...in the Valley always a big Treat and free on the Bday.. ya can't beat it wit a stick...lol"}
{"text":"So much for low carb meal tonight. This place is the bomb! I personally like the whole cafeteria style: they get you in and ordered and out. Perfect. I got the chopped brisket sandwich and Mac and cheese! It is sooo delicious and I definitely recommend both! They even have an out door/window ordering place. I think I waited in line for a whopping 3 1/2 minutes"}
{"text":"BBQ here is okay but nothing to write home about in my book.  I've definitely had better and also had worse at other places.  My most recent meal was the jumbo sandwich with chopped brisket and hot links (added photo).  

The brisket was okay and the links were only slightly better. The hot links were not hot at all and I'm a wimp when it comes to hotness (trust me, Taco Bell's mild sauce is hot to me). I do really enjoy their pit beans but would love them even more if the sweetness was cut down a tad.  I tried their lemon cake once and was not too impressed (but maybe I'm a snob when it comes to lemon cake).

I do like the various seating options available: inside, enclosed patio and outdoors.  Although the line can get long, the wait is not intolerable.  Parking can be a hassle depending on day and time.  I only eat here to meet up with friends otherwise I would not go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place 6 stars. I go here every year on my birthday and it is still as good as I remember each time. I love the pulled pork sandwich meal with a side of mac and cheese. There pulled pork salad is great as well. I also love the sodas at the front of the line and the addicting chocolate chip cookies. Have great kids meals. You can even buy a bottle of their barbecue sauce!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Joe's dozens of times and it is one of my family's favs. I didn't think very highly of it the first time I ate here, but now that I have found my favorite parts of their menu, I just keep coming back again and again.

I LOVE the homemade rootbeer! I typically don't drink soda. I despise all of the bland fountain drinks served as profit stuffers at most restaurants, but the rootbeer here is so so DELICIOUS!!!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE the lemon cake. We always like to get a fresh center peice. It is so lemony! You can't buy a cake like this in the store. This lemon cake is the real deal. Got to eat it slowly and savor it!

I LOVE the beef brisket jumbo sandwich. I lather it with yummy barbeque sauce. Mmmmmm... so good...

I also love the stuffed baker with beef brisket. I load it up with everything and add onions and barbeque sauce. It feeds my wife and I easily. 

Only downside is that I'm usually rolling out of there, ready to split a gut after stuffing my face and slurping too much rootbeer! HA HA! Of course I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this based on several reviews.  Well it didn't pass my taste bud test. The pulled porked taste like plastic.  The ribs taste like they were just dipped into BBQ sauce with no seasoning.  Try it once if you like to waste your money.  But the service is good and the place is comfortable....but just needs better food!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE
NOSTALGIA!
Great BBQ and sides not cheap but not expensive either, fairly priced for the quality"}
{"text":"Best place in Gilbert to get BBQ. I always get brisket because I am a big brisket fan. Everyone is very nice and food is the best. I also get a root beer float because you can tell it is homemade. Lastly it is probably the only places that has cornhole."}
{"text":"A vegetarian reviewing a BBQ restaurant?  Well here goes.....

On a recent trip to visit some family, we were taken to Joe's Real BBQ.  Everyone in the group was carnivores and all indulged in what smelled like some really good tasting BBQ.  Smokey pecan wood aroma filled the restaurant...and surrounding neighborhood.  I can't speak for the meats that everyone else enjoyed, but the salad I had was really good.  BBQ ranch dressing was very tasty!  Their BBQ sauce is really good.  Their Mac n Cheese was EXTREMELY good.  I had to go back for another serving of that.  Their cornbread was really good too!  Fun atmosphere.  Very friendly staff.  Highly recommended, even by this vegetarian!"}
{"text":"Yum! Beef Brisket & Pulled Pork are my two top picks! Ribs were a bit more firm than I prefer. Chicken was moist & flavorful as well.
My far my favorite item here are the Baked Beans w/smokey pork chunks!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.   

I waited in line to place an order and the guy behind the counter refused to take my order because I wanted it to go. I have never had this happen until tonight. What difference does it make if instead of putting my order on a plate you place it in a to go container.  I was the one who chose to wait in line because I wanted my food prepared the same as if I was eating inside.  You need to remember that you are in the business of taking care of customers not treating them rudely. 

Until today I have always been an advocate for Joes bbq but not anymore.  You cannot treat your customers the way you treated me today and expect me to return. I will NEVER recommend  this place to anyone ever again.

There are to many other places in this area that serve bbq (including two new barbeque joints coming to downtown Gilbert) that I am sure will be more than happy to provide me with top notch customer service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is well above 5 stars and provides exceptional food and service every time we visit! Highly recommended when visiting the Gilbert area!"}
{"text":"Joe's bbq is the best barbecue place around! The people are always friendly and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go for Bar-B-Que.  We usually take all our out of town friends there...and I don't remember anyone being disappointed.  We always enjoy it...the take out window is great...fast...for those nights we just want to eat at home."}
{"text":"Heaven marinated in BBQ sauce! Efficient, cafeteria service line. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Plenty of places to sit inside or out while you take in the history of Gilbert farming.

I highly recommend the pulled pork, brisket and mac&cheese. Super delicious and will leave you more than full!"}
{"text":"It's decent. I really wish that I could give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 but I gave it a 4 instead of a 3.. It's kind of pricey for the fact that you have to go up (cafeteria style) and order as well as pickup your food from the counter. The annoying thing about that is standing in the long line (which there often is a long line). I would much rather be sitting in a booth instead of standing for 30+ minutes. But, anyways the food is really good (even though it's often not hot by the time I take my seat). I've had the chopped chicken (ok), ribs (good), sausage (decent), pulled pork (good), beans (yum, yum). It's in a cute little town center that is Gilbert."}
{"text":"Joe's is a fairly established restaurant in Gilbert.  Hence, the high number of reviews.  The BBQ here is pretty good.  The chopped brisket has nice flavor.  Great!!  We also had the turkey jalapeno sausage - sounds awesome, doesn't it?!  S'alright.   It wasn't bad, but it was lacking on the spicy factor and the expected smokey flavor was slightly bland.  The chicken breast is nicely seasoned, which is nice, but it was also overcooked/dry.  Whenever judging BBQ, don't forget about the sides.  Well, this too presents a mixed review.  The Mac n'cheese and cheesy potatoes - skim 'em.  The baked beans were quite tasty, however.

When you enter this restaurant, it seems crowded, but it moves quickly and it actually isn't too bad finding seating.

Price:  A little spendy, as with Joe's Farm Grill.  Not ridiculously high priced, but a little more than you'd expect.  The portions are decent though, which provides some compensation."}
{"text":"Very very very good! Would highly recommend it to anyone. I had the chicken breast plate with the beans, homemade apple sauce and corn bread. Everything was delicious! We all shared a huge piece of the Root Beer Cake, it is was just as tasty!!!! Definitely go here if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I debated giving this place at least two stars because I do love the food (even though it has gone down hill over the years). But called in my order about 30 mins before I came to pick it up, after waiting for about another 35 minutes to be able to even talk to an employee to pick up my food (which was already ready to go). By the time I had gotten home my food was freezing cold to the point where I just threw it away. Not liking the new \"joes bbq\" and definitely  won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Ok BBQ,  a bit overrated but if you don't know your bbq I can see where people might rate it high. Better than Rudy's though, and I did enjoy the root beer,but do yourself a favor and head over to Little Miss BBQ, you won't look at bbq the same."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.

Best BBQ in the east valley as far as I'm concerned.  Great people, great food, good location and perfect for family outings.  The recently added sweet potato crunch dessert is awesome.

Long lines are usually present, but don't let that turn you away, they go quick.  And if they aren't going quick it's because they don't know how to order.  If you've never been there, don't wander in line, us regulars will hate you :-) -- order the sampler and move on.

Personally I always get up to the line and say \"2 meat rib turkey\" and have never been let down.  Only real worth sides are mac-n-cheese and beans.

Root beer is homemade so don't expect it to taste like Barqs.  

We regular this place and it is great for kids as the outside is plenty of space for them to run around and everyone else does as well so nobody is offended.

Yum, yum, yum."}
{"text":"Okay, I don't mind standing in line for good BBQ, but Joes doesn't have it anymore.  Portions were smaller, meet was dryer and prices were still high.  Joes was a good place to go, but they lost their tough.  Went for quantity over quality.  Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!! Everything was excellent, love the beans!! Great atmosphere and great food. Simple BBQ done the right way, try the root beer cake it is pretty darn good and yes the coffee really is 25 cents. Don't miss Joes!"}
{"text":"Very good food and nice selection of side-item choices. My husband and I confused them a bit when we ordered the sandwich but only wanted one bun between the two of us- a whole bun each is too much bread for us and we didn't want to be throwing food away. They finally figured it out"}
{"text":"Luv, luv, luv Joe's Real BBQ!!!  Great western decor, outstandingly delicious food, good old-fashion hospitality!  The menu is extensive because BBQ is not simply one taste.  The portions are generous and the prices are affordable.  The best part is one can feel the pride in everything the staff does, from greeting guests to serving diners to bussing tables.  They make the dining experience memorable leading to return patronage.  Like its brother restaurant, Joe's Farm Grill, the seating choice and decor makes one feel welcomed.  Thanks, Joe's Real BBQ, for making us want to eat with our hands!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place regularly years ago for lunch and took my husband there for dinner for the first time last night. It was as good as I remembered.  I had the pulled pork sandwich - the meat was tender and flavorful and the toasted bun was fresh and delicious.  The mac and cheese is outstanding as is the coleslaw. My husband had the barbeque sample platter, he really enjoyed the brisket and the pulled pork - the chicken was good but required some extra sauce to make the hint of dryness go away. We make the best darn ribs at home so it's hard to impress us with ribs but these were really good - meat fell off the bone and they were tasty.  Root beer cake was moist and had a great root beer taste.  We also had the homemade root beer and lemomade which were great. All in all a very good meal and the service was excellent.  We'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I had the sampler platter, and wow...I couldn't even finish it all.  It was so much food.  The ribs were good, and the chicken was good....but when I go back, I am sticking to the brisket and the pulled pork.  The brisket and pulled pork are the best I have eaten in AZ, and I have tried a lot of places.  The coleslaw and the macaroni salad was very good as well.  Really can't go wrong with any of the sides.

Make sure to get a coca-cola cake for dessert.  It was amazing.

Definitely try this place out if you are looking for an inexpensive barbecue joint that will fill you up!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite barbecue joint in the Valley. I'm not much of a meat eater, but I can't resist the BBQ at Joe's. I love the pulled pork sandwich. The barbecue sauce is phenomenal and will have you lapping up every last bite. The mac 'n' cheese, which comes with a crusted topping, is to-die-for and makes a wonderful side. The desserts here are also awesome. Be sure to try the rootbeer or the lemon cake."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Joe's Real BBQ since 2000. This is one of my favorite places which is funny considering I don't eat red meat or pork. :) I LOVE the chicken chopped salad and their unique and delicious dressing. Next up would be their root beer cake. To.die.for. 

I also love the chicken bbq sandwich and their cookies and sides. I've had the loaded (ginormous) baked potato which was also amazing. As for everything else on the menu...it must be amazing because it's a 'must go to' place for family and friends that visit from out of town. 

My only complaint is that they close at 9 p.m. on the weekends. We went last night to the pick up window only to find they had closed twenty minutes earlier. We will be back for some root beer cake later today...but Joe."}
{"text":"These are the best ribs in the state of Arizona and the sides are all great especially the beans and mac n cheese.  Don't forget to save room for lemon cake.  The place is cool with a historic feel.  Indoor and outdoor dining."}
{"text":"Joe's has very reasonably priced BBQ. Quality is good, & they've got good sides (like the mac & cheese). We always make sure to get their red cream soda."}
{"text":"We had just pulled into Gilbert and found the good write ups on Joe's Real BBQ.  This is a self-service restaurant with authentic farm equipment.  It's a really good meal for the price.  I did the small meat plate with one side -- ribs made perfectly and cole slaw.  A flash from the past was the nickel Bazooka chewing gum at the cash register.  It was a penny in the 50's, but that's another story.  Parking is easy, large tables and booths,  outside picnic tables and I almost forgot the pickle bar.  This place is worth trying for good customer service, food, and no reason at all to go to a fast food place ever."}
{"text":"First time stopping by tonight and it was pretty good. 

Place was packed, authentic and done well! 

Since I hadn't been there, I did what I usually do....ordered just about everything. Had the sampler with Chicken, Double Pork and Ribs and then 1/2# of Brisket and a Slab of Ribs. 

Brisket was my favorite...moist, thick, smoky 

Ribs were hit or miss...some were great, some were dry. The meat came off the bone to the bite; which was perfect. I like the flavor. 

The Pork was moist but pretty bland. The BBQ sauce went much better with the Pork than it was with anything else. (personally I prefer NCarolina style pork with a vinegar based sauce. 

Loved the cafeteria style, atmosphere and setting. 

The line was about 50 deep at 5pm, so I went out to the window and ordered to go. 

The wife thought the BBQ sauce was KC Masterpiece; not sure if that was a compliment or dig though. 

Will look to eat in the restaurant next time out."}
{"text":"Don't let the line fool you, it goes quick!  

The first time I went I was a little daunted by how ordering actually works but once we found out how it was simple.  The food was really good.  Not extremely filling, but filling enough.  I got the sampler dish and everything was good. As said before, the root beer cannot be better.  It is a very unique restaurant with great food."}
{"text":"After reading all the hype on the way into this establishment  (zagat rating from 2013, another that said it was one of the top 10 BBQ restaurants in the US. ) I have to say that I was truly disappointed. 
I wasn't expecting the cafeteria style service and I really wasn't expecting the exceptionally rude cashier.  So I was hoping the food would make up for the lackluster start to this visit. I am relatively new to Arizona and I love BBQ so I was hoping that Joe's would be the answer to my BBQ Jones. I ordered the 3/4 lb sampler so I could try what they have to offer. Unfortunately I felt that that the meats were dry and lacked that wonderful smokey flavor. I have to admit that I am not that familiar with pecan smoked meats. I am partial to the stronger flavored hickory,  mesquite and apple wood but I only caught a hint of smokiness with the pork ribs, everything else tasted roasted with an average flavor at best. I will continue my search for a good BBQ place in the state of Arizona."}
{"text":"You know, I really respect this Joe person for his philosophy and contributions to Gilbert, but strictly speaking to the food, Joe's BBQ just isn't great. 

First, I'm kind of disgusted by the cafeteria presentation. Generally speaking, I don't have a problem with cafeteria style BBQ places, but at Joe's, the line is never clean looking and I feel like a pig lining up a trough.

On top of that, I just don't think the BBQ is good... I've had the pulled pork, the chicken breast and the sliced brisket and while they were all fine, it just wasn't anything memorable. The sauce too is just uninspired. 

On a positive note, I really liked the homemade root beer!"}
{"text":"Not bad....I really enjoyed the BBQ beans (an interesting blend of different varieties of beans instead of standard white beans) and BBQ chicken leg (what an awesome marinade:  a dry spice rub with the sweetness of honey, roasted to a crisp of skin and flaky meat).  Kudos to the homemade root beer, what a nice refreshing touch.

The rest, including the brisket, pulled pork, baby back rib, and mac and cheese, were not that great.  Dry, flavorless and unexciting."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat here for awhile, but am rarely in Gilbert. We were nearby today and were finally able to try it out!

Such an awesome BBQ lunch. We both got the pulled pork sandwhiches and beans. They were amazing! Some of the best BBQ I've ever had. My husband also got the mac & cheese. I wouldn't recommend getting that though.

Also love the homemade root beer. 

We will be back next time we're in Gilbert! It's definltely a great spot."}
{"text":"I think the line from where you order all the way to the door speaks for itself.  Really yummy bbq and homemade root beer."}
{"text":"Such a fun family environment! Amazing food and homemade root beer!!! love going here especially on my birthday!!! take all your friends and family here!!!!!
BEST BBQ IN GILBERT!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ I have ever eaten.

I lived in Arizona for 10 years and was there when this place opened its doors in 1998.  It is a cafeteria type of set up, but is well worth the wait.  I just got back from a trip to Phoenix and I had to have this place twice!

All the food is freshly prepared.  The beef brisket is to die for.  In fact, so are the ribs, turkey, pork and chicken.  The secret is their smoker.  They have a huge wood burning smoker that they burn pecan wood in.  The pecan flavoring is second to none!.

The sides are all freshly prepared too.  They have potato salad, mac -n- cheese, pit beans, sweet corn, etc., etc.  The best side is their cheesy potatoes.  They are really cheesy with a little kick.  YUMMY!!

My wife always gets their jumbo  baked potato with meat.  Where do they get these spuds?  They're humongous!

They have fountain drinks (Coke products) and they make their own root beer.  If that doesn't tickle your fancy they have bottled Stewart's soda and bottled water.

The staff is generally friendly and the surroundings are clean.  The place is decorated in a nostalgic theme depicting a time when Gilbert was all farm land as far as the eye could see.  There is an old refurbished farm tractor in the middle of the restaurant.  Gives the place a \"hometown\" ambiance.  

On a Spring or Summer night you have to sit outside.  It is decorated as if it was a family cookout complete with Christmas type bulbs atop the acre of lawn.  It's really cozy.

The drawback to this place is that it is popular and therefore very busy.  Especially on a Friday or Saturday night.  Expect to wait a bit, but it is well worth it!

My wife and I moved back to the Bay Area in 2004 and lament losing our favorite BBQ joint, but it makes our yearly visit to her Mom's place all the more sweeter because at least two or three times I'm going to Joe's REAL BBQ!"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff! They were so kind to us and took care of my mother in law who fainted in line while ordering. We left to tend to her and the staff and no one batted an eye. I would recommend it to anyone who has a special event."}
{"text":"We went here for a late lunch and didn't have to wait at all. Employees were very friendly and the food was yummy!"}
{"text":"Love Joe's BBQ - great tasting meats and you still get $10 FREE FOOD on your birthday! Just take your ID with you :)"}
{"text":"A great place to go Services excellence family completely enjoyed the experience we were happy to find such an authentic barbecue place we will be reoccurring customers"}
{"text":"This evening, we honored a long time tradition of meeting friends at Joe's Real BBQ. We have watched this wonderful business open and find its strengths over the years and it is consistently a lovely experience.
We parked in the back where the smokers are, drinking in the aroma of our future dinners. I ordered the meat platter with brisket and pulled pork. Husband ordered the baked potato with pulled pork on top. I enjoyed a tall iced tea and he indulged in the home made root beer. Our kids did their best to clear out the remaining food in the kitchen once our orders were filled. At least that's what the bill infers.
We sat at picnic tables in the enclosed patio. The weather was just right. The green patch outside the dining area is perfect for kids to horse around on. This is a great restaurant for families with energetic kids. 
Joe's knows flavor. The lemon cake would make Martha Stewart weep. The bark on my brisket was perfect. There was no applesauce tonight, or I didn't see it, but if you can get it, DO."}
{"text":"Awesome bbq.....loved their smoked sausage...didn't like their chicken...Their pork is AMAZING...just stay away from the chicken."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I get the loaded baked potato with butter, sour cream and chives. I add their bbq sauce on top and it's amazing! I also get the apple sauce as a side too."}
{"text":"Not sure it I would recommend this place. It's ok. There potato salad wasn't good at all. It's almost like quick fast food. I would go to Dickies BBQ before this place."}
{"text":"I hate to have to do this but I am let down by Joes Real BBQ to the point I feel I must write this. I have always loved Joe's sliced chicken breast. All though pricey It was so damn tasty and properly cooked so I kept coming back. I would often by a LBS of the chicken breast on the days I was feeling lazy and needed a good low carb meal. In the time I have gone here, I live half a block away so I went often, I only had 2 cases of bad chicken. Both times it was overcooked and dry which is the worst you can possibly do to chicken. Last week I bought a LBS of chicken unfortunately when I got home I found it was dry and poorly cooked. I don't like to make a big deal out of it so I thanks to the coleslaw I purchased as well I choked it down. Being a fan of their chicken I figured no big deal I will just ask for a sample next time to ensure I am getting the quality I should. Well today when I went to purchase some chicken the denied me a sample after stating the reason for the request was the poor quality of the chicken I bought last time. Im not asking for a whole breast here I am asking for a slice of the chicken for tasting. Due the poor quality of the last purchase and the refusal to let me sample before I purchased I will not be returning to Joe's Real BBQ.

EDIT* When I was denied a sample it was done by one of the girls at the pick up window. After this occurred I called back and spoke with a Manager about my concerns. They state that next time I order I should test the chicken before leaving and if its not good I should return it. That doesn't seem to be the best way to handle it but if that's how they want to do it then sure. They have also offered me a gift card for my troubles. In the end I am still not happy with the idea that anytime I decide to order chicken from them I have to taste test it and that will potentially keep me from making as many trips. In the end I will change my score to a 3 * as there is still a slight bitter taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Joe's! Wonderful family- oriented feel... Along with fantastic pulled pork sandwiches, beans, and Mac n' cheese!"}
{"text":"A good place to eat if you're craving good BBQ. They serve their burgers with side items like beans and coleslaw. I have to say this is the best BBQ place I've had in awhile."}
{"text":"I lived in Texas and North Carolina, so my BBQ standards are very, very high. My favorite thing @ Joe's is the spicy BBQ sauce. More of a kick than most, and it gets them two stars."}
{"text":"We would get take out from Joes at least once a week and it was always consistently great.  The girls at the window would remember our names and order and we always so friendly!  We have recently moved to the other side of town but will stay visit as often as we can.  Great for a quick bite to eat and they also do a great job with catering orders!  Must do, especially when all the other restaurants in Gilbert are on an hour wait!  Joes is great!"}
{"text":"It's just OK.  I used to think it was great, but then I tried Waldo's near San Tan Village area.. much better.  More food for your dollar.  Joe's is good, but OVER PRICED as is their other restaurant, Joe's Farmers Grill.  Just not worth the $$.  I hate that a family of 5 leaves spends $65 on burgers or bbq and a few soft drinks."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?! This place is unbelievable!!!! The whole table was quite while eating, because we were so engulfed in our delicious mouth watering meal. Hands down the best BBQ in town!! So much variety on your plate and so much flavor in every side dish! I left here stuffed and happy!"}
{"text":"Over rated, long lines and expensive for the portion sizes. I love their sister restaurant across the street Z Liberty Market but Joe's is not my favorite"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best BBQ there is. We went for my mothers Birthday on the 14th and the line was out the door by the time we sat down.I would definitely recommend to a friend or any out of towners that come to town.  Favorite meat choice would be the pulled pork meat plate. The mac & Cheese is Delicious as well as their homemade cookies."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed. Although the bbq was decent the portions were small and the sides were terrible. It felt like a tourist trap and unless someone else is driving me there and paying I'll never return."}
{"text":"I guess you love it or you hate it. Cant say I enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Wow what a great place for freakin' good BBQ. When you walk in to Joe's you might think you are in a woodland area where the beasts of the forest are having a meat smoking and grilling festival because the place looks crazy, like it's built out of trees and it's all decorated for halloween or christmas or whatever season it is, but nope - you're just in Joe's REAL BBQ, and I can promise you first hand that THE BBQ IS ACTUALLY REAL, LET THERE BE NO DOUBT.

The service here is good, and they are friendly enough, and you can see all of the food which tempts the mind and taste buds, and if you're like me, you're going to end up ordering almost everything because it all looks so good.

The one down-side to this place is it's not always the cleanest joint, like sometimes you'll want to sit at a table but then you'll say \"Oh buddy, wait - not this one, because it looks like someone else just ate here and I don't want to get some other person's BBQ sauce on my arms.\" but you can just go to another table. It's not like it's unsanitary or anything.

This place is right across the street from another incredible BBQ joint: Rudy's. Which one is better? Here's how I decide:
Do you want the focus of your meal to be the delicious meats? Go to Rudy's.
Do you want the focus of your meal to be the delicious sides? Go to Joe's.

I'm not saying either place doesn't have good meats or sides, but Joe's wins the sides contest, and Rudy's wins the plain ol' meat contest. Heck, these places are so close you could probably just walk across the street and get the best of both. I am honestly surprised that these two places have not gotten into more of a bitter competition. In my youth I was involved in a similar situation where several young people lost their lives due to the BBQ war that occurred, so I guess it is for the best that you choose one place or the other, and not tempt fate by visiting both."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the area hands down!! Fresh meat prepared daily so get there early! Mac and cheese...... Redonkulous!! Only downside is no alcoholic beverages:(  Despite that and no tv's, theres a huge outdoor seating area that looks like your grandmas backyard (minus the swing set) that makes for a real comfortable dining experience. 5 stars all day!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in all of Phoenix!!! The to-go window makes this place perfect for any time I need my fix!!! The sliced chicken breast is basically eating pieces of heaven."}
{"text":"Joe's Real Barbecue is located in the amazingly re-beautified downtown Gilbert district. I realize that this place is no secret, but after my last visit the other day, I thought I should review them. I love this establishment. It has a comfortable country atmosphere and a very nice outdoor recreation area. The food is great and very reasonably priced. I got the barbecue sampler. That's 3/4 lbs of meat (chicken, ribs, brisket and pork) plus one side and two slices of homemade bread. All of this for under $13. The meats are cooked over pecan wood and have a lovely sweet flavor. There are two sauces to choose from. The \"I dare you sauce\" (made with habaneros) is my favorite. Watch out for this one though. It is sweet and spicy. The more you have the more the heat intensifies! I enjoyed a side of their terrific barbecue beans... Great. The homemade bread had rosemary in it, it think. Awesome. Homemade root beer is great too. It can be very difficult to get drink refills since the soda machines are accessed from the ordering line (which can seemingly stretch for a mile). All in all, great atmosphere, great food. Joe's restaurants always satisfy. Don't forget to checkout Joe's Farm Grill, and Liberty Market. These are Joe's other fine gems."}
{"text":"Excellent food, the only problem is that everyone else know this and it is really crowded!!

So, be prepared for a wait in line during certain busy times."}
{"text":"Joe's has a great atmosphere and is good to bring my kids.  I like the outdoor eating option and the area for kids to be able to get up and walk around.

Food is very good.  The best plates I have had are the ribs, pulled pork and chopped brisket. Sides are pretty good,  The beans are the best option with the mac n cheese a close second.  

The setup makes it a little challenging to get drink refills.  The biggest issue is if you get a water.  With the small cup they give you, it is a pain to get to the drink area and get more water.

Overall it is a great place to eat and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I don't get it. The food was pricey and fatty. Maybe I hit them on a bad day. Not sure."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows bbq, knows Joe's.  You can't miss it.  It's the original neon sign in downtown gilbert, with the arrow, and tempting reminder to \"Eat at Joe's.\"  

They have these amazingly huge baked potatoes...big enough that I wonder what they feed those suckers to make then a pound or more each.  I easily get two or three meals out of each one, and nothing beats a left over potato from Joe's, trust me.  Get it with meat on top.  The turkey breast is always spot on, and the turkey jalepeno sausage is awesome.  Once you get your tater, make sure to load up on the extras, like bbq sauce, (regular or spicy), marinated onions, and mild & spicy peppers.  You'll want to make sure you get extra for your leftovers.  No normal person can finish that potato, especially with meat on top.  I know everyone talks about the ribs, but trust me, the tater is where it's at.    

I do have to dock a star for a cheese issue.  For whatever reason, they've gotten super stingy with the cheese lately.  If you're going to give me a loaded baked potato the size of my head, atleast put more than 2 shreds of cheese on it."}
{"text":"Went here with local during the Superbowl. THE BEST BBQ EVER!! Im talking in the USA people! I am a BBQ connoisseur(OH, GA, NY, CA, WA, CO, MI, MT, HI)  and this place is the BOMB! I will be planning my next trip to AZ with this place in mind!"}
{"text":"Joes is the ULTIMATE in BBQ!!  This and comfortable atmosphere is secoQnd ONLY to the BEST BBQ, baked potatoes, salads...you name it.  Bring every friend/ family member who comes to visit and they concur!  I have brought people that live here in AZ and they are TOTALLY amazed themselves and remain loyal customers-- spreading the news!  LOVE JOES!!!!!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Joe's for 10+ years, and prefer it to most other Q places, but the sides--which are ok but not great--haven't changed since it opened, and prices are high. Yesterday we got a pound of pulled pork to go, with an extra 4-oz container of sauce, and were charged $15+!

We'll keep going, but only because the flavor is close to the Southern-style we're used to, and not as frequently as before."}
{"text":"The only place I can get my kids to be quiet for 5 min! Brisket is good mmmmmk!"}
{"text":"Just like it bother Joes Farm Grill, this is the best food in town. I love going here. Especially on my birthday for the free meal."}
{"text":"Love.  It.  Awesome pulled pork, brisket, turkey.  The sides are really good, too.  I feel like it's somewhat expensive, but it's worth every bite, but then again, that's BBQ.  If it's dirt cheap, that means it's not quality meat.

Anyway, the 2-pound potato is great, too -- chives, sour cream, butter...."}
{"text":"I had their sampler ny previous and it was AMAZING! The portions are very generous and he price was just right. Never dry, always flavorful!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, always look forward to coming here."}
{"text":"Different BBQ experience than we expected. We all shared the BBQ sampler with two sides which was plenty of food for the 5 of us. The chicken was tender and tasty. The brisket was a little bland, which the sauce helped. The ribs were very good. The pulled pork was our least favorite. As BBQ joint go Joes is middle of the pack. Better than famous Daves, but not close to Texas Smokehouse. Just OK"}
{"text":"I've heard about the place before coming to Gilbert. 
I expected much more, but it was a HUGE disappointment. 
I don't know why this place is so famous. 
I know that I'll never visit this restaurant again. 
I would rather go to Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"I have been there a few times. The owner is a gilbert native and a very nice person. The food is of good quality, the atmosphere is great. It is best to visit here during the spring and early summer."}
{"text":"I am not a meat eater.  My husband is the one who loves this place.  He tries pretty much everything on the menu and comes out happy, full and leftovers in hand.  That makes for a happy wife.  I think if he could he would eat there everyday.  I like their giant baked potatoes, cornbread and lemonade.  I haven't made it to the dessert because we're so stuffed by the time we leave."}
{"text":"Traveling across the country several times through, Texas, Georgia and the Carolinas this place is FABULOUS!  The pulled pork, brisket and turkey are the best I have had.  The cafeteria style serving gives you time to decide, the side dishe selections can't be beat - home made apple sauce is my favorite,  Homemade rootbeer and rootbeer cake are a delight.  The sauce and topping bar allows you to further customize your experience.  Why go to a chain resturant when Joe's is around?"}
{"text":"The food is always wonderful here but my last visit the customer service was kinda disappointing. As I approached the pickup window I saw workers standing around conversing...which I know SOME of them WERE busy working. I sat there outside the window, waiting... looking at the menu wondering if they don't do the to go window all day or what because I waited so long for them to walk up to help me. It literally took them like 4 minutes to come over to the window which one thing is if they thought I was unsure of my order but could have at least acknowledged me. Maybe less chatting and more paying attention to customers at your window?"}
{"text":"This place is printing money and rightfully so. They simply do a bang up job. Best BBQ in AZ."}
{"text":"Nice place, my boyfriend raved about it so he decided to take me here. I love good backed potatoes and he said this place had huge potatoes and great food. I should be fair all I ate was the potatoe and some corn bread; but i can't help but feel I was ripped off. We both got potatoes, cornbread and two drinks and paid $30. I can't believe that. $30 for potatoes? Granted it came with meat on top but hell i could've done that. 

Now taking that into account I have not tried the BBQ as of yet. Looking around though I saw some of the others food and it looked amazing. The place overall has a nice homey and friendly atmosphere. When you walk in the place smells delicious and the place was so busy. I will be back if only to try those ribs I saw someone else order they looked great. The cornbread and honey butter as well are my favorite. I would like to take just a pan of that stuff. 

Overall I feel it was pricy for what I got but the food was still good. The place seems jumpin in the sense of customers coming and the food from specualtion alone looks worthy of a 4 star rating. Just wish it were a little cheaper but you pay for quality right. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"As always a great experience 
The brisket smoke ring was perfect
And the sides were tasty
I would recommend this place for good BBQ and a really cool vibe"}
{"text":"I hope it was an off day.....1st time to Joe's real average bbq.  Ordered the meat sampler.  Chicken has that fake costco previously frozen taste to it and doesn't go well with the sauce.  The seasoning isn't all that appetizing either and doesn't compliment the meat.  Brisket and pulled pork were both overcooked and dry so you have to use the bbq sauce to save them.  The ribs would have been the best part but they had so much fat on them that I ended up spitting half of them out.  All the reviews are from locals who obviously have not had real bbq.  You poor souls"}
{"text":"Wow has this place gone downhill.  We used to love Joe's but the last few time we went the ribs were so dry and fatty.  I know, you're probably asking, how can that be?  Dry and fatty?  I can't answer that but oh, it be.  Time before last, Joe's gave us an apologetic gift card so that was really nice.  Went back and used the gift card and, again, received gross ribs.  The mac and cheese is still good but as for BBQ ribs, we will go elsewhere.  Sorry :-("}
{"text":"Best BBQ ever, every item on the menu is amazing.  No matter the drive, I will always trek out to Gilbert. Don't forget to try the desserts."}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ place in the valley. Quality is always consistent and service it top notch. I normally order to go, never had issues with orders being wrong like other places which provide take out."}
{"text":"Love this place the food and the atmosphere are always awesome! I usually go for the ribs they are fall off the bone delicious"}
{"text":"Delicious food!!! Love this place! I always get the pulled pork. Their bbq pit beans are to die for!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite barbecue restaurant. The interior has a very comfortable country feel and I love it. You can't get that anywhere else really. The food was delicious and their brisket was juicy and the perfect smoky flavor. Will be back for sure. I went her for a birthday celebration with friends and we all had a great time with awesome food and a super fun environment. I suggest gettting the Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"I generally am not into places that have a lot of hype, but I tried this place a few years ago and it's my favorite.  It's a little bit of  a drive so I don't make it there more than every few months, but I love it and have yet to find a place that I like in Arizona that compares.  I usually get the sampler plate if I'm eating in.  On times when I'm over in that end of town I order a sandwich through the window and have either pulled pork or brisket.

The picnic tables on the porch are nice for big groups and it's pleasant  to eat outside when the weather is nice with their grass lawn with the little white fence and a view of Gilbert's \"downtown\".

Sometimes it can be a bit of a long line if you go at peak times, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"We drove 48 miles to check out Joe's Real BBQ because my husband watches Check Please on PBS. \"WHAT A DISAPPOINT\".  We ordered the Meat Plate, with Ribs and Brisket. The Ribs had sliver of bone. I was told by a butcher that happens when the ribs are crop wrong and the brisket was just okay. It came with a piece of bread. I think it was some kind of herb bread. The herb was overpowering and it burned the inside of our mouths, it left a floral after taste.  We got two sides, the Cheesy Potatoes and the Mac n' Cheese, nothing worse than eating cold Mac n' Cheese and Cheesy Potatoes but honestly I don't think they would have tasted any better hot. The Root Beer Cake was dry. Was was shocked to see the dessert cut on plates and not wrapped in saran wrap. They just cut the Lemon Cake it was very good. The place is busy so there are some people think the food is good or it could be they have a wonderful outside area with tables and games. Good place for families with kids."}
{"text":"Joe's is the epitome of efficiency. I've never had a problem with the service. Once I brought home the wrong order from take out, but they more they made good on it. I've tried a few other bbq places in the valley and other places can come close in food quality, but they just can't nail the whole package you get at Joe's. Pulled pork and brisket are my favorites. 
My only gripes are  - the crappy bread you get with the meat plates, and that you have to berate the take out window people to get enough of the bbq sauce. 1 oz of sauce for a 2 meat plate?? come on!"}
{"text":"Our family had Joe's BBQ this sunday, and it was amazing as always.  I had the meat plate with brisket.  It was cooked perfect with just the right amount of rub and crisp edges.  

My wife had a stuffed baked potato with sausage.  Her potato was gigantic, and we each had enough for a leftover meal at home.

Our total including drinks was just over $30 which is a nice price for a lovely dinner out.  I gave this a five star review as the only negative to the entire meal was the soda tasted a bit flat.  

We've gone there many times so we know the taste of their small batch soda and we think the machine was running low on CO2 when we were there yesterday.  We didn't complain or anything and just enjoyed our meal with limited drinks.  I won't hold this against them as I imagine the cannister was refilled shortly after we got our drinks, and we just didn't want to wait in line for a refill.

Thanks for another great meal"}
{"text":"No matter who, as long as they eat meat...this is a good decision.

Try it all. 

The food is a bit pricy for the cafeteria feel, but that's par for the course with all BBQ places in AZ."}
{"text":"Food, so so.  What kind of a bbq joint doesn't serve beer?  Must be a Gilbert hangup.  Off to Rudy's!"}
{"text":"I love bbq food and this place was super good. I was expecting a little bit more food compared to the price, kind of like Dickies or Famous Daves. But the meat and the sides tasted great!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love, It's rare a restaurant group can have solid entries in multiple categories but in the case of our friends at the Joe's family, they have done it. Joe's Real BBQ does not disappoint. The big downside is no alcohol, however, order ahead, pick it up and head home. 

I have been in with just my husband, a group for a family dinner, taken out for just myself and for a party of 8 and have been pleased every time. It does get busy at peak hours and it's very much like traditional BBQ places in the south as in, you stand in line at the counter, get your food and off you go to your table. The homemade sauces, especially the spicy, are great and they also have nice homemade root beer. 

I wish they had more side dish options but the ones they have are very good. I almost always get the stuffed baker (hi, giant baked potato with bbq meat on top, how is this bad?!) but I have tried nearly everything on the menu via my husband, family and friends. 

These people also are soooo friendly and helpful. I called the three hours before a large party and needed a bunch of food ready and waiting and they said \"no problem\" and it wasn't. It was all ready when I went to pick it up with extra things of sauce thrown in. Prices are fair, too."}
{"text":"I must say this place is great...you probably don't want to eat it every night for dinner, but the 1st time you go here you may want too! The line tends too go out the door often! Thankfully they have a to-go window on the side...Love The Pulled-Pork Sandwiches! I think I had been the #1 order when I was pregnant...I truly love this place & don't forget the other restaurants!!!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here...WHY?!  It is WELL worth the drive.  My little bro, who is/was a picky eater would dine 3 times a day, 7 days a week here if he could (once he starts driving I'm not sure we'll see him around, ha!).

Pecan-smoked onsite, even the restrooms are permeated with the aroma.  Hot links and brisket (sliced) w/ mac and cheese make up my usual.  Root beer is fab, and the choc chip cookies are the best.  And everything is made from scratch."}
{"text":"Good BBQ but don't be fooled into thinking their ribs are as good as Joe's Farm Grill due to common ownership...they're not even close.  Joe's Real BBQ only serves St. Louis ribs where Joe's Farm Grill serves up fabulous baby back ribs.  There's a HUGE difference.  Go to Joe's Farm Grill for ribs.  Go to Joe's Real BBQ for other 'que fare.  

Also tried the interesting sounding Root Beer cake but found it anything but interesting and definitely not Root Beer tasting...so save your money on that item."}
{"text":"My husband and I were told to go their from a local gal. We both got the Jumbo sandwich with chopped brisket on one side and pulled pork on the other. The sandwich was amazing we will be back. Next time I would get all Brisket. Loved the homemade root beer. Prices are reasonable and the cheese potatoes and mac & cheese were great."}
{"text":"Went here with my husband and kids for my birthday. We both ordered the sampler and was told they were out of chicken and they asked what we wanted to substitute which we replied ribs and we were told no to ribs. Apparently when they run out of stuff they punish the client for it, especially when paying $14 for a plate. We complained to what appeared to be the manager and he looked at my husband and walked away. One of the plates received was not what was ordered and when we finally sat down to eat it was cold. Too many better bbq places for better prices. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Nothing beats good Barbecue and Joe's Real BBQ in Gilbert is one of the best around. A wide selection of choice meats, smoked on site, delicious sides, home-made root beer and lemonade and a yard for the kids to play in make you feel like it's Sunday at Grandma's house.

It is difficult to describe our favorite menu item since everything is so wonderful. But the pulled pork and the hot links seem to grace my plate most often. We have yet to have a disappointing meal at Joe's Real BBQ and we have been eating here for 10 years!

Service is an order at the counter affair, but orders are prepared very rapidly and once you've ordered you are only moments from enjoying your meal.

The charm of the old building, the cheerfulness of the staff and the high quality of the food make Joe's Real BBQ a must visit for any barbecue lover and their entire family!"}
{"text":"I live close enough to Joe's to be tortured daily by the enticing aroma the smoker emits. My family can pick up dinner here for less than we can at Micky D's (If we don't order drinks) so we often opt for BBQ if we are going to eat out. The food is amazing, the staff is always friendly, and the location can't be beat. I can't wait to try Liberty Market and the Farm Grill."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to this spot and it was as good (if not better) as the first one. 

Some of the ribs were a little overcooked but nothing to complaint about. The baked potatoes were yummy and my daughter (5 yr) finished her pulled pork sandwich, so all in all it was a good experience. the bbq sauce tastes pretty good and it's in a self serving warm container which I believe enhances the flavor.

The price is fair and the place is clean and appealing. 

So why didn't i give it 5 stars? The sides were below lame. The mac and cheese and cheese potatoes were tasteless.

The lemon cake was too sweet for me and the corn bread was good although a little dry.

BTW, this place is always packed, so arrive early or be ready to wait in line a little bit."}
{"text":"The barbecue here is awesome and the food very authentic if you love Southern Barbecue. Love it and go there often. Usually we just pick up so we can buy extra."}
{"text":"My first trip here based off a recommendation from a friend was a big disappointment. I've been all over the country for BBQ and the only thing I can say good about Joe's is that they use real wood smoke. That's it.

The sides (Mac n cheese and cheesy potatoes) were very bland, the pork had no bark at all and was over cooked, and the brisket was really dry, even with sauce on it."}
{"text":"Had the 2 meat plate with brisket and chicken. It was great! Husband had the pulled pork and said it was the best he had ever eaten. I'm from Texas so I am very picky and a tough judge when it comes to BBQ and this is new go-to place for some delicious BBQ. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you're within 100 miles of Gilbert, AZ, (just east of Phoenix), do yourself and your taste buds a favor and head to Joe's Real BBQ. The place is pretty amazing and a lot of fun with lots of outdoor and indoor seating. The food is delicious so bring a big appetite. I had the bbq sampler with homemade cornbread... mmmm good."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ... haven't been here in about 14 years but don't know why. Pulled pork and sliced brisket are amazing. Baked beans were good. Home made root beer was okay but not amazing."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful service! Our family often calls in our order for a pulled pork sandwich and loaded baked potato with lots of Joe's BBQ sauce, yum!

Recently we arrived home with kid size pork sandwiches rather than full size. I totally understand human error and other businesses had left me wanting in the customer service department. I called Joe's BBQ and they were so kind. I was given options to remedy the problem and was mailed a gift card within the week. 
Thank you!"}
{"text":"Didn't eat there today but with all the new trendy places that have opened around here I was so glad to see a line to go into Joes"}
{"text":"After a year in Portland, Oregon we have found a single spot for decent BBQ, and it was much more expensive than Joe's for much less food. We will struggle on here in the Rose City (loving the city just not the lack of good BBQ) as we continue to pine away for Joe's..."}
{"text":"The giant stuffed baked potatoes are super! The sandwiches and sampler platter are tasty too!

Their red cream soda is a find!

Lines are long, but they move fast...well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local businesses. All day, everyday, the BBQ Sampler with 2 sides. I've never ordered anything else. The meat falls off the bone. The chicken is juicy. The brisket is tender. 

So they get the mandatory basics down, bomb a** BBQ! But whoa whoa there, don't stop at the meat. They have tasty sides that perfectly compliment the BBQ. Again all day, everyday the Mac & Cheese. Always pick that. From there you can go wild with the different options but get the Mac & Cheese, unless you hate America and good food, then get 2 sides of beans or something. 

They also have a baked potato that I've had about 2 times, it's bigger than a Chipotle burrito, with more butter than I care eat, and covered in sea salt on the skin, but it leaves me scraping the foil at the end with nothing left in sight. 

2 more things to discuss, the BBQ sauce and root beer float. 

BBQ Sauce is awesome. I even picked up a bottle to keep at home when I make my own pulled pork sandwiches. The \"I Dare You\" sauce it what always gets smothered on my BBQ and satisfies my native Arizona craving for spiciness. 

If you have room (you won't if you eat that whole sampler), skip the line, go straight to the guy/gal behind the register and order yourself the root beer float. Perfect way to top off an amazing meal. 

Pro tip: They have take out boxes by the BBQ sauce, grab one, eat 1/2 your sampler and you'll get to enjoy a 2nd serving of Joe's at home and you won't have to waddle back to your car from eating so much. 

The last note: I also love this place because a year ago I took an amazing photo of the restaurant after a storm with a big rainbow in the background and tweeted it to them. So my surprise I found that photo in rotation on the TV when your waiting in line and they gave me credit  (desertDJproductions.com) and it's still there today."}
{"text":"Best place to Eat!  When I want good barbecue  I go here, always enjoyed  this place."}
{"text":"Great food and relaxed atmosphere. I had a sampler plate and my favorite was probably the pulled pork and the ribs. The mac and cheese is possibly the best I've ever tasted! We will definitely be back but maybe to get takeout because the line to get in can get long."}
{"text":"Considering my affinity for Joe's Farm, Joe's BBQ was a real disappointment for three reasons. 

First, Joe's BBQ fails to live up to the expectations set by its sister restaurant, Joe's Farm. 

Second, the potential downside of venturing to someplace new is not simply a disappointing meal. The double-whammy is knowing you would have been happier elsewhere. Such as Joe's Farm.

Third, the ribs I ordered and partially ate were fatty and cold. The latter attribute was probably a result of the cafeteria-style format, which admittedly is not in my wheelhouse. Given that I ate here at 8 PM on a Friday night, I'm surprised that my meal had not been warmed over.

Joe's Farm is phenomenal, and well worth a mini-trek to Gilbert. Joe's BBQ is not."}
{"text":"Phoenix area doesn't have the best BBQ joints but I consider joes and little miss BBQ prolly the best in the valley. I've had joes multiple times and it's always solid. I usually get the sampler but sometimes I get the brisket sandwich or their loaded naked potatoes. There are usually long lines but it's served cafeteria style and the line moves pretty fast. I would say pulled pork, brisket, and chicken are A grade but the pork ribs are B grade. Overall still solid and would recommend this place...."}
{"text":"Always a great place to eat! Love the food, love the atmosphere and love the ambience! My favorite place in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ Sauce ever! Better than Sweet Baby Rays. Awesome pulled pork sandwich. Great prices."}
{"text":"This food was fantastic! The line was a tad long, and for someone with a hip issue, that part was not enjoyable. Normally my husband would have just ordered for me, but since this was our first time there, I wanted to see everything and choose what I wanted from there. 
I ordered just the baked potato, and the thing was HUGE!! I was told you can ask for as much toppings as you wanted, but I just let them do their thing. I next time I'll as for more sour cream and butter =)
My husband had a pulled pork sandwich. He had said that he would have liked more sauce on it, and instead of getting just a side of sauce, he would bring his whole sandwich up to the sauce.
Over all, it was delicious, but I would have liked to know how it worked before we had gone. maybe this will help future newbies when they go. 
also.... bring someone who know what they want, and order it for them while they go and steal a table as soon as they can. It gets super busy for dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Joe's is a family tradition for us. As a young married couple we frequented Joe's with my wife's grandparents. They were die hard Joe's fans. I love the atmosphere. The farm mural on the wall conveys the thoughts of a simpler time. Combine that with some comfort food Mac and cheese and a pulled pork sandwich slow cooked over pecan and I'm done. The baked potatoes aren't as big as your head, they are as big as MY head. And that's saying something! Size 8 hat here. The desserts are all fatteningly fantastic. The homemade bbq sauce comes in regular and hot. It's not too hot, give it a try. They have gluten free buns but you can always just get a baked potato with smoked meat. Just work through the menu. Everything is amazing. Joe's is a local legend because it's consistently wonderful. If the weather is nice sit out back and play some corn hole. Come on your birthday and you get $10 off. You can't beat that."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Joe's out. It's right in my neighborhood and all the high reviews on Yelp had me convinced and my mouth ready for some awesome BBQ. I parked in the 15 minute parking conveniently located right in front of a walk up window on the side of the restaurant. I was ordering to go. I ordered the combo plate: chicken, ribs, beef and a hotlink. I asked for an extra side of their hot bbq sauce since I noticed only one small side of sauce was provided. For my two sides I chose coleslaw and the beans. The service was super fast and the girl taking my order was very pleasant. 5 stars for customer service. My two stars is for the taste/quality of the food. The worst was the coleslaw. Very dry and lacked flavor. The best of all the items were the beans and the beef brisket. The ribs were ok, tender, but too much fat on them. The hotlinks weren't good in my opinion. If i see chunks of fat in my sausage usually not good to me. Didn't taste great either. I expect for a restaurant to make better bbq than I can. But Joe's failed that test. The bbq sauce was not poured all over the ribs, instead I was given a small side. The sauce was pretty good, i wish i would have asked for more. The bread was good, i believe it was rye. She failed to give me a napkin or a fork to use to eat my to go order, but luckily I was headed home to eat anyways. I don't want to discourage you from going here. Maybe your taste buds may be delighted. Mine were not. Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Have you ever been to Luby's? Well if you have, think Luby's with bbq food and no lady walking around refreshing your coffee or tea. That is Joes. Look if I had people in from out of town, I would drive them by and say this place was on food network, now lets go somewhere else to eat!

I really don't want to be mean, but there was nothing that great about this place. And yes the chicken breast was processed! I was a little grossed out, and the sides were blah!

This cookie that someone on yelp raved about.. dry and ehh. It was no paradise or tammie co cookie.

Joe I think your ideas are great and enjoyed Liberty Market. I still really want to try the Farm Grill, but am a little hesitant."}
{"text":"We tried the sliced beef brisket BBQ sandwich with coleslaw and beans. It was all very delicious! We enjoyed the cafeteria style food service and seating. The customer service was phenomenal. Plus, they make homemade root beer! This meal was a treat that left us very satisfied. Give it a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"BBQ sampler is great. Highly recommend. Food is very good especially the beef brisket."}
{"text":"Yup, Yup, and Yupper!!! You can not go wrong here!  I smothered a giant baked potato with pulled pork, baked beans and Joe's BBQ sauce oh and a side of Cole Slaw and Wow! HoooWaaaaaah! Nuff said!"}
{"text":"I have once again returned to Joe's this time to sample his BBQ beans and home made rootbeer. I loved every bite and every sip. I also ate a whole slab of ribs by myself so please don't judge me because they were that damn good. Till next time enjoy yourself and indulge."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service at Joe's are great. Very sincere, likeable people. They get the sauce right, they get the sides right (in fact, Joe's pit beans are some of the best I've ever had), and they do make incredible root beer. Regrettably, there's no way I can rate their ribs \"A-OK.\" I've had worse, but I've had MUCH better. They are overcooked to death, dried out and virtually \"CANDIED\" in their sauce. The pork cannot be tasted at all and has no texture, just dry mush under a hard carmelized exterior. Sort of reminds me of the babyback ribs at Ruby Tuesdays. Sorry, Joe."}
{"text":"Went for early pre-meeting dinner so not crowded at all.  Easy, free street parking and access.  All of the staff are very friendly.  The bbq chicken sandwich was very good.  I really enjoy good cornbread and I would have to call theirs average.  The ribs look delicious, so I will need to try them when I do not have to worry about a making a mess before going yo a meeting!"}
{"text":"We have been missing good BBQ, since we are from Houston, Tx. This place fits the bill. We split the sampler plate, which consisted of chicken, brisket, ribs, pulled pork and one side. We chose cheesy potatoes and beans as an extra side. Everything was delicious. We also tried the lemon cake, which was good, and the sweet potato pie, which was not to my taste.
Friendly staff and clean restaurant.
We will be back."}
{"text":"Joe's is one my favorite restaurants. It's my go-to for a great casual dining experience with a group of family or friends.

I can't say the barbecue is the best I've ever had, and in Gilbert, Arizona, I wouldn't expect it to be. Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's just good. This inconsistency keeps Joe's from earning the five star review I would love to give it. Their homemade root beer is great but I never get it because they serve my favorite bottled ginger ale, Boylan's (they score quite a few points for having a nice variety of bottled sodas). Their chocolate chip cookies are incredible, especially when they're warm (they bake them in small batches so they often are). Again, the barbecue isn't always amazing, but with great sides and soda and dessert offerings, you can always expect a great meal at Joe's.

The atmosphere is perfect for a barbecue joint (better than the better-tasting barbecue joints I've dined at in Kansas City), and the staff is always super friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"The ribs are awesome! They have a citrus taste to them. The pulled pork sandwich is really good too. The soda set up is a little annoying and it can be really slow when it's crowded but it's a great place to go if you're having a BBQ craving."}
{"text":"Still the BEST BBQ in town!!  The Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket were GREAT!  I'm not quite sure why they have knives there...completely unnecessary!  The BBQ Sauces are freshly made and heated."}
{"text":"If you're a carnivore and anywhere near Joe's in Gilbert, AZ, you owe it to yourself to come buy yourself a bottle of their secret recipe barbeque sauce.  The barbeque here is rockin but that SAUCE....damn it's good!  So good, that I walked over here from my mom's house one evening and bought a bottle to bring home with me.

I had to check my baggage because of that bottle but it was worth it!!!  Go getcha some.  I got the spicy it's soooo good."}
{"text":"This place has the best BBQ in town. They catered our wedding and if your looking for an affordable price this is the place to consider. 2 side with 3 means well under 3,000 bucks!"}
{"text":"the bbq was good and i love the outside patio area to sit in during the nice weather season we have here. 

The price was just right and everyone seemed friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome food, really neat atmosphere.  I've never been disappointed with a meal here. A gem within gilbert.  If you're looking for something unique, that's not a huge chain, this is the place to go"}
{"text":"Charming 1940s BBQ meets 21st century pace of life! Ordered brisket (chopped and regular) and chicken breast with sides (cheesy potatoes, mac n cheese, and baked beans). All meats and sides cooked well and were tasty. Perhaps if I was from the South I'd have more to compare BBQ with, but seeing that I am not, this place, overall, has good food and atmosphere; am a regular patron."}
{"text":"This is one of my very favorite BBQ places.  I have tried just about everything on the menu and have never been disappointed.  I tell everyone about Joe's.  The staff is always friendly and I love the atmosphere.  We always enjoy going to Joe's."}
{"text":"We are frequent customers @joes and have always liked the food. Tonight we made the mistake of coming in less than hour prior to their closing ( which 9pm on Friday night seems a little ridiculous anyway). We came for Ribs...you know Bar B Que! Doesn't seem unreasonable since that is what they sell. No ribs! I ordered  combo plate which I cannot usually finish and there was hardly any meat on it. My husband was half done eating and the person tried to take his plate. The staff was obviously very anxious to get the Customers out right at 9 even though people came in right up to 9! Very unsatisfying meal and overall experience! Sad and disappointing !"}
{"text":"Knowing now, I wish this would have been my first stop for bbq in the East Valley. The portions are huge, lots of sides to choose from and totally a cute atmosphere. The smoked turkey is downright craveable."}
{"text":"Since I travel for work the one thing I look for is a good B-B-Q place. This one is PRIMO! I had the pulled pork sandwich with the corn and fresh fruit. The pork was delicious! Flavorful and well cooked. The B-B-Q sauce was great but I had to add more and there is plenty in those BIG canisters. The corn is a mix of yellow and white corn. And, yes, I had fruit. It was fresh and cut into manageable pieces.

This place must be visited if you like good B-B-Q."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by several locals & it didn't disappoint. Cafeteria  style place with ample indoor/outdoor seating. We went during the week so it wasn't too busy but I imagine on the weekends this place is packed. This is BBQ not grilled meat. Brisket was on point, pulled pork was moist & the ribs were fall off the bone. Chicken skin wasn't bite thru, links were mediocre. We had beans & mac/chz sides which were delicious.  Cole slaw & potato salad didn't look appealing to try. You must have the freshly homemade root beer when you go. This place is legit barbecue & won't leave you hungry."}
{"text":"Fits the bbq needs but is not worth the prices for a family. $2.50 for a non-refillable soda when the food is on the overpriced side was a little much. We'll stick to coming here on out birthday when you get $10 off. That makes it about right."}
{"text":"The place is cute, the line was extremely long but it went pretty fast. They had a lot of options for everything.  I would have given them a 5 star but I feel like it was missing something, just not sure what. I will be going back on my birthday for all you can eat $10."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots. The sampler platter is the way to go, everything is so good it is hard to choose, so choose it all! The apple sauce is unreal, my girlfriend ordered it and I laughed at her... but now she's laughing at me for eating at all.

I wish they built one of these on the west side instead of Rudy's... you guys do the bbq thing MUCH better."}
{"text":"Really good food. The BBQ is delicious! You would have to be really picky to not like the food here. They have big portions with their platters. Love the old school drinks/sodas they have.l too. 

Service is great. It's a busy place and the employees are always working hard. Props to them. 

They do free food on customer appreciation day and a free meal for your birthday!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ, Very Sourthern style , but I like dave's more."}
{"text":"Joe's is one of my favorite Sunday \"Good Eats\" spots. The cafeteria line ordering process makes obtaining and eating food super easy and quick, not to mention you don't have to tip! The food is always consistently great. I like to try the specials whenever I can. This past Sunday I tried the BBQ Hot Wings Special, it was good but I think I prefer the Brisket and Pulled Pork better. Even though the meat does not need it always get a side a BBQ, trust me you won't regret it. There's two house made BBQ sauces, Regular & Spicy. The portions are really big so I would suggest automatically getting a to-go box and putting half of your food away so you can have room for dessert, Yum Yum! A little pricey but what good BBQ isn't."}
{"text":"Really good food! Highly recommend going at least once. At first I thought it was expensive for what you get but I was totally wrong (my eyes always seem bigger than my stomach when I'm hungry) I've only had the brisket, pulled pork and chicken and all were great! I wasn't a huge fan of the chopped brisket in sauce. The Mac and cheese wasn't to die for but still really good!"}
{"text":"Great food, absolutely. However, it's pretty expensive for what you get.  Got the sampler, and while they say it's 3/4 of a pound, it doesn't seem like that much considering it's 14 bucks with a drink.  

I still think Kinfolks is better, especially with how much food you get for the price.  But hey, Joes was great, and I would more than happily go again."}
{"text":"I debated going with 3 stars, but settled on two since 3 is supposed to mean \"A-OK\".  First, the good things:
1) great homemade rootbeer and rootbeer floats, with 25 cent refills
2) Set up to handle large group events
3) Free/discounted meal on your birthday.
4) The smell of the pecan smokers is amazing.
5) The staff was very friendly

Unfortunately, the food is not so great.  We were 2 couples, both of whom are serious BBQ lovers.  I cure my own ham and bacon, make my own sausages, and smoke not only meats but also cheeses and other items.  And since Seattle isn't exactly a BBQ mecca, we make a point of trying as much BBQ as possible on our yearly visits to Phoenix.  We've found several great places here, but Joe's won't warrant a return visit.

Bruce and I each had the sampler plate, my wife Kim had the two item plate with turkey and pulled pork, and Steph had the two item plate with chicken and the jalapeno sausage.  For side dishes we had beans, cheesy potatoes, and mac-n-cheese.
- brisket, pork and ribs were all overcooked and slightly dry.
- the sausage was OK, but nothing to write home about
- the chicken was the best of the meats, moist and tasty, but not particularly smoky
- the side dishes were mediocre, and most went unfinished.  Of them, the corn (plain kernel corn) was OK, and the beans were pretty good.
- the rootbeer cake was dry and unmemorable, perhaps because the slices are precut and sitting out in the dry air on the cafeteria style serving line.

So if you are in Mesa/Gilbert and looking for quick BBQ, you can get a decent sized serving at a fair price here, but you'll be unlikely to be wowed by the food.  If you really love BBQ, consider hopping back in the car and driving to Bobby Q, Texas BBQ House, or even Rudy's, all of whom do an amazing job of delivering fresh, moist meats with a great smoke flavor."}
{"text":"We recently used Joe's Real BBQ for a wedding dinner. We were extremely pleased with the professional ordering process. We love the wonderful food initially, then add to that, great, on time delivery and set up! It was seamless and perfectly timed. And our guests loved the food! We would recommend Joe's very highly. Try them with confidence and savor the amazing food!"}
{"text":"Joe's BBQ is a fun family friendly place. Their meats are very tender & flavorful. For the pricing the portion sizes are a little smaller than I thought they should have been. The service is great & so is the food. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Joe's for many years and I love the food...I hate waiting in line to get it though. However, it's worth waiting for, especially the chopped brisket! I also love the bbq beans and macaroni and cheese sides. This is my favorite barbecue place in the area!"}
{"text":"I really can't say enough great things about Joe's.  I moved to Phoenix in October and I discovered this place a few weeks later.  This is by far some of the best BBQ I've ever had.  Their brisket is lean, their sausage is amazing and their sides are incredible.  The baked beans are like candy! The only thing is I wish they had collard greens or green beans.  The sides are all carbs, so I have to refrain most of the time.  But, their baked potatoes are 1 lb each and the fixing are awesome.  If you're in Phoenix please visit Joe's in Downtown Gilbert, it's the best thing you'll do all day!"}
{"text":"This is a Gilbert staple. If you haven't need, it is a must go. If you e been, then you already know that it's a great place. Great for dates or family outings. Lines move quickly, even when they are 50 people long. Tons of seating. Easy parking. I love the pulled pink and the brisket but everything is great. If you like sweets, get the root beer float and the chocolate chip cookies!"}
{"text":"Friendly people and the best pulled pork I've ever had at a restaurant. I haven't been anywhere in the BBQ belt but it's way better than Lucilles. Every now and then in the sandwich you get some of the smoked, charred crust. F***ing magical."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with Robyn N. ,Arlin B. and Rand H. Well the food was ok but not as good as some of the other B.B.Q. places I have tried. I liked Bobby Q and Andrews better and they are a lot closer to where I live. The staff were friendly and service was quick . This place seems to have quite a lot of fans but to me it is only A-OK ."}
{"text":"This place is a real bbq treat. The meats are smoked just fine, the beans are perfection. Atmosphere is great, prices affordable. They offer an Impressive quality of meat and love is truly cooked into almost everything served here. The sauces are very good as well and I brought one home with me.  P"}
{"text":"Really disappointed.  After the rave reviews.... the brisket has a texture of rubber and the potaoe salad was blah.  Good job on the bread and hot links.  Seriously expected more after enjoying the sister restaraunt so much.   Also the set up of the drink station is poorly placed as people kept pushing through the line to get refills."}
{"text":"A great place with a great product.  The pulled pork is amazing and the ribs are as well.  The baked potato with a massive glob of butter and sour cream is about as good as it gets when topped with ham or pulled pork. 

I love the soda selection and the homemade rootbeer is cool although too sweet for my taste.  Great spot if you have kids even more so when it is nice outside so they can run around and climb trees etc.  

On the down side they only have two sauces both of which are the dark sweet stuff.  One is mild and the other is hot.  I wish they had some additional (perhaps vinegar based) choices considering you are a BBQ shop.   Lastly I know they are shooting for a family atmosphere but they do not serve any beer.  It is not the place you hang out in after you are done eating so I really fail to understand why they do not support local micro-brewers in the area.  Oh man....thinking hard now about a Four Peaks 8th Street Ale with a \"Jumbo All Pork!\"

Dear Lord I will never be thin!"}
{"text":"This place is BOMB! My boyfriend and I got a full meal--bbq, lemonade, and dessert--for $25.

And that's just the first good thing about it. We got the combo BBQ plate and it was all so delicious; I wouldn't be able to pick which was best. We had BBQ beans on the side and it was a colorful, flavorful, salty medley. Savory flavored bread comes on the side too. 

But wait--there's more! Hot apple crisp with vanilla ice cream on top? Crumbly, crispy, with cinnamon-y apple slices. SO GOOD. 

Would recommend this place to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"I've lived in Gilbert 15 years, and everyone kept pointing to Joe's and telling me that this is where the real food is.  The long lines running out the door seemed a ringing endorsement, but also kept me out of the joint for awhile.  A friend came in from out-of-town and we agreed to meet there at opening.  Between our three families, we had 13 kids to satisfy.  We snagged a long table that I'm glad was available and got in line, which was already starting to form.  I grabbed a tray and immediately realized I was not going to be able to get more than three kids meals at a time.  The drink fountain features a good selection of products, including hand-made root-beer.  Fantastic for the kids.  The orders were flying, and at first I was concerned but quickly realized that the crew at Joe's works like the finely tuned John Deere tractor  that graced the cafeteria style dining room.  The plates were big and well filled, and a bit of a challenge to get situated on the tray I had, but I quickly paid and was off to the table to drop the food and return for food for my wife and I.  The line was starting to get a bit longer, but it was worth the wait.  The brisket and pork I had were unbeatable.  There were a couple of sauces available, along with a condiment bar, but honestly I needed neither.  I quickly scarfed my food, chugged my root beer, and realized the one failing Joe's has.  I wanted a refill for my soda, and I wanted dessert for the kids....but the line at this point was up to the door and growing.  I couldn't see a way to politely get to the soda fountain, so instead, we went our way, incredibly full but slightly thirsty.  If you don't mind crowds, this place is awesome.  They have a side window for picking up food that seems to be a sort of secret operation...so if you want to dodge the crowds I'd get it to go and feast at home.  
If you're a BBQ-phile, check out the smokers on the north side of the building.  They are a wonder to behold."}
{"text":"Joe's Real BBQ is one of my favorite places. Comfort food in a comfort environment served by friendly people - just the best.

Located in downtown Gilbert, the historic brick building is solid and homey. We try to visit at non-peak hours or on weeknights, but if you show up at dinner time on a Friday or Saturday, you'll be greeted with a long line of patrons waiting for their opportunity to step up to the counter to order some tasty fixins :) Despite appearances, the long line does not usually entail a long wait - their counter service team has the process down to a science and they move people through relatively quickly. 

The line moves through the dining room with booth style tables to one side and large wooden tables to the other side through the center. Once you reach the front of the line, you make your way past a selection of bottled drinks and up to a soda fountain complete with fresh brewed root beer and home made lemonade (my pick) Grab a tray, napkins, and utensils, then slide on up to the counter. You place your order and move forward while they prepare it. By the time you reach the selection of desserts, your meat and side are landing on the glass top in front of you. I usually go for the BBQ sandwich meal, as it is just enough - 1/4 lb of meat on a bun + 1 side dish. My typical meat of choice is the Chopped Pork, although when I'm trying to be \"healthy\" (ha!) I also enjoy the extremely moist chicken and turkey offerings as well. As far as side dishes, there's just one choice for me: Cheesy Potatoes. Usually served lukewarm, they're cheesy with just a hint of spice and they're delicious. 

Now, the desserts ... I really can't walk away without getting one of their freshly baked chocolate chip cookies: the chips are usually still melty and warm. However, their Rootbeer cake is incredibly moist with a unique, yummy flavor and just a hint of frosting, and my husband loves their lemon cake. They also have a to-die-for corn bread served with honey butter, but I often skip it as I'm so carbed up from everything else I've already ordered (darn) 

Don't forget the barbecue sauce! I am actually aghast to say that the first time I had Joe's, I didn't like it! This was because I had the original barbecue sauce, which I've discovered is just too sweet for me. Once I learned about the spicy habenero barbecue sauce, I was good to go - it is delicious and adds the perfect pop of flavor to my sandwich. 

If the weather is nice, skip eating in the dining room and head out to the yard outside. There are rows of picnic tables perched beside a large, grassy lawn which is the perfect place for kids to run around and burn off steam while the adults finish up their meals and chat. The area is bordered by a white picket fence which contains the kiddos from the busy street just beyond, so that you can relax while they play. The whole area is crowned with strings of lights that lend a lovely glow as you dine. If the weather is not-so-nice, I usually try to grab a booth on the far side of the room, so I'm not eating amongst the people standing in line. There is also an enclosed patio area which works well as a hybrid of the two dining experiences - I find that it is a bit noisy usually. 

The restaurant itself is quaint with an obvious Arizona Agriculture theme - my son loves checking out the giant John Deere tractor that holds court at the center of the room, and he often peers longingly into the upcycled fuel pump... now turned into a gumball machine. 

If you're jonesing for Joe's but don't want to wait in line, consider calling ahead and then picking your order up at the window outside - it is a good way to get your fix :) we've also gotten take out for several get togethers that we have hosted/attended and it really takes the pressure off of having to cook because everyone likes Joe's!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize that this place was cafeteria style.  It was late at night so there was no line.  We placed our orders and were served in a few minutes at the cash register.  There are some fun old time bottled sodas to drink.  The bbq itself was very good.  I had the sampler and enjoyed everything - pulled pork, chicken, ribs, and brisket.  The highlight was actually the service. Maybe it was because  I had just flown in from a long delayed flight where everyone was cranky.  In any case, the staff were all helpful (e.g., opening my bottle of coca cola) and smiled when they saw you.  I was only staying the weekend, so when I went to the airport I had some more Joe's BBQ - food was good, but service was only ok."}
{"text":"Holy smokes this place is so good. One of the best BBQ places outside of Texas that I have been too. I went on my birthday and got $10 worth of food for free. The bbq sandwich was to die for. Great customer service and cool atmosphere. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"With so many great reviews, you know you've chosen well if you planned on dining here.  

My family and I have been frequenting Joe's for several years now and, for my money, you can't get better quality, 'made-with-love' BBQ than Joe's Real BBQ.  Their food has always been fresh, flavorful, plentiful, and priced affordably.  Their staff are the same: super friendly, genuine, prompt, and I've never had a bad experience with staff (in fact Management has always been flexible and helpful.. say when we had a birthday cake we asked them to store for us... stopping by to say hi to customers).  

This place is cafeteria style, so you get your food, pay, sit down and enjoy.. that simple.  Some of my favorite things to get:
- Brisket, Pulled Pork - you can't go wrong with this flavorful, moist meat that is slow-cooked over pecan-wood... I can literally eat 3/4lbs of it!
- SWEET POTATOES!  I *love* the cinnamon/sugar butter they serve with the giant, loaf-sized sweet potato (only offered during the sweet potato season).. I will usually order the sweet potato and this alone. They are giant and cooked perfectly and very enjoyable and filling!
- Sides of: Cowboy Beans (YUM!), Mac n Cheese (YUMMIER!).. I don't really venture outside of those 2 sides because once you know 'good', you stick with 'good'.

I have yet to try their root beer and their desserts, but I can imagine they are both very tasty given than everything else has been enjoyable.

OK, the *only* con: The line can get pretty long during 'popular hours', but good thing it runs fairly quick; Their salad sans meat is more white/yellow than green romaine and it's just a little on the boring side.  But to be completely honest, you should not be going here for a salad, you should go for the BBQ.  With that, it still ranks high on my list of places I enjoy eating at."}
{"text":"BBQ is funny, it is such a regional food, every state you travel to will do their BBQ a little different.  

In my very humble opinion THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE!!!!!  Right down to the decor, it took me back to growing up in a agricultural based town where we got together and had BBQ cook out in the back yard.  Joe's Real BBQ transcends great BBQ to a great experience, it's as if they invite you into their own back yard where they have strung up lights and give you the freedom to throw around a football with your son while slurping down some of their homemade root beer (which is what you should get to drink).  It is really some experience and floods my heart with fond memories of home.

They really smoke their meat, and it is not over-smoked as some places can do sometimes, but there is a beautiful pink smoke layer that you can see in the meat as you pull it apart to enjoy.  That is something you cannot fake.

I was so excited when I first walked into Joe's that I seriously ordered a little bit of everything, and ate it all.  Every one of their BBQ selections is great.  If you like a well smoked BBQ meal, then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I went to the take out window, had great service that was fast. The meal I chose was the BBQ sampler plate that had brisket, pulled pork, chicken and two ribs. The pork, beef and ribs were very good they had just the right amount of smoke to them and were tender and juicy. The chicken on the other hand was dry and lacked flavor. I was hoping that I would fall in love with the sauce but I was disappointed with that as well. The sauce seemed to be generic was not unique in any way, it was OK but it just didn't knock my socks off. The two sides that I got were the BBQ beans and the coleslaw. the BBQ beans were very good sweet smokey and had big hunks of meat in it. As for the coleslaw it was not as good; it also lacked flavor of any kind. In all I think its worth a try and I will return but perhaps next time I will choose something different."}
{"text":"woooooooooooow.

Some of the best ribs ive had in my life.

Some of the best bbq ive ever had in my life.

Amazing atmosphere. Down home country feel.

Fast service. 

Amazing food.

Its UNREAL"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant; a place I visit often for great food and ambiance (to again discover great service and friendly and honest hard working people and servers).  There is a deep story of successful restaurant entrepreneurs and business people found here.  The story begins at a historic Arizona coffee house (Coffee Plantation).  Joe's B B Q - the prices are fair and the service is the best on this street."}
{"text":"We love Joe's. Have only been inside once and the atmosphere has a very \"homey\" feel to it... love it!

However, we usually just order from the walk-up window. Much quicker than waiting in line... and more convenient for us. :)"}
{"text":"We went by Joe's after a busy day and had a big appetite. The restaurant was pretty packed so we were really excited to get our food. It's set up cafeteria style inside, so you can walk through the line and order your main meal & sides.

I ordered the BBQ Chicken Sandwich with the Cheesy Potatoes and Mac & Cheese. The Cheesy Potatoes tasted very similar to the Mac & Cheese so I was a little bit disappointed. I guess since the food sits there while people go through the line, the sides were lukewarm. The BBQ Chicken was decent, but nothing spectacular. I did like their BBQ sauce, however, so we may go back in the future."}
{"text":"Service wasn't great. Nobody was smiling or seemed happy to be there. Food was ok. No where near the best BBQ I've had. I had the sausage and pulled pork on a sandwich. Good not great. The cookie was really good and the baked potato I got for my wife was really big for a baked potato"}
{"text":"We have been going to Joe's for years in my family. The brisket is some of the best. Yet their sides are even better. The macaroni is to die for. They will even give you a free $10 to use on your birthday, I go every year. The outdoor tables are fun to sit at too. Their BBQ sauce is delightful, you can even buy a bottle to take home, which I did so. This is one of Gilbert's oldest and hallmark restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here for my free birthday meal up to $10 value.  Anything over $10, you just pay the differences.  Make sure you show your Photo ID when ordering and it's only available on the day of your birthday, not before nor after.

I got the sampler plus 2 sides.  Good flavor everything, and the sides are delicious as well.  Make sure you go early as one of the sampler I want ran out so they substitute another choice for me.  You can either order from the side walk or go into the store, same service and very friendly."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Joe's this place is a hit! I got the 2 meat plate there was so much food I couldn't finish.Very good mac n cheese. The sweet potato pie is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place when visiting family in Gilbert,Az.Great prices  is a + fun place for family with kids and all! Food is delish. Free  entree for the special birthday Peep (up/to$10) Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"If you want to know what heaven taste like. This is the place to go. Best BBQ I have ever had. My family drives about 20 minutes  to go get this BBQ and we will never stop. I have been coming to this place since I was a kid. Great food. Never had better BBQ then this place. Super great for kids too. Big lawn area for the kids to run around and enjoy the BBQ they just ate."}
{"text":"Great decor, very friendly service, food is good just lacking the smoke flavor bbq lovers crave. Great sauces and soda choices are good."}
{"text":"A star upgrade for the owner's quick response!  His message was respectful and enough to get me off the fence to try Joe's Real BBQ at some point for a 3rd try."}
{"text":"I consider  myself pretty darned spoiled, as I moved here from Pittsburgh where there were some darned good rib houses (nothing fancy, no chains, just darned good ribs).

I had high hopes for Joe's. I had heard from coworkers that it was the best around.

I was disappointed. It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't what I expect in a BBQ.

Between DS's sampler and our dinners, we were able to sample quite a few things - ribs, chopped brisket, links, pulled pork.  We got a variety of sides - potato salad, mac n cheese, corn, cheesy potatoes, slaw.  So we had lots to review.

1.  Dry meat

Yeow. Rule 1 of BBQ.  Smoke does not mean dry.  Good smoked meat should still be edible without a drowning of sauce (love a good rub).  The  meat was fairly dry except for the meat that was drowning in sauce.  without the sauce, the ribs and the brisket would have been fairly dry and not worth eating.  And, I agree with the review you will gnaw off every bit of meat off the bones because, frankly, you will still be hungry!!

2.  Skinny ribs

Seriously - ribs CAN have meat on them - they don't call those little animals pigs for nothing - and these were not meaty at all.  They kind of reminded you of the ribs you get at chains with nothing on them.

3.  Mac n cheese good

Mac and cheese was okay. Not great.  It was decent.  I like mine more southern-style with some eggs to make it more souffle-y and less Kraft-style but it was decent.

4.  Potato salad

Let's just leave it at lots of onion and skip it. Not worth it. Whether you like southern style with eggs and celery and relish or you are more of a mustard/mayo with eggs, this one will not satisfy you.

5.  Corn
Ok. This was the worst part of dinner. I love veggies. I am weird that way. So I got the corn. And it was drenched in LIQUID GOLD - you know the fake butter that they fry eggs in at chain restaurants and spread on toast?  It has to be that - butter is not thick on veggies. Butter is not a sauce. Whatever they put on it, it is not just butter and it was disappointing.

When we were done, 3 dinners with sodas and an extra 3 ribs were $50.  I expect higher quality for that price.  I love a good bbq.  I don't think it was an off-day for them - the place was packed.  Which could mean only one thing - maybe I need to leave my day job and open a rib joint and show Phoenix how ribs are REALLY done ;)"}
{"text":"Joe's Real BBQ has been my favorite restaurant for years!  The food is always delicious.  The prices are great, and even give you a free meal up to $10 for your birthday!"}
{"text":"It was confusing at first to function how to order my meal! But wait their is more hahaa! It's that you heaven, is that a selection of wonderful meats and sides! The condiments at  perfect too, pickets, bbq sauce etc! For three adults and all of us had 2 meats came out to be almost $40... worth every penny! Will be back, but I have a lot more exploring to do here in the valley! Cheers"}
{"text":"What a nightmare experience-so this was the family's second visit ever and boy was it bad.  The first, about a two months ago, was during the day around 230pm which was a mild to medium experience, no reason not to come back.  Tonight the customer service experience was terribly unreal.  I will never go back again.  I brought some family from Oklahoma, they were looking for good BBQ.     We arrived around 7:55pm and they were out of ribs, what a major disappointment.  Problems with the homemade Rootbeer that they boast about, so no Rootbeer tonight.  I ordered the Beef Brisket sandwich, sat at my sit and begin to eat.  The third bite in, I bit into something plyable and not of the food consistency.  As I spit out and looked over, it was paper or waxpaper of some kind.  Upset and not wanting to continue, I heading for the counter for help.  A girl helped me by grabbing my plate, apoloigizing and letting me know she would get a new one with a manager.  I replied Yea, I guess that's ok.  I stood and waited for 3 minutes, no one else in line.  As I stand and wait I am watching the servers behind the counter cleaning the hot table dragging the dirty towel into the trays of food, yuck.............. Then the manager, Mr. Vint, came from the back with my plate of food and paper on it and begin to ask me about it.  He said he looked it over and thought it was fat first but then he ruled that out.  The manager is in the back picking through my food to try and find out what is in the food, UNBELIEVABLE.  Just give me another order and quit wasting time.    I explain to him that I just want another one and I didn't have time for him to rummage through it.  He looks and at me in this disrespectful look and says, what do you want.  I told him, I just wanted another one at first but waiting 4 minutes in the front that now I want my money back.  He was rude, disrespectful and non-sympathetic  to my concerns. Sorry Joe's BBQ of Gilbert, you just lost a regular customer.  There are hundreds of places that are starving for customers who want good food."}
{"text":"First off, I must note that I am from the southeast and believe, as every region of the country must (except the Northeast, unless their tastebuds were frozen off in one of their many polar storms) that the South has some of the most premium BBQ this country has to offer. This review is from my point of view, and as you may know BBQ is a very polarizing food type.


Pros:
- Quick
- Has rural murals on that wall
- Lots of seating provides options for big families
- Food was decent for the speed at which it was given
- Offer a range of homegrown beverages
-Tasty Chocolate Chip Cookie

Cons:
- Bland tasting meat, stripped of it's sauce it is simply a soggy mess of cooked beef, pork or chicken.
- Mediocre BBQ sauce. 
- Sides served from cafeteria warming trays instead of fresh.
- No Beer (Two thumbs down)

In summary, if you want a quick place to get food with your kids where there are a lot of sugary drink options that would make Wilford Brimley cringe and an open seating arrangement for a big family. This is the place. If you want quality BBQ that feels homemade and not reminiscent of a high school cafeteria, go elsewhere. Waldo's, in fact is a delightful BBQ place only a few miles away in Mesa."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place forever I was super excited to give Joe's a try. Keep a few things in mind when visiting... it get SUPER busy and lines get long. Parking is ok. There's a big lot across the street. 

The food was ok. Not the best I've ever had but not the worst. I had the pulled pork sandwich and mac & cheese. My sandwich could have used a little more sauce. The mac & cheese needed a little extra something. It was really difficult to re-fill your drinks. Pretty much had to either wait in the ordering line or shove past a bunch of people. 

Worth a visit if you're in the area, but I wouldn't travel specifically for it."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Joe's for a very long time, and am so glad I finally did!  I tried several items, and they were made from scratch.  I also had some beef brisket and it was most excellent.  I ended up talking to Duane - the dad of the owners - for about an hour.  He made my visit even more enjoyable!  Next time I will try their root beer float - Duane told me it is AWESOME so now I gotta try it.  I also want to try their cornbread (wish they had a Jalapeno version) next time I come in - which will be soon!  Prices are very reasonable given the quality and quantity of food."}
{"text":"Honestly, if the staff were not so friendly and attentive, I'd be inclined to give only two stars. The BBQ was so dry! I purposefully ordered bone in chicken knowing the boneless breast is pretty much never the answer for bbq. But even the bone in was so dry I couldn't finish it and had to follow each bite with the pickled onions just to swallow. I considered that maybe chicken was just not the right choice, so I dutifully sampled my husband's ribs. Dry. Dry. Dry. The meat was so terribly dry. I don't mean they were dry rubbed, I mean there was no moisture left in the meat. 
However, the sides were great! The beans were delicious, the Mac and cheese the kids ordered tasted awesome, and the dessert we splurged on was really good. ( we tried the sweet potato pie, we liked it a lot.)
Overall, standing in line 30 minutes and having only really poor seating options available ( we had a close up view of every butt standing in line, as the line stands just inches (3-4\") from the row of booths on one side.) for below average bbq and a little better than average sides just doesn't make sense. Not even super friendly staff can really make up for butts in your face and dry chicken."}
{"text":"Me and my family met up with some of our extended family from Gilbert and everyone was getting hungry. This place was recommended to us and we were told that this place was great for bigger groups. When we arrived I was struck by how long the line was. The line was out the door!!. This is usually indicative of some really amazing food right? We all piled in line and surprisingly it moved quite fast we waited for about 30 min. When it came time to order I noticed why the line was moving so quickly. The restaurant is set up cafeteria style.  I ordered the meat plate and it came with sides and 3 choices of barbecue. The line was set up so you grab your drink first which was super awkward as now I was trying to balance the drinks as well as wrangle my kids. The food is served up by a n employee and placed on your tray then you proceed to check out. There were only two BBQ sauces to choose from and very little condiments. Finding a spot to eat was difficult and it seemed as though they let more people in than there were seats.  We finally sat down and everyone seemed content with their meal but the food was not what I was expecting. It was super MEH and I don't know if I would be up for another round of waiting to get this BBQ again."}
{"text":"I have only found two BBQ places in the Phoenix area that I consider \"go back\" places. They are Joe's BBQ and another large chain I won't mention here. Joe's definitely has the country, homey atmosphere and is always good. You get kind of a warm, fuzzy feeling eating there, especially with the farm tractor inside the restaurant. The BBQ beans are something special. Try the home made root beer."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the draw of this place. It is a cafeteria. It isn't overpriced cafeteria. It's barbecue but it's not anything special. I don't know why people flock to this place. And my opinion your birthday is the only day worth going because you get $10 off and then the prices aren't such a rip off. It's also freezing cold in here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I got a half slab of ribs with a side of mac & Cheese  and a side of beans, and a cookie for dessert. Can I just say that I was so full and the food was to die for. The ribs were nice and juicy, fall of the bone kind mmmmm. The mac & cheese has that homemade taste to it that just makes you want more. The cookie topped it off and it was so soft and delicious  I also tried their in house root beer (not even a soda drinker) and that was tasty also.  All in all It was a great experience and I will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"I live in the area and have been going to Joe's BBQ since they opened 10+ years ago. So... I guess I should review it, but this mainly a Me, Too Review.

Great meat, fun place, tasty sides, good for lunch and dinner, are there drawbacks? Even when the line is long, it moves quickly. This place runs like a well-oiled machine... a tasty, tasty machine...

Best Texas style BBQ in the Valley, INMTBHO."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, \"Joe's is by far the best BBQ I have had in Az.\" But I am sad to say my recent trip was disappointing. I normally take the family or friends or both for some great BBQ goodness and I always have a rack of ribs. Last week the rack I received was tough,burnt black in places and several of the ribs were so tough I physically couldn't eat them. This is not the norm for Joe's.  I am guessing that the quality failure was an oversight as I am usually well pleased with the food. Here's hoping for a better return trip."}
{"text":"This cafeteria style restaurants is one of the few I'll put up with. As a matter of fact, I really enjoy it. There are really long lines, but they move fast and any wait is worth it. This locally owned restaurant is heads and tails above most bbq joints. The food has the flare of a KC bbq place. The barbecue sauce is sweet and has a little spice to it (they also offer habanero sauce). Lastly, if you order anything, get the sweet potato pie. It is like pumpkin pie, only way better."}
{"text":"I have to say that these are the best ribs and brisket that I have ever had! It's definitely worth the drive from where I live."}
{"text":"We love going here for date night. The lines can get long on the weekend, but they move very quickly. The baked potato with pork on top is my go to, but you can never go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"A couple times a week, I go to a gym right next to Joe's Real BBQ, and I'm so thankful I'm a vegetarian because the smell coming from their smoker would undo my entire workout otherwise.

So am I qualified to review Joe's even though I abstain from meat? Absolutely. I ate many meaty meals at Joe's in my teens and 20s. I actually worked there when I was a senior in high school, and I managed to gain the freshman 15 before starting college.

Back in the day, my favorite was the turkey breast. I dare you to find a more moist piece of white meat. Runner-up was the pulled pork, mostly because I loved to smother it in pickles and marinated onions. I'm not gonna lie; my mouth is watering just thinking about the condiments. My best friend, a North Carolina native, loves their pulled pork because they toss it in a vinegar-based sauce in true NC style. My husband and his friends all go gaga over the ribs, and brisket seems to be a crowd pleaser.

Nowadays, I stick with the side dishes. I love the cheesy potatoes (add scallions and douse in green tabasco) and mac and cheese. The apple sauce, potato salad, and cole slaw are all items I'm not normally a fan of, but at Joe's they are way above average and very delicious.

The restaurant has a great atmosphere. It's a great place to take kids, large groups, and out of towners. It is spotlessly clean too. A pharmacy school classmate used to do restaurant inspections, and she said Joe's was always immaculate. Service is wonderful too. It says a lot about a restaurant when employees have stayed 10+ years.

On another note, I would encourage anyone who needs a caterer to consider Joe's Real BBQ. Everyone will love it, and their rates are very affordable. I used them for my wedding and a housewarming party. Just last week, they catered my sister's wedding, and they really went above and beyond for her to make sure her day went smoothly. Keeping her happy was no small feat!"}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ's i've ever had! everything was fresh and piping hot!!! The mac n cheese and beans were both amazing! The pulled pork and ribs were great and my friend tried the brisket and loved it! We'd come back every week if we had the calories to spare. Came around 11:30 and there wasn't a line but after we sat down, the infamous line formed. Love that they allow you put however much BBQ sauce you want. The homemade root beer was a bit too sweet for my taste but it tasted a lot better when the ice melted and watered it down. It originally tasted kind of like a liquid root beer dum dum.

There service here is one of the best I've ever seen!!!! Everyone is super courteous and sweet and seems to really care if you like the food! I love it! Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan. I love the spicey bbq sauce."}
{"text":"Great food in beautiful downtown gilbert that offers plenty of outdoor seating.  Highly recommend the ribs and rootbeer!"}
{"text":"Joe's is a Gilbert landmark! Everyone knows it and loves it. I like the Jumbo Baked Potato with Chicken. I think the mild BBQ is too sweet but the hot one is way too hot (I like spicy but it's crazy hot! Can't even mix it with the other one!). So I settle for the sweetish one. 
The meat is always tender. The lines are almost always long so we usually order via phone and pick up at the outside window. 
The kids meals are good value. 
It's set up like all of Joe's other locations-  cafeteria style. However, you find your own seat  (different than Liberty Market- one of the other Joe sites). 
I dislike that we can't get a sample. I wanted to try the baked beans but it's against the restaurant policy. Not sure why but it is.
All in all, it's priced fine and tastes good. We get To Go from here about once a month or every other month."}
{"text":"I am a Gilbert boy and I have been eating here seemingly my whole life. I take ALL of my out of town guests here, especially when the weather is nice and we can sit outside. 

Great vibe always, super friendly staff, and the best BBQ I have ever had hands down. 

This food is made with love!"}
{"text":"I went here with 12 people for my birthday, and I kind of wish we'd picked somewhere else. 

I had heard great things about the place and the reviews were great for it, so I expected to finally have some good barbeque.  I lived in Austin last year and experienced great barbeque on every corner of the city practically, so perhaps I'm spoiled, but Joe's was really disappointing given the stellar ratings everyone gives it...

I had the two meat plate with brisket and chicken breast, two sides of cheesey potatoes and mac and cheese (I felt like eating some cheese I guess).

The brisket was absolutely horrible... chewy, dry, pink in places and overcooked in others.  I ate about a bite of it and gave up.

The chicken had good flavor and was pretty tender, this is what I mostly ate...

The mac and cheese was horrible!  I can't believe this because so many reviews said it was great.  Some people that came to the lunch who had eaten here before said it was a little off, but I don't see how this could possibly be good.  It had something on top of it that tasted like smashed up cheetos or the cheese packet from a box of Kraft mac and cheese, without any kind of liquid added to it.

The cheesey potatoes lacked any sort of cheese.  They were bland... I ate a little of it but mostly skipped that too.

So for $12 I ate most of the chicken and avoided everything else.

Also, they wouldn't give us the birthday $10 off thing because we were lunching the day before my birthday.  I understand there's no exceptions and we didn't care a whole lot...except that we had 12 people there who all spent about $12-15 each with meal and drink... it would have been a nice gesture for Joe's to knock off my meal since we came all the way from out of town and there would have been no way for me to actually dine there on my birthday.

I won't be going back here, but I might try their other location, the Farm one... it could be good if we're not there after a lunch rush or something.  It seemed like everything that was served to us was sitting for quite a while besides my chicken.

For the price, definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"We almost went here the first night we were in town, but we were on the verge of eating our limbs and the line was to the door. 

We finally went a few weeks ago and were surprised by the set up: wait in line, get your food right at the front, then seat yourselves. But, the food was AMAZING and the portions were generous, and we'll be back for sure! It was at Joe's that we realized the plan for eating out in downtown Gilbert is to have a snack before you leave the house so you're ready for any impending waits."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place ever to eat. Everything I have had off the menu here is just top notch. My favorite is the two meat plate with pulled pork and hot links. They have classic baked Mac n cheese with the crust on top, and their baked beans are just like my grandma used to make. They even brew their own root beer and cream soda, which is fantastic! While it's a cafeteria style dining room, it also has a lot of charm, bringing to mind a 1950s farmhouse. Nice outdoor area with lots of big trees for shade too."}
{"text":"omg... their bbq sauce is soooooo good here and i love how the meat just falls off the bone.

i'd come back here for the apple pie dessert though. that's just crack to me. i'm addicted"}
{"text":"Excellent bbq, I consider myself a expert as I lived in Kansas City for 4 years. You will love it."}
{"text":"Joe's is a Gilbert staple. They have the service down to a science so you can start your journey standing in the back of a line that is about a quarter mile long, and inside of 5 minutes you are sitting at a picnic table under the trees enjoying your grub.

I have been a fan since before I knew why it was important to find and keep places like this thriving.  Joe is cool, and a guy that people who want to succeed in independant business in Arizona should keep their eye on. 

The food is quality, the location has been around forever, but keeps fresh with awesome and unique decor (like a life size tractor) and lots of space outside for families with kids to go crazy.

The menu is simple and doesn't try to do too much. The staff is usually very pleasant as well. 

My usual is that potato that is as big as my forearm stuffed to the gills with pulled pork, sour cream, chives, bbq sauce, butter, cheese. 

and pickles on the side. 

If you haven't been to Joe's, you should make it a point."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best BBQUE since I left Texas. It is a place you have to try. I will drive across town just to get some great food."}
{"text":"I'll keep this simple - we ordered 2 sampler plates, and all the meats were very dry (brisket, chicken, ribs, and pulled pork).  I could say we were bbq aficionados from Austin to try and make this review more relevant, but when the meat is this dry - it doesn't take a bbq snob to know this place stinks.

I did think the sides were okay (mac and cheese, cheesy potatoes, apple crisp), but we came for bbq."}
{"text":"Good ol BBQ spot that's not a chain.

Cafeteria type ordering place with plenty of seating. 

Have loads of meats including turkey. Can be bought by the pound as well. Lots of sides and very good root beer on tap.

Best thing i would say is the ribs. Their BBQ sauce is also good."}
{"text":"Ribs were good, chicken was good, mac n cheese was a joke, and bread was not good. Tried the \"homemade root beer\" that was 2.29, Not Good! Actually traded it for something else. My daughter tried the bbq sandwich. She couldn't eat it. We were Very disappointed. We passed on dessert because it didn't look appetizing. Im glad we did. Im sure we would've been disappointed by it too. Won't be returning here."}
{"text":"Good bbq is hard to find and this place is awesome. The prices are reasonable and the place is usually packed. The brisket and Mac and Cheese are really good. If your looking for good bbq, this place does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Not usually a big fan of bbq but this place is delicious! The pulled pork sandwich is great. I love their sauce, the homemade applesauce and Mac and cheese as well as the house made root beer! Yummy :) love the atmosphere and style. My son loves picking out old fashioned candy from the little station and my favorite is the chocolate chip cookies! They are to die for! The other desserts look pretty great too, I want to try them but I always end up going for the chocolate chip cookie they're amazing :) never had a problem with this place! Good bbq the whole family loves it"}
{"text":"Hey Jooooooe, where you going with that BBQ sauce in your hands?

Not my house- that's for sure. 

I ordered about $150.00 worth of takeout and when I got home I had zero BBQ sauce. Well, actually I had two tiny single serve cups that I asked for as \"extra sauce\" , to go along with the sauce that was in there (or not, in this case).  It's a shame because the employee working take out was super friendly and made a point of showing all the items I ordered. Maybe it's my fault for not specifically asking for sauce? When I called to order, I was told you get four ounces per pound of meat, and I ordered three pounds of brisket (in addition to a bunch of other stuff)- so it should have come with a fair amount of sauce. I know this is a first world problem, but when you're feeding a bunch of people BBQ, and you're lacking a pivotal component- it sucks.  It's worth noting I drove 35 minutes in rush hour to get to Joes, then 40 minutes back home. Womp x3. 

The food was very good even despite the error. I can only imagine how amazing it would have been with all the components."}
{"text":"I'm from California so this was my first time here. I ordered the ribs an brisket along with Mac and cheese. I also had the privilege of trying their homemade root beer. Everything was so tasty! I wish I could've tried everything but now this just gives me an excuse to go here again when visiting this cute little town. The meat was so tender and the bbq sauce was delicious. The cute little BBQ place even has a patio where the kids can play. Perfect for my one year old son who can't sit still at any restaurant."}
{"text":"I found Joe's Real BBQ listed on the AOLcityguide as the #3 spot in the Phoenix area for BBQ.  I have a hard time believing this place is really the third best. Our group tried a sampling of many different items. For us, none lived up to what others had said. The pulled pork was tender but didn't have much flavor. The chicken breast was good, although dry. My kids both liked the ham and the mac & cheese was pretty good. Our group also tried the ribs, which were tender but not falling off the bone, which a St. Louis style rib shouldn't do. We also tried the jumbo baker (without the meat) which was tasty. A disappointment to us was that, although we could smell the smoke when we exited our car, none of the food had any smoke flavor. But, this is just the opinion of some travelers from Chicago. Others obviously like Joe's a lot because there was always a steady stream of people lining up to place their orders."}

yelp Review
Joe's real BBQ
Gilbert AZ
301 N Gilbert Road
Gilbert, AZ 85234

I have been eating at Joe's Real BBQ for about 18 years. This is one of my favorite places to eat I am a native to the southwest so I have never tried real Texas, southern BBQ. I can say that I have tried other BBQ restaurants around here in the phoenix area and they are nowhere near the quality of Joe's. 
There is usually about 15-30 minutes wait just to order/ get your food that is how long the line gets. 

It is pretty cool because the first thing is get your drink then you view a menu that is 6'x4' that is mounted on the wall. Then you pick up a tray, plate, and your utensils this reminds me of a school cafeteria three to four people. The first ask takes your menu and yields out what type of meat. The second ask what side(s) you want, as they are placing your side(s) on your plate are add your choice of meat. Their meat is never dry, it is moist always delicious. The third one asks if you would like any dessert. Then the last one takes your money. When your done paying you can add your own warm BBQ sauce you get to choose between a mild and spicy. They have bar where you can add your condiments. Which their food is served on a 12\" plate it presentation is very nice and the food is delicious.my favorite thing to eat is the stuffed baker which is one pound baked potato topped with butter sour cream, cheese chives and ¼ of a pound of your favorite of meat I get the pulled pork and top it off with BBQ sauce and its 8.99. Their side are good as well that's if end ordering a plate.

The price for dinner is affordable for a family of four can run you around 30 - 40 dollars. The most expensive thing is a full rack of ribs that are 18.99. kids' meals are 4.99 / 5.99 you have to different choices a sandwich or rib meal. Oh yeah cannot forget about the homemade root beer that is 2.49 for all fountain drinks. they sell bottle soda imported from Mexico they are in the glass bottles and there are 2.99  

The atmosphere is very clean and friendly it is like you're at a family reunion dinner they have outside sitting and inside with a farmer's theme from the 1940's or early 50's the staff always welcoming and tables are cleaned off.
Service if they are missing something from the condiments bar and you let one of the staff members know the straight to the kitchen ask the cooks for a refill, then they get a side plate and bring right to you. They never seem unset or mad. When you are sitting and have a conversation and one of the staff see that your cup in nearly empty they will ask you if you would like a refill."}
{"text":"A bunch of friends and I went to Joe's after a trip down to Queen Creek Olive Mill & The Pork Shop.  I found out later that it was the same owner as Joe's Farm Grill, makes sense, I actually had a pretty similar feeling after eating at both places.  I can see why people like both places, they have a bit of a retro feel/history to them that is sorely lacking in AZ, especially if you are from the Midwest or back East.  Both spots also offer expansive shaded patio seating.
While the Farm Grill was a little better to me food wise-hard to screw up burgers, chicken sandwiches, fries and onion rings (though I've been to plenty of spots that have screwed these dishes up plenty :) I had a little higher hopes for the BBQ joint.  I was underwhelmed.
1/2 lb. two meat two side combo that I shared with my buddy:
Ribs-Two spareribs.  Yes, TWO WHOLE SPARE ribs. Forgettable, hardly any smoke.
Chicken-A maybe 3-4 oz. boneless skinless breast that was smoked then BBQ sauce drizzled over the top??  Where's the yardbird Joe??  Good smoky flavor but not what I'm used to I guess.
Sides-An ice cream scoop of mac-n-cheese and a second scoop of cheesy potatoes.  The mac-n-cheese was good, the potatoes not so much very blah.
Cookie :)  The chocolate chip was good and I'm not even much of a fan of sweets.
Fifteen bucks for one meal  with a small pop that I did share with my buddy, had I known the portions would be the size they were I would have suggested we get our own lunches..."}
{"text":"Another  local favorite! Not a chain, great  food, great experience. Yes it can be busy  where there  is a line around the corner but it moves quickly, and doesn't  disappint.  I am not  a red meat eater, so I eat their  turkey sausage which  is amazing!"}
{"text":"Nothing beats their 1/2 lb. meat and 2 sides (my choice was chicken & turkey plus cole slaw and garden salad). Home-made rootbeer... mmm hmmm!!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm impressed! What a treat!  On a Monday night, we were happy to see the place bustling and our senses satisfied.  First, the food looks amazing!  As you stand in line contemplating what to order, people walk past you with heaping plates of delicious looking food on their plate.  Then the wonderful smells hit you!  Pork, bbq chicken, beef brisket, ribs, corn bread, cheesy potatoes, Mac and cheese, desserts. Yum.

The portions are huge.  Two people can split a 3/4 lb meat platter with 2 sides.  Sandwiches such as pulled pork were fantastic!  

All kinds of cool sodas and fountain drinks are offered.  And prices?  So reasonable!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few places around town. This was good but not my favorite. The pulled pork was a little blan and the brisket was a little dry. Overall though not bad, would defiantly go again if I find myself on that end of town. The only real obstacle is if you want more water you gotta fight to get between people in line. I think the drinks could be moved so it's not behind a busy line."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 15 years and love it!  Everything is good here but I especially like the turkey.  The sides are all very good.  For something different, go for the 1lb baked potato with meat on top!!!!  They have great homemade lemon cake too!"}
{"text":"I usually love coming to Joe's BBQ, but yesterday was just an alright experience. I got my food to-go and the girl working was nice, but it seemed like she was rushing too much. I know she wants to get the food out fast, but I think she should step down a notch and get things right before trying to get things out faster. When my food became ready, I mentioned she forgot my drink and she only filled the cup up 2/3 of the way. I was going to ask for it to be filled all the way but there was a line behind me, so I didn't want to keep asking for things. The drink was about $2.49. When I got home, I realized that there was no BBQ sauce on the sandwich. I don't know if it was my fault for not asking for BBQ sauce, but I thought the sandwich usually comes with it because the sandwich was too dry without it. It still tasted good though. I would still recommend coming here, but I would recommend going inside instead of getting to-go."}
{"text":"Average food and pricey too.  Three ribs a bit dry and tough plus an out of the bag garden salad with a 12 oz. soda alone,  ran me 14 bucks!"}
{"text":"This place is busy!
I went on a Wednesday evening with a large group of friends.  We made it through the line quickly and sat outside at reserved tables.

Pros:
The atmosphere is fun and friendly.  The owners' father greeted us at the front of the line and helped with questions.  That was a very nice touch.  I ordered the Meat Plate - which gave me a choice of two meats up to 1/2#, bread and a side.  I chose the pulled pork, and the brisket in sauce with coleslaw as my side.  Everything was delicious!  I even overcame my disappointment that I would have to pay extra for corn bread when I realized the bread that came with the meal had cheese and peppers baked in.  

Cons:
Paying for corn bread.  I just feel like this is a given at a BBQ place, and should not be something to pay extra.
No Beer.  Again - at a BBQ, I would like some type of alcohol, and even watered down can beer would have been welcome.
A bit cafeteria-esque... taking my lunch tray outside to eat on a picnic bench was fun, but also felt really like middle school all over again.  I think eating inside would not have been better as it was really loud and busy.

Parking - downtown Gilbert has grown so much it can be hard to find a good spot.  I lucked out and parked right behind the restaurant to the east.  There is a fee lot back there, as well as free parking on the side streets.

I really enjoyed my food, as did everyone else in my party!  I think this may become a take out place for me.  That way I can get the delicious BBQ and then eat it at home with my beer at a real table. Maybe even on my patio ;-) ."}
{"text":"It was a real local treasure. I was thrilled to have been taken here on my first week in the Valley. 

Quality has dipped and competition has improved (Little Miss is the bomb)."}
{"text":"Delish! This is a must-go restaurant! 
The pit ham and smoked turkey are to die for delicious, as is the brisket! 
Love the sides as well (try the cheesey potatoes) and the loaded baked potato is sinfully delish! 
There is always a line (evidence of a good restaurant) but it's worth the wait! 
I highly recommend Joe's Real BBQ!"}
{"text":"A very kid friendly place to have a BBQ meal. You order your food as if you were in a cafeteria setting. You grab a tray, grab your drinks, and go up to the counter to order your meal. Then you push your tray along and grab your sides. Once you got everything and paid for your meal you find a seat inside or head outside (if it's not too hot) to sit at a park bench. You eat for free on your birthday so be sure to bring something to verify your birthday. We even had the opportunity to be greeted by Joe himself as he made his way from table to table asking how things were and to thank you for coming to visit. I thought that was very classy. We will be back once we are in the mood for more BBQ. 


Visited April 2012"}
{"text":"Delicious food, good customer service. 
I recommend chopped brisket sliders, mac and cheese, must try the homemade root beer.
One of my favorite restaurants in the Gilbert area."}
{"text":"This Texas transplant loves BBQ, despite my part time vegan tendencies. When I go out of town, I have to try a barbecue joint, in the hopes that I find better than Vegas. Joe's was a gem! The location has indoor and outdoor seating, and it speaks to their quality that they've been in business now 19 years.

Layout is a little different, with a walkup cafeteria style ordering system- don't be surprised if the line stretches down the dining room, out the door, and around the building, the line moves pretty quick. Definitely have someone in your group stake out a table, or expect to sit community-style.

Went for the sampler plate to get a little bit of everything: plate comes with two massive ribs, pork and brisket (sliced please!), and chicken (they didn't ask for preference but I received a breast). The portion is said to be about 3/4lb, and it seemed even bigger. Great value for $13! Added on sides of mac and a salad (comes with a thousand island style dressing). While I couldn't rave about everything on my plate, the brisket is nicely fatty without being too marbled and the chicken is well-seasoned. Note that the side of \"cheesy potatoes\" is an au gratin version no one at our table of 6 liked. Don't leave without getting their sweet potato pie- it's great! Huge portion, low price, easily shareable, great southern sweetness to end your meal.

Staff, in addition to running the line smoothly and clearing tables quickly, are friendly and upbeat to match the southern charm of the place. Seems like Joe's has what it takes to stick around another 19 years!

TIP: In a rush? They have a takeout window, call ahead. They also do catering."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but this wasn't the best bbq experience this time after not having gone to Joe's for over a year. The brisket was the problem today. It just was way too fatty and not tender enough. I usually order the chopped version which is always safer, but skip the sliced style because it was really not good. I had the baked tater concoction with turkey. The turkey needed some more smoke flavor, but overall still a decent carb filled lunch. Also liked the sliced bread and the chicken is really the best meat this place serves. Freshly made root beer was also not the best version I have encountered - more of a sasparilla taste."}
{"text":"Great barbecue -- especially the chicken and pulled pork. The cheesy potatoes and homemade applesauce are good side dish options. The jumbo bakers with barbecued pulled pork and all the fixings of a baked potato are really good. It's a good family place with indoor and outdoor seating options."}
{"text":"Here's the thing about Joe's...for how good the bbq meats are (and they're really good!), the side dishes are better. The mac and cheese is killer; so are the stuffed potatoes and baked beans. The salad is incredible. This is a fun restaurant with really yummy food. Very informal and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"My uncle owns a pretty famous bbq restaurant in Memphis, TN. So I am always a bbq sceptic and tough critic. I have only tried the pulled pork sandwich and the bbq chicken breast sandwich. Both really good. All the way down to the bun it comes on....tasty and not too thick. The potato salad is good, except I did miss the chopped egg. A few customers walked by me w/ amazing looking deserts that made my mouth water. The true test of great bbq is the ribs. Next time I shall try them and update....\".y'all come back now, ya hear?\""}
{"text":"All I have to say is pulled pork sandwhich, it is so yummy and huge for the price. You can eat here for under $8 and be stuffed. The only bad thing about this place is they dont serve ranch, but they do serve bbq-ranch which is petty good. The mac n cheese is amazing also its crunchy on the top its great. 

I like that you can get your own soda and water its set up like a caferteria, which to me is really cool concept. The cookies are also amazing for $1.25 I would tell anyone to try this place its really good."}
{"text":"Love the stuffed baker here. The potato is about the size of a football with all the butter, sour cream and chives you can handle. I have really enjoyed the sliced brisket lately. Used to be more of a pulled pork guy but the brisket is GREAT!!!!"}
{"text":"Contrary to other reviews, the wait just seems long because of the cafeteria style ordering. It goes by pretty quickly and we took the time to look through the extensive menu. The sides all looked very appetizing and it was tough choosing which ones to try. Luckily, the portions were just right so you could get more than 1 and not be spultuffed. I got the beans and potato salad which were both excellent. My gf tried the mac and cheese and cheesy potatoes. Macn cheese was excellent, but the potatoes were just ok. For main course, I figured I'd try a taste sampler of all their meats in the form of sliders: pulled pork, turkey, and beef brisket. The turkey was surprisingly moist and not dry.  Pulled pork and beef were my favorites. The bbq house sauce and spicy sauce were both excellent, i couldn't get enough of them.  

I also loved their fresh, house made sodas and root beer, lemonades. I'll have to save room for their delicious looking desserts next time. The only thing better to go along with all the great meat would be some cold beer."}
{"text":"A little disappointed...  We have been waiting for the right moment to visit this place and today turned out to be that day.  First of all, the location is in the middle of what looks to be a ghost town.  The interior had a lot of character with items like the family owned John Deer tractor ;)  Anyway, we had the full slab with 2 sides, a bottle of ginger beer and a drink.  Honestly, I expected more from this place.  The meat was dry, bland and over done.  My bf and I both agreed that our fav in Arizona is still Famous Dave's where pay pretty much the same price, get to sit and relax while they serve you, and the food is better.  

*Location = kinda out there
*Price = for a cafeteria style bbq....I think it's a little much
*Food = it's not all that...at least to us
*Decor = very classic and full of character

*** I just received a really nice message from the owner, Joe.  I think it's wonderful that Joe cares about each customer's comments and reviews.  Even though my review was not a very positive one, Joe was polite and very kind.  Thank you Joe and I think I'm definitely gonna persuade my bf to try your restaurant again :)***"}
{"text":"Joe's Real BBQ has never disappointed me. 
I would recommend any pork meat; whether it's pulled pork, brisket, or ribs. The meat is always very tender and flavorful. Some other must haves are also the Mac and cheese and cookies! The Mac and cheese is not too heavy and they top it off with what tastes like cheez itz; the cookie is fresh, warm, and gooey. 

Tip 1: Portions are generous. In my experience, both the sampler and sandwiches are enough to share (I've always gone home with a box) 

Tip 2: On your birthday, you get $10 off your meal!"}
{"text":"Food was good not great.  I can say that I could tell it was fresh and home made. Their root beer was not a hit with the boyfriend. 

We had a bbq sampler plater. The smoke ring on the meat was impressive but couldn't really taste the smoky goodness I was looking for. Mind you I dont like things overly smoked I am not a fan of el passo or daves ribs just because of the over powering smoke flavor. 

I couldnt pass up a slice of the obviously home made sweet potatoe pie. But had a hard time deciding if it was a pumpkin or sweet potato when eating it. Dont get me wrong it was a good slice of pie just not fantastic."}
{"text":"This restaurant is self serve style. The line is usually long (15-20min) during lunch and dinner time. There is plenty of seating, inside and outside. I like the meat options including chicken and turkey breast. There is a good selection of sides. I especially like the beans. They have homemade root beer on tap which is very tasty. They are also very accommodating for Gluten Free patrons as myself. Having Celiac can often be challenging when eating out. They offer a $10 meal on your birthday."}
{"text":"Wanted to love it, but don't.  Don't understand the hype.  Didn't even finish my ribs.  The definition of \"meh\" for me."}
{"text":"Been going for 20 years and always loved it. Something has happened. Change in management? Ownership? 6 of us went for lunch and everyone was shocked how bad it was. Rude employees, old leftover Mac and cheese, dry dry pulled pork, so much sauce on brisket sandwich could not taste the meat. Very disappointed and will not return. Sad!!"}
{"text":"Fun place. Walk in and go thru a cafeteria style line. I had the ribs which were awesome !!! Mac n cheese was great. Cheesy potatoes were just okay. The root beer float is a must as is the root beer cake !!! My wife had the sliders. The pulled pork and chicken were great, the beef- not so great. Fun place to go with kids. Like the atmosphere. Drink refills are cumbersome cause it's at the start of the food line so you kind of have to cut thru the line to fill er up."}
{"text":"I went to Joe's Real BBQ on my birthday (showed ID) and received $10 worth of food to take home. I ordered the sampler plate (paid difference since over $10) .. The food is really good, first time here. Customer service was good, clean place.
I'll come back again. 

(*this review was not on the same day of visit)"}
{"text":"Waited about 45 to 50 minutes in line with obnoxious people in front of me the whole wait. Ordered the meat plate with 2 sides. I had beef brisket and ribs. Beef brisket was great, the ribs were nothing special. The mac n cheese was very good, but i did not like the cheesy potatoes. The food was not hot, just lukewarm. Kinda disapointing to not receive hot food after standing for an hour. I dont know if id return again due to the wait, and the way its set up, and not getting hot food. It felt kinda like being served left overs that were reheated."}
{"text":"Good part:   Appeared to be a locals favorite an have a local theme
Rest of story: you stand in line for cafeteria type service.  You by pass people with heir food already who are hunched over their food like prisoners.  Then you get your drinks and go to the counter.  I ordered pulled pork and pork ribs with baked beans and Mac and cheese.  The lady behind the counter responded \"¿Qué?\".  Silly me for only speaking the national language of English.  After two more tries she finally is able to understand my order.  So I get my order and I mention they were really light on the sauce.  She told me not to worry you can get more.  So we pay then get sit down.  But wait there is no one to clean up the mess of previous people or trash cans at the end doors to dump your trash.  So you get to pick up the trash of the previous guests and pile it on the ledges with the rest.  Not sure how that doesn't attract other little critters.  So my Girlfriend brings up the BBQ sauce as I finish clearing off a place to eat.  Again I was wrong to assume that BBQ sauce was supposed to be thick like ketchup and not pour like water.  Now we finally get to eat and the meat was dry and it was obvious the sides were boxed/canned and just warmed up.  Then while trying to supplement the moisture from the drink I ran out.   So I get to stand in line with the hungry crowd again and walk past all the prisoners guarding their food to refill at the only soft drink station.  Also stick with the Barq's root beer, the home made tastes like a \"diet\" version.   Needless to say in the end I was not impressed at all"}
{"text":"Great BBQ, easy parking (huge lot right behind), good prices, extremely quick and friendly service, and overall a great experience. I had a brisket sandwich with a side of pulled pork and mac n cheese. Each was delicious."}
{"text":"I've been here many times since I moved down here 10+ years ago. I really like this place. I'd say the BBQ is above average, and thus the 4 stars. But the service is friendly and the atmosphere is homey. I like their ribs but it can be a tad dry at times. Maybe I like them meatier. I swear they used to give you 3 ribs, but now 2. The pulled pork is pretty good. I think I like my brisket fattier. Otherwise it's too dry. The hotlinks are pretty good. Love their cheesy potatoes and pit beans. I think they have the best bbq sauce anywhere. Yep, I think that's why I really like Joe's. They are fairly close and they have awesome bbq sauce. As far as the actual meat goes, I like them, but I like Stacy's smokehouse better. :) Only wish Joe's have beef ribs....."}
{"text":"Back to Joe's.... been several years as we are Westside dewelers and on Mother's Day we had Mom & Dad with us and suggested Joe's after the hot experience out at Schenpf''s farm.  Glad we went, Joe's really is quite tasty, is it the best? - Probably not but that is all relative!  For the SE Valley, it's our go to spot for BBQ.  We had the ribs, pulled pork, the Jumbo tater with Pork, coleslaw, mac & Chz, lemon cake, sweet patato pie.  All were really quite tasty.  The \"HOT\" sauce isn't THAT hot... but good lil kick.  One time we will be there when it's not as hot out and get to try that nice large outdoor seating!  - I gotta say the Lemon Cake kicks ass!"}
{"text":"After years of dining out in Arizona while I lived here, Joe's BBQ is my one required stop every time I'm back to visit. I grew up in Gilbert so I've seen Downtown Gilbert grow a lot from almost nothing to the hot spot it is now but Joe's has always been at the center of the action (and for good reason). You can't get within half a mile of this place without smelling it first! My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

All the food here is incredible and that's what keeps me (and the line of people usually stretching out the door) coming back. I love the ribs when I'm feeling up to it and don't mind getting a little messy but my go-to is a BBQ sandwich with either the pulled pork or chopped brisket. The meats are all pecan-smoked and perfectly tender and the chopped brisket is even cooked in their signature BBQ sauce so the flavor is in every bite. They also have a station where you can get more BBQ sauce or Spicy BBQ sauce and pour it all over everything (I prefer to mix the two so it's got a kick but it's not too spicy). 

In addition to the all the delicious meat options, the sides are a standout as well. The mac and cheese is my all-time favorite, with plenty of gooey cheesiness (totally a word) and a flaky topping, and the cornbread with honey butter really hits the spot. The cheesy potatoes and BBQ pit beans are very popular as well! As far as drinks go, Joe's makes their own homemade root beer and lemonade which are both a refreshing complement to the smoky barbecue. And if you have room, go for the root beer cake or chocolate chip cookie: both desserts are a simply amazing way to end the meal.

Not only is their food unparalleled around here but the customer service is second to none and they even give free meals on your birthday, in addition to a few days every year where they serve free lunches to everyone. It's cafeteria-style so you wait in line, get your drink, then order your food and they give it to you before paying at the cash register. Even though the line can get long, trust me...the wait will be torturous but so so worth it!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I go again and again, even though it is a good 40 minute drive.  Everything they have is always delicious, and the staff is friendly!  Plus you eat FREE on your birthday, what is not to love!

Pulled pork is one of my faves with macaroni and cheese!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ, great price! I got a full slab of ribs, 2-meat plate w/ brisket & hot link, 2 sides of coleslaw, potato salad, and apple cobbler all for around $50. Their coleslaw is the best, I think they put apple slices - so refreshing! And their desserts have a homey taste to them. Service is also great. I needed help carrying my trays and the lady behind the counter came out to assist."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ! Fun themed place. Always fresh and delicious. Quick service with friendly staff. Our \"go to\" for BBQ!!"}
{"text":"I love Joe's Real BBQ. The food is fantastic and I just love to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful Arizonian weather. Family friendly. A great place to hang out and eat."}
{"text":"Joe's BBQ is awesome!  The pulled pork, chopped brisket and Ribs rival the best in Texas.  The sides are just like my mom used to make--superb."}
{"text":"I'm admittedly impatient but will gladly wait for food if it's good. Unfortunately, Joe's didn't really live up to expectations. Line on a weekday moved very slowly.  It wasn't even busy with plenty of open seating everywhere. How hard is it to serve up some premade food cafeteria style? It was hot and stuffy in the main dining room. Care to temperature control?  

Thankfully, the brisket itself was pretty tender and flavorful. Everything else about the experience was just 'meh.' I was not a fan of the two bbq sauces offered. They had an off-putting bitterness. Cole slaw didn't have bite and cheesy potatoes were passable. The mac and cheese, I'll give, was quite tasty. Don't think I'll be back. Lot's of other bbq places in the Valley to try."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best bbq restaurant in Southeast Valley. Always beyond expectations, so delicious!  I like the walk-up window if the line inside gets too long.  

Make a point of eating here, you won't be sorry you did."}
{"text":"Great BBQ!! Comfy family atmosphere! We've eaten here quite a few times and love it! Don't let the big crowds scare you , they're excellent!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to find true BBQ in Phoenix and I sure as hell found it with Joe's.  I got the sampler platter which is a combination of the most popular meat they serve... ribs, chicken, and pulled pork.  Everything was phenomenal and a great environment too.  I went to school at PSU where we are lucky enough to get Clems BBQ, this makes up for good ole clem and then some.  Definitely will go again, good look Joe."}
{"text":"Not the best bbq i have had, but a great atmosphere, good portions, and nice outdoor seating."}
{"text":"My sister has rant and raved about this place and wanted me to give it a try. One day we took a trip to Joes real BBQ and the lines were long no complaint here I will wait in the lines just to see if it was worth and yes it was definitely worth.

I split my sampler because its such a big amount of food that I would not be able to finish it myself. The sampler consists of ribs, pulled pork, briskets, and chicken with 2 sides we usually get cole slaw and mac n cheese.

It was definitely worth the experience and I have and would continue to eat at this place when ever I crave for their sampler. 

We also got our friends addicted to Joes we took them there for the first time and a couple of months later they went back on their own. 

Definitely a place to go to if you haven't gone there yet."}
{"text":"Been going here for years and love it. I wouldn't say my all time favorite but good BBQ"}
{"text":"I love Joe's Real BBQ! As soon as you sink your teeth into any one of the tasty meats you can taste the pecan wood smoke flavor!!! I have yet to get something here that I didn't like. Do yourself a favor and get the three meat sampler and some cheesy potatoes and your belly will love you!! the service is awesome as well!! always a friendly smile when you go in!"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ in the east valley, maybe one of the last places that give you a birthday meal!"}
{"text":"My expectations may have been too high entering this establishment.  The meat itself was decent, but the sauces and sides were huge letdowns.  The sides were severely underseasoned and the sauces just didn't seem to have the right combination of sweet and spicy flavors."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 10 years and still love it. The bbq beans are really good. My favorite thing to get here is a jumbo baker (and they mean jumbo) with everything on it including a side of chopped beef and then I add their homemade bbq sauce to it. Sooooo good. Their homemade root beer and limeade are also yummy. I remember them having a customer appreciation day once a year (I think in May) where lunch and dinner and free! You would get a pulled pork sandwich, a side and a drink for nothing. The lines would be out the door, but the food is worth the wait. I also remember them offering a free dinner (can't remember the choices) on your birthday. It's a cute little place in downtown Gilbert. Check it out."}
{"text":"We were in the area for Dodgers spring training, it was about 10-15 min away from our hotel but worth the trip, best BBQ ive had and you cant beat the price. We went for lunch on saturday and while we were in line, the line reached outside the door... it is cafetia style so the line goes by pretty quick. Loved the mac and cheese, tri tip and the cornbread....i will DEFINITELY come back and recommend this place to anyone in the area:)"}
{"text":"First class BBQ! Don't mess around with anything else besides a slab of ribs, mac and cheese and beans. Nough said."}
{"text":"Today was Customer Appreciation Day at Joe's so a big THANK YOU to Joe's.  Always enjoy the pulled pork and beans."}
{"text":"What can you say about Joe's BBQ other than it's the best BBQ in Arizona and better than 99% of places in the US.  Joe's is in a old brick building in downtown Gilbert and just accept that it'll be crowded no matter if it's lunch or dinner Ive seen the line go outside and down the sidewalk on ,amy occasions.   And it's well worth the wait trust me on this.  Pulled Pork, Brisket, Chicken, Sausage, Beef sliced and ground if you can Bbq it it's here.  Add amazing wood smoke flavoring a hot spicy sauce thats wonderful and you've got BBQ Nirvana.   Like baked potatoes well get ready they have baked potatoes that look like footballs with the logos sanded off.  There baked to perfection and come with BBQ or plain.   Plain here means Butter, Sour cream, Chives, Cheese all on the side to make your own but you can't go wrong.   all the side are great and fresh and they even make there own Root beer and Cream Soda.   And for desert the lemon cake is hard to beat.    I'm lucky to live so close last time I was there the guy behind me was from Glendale a good 40 mite drive he said he does probably twice a month and I'm not surprised."}
{"text":"Joe's is good BBQ with a great atmosphere.  The meat is generally pretty good and the sides are excellent.  I think I could eat the beans all day if that wouldn't result in being kicked out of my own house.  They really seem to care about their customers (customer appreciation day = free food) and from what I hear, they are crazy about the consistency of their food.

If you really want to get a taste for their food, do the BBQ sampler...otherwise the meat plate should be plenty of food for most people."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bbq spot in Arizona. The sauce is sweet and delicious. They have a spicy one too. The pulled pork is the best, especially on a jumbo baked potato. The sliced brisket can be fatty, if that's your thing. This place is huge and on the weekend, be prepared to wait in a long cafeteria-style line. Downtown Gilbert is an awesome location."}
{"text":"I love Joe's and their bbq sauce.  I prefer a sweeter type of bbq sauce versus a vinegary sauce so this is the perfect bbq place for me.  I find their regular sauce with the perfect amount of sweetness.  I went with the family right around dinner time and the line was almost out the door on a Thursday night.  We probably had to wait about 10-15 minutes before ordering.  We got a full slab of ribs and two sides, beans and mac and cheese.  Their beans are the best as it has the perfect amount of sweetness, beans, and good amount of bits of brisket.  The ribs were very good, but there were probably a couple of ribs that were a bit dry.  The best thing, the meal only cost less than $5 since I got a $10 credit for my birthday!  Great place for bbq if you prefer more of a sweeter sauce."}
{"text":"I was in the area for work and my colleague mentioned this place for lunch.

I'm all about BBQ. So needless to say, I was in.

This place is located in a really interesting place in Gilbert. It looks \"small towny\" with character. 

As I walked in, I don't know what I was expecting. But I was a little surprised to see that it is set up kind of like a cafeteria. Interesting. 

I got, what I believe was called, the two meat platter. I got the beef brisket and the pulled pork. 

Holy moley.

It was so good. I slathered it with the BBQ sauce and was super satisfied. 

But that wasn't enough, I had to try their hot BBQ sauce. 

I slathered my food in it. Nose dripping with sweat, lips burning, but man was it good. 

I came out of the restaurant smelling like BBQ. Which is fine with me. 

The prices were reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Love this place but it only received a three due to seating issues. There were two large outside areas reserved   This meant that regular customers were left circling holding full trays  trying to find somewhere to eat.   The booths along the side are horrible horrible to eat in as people standing in line watch you eat and listen to conversation.   Not one of my better joes experiences"}
{"text":"First off I love good BBQ,  but I am a little picky in the fact that I don't want my food drowned in sauce, I want to be able to taste the flavor of the meat. Joe's Real BBQ  does just that, they serve you all the meats you want with the sauce on the side, with the exception of the ribs. I was a big fan of Rudy's BBQ for that same reason as well however I must say Joe's is much better. The meat by itself has very good flavor and its cooked to perfection. We tried the beef brisket, pulled pork, hot-links, and the ribs. I loved the brisket, it was so moist and flavorful. The ribs, while the sauce was a little sweet for me the meat just fell off the bones. My husband really enjoyed the hot-links along with the pulled pork. They do have a lot of options for sides however they were a bit small in portions, our favorite side was the mac and cheese. The atmosphere is welcoming with the family style picnic type seating."}
{"text":"Great place. I got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich with sides of Mac and cheese and cornbread.

Pros:
Great BBQ sauce
Amazing warm sweet cornbread 
Super friendly staff
Mac & cheese was delicious

Cons:
Line is super awkward, hard to get drink refills if you want them (with water or anything else)
Super cold in the restaurant
The meat was good, but had a lot of fat in it

Great place to bring big groups because it's relatively inexpensive and buffet style. It's tasty BBQ, some of the best in the area. Brought some friends here tonight because they're new here, they really liked it too."}
{"text":"Good barbecue, but not great. I ordered the BBQ Sampler and shared with my wife.  With an extra side and a delicious chocolate chip cookie for dessert, it was plenty of food.  Unfortunately, the quality of the food wasn't as high as I was expecting based off of all the Yelp reviews. All of the meats were very tender... The brisket and pulled pork especially.  But they were devoid of significant taste and had to be drowned in BBQ sauce in order to taste anything.  Thankfully the sauce was excellent and readily available.  Of all the meats I sampled, the winner here was the ribs.  Definitely not the meatiest, but extremely tender. I could pull the bones right out and devour.  Delicious!

Outside of the food, everything was excellent.  I arrived at peak time on a Saturday night, and the line moved quickly.  It snaked through the restaurant and out the door, around the corner, but it moved quickly.  We waited no longer than 30 - 40 minutes.  All of the servers were extremely nice and helpful.  There was plenty of seating available, especially outside.  It was a lovey place to enjoy a meal.  It is unfortunate that the quality of the BBQ does not rise above \"medium\" to match the high quality of the rest of Joe's Real BBQ."}
{"text":"I've only been once, but I can't wait to go back. My husband and I tried the sampler plate and it was AMAZING. Plenty of food for 2 people. The brisket was so tender. Best I've ever had (I've tried it at 4 different BBQ places).  I was hoping the applesauce was chunky and homemade, but it looked and tasted more like it was from a can (pureed) and they added some pink food coloring. However, since I didn't go there for the applesauce, it still gets 5 stars.  The meat was the best BBQ I've had. Their BBQ sauce is SO good.  Not too spicy, but just enough of a kick that you can still taste your food.  

Great place for kids too."}
{"text":"Yes the line is long however is the best place for ribs anywhere in arizona barbeque pork absolutely worth it we usually use the take out window we call in the food ready in about 15 minutes its a half a slab pulled pork sandwich all excellent great size great place to bring people from out of town it is by far the best place I know in Arizona right now to get  great barbecue"}
{"text":"Visited the good old AZ since my college days, mainly to visit a GF who was extremely ill. Her and hubby took BF and I here for a quick lunch bite. 

Ambiance: rugged, simple, and friendly place.

Food: the BBQ sampler was quite delish and flavorful. (To be honest, i was so busy catching up with my friend on the years of lost communication, don't recall what I ate).

Overall: if it's your first trip to AZ, then make sure to stop by Joe's Real BBQ."}
{"text":"Love this place it is one of my favorite places in gilbert. If you are looking for some good BBQ this is the place."}
{"text":"Got the sampler (chicken, ribs, brisket, pulled pork) and everything was delicious! Only problem was the silverware was dirty; and I grabbed several utensils before finally notifying someone."}
{"text":"The food is great, reasonable prices but the line gets long at lunch so be there's early!"}
{"text":"My husband would give this 5+ if he were writing the review.  Maybe it is because I am less of a meat person, but 4 seems right to me. They almost always have a line out the door, but it moves fast.  The meats are very good.  I like the brisket and husband likes the ribs. The sides are really good. I love the mac n cheese and baked beans. I had the root beer float for the first time and it was SOOOO good.  Best root beer float I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place is worth standing in line for. I recommend the mac 'n cheese."}
{"text":"Located in Old Town Gilbert. I've been going to Joe's Real BBQ for the past 10 years.  This has to be the best BBQ that I've tasted in the Phoenix area; East and West Valley. I usually get the Joe's Sampler plate which includes chicken, pulled pork, ribs and beef brisket and a couple of slices of their awesome bread. The meat comes just right with the right amount of sauce and flavor. You can add more sauce if you like. At $13.00 the meal is an excellent value. Two can eat off that one plate. If its your birthday you get $11.00 to apply to any meal. No other bbq place does that as far as I know. I went to one place not too far away and they wanted $27.00 for approximately the same meal.

Great atmosphere, friendly attentive service. I recommend taking the whole family to Joes."}
{"text":"If you want to see creepy ass people this is your place. You go line up cafeteria style and people with like straw hats try to stand on top of you and sing Gospel music in your ear. But only in a creepy taunting volume. ( I swear on my mom this is truely what happened) I have no clue where these people live but they come out of the wood work for this shit. 

I give the customers 1 star. 

The sauce is 4 stars for sure

The chopped bbq brisket was moist but wayyyy too salty, the get the buns from strictly from scratch bakery which is great but the buns were just eh. 
Jamie got the chicken sadwich which is chopped white meat she said it had a reat flavor but was dry and in big pieces like sliced. 
She exchaned for the pork which had a very butaney flavor my briset also had. Some reason the chicken didnt have that after taste. 

After being stared at for the 9 mins it took to eat we eagerly bailed. 

This was a very creepy experience for ok bbq."}
{"text":"Joe's has been a favorite of mine for many years. The food is delicious - real comfort food here. The ribs are a bit fatty, but most ribs are. Mac n Cheese, cheesy potatoes, beans, brisket, everything is really tasty."}
{"text":"This was tough to write. We were big fans of Joe's, but recently returning to the valley and looking forward to it, would have to bow out next time. 

We got pulled pork meat plate and pork with salad. How do I put this...the pork tasted like moth balls. I know, ew. Couldn't believe it. We tried smothering it with bbq sauce and just couldn't take it. It used to be SO good - what happened?! 

I understand the older crowd, we got there early around 4:30pm, but it used to be a friendly atmosphere. Not sure what happened this time, but didn't feel the love in the food or the people. Wouldn't go back.

Now Joe's bistro out there in Agritopia? - MUCH better! Plus, their onion rings rock! ;-)"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Joes for many years, and almost always the good is great. Yesterday it was not. My husband got the sausage and chicken. Both were overcooked and dry. My baked potato was overcooked as well. The mac n cheese was fantastic, and that is why I put 2 stars. The meat is usually juicy, and it was disappointing that our experience was not so."}
{"text":"There is perhaps no city in the Phoenix Metro that more exemplifies the postcard version of American suburbia than Gilbert.  There's also few towns in America that define suburban sprawl quite like Gilbert.  When I was born in 1981, Gilbert was a rural farm town with a population of 6,000 residents.  Today, Gilbert is a Phoenix suburb with more than 240,000 residents.  As with every Phoenix suburb, there's the inevitable clash between demand for the big brand name stores & restaurants you find everywhere & the local businesses trying to carve out a niche.  Without much debate, the one man most responsible for building Gilbert's emerging culinary identity is a Stanford graduate with longstanding ties to Gilbert's farming community.  Joe Johnston is many things.  A chef, a farmer, an entrepreneur, & a visionary.  Johnston owns three wildly popular Gilbert centric restaurants including Joe's Farm Grill & Liberty Market (both of which I've been to & give a thumbs up).  Joe's Real BBQ somehow managed to slip through my fingers all these years, but not today.

You'll find Joe's BBQ on the northeast corner of Gilbert Road & Page Avenue right in the heart of Downtown Gilbert's ever expanding culinary scene.  I happened to come on a Saturday at lunch & Downtown Gilbert (also known as the Heritage District) was jam packed with cars & pedestrians strolling the Downtown streets.  A quick piece of advice for those coming down here.  Park in one of the public parking lots on the perimeter of Downtown & take a short walk (I parked on Vaughn & Ash).  As soon as you walk inside Joe's BBQ you immediately get a sense of the family friendly farm personality that you find at each of Johnston's restaurants.  There's a John Deere tractor in the main dining hall with a mix of tables & booths with seating for at least 200 inside.  Out back, there's a patio with lots of picnic style seating & an open green space for the kids, & is ideal for catering big events.

Let's get something out of the way first.  Joe's Real BBQ is nothing like Little Miss BBQ & doesn't aspire to be.  Whereas Little Miss is market style, Joe's is cafeteria style.  Whereas Little Miss sticks to mastery of the basics, Joe's is putting just as much emphasis on the non-barbecue dishes as the barbecue itself.  So if you're a Little Miss fanatic like I am, set your expectations accordingly.  So here's how it works.  Grab a tray on the right side up front, load up your silverware & a drink, then get into the buffet line & tell the friendly counter staff what you're having.  Being the ever ambitious Yelper I am, I asked for a little bit of...well...as much as I could fit on my tray.  First off, the BBQ Sampler.  A plate with 3/4 pound of barbecued meat including pork ribs, brisket, pulled pork, & chicken.  Also comes with slices of Texas toast.  I went with two sides (out of about a dozen choices) and let the gal behind the counter choose the ones she thinks are best.  So a side of mac & cheese & a side of pit beans it was.  Lastly, I chose a dessert.  I went with one I've never heard of or seen anywhere else.  Their homemade root beer cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Total cost including a bottled water & tax came out to $23.  No long waits in line here (unlike Little Miss) as you're served in no time flat & sit wherever you please.

Let's start with the meats.  Each was lightly doused with sauce (though you can put more on if you want).  The ribs, brisket, & pulled pork were all respectable & well smoked & the sauce had a slightly sweet & tangy bite which I found quite pleasant.  Little Miss doesn't serve barbecue chicken so this was a new one for me.  I actually really liked the rub they used on the chicken breast & the meat was juicy & not dried out as chickens can often get when smoked.  Let's talk about the sides.  These were probably my favorite part of the meal.  Each homemade from scratch & it shows.  The pit beans had a hint of the barbecue sauce & had a hearty sweet texture to them without being too heavy.  The mac & cheese was indeed cheesy, almost ludicrously so in fact.  The breadcrumbs on the mac didn't do much for me, but the creamy thickness & flavor of the cheese more than made up for it.  Lastly, the root beer cake.  And it really does taste like root beer in cake form.  I can understand why they serve the ice cream on the side as it would've made a mess to just throw a scoop on top.  Delicious creation.

I would certainly put Joe's in the same distinguished company of local barbecue staples like Bobby Q, Pork on a Fork, & The Thumb.  The meats aren't of USDA prime quality like Little Miss (but then no one in AZ is), but Joe's knows what they're doing with the product they have.  And I give them a big thumbs up for the side & dessert dishes they serve here, with a wide variety of choices sure to please anyone.  Family friendly barbecue in the heart of the valley's most family friendly suburb.  Joe Johnston knows his audience very well."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Gilbert.  This is my kind of BBQ.

I'm a huge fan of pulled pork, and their pulled pork is perfect.  I like the pulled pork so much that I haven't been able to try any of their other meat selections, which look great as well.  

On the sides frontier, their beans are excellent, as are the garlic potatoes and macaroni (real macaroni and cheese, not the box garbage).  

The root beer is also a can't miss.  I'm no root beer connoisseur, but let's just say that I quit drinking soft drinks, yet always have the root beer at Joe's.  If you want something different, the root beer cake is also delicious.

The best part?  The reasonable price.  A jumbo sandwich (1/3 pound), two sides, and a drink will cost you only $11-$12.  Cut that to the regular sandwich and one side (a more reasonable lunch option), and you're under $10."}
{"text":"I really like the format.   BBQ cafeteria style.  You pick what you want to eat-you take care of your own condiments-you stock up on napkins-and you choose from ample seating inside or out.  Joe's has plenty of room to stretch out, relax, play games, and generally have a good time.  The nice staff took good care of us when we came in so we were all smiles & had high hopes for a great experience.

Unfortunately, no one in my party was a big fan of the food.  I had the sliced beef brisket and the bone-in barbecue chicken.  My husband had ribs.  We also got a kids meal with pit ham and mac & cheese for my daughter. 

The brisket was flavorful & tender, but not in a standalone way.  It would probably be pretty good chopped on a sandwich but trying to eat the slices...well the meat was dry & yet somehow the texture was mushy.  

The chicken was cooked fine but the dry rub left me with kind-of a bad taste in my mouth, my husband said the same thing about the rib sauce. 

My daughter ate the ham but I found it watery rather than juicy.  

My husband like the cowboy beans but we both hated the soggy, flavorless cheesy potatoes.  The mac & cheese was fairly good homemade mac & cheese.

This could be a nice restaurant but the quality of food has to improve a lot to compete with other barbecue options.  Either that or the prices have to come way down.  We are unlikely to go back."}
{"text":"Drove nearly 45 min to get here and we were greatly disappointed that we did. I am a big BBQ fan and this was underwhelming. The food was ok, portions were small, it was pricey, and the service was bad. We got in line and carefully planned what we were going to get for us and our kiddos. It was finally our turn to order and they were out of almost everything we asked for. We watched them haul off several trays of food for catering - guess it impeded their ability to maintain their supply in the restaurant. We ended up with several items we didn't really want. The young girl manning the counter was inattentive, easily distracted by her fellow co-workers and unapologetic for being out of stuff. We finally got our food and headed for a table - but they were all dirty. We ended up finding the least dirty table and cleaning it off ourselves. 

I am not a fan and needless to say we will not be stopping in again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST barbecue. Even better than Salt Lick in Texas. Don't think I can add any more than the other reviewers have, but you can rest assured that your BBQ craving will be satisfied and you will leave stuffed to the gills. Oh, and be sure to try the mac & cheese - it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Joe's has a nice atmosphere and wonderful staff. I'm not sure if it's just been bad luck or off nights the past two times we've been, but the food has left a lot to be desired. Ribs had a lot of nasty gristle/ cartilage and fairly dry. Everything else was okay but nothing I couldn't get at a chain. 

I would much rather support a local business and will be returning at some point to have another go and see if it was just a couple of off nights."}
{"text":"If you're seeking out authentic BBQ, look no further. I sought Joe's out after reading about it in Mike Mills' book, Peace, Love and BBQ, and I was not disappointed. The ribs were delicious, and the sliced brisket was among the most tender I've ever had. Joe's uses pecan wood, which is unusual -- I'm more accustomed to hickory (not that I could detect a big difference). If I had to quibble, I'd say that I prefer my meat naked -- i.e., without sauce. The ribs had just a dash, which wasn't a big deal, but some of the sandwiches had considerably more. And if you're looking at dessert, beware of the pecan brownies -- they're heavy on the molasses!"}
{"text":"Joe's Real BBQ is finger-lickin' good! 

My family and I visited Arizona last month, because my cousin lived here. My cousin took us here and I couldn't be more grateful she did. We were a party of 18 and occupied 3 tables. This place is pretty big, but very well kept. The setup here is that you stand in line, get your food (cafeteria style), sit and chow down!  It reminds me of family BBQs in the summer time. 

I ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich with two sides of cheesy potatoes and bbq beans. Ugh! So good! We also got the meat sampler and the ribs were unbelievably flavorful. I tried some of my sister's Mac N' Cheese and that too was delicious, especially with the crumbs on top. My younger cousin told me she's still dreaming about their smothered baked potatoes.

If I could give this place more than 5 stars, I would! Wish I could go back soon."}
{"text":"Simply awesome. Nice people. Great food. 


Updated : 2/6/2016 Scratch  the friendly service. Young lady running the take out window today is rude rude rude. Minus 2 stars. It is 11:30 Sunday"}
{"text":"First time going here and I wanted to order everything on the menu! Small but awesome restaurant. Loved the pulled pork sandwich and Mac and cheese!!!"}
{"text":"This was our only go to for BBQ until Bobby Q came to Stapley/Baseline. NO comparison!! Our last visit to Joe's, the BBQ was average at best, the cole slaw was grouse I couldn't even eat it. The servings seemed so much smaller than Bobby Q's and for a few more dollars I realized we could have a MUCH better meal at Bobby Q's. I have been starving for a good BBQ place since moving here from the south 25 years ago Joe's is NOT IT! I will say Joe's is a good place for families of screaming kids running everywhere so if you have those this is your place."}
{"text":"Delicious meat that was perfectly prepared and cooked! Loved the atmosphere, and service & would have given it 5 stars if not for a couple of things. 1. It was unclear what the protocol for getting trays, menus, utensils etc. I had to go back into line 2 times for trays and menus. 2. The sides were at best, average. Potato salad was very bland, and the cole slaw was equally flavorless. All in all the superb meat and atmosphere made up for what the sides lacked though, and I give it a pretty strong thumbs up."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Arizona in my opinion.  There are better BBQ places in the country such as Spring Creek BBQ in Texas and Jim 'N Nicks in Alabama, but I highly recommend it whether you live in the Valley or are visiting from anywhere in the country including the places with great BBQ.  It's also in a quaint historic downtown Gilbert building and is a staple for Valley residents.

Also, you get a free meal on your birthday.  I went with my dad in January for his birthday.  Unfortunately, I missed going on mine in February."}
{"text":"Joes Bbq has been my go to Bbq joint for the last ten years. Everything I've tried has always lived up to my expectations, however i always go back to my chicken sandwich/Mac and cheese/cookie/lemonade. As my husband jokes, it would be my last meal on earth choice, which I can't deny! Make sure to take advantage of the pick up window, the lines can get a little crazy on Fridays and Saturdays but they move fast, don't be deterred. And the outside seating is lovely :)"}
{"text":"If you love BBQ, this place is for you.  

Nostalgic feel with a farm tactor sitting in the dining room.  Good selection of sides and the rootbeer is home made.  

Like Joe's Farm Grill, this place can draw a crowd and you'll be in for a long wait for service but timing is everything.

Can be a bit pricey is you load up but the quality of the food is top notch!

I'll definately be back."}
{"text":"To be totally honest, I wasn't really impressed with Joe's. That's a sad thing to say because it's pretty much a Gilbert staple. The pecan smoke flavor was okay, but I thought the sauce was very very runny and not to my taste. 

The other major issue that I had was the way that the soda fountain was set up. During busy times you weren't able to get refills without pushing past what seems like 100 people. 

I've given it a few different tries, but I think I'll stick with what I know to be my taste in BBQ here in the valley."}
{"text":"Really Excellent BBQ Experience!

OK, I must admit that Texas spoiled me when it comes to two types of food. BBQ & Tex-Mex.

For the last 10 years in Phoenix I have been trying different BBQ places to find something that I think will measure up to those experiences and I finally found Joe's BBQ in Gilbert.

My favorite BBQ item is Brisket. It has to be cooked right and not many now how to keep in the flavor and still get it to come apart. these folks do.

I would recommend you do two things. Go with a partner and share. You can split a sampler plate and a 11 pound baked potato between the two of you and still have food to take home.

Otherwise, order up the brisket and try a baker. the corn was great as well and I tried the coleslaw but it's a little too dry to be Texas style so you take your chances there.

the other menu item I really liked was the ribs. this surprised me as I usually find most BBO's tend to over cook them making them too dry and tough. Not the case here. these were tender, moist and flavorful and the Pecan wood used to slow smoke them gave a nice flavor.

The atmosphere was typical BBO family style seating and self serve condiments.

The best place I have had BBQ in Texas was Rudy's BBQ. They served great Brisket but did something else that these folks miss. They offered a hand full of sliced bread with it (not toasted), had fresh Sliced onion and pickles as condiments and served the BBQ sauce in squeeze bottles at the table.

Unlike Rudy's, they have none of the above here at Joe's and I hate having to get up and down to get BBQ sauce and I also hate filling up little cups of the stuff and duping it on my food.

That being said, I give it 4 of 5 stars for doing a great job up to this point and I would totally go back better prepared to devour some nice brisket.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Mesa a while back and this was one of my favorite places to eat right over in Gilbert.  Locally owned and oh so delicious.  I think their pulled pork and beef brisket are the best in town.  I still give the Blue Ribbon trophy for pork ribs to Famous Daves.

The sides here are also very good...everything is homemade and I'd recommend you try a Stuffed Baked Potato....they give you what seems like a 10 pound potato with all the fixings...and just when you think the tray will break from the sheer weight of it...they pack it full of whatever meat you want.  I would not recommend eating this thing on a lunch unless you have a very understanding boss for when you fall asleep at 2pm.

I wish I dident live so far away now. I have no decent BBQ near me...:("}
{"text":"This is a great BBQ joint.  The portions and prices are great so come h-u-n-g-r-y!  
There's lots of seating.  I wasn't too impressed with the sides and we tried 4 different kinds.  The ribs were the best and then the pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"Good for a fast service. Macaroni is great and the chocolate chip cookies have always been the best but we went yesterday and they didn't taste the same. The buns they serve the meat on aren't the best either they are rather dry. Tried the cheesy potatoes and they don't taste like cheesy at all. Just potato's with a creamy salt-less substance all over them. 3 others thought the same thing. The lemon cake is amazing though"}
{"text":"This place is to DIE for with BBQ. I have eaten at a ton of BBQ joints all across the USA including some of the best in the west in Texas and this place is at the too with BBQ. You will not be disappointed and the price is great as well."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb and if you don't like it, you don't know what good BBQ is. The ribs are fantastic, the pork is all smokey and juicy, the hot link rocks and the homemade sides are just like mom used to make, only better. My only beef with Joe's is they need to add another drink machine. Hate having to get back in line to get my drink on. Try the hot sauce, it's killer."}
{"text":"Excellent reliable BBQ and great serving sizes. My kids rated it 8/10. We ordered take out and were pleased with the fact that it was ready on time, had plenty of BBQ sauce, and they made sure everything we ordered was actually in the bag before we left (it's a 45 min round trip excursion to get take-out from Joe's so it's be a major bummer if our order wasn't right). BBQ beans are really good and made from a variety of beans and with some meat thrown in. I recommend the family pack from the take-out menu - great mix of meats with 2 pint-sized sides."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have been visiting my father who lives about 3 minutes away from Joe's for the past 4 years and I have never been here! It finally happened this past LDW. We walked in and smelled the BBQ in the air and instantly turned my mouth into water. There was a long line, almost reaching the door; however, the line moved really quickly! I was at the counter ordering within five minutes of arriving. I tried the BBQ sampler and was DEEEELICIOUS! The BBQ baked beans were awesome, as was their corn bread. The price was great! Total for two BBQ samplers, corn bread, four drinks, and a baked potato was shy of $40! I would definitely be visiting Joe's next time I am in town."}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better than this.  Good location, plenty of parking with a little walk, good food and good prices.  We go hear a lot on family events as well free birthdays.  This place never disappoints and can handle big groups."}
{"text":"The inside line can be a little discouraging when you first walk up but the food is well well worth it always a friendly stuff always clean good portions been coming here for years of my children absolutely love it"}
{"text":"Okay, so my first job at age 15 was washing dishes at Fiorello's BBQ in a Kansas City and have lived in Memphis and Chicago too.  I'm guessing that changed my genetics and the red in my veins is actually sauce.  So imagine my supreme joy upon finding Joe's Real BBQ.  You will love this quirky little place.  The sides are excellent, especially the beans, which are not to be missed.  The main items have all been excellent, but a favorite lunch is just their huge baked potato with meat on top.   See, you don't always have to get pulled pork or ribs to satisfy that addiction!  Although maybe you do need the beans every time.  Well, either way you will love the food, the ambiance and the new friends you will meet here.  So get going - now!"}
{"text":"We almost didn't go to this place because we heard alcohol is not served here... We are on vacation and like a drink with our meal. Another restaurant was a long wait, so we decided to go ahead with BBQ... SO glad we did!

It's a line order/seat yourself place, but the staff is friendly and helpful when trying to decide what to order.  In whole, we ordered several different meats.  I had the chicken bbq sandwich.  The chicken breast was so tender! And the bbq sauce is not too sweet, but full of flavor.  Loved it.  My son had the ribs and boy are they meaty!  He ordered a full slab thinking he'd be able to eat them all, but they were so full of meat, he probably could have ordered the half.  My husband had ribs and sausage. He tried my friend's ham and said if we ever come back he'd have the ham over the sausage... sausage still good, ham better.  I tried my friend's brisket and it was good as well.  It's pulled and had a different texture than I've had elsewhere, but it was still good.

They also make their own sodas. The favorite, by far, is the homemade rootbeer.  A must try if you go here!"}
{"text":"YUM!!! I take every person who comes to town to visit to Joe's BBQ. I've been here DOZENS of times and am never disappointed. I get lunch here every birthday :-)"}
{"text":"Comfort Food Galore! I went to Joe's for the first time last weekend and was blown away. I had the beef brisket which was lean, tender and fantastic. Joe's meat's are \"Pecan Smoked\" as it's clearly stated on the wall of the establishment. The mild BBQ sauce is a sweet contrast to the smokey meat...YUM! My friend and I ordered the mac and cheese and homemade applesauce for sides...again YUM! Portions are large and well worth it. I'm glad I didn't order the baked potato because they're huge and roughly the size of a Nerf football. Another great surprise was the homemade Root Beer. I don't consider myself a Root Beer drinker but the HOMEMADE Root Beer was the perfect drink to wash down my excellent meal. Try it because you'll like it. 
The next time I'm in Gilbert I'll see you at Joe's. If I'm not there I'll be across the street and the owner's other yummy restaurant."}
{"text":"Come early or be prepared to wait. The line often extends out the front door. It took me a couple trips to find my thing but we both enjoy the chopped brisket. My husband likes the baked potato with brisket on the side. The potato is big enough for 2-4 meals. Best BBQS we've had outside of Texas."}
{"text":"First time here and the food is Amazing! We had the jumbo beef brisket sandwich, half slab of ribs, mac n cheese, corn and salad. Everything tasted delicious! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Definitely enjoyed our dinner, will continue to come back."}
{"text":"It's difficult to put my love for Joe's into words, but I'll try.

The barbecue is by far the best I've ever had.  The root beer is awesome, the sides are awesome, the service is awesome.  The helpings are large so it's easy to split, plus the prices are good!

This family has done SO MUCH for the town of Gilbert that it feels great to support them, but I keep coming back for the awesome food."}
{"text":"Meats were delicious. Yummy! The rootbeer wasn't my favorite but we weren't there for the root beer."}
{"text":"I've lived in every big BBQ place, from Memphis to KC to Texas. Joe's Real BBQ is the best in the valley. The more I eat here the more addicted I become. The rib meat falls off the bone. Their brisket is tender and juicy. Pulled pork is delicious, and the chicken is good. The sides are awesome, my daughter and I crave their mac & cheese!  

One day I hope to try their desserts, but I'm always too full to even look at them.

Atmosphere here is good.  Very comfortable and friendly place."}
{"text":"Loved it. The atmosphere is great, awesome staff as well as a great place to take your kids. Best BBQ in Arizona, I think."}
{"text":"Best BBQ evvvvvvveeeerrrrr!!!! I love BBQ and this place does it right. The brisket is amazing, smoked turkey, chicken, everything! I love the sides, sweet potatoes, om nom nom, baked beans, corn bread, lemon cake. Nothing here is over seasoned, it's just right. A lot of BBQ places have gone the spicy route to cover up the fact they have a bland and tasteless meat, but not these guys, I'd even eat the meat without any sauce (what?!). Another plus is they're reasonably priced, perfect for lunch time or night out with the fam."}
{"text":"Good lord, the sampler! This place is on top of their BBQ game! In getting the sampler, I was treated to a mountain of meat, toast and two delicious sides! I gots to break down the meats... 

The chopped pork - smokey and delicious 

The bbq chicken - juicy and loaded with sauce

The brisket - wonderfully tender and flavorful 

The ribs - OH MY GOODNESS, THE RIBS! (best of the bunch!)

On the side I had slaw and potato salad, both of which were good, but tasted pretty standard. I did get to try some of the beans and the scalloped potatoes and those were pretty legit. Oh yeah! I almost forgot that I washed everything down with homemade root beer; that complemented the meal perfectly!

I really need to go back to try the sausages there, they looked just as good as everything else, but one man can only eat so much! I'll be back though, and soon."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! Joe's has it all - great food, friendly service, fun environment and decent prices. The place is one of the coolest restaurants around for families. Without a doubt, Joe's led the way for all of the other great restaurants that have come to downtown Gilbert over the past few years."}
{"text":"Very unique, small town atmosphere. Friendly and welcoming service. 
Free meal on your birthday.
BBQ brisket was tender and juicy. I would definitely rank it in the top for the Phoenix/West Valley/East Valley area.
Mac-n-cheese was creamy and delish. The baked beans are noteworthy - a mix of various types of beans with a bbq/smoky taste 
Prices and portion sizes are reasonable. 
I wil definitely come here again and try another bbq meat."}
{"text":"Some awesome barbecue here! 
I did think the prices were a bit inflated but that's pretty standard at barbecue spots. Nonetheless the food was good and I went home in a food coma!"}
{"text":"When I want the best BBQ that can be found in the Phoenix Metro area - I head for Joe's!!  There are other places that have great reviews - but I have little patience to stand in line for hours to eat and run the risk of the \"sold out\" sign going up right when I get to the front door.

Joe's always has very consistent high quality BBQ!!  Their home made Root Beer is a treat too!!   Fun old country atmosphere with tractor in the middle of the dining room.

Friends, family and business  -  always great BBQ at Joe's!!!"}
{"text":"IMHO some of the best cue in the valley I always get the BBQ sampler because everything is so good I can't decide"}
{"text":"I've been to Joe's Farm Grill before and I loved it. I've never been a huge BBQ guy but I've always heard so many good things that I had to give this place a try. I took the wife and 3 kids and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. Excellent food from scratch and friendly service. Finished off with a picture of the kids in front of the Tractor which they loved! Great job Joe! Liberty Market is next on the list!"}
{"text":"The meat is absolutely the star at Joe's.  That is how it should be when you go out for BBQ.  I have to say right off the bat, that for my taste, the sauce is way too sweet.  That is a personal preference so just bear that in mind.  I had the meat sampler and since I am not a chicken fan, I asked them to sub a hot link and they accommodated.  The amount of smoke flavor was perfect in the brisket. It had a great crust too and was very tender.  The ribs were falling off the bone, very meaty and delicious.  The pulled pork was also a little on the sweet side, but tender and tasty.  The stuffed baker is one of my wife's favorites.

The staff was very friendly, the service was fast and the sides were good as well.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I am a long time BBQ connoisseur. I participate in BBQ judging at the KC royal, and have spent a solid portion of my life in Kansas City. When it comes to good BBQ - Joe's is really your only choice in the Valley. BBQ pork, Beef brisket cannot be matched anywhere else. Now - Ribs, I can say my personal preference is not Joe's, but because they hit the mark so well in many other ways, I rate them a 5 star without hesitation."}
{"text":"I seriously eat here very regularly, sometimes even 2-3 times a week.  The food is always great and very consistent.  I'm not even sure exactly how they're cooking the meats but they have these giant smokers out back.  I know some of it sits in there for hours. It has a very home made down to earth family environment.  Everyone is always friendly and very helpful.  It's great food for a quick lunch or a huge get together for dinner.

I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"There is a lot of hype about this place but that's not the entire reason I went.  I've passed the place tons of times and it looks like a neat place that would most likely have decent BBQ.  Anyway, back to the hype.  I mean the place was on TV so it must have awesome BBQ, right?  I say wrong.

The food isn't horrible.  It is just ok when you compare it to other BBQ joints around town.  Here is what I tried.

* Ribs - These were just ok and look better than they are.  I think they were cooked too long or something.
* Chopped Brisket - This was the first time I've had chopped brisket.  It was just ok and I think I'll stick to sliced from now on.  I thought that it would be super duper tender being cooked in the sauce but it really wasn't.
* Sliced Brisket - This was pretty good.  The meat wasn't too lean which I liked.
* Chicken Breast - This was pretty good.  Very tender and tasty.  I think that it is processed meat, but I'm not positive.  If it is processed then shame on Joe.
* Cheesy Potatoes - I love cheese, I love potatoes and I love green chili.  This I did not love.  I think it needed more cheese and the potatoes should have been mashed instead of the chunks.  It was just weird.
* Mac N' Cheese - This was pretty good.  I would have liked it to be cheesier though.  I love the crunchy stuff on top whatever that is.  
* Sweet Cut Corn -   It wasn't, but it tasted canned.
* Chocolate Chip Cookie - Pretty good.  They are bigger and thicker than normal cookies.  It would have been awesome had it been fresh.
* The BBQ Sauces - The regular is pretty good but I loved the hot stuff.  It wasn't too over the top spicy and had a good flavor.  I also like that they don't drown their meats in sauce and let you do it yourself.

The decor of the place is great and pretty unique and very family friendly.  It complements the area excellently.  The place is clean and all the workers are fast and friendly.

I am generally not a fan of the whole cafeteria style grab-a-tray-and-get-your-food thing, but I guess that is part of the charm.  The biggest bummer is that there is only one place to fill your drink and that spot is in the middle of the ordering line so it is a bit awkward should you need a refill.  Do you cut in line?  Do you wait in line?  I opted to enter the line from the wrong end and cut some people to get my refill.

I love Liberty Market across the street and would like to try the Farm Grill in the near future.  I know there is a lot of hype surrounding the Farm Grill, but I will just have to see for myself if it lives up to it or not.  Joe has a great thing going and is a top-notch restaurateur.  He cares about his patrons as I will most likely receive a message from him on here about this review.  He sent me a note after my review of the Liberty Market (which I loved) to say thank you. 

In conclusion..... 

Would I rush back?  No.  Would I ever return?  Yes."}
{"text":"I flew in from Hermosa Beach to hang out with a really good friend that lives in Gilbert.  

We decided to stop here after my flight, for lunch.

We walk in and this place is so freaking cute that I almost peed my pants.  I appreciate this sorta place coming from a beach city and never seeing anything like this.  Everyone that worked here was super nice.

Home made root beer was great!

Pulled pork sandwich was great!

BBQ Beans were the best beans I've ever had! 
(pinto, lima, cowboy beans) YUMMO!

Potato Salad was bland, not what I expected but whatever.

THUMBS UP!!"}
{"text":"I can't rave about this place enough, everything is fantastic! Tender, juicy meats, scrumptious sides, HUGE root beer floats made w/home made root beer and home made ice cream, and a giant toppings bar. They're pretty quick even when there's a huge line, and portion sizes are generous. I would recommend the pulled pork and ribs in particular, but everything is great!"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices... Great outdoor area for families. Love the atmosphere. Great location in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Always great BBQ and consistent.  Whether we get take out or eat-in, there food is always good.  Even if a long line, it goes fast.  Don't miss out on the Mac and Cheese and cookie!!"}
{"text":"The food is great, and you can tell the owner's really care a lot about customer service and getting out in the community. It's served cafeteria style and the line gets REALLY long around lunch and dinner so be prepared to stand for a while if you catch the rush!"}
{"text":"I always leave here satisfied. The food's amazing. I live in Utah now, but whenever I come down to visit family, this place is on my list. I don't miss it. Try the Pork sandwich with spicy BBQ sauce, some root beer, and a piece of cake, and you're in heaven!"}
{"text":"The building is neat, the staff is friendly, the food is okay. It's a cafeteria setting: stand in line, grab a tray, pay and sit down. Not having to tip is a plus.

I actually prefer Honey Bears, Bobby Q and Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"This place was very cool! The employees are some of the nicest people ever. They were so helpful with the menu and giving suggestions. The food was really good, too. I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork with sides of mac and cheese and beans. Everything was delicious! They also make their own root beer and cream soda which are amazing. I highly recommend Joe's"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited for a late lunch. Food, atmosphere, and staff were all phenomenal. Legit delicious bbq and the homemade root beer was delicious as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Joe's is good, but it definitely isn't the best barbecue I've ever had. I think that my expectations may have been set too high after hearing tons of rave reviews from friends. I had a meat plate with sliced brisket, turkey jalapeño sausage, and a side of mac and cheese. To be honest, the brisket and the sausage were both kind of dry, but they were good when I added more of their original sauce. Their sauce is definitely good. My mom had the chicken, which was actually moist. Between our whole party, I got to try the cheesy potatoes, mac and cheese, potato salad, and coleslaw. All of the sides were really good. The homemade root beer is also fantastic. My only real complaint is that the layout of the restaurant is terrible. I don't recommend sitting in the booths on the south side. The line to order goes right past those booths. If you sit there, be prepared to be blocked in your booth by people standing in line. It feels crowded and not at all private. Some people were watching us eat and listening to our conversation while waiting in line, and we could barely get out of the booth and past the people standing in line to leave. It just didn't make for a very comfortable dining experience."}
{"text":"I am not trying to be a hater of BBQ but I am going to throw my review of this place in there and most of the rating has to do with the price and would I return or not.
Pros - food is served very quickly if you are in a hurry. Corn bread is very good and you always get a piece hot from the oven. 
Cons - The home made rootbeer is not as good as A&W but you may like it more than me. The food was Meh and I love BBQ maybe again you like it more than me but I do my BBQ a little different. The bread used was average at best. The prices was 26 dollars for 2 BBQ sandwitches and 2 sides each with corn bread and 1 drink. WOW did I fall asleep and wake up at Famous Dave's? 
Comments - This is a quick serve already made BBQ place kinda like a cafe at school but with higher up prices than what you would expect. I didnt eat all my food and would not return. I am meaning to go back to give Joe's Farm grill another try but with the gift card I was given I thought I would try something else for a change. I should have got a hamburger instead. :("}
{"text":"Okay, I gave this place five stars because I'm not a fan of BBQ and I LOVED it here!  If a restaurant can make me love something I never really cared for, it's something special.  Joe's is now one of those places I get a hankering for.  Hmmm...speaking of which, I think I need a visit!

It's loud and rowdy and made for families.  Inside their tables are big and welcoming and outside they're picnic-style.  No worries about wiggling kids, messy hands and loud voices here.  

Like the atmosphere, the food is perfectly kid-friendly: turkey, beef, pork and chicken, in all of its various BBQ'd forms - pulled, linked, brisket, rib and breast.  The 12 and under meals are well-priced.  At $4.49 and $5.49, they're heartier than the kid's meals you'll find at most fast-food restaurants.  The homemade sides include kid-favorites like mac n cheese, applesauce and cheesy potatoes.  

Try the huge potato (jumbo baker) and when I say huge, I mean it.  It's a one pound spud heaped with your favorite toppings - plus, you can get it with BBQ, too.  Your head may say, \"what?!\", but your tummy will say, \"thank you\".  

Come to think of it, everything there is huge, like the sampler plates.  Chances are you'll walk away with leftovers.  And...on your busiest, \"don't have time to cook\" nights - order take out and pick it up at their outdoor window.  That's as family-friendly as it gets!"}
{"text":"i had the pulled pork with a side of mac and cheese , sweet corn and corn bread! we were actually going to get postinos across the street but due to parking and it looked packed we figured we try some bbq! it was great everything had flavor i will be coming back"}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ! Pulled pork bbq sandwich with coleslaw and bbq pit beans were awesome! Desserts were great as well (I've had the lemon cake and pecan brownie). Only thing missing are sweet potato fries!!"}
{"text":"Joe's catered my wedding 2 weeks ago and it was amazing! From the great pricing to the delivery and the overall quality of the food, it was outstanding. Everyone was talking about how great the food was! Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"ASTHMA WARNING: I am sad to say out of all of the Joe's places in town this is the only one that I will not be back to. My family and I had been wanting to try this place every since we first tried the terrific Ribs and Waffles at Joe's farm Grill.  We stopped by for lunch one Saturday in March or April. We were early and there was no wait  so you would expect everything to be fresh, but the mac and cheese was pretty dry and tasteless. I am sure we got a bad batch because so many people seem to like this dish. But the meat was great. I love meat so this was the most important thing to me, but I can't speak for my son. He was a little sad about the mac and cheese. 

Anyway the problem was the smoke in the restroom. I am not sure if it is always like that day or not, but I had a severe asthma attack in the restroom because the smoker seemed to be venting right into the ladies room. I didn't have an inhaler with me because I hadn't been having asthma. I had to rush to my car, not running because I already couldn't breath, praying that there would be one of my inhalers there. I didn't even even stop at the table to tell my husband what happened. I just left. Luckily there was an inhaler in the car but I wont be back to find out about the mac and cheese situation. I just would strongly advise going into the restrooms if you do have any lung problems.

I do love the whole concept and the family friendly theme though. So eat at the Farm Grill or Liberty Market if you want Joe's quality in a lung safe environment."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ in the nation. The brisket is the best I have ever had. When ordering a side dish, get the baked beans. This is a great place for large groups especially when the weather is nice. They have lots of outdoor seating and a grassy area for the kids to play. Don't let a long line scare you. It moves quickly and it is worth any wait.  Joe's started the restaurant/foodie scene in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"This place is cute, but downtown Gilbert is like that for the most part. Very down to earth, friendly, and homey!

We were on this side of town, and decided that instead of braving traffic; we would just go ahead and have supper here and proceed on home at later time.

We chose Joe's Real BBQ because we heard so many good things about it. After all, both my partners live in Gilbert. And they should know, right?

When we walked in, we were greeted by a friendly hostess who introduced herself and got us acclimated to the their offerings. We were both famished, and everything seemed so appetizing.

I chose the BBQ combo (pulled pork and chicken), and my Beloved had the sliced Beef Brisket. We walked up to the counter, and that's when our experience started diminishing. It must've been a off-day in Gilbert because the cashier that took our order was none too pleasant. 

We ignored her as we walked to our table, after placing our order. We sat at one of the side booths that had a few tables. Alongside side us sat a couple that just didn't seem all that happy. As they were about to partake of their food, one of the young bussers came up to them, and cheerfully asked how their food was. 

Wrong question!

The man turned to him, and said, \"If you were paying attention, you'd notice that I haven't taken a bite of the food yet. So, why don't you go to that couple over there (pointing to us) and bother them with your stupid questions!\"

Well, so much our initial impressions. Now that busser was in a mood, he wasn't all that friendly and accommodating when we came over to OUR table.

This was spiraling downward faster than a falling rocket.

The piece de resistance of downward spirals was when we received the food, and mine was completely dry and tasteless, and my Beloved's Beef Brisket had some type of large congealed meat that was mixed in that was absolutely atrocious.It completed detracted from what could have been a good piece of Beef Brisket. Who knows? And we will never find out!

Needless to say, we were done at that point. The only reason that I didn't rate them a 1 was due to the fact that I have heard and read such great things about this place. Furthermore, we have never struck out this badly eating in Gilbert.

We will endeavor to eat here another time, when the stars and planets don't align to cause this unfriendly maelstrom wherein people forget to take their daily \"chill pills!\""}
{"text":"Food:  Extremely good.  Great pulled pork and about the most tender brisket I've had. Be sure to try both types of bbq sauce... the 'IDAREYOU' sauce is hot but not quite as hot as one would expect from the name... most people should be able to take it and IMO the best is probably a mix of the two sauces they offer.  Side dishes were a bit mixed... mac n cheese was flat out the best I've ever had (hope you're not on a diet for that one) and the beans were the best and most unique I've had at ANY BBQ joint (chunks of meat, peppers, and three different kinds of beans in a smokey hot mess that made me feel like a chain-smoker trying to quit when I was deciding whether or not to go and get a second helping of it...).  They are both a must try.  Cole slaw and potato salad were both a pretty big miss from my perspective, no bite in the cole slaw (we actually took some home and added some vinegar and then it was right proper) and the potato salad was also bland (it actually had an interesting spice that I had not had in potato salad before, but just not nearly enough of it.  We also had the root beer float as a shared dessert and that was fantastic.

Ambiance:  Minimal.  Cafeteria-style eating.

Service:  Employees were nice enough but totally busy.  Given that not much service is expected, this wasn't much of a big deal.  Food is prepped to-order and takes about two mintues from when you order it in the line.  When we were there a rather intimidating line of over 20 people disappeared in about 10 minutes.

Prices:  Average.  Probably $12-$14/person.

Net:  If love good BBQ and are from the area, you've GOT to try this place.  The meats are melt-in-your-mouth good, and the mac n chese and beans are must-haves.   The couple of misses on the other sides and the near-warehouse style eatery sway this from 5 to 4 stars, but if you don't care about those things, you can go there and have a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"This is one in the world, only can say all is amazing, food, place, service, the barbecue is more than great, the sals, but the potatoe is to die for, you can't find nothing better than these, this is an other significant about potatoe, just baked, big! wow!!! I jus have to go again!"}
{"text":"I would have given this a higher rating except for the prices.  Ok - in this economy, I am lucky to be able to eat out at all.  However, $11 for their smallest sandwich and two small sides and a drink ($1.99 each!!) is a little pricey especially if you have a family to feed.  They should consider making it a buffet since they charge buffet prices or giving you a little more for you money.

But, yes, the food is good."}
{"text":"Second time here and wasn't as good as the first time. This time around... the Brisket was very fatty and the mac n cheese was dry.

Pork ribs were good. 

Please work on consistency :/"}
{"text":"Just a followup since MH and I went there last night after Stellar Adventures - totally a snap decision but we each had had only a granola bar all day. 

Ok, so he wasn't enthused about it before but that all changed once he got a taste of the beef brisket and hot bbq sauce. More on that later. So we had the corn, mac&ch, and potato salad as sides - my favorite was the latter. However, MH felt in future he would just go for the meat. Nice bread and cornbread. Wasn't too thrilled with the honey butter - it was nice but I felt the bread was sweet enough without it. 

he really loved the sauce though. Before we left, he added more to the leftovers. Since we ate early, the second half came out at 11 or so. Imagine my surprise when he came barreling (yes, I mean this)  in afterwards, literally breathing fire at me! \"My god, in quantity that stuff is spicy!\" And I don't know what was in it but he was in \"I can lift-you-up kick - which I haven't seen in like 9 years. Bouncing with energy! Does it confer a superhero complex on one, or what???

glad I bought a bottle - can do this experiment again ... :-)"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food, the atmosphere (despite the cafeteria style like line - I think it sorta adds to its charm), and the atmosphere are totally on point. 

Everyone I've taken here loves it. It's just really good. I personally was won over by the bottled sodas and the cheesy potatoes. Don't get me wrong, the pulled pork is fantastic too, but you don't see bottle sodas very often, and I heart potatoes. 

It's also located in a really cute part of Gilbert which looks like an old town of somesort (forgive my ignorance, I'm a newbie here.)"}
{"text":"This place is literally THE BEST place to go for bbq in AZ and even CA. I know, bold statement, but it's truly amazing. I usually get the sampler which includes pork ribs, beef brisket, pulled pork and bbq chicken. You can't go wrong at Joes."}
{"text":"OK BBQ. Pretty expensive for the serving size."}
{"text":"Normally I would say the takeout experience is great but tonight's was very frustrating. We asked for pints of mac and cheese and corn and when we got it home that isn't what we got. When I called to point out the mistake they apologized and said well we did charge you for the smaller size so what do you want us to do? She basically had no clue that she should have credited us or get us a gift card for the mistake. It seems like they really don't give a rip about their service. Sad!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to love this place. Great location, excellent service, and nice atmosphere. The food is just okay.

Brisket was sort of dry, and served chopped and sauced. Pulled pork had very little flavor to it, same thing with the Chicken breast. Coleslaw didn't have much seasoning to it. The baked beans were decent. The potato salad was tasty.

Maybe I'm a BBQ snob because I've had some excellent options in other cities I've lived in. I don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"Very tender meat and the sauces are very flavorful. Ordered the pulled pork and sliced brisket with pit beans. Both the pulled pork and brisket were done very well. They were incredibly tender and nowhere did I need a knife to cut since they pretty much melted on command. The meats were not smokey or salty. The pit beans were and interesting combo. I'll try a different side next time. Their sweet sauce is very flavorful. Their hot sauce really hits the spot. I couldn't decide which one I liked better - maybe the hot sauce. The only downside I could think of was the soda fountain is difficult to access since you have to climb over people in line to get a refill. They also don't let you sit on the tractor. :-("}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place as much as I love Joe's Farm Grill but regrettably I don't. It has a very pleasant \"cookout\" atmosphere and the staff are wonderful but the bottom-line for me is that the cue is not that good.  It's dry and lacks any hint of smoke.  And the sides I've tried. -- slaw, mac n cheese and baked beans -- were just ok too. I did like the house made lemonade however. Try Joe's Real if you're in the area but IMHO it is not worth a long trip."}
{"text":"So far, I have tried all three of Joe's restaurants: Joe's real BBQ, Joe's Farm Grill, and Liberty Market. I love them all but I think this is probably my favorite. I order the same meal here every time I go because it is just that good. Its the chopped BBQ Brisket sandwich with a side of mac and cheese and sometimes sweet corn if I am super hungry. The sandwich is huge, the meat has a great flavor, and the mac and cheese is some of the best I have ever had. I mean, come on, they crush up cheeze it's or goldfish and put them on top to make a crust. If that isn't love, I don't know what is! The corn is good but corn is corn, how bad can you screw it up? I've also had their beans before and they are really good except I am not a fan of lima beans so I kinda wish they were left out. Oh and Joe's has this great onion relish to put on your sandwich that is unlike anything I have ever tasted!!! If you are a fan of onions and you go to Joe's, you must try this stuff. 
I have also tried both types of cake, lemon and rootbeer and although they were both good, I would have to say that the lemon is the clear winner. 
The only thing I would say that I don't like about Joe's is where the drink dispensers are. Its a real pain to get a refill if there is a line. Also, you better make sure you pick up everything you will need when your going through the line unless you want to have to push past people later on to get what your missing. 
Joe's is definitely one of the best BBQ joints in the Phoenix area. Keep it up Joe!!!"}
{"text":"This place was supremely disappointing. The water smells like a fish tank. The brisket was so salty it was inedible. The pulled pork was so overcooked there was no more discernible meat texture left, it was just pure mush. The plates are served with a really weird, soggy, very strongly rosemary herb bread, which might have been ok if it wasn't served soggy. 

And the prices were pretty high for what you get... For $15+ a plate I would expect an edible dish. 

I would have gone one star, but I'll include the extra one because the outside seating is really quaint and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, choices and family atmosphere, if not to hot you can go to their open seating area and enjoy the view of downtown"}
{"text":"Omg.  Nom nom nom. Get the baked beans and mac and cheese with your pulled pork!"}
{"text":"I come here when my friend visits from out of town as she loves this place. Personally I think it's just alright, but then again I am not a huge BBQ fanatic. My favorite thing here is the cornbread with the sweet honey butter! These square blocks are soft, fluffy and delicious!

A few months ago when i visited they had chicken wings that was really good. On this last visit I was hoping to get those again but I didn't see it on the menu which sucked!"}
{"text":"Overall, Joe's Real BBQ has become my favorite \"go to\" BBQ spot in Phoenix (Gilbert specifically).  The prices are reasonable, the meat is always excellent quality and the sides are amazing.  Their baked beans are like candy.  This place gets very busy and a little hectic, but the food is worth the wait.  If you're living in the East Valley (of Phoenix) and you want great BBQ hit up Joe's.  You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Joe's BBQ for pretty much as long as I can remember and have never been disappointed. This is one of those things I just CRAVE. Actually, this, Joe's Farm Grill and Liberty Market are all crave-able. That Joe is doing something right, for sure.

My favorite item here is the stuffed baker. A GIANT (yes, HUGE, ENORMOUS, MASSIVE) potato is baked to perfection and then smothered in butter, sour cream, cheese and chives. Then, you choose which magnificent meat you'd like piled on top. I usually go for the pulled, but I switch it up with the chopped brisket now and then. Drench in their famous BBQ sauce and smile. This is always enough for two meals.

Everything else is awesome too. Ribs are perfect. Chicken breast is so moist and flavorful. I love all of the sides. Everything just tastes homemade and perfect. I'd have to say the cheesy potatoes are my favorite. And don't forget to try the homemade root beer. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I'm a definite Joe's loyalist.   I love the sweet flavor of their hot BBQ sauce.  I could pour that stuff over just about anything and eat it."}
{"text":"Super good BBQ everything is so tender and flavorful! The beans are a must if you want to have the full experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great location!  God the BBQ chicken and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Been coming to Joes for 15 + years. Had not been in over a year so decided it was time again. Had ham and brisket , wife had pulled pork. Ham and brisket excellent , pulled pork not so much. Very mushy and fatty. Sides good as usual, atmosphere always fun. Prices a little on the high side but do give you alot of food.  Overall Joes remains a solid place to eat. Sure not the best bbq in Arizona but consistent ."}
{"text":"It is a really cool set up. The whole place is kind of like a buffet counter but the meats are amazing. You have to try the BBQ beans! We ordered at the window because we had our doggie. The window is right around the corner and there is access to the picnic outdoor area. Lovely sunday lunch!"}
{"text":"It just wasn't that great to me.  It's fine for BBQ and the baked beans were different (in a good way) but it just wasn't up to the hype I had  heard about from so many different people."}
{"text":"Great brisket and BBQ chicken with really good root beer. Friendly service,and good prices.Makes it a family friendly place to eat."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in AZ!

Worth the drive from Phx to Gilbert just to eat at IMO"}
{"text":"Hands down favorite BBQ in the Valley!  Love the over-sized baked potato & the pulled pork - delish!  Homemade root beer completes the meal!  I'm not a fan of the sides and I've never had room for desert but potato and pork are delicious enough to satisfy me every time."}
{"text":"Stopped by with a friend for lunch.  The cafeteria style set up is off putting at first but it gives you an opportunity to see what the entries look like when ordering.  Joe's is located in downtown Gilbert in an old brick building with a covered patio on the side.  It is a pretty good size place with plenty of options for seating.  The BBQ smoke smells fantastic as you enter.  I had the two meat combo (ribs and pulled pork) and my companion had a pulled pork sandwich.  Both were very good, fall off the bone ribs and moist and tender pulled pork.  Good but not great BBQ sauce options.  We had Mac N' Cheese and Cole Slaw sides which were tasty.  Would definitely stop back."}
{"text":"super delicious food here! The prices are somewhat reasonable but it's worth it, the Root Beer here is something that needs to drank every visit"}
{"text":"10 years ago when we moved to Gilbert this seemed like a genuine BBQ house that had a quaint little charm to it.

Now it seems almost overly commercialized and has lost the home town feel.  The food is still better than most BBQ in AZ, but that isn't saying much.  Anyone who tells you this is tremendous BBQ has never been to Kansas City or Memphis.

Definitely a great place to take the family and get well fed, but don't expect a mouth changing experience.  They do a good job catering."}
{"text":"This place is just ridiculously amazing. First time I've seen a place that makes their own root beer. Everything here is so good, sides and all. Hands down to this place for making such a fantastic BBQ experience!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork BBQ sandwich was great.  Cole slaw is excellent and beans are the best I have tasted anywhere. Dine next to a tractor!  Joe does it right!"}
{"text":"After parking my car, I smelled something wonderful coming out of a small window in an otherwise blank wall.  If it wasn't for that, I probably would have walked by and never noticed Joe's.

We ended up getting a meat plate with chopped brisket and pulled pork.  The meat was so tender and juicy I had to spoon it up as it would almost fall off the fork.  The sauce so tangy and flavorful.  And the corn bread, unfortunately not considered a side, was absolutely fantastic.  

The best part was the ranch house style and setup of the place."}
{"text":"The chicken was a dry. And the cheesy potatoes were not great or recommended. But everything else was great. Had the sample plate. Get BBQ sauce on the side. Smothered is best."}
{"text":"5 plus stars for decor ..I am a sucker for that whole post modern retro  vintage look...  Love it. I  love the John Deer Tractor in the dining room and the old wood everywhere , I love that it still looks like a store front and has a rich red paint on the inside .I love the cafeteria style serving with the old fashioned look to it. I even adore the old retro sodas in a tin. 

But I have to say 3 stars for food . The ribs did not have the flavor that I crave  with ribs. I  see  and smell the smokiness,but there was almost too much sweetness with the overbearing sauce, it was nice but not delicious.  The coleslaw tasted like they ran down to Smart and Final and bought the big bag of coleslaw mix and the jar of coleslaw dressing ..boring and bland.  
The mac and cheese however was super  yummo. Baked with a cheesy crunchy top that made it  comfort food. I also really like the cornbread, not too sweet not too bland  and honey butter very delish. 
We also had an interesting dessert Sweet potato crunch that I am still pondering  a mash of sweet potato with a creamy texture with a bit of nuts and brown sugar. Ice Cream cut the richness . 

I want to adore Joes ,I want to say it's an all around winner . i want to sit in the restaurant and enjoy the decor, but maybe I 'll go for the cornbread. 

Hey Parents--The kids menu is a rib sandwich ...which wouldn't have been a hit with my kiddo...."}
{"text":"THE WAIT

The first time I tried to eat at Joe's Real BBQ there was a line out the door that ended at the stoplight down the sidewalk (there was some sort of LDS convention). So I decided to try it another day since I didn't want to stand in line for 30 minutes. It took about 10-15 minutes in line when I tried this place for lunch on Saturday. So bring a book if you want to eat at Joe's.

THE FOOD

I had the sliced brisket with beans and coleslaw. This is known as the 1/2 pound meat plate that includes two sides. My wife had the chicken. They just dribble a little bit a BBQ sauce onto your meat so you have to make a separate trip to their BBQ Sauce station to get more sauce. I thought the brisket tasted ok, I have had better. The BBQ sauce wasn't anything spectacular. And the beans were just ok for me, kind of like a three bean salad cooked in a sauce. The coleslaw definitely failed. 

THE BEVERAGE

I had the run of the mill refillable soda from the machine. The problem with the refill is that you have to excuse yourself through a line of people to get to the machine. There were actually people waiting in the food line to refill their drinks. That's why I'm glad I sent my wife out on that refill mission. I can imagine the pissed off people that were thinking that you're cutting in line. So the logistics with the soda machine is a complete fail.

CROWD CONTROL

I would hate to be eating in a booth next to the line. Kind of awkward to get out of the booth to get more bbq sauce or a refill and then you have people steering (get it, steer instead of stare) at you as if you were in a fishbowl. Something needs to be done with the table configuration.

CONCLUSION

In my opinion the brisket is probably the best that I have tasted in Arizona (How I miss Smoque) but the lack of ambiance kills it for me. I would suggest you just order take out and not dine in."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out from Joe's for Monday Night Football.  I called in the order and actually had to call back twice to make changes, and the girls taking the order were super nice and patient.  

With a 20 minute (or so) drive home, the food wasn't exactly piping hot and the turkey jalapeno sausages we ordered had gotten quite cold and a bit rubbery.  I tried nuking them but still not that great.  It's a shame.  They are probably much better when fresh.  I will say though that the BBQ sauce is AMAZING, and both my husband and our friend absolutely LOVED the brisket.  The sides were simply \"ok\" (we tried the cheesy potatoes, potato salad, and mac n' cheese).

All in all, final verdict is that I will have to go back, eat the food fresh, and review again.  Stay tuned.  And in the meantime, go and have the brisket."}
{"text":"You have to go to Joe's Real BBQ!  I friend of mine who lived in Gilbert first took me to this place about four years ago.  Since then Joe's has become a staple.  Not only did I first meet my future husband in this restaurant but we also had them cater our wedding this past month!

The mac n cheese so incredibly good and the pit beans are super rich and satisfying.  The salad with the corn and bean relish with homemade bbq ranch is to die for.  Even after becoming vegetarian last year I still eat at Joe's for the wonderful sides and the best bbq sauce I have ever tasted.  Vegetarians can enjoy a huge baked sweet potato or regular potato (plus a number of sides like salad, cheesy potatoes, mac n cheese, applesauce, corn, etc).  A must-have is the homemade root beer.  It finishes the meal.  I also enjoy the root beer cake but my husband thinks it is just ok.  He is not much of a sweets man anyway.  The root beer cake is a unique item to try whether you are a sweets person or not.  My husband the meat-eater loves every meat he has tried there- chicken breast, turkey sausage, brisket, and pork.  He always seems to go back to the chicken and turkey sausage though.  I used to love the pieces of brisket soaked in bbq sauce before leaving the world of meat-eating.  Whatever you do savor the bbq sauce; mild or spicy are both delicious!

Thanks Joe's for always serving great food and for doing a great job of catering our wedding!  Our guests were able to go back for seconds and many kept telling me how delicious all of the food was!"}
{"text":"There were 4 of us that ate at Joe's Real BBQ last nite.  It was absolutely the worst meals all of us ever had.  My husband had a half rack of pork ribs that he said had to have been on the grill for days. Dry wasn't the word for them.  I had a sandwich and the outside of the bun was hard and the pork was very dry.  Our friends had a bake potato with brisket on it and it looked black it was very bad and her husband had ribs and a brisket and he said the meat was very dry also.  We will never go back even if it was for free.  Shame on Joe's.  I guess we all should have taken our meals back and demanded our money.  Yuck!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am always looking for something original in the Phoenix area, and Joe's BBQ is definitely one of those few places. The food is really great (I'm generally not much of a red meat eater, but I love the brisket sandwich). The atmosphere is pleasant too, with plenty of booths and tables and outside picnic tables (or you can get takeout at the window on the south side of the building). Don't let the line scare you; it moves quickly, and if you go off hours (1 or 2 PM, even on weekends), you can find an indoor table immediately."}
{"text":"Be ready for very casual, cafeteria style dining.  No need to dress to impress, although I have seen multiple groups of people in evening attire at this restaurant.  I think they must go for the great food regardless of being over dressed.

Favorites: Beef brisket sliced, sweet cut corn, mac n cheese, and spicy BBQ sauce.

A delicious MUST TRY restaurant!  The pricing is a little steep, but we're all willing to pay."}
{"text":"Our family has been going to Joe's since it opened. From day one to the present it is consistently excellent for both the food and service. We have not found a BBQ restaurant that we like better than Joe's. Our favorites are the Turkey and Beans, both are amazing! If you have never tried this down town Gilbert gem, you are truly missing out."}
{"text":"Family favorite since it has opened. They have a wide selection of pecan smoked BBQ. My favorite is the bone in dark meat chicken and I like to get the potato salad in the side. They also have their own root beer which is delicious."}
{"text":"Love Joe's, but was really bummed on Father's Day to stand in the line (that part was fine) and be told at the counter \"we're out of ribs, pulled pork and sliced brisket\".  In other words...we're out of what most people come for.  I get that perhaps they were slammed on Father's Day, but we were there around 6:00 for dinner.  Disappointing, but will return!"}
{"text":"I ate here more than a year ago, and I still remember it. This place served me the best Pulled Pork Sandwich I've had in my life. I will go back with friends as soon as we get the chance!"}
{"text":"I love the food.  I wish they'd take the booths out along the South wall where you line up to place your order and move the drinks area so you don't have to fight the hungry people to get a refill but once you're past that, it's worth the wait.  Stuffed baker is the way to go, best of all worlds!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow some of the best barbecue ive had in Phoenix, this place is recommended to me by another friend and let me say the brisket is phenomenal. The brisket was moist had a bit of bark from the rub just like in Texas. I also got the turkey jalapeno sausage which was excellent , with a side of beans and potato salad both we're great favors in every bit. The sliced bread you get with every meal is awesome, they also have a sidebar were you can get pickles banana peppers condiments extra sauce etc. these folks definately Know what they're doing take a drive to downtown Gilbert check this place out"}
{"text":"BBQ in Gilbert, AZ....hmmmm. I was skeptical at first, but this place was good.  There was a line to the door, so that was a good sign.  I decided to play it safe and get a chopped brisket sandwich and side.  It was tasty, and a I got a good portion size for the price.  The decor is done well, and they have lots of outdoor seating which we enjoyed because the weather was nice. I can see coming here with a large group and having fun at an outside table.  My side was the cheesy potatoes, and I think it was a little dry.  

Overall, it's good BBQ.  I can't really give it four or five stars because we have many places in Texas that are better, but Joe's will give you a good meal at a good price."}
{"text":"Just ok, a solid 3 out of 5. Brisket was dry, Bbq sauce wasn't special, Turkey jalapeno sausage about store bought grade. Pulled pork was a 4 out of 5. There famous root beer cake didn't even taste like root beer much. I had high expectations from the reviews. Maybe in Gilbert area Bbq is hard to come by?"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that nothing was wrong about my experience at joes. I was in town visiting and saw the reviews and thought I would give it a shot. I ordered the jumbo sandwich with brisket and pulled pork with BBQ beans without a drink. It was tasty and I enjoyed my time there but all in all I thought the price was a bit high for what it was. I think everyone should give it a chance but for me it wasn't anything to rave about as I typically would when I find a great hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. It was one of the first locally own restaurants I can to when I moved to Arizona. Love the old fashioned atmosphere. Great food great root beer"}
{"text":"Recently ate at Joe's for the second time and was disappointed. I love Liberty Market and Joe's Farm Grill, but Joe Real BBQ has a lot to learn from its sibling restaurants.

The food we had was pulled pork, cheesy potatoes, corn. All 3 were in order were dry, dry and soupy/flavorless.

I love some good barbeque, I hope this was an off night for the real cooks that I had the first time."}
{"text":"Pulled pork, homemade root beer, awesome sandwiches, and the best part is they have a pick up window for that gotta go kind of day.
So you don't have to go inside you can enjoy it at home within minutes of ordering"}
{"text":"Solid barbeque, but I dislike having to get up for refills quite often because of their small coffee cups. I do like the cafeteria style service, but wish they would put a menu along the side of the wall because the lines are long and I feel that would expedite things. Thoroughly enjoy their root beer and corn bread.  They have an outdoor seating area, but can't really comment on that as I've never sat outside.  Also, there is a side window for carry out, so you never have to battle the crowds inside."}
{"text":"I cafeteria style was very quick and efficient. We went with a big group and it worked out very well. 

The food was tasty and everything was stress free. I will return and try the lemon cake next time."}
{"text":"Joe Johnson is such a caring man and I love how he always look after his community.  Not too many restaurateur have that type of commitment.  That being said,  I like coming to Joe's during non-peak hours so I don't have to wait in that slow moving line.  The bbq here is a hit & miss.  Sometimes the ribs & chicken are too dry other time they are good.  The 2 different sauces help it go down.  The sides are nothing special, but apple crisp dessert is worth a try.  The service is down to earth.  I really like the ambiance of this place.  Kids are allow to run as much as in the outside yard  without anyone giving you dirty looks.  The prices are good. I like bringing my out of town guest here (as long as they're not from a BBQ country)"}
{"text":"Some of the best pulled pork sandwiches we have had! The cheesy tomatoes were beautiful. Love the area too. Go a little early, it gets busy."}
{"text":"The sweet tea is amazing, just like it is down south. It's a cute place with a great outdoor space. Great setting for family get togethers! The pulled pork sandwich was good but a little dry though they provide free sauce. The condiments are all available for free. The Mac n cheese has baked cheez it's on top and it's so creamy and good. The potatoes were kind of strange they had a stale after taste, my friend thinks it's the cheese which may be too sharp! The lemon cake is to die for and you get a big hunky piece of it!"}
{"text":"Went to Joes BBQ for the first time tonight and what a major disappointment . Spent 34.$ for 2 meals , to get more fat blobs then meat, dried out cornbread and bland Mac & cheese.  The only thing good about this meal was the root beer and the polite staff.  Won't bother with this restraunt again."}
{"text":"The food is great! The make their own root beer. All the meat is good, but the pork ribs, pull pork and the sliced brisket are GREAT!!! Lines can get out the door. They have a to go window on the outside. Portions are small and the price slightly higher, but great taste."}
{"text":"This place is so good, that I got sick after eating here once and still wasn't turned off! 
( In all fairness it may have been caused by eating too much) 

The line always looks long, but waiting time is very short.

The menu isn't huge, but they make what the got WELL 

I love the picnic style outdoor seating 

It's a great family place for kids. 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"All the other reviews for this place are right on the money - I think your experience will be greatly influenced by the time of day and how busy it is when you give it a try! My husband and I came in the early afternoon on a weekday; there were only three other people in the entire restaurant and we were able to take our times looking at the menu and ordering. The staff was friendly and very patient. We grabbed our food and headed to the outdoor seating (it was a nice day) and enjoyed our meal under the canopy. The meat was flavorful, but not over the top amazing. I would definitely come back here and try a few other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Our go to BBQ place. Cafeteria style and when busy, it's hard to find tables. Other than that, great food, great prices, great people. An AZ tradition.

Some of my favorites include the ham and turkey combo plate, beans (not just beans but also meat), the buttery corn, the mac and cheese (such a guilty pleasure) and the homemade apple sauce.  Really, you can't go too wrong with anything from Joe's.  It's good stuff!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat.  I have enjoyed everything I have ordered, especially the pulled pork sandwiches and stuffed potato with turkey on top.  Favorite sides are the mac n cheese, beans, and applesauce."}
{"text":"I go here often--because I live in a house full of males.  Males that must consume honey slathered carcasses on a regular basis.

Joe's is good BBQ, can't deny that.  

But don't go if you care about variety, scene or a calorie intake.  I get the baked potato (cause it seems \"sorta\" healthy next to my other options).  But watch out!  Your reflexes have to be lightening quick in order to stop them from adding a pound of butter to the tater ;)  

If you feel like splurging, the classic cokes in glass bottle are a wonderful add-on.  They also have an assortment of old-style candies."}
{"text":"HOWDY Y'ALL!!!  I first sampled Joe's Real BBQ take out when I was at a get together at a friends house in Gilbert, and I swore to check out the restaurant next time I was in Gilbert, and I am sure glad I did!!!

Joe's BBQ is located in downtown Gilbert ... It's easy to locate due to great signage right on the corner of a block ... There seemed to be ample parking close by, which I found right away.

When you walk in its a very relaxed country style atmosphere with vintage items like a john deer tractor and an old gasoline pump - loved it!

There is ample seating both inside when you first walk in, then there was another air conditioned seating area next door, and then there was also a lot of outdoor seating at picnic tables.  It even looked like there was some corn-hole games set up outside in the grass - what a super cool fun space!!! 

If you have never been in here it may be a bit confusing at first, so feel free to ask for help as I did ;) When you order food it's done in a cafeteria like fashion and if there's a lot of people in line it's best to know what your going to get before you step up to the plate ;) 

I decided to get a large \"to-go\" order and I mentioned to the people helping me that this was my first time there so I may appear to be a little lost/spaced out,  The gentleman assisting everyone with their orders was very kind and patient.

I decided to try a meat plate with two meats, two sides, and two pieces of corn bread.  I went with the brisket that was chopped up, the turkey sausage, the Mac n cheese, and the BBQ beans.
 
The food was amazing despite the fact that I live about 20min away - the brisket here is awesome - very tender and with BBQ sauce it becomes the bomb.com ... The turkey sauce is very good too.  The Mac n cheese is a lil bit burnt to perfection, which I love, and WOWZA these BBQ beans are prob my fav beans of all time - no joke!  There is a bunch of stuff in these beans, and I'm not even sure of all that's in them, but they rock!  The corn bread is good, not the best I've ever had, but when you add their special butter they go from good to very good!!!

All the staff I encountered at Joe's was great and everyone was very helpful since I was a bit slow and unsure of what to order since I was a first timer.  When I left I noticed that they even had an outdoor spot on the side of the building where you could place/pick up orders, which was pretty snazzy if I say so myself ....

I would rate Joe's real BBQ a solid 4.5 stars if that was possible - the staff was pleasant, the food was veeeery good - I can't say it's the best BBQ I've ever had, but it was up there, and most importantly for the fairly large portion size I think the prices are reasonable .... Heck yeaaa Y'all I recan that I'm a Joe's fan, and I will be back reaaal soon to mack on more of that deeeeelicious brisket!!  And I would absolutely recommend others to come dine at Joe's too! ;)"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like it!  I've been on the hunt for good bbq in Arizona... and I figured I love Joe's Farm Grill, why wouldn't i love their BBQ place?

Nope.  I didn't love it.  Truth be told... It broke my heart.  Ok.  So my expectations were kinda high.  I was raised in Kansas City so I feel like BBQ sauce runs through my veins.  I'm obsessed.  But when I tried the pulled pork, it was so dry... even after i coated it in sauce, it was still dry.  How is that possible??  The brisket... super dry & a little cold.  WHAT!

I liked the decor.  I liked the atmosphere.  But the food was just so mediocre that I just don't know... I feel bad for Arizona people who think that this is a BBQ god-send.  

I really want to like this place so I'm going to give it another chance.  I'm hoping things will be different so I can update my review.  :\"}
{"text":"Has it really been two years since I updated my review here?  Well, I guess there isn't really much to update.  Joe's is still awesome.

If you're a vegan I think it safe to say you will find literally nothing here for you.  Everything is going to have at least some meat or dairy (cheese) in it, from the beans to the potatoes.  And there is no salad bar.

But if you're a carnivore, you have found El Dorado.

Read my previous reviews, they all still apply.  Pecan-smoked meats.  Very flavorful.  They have a sauce you can use but you really don't need it.  The meats are good without it.  The BBQ beans should be their own food group.  They are \"wow\", and should probably generate a bonus star here on Yelp, but we can't do 6 stars.  The other sides are good, too, and their lemon cake is excellent.  Even their homemade root beer is really good (yes, they make it themselves).

I have tried several other BBQ places in the city, and some were good.  But none are a match for Joe's Real BBQ.  Plus Joe's is locally owned, not a franchise."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Wait times are way too long. Get there early and prepare to wait.

They also no longer have Coca Cola products but this cane sugar Cola. It is fine but left me dissatisfied."}
{"text":"By far one of the best BBQ places I've been to. Had the BBQ sampler plate with a side of cheesy potatoes and it was awesome. Also their homemade root beer was some of the best I've had. Will go back if whenever I visit the area!"}
{"text":"Incredible food!! I recommend splitting the BBQ Sampler with a friend. We ordered an extra side of meat with it."}
{"text":"The Best BBQ in the East Valley, I've been here several times and ordered many different items and have never been disappointed. Food is wonderful and the people are great. I love the picnic atmosphere outside when the weather is nice. I normally get the sampler plate and it has been divine each and every time. A must when in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, fun to take friends from out of town, typical rustic decor.  Not as cool as some locals seem to think, but fun."}
{"text":"Joe's BBQ has been around for a long time.  If a restaurant has been around for a long time you know they have to be doing something right!  It is good home cooking BBQ.  I am a fan of the Jumbo Sandwich which is 2 meat sandwich.  I recommend the Chopped Brisket (which is amazing) and the pulled pork.  For a side the Mac n Cheese is the one to choose with a homemade soft fall apart cookie.  There used to be long lines but since downtown Gilbert has blown up with new places you have no worry about waiting to get a good meal.  If you are in the east valley and want BBQ check out Joe's.

{"text":"I would have taken a picture of my food, but it was so good i never took a break long enough to do it.  When their sign said \"homemade root beer + ice cream = best float ever\"; they wernt lying.  My only issue is i live in central phoenix; well worth the trip. Maybe i should move closer."}
{"text":"Down home cafeteria style good ol Texas bbq! The stuffed baker was very filling, chopped brisket was flavorful & moist. Be sure to save room for the blueberry bourbon cheesecake. It's both salty & sweet & completely worth it!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. First, I walked in, and I noticed how clean the location looked. I was impressed. You take your food  to the table, which I liked. To me, it is better than waiting on a  waitress, or waiter to come  take your order. You grab a tray, get a drink from their delicious soda fountain, or you can grab a bottled soda/water, then you  go thru a very fast moving line.   I was impressed with the courteous guy who was getting my order ready this afternoon. He gave me service with a smile! :) Fast forward to the food...beyond delicious!! I loved everything I tried. I was so tempted to order a dessert, and I was too full to try it this  time. They all looked delicious!!  The portions are large, and very filling.  This is a great location that is good to bring the entire family. I feel the prices are great,  and the customer service is even better. I  will be back soon."}
{"text":"Super endroit pour manger des ribs! Une sorte de cafet familiale sans prise de tête. On a payé 25$ pour 2 et on a mangé laaaaaargement assez de ribs sauce barbecue. A s'en lécher les doigts!"}
{"text":"The turkey is very good and tender, the BBQ sauce is good and the sides are good but for a BBQ place, the portion sizes are SO SMALL! When you go out for BBQ you expect to indulge but you will not get to do that here unless you order a double portion."}
{"text":"Stay away from the Brisket. Everyone here is nice, the service is good, and they generally have excellent food. STAY AWAY FROM THE BRISKET. The Brisket has a gaminess beyond beefy flavor. The Brisket absolutely tastes like manure. I love bbq but could not swallow the brisket."}
{"text":"The experience is fun, nice for kids to play outside by picnic tables.  The food just does not impress me at all.  It is edible and tastes okay but there is no wow factor at all.  I think we watch the food channel too much and I am hoping for a really amazing BBQ experience."}
{"text":"The mister and I eat out way to much and have been frequenting the same places recently.. China Chile and Joe's Real BBQ have both been visited 3x each over the past 3 weeks.. okay so we're not as imaginative as we could be. The thing is that we have turned our friends on to these places and every time they go well, we get invited. 

We just love Joe's.. it's a combination of elements, decor, pricing and comfort. This place is like that great pair of sneakers you have, a very good fit. 

I almost always order the same thing.. pecan smoked ribs, mac 'n cheese and share a loaded baked potato to share. The ribs are meaty and plentiful.. not like those anorexic bones they serve at some other places.. I'm a big eater and can never finish them in one sitting so a full slab can easily be shared. Mac and cheese there is really good even better then my home cooked version.. seems to me I have some practicing to do in that department. 

They also have this bbq ranch dressing for their salad that's a must try. Though who wants to eat a salad when there are some many good meats there to try. Their bbq sauce can be kind of sweet if you like that.. I'm a EOE (equal opportunity eater) and love all sorts of smoked meats and sauces but I know plenty of people who don't like that kind of sauce.

No table service here either, strictly cafeteria style. So be sure to have someone in your party squat a seat before ordering if you see a good table."}
{"text":"It's rare I give 2 stars to a place, so let's break it all down:

1. The meats did not seem fresh 
2. The place was not very clean
3. The service was OK but hectic
4. I GOT FOOD POISONING!

This place is crazy popular and for the life of me I do not understand why except maybe location?

I won't ever go back here again...

The meat tastes bad as in going bad... I was super hungry and ate it anyway. A couple hours later I lived in the bathroom for about 24 hours on and off and in bed the rest of the time...."}
{"text":"Loves me some BBQ! If you love it like I do ,Joe's a great choice. I'm putting it down on my top 15. Joes celebrating their 20th anniversary this year, and can understand why. The BBQ is top notch. There are all the favorites. I judge all BBQ places by the brisket. It was as tender as a baby's... if you get my  drift. Pork, chicken, brisket, ribs(yum),and sausage. A huge selection of sides. Try the brisket bbq baked beans. To die for. Friday night was really busy. We got there at 4:30 and got right in. By 5:00 yikes! Line out the door. Joe's I'd cafeteria style like a lot of BBQ places. The line moved very quickly. Large outside dining, and a band. \" Nobody goes there anymore, it to crowded\". Yogi Berra. Just kidding. Love this place. A Gilbert jewel."}
{"text":"We used Joe's to cater our wedding. The food was fantastic and a great price. We emailed and went in many times and each time, the manager we spoke to was always pleasant. I am so glad we had Joe's cater! We paid for an employee who actually helped serve at the buffet! Easily one of the best decisions we made"}
{"text":"Smack them lips!
Definitely worth a try for any BBQ lover. We had the sampler plate which allows you to try a variety of finger licking goodness (the pulled pork was sub par). The homemade root beer is excellent."}
{"text":"The BBQ here is pretty amazing. One of the best Arizona has to offer that's for sure. You'll be satisfied with anything that you order here. I only come here once or twice a year though, and only when they offer the sweet potato with cinnamon butter. They offer it during the first week of November I believe, and it's definitely worth it. The potato is HUGE and delicious. 

Service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"This is a great BBQ place to eat. It's one of those unique - reasonably priced places to take guests."}
{"text":"Really dig this place.  We didn't know exactly what to expect and love that this is kind of a throwback to the old school.  Grab a tray and a drink and work your way down the line for the best BBQ I've had in a long time.  The chopped brisket cooked in sauce was incredibly good and so were the baked beans.  The outdoor seating with a view of downtown Gilbert is a really nice touch as well.  We'll be back for sure!  Definitely worth a stop if you're checking out Gilbert."}
{"text":"It's excellent BBQ and has become my go-to bar-b-que joint in the Phoenix valley. The format is the same as any BBQ place in Texas, Oklahoma or Tennessee so that will be familiar to lovers of smoked brisket, pork or hot links. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Cafeteria style food service but some of the best BBQ ever! You might want to bring a bib."}
{"text":"I try to eat here when I am in town visiting my brother.  As others have said it's cafeteria style so you may have to wait in line but hopefully not for long.  This place is so good.  Their bbq is delicious, but what I found myself endlessly shoving in my mouth was the hot link sausage and the cheezy potatoes.  The inside has a nice country atmosphere with a big tractor inside.  I prefer outside at night with the strung up lights that give it, idk, just a real homey country type feel that makes the food taste even better.  Try it.  I wish we had bbq this good in San Diego.  Phils is ok in San Diego but Joe's is better hands down."}
{"text":"I go for the HOMEMADE root beer. I grew up on chili dogs and A & W root beer floats. These take me back to summertime in Illinois. Free refills on the root beer makes it a meal in itself. The husband loves the oversize baked potato with the salt rub eats the entire potato, stuffed with BBQ, cheese and sour cream. Our friends had a resort wedding and the best part was the rehearsal dinner at Joes!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! I like the hamburger! Great food, wonderful service! It offers reliably tasty, reasonably priced food. It's not the best barbecue I've ever had, but it's quite good. BBQ sauce is excellent."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and and socialize.  Nice outdoor area with cornhole and hula hoops. Reasonable prices and excellent food. Great for kids, too!"}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ place yet in the valley. The meats are smokey with a very nice bark and smoke ring. This place is sort of cafeteria style so be prepared. I prefer to order at the outside window and take it home.
Overall, really really good BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"Had the sampler platter with mac n cheese and cheesy potatoes.... the ribs by themselves are a solid 4.32 butttt everything else was average at best... just ur avg BBQ joint"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the Phoenix metro area. The home made red cream soda and home made root beer is amazing. All the meats are tasty. The home made BBQ sauce is great. My favorites are the pulled pork, potato salad, chocolate chip cookies. There are lots of seating and very family friendly. If you live in the PHX metro area and you havent been to Joe's, I dont know what you have been doing with your life."}
{"text":"Brisket is awesome 
Ribs can't be beat
Sides are lack luster 
But a great place overall."}
{"text":"Top notch.  By far best barbeque sandwich possibly ever.  LOTS OF MEAT. Just the right amount of sauce. You can  get half and half and try two different meats on a sandwich.   Definitely a carnivore or cave man diet HOT SPOT. I'm anxious to have the time to sort down and try the rest of their menu.  I'm sure I won't be disappointed if that MAGNIFICENT SANDWICH is the standard there.  I was pleased all around.  Great vibe.  Real casual and relaxed."}
{"text":"So much food! So much BBQ! My stomach can barely contain itself from the BBQ goodness. Such a great price for good food.

Got the meat plate with the beef brisket and pork ribs with a side of corn and cheesy potatoes. The BBQ sauce was nice and tangy and the meat just fell of the bone. Brisket was a little on the dry side, but that's not a problem when you can drench it in more sauce. Add a side of their pickled onions and it is just yummy yummy in my tummy.

The trick is to come when they are about to close. They want to get rid of whatever they have left so they will give you much bigger portions. This can be a drawback if you wanted a certain item because they might be sold out for the day. I really wanted to try their mac n cheese, but it's a risk I am willing to take for more MEAT!!!"}
{"text":"I love BBQ and this is NOT just your average BBQ by any stretch of the imagination. My personal favorite is the chopped brisket or the pulled pork. There's just not one thing on the menu that I don't just swoon over :)

Thanks Joe! Now of only I lived closer. Hmmmm..."}
{"text":"So this time we ordered in bulk for a backyard wedding rehearsal dinner.  we had ordered the brisket and pulled pork and cole slaw by the pound.  Unfortunately, while we were at the rehearsal, the dog tried ALL of the brisket (and amazingly left the rest untouched) so I can't tell you how it was.  But the rest was great as always!"}
{"text":"Totally love Joe's BBQ. I was there for lunch a couple of days ago and had the combination platter, it was the BOMB I think that this plate should be on everyone's bucket list. The Brisket was tender and moist, the ribs were great and the chicken and pulled pork were excellent. I'm getting hungry right now just thinking about it.

They have a great spicy BBQ sauce that I smother my Q' in. 

Great stuff!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday.  It's a cafeteria-style deal.  I got the 1/2 lb meat plate with 2 sides.  The brisket was fatty, the ribs were kinda dry, the baked beans were ok, the cole slaw was swimming in mayo and the corn bread was just a big question mark.  WTH was that bread?  Then, just to make things suck that much more, NO BEER available.  Cmon man, what kind of BBQ joint doesn't sell beer?  I'm from New England, we don't know too much about BBQ in general but this place had mediocre written all over it."}
{"text":"Joe's is the best option for BBQ in Arizona (valley) that I've had...  However it doesn't compare to a few of the best I've had in Texas BBQ or Kansas City stuff...  Sorry!  Joe's a cool dude and I appreciate what he does here locally and with his other places nearby but I do like coming here and will continue to do so.  It's locally owned and that's worth my biz.

Home made root beer is pretty good but not my fav.  Slaw is really good, kudos there, as is the mac-n-cheese w/ crusty top.  Beans are key and they're good here as well.

Brisket is above average and the BBQ sauce comes a little thin in my opinion but after you pick up your tray there's a spot where you can add as much as you want. Pulled pork is exceptional and more so what I lean to when coming here.  The chicken is good too.

Swing out and sit down.  If you've had The Salt Lick or similar in Texas you won't be blown away. But if you've never had good BBQ this will blow your socks off."}
{"text":"Sampler chicken very tender, the pulled pork really nice but the beef [is it brisket?] was a mystery meat.  The pork spare ribs were good but the cartilage was troublesome.  Potato salad and mac-n-cheese good. NIce rosemary toast.  Oink Oink.

Incredibly FAST service.

Lots of pretty girls here - eating.

No suds :("}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Sits in a wonderful location in downtown Gilbert. Staff is very friendly almost too friendly but I would recommend you check this place out."}
{"text":"We came across this place while on vacation and decided to try it out. We had a little bit of a wait in line to order at the counter. Luckily we weren't starving so it wasn't an issue. There were a lot of great BBQ options to choose from. I had the meat plate with mac and cheese, and did the chicken breast. It was really flavorful and a lot of food! My boyfriend had the meat sampler, which he really liked because he got a little bit of everything, with the cheesy potatoes side. We sat outside, which was a nice outdoor dining area and very enjoyable. We would definitely go back again. The service was fast and friendly despite waiting in a long line. The Manager or Owner (not sure which) even came around talking to everyone dining making sure everything tasted good and was super friendly."}
{"text":"The location and atmosphere are fun but the food is just mediocre to me. I'm not sure what all the buzz is about and why there is a line out the door almost constantly. Maybe I'm just ordering the wrong things but the food really doesn't seem to be something extra special that I couldn't make at home."}
{"text":"Being from Michigan and Arizona, I know my BBQ....what of really? Ok fine...I have never had good bbq....BUT

Joes does it right...quick, tasty and priced right. 

The pulled pork sandwich appeared to be lacking meat on the over sized bun but once into it it felt just fine!

The sauce was good and had a great flavor. 

The side of beans were killer with hunks of meat and veggies...YUMMY

The mac and cheese was the surprise standout for me. Usually it is just good but this was great. Nice crust on top and nice blend of cheeses. 

Go early for lunch and you can zip right through the lines."}
{"text":"Arrived at 5:45pm on a sat nite, and escaped the long line that started forming 15 min later. By 6:15, line was out the door and down the side street. Rustic, clean, friendly, and delicious food. Baked beans and applesauce (homemade) were our favs. Laid back Gilbert made us feel like we were back home in Nebraska. Ate our meal outdoors on picnic table. Very family friendly."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the state of AZ hands down. The ambiance of this place is very old town feel. Tractor set up rt in the middle o the restaurant. The food is delicious. I had the 3 meat combo with loaded baked potato and literally everything was perfect. A great place to take the family for some quality Q. A lot of seating with a huge outside seating as well. I will come to this place every time I am in Gilbert, AZ."}
{"text":"Cool ambience with a real small-town vibe. The brisket sandwich was fantastic and the Mac is worth the calories, but you know this place deserves your patronage because they have Boylan soda on tap."}
{"text":"We went to this place, from the opposite side of town because a good friend recommended it to us. The ribs were a little burnt and dry. The pork was good but nothing extraordinary. It might have been just a bad cooking day, but it's hard to justify the drive all the way there just to give them another chance."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in AZ! Always satisfied with their food and attentive service. However, it is very inconvenient that the soda fountain is in the line, so it's hard to get refills on drinks. Other than that, I am satisfied every time I go!"}
{"text":"I'm such a fan of this establishment.  As quirky as it is it is equally delicious.  The bbq Baker (a huge baked potato topped with meat, cheese and sauce) is a favorite of mine.  I like the pork and the beef brisket. Joe's is known for their sides.  I haven't tried them all.  People rave about their Mac and Cheese.  Their beans are amazing.  The root beer cake is so good!  The homemade root beer is minty and spicy.  Their chocolate chip cookies are the best ever."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Joe's years ago when I worked near Coolidge and, when getting burnt out, would need the occasional three-hour lunch. It was great then and is still a worthwhile stop when I make it out to the east valley. Going down the strip that is downtown Gilbert, it's funny to see our CenPhx favorites -- Joyride, Postinos, et al -- right there. It probably wouldn't translate as well, but I sure would love to see a Joe's in non-airport Phoenix. 

My personal recommendation is the stuffed baker. All the menu items are great (really just some various combination of the bbq items that highlight the menu) but I like the baker because, hey, there's nowhere else I dine that I order the baked potato entrees (seriously, check my lists -- you'll see no 'Best Baked Potatoes in Phoenix' here!).

Always a tip of the hat to Joe's service and atmosphere. Just a great restaurant and I highly recommend giving it, at least, one shot."}
{"text":"Really nice lunch atmosphere. Great place to bring kids since they have a grassy area for them to play in and picnic tables for everyone to sit at. The bbq meats are amazing however the sides are just ok. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be frequenting this lunch spot more often."}
{"text":"So, I have been to Joe's before, and Liberty Market and enjoy both. This experience I was quite un-impressed. I had never done \"to-go\" with Joe's. I called in the order after looking at the menu online. I tried to order a chicken sandwich. She said, OK, what cheese, so I told her to add pepper jack cheese. I asked to add avocado. Oh, we are out. Ok, that's fine. Does it come with a side? No. Can I add a side. Sure. I wanted to add garlic fries. We don't have that. OK, what do you have? Maybe I was confused about their to-go process?? She rattled off what I could get to-go so I add chips. When I got to the to-go counter outside, I didn't see any of the sides I originally wanted, so makes sense, I think the sides are different with the to-go. Well, the sandwich came and I saw the chips so I figured everything was fine. We were downtown Gilbert to listen to music so we took our food with us. When I sat down to eat, no cheese, and no napkins of any kind. Just the chicken with the bun, and chips. I thought for what I paid, there would be something other than that? Anyways, won't do to-go with Joe's anymore."}
{"text":"Good selection of meats and big potatoes.   Flavorful BBQ with onions and pickles you can freely add.   Meals for around $8-11.   Free b'day meal up to $10.   Thanks Joe,  you rock!   Homemade root beer and cakes.   Old fashioned candy you can buy.   Large back yard,  fenced in  area for kids to run around after.   Great family place."}
{"text":"Had to pick one star,  this place deserves a 0 star rating.  Easily the worst bbq I've ever had,  all the meat was dry and the chicken tasted like kerosene.  The dinner cost me 20 bucks. I'd rather buy a bullet and put it into my skull before I eat there again."}
{"text":"Awesome barbecue!  Better than anything in California!  Brisket and ribs are the best!  I'm not a bean person however the Bbq beans are also amazing.  If you're in the neighborhood and slightly like bbq you must eat here."}
{"text":"I know that my review might be rare. If you read most of the reviews, you will get great reviews.  I have been here twice with my wife and I still have come to the same conclusion. Here is what we had to eat:

My wife had the pulled pork sandwich and I had the Brisket sandwich. It comes on a homemade bun. The meat is pretty dry, not much liquid, and by that I mean wet sauce on the meat. The bun is so thick, that when you take that bite, it feels like you have so much bread, along with a gob of meat, its hard to chew. It just might be me, but I like a wet BBQ sandwich, I need moisture. That being said, you can get extra sauce, as much as you want, its help yourself. I had a ice-cream scoop of the \"Mac-n-cheese\" and the cheesy potatoes. The mac is good, but I like a creamy, cheesy  Mac n cheese. This is kind of dry as well. The cheesy potatoes are just cubes of potatoes with cheese, real plain. My wife had the cornbread, and also, very plain. The place it self is kind of cool, rustic, laid-back. My one complaint is, your beverages are \"Self-Serve\" but to get to the drinks, when its busy, the line to order your food blocks access to get your refills. I don't like to have to squeeze in and say excuse me to everyone waiting to order and they too are filling their drinks as well, so you can get dirty looks, like you are cutting the line. They have great home made root beer, me and my wife shared a tall root beer float, very nice. My guess is, if you understand my review, then this might not be a place for you, BUT, as you can see, MANY people are just fine with food like this, so..... Its all in your hands!!! I have to give this place a .........Doh!"}
{"text":"We're from TX and finding good BBQ when we moved to AZ was really challenging. This place is hands down the best we've found. My ONLY negative: no beer. Would love to enjoy a cold Shiner with some BBQ but it's not a deal breaker by any means. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The only decent BBQ joint in town. This is what I consider to be classic Gilbert eating. Its in the heart of \"downtown\" Gilbert (hahaha) and everyone has eaten here at least once. 

I took the boyfriend because he's a huge carnivore. This place has huge paintings on the walls and you can even spot real cowboys if you're lucky!! Its a great place to bring your kids. 

The buffet style eating can be a bit confusing, and you might feel rushed to order so you don't hold up the line. However, the ribs, pulled pork, homemade applesauce, gigantic yam, and homemade root beer we ate were all delicious. They give generous portions of the sides, a bit less generous on the meat. 

You MUST come here at least once if you're in town. (Unless you like alcohol and in that case be sure to drink somewhere else)"}
{"text":"Always good. The Mac & cheese is amazing. The baked beans are amazing. Not a fan of the root beer, it's very sweet like bubblegum.  Not a fan of the bread. But all the BBQ is bomb!"}
{"text":"I'll eat Joe's any day of the week. Great food selection, and everything tastes super fresh. Must see if you ever come to Arizona."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the world.  Have been a monthly visitor for 14 years and is my favorite and a gold
by which we measure all other BBQ."}
{"text":"THE BEST BBQ. I love this place and can't believe it only has 4 stars. I eat here every time I home. Best baked beans ever. And I love the ribs and pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"Friday night date night and we ended up here, since the smells and sound of BBQ were too good to pass up. The line was quite long but only took about 15-20 minutes to get through. The set up is cafeteria style where silverware, trays, plates and drinks are first and you order next. My boyfriend got the meat platter but unfortunately, they were out of chicken and ribs! So it was a double order of chopped brisket and pulled pork. I ordered the 2 meat platter with turkey breast and jalapeño sausage. Sides we got were mac and cheese, cheesy potato, coleslaw, and potato salad. A piece of garlic/Texas toast comes with the meal and corn bread is $2.50 extra. Total with drinks was under $30, not bad for all the food we got! BF got the homemade root beer, which he loved! It does have quite a root beer kick though, from what I was told (I don't like root beer). 

Seating is a plenty here, including outdoor seating. We picked a booth inside and started chowing away. The BBQ sauce was nice, it was tasty on the pulled pork and turkey. Surprisingly, my favorite meat was the jalapeno sausage, and I am NOT a fan of spicy things! It had just the right amount of spice and the sausage was unreal. Favorite side of the night (agreed unanimously) was the coleslaw! It was SO fresh, crunchy with a touch of sweetness. I swear I could eat an entire bowl of it. Mac and cheese was OK, cheesy potato was OK, potato salad was OK. The toast is nothing special, next time I will try the corn bread. 

Overall, we liked the food and would return. I probably won't go on a weekend again so we can actually try the food we want before they run out and avoid long lines. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times in the last 10 years.  Each time is as good as the last one.  The chicken, turkey and beef are excellent.  Not too salty, but tasty.  The sides (especially the cole slaw and potato salad) are simply delicious.

The root beer is brewed on the premises and is worth the trip alone."}
{"text":"It was my first time going here in all the years I have lived it AZ ( over 20 ) and I thought the food was AWESOME. Very tasty , I thought the portions were good and very reasonable priced. I really am impressed with this place and will go back again!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat! Fun atmosphere for the kids and consistently delicious food. Somewhat expensive, but not outrageous. I can't say enough good things about Joe's BBQ! My mouth is watering just thinking about this place! Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"27AUG16  a joyful day, indeed.  I had joined two friends for a birthday celebration earlier in the week and was quite satisfied with all the \"ingredients\" @ Joe's Real BBQ.  First, the whole city area is old, small town-ish and very tidy. The tractor at my table had a pristine green paint-job.
Since it was my BD I decided to go again for the terrific food and pleasing ambience, but also for the $10 birthday gift credit.  My name is Frugal Francisco and I'm delighted to go back to JR*BBQ and pay full freight.  Terrific food at a price to attract a tightwad like me. 

 Stay the course

PS I gather that there is connected ownership ~ Liberty Mkt where I got comp'd a super High CALorie decadent dessert.  I wish I could turn 72 again and again and A........."}
{"text":"Joes is a unique down town Gilbert establishment. Every time I go I get ribs and pit beans. Oh those pit beans, songs of love could be written about them. I truly love their ribs as they are meaty and flavorful. 

The last two times I've gone have been a real bummer. A friend got a pulled pork Sammy and it was dry and not flavorful. 
Yesterday my kids had their birthday and Joe's gives $10 in free food to celebrate. One kid got a chicken sandwich and the other the pulled pork. Sadly, both were very VERY dry. We went just after noon so it's not like it should suck but it did. 
Mr. Joe Johnston, please address this as I'm sure I'm not the only one noticing this and while I'll be back for ribs, I wouldn't count on others returning."}
{"text":"Good bbq! The meats are tender and delicious! They have two sauces, sweet and hot. You can get the sampler, which comes with a little bit of everything (ribs, chicken, pulled pork, turkey) and 2 sides. I often get the two meat plate, which is a half a pound of two meats and 2 sides. Their drinks are $2.59 and have refills. I like their sweet tea, lemonade, and orange cream soda. They have a variety of sides to include macaroni and cheese, potato salad, cheesy potatoes, corn, loaded baked potato, chili, salads, and beans. My favorite is the macaroni and cheese. we had to add salt and pepper to the beans, potato salad, cheesy potatoes, and corn because they were a bit bland, but after that \"help\" they were much better. The macaroni and cheese needed no assistance. On the weekends they get super crowded and the line can be out the door, but they move rather quickly. Also they have a pick up window outside where you can either call in an order and pick it up, or walk up to the window and wait."}
{"text":"To avoid having to read my overall review I condensed it into a simple poem for those who want to save time:

There is a barbecue by a man named Joe,
severely overrated this place simply blows.
Sandwiches served look ran over by tractors.
small portions presented adds to its bland factor.
A favorite of the elderly, \"Great BBQ!\" they said,
I can understand why though, their taste buds are dead.
Overpriced  and low quality there are other places to go,
Porkopolis I recommend their bbq is the show.


This barbecue is tremendously overrated.  I found myself doubting that the food wasn't mediocre because of the strong reception-- convinced I was experiencing the brunt of a disgruntled employee. I gave it another go. I found myself in front of a smashed sandwich that looks like your fat friend sat on it, covered carelessly by sub-par meat slop, complemented by two tiny sides that I meticulously ate with tweezers.  You get a free meal on your birthday though, the only time you get a bargain!

Although Joe's fails to deliver here, he does have a hit at the sister site Joe's Farm Grill.  Amazing place.  If you want good BBQ check out my review of Porkopolis.

Till next time."}
{"text":"Joe's BBQ is a great place to go if you have a large group.  I love the idea of skipping service and just ordering your meal and filling up your own drink.  Great beans, chopped brisket, and a topping bar.  Big fan of the giant baked potatoes they serve and the staff always has a great attitude.  They have good BBQ sauce, both mild and hot.  A fantastic onion relish, pickles and peppers round out the condiment bar.

My biggest complaint is the location of the drink station - it is a full blown salmon run to get your refill (minus the bears of course)!  That is because the drink machine is smack dab in the middle of a long line so you have to fight through a slew of people to get that refill.  Every time I visit I try to imagine a worse location for the drink station, defeated I leave having to concede they won with their current pick.  If you have small children I would advise sending them to get your refill, they will receive less dirty looks and can swiftly navigate between the sea of legs."}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ in Arizona! Everything is fresh and cooked perfectly. Being from the south we know good BBQ, and Joe's has been the best we've found in Arizona! When we have guest from out of town we always take them there for dinner."}
{"text":"Gone downhill.  No one came out the entire time we were there to clean tables and the birds were so obnoxious.  Had the tables been clean I'm sure it would have been a much better experience. I was with my 4 year old grandson and they never gave us barbecue sauce.  I couldn't leave the food to the birds to go back in so we never had the sauce.  Not even a person to flag down to ask.  This is the second time in a year I went and the tables were full of food and the drink cups were all over the ground.  There should be a rule that every fifteen minutes someone goes out to check.  It was a mess. Or, give people a place to put their garbage."}
{"text":"Great affordable BBQ! I had both the pulled pork and the beef brisket. The pulled pork was excellent, especially when you add the spicy BBQ sauce on top.  The beef brisket was a bit on the dry end but still tasty none the less. If you're a root beer fan, definitely try their home made root beer.  It a little bit taste like Barq's root beer, but has a tad more bite to it.  Great drink to wash down your throat."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! I love that if its your birthday they serve your plate on them! The chicken and brisket is always so moist!! Good stuff!!! those cheesy potatoes are
Amazing!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love Joes, I just was not that impressed. Food was not bad, but it was not that great. There are a lot of better options. 

Did not enjoy how difficult it was to get refills. You have to fish upstream a line of starving beast to get to the soda machines. 

Probably would not come back. 

Love all his other reteraunts though!"}
{"text":"Being from the South, I am familiar with many styles of BBQ, but rarely eat Southern BBQ outside of the southern states because it is difficult to locate great BBQ the way I like it. At Joe's I found BBQ heaven! I ordered the meat sampler which had brisket, ribs, pulled pork, and a chicken breast and wing. The brisket was fork tender, falling into pieces. The pulled pork was some of the best west of the Mississippi! I am saving the ribs and chicken to eat tomorrow. The pit beans were perfect in texture and taste with just the correct amount of meat and sweetness. Wow. The side salad with the home-made dressing was nice and light. I hate root beer and decided to try their home-made root beer. It was divine. Run and grab dinner at Joe's!"}
{"text":"pros: cheap, nice decor, pork had nice flavor, potato salad decent, good selection of drinks and desserts, outdoor seating 

cons: beef dry, chicken very dry, ribs small (St. Louis style), no bottles of sauce on table? strange, couple of the workers may need some training in customer service

i would give them 3.5 stars if I could. 4 stars just because the prices are good (compared to where I'm from)"}
{"text":"We come here every year for my birthday! I look forward to the food and atmosphere. The sauce is great on everything!"}
{"text":"We frequently attend the Hale Theater just around the corner, but this was out first time here after listening to others rave about the place. I had the two meat, two side plate and some coffee. To me there was nothing wrong with the food but nothing special. Not large portions.

I am not a fan of walk up and order joints and if I had realized that this was the case here I doubt if I would have visited. Luckily we arrived at 5:10 pm on a Tuesday night and the wait was only a half hour to order and pick up our meal. While we were eating I saw that by 6 pm the line was out the door and about a dozen or more were waiting outside. I'm guessing you were looking at close to an hour of standing to order if that was you at the end if the line. Seriously, it's just not worth waiting that long to get average food. Give me a sit down restaurant any day.

BUT, the prices are low so this MIGHT be a good reason to go with a large family. You can see from many other reviews that this is a very popular place though so I suggest if you have the TIME you might give it a try."}
{"text":"I love Cue' and really like the pulled pork and brisket platter.  I met the owner and liked his dedication to good BBQ.  It's great for lunch.  We were in and out in 45min and ready for a nap!  Comfort food and warm weather do that!  BBQ baked beans were my favorite side.  The tea didn't taste like the sweet tea I'm used to but it was good!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Joe's Real Barbecue is one of my family's favorite places. Great for groups, dates, kids, the grandparents, you name it. The atmosphere is strictly casual, with long picnic tables and plastic silverware. There is a big outdoor seating area we especially like, and if the kids finish before us they can run around in the grass without bothering anyone.

Go with the the pulled pork / sliced brisket combination with cole slaw and mac and cheese. Although everything I've tried here is good. The cheese bread is also especially tasty.

Oh, and how can I forget the lemon cake? Sweet and tangy, just like my Mom makes :)"}
{"text":"I am giving it a 3 because the atmosphere made up for the food. I enjoyed the small town feel and the way it showcased old west arizona.  I enjoyed the old country music playing.  
Now for the food. It was alright.  The reviews here made it sound better than it was. I enjoyed the mac and cheese and the cheesy potatoes. I also enjoyed the root beer a lot. The meat was so so. The chicken was dry but had a good flavor. The ribs were good. It was pretty mediocre but nothing better than any chain bbq place.  I live in the west valley and wouldn't be making a special trip over here for it but if I was back over here I might try it."}
{"text":"I visited twice.
Once for a birthday discount,
and once just because.

First time, food okay.
Chicken was fantastic, but
the brisket was dry.

I loved their sauces
as well as the side dishes.
Creamy mac and cheese.

Second time, food bad.
Got the sampler plate again.
Brisket was still dry.

And so was pulled pork.
Side dishes were consistent,
but meats were just dry.

Wish I could love this,
but quality of the meat
varies day to day.

Ten dollar discount
is a great time to sample
the meat offerings."}
{"text":"My fav BBQ place! You can't beat the loaded baked potatoes and pulled pork sandwiches. Also, root beer cake and gourmet bottled soda. I love taking the kids and big groups here since they have great outdoor seating and lots of big tables."}
{"text":"Joe's is about as pretty as a picnic basket in the grass! They have a wonderful pastoral outdoor seating area. The inside is redneck delux. Big Long Booths, soft lighting and a John Deer Tractor. 

I always get the Pulled Pork Sandwich or the pecan smoked turkey when I come here. They make really good Beans and the cheese potato thing they have is good as well.

They sell old-fashioned sodas in glass bottles, which I love. 

The dining room is HUGE and this place could easily accomodate a LARGE party

The food is served cafeteria style, but the quality of the food is way beyond."}
{"text":"Solid bbq. Solid service. Nice storefront. The food and atmosphere are excellent and the 25 cent coffee rocks!!  In Gilbert, it will be difficult to beat this BBQ.  And the unique soda's are a plus.  I like this place a lot."}
{"text":"All of Joes places are good. This is a great fast food barbecue Restaruant in Gilbert. It's not my first choice, but it is surely good! This is hands down better then Rudy's BBQ. The brisket is nice and I love the spicy sauce. Pro tip....come on your birthday and receive $10 off your meal. So worth it!"}
{"text":"The ribs are perfectly smoked and the sauce is sweet and spicy. The hot links are delicious as is the beef chopped brisket. The beans are the best and the Mac and cheese is very tasty. The homemade root beer is delightful."}
{"text":"the root beer is worth six stars, the food, worth four, the fact that they won't let me eat my lunch while sitting on the John Deere- one.  overall a nice four. let me sit on the tractor next time, and I'll bump it to five."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss with me...more often then not I think the meat is dry.  I do like their BBQ sauce and sides: red onion relish and pickles.  Most of their side dishes are pretty good...I go for the corn and potato casserole.  Me and my fiancé usually split a 3 choice sampler."}
{"text":"I love everything here...  the bbq beans, corn and corn bread are awesome!!  BBQ Pork is my favorite with the spicy bbq sauce."}
{"text":"I take it back.... 5 stars all the way!!! 

I love this place. I love the cafeteria feel, the amazing bbq you smell a block away from the parking lot. Everything!

I even had the yummy home-made rootbeer, even though I'm not a big fan of rootbeer in general."}
{"text":"qThere's a John Deere tractor in the middle of the restaurant, pretty cool. Food was good and BBQ sauce was unique. Great place for the family! Big menu and a Pick-up order window outside."}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place based on the good reviews.  The building is really cool, as well as the surrounding area.  Inside, on a Friday night, the place was packed.   The restaurant is cafeteria style and the line went from the back to the front of the restaurant.  Plenty of seating and a huge tractor inside.  We tried the homemade rootbeer, which seemed overly sweet.  I think I'll stick with Barq's.  I tried the brisket and the chicken breast.  Brisket was descent.  Chicken was terrible.  It had an odd flavor, not to my liking.  My husband  said the sausage wasn't good.  My son said his ribs weren't that good.  The beans were amazing and filled with lots of meat, so that had to be my favorite part.  Oddly, the bread and the cheesy potatoes both had jalapenos in them, so both of the kids wouldn't eat either one.  The best part for my 5 yr. old was the chocolate chip cookie that came with his meal.  Probably won't be back with the family.  I was actually disappointed that most of the actual BBQ didn't taste that great."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Joe's is the best BBQ that I tried in AZ.  I loved all their selections because they have something for everyone, from ribs to giant baked potatoes.

There is really not much I can say that the other reviewers have't said though so I'll just leave it with a 2 thumbs up! 

Oh, and I love the old tractor that's inside. haha  It's a classic... a 1948 A Series tractor.  Tad, the owner told me so! :)

See ya there!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ, although not a huge fan of the cafeteria style ordering. I have been twice, I got the brisket sandwich one time and ribs the next. Both were delicious. I added  bbq sauce to the ribs because I thought they needed it. Try the homemade root beer at least once, too. YUM. We got there just in time ( a bit before 6 on a Friday night)  as we were leaving the line was 3x as long...out the door and around the corner.  Oh FYI...for sides I got the beans (loved them) and my kids said the macaroni and cheese was good. Dad wasn't impressed with the coleslaw."}
{"text":"OMG, where is the 6th star for Joe's Real BBQ? :D

What can I say about Joe's? Found this place via Yelp when planning my trip to Gilbert and was expecting some good bbq as rated by fellow yelpers.  Needless to say, it did not disappoint!

I had the sampler plate: Ribs, chicken, pulled porks, brisket, + 2 sides (mac & cheese and coleslaw)  for $12.99!! and  fresh lemonade all for another $2.  The bbq sauce was delicious, and I especially liked the pulled pork (considering I'm not a big fan of pulled pork, this says a lot).  The ribs could be cooked a little longer, as I like my ribs to fall off the bones. But it was still delicious nonetheless.

For the quality and price, you can't beat this!  

+ $0.25 for coffee! 

Can it get any better?"}
{"text":"We've been going to Joe's for years and it's always been pretty consistently good... until the past two months. We started getting the family deal on the weekend for watching football and the first couple times it was great, but ever since the ribs are really dry. We keep trying, thinking this time it'll be good again, but today was probably our last visit to Joe's. Not only were the ribs dry again, but the beans were too sweet, the corn was sickeningly buttery, and my soda cup had a hole in the bottom. Total fail. I don't know if there's been changes or they just don't care anymore, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"We love Joe's Real BBQ. I love the Pork sandwich, Mac N Cheese, and Chocolate Chip cookie. I get that combo every single time because it's just so good! It all comes out to under $9. Plus if you go on your birthday you get $10 worth of food for free! Awesome place, fun environment much like a cafeteria. The line may be hard if you have lots of kids but I would just take their order and have an adult go sit down with the kids and then have them come back to get their food when ready."}
{"text":"Usually get joes Togo this was my first time eating in and it still was amazing. I recommend the chopped brisket! Dont let the long line scare you away it goes by fairly quick."}
{"text":"I have been taking my daughter here since she was little. The food is awesome and the backyard play area is great...!!!  YUM! !!!"}
{"text":"Damn. This is one of those best kept secret places only it's no secret! Just look at the lines after 5. We were lucky to cruise in just before about a hundo or so people came rushing in...almost like they came out of the bushes or something. WOW!

and for good reason I think this is the best BBQ west of the 
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I in fact it was sooooo good I went back again while in town for the Waste Management Phonix Open for the week. I would wrestle you down for those ribs and hop over the counter and serve myself that damn tasty pork and sausage.

The mac and cheese was prolly the best I've had, the BBQ beans just how I like it. I honestly think you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.

Service is amazingly fast. The lines dissappear almost as fast as they form.

The ONLY reason why this is a 4 is because of the lack of beer! Come on man, BBQ=BEER!!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ, I would only recommend the sliced brisket. Mac-n-cheese is nice a creamy. I wished they served some fried pickles. Maybe also add some jalapeno poppers. But overall a great place to eat. Ohh make sure you go there on your birthday, your meal is free."}
{"text":"The place its self is a real neat building. Love the huge mural on the inside, the old tractor and ample space. I like the simple farm decorations. The exterior has many picnic tables for large groups with pergolas. The line to order your food, maybe because it was my first time, was hard to find. After wondering around we found it. 

The service, well its ok. Kind and straight to the point. Its a cafeteria line.

I ordered the turkey jalapeno sausage, it was dry with no real character of flavor.  The hot and spicy sauce was not hot nor spicy. The pickle bar was pretty good and I enjoyed the water melon.

Price was ok. About $13 for a one meat dish with one side and drink."}
{"text":"Great brisket & chicken, bbq sauce was good, just had a little taste. Friends enjoyed the cheesy potatoes & apple crisp. Would recommend it to anyone. Also the outside dining would be great for the fall or winter"}
{"text":"Found this place on accident, and I think I just had a life changing experience. This is some of the best food I've ever had, in my life.

I had a pulled pork sandwich, Mac and cheese, cornbread with honey butter, and a few bites of my friend's sweet potato pie. Everything is absolutely heavenly.

Please, please do your self a favor and try this place out. It's worth whatever wait you may have standing in line."}
{"text":"When you don't want to drive all the way out to Joe's Farm Grill, Joe's Real BBQ is a good stand-in.  There is a large outdoor area where the kids can play while the adults eat.  Please don't climb the trees, kids!  They have a patio area where they host private events.  They were hosting a wedding reception while we were there.

Joe's BBQ is organized like a cafeteria style line, where you grab your tray and drinks first.  They have Boylan's soda and amazing homemade Root beer that pairs perfectly with smoky meat.  Someone dishes up your sides and they also tell the kitchen your meat order at that time.  Some of the sides are better than others.  The mac and cheese is missing moistness and cheesiness.  The cole slaw tastes great when slathered on a pulled pork sandwich, but it's awfully wet.  The beans consist of a variety of types of beans and some bits of BBQ beef.  

Don't skip dessert!  Your meal will end on a high note if you pick up a gooey chocolate cookie or blueberry cheesecake.  

All the meat is very moist and tender.  Although the meat has great flavor, their habanero sauce and classic sauce goes well on just about everything."}
{"text":"Anything I say here will have already been said but Joe's is the best BBQ in the east valley. 

The food is great, the place is clean, seating inside or outside, their Saturday Breakfast is awesome and I don't want to get in trouble for telling you what kind of experience your mouth will have with the home made root beer. 

Lets just say if your spouse makes you feel like this root beer make your mouth feel you are one lucky person."}
{"text":"Mmmmm mmmmm.  Love this BBQ.  The flavors are spot on.  Huge fan of pulled pork and brisket.  Both were great.  

Picked up and took home, so never been inside.  LOVE the outside pickup window.  

Definitely need to eat here!!"}
{"text":"Well, I can't say I'm impressed. The chicken was dry, the ribs are standard, and the pulled pork in bland. When you go to a place that swears they are \"real bbq\", they should be upload that standard. Its my second time here, and not much as changed. The plus side, the staff is pleasant and not over attentive."}
{"text":"Since my initial review, I've tried a handful of BBQ places in a handful of states, and my opinion on Joes has changed, unfortunately. While they have decent ribs, decent brisket, decent sides, nothing really stands out compared to the competition. I'll admit, if you're in the area and craving BBQ, this restaurant is worth stopping in and eating as it is quality barbecue. However, IF you NEED the best BBQ that money can buy, keep looking. 

FYI, I'm still looking for that place in Phoenix area, so if you know of it, let me know!! :-)"}
{"text":"Joe's barbecue is an icon in downtown Gilbert. Great place to bring the family for some good food. They have a nice outdoor sitting area with grass for the kids to play in. The waiting line to order your food is sometimes out the door which really stinks but it does go pretty quickly considering it's a buffet style set up. The only thing that ever holds you up is the indecisive patron. As a connoisseur of food, barbecue is one of those things you take to heart. Joe's ranks pretty high on my list of barbecue do's. My recommendation is the stuffed potato with your choice of meat on top. Ribs are usually pretty delectable. They also have a pretty nice root beer on tap."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bbq place! i highly recommend going there to eat ther ribs are so good so is there sweet corn! Oh did i forget, i love the style of there place its like a cafeteria but with great food and good service!"}
{"text":"For a great family dining experience, Joe's is the place to go.  Awesome homemade food including my favorites, cheesy potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and apple crisp.  Did I mention homemade root beer, red cream soda, and fresh lemonade?  The moist, and tender pulled pork sandwich is to die for.   Joe's offers a delicious, clean, fun, family friendly dining experience.  Plus, if it's your birthday, you get a free meal!"}
{"text":"I love the baked potato with pulled pork and every time I come here I drink like 3 glasses of their homemade root beer, it's amazing!! Food portions are big but that's okay because we always have enough for lunch the next day! Parking is the only thing that's not always good but it is downtown Gilbert after all."}
{"text":"Before I throw in my two cents, I feel like I should point out something that many of the reviewers here are overlooking: There are many different styles of barbeque, and it is not really appropriate to complain about one style because it's not like another. (To me, this is like going to a real Chicago pizzeria and complaining that the pizzas are \"thick.\") Some styles of BBQ involve thin, vinegary sauces; others involve meat that's swimming in a thick sauce; and still others (like Joe's) involve meat that's served \"dry\" with sauce added like a condiment.

In my opinion, this latter form of BBQ is the hardest to pull off. The reason is that the meat must be able to stand on its own. I think Joe's does this quite well. I usually get pulled pork or chicken. The meat is generally moist and smoky, but with a good crust (on chicken breasts, the outside edges may start to dry during smoking, but I actually enjoy that). I believe the meat is dry-rubbed before it is smoked, as it has a good spiced flavor to it. I usually place my order with \"no sauce\" so that I can get the spicy BBQ sauce that is available at the condiment bar.

The sides are homemade--my favorite is the baked beans, which is smoky and contains chunks of chicken and pork. The cornbread is of the variety that is not sweet, but it also is a bit too dry for my taste. 

If you go during a very busy time, you should be prepared to wait in line 15-20 minutes. But keep in mind it is cafeteria style, so you get your food right when you order. Sit-down restaurants would likely take 15-20 minutes to bring your food to the table anyway. Also, if it's crowded (and too hot to sit outside), it might be difficult to get a table, and the busboys might not be able to clear the tables as fast as people are leaving them, so scout out a table early. (That being said, if it is not crowded, Joe's is as fast as any fast food restaurant--you could be sitting down and eating within two minutes.)"}
{"text":"Went mid afternoon order a pulled pork sandwich, rack of ribs... wouldn't consider this place authentic by any means... I've had better frozen meals in my time. Also so called \"handmade\" root beer wasn't as good as I expected. Pulled pork sandwich bun was stale, and actual meat on sandwich was dry. Not worth the 20 or so bucks I wasted."}
{"text":"Great food, have tried it several times Ann's haven't been disappointed.  
Don't forget to order their homemade root beer"}
{"text":"We had a catered lunch from them. Chicken was great, bbq sauce was fantastic, pork was too sweet, beans were average, macaroni was average. I would eat here for the chicken and bbq sauce. That being said, I am a picky ass when it comes to bbq sauce and I enjoyed this places bbq sauce lol."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Pulled pork and hot link jumbo sandwich are my favorite. Ribs are my fiance's favorite. Always get the homemade rootbeer. Never had a problem with anything about Joes BBQ

Huge supporters of US Military in uniform.

Clean restraunt, friendly staff, and fair pricing on food.

Love how the owner goes around the restraunt, greets people and even assists on cleaning tables. Great leadership!"}
{"text":"I was in Gilbert for a soccer tournament and decided to try this place since it had over 900 reviews. I was excited to try a new BBQ place with so many positives. The building itself is a pretty cool looking establishment. I went around the side to order takeout at the curb. (They a have a takeout window so you can order from the sidewalk) I ordered the 2 meat plate ($12.99) with 2X brisket and added pulled pork for $4.99. Total was $19 and change. I was really hungry. I was PRAYING it was going to be good in order to justify this ridiculously high price point.

The meat: The brisket was very dry and flavorless. It had a very mild smoke flavor, unfortunately I had to drown it in the sauce to reconstitute it. The pulled pork was ok. It had a hint of smoke and it was at least moist, probably the best part of the meal. But that isn't saying much, I've turned out better pulled pork with a crock pot, liquid smoke and some Sweet Baby Rays. 

The sides: The \"cheesy potatoes,\" just a Luke warm congealed scoop of boiled, undercooked and overcooked, slightly mashed potatoes with no sign of  cheese anywhere. They were not salted or seasoned, and very bland. Had a few bites and didn't see the need to finish them. The \"Coleslaw.\" Basically, the slaw was 8oz of RTE bagged shredded \"slaw mix\" put in to a styrofoam container with no appreciable slaw sauce or seasonings. It had a very sour flavor, like vinegar and old cabbage. I tried a forkful, and it tasted like smelled, and that was it for me.

Very disappointed, I was looking forward to something there after a long day in the sun, but all it was, was just another overdone, overhyped and overpriced wannabe big city restaurant. Spend less on the rent and more on the quality of product. No sense in having a beautiful restaurant that serves very subpar food. Sorry to say, I will not return."}
{"text":"I like it.
Did a couple racks of thier bones for thanksgiving one year.  Who needs turkey? My brother and family lives in Gilbert, I try to visit them often.  Please don't tell him it's for the Q!"}
{"text":"Yum yum!!! The meat is tender, falls apart.  Get some extra BBQ sauce.  The corn bread and honey butter make a perfect pair.  The kids loved the Mac & cheese.  The atmosphere is open, cool and comfortable.  Great for the family. Service is EXCELLENT!!! So friendly and kind.  You have to eat here when you're in the area. They also sell the BBQ sauce ($4.30 each) to take home and share with others."}
{"text":"Always a treat to eat here. The cafeteria line is annoying in some aspects but it always ends up worthwhile. Love the ribs and root beer products. My wife loves the brisket and she's not much a meat eater.  When people come from out of town they always request to come here"}
{"text":"Joe's BBQ is theee BOMB! Me and my boyfriend has made this place our 1 and only go to BBQ place. I always order the jumbo stuffed baked potato and I add meat on top with extra hot & spicy BBQ sauce..yumm 

For sides I always get the potato salad and a side salad I really like their bbq ranch dressing...with a cup of lemonade 

I've tried the sampler(my bf always orders that), it's pretty good, but I'll stick with the baked potato lol fyi he loves the cheesy potato and I have to I really like them too

The staff is really nice and always smiling, it's always pretty crowded when I go there so that says alot! (Friendly crowd)

Not pricey at all!"}
{"text":"If you aren't concerned about eating healthy, and you want some tasty BBQ, this is definitely the place to go. However, do not expect anything on the menu to be Organic or GMO-free, or necessarily from animal-friendly farms. 

This was the response from Joe's Real BBQ to my email after asking if any of the items were Organic or GMO-free: 

\"Thanks for the inquiry.  After checking with our chef this morning, our chicken breast is natural, but other than that, we really don't have any specific items that would fit the definition of Organic or GMO free.

The Management Team BK
Joe's Real BBQ\"

On a side note: Any food labeled or proclaiming to be 'Natural' means nothing. Many people consider chemicals to be natural. That being said, this is not a healthy place to eat, if you care about your health. 

I'm not saying the food isn't good because it tastes great (I broke all of my rules and tried it) but I won't be going back simply because of my personal preferences."}
{"text":"I really was not impressed. The mac and cheese is bland, the coleslaw is watery, the watermelon was not ripe all the way, the jalepeno bread is a strange mix of flavore, and the ribs were fatty. The BBQ sauce is wonderful! The drinks are great, like they have cream soda and such, and the cornbread was dry but tasty. There are no booster seats around and the table is too high for my 2 year old, and it was $44 for my mom and I. I don't understand why this place has such good reviews. I prefer ribs from outback over this."}
{"text":"We love Joes.  The good is always good and they feed you for free on your birthday!  Its a regular go-to for our family."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.. The prices keep going up but it's still the same menu.  It's expensive to eat here for what u get. I ordered a jumbo sandwich with turkey and sliced brisket, coleslaw and Mac n cheese. The meats were dry and one whole slice of brisket was all fat. The Mac n cheese was dry. The slaw was good. My husband returned his fatty brisket and switched to ribs - which where overcooked - his cheesy potatoes had hair in it
This use to be a good value and good food. But after 15years - it's now boring - same old menu- and the staff is just mediocre.  I can make bbq for less than the $55 dollars we spent on 3 people."}
{"text":"What can I say, it was as good as everyone says it is!

I went on Sunday, trekked across the desert sands to beautiful old town Gilbert (never been!) And walked intothe most stinkin cute joint I've been to in awhile! Anyplace that has 25cent coffee and CANDY BUTTONS is going to earn high marks from me.

So why no 5 stars? Its minor stuff, and Joes is more of a 4 1/2 star place in my book. I ordered the chopped brisket sandwhich, after asking the girl in the paper hat if she preferred that or the pulled pork. It was amazing, though I was surprised to find I needed extra bbq sauce, since its cooked in the stuff. No matter, the sauce is free and delicious. Also ordered bbq beans- amazing- and mac & cheese -lost me a bit here. I wanted to love it, but felt it could use something extra and not just be standard mac & cheese. The crumbs were nice, but overall, this was just ok for me. Got a homemade rootbeer to wash it down- great touch. Next time, I'm going for the red cream! To finish (dear God, this was a lot of food lol) I had the apple crisp. Frowny face. Seriously, I 
was disappointed. For one, I much prefer red apples in a crisp, green tart apples seem wrong to me. Also, my crisp was missing its namesake and was more like slightly chewy. 

Total: $14.11... but did I mention the BOGO coupon for a weekend breakfast they threw in? I'm a sucker for savings!"}
{"text":"One of our favorites~ take out or eat in I love this place. The one and only place I've been to that compares is actually in southern Georgia! This is real bbq at it's best. The seating is kind of cafeteria style. The place is always busy and the food is always fresh!"}
{"text":"Food was great. The meat was well cooked and the sides were amazing. I'd suggest the beans and mac&cheese."}
{"text":"OVER priced BBQ... This place has horribly long lines due to their slow service. Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"We decided to try based on the good reviews. This place is way overrated, they must be writing their own reviews. I def won't be coming back. We came with a group of 5 (3 kids) and spent $75 for virtually nothing. The sides were all horrible. The chicken breast was descent, but not for the money. If you want real BBQ go to Lucille's or Charleston's or better yet Texas Roadhouse. I don't know how this place stays in business. What a rip off. Customer service was horrible!"}
{"text":"I've eaten BBQ all over the US. This is hands down the best!  Everything on their menu is delicious and their customer service is spectacular!  I've also served their food at several events. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Delicious food (that brisket doe..), cafeteria type set-up. Always a line when I come so you know it's good but the line moves very fast. Plenty of seating inside and out. I will make the trek to Gilbert for this stuff, wish there was one more central besides in the airport."}
{"text":"I was expecting really good bbq with how busy it was there. My husband and I ordered take out. The brisket was decent and the spicy bbq sauce was good, but the sides were lacking. The corn tasted like it was straight from a can without any taste and the Mac n cheese was extremely bland and dry. I couldn't force myself to eat more than a few bites, it just wasn't  worth the calories for me. The coke tasted odd. I probably would not visit again."}
{"text":"So many rave reviews. I like this place. It's pretty good and it's always consistent. Consistency is very difficult to manage for a barbecue restaurant in my opinion. Although I don't believe it is the best barbecue joint in town, it is the best I've had on the East side.

I always get the brisket and chicken. The turkey sausages aren't spicy enough for me, but their sides are pretty good. I like the .25 coffee, and you eat free on your birthday."}
{"text":"We accidentally made it to Joe's Real BBQ in Gilbert this weekend, while searching for something totally different for dinner.  Running out of time, we stopped at Joe's in Gilbert.  I like the atmosphere, big tables, lots of outdoor (covered) seating, indoor, as well, with a rustic look n feel.  I had the pulled pork and beef brisket, with sides of cheesy potatoes and corn.  The corn was good (mmm, buttery!) but the cheesy potatoes were mostly inedible.  I was told later that the beans were the way to go, though.  However, the meats was absolutely delicious!  The smoke ring on the brisket was perfect, the pork moist and tender!  I was in heaven!  I tried the hot BBQ sauce, and was not disappointed!  It was fiery!  Great place for families, very kid friendly.

If I have to go to Gilbert for lunch or dinner, I'll definitely go here, again."}
{"text":"There is a tractor sitting in the dining room and the whole place smell like mesquite BBQ

 Joe's is all about the rural town that Gilbert AZ was, not long ago.

 It's very casual, fun, kid-friendly cafeteria style dining.

  The ribs were REALLY good, and the side were awesome too. Homemade apple sauce, huge baked potatoes, fresh coleslaw, homemade lemonade,. yum!!!

The patio is spacious with lots of room to relax. Very cute place and you won't leave hungry!

{"text":"A fun place with yummy food in downtown Gilbert. This is a great family place. I would recommend it for any out of town guests you may have visiting you. It works for adults and for kids. There is outdoor seating. Oh yeah you want to know about the food. I usually get the pulled pork or salad. Yup salad, it's great with turkey! My husband always gets the brisket and loves it. You will see a lot of people with the loaded baked potato. For a good reason , it is delicious. Again I get the turkey on it. When I do get the potato, I also get a to go box. It is really big!"}
{"text":"I'm a massive BBQ snob.   I admit it.   I own several smokers, been doing it a long time and I know what good BBQ is.    Doing it en-masse, is a whole other ball game.   These guys make great food.

Easy 5 stars.   The ribs, the brisket, the sides --- all excellent!   I haven't had this good of restaurant BBQ for a long time.   I'm not sure if I just caught them on a good day or not, but I'll definitely be back to find out.    Come see for yourself.    

I love the  funky 40's motif too."}
{"text":"A good barbecue spot. The food is usually not fresh as it is served cafeteria style.  However, the food is good here and if you get it catered, it is actually fresh, so I would definitely recommend their catering service."}
{"text":"We went here after a friend raved about it! To me it was ok, but nothing out of the ordinary. Very boring menu and atmosphere. C+"}
{"text":"The best bbq we've had in a long time. Great location.  Friendly staff. Lots of tables and space for larger groups. The food is fantastic. Ribs and brisket melt in your mouth.  Homeade root beer yumm. Not too impressed with the cheddar potatoes but the beans were delicious.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great place to go for BBQ if you have lots of kids.  The food is good and they have an open grassy area (the grass is still trying to come on this last visit).  We had a good time and it was an easy place for multiple families to enjoy and informal meal."}
{"text":"I was very fond of my visit to Joe's Real BBQ. I had been to Joe's farm so I was eager to check this place out. I am not big on pork ribs but this food was delicious! Service was quick and with a friendly smile-always appreciated-but not always offered at other restaurant. 


Prices were competitive and atmosphere was enjoyable!"}
{"text":"We ate here with some friends a couple of weeks ago.  The food was ok.  I think what we enjoyed most is the outside seating.  It is set up like someone's back yard with middle school lunch tables on the grass and white picket fences.  We went in the evening and they have old fashioned Christmas lights hanging from trees that give it a nice ambiance.  In the summer I can see how it would be nice to sit outside.  They have homemade root beer which I thought was novel.  The menu is very basic as is with most BBQ places and the BBQ sauce was just ok.  I'd go back because it seems fun for a date."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing - never disappointed. If you want a refill on your drink it's embarrassing to go in front of people in line, but maybe they designed it that to discourage refills? I didn't see a sign for No Refills.... 

Great food and good service! The patio is refreshing to eat on. The bathrooms smell like their smokers for meat, my husband now wants our bathroom to smell like that... 

Thanks for a great meal and experience!"}
{"text":"Tried this place 3 times now wanting to like it but it's just not that good.  The meat is ok but the sides are terrible.  The locals love this place but I doubt any of them have had any of the big three: KC, Memphis, or S. Carolina BBQ, Joe's is not real BBQ.  We will NOT be back."}
{"text":"There were so many mixed reviews that we decided to try it out for ourselves. If you go on a Friday night plan on getting there before 5 (ha) otherwise you'll be waiting a while. We got there at 6 and finally got to the front at 6:45. We were in good company so we didn't mind waiting but other people in line were very irritated. I got the loaded baked potato with BBQ pork on top and it was delicious. If you're from the south it doesn't compare, we get it, but for Gilbert it's a pretty good BBQ spot."}
{"text":"Just moved to Gilbert this week from Southern California.  One of our 1st eating adventures was trying out Joe's Real BBQ.  Tonight was our 1st of many more trips to come.  Good customer service, Great food and very affordable!"}
{"text":"Being a Gilbert native, there is just not very many spots to go to get quality barbecue. Joe's Real BBQ is situated in the rapidly expanding part of downtown ripe with new and trendy restaurant options, but that has not always been the case. Just a few years ago, it stood as the \"king of the hill\" of a rather lackluster downtown area. Nowadays, the unassuming brick building of BBQ has amassed many food neighbors including Zinburger, Joyride, and Postino, yet Joe's still is the crowd favorite. I was there a couple days ago ordering food to go and the line to dine in completely wrapped around the corner! On a weekday!

There aren't too many options on the menu, which makes it very simple for newcomers of the joint. I got the BBQ sampler which contains 3/4 lbs of pure meaty goodness including ribs, chicken, pulled pork, and brisket. The ribs were sweet and well seasoned, the brisket was flavorful, but a little too tough for my taste, the pulled pork was deliciously standard, and the chicken was moist, tender, and all around the best part of the plate. I really enjoy that they do not heavily lean on barbecue sauce to make the entree taste great. 

One minor problem I have is that it can get pricey for the amount of food received. I could definitely eat more than their biggest option on the menu. 

Overall, it is a fantastic, no frills, family-oriented spot that does the job in a place scarce of real barbecue."}
{"text":"Honestly...I'm almost 50 yrs old..and this is by far one of the Best BBQ meals that Ive ever eaten!! I can now proclaim: I'VE FOUND MY GO-TO BBQ PLACE! Downtown Gilbert is such a peaceful, comfortable little town that makes you feel you're in a much snazzier area. This place was packed with a line out the door but it moved along at a good pace. I was expecting my sampler platter to be twice it's price. My Fiance' and I both had meals, drinks and desert for around $41.00.....The cookies were warm, the cheesecake made me pee myself a little I was so excited to eat it! The inside was roomy, there is covered and uncovered dining outside with a coffee house next door feat live music! 2 drawbacks....1) the drinks are smack dab in the middle of the long line...ppl wanting to get to the food (oh! its a cafeteria style meal dining) are constantly being stepped in front of by thirst mongers...ANNOYING..and a tight squeeze. 2) The long lines snake past some prime real estate for sitting...but who wants to see a thousand assess and sneezing kids constantly going by and rubbing against you knocking your bobby pins loose from your couiffe...couife...shit...hair do! Eat here!"}
{"text":"i love this place!

i always order the bbq sampler plate for $12.  i believe 2 ribs, chicken, pork, beef and a side dish come with the order.  it's great when compared to most bbq restaurants.  i like the meat and seasoning.  no complaints.

the parking and lines are usually a joke.  it seems like whenever i go to joe's there is a line to order.

give it a shot.  if you like it great.  if you don't then you can go to hell.  jk."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. Some of the sides aren't always hot, but overall it's a good option for some tasty bbq. The place is very clean and the staff efficient. We typically go here on our birthdays for a free birthday meal which is a nice offering."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE BBQ place in the state of Arizona!!! I order the pulled pork sandwich every single time with a side of homemade cheesy Mac and cheese with cheez-it crumbs sprinkled on top....it's to die for!!! OMG and for desert, their chocolate chip cookies are so warm and soft, it melts in your mouth....agh so good!!! The service is awesome too, everyone is very attentive and friendly! The food is served like a school cafeteria style, it's fun! I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for GOOD food!! Just be sure to get there a little bit earlier than \"dinner time\" or \"lunchtime\" cause it gets busy!!! The line will be all the way out the door sometimes!"}
{"text":"This is so good! We went to the coffee shop next to it, and my husband smell the BBQ, he said he wanted some for dinner. Ok. We went to the window ordered two meat plate and a side, plus a corn bread. I love the brisket. I bet the ribs are good too. Gonna go back."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! I can be a bit picky about meat, but I ended up loving this place! I had the meat platter, ordered beef brisket, beans, cheesy potatoes and a wonderfully gooey, and warm chocolate chip, which were all scrumptious. I also thought the cafeteria style method of getting your food was cute."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in Arizona. I spent time in Texas and got spoiled. This is the closest thing to Texas BBQ! So so good and reasonably priced. They even have a pick up window outside!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab some quick BBQ. I accidentally ordered a different plate than normal and they upgraded me free of charge. Very friendly staff and a nice environment."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh so good and enough to feed an army I'm visiting from California and this place was super impressive"}
{"text":"Great lunch treat! The grands had chicken and ham sandwich's and Ashley and I each had baked potatoes with the works and chopped brisket!  I may not eat a dinner tonight.  That was a lot of food for a lunch!  The brisket was very well done and the sauce is superb.  $$$"}
{"text":"I don't know why it's taken me so long to write a review for Joes! We've been coming here for years and have a great experience every time! We can always count on the food tasting the same and the staff being friendly. We like the brisket and pulled pork! The mac and cheese is yummy and the homemade root beer is our favorite. Family friendly with plenty of seating for large groups!"}
{"text":"This is an all time favorite for my daughter and I. Always a great meal. The pulled pork is to die for and I crave their apple crisp from time to time. Great family friendly environment in cute downtown Gilbert. Winning recipe!"}
{"text":"Overall okay experience.  I hate to say that I've had better bbq and I rate this restaurant as mediocre because it is not all that it's hyped up to be.  Then again, most of the undeserved stellar reviews, is probably due to those who don't have much to compare to in great bbq.
When I got there, I was first impressed with the smokers out back, and had high expectations.  Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed with the quality of the flavor of meat.  I tried the sampler, which indeed is a pretty good value, however, good smoked meat shouldn't be drenched in bbq sauce.  It's almost as though the soul purpose of the sauce was to keep the meat moist to mask the actual dryness of the pulled pork and ribs.    The beans were very good, and the potatoe salad was okay.

To be honest, I highly doubt I'll ever return."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure where all the rave reviews come from for Joe's BBQ... I've been two times with different people and no one would come back. The meat is ok... Sides horrendous. Arizona clearly doesn't know what good barbecue is, because if you compare this crap to Kansas City barbecue, it's pathetic. 

If cafeteria style, bland ass, if-I-had-to-imagine-what-prison-food-tasted-like-food seems appealing to you, try this joint."}
{"text":"I have to preface this with saying that I have a pretty extreme bias against Gilbert. Almost everything about this place and what it stands for annoys me. And, just so you know, Gilbert, everyone else in the Valley hates you. Yeah, even AJ.
This little homogenized, car-centric Mayberry-ish strip crammed onto Gilbert Road is often where I lead tourists if they're, for whatever reason, not interested in leaving the Southeast Valley and have no interest in Downtown Chandler (which I think is a great area). But it may be easy to miss this strip, because there will be at least four of Gilbert's finest waiting for you to tick up to 26, and that, in itself, may distract you.
But I had never actually stopped here. Finding the well-rated, independently-owned Joe's, open on a Sunday, was a good excuse to take the back way up from Tucson on my way to an airport pick-up and grab a brisket sandwich.
The brisket sandwich itself comes at just $6.99 and includes one small (not a size, but a descriptor) side item. They also have homemade cornbread and a few homemade desserts on the menu. Impressive. It's cafeteria style, so you wait with your little tray, while people in front of you act like they've never worked a soda fountain before, and order at the counter. That's a good little scam, because people are much less likely to get a refill if there's a crowd blocking them. And, at $1.99, I would expect a couple of free refills.
And that sort of set the tone for everything in that, aside from my sandwich, the other menu items seemed overpriced. The piece of cornbread that I ended up trying (I can't pass up homemade versions) ran me $2 and the deserts were like $3 for some pretty small servings.
I also should point out something I saw in another review, which mentioned the \"homemade\" root beer and red cream soda: the root beer is homemade (probably outsourced locally, but close enough), but the red cream soda is Barq's.
The sandwich was relatively small. Maybe three slices of brisket present on a hamburger bun, with just a little bit of sauce. And that was a good thing, because the sauce was far exceeded by the brisket, which itself was a little dry and oversmoked. The sauce tasted like a bottle of Kraft's BBQ sauce with ketchup added. Very little spice, way too tomatoey. At least, for my standards, but I know that everyone has their own opinions.
The cornbread was a mistake. Dry, flavorless, and it probably would have made my mema turn in her grave. It was hot and served with a slop of butter stuffed into a SOLO cup, but I didn't end up opening it. Maybe I'm crazy, but I always eat the first piece of cornbread with no butter, just to get an idea of the flavor.
The side was probably the best thing that I got out of the deal. The cheesy potatoes were a little overcooked (or had been sitting for too long), but they were a nice blend of cheese, cream and green chile (nice touch).
Atmosphere reminded me a bit of some of the places I used to go to in Texas, with the high ceilings, big tables and outdoor patio (another nice touch). And, maybe because of that, something just seemed too deliberate about this place.
If you like this place, feel free to continue coming here. But I'm going to keep searching for a decent BBQ place in this state."}
{"text":"I've come here a couple of times now as I have family close by. 
This place is pretty fantastic. 
The portions are huge, the meat is juicy and tender, the sauces are well balanced and the staff is friendly as can be. 

It gets a 4 from me, because this is probably the best bbq there is to be had in Arizona."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Went on a Saturday night and the line went all the way back to the front door, but it went by very quickly. Kind of a cafeteria-style set up. You grab a tray and your drink, then go through and order your food and get it immediately. Very efficient and you get to see how fresh everything is.
Prices are great--much better than other bbq places I've gone to.
I got the pulled pork sandwich with sweet corn and mac and cheese. Everything was flavorful and portions were fair. The spicy sauce wasn't that spicy at all, though."}
{"text":"Joe really cares about delivering great BBQ and a unique experience.  He succeeds at both.  Our favorite sides are the cheesy potatoes and the beans.  The pecan wood smoked meats are so good!"}
{"text":"You walk into Joe's Real BBQ, get into line and grab a tray. The menu is gigantic upon the wall and you can pick your main dish selection. On my last trip, I had the pulled pork sandwich. Then, as you slide your tray on the counter, you pick your sides (you get two with each \"meal\" selection). I had their mac n' cheese... nom... and the corn... also delicious. And, of course you pay for your meal - I don't remember what my bill came out to, but I know it wasn't outrageous. 

Then, you have your food and you can go sit down at a table. They have a large eating space with tables and booths and even outdoor seating. The atmosphere is very casual and a great place to eat some BBQ. 

If you're not in the mood to sit and dine at the restaurant, they have an outdoor window located on the South side of the building where you can place your order, wait a few minutes and get your food to go."}
{"text":"If you want pulled pork bbq, this is the place! Fabulous! You must try the homemade root beer!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place after trying it for the first time. It's a cafeteria-style BBQ place. Everything there is good. You can't go wrong. Beans. Root beer chocolate cake. Meats. Bread. All soooo good"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried the new breakfast menu this morning.  We both really enjoyed it, especially the Mother Lode Burrito with milk gravy and the Raspberry Bread Pudding.  I have to say they really know how to make milk gravy; most restaurants and even home cooks have no clue as to what good milk gravy is, so I was impressed.

One thing they are going to struggle with a bit is that scrambled eggs will never be excellent when they're served cafeteria style.  The same goes for potatoes.  That's the primary reason our breakfast was very good, but not exceptional.  I understand this isn't something they can really change, but thought it was worth sharing the observation as eggs are key to most breakfast dishes.   

Overall, the new breakfast is very tasty and well concieved.  We'll be back again in the near future I'm sure!

BTW, the 25 cent coffee is a nice throwback.  If you want a refill you just drop a quarter in the pink piggy bank on the honor system--pretty cool."}
{"text":"Good food, very expensive for what you get. They charge way too much for their sides. Been there a bunch of times the ribs are usually pretty good but once in a while they're not that great it's hit or miss but usually hit. I feel there could be a better barbecue place out there that I just haven't been to but as of now this is my favorite in Arizona."}
{"text":"Walking into this place reminded me of a couple BBQ joints I have visited in St Louis and KC. Unfortunately, the food didn't quite match the fun, laid back atmosphere.  Though a bit dry, I enjoyed the mild smoked flavor of the brisket...the bark was quite tasty.  The ribs also had a mild smoke flavor, but were not my favorite.  They required a bit of sauce to help fend off the dryness of one bone, while a couple others were too fatty to thoroughly enjoy.  

The portions were definitely plentiful and priced just what I would expect.  I didn't leave overly comfortable around the waist line.  :-)

Hopefully, it was just an off night as I have heard several people really enjoy this place.  We will likely be back to give it another shot once it is cooler out and we can hangout in the cool picnic area they have setup."}
{"text":"Go big or go home right!? I haven't had too much BBQ in Arizona but what I've had I haven't been too impressed. I will however say that JOE'S REAL BBQ was really good. I'm a fan of supporting local business, and there's a nice 'comfy/family' feel to the place. Now, I come from a big bbq'ing Texas family, and though I have to express this isn't no comparison it's pretty damn good Arizona BBQ. I had to try a little of everything so I got the BBQ Sampler plate 

Over 3/4 lb. of ribs, chicken, pork and beef, bread.  Includes homemade side dish. Add a 2nd side for just $1.00 [with a side of Mac N Cheese and Beans.] Yea I couldn't finish it all, especially with having a taste of my boyfriend corn bread and my friends rootbeer cake.. Can we say HEAVEN. 

For lack of better words I was in a food coma, but walked away happy and full."}
{"text":"I had read about this restaurant on Roadfood.com.  I told my brother about it and he loved it.  When I was down in Phoenix last week, this was the first stop from the airport.  We got there about 6:00 and the line wasn't too long.  (It was still inside the restaurant).  
As you wait in line, you get a chance to study the menu.  There really aren't that many items to choose from.  More surprising, when you get to the counter, there are the sides you had been reading about.  They don't really match the description on the menu.  
I ordered the sampler plate and knew I had made a mistake right away.  Way too much food for me.  Included ribs, brisket, chicken, and pulled pork.  I liked the pulled pork.  Choices of mild and spicy BBQ sauce are available on the side.  We had the mashed potatoes, sweet corn, mixed beans (my favorite) and cole slaw for our sides.  Although my order came with bread, we opted for a side of corn bread.  A real nice extra, the bread was slightly sweet with a nice consistency.  Worth the extra money.  
We ate outside on picnic benches.  Large lot with a few trees that the kids loved to climb.  Very nice family atmosphere.  Worth a trip."}
{"text":"Great BBQ restaurant!  They have choices of meats grilled and cooked to perfection (brisket, chicken, pork, ribs) accompanied by delicious sides such as mac & cheese (not the store bought flavor, but real mac & cheese), potato salad, corn, etc.  Everything tastes delicious.  Don't miss the homemade root beer and lemonade, and the dessert line (I highly recommend the root beer cake).  The prices are also very affordable.  I love this place! :)"}
{"text":"Overall the food is great and I don't have any complaints there. The layout and set up of the restaurant is confusing and feels chaotic during peak times for sure. Mainly because you get beverages first and you're trying to cram everything on a tray and it's all cafeteria style. The management seem really nice but the employees need to try harder to come across more friendly. I felt like trying to approach them for anything or ask questions was nerve wracking because they all seem so grumpy. Also if you need a refill or napkins you have to some how maneuver the crowded line and drink area. Other than that food and choices are great!"}
{"text":"Delicious, consistent, good service, it's  our go-to BBQ spot in the east valley.   We also buy bulk sauce to use at home when we smoke our own meat.  The outdoor area is great for families  with small children. Excellent all around."}
{"text":"My brother said they had the best BBQ so I had to try it.  The line was very long but I like that they had a take out window.  The ribs where very moist and flavorful.  The corn bread with whip butter was great.  I wish they had colored greens."}
{"text":"I ordered the BBQ sampler.  Chicken, pork, beef, and ribs!  yum!  

Then I washed it down with their red cream soda and root beer.  yum!

Me = SATISFIED!"}
{"text":"Always a good experience coming here. Been an occasional customer for years and have never had a bad experience. Good price, good food, good atmosphere/vibe. Earns 4 stars."}
{"text":"I love &  adore this place ! we have been here twice now , both times for lunch. The. BBQ is amazing ! The mac and cheese tastes like grandma used to make , the corn bread and butter are so sweet and flavorful you would swear you are eating cake. We tried the chicken breast sandwich, the pulled pork, and the brisket. My mom had the stuffed baked potato. I swear to you the potato was the size of the plate . We need to keep coming back until we have tasted everything on the menu ."}
{"text":"I can always count on joes BBQ to be consistent in taste, temperature, and price. I am never disappointed and I love that their staff all seems so happy to be at work. The cashier has been the same one since I first discovered this place about 8 years ago, which says a lot. I eat here and I use them to cater parties at my house a few times a year. Perfect for large groups with a varying demographic of picky eaters, kids, and even the hard to please complainers. Everyone always loves Joe's!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ. I am here for my birthday ribs. And I did not have to cook them myself. Every one should try joes"}
{"text":"Best in town. I don't eat meat but can say anyone who does with me loves it. The mac and cheese is to die for and the potatoes. We come here for birthdays mothers day fathers day a random tuesday. It's good anytime. We love this place I've been eatin here since I was in high school when it just opened. The cookies and the cheesecake oh my god! I can't even say. I don't treat myself often I watch what I eat but when it's my son's 13th bday I enjoy! We love this place and anyone I've taken or recommended has loved it also!"}
{"text":"What are the rules in barbecue joints that state you are required to confuse the f*ck out of paying customers every chance you get? Besides the fact that you seat yourself (sometimes), the menu (on the wall) has a long line that snakes up to it not for ordering off the wall but for picking and choosing your food like you're in a junior high cafeteria. And how dry is my meat required to be, really? There is a condiment bar but I didn't see too many condiments on it, and this is along the entrance line (full of people who are in your way). The whole thing is just awkward lugging your unevenly-weighted tray around the restaurant full of screaming mormon children."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant set up I've ever seen. Customers line up blocking soda refills and seated diners hovering over me as I'm trying to enjoy my dinner bumping our table. Very difficult to move around restaurant due to tables and chairs to close together. BBQ ok, but I've had better. If you must go, get it to \"Go \""}
{"text":"Meh. I like Liberty Market and the Grill...all by the same guy...but I don't get the hysteria about this place. The sauces are not ah-mazing. The meats all kind of blend together and are underwhelming. If I am in downtown Gilbert I would rather go to Liberty Markey, Postinos, or Romeo's Cafe. If I need BBQ that bad, I could go to Chilli's and get the dry-rub ribs."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since the 1990's and still can't find any better BBQ.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I can find in the valley.  
Kid friendly, with plenty of space for them to run-around and play outside."}
{"text":"Took the wifey for lunch. Place got busy right away.  Food is good and line moved fast."}
{"text":"The ribs were A-ok.  The beef Brisket was DELISH.
If I ever come back I will ONLY order their ribs since that was the only thing on the menu that was really stellar.

The sides were ALL pathetic.
I had the loaded baked potato and it was old/cold= not fresh at all. Very disappointing for the $4.50 price tag.  
The pulled pork was GROSS and dry."}
{"text":"I smelled Joe's when i was in Gilbert, so i decided to give it a try and I was very dissatisfied, the customer service was on point very friendly but the food was egregious, cafeteria style BBQ has never really won my heart anywhere, Even in the south you only make that mistake once. The only main problem i have with bulk rapid paced meats and sides is the lack of attention to detail that would otherwise be noticed by individual servings. IE serving me raw pork in my sandwich or the Mac and Cheese being cold enough to envy a refrigerator. All in all I'll skip the line next time and try one of the other options there."}
{"text":"Joes is my favorite BBQ in the valley. I have catered my sons bday party from JRB the last 2 years and all my guests have raved about how good the food is. Feel lucky to have a such a great place close by to home!"}
{"text":"Boom goes the dynamite!!!  Just tried this place for the first time.  Had the sliced brisket and the chicken with Mac and cheese and baked beans.  It was ALL GOOD.  The bark on the brisket was a 1/4\" thick and just screamed legit, the chicken was tender and smokey and the stuff that good old boys dreams are made of.  Being a fat guy who has spent some time in the south I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur when it comes to finer points of good BBQ and this place meets all the requirements.  The Mac and cheese was badass, and the baked beans would make anybody's southern grandma jealous.  They also had two different house made BBQ sauces which were both awesome and apparently make their own root beer which was pretty good (not a huge root beer fan but it was good) 

I'll be back to this place for sure!  While I was waiting I mentioned to some other people that I had never been there before and they all started blurting out things to try, in case your new to eating that's a good sign LOL.  If your on the fence about trying this place get off it and start eating already!"}
{"text":"I personally thought this was the best place In the area in 2014. I just went today and I got a jumbo pork sandwich. It didn't seem very fresh and the meat had tendons and veins, skin and other stuff most people wouldn't eat even if you paid them too. 
This place used to be super good but seems like quality is running out the door."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the decor and atmosphere at Joe's.  When you walk through those doors, you're transported to a whole new place and perhaps even a whole new time.  Great place to visit and take out of town guests.

Now, I wish that I could say that the food was just as good.  Joe's is one of those places where you have to know what to order if you want to enjoy your meal as much as you enjoy the atmosphere.  Definitely go with the brisket or the sliced chicken.  Both were pretty good.  The ribs were just ok...I wouldn't other them again.  And the pulled pork was horrible.  As for sides, go with the mac and cheese (delicious) and the beans (not bad). Stay away from the coleslaw.  Oh, and give their root beer a try.  It was pretty good as well.

So, overall, the experience was pretty good and I'd go back now that I know what to order and what to stay away from."}
{"text":"Joes is always a great place to grab a bite. Love the spicy bbq I always get the sample plate. Love the brisket and chicken yum! Hands down some of the best root beer I've ever had. I would love to buy a gallon of it. 

 Service is always great. Friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Living in Gilbert, places like Joe's Real BBQ are few and far between.  Somehow, that seems to make them all the sweeter and really makes me appreciate it for what it is...a family owned, one of a kind, original BBQ joint in the middle of a suburban (semi) wasteland.  

The BBQ, although not the best I have ever had, is great.  The pulled pork is really tasty and the hot BBQ sauce is awesome.  You also can't miss the crusted mac and cheese or the homemade root beer.

If you find yourself in downtown Gilbert, don't hesitate to stop in at Joe's.  You wont be disappointed.  Grab a 'Meat Plate', sit outside under the trees at a picnic table and be thankful that you can enjoy an American staple in such a cool, little place."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Some of the best BBQ in the valley!  The sides are phenomenal as well and different from most traditional BBQ places that only have beans and potato salad.  Will definitely be enjoying this place in the future!"}
{"text":"The food is quick and quality and the prices are fair.  There's better BBQ in the valley, IMO, and the setup here always bothers me.  You move through the cafeteria line and if you forget anything, like a glass of water, you're back in the potentially long line again.  Regarding the meats, I wish the brisket was more moist.  I think they use all of the fatty brisket for the chopped brisket selection.  The pork is very good and I especially like the sausages.  The side dish selection is excellent.  Good for Gilbert but I wouldn't go out of my way like I do for the Farm Grill."}
{"text":"I was honestly having a hard time deciding if i should give them 4 or 5 stars. I am going to swing the 5 stars because leftovers were equally as good the day after.

This place is cafeteria style restaurant. Which is good, you see your food being prepared before your very eyes. The ribs were DELICIOUS!! the meat fell off the bone cleanly. I am salivating a little bit thinking about them again. They do a real good job cooking the ribs. They don't over smother the ribs with sauce which is nice. You can add more on your own. A great smoky flavor in each bite.  Mac N cheese side was good. I wish that the crunchies on top were more crunchy, but thats my own personal preference. 

My wife had the salad, with chicken ontop. That was pretty good too. IF we didn't get meat on the salad it would have been a sad day. 

I'd love to come back sometime, its just a little far from me. :("}
{"text":"They have some seriously great BBQ.  Have eaten at the restaurant and ordered their catering for parties which is always a help.  The outdoor eating area is a neat place and like how family friendly it is."}
{"text":"Decided to try out Joe's Real BBQ - as a celebration for passing my final dental boards - the last step before being Dr. D!

I was not disappointed! I had two meats and 1 side....I live for Mac and Cheese and boy oh boy was it tasty! For the meats I had brisket (sliced) and hot link. The hot link has such good snap (you know what i mean) and the brisket was just the right amount of smokey taste

My husband had the BBQ brisket sandwich with a side of baked beans and side of cheesy potatoes. The baked beans were really really good! I feel like the only thing that was mediocre was the cheesy potatoes

We tried the Root Beer float cake - decent

We just moved to Gilbert and will definitely be back - and considering having them cater for my graduation party :)"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ around in Arizona! I'm from Texas and tried a lot of places and was very disappointed UNTIL I came here!! It felt like I was at home again veryyyy delicious BBQ.i had the BBQ chicken and ribs with potato salad & cheesy potatoes.Very good prices and nice friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I met my girlfriends there last week for lunch, I had the baked potatoe with everything. Was not disappoint. They are hugh and tasty. If you have not been,try it. Very casual. Cafeteria style. Choice of in or outside dining. 
Also try Bergies coffee next door north. Owned by some good people. If you love coffee, these folks know their stuff"}
{"text":"This place is great for families and kids.  You can sit outside on the benches and it provides a fun and casual atmosphere.  The bbq is pretty good.  We go two BBQ platters and four sides and split among 3 people and the portions were perfect.  I would definitely come back.  The meat off the rib literally slides off and the meat is yummy.  We asked for no bones in the chicken and it was good, not too dry.  I appreciated how they didn't slather on the BBQ sauce too much.  The homemade root beer and lemonade are pretty good.  The mac and cheese is better than the cheesy potatoes.  The blueberry cheesecake was good too."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good. I had the 2 item Meat Platter with ribs and brisket, cheesy potatoes, Mac & cheese, cornbread and, of course, the homemade root beer.  Over all a good time. A kind of high school cafeteria atmosphere, buffet style service was ok. Could of maybe used a little more spice on everything. Overall a good experience. Probably won't go back though. It's too far from home. Rock!"}
{"text":"Birthday Bash at Joe's was a success again!  As usual the food was 5 STARS !  Everyone had more than enough food and fun. 

Thank you to all the staff at Joe's.  You are Simply the Best ! !"}
{"text":"This place is Excellent . The Pork ribs were amazing.The homemade bread was also excellent.

Great staff, super clean, great selections.... try the homemade soda as well.

I'd recommend this place to everyone from family dinner to going out with friends. The outdoor patio is perfect as well."}
{"text":"This place does BBQ right. Came here for my birthday and got $10 off my order. I got a full sandwich half brisket half pulled pork with a side of coleslaw and fries. The sandwich was so good the meat was hot and juicy and covered in barbecue sauce which I got extra of. I was so full afterwards this is definitely a spot I'm going to visit again over and over. Next time getting the ribs."}
{"text":"we have been going to Joe's Real BBQ for many years.Now that I can't eat a lot of
food,as a senior and medical issues I asked for the Kids portion and was told I had to be under 12 and the girl refused to give me the Kids portion.This is very bad for Bussiness.
there were 6 other people with us so it was not like I just walked in alone..
There are to many other Restaurants here in Gilbert to go to and will accommodate
you..and more coming in...."}
{"text":"My mind has been changed about this place, upgrading my last reviews.  I guess 3rd time is the charm, but the pulled pork \"jumbo\" sandwich and sides were amazing this time around.  I had the mac and cheese (love the crust) and the potatoes were perfect.  Everyone else in the group loved what they got too and had no complaints.  It is pricey for having to serve yourself, but I guess I don't mind as much when its this damn good!"}
{"text":"I do have to say the BBQ is great, love the sauces, great kick. the cheesy potato's are really good. Now the lemon cake I have to say is the best I have ever had. Love the inside decor and being able to go outside and eat is a plus. Great job to the staff of Joe's"}
{"text":"Average is all I can say. What was so special? My husband and I have been fans of the owners other establishments and with witnessing the line to this place finally decided to wait an hour to taste the food. Really is nothing amazing, it was like I said just average."}
{"text":"I was very unimpressed when I visited Joe's Real BBQ, the brisket was dry and tasteless and the root beer was bland. I complained to the manager (whom I believe was named Rose) and was met with awkward customer service and no resolution to my dilemma! Will not be recommending this place to any of my friends nor will I be back!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of BBQ and i really like this place. Great atmosphere. The strong point for this place is the sides. They are really well done. Got the ribs and brisket. Ribs were great; the only complaint is the brisket was a little tough, but not bad. It did have a nice smoke ring as well. I would eat here again. The service was fast and good as well."}
{"text":"I had passed Joe's a couple of times back in college but never really had the urge to come as it was so far away from where I lived and downtown Gilbert was not as poppin as it is today. Since moving to Chandler, I had been itching to try their fresh BBQ food and decided to come with family who were in town for a visit.

The funny thing about this place that I can't get over is the insane line on the inside of the restaurant and the wait times people put up with to order from inside. Seriously people, there's an express to-go section outside that has little to no line and you get your food soooo much faster! Still want to eat there and not take it to go? That's fine, they have no problem with you staying to enjoy your meal! The only difference is paper bag/wrap vs. being on a plate, which I could care less about. If the food is good, that's all that matters.

I ordered the jumbo sandwich which included chopped brisket/pulled pork and a side of potato salad. I have been to other BBQ establishments in CA and AZ but nobody does it quite like these guys. The meat is juicy and easy to eat--not too chewy but also not hard & dry. Their fresh homemade root beer and lemonade are also super delicious!

If you're into BBQ and are in the near vicinity of downtown Gilbert, get on down to Joe's Real BBQ!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have had by far and the homemade root beer is amazing. I'll definitely be coming back. Friendly staff also. Relaxing atmosphere and old style feel. Awesome overall experience. If you happen to be in Gilbert Arizona definitely don't forget to stop by this place."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The best Mac and Cheese. Cafeteria style good service. Very friendly staff. Say hi to Donald, he's there to help you decided. Don't forget to try the homemade root beer, some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"All too often people who own restaurants focus on the main entree or \" center of the plate\" and give little attention to the side dishes which are usually okay but an afterthought. 
This is not the case here. Even the slice of bread given is a rye/pepper? Bread that looks as though it is made especially for this business. Not the usual roll or store bought Texas toast. They also have cornbread but I didn't have it. The baked beans? Several different types of beans, meat and sauce. Delicious. Potato salad with seasoning which raises an eyebrow because it taste good but the average person won't be able to guess how it's made. The flavor unique to this business. I've also had the mac and cheese which was great. 
The HOMEMADE ROOT BEER is the best I've ever had anywhere. Even better than Virgils Root Beer. I don't drink any soda other than root beer, birch beer or sarsaparilla and I've tried practically every brand made everywhere I've travelled. I'm 60 now and maybe my memory is bad but it is reminiscent of the OLD A&W Root Beer Stands of the 1960's. Before the advent of high fructose corn syrup in beverages. 
Omg I almost forgot the entrees. After all this; do I have to go on?  The sauce is good. The entrees supported by the sides. It's just BBQ? Ha!!! Moist and delicious. I've had the ribs, bone in chicken, pulled pork which were all good. 
So why 4 and not 5 STARS? Bc it's still just BBQ but well managed, well prepared and well served. I'm glad it's in my neighborhood. 

Ok... I raved.... now a little rant.... On my last visit I noticed that the bags and kitchen crew were wearing.....FOR THE FIRST TIME IVE SEEN..... Joe's Farm Grill and not Joe's Real BBQ..... I totally dislike Joe's Farm Grille quality and service. SO.... if this is indicative of a change or if they've consolidated I'm deducting stars. First... the bread I raved about and the attention to detail? I got a generic white roll. My chicken was so dry I couldn't eat it. Threw it out. My sides were cold.  I will not return. Either there was a change in ownership, management, philosophy or whatever..... the fact that I now associate this horrible experience with a place I totally dislike means I won't give them another chance. It was that bad. My guess.... a change in management to maximize profitability at the cost of quality. Big mistake. If it ain't broke..... I know owners and chefs with big egos who think they can do something better. Sad.... read my review that is like falling off the cliff."}
{"text":"Wow, very disappointed. Ordered the sampler plate like I always do and when I got home and opened it up, like half the Briscuit and half the pulled pork I usually get. To me I would rather pay more for the same amount. Very sad. $14.00"}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent, excellent. Joe's BBQ gets it right. The menu options are classic- smoked brisket, chicken breast, pulled pork, ham, sausage, and turkey. The sides include mac n' cheese, baked beans, potato salad, cheesy potatoes, and fries. You can select from sandwiches or plates with your choice of 1 or 2 meats. Trust me, the food is delicious. Folks come from all over the valley to eat at Joe's. There are 2 types of BBQ sauce: regular (sweeter) and spicy. Both are delicious, it's worth trying them. There's also a relish stand to grab whatever you'd like to compliment your food.

The setup is what you'd expect from a BBQ restaurant- open seating (indoors and out, with a pretty nice setup for outdoor dining when the weather cools down), cafeteria-style ordering, and a country feel to the establishment. Expect to wait during the busier times (weekends, lunches, holidays) as this place can get pretty popular. If you don't want to wait, there's a take-out order window on the side of the building- call ahead to place your order and swing by to pay for and pick-up your food. It's a very customer friendly service.

The service is good, not great. The restaurant is clean every time I've been there- plenty of booths or tables to choose from inside. Joe is a pretty established restauranteur in the Gilbert area (Farm Grill, Liberty Market Cafe, etc.) so he knows what patrons like and seems to attract good crowds. Joe's is no exception- it's great for families and kids. The food is very, very well done- but a bit pricey- be prepared to pay at least $10-12 per adult but the portions are pretty big."}
{"text":"This place is consistently good and very well priced. They have a room outside if you have a large crowd so if you wanted to meet for dinner with your  group, friends it accommodates about 50. Delicious barbecue and the sides are outstanding. Been here lots of times. Thanks Joe you lead the way."}
{"text":"Great BBQ joint

Some of the best barbecue I've ever had and great ambiance. Plenty to choose from and a great staff"}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich with a side of potato salad. This is the meal I feel that BBQ places just can't screw up, which makes it my go-to order whenever I see it offered. If Joe's had onion rings, I would have gotten those too. 

Their pulled pork sandwich was pretty good. I liked the BBQ sauce too. I wasn't big on the potato salad. It had a thin sauce, rather than the thicker, mayo-like kinds I'm used to. I think someone mentioned it's like a thousand island dressing trying to hold potatoes together and that sounds about right. Not impressed.

My friend had ordered a side of the cornbread, but couldn't finish it, so I thought I'd polish that off... that is one very dense, dry square of bread. No wonder she couldn't eat it all! I've had an endless pit of a stomach during this pregnancy and I couldn't finish what she had leftover. 

Despite what I'd heard, I wouldn't say Joe's is amazing. And I certainly wouldn't drive all the way out there specifically for their BBQ. I think I'd rather continue on my search for the perfect pulled pork, potato salad, and onion rings."}
{"text":"Got takeout and ordered the ribs/brisket combo.  The ribs were small and the quality was not so good.  Perhaps it was reheated but the meat at the ends were tough and stringy almost like chewing cardboard.  Brisket was uneventful and slightly dry. Mac n Cheese was pasty thick.  
The inside of this place looked fun and maybe I would have had a better experience eating in but don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Disappointed! Stopped in for dinner and ordered Mac n cheese we were told 5 minutes. After 3 trips to the counter and was told 5 more minutes each time and still nothing I finally asked if it could be delivered to our table the girl said no because they didn't know who ordered and such so I needed to check back. After 25 minutes we were done with our meal I went up to find it finally was brought out. I just requested my money back. Joe really needs to get his act together. His staff really does not know how to deal with people.  We have been coming for years. We stopped going out to the grill which was another one of our favorites after having  bad service a few times. It may be time to cross Joes BBQ off our list too. What happened to customer service or go the extra mile for the customer. Ever here the story give them the pickle by Bob Farrell? It may be time to have your employees google it !"}
{"text":"I really don't understand the hype about this place . I would guess that the people that eat here cant bbq at home and find this place good."}
{"text":"Yummy!!  Pecan wood permeates the establishment.

Rack of Ribs:  Pork spare ribs, cooked so long that the bones were pliable, meat seperated from bone instantly.  Joes BBQ sauce is very very good and I love the habanero BBQ myself

Pulled Pork Sandwich:  very good and same super tender meat with same super BBQ sauce...bun was okay

Side Mac n Cheese and Pit Beans - both awesome

The best part was the homemade root-beer.  I can't put in words how tastey craft root-beer is.  This tasted down home and not like coke with rootbeer syrup.  I wish they would stock Birch-Beer in place of the red creme soda.  Birch Beer I think is much more tastey than rootbeer but all in all Joes is A++ 

To have Joe's in your neighborhood is great, good country BBQ"}
{"text":"Very impressed! I was visiting from Texas and stopped at Joe's while in route to Phoenix. Being from Texas, I have had my fair share of great barbecue, and Joes is definitely in my top 5. Sides were also great. I especially enjoyed the Mac n cheese. Not sure when I will be in Gilbert,Arizona again, but if the opportunity arises, I know what my first stop will be."}
{"text":"Good food first time here and we loved it. We were not going to come here but I went in to restaurant across the way and did not like the atmosphere. So we came here and I'm so glad we did. The jumbo bake with pulled pork was so amazing. All the food was good"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.. the staff is friendly, food is delicious and it's kept clean. There's always a line but it moves fast. We highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I should have done this earlier but I am bumping it up to a 3 star because Joe offered to make it right if I gave the place another shot.  A businessman that cares about customers is worthy of +1 star.  

Unfortunately for Joe's BBQ, my new favorite downtown Gilbert spot is across the street.  But, it's another Joe Johnston establishment, Liberty Market.  If I can pry myself away from Liberty Market on my treks from Tempe to Gilbert I'll give the BBQ another shot."}
{"text":"Pretty sure this is my favorite BBQ restaurant on the planet.  Love the food!  Great atmosphere.  Lines do get long sometimes but hey can you complain that other people want great food as well?
My niece just did the luncheon for her wedding at Joe's.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"It is a cafeteria style place and the food is amazing.  The sweet tea on tap is not sweet! haha But they have old school soda bottles that are so good. I had the ginger ale. I had the pull pork, mac and cheese apple sauce.  Everything was soo amazing.  Def recommend getting the apple sauce as a dessert it is so good!"}
{"text":"Overall we love Joe's.  This is the first time for doing birthday meals for my husband and son, who share the same birthday, so they each got $10 to spend.  What I didn't know (because I didn't know to ask) was that I thought we were using it on a full slab or ribs, which was $18 and an extra side, another $1.29, which would have been close to $20.  We bought 2 additional sides at $2.49 each and I thought we would be paying a little over $4 in the end.  We didn't.  I paid almost $10.

Since we were going to Liberty Market to get dessert, I paid the $9.xx and then said we'd come back to get the food, since there was a line and I didn't want to hold it up.

When we came back to pick up our food, I asked the Take Out cashier why it was $9.xx as I expected it to be less.  She said they only take the $10 off per entree or meal and you can't combine.

I wish I would have known that and she would have told me.  It was apparent that I didn't know.  So what they did was take the $10 off the $18, so then I paid the $9.xx difference.  Then, the other sides, went on a different order, which was around $6.  So, nothing to pay there.  We wanted the full $10 off so we got some extra meat and it was really hardly anything.  I guess 1/4 lb is really almost nothing in terms of a brisket, which was $4.79.  From there, I paid another $1.14.

Not that I minded paying the $11 extra we had to pay, but when I pay for something, I want to know that that is what I'm paying for.  She had to get the manager's approval on adding the meat to the 2nd order.  

I just wish the cashier would have explained it to me initially so I could have ordered differently.  She did ask me after she told me, which was when I came back to pick up the order if I wanted to delete the order and start over.  When I went up to the window a 2nd time, I was the only one and I was there what seemed like awhile and now the big line was forming again for the take out.  So, I felt a little embarrassed I was taking so long, so I said that I would keep my order.

The only 2 reasons why I rated this 4 instead of 5 were they didn't tell you upfront that the $10 needs to be on separate orders/meals.   I'll do that next time.  And the manager didn't seem so friendly.  The cashier was fine, but I didn't get her name.

Thanks Joe's for the free $20 worth of food."}
{"text":"This place was okay. For the price I would expect a little more flavor. I hated the root beer. The cornbread was my favorite part. I probably will not go back when I visit."}
{"text":"Ugh...I don't understand why this place is set up the way it is.  It is almost as if it is specifically designed to frustrate their customers.  The owner is sitting back laughing at the customers that actually come back after the first time.
The restaurant is set up cafeteria style.  You start by grabbing a tray, napkins, silverware.  The next stop is the drink station.....yes, the drink station.  If you are opting for water, grab a couple of cups.  Coming back to this drink station for a refill is a HUGE task.  You have to wait in line again with the customers who have not ordered yet and are getting their drinks...my daughter waited in line for 10 minutes for a refill of water while her food got cold.  Oh, and this clever establishment serves spicy BBQ sauce, so relief from a refill isn't gonna happen.  Oh, and the best part are the angry and frustrated customers seeking refills.  They don't want to wait in line for a refill, so they angrily shove and push their way through the line and force themselves up to the drink station.
After filling up the drink, you are shot down a line cafeteria style, with a cashier at the end.  Once you finish paying you are faced with balancing your tray while seeking out a table.  If you have read this review and have decided to take my advice on doubling down on drinks, be mindful that you are now faced with the challenge of balancing all of your drinks on your tray, while trying find a table.  You will have to maneuver yourself through the condiment station, coffee station, and sauce station.  It is congested and full of other customers trying to balance and hurdle themselves around.  It is quite comical to watch.  Why would a restaurant set themselves up this way?  For their own entertainment?  Is the owner trying to cut costs on soda by over complicating the system?  I would have never guessed that cutting costs on soda would be necessary when charging $5.99 for a sweet potato or $9.99 for 3 sliders.  Joe's \"Real\" BBQ is making a \"Real\" profit.
Okay, the food....meh.  The cornbread is dry.  The meat is a 6 out of a 10.  The bread is a 4 out of a 10.  The slider buns had probably been sitting out for 4 hours, they had started to harden around the edges.  The BBQ sauce wasn't anything special.  Honestly, there wasn't really much flavor.  
Bottom line, the food isn't worth the frustration of the restaurant set up.    Do people really comeback for the torture and meh quality food?"}
{"text":"Great barbecue spot. Love their sides and barbecue sauce especially their spicy one. Like that it's a buffet style so you can see what you're picking out to eat."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Food is good and always consistent. Friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"I found Joe's Real BBQ while visiting friends in Gilbert.  One word for Joe's is- GREAT.  It was great BBQ!  The line out the door was a huge indicator that I was going to be a fan of Joe's.  Thankfully, my friend had called our order in, so we went to the pick-up window outside.  I had the regular BBQ sandwich with one side ($6.99). You are able to add an extra side for another $1 but I would not have been able to finish a 2nd side.  I decided to have the chopped brisket for my sandwich and the BBQ pit beans for my side.  The brisket sandwich was delicious!  I would absolutely recommend this sandwich.  The beans were okay.  I would pick a different side next time. I ordered a kid's sandwich meal for my son ($4.49).  Great deal! The homemade root beer was yummy!  If I had seen their desserts, there is no question that I would've had to have something.  So many good choices! Apple crisp...sweet potato pie...root beer cake, etc.  I will save room for dessert next time!"}
{"text":"We walked over from Joyride as they had a ridiculous 45 minute wait for outside (in the summer).  It could not have been a better happy accident. 

We walked in and the line for the \"cafeteria style\" restaurant was almost to the door, but it moved fairly fast. I had the brisket (4/5) and the pork (3/5) and a bite of the macaroni and cheese (5/5).  We found a booth and enjoyed ourselves.  

Pluses: We were there WELL after closing (having no idea we had done so) and not one of the staff said anything to us.  The only reason they got four stars were because my boyfriend said the chicken was subpar, the pork was okay, and due to it raining there was water dripping into a bucket from the ceiling. (It led to the ambiance, but was not fab). 

Otherwise, it was great, I would go again."}
{"text":"Based on the hype from friends and this site, made plans to have birthday party for my kid who wanted \"ribs\" for dinner.  Arrived early, after calling to make sure there would not be a space issue.  Asked about the $10 off for birthday and it was affirmed. 

Arrived at 4:30 on a weekday with kids, cake and presents in tow.  The only exception to the chilly reception we received was the bus \"boy\"; he said \"hello\" and encouraged us to take a table he'd just cleaned.  When we proceeded to the back of the restaurant, not one person smiled, welcomed us, encouraged us or made recommendations about what to order.  Not one.  When we finally make the order, rather than say, writing it down (it was an order for 14 people), we had to stand at the register with each tray while the person visually scanned what was on the tray.  No, really.  Couldn't walk away with one of the 4 exact same orders to place it on the table.  All the orders had to be lined up, and then she asked (for a 3rd time) why we weren't getting drinks.  The answer, the same one as the prior two, was \"we don't drink soda\" and that was the only option. 

Frustrated, we sat down.  I had just paid $110.00 for 4 full racks of ribs.  I expected that they would be juicy, tender and delicious.  Imagine my sadness that none of these adjectives described the meal I had.  The dry, dry (did I mention dry) tiny pieces of meat stuck to the bones and lacked any flavor.  I added sauce to try to salvage the experience. After 4 little cups, it worked.  The potatoes were dry (for cheesey potatoes I would have expected something more like actual cheese potatoes).  The mac & cheese was passable, the jello was fine (although runny due to the heat) and the chicken dry without a ton of sauce (which had to be obtained on one's own).  

Cookie with the kid meal was good. Salad was fine (DO NOT get the corn relish--ruined a pretty good salad).  Bread was weird, but if you like that sort of stuff probably ok.

All in all, I sucked this horrible experience up because my daughter wanted ribs for her day.  I tried to go local, rather than to a chain and will not make that mistake again.  To add insult to injury, when I asked about the $10 off for her birthday, I was told I had to ask before the order was run up to receive the discount.  Yes, I was the one who called in advance, brought in the cake and told the manager it was for her birthday.  Good customer service, right? 

In an era where there are few people are going out to spend $100+ for a dinner, I expect a smile and a \"welcome\" before I'm ripped off.  

Will not endure this place again."}
{"text":"Love, love this place. Corn bread, mac n'cheese amazing. I always come here on my birthday and they give you a free meal with proof of ID. It's very far drive for us, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"The BBQ and sides were just OK. The cookie I bought was so raw, it tasted like cookie dough and was almost unedible.  I have a feeling that no one in the kitchen was tasting what they were putting out. I love BBQ and it breaks my heart to see this place go down hill. It will be a long time before we give them another shot. Too bad."}
{"text":"I hail from the Midwest where BBQ is practically a food group. Joe's does a fantastic job of cooking up authentic barbecue and sides. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Joe's Real BBQ is just as advertised.  The family and I had the chance to eat here 4/24/16.  
I was hesitant when I saw the cafeteria style service, but quickly realized it was the real deal.
I had a pulled pork sandwich with sides of Mac and cheese, and Cole slaw.  The pork was smoked to perfection, not too fatty.   The sauce accented and did not overpower the flavor of the meat.
My other fellow diners enjoyed the chicken, ribs and other sides.  We all enjoy bbq and know our meal was several steps above what we consider \"good\".  Joe's takes time to do it right, without the phony atmosphere of chain bbq establishments.
Add the cornbread, had enough to share because the meal portions are generous.
The atmosphere is very family friendly.  We ate outside and watched kids play in the \"back yard\".  
The smokers are behind the kitchen and you will know after tasting, they have perfected their technique.
Next time I'm in Gilbert, I will try to save room for their dessert after I treat myself to Joe's Real BBQ."}
{"text":"Ehhhh, cold meat, my wife got her sliders 15 minutes after we sat down. Disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. My wife and I went there and both got beef brisket sandwiches and they were not that good. The bread was hard and the meat was dry. I got Mac and cheese on the side and it was good but hardly any reason to go there. It was way overpriced for the food quality."}
{"text":"I've been going to Joe's for years and was reminded today of why I keep coming back after a terrible experience at the new big name establishment down the street. 

Joe's offers delicious food that tastes like there's a grandma back in the kitchen preparing her famous recipes, friendly staff who are happy and actually make eye contact with you when you're ordering and paying for your meal, and the cutest old-town Gilbert indoor/outdoor seating areas.

Thank you for continuing to represent Gilbert with a welcoming and friendly small-town vibe and fresh quality products."}
{"text":"I had the stuffed baked potatoe, it had the regular trimmings along with a large portion of pulled pork. One had a choice of brisket, turkey, chicken along with some others I don't recall. The pork was tasty, lean and melt in your mouth tender. The potato was huge. It was more than I could eat in one sitting. I'm not big on bar-b-que but I would go back to this place."}
{"text":"3/21/14 Dinner.
This restaurant was a referral from several people who said we had to go if we were visiting Phoenix, so go we did.
Let me start off by saying that we are not huge BBQ people, but we like it once in a while if it's good.  

First let's go with the positives.  The atmosphere was terrific with several choices of seating:  inside, on a semi-enclosed patio, or at picnic tables outside.  You wait in line, to get your food (almost like a cafeteria) which was not a detraction.  Prices are actually pretty reasonable.  

The sauce is the bomb...kept warm, just the right amount of sweet and spice, very good.
I had the slider sampler - chicken, pork, brisket.  Loved the chicken, it was tender and moist and then when you added the sauce...awesome.  The brisket was good, but I was really full by the time I got to it, so I couldn't finish it.  My son ate my pork, so I never even got to try but I'm sure it was good.  I had fruit on the side which was a good choice.
My husband had the 2 meat plate of pork and brisket and he enjoyed both meats and the beans he had as his side.

Now we have to talk about a couple of negatives.  The line was pretty long (although it was much longer as we were leaving)
The reason I lost my pork slider is that my son ordered the half rack of ribs and they were nearly inedible.  They were super tough, almost like jerky.  I guess we probably should have taken them back.  I tried to eat a couple of them but couldn't handle them either.
The corn bread is OK, but was a little tough and the butter, while good, was hard as a rock and never thawed out enough to spread on my cornbread, so I had to just fork some butter off and then fork off some bread to eat them together.

Having said all that, I would go back but would make sure nobody ordered ribs or corn bread.   Otherwise it was a great place."}
{"text":"dear joe, you seem to have this \"running a business\" thing down. your retro vibe is well played. i love arriving here knowing my car will always have a parking spot and, if there is a line out the door, it rarely takes more than 15 minutes. your soup-nazi (seinfeld anyone?) style ordering is efficient and to the point. 

i can't say enough about your sweet bbq sauce. it embodies all the hard work you have poured into your passion for bbq-ing.

our go-to order every time: stuffed baker (baked potato) with a side of pulled pork. three thimbles of BBQ sauce. and the macaroni 'n cheese!

this is the first stop we make with out of town guests. 

be sure to stop by Liberty Market for a lemon tart on your way home!

tip: go for the birthday trifecta! up to $10 free grub at Joe's BBQ, Joe's Farm Grill, and Liberty Market."}
{"text":"Excellent  bbq, and if you are getting an order to go, be sure to use the pick up window around the corner on Page St. for speedy and friendly ordering and pick up.  Tried the sampler with coleslaw.  The meat was fall of the bone tender, and had a rich smokey flavor.  The bbq sauce included was thick, smokey, and tangy, which was well matched with the meat.  My favorites were the chicken (some of the most tender chicken I've had in a long time), and the pulled pork.  I wasn't a big fan of the coleslaw, which was a bit bland, and more creamy with an overpowering flavor of celery (seed?) than tangy, but since the real star of the show is the bbq, it's a minor issue."}
{"text":"ok I decided to try this place because everyone I talked to says it's the best BBQ around...I had the BBQ sampler and it was just okay..  The beef not much flavor, the ribs were tender but I didn't get alot of the \"smoke\" flavor that I like in my ribs, the chicken was delish-tender and smoky, the pulled pork was excellent.  I also had the cheesy potatoes--they were not cheesy and very bland. Oh and the mac n cheese--now I love, I mean LOVE some mac n cheese and it was again ok.  Not as good as i heard it was, I expected so much more.  I also tried their homeade rootbeer--um well let's just say it has some serious bite.  I didn't like it at all, I'm not sure what gives rootbeer its bite (the best I can describe is a licorice taste) way too strong for my liking.  I will prolly try it again knowing that I liked the pulled pork.  I like the fact that they have a takeout place outside."}
{"text":"I grew up in SE NM / West Texas pit bbq country, so I'm automatically suspicious of any bbq joint I go to.  While I still haven't found bbq in Arizona that is as good as back where I grew up, I can say that I really do enjoy going to Joe's Real BBQ.

The surrounding area is pleasant and charming.  The menu is simple and straightforward, the sides are tasty, and I have never left hungry.  If you're in a hurry, they have a take-out window right off the sidewalk.

Oh, and there's a big tractor in the middle of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"FINALLY made it after living here for 6 years.. really sad.  The pulled pork is to die for!!  My 4 year old daughter is a picky eater but she loved everything!  I can't wait to come back and try their sweet potato pie."}
{"text":"Joes is consistently good. Its always a toss up between the baker or the brisket, so i usually get the baker with the brisket. I always get the cream soda of course, cant go wrong their. 

I don't know if Joes is my absolute favorite bbq in town, but its pretty darn good. Since I work in the area, I frequent their quite often. Joes is a classic and is truly in the heart of Gilbert. Good Things."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive when we went to visit my newly-relocated parents in the Phoenix area... would it be a vast cultural wasteland with chains, chains, everywhere?  Well, actually, it is... I have never seen so many freaking Wal-Marts so close together.  (Between the airport and where my parents live, I counted five -- three regular and two supercenters.  blecch.)  

But then they suggested a yummy dinner for the day after Thanksgiving... and I was thrilled that it was BARBECUE!  I am not exactly a connisseur, but from what I understand there is no bad barbecue.  Only good barbecue and really fucking good barbecue.  This falls under good, only because I don't know what really fucking good tastes like.  (This might even be really fucking good but that will have to wait until I get myself to Memphis or KC or something.)  I had the 1/2 lb meat plate, a veritable bargain with pulled pork, sliced brisket, a hunk of toasty bread, and a side of mac & cheese for only $8.99.  The regular barbecue sauce is sweet and tangy and still manages to get a little heat in there, too.  (There's also a spicier version, but I'm a wimp and I still wanted to be able to taste my meat.)    Only four stars from me, though, because after spending a long day with the family, a cold beer would have been the perfect addition to my meal -- and yet there was NO alcohol sold on the premises.  Sadness.  (Also, they don't sell their sauces on the Internet, which meant that I didn't get to bring any home with me given that I wasn't willing to check my bag for the flight home.)

I will definitely be back here every time I find myself in the area visting the fam."}
{"text":"Well I used to order there about twice a month. Today is the last time I'll ever eat there. Ordered takeout. Ordered brisket and chicken. Brisket was literally just a hunk of disgusting fat. Not even any meat you could pull off of it. What is going on there? Last time I went, my order was completely wrong. 
This is not baseball, Its not three strikes you're out. 
Two strikes and I'm out. 
I guess I'll have to make the drive to either Rudy's or Lucilles to get barbecue done right. 
I can't even believe what they tried to pass off as meat today. I can't stress how absolutely disgusting it was. I can't believe joe would actually want this type of product coming out of his restaurant."}
{"text":"Joe's is the best. I cannot get enough pulled pork- it's absolute heaven. And $10 free on my birthday? Yes please!"}
{"text":"Great brisket sandwiches.  I had the brisket pieces (cooked in sauce) and my wife had the sliced brisket, which she applied her own sauce from the two selections that they had (regular and super hot).  For sides, we had the cole slaw and potato salad, with just water to drink.

Very nice layout - no wait staff, just order up front and take back to a seat.  Large, clean and interesting (a John Deere tractor is parked inside, for example) place to eat.  My only complaint would be the high prices for beverages ($2.50 for a small bottle of water, and a 12-oz bottle of pop was well over $3).  Still, the tap water is free, and you can use the large cups that are provided.  They have lots and lots of sides to choose from, as well as desserts (which we skipped).

Bottom line?  We'd return again, and most likely will."}
{"text":"Every time we go to Phoenix we make it a point  to go to Gilbert for the best BBQ I have ever had. The food is great southern food, the staff are very friendly. The brisket is the best I have ever had, so moist and tender. The mac and cheese is amazing, along with the cheesy potatoes."}
{"text":"Food was bland. Line was long- seems to be held up by the cashier."}
{"text":"First time here...grabbed Matthew and asked him what was good and he was right ... best Turkey and mac and cheese in town!!! Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a Texas latecomer, having lived there for 12 years now.  So, I KNOW good BBQ.  Joe's does it great.  There are many opinions about BBQ re: wood, meat, sauce.  Joe's uses pecan wood, not a common choice.  Most folks go with oak, mesquite, or hickory.  Kudos for being original.  It imparts a sweet flavor to the meats.  We ordered for a large group of 28 and opted for turkey (chicken is boring), brisket (a Texas MUST), and pulled pork.  All of the meats were SUPER moist, tender, juicy, melt-in-your mouth delicious.  Perfect smokiness.  Sauce was tangy and spicy, as it should be.  Sides included coleslaw, in which we debated about the \"secret\" ingredient; most of us felt that it was orange.  We also had mac 'n' cheese and cheesy potatoes.  Each person had his/her favorite side.  We had NO leftovers!  Everyone liked it.  NO empty plates.  So, the bottom line is that this is the REAL DEAL.  Skip the commercialized chains and go to Joe's.  Now, time to head back to Texas. 

Bonus: they offer a military discount in uniform.  Alas, I left mine 2 states away."}
{"text":"One of the best local private owned BBQ restaurants. They also offer free meal for birthday visitors. 

Their rib is as good as what  you see on TV. It's more like country style BBQ. Their homemade root beer is great too. 

If you like BBQ, you should give them a try!"}
{"text":"Awww, I love this place!  It reminds me of being at my grandparents' house in Kansas.  The food is great and the people are wonderful.  It is a little pricey, other than that it would probably be a 5.  Try everything, it's good!"}
{"text":"Favorite bbq place great portions and the mac and cheese is the best mac and cheese i have ever had sodas are great and cookies are to die for everything about Joes bbq is great and unique!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ!  I love the atmosphere of the restaurant.  Everyone was very polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Probably have been here at least 25 times and can't say I've ever been disappointed.  The BBQ is delicious and the ambiance is always good.  Good pricing and yes would recommend."}
{"text":"We've been making to trips to Joe's Real BBQ when we've in the area.  It's good BBQ and the atmosphere really adds to it. We visited again this last week after tasting BBQ all across the south this winter.  We wanted to compare -- again -- Joe's to the others.  

There were four of us and we ordered a combination of food.  Everyone seem to be very pleased with it.  My husband thought the brisket was fantastic.  I thought it was good but not quite as good as I had remembered.  

There are choices for combo plates, single meat plates or double meat plates.  I ordered the double meat plate and it sure didn't seem like a lot of brisket for a double.  The beans are good.  I normally get the coleslaw with brisket but I noticed the cabbage was cut big so opted for the applesauce instead.

We sat in the booths to the right as you walk in the door.  The problem with those booth seats is that when there is a line (that happens often) all the folks are standing right next to your table.  We had forgotten about that.  

We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This clearly is an extremely popular place. The line is long. The takeout window is a great deal faster, if it matters to you. As is often the case, whether this is \"real\" barbecue is going to depend on where in the U.S. you are from. If you are from a region where \"barbecue\" is synonymous with pork, this is not your place. We had the Barbecue Sampler -- ribs, chicken, and what was called pulled pork on the menu but appeared to be coarsely chopped. The pork was fine, but not what you would get in the South. The ribs, however, were really good -- not doused in sauce, tender, smoky (although I'm no rib expert; if you are, take the recommendation with a grain of salt). The chicken was pretty darn good -- moist, falling-off-the-bone tender, smoky and nicely seasoned. The provided barbecue sauce was just OK -- better than store-bought Heinz, but not much different. Our sides were mac and cheese -- good, but it could use stronger cheese -- and cole slaw, which was OK, not great, though it seems everyone has different standards for cole slaw."}
{"text":"Sliced BBQ Chicken Meat Plate

Tonight I was in the mood for some real good BBQ food; Joe's Real BBQ it was.  I arrived on a Friday night around 7:30. It was a perfect night for BBQ. I parked across the street. When walking up to the restaurant you could see a big neon sign which was right above the door \"Joe's Real BBQ\". The smell of pecan wood chips filled the air and the smell of BBQ poured through the door as I opened them. I waited in line for about 15 minutes. Half way through the line a small cute older woman offered me a menu. As I got to the front of the line I grabbed my tray, silverware, and a black cherry soda for me. A young gentleman asked me what I wanted. I ordered sliced BBQ chicken plate with potato salad and macaroni n cheese. I paid with my debit card and was on my way to enjoy some BBQ. Through the doors I entered the patio area. I saw stringed lights hanging from all the trees. I sat down on a park bench on the patio. I dove into my dinner plate. I grabbed some bread, hot BBQ sauce, and my pecan smoked BBQ chicken. It was so delicious. The chicken was so moist and cooked just to order. Joe's offers these chopped pickled onions. They were so delicious with the bread and chicken. The black cherry soda washed down the BBQ perfectly. The potato salad that came with my dinner plate was also tasty. The potato salad wasn't really cold to me.  The mac n cheese came along with my dinner plate. I was definitely disappointed with it. It had some bread crumbs sprinkled on top. It was lukewarm and a little bland. However I ate it and enjoyed it. The best part of dinner was definitely the BBQ chicken. As I sad and listened to old country music and children running around playing. I savored my meal and enjoyed the spring night. I will be returning for some \"real BBQ\" thanks to Joe's. Hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I did!"}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with Joe's except for choosing a time when everyone else is also at Joe's...which is pretty much always! It's a popular place so you must be prepared to wait in a line. The good news is that the line does keep moving and if you enjoy conversation with your party, you'll be at the front of it before you know it. When we visited yesterday, there was a friendly man (Joe's business partner's father) greeting guests as they made their way through the line. He was the king of small talk...greeting each new group as if they were the most interesting people he'd ever met. He answered all questions with a smile and grace and helped you forget that you'd been in the line 30 minutes or longer. Genius! The restaurant is clean and well maintained. The bus-staff does a great job of cleaning off tables and keeping them turned. The food is good and there's a nice variety of items to choose from. If I could make one suggestion it would be to add a non-spicy sausage to the menu."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm still mourning the loss of J Ruggs, my favourite BBQ place that went out of business last July... but I came into Joe's today hoping to find a replacement pulled pork sandwich that I could love just as much. It wasn't here at Joe's. 

My boyfriend ordered brisket, sausage and cheesy potatoes - all of which I sampled. The sausage was probably my favourite (and I ended up eating 90% of it off his plate)... but I felt like the cheesy potatoes were under seasoned. Maybe I just like potatoes salty.

Also - not a huge fan of the soda machine placement. When the line was long, I felt bad trying to squeeze through just to refill my drink.

I'm not saying the food was awful... but it just wasn't what I was looking for. The pulled pork sandwich hunt continues. :("}
{"text":"Love it! All I can say is, that the food is always great at this place. I have never had anything that wasn't absolutely devine.  I have tried BBQ in places that are known for the best BBQ, i.e. Kansas City, Fort Worth, etc. Having found this place, thanks to my husband, we are hooked."}
{"text":"They've got some great food over at Joe's, my favorite is the jumbo pulled pork sandwich, which I always order with some shredded cheddar cheese on top. I am a huge mac and cheese fan, but I don't really dig the whole breadcrumbs on top thing, which is really the only thing I can even come up with as a negative, aside from the fact that it gets a little pricey. Also, be wary of Sunday morning/early afternoon, as the line can extend the entire length of the building with the after church crowd (as I discovered today)."}
{"text":"Being from Texas we know great bbq. The line took a little long, but the food was decent bbq. I got a lot of meat for the price and the salad dressing was good. We sat outside and a family was letting their kids run around like maniacs which took away from the peaceful outside patio. I think the bbq sauce was a little thick, but it added a lot of flavor to the meat. The jalapeño sausage was the right amount of kick. Would recommend this place for some decent bbq."}
{"text":"Yes I may be picky.  But now I feel like I have to vomit.  A co-worker of mine told me that I had to try this place if I loved bbq.  Well, I am a sucker for ribs, but today I feel like just a sucker.  Horrible service \"I would like to order a carry-out.\" \"Then move over there\"), horrible homemade Root Beer (I am drinking plain syrup and sugar), and horrible pain that I now have in my stomach.

2 stars are for the Mac n Cheese...which I must say was burnt just right.  (I love burnt Mac n cheese...yum!)"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian with a husband who is meat lover, going out for barbecue can be complicated.  Joe's is perfect for us - my husband loves their bbq and I love their sides.  My personal favorites are the side salad with tomatoes and bbq ranch dressing, cheesy jalapeno potatoes and sweet corn.  They also have excellent mac & cheese, cornbread and lemonade.  My husband always gets the Jumbo Sandwich with mac & cheese.  

Joe's also has THE BEST Birthday deal - $10 to spend on anything on the menu.  This is only valid on your Birthday and you have to present your ID."}
{"text":"The food is great! no doubt!  The resturant is pretty cool too.  My kids actually enjoy the place, and eat the food and they always get to pick their favorite candy when they are done from all the old fashion candies.  Every once and awhile their line gets backed up pretty far, but i guess most resturants have that problem on a Saturdays.  The problem could be fixed with a little rearranging of a few things but it isn't that big of a deal.  We will go back many times in the future."}
{"text":"Another one of the great places in Gilbert owned by the Joes family.  Liberty market, Joes Farm Grill, and Joes Bbq are excellent on every level.  

This place is amazing because It is everything that is nostalgic about downtown Gilbert. They haven't lost the family owned feeling when you walk in. Staff is always friendly and helpful.  

Now on the to the food. I really love their BBQ, everything from the chicken, pork, ribs and brisket.  And to top it off their sides are outstanding and the sauce is so good you could drink it.  

This is a staple in Gilbert and will be for many years."}
{"text":"We had take out here tonight, we eat here every time my parents are in town. The Mac and cheese is probably everyone's favorite and no matter what meat you get you won't be disappointed. I love all three of Joe's restaurants. If you are ever here on a Saturday night the line loops around the building but don't freak out it moves quick. If you are a lemon cake person don't pass it up, it is fabulous. And if it's your birthday let them know, you get $10 in food!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.

Friendly, helpful service.

Nice decor.

Clean.

Good prices.

Best BBQ ribs."}
{"text":"Great place for BBQ for lunch. Served cafe style. Home made root beer on tap. Sausage was a little dry but the ribs and brisket are awesome. Parking is around back and the seating is large so you always have a table."}
{"text":"Never disappointed with this place!

Get the brisket, get the pork. Get the beans. They're bangin'!!!!!! The sauce is delicious the mac and cheese is pretty good, the cheesy potatoes are good too. The real standouts I would have to say are the brisket and the beans. Do NOT skip the beans. Trust me. 

I'm not even a meat person but I do like Joe's because everything is cooked just right. Order extra of everything and you will be glad you did. Makes for great leftovers. Don't forget to get some BBQ sauce too. Personally, I'm not one to douse everything in BBQ sauce, just a little dip here and there, but the sauces are really good. 

Even my young niece and nephew enjoy the food. It's simple, down-home good food even the pickiest eaters can enjoy. I've never actually dined-in at this place. I've always called in an order for pick up or ordered right at the take-out window. They are pretty fast.

My future father-in-law wants me to choose Joe's to cater our wedding rehearsal dinner. Did I really ever imagine in my wildest princess wedding dreams that I would choose BBQ for my rehearsal dinner? Not really, but Joe's is excellent, and we're heading toward a laid-back wedding theme anyway to take it easy on our many out-of-town family and friends. I am sure they will all love Joe's and I can't wait for them to try it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite barbecue joint in town. Love to come here on my birthday and get $10 to spend however I want.  

Usually get the Brisket or the Pork. Always enjoy their BBQ Pit beans. 

Best BBQ sauce and Hot BBQ sauce around.

Still family-owned and always serving fresh and delicious pecan-smoked meats."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. I come here every year on my birthday with my whole family as a birthday tradition (and several times throughout the year because I LOVE their food). This year my birthday falls on a Sunday and as a personal choice we do not go out to eat, shop, etc. on Sundays. I called joes to see if they'd honor it today instead of tomorrow, and they said no. That's $70+ worth  of food they are losing in business because they won't honor the birthday deal a day early for religious views. We were going to have our wedding there and rent a private line and everything on their patio but I'm just very disappointed right now, I don't really want to"}
{"text":"Fantastic pulled pork and the macaroni and cheese was delicious. We waited about 45 minutes at 6:30 on a beautiful Saturday night! Love the way the smokers fill the air...."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in AZ (well its up there). I used to live down the street from here when I lived in AZ. Now when I visit my folks I sometimes make a trip to this place. I can't even begin to tell you my favorite dishes here because it changes every time. Their pulled pork is great. Their brisket is great. Their backed potatoes and side dishes are to die for. Typing this right now is making me crave this place as we speak. 

The building is great and the outdoor seating is even better. I can't say enough good things about this place. Its AWESOME!"}
{"text":"This was the first time that I actually ate inside. I have been here a couple times but usually just order outside and take it home. The food is always great and everyone is always so nice. I have tried just about everything on the menu and it doesn't matter what I pick because I am always satisfied."}
{"text":"Excellent beef brisket and the mac and cheese was delicious.  The cornbread with honey butter was good, too, though pricy for $1.99.  I didn't care for the cole slaw, though.  It looked better than it tasted.  I couldn't tell if I was tasting apple or spearmint in it, but it just wasn't a hit with me.  My one \"beef,\" pun intended, with my first visit to Joe's this weekend was how long the serving line was, yet there was only one cashier.  Thank goodness Joe's apparently has its carryout business behind or alongside the outside of the restaurant, otherwise it would be a worse logjam inside.  This has nothing to do with Joe's, but outside its doors is Gilbert's quaint central business district, which would be nice to walk around and shop after eating at Joe's, yet the only shop I found afterwards was a nice arts and local crafts business and a furniture store.  I wish some of those empty storefronts had tenants and retailers to visit after eating at Joe's.  Joe's is clearly a destination and it's too bad there aren't other nearby retailers to enjoy the traffic that this restaurant generates in the downtown."}
{"text":"Ok, it's a little hipster for my taste, but the BBQ is pretty good. I'm waffling between 3 and 4 stars, but I'm sticking with 3 for now for a couple of reasons. I travel a lot around the country and spend a lot of time eating bbq. I know Phoenix isn't known for it's bbq, so I'm biased. Joe's is good. And it may be the best available in the area. It just didn't completely bowl me over. 

I visited for lunch on a Sunday and Gilbert is a little ways outside of Phoenix, but not so far as to be an issue. It's a small downtown area, filled with some pretty cool looking restaurants/bars. I imagine at one point it was probably a dusty little town and if you squint hard, you might be able to imagine at tumbleweed at one point. Now it's a pretty trendy outer 'burb. 

Joe's fits right into the mix, locally, but it's not a bbq joint at all, which is kind of a shame. It's tasty, but the surroundings aren't quite as authentic as I would hope for. 

As for the food: I got the two-meat combo with brisket and ribs. The brisket was very good, but a little inconsistent from piece to piece. I guess I got six or seven pieces and some were just below excellent, and some weren't as good. They all tasted great, but as a Certified BBQ Judge (yes, there are those things, and I took a class! lol), I was looking for a more precise texture. Some pieces were kind of mealy and gristly. There was also a significant amount of unrendered fat which should've been trimmed before cooking. Most people probably won't be as picky. The ribs were pretty good too, nice even flavor, not smoky, but the brisket stood out in my mind. 

The sides, I had the BBQ pit beans and potato salad, were pretty good, if not memorable. I had lemonade but there was no obvious way to get a refill without barging in front of a long line of people. They seem to have built it this way to discourage refills. But when you pay $2.29 for a drink, a refill shouldn't be hard to get. I also wish you could get Sweet Tea, but that doesn't seem to be a thing in these parts. 

I spent two days in Phoenix and was able to hit two BBQ restaurants on Sunday (a lot of them are closed Sundays). I got to Joe's for lunch and one in Cave Creek for dinner. While the drive to Cave Creek is extraordinary, the BBQ was not. If you want some pretty good BBQ, save the drive and eat at Joe's."}
{"text":"If I were to have written this review 2 years ago, it would have been 5 stars, but the portions keep on shrinking at an alarming rate. Today I had the meat plate and no more than 2 tablespoons of pulled pork, and brisket were on the plate. Also, what's with the staff? They are like robot drones! Absolutely no personality! The food's flavor, and quality, however, are very good, the place is always sqeaky clean.. and of course the decor is very amusing. Being a hungry hungry hippo, I would prefer a slight price increase, to maintain portion size."}
{"text":"The meat is amazing. Sides are kind of hit-or-miss in my opinion. It's got a fun atmosphere & is Always busy.  Very casual but worth a visit. 
I actually prefer their sister restaurant Joe's Farm Grill, which is better all around (& you can get some of the BBQ options there too)."}
{"text":"Good environment, the restaurant is set up similar to something you would find in a theme park, with a tray line. The seating has a good set up for large groups. The sliced turkey was very good. The pork was pretty fatty. The ribs were ok. The base sauce they use was somewhat bland. The brisket was a little dry. Overall the food was slightly better than ok. A little pricy for what you get, but not a bad overall experience."}
{"text":"We are visiting family in the Phoenix area and they suggested we all go to Joe's for lunch. My husband was quite happy with the giant sized root beer float and we loved the stuffed baked potato with pulled pork. It was large enough for us to share and had wonderful potato toppings. 
While we didn't have dessert or corn bread, they look amazing and plan to come back next time we return so we can try more things!"}
{"text":"I'm literally almost as old as this restaurant and I love it as much as I did the first time my parents took me. Very friendly and kind staff and amazing BBQ. My go to is always the BBQ pulled pork sandwich with extra spicy BBQ sauce and a side of their mac n cheese. Great for big or small crowds and nice for a quick lunch or dinner with family/friends. They have tons of seating inside and a lovely outside patio that is nicely lit up at night."}
{"text":"You will wait about 30 minutes to eat and your mouth will water the whole time as you smell the delectable flavored smoked beef and pork. Joes is cafeteria style BBQ in the heart of the Gilbert Historical District so the setting is inviting. The brisket and links were nicely spiced and simmered in Joe's moderately spicy sauce which has substance without being sweet."}
{"text":"Went here for the 2nd time on Saturday. It was around 4:00. Same thing again. It was just average and the meat was very disappointing. 
I had the moist/fatty brisket. It was so overdone, kind of like pot roast would be the best way to describe it. We cook with pecan wood all the time and w didn't taste any smoke flavor at all. My husband had the same as I did with Mac n cheese for a side. Very blah mac n cheese. Nothing seemed fresh, was like a cafeteria. You get a tray and go up and order. The homemade root beer was good and the ambience was great  prices weren't bad, $10.99 for a 1/2 lb.of meat and 1 side. I think we were spoiled going to Little Miss BBQ, which is hands down the BEST bbq in the Phoenix area. 
Wish I could give this a better review. After being in Texas and on the BBQ trail, I've had a lot of BBQ to compare this to and I can only give Joe's 2 stars."}
{"text":"I would give this place two stars, but since Joe is such a great figure for the community it is a 3 star place. The food is average tasting, not much flavor. I went there today for the 5th time ever hoping it will be tastier, but that is not the case. Its not a bad place, not just one I would desire to go to. The best bbq in AZ is Bobby Qs on the westside."}
{"text":"Yes the food is great but something is happening lately where the customer service is just horrible and the kitchen staff is downright rude including nasty looks when you make a specific request. In fact the last time was so horrible the manager dismissed the employee. It has become so bad that this time I felt I had to report it."}
{"text":"I live in the Los Angeles area and wish we had a Joe's Real BBQ here. Ate there for the first time last Saturday and had a sampler plate--which is the best deal on the menu. I love smoked meats and expected to like the ribs the most. I actually thought the chicken was the best of the four meats, followed by the pulled pork, brisket and the ribs. I had the beans and corn as sides, which were OK. I didn't add any BBQ sauce...just ate things the way they came on the plate.

Everyone has their own preference or regional experiences when it comes to smoking and BBQ. Joe's meat is smoked with pecan wood-- which was a first for me. It did not seem to be as overwhelming or smoky as hickory or some other woods (at home I prefer hickory & applewood for pork, and applewood for chicken). 

I visit Phoenix two or three times a year and plan to go to Joe's as much as I can. Lots of seating. We sat outside because the weather was perfect and had a great time. Oh, they have their own root beer and sell coffee for $0.25."}
{"text":"I would give them three stars if they had appropriate line length and appropriate customer appraisal. I was excited to try out this place because of high reviews and because its sister restaurant was featured at the Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. Unfortunately, it is not that great. 

BBQ pork was tasty. Brisket was mediocre. Temperature of food was inconsistent: some barely warm and some semi-hot.

Will I come back? No, thank you."}
{"text":"I really wanted BBQ last night, and wanted to try something new and different. Came on Yelp and found this place.  Its in a cute little part of Gilbert, and around several other resturants in a nice part of town. 

Parked my car and went inside.  I loved the decor!!  OMG!  HUGE, spacious, very open and pleasantly decorated.  Plenty of seating!  Menu is front and center, and very easy to read and make sense of.  You have several options and dishes to chose from...I went for the small selection of the Beef Brisket in sauce, with 2 sides.  I did the beans and corn.  They also have a little station in the middle with BBQ sauce, onions, peppers and such.  

The line itself kind of has a boston market feel to it.  You grab a tray, and place your order with the gal behind the glass.  She scoops your food for you, and passes it underneath the glass.  Take your food to the end of the line, pay, and there you are.  They have 3 different seating areas.  In the resturant they have seating, with booths and benches.  The second seating area is picnic tables in an air conditioned garage type area.  You actually have to go through a set of doors and sort of leave the resturant to get to this part.  The third seating area is picnic tables competely outside....no covering, no AC.  yea.  Not for me.  I like eating indoors!

I would return to this place, but my only true complaint is the drink station.  In order to refill your drink, you must cut back into the line to get to the drink station.  BAD IDEA!  I can see people getting fussy and annoyed and think your taking cuts when your really just trying to get more Dr. Pepper.   They need to have a second station somewhere so people can refill their beverages and NOT cut back into the food line to do so!  Big pain in the butt, and I docked them a full star for it.  This place is plenty big enough to throw a second beverage station somewhere in the layout of the store.

I will return here for eating again, as I did enjoy my experience."}
{"text":"I wish I had written this review sooner. I was told this was the place to go by my friend and local meat eating specialist. 

I'm really, really glad we went. There is something about Arizona barbeque. Its delicious, its tender, its different. This place is the best example of it that I have had the pleasure to consume. 

I love the atmosphere. Its old town southwestern and roomy."}
{"text":"Joe's is truly a special place!! What makes this place so awesome is that you literally feel like you stepped back into an American farmhouse situated somewhere in the 1940's. The employees are fully compitent in their abilities and they seem happy to work there. They have homemade root beer, which is very tasty and leaves a smooth and flavorful aftertaste. They also serve Barq's Red Cream soda from tap, which is impossible to find anywhere in the southwest. The outdoor dining area has benches in a picnic style setting, while the indoor dining area features a vintage John Deere tractor as the center piece. The side dishes are kind of small (one scoop), so you might want to opt for and extra side...the mac and cheese rocks!! I also recommend getting cornbread or lemon cake for desert!!"}
{"text":"Home of the last standing free birthday meal.  Joes is an Arizona Classic that makes good on its reputation.  My friends and I swear by Joes BBQ.  1/4 mile away you can smell that aroma, and when you get there you can expect that down home feel."}
{"text":"We're not experts in BBQ by any means - proven by the fact that we didn't realize there was extra bbq sauce available until we were pretty much done with our food. 

I had a chicken sandwich and she had a pulled pork sandwich. She thought the pork was a little dry without the extra bbq sauce but she liked the smoked flavor. 

The chicken had some sauce already on it and was pretty good. I would have liked the extra bbq sauce on it. 

For a side we both had the cheesy potatoes, which were not that great. They had a bit of heat (spiciness) to them. 

The food is affordable."}
{"text":"I love Joe's BBQ!!!! This is my favorite BBQ place in the Phoenix/Chandler/Gilbert area. I love this place the most because of the atmosphere!!! It's the best family go-to spot to grub on some awesome BBQ and have a great time! You can even bring your dog and eat outside on a nice day! 

If you don't know what to order, just order the \"BBQ sampler\"! Comes with brisket, pork, BBQ chicken, and 2 ribs! YOU MUST get the Mac n cheese and he sweet BBQ beans as your 2 sides!!!! Those two sides will be the best options! To be honest, I've never had beans as good as at Joe's BBQ.  I always end up getting a root beer float there cause there's nothing better than having a BIG ASS mug of fresh root beer with a heaping scoop of vanilla ice cream for only $4!!!! Plus you can get refills!?!?? I'm in heaven! 

So there's only one place that has meat better than Joe's, and that's \"Little Miss BBQ\" in Tempe, but the reason why I rate this better than them is that Joe's BBQ provides the best overall experience! There are places to sit everywhere, it's fast even when there's a long line, you'll only be waiting maybe 20 minutes tops, and the people there support the local businesses which is cool! 

You gotta try this place! You'll be making this your go-to spot for barbecue."}
{"text":"The odor wafting from the restaurant coupled with line that literally wraps around the building would lead one to believe they were in for a real treat. They would be wrong. I've tried Joe's twice and simply don't see what all the fuss is about. The barbecue is good, but nothing to write home to mom about. The sides are disappointing, loaded with fat and lack much in the way of taste. Their standard barbecue sauce has no kick, although I did discover that they have a pot of habanero sauce on the condiments table during my last visit. In addition, this is cafeteria style dining. That line I mention, really does spill out into the street on Friday and Saturday nights and then snacks right through the middle of the restaurant. It is certainly an interesting dining experience.

On the plus side, the owner is great - very much dedicated to our town and is certainly hitting the sweet spot of many a Gilbertonian. I'll give it one more try."}
{"text":"Sampler platter - chicken : moist and pre sliced. I like that. Beef : sliced thin also. About 1/8 \". Pink on edges. Tastes good. Nothing life changing. Pork :  they do this really well. Shredded and moist and you can really taste the slow smoke. Ribs : fantastic lots of meat. Sweat sauce. Tender.  Side of potatoes are a must. The cheesy green Chili's make it awesome. The chocolate chip cookie is worth the trip alone. Very nostalgic place with history. A must visit if for some reason you have not been there. Take the family. You really have not been here?? Stop reading and just go."}
{"text":"Maybe I went on an \"off\" day; the food was okay but nothing amazing.  I liked the setup, service and the outside was pretty cool but I couldn't get in to the food. I had the combo platter so when I take my wife, because she still wants to try it, I'll try something else."}
{"text":"Oh my god the food is good here!  Do not miss it if you're in the area - or if you're nearby, make the trip.
We had the sampler so that was in the 10-20$ range, but a lot of people (locals?) seemed to be having sandwiches (under 10$).   I brought half of mine home and enjoyed it as long as I could.  I used the chicken in sandwiches and it was amazing.  My mouth is watering . . . 
Do not miss the mac & cheese as a side, I've been craving it ever since.  The potato salad was good too.  I loved the homemade root beer but my friend took a pass because it was diet.  They have Boylan's too.
It's cafeteria style, so very casual.  We were served quickly and the staff were nice.  There are big long tables and booths so it's good for large and small groups and they had a nice outdoor area.  The decor is lots of antique country/farm.  Fun."}
{"text":"Joe's is the best BBQ joint in the east valley. PERIOD. 

If Whitney Houston had found this joint she might have become addicted to their smoking.......in lieu of what Bobby introduced her to......

Go get addicted at Joe's. Wash it down with an Andre the Giant sized root beer float...."}
{"text":"Great place to take the kids to play and have some bbq. Nice outdoor area and good solid bbq."}
{"text":"Disappointing. We have come here for years and each time the food quality gets worse. The chicken was dry, brisket was all fat, and the ribs were cold. Even the cheesey potatoes were dry.  The only thing good was the pulled pork and my son's cookie.  The people are very nice and always a clean place."}
{"text":"Joe's was recommended to use by my fathers friend who hadnt been there in 10 years, but still remembered the name and everything about it!  The place was perfect.  Great decor, awesome and friendly staff and amazing BBQ smoked with Pecan wood.  I got the sampler and took half home.  If you like BBQ this is the only place you need to go."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Everything is great I order the full rack of ribs and it's huge!! Brisket is so tender and juicy  and tasty. This is really the only place I get ribs from , we take all out of town family and visitors her and they all love it and now it's a must for lunch and dinner for them all. Vary rarely the rib ends get a little dry and i wish they whete moist like the other pieces but all in all this is the number one bbq in az! Price is far for the amount of food and the sides are home made and delicious!! Real mac N cheese , bbq beans with meat inside! HUGE backed potatoes \" biggest I've seen an moist! Home made root beer ....! Need I say more guys!! MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"My sister was leaving back to Texas and I decided to find a BBQ place that may have a similar taste and feel. I found this place through a Mesa newspaper ad.

Anywho, as we pulled in I was like I hope this place is good. We parked in the back and walked along the side where you can order your food to go. As we waited we decided to head inside and as we walked through the dining area to the line, I was already eyeballing other peoples plates. I could see the ribs and at that point I couldn't decided on a plate, but went ahead with the plate that had everything.

I ordered Ribs, Pork, and chicken and as I was ordering I seen some sausage come out of their bbq oven. So I didn't even hesitate because every since I've moved here from Texas, I have yet to find a place to have the yummy peppery tasting sausage we have back home. I asked for a piece of it for tasting and was granted a taste. Needless, to say I ordered a quarter lb with everything else I ordered.

The chicken was without a doubt great smoked bbq chicken I have always wanted. Great flavor with not an overbearing smoke flavor. Also the ribs were tender and packed with flavor and smoke taste. The smoked pork was smoke tasty but a little on the sweeter side, but that was nothing the Habenero BBQ couldn't accommodate. Which is offered on the side. Oh and the bread tasted like some homemade goodness bread. As if it was fresh out of the oven with a little garlic butter. Superb! The Mac and cheese was super duper great.

In Texas, we have bbq joints in every corner. I have tried it all and I will have to say this is one place I would have on my top list if we had it there.

BIG bbq sauce thumbs up for this joint!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Joe's many, many times.   While I didn't enjoy standing in a cafeteria line so long I was outside the door (it is Phoenix in July after all), one does expect that type of line at Joe's, so I am not rating down for that.

Sadly, the food was not up to their typical quality of just a few years ago.   The ribs were dry, no moisture in there meat at all.   The macaroni and cheese was also dry.  The homemade root beer was overly \"spicey\", noted by all in our party who had it.

There were 9 in our party.   All are long time Joe fans.   We all agreed that the food has gone down hill and was lacking.    I think Rudy's may be a better choice.

It would greatly speed up the line if they would install a second beverage center somewhere in the restaurant!   People have to jimmie back into the line of people waiting for food to reach a drink refill, slows down the line.

The smell of the wood smoke is pleasant."}
{"text":"Great smoked bbq ribs! Best smoked ribs I have ever eaten, not to Smokey- Just right! Baked beans were great as well. Had home made root beer with it. Great deco, liked the cafeteria style set up, was clean and everyone was friendly, to include other customer's.  I would certainly eat there again."}
{"text":"Wow, not like I remember. My potato was cold and wouldn't melt the butter, and dried out. My pork was dry and had hard chunks in it. We got here at 5:15 so it should of been fresh for the dinner crowd."}
{"text":"Food is always good here! An absolute Gilbert town classic! The place is a little bit dated and not as clean as it use to be, but if your looking for some real home style BBQ you can't pass this up."}
{"text":"I haven't been in a while, but the brisket just wasn't as good as I remembered it being.  It'll be a while before I head back."}
{"text":"I can't believe people think this is good.  They must like  dry meat with  no flavor. And expensive. I got the sampler -I tried the ribs -like leather and they don't even remove the membrane on the back of the ribs-gross. Brisket so dry I couldn't eat. Pork was barely ok but again not much flavor. The chicken was more moist then the rest but still not much flavor. Beans were weak and coleslaw I took one bite and threw out. And to boot they charged me almost 3.00 for a 12 once bottle of root beer. 

Go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Great family atmosphere. Prices were reasonable for amount of food. Cheesy potatoes and bread were too spicy for my family. We all exchanged ours for Mac and cheese, which was yummy. The homemade root beer and cream soda were really good. Overall great experience, but I wouldn't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My wife disagrees with my rating, but she doesn't like BBQ so what does she know?!?

Joe's BBQ is always tender and has a good smokey flavor. The sampler platter is the best value for money, with 3/4 lb of assorted meats, although they are often chintzy with the brisket. Their sauces are a little thin, but you ladle up as much as you like from warmers, and they have regular and spicy.  The meat that surprises me the most is the smoked chicken breast, because it is atypical but delicious and moist. Another bonus is the barbeque ranch salad dressing. Their baked potatoes are what my wife ends up with and thinks they are fine. And of their available sides, the pit beans are kinda gross, but the mac n' cheese more than makes up for that.

The atmosphere is cafeteria style with a serving line, long tables and only a few booths along the wall. It is family friendly.  I like having a locally owned BBQ option, even though Famous Dave's isn't bad. It's a great place to bring visitors or newcomers to the area, as it is a unique restaurant in the heart of downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"I had a sampler plate, beans and coleslaw.

I don't know if it was the pink chicken on the sampler plate or the mayo in the coleslaw but I was serverely sick the next day.

Don't think I'll be eating there again."}
{"text":"My father is from the deep South and when he comes to visit I take him here... Not my style of food but he LOVES IT.  the bbq sauce is good,  but overall,  I find it too fatty and greasy.  I also do not care for the cafeteria setup. Reminds me too much of a Furrs... If you remember those :) however.  I will admit that their chocolate chip cookies are da bomb"}
{"text":"Family took me to Joe's about a year ago. I was impressed. I think I had a little taste of everything, including a desire to go back.

Although Joe's BBQ is out of my hood, it was good enough to make a special trip again to have another lunch. I have been wanting to go back and, so when a friend suggested we meet there, I wasn't disappointed. 

I probably ate way too much. But it was worth it. Satisfied. And I think I ate my meat allotment for at least a couple of weeks. 

My only disappointment was the sweet potato pie. I've lived in the south and eaten some of the best southern pies . . . and this one just wasn't up to snuff. It had a slightly chemical/ weird spice taste. But, have no fear, they have other yummy desserts on their menu. Your sweet tooth will have no trouble finding something to fulfill its needs. 

And there is always their homemade rootbeer . . . worth the trip!

{"text":"I moved to Seattle 5 years ago but travel to AZ twice a year to visit family. During my visits a trip to Joe's is a top priority! This is my family's go to for birthday celebrations and I miss it dearly!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! The food was so good I stuffed my self to the point of physical pain and then spent the next two days wishing I had left-overs.

Its an absolute must dine!"}
{"text":"DELISH!!   My first time in AZ and our family brought us here for our farewell meal before we headed back to CA.  The food was awesome!  We had the BBQ sampler, brisket, corn, mac&cheese, and some potato thing.  The sides were a big bland, but the BBQ was good as well as their sauce.  I mixed in some onions with my pulled pork, added extra sauce and it was delish!  Great way to end our trip down south!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! I love bbq, but Joes beats out all other bbq joints with their side dishes alone!! They are all delicious and a must try!! The stuffed baker is my all time favorite menu item.  Don't forget to order dessert afterwards.  The bourbon blueberry cheesecake is to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"The ribs were excellent.  The brisket was just ok.  Their sides were good as welll.   This place was good and above average for a barbeque spot."}
{"text":"Joe's has long been one of our favorite restaurants in Gilbert.  The pulled pork is excellent, the sides are even better, and the service is always friendly.

Don't be intimidated by a long line, even out the door, as it moves fast.  The cheesy potatoes and corn are great.  The lemon cake is very moist and a nice finish to a meal.

Be sure to stop by on your birthday and pick up a free meal.

The kids love running around outside in the grassy area, and always enjoy going to Joe's."}
{"text":"The outdoor farmhouse decor is incredible but not as incredible as its ribs. This is a very reasonably price, exceptional tasting barbecue. The cafeteria style isn't usually my favorite, but it worked for this place. The ribs were awesome, but the sides and dessert options were equally impressive. It takes a really good barbecue place to turn basic sides like mac and cheese and beans into memorable dishes. Additionally, their unique sweet potato pie dessert was to die for. Definitely worth one visit (or ten)!"}
{"text":"Not a huge BBQ fan but this place is great! Try everything you can because you will never go wrong. I love the cornbread!!! This is a great family place where kids can run around and have a great time!"}
{"text":"Okay boys and girls here we go again on another episode of Fred tries local BBQ. 

This week it was Joe's Real BBQ in Gilbert. I have lived in the Gilbert Area now for about 3 years and I frequent Downtown, mainly for Joyride Tacos. 

I was hankering for some BBQ and didn't feel like driving to my usual spot in Tempe so I decided to give Joe's a shot. Disappointment ensued. 

Having never been before I got the BBQ sample late with some cheesy potatoes. 

It comes with ribs, chicken, brisket and pulled pork. The ribs were fairly decent. Everything else was very very dry. I understand that things happen when cooking or that not everything comes out perfectly, but when 3 out of the 4 things I had were to dry, there is an issue. Especially when they are dry at 1PM during the lunch rush, when everything should be totally fresh. 

The BBQ sauce itself isn't too shabby. Sweet with some tang so overall can't complain there. 

But. Decent BBQ sauce and Okay ribs are not enough to make me return. Do yourself a favor and head over to Rudy's BBQ in Chandler and enjoy much better food for the same price."}
{"text":"In the past year or so I have become a BBQ nut.  I think it started when I finally went to Henry's High Life back home in San Jose.  Ever since then I've been trying different BBQ.  In my search I came upon Joe's.  My daughter and I went there one Sunday evening around 5:30pm and the place was hoppin!  There was a long line but it moved quickly. The smell of pecan wood filled the air and all around us families sat at tables devouring pulled pork, ribs, and brisket.  It looked yummy.  It's a bit like a cafeteria in that you stand in line, get your tray, silverware and drink and then approach the food to tell the person behind the counter what you would like.  I have a half rack of ribs with a baked potato the size of both my fists!!!  It was HUGE but it was probably the best baked potato I have had in years.  And the ribs were delicious.  The sauce was sweet and gave a nice accent to the meat.  The meat fell off the bone.  My daughter had a pulled pork sandwich and I took a bite......it was yummy too.  Everything is fresh and tasty!!  One of my favorite things about Joe's is their home made root beer.  I don't know of any other place that serves home made root beer.  This was the bomb!!!  I could have drank a gallon of it!!  

Joe's is the real deal.  It's a great family friendly place.  The night I was there it was packed with families chowing down on some good BBQ.  And I got the feeling these were not first time visiters, it felt like everyone there was having a good time and getting a good meal.  It felt like home."}
{"text":"Cafeteria style with a pick-up window to the side for take-away. We had Brisket sandwiches, which were just o.k. Mine was about 75% fat.My wife's was a little better. A little pricey for the lacking flavor, but the homemade root beer is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Its Joes!  Everyone knows its awesome.  Always has been.  I dont frequent as much as I should thats for sure.  Only finally getting around to this review as I just recently joined Yelp"}
{"text":"Have you ever been a vegetarian stuck with meat-eating relatives that don't care if you starve to death?  I have.

Those relatives forced me to eat at Joe's Real Barbecue after a long day of \"sightseeing\" in the East valley.  Does Tempe Town Lake really qualify as sightseeing?? It's not even a real lake!

We were all very hungry, and I guess the thought of barbecue trumped any reservations I had about not being able to find anything on the menu I could eat.  

Just like I figured, Joe's didn't have any main entree items I could eat.  They did, however, have giant baked potatoes and macaroni and cheese on the menu.  I had ordered those, and enjoyed an amazing root beer (is that stuff homemade or something??) and this perfect brownie for dessert.  

Just goes to show that you don't have to eat \"real\" barbecue to enjoy Joe's.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Good place in Gilbert to get quality fast food. 

I ordered up the pulled BBQ pork sandwich and a healthy side of pork and beans $7.50 plus a small drink total $10.50. Took less than 5 minutes to order, pay up and receive my food through a street vending window."}
{"text":"i dream about their BBQ sauce.

im serious, straight into the viens please! damn, really my mouth is salavating while I am writing this. My favorite here is the baked potato and when im feeling really hungry I will have them top it with pulled pork. My fiance always gets the sampler platter which is a good amount of meat for what you pay for. expect a line everytime but there is always seating. the only downfall is there is no alcohol only soft drinks. It is a Gilbert staple and I recommend to anyone who is on the east side."}
{"text":"On a good day with the wind blowing from the South East I can smell the meat smoking all the way in North Phoenix..... 

Ok, only in my head I can.  Every time I find my self remotely close to Joe's I have to stop in for some meat, rootbeer, and any one of the amazing side dishes.  

Great Staff
Great Food
Great Atmosphere"}
{"text":"We ordered a sampler and voted that pulled pork and pork ribs are indeed tasty and delicious. The home made Root beer was an added perks, we like it very much too.
This restaurant started in 1998. After more than 10 years in the business still they have maintain the food quality and the cleanliness of this place. It's definitely one of the places in the valley that we would visit when we crave for BBQ.
I am so impressed with the review from some organization so I decided to take a photo. You'll be the judge."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife on a recommendation from an employee I saw wearing his work t-shirt. 

When we got there, the line was to the door. So, we ended up waitijng about 30 minutes to get to the order line. The staff was very friendly and polite. The place was pretty clean, considering the amount of traffic coming through. So, we finally got to place our order...

We order a sampler plate, stuffed baked potato with chicken, cole slaw, sweet corn, corn bread, bottle of Coke and a fountain drink. The sampler plate was very good, except for the brisket. It had way to much fat on it, but the other meats were good. The baked potato was the best thing we ordered. It was delicious! I covered in their spicy BBQ sauce and I couldn't stop eating it. Yes, it was that good. The cole slaw needs some work, I've eaten some good slaw and some tasteless slaw. But, this goes in the tasteless column.  The sweet corn was very good and smothered in butter. Corn bread was also disappointing, was to dry and bland. And last but not least, the drinks. I tried the pure cane sugar natural sodas and was disappointed again. They just don't taste right, compared to the regular fountain drinks.

I gave the place an overall review of 4 out of 5 stars. That baked potato and BBQ sauce were that good. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"We used to go here often when my girls were young. I love that they can enjoy their dinner and have a place to burn their energy. It's super family friendly and I love that. But I think I tired myself out from this place. I love their pulled pork BBQ, Their Mac N Cheese is delish along with their BBQ pit beans and don't forget, their lemon cake - it's too die for!!! If we have a big corporate meeting, I'm always pushing for this place for us to have catered."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and left full and happy. We had the sampler plate, jumbo potato with pulled pork, and apple crisp a la mode for dessert. Loved everything. This will be a new go-to for us."}
{"text":"This is a standby for treating visitors to a glimpse of life in the East Valley, situated in that downtown stretch of Gilbert, the panoramic mural, the tractor, and the massive portions of absolutely amazing barbecue.  Oh so tasty.  The beef brisket and pulled pork are the best."}
{"text":"Joe's Real BBQ is a great stop for all things bbq. Food is fresh and quick. The restaurant has that country sort of ambiance to it as well."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town. Next question.
No seriously. Don't bother with the sandwiches, just order any of the meat plates (they come with bread) and grab some pickled onions and pickle for on top and thank me later.
Also, I'm not a fan of soda but the home-made root-beer is amazing!"}
{"text":"Always been a fan, but in the past year I feel they have lost their luster.  The service went from over the top to good.   The last few time I have noticed the meats are dry ( I always get the sampler). The sides have also fizzled and seem bland.  Hopefully with all the new restaurants moving in they step it up."}
{"text":"Love this place. Went on a really awful date here, but the food made the whole experience worth it! Mac and cheese, corn, beans, pulled pork, it's all incredible."}
{"text":"Bonanza of Boo-Ya BBQ

A friend had recommended Joe's as a BBQ staple in the Valley for years. We swung by after the Peach Fest. Nice place and the food was super yums!

Joe's is in a brick storefront in a hopping part of Gilbert's downtown, across the street from Postino, cater-cornered from Liberty Market and The Farmhouse, and down the street from Oregano's and LoLo's. 

My wife, kids, and I had a mix of food-- Sampler Plate, Half-Slab, and Kid's Sandwich Meal. All received positive reviews. As with any BBQ place, it's really about the meat. It's good stuff with a smoky flavor, tasty charring, and oh so tender. All passed the falls-off-the-bone test. The BBQ sauces are warm and are good, though a they are a tad sweet for my tastes. If you're the same, the spicy BBQ sauce option balances the sweetness some. Potato salad and coleslaw were also good. 

Definitely a go-to place for your BBQ list. That said, I was told this place can get crazy busy. We apparently hit it at the right time because a fairly long line developed as we were eating."}
{"text":"Looove this place... I swear I could eat this food every night.  I live right nearby and it's so nice to have a walk up window for take-out and the food comes out very fast.  I usually order a meat plate with 2 sides- Brisket or pulled pork, mac and cheese and apple sauce.  I have tried other items and have never been disappointed.  Favorite BBQ place for take out.  Not too big on dining in since you walk up to order your food."}
{"text":"Hello all you foodies out there :)

Today I will give you our opinion of JOES BBQ.

And I do realize food is a preference and I am a very picky person.

I realize Joes has its local following, however from a girl who has tried many of the BBQ joynts here in the greater Phoenix area I have to say.... I DONT GET IT?

I was being fair in trying Joes twice.....just to make sure it wasent an off day.

We first went to Joes pick up window a few weeks ago and tried a slab of ribs and a combo plate with chicken, ribs and some bbq beef and bbq pork.

I enjoy some good \"fall off the bone\" ribs but what I got was a slab of \"pry off the bone\" ribs.

I must say the bbq sauce was ok but the meat was tough and chewy and I was extremely dissapointed.

On the combo place the chicken was dry as were the meats.

I would like to compliment the MAC and CHEESE which is better than most and the BBQ BEANS were also tasty.

I called  Joes to ask if I could bring back the ribs, of which I ate 2 bones, and get our money back and I was transfered to a very friendly manager who talked me into letting her send us a gift card so we can try again.

She insisted their ribs are normally \"fall off the bone\".

I told her I would prefer to bring back the food so she can see for herself what we spent good money on, but she talked me into trying again.

Ok, so here it is a few weeks later and we happen to be on Gilbert Rd and decided to  try again.

We got a 1/4 pd bbq beef sandwich and a 1/3 pd bbq pork sandwich.

The order taker gave a choice of sliced pork or chopped of which I prefer chopped.

When we got home what we had was a bun and in a seperate styrofoam container a slop of what I am assuming was the bbq beef that looked disgusting and tasted equally as disgusting.

NO bbq sauce on the side!

The bbq pork was plain, dry,  big hard hunks of pork and only one small side of bbq sauce, not nearly enough to wet the pork or even cover the pork.

Both sandwiches were thrown away... 

For dinner we ate mac and cheese and a small side of bbq beans.

So now I have to ask again.....PEOPLE..... PLEASE get in your car and drive into Phoenix to BOBBY Q's BBQ and give their food a try.

I realize we all want a good place close to home but Joe's simply doesn't do it for us.

Luckily the gift card we received is also good at JOES farmhouse grill...which is a fun place to visit, otherwise we would have sent the card back with a \"thanks...but no thanks.... even free it's not worth it!

We would rather drive 1/2 hour to BOBBY Q's and enjoy some real good BBQ.

You can look back at my review of BOBBY Q's.  

We went there many times and have NEVER been dissapointed and I am a TOUGH critic!

I would suggest if you decide to eat at Joe's, try the root beer...it is quite good!

If you enjoy corn bread..... dont eat it here...it is $2.29 for a small square of thin corn bread.  The taste is ok, but not at all worth the price.

And so I repeat.... I DONT GET IT!  nor do I like it! Nor will be back or recommend  Joe's to anyone.

This is just 2 peoples opinion, but as I always suggest.... give it a try and see what you think, and before you make a decision...try BOBBY Q's and compare.

And until you do......

Bon Appetite'"}

Four Girls, big appetites. We bought all this food and it only came out to $38.95, so that's less than $10 a person!

We came at the right time - 20 mins after we placed our order the line extended outside the door. The employee Matt was super nice too. They usually don't have waiters since you order your food and then sit down, but he was super nice to us and even got us drinks. 

The area is in downtown Gilbert - such a cute little neighborhood. I will be coming back!

This is one of the Phoenix Area bests!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ food I've had- fresh corn bread, happy employees, and the best food in town!!!"}
{"text":"Downtown Gilbert. Head to Joe's Real BBQ. We had the sampler platter plenty to enjoy. Even enough to share. Enjoyed a baked potato."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ in the East Valley.  Joe's is a must if you have guests coming to town.  It never disappoints.  If we go to another BBQ Restaurant we always say why didn't we go to Joe's.  It is consistent and they have the best BBQ Beans I have ever had.  Their pulled pork is amazing, smoky and juicy and never greasy.

The brisket is always lean and flavorful.  Never worry about the line.  It is so worth it!  I promise you!"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I have ever found. I would have given the food alone 5 stars. But the wait is really inconvenient, I'm not really interested in sitting at the same table as a bunch of strangers, and the price of the food is up there."}
{"text":"Wow what a wonderful BBQ place with patio seating and fantastic BBQ for those with a hearty appetite for a taste of the best BBQ in Gilbert"}
{"text":"(with apologies to Jerry Maguire):

\"I love Joe's! I love Joe's for the perfect BBQ restaurant it wants to be. And I love it for the perfect restaurant it almost is.\""}
{"text":"This was our third time here and once again left very satisfied! So far, everything from the smoked turkey to the racks of ribs have been great. The brisket isn't too salty and the chicken is just right. Sometimes you may need to sacrifice a member or two of your party to save seats while others order for them, but it just adds to the charm. It's true cafeteria style for both ordering and seating so arrive with a plan. It really is great food with great prices."}
{"text":"Joe's does not disappoint. GET THE BRISKET. These guys know what they are doing. Ask a Texan. That would be me and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and the homemade root beer is not to be missed! Plus I love the fact that they give away free food to the community once or twice a year - even my pickiest eater, my nine-year-old son, ate some of their barbecue last time we got free sandwiches :-)"}
{"text":"Was not a big fan at first...hate their cornbread and their sides don't do much for me. Then, I tried their pulled pork sandwich and saw the light. Thought that was great until I tried their baked potato with chopped brisket--even better. Good BBQ sauce....I prefer the mild, but the kids go for the spicy. Pump out as much as you like! We enjoy the noisy, family-friendly atmosphere. Nice outdoor area with picnic tables. Have a friend who swears by their salad dressing, but who in their right mind goes to a BBQ joint and orders salad? My husband has had work lunches catered for his crew and they love it! Love the lemonade cake. It looked like they added new desserts but I stuck with my tried and true. My family and friends always go on our respective birthdays for the free meal. Have even had to fly out pulled pork sandwiches for my dad so I'm excited that they are opening (opened?) a location at Phoenix Sky Harbor airport. They supposedly have terrific \"homemade\" root beer but I cannot comment because that gives me hiccups for days and I'm not chancing it. Even if the line is out the door you will get served pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Joe's Real BBQ is a great!
Agreed, the menu options are not vast, but the choices they do provide are spectacular! 
The prices are affordable, I was hesitant at first thinking the extra side here and there would make the meal costly, but two of us were beyond content with about $15 a person. This of course was with dessert, can't skip that :) 
I recommend the pulled pork and the lemon cake or pecan brownie for dessert.
Just a suggestion, the brownie would be GREAT with some bourbon! 

Check Joe's REAL BBQ out for a nice atmosphere and delicious food!"}
{"text":"I am a southerner so when it comes to bbq I have had the full gamut. Mustard, Vinegar, Ketchup based yep tried them all. I have ate at BBQ joints all over the US due to my travels and don't do to shabby with my smoker in my own back yard either. Lets just say when I saw rave reviews about a BBQ joint in AZ I was skeptical. 

Things I knew before going in without reading a review
1. Tea would not be sweet
2. The beans would probably have pintoes in them

Well guess what the tea was not sweet and I think there were pintoes in their beans but I ate them too fast to really verify due to the awesomeness. 

I really like the feel of this place its not in the country but it feels like it should be. The atmosphere is not trying to be fancy its triyng to be welcoming and non threatening which basically say's \"you're here for the food not fancy seating or servers not get in line and get some que\" Which to me is what a good bbq place is about. The cafeteria line may be off putting to snobs who feel too refined to wait in a cafeteria line but who cares about those people anyway. I have dined at my share of places with michelin stars and the like but I know good que does not require that kind of pomp.

So now that I am done bashing on people who feel to fancy for this place lets get down to why I have 5 little stars glowing up there....THE FOOD

So my menu selection was as follows I elected for the 3/4 lb meat plate which included 2 ribs, a chicken breast, some pulled pork and sliced brisket. I also had the beans and the slaw.

Joe's has a sauce and condiment bar which includes the full spectrum of toppings for sandwiches and two pots of sauce. One is their regular sauce the other is the hot bbq sauce. I love spicy food but I also like to sample the fare so i got a little tub of each.

The pork.....wow tender, flavor packed, juicy, and just soaked up the sauce and punched me with flavor. 

The brisket again tender, smoky, rich, juicy, and delicious...are we seeing a theme here?

The ribs although not as meat packed as I have seen the flavor was awesome. Succulent, sweet, smoky, and mouth watering are the adjectives I am left with. 

I haven't ate the chicken yet due to full stomach but I have no doubt it will fall in line with the other meats I partook.

Both sauces were great and my love of spice and heat prevailed as my little tub of hot was empty while my regular still half full. These meats don't need sauce but boy is the sauce good. 

The beans were amazing its a variety of beans in there and the flavor and depth is awesome. Lots of shredded meat hiding in there as well and lots of flavor exploding in my mouth as well. 

The slaw was good fresh and slightly sweet not the best I have ever had but definitely very good and still deserving of 5 star ratings.

The long and short is the food is good, the service is great, and the place is well worth a visit."}
{"text":"I didn't read any reviews prior to going so I didn't know what to expect.  For some reason I thought it was going to be a fancy sit down restaurant.

It was still very good.  Similar to Rudy's, you get in  line to order and pay for food.  

Now that I know where the extra sauce is, next time I'll add some to my pulled pork.

The chocolate cookies are awesome!  Must have."}
{"text":"Went here to day with my family. We had planned this trip for about a week and i hoped it was going to be good as I was craving good BBQ. I was not disappointed. Its definitely an odd place since its set up like a cafeteria.  But not to had to figure out. We went up and got our trays and cups. We had the homemade sodas. My husband and daughter both got the orange cream soda and i got the root beer because i had read about it being good. I went back and got orange. That stuff is amazing!  The root beer is good too but that orange soda just won over. My husband said he wanted it delivered to our home by the gallons. He and I both got the sampler plate, which came with brisket, pullet pork, ribs and chicken. All the meats were good although the chicken may have been a little dry. I got pit beans and cole slaw and he got the cheesy potatoes and slaw. I loved the beans but those potatoes. Yum next time i just want the potatoes. The slaw was kind of bland with not as much dressing as I'd like but still good. Daughter got the kid's sandwich with chicken and cheesy potatoes and she liked it okay. Overall, we enjoyed our meal and I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Went on a food tour of Gilbert and Joe's was our first stop. We got a side of beans and a pulled pork slider. Both were incredible! We topped it off with refreshing hommemade root beer and orange cream soda. The orange cream was very good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the full rack of ribs here, and the massive baked potato. They offer several different BBQ sauces, a few interesting micro-brew sodas. They also have indoor and patio seating (picnic tables), and a great location in downtown Gilbert. Overall - well worth the drive!

*Avoid the dinner rush from around 6:30-7:30pm unless you want to wait in line for an hour."}
{"text":"Our favorite barbecue place in the East Valley. Their brisket is absolutely delicious and their cinnamon honey butter with cornbread is yummy enough to be dessert. Though they also have great desserts as well. Our kids also love their root beer."}
{"text":"Had the chopped beef brisket with mac and cheese and the baked beans! Excellent meal!! Root beer is a must have!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, food is lacking. I got the sampler platter and all the meats were greasy. It seemed like it had all been sitting for a while which is unfortunate. Can't help but feel it's gone down in food quality the past few times I've gone."}
{"text":"A Gilbert staple. One of those places where you KNOW it will be good. Can't find the consistency anymore that this place offers in food and service."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of the BBQ sauce here, however, the meats are smoked well. The sides are great, too. I like the cafeteria style ordering and the restaurant's interior."}
{"text":"My cousin had his rehearsal dinner for his wedding here, so the experience was a bit different than most. Food was served buffet-style, and we at around picnic tables. Pretty good selection for a large group. As is with pretty much every BBQ place, very unpretentious. The service was there when you needed, and faded into the background otherwise.

Initially, I was kind of excited about their home made root beer, but to be honest, I was a bit underwhelmed. I've had some special root beers in the past, and Joe's lacked some of the funkier notes that I've enjoyed in the past. The whole thing was kind of one-note and unimpressive.

On to the BBQ, the star of the show was the brisket. Even with it being family style, it remained moist and flavorful. Unfortunately though, the same thing couldn't be said for the ribs or the pulled pork. They were fine, but nothing that I'd actively want to order again. As far as the sides go the mac and cheese was pretty good, as was the coleslaw.

Joe's seems like a good place to take family that might not be BBQ connoisseurs but just want to hang out and have a fun meal."}
{"text":"Disappointed.. heard so much about Joe's Real BBQ but it really didnt meet its expected reputation of fine BBQ eating. Far from it. Our BBQ was actually dry. The special homemade ice tea was terrible very bitter. The long wait in line was definitely not worth it. After being in line for 30 min and being rushed thru cafe style ordering process,  the food was a disappointing average at best.. Eating indoors or outdoors is not very comfortable in either case. Indoors there is always a long line down the middle of the indoor eating area. Very hectic and noisey always. Outside is hard picnic tables which are very uncomfortable. We wont be back. Very overrated and pricey."}
{"text":"So usually I will rave about how delicious Joes is but unfortunately not tonight. Apparently 3 times a charm is the motto tonight as I had to return 3 times to get everything on my order that I placed to pick up. Very disappointing customer service."}
{"text":"I've been going to Joe's for a few years now.  I'm out in Gilbert once a week, so I always make it a point to go there.  Everyone is very friendly and the atmosphere is great.  It feels like a sit-down place, from the seating to the fact that they bus your table (that took a lot of getting used to at first).  

Anyway, they smoke their meats with pecan wood and it really does add a flavor that you don't get in other establishments.  I'm a brisket person, so I usually order a jumbo sandwich (1/3 pound) with sliced brisket, and sides of mac and cheese and corn.  Sometimes, I'll get a slice of lemon cake.  It's always good, though sometimes the meat is a little better than others.  Very consistent, but there can be those times when it seems a bit dry, etc.  It's not often, though.

For drinks, they have all sorts of bottled sodas and a good fountain that also has their own root beer.  I had it once just to try and taste the difference, but I prefer having an Arnold Palmer, so I go with that.

I really do enjoy the place.  The only negatives in my mind are that they don't have corn on the cob and that the place is always so busy!  I've been lucky recently in that I've been missing the lunch rush.  They get through the line quick, though.

I go every week and will continue to do so when in the area."}
{"text":"I have yet to have a bad meal at Joe's. The meat is flavorful and tender; the sides are appetizing and cravable.

We have had Joe's cater a number of events and the food always gets complements. Once or twice they have forgotten an item, but if you let them know, they are apologetic and try to make it right with a gift card."}
{"text":"Since 2000 I have been making trips to this joint.  They haven't  changed much except for the decor.  

The staff is busy and strait to the point, because we have some serious BBQ going on back here.  Which is totally cool with me as long as I get my pulled pork with joes famous BBQ sauce were all good.  Located in historic downtown Gilbert across the street from hale theater.

I'm not sure if they still have it but if you show up on your b-day your meal is on the house.  When you walk up in line with that wonderful aroma coursing thru the air, your beverages await you in two horse troughs and up on the wall.  The menu is very simple just pick based on your desire for awesomeness to overfill your stomach. 

My choices for every visit would have to be the pulled pork sandwich.  My favorite side would have to be the cheezy potatoes then the ranch beans.  I've try'd both BBQ sauces but I always lean a bit more towards something sweet like joes famous sauce.

This establishment has never let my stomach down and in another 16 years I don't think it will.  Please make a visit in if your ever around  the Gilbert area of Phoenix az you won't be disappointed non the least."}
{"text":"So good!!we loved the atmosphere, had some character. The food is delicious. Definitely get the mac & cheese!! Their cornbread is good too. Also, they have some kind of jalapeño bread. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Long line, great BBQ.  I love this place. It's definitely worth the wait and always nice to support good, local restaurants.  Their BBQ was well cooked and had a nice mild smoke ( pecan??).  Their sides were tasty and filling.  I recommend a root beer float or a slice of the sweet potato pie for dessert."}
{"text":"food was decent... nothing fancy but was good.... was little shocked when the lady serving the food didn't hear me correctly and put beans on my tray instead of potatoes I asked her politely to correct it which she did but she had me hand the beans back (came on small bowl) and she just poured them back into the main pan that she scooped them from originally which to me seems like a hygiene issue so curious how often they do this practice...."}
{"text":"DEEEE-FUCKING-DILOOOOUUUUSH!!!!! LOL.  Been here at least eight or nine times now. Think I would have given it a 5 star rating every single time. The chopped brisket with BBQ sauce is amazing, the best being some of the best I've ever had. The only thing I would beg of the owners is to change their set up for getting a refill on your drink lol"}
{"text":"I frequent the Joe's in Gilbert. The one at the airport was not even in the same universe as the original. The macaroni was stale (at lunch time.) The chicken was rubbery and the bun looked like a McDonald's bun. I ate about a quarter of this and left the rest. 

After having hundreds of great meals in old town Gilbert, I am saddened that the airport location didn't even remotely stack up. Waste of $11."}
{"text":"Love Joe's--we are long time diners and always leave full and happy! Great location in awesome downtown Gilbert. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Love this place if you are in the mood for some BBQ! All I can say is try it all! I always get the stuffed baker with either chicken, pork, or sausage links! Add some corn on the side and you have yourself a great meal!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is outside the security check point. Recommend Brisket and mac&cheese."}
{"text":"Can't believe I forgot to review this place. Went a few weeks ago for a birthday dinner. Ordered the sampler plate with beans and cheese potatoes. The potatoes were so-so, as was the corn bread but the meat and beans were both outstanding. The way the line to order food is set up, it's kind of problematic if you need refills or even to get out of your booth, but they're limited on space so I imagine there aren't too many ways to fix this. Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"After being a llloonngg time fan of Joe's Farmhouse Grill we finally made it over to Joe's Real BBQ.  We were intimidated by the llllloooonnnggg line we had to stand in (about 40 people deep) but it really only took about 10-15 minutes to go all the way through.  

You should figure out what you want before getting into line.  Once you get up closer you'll need to grab your trays (as many as you'll need), your cups, napkins and utensils.  You'll fill up your drinks 1st, order all your food items from the 1st person you see behind the counter and then pay.

Hubby had the brewed root beer (YUMM!) and daughter had the homemade lemonade (equally YUMM!).

We were able to order quite a few different things as we had so many kids with us that day.  I was able to try the ham (it was dry), the roasted chicken (smokey and moist - delish!) on their chopped salad (the dressing is super good) and the sliced beef brisket (yummmmmy).  The sides were all wonderful - the coleslaw and beans were A++ with the mac n' cheese, and corn a solid A.

The kids meals came with homemade, warm, soft chocolate chip cookies.  They were very, very happy.

Cant wait to go back - I've been craving it ever since!

I've been warned to never try the Root Beer Cake or I will be doomed to a lifetime of craving it and always needing to order it at every visit."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place off the cuff. I was in downtown Gilbert on a mission, which is another story in itself. I spotted this restaurant on the corner street and it seemed like a lot of people were coming and going, so it must be good, right?

The décor inside is nothing special, Ok, except when I went to sit at a booth. I felt like I was sitting much too low to the table top, uncomfortable to try to eat. So I changed to a table and the chair to table height was normal.

I ordered shredded pork sandwich with the fixins. The food was good, not great, the price was OK. I suppose the best part was the décor and friendly staff. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"So me and my wife went here on Sunday and spent $40 on food only to find out that the chicken we had gotten tasted so horrible like it had chemicals on it or it was old chicken it upset our stomachs we told a guy who was cleaning off the plates that they chicken tasted awful and he didn't make eye contact or even address me just said oh ok and continued about his business no apology or anything so me and my wife got up and left never coming back to this place again!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have a confession: For some reason, early on, I wasn't that big a fan of Joe's. We're talking years ago, when I was much younger and the dry-cooked/add-sauce thing didn't appeal to me. How foolish I was.

I absolutely love Joe's. Everything you can order here has so much flavor that you really can do no wrong. The sauce is fantastic, the ribs are delicious and very meaty, and the chicken is delightful.

The staff is friendly and food comes up fast, since it's largely cafeteria-style, with a walk-up window for quick takeaway. 

The macaroni and cheese is a must-have, and the buttered corn is great too, and if you're feeling like an insane weight upon your stomach and soul, the jumbo baker will do you in.

While Joe's is tip-top in almost every way, I've stumbled upon in the last 3 hours of a weekday only to find them out of either or both of my favorites: the ribs and chicken. I understand that everything BBQ, when done right, takes some serious time, and thus planning your supply for the late evening is tricky, but nothing breaks my heart more than rolling up to find they're out of my favorites, especially since it's a bit of a drive for me now. (I've taken to calling ahead.)

Secondly, I've always felt that it's about a buck or two too expensive. It's a small detail, but a 2-meat, 2-side meal will set you back nearly $12, though that includes their bread and enough food to send you packing.

The staff is friendly and helpful and the food is prepared with exceptional care to be absolutely delicious. My very favorite (beef) ribs are at Mining Camp in Apache Junction, but for fantastic (pork) ribs somewhere in the vicinity of society, Joe's is great.

(They also make up part of the \"birthday trifecta\" of Joe's restaurants--head to here, Liberty Market, or Joe's Farm Grill for a free meal on your birthday. And yes, they encourage you to complete the trifecta and hit all three.)"}
{"text":"Wish the star system went higher.  I LOVE this place.  We bring all of our out of town guests here.  This is serious barbeque.  Our 7 yr old eats an entire rack of ribs by himself.  We have to fight to get even one away from him.  Joe's makes their own rootbeer and lemonade and their lemon cake is to die for. This is real food, come hungry."}
{"text":"This is a hometown favorite.  I stopped in this evening for simple BBQ sandwich but made it a bit \"hotter\" with some of their habenaro sauce.  Love this super casual family restaurant."}
{"text":"Simply Amazing BBQ.  My Wife and I shared the BBQ Platter with our two young boys and we all were satisfied and loved the flavor for under $15.  And I had a cup of great coffee in that price.  Will certainly come back when we are in Gilbert."}
{"text":"We've been fans since Joe's opened. Best BBQ in the valley. Pecan-smoked meats are sweet and succulent. Hungry first-timers should check out the Sampler Platter. If you're lucky enough to arrive on a rare day when they have their rib-tip sandwich available, be sure to check it out. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"If this was REAL BBQ I would never eat BBQ. 

I ordered a pound of Brisket to eat there. Got a plate of what looked like a mish mash of chopped and sliced brisket. Very dry and had little to no seasoning at all. Ended up taking it back to the counter and asking for our money back.

Head up the street and got some real Brisket. I gave it a try, oh well.

If you want good Brisket folks, don't go here. You go to Rynos, Pork Shop or even Porkopolis but you don't go here."}
{"text":"I love this place so much, it hurts. I've been going since it opened way back in the day when I was in high school living in Gilbert. This is not really a review, but more of a request to Joe, whom usually reads these posts. 

Keep the Hot Wings on the menu permanently! I got them once before after the 12Ks of Christmas in 2009 and again, last night. I heard on Twitter from BBQ delivery guy that Joe's was taking hot wing orders for the big game on Sunday and I was hoping they would be a special on the menu. So I had to stop by and hopefully get some wings, again.

These are officially my second favorite item on the menu, behind the ribs, but slightly above the pulled pork. Please, please, please put these on full time!"}
{"text":"This place gets really busy even on a Thursday night.  The line was out the door. We decided to do the to-go route, and seat outside so the kids can run around.  It was my Sister's B-Day, which got a free meal ($12.00 value.) anything off the menu.   

BBQ ribs were tender and tasty.
Hot Link Sausage Must have!
Chicken Breast - Save money and order more ribs!
Cheesy Potatoes - YUM!
Turkey Jalapeno Sausage - Not recommended - save your money and order more Hot Links Sausages. 

Unlimited sauces!!!!"}
{"text":"Way good. BBQ sauce is a+. Don't let the ordering method (think cafeteria) scare you."}
{"text":"I attended the 2008 Christmas party of SYNERGY HomeCare of the East Valley and was introduced to the wonderful food from Joe's. Since then we've been back for take-out and have started a long-term relationship with this real BBQ. Oh so good, and that pecan-wood smoky flavor! We particularly love the chicken breast and turkey barbeque. It's well worth the extra drive to Gilbert, and the take-out window is a lot quicker than the line inside. Joe's Real BBQ is one of the top 5 'must visit' restaurants in the area. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ. Only problems are they have the drink refill stations in a very inconvenient place and the prices are pretty high."}
{"text":"Expecting to be knocked off our socks and unfortunately Joe's was dry and bland. I'm so confused as to why the line is out the door?!"}
{"text":"Good food, but sides were just warm, as they sit out as you order. Potato loaded was really good with a side of sweet corn on it."}
{"text":"Well you hear so much about Joe's BBQ from East Valley people it was inevitable that I would end up there.  So we went for a friend's birthday.  A Tuesday night around 730.  It wasn't crazy-busy but it was pretty well packed.  That was a good sign.

So you walk up like in some cafeteria and stand in line.  The first thing you hit is the soda stand.  Do you know why EVERY CAFETERIA IN THE WORLD has the soda stand after the food???  Because it creates a bottleneck of three different kinds of people: 1)the people who don't know what they want to drink and dick around for 5 minutes, 2)the people who already ate and are getting a refill and just cutting through the line, & 3)those of us who know what we want and just want to get through the line.  This whole thing was just stupid.

Then you get to the food pass where you tell the guy what you want.  None of the food has labels so if you are wondering if the lemon cake is actually lemon cake or if it is corn bread - you'll have to ask.  Usually by the time you get to the register, they have your food ready.  You pay and then you have to carry your tray full of food, plus a full drink, over to a condiment station.

Now the condiment station has things like pickles and other nonsense that goes with BBQ plus it has two giant tubs full of different sauces; one sweet, the other \"dangerously spicy.\"  There are literally warning signs on it...that's how hot they say it is.

So I tried the \"homemade\" root beer, pulled pork sandwich, side of beans, side of cornbread, some pickles, and the spicy sauce.  That's a good amount of food for the $12 or so I paid.  Not bad.

The root beer was okay.  It really didn't have a good flavor and was lacking that \"bite\" that most root beers have.  Not terrible but I'd rather them just have Barqs or something.

The pork was SO overcooked.  It looked like jerky it had been pulled out of the sauna.  On top of that, it was very fatty.  All of these things are usually negated with a decent sauce but, again, that's where Joe's fails.  All those warnings on the spicy sauce were pointless considering how weak the stuff was.  I've tasted brownies spicier than this stuff.  If you are looking for spice, go elsewhere. 

The beans, despite not looking like any baked beans I've ever had, were actually really good.  A nice thin, sweet sauce covered some perfectly tender beans.  I was very impressed.  The corn bread was also very good.  Light and fluffy.  I would have liked to see some actual corn in the bread and I also would like butter instead of margarine.  Finally, the pickles were okay.  I sort of expect bread & butter pickles with my bbq but I guess that's because I'm from Georgia.  These were dill.  They were okay, but not my style.

All in all, this place did some things well but others poorly.  That is really disappointing because I am always on the lookout for good BBQ.  This just wasn't one of those places."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork sandwich with the mac n cheese, chili and cornbread. I went on a Saturday at about 4:00 and not crowed at all, witch was nice. but the food was not fresh at all. the pulled pork was fine, al I could taste was bbq sauce, the mac n cheese was cold and had ,what I think, was crushed cheese-itz on it.the corn bread was also super dry, and the chili seemed to have cut up hotdogs in it, kinda strange to me."}
{"text":"Tried this place on my weekend trip to the area.  This place has the wow factor.  We pulled up Saturday night not knowing what to expect after seeing a line out the door and wrapped around the corner from the front entrance.  Got in line and saw the line reached some twenty yards to the service counter.  My nerves were settled as we got close enough to see cafeteria style serving vs. table serving was the call of the night.  Altogether the wait from start to finish couldn't have been more than twenty minutes and well worth it!
       I had the half slab of ribs (6) with mac and cheese, BBQ pit beans, potato salad, and root beer float.  The ribs were cooked just right and the combination of self serve sauce was excellent.  Don't be afraid of the spicy sauce as the label is scarier than the actual kick of the sauce.  Beans were awesome and included meat in the beans to extract full flavor.  The mac and cheese as well as the potato salad did not disappoint as they were tasty.  My party of 8 who had tried this place for the first time were all pleased with not only the food but the prices.  This is the best BBQ for the price I've ever had.
        The people of Gilbert and surrounding area are very fortunate to have an eating establishment like this.  I live in Sacramento, California and I will be back for more when I come to Arizona.  Finally something to rant and rave about in this area for dining!"}
{"text":"Excellent!! Good food, good service, and a wonderful atmosphere. If your looking for good BBQ this is the place to go. They fill up fast around dinner time, especially during the weekend, so I suggest if you want to try this place out for the first time to show up earlier in the day on the weekend or go during the week day. The lines get long, but they do move quickly. Don't let the line freak you out. When you get up to the area where you order the food, it does look a little like the elementary lunch lady setting, but dont let that fool you, the food is really good.  My suggestion on food for the first timers are either the ribs or the pulled pork, he root bear is amazing for the drink (their specialty), and any side you choose will be delicious (my favorite is the cornbread)."}
{"text":"Expected a bit more after the reviews, unfortunately I left dissatisfied.  

My co-worker and I had high hopes and stockpiled food accordingly.. we got a couple 2 meat plates, soda's (no beer here!!), a couple sides and added on a couple ribs as we expected them to be amazing. 

The meat wasn't anything outstanding.  It had a nice smoke ring on most, but lacked the flavor needed.  They need to put some more rub or baste accordingly, because all meat was very much lacking. 

Brisket - tender, but possessed minimal bark and flavor.  Good consistency. 
Pork - adequate taste in some bites, but overall lacking anything special. 
Ribs - cooked very well, had a little tug on them as opposed to falling off the bone. But again, missing flavor. 

Mac n Cheese - the shining star... It was great!! Had a crusty topping of goldfish or something similar.  
Housemade Rootbeer - not very good and I really enjoy rootbeer.  Just way too sweet for me.  

Bbq Sauce - it was ok.  I've had better and worst.. the spicy had a nice kick to it.. I slathered it on nearly everything to flavor it up.  

Wish I would have went somewhere else.. but its all about giving places a shot."}
{"text":"We went here expecting great things.  The portions are very small, and the side dishes are mediocre at best.  I had brisket and ham.  Both were very dry.  My wife had pulled pork which was very good.  Very pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Service is great. Just don't care too much for their food. Everyone has their own taste in good BBQ."}
{"text":"Tons of seating both indoors and outdoors.  Lots of room for kids to play outside on the grass.  Food is delicious and decent priced.  I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a good spot to take friends and family for BBQ lunch or dinner in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have eaten.  You folks in the Phoenix area have a real gem here.

This is tasty, straight-forward, home-cooked BBQ done to perfection.  If I had this place in NYC, I'd be living in it."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE me some Joe's real bbq!!  They have the best ribs in town and their bake beans are amazing!  There's little pieces of meat mixed in with the beans and it's sooo good.  Their mac and cheese is great as well as their corn.  Pretty much everything is great here.  

The first time I went here was when I first moved out to AZ back in 2006.  My fiance took me here because he knows I'm a bbq fanatic, and I swear I though to myself, \"What is this place?  A cafeteria?\".  I did not expect the food to be any good at all.  Well, was I too quick to judge!  Taught me never to judge a book by it's covers again!  Even though you get in line, pick up a tray, and order your food like you would to the lunch lady in HS, the food is the best.  They even have an outdoor seating area with trees and lights.  It makes you feel like you're at a nice park having a nice bbq.

Joe's is hands down my favorite bbq joint in the valley.  Nothing tops this.  Anything you order is amazing.

Oh, and try their chocolate chip cookie.  Soft and melty and so so good!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here often over the past couple of years. It offers reliably tasty, reasonably priced food. It's not the best barbecue I've ever had, but it's quite good. BBQ sauce is excellent. I wish the coleslaw were a little better; it's only mediocre, and I really like cold, creamy coleslaw to balance to heat and tang of good barbecue sauce.

The place is BUSY during the lunch and dinner rush; the line can stretch clear to the door (and even out it). It moves pretty quickly, so the wait isn't really the problem; instead, it's the social awkwardness of the arrangement. If you're unlucky enough to be seated at one of the table or booths by the line (which is most of the indoor seating, sadly), everyone standing in it will have a view of your plate and your table manners, though it's often too loud for them to hear your conversation (though if they are really loud, you might have to listen to theirs). Luckily there is seating outside--but during Arizona's LONG summers, it's just too hot to eat out there. The patio can be very pleasant the rest of the year, but in the summer, you should just try to arrive before or after other diners do."}
{"text":"This place is my usual go-to for a quick take out meal, but the last 2 times we've picked up to go it's been just awful. But don't be concerned because it's SO GOOD when you eat there! They're usually super nice and the food looks fresh so I have no idea what's going on with the take out window. Super sad about it though and will probably stick to just dining in, which is what I'd recommend for newbies"}
{"text":"Really really yummy food. My roommate and I went here today for lunch. There was no line when we went so maybe go during the week if the line other people talk about scares you. Friendly service and the were super excited to have red cream soda. I had the bbq sandwich with pulled pork and it had great flavor. Roommate had the jumbo sandwich with the pork and brisket and he liked the brisket a little more because it had a ton of sauce. Sides were good and I'm excited to go back!"}
{"text":"I love Joe's BBQ! You get large portions and they give you $10 credit towards your meal on your birthday. 
We used to always get the family deal, but my favorite is the baked potato loaded with meat! The mac n cheese and cheesy potatoes are definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Meat, corn, apple crisp, cornbread, you name it and it was delicious! Eat free on your birthday $10 off!"}
{"text":"Great food!! Service and employees were so nice and attentive! Highly recommend food was amazing! Had pulled pork and my husband had ribs.. Must try the potato too! I would highly recommend to anyone one the fence and looking for a cozy BBQ restaurant."}
{"text":"I have to say that my girlfriend hates BBQ food and we love going to Joe's BBQ. We probably go at least 3 or 4 times a year, at least. The Best BBQ around, everything is home made. I bring family and friends in and they absolutely love it as well. Keep up the good work Joe's BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ.  Make sure you eat there though, can dry out a bit when you take it home.  Much better dining In."}
{"text":"My hubby is a huge fan of a good bbq. Me on the other hand, well not so much.
His buddies from Ohio were in town and everyone suggested to come to Joe's for a bite and enjoy the patio weather. I have to say that the quality of bbq that comes from this location is delicious. Everyone raved on how great the rib plate was. I tried a little bit and extremely impressed on how flavorful it was. I am a big cheese fan and had their mac, cheesy potatoes, and their corn bread. This must be the best corn bread and soft butter I ever had.
From here on out, I will be returning to Joes."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with a co-worker! Great food and service is always fantastic. The manager makes it a point to walk by and ask how you are and if everything is ok. Still my favorite place in Downtown Gilbert! Going to be hard to beat this place."}
{"text":"This review is actually closer to a 2.5 but I bumped it up to 3 because of the friendly service.

The Boy wanted a loaded BBQ Baked Potato the other night so we decided to make the trek to Joe's.  We arrived at 6 PM on a Saturday night and were greeted by a 30 min line.  I was gruff about the wait but the lady in front of me assured me it was worth it.  I now do not trust the opinions of people I meet in lines.  Once I found out they do not serve booze, not even wine/beer, I was ready to mutiny and jump ship.  

The service is set up cafeteria style but can get pretty cramped, especially when people come back for refills on their drinks.  I ordered the Meat Plate with 2 meat choices, pit ham and sliced brisket with Mac and Cheese for a side.  The Boy got the Stuffed Baker with Chopped Brisket in Sauce and Mac and Cheese.  We also ordered a side of Corn Bread and Blueberry Bourbon Cheesecake.  I found the booze, they put it in the cheesecake.

The food itself was just ok.  You know you are in trouble when the Ham is the best tasting meat on your plate.  The brisket was dry and lacked flavor.  I didn't care for their BBQ sauce but they sauced my meat (ha ha) in the kitchen so I was stuck with it.  The bread is a jalapeno cheese so jalapeno haters beware!  The Boy said the potato was good and it was HUGE, but the chopped brisket was stringy in texture.  We were both very happy with the corn bread and cheesecake and would recommend ordering those.  The portion size on the sides was lacking.  The Boy's portion was almost double what I got and was dished up by the same employee.

The staff was very friendly and helpful, offering recommendations while we waited in line."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, I thought it was reasonably priced.  Two meat plus one side was plenty of food."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ here.  I wouldn't say it's \"the best\", but it's right up there.  It's family owned, which is a big plus for me.  They also have homemade root beer!  It's a little on the pricey side.... expect around $10/person.  Another plus is their BBQ sauce does not contain gluten."}
{"text":"First time I tried this place was based on the reviews i read online. I ordered the joes now tour plate with a side of Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was great, as far as the meat went, it didn't go so well. The chicken was very dry, the brisket had zero flavor. 
After leaving I felt sick to my stomach, turns out I got food poison from this place. ( I knew it was from this place because it was the last and only think I ate) I have never been so sick to my stomach, I will not come back to this place. 

Only positive review I had was the Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"Cafeteria style way of getting food kind of restaurant. The restaurant has a awesome atmosphere with the wall painted on one side to a tractor and gas pump on the other. The staff are great and are hard working showing a friendly smile. The food I had a lot. The sweet corn was good. The BBQ were really good having a nice flavor to it. The ribs were so good that as I was chewing on them the meat is coming off the bone clean. The blueberry cake was delicious and very good. This is a fantastic restaurant and Joe should be really proud of what he created. I know I am."}
{"text":"Consistently good. I've had almost everything on the menu.  I usually go for the stuffed baked potato. The mac n cheese and cheesy potatoes are pretty bland but nothing a little salt and pepper can't fix. It's good reliable bbq and I eat there once a month, but I it's not my favorite place in the valley. (Bobby Q's is my fave)"}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of the huge line I had to wait in to get food.  Must have taken about 30 minutes.  The Mac and Cheese was REALLY good.  Wish I had a whole bowl of that instead of just a little cup.  The pulled pork \"jumbo\" sandwich I had was all bread.  My first bite was pure bun- no meat.  I'm not a vegatarian, so that was a dissapointment.  The beans were really good though.  The homemade root beer really wasn't that great.  Next time I think I will know what to order- beans, mac and cheese and something other than pulled pork."}
{"text":"So I went here for customer appreciation day to try this BBQ for free!! This place was so busy, obviously due to free food. The line went really fast though, my friend and I waited only about 15 minutes and then got some bbq pork sandwiches with beans and coleslaw. So the sandwich was good, it probably could have had more sauce, but it was tasty. The beans were also very tasty. I'm not a coleslaw fan, and this was just par. I would definitely come here again and try something else, as the flavors were good. Also, it was very nice of them to do a free day, that's great. My friend said he thought the food was good, but the coleslaw was too wet. I don't know about that."}
{"text":"My family loves this place.  Being from Texas we are picky about our BBQ but since we are not in Texas any longer, Joe's is a great substitute.  Very close to Texas BBQ and we love the down home dining experience.  Almost feels like home...almost!  If you like BBQ and don't mind somewhat of a wait, it's worth the trip.  I usually split the sampler with one of my boys and it is plenty of food.  My wife says the ribs are excellent!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Joes after moving to Gilbert from Chandler and WOW I am glad I did! This is the REAL DEAL!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner before going to Aida. First time for all of us.  Everyone enjoyed their meal immensely. Brisket, pulled pork cheesy potatoes all good!!!!  I loved my baked potato with brisket. They also had homemade root beer. Brought back childhood memories of our homemade root beer.  Did not make my eyes water like my dad's did, but very tasty. I would recommend Joe's Real BBQ."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. Some of the best BBQ I've had in a long time. Drove over an hour to try this place based on the reviews. Worth the drive. My husband and I shared the BBQ sampler platter w/ mac & cheese and baked beans. The three meats were stellar, the sides were amazing. We ordered extra corn bread and it was well worth it. The only thing that was just so-so was the root-beer chocolate cake. It was a little dry and uneventful. Came for BBQ, left completely satisfied!!"}
{"text":"What can be added to what has already been said about Joe's? This place is an institution, and is about the best you can get of \"Arizona BBQ\".

So why just 4 stars? Because so many of us are from other places, myself included. This place is paid the highest compliment when people from Texas (myself), the midwest, and the south all give it decent marks. My Texan tastes are pleased with the brisket, the sausage (which doesn't hold a candle to the sausage found in Elgin, TX), and the ribs. The sauce is pretty good, and the sides are good for what they are. You can't really mess up potatoes or mac and cheese.

That cornbread nearly takes this to 5 stars, but I can't give it on principle. Still, Joe, you are darn good for making me consider it."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended and rightfully so. The staff is very helpful and nice and the food is amazing although, the wait is long and lines are quite inefficient.

Entree- BBQ Sampler
Substituted the pork for Turkey. The ribs were dry and full of loose bones, probably my least favorites of the meats. Turkey, chicken and brisket were great.

Side Dishes- Baked beans and Cornbread
The Beans are great a few different kinds mixed together giving it a great texture. The Cornbread was so moist and delicious, and the cinnamon butter spread was amazing!

Dessert- Apple Crisp
It was okay. More like Apple with breading on top than \"crisp\"."}
{"text":"This place is an all around good time. I love the decor in the restaurant and the food was excellent. I ordered the sampler plate with mac n cheese and baked beans. Sides were good, nothing to wow over but good. The ribs were most excellent. I loved them. Brisket was also delicious. Pulled pork was good. Chicken was ok, nothing to write home about. I will be going back and focusing on Ribs and Brisket. This is a place you need to try!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big BBQ fan, but I really enjoyed this place. The ribs were delicious. I loved the selection of sides. The prices were worth all the food we ordered. The desserts looked great  but we were full. Mac & cheese was awesome. Potatoes were awesome. I'd definitely go back when craving BBQ."}
{"text":"Delish! And such a friendly and helpful staff! Our party of 7 each ordered different items, and we all loved our food."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants. Their stuffed potatoes are the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Whenever I step out of the car before heading into Joe's, my senses are prepped for deliciousness by the smoky aromas lingering outside. The line is usually long but well worth it when you get to the front.
The food is good and filling, and the prices are great for the amount and quality of food that you get. I took my brother here for the first time the last time I went, and he was practically in heaven and couldn't wait to go back. I get the mac and cheese and the pulled pork sandwich pretty much every time. Unfortunately I'm never in town to go to Joe's on my birthday (damn you finals!), but I will definitely remember to treat my brother to a free meal  on his."}
{"text":"This place is great! Great food,great service and I approve of anywhere I can bring my kids and they can eat good food not just boring tenders or burgers!"}
{"text":"Solid BBQ...nice alternative to Rudy's. Not overly smokey, the pecan wood is very subtle. Pulled pork was my favorite in my two meat plate. The brisket was good, not great. I enjoyed the spicier ' I dare you sauce'. My friend had the stuffed baker with pulled pork which was positively massive!"}
{"text":"Joe's real barbeque is the place to be for your birthday. Our family always celebrate birthdays, because the birthday person always gets a free meal."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been here so many times and not once have we had a bad meal.  Food is great and at a decent price and the staff are always polite.  I'll continue to support this place for sure."}
{"text":"When my brother took us here I was not expecting much, cause hey coming from Texas, I was not expecting much from an Arizona BBQ joint.  But I was surprised in a good way by Joes.  The ribs were fall of the bone tender and had great flavor.  The mac and cheese ok, the bbq beans were amazing. I wish I would have got the cole slaw too, it looked good.  Wash it down with their homemade root beer or Barq's red cream soda for a good pre-diabetic episode :)  Don't get dessert--the sweet potato pie was made with a graham cracker crust---ugh."}
{"text":"We went for our date night and it was really casual. We ordered from the side to-go window and ate out on the picnic tables outside. The BBQ was the best we've had since we moved to Arizona from the south. Not the best we've ever had, but definitely a good choice here in Arizona. I must say that the beans were the greatest ever, so make sure to get that as a side dish."}
{"text":"My favorite place for BBQ. I prefer their pulled pork and dipping it into the awesome hot BBQ sauce. I keep a bottle at my house and use every time I BBQ at my place."}
{"text":"Excellent food, kind of a funky atmosphere but they keep the line moving. The homemade orange cream soda is a treat"}
{"text":"This place is legit bbq. I was here couple of months ago and found my receipt for this place and felt i had to write a review. 

I ordered the bbq sampler, cornbread and soda for less then $18. It was so much food, i couldn't finish everything.

Next time i'm in AZ, i will definitely be back!

P.S. The place is set up like a high school cafeteria. You wait in line, grab a tray, your utensils, fill your drink, order your food and pay at the end of the line. Kind of unique. But the wait is really long during dinner time. Waited 45 mins, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Best. BBQ. Ever!

Family is from Tennessee.

I live in Texas.

Tried it all.

Still haven't found anything like Joe's. Still crave it like crazy!!!

Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Oh no... I'm about to use the 3 words you should never use when describing BBQ.... DRY, CHEWY, TOUGH.  I was so disappointed in the brisket I ordered from here!  Especially considering Joe's great reputation.  I had to soak the brisket in BBQ sauce just to make it halfway decent, and it still wasn't all that good.

The pork ribs on the other hand -- THAT'S what BBQ should be like!  Moist and tender and falling off the bone easily.  now I know for next time to only order these!

My side was the beans, which were alright although a little too sweet.

Overall, if you're in the area and in the mood for ribs, GO HERE!  the decor inside is quaint and unique. otherwise, might want to check out some of the other BBQ spots in the Valley for brisket.

also side note, I know I'm being too picky, but the condiment area was kind of icky.  I came towards the end of the night (around 8:30 pm) so it's understandable, but still unpleasant to pump out BBQ sauce from sticky dispensers and get sauce all on your hands."}
{"text":"I love Joe's!! Super delicious, I usually get a potato with meat. You also have to have the root beer, it is delicious! The people are always really nice as well! On your birthday you get $10 and you can even get it to go, if you need to! It's pretty awesome! They have a nice big outside area with picnic tables which is great too!"}
{"text":"Great food, staff was nice, the place was clean. Definitely a nice place to eat out on a Sunday afternoon. I had mac and cheese, and a baked potato with everything on top, chives, sour cream, pulled pork,   cheese, and bbq sauce! I will go back in the future."}
{"text":"I admit I'm not a huge BBQ fan, as it usually makes me feel like exploding afterwards but since my dining partner loves BBQ, we've eaten here a lot. The meat is pretty good but at least one of the meats has been dry each time I've been. My favorite has been the ham. The spicy BBQ sauce is pretty darn tasty too. 

I've found myself putting black pepper on the mac and cheese to spice it up and haven't been all that impressed with the rest of their sides either. I'm a big fan of sides at BBQ places, even more than the meat, so when sides disappoint I get sad. :(

I dumped out their homemade root beer after one sip. Don't know what was about it but it was very *off for me, and I seriously love root beer. My dining partner loved it so ehhh...maybe it's just me. 

The place is very interesting on the inside, the decor reminds me of a mid century cafeteria but more modern. They have a huge hand painted mural of a farm and a large outdoor seating area for parents to let their kids run around in while they eat. 

Joe's gets packed. I've seen the line wrap around to the outside on the weekends. I don't think it's worth waiting the 20-30 minutes in line for, but then again I don't think a lot of places are worth that wait for cafeteria style dining."}
{"text":"Get food and selection. You must try the loaded potatoe. The price is reasonable. A good assortment of sides. The meat is tender and tasty. You can either sit inside or outside."}
{"text":"I am just at a loss for words. We ordered from Joe's for a small gathering we were having at our home for a celebrate of life of my mother in law. I can not begin to express just how pleased we were from start to finish with our order. The young woman whose name escapes me, (her name is Courtney as I have been told), was wonderful in making sure the amount of food was going to be correct, not too much and certainly not too little. The food was ready for pick up at the time we asked for. Everything was perfect right down to the serving pieces. I kept everything on warm in the oven until we were ready to serve and it kept moist and tender. The ribs, chicken and brisket were wonderful. The beans and potato salad were just so tasty. Cornbread, always a hit. 

I want to thank you so much for everything, the service, the food and for seeing that every detail was covered. Every guest we had loved the food. You made the day easier on all fronts."}
{"text":"I visited some friends in Gilbert and they took us out to Joe's for lunch. The place is cute. I got the BBQ Sampler with cheesy potatoes and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was awesome! PotAtoes so so. The meets were good. I liked the pulled pork best. They had lots of good options if I were to go back again I would try the loaded baked potatoes they looked amazing. It's canteen style so food is already made and you go through the line and select what you want"}
{"text":"First of all, I feel like I need to explain why I didn't give this place 5 stars. The mac'n'cheese was bland. That's all. I had the beef brisket sandwich with corn and mac'n'cheese. The beef was delicious, nearly falling apart on it's own. 

During dinner we were discussing how to rank this place. It's a super casual environment with ordering done cafeteria style which I imagine to be cumbersome with large families or those with smaller children. On the bright side, there's a John Deere tractor in there, so the kids were all super interested in that. I highly recommend this place although I feel it's probably more popular/appropriate for lunch instead of dinner."}
{"text":"This is kind of a hit or miss place.
The parking is fine. There is plenty of it in the surrounding lots.
The decor and ambience is, well, loud. You stand in a LONG line (most of the time) to order food vis a vis cafeteria style. You can sit outside on benches, in an Arizona Room type patio on benches, or inside on benches (or one of the few booths).
The menu is pretty straight forward. It's BBQ, right? There is a good selection of sides....And there is dessert.
But the food is kind of shrug your shoulders good. It's not some place I would run back to, but I would also recommend it if you are in Gilbert and want Barbeque. (Which seems like an odd request)
The biggest drawback, however, is the price. The prices are a bit high for what you get.  I am a quality over quantity type of eater -- maybe if I was quantity over quality it would be different."}
{"text":"I live in California, every time I come to visit I make it a point to come here! Hands down my favorite barbecue place. It's reasonably priced. There is usually a wait but it's cafeteria style so it's not bad at all. The home made root beer is amazing. I haven't had anything I don't like here but I usually come for the ribs and Mac and cheese. Go here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS BBQ. Oh my goodness! Anytime I'm in the area, I try to eat here. The ribs are so incredibly juicy and delicious! Corn bread is amazing too. I went for my birthday and they give you a free meal. How cool is that?! 

Love this place. Great atmosphere. Feels like a cafeteria but with way better food."}
{"text":"My all-time favorite BBQ joint. I could eat their pulled pork sandwich every day! I also love the Mac and Cheese. We always take advantage of the $10 free birthday meal, especially since my husband goes crazy for the lemon cake."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon, didn't want to get dressed, so we chose outside window pick up.
Stuffed salad, with smoked turkey, very good.
Sampler plate with 2 ribs (delicious), BBQ chicken,and chopped brisket. Side of cheesy potatoes. Amazing how far they go, so hearty.
Wife's usual pulled pork, just the way she likes.
Overall, a bit pricey, but delicious. 
Window service young lady was perfect!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ, good beans, good Mac and cheese! I wish they would have done more with the bread my pulled pork came on. Great atmosphere for a BBQ joint!"}
{"text":"Similar to Joe's Farm grill we make sure this is one of our regularly yearly places to hit whenever we can. 

Piles of BBQ'd meat? Yes please 
Free birthday meal? Hell yeah
Homemade rootbeer? I'm moving in

We've had consistently great food and service every visit and to top it off on my birthday they gave my friend a free meal too because he was in the military. You can't beat that kind of hospitality"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't been said?  I had the \"sampler\" plate that includes ribs, chicken and brisket and let me tell you every bite just melted in my mouth.  It was my daughter's birthday so she got $10 off her meal which was almost the cost of hers. The homemade root beer is to die for- not like any bottled brand and the kids plate was more than enough food. You're missing a great meal if you skip Joe's!"}
{"text":"Not quite what I remember. It wasn't bad by any means but it didn't blow me away like it used to. Spicy sausage had good flavor. Pulled pork tasted like standard pulled pork. Coleslaw was too sweet and the beans were bland. Mac 'n cheese was very good though as was the fresh watermelon. The ambience is unique but not sure it has changed much in recent years."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ place I've been to yet! The Seasoning on the chicken was amazing.. Sweet, but not over sweet and definitely not salty like other places I've been to. The ribs were tender and sauce was delicious! The pulled pork had so much flavor and in my opinion didn't even need anything else added to it. So so good! My family will be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"I was so hoping to find a good barbecue restaurant near our house. Unfortunately Joe's Real BBQ just misses the mark. The food tasted watery like it had been steamed to keep it moist. Beans & slaw were just average. Cool place inside and is certainly good for families w/ kids. 

Wish i could say I will be back, but with so many other great choices, not likely."}
{"text":"Yummy BBQ. Cafeteria style dining. 

So glad I stopped in and decided to give this place a try. The beef brisket was juicy and tender and the pork ribs fell off the bone. I will be back to try their other meats!

I did fall in love with their brisket beans. Nice hearty chunks of meat mixed in with the sweet and savory taste of beans. Can't get any better than that.

Next time I'm in, I do hope I get fresh Mac n cheese because what I got today wasn't so fresh.

Overall, this is a great place to come to when you're craving a BBQ. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ, mac & cheese, hot links and beans.
Not much for picky kids to eat besides mac & cheese.
The line can get long (out the front door!), but take out is available & you can call your order in ahead of time.
Staff is always friendly & courteous."}
{"text":"I started to come here for diner on the 11th but that didn't work out since half of Gilbert was either inside the restaurant or waiting outside trying to get in.  Ended up coming back today for lunch.

We ordered the brisket, pulled pork and pulled pork sandwich.  The sides were cole slaw and potato salad.

Pulled pork was pretty decent as was the cole slaw.  Brisket was adequate.  Potato salad was an odd almost orange color.

We also had two sodas.  I'm not sure the soda machine could have been placed in a worse location if they tried.  The restaurant is set up in a cafeteria line set up (not one of my favorite food service methods) and the soda machine is just before the food line.  As long as you're going through the food line...no problem.  If you're trying to get a refill, you have to swim upstream against all the people in the food line.  There's a sign in the place that says they've been open since 1998.  I'd think that in that time some one would have realized the soda machine placement was  a non starter.

Overall the place was ok, but I would have been REEEEEAAAAALLLLL unhappy if I would have waited in line on the 11th...it's just not worth that type of wait."}
{"text":"I grew up in the East Valley, and Joe's was pretty much a safe bet whenever you wanted good BBQ.  It's literally been years since I had been until just recently, when we went to celebrate a friend's birthday.  

I've always loved the great old farm house style building that they're in along with the very large patio/picnic area in the back.  This is certainly a place where families can feel welcomed.  Once the weather gets down to normal temps at night, the patio would be wonderful.

For dinner I got the chopped brisket sandwich with a side of corn and a side of mac and cheese.  To drink, I got what I love this place for, Stewart's Key Lime Soda.  YUM!  The brisket was pretty good and since it was cooked in sauce, there was no shortage of sweet and tangy bbq flavor.  I didn't eat the bun because I was more concerned about stuffing my face with my sides.  The corn is really yummy.  It's crisp, sweet, and swimming in a buttery liquid.  The mac and cheese was also very good.  It was tender and super creamy and cheesy.  That's my kind of mac and cheese!  

Overall, I really like this place, but it's too far out of the way to go very often, and the husband doesn't really care for it.  It of course has the issues, such as the crazy line, and the fact that a refill on your soda means cutting in line, but it's a pretty nice laid back place to go and grab some bbq in cute Old-Town Gilbert."}
{"text":"They catered our wedding. Everything went off wiithout a hitch and the food was amazing. All of our guests loved the food and it was incredibly affordable without sacrificing quality. Easiest vendor we worked with."}
{"text":"Not that biggest fan of bbq but this place is a must see and eat! Cute vintage theme. Most bbq places don't have, but Joe's did. The ham sandwich was amazing! Added a little more bbq sauce,  pickles, onions and it was heaven. 

Potatoe salad was pretty good too! Had a bite of the brisket and that was very delicious too."}
{"text":"I love Joe and I love Joe's good. I like to grab a few different sorts of meats, some sort of hot bbq sauce, and a lemonade.The beans rock and my daughter loves their mac 'n cheese. That whole corner there in Gilbert, AZ is really cool and I have photographed this often. The entire neighborhood smells like smoked woody bbq."}
{"text":"Love Joe's.  My fav is the pull pork sandwich.  The sides are also awesome, especially the mac and cheese."}
