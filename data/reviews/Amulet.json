{"text":"What a HORRIBLE place is this restaurant !!! the food is absolute garbage ! Soviet union stolovaya style ! everything else is masked with mayonnaise - absolutely dreadful !!! absolute MESS and disorganization !!!DÃ©cor and setting of this place, projects an ambiance of cheapness.... tables are narrow and squeezed together to fit more people in - but later I found out that it wasn't such a bad thing anyway, because the music is so bad, you don't need to get in and out of your seat anyway - so might as well sit and not move ! the MUSIC is simply atrocious... by any standards, they mediocre karaoke .... You will need to hear at least half of each song to even begin to recognize what song is it.... I don't even know how that place survived . Do yourself a favor and SAVE your money and disappointment - STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE ! The great alternative to this place is National Restaurant & Banquet Hall   !!!"}
{"text":"We were in Amulet for my aunt's birthday party. I've been to many Russian restaurants, but this one was probably the worst I visited. The food was terrible, the selection was the same as in Yummy Market ready food section, but the quality was worse. I felt bad that everything I tried was left on my plate. 
I added extra star in my review for the music and dancing. The band was surprisingly good and it was a lot of fun dancing to oldies. The crowd was going nuts: a couple of old ladies were dancing with canes (reminded me of \"Producers\" musical), some big Polish guy was doing \"salsa moves\" while the band played \"Hava Nagila\", etc. I wanted to take video but my husband stopped me for being impolite."}
{"text":"Amulet restaurant and banquet hall is a popular place for special events, food is top notch and the atmosphere very festive.  I've seen many birthdays and russian style parties take place here, its common for weddings too, and so far every one I've talked to has been very satisfied with this place.  I am considering it for my own birthday party in a few months!  I posted pics which I took just before a birthday party was about to take place, the cold appetizers were already on the table, but the other foods were not out just yet. The centerpieces are provided by the florist and not included by the restaurant.  Hope the pics help, food presentation is amazing too!!!"}
{"text":"Menu here has been the same for a long time (many years) and it's not too bad. The music is outdated a LOT, but they cater to their public. This is an Eastern European restaurant (Russia, Ukraine, and all around). 
Restaurant is clean, service is good. 

We got take-out catering by this restaurant too, only complaint is the cold dry duck dish, otherwise pretty good. 

3 stars because I personally don't enjoy those kind of establishments, however older generations might  think otherwise."}
