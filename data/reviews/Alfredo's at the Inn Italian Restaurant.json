{"text":"It has really good food and fancy restaurant it is really pretty I like eating on the Patio we are definitely coming back A pretty fountain And party room"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Our waitress was rude. We had a large group and we were celebrating an event. Our waitress seemed put-off. It took a while to receive our food, drinks weren't refilled so we asked for a pitcher of water at our tables. The waitress didn't check on us and salad bowls and some dirty plates were sitting on the table. Someone asked if she could take the dirty plates...she asked if we wanted hot food or our dishes cleared off the table. They were slicing pieces of cake and handed someone a piece and she said you get the messed up piece (even though we had 1/2 a cake left). The leftover cake was thrown in the to-go containers and completely trashed when we opened it. The food was average, a couple of the meals were cold when brought out (and not due to the dishes being cleared off our table). The waitress really ruined our experience there and a number of people in our party were upset but didn't want it to ruin our celebration. Other waitresses seemed pleasant and cheerful to guests, but ours was downright rude from the moment she came to our table (and she barely came around except to take our order and deliver food). We won't be back."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm impressed.   I was a bit wary at first. I'm staying at the Holiday Inn tonight and saw that they had a restaurant. I honestly only ate here out of laziness, but I came away impressed. I'm not usually a fan of restaurants in hotels.   The restaurant itself is cozy and dimly lit. It's definitely not pretentious. They had Blackstone wines, which I am a fan of. I was also pleased to find that everything is freshly made in house. When my pizza arrived, it was clear that everything was carefully prepared with fresh, high quality ingredients. The cheese was just oozing from the pizza and the sprinkle of basil was the perfect accompianment.   There was a good energy coming form the clientel. I assume this is because their meals were delicious. :)   I will definitely come here again if I ever have to stay in Mayfield Heights."}
{"text":"Alfredo's is nothing but quality all the way!!! I've eaten there several times and have experienced nothing but  wonderful  food and service. I really enjoy the fact that their chefs can stray from the menu and make any Italian dish you  desire ,if there not too busy. Ive arrived after their kitchen has closed  and the staff actually  accommodated   me with surprise.  I also enjoy the clientele while sitting at their bar. Being from Maine it seems to me the patrons are  really nice as well as the bar tenders.  Bottom line ,I love going to Alfredo's !!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write a negative Yelp review, but one is definitely warranted here.  Yelp doesn't give you the opportunity to rate a business as two thumbs down, but this restaurant would definitely deserve this rating from me after what I have been through over the past 24 hours.  I went here for dinner with 16 other people (2 tables total) on May 13, 2012, and it is safe to say that the owner couldn't pay me enough to come back.  This place charged about $20 for a dinner.  At that price, I tend to set my expectations for the quality of food and service fairly high.  Needless to say, my expectations were not met.  Service: Our server, Roseanne, wasn't professional enough to be working at a Waffle House, much less a place that claimed to be a decent Italian restaurant.  She never checked on us while we were eating our salads or our dinners; we had to get her attention for whatever we needed.  We asked her to provide us with a pitcher of water, so our glasses wouldn't need to keep getting refilled.  She gave it to us, but her body language certainly said that she did so begrudgingly.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't most decent restaurants have separate wait staffers in charge of keeping peoples water glasses filled?  After one of my cousins asked for olive oil for our Italian bread, she slammed the entire bottle of olive oil (that looked like it had been taken right out of the kitchen) on the table in front of me.  I never even asked for it!  Later, one of my cousins asked for extra marinara sauce for her chicken parm.  Roseanne didn't even verbally acknowledge her and brought it out without saying anything to her.  Roseanne later complained to the other half of our party that our table kept asking for too much.  When someone at the other table ordered dessert, Roseanne took the dessert from the sample tray she brought out and gave it to them.  Now, I am not one to make assumptions, but shouldn't the dessert item be prepared fresh in the kitchen and then brought out?  Who knows how long that item had been sitting out on that tray?  Food: I ordered pork chops with mashed potatoes and steamed mixed vegetables and a salad to start.  My wife order some type of pasta dish with pieces of chicken and pork that, apparently, had the owner's last name in its name.  I would describe the flavor of my wife's pasta as \"angel hair with ketchup.\"  Moreover, she found a long, thin bone in the pasta that could have easily been mistaken for a piece of angel hair.  Thank goodness we didn't have to make a trip into the emergency room.  My pork chops and sides were just okay tasting.  Cinnamon in mashed potatoes did not work for me.  I also tasted a piece of my cousin's veal parm.  Now, I'm not a master chef by any stretch, but I've made better chicken/veal parm at home using a recipe from a cookbook written by Tony Danza (yes, that Tony Danza).  However, the food I ate has come back to haunt me today.  I do not want to get into specifics, but I will say that I've spent more time in the bathroom this morning than I usually spend in there over the course of an entire day.  In summary, in my humble opinion, Alfredo's was awful and a terrible value.  The server we had wasn't professional enough to work at a Waffle House.  The cooks put out a terrible product that literally made me sick.  I beg you and anyone you know to avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"We rediscovered Alfredos upon using there facilities for a bereavement luncheon.  The veal Parmesan is wonderful and the chicken marsala melts in your mouth.  The staff was very attentive and the presentation outstanding.    Last night, we came for dinner and I had the Salmon special.  It was a very tasty and filling meal with risotto and a side salad.  The atmosphere is very rustic and beautiful.  The dinner took a bit longer coming out than I would have liked, but the meal itself was excellent...I will be back!"}
{"text":"I cannot tell you enough how impressed I am with this establishment. I called them to make a reservation for my parents 50th wedding anniversary.  We were a large group - 19 total. The girl who took the phone call was more than accommodating. She put me on hold for a second to check and make sure they could seat  our large group that night. She came back to the phone and said they would be happy to accommodate us. They were extremely busy that night but that did seem to be a problem. Our server Tish was fabulous. She was pleasant and efficient. Our food was delicious and came out quickly. Thanks to the amazing staff for ensuring that this special celebration went off without a hitch!"}
{"text":"I was a guest at the holiday inn in Mayfield for 5weeks. During my stay my colleagues and I were frequent customers at Alfredos. The staff and food we're outstanding. Since I was such a frequent guest during my 5 week stay i became relatively close with the staff. Roseanne and Nanci were awesome bartenders and made our nights at the bar a lot of fun. They definitely made us all feel right at home. Chef Anthony is a great chef and has a true passion for cooking. He always greeted us upon arrival and gave a vivid description of the menu items. Every meal I had was excellent. Always fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection. Maryanne, one of the restaurant managers, was also great at making sure every visit to the restaurant was perfect. She showed genuine interest in us and like the rest of the staff made us feel like family. I can honestly say I will miss the staff at Alfredo's.My overall experience while staying at the holiday inn was outstanding. If I am ever in the Cleveland area again I will be sure to stay at the holiday inn Mayfield."}
{"text":"Pass.  Very pedestrian Italian food. Sad pizza and mozzarella sticks.  Way, way better options for Italian on the East Side like Mama Catena in Euclid."}
{"text":"Great everything!! Never a bad experience! Menu and flavors are authentic! Service consistent. For Mayfield it is my favorite apart from Little Italy!"}
{"text":"Wow, hard to get the bartenders's attention as she was focused on, well, everything else.  Ordered drink.  When it arrived I asked for menu.  \"Kitchen is closed.\"  Sign says open, hours say open to 9.  It was 8:45.   Would have been great to know about the abrupt closure at the time that I ordered the drink.  I guess she was too busy."}
{"text":"Great spot....nice Italian bread w/ salt on it...I had veal parm...very nice...w/ cavatelli on the side subbed in on my request.....highly recommend this spot if you are in the area looking for Italian food"}
{"text":"This review proves that what you read is definitely not always so.  We just got done with dinner and it was not only good, it was EXCELLENT.  We were greeted very hospitably by the hostess and staff.  Our waitress was personable, recommended a delicious appetizer and was attentive.  The food was very tasty and fresh.  We are on vacation from Orlando, visiting family in Pittsburgh and came over to Cleveland for a few of the Hall of Fames...and was delighted to stay at the Holiday Inn here in Mayfield Heights and eat at this first class establishment. Two thumbs up to Alfredo's at the Inn.  And one more thing~the desserts are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service with our very large group (half of which were children).  Our dinners were excellent and presented nicely. The seafood was fresh and delicious. Boys loved the brick fired pizza.  The soups were delicious. The servers were friendly, outgoing and so very nice.   Excellent!  Absolutely go back when in town."}
{"text":"This is a great family Italian restaurant which I have eaten at on several occasions. This evening we showed up with 12 people without a reservation. We had gone to a funeral and our family all wanted to eat together. We had a reservation at another restaurant (J Alexander) that had promised us they would seat us all together, but when we showed up they told us they were going to put us at separate tables. I called Alfredo's and they said \"no problem come on in.\"  Their service was exceptional, and everyone enjoyed their food.  They bent over backwards to take care of us, and our waitress was phenomenal. I would definitely go back.  This is a restaurant that knows how to take care of its customers."}
{"text":"A very good meal with friendly and attentive waitstaff. The Chicken Piccata was wonderful, and Maureen was a joy as a waitress."}
{"text":"We keep trying this place, it is hit or miss. Chix piccata was huge chunks of chix, not pounded out. Tasted like turkey, but might be because it was seared on the flat top. Weird piccata sauce. The risotto was good. Bf's frutta de mare was really good.  Service was ok, but had a couple hiccups. We must expect too much."}
{"text":"The breakfast buffet was good. It's not really fair to rate the rest. The place is nice - try it."}
{"text":"I ordered cheese ravioli with some Parmesan. One nice touch was a gigantic loaf of bread which we were also able to put Parmesan on. This restaurant was in the holiday in bar so the seating was average, but the service was great. This is high caliber Italian food.   My partner ordered the Veal Parmesan. For ethical reasons I didn't try it but I was told it was excellent.   I guess this place didn't exactly set the world on fire but it was good."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Get over that it is in a hotel and it is really cute and romantic inside.  You can even sit in a wine barrel booth. They have great bread, pizza and entrees.  Their menu has a good selection.  I have never had a bad meal here.  Unfortunately I have had bad service. There are few servers who are good but the bad are very bad.  I would have given it 4 stars but the service gives it 3"}
{"text":"Looking for cutting edge nouveau Italian? Then Alfredo's is NOT for you. But, if you want a quick bite of traditionally prepared Italian favorites then it's worth a look.  It makes sense that this kind of Italian restaurant would be attached to a hotel: both trying to make those out-of-towners feel like they're at home. And Alfredo's makes you feel at home, just sort of making you clean up after yourself at the end of the meal.   During my visit on a Tuesday during dinner, I had the veal marsala. It was chocked full of mushrooms and a delightfully rich and abundant sauce. The veal was tender and easily cut without the use of a knife.   Portion sizes are generous, especially for dishes like chicken parm. (1 large chicken breast with a side of spaghetti. Reviews between the 3 other diners in my party were mixed. All had chicken parm. Some said it was great, one said the chicken tasted \"pre-frozen and reheated.\"  Alfredo's isn't looking to break new ground and reinvent Italian. But if you're looking for some good comfort food, this is a good place to turn."}
{"text":"Awful. I've eaten hear many times hoping to find something worth eating. Everything is crap. As I sit here I am eating what they call a pizza. It is actually a small ball of dough with a tablespoon of sauce and a small handful of cheese. It covered a 12 inch plate but there was so little to it I'm going to have to get a second dinner elsewhere.  I had the risotto rosa a few nights ago and the sausage was dry and flavorless.  The lasagna was incredibly salty and over cooked. I am currently being held hostage. They took my plate but never brought the bill."}
{"text":"OMG!  Love this place. I have lived in this area off-and-on a long time and didn't know it existed until 2011.  Since then it has been my favorite Italian restaurant and won't go anywhere else!  They don't take reservations for less than 8 people, but they will always accommodate wherever possible. So nice, friendly & helpful!!  Bring your best girl or guy and get there early enough to sit in one of the wine barrels. A little more private and romantic.  Veal parm is to die for, and quite reasonably priced compared to other restaurants.  Small/privately owned restaurant with \"large chain\" consistency in food taste and appeal, and great service and staff.  If you live in the area and have not been, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Great service and very accommodating. Fantastic food and delicious bread while you wait! My family and I have been visiting Alfredo's since it was Spaghetti Company-Over the years this restaurant has shared many milestones with my family and we love it!"}
{"text":"Wow. I thought it would be bad but it was worse...  Had the Chicken Parm. Which was an avg cooked piece of chicken. But then wait. No wait, we want to stir your food up for you, so the Speghitti sauce was in not on the noodles and that may have been on purpose. If you took your avg bottle of Ketchup and avg Can of Tomato sauce and mixed with a hand mixer, tah dah this places secret tomato sauce. Goodness it couldnt have been worse if it had been accompanied by Stale bread which in fact it was. The only saving grave was how many times the server Sneezed and Coughed without washing her hands. That way I knew to hurry and leave before I got ill from the food or staff.  Jeesh. Dont go here."}
{"text":"I do love this restaurant, as I have never had a bad meal and the bread is to die for; however, the service is exceptionally poor and has been for years. Every single waitress and waiter we have had over the past 5 years (approximately 10 dinners) has been negligent, slow, forgetful, and not very friendly. It is unfortunate because the food is so delicious and the chicken parmesan is better than any I have had any place else in the country. My fiancee has been to Italy many times and says that the veal is better than any cut you would find in Italy. I would recommend this if you keep your service expectations low and have a lot of time to sit around and wait for your coffee and water refills, not to mention the check. Typical wait time between finishing your meal completely and receiving the check is about 30-40 minutes and then another 20 to get your change or credit card back. The food is so good and the veal almost makes the negatives not so bad!"}
{"text":"I love Italian food, and this place delivers. It is a bit off the radar as it us in the Holiday Inn but don't let that fool you.   The decor makes this a graet place for a romantic dinner or it can also be a great place to meet for drinks with friends then just hang out and have some great food.  I love sausage and Alfredo's homade sausage is some of the best around. Their veil is also a stunning achievement. This coupled by their daily specials and fantastic deserts make it one of the areas best.  The wait staff is very pleasant and accommodating.   If you like casual dining and great Italian food be sure to visit."}
{"text":"Average food, but wonderful service by Kelly.  One of our group asked for the veal dish to be prepared Marsala, but the kitchen refused, citing some ridiculous, irrational reason.  I like patronizing places where \" the customer is always right,\" not this place where \"the customer is always wrong.\"  This is but one of numerous restaurants which exist only because it is located in a hotel and is located in an area with several better ones.  Do your self a favor a drive a few miles and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the worst meals and service I have had in a long time.  The waitress had to many tables that she had long conversations at and basically couldn't say hello to us.  I had the chicken parmesan and it was dry and over cooked.  There are many better restaurants in the area that I would recommend.   Not here."}
{"text":"I've been to Alfredo's in the past and the food was ok, but after my lunch today, I think it's safe to downgrade it to \"meh.\"    I had a wilted side salad and an overly soggy caprese wrap.  I often say it's hard to mess up a salad, but if a salad has been sitting for awhile, the lettuce will start to decompose.  The salad I had at Alfredo's was proof of that.  Yuck-o.  Slimy lettuce.  The wrap looked like something I'd make at home, although I'd use better mozzarella cheese, fresher vegetables, and balsamic dressing that tastes like something besides oil.  The only real redeeming quality of this restaurant was its nice patio.    Oh well!  I suppose this restaurant provides decent restaurant food, or food fit for a 70 year old's tastes (my friend and I were the only people under 70 - no joke), but in the future, I'll pass."}
{"text":"Well for those of you have had the pleasure of tasting real Italian food, try to forget it.  The semi Italian stuff you get here is not even close to leftovers at a real Italian restaurant. Wrong flavored , pounds over pounds of cheese, way too much tomato, no Italian desert, coffee which tastes like sewer water.   Waited for 45 minutes between dishes. I counted 7 servers and all tried to not serve.  What a huge bummer. Don't go there folks!"}
{"text":"Veal parmigiana was heavy and bland, like some of the patrons here.  It was one of those meals that sits very heavily inside your stomach for hours afterward.  Not bad, I guess, for a hotel lobby restaurant offering a 4-course meal for $17.  Setting is nice, staff are friendly, Italian wedding soup was the best part of the 4-course meal. Nice flavor.  The salad was ordinary and acceptable.  The veal parmigiana was heavy, uninteresting, little flavor, and the sauce very simplistic. The spaghettini was nice and the roasted green pepper was ok.  Dessert was fried dough, which was almost identical to the coating on the veal. Thick, heavy, flavorless. Couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Had the chicken Marsala and it was great. I've eaten here over the years when I visit and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful walleye on a bed of spinach risotto. Yummy Italian Wedding soup and fresh salad. Wish I had taken pics!"}
{"text":"Alfredo's is excellent. The restaurant existed before the Holiday Inn in which it is housed. So this is definitely not your usual motel restaurant. The menu includes polenta fries, tripe, and swiss chard patties in addition to other Italian standards like gnocchi and chicken parmesan.  We liked it so much we went back for dinner a second night. Servers were good.  As another reviewer noted, the place does get busy, so service may be slow.  The food more than made up for it. Next time we're in Mayfield, we'll be back."}
{"text":"GREAT taste for your money.  We didn't have options for dinner so we were stuck with this restaurant, but we had a good feeling about it since we had breakfast in the morning and tasted the buffet.  The buffet in the morning was no more than scrambled eggs, gravy, potatoes, french toast and fruit... But the taste of each one of these plates showed that they were getting fresh ingredients probably from a locally source and they were cooked to perfection!  At dinner, we had a hard time deciding again... For appetizers we chose the Stuffed Artichoke, which was delicious (Remember to not eat the artichokes' leaves, just the heart!) For main course I went with the Potato Crusted Cod ($16), served with penne pasta and marinara sauce. Really delicious and with just the right amount of crust so it's not too healthy and not too heavy.  Since the portion sizes are somewhat big, we could not pursue the option of dessert... Maybe next time."}
{"text":"I love the authentic Italian flavors of their food.  We are from out of town so we only get to eat here a couple of times a year when we are visiting the area and staying at the Holiday Inn Express Mayfield Village.  We came at 7:00pm on a Friday evening.  The place was hoping.  We waited about 25 minutes for a table and then about 10 minutes to get our water.  I was disappointed in the slow service but I realize that the servers were really hustling and doing all  they could to take care of everyone.  They had enough servers, so I can't fault them that.  The wait was worth it.  We love their eggplant parmesan.  It comes with a side of spaghetti and the serving size for both the spaghetti and the eggplant parmesan was just perfect, I thought.  I got the Friday fish fry and it was wonderful.  It was scrod fish with a crispy panko coating.  It came with French fries, cole slaw and tartare sauce.    The warm Italian bread rolls were fantastic.  This will always be one of our favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Found this the best of any restaurant in a Holiday Inn I have ever visited.  Usually the menus at a Holiday Inn are  bland and unimaginative, probably why Jimmy Buffet made fun of the in his song \"Cheeseburger is Paradise\". This Italian restaurant is top notch, and always bussy.   Over the last few years I've tasted the pasta fagioli soup fresh and full of flavor with the beans cooked perfectly. The spinach salad is very strong. I also enjoyed the clams in red sauce over linguini. By far my favorite is the eggplant marinara. Slices of eggplant breaded covered with a fresh lively marinara sauce, but I always ask the chef to leave off the melted mozzarella cheese on top, and shake on a little parm   Next time I'm going to try the pizza. They make right by the bar area and it looks fantastic."}
{"text":"Appetizers were delicious,  dinner not so much.  One of us had to send under done meat back and the eggplant parm tasted rancid.  Wait staff and bartender were friendly,   but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. My favorite restaurant hands down. Gnocchi alla vodka and zucchini sticks are my preferred items on the menu, but the chicken parmesan is also great.  The staff is always very friendly and attentive.   If you haven't given this place a try you are missing out."}
{"text":"I had lunch at this restaurant today because I was at a conference at a hotel down the road and this was my only option for the lunch hour I had. The host placed my order because my time was limited and the waiter was busy with another table. I had delicious, healthy salmon cakes served over sautéed spinach...a much better option than any fast food choice. The service was courteous and quick.  I was able to eat without rushing in the lunch time I was given from my conference."}
{"text":"Absolute worst.  Chef will not do anything to make any type of breakfast without butter. He has eggs and will not cook them without butter or milk!"}
{"text":"I had the Crusted Artichoke and the wedge salad.  I have had many of wedge salads before but this was not really a wedge. It was served not in a wedge but as lettuce on a plate. See photo.  In my travels I have ordered wedge salads in other states and this was a disappointment for the price.  My husband paid $15.00 for a small spoonful of Lasagne. He said it was nothing special."}
