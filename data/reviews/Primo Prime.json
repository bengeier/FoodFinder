{"text":"Primo has always been one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte and it continues to be after all the changes that have been made. I have had a couple wonderful evenings there so far since it reopened. My favorite dishes are the fritto misto, the charred romaine salad, the gnocchi, and the steaks. The service is always on point, as well! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We went here for Valentine's. It was $75 per person for 5 courses. We ended up spending $220 after we each had ONE drink, tax and tip. I don't know about you but if I'm leaving a two person dinner spending $220 I want to be blown away. Course one- I got 2 scallops- they were very good- a little over cooked but good. He got steak bruschetta also good. But literally one piece of bread. Course 2- Caesar salad- it was a basic Caesar salad and they didn't screw it up so that was good! Course 3- this is when everything went to shit. There was this pasta pappardelle and it was okay but the pasta wasn't al dente it was crunchy. I got the gnocchi and WTF gnocchi are my favorite but these were little mini ravioli balls. Gnocchi are supposed to be little potato pasta dumplings but these were balls of pasta (regular pasta) filled with ricotta. They weren't gnocchi but they were okay. Course 4- he got lobster and i got filet mignon. Lobster was okay- not seasoned and over cooked. Filet was ordered medium and it came out between rare and medium rare. They took it back and threw it in the microwave for us (hahahahahaha) then brought it back. It was pretty tasty though. Last course- i got the cannoli and another major disappointment. Just like the gnocchi- the consistency and texture were off- they just weren't  right. Also no chocolate chips. The tiramisu was good. Service: The place was empty and we got seated right at the front door and all the servers were bored and just hounded us. Filling water cups every two minutes. It was good service but back off a bit. 

What I learned- don't go out to eat on Valentine's Day. Don't ever spend $220 on a meal for two people because you will always be disappointed. Don't trust anyone that says they serve authentic Italian food when you are actually Italian."}
{"text":"NAME CHANGE - this is the former Primo Tuscan Grille. Primo did a major renovation and menu change and are now calling the restaurant Primo Prime. Last night I met a friend for a drink and had a marvelous time. The drinks were generous in quantity and the bartender very friendly. I was pleased to meet the chef/owner Joseph when he came out of the kitchen. 

The restaurant has a nice upscale environment - perfect for a business meeting or date night.

I took my food back home - a chicken dish that was a special last night and it came with the most awesome sauteed spinach. The takeout was packaged well (which I always feel is very important.) I will, without a doubt, go back to Primo Prime."}
{"text":"Historically have gone to primos about once a year.  Celebrated a friend's birthday there this weekend and it was great.  The interior has been touched up, and with the crisp white walls, white leather seating and murals, it seems like you are floating on a cloud.  

The service was great.  Hovered slightly up probably bc they surprisingly were not that full.  

Food hit on all points.  Grilled romaine salad was light and had nice mild char.  Spaghetti carbonara had crispy pancetta with pasta that was cooked perfectly and was velvety/buttery/creamy.  Mahi tuna special got the 'best mahi I've ever had' label, and the plate the tiramisu came on was practically licked clean.  Good wine list too.  

This is an underrated spot which is about to have a major comeback."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pasta i've have had in Charlotte. My husband had the bolognese which we both loved. I had an off menu pasta dish that the owner recommended- scallops, shrimp, lobster, and sundried tomatoes in a cream sauce. I stopped stuffing my face long enough to take a picture. Yall. It. was. so. good. The service was excellent and we'll definitely be back to try more dishes!"}
