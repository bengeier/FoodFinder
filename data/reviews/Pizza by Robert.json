{"text":"WOW!  What a great pizza!  This has to be the best pizza I've had in a very long time.  A little pricier than what I usually get but well worth the price.  The ratio of cheese, sauce and crust was perfect and the topping were delicious.  Even though I have to go pick it up myself because of a limited delivery area, I will definitely be going back again and again."}
{"text":"Don't eat their food. I got food poisoning in March 2016 from their food. Bonnie said she would credit my Discover Card payment but she never did. Dishonesty and poor food hygiene."}
{"text":"Used to get pizza here regularly.  Haven't ordered in a while and I already regret it after placing the order!  I realize that pizza places are busy and get a lot of phone calls during dinner hours, but the guy on the phone could not have seemed more annoyed about having to take my order, and was rushing me so much I wanted to purposely keep him on the phone just to irritate him back!  Really need to improve their customer service.  I'm pretty sure other pizza places don't treat their customers so rudely."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, but they don't use fresh mushrooms. The crust is good because it has corn meal in it. I did have a bad experience with ordering a pizza. I charged it to my credit card and had it delivered. The guy delivered my pizza and I gave him a tip, then I get my credit card bill and Pizza byRobert added an additional gratuity to my credit card. I was not happy and I called  the owner and he never called me back. I am sorry to say, but I won't be ordering a pizza from them again. They should of called back and tried to resolve this problem."}
{"text":"Very expensive, but good so I overpay once in awhile.  My last experience was very disappointing.  They made my pizza wrong and made me drive back to pickup another one, never offered to deliver it and refused to give me any discount or even a coupon for a future purchase. Total lack of customer service by a very inexperienced manager."}
{"text":"Fabulicious Pizza!

Pizza by Robert is definitely one of my stand-bys and I pass by it daily, hence \"convenient\".  It is located in a small strip center, anchored by Aldi.  I have never had trouble getting delivery to my house (about 3  miles away).

Now that we have the geographics out of the way, let's concentrate on the pizza.  Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, I love their pizza!  Toppings range from the standard (pepperoni and banana peppers) to the interesting (Shiitake Mushrooms and spinach).  All toppings are fresh and there is no doubting it.  Aside from the red sauce, they have some interesting white sauces (butter and garlic,  lobster cream sauce and a chicken alfredo).  

I personally love the lobster cream sauce, which has become my \"standard\" and served on the \"Seafood Pizza\", with Shrimp Crab Meat and fresh Spinach.  From time-to-time, I order a pesto pizza (with pinenuts and sun dried tomatoes), so you can understand I'm not your typical Pizza Hut customer.  

The 12\" one item pizzas are around $10, the specialty pizzas vary in price.  I generally get 9\" with the specialty pizzas because they really fill you up.  

Their menu also includes pastas, salads, strombolis, ribs and chicken wings.  While I have never tried their wings, they do look and smell good. 

There is no seating at Pizza by Robert, but I always see a lot of scarfing on the sidewalk and in cars.  I"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza tonight because I didn't have time to cook, and it was boyfriend's turn to choose, so he chose Pizza by Robert. I was excited to learn they will deliver in Bay Village, but chose to pick up because that was 20 minutes and delivery was an hour. I arrived at Pizza by Robert after 20 minutes and waited. And waited. And waited. People came in to order and left with their pizza before I got mine. At one point the entire kitchen stopped to argue about a customer or employee who called in to say he couldn't come to work because his power was out and the garage door wouldn't open. So I was really excited to hear that conversation stop the work flow while I was STILL WAITING. When my pizza was finally ready, they were STILL telling people on the phone that pickups were 20 minutes. COME ON. By the time I got home it was an hour from my initial call and I wasted all that time sitting there. It defeated the purpose of not cooking dinner and I was incredibly aggravated. The two kids working there were not, um, super experienced, knowledgeable, or thorough at customer service, to say the least, but it's not like they were running the store. The man and woman who I assume run the place were supervising the kitchen and taking orders, respectively, and it's not like they just opened so they should know better. 

The food was good. We got a thick crust Hawaiian and garlic cheese bread. The cheese bread is a 6 inch sandwich bread with some garlic butter and melted cheese. It's soggy and not worth it. The thick pizza crust is most like Pizza Hut pan pizza, if you want a national-chain comparison. The sauce is salty, not too garlicy or sweet. The ham is in small cubes, which I really appreciate because I don't like Hawaiian with slices or big chunks of ham. It's greasy in a guilty way. The pizza is good, make no  mistake, it's really good, but is it sub-par-customer-service-waste-of-time-extreme-aggravation good? Definitely not. There are a host of really decent local pizzerias in the area, most of which deliver or are easier to get to, so unless someone else is ordering the pizza and dealing with the employees here, I'm out."}
{"text":"Ah, Pizza By Robert. A refreshing name in a landscape littered with chain pizza restaurants and all you can eat buffets. While the pie did not change my life, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the product. As a first time customer, I did not know what to expect. I opted for the thin-crust (sort of) 12 inch Hawaiian pizza. Roughly thirty minutes after ordering by phone, the pizza, and the charming older delivery man, had shown up at my doorstep. After paying $14.90 plus tip (a pricy, but ultimately appropriate bill), it was time to chow down. The pizza was fantastic. The ingredients were proportioned perfectly, as were the toppings. My only complaint is the flimsiness of the crust, but after allowing the pizza to cool down, this was not a problem. The slices are not big enough to be folded, and small enough where you can eat four to five in one sitting. Even better, it tasted great leftover a few hours later! I definitely recommend Pizza by Robert as an alternative to the chains that dominate the Cleveland pizza scene today."}
{"text":"Pizza here reminds me of Angelos but is somewhat inconsistent. Some days it's way better than other times. Would recommend the extra cheese because sometimes it's a little lacking. Sometimes the larger sizes pizzas aren't cooked enough. Overall usually great quality. The prices are a bit over priced for a regular pizza place though. Even with coupon expect to pay a lot. Wish they would have cheaper deals."}
{"text":"Pizza by Robert pizza may be a little bit more expensive than other pizzas, but it is worth every penny! They have terrific sauce and their ingredients are great tasting as well. They are my go to place when I want to good pizza."}
{"text":"Very good Pizza! I had recently moved here, and was looking for a good pizza joint to replace the spot I used to frequent. A co-worker of mine brought some in, and I was hooked ever since. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it's a bit on the greasy side. But hey it's Pizza after all. Other than that, it's excellent."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the whole world! Order deep dish, you won't be sorry! I think they are better then Angelo's in Lakewood, but then again I hear they're related."}
{"text":"We love pizza by Robert. Always get it we'll done for a crispy crust. Their little rib lets are fantastic.  Highly recommend. If you reheat the pizza, do it in the oven. I swear the pizza tastes better on day 2!!"}
{"text":"Really really good pizza. It's pricer than average, but it's honestly so worth it. Their crust is perfect and the service there is always super friendly"}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome.  Customer service - AWFUL.  Bonnie answers the phone every time I call.  Last time, she overcharged me and was not pleasant on the phone.  I called back to get the refund to my card - she told me sorry - she had a migraine and she can't function.  OK , that's good, we all have bad days.  Called again tonight and said \"hi, I would like to get a pizza delivered\"  Exact response \"umm, yeah, we close in 10 minutes\"  WHATEVER - there is other awesome pizza in town - don't need the phone attitude every time."}
{"text":"When i want to order pizza its sunday...Almost every Sunday night I call and they either say they're closed or they can't make my order.... Today they said they couldn't make ribs..... They told me they were out of them.... They have told me this every time I've called late... Their customer service is the worst. I feel so silly after I call...they make me feel like im wrong or stupid. My order is usually simple. ..but its always after 8 pm so I think the cooks/ employment are upset.  My husband is in restaurant industry and  thinks its strange that this happens every time we order...we ONLY ORDER FROM THEM BECAUSE WE LIVE 3 MIN AWAY. They are the only pizza place near where we live in Crocker Park.... And I feel like sometimes they take advantage of that."}
{"text":"After experimenting with different pizza places in the area, I've FINALLY found my spot ! The pizza has a PERFECT blend of sauce toppings and cheese, not to mention the taste is spectacular ... If a friend of mine from Vegas was here he'd quote it as \"sex in your mouth\" lol and that's how I'd have to describe the amazing taste of their pizza !! You won't be disappointed !!"}
{"text":"It's National Pizza Day!  No better way to celebrate than our local pizza joint. Pizza By Robert is our favorite non-chain pizzeria west of the city. 

Their pizza is always cooked just right. Crispy crust but never burnt, and the hint of sweetness in their sauce is an excellent addition. The crust reminds me of Pizza Hut but in a good way (crunchy)  

If your looking for a good hand tossed pizza check them out. Medium 1 Topping $9"}
{"text":"I decided to place another order here over the weekend. This time I just went with a large pizza with onion and pepperoni, traditional crust. This time, there wasn't too many topping to weigh down and cause my pie to be soggy. I did enjoy it and got a glimpse of what you people see in this Robert character. There was so much sauce on my pie, I had to take the cheese off and scrape my pizza on my plate to get off the globs of excess sauce. I would order it again, next time, light sauce.

Stay away from the taco pizza! (see my other review)"}
{"text":"Whoever compared this place to Angelo's should have his/her tastebuds checked...Angelo's has a sweeter sauce.  I had very high hopes for Pizza by Robert and it fell short.  Greasy and not much taste.  Almost kinda gummy (no chewiness or crunch to the crust).  If I want a zesty pizza sauce I go to Danny Boy's or Edison's.  If I want a sweet sauce I go to Angelo's."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, not great. Wings were terrible. We got through 2 and tossed them. The price is high and definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza tonight. Gave our credit card. Pizza delivery guy never showed up or bothered to ring our Bell or knock on our door. We were sitting 5 feet away on our couch. So we know he didn't show up. Guess the cavs game was just too important to actually deliver our $20 pizza. Tried calling but all of a sudden \"all circuits are busy\"  just lost at least a weekly pizza sale because we love the food but unfortunately our go to pizza place has failed us on POOR customer service. We've still been charged the  $20 and hungry.  And have to order Domino's. Yuck. But at least domino's showed up."}
{"text":"Would not take my Entertainment Book coupons off of my phone, although they obviously signed up for that option since it was offered. Wasn't very pleasant when not letting me use it either. Work on your customer service and don't offer things that you're not willing to provide"}
{"text":"I don't do many reviews on here, but this is definitely worthy of a 5-star rating...
I traveled Europe for 6 months and had plenty of great pizza, but kept craving PBR. 
Their crust is the tastiest out there, a great crunch but not brick hard.
Use of real cheese is evident in the taste.
Hands down my favorite pizza out there!"}
{"text":"Pizza tasted alright but ordered two pizzas one with burnt cheese and the other had a different topping we didn't order the person answered the phone was very rude and wouldn't refund us the money back only would give a gift card and after more slices we agreed it was bad and used it as fire wood"}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place!! Pizza is the. Best. And service is great too! Our last order ended up with a giant bubble in the pizza so they made us a bonus pizza to make up for it. I have celiac disease and I chose to deal with the aftermath and eat this pizza lol. Great place, we will be back again and again."}
{"text":"We have been a long time customer of Pizza By Robert until yesterday! This is the 3rd occasion they have messed up our order and our delivery was promised within 40 mins but it came 90 minutes later with now call stating the delay. The customer service their lacks training and the rudeness of their teenage staff is uncalled for! I will never order from Pizza By Robert again and will persuade all others to avoid it also!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PIZZA! I would consider this the top five pizza places in Cleveland
It goes like this.
1. Romitos-Independence
2. Capri Pizza-Off of Bagley
3. Pizza by Robert
4. Angelos-Lakewood
5. Danny Boys-River
With that being said......all of the above mentioned get substantial street cred in C-town but you never hear about Pizza by Robert.
WHY I LOVE IT:
+Great Sauce-Kinda has a sweetness to it like northern italy pies.
+Cheap-You cant beat the price
+Location-Easy in and out of this place with ample parking
+Toppings- You cant beat their meat!  The sausage and pepperoni are to die for.
OPNINION: GO GET A PIZZA THERE NOW!"}
{"text":"This is officially my favorite pizza place. Don't even bother with any big name pizza franchises. They always disappoint. The sauce is tangy, flavorful, salty deliciousness and that greasy, crispy yet soft and chewy crust melts in your mouth. 115 lb me polished off a half of a large pizza. Yaaaassssss. Worth every slice."}
{"text":"What a great pizza place this is.  With a saturated market, I would imagine any place that sustains itself has to be good or would just be lost in the shuffle of chain pizza places.  

So my wife and I decided to give it a try with this in mind.  The balance of toppings, cheese, and sauce was just perfect.  The sauce is no doubt what sets this place apart from the competition.  Very tasty with lots of spices."}
{"text":"2162242312 couldn't deliver a pizza or leave a voice mail guess they just lost a regular customer because they can't deliver"}
{"text":"Pizza is great cheesy goodness. Some of the best on the West side.  Occasionally the pizzas aren't as good though and I'm not sure why. Sometimes they seem to be undercooked and missing the juicy factor."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I haven't tried anything else from here, but the pizza is very good. The regular crust isn't bad by any means, but I'm a fan of the deep dish style pizza. It's a little on the greasy side, but that's the beauty of a deep dish!"}
{"text":"I love there pizza. Every time I bring it to or recommend it to friends and family, they love it too. People that stay with us from out of town ask for it by name. The crust is indescribable. The cheese and sauce are perfect match so I recommend the sausage and pep. or the supreme with fresh veggies."}
{"text":"Pizza by Robert is awesome! We eat here probably once every two weeks and haven't been disappointed by anything yet!  The pizza is made with awesome ingredients and is just so good.  Prices are pretty good and they always have a coupon for something.  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Always get the deep dish! You won't be disappointed! This is our go to pizza place in the Bay/River/Westlake area. Love the crust and the sauce. Delivery is fast but we pick up often too. I've only ever had one bad experience with an over cooked cheese pizza. It happens."}
{"text":"Pretty much nothing I liked about this pizza place. Here's the run down:

Small side salad was pre-washed bagged iceburg salad mix, tiny bag of croutons, and nasty packet ranch dressing. $5.

Pizza was very light on the toppings. Dough, raw. They remade it for us well done, and still...raw dough under the cheese. The owner informed us people in the Cleveland area actually like it even more undercooked than our first pizza! No. Cleveland. Just no.

The all time biggest offense? No breadsticks! A pizza joint with only overpriced sub bun garlic bread. No breadsticks. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Outstanding Food!


    We ordered a medium House Special pizza.  It was loaded with toppings and cooked to perfection.  The sauce had a nice hint of sweetness that offset the salty sausage.  We enjoyed it a lot!   We also ordered two Robb Salads (Their spin on the Cobb).  We didn't use any dressing because it tasted fresh and was packed with veggies.  The salad was on the small side and probably not enough for 2.  This was the one negative. 
     Overall, the food was spot on.  Even the delivery time was good!    I'll be ordering from them again for sure!    Give em' a try!"}
{"text":"My wife and I moved to Bay Village 4 months ago, and have been searching for a good go-to local pizza joint.  We've had some okay stuff, but nothing has really stuck out.  Pizza by Robert was personally, the best I've had yet.  Now, it can be tough to go off of certain reviews of pizza, because people can have vastly different preferences on how they like theirs.  I like simple, and good ingredients.  Yes, its very greasy, but such a thing does not bother me in the slightest when eating pizza.  It's pizza for goodness sake.  As others have said, the crust has a nice slight crunch on the outer edge, but not burnt.  The sauce has a sweetness to it, but still a bit of zest.  The biggest disappointment for me was the wings. They were some of the smallest wings I've seen, and they were almost squishy in texture.  Hard to explain.  The sauce was delicious though.  We went with the Robbie-Lou sauce, which is apparently all of their sauces mixed together.  One of the best wing sauces I've tasted, and we enjoyed dipping our pizza crust in the remnants.  I just wish they had better wings to put it on.  

I will definitely be back, as I loved the pie.  And knowing me, I will probably give the wings another go."}
{"text":"We call for delivery at about 9:45 pm.  The girl said they sent their driver home because he wasn't feeling well, so we ordered and picked up the food at their location.  We pulled up and the shopping center was not very well lit, so we thought they were closed.  They were indeed open.  The place was a little dingy, but the girl behind the counter was pleasant enough.  We had a cheese pizza and the pizza turn over.  The food was decent.  We would probably go back if back in town if there were not other options."}
{"text":"Has been a family favorite for YEARS. 
This is their Seafood Pizza. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"First time there, can't say we are disappointed what so ever! Pizza was delicious! We got a large veggie pizza with bacon and meatball extra sauce, well done. Staff was really welcoming and super friendly. Being in customer service for the last 12 years of my life, it's hard to come by. So I definately appreciate a happy, friendly staff! They also hooked me up with their garlic butter and they weren't stingy with it either. Garlic butter was extra garlicky and amazing! Crust was good, sauce was good! Not greasy at all which was REALLY nice! And I don't feel like crap after eating it either! Most definately ordering again and would recommend it to everyone! Now I'm an absolute brat and I will admit it, so take this with a grain of salt and I don't like every little detail of every little place (it's been far and wide that it's happened)..... If I had to make any complaints (and this is absolutely nit picking) I would say that the pizza wasn't well done and the although the toppings were good, most of it was falling off. Maybe put a little less and charge a little less for all those veggies. Also wasn't too impressed or happy about adding the meatball. But I usually don't order meatball on my pizza because it is usually disappointing unless I get it from Angelo's in Lakewood. But hey I took a chance and overall it was a great experience! If anyone is weary about trying a new place and not sure my best advice would be to absolutely order from this place! U won't b disappointed! Yummm!! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give them zero stars. Tried ordering their pizza for delivery. Girl who answered the phone was horribly rude and they won't deliver to Rocky River. More business for Danny Boys, etc. Good luck with that."}
{"text":"Good pizza, Italian sausage was my favorite topping here.  Small no frills dining room, delivery is better."}
{"text":"A friend came by with two large pizzas shortly after our group of 7 finished eating dinner, but it did not stop everyone from eating almost all of it! The pizza crust was so satisfying with a crispy finish and the toppings are plentiful and delicious. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Westlake, not the cheapest but worth the extra $."}
{"text":"Had the deep dish crust with mushrooms, onions, meatballs, and sausage. Very tasty, great crust with nice crunchy cornmeal on the bottom. Agree that you should request fresh mushrooms vs. canned. I'll be back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the Westlake/Bay area by far. We only eat pizza about  a half-dozen times a year, so when we do pizza, it's either make the trek to Angelo's in Lakewood or Pizza By Robert.
The Three Cheese Pesto on thin crust is amazing. Normally I'm go for pizzas with meat but this one always gets finished first.
A little more expensive than the \"McPizza\" chains, but to paraphrase: \"great pizza is not cheap; Cheap pizza is not good\"."}
{"text":"I'm from Atlanta and every time I come to Cleveland, I MUST stop by and get a pizza from here.  Hands down best crust of any pizza I've ever tried! Super crunchy bottom and delicious cheeses. Any chance y'all wanna deliver to ATL?! I'll pay!"}
{"text":"We ordered from here while visiting relatives and staying at a nearby hotel.  We were told the pizza, salad and wings would arrive in 45 minutes.  1 1/2 hours later it did arrive.  The wings we soggy and lukewarm and the pizza was completely burnt (picture attached for proof).  We couldn't believe someone actually let this pizza leave the store.  When we called to complain, they offered us a gift card.  We told them we were from out of town and just wanted a refund.  The woman on the phone told us we would have to bring the food back ourselves for a refund.  Seriously?  After waiting 1.5 hours?  The owner was there and we asked to talk to him but he wouldn't come to the phone.  Finally, we told them we would leave the food outside our door and they agreed to come pick it up.  Things go wrong, food gets messed up from time to time, but the way they dealt with it is still infuriating several days later.  The attitude and fact that the owner wouldn't get on the phone to speak with us speaks volumes.    We are also still waiting for the refund on our cc."}
{"text":"What can I say?  All around pretty darn good pizza.  I'm not a fan of big chain places and like that this is a family-owned place.  A tad bit greasy, but what do you expect when getting pizza?  So, Yay!  I'm a fan :)"}
{"text":"Folks are under the misconception that people from Chicago only love deep dish pizza.  Sorry, I'm a thin crust kinda girl. And so are a lot of my friends. Give us a pizza with sausage, green peppers and cheese and we're happy as can be. 

Pizza by Robert doesn't disappoint. They have a tasty thin crust (although they do offer deep dish). Not too buttery. The sausage was fresh but I really like their meatballs. They also have a nice pizza sauce. You could taste the tomatoes. I ordered the house special : meatball, sausage, onion and mushrooms. Pretty tasty. 

I also ordered a side salad. It's just wilted iceberg lettuce and a cucumber. Not a big deal but I expected a little more for $3. 

Price is a little, between $6-$31 depending on how many toppings or speciality pizzas. I think $8.95 for a 9\" pizza (equivalent to a small pizza) is pretty high. You can get a plain cheese for $6 but I gotta have my toppings. 

Service is fast. I called in the order and it was ready in 20 min. Small area to dine in, but it gets hot in there quickly because of the ovens. So I definitely recommend carry out or delivery."}
{"text":"This is definitely the pest pizza in the area. We used to get Romeos and at the time, we thought it was the best - since we've been going here, we can't stand to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Honestly yes. Just yes.
The sauce. The ratio to cheese. (I prefer really good sauce).
The crust.
The everything.

Ok my mouth is watering but just say yes to this place.
Also their calzones are good."}
{"text":"It is hit or miss with this place.
Ordered a supreme pizza with anchovies yesterday for Mother's Day. 

Good news:
It was delivered earlier than promised and the delivery person was pleasant.

Bad news:
The pizza had taste and assembly issues. The cheese tasted sour. There was a sliced pepperocini head with stem on the pizza. The anchovies were stale and there was barely any sauce on the pie crust. Then there is the issue of canned instead of fresh mushrooms-horrible.

I used to love their pizza, not so much anymore. I wonder what is going on. I won't be able to finish my pizza."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome.  Great pie and fantastic taste...the sweetness of the sauce is great with the grease of the meat and cheese.  Great job!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG 
You get a deep dish house special 
You will be tasked to find a better pie my friend!"}
{"text":"Truly EXCELLENT, unique tasting pizza!  Fresh, stringy cheese, perfectly balanced fresh aromatic sauce a bit on the sweet side, and a near perfect crust.  I drive there to pickup from North Olmsted once in a while.  You cannot dine in; it's pick up only.  'PBR' is one of the best 'fast food' type pizzas in NE Ohio.  Reminds me of some of the great tasting pizza pie's in the NYC and Jersey area, where I grew up.  MANGIA!"}
{"text":"Had their pepperoni pizza which was very good. It was a thin crust pizza with high-quality cheese and lean pepperoni. Definitely would order again."}
{"text":"Best delivery pizza on the westside!  My go-to pizza every time.  The pizza is good and never disappoints."}
{"text":"My last stop on our food tour of the western Cleveland suburbs came on our last night in town. After hanging out at Merry Arts for a good chunk of the afternoon, none of us really were in the mood to drive the three or four hours home. So my family and I reserved a few hotel rooms, picked up some beer, and ordered pizza from Pizza By Robert. There were actually a couple of other places that we considered but we decided on this shop based on favorable online reviews.

We all agreed on pepperoni and mushroom for our toppings and decided to order the biggest pizza available, the half sheet. This 24 slice monster is enough food to feed an entire family, and it did the job perfectly for us. The sauce that they used was traditional and very tasty. The cheese was also good and toppings were piled on high. It only cost $22.15, which seemed like a great price for the large amount of quality pie."}
{"text":"Best pizza! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE! Won't even call anymore. There's other places that treat their PAYING customers with some form of friendliness when you call! So disappointing that we won't come back, but first impressions go a LONG way!"}
{"text":"Blech ... burned pizza, greasy, and SO doughy. Not sure how this place gets all those good reviews."}
{"text":"The service was fast, the price was fair, but the quality of the pizza was only average. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely better than the big chain pizza places, but not by much."}
{"text":"I was home alone last night which rarely happens and I had a taste for pizza. After looking for coupons through the mail, I decided to try a pizza shop that I've never tried before...behold Pizza by Robert. 

I found a Medium 2 topping pizza for $11.15 which is definitely more expensive than a \"chain\" pizza place but I am OK with splurging for quality pizza rather than Papa Johns. I ordered over the phone and the guy who took my order was fast, efficient and was able to answer my questions. I ordered a Medium Deep Dish Pepperoni and Sausage Pizza for pick up (I never get delivery) and was  told a 15 minute pickup window. 

I arrived at the shop 15 minutes later on the dot and the pizza was just coming out of the oven, the staff was a bunch of teenagers and one older woman (all very nice). Pizza came out right after I paid. 

The pizza itself looked fantastic once I opened the box, although the crust wasn't what I was expecting when I took my first bite; it was actually better. The deep dish crust is almost like a Pan Pizza, has a good crunch and almost a buttery taste. This is also kind of a messy pizza to eat but enjoyable. The pizza could have used more sauce and maybe a little bit more cheese but I did think the toppings were exceptional. 

I doubt I will come here all the time with other pizza shops around to try but I will definitely be back once in a while."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Reasonable Pricing! Fast, Fast, Fast! Their sauce is great, its got that authentic flavor.

Stumbled into this parking lot on a drinking binge with a friend one time. Saw what looked like a no-name pizza joint, so we both got a pizza, and then ate them right there in the parking. Was so good we ordered 2 more pizzas for the road. 

About 2-3 months later in an attempt to reassure myself it wasn't the booze talking, I drove all the way up to Westlake just to order pizza from here.. it was just as good! Good work guys!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Well cooked and great flavor . We got take out and was ready fast! If you are visiting this area and staying in a local hotel I highly recommend !"}
{"text":"The first time I tried this place, I was moving. Like... we don't even know where the dishes are anymore so we need to eat out of the cardboard box. I absolutely hate chain pizza places, so Yelp! steered me in the direction of Roberts. 

It's solid pizza. It doesn't taste like chain-cardboard. The ingredients are fresh... and they have an amazing pesto pizza. 

It's greasy. I feel like it would be the ultimate hangover pizza. But, it's really greasy. In a way that you just don't feel good about yourself after you've eaten it (at least when you're sober). But, it tastes good in the moment."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! The pizza tastes so good due to all the ingredients being high quality and very fresh. That's the most important thing places usually skimp out on the fact that the ingredients aren't high quality. Bottom line is the place is great!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!  It's just as good as Angelo's in Lakewood.  Fresh ingredients and dough made daily.  Both the traditional dough and deep dish are excellent!  Although the deep dish is a bit greasy, it's still very tasty!

Check their website for coupons!"}
