{"text":"Bottomline: Great food, healthy choices, nice ambience, but mediocre service  We came from Hamilton for a b-day dinner.  Excellent in terms of presentation, flavour, and taste. One of the best veg places I've been to and I've been to a lot.  We ordered for food the Burstin' burito (the best), Nachos, Coconut curry noodles. Mediterranean starter, Beet Ravoli and Chocolate Ganache mint cake. For drinks pink lady, muddy waters and green juice. All excellent. Compliments to the chef. She was busy tonight and the food came in good time. Totaling 130 dollars. We don't mind spending more on quality organic foods.   Front of house is definitely the biggest let down. Not very friendly, welcoming, and on top of things. Perhaps they need two people t work on Fridays and Saturday nights. Not a mention of house specials, drink refreshments, or checking in or even a bid farewell. For a smaller intimate restaurant you would expect a bit more."}
{"text":"So my experience at Raw Aura started off on the wrong foot when my friend and I were not greeting once we came in. We sat ourselves down and received a glass water, which later we found out would be the ONLY glass we got all night, no refills. We asked to be seated outside once there was a spot available, but later saw another couple ask to be seated outside instead and our server took them, although we asked 5-10 minutes prior. Once our food came, we were never asked if we were enjoying our meals, didn't bring the condiment I asked for, and failed delivering the most basic of customer service skills. The food was good but the service was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Zucchini noodles, cheeseless cheesecake and tree rings ahoy! No raw deal at Raw Aura, just some auspiciously awesome vegan eats.   Knowing my predilection for raw food, my buddy found me Raw Aura to cure our Humpday blues. Delicious food, but where is my coffee?  ATMOSPHERE  Raw Aura's exposed wood and hip industrial-chic hits the right vibes and jives with their healthy hip-nerd cuisine. We particularly loved the lacquered tree-ring tables (despite their diminutiveness). It looked like the tabletops were all cut from the same tree. Want!   Verdict: Good for a hip date or for impressing your food-adventuring posse.  FOOD  Zucchini noodles are the best. Great bang for the buck and tasty to boot. My Coconut Curry Noodles were creamy and delicious, piled artistically high. My friend, a raw food newb, was unprepared for how filling her faux Bolognese was, because it sure hit the spot.   Comparatively, I enjoy the Rawlicious Bolognese more, but my curry was better than their faux Pad Thai.   Biggest drawback? No coffee! I wanted coffee so bad with our blueberry cheeseless cheesecake, which was the best thing about our meal hands down. But oh, how I dreamed of a decaf almond milk coffee whilst eating it.  SERVICE  Attentive but so so. Not much to say here, except that my girls at Rawlicious are nicer. That's not just my bias talking.  LOCATION  Port Credit's main drag is far from being a drag. Past the skeevy motels, darkened factories and stretches of yawning black harbour on Lakeshore is a beautiful, antique-feeling strip of joints both hip and hometown.  A pleasant surprise and one to make my Markham heart burn with envy.   Worth at trip at some point, but too far to make it a regular occurrence, so says the Markhamite!  OVERALL  Good raw vegan with a seriously hip atmosphere that I want in my Imaginary Million Dollar Condo. If in Port Credit and craving some zucchini noodling, noodle on over here and enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. One can't believe that vegan food can be this good. The pizza I had was so delicious. All ingredients feel fresh. I was debating whether to write this review as I wouldn't want this place to get too crowded. Lol."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I love the available dishes.  The food is creative, flavorful, and always a tasty, visually amazing treat.  I love the drink choices as well.    Minus one star for small, squishy, uncomfortable seating.  Although a super cool vibe, you need to constantly excuse yourself for sitting in a chair during the busy dinner hour."}
{"text":"Best raw vegan restaurant in Mississauga so far. The staffs are amazing. Food here is very good, depends on your taste of course. I'm vegan myself and I really liked the zucchini spaghetti with olives flavoured sauce. Second time I tried the vegan lasagna and it's something to brag about. I've also tried their chocolate avocado cake, chocolate banana cake and blueberry cheese cake. Blueberry cheese cake is the best :)"}
{"text":"The best chocolate cake u will ever eat!!! Too filling for 1. Made from avacado! Spectacular...  The chef here is a genius. Everything is delicious filling and satisfying and I have no idea how they achieve this will every dish, all RAW!   PS: I am FAR from a \"health nut\" by any means, so if I think is good, it's fabulous."}
{"text":"This is our 4th time at Raw Aura.  The food is so good that we are eating at the bar today which we don't normally do (they squeezed us in)..    Ordered the Avocado Tartar, soo good!  I then had the Yellow Coconut Curry Zucchini \"Noodles\" and my wife ordered the Pad Thai, both hard choices as you want to eat it all.  Wishing that they open more locations!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you are seeking fresh delicious food.  Very good for dietary needs as their menu is gluten, dairy and sugar free.  The Burrito was fantastic, the guacamole made the dish!!  I'm not vegan or even vegetarian but it was no trouble finding something great to eat!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly amazing! Which is HUGE coming from a noted carnivore. This was my first raw experience, but the birthday girl got to pick, and I'm always up for trying new places. This experiment definitely paid off. We shared the avo tartare to start. Simple, fresh ingredients, with chucks of creamy avocado. But the highlight of this course was the homemade breadsticks - a mix of sesame, pumpkin seeds and other grains to give it almost a crunchy, granola texture - amazing! I totally bought some to take home. However, the pièce de résistance was the yellow coconut curry noodles. Thin slices of zucchini, marinated in yellow curry (a bit heavy on the saffron) and coconut oil was a different take on noodles for me, but SO good. The addition of pineapple and red peppers, and the generous heap of coconut piled on top gave it a nice depth and sweetness. I had no idea raw food could be so delicious! The chocolate banana cake looked amazing, but was way too stuffed by then. Will definitely go back to try that and the kale chips."}
{"text":"The highest quality food that tastes amazing with awesome service as well! It really is the best RAW food restaurant in the GTA, hands down.  They aren't just chefs, they are artists who create masterpieces!  The atmosphere is absolutely wonderful, I love the whole vibe that is felt there. Please remember people that it's always better to support our local business owners/communities versus funding franchises/corporations that TRY to imitate them yet they'll never truly succeed. In my opinion, they under charge for all that they offer to us as customers. Overall it's a real fair price.                                                                  *FYI*  Rawlicious menu is nothing compared to the Raw Aura menu, yet the prices are about the same..?"}
{"text":"If, I mean, WHEN I'm a rich celebrity I will hire the peeps here to be my personal chefs! The food here is amazzzzzzing and my dream menu that I could eat from every day. Highly reco the drive for all the Toronto peeps as this is the BEST vegan joint in the GTA and Port Credit is a gem. Quality and originality and taste is spectacular. Dream me u I tell you, DREAM MENU!!!"}
{"text":"\"Raw Aura\" is so good! I'm so impressed by a restaurant that can make food delicious without animal products or sugar and in some cases (maybe all) gluten. I had a \"pasta\" special - zucchini noodles with red pepper, mushrooms, arugula in a cashew cream sauce and \"Parmesan\" sprinkled on top. It was excellent. For dessert I had the chocolate banana cake. Which was even better. It's nice to feel energetic and not bloated after eating out. I highly recommend this restaurant. And I'm not even a vegan!"}
{"text":"Overall, food and earth friendly atmosphere were great. Service was highly attentive. I would definitely eat here for appetizers and smoothies again, even though I'm not a vegan or vegetarian.  The lemon smoothie was the perfect balance of sweet and sour. By far the best kale chips (with sour cream and onions) I've ever had. Mediterranean appetizer was also tasty, with the dark brown being better than the light brown sticks. Pasta olive entre was decent, but nothing to die for.   4 stars because entre could be better flavor wise (large, not finely chopped ingredients) but 5 stars in all other elements, including menu originality and beautiful plating."}
{"text":"Loved the food!  It was different but good.  WORD OF WARNING:  If you are not used to taking in that many raw veggies in one sitting you may need a bathroom immediately following your meal.  Plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Here's the Real Deal.   I came upon this place by accident. I had the munchies I was hungry but I didn't want a burger I didn't want pizza I didn't want Brito Boyz I wanted something healthy. There it was RAW AURA . So I said why not. Let's start with the decor earth tones which I love. I sat at the bar to watch the Chef. Great presentation we'll prepare and clean kitchen very clean.  I ate the ravioli which was to die for, filling and so much taste. I also had the kale chips OMG wow ! I ate a brownie which I was told the almond bar was better. So I went for the brownie and I loved it. So even though this restaurant has been there for five years. They have a great menu great service good-looking servers great presentation and great decor  I'm all in !!!  So next time you're on a drive, going through Port Credit and looking for something that's not a dive and Great prices that has Great food and it's raw and you feel like a champ after eating it! Then this is the place.   Enjoying good food one place at a time :-)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I always get the falafel wrap. Never had a wrap in a leaf before.  Recommended."}
{"text":"First time at a raw restaurant.  My little boy is a newly declared vegan (most of the time) and we wanted to surprise him with a treat.  Got in right away (we were there at 8:45 on a Saturday - I imagine it might be harder at peak times - it's tiny but they do take reservations).  Fantastic summer night and we sat on the bench at the open window.  Food:       Great. Started with kale chips that have a cashew sour cream on them - at first son said he liked my baked ones better but he got into them right away - they crumble easily but are very good.      Son had a huge bowl of miso soup with sea vegetables and some sort of clear noodle - he finished all of it - it was at least a quart.  DH had curry noodles which were subtle, not too spicy and good, and I had pad thai which was heavy in ginger and nuts but also good. We would order all of them again.      We had a creamsicle smoothie and a cinnamon toast crunch smoothie.  Very filling. We were fasting and broke our fast with this and then sat around with full tummies.  Service:      Meh. Waitress seemed to be the only one left at that time, and she was busy.  Very friendly to my son and he got a kick out of telling her \"yeah I'm vegan too\".  Took about 10 minutes it seemed to get a few glasses of water, and a while to get the check, but she was nice without smothering, and met our needs. We tipped well, mostly cause she was so nice to my son and told him he did a good job on his soup.  Prices:      A bit steep - total for appetizer, 2 smoothies and 3 entrees was 71$. Couldn't do it every week, but as we were visiting in town and it was a treat it was fine.  Desserts looked great but we were full (of course as soon as we left we saw the sign down the street for Scoops and DH got a waffle cone & two scoops and Son got a scoop of rainbow sherbet - maybe we undid all the raw goodness) but we would all like to come back sometime for a dessert tasting.  Will likely be back next time in Mississauga."}
{"text":"All in all this is a great location. I'm in town once in a while and this is a normal stop for me. The location is a bit small so you have to catch them at a good time but the food is worth it. Also the deserts are my favorite part of this place. So if you here visiting or live here if recommend this location highly ."}
{"text":"First time we've been here. Very good. Portions were decent. Presentation was very nice. Had the olive pasta special. Great. At our table we also had nachos, taco salad, sweet n sour noodles, apple crumble, cheese cake and almond butter bar. The cheesecake was the only thing that did not please. Next time I'll probably pass on desert but the rest of the meal was good. The chefs are very detail oriented and the serving staff pleasant."}
{"text":"Raw gem in the heart of Port Credit. They have many options and the menu is SO creative. I wanted to get almost everything on it! My friend and I over ordered - our eyes and mouths did not match! We wanted to try as much as possible but due to the fact this is REAL food, it is very filling. Had a juice, \"ravioli\" and a olive paste dish. It was very olive-y, definitely great for someone who likes these black olives. Will be back!"}
{"text":"My first Raw Food Outing with my friend Paulette Lewis.   The Green Juice was excellent. Very earthy, not sweet.  There's an Apple version which adds sweetness.   The Taco Salad was hearty and delicious.   Paulette had the Nachos, she made me one, yummy!  Definitely a destination dining experience. I look forward to returning and returning until I've tried it all.  Beyond yummy!!"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this place and now can finally say that I have. I had the falafel wrap and almond bar to follow. The wrap was amazing. Everything was extremely fresh and VERY tasty and had a little zing to it. The almond bar was better than any almond anything I've ever had! They should re-name this to something more just. The staff was extremely friendly and helped me pick what to eat based on my hunger level.  A lot of people think that without meat and wheat there is no flavour - I dare them to try this place!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday lunch and was sadly thoroughly disappointed. I expected Better from the raving reviews online. My order was their Sweet and Sour Noodles, but I felt I was eating an overly sweet, bland cream sauce - there was absolutely no trace of their asserted \"tangy almond butter sauce\". Flavours all fell flat for me. My friend did, however, enjoy his Burstin' Burrito and from my tasting of my other friend's Pad Thai Noodles, they were decent. Don't come here expecting a good value for your meal!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. I was really nervous I am a big meat eater but it didn't matter the food was so tasty and innovative. We ordered the falafel and the daily pizza. Everything was good we should have just split one dish so we could enjoy the awesome dessert. I live in North York so it's not close but it's worth the drive I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for forever but had a hard time convincing someone to go try it out with me. I finally talked it up enough to a friend and we went to check it out together this afternoon for lunch. I have to say, this place is not just good for a vegan restaurant. It's good period.  We both agreed after eating way too much that we had just had the best eating experience we've ever had in our lives. The owner was very friendly when we walked in and she sat us at the bar where we had a very nice time talking about food with the chef.  It was fun to watch how he put together each dish and he was very friendly and explained the components of each plate he put out.  We started with the kale chips. They were so good.  Crunchy, salty, cheesy, and perfect.  We ended up ordering two mains and splitting them. My friend ordered the pad Thai and I ordered the Alfredo on special. We were both blown away at the balance of flavors along with the texture in each dish. We were full but couldn't help ordering some dessert. We had the blueberry cheesecake and the almond crunch bars. The cheesecake was creamy and not too sweet. A perfect balance and the almond crunch bars I could eat every day. They were absolutely incredible. Hands down if you are wondering about this place just go and check it out. You will not be disappointed. We are already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"Man! Very few places can do justice with vegan food. I am a hardcore carnivore and If I am eating meatless food, it better be at top of its game. Needless to say, this place did not make me crave for meat while eating.  If I had to describe this place in one word, it would be - 'flavour'. Usually, at vegan or even vegetarian friendly places, you can easily find uniquely named dishes but to add unique flavour to them is altogether a different ballgame. This place has that value proposition.  We had - Nachos - must try, they are not the usual run of the mill nachos that you get at a bar. The cashew sour cream and the nutty thing they are served with was really delicious.   Smoothie - Meh, we had the choco-holic and the cinnamon toast crunch but they were ok. Only reason I did not give this place a five on five.   Noodle bowls - we tried coconut curry and sweet & sour noodles. Both were unique and flavourful. They were really heavy and by the end of our meal, I was happily fed and dead.   There were other things on the menu that I could easily have tried so I will definitely go to this place again."}
{"text":"Continues to be a great raw restaurant. It's out of the way if you live in downtown Toronto but that just makes the trip all the more special."}
{"text":"Finally. Finally. Finally. I had the pleasure of visiting this highly touted, hidden Raw Vegan spot in the bustling 'burb of Port Credit. That is a sentence I never thought I would speak or write in my life, seriously.  Admittedly, I'm about as vegan as a 40oz Porterhouse topped with lamb chops and wrapped in bacon. But I stand by my motto of always being willing to give everything a try once (it's almost never steered me wrong). While this wasn't my first raw vegan experience, it was my first in the 905. After reading some of the tantalizing reviews written by several elite pals, Raw Aura has been on my bookmark list for almost 2 years! The issue that kept me from visiting is I was a little gun shy to visit on my own and anytime I recommended it to friends, the response was.... \"well I'd rather have meat\".  Last night all the green stars aligned and I not only managed to visit but managed to bring an actual vegan friend along for the ride - I knew this experience would be best by bringing someone who would appreciate it and I was right. We ordered all the food things!  To start we had the Kale Chips, which were puffy, crispy, salty and somehow a little bit cheesy (picture white cheddar flavour), AND an order of vegan nachos! The kale chips were great but the vegan nachos were what really impressed me. Picture deconstructed nachos with a row of guacamole, cashew sour cream (no different in taste from the real sour cream), walnut taco meat and a fresh tomato salsa. Save for the lack of cheese, this was as good as some of the best non-vegan nachos I've ever had.  My dining companions had the Pizza (Sprouted buckwheat and sunflower seed flax crust topped with the chef's daily market toppings) and Ravioli (Red beet ravioli are stuffed with a creamy cashew ricotta cheese, red pepper marinara sauce and crisp dehydrated kale chips) respectively, while I went back to my Italian roots and had the Pasta Bolognese.  If you're a pasta snob like me, then you're very specific about your pasta, but knowing that this was made with Zucchini noodles tossed in a rich house-made tomato red pepper basil marinara sauce, sunflower seed and sun dried tomato sausage, topped with almond parmesan, I was prepared for it to be a little different then my usual carb and meat fiesta. Different was definitely awesome, the freshness and flavours of this dish were unmatched, truly a culinary delight!  The food alone wins them 4 stars but they earn the extra 5th star for price and staff. Where can you realistically get a gourmet dinner main for under $15? I'm not sure which server others are having issues with but our server was super accommodating and friendly. Despite showing up 15 minutes before closing, they were welcoming and did not rush our meal at all. Very appreciative of their hospitality  While I'm not going to be giving up my omnivore ways anytime soon, Raw Aura definitely makes an extremely strong case for including a few extra delicious vegan meals to my rotation as they can be as good (if not better) than some of the meals they model themselves after.  VEGANCREST Out! ;)  PS - next time, the cheese cake is going down. Apparently it's a must"}
{"text":"When we first walked into this place, it promised to be EXACTLY what we hoped it would be. We had HIGH hopes that the food would be as perfect as the decor, the ambiance, the service and the location.  While Raw Aura is a very cool place to have lunch, the lunch itself really did not hit the spot for us. While the food was super healthy and made exclusively from fruits, vegetables, seeds and nuts (no gluten, sugar or cooking whatsoever), it didn't sit too well. After a couple of bites we were stuffed and then about an hour later, both of us were feeling a little sick to our stomachs.  While this place seems to have everything going for it, I didn't end up being a fan of the food. Maybe it's just not my thing, but you'll have to decide for yourself."}
{"text":"As this was my first time having a raw food meal, i don't have much to go off, but this was amazing. I couldn't have asked for a better meal. As far as vegan foods go this was the top of the charts. The atmosphere was deffinatly chill, aswell. I had the avo tartare, to start. It was very satisfing, i would compare it to almost a chutney, as i have never had another tartare. It was very flavourfull, i had the miso soup as a main, which i thouroughly enjoyed. My partner had the pasta bolognese, which he seemed to really enjoy and tasted excellent to me. I loved the 'crunch' that all these dishes had to offer. I also thought the plating really made the meal and the vibe of the resturant. I regret not getting the New Years Eve Prix Fixe, but i will be most deffinatly coming here again and widening my raw horizions."}
{"text":"I came here the other night and had a really good experience. Everything was gluten and dairy free, which made me super happy.   The waitress was really nice and the menu was quite extensive. We ordered the chocolate mint ganache cake and the almond butter cups. By the time our food came I wasn't feeling the best but I still tried the desserts. I really enjoyed my cake. The chocolate topping was a little too rich but once I removed some of it I really enjoyed the cake. It had a nice texture and the base was made out of walnuts and dates. It was a nice light sweet treat.   My friend's almond butter cups were a bit too sweet for me but they were still good. I can imagine I would like them more if my stomach wasn't hurting.  I would definitely love to come back to try their dinner menu. They also have an extensive tea menu with 12 different varieties."}
{"text":"Really good food. Recommend there ravioli. It was fantastic. The service was great and the chef seemed very happy when preparing food. I got their mint chocolate ganache. Wasn't a fan. I couldn't find the mint and the texture wasn't that great. Besides the dessert would recommend the food. Everything I had was so tasty."}
{"text":"I enjoyed tasting this tasty vegetarian menu I had a great avocado salad and lots of other dishes during my many visits I was always impressed by the food and nice friendly seevice I definitely recommend for a casual evening out"}
{"text":"So this place was OUT OF THIS WORLD!  First, I went to the Greek restaurant across the street and was mortified by the fact that only meat options were available.  So, what is a sad vegan to do?  Well, I continued on my travels down the block to look for nourishment.   Not 30 yards away is this gem Raw Aura.  The restaurant is a quaint, busy little hole-in-the-wall cafe.  I went right at lunch hour (12pm).  The chef looked like an artist creating a masterpiece.  He was not rushed, or bothered by the noise/business.  If you are reading this Mr Chef, you are fantastic and I will dream about your delicious art tonight.    I ordered the Mediterranean Platter and the Nachos.  Heavenly.  I never had a chance to try the smoothies or desserts, though I plan on it ASAP. The service was good - not outstanding but considering the heavy traffic, I'll let it slide.  The server was very friendly but definitely was moving quickly to be able to serve everyone in a timely manner.  Highly recommended and a must-try when in the area.  PS:  do not let the seemingly small portions fool you - the food is extremely filling and nutrient dense.  You will be lucky if you have room for dessert."}
{"text":"I am a carnivore. Most of my meals revolve around a meaty centerpiece. And whether that is lamb, chicken, beef, pork or fish I don't really care, but rarely do I ever eat any vegetarian dishes.  Indian Food is the first thing that comes to mind when I think about things I've eaten without meat. Or a chunky Greek salad. A grilled-cheese sandwich. A mushroom-swiss omelet. Things like that.  Then my friend invites me out to dinner for his Mom's birthday. Awesome. Where are we going? Raw Aura. Uhhh... where?  So I get there, and the name says it all: all the food is raw. Yes. Raw. Hasn't been cooked. And no meat. And no dairy. Not only that but most of the dishes are either cold or warm.  As the four of us entered I was actually being teased due to my carnivore-ness, and under duress I decided I should appease the masses for the next hour or so, and we could go for burgers or ribs after for some REAL food.  To start my friend ordered a round of Nachos (veggiefied chips  made from carrots, flax, and whatever else it needed to give it a crispy texture, because remember: everything is uncooked). The chips come with hummus, guacamole, a tomato salsa and another sauce.  While those were being prepared we ordered two of their Falafels (uncooked chick peas, filled with some veggie goodness and wrapped in a leafy green) a chickpea stew (that night served without chickpeas, but with mung and another bean instead), and a veggie lasagna.  They also had a impressive variety of fresh juices, with Mill St. organic beer available.  So we talk, and I nervously await our uncooked dinners I'm not too keen to try.  The nachos arrive. Wow. impressive! So the chips are quite tasty, as are all the sauces. Nothing is cooked and yet things are looking up!  Then the main courses arrive, and I was instantly impressed by the plating before I even try anything.   Each of our dishes - especially my Falafel - looks like great care went into its presentation. Not only that but the flavours are quite good, everything is fresh of course, and the portions are substantially sized for adults.  We're stuffed, but decide to share two desserts: Blueberry Cheesecake and Pecan Pie. And yes, remember that there is no dairy here, nor did the cheesecake taste like soy milk (which I actually like anyway).  Walking out of this place - after a single beer - I was absolutely stuffed. And did not regain my usual post-meal hunger until the next morning... as opposed to later that night.  Needless to say I was impressed by this place, enough to write this review. I have never done this. Not even for proper meat restaurants!  Veggies, you may not have convinced me that I need to give up meat, but you definitely impressed me with what you can do with uncooked food.  So Carnivores: give Raw Aura a try just to see how the other side lives, because there's really no better way.  All the mains are $15 or less, and there are enough options that you should find something to appease your palette.  Service is polite with a smile, the decor is comfortable and it's just a fun place to try - with or without your vegan friends."}
{"text":"Food here is fesh, beautifully presented, and flavourful. The decor is really nice too - the table was a section of tree trunk! Had the kale chips, burstin burrito, and yellow curry zucchini noodles. Service was efficient and food came out quickly. Price point is a bit on the higher end for lunch.  The bowl of kale chips were quite sizeable, and super tasty (cheesy flavour). They had just the right amount of crisp. Considering the price of a bag of kale chips in supermarkets/health food stores, I thought the kale chips at raw aura were reasonably priced for the quantity and quality ($8). The burrito was delicious - fresh and balanced. As for the zucchini noodles, I actually wasn't a big fan of the yellow curry sauce, but otherwise found the noodles and other ingredients to be good. Next time I'd want to try the bolognese or pad thai."}
{"text":"I have to confess that before trying this place I didn't get the raw food movement.  Having said that, I had an absolutely fabulous meal!  Pasta Bolognese and Curry Thai Noodle dishes we tried were absolutely fantastic!  The place is tiny but quaint.  We also had a Beet me up and muddy waters juices and they were also good.  Save room for the chocolate banana cake!!!  Definitely worth repeat trips!"}
{"text":"So fresh and flavourful! Walking in its a cute and cozy spot with wooden accents everywhere. I walked in with two friends and made the mistake of not making a reservation on a Friday night (1 hour wait). Luckily they take your phone number so you can walk outside while you await their phone call.   We got a patio seat and ordered three dishes to share. I was most worried about the food not being filling enough (not a vegan) but to my surprise all three of us were full by the end of it! I'd say the most disappointing thing the food could've been served hot instead of room temp/cold!!   The pizza had a nice mix of fresh veg on top with great flavours. Cons: the crust isn't very crisp like I was expecting Next was the Yellow Coconut Curry Noodles. The curry sauce was so flavourful and overall the dish had a nice mix of components. The coconut flakes, lentils and lentils made it hearty with a nice added freshness of pineapple pieces and peppers. This was my first try with zucchini pasta--- for a carb/starch lover, I wasn't mad at it! This dish is worth a try!  My favourite was the Ravioli. Such a great mix of flavour and textures with that awesome cashew ricotta filling! A beautiful presentation as well.   Overall I'm giving it 4 because if this food was served hot it would be so much more satisfying at dinner time. I'd say go at lunch because it's not super heavy. This fresh food truly makes you feel good after!! Highly recommend going if you want to try a unique vegan eat"}
{"text":"I came here with a few girlfriends and we ordered a bunch of items to share.  Everything was delicious and service was great!"}
{"text":"I had the wonderful opportunity to be dragged into this restaurant. Such cuisine is definitely not up my alley and i had little hope of liking this place but i am officially blown away. The restaurant had a very laid back organic feel and lovely calm setting. Great place for a late brunch with girlfriend to catch up. We ordered 4 dishes and shared amongst 3 people, we were decently satisfied leaving. The pad thai was a group fav...it had a wonderful fresh delightful taste. The kelp noodle lends a uniquely surprising crunch while the light dressing uses kelp seaweed to simulate the taste of fish sauce. The taste was well balanced between sweet, tartness, and salt, the texture was crisp and refreshing with a fresh mouth feel. Next we tried the avo tartare which was also very pleasing. Tasting almost like a light version of chunky guacamole, it was well paired with the bread sticks. The beet ravioli was very beautiful. It had a surprising tart kick to it and but not overwhelming. We also tried the yellow coconut curry noodle. My least favorite of the meal, albeit a personal preference thing. It was refreshing with surprises of pineapple pcs to lend its sweetness. The zucchini noodles were refreshing and with the addition of the coconut milk gave the yellow curry its light creamy taste. I particularly enjoyed [of all 4 dishes] the gorgeous colours that made these dishes so much more aesthetically pleasing-the vibrance can be tasted, smelt and seen. The meal was a bit on the pricier side but i loved the experience. I left feeling full but not bloated. This experience should be on a bucket list for anyone that loves food or any self proclaimed foodie. As a person that's definitely identified as predominately carnivore, I am glad to have this experience and will definitely be back. It's just one of those examples of good food done right - regardless."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant, it was a busy Friday night, although everywhere else was 100% more busy (which I do not understand) The service was quick and welcoming, and the food was out of this world, especially considering it was all made in house. Some may say it is expensive, but when comparing it to chain restaurants like Jack Astors, the prices are pretty much the same and the food and service is much better here. To top the cake, our server made the cake I had for desert herself!"}
{"text":"Great meal! Passing by on our way from Buffalo to Toronto. It's a tiny spot but we got a table for two right away. The Mediterranean plate was delicious. My favorite were the crunchy breadsticks. We both got a huge bowl of Miso soup too. Yum! Great decor too."}
{"text":"I would easily give this place 5 starts for the food.  The Asian cook/chef was amazingly friendly and provided recommendations since it was my first time here.    As for my actual server, I felt she was pretty cold to me. She told me to sit myself anywhere that was for a table of two (it was just me), so I graciously sat in the corner which was probably the most uncomfortable spot.  I was ready to order and it took her about 5 minutes to pour me water.  I ordered the sweet and sour noodles, which were absolutely delicious.  When the server arrived at my table, I still didn't even have a napkin and had to get it myself.  I also asked for a spoon (because I wanted to scoop the nuts from the bottom and only had chopsticks) and she gave me a dirty look.  I felt so uncomfortable here. When I was checking out, she said if I was paying with debit, just walk up to the front. So I did that after a few minutes or just relaxing after finishing my meal.    When I did, she said \"I have to finish this credit card transaction first\" in a bit of a snarky voice to me.  It honestly made my morale go down. Maybe I'm sensitive.  So while the food is good, I don't think I'll ever dine here again because of this waitress (and it seems like many people on Yelp have complained about her too).   Food - 5/5 Service: 1.5/5 (the 1.5 is for the chef being so friendly..0 for the waitress)."}
{"text":"My favroute spot in Port Credit.  A rare find.  Each dish is carefully crafted with choice organic and locally sourced ingredients.  The entire menu is gluten free, dairy and sugar free.  When feeling a bit chilled, Miso Me warms you from the inside out, and, I love the creativity Yellow Coconut Curry Noodles dish.  Save some space for dessert...blow your socks off yummy.  Be prepared to wait for a table or make a res, this joint is fantastic."}
{"text":"Raw Aura was absolutely incredible. I didn't expect this from vegan food at all, and this is an amazing place if you want to try something new and healthy.   I've never had vegan or even vegetarian food for that matter but Raw Aura has definitely made me a fan.  We started with the kale chips in sour cream and onion flavor and they were great. I was suprised at just how much they gave! It's big heaping portion in a deep bowl. There's almost no way you can finish them with two people so we ended up taking them home (the perfect snack!).  We ended up getting two noodle dishes and were blown away just how much flavor there was. And not only there's a lot of flavors, they are authentic flavors. We ended up getting the yellow coconut curry noodles and the pad Thai and both had flavors that would rival  most Thai restaurants; and they're not even cooked! The first bite was phenomenal, just an explosion of flavors - the tamarind really shines here in the pad Thai. We did find it a bit sweet (especially nearing the bottom of the dish where there is a lot of sauce, and the zucchini noodles really picking it up). The curry and coconut flavors were wonderful in the other dish and reminded me of Khao soi. Except the zucchini noodles were nice and had some crunch to them. Doeep in mind all these dishes are cold and they don't cook anything here, which was one of the questions we had.   I love the atmosphere here, it's quaint and there's a lot of charm. The tables are made from tree trunks! The service was really friendly and our waitress explained everything very well!"}
{"text":"Great spot for Awesome Raw food, really you won't  be disappointed, i am planning to try everything on the menu. The food is delish. Small outdoor patio in the Summer."}
{"text":"I thought for certain I had written a review about this place previously but I see that I did not! I feel bad as I do not think I can list everything we had off the menu the first time now, but I am going to try! First impression walking in is that this place is small with a hipster vibe, pretty fitting for the type of food. It gets quite warm inside so layer clothes to ensure you stay comfortable. They fill up to capacity on typical busy nights so be aware of that and it is best for people in pairs to maybe a group of four. The space is a bit too 'intimate' aka tight for me to consider having a large group come for dinner. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. I remember our first visit we got the Nachos, and they are not as you would expect them to be and that is not to say bad. The chips them are not the typical nacho chip because, duh, the raw ingredients! They were very tasty and we were happy that we got them. For the main we got the pizza, at this point I cannot for the life of me remember the toppings but they do daily market toppings any ways so you may not have the same option we did any ways.  The thing I really recall about the first visit is that when we left we both had this weird body buzz. I have no clue what caused it but there is not other way to describe it; you felt like your body was buzzing and light.  I have recently taken the plunge from Vegetarian to cutting out dairy as well. So feeling slightly dessert deprived we came here for cake! I had heard great things about their dessert so I was excited to see how many options there were! The staff member recommended the chocolate banana cake and the almond ball. The cake was really nice, it was light almost like a mousse the banana really stood out. The almond ball was good as well but over priced. The cake was 8.00 (totally reasonable) the ball was 3.00. When you compare what you are getting  size wise for the two items the ball should really be 2.00.  I need to come back to try some more items off the menu, they are way better than Rawlicious for which you can find my review on here.  I recommend for all Vegetarians and Vegans, and anyone willing to give whole food, and clean eating a try."}
{"text":"I have dined here a couple times, and every time it was delightful! I've basically sampled every mains on their menu, so if you want to go towards the \"safer route\", I would suggest either the Bursting Burrito or Yellow coconut curry noodles.   oh yes - Try the kale chips, it will change your life! :)"}
{"text":"Now I'm not much of a chef at all and my culinary repertoire is limited to the half-dozen or so recipes that I've managed to memorize over many years. In spite of this everything was going fine until I moved in with my girlfriend, now fiancée. Even though she is obviously amazing, whatever skills I did have in the kitchen were basically thrown out the window on account of her being gluten and lactose intolerant, with my vegetarianism even further complicating matters. Thankfully, Raw Aura is just down the street and if I hopelessly mess up a romantic dinner, we have a great fallback.  The place itself isn't very big and I would highly recommend calling ahead, especially on a Friday or Saturday night. The service is a little laid back, but very helpful and pleasant so I can't complain. And for not being cooked, the raw food did take quite a while to get to us the last time we were there, but the place was full so I'll cut them some slack...besides, it was worth the wait.  As far as the apps go, the beet ravioli is the clear standout. It is fantastic. I like beets, my fiancée not so much but it didn't matter in the end...you can hardly taste any beets in the dish at all. The creamy \"cashew ricotta cheese\" is excellent and even though it doesn't quite taste like real cheese, who cares? It's an outstanding dish and one that I'll go back to again and again. The Big Salad, however, is best avoided unless you're REALLY into salad. Don't get me wrong, it's quite tasty. But unless you have someone who'd like to share it with you, it's just too big and there are many other things I'd rather have on the menu. It's perfectly fine but in all the times I've gone it's the only dish I've really regretted.   The falafel wrap on the other hand is every bit as good as the non-raw, non-vegan counterparts I've tasted and pizza on sprouted buckwheat and sunflower seed flax crust was much better than I could have imagined. I only had a bite but I might have to order it next time. The pasta dishes range from the outstanding (Sweet and Sour Noodles) to the very good (Pasta Bolognese) to the okay (Pad Thai). But this is probably just based on my personal preference. All made with zucchini noodles, all look gorgeous and all are really quite impressive considering that they're using fake noodles! The deserts are also fine, but I'm not a sweets person and besides, I usually don't have room left by that time. But I do pick up a bag of their homemade kale chips on the way out...delish.  If you're skeptical, give it a shot. The food is excellent in terms of taste and presentation. If I had one complaint to make, it's the fact that their menu has remained almost completely static from the first time we visited a couple of years ago. They do have specials from time to time and I know that it must be pretty tough to get creative with they're working with (heaven knows I couldn't do it in a million years) but it would be nice to see their menu shaken up a bit. Still, the place is ideal for a (non-vegan) vegetarian with a gluten and lactose-intolerant fiancée...although it still doesn't get me off the hook from having to learn how to cook."}
{"text":"So the menu here is not for those who don't live or follow a vegan/raw diet, if you are vegan or raw or follow a plant based diet, you will likely enjoy it. But let me say... The desserts here are to die for! Hands down some of the best vegan cakes I've ever had! I would go back, solely for the purpose of earring dessert! I had the miso soup with kelp noodles and I enjoyed it, although it's a bit on the pricey side that would be my only criticism, otherwise I really enjoyed it here."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for my birthday and had a fantastic meal! We also bought the kale chips to go!"}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food! I had their taco salad, I came on my birthday (Feb winter) it wasn't busy at all at 4pm the server was very cool. Overall nice experience and you must try this place if you visit port credit i bet it's nicer in the summer when you eat on their patio. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I was craving Falafel today and couldn't find a place in PC... Then I remembered these guys do a great falafel wrap. Mmmm. So good. And I grabbed some sour cream kale chips for a snack later. (The only way I'll eat kale is from Raw Aura)  I'll have to agree with other reviewers... Other times I have visited I have had the same experience with the server... She's not quite rude but definitely not friendly.   Other than that, I love this place and recommend it to everyone, omnivores or otherwise :)"}
{"text":"First time there, not my first time eating at a raw food venue.  Excellent accomodation from our server. I brought with me- my baby, a toddler, and my nut-allergic partner (who suggested the place!), not the prime target population for raw vegan food!  The place is narrow, but my children were fine with the space (no high chair though).  My partner is allergic to nuts, our server was great at pointing out how we could alter the menu to accomodate.  For drinks, im simple, my usual is hot water with lemon, server offered to have ginger in it too- bonus! The perks of being in a venue that values health! I got 3 slices of lemon and 3 slices of ginger in my hot water- perfect.   Server kindly gave me a spoon of the curry sauce to sample to ensure it wasnt too spicy, and suggested nachos instead of the pizza which my daughter was dead-set on getting. Toddler insisted on ordering pizza, but didnt end up liking like the pizza, just as our server anticipated, who then gave us an order of nachos with guacamole without any fuss or surcharge!  We also got dessert, on the house! - coconut-covered chocolate balls, so decadent and smooth!  I was impressed by their food, service, hospitality and flexibility.  My partner was wheezing by the end of the meal probably from nuts in the overall environment, but he was very happy with the taste of all the dishes (although the \"cold\" pasta was an acquired experience for him).   Everything the staff did and served was EXCELLENT considering our unique needs, lol. They made us feel very welcome and I wouldnt hesitate to go again or to recommend the place.   Just careful if theres nut allergies. Also for some people, eating lots of raw veggies may disagree with your tummy (cramps or gas) if your system isnt used to that kind of diet.   It is definitely a niche venue, but im so glad its there, and although I wish the menu had more entree choices, it is tasty, filling, and really supports vegan/gluten-free foodies out there! :)"}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed. Boring menu and kind of bland flavours... The waitress hated her job... We even heard her making comments about it to one of the chefs Unfortunately it does not compare to the other raw and or vegan restaurants ..."}
{"text":"A small place that offers raw vegan menu...the food is tasty but tends to be heavy (lots of nuts and seeds used). It's on the pricey end given the simplicity of the place."}
{"text":"Great find for these out-of-town veggie lovers! Place was busy, which is always a good sign but still had great service! Had two coconut yellow curries which had a very nice flavour and a blueberry and a caramel cheesecake - we really liked the blend of cinnamon with the nut butter. All in all, recommend for vegans, raw or not... non-vegetarian will like the food too!"}
{"text":"Do not let the \"Raw\" put you off. Though the fare is vegan, raw, gluten free and organic, you are not likely to find better food at a \"normal\" 5 star restaurant. Talented chef and wonderful staff. Make sure you order desert. My only complaint is that they need to open another restaurant in Burlington this time. We have been there a number of times and the meat eating hubby loves it. All the items on the menu are pretty unique. My fav...probably the burrito but difficult to choose. Oh and the chocolate banana cake, yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly filling, and absolutely delicious. Located in the heart of Port Credit, my dinner here felt substantial, was wonderfully tasty and creative, and overall, was the recipe for a refreshing, comfortable, relaxing, evening. Definitely recommended if you're looking for a casual dinner spot in the area that's a little \"different\" but with a variety of options on the menu.  First, parking. From Monday to Saturday, It's free in the evenings along Lakeshore Road and the side streets around the restaurant.   Second, the service. Thankfully, we were lucky to have experienced a very friendly server. Food was promptly served, and with a smile.   Third, the ambiance. Rustic, comfortable, bright, and clean. On a warm summer evening, the front windows opened up into the patio, and we were able to sit at the table with window seats at the front. Great, relaxing vibe.  Fourth, the food. We ordered two types of the zucchini pasta: the Pasta Bolognese and the Yellow Coconut Curry Pasta. Portions were pretty generous, and a variety of flavours and textures. The noodles weren't bland at all; there's a generous amount of sauce and toppings. Wonderfully creative recipes that made for a very filling meal, and also doesn't make you feel sluggish or unhealthy afterwards. Granted, these items don't feel like ACTUAL pasta, but it's a great (tasty) raw replica. A great experience, and we'll definitely be back, especially to try out those desserts!  For two people, with tax and tip, we paid around $38.00."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice rustic feel, the staff are super friendly and the food is phenomenal (I got the Falafel Wrap and the Gingery Love juice). It's got so much flavour and just the right proportion. Definitely will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Waitress was rude, place was veryyy tiny, food was good but beware of peanut allergies as every dish had cashew."}
{"text":"I've come to this restaurant for a quick lunch a few times now. Each time the staff has been so friendly and accommodating of a speedy \"in-and'out\". The food is awesome. My favourite items on the menu are the falafel and the maca smoothie (I think it's called the French Toast smoothie on the menu).   It is a bit pricey, but the food is worth it and I don't mind paying a bit more for fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I've really tried to like this place, really. Because I love the idea of having a raw food restaurant with delicious food that is within walking distance to me.   Firstly, the food is just ok. A lot of spices and seasoning is used to make the raw food \"tastier\", but for me, it's not doing the trick.  And secondly, the times I have been there the servers we had seemed unhappy and the cook behind the bar looked equally as unhappy. There's something about seeing a cook make my food unhappily, that makes me enjoy it less.  The two stars are for the decor, their falafal wrap (which is decent), and their drinks."}
{"text":"~4/5 on the food ~2/5 for service  My two friends and I all ordered noodle dishes (coconut curry noodles, pad thai, bolognese) and all three were soooo fantastic and a serene eye opening experience to the delicious world of raw vegan foods. We chowed down on our entrees like we haven't eaten in days, but when we got to the dessert it was o-kay...The blueberry cheesecake (made from ground almond or cashew?) was extremely bland and kind of just fell apart, and the apple crumble tasted like VERY old browning apples (I guess this is something that should be baked). Aside from the dessert, the entrees are the bee's knees even for a staunch meatlover like myself.   The prices are not that bad, considering most restaurants (Jack Astors, Milestones, etc.) all range from $12 - $20 per entree.   The awful part was the service...this was the first time my friends and I went there and didn't really know what to expect. When we went in, we stood by the doorway kind of confused because a waitress didn't come and greet us until a few minutes later and then told us to seat ourselves. After that it was another 5 minute wait for the menu (at this point we started to think we have to order at the counter). When we refused to order a smoothie the waitress rolled her eyes and was very displeased. After that my friend began to ask her questions about the food and recommendations (because we don't know how you can possibly make such intricate dishes out of just veggies), but the waitress took on this attitude that made us felt so little, and told my friend that it's her choice and she can't disclose any ingredients or process used on the food -which I understand the need to keep recipes secret, but her attitude was extremely condescending. Afterwards she didn't give us any recommendations and just rushed us to order our food. After we ate, we went to the counter to pay our bills and my god...the counter was SOOOO sticky even hand sanitizer couldn't get it off (minor issue but still contributed to the negative experience).   TL;DR Amazing food, lousy service."}
{"text":"Lived up to the hype!! Delish! Service was a tad slow, but it was a busy Saturday night, so I completely understood. It's very small, quaint, personal and pretty popular...I felt it was quite charming and will definitely be back.  The food was amazing, and I was so full when I left.  What a great gem!"}
{"text":"Venue - small patio area out front is great; inside is cozy and modern. Love the tables!  Service - not sure what everyone is complaining about but we went on a Friday night and the service was great! So friendly and accommodating! Even though their hours are until 10pm, we were there until about 10:40 and it was still busy and no one was giving us \"the stare\" to leave.  Food - I love raw and vegan so to me the concept wasn't new, but my dining partner (who also is a meat-atarian) expected \"carrots\" and was really amazed at how great the food was!  Nachos - amazing! Loved the chips, cashew cream and walnut \"meat\". They could remove the romaine shreds, it just made it hard to scoop the salsa.  Olive tapenade and Bolognese pastas - both great, I liked the Bolognese a tad more because of the added crunch of the seed sausage and almonds. The tapenade was flavourful and not too salty or oily. Both large portions but surprisingly light!  Almond cup and truffles - both are the size of one/two bites - both great, liked the almond cup slightly more because it didn't just taste like a typical almond butter inside chocolate - it was more flavourful, fresh and had a great crunchy texture!  Will definitely return to try the other menu items"}
{"text":"I! LOVE! RAW! AURA!   Every time I come here, it's always awesome. Consistently great food, great atmosphere and great service. I love coming here for refreshing vegan food and to try something new. I recently took my meat eating partner here for the first time and he LOVED it. I cannot rave enough about the noodle dishes and their smoothies. Oh, and their desserts are to die for. So far I've tried their mint cake, their chocolate cake and their truffle ball things. SO GOOD. I love this place."}
{"text":"was told about this place but hadn't gotten the chance to check it out until this week. it did not disappoint!    a bit small but still a good feel. lovely interior decor of repurposed wood pieces & recycled bottles:-)  we try to be green so were particularly impressed!   we weren't overly hungry but were in the area so decided to pop in. we shared the \"ravioli\"....AMAZING!!!! it was just enough serving & plenty of yum!  the sour cream kale chips were also delish & they offer small bags of them for sale.   we also shared the chocolate avocado cake. my BFF loved it. me - not so much. I found it a bit too rich & didn't like the hints of orange I tasted in it. I did like the crust though (sunflower seeds & dates)  overall, such a delicious & healthy option in a greasy fast food world. will definitely be back! looking fwd to trying their lasagna special & sampling a different dessert (fingers crossed)  :-)   parking here is the usual street hassle but there are a few pay parking spots across the road (down a side street) that become free after 5pm! score! beware the no frills parking lot nearby as I've read warnings from other reviewers about that lot being particularly unfriendly for non-shoppers"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of raw food, so I wouldn't scream \"tasty!\" to any of their menu items. However, if I were to recommend anything at this restaurant - I would definately go for their pizza. Also, you especially cannot leave this restaurant without trying their gluten-free, dairy-free cheesecake. TO DIE FOR. I return to this restaurant specifically for their cheesecake. It's obviously on the pricy side, for the portion that you get, but considering how many almonds go into this delightful tasty thing, it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"I cannot put into words what an absolute pleasure it was to dine here, but I will certainly try!   I fell in love the moment I sat down; the restaurant is open & inviting - which is no surprise, as the staff mirrors those attributes themselves.   Everything about my experience brought a smile to my face - the food was fresh, creative (the staff is constantly collaborating to come up with new ideas), and unbelievably delicious (so much so that I came back the next day to be able to try more while in town). During my first visit I tried the \"Drink Your Greens\" fresh juice, had the Coconut Curry Noodles for my entree & finished up with the Almond Bar. I essentially had the staff order for me - I mean, the owner is hands on in every way, so I figured why not? She led me in the right direction - and I couldn't stop raving about everything to my fiancé. The Coconut Curry was made with zucchini noodles they made to order, and the pineapple cut through the spice perfectly. I was in love with the Almond Bar from first bite; one of the best desserts I've ever had. And, guess what?! I had all this and left FEELING GOOD! Too awesome!  My lunch today somehow topped yesterday. I had the Cinnamon Toast Crunch smoothie and was at a loss for words on how delicious it was. Better than any smoothie I've ever had (honestly, I could have one every day - and the head chef shared with me that he actually does! haha). The Falafel Sandwich was... Well, you're going to think I'm gushing about this place too much, but just trust me... That Falafel Sandwich is unreal. You can tell they use fresh, organic spices (cumin is one of my favorite spices and this completely blew my mind with how good this cumin was). I spent time talking to the friendly team (did I mention how great these people are?) and found out they grow their chickpeas in house! Yeah, each Falafel Sandwich takes three days to make! Talk about a labor of love!   I could (and will) talk about my time here for a long, long time. It isn't just a \"hidden gem\" in terms of restaurants are concerned - the food didn't just taste good; I didn't just admire the dedication they have; the service wasn't just prompt, friendly and considerate; this place was more than \"just\" a great restaurant... It was an experience that I am genuinely thankful for."}
{"text":"We loved everything we tried today, it was totally worth the 1 hour drive to get there!  We had the taco salad, yellow curry zucchini noodles, carrot cake and a creamsicle smoothie. The taco salad was flavorful, and the creamsicle very fragrant and refreshing. I was particularly impressed with the curry noodles. My husband thought it came with too much sauce but I loved it.  The zucchini was freshly spiraled so it was firm enough and did not get soggy. The sauce was creamy, mildly spicy and had a very distinctive flavor. The raw carrot cake (which tasted more like a raw vegan cheesecake) was also very unique, it contains ginger which gave for cake a very unique taste.  We were also happy with the service.  Our server was knowledgeable and patient, she came by half a dozen times to refill our water; our glasses were always full. It was an overall lovely meal, I cant wait to vsit again to sample other items on their menu."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with four of my friends for dinner and we all loved it. I do recommend that you get a reservation because it does fill up quickly. The place is pretty inside with an open kitchen. The service was great and our waitress was really friendly. I ordered the big salad and it was delicious! My friends ordered the pasta bolognese, yellow coconut curry, ravioli, and Oliva tapenade and they all really enjoyed them as well. One of my friends was never a huge fan of vegan foods, but really enjoyed her dish. I also ordered the eat your greens smoothie which was also tasty. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Best Vegan food ever! I'm not Vegan by any means, I've dabbled in vegetarianism & never thought I'd go as far as eating an all vegan meal.  We had their Pasta Bolognese & the Nachos & the Chocolate Banana cake. A-MA-ZING! I went vegan for a month after that lol. But honestly, hands down I enjoyed every bite. It's just so refreshing to see a restaurant take ingredients and make them fresher than they actually are. Every bite has flavour.  Have to mention the staff - very warm & friendly people.  Can't wait to come here again!"}
{"text":"I really liked the location and cleanliness of the restaurant. There is a beautiful patio there I can't wait to try in the summer. The selection of the menu was great there was a lot of variety! It was a bit pricey for the portion of the food and also I wasn't too impressed with the staff they weren't smiley or friendly enough in my opinion. I will definitely be going there again I hope next time the staff are more hospitable."}
{"text":"I'm nowhere near Vegan, I love my meat...but this is literally one of the most delicious, full of flavor lunches I've ever eaten. The Avocado Tartare, the sweet and sour noodles, and the Burrito were fantastic. The pizza was very good as well but not for everyone. I left here feeling healthy, and refreshed. I'm definitely coming back to this place more often."}
{"text":"In all honesty I was presently surprised by this spot. By no mean do I consider myself as a person who's into super hipster vegan food, but man, this spot is the truth.  Its my second visit here and both times where awesome.  Ordered the Avo tartare appetizer, taco salad, and burstin burrito.  All the food was off the chain and super filling, like to the point where after I polished off my burrito and half the app I couldn't move super filling!  The avo tartare was super fresh and had a great light aromatic spring to it, it came with two weird bread sticks sort of like crackers. Dope AF. My burrito, man what can I say, this thing is the real deal.  If you are a 99.9% meat loving animal such as myself and are worried that this joint wont be good, trust me homie u gotta hit this place up because its honestly really good and you'll walk out most likely going to visit a second time around like myself. Big ups to all the friendly peeps up here too, seen."}
{"text":"Tip:  Reservations are a MUST if you're planning to dine on Friday + weekend.  There are only a few tables inside, so it tends to fill up!    Changing my review as waitress has changed her attitude...for the better!  :)    Freshly squeezed juices are great!  Yes, they are $7-8 for a tall glass, but I've enjoyed every one that I've ordered.  They are decent value especially if you compare them to those tiny bottles that you'd buy at Whole Foods.  When deciding what to order, I usually look at the specials first on the blackboard to see if I feel like anything there.  If not, I then refer to the menu.    I decided on the \"Bacon & Cheese\" burger ($17) - but keep in mind this is a raw, vegan joint so it's made out of veg to taste like those elements that carnivores are used to.  Burger was yummy!  Portion looks on the small side, but it really fills you up!  Burstin' Burrito ($15) was good too, especially with that yummy \"sour cream\" sauce.  I think it's made out of some kinda nut cream.  Desserts are another MUST order!  I ordered the Carrot Cake and although the slice looks on the smaller side, it is dense and totally shareable between 2 people.  Small, but great place that feels more downtown than suburbs.  One of the few non-hyped place in Port Credit!"}
{"text":"The food was alright. Went back a second time but only for the banana chocolate cake (might be cheesecake). The service first time was great, second time not so much. I found myself being more friendly to the waitress than the waitress was to customers. Either way, glad to have a juice bar in the area although I would not eat a meal there again."}
{"text":"Very interesting cafe! I came in for a togo order and I noticed that this place was packed. Although the size of the cafe is quite small, it had a cozy feel to it. The lady who helped me was very friendly and let me taste the curry to make sure it wasn't too spicy. Overall, I would love to return to try more of their dishes. I ordered the yellow curry zucchini noodles, which was delicious. Just a fair warning: this place is a bit on the pricier side, so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"This restaurant is unreal. Gorgeous space and by far the best vegan restaurant in Toronto and the GTA. The customer service is phenomenal. The staff is extremely friendly, accommodating and wonderful at creating a welcoming atmosphere for their clientele. I have tried almost everything on the menu and I have always been floored by the intricacies and flavor pairings thoughtfully incorporated into each meal. I can honestly say I'm impressed every time I visit (which is often). Thank you and keep up the great work, guys! You're killin' it!"}
{"text":"after trying out a few vegan places in Oakville that were just not that greatit has just solidified the greatness of this place. big portions, not a bad price."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Went with my husband and both got the bolognese. Everything about it was perfect..the zucchini pasta was amazing..sauce on point with nice seasonings and the sunflower seed \"sausage\" was the cherry on top! We also had the caramel cheesecake. We felt it was a bit too sweet but we shared it so it was perfevt to end the meal off with..texture is vreamy, smooth and the crust part made of walnuts (i think?) Was the best part for me!! amazing place and I'll never back to try the coconut curry next!"}
{"text":"I heard so much about Raw Aura from friends that I finally had to go check it out myself. The restaurant is pretty small and the options on their menu is pretty limited. However the food was very scrumptious. The food was very flavourful. I loved my cashew and beet ravioli. I would have it again. My only complaint was that it was on the pricey side and I was still hungry after my meal. The portions weren't terribly small but not very filling. Which I kind of expected. Overall, my experience was good and customer service was great. I would come again and perhaps try some of their desserts."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for a while but I don't have too many friends in the raw/vegan scene so haven't heard much about it. I finally decided to end my curiosity and came here for dinner on new year's.  As we pulled up to the restaurant my boyfriend asked \"where are we?,\" I replied \"Raw aura! A vegan and wheat, dairy and meat free restaurant,\" excitedly. Trying to hold back a frown he pleaded \"Britany, I'm really hungry!\" I couldn't help but laugh- but he was a good sport and entertained my request to try something new.   For starters we ordered the nachos, Caesar salad and Thank you Berry Much smoothie. The Caesar tasted like a traditional Caesar salad even though it was vegan. The Berry smoothie was impressive! All smoothies are made with hemp milk and sweetened with dates. They are thick, sweet and delicious! Definitely dropping by on those hot summer days for one of these bad boys. The nachos are honestly what blew me away. Described on the menu as: Crispy corn chips served with guacamole, cashew sour cream, fresh tomato salsa and walnut taco meat. I could not believe they could bang out so much flavor from fruits, veggies and nuts. These were so delicious I would choose them over regular beef nachos any day. The only this is the crispy corn chips really get stuck in your teeth, it's a texture if never had before but good nonetheless.   For our main entrée I ordered the sweet and sour noodles and my boyfriend ordered the pasta Bolognese. I did not like the sweet and sour noodles. The flavor combination just wasn't for me. It wasn't disgusting or anything like that. Just very  bland and not memorable. I kept eating off my boyfriend's plate  and I could tell he was getting annoyed because he really enjoyed the pasta Bolognese so I decided to order another one and pack up the sweet and sour noodles to go. The pasta Bolognese is described on the menu as : Zucchini noodles tossed in a rich house made tomato red pepper basil marinara sauce, sunflower seed and sun dried tomato sausage, topped with almond parmesan. I loved tasting the layers of different flavours and the different textures. Keep in mind everything is served at room temperature because it is RAW hence the name raw aura.   Overall I was just so impressed that I couldn't leave without ordering dessert even though I had nowhere to put it. If you are a chocolate lover I would recommend trying one of their chocolate desserts because they looked so rich and creamy. I don't like chocolate so I went for the berry cheesecake. I don't want to use the word amazing but it was AMAZING. Being lactose intolerant it felt like Christmas devouring this cake know that there will be no repercussions at the end of the night.  I will definitely be coming to raw aura in the near future!"}
{"text":"Bad service. Server is not welcoming at all- she's the one there all the time. The lady took 15 min to tell us they were booked for the night- even after she told us they were good at 8pm when I called in. Have eaten here 2-3 times in the past, and food quality has gone down. Good to try, but won't keep you going back. Would recommend the beet ravioli, and juices are ok.  At the end of the day poor service ruins the food experience for me, so won't be spending my money here.   Recommend trying Planta in Yorkville, Solasta in Oakville."}
{"text":"Best raw vegan food I've had so far!  My previous experience with raw food was not so good, so I was a bit skeptical trying this place.  But the food was some of the best I've ever had.    Pasta Bolognese:  very good!  It was flavorful, had a good mix of textures.  The only thing that gave away the fact that the dish was raw was the crunchiness of the zuccini noodles.    Big salad:  the sesame citrus dressing was wonderful and went well with the hummus and the rest of the salad.  I was looking for something light and colorful, and it was perfect.    Chocolate banana cake:  very rich and heavenly!  Not nearly as good as the dessert at Fressen, though."}
{"text":"Really excellent vegan pizza, I absolutely adore the fare here, very attentive service. Their raw chocolate balls are divine also."}
{"text":"Tried this place out based on reviews, however was not a huge fan of the cold dishes. I ordered the yellow curry noodles - was not expecting a cold dish."}
{"text":"A raw vegan menu doesn't necessarily scream \"Tasty!\", but I like a bit of adventure with my food.  Especially if there's a \"good for me\" factor and it fits in the Elimination Diet.   So, I opened my arms (and mouth) in an effort to embrace this healthy lifestyle and their food.    It all began when my girlfriend and I planned to meet for dinner.  With her in Burlington and myself in Toronto, we picked a central meeting point - good ol' Port Credit.  After hours of restaurant research, the plan was to stop by Raw Aura for an appetizer, then escape for Mexican.  Before we knew it, we had devoured 2 apps, 2 entrees, dessert plus a few glasses of wine (at least they've got wine!).  We never made it for Mexican.  I've been planning to head back since, and being on this gluten/dairy-free thing gave me an excuse.     THE MENU:  I was pleasantly surprised by the range of menu options.  There are approx 12 apps and 12 entrees to choose from and prices range from $8 to $12.  EVERYTHING on the menu is uncooked, gluten-free, dairy-free, meat-free and an added bonus, ORGANIC!  They also haven't forgotten about our friends with common allergies. MANY items are soy and nut-free.   Our Order:  When you first glance at the items below you're probably thinking \"Holy cow, that's a lot of food for two people\".  I actually went to Raw Aura again with Keith (since it's Elimination Diet friendly),  so I'm merging the two meals in this review to give you the bigger picture.        The Appetizers:         Orchard Salad ($12) - Kale, slivered apples and sun-dried tomatoes were the key ingredients.  I'd never thought of having kale raw (one of the healthiest veggies by the way) but that's what gives this dish its cleansing quality.  I swear I heard my body thanking me while eating this. The texture is odd at first but you get used to it, and the flavor makes up for it.   This gets a 7/10.      Nori Roll Platter ($12) - Overall an 8/10.  I love avocado (and you know how I feel about sushi) so no surprise this was a winner.  The dipping sauce remains a mystery, but a nice complement.  I learned afterwards that the \"sushi rice\" was actually sunflower seeds & almond ginger. Could have fooled me!  It comes with 8 pieces but we were left with 2 when I remembered to take the photo to the left.  THAT'S how good it was.      The Mains:    Pizza ($9) - This was #1 in our books (excluding dessert).   An 8.5/10.  Remember, this place is gluten-free.  Crust included.  The 2 slices were topped with sun-dried tomatoes, peppers, cashew and tomato sauce.  As you can see, the crust is grainier than your usual Gino's pizza because it is made with sprouted buckwheat.  The thought of grainy pizza might not sound appealing, but trust me, it's good.  Heck, trust Keith!   He is very particular about his pizza and he picked this as his fave.         Buckwheat - Don't let its name fool you.  Buckwheat belongs to the rhubarb family and contains NO wheat whatsoever.  Rice is typically the go-to when it comes to avoiding gluten, but little did we know that the alternative kicks its butt. Buckwheat has more than 3x the iron, calcium, fiber, and potassium.  Buckwheat is also just shy of being a complete protein (containing 8 out of 9 essential amino acids), making it a protein powerhouse in comparison to wheat and rice.  Buckwheat pancakes are calling my name!      \"Lasagna\" ($12) - I gave it a 6/10.  Interesting, but didn't excite me like the others.  Unlike the pizza and ravioli, not sure this deserves \"quotes\".  Hardly looks or tastes like \"lasagna\", so it may have been better off named \"the veggie stack\" or something.  Strips of zucchini replaced the standard noodle in this dish, which is smothered with the same cashew and tomato sauces used in the aforementioned.  Keith and I agree that we would have ranked this higher had we known it was served cold.  Not room temperature, but cold-ish.  We warned the table next to us and that made the difference - they really liked it.  Now you have the heads-up, so go ahead and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for quite some time,  and by no means do I follow a raw vegan diet. The food here is just THAT good. I highly recommend the beet ravioli, I have it as my appetizer for every visit. My other favorite is the curry \"noodles\" which are just as delicious if you have some as leftover the next day. Make sure you save room for the chocolate banana cake. Definitely a place worth checking out if you frequent Port Credit."}
{"text":"Get me back to Mississauga as soon as possible for more of this mind-blowing raw vegan food, please! I cannot get it outta my mind.  Walking into a restaurant 15 minutes before closing is something I typically avoid (as does anyone who has worked years in the service industry). Doing so in a restaurant where food prep is evermore labor-intensive had me expecting some reluctance on the staff's part. Thankfully, it wasn't so and the food angels at Raw Aura kindly seated us and patiently answered questions and took our (enormous... we were hungry) order.  I'm going to tell you from the get-go that this is one of the top 5 raw vegan meals I have ever had. And to make things even sweeter? Prices are reasonable. Know that raw vegan food that's barely mediocre will always be expensive because of the nature of ingredients used (top notch, nutrient-rich). When you're used to eating at such places in New York (think: Pure Food & Wine), you know and accept you're going to walk out healthier, glowing... yet at least $100 dollars poorer (but hey, that glow!) I didn't believe the 2 $ signs Yelp promised, but was so happy I was wrong.   The food is heavenly. We started with kale chips (they have flavors of the day and on this day it was sour cream & onion) and if you've had the super market variety, get ready for those pricey things to be but a distant memory (sorry, Brad's, you're too crumbly and overdone with red pepper flavoring for me to spend 7 bucks on you).   And if those were superb, I'm not sure there's a superlative for what came next: nachos. I'll put it to you this way, though, one of my dining companions swore she was a meat & potatoes girl (who had only just tried watermelon recently) and she absolutely adored 'em. My love for these delights might not be adequately contained here. A giant tome might not even be able to contain all the accolades. Chewy, flavorful, abundant and so so good for you. All these things. Ditto the pizza I ordered for my main course (and could barely finish half).   It's really incredible to think about the fact that all of this delicious food isn't sinful, but incredibly good for you. As my friend noted, \"you feel satisfied, but not weighed down.\" It's the best that food can be.   If only I had room for dessert."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Everything is fresh and the food comes out fairly quickly, even when it's busy. Great service. Great selection on their menu. As a pasta lover I had high expectations, but their Lemon pepper Alfredo delivered. Their almond parmesan is on point t. Seating is a bit limited so if you're a group, I would call in advance"}
{"text":"Been meaning to check out this place for a while and I'm happy I got to do this today. The food was tasty, the smoothies were delicious and where creatively crafted (although I wish they had some type of caffeinated beverage to go with my dessert), and the service was friendly.  Also, this place is pretty accessible for people who have physical disabilities like myself. Just perhaps the locks in the washrooms need to be reconsidered. But that's it.  Other than that, I think it's pretty cool that this place is giving \"905ers\" another good vegan/vegetarian place to go to. Oh! And the chocolate banana cake was incredible!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times.   First time I tried the curry pasta and the bolognese pasta.  Very good.  However they taste very similar other than the sauce.  The second time I tried the big salad with the sesame lemon dressing.  Amazing! Honestly one of the best salads I've had.  Very filling.  Recommend this highly.    Overall the place was great.  Good vibe and good food."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan, but I loved the food at Raw Aura - fresh, light and full of flavour. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"The taco salad and zucchini pasta was amazing! The amount was perfect for sharing with 2 people. The grapefruite and pear juice (pink lady) was very refreshing and my stomach was happy after :)"}
{"text":"We came here for dessert after having dinner across the street.   My friend is gluten and dairy intolerant so when I found this place in google we figured we would give it a shot  The restaurant has a nice decor with brick showing and the table tops are sections of a tree trunk.  There is a chalk menu listing the desserts.  I got some almond butter tarts which where okay, although the chocolate was so rich that was all you could taste.  My friend had the mint ganache. The top chocolate was dominated by a fresh mint flavour, and the bottom was a walnut and fig blend I found to be very bland at first, but the more I had, the more I was able to taste.   I usually don't eat this type of food, but I would go back and try their main dishes.  The gluten free ravioli sounds intriguing"}
{"text":"When I hear raw foods, I think ice cream or a smoothie. I'm more a junk food vegan and avoid the whole raw food movement. I know raw is the way to go for our health and such, but I've had bad experiences with it.   While searching \"vegan\" around the GTA, Raw Aura came up and unfortunately ignored it. Damn, I admit it, I'm so stupid for not trying this place sooner. I read stellar reviews from carnivores, if carnivores are giving this place 5 stars, I have no excuse but to give them a try.   MIND BLOWN! Many suggested the pasta bolongnese and the Cinnamon Toast Crunch and they were not lying. I couldn't believe what I was eating. This has to be the best pasta I've had. I know that's a serious statement but you cannot go wrong with a sustainable, cruelty free, quality meal.   I'll definitely be back to try more.   Go green!"}
{"text":"Waitress was kinda weird, was talking the whole time we were there to her coworkers and wouldn't shut up. Even when we walked in, it took us a bit to get her to acknowledge us and pause her conversation.   Food was actually surprisingly good. Portions are huge, get's REALLY sickening after like 5 bites. So yeah for a \"white\" place, I'd say there was great flavour and seasoning to the food too. Prices were good, pretty much expected to be those medium-higher prices since it is somewhere vegan and organic.   The waitress was the only annoying part to our entire experience. She also interrupted my friend and I to have a 10 min conversation with me about veganism, I was barely responding back. I think she was really bored honestly she kept trying to talk to everyone. Hella weird. Anyways, I MIGHT come back, most likely not. So yeah. The place was kinda really small, didn't like that. I like that you can see your food get made. It's really GROSS that the chef doesn't use gloves, I almost threw up at that tbh. Good food tho. Would've got a 4 but the waitress was annoying."}
{"text":"Food was good, nice clean place, very calming, server was very nice and so was everyone else working there"}
{"text":"We went back!  It's still as good as ever. The staff were really friendly and suggested the almond butter square for dessert.  It was divine! Melted in your mouth. I enjoyed the burrito and falafel (I couldn't decide which I wanted so they were nice enough to split the dishes in 2 portions to give my husband and I a sample of each). The ingredients are fresh and healthy.  I loved the cashew cheese in the burrito so much so we bought some at a vegetarian bake off a week later. I think I'll go again when it's warmer so we can enjoy the fresh air and a fresh meal at the same time ;)"}
{"text":"The food is great, no complaints there BUT the service is soooooo slow. Go if you have two hours to kill and are okay with your food being ready but it not being brought to your table. I could see the cake, ordered it, but it took almost 20 mins for someone to cut a slice and bring it over. Don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Wow! What an experience.  The food was a work of art. Couldn't imagine such delicious Vegan food. Out of the world.  Amazing service  Great pricing  A nice little place for a date night  One of the best experiences I've had in a long time    You won't regret it. Must go. We loved the curry noodles, the burrito, the tartare and the live bread. Everything was to die for."}
