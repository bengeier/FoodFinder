{"text":"Travel all over North America.  Joined Yelp to comment on what a wonderful experience I had here."}
{"text":"Spectacular food, definitely a place for special occasions and intimate nights out. Three hours dinner, worth every penny :)))"}
{"text":"As far as Japanese food goes, this restaurant gets it.  They have set courses that are in the $100-150 price range per person so if you are looking for a budget dinner run!

What you get for these prices are excellently presented foods using a variety of 'prop's to add to the aesthetics.  What I find ironic is that the food looks amazing yet the restaurant itself looks, well, ghetto.  If you've seen the restaurant from the outside the inside is what you'd expect.  

The food is extremely fresh.  There is nothing 'generic' about the taste as you can tell that the food is served and put together with a full palate in mind.  Given the size of the portions I was skeptical about being full but I can tell you that I was stuffed at the end of the meal.  

I say it's worth going if you want to taste 'fresh' seafood and just for the experience.  It's a place that you go for on an occasion."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday...hands down the best sushi I've had in Toronto (also the most expensive)!  They only have Omakase (ranging from $80-120pp), but you will be well satiated!  If you come on your own or in a couple, I recommend making a reservation to sit at the bar...so you can see the \"master\" at work. The tables are better for a more intimate experience.  Ambiance is very simple, but the service was very attentive.

The fish is flown in fresh from Japan in the morning---you can taste the difference! The presentation was gorgeous, with all the cooked dishes, sushi and veggies prepared very delicately.

Best toro, trout and yellowtail I've had!  The marinated sardines was among my favourite cooked dishes.  

If you have a special occasion and want sushi (or you can afford high-end sushi anytime), I highly recommend.  Just allot 1.5-2h for dinner (after all, there are 7-9 courses!)"}
{"text":"This is actually the 2nd time we've hit Kaji (the first was a memorable enough experience to try again :-)
There are 3 levels of menus, basically, small, medium, and large. There is no overlap, so we did one each of the medium and large (no idea how people can not finish the large omakase...it wasn't *that* much food...but enough). The first time we went was during the summer and there was a different variety of fresh ingredients (including live sweet shrimp), so that may have been a big reason we saw almost no duplicates of the menu items.  There were so many great things we tried that I'm just going to cover our highlights :-)
The japanese egg custard was amazingly smooth and topped w/ fresh uni. There were a lot of japanese herbs in the various dishes that one of the people we went with (he's from japan) explained to us and the herbs added a nice touch to each of the dishes. The yuzu jelly on top of the raw oyster was a great alternative to the typical hot sauce at oyster bars. The toro scraped off the bones was amazing (makes me wish we didn't waste it with the tuna we caught a few years ago)-:
Even the udon noodle soup was refreshingly fresh tasting. The citrus custard w/ fruit dessert was refreshingly light, and the espresso jelly cup satisfied the coffee-holics (this was the only repeat dish we rememberred from last time).
The only negative we had was the tea was typical of sushi restaurants. Our japanese friend had corrupted our taste buds by showing us how green tea is supposed to be prepared (you use a cooling container and a tea soaking container so you don't burn the tea leaves), so it was obvious to us that the tea leaves were burnt or had been sitting too long in hot water :-P

Overall, a great experience again and chow-worthy for an experience with a japanese master chef. Apparently, word is getting around. The previous time we went, half the restaurant was filled with japanese businessmen, but this time, most diners were non-japanese."}
{"text":"Sushi Kaji was my first experience at Omakasi. 

We went for a my sister's birthday so it was a treat. because we knew we were in for a great, but expensive meal. There was only two items to choose from, the small Omakase selection or the larger Omakase (ie. more courses)

We all ordered the larger meal, and we spent well over 2 hours at the restaurant, not eating constantly, but getting our courses at a fairly good pace. By the end we all felt stuffed.

The location is in Etobicoke and its a very small restaurant, probably no more than 8 tables, if that. Our waiter was Japanese and only spoke some English. We found out that the fish is delivered from all over the world amongst other neat facts about our meal."}
{"text":"My friends and I have a yearly ritual to explore restaurants around the Toronto region and this year Kaji was the one. 

Throughout the $120 meal, we thought it was just simple food that didn't really stand out or surprise us at all. That is exactly what they are selling! Try eating sushi anywhere else after a couple days, images of kaji sashimi and sushi will just pop in your mind telling you that it just isn't the same. 

Kaji was definitely an awesome experience. I'll let the pictures do the talking"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! Expensive, but worth it! Ii thought I'd be hungry after having the omakase due to the smaller portions, but I was stuffed.

The restaurant isn't in a chic neighbourhood, but they deliver such amazing dishes.

You need to go. Now."}
{"text":"Wanted to try Kaji for many years now (tried to reserve a couple of years ago but was unsuccessful on a few attempts), finally got a chance to try on my visit back to Toronto. Surprised that reservations is relatively plentiful right now. Not a big fan of splurging on wagyu sukiyaki so decided to go for the second set menu. 

First the highlights - The sashimi was superb, especially the exceptional Spanish mackerel. The sushi was excellent, the fish and rice were served at good temperature. If i had to be super picky maybe the rice could've been pressed a tiny bit less for those who prefer to use hands. I also saw the chef making a flower out of veggies, amazing knife skills, did not get to see the finished product though, not sure what/for whom it was for.

Several things could be improved - the mini sushis (not sure if that's the proper way to call them) not made by Kaji himself had some problems. The temperature on a diced chutoro mini sushi was way too cold, which was unfortunate. The rice also tend to have structural integrity issues. On the cooked dishes, lily bulb cake overpowered the uni I feel, probably better to have the uni raw on top of the cake instead of cooking it and stuffing it in the cake.

Overall very solid food. Although I mentioned many small flaws but I thought it was still many steps better than most other Japanese establishments in Ontario."}
{"text":"Review of Sushi Kaji 

1)Lobster salad accompanied by deep-fried shrimp heads. In the salad there was lobster (of course), mushrooms, carrots and a citrus-like sauce. Both the shrimp heads and salad were nothing special.

2)Chilled braised eggplant. This was surprisingly good considering that I would not find anything spectacular about a piece of eggplant. The sweet sauce and crunchy onions matched well with the soft and chilled eggplant. 

3)Sashimi platter and tuna tartare. The lobster, sea bream, trout, octopus and tuna were impeccably fresh, the freshest sashimi I've had in Toronto. Freshly grated wasabi adds a mild bite. The tuna tartare was outstanding. The textures were balanced perfectly: the softness of the tuna, slight liquid from the raw quail's egg and the somewhat crunchy daikon radish.

4)Steamed fish and sticky rice in broth. This dish was something I've never had before and I enjoyed it. The sweet broth blended nicely with the warm sticky rice and steamed fish.

5)Tempura platter including asparagus, shrimp, pumpkin and onion. The batter for the tempura was outstanding and I enjoyed the salt and pepper seasoning they used, which was comparable to the Cantonese-style one.

6) Braised black cod and shrimp croquette. The black cod was absolutely delicious, unbelievably fresh and accented slightly some sweet flavors. The croquette was nothing special, I wish the sweet potato in the center and croquette itself was warmer. The garnishes (shrimp paste stuffed pepper and gonzo beans) were average.

7)Sushi course with lobster miso soup. The lobster miso soup was pretty good but not outstanding. It basically was a miso soup with a bit more sweetness and flavor due to the addition of lobster. The nigiri course which consisted of Toro, Trout, Charbroiled tuna with ginger sauce, BBQ eel nigiri, Uni & salmon roe gunkan maki, squid nigiri, BBQ eel, tuna tartare and uni on top of rice and sweet shrimp sashimi with salmon roe eggs were easily the freshest fish I've had in Toronto.

8)Fruit salad and strawberry mochi. Nothing outstanding here, the fruit salad was basically fruit in a sugary syrup and the mochi was decent, didn't seem store-bought.

The service at Sushi Kaji was second to none. The staff were very polite and friendly. You could tell as soon as you entered the restaurant, the waiters would take your jackets and present you the menu. Throughout the courses, the waiters would always present you the food with a smile and describe what it was and how to eat it. Another important detail was that they always knew when to refill your green tea, which was very good by the way. The chefs at Sushi Kaji are hilarious. Mitsuhiro Kaji is practically a stand-up comedian with his funny gestures, which included the comedic slapping of an apprentice when the apprentice dropped the plates loudly on the counter, and playful teasing of customers, especially when he personally presents you his hand rolls. His apprentices were funny as well and very informative, answering any questions we had about the food and even going as far to show us how real wasabi was made when my friends and I were discussing it. The staff as a whole always asked how everything was and Kaji himself was kind  enough to ask us if we were full or not and offering extra sushi at no additional cost.

As a whole, Sushi Kaji is home to a heart-warming staff and the best Japanese food in Toronto. The price I paid at the end of the meal was reasonable because of the great experience and atmosphere of the restaurant, and the very authentic and delicious Japanese food."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice for our anniversary and we have always enjoyed the their service and quality of the food and the presentation. They are very high priced but worth every penny they catered to my wife's allergy issue (when making reservation let them know ahead of time what you are allergic too) especially since they have only 3 dinner courses on the menu. They renovated the place recently and it looks awesome."}
{"text":"There was no 'wow' during the entire dinner.  We ordered all 3 omikase dinner - $80,100 & 120 among 3 of us. Almost feel like the entire evening I was eating food from an assembly line. Perhaps we have been spoilt by Chefs Morimoto and Tojo because their dishes and creation had the 'wow' and at Kaji 
the simplicity of the dishes were not very sophiscated - taste in general
 were okay but not memorable
The sushi course of fish selection is of good grade but the sashimi course was a little dissappointing. The kitchen dishes were a bit peasant like....come on shrimp paste cake n tofu? The sea bream collar and head dish was slightly overcooked as this is supposed to be the best part of a fish n when cooked right the collar meat is tender n smooth. We all find the sauce in most of the kitchen dishes are rather sweet. Maybe there are more white patrons as they like things sweet. I would still recommend people to go try as the bite size presentation is cute n chef Kaji is funny n entertaining. We got extra macaroons n roasted rice tea to end out meal."}
{"text":"Awful! I'm not sure where all of these reviews are coming from. The sashimi is really thin and not fresh at all!!! My date had his sushi and gagged. I would not recommend this restaurant on my worst enemy. Stay away!"}
{"text":"After hearing such amazing reviews online and from a few friends, my foodie friends and I finally decided to check this place out. There were 4 of us, so we decided to order two sets each of the Takumi ($120) and Waza ($100).  We enjoyed the decor of the place, the service was not amazing but not bad either,  and all their dishes were beautifully presented.  Their soy sauce was simply divine, and a few of the dishes were quite delicious.  However, that was about all that we found to be positive about our experience.  
  Since we sampled both the Takumi and Waza, we tried quite a few of their dishes. Most were underwhelming, looking much better than they tasted, and we were disappointed by the choice of dishes they served, as most of them were similar to Chinese dishes you can find at a dim sum restaurant, but not as well executed.  The sushi and sashimi were the most disappointing. Our sushi chef made our sushi like he was making snowballs, so our sushi rice were all too densely packed, and did tasted worse than sushi rice at AYCE places.  The sashimi were fresh, but since we have been spoiled by our usual sushi place's omakaze ($50 omakaze for assortment of less common fishes like different ajis, anago, uni and such) we found salmon and white tuna being served for our $120/$100 meals to be outrageous.  
Overall, we all left that night severely disappointed, and simply confused why people would recommend this place. Perhaps it was an off night for them, but we would never return."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of sushi and this my friends is the best I've had on this continent.  I had the full $120 course and am still in awe of the quality and flavor of all of his dishes. I was told that all of his fish is flown in bi-weekly. Whatever happens to be in season at the time.

You get approximately 3 or 4 small appetizers followed by a sashimi platter then the sushi plate. Two more \"heartier\" courses then a dessert. Both my date and I had two different desserts, so we got to taste each others.

The restaurant is warmly lit and was a little tricky to find because of its small size but well worth its expensive price. If I ever find myself in Toronto, I'll be sure to stop here again. The only thing I'd change is I'd sit at the bar this time to witness Kaji-san work his magic!"}
{"text":"This was a special experience. Everything was superb, the sushi courses were the best sushi I've ever had. The beef was devine. The service was excellent. I didn't love the desserts but, that's just my personal taste, they were well prepared."}
{"text":"Amazing food, really special flavours. Nice atmosphere and experience. Would love to go back if it wasn't so expensive and far away."}
{"text":"The overall sushi experience in town.
- amazing hot foods
- fresh sashimi with quality 

Price point is high, but the experience is definitely worth every penny. Usually higher end meal means less food, prepare to leave hungry? Not a Kaji! Its very filling, we always have to roll each other out of the restaurant, haha!"}
{"text":"My friends brought me to Sushi Kaji after describing the cuisine as \"gourmet sushi\", which I didn't think was an actual thing until I dined here for the first time. I never ate a Japanese restaurant where the individual bill reached three digits per person, but the high prices definitely reflect the high quality of food and services.

It was a really unique experience sitting at the bar and marvelled at the master who crafted the dishes in front of us. The portions were modestly sized, but still fulfilling all the same. dish that we ordered not only tasted delicious, they were also presented in such an artistic and creative manner too. 

After dining at Sushi Kaji, I think the best word to describe this restaurant is \"authentic\". The food, the service, and the overall atmosphere felt like I was stepping into Japan for the very first time. It was a very pleasant dining experience, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who's a fan of Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"Kaji's Kaiseki or kaiseki ry?ri is a traditional multi-course Japanese dinner. it is a type of art form that balances the taste, texture, appearance, and colors of food. To this end, only fresh seasonal ingredients are used and are prepared in ways that aim to enhance their flavor. Local ingredients are often included as well.[6] Finished dishes are carefully presented on plates that are chosen to enhance both the appearance and the seasonal theme of the meal. Dishes are beautifully arranged and garnished, often with real leaves and flowers, as well as edible garnishes designed to resemble natural plants and animals.

This is not your typical sushi dining experience.  If anything better, you can google Jiro's dreams of sushi on youtube that featuring a 85 years old Sushi Chief - Jiro Ono the only Michelin three-star sushi chef in the world in tokyo."}
{"text":"Again an amazing dinner at Sushi Kaji.  Course after course we were amazed at the sheer beauty of the dishes and the amazing flavours.  The best dishes were the sashimi and sushi.  Fresh fish so creamy and so satisfying and so different than the sushi you get at your regular sushi joint.  

The service is exceptional; again it was my birthday and one of the chefs made me a radish, green onion and carrot flower bouquet (see my photos to be amazed!). The chef took around 20 minutes making it and the care he took making it I thought he was working on tomorrow's mise-en-place!  I wish I had stood up, walked over and given him a hug I was so moved!  But instead, I just sat there gobsmacked and then goofily smiled at him and bowed my head twice in thanks.  So Chef if you're reading this--thank you so very much.

Go and have a religious experience with Japanese cuisine.  It will change the way you think about Japanese food."}
{"text":"For the record, Kaji is an outstanding resto. I have gone three times and happily \"surrendered myself to the chef\", as there is NO MENU. You can pick between two options, one at $80 and the other at $120.  The location and the decor are really poor. My only real complaint is the consistency and cost. The dining room is a shoe box, and I wish i had an interior shot to post here. The wine and drink list are simply inadequate for diners at this pricing point. Lastly, they can be inconsistent and slow.  Try it once definitely."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday night for a birthday celebration. There were 3 options, the Takumi $150, the Waza $120, and the Shun $100. There was also an optional add-on of Wagyu Beef for approx $70. We all ordered the Takumi set and a bottle of unfiltered sake.

So.. wow! I would never think that something with small courses and not very carb heavy could fill me up the way that it did. Every time we thought we had our last serving of sushi, they would bring us some more! I have not been a fan of sashimi in the past but it's probably because I hadn't had good quality. Every thing here was amazing, and I like how they tell you which pieces of sushi/sashimi you don't need to dip in soy sauce. The chef was saying they fly their fish fresh from Japan!

Service was really good - a little bit slow compared to what others on here are saying. They made a really nice bouquet of flowers out of fresh vegetables for the birthday girl which was really cool!

Atmosphere is not fancy, despite the hefty price tag. It's pretty casual and friendly.

My favourites were the: tempura, the tuna and the wasabi macaron. YUM! 

Definitely too expensive to go on a regular basis, but a nice treat. 

Tips: I would suggest keeping the menu so you can keep track of where you are/what you're eating, I couldn't always understand what the server was saying. Also, sitting at the sushi bar is a must to see them prepare everything. Make sure to reserve well in advance!"}
{"text":"Our birthdays were a month apart so we decided to treat ourselves well and try this place. We couldn't get the chef's table but were seated on the side. We didn't mind as we wanted some piece and quiet to catch up. We decided to both try the Takumi ($150) dinner. I can't remember the name of everything I ate (good thing I took pictures) but it was a lot of dishes. I don't know how people have room to order an additional sukiyaki pot.

-simmered daikon radish w/ calamari cake
-abalone risotto & sweet shrimp
-assorted sashimi plate - salmon, tuna, mackerel
-steamed sea bream wrapped in cherry leaf
-deep fried monkfish karage
-soba noddles
-assorted sushi - uni (sea urchin), eel, trout, hamachi (yellow tail), toro, sea bream, octopus

All the dishes were nicely done. The fish was super fresh, it does change the other sashimi I eat at other restaurants now. The presentation of course was nicely laid out on the dish it self. It's like you don't want to touch it and just admire it.

For dessert, there was a variety as well.

-yuzu sorbet with pear compote and green tea macaron
-creme brulee with wasabi macaron

The sorbet was very refreshing, light and paired well with the pear. The green tea macaron made a nice touch. The creme brulee was sweeter compared to the sorbet. When I bite into the macaron, I had no idea what the flavour was, I thought it was vanilla or something but then it started to taste like wasabi. I thought it was just the green sprinkles that were wasabi but it turns out, it was the filling. And my friend who doesn't like wasabi, told her to try a small bite and she immediately spit it out. Haha, I had the rest of it. Also had some dessert tea to clear our palettes."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times  - twice we sat at the sushi bar and once at a table  - both are great. Sitting a the sushi bar is fun because you get to watch the staff prepare each course with precision. As the servers present each course, they describe the ingredients and the best way to enjoy it. They are knowledgable and a perfect balance of being there when needed but not overly intrusive. The Chef is a master and little eccentric, and will randomly disarm you with his playfulness, gestures, and friendly banter. A little pricey (ok, more than a little), but you get an awesome meal, two hours of entertainment and an unforgettable experience."}
{"text":"A tiny place with an unimpressive atmosphere. The servers are nice. Food took forever to come. Food presentation was beautiful. As for taste, it was good. But not $400 good. I've had better at one tenth of the price. Every dish was extremely sweet and loaded with sugar. The dessert tasted like sugar mixed with concrete."}
{"text":"As a native Vancouverite, it shames me to say that I only really got into sushi after moving to Toronto. Sure, I could pack away an assortment of dynamite roll varietals, but I never developed the fervor for experimentation required of a devout sushi-lover. These last few years, however, I've expanded both the quantity and quality of my sushi consumption. More recently, two occurrences sparked a need for truly exquisite sushi: 1) I tried Koiso Sushi Bar in Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, and was blown away (my 5-star experience there is really the only reason Kaji gets a 4); 2) I watched the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi at the TIFF Lightbox (http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiffbelllightbox/2012/3600001654) and was immediately hungrier and more determined to eat the finest fish than ever before (disclaimer: I have no personal or financial interest in TIFF or Jiro - I just thought it was a damn good film). This last point happened to coincide with a friend telling me Kaji is regarded as \"the best sushi in Toronto, if not the Country\". I was sold!

AMBIANCE:

Intimate and personal; we were seated at the bar, which gave us a great view of chef Kaji and his staff at work. The place itself only seats 30, so I recommend getting reservations. Notable particulars include: sous chef routinely handling items barehanded right out of the broiler; said sous chef constructing a bouquet of flowers out of carrot, cucumber and radish for another patron; Latin-based background music (whether this was Cinco de Mayo-related, or just a random oddity, is up for judgement).

DRINK:

Sake! Great selection of cold, warm, and unfiltered ranging from ~ $20-$40. Although I tend to gravitate toward the unfiltered, we had a cold, concentrated bottle (apparently it's routine to dilute with water - not so with this one!), as it was touted as being \"good with sushi or sashimi\" (/it was the most boozy). Standard Sapporo and Asahi available for those desiring a brew.

FOOD:

Only two tasting menus to choose from - the expensive (Takumi, $120) and less-expensive (Waza, $100). Each comes with appetizer, sashimi, main, assorted sushi, soup or noodle, and dessert (although I feel that we got slightly more with the Takumi option). We were advised to get one of each to share between the two of us, and I agree that's probably the best option. This does pose somewhat problematic for sharing, mind you, as some dishes are single morsels and definitely put one's dexterity to the test. From memory, the scallops stood out as being superior, and all the sushi and sashimi were splendid. One course was a bit strange in that it was both advertised and served cooked in cellophane. Being a plastic-phobe when it comes to food prep/storage, I was a little taken aback, but I figured a one-off was permissible (update: Wikipedia has informed me that cellophane is, in fact, made of cellulose. Who knew?!?).

COST:

See above. You're not getting out of here without dropping mid-300s for two (incl. tax and tip).

SERVICE: 

Fantastic; constant refilling of tea, instructions on when and when not to use soy sauce with each dish, and prompt removal of finished plates replaced with the following course. Kaji himself is hilarious, and a complete jokester. 

In the end, an incredible experience that won't disappoint. As mentioned, I only gave a 4 because of a superior sushi experience a few months prior, and because I found the dishes a bit more experimental and complex than I typically care for (I'm a pure-and-simple kinda guy). And it's bloody FAR away (Islington and the Queensway!). Also, I'm a stingy s.o.b. with my stars! Enjoy :)

{"text":"I've been to other popular omakase style around the GTA such as Zen, Yasu and etc. So I have an expectation of what omakase in GTA should deliver by now. We ordered the $130 per person meal with the sashimi and we sat at the bar.

Based on my experience, Kaji is THE WORSE omakase restaurant we've tried.

OKAY FOOD:
-Too many apps: If you are looking for an omakase that focus on sushi. This is not for you. They serve a lot of cooked appetizers. We got scallops, shrimp, salmon as apps and they were okay tasting. I felt like I was in a sushi buffet with all the mediocre apps. 
-Okay sushi selection/taste: We only got a few pieces of sushi and they were the standard fishes (tuna, eel, shrimp, egg, and octopus) I was a bit surprised they served octopus sushi.
-Other omakase restaurants brush an even coat of soy sauce on your sushi so you don't need to do it yourself. Kaji tells you to dip it yourself for some sushi and then others they will do it for you. It's very confusing, why not just pre-brush all the sushi for the customer? 

POOR SERVICE: 
-No personal service: You do NOT get the personal experience as other omakase restaurants. They are understaff so they often rush through making the food. It's almost like a factory in there.
-Long idle time: There is a long idle time between courses cuz they are busy serving other customers. We were there for 3 hours!! I waited 30min from appetizer to the sushi meal. I waited another 30min for PRE-MADE desserts! A lot of sitting around and waiting. 
-They sacrifice your experience for their convenience: The order in which they serve the sushi should be lightest to heaviest flavour. Kaji served eel sushi (the heaviest flavour sushi) in the beginning because they were making eel sushi for other customers and hey why not make a few extra pieces for these customers (us), which is not right!
-No one comes around to refill your tea, you have hunt the waiter/waitress down every time.
-Unlike other omakase where they make sure your sushi plate is clean, Kaji just quickly dumps your sushi on the plate, sometimes the sushi is not even in the centre or straight and the plate is filled with soy sauce drip....

I usually feel very happy after an omakase meal but Kaji was very disappointing for me. We were there on a typical Friday night (not during any special holiday or occasion) so I would assume this is their standard service. 

Overall for $130 per person you are better off going to ZEN or YASU where they charge less and offer much much better food options, food quality and service!"}
{"text":"Every sushi love must come here if you truly appreciate Japanese raw cuisine. It is expensive but worth every dollar. Try requesting for a seat at the bar and watch the chefs do their magic."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Best Japanese restaurant in Toronto. Amazing omakase - delicious fresh food presented very beautifully. We got the $120 option and left in awe and really full. This is a great place to go to for a special occasion. Well worth the splurge.

Service was good and the interior is meh but you come here for the food!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to go when there's something to celebrate. The fish is fresh and the menu is always changing. We love sitting at the sushi bar to watch the chef prepare the sushi. You can really see the artistry. Although the pricing is significantly higher than your regular sushi restaurant, it's definitely worth every penny. Make sure to call ahead to book table as they tend to fill up most weekend.  If you are celebrating a special occasion, make sure to mention it when making your reservation. You might be the lucky recipient of a flower bouquet carved by one of the chefs using various vegetables."}
{"text":"Place to indulge and a definite treat. Great experience. 

Simply amazed at the chef who was continuously skinning a carrot without even looking."}
{"text":"All the 5-star reviews here raised my expectations a little too high. I was not impressed, it was just A-OK. 

It's true that the Toro sashimi is fresh and super fatty, and the octopus sashimi was out of this world, but you get what you pay for. 

In my opinion, there are way too many hot dishes. I had the Takumi $120 dinner, and most of the dishes were hot dishes. There was also a lot of redundancies - two of the dishes were noodle dishes. Honestly, the only thing I enjoyed out of this meal was the sashimi. I wish the sashimi and sushi came first instead of the hot dishes because at the end, I was too full to eat any more and I felt that the taste of the sashimi could have been intensified if it was served before the hot dishes. 

The venue was rather small, so service was pretty good. The waitress was quickly to collect our plates when we were done, and brought out the next dish in only a few minutes. 

The restaurant is located in a pretty shabby area in Etobicoke, and can be hard to find at first since you don't expect to find a restaurant of this class in this neighborhood. Oh well, I don't plan on returning anyways."}
{"text":"We splurged on this restaurant on our first night in Toronto.  The food was good and creative and everyone was friendly.  I'm discovering that I'm not a huge fan of raw fish.  A little bit in a roll, but a big piece in sashami, only in very small amounts."}
{"text":"If you ever enjoyed watching Iron Chef (before it became an Americanized version) and drooled, this is THE place to go.  The menu as described by others as a range of 80-100 is actually more like 80, 100, and 120 which results in 5, 7 and 9 courses respectively.  If you are there for flavors and opt to get the 9 course meal, I do not recommend finishing the all food on your plates despite how amazing they taste and how much willpower it will take you to put the spoon or chopsticks down.  The sashimi and sushi portions are very large.  I believe there were about 8 different fishes for the sashimi and approximately that much for the sushi.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Four stars only because there were a few things I could live without trying.

I went to Sushi Kaji on the premise that it was going to be one of the best sushi spots in North America.  Similar to watching a movie that has been hyped out for weeks, you become anxious that it wouldn't be able to live up to expectations.  

I've never paid over $50 for a meal but if I was going to dish out $120, it's going to be for very good sushi.  It is a weakness that runs in the family.  

Most of the pieces were excellent, perfectly prepared and cooked but there were outstanding pieces that just put you in a dream like bliss. I was perturbed by the amount of conversations going on because it distracted my attention from the symphony of flavour going on in my mouth.  

I don't know how else to describe it in a pg-13 setting but it's kind of like trying to stay quiet during really good sex.  You can't help but let out a good ..mmmmmmmm!!! 

At first glance at the menu, we made plans to pick up beef patties at islington station for dessert because we didn't think it would fill us up. To my surprise, I was uncomfortably stuffed over the course of 3 hours.  For dessert, we had different desserts based on gender.  The side of macaroons were so good! They don't just rival Nadeges Macaroons but kicks it in the butt. The centre was similar to very delicious hardened ice cream with flavours including ginger, yuzu and green tea!  I really think they should sell their macaroons to go! They can make a killing with those alone.  

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend - had to wait for a special occasion since it's so expensive.

Atmosphere - nothing special or exciting. It's quaint.
Service - Excellent. They are extremely friendly and very very attentive (without being pesty).
Food - I thought it was pretty awesome. The food is so unique from any other sushi restaurant I've been to. I wish I had a roll or two in the whole course though. But I did love the food. The fish is amazingly fresh. I loved everything with gelee. Flavours are very delicate and well developed. Beautiful presentation on everything. You can tell the chefs hold a very high standard to their food and everything is meticulously prepared."}
{"text":"At first I was a little intimidated by the prices of this place but was reassured by my friend that it was worth it. Let me say ..they were right. 

I decided to take my Gf here for her birthday and made reservations in advance. 

(Inside Tip) If you tell them ahead of time that your there for a birthday they will make a special gift in front of you made from various vegetables and fruits. (pretty awesome skills!) I know this because the people sitting beside us got it done and I was thinking I should have done that! :( I think you have to show them proof first though..

Anyways the food was presented very well and it was well worth the extra expense for the quality of the dishes.

The head chef is very entertaining to watch and his skill set is top notch. The older guy who carved the \"vegetable flower\" for the couple sitting beside us is a friggin samurai man!

The staff is very friendly and my advice to you would be to reserve by the bar so you can watch whats going on behind there. At first I wanted to sit at the table but after about 10 mins I felt sorry for them because they were missing out on the show!

Great Place and Experience so it receives one of my highest reviews yet!

4.83 out of 5!"}
{"text":"This is a long overdue review. I came here for my birthday (January) because I read so many good reviews and someone even told me that Yasu came from Kaji so I thought to myself, it must also be excellent here.

We each ordered an omakase ($120 and $150) and a bottle of sake. The restaurant looks a little dated (typical look of a Japanese restaurant) and only seats around 20 people. We got the last two seats at the end of the bar facing the sink (water splashing with no fucks given) beside the kitchen (worse seats ever) with servers walking into my chair. We were served a variety of starters/appetizers none of which stuck in my memory because it wasn't anything spectacular. Mainly, traditional Japanese new year dishes and soup. The food arrived in a timely manner where we would finish a dish and the next one would be served within 5 minutes but when we got to the nigiri, we had plates after plates lined up in front of us. It was so overwhelming having 6-8 nigiri lined up that we lost track which one should be eaten before the next. It felt so rushed that we couldn't enjoy each piece. Their nigiri wasn't anything spectacular, if anything too much sauce or wasabi. What really ruined the night was the unagi nigiri I had. It still had bones in them and I tried picking as many out as I can but sure enough, one got lodged in my throat so I tried taking big gulps of tea, swallowing a chunk of rice, coughing it out, picking at my tonsils, nothing helped. I felt so uncomfortable that I even puked trying to get it out. I understand that the bones can be eaten from the unagi but clearly this isn't one of them. Their dessert was gelato with some random pieces of fruit and a soggy macaron. No thoughts or effort involved what so ever.

I didn't give them such a poor rating just because of the bone but because I had such high expectation of this place and thought the quality of every dish served would be decent especially for that price. Spending around $400 (tax and tips included) for dinner with \"meh\" food, leaving thinking to myself, what did I eat? Which piece stood out from the rest? How were they different or better than other places I went to? I honestly couldn't answer any of these questions.

I hate comparing them to other omakase places because I know every chef puts a little spin on the way the execute their dishes but this restaurant had such poor execution, lack of thought and very non-nonchalant attitude on what they were feeding their guests that leaves such a bad taste in a mouth, figuratively and literally.

I would not come back."}
{"text":"My favourite meal of 2016. We loved the food, appreciated all the detailed explanations about what we were eating (which mattered to us since it was omakase) and the lighthearted atmosphere (for some reason I had been expecting something more formal). If you can, get a seat at the bar instead of a table."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Wouldn't rank it up there with some of the joints in Japan or NYC, but for Toronto this is probably as good as it gets.  Portions were a bit insane, and the flavors a bit too western at times, but overall a great experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for our anniversary.  It was a wonderful experience. The food was excellent, beautifully presented and wonderfully prepared. I highly recommend it.

The restaurant is small so you need a reservation, I will call further ahead next time because a 9 pm sitting mean we didn't leave until 11:30.

This is a place to go for the omakaze experience. If you just want a sushi  feed, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Kaji Sushi is one of the premiere sushi establishments in Canada, even though it is located in a unimpressive strip mall on The Queensway.  What makes it so special?  Well Mitsuhiro Kaji does.  He is the chef who owns the restaurant and supports my theory that the majority of sushi lovers in the GTA have never actually tried sushi.

Going there will change your perception of Japanese food, sushi and frankly your palate.  Ask alot of questions and socialize as Mitsuhiro Kaji is fun and enjoys the conversation.

Most of his ingredients are flown from Japan with his fish being received in his restaurant 24 hours from when the fish left the water.  Nothing is kept overnight.  How can he do this?  Well his menu has only 3 options serving an Omakase style dinner or a tasting menu.  You pick the amount of courses you want and you leave it up to the chef to see what you get.  Omakase is the only way to eat really.

House made egg tofu in a bonito broth
Grilled taro potato with 3 sauces.
The sashimi course served with the head of the shrimp still moving.
Everytime this course was brought to the table, ladies would cackle with delight and awe.
Beautiful, sweet translucent Botan shrimp
Fish ball in broth
Glazed Japanese eggplant with dashi sauce.  Tender and sweet.
Suzuki fish and crab grilled in a spring roll paper with ponzu.  Just beautiful.
Sushi courses.  Kaji's rice was sweet, still warm creating a perfect contrast to the cool fish
Noodles in broth

In short, visit Kaji and visit often to have a true Japanese experience."}
{"text":"Amazing how I've never written a review for this place, especially since I've been there several times now.

Bottom line: if you're looking for an amazing omokase experience, and are willing to spend for it, this is the place in Toronto.  My parents have toured Japan's finest places, and consider this an amazing place to dine in.

I'd still go back with the price tags they have.  Sit at the bar if you get a chance.  Better view and entertainment from there."}
{"text":"Yes, it is expensive.
Yes, it's in the middle of nowhere in South Etobicoke.
Yes, every other sushi experience you will have in Toronto will leave you feeling sad that it wasn't as good as Kaji.....but you must go.

At least once.

Make it a special occasion....bday...anniversary something like that.

I went with my best friend for her birthday. I made reservations for a table, not realizing that the sushi bar is the place to be, so make sure you don't make the same mistake. It's a whole other experience watching the chefs work.

We ordered 1 Takumi menu and 1 Wagyu menu and shared.

Wow - the meal was spectacular. 

The presentation of each dish was beautiful. It looked like art and the flavours were incredible.

My only disappointment was the decor. I was surprised to see that it looked like pretty much every other sushi joint I've been to. I was sort of expecting it to be very posh and pretty inside, but it was just average.

Whatever - it was still amazing.
Go...go now actually."}
{"text":"there are more than enough pictures and posts raving about sushi kaji. so i wont add the the already countless reviews... hands down, the omakase is really really good. sitting at the sushi bar is also very enjoyable. being in the thick of the action and having the chance to chat with the sushi chefs is always a great thing.

this place would have gotten 5 stars had it not be for kaji-san himself. 

he was working behind the sushi bar that night, and his loud personality got louder and louder as each table in the place seemingly kept sending him a glass of sake in appreciation. by the end of our meal, i'd say he was in a very happy place. 

however, that's where his behaviour starting changing. kaji-san is a bit of a perv. gomen nasai kaji-san, but you are. your awkward and attempts at comedy as you hugged your female patrons was truly gross. and the worst of it was that you only leered and demonstrated lewd behaviour at the non-asian females. my SO is a beautiful woman, and when you tried to put her coat on for her in that creepy way, i'm glad she stiff-armed you, and asked you politely to hand her the coat. your staff was openly embarassed at your behaviour and was very apologetic. alas, that is the japanese way. hierarchy rules - and you dont call out your boss. 

interestingly enough, when that group of 4 japanese ex-pats came by to thank you, you bowed and showed them the typical respect that you can witness everyday in japan.

i am not trying to burst any bubbles about this place. it's a great restaurant with fantastic food - and would recommend it hands down. i just wanted to put the awareness out there in the yelp world."}
{"text":"Super nice sushi place!!!
really fresh sushi and good customer service.
Thank you so much chef!
I recommend Salmon lover"}
{"text":"i had a meal at Kaji that is definitely in the top 5 of my entire life. it is not often that you can actually taste intelligence in a chef's preparations. you could at Kaji, several dishes were so exquisite in their freshness and complexity that they literally brought tears. It is expensive - Omakase plus wine brought dinner to over $200 *each* for two of us. Since we were celebrating big things, it made all the sense in the world. So if you have the money to spend and the patience to get a reservation, this is a sushi/food experience that is worth every penny."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for a long time and so glad I did. This is officially my favourite sushi restaurant in the city. Given the high price point, it will not be my \"go to\" sushi spot but a nice treat a couple times a year.

Two tasting menus - $150 with Wagyu beef and $120 ex. the beef. No a la carte menu at all. We tried both.

Service is 5-star all the way. They really take the time to explain every dish which is key when your ordering Omakasi. Tea refilled instantly, amazing greeting when you arrive and a cool owner / chef with great personality. 

Great pacing for the Omakasi - didn't wait more than a few minutes between courses. They serve according to each customers eating speed.

I recommend you sit at the bar so you can watch everything being made in front of you. Check out the owner making the sushi, it's almost like a hand dance! There are about 6-7 tables. The restaurant is spotless and clean.

Our menu consisted of the following::

- Appetizers were really creative and unique. The deep fried Japanese eggplant and shrimp cake was delicious. Amazing bamboo shoots with various roe. Duck with Japanese melon combo was my favourite.

- Sashimi was easily the best I had to date. Lot's of unique fish brought in from Japan daily. It's so fresh that it melts in your mouth. I don't liked cooked lobster but the lobster sashimi was perfect.  

- The Wagyu was incredible. So tasty and sweet. It was served with homemade udon in a broth heated at your table. Well worth the extra $30. You get lobster tempura instead if you order the $120 menu.

- Sushi also was spectacular. I loved the abalone sushi. The eel was also unique - very long pieces of eel, you could make three pieces of sushi out of it. Toro was also very good. You get about 5-6 pieces of sushi which changes daily.

- Next up was the cold soba noodles, perfect to cleanse the palate.

- Last dish was various sashimi / egg roe combos and sea urchin. Once again, incredibly creative and delicious.

- Ended the meal with green tea creme brûlée.    

Highly recommended, well worth the $150 / person price tag for a special occasion. Perfect service, amazing food and great atmosphere - the rare trifecta!

{"text":"This is by far my favourite omakasa experience in Toronto. I've read a few reviews making mention of the high price tag so remember that when booking. In my opinion it is 100% worth it. Kaji orders in fresh fish for each meal - this is not something that most of the sushi restaurants offer. In addition the presentation is beautiful. 

I'm also a big fan of the relaxed environment. The focus is on the food and not the decor. Whether you sit at the sushi bar or at a table you receive a similar intimate experience. 

Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"this one is my favourite japanese resto in the city. it's a pricey place to dine at but you do get about 8-10 course meal for aaround 80 to 120 dollars (depending on which set you choose) and probably the best fish and other japanese treats that you wouldn't find anywhere else in Toronto. 
The food is VERY authentic. None of this teriyaki and california roll stuff here. 
The servers are very well versed in japanese food and the daily selection. and the chef has been featured on alot of shows and interviews. 
If you're looking for a different and a none north americanized japanese dining experience, try this place and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is now my new favourite sushi restaurant! I could tell the moment I walked in that this would be a treat for my tastebuds. Tucked on an unassuming small street in the west end of Toronto, Sushi Kaji delivers the utmost spectacular dining experience. The service is friendly, welcoming, and humble; each dish is described so intricately as it is brought out, almost like you are the only customers of the restaurant. All the dishes are simply delightful--small portions help to pace the meal just perfectly, so that at the end you are just stuffed enough to be satisfied as you end with dessert.

Though the set menus are on the pricier side, I'd say the food and fresh ingredients are well worth it. The udon noodles are amazing, and all the sushi/sashimi plates are definitely the best I've had in Toronto. Each piece seems to be crafted so carefully, with the right combination of ingredients that distinguishes it from your typical sushi.

I highly recommend this place to any sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal sushi. Great environment for sushi lovers. You must LOVE sushi to come to this place. Amazing food. My favourite was the sweet eel with some citrus. Amazing blend of cooked and raw foods for an omakase. They also had this corn soup with scallop from Hokkaido Japan that was to die for."}
{"text":"Ahh finally got around to trying this place. I'd like to consider myself as an amateur sushi connoisseur, and considering how famous this place is, I just had to try it. We had a party of 4, and we ordered the Takumi course (130 per person).

Most things were really good, but I think overall was a bit underwhelming. Maybe I had high expectations of this place.

For example, the sashimi plate felt a bit ordinary. It did include 2 pieces of otoro and was excellent (9/10), but the other fishes weren't that special. The noodle was also quite ordinary.

The eel and rice, wrapped in bamboo leaf was unique and had a great taste (8/10). The motoyaki was also unique and was good (7/10).

The torched otoro sushi was excellent (9.5/10). Ikura sushi was very fresh (9/10). The uni sushi was also very fresh (8.5/10) but the portion size was very small.

When dessert came, the four of us received 3 different kinds of dessert. They didn't ask us which one we wanted, and we were just given the dessert. I'm not exactly sure why that was the case. I would make more sense if we all received the same dessert.

Service: Good service. When we arrived, they took care to ask where we parked. I'm assuming many people in the past parked in the wrong places and got tickets. One downside was that it took a bit longer than expected for them to take our order.

Overall, it was a good experience, but I wasn't wowed. It was great to try for the first time for some of the dishes that I've never tried before. However, it's a bit pricey considering certain  food were a bit ordinary. Also considering a restaurant like Yasu is only $80 and my main focus is sushi/sashimi, it feels like Yasu has better value than Kaji (but I do realize Kaji omakase is different). Also I left the restaurant still feeling a bit hungry (also happend the last time at Yasu lol).

Quality: 9/10. Service: 8/10. Value: 7/10. Overall 8.5/10 (Not an average)."}
{"text":"I've heard so many amazing things about this restaurant, but just checked it out last night for the first time. It was even better than I expected! 
The menu is omakase (chef's selection) style, so we ordered the $150 and $120 set and shared. Every single dish that came out to us was on point. The presentation was stylish and most importantly the food was delicious. The portions were small, but there were so many courses that by the end of the meal we were completely stuffed! We had a conversation with an assistant chef after our meal and he told us that the fish they bring in is not only from Japan, but from other places in the world such as Malta and they pay a high price for it. He told us that for some of the fish, such as the Toro, a slice of sashimi can be as high as 4-5 dollars, which means that there is very little profit to be made. Chef Kaji is generous with the amount he gives to the customers because he wants them to have the best experience possible. I really respect that and this type of care for the patrons at his restaurant was evident during our meal because it was easily in my top 3 dining experiences in Toronto! I will be recommending this place to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"food is simple yet amazing, therefore someone who doesnt really like japanese food all that much can truly enjoy it, the service is amazing, master kaji is very friendly and insisted on taking our picture, very humble man too, worth the price you pay, i will definitely go back, filling too and less than 2 hrs meal for omikase"}
{"text":"An amazing and truly authentic Japanese restaurant. How authentic, their website tells you \"We do not serve \"popular Japanese food\" like \"California roll\" and \"Teriyaki\", we will be pleased to introduce you to the real Japanese food culture\". Way to go! 

It serves omakase style, so you pick how much you'd like to eat (3 price levels), and trust Master Kaji to prepare the best food he can based on what ingredients he has. A little suspense and surprise adds to your dining experience, you'd rarely be disappointed with what's put in front of you. 

Always popular with Japanese business travellers, it is now getting a lot of buzz from other corporate card funded diners and locals, I hope it keeps up the quality (unlike the uber popular Tojo in Vancouver, which became the victim of its own popularity and fame)"}
{"text":"Excellent quality - clean flavours that really showcase the freshness of the ingredients. 

The Omakase is definitely worth it - the time and effort the chef puts into each dish is evident from the taste and care with which each dish is served."}
{"text":"Um, yeeeeahhh, about this place.  No way to avoid sounding like a stuck up ass here, but if this is the best meal you've ever had, then enjoy your first trip out of Buffalo!

We did the $150 omakase or whatever the top one was.  Wanted to see their A game.  Very disappointing.  The quality of the sushi serves here was akin to any mid to low level sushi spot in NYC or California.  Think Haru.  Ok. Not great.  We say at the counter for the full experience.  Let me highlight that for you:

1.A really sweet guy who has been working with sushi for 7 months (his last job was at a Mexican chain it came up in conversation) who is trying his best and working his ass off but has zero training.

2. A drunk Japanese chef who I am sure used to be great and could still be so but is more interested in free sake and leering at the women in the restaurant.


All in with drinks and tip was $700.  Would have been better off just eating that.

So sorry Yasuda, I will never cheat on you again!

Ps- would be remiss in omitting that some of the cooked dishes that came out of the kitchen were actually quite good, but we came her for sushi."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Japanese restaurants for the price. Wonderfully tasting  items that are served so very creatively. Just a wonderful experience. Loved it."}
{"text":"Recently I gave my brother my car and I purchased another one.  To thank me he said he had wanted to take my wife and I out for a nice dinner.  It just so happened I came across Sushi Kaji in BlogTO's top 10 splurge sushi places and it was ranked number one!  I had warned my brother that this place isn't cheap and from what I read a lot of their menu is brought here from Japan.  You see, I'm not really used to high end dining at least the kind that would warrant $$$$ by Yelp standards.  We are mostly used to your typical AYCE place.  A la carte for me is a treat.  An Omakase place for me would be a whole different level.  He like myself, was intrigued and seemed interested.  My brother made reservations for opening (6pm) about a week before for a Sunday evening.  This restaurant is only open 6pm-9pm.

This was my first Omakase experience and for those that don't know what that means the menu is \"chef's choice\".  Basically there's no menu really with the exception of 2 prix fixe options that vary slightly.  The two options available on this particular service were \"Takumi\" which featured simmered eggplant stuffed with chicken and grilled yellow tail with daikon radish sauce and the \"Waza\" which instead had sauteed foie gras and daikon radish with chicken miso sauce.  Both options included appetizers, sashimi, sushi, noodles and dessert.  The Takumi was 150 dollars and the Waza was 130 dollars.

We had all decided to go with the Takumi and I had told my brother I'd pay for the drinks.  Green tea was served complimentary and on top of that I had ordered a medium sized cold sake (Okunomatsu Tokubetsu Junmai - yes I had to take a photo to remember), a warm sake (Okunomatsu Kinmon-Gold Crest) and a Sapporo beer.  I sort of have a thing that if I'm getting sake I have to also have a beer as well.  The cold sake was served in a carved bamboo crafted decanter and the cups were also bamboo.  The bamboo decanter was placed in a square wooden \"ice bucket\".  Cool, literally...

Each plate that was brought to us was explained in detail such as ingredients and origin and for the sushi it was told whether soy sauce would be necessary or not.  The presentation and service was very professional and attentive.  With each plate brought I knew that I wouldn't be able to remember what everything was and where everything came from but I took photos just to remember the experience.  

The first plate that was brought to us had 2 items on it.  One was chicken and the other was a croquet in an oyster shell.  This was followed by shrimp, octopus, seaweed salad and then the sashimi.  The sashimi was all from Japan and the wasabi had a ground texture to it.  It wasn't as much of a kick than I'm use to however it was definitely different.  Next came the chicken and eggplant dish.  It was very tender to the point it basically almost fell apart.  The following plate was eel followed by soup and soba noodles.  

After those dishes came the sushi.  All the sushi with the exception of the first dish which was uni (urchin) were served 3 servings to a plate (one for each of us).  As I mentioned the sushi began with uni and I can say that I've not ever had it before.  It was something I always see Anthony Bourdain enjoying on his shows (besides roasted pork) where he was in pure delight.  It was a very different taste than anything I can remember having but very soft on the palate with a unique flavor and texture.  Following the urchin we had 9 more servings of nigiri sushi which included squid, tuna, mackerel, and one last plate of otoro maki two pieces for each of us.  

At this point each of us were pretty full and I have to think that considering the servings are tasting size still it was a lot of food.  The desserts that were brought to us were all different but we all shared them.  One was some sort of lemon cup, ice cream with berries and the third was a creme brulee.  

All in all we had a total of 19 plates served as well as 3 different desserts that we shared.  The timing for each plate basically it was spaced out in such a way that we were able to enjoy each dish before we were brought the next.  The place is quite lively and the service was excellent.  

I suppose what may be a bit unusual is the location of this place.  It's something one may expect to see downtown but regardless of where this place is it doesn't change the fact that it is what it is which is in my opinion a high end restaurant in a place you wouldn't necessarily expect to see one.  

While I may give credit to BlogTO for influencing me to come here and try the place I have to say that while I don't have any previous Omakase experiences to compare it to I don't really need to.  Regardless of the price the food and service here is pretty special as far as my dining experiences go and it will be remembered as such.  I can see Sushi Kaji being a special occasion place for future visits."}
{"text":"Sushi Kaji is a world class restaurant. I have eaten at many Michelin starred Japanese Restaurants (Soto, Sushi of Gari and Brushstroke to name a few). If Michelin stars were given out in Toronto, Sushi Kaji would likely get one.  

Sushi Kaji is not a traditional Japanese restaurant. The omakase (chef tasting menu) is mixed with a fusion flare. Some of the courses were so good that it transcends one's very notion of taste. The omakase was priced at $130 and came with the following courses:

(1) Two appetizers 
(2) Duck and Foie Gras
(3) Lobster Tail and Mushrooms  
(4) Assorted Sashimi
(5) Assorted Sushi 
(6) Dessert

All of the courses were exquisite. However, my favourite courses were the sashimi and sushi. For the sushi course, if you seat at the sushi bar, Chef Kaji would make the sushi in front of you and you would eat each piece one by one as he prepares it fresh. It is like watching a theatrical production - the culinary artistry that goes into the preparation of each piece of sushi.   

Chef Kaji has been compared to Chef Jiro a few times for good reason. His dishes were innovative and creative. The warm appetizers, duck and lobster were very good. 

While Sushi Kaji is located in a strip mall in Etobicoke, the interior is modern. The sushi bar is sleek and clean. The service is not bad, but I did find that my tea and water was not being filled up. I had to ask. For the price I was paying, I should not have to ask. I found that the service could have been slightly more attentive. Overall, I had a great experience at Sushi Kaji. I would highly recommend Sushi Kaji to sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Decor/Service/Food=5/5

Kaji is funny, his staff is wonderful, and food was impeccable! Don't need to say much here other than the fact that this is my favorite place for sushi when I can afford it!

There's the $50 extra for waygwu beef sukiyaki. Was it worth? Surpringsly? Yes! The beef looked like hot pot beef, but melted in my mouth with every bite. 

Only two things were disappointing, the celery curry dish starter, which was really plain and French vanilla dessert. 

Sushi on the other hand blew my mind. Probably one of the best otoro and chopped otoro, and everything in between put a smile on my face. Even my wife said the uni was so unique, she never had uni like that. Make sure to reserve to sit in front of kaji! He will explain everything. Enough words! Pictures do the talking!"}
{"text":"Yes. Just yes. You must come here for an incredible orchestration of sushi and various Japanese dishes. And come hungry... we could not believe how much food came. Dish after dish after dish of incredible food was presented, all of it excellent. 

The quality of the various sushi dishes were all outstanding, and each non-sushi dish was delicious and unique. Too many items to name each individually, but I've attached pictures of them all.

Sushi Kaji absolutely exceeds expectations. You will not be disappointed (or hungry) after a visit here."}
{"text":"If you want an authentic Japanese dining experience, Kaji is worth the drive to Etobicoke.   If you're looking for 20 different kinds of California rolls to dunk in Yoda Mud Bath and stuff your face with, save your money and make your way to the nearest AYCE Chinese McSushi, they're a dime a dozen in the GTA.  But if you want to take it to the next level, experience Japanese food at its authentic best, and quit being a gaijin, this is the place to be.  

You can eat at the bar or at a table, but I feel that to get the full experience, the bar is the clear choice (has 9 seats).  Call a month or two in advance to reserve one of the prime seats, and watch Kaji skillfully slice fish and sous-chef Ian plate a lot of the dishes.   The menus change daily based on the ingredients available, all of which are fresh and shipped in from Japan.  There are only 2 choices, Takumi for $120 or Waza for $100.  (on our menu you could also add wagyu sukiyaki for another $68 which we didn't take).  Green tea is included.  The night I went, the menu consisted of:

Japanese New Year platter (chicken cake, fish cake with shrimp, vinegared radish and carrot in mandarin cup), simmered bamboo shoot, sashimi, lily bulb cake stuffed with sea urchin, assorted tempura, grilled black cod, sushi (served 2 pieces at a time) with noodle soup, and dessert (4 items)

I have never had a meal where every course amazed and each subsequent course topped the last, until I met Kaji.  There seemed to be a natural progression.  Cooked items alternated with raw, heavy flavours alternated with delicate, and so on. Sashimi was served with dark shoyu made in-house, and a peanut sauce meant for dipping the vegetables.  The scallop used for that sushi dish was lightly cooked on top using a propane torch, so there was caramelization and some firmness on the top surface but most of the scallop was still raw.  The sushi trio, which had lobster, uni, and toro, already seasoned with wasabi and shoyu on top of perfectly prepared rice, was the highlight of the \"raw fish\".  One component of the dessert really stood out; this was a pear compote, reminiscent of Royal Riviera, topped with a yuzu sorbet.  The cold temperature and acidity of the sorbet balanced out the sweetness of the pears beautifully.  

Service was over the top.  Servers describe each dish in detail when delivered, and your cup of green tea is refilled promptly when it's less than 1/3 full.  You'll never have to flag them down for a refill.  In addition, for the dessert course the regular tea cups were replaced with larger ones, and these were filled with a darker, stronger tea, which can stand up to the sweetness of the desserts.
  
Don't try to compare the $100-$120 price tag with that Chinese roll garbage.  Think of the $120 as $2000 less than it would cost to fly to Tokyo and stay in a hotel there.  You will NOT regret the money or time (about 3 hours) you'll spend.  Kaji defines excellence in execution in every way - perfection in food quality, presentation, and service.  A rare gem in a Toronto restaurant market full of duds.  One meal at Kaji and you'll never want McSushi again."}
{"text":"My fiancé surprised me with a dinner reservation at Kaji last week. I knew to expect great food but this surpassed my expectations and gave me nostalgic feelings of the time when I was in Japan!

We ordered the Omakase (Takumi $130) which includes Appetizer, Sashimi, Seasonal Dishies, Kaji selection of Sushi, Soup or Noodle, Dessert. 

We were seated immediately at the bar. I would definitely recommend sitting at the bar to see all the food preparation if you're into that. The chefs keep their work station extremely clean at all times which is important to me. We were seated closest to the kitchen, yet you barely ever heard a lot of noise coming from the back. The chef in front of us was skillfully cutting a few floral bouquets out of carrots and daikon and given to me as a gift!

Service was exemplary! Each time our servers placed a dish in front of us, they would describe what it was, where the fish came from, and how to enjoy it. They came to refill my green tea almost every 15 minutes. The timing of the dishes were executed well and gave us enough time to savour each dish.

Items we had were:
-------------------------------------------------------------
Sweet shrimp sashimi
Seaweed salad with sesame dressing
Sashimi (ocean trout, seabream, octopus, amberjack, and mackerel)
Seabream with shimeji mushrooms wrapped in cellophane
Cold thin noodle with bonito broth
Eel wrapped in banana leaf with house california roll
Sushi (calamari, octopus with house dressing, sea urchin, king crab, torched tuna belly, scallop, shrimp, salmon roe, mackerel, tuna, ocean trout, and a few others I forgot the name of unfortunately)
Crispy Fried Spanish Mackerel 
Vanilla ice cream with red bean, fruit, and jello
Panna cotta with lime granita

The chef team was very professional and friendly. You can tell they loved what they do!

This was my first Omakase experience and it definitely set the bar. Thanks for a great dinner experience Chef Kaji and team!"}
{"text":"As a huge fan of Japanese Omakase, Maybe my expectation was set too high, as well as given the riduculous prices, this has been one of my biggest disappointment in Japanese Omakase dinner!
I would give 5 out of 10 for food: we have been trying many omakase dinners in Tokyo,Toronto, San Francisco, and New York. This one by far is the worst in terms of quality of food and portion. I think the chef was too focused on giving a good \"performance\", the way he prepared sushi was exaggerating but u can't tell he put too much effort in it.. turned out the sushi rice was not sticky enough and they spreaded apart on the plate... secondly, he put on sauce very randomly, he would either put too much wasabi or too much teriyaki sauce on the food, which made it either too spicy or too sweet, and i literally felt like i was eating sauce. Also the portion of the food was too little. I know what the portion supposed to be for a regular omakase dinner, normally i get 8/10 full but i just felt like i ate nothing today!

In terms of the pace and service, that's a very big Minus. Our reservation was at 6pm, and we didnt get our first course until 6:30.  All we did was waiting and waiting and we ended up playing our phones. As their chair was not comfortable enough, my hip started to feel numb after sitting there waiting for food for 30 minutes. We had to wait for at least 15 minutes before the next dish is ready..Then as soon as we started with omakase sushi, we were rushed by the chef. While i was still eating my first piece, the 2nd piece was put on the plate and the chef couldnt wait until i swallowed my first one... so while i was busy munching the first piece i had to also listen to the chef to introduce the 2nd piece.
This was supposed to be a very high end omakase restaurant given the price on the menu, therefore i expect the service and the ambiance of the restaurant also to be 5 star level. However this led to another disappointment. When we first went in the restaurant, we saw smoke in the kitchen as the chef was busy cooking deep fried food behind the counter, and this kept going on for the entire meal. and my hair literally smell like smoke after dinner; i expect this to be a peaceful sushi bar but not an izakaya place.  They would turn on the water and it got splashed onto customers.. they put cooked food in the ziplock box which u can buy tons from dollar store,and brought to the back for them to decorate. Im not saying the plastic boxes are wrong, but as a high end restaurant, shouldnt you hide this from customers and only present the nicely decorated ones? There was no interaction between the chef and customers, then whats the point of setting a sushi bar? 
So many other things i was upset abt this restaurant, i dont think it's me being picky. However as rated the best omakase restaurant in Toronto, as well as the price,this is far away from well deserving the ranking. 
There are not many omakase restaurants in Toronto, but Yasu and Zen are way better and reasonable in price. Their food qualities are better too.
Dont think will ever go back!!"}
{"text":"mind.blowing!  i just ate here for the first time and will come back again when i can afford it lol. it's mad expensive but this ain't your typical ayce joint. your tastebuds would be screaming WTF that F'ing deliscious! i tried the waza tasting menu and every item i got was hella tasty man! if you're lucky to score a seat at the bar too go for it and watch the chef's create masterfully crafted sashimi and sushi in the most graceful manner! service was really attentive as well and the place was pretty packed. only con, its really out of the way specially esp. if your from the dt core."}
{"text":"Islington station? What's at Islington station? Is that on the Bloor or Yonge line?
Then we have to cab? Why? When do we have to leave?

I asked a tsunami of questions and hurled them at my girlfriend. She smiled and said, \"I'm excited... you'll like it!\"

She knows me so so well now. She knows what type of cuisine I adore. She knows that I respect the ratings on Yelp. After much research and time, she planned a magical evening for two at a cozy Japanese Restaurant called Kaji.

Omakase! she said. Only 2 choices... $100 annnnnnd $120. As though she knew I was hungry, as though she knew I awaited this moment to come...

We get there by subway, then a 8 minute taxi ride from Islington station. It was a small restaurant, kinda in the middle of no where. I expected it to be like this, after all, we were in Etobicoke. After getting our coats hung, we sat at the bar right in front of the action. It was amazing to see such skill, precision and detail to the master's movements. The way he packed the rice into the molds, placed the seared eel on top and brushed it delicately with sweet soy and mirin, it was bliss. 

We decided to order one of each of the Omakase options so that we could both try a bit of everything. The Omakase options are different. Each have unique starters and middles in between sashimi and sushi/noodle rounds. We liked the $100 Omakase dishes over all. You receive a couple less dishes but the tastes and flavours were preferred. 

If you're seeking perfection in food, presentation and flavour, then Kaji is your destination. I wondered why the dining experience was at a premium, but it made sense as each course was presented before us. A unique combination of sweet, salty, sour, and bitter flavours flooded our taste buds with every morsel. 

For me, the sashimi plate was the ultimate treat. Salmon, tuna, snapper, lobster, octopus with fresh grated wasabi root. If you haven't tried fresh wasabi before, make it a goal in the new year. The heat and flavour are tremendously different than it's paste or powder counterpart, in a good way. Anyways, the sashimi was fresh beyond belief. Silky, melt in your mouth, and oceanic, it was heaven with each bite. I actually moaned with each bite. We commented on the beauty and sophistication of each dish. Thought and well-preparation went into all the courses. You could immediately tell by each distinct component/ingredient that they used had a purpose. The shredded radish, the knotted burdock root, the shiso leaf, etc. they awaken your taste buds but also impart a twist of essence. 

Overall, Kaji introduced me to an experience I've never had before. It was a special meal for me, besides it being my birthday. It was the first time I tried uni, it was the first time I had impeccably fresh sashimi, it was the first time I had a structured adventure from plate to bowl. If anything, the food justifies the price. When will you ever have so many memorable firsts in one night? I personally lost count myself, but I had the time of my life."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Japanese restaurant in Toronto! Their omakase comes at a hefty price but it is well worth it! I've also been to Hashimoto for omakase at $300 per person but I much prefer Kaji's menu and flavours. The menu changes every month but you can expect the delicate and subtle flavours to be impeccable each time. It always ends with a selection of excellent sushi, and Kaji has modified his menu so that it doesn't have as much rice as it used to, since he knows everyone is quite stuffed towards the end. He's also very entertaining as he prepares the sushi, especially if he's been offered sake by customers."}
{"text":"I've never had fresher, more masterfully prepared sushi anywhere. Nobu and Morimoto's dishes are delicious and beautiful. The Hump in Los Angeles is fearless and inventive. But the fish at this small, humble restaurant is the very soul of the ocean. The place is packed. But a reservation is easily obtained--even on short notice. Choose from 3 omakase menus, $80, 100 or 120. Don't worry, you'll be happy with whichever menu you choose. Sit at the sushi bar if you can to observe the good-humored Kaji at work."}
{"text":"Service was very good, food was fantastic, each dish beautifully presented.  We had the $130 menu which included sashimi:  blue fin tuna, Spanish mackerel and sea bream.  Each item was served individually, the appetizer, the sashimi, salad, grilled fish, then a series of delicious sushi, a light noodle dish, hot tea and dessert. We were quite full.  Restaurant is attractive, with light wood decor.  The location in Etobicoke is a little  out of the way, but well worth the drive."}
{"text":"2.5 stars 

I specifically reserved to be seated at the sushi bar so we can see the chefs at work. Unfortunately, there's a sink that stretches almost half of the sushi bar so in the end, we were seated at the bar, but didn't get to see much of the action. I was also a little disappointed that the food wasn't delivered straight from the sushi chef to us over the sushi bar, but instead from the other side via waiters whom explained what the dishes were. Was hoping for more of a chef-diner repertoire.

The food quality was decent, but I did not think it was worth the price we paid. There are other omakase places for similar price that has better quality fish and has a more tailored experience. I found the menu to have a heavier focus on appetizers and cooked dishes rather than the sushi, which means by the time the sushi was served, I was already quite filled.

That being said, I enjoyed their toro (which we ordered for an extra $20/2 prices), which is usually a star dish for me but felt the rest of the meal was filled with too many \"fluff\" dishes and sushi choices. Sad to say I don't think it was deserving as \"one of the best tasting menus\" in the area and that I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"OK I heard so many good things about Kaji's omakase sets... so we came here and had the shun ($180 per person set) it has some hot dishes (pasta, soup) waygu beef slices you dip in egg) and sushi...

And we didn't feel satisfied after the meal or that it was anything amazing. It was really nothing special.

Even tho we sat at the bar, we felt no interaction with the chefs, they just handed us our food.

The waitress/waiter describes the food to us and we can not understand them... are they speaking English?

Didn't find anything spectacular about this place, and money is not even the problem, we don't mind paying for good food. But it was really just \"meh\""}
{"text":"This place is amazing 
Best sushi I have ever had. The people who work there are super nice and the food is amazing 
Would recommend to get the bigger menu so you get to taste everything. 
At least go once to experience the great food :)"}
{"text":"I went to sushi Kaji with my frd, this is my first time to go there . So excited. Nice restaurant that I've been to, good food quality. I drunk sake n plum wine. Fresh n creative food that I really like. I'll come again, if you wanna treat some one well, pls take them to here."}
{"text":"To be honest, I've never tried anything like this before.  Had to have been my first real Japanese dining experience.  Not a fan of wasabi but everything I tried was delicious.  Very fresh was many layers of flavour.  It was also nice to see that each dish was so aesthetically pleasing to the eye, almost an artform."}
{"text":"Unforgettable once in a lifetime meal. Freshest fish and remarkable combinations. Soya sauce made by chef. Lots of smokey overtones to dishes. Very professional and friendly staff. Super expensive."}
{"text":"Came here for my wedding anniversary and wanted to impress my wife.

She was impressed // end of story.

All the small courses were creative artistic and very flavorable.

The octopus was surprisingly good!  Never knew octopus could taste so good!!

Toro here was fresh fatty and amazing.   I can't remeber the last time i had toro in toronto.

All in all it was a great experience.

I'll come again at my next big event."}
{"text":"400+for 2 with tasting menu and drinks. We were really full of sushi. Their sashimi and everything is really fresh. Service is good. Courses were a little boring, too much sushi."}
{"text":"This is one of the most expensive and consistently top-ranked sushi experiences in the GTA. I must admit that the food is just splendid. You have a choice of three menus with a different price level for each. These are inventive, creative and flow well. Not the best decor and atmosphere for the price point didn't meet expectations. Best reserved for those who are serious about not compromising their sushi tastes with no regard for the final bill."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for our anniversary.  She loves sushi and this was by far the best and freshest sushi we ever had.  It was so fresh that one of the shrimps was still twitching when it was on the plate.  The price is hight but I think worth it, and the food was plentiful so we didn't walk away hungry.   We were pleasantly surprised when she received a  beautiful bouquet of flowers made out of fresh vegetables.  Can't wait to go back again, but I have to save up first."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh and creative sushi and Japanese dishes. Expensive omakase menu so not something to do regularly but great for special occasions. 

Took my wife here for our anniversary. They gave her a hand carved radish flower. Beautiful and a nice touch. 

Every dish was delicious and the portions were good. I was concerned at first that I would still be hungry but there was plenty of food."}
{"text":"Omg!  This restaurant is special.  I took my lady lover for a super romantic birthday dinner here and we tried their extensive tasting menu.  Mid-way through the meal, we expressed that this was already one of the best culinary experiences we had ever had.  And that was even before the Chef's prepared an artistic take-home birthday flower for my lady, fashioned from fresh fruit and vegetables.  It was a wonderful surprise and addition to already amazing experience.

Granted, the cost is $120 pp, so with tax and tip, this place is reserved for the rich and famous, or in my case, those who make \"poor\" choices with their money.  But it was overall well worth it!

I have recommended this place to my friends and family and I will certainly return... soon as I can reasonably justify that I can afford to do so."}
{"text":"One of the best Japanese tasting menus in Toronto. I came here on a Saturday evening with three of my friends in June 2015. We made reservations at the bar and were seated in the corner, surrounding the chef's team. 

I ordered the Waza tasting menu ($120), which had numerous courses of appetizers, hot dishes, and pieces of perfectly crafted sushi. The first appetizer was a soft boiled egg served with a broth with leeks and shrimp. The soft boiled egg was warm and not too salty. The next appetizer was a platter of thin-cut sashimi, which gave us a taste of the raw fish to come. At this point, I could already differentiate between the quality of fish at Sushi Kaji compared with other sushi establishments. Next, we were each given a pot of duck with udon noodle soup and green onions. The noodle soup was very savoury and satisfying. The last dish we had before the sushi was served was a cold, green soba noodle topped with some wasabi. This was a very refreshing compliment to our dinner.

At this point we were almost full, while the sushi had not been served yet. One of the chefs then proceeded to efficiently serve sushi to us on individual plates, one after another. Each piece of sushi was amazing and made with so much care. My favourite piece was the salmon sushi topped with some salmon roe. I enjoyed sitting at the bar for this aspect, as the chef explained each piece of sushi to us and served them immediately after he prepared them.

We also shared the $80 Wagyu beef. This was also an interesting and unique experience - we were provided with the hotpot to cook the beef ourselves, as well as a raw egg to dip the beef in. The beef was tender and fatty, while the egg yolk provided the perfect flavor.

The only con we noted was that there was no alcohol served that night due to a health inspection, so be sure to call and check beforehand. Overall we had an amazing dining experience here, and I will definitely be coming back to Sushi Kaji in the future."}
{"text":"I was taken to Sushi Kaji for my birthday and was quite excited given the hype of the place. Don't get me wrong, the meal was perfectly fine but it really wasn't memorable. For the price we paid (we got the Takumi set), I think we could have gotten an equally if not a better meal."}
{"text":"Sushi Kaji is probably the best Japanese restaurant in the city. If not, it's definitely up there. It's also probably the most expensive Japanese restaurant in the city. Sushi Kaji has a set of 2-3 tasting menu that differ in their number of courses and slightly in their content. If you're going to go, just get the most expensive course. You're going to drop a bunch of money even their cheapest course, so you may as well go all the way. My friends and I sat at the Sushi bar, and that is what you want to do. Watching the chefs cook is probably just as good as eating the food they produce. I enjoyed everything we were served. It all looked and tasted great. This is the sort of place you need a real reason to go. My advice is to find one and go already."}
{"text":"Long overdue review of the infamous sushi kaji.

My fiancé and I went to celebrate our anniversary in December. It was super easy for him to book a reservation. He just called them. They ask on the phone if he was booking for a special occasion.

*Tip* sit at the bar! Definitely the place to see all the action. We ordered two $120 tasting menus and added a wagyu hot pot. 

We got dishes right away. I can't even name all the dishes we tried, but if you look at my pictures, you will see! The sushi was so fresh and the hot dishes were so nicely plated, and tasted delicious. They spaced out the items nicely. The tea kept coming and was never empty. The wagyu beef was amazing! It put us over the top, but it was so tender and melted in your mouth!

One of the Chef's made us a fresh veggie flower arrangement! It was so cool watching him crave the veggies into flowers and little did we know, they were for us! They even wrapped it up for us to take home! So awesome!

This place is great for special occasions. The bill is hefty, about $350, but it was totally worth it! A sushi experience worth trying!"}
{"text":"Was passing by the area and arrived at 6pm when they just opened.  They only had 2 people in the restaurant. Told us they were full. They kicked us out and gave us a paper that had 2 items on it and said that's all we serve.  One was for $100per person and the other for $120pp.  They had no other menu.  I don't think I'll be back.  Place look small and I don't think its worth the money or the drive."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful:  each dish has its own distinct taste (sauce) and texture, and makes each dish unique; the seafood is very fresh; each sauce is seasoned perfectly; the sushi rice is seasoned perfectly and packed at the optimal density.  

However, for the price of $80, $100, or $120, I would expect the fish to be slightly more exotic, and not just tuna, tai, spanish mackerel, etc.  Maybe I am spoiled living close to the sea?"}
{"text":"I've been to Sushi Kaji around 5 times within the last 10 years and the quality is always great. However, the prices have spiked within the last few years, and I know that usually this reflects market value, especially since they get their fish from Japan, but it just doesn't seem worth the price tag anymore. Especially with spots like Yasu.

It is a good idea to call ahead and make reservations, as it is quite small inside so I wouldn't risk just walking in here. 

The food is really good though, and the sushi/sashimi is very fresh. The dishes are creative and a nice spin to traditional Japanese food. I think that if you don't mind paying the hefty price, it is a nice spot to go to for special occasions. The thing they do differently here than Yasu is, they have cooked/hot dishes as well. If you're only looking for a sushi experience then I recommend Yasu instead.

The servers are nice, but their English is not great at all. Every dish that was served they would explain what it was but we weren't able to understand them very well.

The décor is very nice and the overall appearance of the place is very clean."}
{"text":"This place does great sushi; the other reviews here give it justice.  And they serve liquids in cute carved bamboo cups/containers :)

The interior of the place is a bit disappointing though.  It looks a bit like an 'upscale cafeteria'.

For the price of the food, I'd personally still recommend the Japanese restaurant Nami downtown as a better choice (Nami will be a bit cheaper too)."}
{"text":"Kaji Sushi is one of the best sushi restaurants in Canada, it is located on Queensway in Etobicoke.

 Once you've tried there, it  will surely change your perception on Japanese food.  Mitsuhiro Kaji is a very fun person to talk to, the service was very good.

  As mentioned by Mitsuhiro Kaji, most of his ingredients are flown directly from Japan with his fish being received within 24 hours from when the fish left the water.  There's 3 choices to choose from in the menu ranging from $80-$120 per person.  
I was amazed with the food when it arrived at the table, all dishes were so unique just like a piece of art.  

  Strongly recommend this restaurant to everyone who loves Japanese Food.  Yes, the cost is very expensive but it's all worth it !!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi place! 
Great attentive waiters and staff, try hard to please. Sushi is great, mid sized seating area. Always easy to find a seat."}
{"text":"I couldn't after these years suspend my disbelief .Linear ;in the service of quality is fine as long as the quality delivers.Pricey and..
       It didn't .
Availability ( range was limited) A majority of raw fish items were blow torched and covered with added Goop.
Mushroom hot custard and broth were fine.
HotParchment seafood distinctly fishy.
Then more cooked fish as sushi .
Dessert sorbet/ ice was passable with Ma's green food colouring macaroon -abominable.
Friendly crowd; cool Canadian sous sushi dude behind the the bar.
? Even the best bend to the steely reality of our metropolis:::home of the famous three day old fresh fish..

{"text":"I was there for my boyfriend's mother's birthday dinner. We had out reservation for 6pm because we knew the dinner would take a few hours. We arrived and was disappointed with how the restaurant looked on the outside. Very typical japanese cheap restaurant look. Anyway, we headed inside and coat checked our belongings and sat us down. Because it was the 3 of us, we sat at the tables (also very cheap looking) but if you are going with a date, the bar area is very nice!!

The meal costed us $130 each and it consisted of a various sashimis and sushis which were very fresh. It seemed like the whole fish was cut on the spot! You would never taste any \"frozen\" pieces and the buttery fishes REALLY melted in your mouth. I was amazed by the wasabi as well. I'm not sure if it was the real one or powdered ones, but it was delicious! A little went a long way. At the end were three desserts but honestly... nothing special. Very typical desserts and the taste as well, were typical. 

Overall, the food was OK... not worth the price and service... (service is terrible) but would go back to experience the bar."}
{"text":"Came here for my husband's birthday a few nights ago and we had a great experience. From reading reviews prior to coming here, I was hoping to get a seat at the bar. But it was packed (small restaurant) and we got a table instead. I didn't mind at all. It was a pleasant atmosphere and service was great. I was hesitant about certain menu items (I don't like mushrooms or eel) but everything we tried was delicious. We had a choice of 3 different main courses and we both chose the Wagyu beef. The main course was really big and I regret not ordering something different from my husband so we could share and try more food. Food was $190 per person and after alcohol, tip and tax it came to $560. I highly recommend trying this if you love sashimi. Freshest fish I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Freshest sashimi I've ever tasted, great tasting menu and unpretentious friendly atmosphere... my fav sushi place in TO now. We got the chef to drink sake with us - he's quite a joker! All staff is very friendly and love to chat! We recommend engaging the cooks for an even better experience! My bf's fav is steamed eggplant stuffed chicken soup, hands down. Mine is the sashimi plate ... it's actually hard to use chopsticks as the fish is so fresh! Loved it!"}
{"text":"For this price, I expected more on both food and service. Sushi are fresh but not like amazing. There is a chef tried to rush us to eat sushi. It doesn't worth to try. But if you are baller, go for it."}
{"text":"Special place.
Very impressed.
Food, presentation, service.
If you are looking for quality that's the place."}
{"text":"I've been hesitating to write a review for this restaurant. I have mixed feelings about it. 

Yes the fish is fresh like everyone said. But at this price range, you expect it to be. 
Yes everything was nicely presented but honestly, I can't remembered what they tasted like or looked like.
Yes I enjoyed the way the menu was presented. Tasting menus are fun because they separate the dishes and put them on little plates so you eat them one by one as opposed to having everything on one big plate. This way, you eat in the order that the chef has specifically prepared. However,  nothing WOWed me. 

The price tag was hefty at $130 pp and it just left me wanting a little more from the experience. STILL, if you are an avid sushi / sashimi lover, then this is still a must try restaurant. However, if you are happy with your AYCE places, then this place won't really wow you."}
{"text":"I will echo the other reviewers - wow.

Sushi Kaji is certainly not your everyday sushi place at the $80 - $120 per person price-point, and I got treated here for a recent birthday. I had been wanting to try it ever since my Japanese co-worker told me this is the best Japanese restaurant in Toronto - a recommendation I put a lot of stock in.

What I didn't expect is the inventive-ness of the menu - it really was a great tasting menu. I think I still enjoyed the sashimi the most - the raw tiger shrimp with cream sauce was AMAZING! But I didn't expect everything else - the cream coffee mousse, the abalone - I could go on and on but as another reviewer mentioned, the menu changes frequently so there's really no point. Just go with an open mind and enjoy!

As a frame of reference, I would rank it up there with Morimoto in NYC - the only other restaurant that I would say would come close. I guess the main difference is the decor - this one is unassuming - I found it hardly different from a sushi restaurant that servers $10 bento boxes, while Morimoto looks and feels expensive. The service was neutral - decent but not outstanding. But in all, a great choice when celebrating a special occasion for a very memorable meal!"}
{"text":"You can watch chef Mitsuhiro Kaji and his skills in the kitchen (if you sit at the bar, right in front of your table). 
There's no à la carte menu here; instead, the restaurant serves food omakase style. 
The tasting menu sushi is all the chef's creations and varies by the night. 
Luckily, you're in good hands--Kaji's concoctions are both creative and delicious. On special occasions like an anniversary or birthday, you may be treated to a flowery bouquet of fresh vegetables."}
{"text":"If I can select zero stars I would. Save yourself some money and buy yourself a nice $10 ramen. 
If you booked this place, it's ok to not show up. RUN AWAY NOW. They don't really care that much about the art of making omakase and everything was super sauced and wasabi'd. What is the teriyaki sauce doing on a beautiful peace of fresh fish flown in from Japan??"}
{"text":"If you are a sushi lover stop eating only at AYCE joints and try something more authentic yet innovative.  

Downsides are the price and the fact that the place is reservation only... if you are lucky you can find a cancellation and jump the queue.

I can only afford to come to this place on a once-in-a-blue-moon special occasion."}
{"text":"Food was amazing service also :) bit pricy but you know what you getting. I wish it was somewhere in Yorkvile"}
{"text":"The experience is one of a kind, and you can kind of see why they call him the Jiro of Canada. The only real issue I had was the heat. I feel the need to dress up in a place like this, but with it, sweat my butt off...especially if seated in front of the stove.
That being said, the meal and experience was excellent, but the pricings are way off. It is alreay a $120 meal, but $50 more to replace the fish with wagyu sukiyaki. $80 for wagyu steak. The sukiyaki was amazing but $50 for that portion of it? I dunno...
I'd say the entire meal was worth about $100, not $170. The restaurant needs to chill with the prices...but I guess rich people will pay, and unfortunately I won't have the luxury of going back until I myself am rich."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Japanese in Toronto, but doesn't even compare to restaurants in BC. 

I've been several times, and at my most recent visits, nothing has really improved or changed. 

They need to start getting creative. But I still love you Sushi Kaji!!"}
{"text":"Come here once a year for the past three years. Always fresh and well balanced menu served with good portion size and brilliant colour. Unfortunately this time the amount of wasabi in them was a bit too much for me. 

It takes about 1.5-2 hours to complete the meal. I would suggest visiting on Sunday evening as you can find free parking with on the street."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review base on a Japanese standard. My wife and I travelled to Japan several times and had some amazing authentic sushi. Given the price at Kaji, we were hoping for some Ginza level food. We chose the $160 Waza and had 3 drinks, $450 after tax and tips. Yes, I did pay tips even I was hugely disappointed. When you pay this great price, you expect great food, service and environment, but I cannot think of anything positive after the dinner. I will list some of the things bother me the most. 

First, the pace of servicing. They either let you wait 30 mins between dishes or rush to give you 6 pieces of sushi in 3 minutes. The assistant chef keeps bothering me when I have food in my mouth. 

Second, the environment. If you sit at the sushi bar, you literally sitting next to each other, elbow to elbow. When the waitress try to change my plate, I have to lean to the side to give her some space, so she can take away the soy sauce plate over my head. Another assistant chef was doing some heavy cooking on the stove when we first arrive and the whole restaurant was full of smoke. The most amazing scene happened not long after we arrived. I saw the chef quickly scratched his ass and kept touching food using the same hand. WOWWWWWWW! Tasty!!!!!!! The counter was full of dirty dishes and plastic boxes. Seriously, these stuff should be behind the curtain. If you ever seen a Thai Express kitchen in any food court, Kaji's front kitchen is slightly neater than Thai Express. The assistant chef was even training a rookie chef in front of us. Is this professional?  Is this supposed to be behind the curtain as well? Also, the tableware, furniture and the whole renovation (especially the washroom) are not $450 level.

Third, Mr. Kaji is so eager and over-exaggerated to show you all his knife and sushi-making techniques, however you can easily taste the negligence in his sushi, either improper amount of soy sauce / wasabi or the falling rice from sushi. For the same course, I have way too much wasabi in my sushi but my wife can barely taste any wasabi in hers. I totally agree that watching the chef's food preparation is a big part of omakase experience, but I believe the food quality should come first. I'm not paying $450 to watch a show.

Fourth, some weird and confusing details. I will say this restaurant has no attention to details. If you ever been to Japan, you must know the importance of details in their culture. The assistant chef gave us two pieces of sushi in one plate, so I was not sure if they were for one person or two. In fact, two pieces were for two of us. Why do you put them in one plate? Base on my experience, I believe the chef is supposed to wipe my serving plate after each sushi, so the sauce and flavour doesn't get mixed up, but chef at Kaji didn't bother to do that. In addition, my wife and I got different desserts at the end. Nobody ever asked us the choices, so I wonder why they made the decision on our behalf. The service you got from the waitress is just an average Canadian service. Don't expect any Japanese service.

To sum up, if I just paid half of the price, I probably won't spend a hour typing this review, but I feel my experience tonight is too ridiculous and disappointing. Basically, Kaji a 1 star restaurant with 5 star price. Guys, save your money and go somewhere else. And to people who gave high ratings, I'm sorry! You don't know sushi!"}
{"text":"Came during j-new year menu period. I have to say that it is below my expectation. Taste was good, but not as good as its price. The sushis are filled with a lot of wasabi (especially lobster sushi). Also tried the wagyu sukiyaki, which might be the only lightspot among the whole meal.
Also i felt uncomfortable after finishing the meal, hope those seafoods are as fresh as they mensioned."}
{"text":"I'm going to let the cat out of the bag: This was my favourite meal of all time. At no less than 3 different points did I exclaim \"Oh my god this is the best thing I've ever tasted\".

From the Asian spin on Duck and Foie Gras, to the Toro Sashimi, to the A5 Kagoshima Wagyu, this was a parade of world class ingredients, prepared with precision far beyond what I am qualified to comment on. Every step of the meal was as new adventurezand by the end I was full and completely sated.

The service was spectacular, as servers are constantly monitoring to ensure your enjoyment. They also share valuable information on how to eat what is presented in the optimal way (its not always obvious).

The price tag is considerable, and whether it's \"worth it\" or not is entirely subject to how much you appreciate food. Kaji is about as good as it gets. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of my favourite omakase places! A little pricey and takes a little bit of travel from Toronto, but it is definitely worth it for the food, quality and experience! Every part of the tasting menu was fantastic.

I took my boyfriend here to celebrate his birthday, and also got to sit in front of Kaji. It was amazing seeing him prepare sushi in front of us and having him ask us how we liked it. 

I would definitely recommend this place for a special occasion, and to also request sitting at the bar when you book for a more unique experience."}
{"text":"Had $100 and $120 with my friend. Really full filling! The appetizers are okay..but the sashimi and sushi are very fresh and delicious. Sashimi includes 3 pcs toro, sushi includes toro sushi and chopped toro, uni sushi as well and more varieties of other fishes of course . I would say the money is worth to try out the best sushi and sashimi in Toronto."}
{"text":"i dont think i will go to kaji again. Yellow tail was over cooked; unagi sushi with too much soya, you wanna make a unagi sushi soup with soya? Also, toro belly with kinds of teriyaki sauce, are you joking? I was expected Kaji for a year, however, I was disappointed. Foods were fresh, but not amazing. Services was not that good.I live in Toronto, it doesn't means my tongue is frozen. Hope u would have some new dishes."}
{"text":"I love this place. There are three set menus that you can pick ($100/person, around $130/person, around $150/person). After ordering drinks and stuff, the bill can be almost $200 per person but I think it's worth it. You will be stuffed and satisfied when you walk out the door."}
{"text":"i've only been once, but the food is exceptional - the best japanese in toronto.  actually, better than many good japanese places in japan.

as for the price, you know what you're getting into."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi  & Good experience.  

I was seated by the bar which gave me the  experience of watching all the chefs prep the food. Overall, I would highly recommend this omakase experience. It's a bit on the pricey side compared to most of the omakase's in Toronto but I would give this place a chance because of the quality of the food. I got the wagyu beef menu which was $180 (SHUN). The other option was $130 (TAKUMI) without the Wagyu. The wagyu beef wasn't worth it for another $50, which was served with very buttery sauce,  mushrooms, and a side of soft pouch egg sauce. It wasn't good at all so I wouldn't recommend it. The only thing that I would have to say is that the chefs aren't as interactive. So if you're looking for the private experience with the chefs, this wouldn't be a place. All the chefs have different roles in the bar/kitchen. Chef Kaji was the one in charge of the sashimi and sushi. 


Btw, after leaving this place I was extremely bloated! Be prepared to eat lots of food. :)"}
{"text":"My bf and I got the tasting menu. None of us drink so the bill came out around 350, and the food is worth the money. Delicate and creative Japanese cuisine. Food materials are high end but nothing too out of the box. It is the effort in creativity that made it unique. Sit at the bar instead of table would be a good idea."}
{"text":"Wow.  I had the most incredible meal here.  Many fantastic courses, but also not \"too much\" - like a gigantic menu at French Laundry or the old Susur.  This was perfect - innovative, fresh, light, beautifully presented.  I can see why this is the #1 ranked restaurant in Toronto (Zagat).  Well earned."}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing experience not because anything bad happened but because nothing special happened! You expect something special to happen when you are spending $160 on one person and $190 for another just for the tasting menus. (Tax tip and drinks not included). 
Everything was mediocre. The presentation, taste service and atmosphere were all average to below average.... the bill certainly was not!  For that kind of money I expected the harbour 60 or blueblood experience. This was not the diamond in the rough its reputation and prices led me to believe."}
{"text":"To start, if I could give 6 stars I would.

This was the stand alone most amazing meal I have ever had in my entire life.  A brilliantly choreographed symphony of flavours and textures within each offering.  I ordered the Takumi set.  At $120 a person, no doubt the price is quite steep.  The most expensive meal I have ever eaten, but I can honestly say worth every cent.  The experience was nothing like any I have had before.  It was life changing.  I will never see japanese food the same again.  It will almost surely seem subpar.

Called ahead to reserve sushi bar seats, which I highly recommend.  I agree with the analogy that securing these seats is analogous to court side air canada centre.  You get to watch everything come together and all the magic happen.  Reservations more than a week ahead are a must.

Parking is street, or if you are lucky, tiny lot next to the restaurant.  Such an intriguing experience, as it is nestled on a little strip on the queensway, adult video store just a couple stores down.  Appears completely nondescript, as if just another of the many japanese food establishments dotted all over the city.  Casual dress, casual environment, but the food is anything but.  It was a long educating journey of a meal.  Ever so slight of a pause between courses, but not long enough to disrupt the flow one bit.

Life altering. Go.  Go now!"}
{"text":"An omakase experience that's more than just sashimi. Kaji was a great experience and very unexpected given the inconspicuous location in Etobicoke.

The restaurant has a classic bar style seating and then a couple tables behind as well. I definitely recommend getting seats at the bar so you can watch all the action.

We got the Shun and left very satisfied. It's a lot of food given the set has both sashimi as well as other hot foods with udon, soup, and meats.

At $180 per person, it is pricy but worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Why would you offer reservations at 9pm if you are not going to serve omakase. Instead of an omakase experience, everything was served at once while we watched them scrub the kitchen sink. 

For $350, you'll get subpar food served by an intoxicated chef. My girlfriend puked when she got home from the food - no exaggeration here.

If you want a real omakase experience you should go to Yasu, where it is $80/person vs. $150/person at Kaji."}
{"text":"My brother took me here for my birthday and I was very disappointed.
Apparently my brother told me it's supposed to be a full on 3 hour set meal - this was not the case. We essentially were rushed to eat our meals and the waitress kept coming to take our plates and serving us the next dish when we weren't even finished our current one. They essentially kicked us out in an hour!
The fish was fresh I'll give them that, but in terms of selection it was okay, nothing special. The only sushi that stood out to me the most was the squid - soft but chewy texture, more tender than other places where I've had it. 

Seems like they changed the style of how they run their restaurant. Would not come back especially since this is quite far from where I live. Completely not worth the trip, there's way better options elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wow, really fantastic! Though I have never been to Japan, I have traveled much of te world and this truly is one of, if not the BEST sushi I have ever had! But do expect to pay, your not going to some corner everyday shop... but relative to quality and quantity ...It's a bargain!

Love it!!!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to go to Kaji, but ends up very disappointed.
We made reservation at 830pm, even it was summer time, but very cold that night. We were freezing. At the beginning, they gave us freezing cold hand towels. My friend WAS NOT very happy about it at all.  
Me and my friend ordered the $130/person Takumi. For this price, you expected at least some good quality of food and good service, not in this case. The sashimi and sushi were good and fresh but not outstanding. (not for $130).  The appetizer and dessert were below average. The service was cold too, everything was rushed. At the end, my friend still very hungry, we went to other place for more food. It was very sad. Not recommend this place at all, there are so many great Japanese restaurants in Toronto, don't wast your money there."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my wife for dinner and was not impressed at all.  We chose the $130 per person Takumi set and felt it didn't live up to the hype.  Let me first off say that the service was excellent!  They constantly go around looking to see if your cup needed refills  without you having to signal them down which was great!  Where it fell short was the taste.  We have been to Yasu and ZeN and since this restaurant was the most expensive in comparison, we had high hopes that it would blow the other 2 away but nope! The amount of wasabi used on the sushi was way too much which overpowered the natural taste of the fish.  We felt like we should have said something to the master sushi chef but we knew it would have been a total diss to him so we just kept our mouths shut and ate it anyway :( The balance was just not there!  We looked forward to tasting uni but it never came.  It just wasn t on the menu :( Nothing really blew us away on the menu which was very unfortunate."}
{"text":"As Shang Tsung used to say: \"EXCEELLLLLLENT\"."}
{"text":"Went here as a splurge bday dinner with my friend and we got one of the 130 menu and one of the 180 menu to be able to try everything. 

Kaji is everything everyone says it is. The mix of cooked and raw food is fantastic. The 130 menu has a cooked fish soup as it's main course and it's a bit plain, but the Wagyu sukiyaki dish from the 180 menu more than made up for it. It is amazing.

Definitely somewhere everyone has to visit at least once, but hard to just come by for casual dinners."}
{"text":"THIS. PLACE. GOT. RENOVATED!

With the new renos, the bar area has been significantly enlarged and now seats approximately 12 people (versus 6 from before)!!! This has really transformed the space into an open kitchen concept and gives you better vantage points to watch chef Kaji live. The overall capacity likely remains the same. They've also replaced the boring dry wall with black stones and large inlaid murals of Japanese calligraphy. Gone is the ghetto-chic look of yore, but if you look carefully, their kitschy mustard colour table covers remain. My only knock on Kaji was always the drab interior, but with these new renos, can I give it 6 stars yet?!

And yes, the food, as always was supreme - taste, texture, presentation and creativity. My well-traveled-and-dined cousins from abroad were mightily impressed and my dining partner - who's quite sensitive to that \"fishy\" smell - scarfed everything down. I can't wait to go back once my piggy bank's full again!"}
{"text":"Good:
1. A5 Wagyu steak - $80 addon for 2.5oz.  Came with 3 different condiments, great with just sea salt.  Taste and texture as you would expect.

2. Uni - I don't like uni normally but this is one of the best pieces from Hokkaido.  Super creamy.

3. Tuna - All servings of toro, otoro were amazing and melty.

4. Black cod - I highly recommend getting the $130 to get this instead of the Wagyu sukiyaki.  I feel Wagyu should be eaten in steak form and not in thin slices in broth.

5. Pear panacotta with yuzu sorbet was amazing!

Bad:
1. Nigiri all either had too much wasabi or the wasabi was too strong and overpowered all the delicate fish flavour.  Sauces/additions to the nigiri was often too heavy handed and drowned out the fish flavour.

Neutral:
1. Pacing of the meal was a bit odd.  Did the 6pm seating and didn't get amuse bouche until 6:30.  First few courses came out rather slowly.  Once the sushi course came, the pieces were made and placed on my plate faster than I could savour.

Worth it?:
Flavours and courses were good but not enough to overcome the unfortunate sushi course.  There wasn't that wow factor anywhere.  Overall I'd say not quite worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"Simply put...wow! 

This is the best Japanese food I've ever had, at least the best Omakase.

The $120 per person, 9 course Omakase is the perfect balance of sushi and cooked dishes; starts with 3-4 small courses spanning fish, meat, and vegetables, followed by an absolutely amazing sashimi platter, a few more traditional Japanese dishes and then a creative sushi platter, capped off by Japanese desert options.

Subtle, but interesting use of flavors and textures throughout make it a showcase of traditional japanese cuisine, but the occasional creative sparks add a slight edge. Where else do they blowtorch your scallop sushi and top it with green peppercorns? And trust me, smoky caramelized scallop crust and green pepper are a match made in heaven. 

Yes, comments on location and atmosphere are fair, but you go here for the food. End of story."}
{"text":"As close to the authentic sushi experience as you will get in Toronto! The sushi was very tasty and fresh, side dishes were also very good! I would definitely come here more often if it wasn't for the high price tag of the tasting menu."}
{"text":"Been lucky enough to visit this place once and it was a very memorable experience.  Our party of 3 sat at the sushi bar which was fantastic as we got to see all the moving parts up close. The tasting menu seemed to go on and on and on...the sashimi courses were delicious and unique- having travelled to Asia many times, I have never tasted some of these fish outside of Asia before so was thrilled to see them so well prepared locally.

The omikaze menu is not for everyone.  Its allot of food but very well paced.  Service is phenomenol.  Price although not an every meal thing, is completely justified.  A must try for the Japanese and foodie enthusiast"}
{"text":"I picked this place based on yelp reviews and i was not at all disappointed! 

The food was spectacular! The atmosphere was great! The service was great! The chefs were focused and professional! 

I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Kaji 

This is the place to be if you want a true authentic Japanese experience. Reserve a spot at the bar if you can so you can see the chefs at work! Two of us ordered the takumi meal for $130/person while one of us got the shun meal for $180/person in order to try the wagyu steak. 

Now, each portion is tiny, gone in 1 or two bites and only 1 piece of sushi each. But to my surprise I left feeling very full! The pace really forces you to slow down and appreciate the food. The wasabi here is also the real deal. It's not the fake stuff at AYCE places. So it is SPICY. I wanted to flip up the fish and take off some wasabi so it wouldn't over power the taste of the sushi but I was afraid of insulting the chef directly in front of me. The wagyu beef was tender but didn't live up to the hype or was worth the extra $50. The cod however was amazing as it melts on your tongue. Most of the sushi served was tuna and I would have liked to try some more obscure, rare fish. 

Overall it was a very unique experience that I recommend everyone try at least once. The menu changes each month and I would love to come back but it's so so so expensive. The servers/chefs even tell you how to eat each piece but they speak rushed and are difficult to understand. The atmosphere seems a little judgemental and I was very worried I wasn't eating properly or using the right utensil (most of the judgement came from the people around us to be honest). The attire is dressy and do not show up late for your reservation!"}
{"text":"Eating a meal at Sushi Kaji can only be described as an experience.  I came here with my husband for my birthday and it is, hands down the best sushi I've had in Toronto.  Fish was super fresh, the presentation of every dish that came was a piece of art, and watching them make each dish was also intriguing (who knew that a lobster antennae could be so beautiful?)  Each dish seemed to compliment the next perfectly.  We left crazily full.  Although expensive, worth every penny."}
{"text":"The food was great and definitely the best part of this restaurant.  We each ordered the $180 Omakase set with the melt in your month Wagyu steak.

We didn't sit at the bar area so can not comment on that experience however the surrounds was way below par.  I wish the decor reflected the price we were paying for the food.  On special occasions the total experience matters and so that was kind of a let down."}
