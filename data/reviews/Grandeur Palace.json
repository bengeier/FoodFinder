{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday around 10 am and waited for about half hour for a table of three. Which isn't too bad. Place is nice with great lighting and environment, like a typical dim sum restaurant in Hong Kong - busy, a lil nosy but fun! Service was kind of slow, food took forever to get to our table. After a while we looked at our bill to see what was missing to realize the waiter at the beginning who took our order forgot to circle 3 items on the menu, therefor it was not entered into the system. We bought it up the manager, Ken, who had to audacity to blame us for not checking and bringing this up a hour later after we sat down. First off, it's not our fault, I should not go to a restaurant and check our bill ever so often to realize things were not entered in your system when it is your job to check this over. Secondly, it wasn't till we bought it up that our food was taking slow that you finally mention to us that the system is down in the kitchen hence the slowness. Thirdly, he never apologized for a mistake one of his staff made.  Overall, a decent place to go to go, would definitely go back, but very very unsatisfied by the attitude of the manager."}
{"text":"Food is average -- nothing too special about their menu. Service is below par -- we only got tea at our table when we placed our order and they messed up our order. Environment is strange -- chairs had a yellow stretchy polyester covering on it, and it was dirty."}
{"text":"Service here is very frustrating.   We arrived and we're constantly budded by other people at the hostess stand to get a number for a table.   When our number was finally called, they wrote down a table number on the menu and handed it to me and pointed to the table we were sitting and told us to wait there because the couple there has paid and they're waiting for them to leave. While we were waiting for them to put on their coats, another hostess came by with another group of two and proceed to seat them there. We had to show them our menu to prove that the table is promised to us.   We finally sat down and marked the items we wanted on the menu. I handed it to a manager named Ken to input and it was brought back shortly after by someone else. While we were waiting for our food, a waiter put their whole basin of clean dishes on our table in order to set up another table. Upon waiting for 30 minutes, we asked Ken to check on our order and he said asked if we wanted to place the order now. We told him we placed the order already to which he said we did not because there's no white receipt attached. We informed him that we gave the order to him to which he silently took the menu and inputted it. When he returned, we checked the white receipt to make sure everything was there only to find out he missed an item. Once again, we flagged him down and informed him. He didn't even stop to talk. He simply stated as he passed us \"I know I missed it. I'll put it in for you\". He didn't even know which item he missed!! Of course he never came back and we had to find another waitress to put it our order.   We finally got our food but only 4 out of the 5 dishes came, which were all mediocre. We finished all four dishes and the last one still did not arrive. We ended up cancelling the last item. There was no apology from any of the staff and even as we were leaving Ken simply looked at us as we walked passed him.   If I could give a review of 0, I would."}
{"text":"I totally agree with the first post. If I could give this place a -5 stars I would. The service is soooooo slow and frustrating.   1. We made reservations, and when we arrived they said they didn't have our name down.   2. The waiters were not attentive. Took 10 mins to wave one down to take our order. The place is very understaffed that the hostess took our order.  3. We waiting about 40-45 mins for our food - we ordered 5 dishes. All the tables around us ordered around the same time and they had 2-3 dishes on their table.   4. The hostess who took our order forgot to put the order in for one of dishes plus the bowls of rice.   5. We were a table of 6 and was crammed for a tiny round table meant for 4 people. When we asked one of the waiters to transfer food from our massive dish to smaller ones to save table space, his reply was \"Im too busy and can't do it\".. and then reluctantly go gets us smaller plates for us to transfer the food ourselves.   6. When we asked them again for our bowls of rice, the waiter looks blankly like it was his responsibility to check up on the missing order.  The service here is extremely shitty. Had to ask them repeatedly for the same thing. This place is so bad that I felt I had to post my first review here to save all of you from the irritation I experienced.   Stay away. This place is not worth the hype."}
{"text":"It's a nice recently reno'd place with great food, and speedy service.   Dimsum was Delish!  Would come back again"}
{"text":"Very disorganized. My second time coming here, I came on January 15 and 29. We went early for early morning dim sum which is S-L for $2.90. We found out after we got our bill that it was regular price because it was CNY. Fine, I am fine with paying for it since we already ate it, but no one said anything and there was no sign. However if it's going to be full price, I am going to pay by credit.  We asked one waitress and she seemed confused. Then I said,\"if it is full price, I should be able to pay by credit card\". She said she would check. She asked someone else and he seemed confused. Four people seemed confused that I would want to pay by credit card. One guy even said it was okay for today since it is regular price but usually you can't at this time. I said \"I know\". That bothered me that they made such a thing about me paying by credit card, yet they didn't tell their customers that this was regular price even for morning dim sum. Cause why would we rush for morning when we could have come in the afternoon? Also if they didn't have time to explain or figured everyone would think this due to CNY, then they can cross it off at the bottom of the ordering sheet when we are seated. Then at least we have expectations. Afterwards, we over heard other people leaving that they didn't know it wasn't cheaper dim sum. Also, their waiters were so disorganized. I think they mixed a single table number with our number. So they constantly had to go between our table and that person's table. Even when the 1st dish came, we knew there was no way it was ours since our order sheet didn't come back yet.  So they had to come over to compare. So the other guy in the other table wasn't happy since his food was coming to my table. When a server would drop food down, and it was already crossed off they would ask why. Then we would say we ate it already and it must be for that table. Then they didn't get that their restaurant might have an error, so they said but isn't this your table number? And it was but it's not ours. I mean, if we say we ate it, what are they going to do? Why bother arguing with us? We still have to pay for it cause it was crossed off. Finally the greeting lady had to step in. The food wasn't bad but the service is really really bad. Last time I had the durian puff and it was frozen on the inside so I didn't order that this time. I still left a tip but the more I think about it, the more I wish I didn't."}
{"text":"The food is not good here, I've had both dim sum and dinner before. It's overpriced for such poor quality. Service is also garbage. I also hurt my tooth biting into bones three different times while eating the Peking Duck lettuce wrap (NOT supposed to have bones) and on top of that the lettuce itself cost $5. I've never heard of an extra charge for the lettuce. Both times were a waste of money and I am never coming back or recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"After a good review of this place from a foodie friend, we decided to give it a try on a quiet monday night dinner.  Didn't need reservations since the place was barely 1/5 full when we arrived at 6pm.  Service was very friendly from all staff and almost perfect from start to finish, except for the lack of a plate change after we had our crab dish.  We ordered the assorted meats with veggie soup, sweet n sour pork, chicken tofu with salted fish, lotus root and fried shrimp cake sandwich, a veggie dish, and the crab on fried rice.  Everything was just a bit lacking in flavour and wok hay.  Final bill was over $107 (tax included), not exactly a bargain meal either.  While servings were generous in the portion size, the prices do reflect it somewhat.  Overall just a lacklustre dinner."}
{"text":"Fried oysters smelled bad / weirdly fishy as soon as they arrived at the table. Took a bite of one and immediately spit it out - am pretty sure there was something not quite right about it.   The fried taro serving as the seafood \"birds nest\" was so thickly cut that it could barely be broken apart, let alone be edible.   Peking duck strangely didn't have much flavour.   Everything else was meh...which is exactly how I feel about this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I had some high hopes for the newly re-branded restaurant taking place of long-time Scarborough staple, Dragon Dynasty.  We came very early on a Saturday morning to celebrate my aunt's birthday (note it was about 1 week into Chinese New Year). My aunt came at 9am to claim a table early for the 12 of us.    Food: they did offer some more unique dim sum dishes aside from the traditional but I have to say nothing was particularly delicious or flavourful. Rather everything just fell below average in my opinion.  I tried everything we ordered but nothing stood out, I didn't go for seconds when there were leftovers, every was just meh. Good quality but meh in terms of flavour.  The restaurant itself is bright, airy. The old chairs have covers not which are weirdly foamy. The staff seem to be very overwhelmed as it was hard to get service (tea refills, plates taken away, etc) staff was nice though for the most part.    For the morning special we had more than enough food for 12 people, (with lots of leftovers) total was about $120 which was inexpensive but in the densely competitive market that is dim sum in the GTA-East- Grandeur lands just short of making it on the return list."}
{"text":"Abalone Sauce & BBQ Pork White Bun The sauce had a strong flavour and was like the main soul of the bun. I thought it was the taste of the wine in the sauce. When I read the name of the dish, the sauce was supposed abalone sauce which  I didn't really recognize the taste. Rather, I thought BBQ pork should be the theme of the bun instead.   Pan Fried Turnip Cake Taste was not bad. There were a lot of turnip chunks with preserved sausage meat inside the cake. The only complaint that I had was the cake shattered into pieces when I picked it up with my chopsticks. Well, you can argue that I might have used too much strength to pick up the piece with my chopsticks.  Curry Cuttlefish  It's slightly spicy to add flavour to the dish. But the Cuttlefish didn't taste very fresh.  Shrimp Sui Mai This dish was supposed to be my mist favourite dish but the shrimp was not fresh and the meat had no taste .  Layered Cake Smashed duck eggs were used as the layers. Not much comments could be made for this dish.   Wanted to order the BBQ Pork, it's at discounted price but the waitress said the dish was sold out"}
{"text":"Grandeur restaurant is a newly renovated restaurant that serves fine dining Chinese food. It is a very beautiful and grand restaurant, and they have several VIP rooms that you can reserve for large groups or parties. Went there with my family for Chinese New Years, and they have lots of special offers and discounts for their grand opening. We got their special chicken dish, which was 50% off, spicy eggplant in a clay pot, fried mushroom and vegetable and a whole steamed fish. Nothing special here, just your typical Chinese dishes which you can get elsewhere and the taste was the same - well seasoned but on the oily side. Everything came up to be $95 including tips (5 dishes with their daily soup). It also includes dessert (red bean soup, cookies and jello).   What was good? - the steamed fish was very fresh..and was perfectly cooked. I highly recommend their seafood, as I could see that they specialize in this...a lot of people at the restaurant ordered seafood dishes  What was bad? - everything else was average, was expecting it to be fine dining...presentation could be better and more distinct than your typical Chinese dish - service...was slow. That's an understatement actually. They gave us our rice after we were half done with all of our dishes  Recommendation:  Yes if you are going with your family and having seafood. I wouldn't go there again, although I heard good things with the dim sum, so Perhaps go there for lunch"}
{"text":"Came here today for a Chinese New Year dinner with my family. Yes i had expectations that it would be fairly busy, but my dinner turned into a disastrous nightmare. First plate came out at a fair time, but the second dish and every other dish after that came out EXTREMELY slow. It was crazy!  What kept us so rattled was a lobster. We ordered it in advance, and four hours later we never got it. Other people were getting their lobster besides us, which extremely frustrated us since we literally waited over two hours for a dish. We complained hundreds of times, and at one point we asked to just remove the lobster off our bill. The waiters refused and kept making excuses that our lobster was coming. We got it an hour later.  For the big family, the bill was over one grand, while we were literally being held hostage for five hours.  This was one of the most disastrous dinners in my whole lifetime."}
{"text":"This replaces the Dragon Dynasty and opened almost 1 year after the former one closed.Service is poor,despite the restaurant being not too busy on a Saturday lunch time.Staff not trained well despite the long period of renovation . Food also so so,barely old Chinatown standard,and certainly not well prepared. Jasmine Tea tastes low quality tea leaves. All our Teapots drips, and they are supposedly brand new!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday morning with family for some dim sum. I really enjoyed it, the food was fairly good quality, came out fast, and was hot! We had a table but noticed around 10am that the door was packed with people waiting for a spot.   Grandeur Palace has a fairly decent selection of dim sum. They don't supplement the dim sum sheet with carts though, like some places do. They have your typical fixings and every single dish we ordered was tasty. They had a bolo char siu bao when I was there and it was quite tasty. Really enjoyed that.   I would gladly make the trek here from Markham for dim sum."}
{"text":"Food: We came here for dinner and ordered 3 dishes: Sweet and sour pork chops, stir fry celery & mushrooms, steamed fish. The sauce for the Sweet and Sour Pork Chops was not bad but the pork chops were so dry it felt like I was eating jerky. Stir fry Celery & Mushrooms was quite food.  Dessert consistent of lychee sugar water (tong sui), mango pudding, and an almond cookie. All of which was quite good.  Service: Horrible service we wanted to just get up and leave. We ordered 3 dishes at 7:15pm. At 7:37pm the waiter informed us that one of the dishes (steamed fish) has ran out, so we switched to something else. Our first dish has arrived at 7:40pm. After finishing the first 2 dishes, it is now 8:15pm, 1hr has passed since we ordered, we asked the waiter but did not seem to care much. The 3rd and final dish arrived at 8:17pm.  Atmosphere: We were seated next to a cart of dirty plates, as you can imagine how loud it can be when servers are cleaning up and throwing dirty plates in the bin next to us.  Overall: Not coming back, we spent over 1.5hrs here and most of it was just waiting for below average food to arrive. 1 star for the stir fry veggies + 1 star for dessert."}
{"text":"Meh.  Some dishes were definitely better than others but my overall impression was actually \"meh\".    The good:   Baked rice with pork ribs.  Chicken feet.  Curry squid.  Chive and shrimp dumplings.  All solid portions but nothing was \"whoah\".    The meh:  Congee was so bland. Shrimp dumplings and siu mai were pretty average.  Durian pastry wasn't flakey at all.  The fact that I can't remember other dishes is never a good sign.    We came for the early bird dimsum special.  If it wasn't for the reduced prices, I don't think I ever would've given this place a chance.  I check Yelp and trust the ratings so upon seeing the not-so-great reviews, I was already worried."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. In the special menu, the Peking duck was on special for half off (39.99 original). I'm not an expert on how Peking duck is supposed to be, but overall it was pretty good. The sweet and sour pork (for $14.5) was excellent. We also got a Tofu/Seafood/Meat pot, it was also pretty good.  The service was fairly attentive. They were really quick with the tea, the napkins, etc. I was a bit weary of this place after seeing other yelp reviews, but I was quite satisfied with this restaurant.  Somehow I thought the menu lacked some things (that I like). The veggies section lacked variety.  Conclusion: Pretty good. I'd come back for dinner again to try some other things.  Quality: 8/10. Service: 8/10. Value: 7.5/10. Overall: 7.75/10 (Not an average)."}
{"text":"Came here for their 9-11am morning special on a Saturday. The place is packed so luckily some people in our party arrived early to grab a table. Seems like people only come here for their morning deals, because there was hardly anyone waiting outside when we walked out.Expect your typical Asian dim sum service when you're here. It's not your typical push cart dim sum. You order what you want, which I've grown to prefer.  Food- 3.5 stars on the food. The pork and shrimp dumplings were the highlight of the breakfast. They're good but not anything to brag about. Everything else (the pork bun, deep fried taro, shrimp dumplings) were all okay but not memorable. Didn't like their fried turnip cake. You can't beat the price, but you're not getting the best quality here  Service- 2 stars. Expect your typical Asian service. The waiters were actually a bit more attentive and removed our plates pretty quickly to clear out the table. But there's plenty of clumsiness. Didn't appreciate it when they refilled our tea pots and splashed water onto some of our food.   This is a good place if you were short on money and craved some dim sum. You're not the getting the best quality, but you can't argue against the value."}
{"text":"I've returned a few more times to Grandeur Palace to have dim sum and dinner.  Like another Yelper has mentioned, their tables are put too close together.  I am starting to wonder if this is a fire hazard.  When we were eating dinner there, it was really difficult to walk from our table to get to the washroom or anywhere in general because the tables and chairs were just pushed together too closely.  The walk space that they have designated as a \"hallway\" was -- at the time of my recent visit -- littered with service carts, bins for dirty plates, and bags of garbage.  This made it really difficult to walk through especially when you have another staff member pushing a cart through or walking in the other direction.  Someone needs to look into this and alert the appropriate people in charge if this is really a fire hazard... There's no way of getting through this restaurant quickly enough if there was really an emergency inside.  Also, they have very few vegetarian options on their dim sum menu."}
{"text":"I have been to Grandeur many times before for dim sum and I never leave disappointed because i do believe the quality of the dim sum is good (you know its good when the har gows and other steam dumpling wrap is thin and stuffed with a large amount of quality ingredients) But my expectation for this place definitely went down hill when we came in for chinese new year dinner last Saturday. Going out to eat for chinese new year is not always the best idea because it gets busy and quality of food is not always the best compared to a normal regular day... we came in with reservation for 3 tables with 30 people all together.. We opted for their set course menu and was expecting it to be quick since I assume the kitchen makes everything in bulk since everyone is ordering a set menu... boy were we wrong! We get seated at around 6:30 and we told the servers to start serving the food at 7 pm... our first dish came out at about 7:15 pm (ok fine 15 minute from our actual time is not bad..) but then the next couple of other dishes came out 1 whole HOUR after the last dish was served... The most frustrating item was that we ordered 3, 5 lb lobsters and they simply forgot about them from our set menu... HOW CAN YOU FORGET ABOUT AN ITEM FROM AN ALREADY PRE-DESIGNED MENU???? by 9 pm we were frustrated to know that our lobster wasn't even in the kitchen ready to be cooked... talking to the general managers, the servers, everyone was scattered and unsure of what is going on. One lady GM in particular was so frustrating as she kept looking at the pre-set menu on our table ... WHEN SHE KNOWS ITS THE LOBSTER WE WERE MISSING. Time keeps passing and we were finally served our lobster at 10:30 pm... Lobster was cooked rushed, it wasn't chopped properly and it was hard to eat.  By 10:45 (15 minutes from getting our lobster) we were served dessert and we officially left the restaurant by 11:05. Needless to say, it was THE MOST frustrating meal ever..especially since we see other tables getting lobster and their dishes. I knew a couple of other customers there and they were seated after us and left way before us when they had the same set meal. Very frustrating and very unprofessional. Furthermore, no additional discount was provided to us for the unnecessary waste of time. The only saving grace they have from me is that I still really enjoy their dim sum but will probably not be returning for a while since this experience has definitely spoiled my relationship with the restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here for dim sum today.  We arrived at 11.30am and weren't given a table straight away because the early bird diners were still finishing their food.  We were seated after around 15 minutes.  The hostesses were miserable and very unfriendly.  We sat down and ordered tea and hot water.  When they placed the tea pot down, there were tea stains all over the base of the spout and the sides(see pic).  Not a good start.  We ticked off our orders and then couldn't find anyone to put our order in.  This non - existent service was the tone for the whole meal.  We even cleared our own dishes twice because the table was pretty small for our party of 6 and we ordered a lot of food too.  The dim sum here is a definite 4 or maybe even 5 star,  everything that we ordered was good or really good.  Such a shame because for food alone it would be amazing.  However, it is lacking/ has no wait staff.  The few black suits were ignoring everybody and we literally had to shout to get any attention.    Dim sum is really good here and prices are decent but there's no service.  I've never had to go to a restaurant and clear my own dishes before.  We were tempted to give no tips, it was like being at a food court."}
{"text":"I decided to go to Grandeur Palace since it seems like they were renovating forever. It does look more grand than ever. It stands out for the area in Chartwell Centre.  I tried several dishes including shark fin soup (not real), roasted chicken, seafood bird nest, fried green beans, sweet and sour pork chops, tofu with broccoli, mushrooms with vegetables and many more. The portion was just average (or slightly less). I'm not sure that the price justifies the average portion and okay quality. It was not fine dining. The dishes came out pretty fast.  At the end of the dinner, they provide complementary dessert - red bean soup, cookies and almond jello.  The menu is only in Chinese and the staff can barely speak English. They do offer a VIP discount card for 10% off, if you're made aware of it. It's one of those places."}
{"text":"Located at Chartwell Shopping Centre (Huntingwood) Either I have some pretty wacked up taste, or I'm just going at a different time compared to most Yelpers cause I though Grandeur Palace tastes pretty good for dimsum. They amped up the price from the past - it is now around $3 for Small, Medium and Large dishes before 11am.  When I come to Grandeur Palace, I usually have to come at 8:55am, because there are already 30 people lining up in front of me - this is how you know this place tastes great. Once they open the door, people all rush to grab a seat and then they all come by with the teas. I would try to avoid sitting on the stage if possible - they receive the least attention and service so it might take some time to get your teas. If you sit closer to the door, we had service SUPER fast, one of the staff literally came within 3 seconds to collect our plate after we finished eating the last plate on them.  I really like all of their pancakes - sweet or salty, I think that these are one of their best dishes. The har gow is also quite tasty."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times now for dim sum, for their dinner service, and for a banquet. First off, beware of the parking lot area near the entrance of this restaurant - there always a lot of cars in the area of the parking lot I find. Secondly, if possible, try to make reservations - I generally like to make reservations so then I can minimize the wait time for a table especially during the dim sum service.   Dim sum at this place is good - the price is reasonable and food quality is good. Dinner service here is good too. I would say the dinner service, food quality for the dinner menu, and the prices are en par with the Chinese restaurants in the area. Their Chinese bbq items are a must try in my option.   However, why I gave it a three star - saying this place is only average was because of a recent banquet I attended here for a friend's wedding. I was one of her helpers for set up before cocktail hour started. They were not set up on time and they kind of messed up the floor plan, the numbering of the tables were just off and they didn't account for the table for the bar. Cocktail was to start at 6 pm and at 6:15 pm they were still setting up. The banquet food, I thought was just so so, and the portions were kind of on the small size - I wasn't really full by the end of the 10 course meal. By dessert, normally you serve the Wedding Cake with the desserts - I was not impress with the way they served the Wedding Cake. Normally (at least all the other banquets that I have been to) cut up the cake in individual slices and serve it. But here, they just hack up the cake into a huge chunk and serve it a platter with the other dessert.   Overall, I would only really come for their dim sum service and maybe their dinner service. But, I would not have a banquet here - not impress with their banquet service at all."}
{"text":"2.5  The food's about a 3 most of the time. On my last visit, we ordered a lobster e-fu noodle ($16.99?), salted egg yolk fried bitter melon and pumpkin ($7.90), and their only-in-Chinese lunch special roasted pork belly meat ($7.99).   The salted egg yolk fried bitter melon and pumpkin ended up being our favorite out of the three dishes. The portion was fairly good for the price. It could have used a lot more salted egg yolk though. If you really paid attention, you could detect notes of it, but it tasted mostly of batter, not salted egg yolk.  The lobster e-fu noodle portion was decent as well, but the lobster portion was quite lacking. Grandpa noted that there was maybe half a small lobster's worth of meat in our dish, taking into account things like how there was only one claw, etc. The sauce also didn't taste of lobster. It didn't taste like much of anything, to be completely honest.   The special roasted pork belly meat is where I'm quite frustrated. We received a plate of pork that I did not think was pork belly at all. In my understanding, roasted pork belly usually has bones. This was mostly lean meat and was boneless. I asked my grandfather if pork belly meat had bones, and he said it could, but it also didn't have to. I took him at his word. We checked the menu later again because I was still extremely skeptical that this was pork belly meat. It did say pork belly. We asked one of the managers. He told us that indeed it was pork belly, but that there is pork belly that is lean, and there is pork belly that is fatty, and that ours happened to be lean. I have NEVER seen lean pork belly before. Pork belly has layers of fat. One buys pork belly BECAUSE it has high fat content and therefore makes things juicy. I know there is pork belly where there's a big layer of fat and then lean meat, and I know of pork belly where there are alternating thinner layers of meat and fat, but I have never seen pork belly with a large layer of lean meat followed by a tiny layer of fat and then skin. This is what they called pork belly. If you don't believe me, check the pictures. Do I still feel lied to? Yes. Unless someone can explain this lean pork belly to me, I think I just got scammed."}
{"text":"I used to frequent the old Dragon Dynasty when it was still at Chartwell plaza and missed going there thus I was happy to hear that Grandeur Palace (GP) took its place.   I have to admit I've not tried the dim sum at GP (although my in laws have and have enjoyed it). Hubby and I and his family went there for Chinese New Year dinner. They had two dinner seating times: 5:30 and 7:30pm. By the latter seating time, the restaurant, although busy, had a few vacant tables.   We ordered lobster, seafood and vegetables in taro bird's nest, snow pea leaves with king mushrooms, sweet and sour pork, e-fu noodles, and fried oysters. Everything was served hot and fresh, and nothing was overtly overseasoned (the lobster was a bit salty). Of special note were the fried oysters (which didn't taste overly greasy, unlike those at another popular Chinese restaurant in Markham that serves them). I also really enjoyed the sweet and sour pork which was satisfyingly crunchy despite the sauce on it.   I had slight reservations about dining there given the lukewarm reviews on Yelp. To my surprise, the dinner service was fairly efficient and the staff serving us were courteous. More importantly the food was pretty good. I'd come back to try their food again.  2/100 (2017)"}
{"text":"I came here on a saturday morning and boy was it busy. I came here before when it first opened and it was a def 2/5 for me, so I didnt even bother to make a review for this place. However my experience this time was definitely more positive. The staff was more organize and the dishes were alot cleaner. The dimsum came out hot and fresh unlike my previous experiences. But to prevent lining up for seats you have to come before 9:00 am to line up for seats on weekends. You can get by coming at 9:00 am with seats avilable on weekdays, but don't risk it on weekends. The staff was polite and early morning dim sum is only $2.90. There are alot of variety as well."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I came here with my family for early morning dim sum, where small, medium, and large dim sums are all $3.20 when you place your order before 11am--a pretty awesome deal!!   They don't take reservations during dim sum hours so you'll have to come early in order to wait for a table. It is worth the wait as the quality and flavour of the dim sum is comparable to other dim sum places. Also, it is made fresh to order so the dim sum is served hot--love that!! Especially their durian pastry, the flavour of durian was deep and the pastry was super flaky and soft; I have been to dim sum places where the durian pastry tastes way too oily but this one is just perfect--a must order!  Service wise, I would say it is average, we did have a stack of empty plates going that took a while before it was cleared off our table but aside from that, we got refills for our tea pots throughout our meal without too much hassle.   Highly recommend this location!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for dim sum when it first opened, and we were so unsatisfied with the food and their service. But we figured that every place deserves a second chance before giving them a really bad review. We came here last night to give them a second chance. When we got here, it was quite busy, a lot of ppl trying to avoid the Mother's Day weekend next week by having it early. We noticed that a lot of tables were full but didn't have any food on them. We ordered our food and when it came, seeing the quality of the food and after trying it again, this place definitely deserves a very bad review. First off, this is supposed to be a higher class restaurant with the way they did the decor and the high pricing. The food was so mediocre, even the steak cutlets came with fries. You can just tell how much msg was used just by how thirsty you got. The lettuce duck came with no lettuce even after we specifically ordered it and the duck filling even had pieces of bones in it. Every piece of pork chop was just fat. We ended up not finishing any of the dishes and took it to go instead. I would not come back to this place nor would I recommend it to anyone. I would rather go to McDonalds than to come back here, and I don't like McDonalds. That should tell you a lot."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5 Ambiance: 3.5/5  Services: 3.5/5  We came by for a quick dim sum fix on Saturday morning - gonna thank our lucky star since we got there around 9:40AM (just in time for the special early bird deal!) and this place is usually pretty packed. We waited in line for about 10 minutes before we were seated.   Like any typical dim sum places, Grandeur Palace had a vibrant vibe. Some might complain that it's too noisy but that's what makes it fun to eat here! We ordered a round of dim sum dishes including steamed rice noodle rolls, congee, crunchy shrimp balls, clay pot rice (pork ribs & chicken feet), steamed buns with almond fillings and deep fried durian. The food was served promptly after the orders were placed. Our favourite dish was the crunchy shrimp balls - usually these are deep fried and are often served in a greasy mess. The chef opted to use almond pieces to give the shrimp balls a crispier texture. The beef tenderloin and black fungus rice rolls were freshly made and the fillings were very generous. Overall, the food was decent given the price."}
{"text":"Came here with my family to try this new restaurant out. They have some decent specials and we ordered a variety of dishes. Nothing really outstanding, it's on par with other Chinese restaurants in the area.   However, the service was ridiculously slow and the waiters seemed impatient when we waved them down for service. The waiters kept forgetting our orders and we had to wave different servers down. The waiters seemed like they were having a rough day. The restaurant is understaffed and I hope they can improve on this."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I have not been back to Chartwell mall in ages but was excited to try this dim sum restaurant. There was plenty of room on a Sat at around noon time. In terms of food, each dim sum was not bad. We ordered he chicken feet, custard bun, chicken feet and spare rib pot rice, pumpkin congee, honey ribs and siu mai. I have to admit each dish was quite good. Nothing spectacular but delicious. Before 11am, each s/m/l dish is $2.99. The best part was the service of all the staff members. I keep coming back to the fact that you \"eat\" service. The managers were very caring and each made small talk as they passed by. They happily gave suggestions on food and brought us boxes for leftovers before we even asked. The bus-ladies (??) were also very eager to get anything we needed.  I just wish this place was closer to where I lived. I would come here with my family all the time."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum with my parents on a Saturday afternoon (not during their early bird special).  This restaurant is in a strip mall that has a few restaurants nearby along with two supermarkets.  I often frequent it to get fill-in items that I can't get if I wasted my time in a T&T parking lot...  The decor inside is pretty nice, everything is very new -- it doesn't seem like they kept the old decor from the previous iteration of this restaurant.  The dim sum seems to be pretty good, service is still sort of hit or miss because they seemed a bit understaffed outside in the dining area (not really the case inside the kitchens -- you can see how many people are working on your way to the bathroom).  Dim sum here is priced a bit higher for regular tea hours ($2.90, $3.90, $4.90, etc. versus the early bird price of $2.90 for S/M/L before 11am), so it's a bit more expensive than other places nearby.  What was interesting was one of the managers from Diamond Banquet Hall (now defunct) works here and managed to give us a 10% discount since she recognized my dad.  The food is actually pretty good.  No complaints from the dishes we got.  We noticed that a lot of people ordered the lobster E-fu noodles, but we weren't sure how much it was since none of their menus listed it.  It's probably something I'll try the next time I'm there."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday around 1PM for dim sum. There was not a line. Got a seat in 5 minutes but the place was still busy. This restaurant got a new name and renovation. I think it is for the better. The environment is nice and with a Venetian decor. The tables are spacious and have plenty of room to walk around. Now to the food review! The dim sum ain't bad. There are some good value items on the dim sum sheet. For example, the duck Lai fan noodles was $7.90 and can feed a minimum of 4 people. The small dim sums start at $2.90 and range from spare ribs, beef balls to BBQ pork buns. I definitely recommend this place to eat dim sum! Early bird is before 11PM so make sure to get there early for some cheap eats."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. It's not as oily as most of the dim sum places around the area. My favourite dim sum is probably the layered cake, which reminds me of the ones I used to have as a kid. The BBQ pork stand attached to the restaurant has some tasty food too, great for take it after dim sum.   Parking can be a little difficult but if you're willing to wait a little bit it is not too bad."}
{"text":"Came here recently for some early morning dim sum. From 9am-11am, all the S,M,L dishes are for the price of $2.90 (the usual S dish price). The tea price per person is $1. Just make sure you get here early because there was a large crowd waiting already at 10am.   We had the shrimp dumplings, beef spheres, dragon pearl, veggie noodle wrap, eel puffs, layered cake, deep fried durian rolls, runny custard buns, and peanut wraps. For savory, I would recommend the dragon pearl, which is a sizable ball of shrimp rolled in slivered almonds and fried of a golden brown. The eel puffs were dry and pale, too much pastry compared to the amount of eel. Skip the eel for the BBQ puffs next time. The rest were passable, but I found the shrimp dumplings had a very thick wrapper - the thickness you usually find on a chiu chow dumpling and not on the shrimp dumpling (yes, I'm picky but shrimp dumplings are a fundamental test for all dim sum places). For dessert, the deep fried durian rolls were good. The pastry is thin and light, while the creamy durian centers pack a punch of durian flavor. The runny custard buns were not runny enough inside and the bun itself was lacking texture. So switch that for something else next time.  Overall an okay dim sum place. Some hits but just about the same amount of misses."}
{"text":"First time having dimsum here and we will be back. Made reservations for a Sunday for a group of 8 and was seated right away. Dishes came out quickly and service pretty good. Most of the dishes were good with a couple of standout dishes including the roast pork (super crispy skin), durian pastry (for durian fans), curry octopus, and shrimp and chives steamed and pan fried dumplings. Go before 11am and everything is $2.99."}
{"text":"I'm saying bye bye, sayonara, and zai jian to this dim sum spot.   Why?  Terrible and ridiculous staff!  Like many dated asian restaurants, customer service is non-existent so I'm not even rating them based on that. What three things over the top for me was their outrageous behavior. When we asked for the bill, there was a mistake made so they took it back to fix, while leaving the check tray. They brought the fixed bill with a second tray. We paid, left a tip, and sat around to chat.  A waiter collected the second tray and tip. Upon leaving, the waitress took the first check tray (which was empty) and demanded a tip. We said we did tip, she screamed something at another waiter who then quickly proceeded to try to stop us from leaving, accusing of not tipping. A supervisor stepped in as well to falsely accuse us and yell at us.   First of all, tipping is customary but not demanded. Secondly, we paid and tipped. You can't stop a customer if they didn't tip, you definitely cannot accuse them of it and treat them as if they're doing a hit and run.   Bye, Grandeur Palace. Grandeur jerks."}
{"text":"Just thought we'd try this place out but it was nothing special. It was so mediocre that I don't have anything terrible or good to say except this place is over priced for the quality of their food just because the decor is on the higher end of the scale. Service is also mediocre but have to admit their uniforms are a lot better then most restaurants I've been to. And that's when you know there's honestly nothing special if the only compliment I have is about their uniforms... LOL. Am I writing a troll review? I really don't know! If you feel like spending more money then you LIKE on mediocre food, try it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time over the weekend with the family based on recommendation from a family friend.  Before reading into the details below, here's my summary of the 2 star rating.  1/5 - service 3/5 - food 3/5 - atmosphere 3/5 - cost  Had a 7pm reservation and gotten seated 15 mins later.  Staff was not fast and made no eye contact to ask what tea we wanted.  After another 10 mins, a staff came by to set the table and took tea order but never brought it.  We eventually asked for the pot of tea which they brought 30 mins in ... except both pots were hot water (typically 1 pot of tea and 1 pot of hot water is brought to table).  Tried to flag down a wait staff to get a pot of tea.  By now, it is 45 mins in and we can finally order.  Service  For chinese and first timers, the staff do not pay much attention which is a bit off putting.  They are extremely friendly if you are a regular or family which it looked to be 85% the case when we went on the weekend.  Also, staff do not pay much attention when walking around as I probably got hit in the back of the chair several times in an hour as I sat on an open corner of the table near the walk ways.  Food  steamed fish - 4/5 pork chops in plum sauce -1/5 e-foo noodles with mushrooms - 3/5 beef with broccoli - 3.5/5 fried oysters in pepper sauce - 4/5  If you are adventurous, order the same but otherwise stick to anything 3.5 and above so you are not surprised by the creative sauces.  Also, first time seeing and having fried potato cubes in beef and broccoli.. spin on beef and potatoes?  Maybe  Atmosphere  Generally clean except for the hallway under the arches parked with a line of trays and carts with dirty dishes  Cost The food does taste quite fresh but for only 1 to 2 plates out of 5 that were decent, it is not worth the $20 per dish avg price tag"}
{"text":"I've been here with family a few times in the past couple of months. It seems to be busy here all the time, especially on weekends around lunch time so just a heads up about that - come early, don't come hangry!  In terms of food, it's better than many Chinese restaurants on the West end of the GTA, though not the best Chinese food out there. Some of their food is hit or miss - I guess it depends on who is making it that day?  Personal likes: turnip cake during dimsum, king mushroom with greens, fish stomach with crab soup, duck  Could be better: sweet and sour chicken, pork and veg fried rice, sauteed beef with snow peas  The prices here are okay, considering the portion sizes, taste and overall decor of the place.   Service is also okay, though I have to admit that I don't expect much at Asian restaurants. They were efficient enough with taking orders and bringing the food but not overly polite, which is typical. We'll probably be back though out of convenience."}
{"text":"My review is based on dinner, vs. all the dim sum reviews I see here. I came here without a reservation on a Saturday night and it was quite packed. However, since we were the earlier dinner crowd, we were able to get a seat quickly.  I liked the decor when I walked in, and the staff seemed to be hustling and busy. We ordered a la carte vs. a set menu, which consisted of lobster with ginger and onion, half a chicken, birds nest with seafood, snow pea leaves with garlic, steamed oysters and peking duck. I would say the food was okay, and service was average as well. Nothing special. But I do feel that I have had better. We had the lettuce wraps with the remainder of our duck but I felt like they scammed us out of a lot more meat on the duck. The food was decent and service was efficient but I'm not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is one of the dim sum places in Scarborough that are on a more pricey side. However, I don't feel like the dishes tasted any better to justify the higher price. There is nothing too special or worth noting about this restaurant. The food is ok. The service is ok. I will continue my hunt for my favourite dim sum place!  Recommend going to restaurant early, because all dishes regardless of size, will cost $3.20."}
{"text":"This place was a major disappointment, if I could give a half star I would. They changed the chef recently and the taste went downhill since June. We paid for food for the price and quality of an expensive fine dining place and received the quality of food worse than a food court. The food was bitter due to being over cooked and the poor kids wouldn't even touch the food because it was that bad. The dessert was even worse, they didn't have enough and added water to it, it was absolutely disgusting! Worse experience ever, not worth the time or money. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Best dim sum in town!  So true Cantonese food! Return so many times for lunch and dinner"}
{"text":"This place just opened about a week ago, clearly it isn't ready. Kitchen is very unorganized, half of our dim sum came out cold, and couple dishes were missing after almost an hour, a lot of other tables were missing part of their order, wait staff are indifferent and inexperienced. Better off going somewhere else. Came back to try their dinner, it is just as bad, clearly they haven't got their act together, stay away."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum.  Food was okay.  It was early but also it was a holiday so had to pay regular price which could increase your bill double from what you expected.  They take credit cards so when it came time to pay the bill I used a prepaid Mastercard gift card.  Waitress is like what is this, I said prepaid Mastercard.  She's like oh we don't take those.  I'm like yes...you do take them.  She's like no we don't take those.  I'm like if you take Mastercard then you take their prepaid cards, let me show you.  Took the machine and operated it myself.  Payment went through fine.  If people don't know its okay to say you don't know, don't just make up some BS."}
{"text":"- Waiter spilled half the soup on the table serving us  - Preorder a wintermelon soup which they don't have at the time of dinner  - Peking duck was small, even smaller after it went through the kitchen  - Served corn and fish fillet  I don't eat that much but I still felt I could eat more at the end. Its not like the taste is bad but the cost for the meal seems to be way off."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food served banquet style.. Lots of traditional dishes such as assorted birds dish and sweet and sour pork and fried lobster, but some... Interesting plates as well..  Such as sweet beef with fries as well as garlic fried beef cubes surround with broccoli on top of...  Potatoes? Definitely the first time I've tried that."}
{"text":"Neutral: 1. Dim sum is pretty standard.  Nothing really sticks out.  Bad: 1. Gets crowded for early bird special so be prepared to wait.  Worth it? Probably just because of the early bird special but not if you're paying regular price."}
{"text":"Grandeur Palace's Grand Opening Special is quite a good deal. I might have give them a lower rating but what they offers is just value for money!  Palace Crystal Chicken (1/2 for $8.30) really exceed my expectation. Even the white meat was so tender! I like how they served heated. But if I have to pay over $16 for that? I am just not sure.  Sweet and Sour Pork ($12.98) with fresh fruit has lychee in it! I love lychee. However I found the batter was not crispy enough for my liking.   Steamed Scallop with Luffa and Garlic Sauce ($14.95) was a disappointment! Presentation was lacking and looked nothing close to the photos in the menu!!  Service was ok. Some of the wait staff is really helpful and nice but most of them really not trained for \"higher\" end restaurants at this price point.  Maybe I will be back? I will see!"}
{"text":"This restaurant replaces old-time Dragon Dynasty Chinese Restaurant.  If you're going to take one thing away from this review...it's that the service is really slow and frustrating. Be prepared to constantly remind the waiters of your existence. The management really needs an overhaul because this kind of service is one of the worst I've ever experienced for a Chinese restaurant in Toronto. I am usually a very patient and reasonable person, but it should not take over 15 minutes to bring dessert out when two managers acknowledged that we finished the meal and that it was dessert time. The place was not even half full. I do not it was the chef's fault at all for this slowness but rather it was the waiters who were struggling to keep up with the customers' demands.  The saving grace of this place is that the food is actually above average and the prices are reasonable.  They are doing a Grand Opening special and you can choose a dish for half the original price out of 6 choices per table. We got the steamed sea bass special (1-1.5lb) for around $17 which was pretty sweet deal. We also ordered a dish with choy and mushrooms which was well-made. No complaints about the Chinese-styled diced beef dish and lotus root with pork belly in hot pot either.   Would I go back again? Not if the service doesn't improve."}
