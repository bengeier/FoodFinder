{"text":"I really wish I could give five stars to this place but in all honesty I can't. The ribs were tough, collard greens were blaned beans and rice had crunchy beans. The saving grace was that the mac & cheese was good! Also the corn bread was pretty good too! I also ordered a pulled pork sandwich which was good but nothing to write home about. In all fairness they usually only serve ribs on the weekends so hopefully this was just a bad batch. I would love nothing more than a true barbecue joint in Cuyahoga Falls. I am really hoping they can rise to that occasion! It is still a place definitely worth checking out though. Happy eats my friends!"}
{"text":"We were in town to visit family recently and noticed this place was new since our last trip. When the question came up of where to get dinner we kicked around the idea of barbecue and decided on Big Eu'es rather than a local chain. Turned out to be a good choice! We had the full slab of ribs, a pound of brisket, baked beans, cole slaw, wings and collard greens and were happy with all of our choices. Even some of us that don't typically love greens enjoyed them. The wings were crisp and piping hot and we liked them with the hot BBQ sauce - just hot enough, not scorching if you're a person who craves heat. The brisket was super smoky and delicious. I would 100% go back to this friendly place! Would love to be able to eat in at some point if they choose to offer the option. Right now it is carry-out only."}
{"text":"Must have been an off night. Counter girl who took my order was not friendly at all but that was just the beginning. Ordered two chicken breasts dinner and for a BBQ place, figured I would get bone in fresh chicken....these breasts seemed frozen and processed. Terrible taste. Definitely not smoked or grilled. Also bought a full Slab of ribs which were just OK. Wanted sauce on side and of course they came covered in it. Sauce was tasty but the ribs were rubbery and again, didn't seem smoked or cooked well. Sorry, won't be back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best ribs and mac and cheese I've ever had. Dank BBQ sauce that's not too sweet. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Just had ribs, wings ,fries and a Coke for 10$, dry rub=amazing,hot BBQ=the best I've had in a long ass while, it's great to have legit BBQ in the falls, even the damn fries were delicious!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food for a fantastic price! Went here for my lunch break and I was truly amazed how much food you can get for a low price! Big Eu'es gained a customer for life!"}
{"text":"Great food!  I love the pie and there unique BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Good BBQ options in the area have lacked for some time.  Big Eu'es is a welcome addition and is really, really good.  Been in for a few visits.  Pulled Pork Sandwich is piled high and the sauce was good and tangy.  Green beens were fresh and still have some texture which is a welcome departure from other places in the area, fries are good too.  Ribs were great too.  Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Staff was friendly and helpful when ordering. We got the rib dinner, pulled pork, mac n' cheese, and collard greens. I could believe how much I liked the greens. 

I hope the eventually get some dine in options. They have the space."}
{"text":"Great portions, food prepared fresh to each order. Service is always excellent and the food is very very good."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ!!! Huge portions making the price more than reasonable. Highly recommend the food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I eat here often. I absolutely love the lemon pepper wings, not a huge wing eater, and their fries are amazing. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for some good, fresh BBQ."}
{"text":"The people related to Big Eu'es are blessed. I know they're eating good at birthdays, graduations, weddings, in the delivery room, etc. Such a great place to order that \"home cooked\" bbq meal. I ordered pulled pork dinner. It came with a roll, 2 sides (mac and baked beans), and a drink (water) for under $11. The mac and cheese is totally home made and I was shocked the baked beans aren't from a can. Everything is seasoned and delicious. 

The thing I love about Big Eu'es is you can tell it's a family business, and family is important to them. I'm sure opening the restaurant was a family dream and at some point someone took the plunge and made it happen. You kinda get that vibe when you look around and read the menu. While we waited for our order we talked with the guy behind the counter. What a nice guy! He confirmed that Big Eu'es is a real person..his father actually. 

I'm sad I judged the this place by the outside and it took me so long to give it a try. Big Eu'es is my new fav place in the Falls. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have never given a 1 star review but I must have hit this place on an off night because my first and last visit fell far short of the 5 star reviews. No ribs during the week so I got the pulled pork dinner. The pulled pork had little flavor and although the BBQ sauce was just okay there was not enough to wet all the pork. Mac and cheese tasted like frozen Stouffers, the green beans were the best part of the meal and the black beans and rice were bland and crunchy. My husband and I didn't eat half of the dinner and tossed out the rest.   The place was very clean and the staff more than friendly."}
{"text":"May have just gotten the wrong thing (brisket), but it was just ok. A little dry..the BBQ sauce did help and was amazing. I got the greens which were also fantastic. 

I'd be willing to give it another try and get something different. I just want the meat to be the \"star of the show\" esp. at a bbq place and with this visit, it was definitely not. 

The place was very clean with reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Worth a try. Very good grilled chicken sandwich with toppings. Mac and cheese the old fashioned way. Rice and peas very good. Others in my party very happy with what they tried. Only suggestion is cook the green beans longer with more flavoring."}
{"text":"You can't find a better home cooked BBQ with these prices. Staff was on point and totally cool. I purchased a half stack ribs and Mac and cheese. Unbelievably good!"}
{"text":"delicious bbq sauce ! quick and super cheap for amount and quality of food ! it is actually like dads bbq, traditional and perfect"}
{"text":"The ribs are very tough and hard to tear apart as they don't cut up slabs into individual bones. Rub and BBQ sauce were good. Will try chicken or turkey next time."}
{"text":"So much value yet so good! The bang you get for your buck is just unreal. Nice, friendly staff. Clean place. A new hidden gem to the area. Such a treat!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ!!! Cuyahoga Falls needed a good BBQ joint and this is it. Amazing Mac n Cheese and green beans. I had the pulled pork and it was moist and delicious. They just opened on the 1st of this month and their success is only going to grow. Must go to on the weekends for a big smoker on the back. Carry out only!!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in NE Ohio! The brisket is smokey and very flavorful. I highly recommend the lemon pepper dry rub wings because they are freshly prepared and not greasy. Their fries have impeccable seasoning. The prices are reasonable, and it is an excellent value overall."}
{"text":"Pre Lent 2018 Friday Fish Menu Review

Three options on the Friday special menu: Cod, shrimp, or perch. Both our meals came on foil sheets and we were able to place the meals (minus lemon wedge and condiments) in our air fryer to reheat when we got the 8 miles home. Seafood was hot and juicy, fries crisped up and hush puppies were crunchy outside and creamy inside.

Tried to order just the perch so we could try all three, but it is full meal or nothing.

Cole Slaw was nice, but the tiny cups were half full. If you are a slaw fan try to get an additional side or be ready with your own.

The Super Bowl specials are already announced and all require 24 hours notice with pick up available the day of the game."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing. I cannot believe I waited this long to try it out. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with straws and cheese and it was delicious and HUGE! for $5 with a side, this is the best deal in town."}
{"text":"Was looking for a solid BBQ spot near my new apartment. Landed on this spot based on good reviews and called ahead with my order. Took me about 15 minutes to drive there and food was ready upon arrival. Got the 11$ half rack rib special and side of macaroni and flavors were on point. The ribs were super tender and well sauced. The sauce reminded me of a Carolina style BBQ sauce, mustard or vinegar based-but best I have had in a while. This is a carry out joint but seating was available and the cashier(or possibly the owner?) welcomed me to eat at a table. Staff was nice, place was clean ."}
{"text":"The mac and cheese, cornbread, pulled pork, and fries are all solid options. They recently introduced brisket to the menu, available on Friday and Saturday (like the ribs). The only thing I wish they would do is fry their fries longer or in hotter oil. They come out somewhat soggy. But the biggest standout is the flavor of the pulled pork. It doesn't even need sauce, the flavor is all there! Although they do have a killer BBQ sauce"}
{"text":"You can smell how amazing this place is from your car. I am so, so glad I actually went in after months of driving passed this fine establishment. 

Carry out only, but there is a spacious wait area to sit in while you wait for your order (you can also call ahead!). 

The whole staff is super friendly and you can really get the \"family\" vibe. They like to crack jokes and just make you feel really welcomed. 

I ordered the pulled pork dinner (comes with two sides and a drink). The bbq sauce is out of this world and will make you wish you wore yoga pants so you could just eat the entire thing. The Mac & Cheese is the bomb.com and I lowkey wished I would've ordered 20 sides. 

Seriously, give this place a go! It's amazing."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it, I really did. I bought 2 slabs of ribs, a pulled pork sandwich, mild wings and macaroni and cheese. The ribs were fairly smoky but they were tough. I didn't want $42 of ribs to go to waste so I wrapped them in foil and baked them in a low oven for about an hour. After that they were very tender. The macaroni and cheese was pretty dry. We won't be back. It's so hard to find decent BBQ around here. The wings were very good. Very nice flavor and not over cooked."}
{"text":"I finally tried the food here & it was awesome. I got the pulled pork, mac & cheese & collard greens. That was one of the best meals I have gotten in a long time from a local restaurant. The price was reasonable & the portions were big. My only regret was that I didn't order more barbecue sauce on the side. It was so good I wanted more. Give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I can't say anything more than this place is amazing! Wish I knew about it sooner! 
My fiancé had the pulled pork and loved it and I had the roasted turkey dinner  Mac n' cheese , collard greens, and wings !! It was all amazing!"}
{"text":"I always try new BBQ joints I run into.  Traveling a lot I have visited many.  The area needs a good BBQ joint and I was hoping Big Eu'es would be it.  Sorry to say it fell far short.  Ribs, while well smoked, were undercooked and tough.  So much so that no one in my family wanted the last one.  We usually fight over them.  The chicken was roasted, no smoke at all.  Bummer.  The wings were nothing special either.  Really need to start smoking those Mr. Big.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly, the food was killer. I got pulled pork sliders and mac n cheese. If you havent tried big eu's yet and want great bbq. Go. GO NOW."}
{"text":"Great Ribs. Nice and tender. Only one sauce but it was nicely balanced.  Mac n cheese was homestyle delish!"}
{"text":"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!  This is a fantastic carry out only place.  The prices are economical, and the food is good.  I have had the grilled chicken sandwich several times as well as their wings.  The sauce is sweet so order it on the side.  We have been back numerous times!  The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"There are not a lot of choices for BBQ in this area, so I don't expect much when I see a new place pop up. Thankfully, I was impressed with EU's. I discovered this place by smelling the food while driving by. I showed up for lunch and got a pulled pork sandwich with collard greens. The greens were flavorful and well cooked, maybe a little too much liquid in the cup but I didn't even care. The sandwich was so good I felt it in my soul. The roll was crispy and not too large. The portion of pork was generous but not falling all over the place. The sauce was mild but absolutely delicious. Some of the best BBQ I have ever had. I have found my new lunch spot"}
{"text":"I judge bbq joints by their beans. An authentic bbq place will have beans that melt in your mouth. You MUST try the beans here, they are perfection! Sweet and delicious with lots of bacon. And the ribs... holy cow they're nothing short of heavenly. Smokey with a tangy sauce, food is meant to Tate like this! Absolutely fantastic food at affordable prices. I'd give it 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Wow they give you a lot of meat! The BBQ sauce is pretty good, and so is the Mac n cheese. I love that the meal includes a drink too. I wish the corn bread was more of a bread and less of a crumble (had to eat with a fork) but it still tasted good. Great bbq bang for your buck! Will return for sure :)"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of good barbeque and have always thought this area is lacking a place to acquire that. So I had been looking forward to the opening of Big Eu's BBQ for a little while now and made sure to put their grand opening in my calendar so I would not forget to visit. 

On my first visit I ordered a sampling of many of their menu items to get a good understanding of what they offer.

On Fridays and Saturdays they smoke ribs and chicken quarters outside and they were both fantastic. The chicken was perfectly cooked and both had a deliciously smoky flavor. The ribs were not fall-off-the-bone tender but the flavor made them very enjoyable.

Their every-day menu consists of pulled pork, pulled turkey, chicken breasts and wings.
I ordered half a dozen of their wings and was pleasantly surprised at how fantastic they were. The sauce was delicious and they were meaty and juicy.

The pulled pork sandwich was disappointing compared to everything else. I did not think it had the flavor or quality that the rest of the items I tried had. All of the sides were decent and the homemade bbq sauce was really good.

I would definitely recommend visiting but you may wish to wait for the weekend to get the most delicious options."}
{"text":"I tried Big Eu'es after seeing a ton of positive comments on a Facebook Group. I decided to try it for myself. Let me tell you, this is the best barbecue I have ever had. I have tried all the wing flavors except the hot ones. They are all amazing. We have found we like the BBQ & mild the best. I tried the Mac and cheese, which I renamed crack & cheese because I'm addicted to it. The ribs fall off the bones and the sauce they make is good enough to drink. Trust me when I tell you there is never any sauce left on my plate. We tried all flavors of the KoolAid pie. Yum! I haven't had anything yet that I didn't love! The prices are very fair & the people are wonderful. They make you feel as though you're a close friend when you visit. Give them a try and you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ around, actually best food around town. Eu knows how to cook the most delicious tasting foods. This is by far my favorite restaurant"}
{"text":"You get a lot of food for very cheap! Fast and friendly service. And the BBQ sauce is amazing."}
{"text":"First time to try ,saw good reviews previously, much to my dismay very disappointing, ordered 1/2 slab ribs, very tough, still very pink close to the bone ,like they were not cooked long enough, had to use a steak knife to scrape what little meat there was off the bones. Not very much meat on the bones, lucky if there was 3-4 ounces all together, pretty skimpy for a 1/2 slab. Tried the baked beans, sauce was flavorful a little spicy hot but good, beans were a little on the crunchie side, like they were undercooked also. Will think before trying them again."}
{"text":"WOW!!!   I am ashamed to say that I never knew this amazing BBQ joint existed until about a week ago.  I finally stopped today to check it out.   Very clean, super friendly staff & owners- when I mentioned that it was my first time there, the woman stated that her husband was the owner & called him over so I could meet him.   I ordered the pulled pork dinner...  the aroma was so intoxicating that even though I only live 5 minutes away, I almost had to pull over & try a bite !
I had no idea what a generous portion this was until I got home! I have enough for at least one possibly two more meals! The pork is fabulous, the mac & cheese is especially  tasty and I am a mac & cheese snob!! Coleslaw is fabulous -not too much dressing just the right amount.
My only wish is that I could find true southern cornbread like my Kentucky grandma used to make... this is more of a cake line consistency, but that is pretty typically up north.  I think it's because that is what people are used to around here. 
If you have not tried this place out-what are you waiting for?!?!?!"}
{"text":"Drove past this place and turned around to give it a try as there are not very many bbq joints in the falls. Right away I noticed the picture in the front window of a guy saying \"Gimmy a soda\" so I figured I'd ask what that was about. Long story short, the picture is of the owner's father and the owner (Eugene) uses the recipes handed down to him from the man pictured. I like a place with a story like that.

I got a full slab of ribs which are only served on the weekends. The flavor was right on and the bbq sauce was delicious. The sauce has a sweet, almost mustardy flavor to it which I dig. The ribs were $21 for a full slab which is about par for the course when you're getting a quality, slow-smoked product. Like most places, they finish the ribs on the grill right before they serve them. 

Overall, I definitely liked the food and the staff were all very friendly. Stop in and check the place out and be sure to talk to Eugene!"}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich is great! The pork was moist and flavorful. The crispy onions were a nice textural counter point to the soft bun and tender pork."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing and the prices are great. The owner is a super friendly guy who is more than willing to help you with any questions. This is exactly how a family business should be!"}
{"text":"We love this place! The staff is always friendly and helpful.  
The ribs we tried were just ok (a little too charred and dry for our liking, but it could have been an off day), but everything else has been amazing. 
The pulled pork sandwich is my favorite. It's so large that I get two meals out of it! 
Fries are fresh cut and delish! But the star sides are the mac and cheese and the collard greens. They are sooooo good. I actually crave the greens.
The wings are fantastic,  too! 
But let's talk about the bbq sauce. Order an extra side, maybe two. It's perfect.  I could drink it. (Yeah, I'm a fat girl ) 
And don't forget dessert!  They freaking have Kool-aid pie! Even if you don't know what it is, just trust me and order a slice!
They run specials that are a great deal, too. Keep an eye on their FB page for info."}
{"text":"Just went there for my first time .. I got the pulled pork sandwich with mac & cheese and coleslaw and cornbread everything was amazing . Usually I am very picky about bbq places .. this place actually shocked me of how good it was. !! It's also very inexpensive I got all of that for only like 8$ can't beat that!!! Deff new fav spot."}
{"text":"Omg so glad that Big Eu'esBBQ  picked cuyahoga falls  to open their new business. The pulled pork is absolutely delicious the bbq is so tasty and you need more they will accommodate,  and the homemade Mac n cheese is to die for. I have told everyone I know about this gem  several guys said it's the best ribs they have had. They have a Facebook page and run contests to win gift certificate and also listened to customers and now offer coleslaw. The owner and staff are super friendly. Bonus is they are part of the Belly program so enter your email and earn free food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite things about Cuyahoga Falls is driving down Portage Trail with the windows down and smelling Big Eu'es smoker cooking out in front of their BBQ joint. It always makes me want to stop in for a bite of pulled pork or brisket! If you're looking for a great BBQ lunch or dinner, definitely try this place out! FYI - it's take out only."}
