{"text":"The Bánh cuon  and chicken pho are my go-to staples here. The Bánh cuon is fresh and the portion is good but could use a little more filling however. The chicken pho broth is clean and not-oily unlike some other places. Sometimes, however, when ordering the pho, they cut the chicken pieces a little too think, and these pieces are also very dry. On a more positive note, there are no weird chicken pieces, they are all breast/white meat. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"I love this place, one of my favorites in the West end. I like that their noodles a little wider and fresh. They are pretty quick, and the broth is consistent. For those of you who enjoy their soup on the spicier side, they have a couple chilli oil jars kicking around. which is a big bonus for me, seeing as i bring my own sometimes to pho places that don't have them. i'm pretty much a regular there."}
{"text":"Pho Linh's strength is its consistently great broth! It's fragrant, hearty and flavorful yet it's not oily. Try the house special, very yummy.

I've been to both locations at College and the one at Steeles, both places are yummy"}
{"text":"I had my first great banh cuon experience at Pho Linh and ever since I can remember, I've only ordered banh cuon take out from here. They make it real good serving up big portions where they generously give larger fillings of minced pork and mushroom into each roll. This dish is very satisfying as it is cheap so it'll give you a run for your money! They also have a variety of genuine Vietnamese drinks that should be tried since you might not find them at any other Vietnamese restaurants such as che ba mau, suong sao etc. since the make time is a bit tedious. Spring rolls are also a must get appetizer as they are made crunchy with a delicious meat filling. My mouth is watering just talking about it."}
{"text":"Around the world reviewing Pho. 

Mmmmm basic pho. 

This is one of the better reviewed and favorite spots in the city. It doesn't even compare to the best pho I've tried worldwide Tien Tanh, but their broth does have a unique, worth trying quality to it.

Their specialty I would say is things other than their pho, like special soups of the day and other things you won't see on most menus."}
{"text":"Craving Vietnamese on a budget? This is the place, and so fresh! I ate here twice in two days while staying in Toronto. if you're not big on red meat try the cold vermicelli with lemongrass chicken- it filled me up, healthy, and a cool meal for a hot day."}
{"text":"Fried Spring Roll is amazing, a must have. Vermicelli noddles with BBQ pork and spring rolls is my all time favorite, especially in summer. With around 10 tables in total, this place is busy at lunch time. The service is really quick, that is a plus."}
{"text":"The best Pho in the city? Not a certainty. The best pho in downtown east? A definite certainty! Don't bother with the useless hipster joints on ossington, this is it. Always get raw beef and always get it on the side."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Vietnamese restaurants. I like their specials (spicy soup on the weekend, and stew soup on weekdays). They have good rice dishes and they make their banh cuon on location."}
{"text":"Love coming here! Always busy but not a long wait to get a table. Service is fast and friendly. 

Broth is deep and flavourful and noodles are always perfect. The rice roll  plates are perfectly portioned and everything is always fresh. Solid place!"}
{"text":"Pho what?!  Pho me @ Pho Linh biaaaatchaaaaaa.

Forget meet me at Montauk ... meet me @ Pho Linh!

Got here at 3, 2 real viet families having late lunch, old biz, familiar, genuine warmth, kids playing around, this is the real deal, generations of their own ppl come here, off peak, avoiding the crazed hordes.

We woke up late.  OK, my old pho place, closed, rather sold, used to chill teacups.  They do it here.  And the tea tastes of tea.  It's not coloured water, as served in many not so fine establishments.

Got special pho, small, banh cuon, dry vermi with grilled pork sp roll, and mango shake.

Pho soup, clean, not super tastey as in msg-ey, relying on ingredients.  Beef, tripe, brisket, tendon, all better than avg, fresh.  Noodles, not from dry, I think, may be fresh daily from local shop.  Basil, not a spot of black, sprouts, all super fresh, chili, not the new super hot gmo variety sold at tnt, just enough heat.

Mango shake, niiiiice, not too sweet, brought to you in takeout cup b/c many/some won't finish drink there.  Happens to me every time.  Considerate.  Look, we go for sufficient, for pleasure, not gluttony, not fullness.  And that shake is wonderful and even better when sipped slowly as you walk off the meal.

Banh cuon, #12, small, a fine find, simple, delectable, light, cha lua is lighter than that sold in market too.  Good recomm by many here.

Last, the dry vermi, sooo rounded, so packed in flavours, variety in textures, delights.  I like sp roll here quite a bit.

SERVICE

Look, when you go during peak, it's what it is, which is prob still faster than most western places, that pho, you order, turn back around, and it's there.

Friendly service?  You bet!  Been to Viet, only a week mind you, but we felt the same here, that Buddhist ideo in core of being.  What do you want?  Banter?  You want them to ref your life, your media, make you feel at home in your monoculture?  They serve quietly with grace, speak only when needed, not wishing to disturb.  Adjust yourself culturally, try to fit into this little oasis.

Family-owned, family-operated, not as gaudy as the paunchy owner of Golden Turtle.  The son here, great looking kid, humble, fit as hell, seems happy enough to help out, good parents, good prospects for Pho Linh to last, with continued quality, in the generation to come.

Yeah, agreed, best pho place, dtwn TO.  And yes the pho is better in Vietnam.  I don't know what it is, great anywhere I had it, even at little streetside stalls.  And service in Viet, even sweeter.

Remember, cash is king, and he's a sovereign, none other accepted."}
{"text":"I asked one of my Vietnamese coworkers which is her favorite Pho joint. After searching google maps for a good 20min we finally found her favorite place. \"I'll check it out!\", i told her.

Apparently the place has been running for awhile, and is a favorite of local Vietnamese.

The pho however has the fat \"fresh\" noodles which I'm not a fan of, so unfortunately will not be back visiting when there are half a dozen pho joints within 15min walk of where I live. 

Place was small, but service was good!

{"text":"We were recommended this place by our friends and it did not disappoint. The Pho was delicious. The food reminded us of our visit to Vietnam. Even the price point was very reasonable. We will definitely be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"My favourite place for pho in Toronto. Always busy but always fast service. If you want authentic, delicious pho, this is the place you need!"}
{"text":"Pork vermicelli bun was good but wish they gave more veggies in it. Was mostly just lettuce."}
{"text":"Pho-bruary continues! This time, on a block of Vietnamese businesses in a neighborhood I never go to. Where the hell was I?

The Pho-ndamentals
Pho Tai Gan (rare beef and beef tendon); large = $6.50
Broth: More light and refreshing than hearty and rich; the sweetness from the star anise was delightful
Beef: Too lean, too flavorless, too dry
Tendon: I got jaw fatigue from all chewing. Ugh.
Noodles: Fresh, slippery noodles that were as smooth on my palate as a romp on satin sheets; however, they may have been too delicate and I almost wish they were a tad thicker 
Garnishes: the mung bean sprouts and basil were fresh; they included saw leaf (because sarah l. was not with me this time)

Service: Efficient; just like at every pho joint, the paper and pen ordering method means I don't even have to talk to anybody. One day, I'll be able to order on a touch screen and have robots bring the food to the table.

Other: The place is smallish and was packed with Vietnamese families. The \"large\" is smaller than the \"medium\" at Pho Pasteur but they didn't charge me tax. The total was exactly $6.50. But I am paying the MSG dehydration after-tax.

BOTTOM LINE: The fresh noodles were a nice treat but I wish they used better quality meat. Oh, how to rate?...let's say 3 stars."}
{"text":"The food here is very delicious! Like many other people said its like a no-frills restaurant cash only! One time I had to pay for my friend so don't forget! But overall I would rate 4 stars. Plus I play basketball near here so it is a very nice place to go after a workout like that!"}
{"text":"I've hunted for the best Bun Bo Hue soup all over the GTA.  I've tried other highly rated Pho restaurants including on Ossington and the joke of a place that is actually called \"Bun Bo Hue\".  If you like real b.b.h. come here on weekends (b.b.h. is ONLY served on weekends) and prepare for the best you've ever had."}
{"text":"Seriously the best authentic Vietnamese food in all of Toronto. My father is Vietnamese and refuses to eat anywhere else. It's amazing. The portions are insane and so incredibly well priced. The staff speaks English and are so friendly. Just overall, it's an amazing place. Amazing food at great prices. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Great food.  Flavourful & fresh veggies with the Pho.  Good selection of table sauces.  You won't be disappointed to visit this Pho restaurant.  I went on a Wednesday afternoon and it was continuously busy so I imagine that on the weekends, it is packed."}
{"text":"I would give 4.5 if I could

I always go here for banh cuon, probably one of the best I've had. 5/5

My boyfriend LOVES their bun bo hue.

Aside from that their durian milkshake is amazing.


This place can get REALLY crowded, and is cash only.

Nice people working there as well!"}
{"text":"Pho Linh, my love! I recently moved nearby and didn't even bother getting groceries for the first little while since I immediately fell for Pho Linh. The only downfall is cash only, but that's a lesson you learn once and it's no big deal. 

The prices are more than reasonable and the pho is great - this is what got me in the door. But the rest of the menu and the service is what keep bringing me back. I'm obsessed with the cold shrimp & pork rolls (#23) and the vermicelli, grilled pork + spring roll combo (#40). I've tried other items, but these are real winners. The ingredients are consistently fresh, it's never greasy, and the herbs they use are so crisp and juicy. The service is always friendly and quick. Don't ever change, Pho Linh."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Vietnamese restaurant for over 2 years. It has always been consistent. Solid food. Solid service. Will come again and again."}
{"text":"This was probably my favourite pho place in Toronto as they use fresh noodle and ingredients.  The place seems like it had been undergone renovation recently so it looks more comfy dining in.  Their weekend special is bun bo hue which is always my favour.  But during my last visit I feel some components are missing such as coagulated pig blood and bun bo hue itself still tastes delicious but more of satay flavour.  I didn't taste much of shrimp paste in the soup as well.  The pho itself is still my favour in Toronto, the broth is light and perhaps not as flavourful as pho at Thinh Thanh, but they use flat rice noodle unlike many other places in Toronto that use dry vermicelli type.  Another item worth mentioning is pho bo kho, very very flavourful and yummy.  But they only serve that btw Mon-Thu.

The price is reasonable and may have to wait in the line up during weekend lunch rush, but thankfully the wait time is always short due to quick turnaround time.  Overall a solid 4/5"}
{"text":"Pho is excellent, meat are well portioned 
Soup are great, not thirsty afterward
Lots of Thai Basil, and Culantro are fresh

Banh Cuon are too soft
Banh Beo are too thick and soft 

Great Prices"}
{"text":"There's a lot of tasty pho options in Toronto but this place has tasty pho, friendly staff, and a bright atmosphere with tons of natural light! I got the rare beef pho. The beef wasn't super rare when it got to my table but the broth was incredible. Definitely recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5

Came here because my friend wanted to try different Pho places in Toronto. Service was speedy, staff were nice, a different pace from other Vietnamese establishments.

Now to the Pho, we both got the Rare beef with brisket. I can see why white people like it. The broth is very rich, you can really taste the beef but it overpowers the spices.  The broth wasn't as savory as I prefer, nor did it have the unique cardamom and clove touch. The noodles however were very soft, thicker than the most other Pho places here in Toronto. The brisket had a good distribution of fat, but the beef was very lean. They gave a pretty decent amount of meat and noodles for a XL. 

My friend did not like the Pork+Shrimp roll he ordered, he complained the lettuce wasn't fresh.

Overall it was a pretty decent meal. It's worth a try, but I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"My go to authentic pho place. 

I usually like going to restaurants which are the closest to the authentic taste and Pho Linh never disappoints!!"}
{"text":"Bun bo hue was so delicious. Best one I've had in Toronto so far. Lots of lemongrass and just enough spiciness. Super fast service. I swear faster than fast food! Very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Best pho in town! After going to a few places in Chinatown and ossingtion we found this place and make the trip every week! The broth is clean and very good. They only take cash and there is usually a line during dinner peak hours but they flip tables a lot. Max I've waited is 30 minutes. I get the rare beef. It's great!"}
{"text":"I use to think all pho was the same, until I found Pho linh! The service is quick, the broth is amazing! I've tried the vermacelli as well, just as delicious. And don't forget the spring rolls."}
{"text":"I'm from Scarborough and have my go-to spot so when I had made plans to meet up with a friend who lives in the area, I of course relied on good ol' yelp. This was the top rated so I thought, of course, why not? 

Place is small and busy, but we were seated immediately. I read another review about the service level dropping closer to the end of the night and they weren't kidding. Though, it didn't really put a damper to our dining experience. 

Spring Rolls - Very crispy wrap yet the inside was a little on the dryer side. Thankfully, it came with the usual sauce. 4/5.

Pho with rare beef and beef balls - One of my usual picks at any Pho place. The broth was nice though I did flavour it with Oyster sauce and Sriracha. Am really now realizing that it was crazy salty as I'm thirsty AF. But it was still pretty good. Would I go back? Sure, if I were in the area again, but I wouldn't go out of my way. 4/5"}
{"text":"Spring rolls are a must try, super crunchy and lots of fillings!
Crab tomato soup is definitely to die for ."}
{"text":"Best pho restaurant in Toronto! Very authentic and the staff are super friendly (although they merely just greet you and bring you your order). My love and I go there at least once or twice per week. We tried other pho places and it's just not the same... Try the veggie/tofu pho and the spicy hue noodle (it's only available on the weekends though). Oh and they're owned operated by actual Vietnamese as oppose to Chinese..."}
{"text":"This place is DAMN DELICIOUS!  It is probably my favourite pho place that I've tried in Toronto.

The broth is delicious, the noodles they use are super smooth and delicious and the portions are large.  The service is fast and the food is a very good price.  The area is not the nicest and unless you're in the area or found it on Yelp it's not a place I could see someone going out of their way to try but it's worth making the trek out here."}
{"text":"This place makes a delicious pho. I ordered rare beef to go, and in typical fashion is was ready in under 5 minutes. Got it home, the broth was scalding hot still, so it perfectly cooked the beef. The noodles were the right texture, and the salad was fresh as can be, with no wilted brown tails on the bean sprouts. Really good flavour on the broth, although I agree with other posters that this is not one where the typical spices of anise and cardamom sing. Well rounded and meaty, it was still the perfect comfort food. I skipped my usual condiments doctoring, because it really didn't need it; the salt levels are bang on. While I didn't eat in, I did scope out the space. Not 100% clean, but not disturbingly dirty either. It had the sort of patina you'd expect from a place where customers are enthusiastically slurping down big bowls of soup. Will be back to try the bùn."}
{"text":"Great place , got to be my favorite.  Can get very busy. One of the best pho, and only one I know that uses fresh noodles.  Summer time u are greeted with a cold tea - nice."}
{"text":"Steamed rice rolls were good. Always have a hard time finding this dish. 

Stars are based on the food only. In the entire dinning experience with at least 3 people serving (greeting, order taking, delivering food and paying), the only words spoken to us was \"cash or credit?\""}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about this place but was really disappointed. I got the $7 rare pho, the portion was nice and they give you a nice plate of sprouts and greens but other then that, the beef seems to be of low quality and cut a little too thick for my liking . The broth is very very bland, I couldn't taste anything except the flavours from the beef and added greens."}
{"text":"My pho go to place. On weekends they have bun Bo hue which is my favourite. The servers are super friendly and I love their soup base. The place gets packed on weekends but the wait is fairly fast."}
{"text":"Been here twice: most authentic and delicious Vietnamese restaurant that I've ever been!They use various Vietnamese herbs (not just cilantro); cold tea option is a sign of care; amazingly fresh and tasty; nice and clean dining area; good service; again really authentic :)"}
{"text":"Probably safe to say that this is one of my favourite pho places to go! Everything we ordered was authentic and so delicious! The Banh Cuon is a must get ! The Bun Bo Hue was also one of the best I've had, the broth was a little too spicy for me but I still very much enjoyed it! The spring rolls were crispy and everything was so worth the price !

The only thing is that parking is so hard to get! There is a parking lot behind the restaurant but it was very tight, if you get lucky, you might get a parking spot right in front of the restaurant. What made up for it was that parking is free after 6 PM on the weekend IF you can get a spot."}
{"text":"Let's start with service... The guy who took my order was good but the lady who processed my payment was rude and killed the whole vibe. Food was less than OK. Ordered veggie soup with rare beef on the side. Veggies were just broccoli and bok choy. No mushrooms no carrots, very bland. Beef had this strange aftertaste. Yucky. Bean sprouts weren't looking fresh. Also ordered a spring roll and all I could taste was burned oil. There was a couple next to me going crazy with compliments over their food. So I wonder if my standards are just higher then most' or what. I eat at plenty hole in the wall kinda joints and prefer them to the bigger chains since I find food is much better and homier. I wouldn't recommend it be back."}
{"text":"Out of the many pho places, I love coming here for their fresh noodles. Portion sizes are good and the avocado shake is a must . Highly recommend! Been coming here for years!"}
{"text":"One of the best pho restaurants in Toronto. Cheap, fast, tasty. Well worth it, and conveniently located on College so you can just take a streetcar across.

The service is not amazing (hello? It's under $10), but the food is good and that's all I care about.

Update: I downgraded it to 4 stars because I recently visited and they were stingy on the beef, it was overcooked and while the shakes were delicious and the broth was still flavourful, I found a better place:

Tien Thanh @ 57 Ossington

The beef is out of this world, and the broth is so flavourful it makes me cry tears of pho."}
{"text":"i get vietnamese food at home so i am pretty picky about vietnamese food restuarants.  however i have to say pho linh is the bomb!  i usually get #12 banh cun.  best in town!!!!  and i love their coconut shake!  the prices are reasonable.  the staff are friendly. lunch time during the weekends therre is usually a wait!  they do take out and just started to do deliveries.  the location is not the best and the place needs a face lift besides that i got no complaints!"}
{"text":"The best pho place in Toronto. Make sure you always ask for fresh noodles. Very fast service. Sometimes you have to wait in line but the turnover is quick. It is cash only. I love the specials you can get from fri-sun."}
{"text":"This has to be the best place for Pho and probably the most authentic Viet food ever. I go here on a regular basis since being introduced to this out of the down town area option. 

My viet friends vouch for this place and are willing to make the trek from all corners of the Toronto area to have the pho and the numerous other dishes which I wish I could name but will have to use my limited memory to describe instead. 

Oh try the lime soda drink, this is the kit's mitts for rehydration.

The parking situation is pretty easy around here as it is mostly residential and the restaurant itself well it is not exactly big or extravagant but the seating is good enough and I have never had a problem getting seating and there is usually at minimum five of us.

Service is great, food is great and it is a comfortable place to enjoy food so more than happy to give this the hi 5"}
{"text":"Came here because a vietnamese friend told me this was the best place for pho.

I ordered the Bun Bo Hue (I always order this anywhere I go!) and it was not bad ... not quite as spicy and flavourful as I would like it but it was decent.

My husband ordered the Pho and he was disappointed.  He said it was at about the same level of tasty as Pho Hung (which we both don't find that tasty).  

The restaurant itself is modern and clean.  The service is friendly.  

Prices are decent.

Will probably not return ... still on the hunt for a \"go to\" pho place!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets, this is my favourite pho restaurant in the city.

Incredibly fast service, even when the place is packed, friendly service and consistently good food, it's hard to beat Pho Linh.

Even when it's ordered to go, the meals are packed with care and the pho is deconstructed so that it doesn't get mushy in transit.

If you're in the area looking for pho, you have many choices, but hopefully after reading the many great things people have to say about Pho Linh, you'll make the right decision."}
{"text":"College and Dufferin c'est le 2e quartier viet à Toronto après College et Spadina.
La restauration ici est très bonne et le service rapide comme tout resto viet qui se respecte.
Le classique phô est tjs aussi bon.
Un bémol? A 21h en semaine il remballe déjà, pas l'endroit idéal pour manger son phô après 21h donc.....


// College and Dufferin is the second vietnamese district in TO after College and Spadina.
The food here is very good and service is very quick as any vietnamese restaurant.
Go for the classic phô.
One bad thing? At 9pm they already cleaning the place so this is not the good spot to have a late night phô."}
{"text":"I've read so many glowing reviews I had to try it out for myself. The place is a little run down looking and there were sauce stains along the wall where my table is up against. Just remind yourself you're here for the food and NOT look around too much. I wanted to order the Bun Bo Hue but it's only available Friday to Sunday. I ended up ordering the Pho Bo Kho, a spicy beef stew noodle soup. Service was fast maybe because I was the only one there at 10 am. It came piping hot along with the requisite side of sprouts/herbs. The soup appeared oily but once you mix it around it's not that noticeable. But the taste was very flavorful. You know they took care & time to cook the broth down to this level of complexity. The rice noodles were the wide kind and soaked up the broth nicely. The beef brisket was a little gristly/fat but tender. I'm not a big fan of beef stew but this was damn amazing. I can't wait to come back for their Bun Bo Hue."}
{"text":"Delicious pho & decent bun. We've come here a lot since we've moved to this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"1/ I come here for comfort food from home. This place is used to be known for their Steamed rice rolls a long time ago but recently I find they don't use the traditional way to make the rice wrap anymore. Therefore, the Rice roll is tasted different but still ok. Other food, such as Pho or Bun Bo Hue, is still number one on our list. My husband loves the avocado shake of this particular location. They make it better than most places.

2/ It is time for this location to upgrade their interior decor since I notice the seat cushion on their bends is dated and torn. The washroom needs to be fixed and brighten it up. It is always out of hand soap or tissue. 

3/ Customer service is no where friendly but not rude either; no acknowledgement if they notice you're their regulars. 

4/ Cleanliness: on average side. They should learn how to clean the table better after the customers leave. 

Overall: still return for the food whenever we are in downtown big TO but looking elsewhere for alternative."}
{"text":"The Pho is average at best, still good. A bit salty and less flavor compared my my favorite spot on Ossington.  Company was good, with my friend Stanley and that always helps."}
{"text":"Very good traditional standard pho. Good price, fast service, delicious as pho always is. 5/5"}
{"text":"While this place isn't known to have any MIND-blowing dishes/entrees, I must say that their food is consistently tasty.  Everything that I've tried gets a B grade from me.  However, if you're a Pho snob, I would suggest you go to Tien Thanh on Ossington Street....and you can thank me later!"}
{"text":"The rice rolls are great!  They're little bundles of yummy-ness!  

The chicken pho with rare beef was just so-so.  The chicken pieces didn't taste very good.  The rare beef was fine though.

That is all."}
{"text":"My favourite place for pho, I usually get the rare beef with beef balls. The bun and spring rolls are really great too."}
{"text":"Came to this place with an old friend. I ordered the Special Pho with everything in it the service was fast and effcient. I've been dying to go back I'd have to say my pho was hot and steamy. 

I'll be back this was worth a trip before work or after for dinner. Next time I'm up in the area I'll be sure to try this place again."}
{"text":"The pho is authentic and good. Many of my foodie friends (CHAR C) recommend this place. I have been here couple of times and other times where we couldn't afford the wait. 

The pho is very good here. Last night was Friday and they had their \"hue\" beef pho  special. Beware it's very spicy!! Otherwise it's very good. 

It's a small place so it can get pretty busy. Go there during off hours to ensure you get a seat. 

The prices are reasonable. Everything is great but it has a funky smell, I suspect it might be the fish sauce. lol

{"text":"I've been here twice. Both times the service was very fast and the pho was tasty and the price was reasonable. 

I can't comment on the other food as I've only had chicken pho and a spring roll. The chicken is a bit spongy but the flavour was nice. The broth is delicious. 

I would definitely return next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Be prepared to be disappointed by every other pho place from this point forward. Every time I eat my delicious bowl of beef ball pho, I think I could eat it for every meal, forever. It's just so good, and the ingredients are really fresh. I haven't tried any of the non-pho menu items yet, but watching them come out of the kitchen they look great too. But I just can't stop ordering the pho! Large bowl always and they bring it out filled to the brim, the server verrry carefully setting it down. It's 8.50 taxes in for a bowl and if you give them a 20 they down give you back a handful of change either. I would probably tip more if they did!"}
{"text":"I love coming here!

Every time I have a craving, this is the 1st pho place I think of in the city. If it is Wednesday, I know exactly what I will order: Ph Bò Kho (spicy beef stew) aka. S3. The beef is delicious, the soup is spicy but not overly so and the noodle are just yummy. 

I also really like the jackfruit shake here. I always try jackfruit shake whenever I go somewhere new and very few places compare.

The place is small and can get busy fast so make sure to get there before the crowd. Turnaround is quick though so never a long wait."}
{"text":"Great pho if you are in the college area. 

Fairly priced and decent size portions, pho Linh on college is probably the best pho I had in town. Fully flavour and kitchen fully run by Vietnamese that bring you to the table a slice of their own country. 

The only downside, the restaurant closes at 9.00 pm!

:("}
{"text":"Excellent Phô, just wish they had more appetizers that weren't pork. All in all would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food and this place is pretty decent.  we ordered bun bo hue xl, pho tai xl, and pork chop and egg on rice.  a server came by shortly after we ordered with a plastic bowl, plastic spoon and scissors for our 3 year old.  these guys are on point, I didn't even have to ask!  the food was good, not too salty and not like your average msg laden pho houses all around town.   the food could have arrived hotter and in larger portions, but all in all a good experience without breaking the bank.  we'll be back."}
{"text":"A quaint little place with the air of authenticity and honesty. Plenty of meat in the helping of the standard pho and the accompanying salady things were fine.
Small tables very close together, obviously popular with the locals, busy at Friday lunchtime.
Good value, and worth a detour.

{"text":"I came here to meet a friend, and wasn't that hungry to begin with, but coming in here, the aroma overpowered my senses to order. I was impressed right at the strat with the spring rolls. They weren't big in size, but they were definately tasty. And also ended up ordering a bowl of pho not even being hungry. This place is good, and is busy on just a regular weekday lunch.

I wasn't too impressed with the iced Vietnamese Coffee here, but maybe that is just me."}
{"text":"This place ain't much to look at, but the pho is on point.  This place serves your basic Vietnamese cuisine that is consistent and fast. I mostly get the rare beef and brisket pho, but sometimes order the grilled pork and rice with an egg on it."}
{"text":"I would put this in the top 2 or 3 pho restaurants I've been to, and that's a large sample size across North America. The most important thing about pho is the broth, theirs can't be beat. The second most important thing is the noodles, and upon request you can get fresh noodles. Last but not least, the sides, from the spring rolls to the shakes to the coffees, this place is legit."}
{"text":"My epic quest for the Toronto's best pho noodle house has landed me in another spot... somewhat off the beaten track from east or west chinatown. Pho Linh is a small vietnamese restaurant located at College and Dufferin; a little cluster of vietnamese shops and restaurants in the midst of the surrounding portuguese enclave. Recently renovated, Pho Linh delivers one of the better Pho's in downtown Toronto. It's money baby!

Broth: lightly coloured, but sweet and rich in flavor. not overly salty, unlike other places in town. soup comes garnished with a healthy topping of scallions and cilantro always a pleasant sight to see.

Noodles: slightly wider but I think it's because these are actually fresh rice noodles instead of the typical rice sticks used-they taste uberly fresh too. the only FRESH noodles I've come across amongst the pho joints downtown!

Herb plate: saw and basil on hand; definite plus and lime wedge. more places should offer saw though not a dealbreaker for me so long as the broth is on point

Beef: My only beef is with the beef BUT  only because it is not as paper thin as I like my beef to be, good quality eye of round used.

I have also tried their banh cuon - unique vientnamese rice flour crepes filled with wood ear mushrooms and ground pork topped with fried shallots, cilantro and bean sprouts served with a side of fish sauce and vietnamese sausage. Delish! The thin, delicate rice flour sheets add a melt in your mouth contrast to the savory filling and the fried shallots provide a pleasant pop on top. 

The rest of the menu is extensive-bun, broken rice and specialty soups are available as well and the prices are in keeping with most vietnamese joints around town. But man! I think I have another winner for pho in Toronto! At least this is a pho worth enduring the slow service of the 506 streetcar for."}
{"text":"After hearing raving reviews from my friends, I had to come try this place out. Apparently they're known for their bun bo hue and their banh cuon. And today I was craving a hot bowl of noodles so I decided to come here and see what my friends were talking about. My cousin and i came here around 4pm and already a lot of tables were occupied. We ended up getting a table by the window. I opened the menu and the first thing I saw was the bun bo hue (it's a weekend special fri-sun). So we ordered that plus the banh cuon. 

When the banh cuon arrived, I was so excited to try it. I've never had it before but it's like rice roll with pork. The rice roll itself is very thin and is sticky and when dipped into fish sauce...heaven! The bun bo hue tasted a bit different but in a good way. At other places it had too much of a lemongrass flavour to it. But this was different, there was a subtle taste of lemongrass plus other flavours. This was also spicy! I'm glad I tried this place out. I heard their other pho are amazing as well and I'd definitely come back again.

They take cash* only!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pho! I took my friend here (we're friends from Edmonton) and we both liked it a lot. The house special is delish and the noodles were excellent. I'll definitely go back again. The only downside, as with so many Toronto restaurants, is that the washrooms are not accessible."}
{"text":"Excellent food and value, but service can be a bit flaky, especially late in the evening..."}
{"text":"My first review on Yelp! How exciting? ! :D

I first came here recommended by a friend, even though I read about this place numerous times before on BlogTo. 

Let me just say this.. BEST Bun Bo Hue EVER! The perfect bowl of yummyness for a cold winter night, a bad sinus, a stressful work day, when you need something comforting, you like spicy food but can't handle too much heat, a dish to steal off of from your significant other...  etc :)

They only serve this from Friday - Sunday priced at $9 for a XL. What a deal! 

I'll be coming back here as much as I can, especially on weekends! 

Yayyyyyyyyy!"}
{"text":"I use to eat here alot. One of the best pho in city. I have taken a lot of people to this place to eat and all of them liked it. I live in Markham and some time I still drive all the away to this place to eat a good bowl of pho. 

The service is alright. I don't really go for service in an Asian Restuarant. What do you you gonna get for 10 bucks? Four Season Service? Although I think this place might be running form immigration scam. Everytime I go in there have different group of people serving :-) Then again that goes for all cheap restaurant in Toronto. The only regular people you will see in there are the owners. :-)"}
{"text":"Checked this place out after reading Yelp reviews. SO happy I did!

The rice rolls are soooo good. it was my first time having them! I will absolutely order that again next time.

I also ordered Pho and LOVEEEEED the fat, fresh noodles. They were the perfect texture for me. I really really enjoyed the pho. Dinner for two was $25, which is a steal and we were VERY full when we left. 

This place is very small. We must have gotten there at the right time, because by the time we got our food (which was light speed quick) there was a lineup at the door. People didn't seem to mind to wait, either. That's a good sign!

They do not get 5 stars for service, they didn't return to the table once, but I honestly didn't expect them to. It's an in-and-out kinda place. 

I will definitely be back, very very soon. Definitely a hit in my books."}
{"text":"I agree that this place has gone downhill.

We have been to Pho Linh a few times already. Looks like the ownership changed at this restaurant as we no longer saw these familiar faces we used to see the last few times we went here. I can clearly remember that the place was packed when I was here for the first time. Today we went back and there was not as many patrons during lunchtime. The order came in quick but pho did not taste as good as before. Service was all over the place: we were not greeted/seated when entered so we just chose a table ourselves. The lady then saw us and handed us the menu; then after I gave the order to the guy, the lady handed us the menu again.

When my husband came to the counter to pay the server did not seem to want to print a receipt for us. 

I felt bad as I suggested going here. Will probably not go back again. There is too many options in North York."}
{"text":"Great special dishes other than Pho. The Pho taste great but is underportioned with extra soup."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in this neighborhood! Not only is the food cheap and delicious, they also make it super fast -- I always get it in under 5 minutes!"}
{"text":"This place pho is very good. Their pho broth is good. Price is inexpensive. The place is very small and loud. This is not a good place if you want to relax and enjoy your meal. When they are very busy, there will a line out the door. Avoid going in the weekends and lunch hours."}
{"text":"I've eaten here multiple times in the past month. I would definitely come here for the food and not the service or ambiance lol. 
Pho Linh is well known within the Vietnamese company and one thing that sets this place apart from other Pho restaurants is that they use fresh pho noodles. Fresh noodles are softer and have a chewiness to them that the more common dehydrated noodles can't compare too.

Dishes I've tried are: 
Spring Rolls: decent, I didn't find anything special about them. I like how they are sold per piece. 

Banh Canh: This is a weekday specialty. The noodles are made of tapioca so there is a chewiness to them. 

Bun Bo Hue: This is a weekend specialty. The broth is not too spicy and doesn't have the intense red colouring that other BBH has. The portion is good, and the flavouring is good. 

Bun Rieu: This is also a weekend specialty. Bun rieu is my favourite Vietnamese dish but it my least favourite dish I tried at Pho Linh. The broth is decent but what I didn't like about this dish is the \"rieu\". I prefer a smooth texture but for this dish it was like they grounded up shellfish with the shell intact so it was micro crunchy bits. 

Pho: my favourite dish here. I love that the noodles are fresh so they are softer than other places. The broth is good too, it's not salty and I don't feel overly thirsty when eating, so limited msg. Writing this review is making me crave Pho Linh lol 

There is a good variety of options here. You pretty much can't go wrong with what you choose."}
{"text":"We have been loyal costumers of Pho Linh for the past 2 years; we come here almost once a week and it never fails to deliver the best pho and beef stew noodle soup (i don't remember the exact name but it's a weekday only special) in Toronto.
I decided to finally write a review after experiencing the frustration of not being able to find a equally good Vietnamese restaurant in The Bay area in the US. 
Really have to appreciate Pho Linh for its consistent cheap and amazing Vietnamese food! Didn't know I would miss it so much until I can no longer have it!  :("}
{"text":"Best Pho in the City in my opinion. Their fried spring rolls are amazing, very tasty broth, cash only bring money and go try it!"}
{"text":"I can't speak to the quality of the food here because I left immediately after sitting down. It smelled FUNKY in here. Not appetizing at all. The service was slow to arrive and the server was less than friendly. The fatal flaw: CASH ONLY. 

I came here based on the Yelp ratings which seem unusually inaccurate. I won't be coming back - there is too much Pho to explore elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went all the way downtown to try this pho place. It was amazing, the best pho I have had. The broth was truly authentic and the service was great. I tried the special pho and the rice rolls with minced pork. It taste like it came straight from Vietnam, full of flavour. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"On the way to a Softball game, I mistakenly biked west of the sushi place at which I planned to stop. Knowing Pho Linh was nearby, I parked my bike and stopped in, sweaty and parched.

I was greeted with an ice cold pot of tea, which was very welcome. It had been awhile since my last visit, and I don't know if this is a winter-hot/summer-cold thing, but I've never been somewhere that based their complimentary beverage offerings on the weather. 

I perused the menu looking for a Pescetarian/Vegetarian friendly dish. I started sweating again when I realized there weren't any, save for an appetizer. As I started to plot my McQueenesque great escape to another restaurant, I glanced at the Vegetarian Tofu Pho paper on the wall. Phew!

The Pho was perfect. I was pretty skeptical about my order; Considering it was sweltering out and I was about to engage in athletic activity, soup was the last thing I had a hankering for. Against the odds, I sipped and slurped my way to pure satisfaction. 

The broth was delicious - I generally douse my Pho with Sriracha, but there was no need for added spice. The \"small\" bowl I order was huge, packed with vermicelli and about 4-5 giant cubes of tofu. 

If you're a vegetarian and looking for something other than soup, I would recommend somewhere else. If you're in the mood for Pho, I'd say this is definitely a bowl I'd savour again."}
{"text":"I didn't have the pho here.  However, with items like banh cuon and banh beo on the menu, who needs that same same crap that you can get everywhere else?

The lowdown:

1. The banh cuon is fantastic.  I recommend the one that includes banh cong tom, a delicious deep fried tapioca \"muffin\" topped with shrimp!  It made my heart stop twice, once because I fell in love, the second when it clogged my arteries. 

2. The banh beo was ok, not fantastic.  However, this isn't a dish that is often found at Viet restaurants, so I had to order it.  It's worth trying in my opinion, and for $4, why not?

3. Though I didn't have the pho, I can say that they do use the thicker fresh noodles, which I love.  Plus if you order the raw beef, the beef actually comes raw on a side plate.  Also a nice touch.

4. Prices are good, if not cheap.

5. You can order individual rolls like spring rolls or goi cuon (cold rolls) for $1.50.  No more commitments to a full order costing you $4-5!  Amazing!

6. Free street parking in the evenings!

I am beginning to think that the Dufferin/College oasis of Vietnamese joints is becoming the new Ossington.  I am loving both Pho Linh and Pho Canh Buom so far.  Next up to try in the area?  Pho Phoenix.  Could this be the start of the Holy Pho Trinity?  Time will tell.

PS - If I come here next time for pho and it's on the money, this will be a 5-star place!"}
{"text":"First things first: while I have had Vietnamese cuisine before, I had never actually had a bowl of Pho.  I broke by Pho virginity last night with Linh.

It was pretty much was I expected: a delicious broth with several pieces of rare beef slices (I can do without balls, tripe or tendon--it takes a drink or two before I can get more adventurous with eating animals parts) and those thin rice noodles.  I don't like raw onion (grossest thing in the universe) so that was hard to deal with.  But overall it was good.  I could eat those noodles all day long.

Again, I can't comment on the broth in terms of sweetness or savoriness, amount of beef/noodle to broth ratio, etc.  It seemed right and was exactly what I anticipated.  I can't imagine any Pho fan being disappointed here.

I also tried these shrimp rice cake things.  They were OK--about the right amount of \"foreignness\" for me .  $5 got you a whole plate which was way too much for one person--only order these if you are able to share with others.

As for the restaurant?

Service was swift and efficient--although not really warm.  (But what do you expect for a $7 bowl of soup?  I think the lack of warmth makes for a more authentic experience).  We were not rushed at all and took a long time.

Value was great.  $12 for my two items.  There is no way I could ever make this for myself at home.

Ambiance was so-so.  Clean and well lit, not too cramped, but the acoustics were horrible.  I could barely hear my date at times.  Bathroom was clean.

Bottom line?
Very recommended if you can walk here.  I would not come out for this place as I assume it offers nothing that you cannot find elsewhere in the city.  But if I lived in the area, I would dine here on a regular basis, no doubt about that."}
{"text":"The best pho in the city. Their weekday special Mon-Thurs of hot and spicy beef noodle soup is just out of this world. It's beef parts slow cooked with carrot, tomato, and spices. Not really that spicy but really delicious. Fresh noodles and friendly service are a win."}
{"text":"My partner and I eat here at least once a month.  Great pork chop, fried chicken and rice dishes and the pho is nice and flavourful!  It never disappoints."}
{"text":"Best chicken pho. Nice deep fried vermicelli rolls too. Try the chili oil.  Cash only. Atm downstairs."}
{"text":"Best Pho Ever! 

First off Cash only

Have the beef and tripe Pho with an  extra side  of basil and bean sprouts and go extra large 

Enjoy! 

The rolls are super fresh too


Pho is all about the broth.... And they have the broth in spades and really  Milk  the beef bones and marrow  for all its taste 

Best devoured on super cold days and Toronto has that.... Kansas city too but their Pho is like dishwater"}
{"text":"****CASH ONLY?**** SERIOUSLY? you got to be kiddin' me!
I took my family here today as I wanted to introduce them to Vietnamese cuisine, pho and the likes. I read the reviews and I thought it would be a great place to break them into this food.
So yes, the PHO is not bad at all, I had better but really, we had the one with tofu and the one with rare meat and they were good. the noodles are thick and fresh and size is good.
we also had the fried chicken with rice which was average at best + the spring rolls which were ok. So all in all the food was fine and I would probably give it a 3 or even 4 stars.
BUT...
when going to pay I was pulling out my debit card and was told no way! cash only!!! Didn't you see the little piece of paper on the door? you have no cash? it's ok, we have a machine downstairs that would cost me another $3.50 or so. 
Furthermore, they made a mistake sending us a juice that we didnt order and when I said I didnt order it they refused to take it off the bill.
Needless to say I was completely ticked off by then and just wanted to leave. NOT HAPPY.

Common, it is 2016 and 99% of people do not carry cash on them! nevermind it's about 15 cents per transaction. 
The only reason they dont take cards is because the owners of this restaurant either skip the cash register and keep most of cash without paying taxes or they just want to make an extra $2 from the money machine downstairs. 
That is not the kind of restaurant I want to give business to."}
{"text":"Good pho, fresh and fast. Place is clean and the service is good.
The size of the bowls are little on the smaller side compared to other pho places I been to but all in all it is  recommended."}
{"text":"We never would have tried Pho Linh based on its location and outside appearance -- a bit of a barren stretch on College before Dufferin, the sign reminds of those bad, small town diners that serve frozen fries and hockey puck burgers under guise of \"home cookin'\".

Still, yelpers recommend it and we thought we'd take a break from Pho Phuong and try a new place.  It helps that it's equidistant from our house.

Ambience is low key, very quiet, no multi-TV distraction (YAY!!!), and clean, though the menus were a bit skuzzy.  I blame the youth of today.

As we were sitting down, another couple arrived to a chance meeting with apparent acquaintances who had been enjoying a meal:  \"You've got good taste in restaurants!\" they remarked to their friends.  \"This is the place for Pho in TO.\"  How's that for a first impression upon arriving? 

Anyway!

I ordered the S3 and #13, with a bean shake to wash it down.  The server informed that, due to Monday being a holiday (Easter weekend), S3 was unavailable -- he seemed somewhat chagrined, as though he was offending me.  No worries!  I got the Hue style beef pho instead, which is their weekend offering.

Heather went for the ol' standby of noodles, grilled pork, and spring roll with salad (nice greens, no crappy/wilty iceberg lettuce!) and her customary avocado milkshake.

The soup was very good, tasty though not extraordinary, and came with nice, thick rice noodles rather than the vermicelli style one normally sees -- this pleased me greatly!  I definitely prefer a more robust noodle, so they score points here.  The side of sprouts, basil, limi, and a chili was very generous... which is good, because I usually have to ask for more.

The banh cuon (I think that's the name) isn't normally my style, but it was good.  The odd little muffin thing topped with a fried shimp was damned tasty (I didn't bother with the shrimp... it was desiccated, though had served its purpose by imparting mucho flavour).  

I have come to realize, however, that I'm just not a fan of Vietnamese style sausage... at least not the spongy, starchy kind served here (and many other places).  They taste good, sure, but it just ain't meat.  I'd feel the same way if I was served a hotdog on the side.

Heather remarked that her dinner was excellent, though she prefers the crispy spring rolls at Pho Phuong -- not because Pho Linh's are somehow lesser, oh no!  Linh's are huge, and crammed with meat.  So if you prefer a meaty roll, definitely try them out here... you won't be disappointed.     

Shakes were both excellent, though they were served in plastic takeout cups when we were sitting down to eat (and it was pouring rain outside...).  Weird.  Ah well -- we'll ask for glass next time.

Finally, I've noticed a few people have questioned the service here.  We found it very fast, friendly, and good.  Absolutely no complaints there whatsoever.  Maybe it falters when it's busy... but it was A-OK this time around!

All in all we were quite pleased with our experience -- I tried a couple things I wouldn't normally order, so won't pass judgement based on the things I didn't care for (the sausage, for example).  We'll definitely be back, in particular because I want to try their basic chicken pho.  If they roast their chicken and the broth is good I'll consider switching my go-to Pho joint!

{"text":"Authentic and delicious Vietnamese food. Pho is delicious and I love their banh cuon. Wish they make the portions bigger for the banh cuon though."}
{"text":"My parents cook Vietnamese food so take my review with a grain of salt. As a family, we wanted to get an idea of what Viet restaurant food quality so we have been going out more often.
My dad suggested this restaurant after seeing it so many times while driving.
We ate dinner there and the restaurant was pretty empty. I thought the service was pretty poor. It took some time for a server to take our order and bus tables. There was 1 TV in the  space and all the employees seemed glued to it. When my mom ordered a dessert item, we waited well after finishing our meal and we had to ask again. Then I heard the microwave go and the dessert came in a plastic to go container.
As a control, I ordered the same dish:
Grilled pork spring roll with vermicelli.....$8.50 
A little OP compared to other restaurants.
The dish came to our table not hot at all (the meat that is).
The grilled pork seemed fried rather than grilled and perhaps it may have been sitting out like that like a stock ingredient. The cuts of meat were tough with quit a bit of fatty pieces that did not add flavour. There was a small amount in the bowl. The spring roll was dark in flavour. Some parts tasted burnt. This dish should come with a few herbs: mint, thai basil etc. I only got a few leafs of basil. There were vegetables in the dish but not a lot compared to the amount of rice noodle.
Not impressed."}
{"text":"A friend and I went there on Sunday November 15, 2015 around 3 pm.  It wasn't busy, but we were greeted right away.  I ordered the large, rare beef, meatball and rice noodles, and it arrived quickly and it was hot.  The rare beef was tender and the best I've tasted, however it could have contained more.  The thick noodles were awesome as well.  Also it was not as salty as other Pho places I have visited, so this was an excellent dish.  From reviews I have read, yes the wait staff are glued to the television, but it didn't affect the service.  The two wait staff were quite cute too!"}
{"text":"The constant pho wars debate rages on. This place has taken up a spot near the top of my list. 

I love the noodles here. Really seem to have a leg up on most other places.
Banh cuon is also tasty and pairs well. Service and price on point. 

I'm coming here if I pass by."}
{"text":"This is my second go to Vietnamese place when I'm up in the West end of T.O. Small little plaza, parking in front can be difficult on weekends but on the side there is more spots.  Usually get the rare beef Pho the soup base is just right and tasty.   Standard comes with the fresh rice noodle thin profile and I think you can opt for the dry type.  For appetizer we like the steam ground pork rice flour rolls (BANH CUON) very soft and delicious with fish dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Really good authentic pho. Rare to find the pho in Toronto with fresh noodles. Broth is flavourful and not too sweet. Meat is tender. Service is fast and typical Asian resrayrant: fast and out, not so much checking in. Ducked 1 star for them only to take cash."}
{"text":"I have been to Pho Linh now at least 15 times.  I was impressed with the freshness and the taste right away.  I rated it a four stars at the beginning because of some inconsistencies in portions.  However, the food and portions have gotten better and better."}
{"text":"I eat at Pho Linh regularly.
Likes:
-their broth in soups
-homemade taste, like my Dad's Pho (almost!:)
-their vermicelli dishes are beautifully done:  authentic, with fresh, high-quality ingredients
- spring rolls are excellent
-fresh spring rolls (Goi Cuon) with fragrant mint and shrimps which taste like shrimps
-rolls are ordered by number not sizes S, M or L
-their Viet-style rice flour rolls (banh cuon)
-their warm and humble service
-shakes/coffee/desserts are solid
-unpretentious decor, not trying to be sexy

Dislikes:
-I'm not a fan of fresh Pho noodles
-while it is incorrect that entrees range fr $15-25
( i would say $8-15) it is still slightly pricier than a comparable LOOKING Viet resto in this city
-they only take cash, no beer, and close too early

Go there. Try it.
My favorite Vietnamese south of Bloor street.

{"text":"Pho Linh is a very respectable Vietnamese restaurant in the Keele/Steeles area. I can see myself coming back here if I'm not willing to make the trip to the Jane/Weston and Finch area (AKA the Mecca of the Toronto pho scene).

Pho Linh is traditional, authentic, and like most pho restaurants, very reasonably priced. One thing my pho cohorts ('pho-horts', if you will) and I noticed is that the broth is noticeably less saltier than other comparable Vietnamese joints. If you're watching your blood pressure but craving some Vietnamese noodle soup, Pho Linh is the place to go."}
{"text":"It's an authentic vietnamese place. the staff is pretty friendly, but also leaves you to do your own thing.
i had the vermecelli noodles with pork and spring roll. the spring roll was quite good, lots of stuff inside. the pork was a bit burnt, but overall quite good.
tried a bit of the special pho, the noodles tasted quite good too.
i'd say it's not that much better than other phos, it's not any cheaper or anything, but just a nice family place to go to when you want some pho.

i really like having the iced tea they have during summer.

one thing i wish they had was a grilled chicken with spring roll, or grilled chicken to begin with. they have fried chicken, might be pan fried but not sure. perhaps try it next time."}
{"text":"I'm a serious Pho Lover, so when I heard about this place from the locals and saw the reviews, checking it out was a must. Ginger Gent and I ordered chicken and beef Pho ....to go in order to have date night by the fire. It such a wonderful surprise to get home and find the soup separated from the meat and noodles, which is ideal since you don't want your noodles super soggy. Needless to say the Pho was great and the smell is completely intoxicating."}
{"text":"Pho Linh is one of the nicer pho spots to try out when you're in the Little Italy area. It has two levels and comfy booth seats. They specialize in bun bo hue or spicy beef and lemongrass noodle soup but only serves them on weekends. It's is a bit pricer than other places but it's well worth it. The service is great and above average pho in Toronto."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with this place. Like many here have said their rice rolls (#12 on the menu) were amazing - they reminded me of how my mom used to make them. I had their weekend special spicy pho and loved it. It really hit the spot and left me thoroughly satisfied. Not crazy about their spring rolls - I find them over fried. Will be back."}
{"text":"As close to authentic PHO as you might find in Toronto.
Very good broth, good rare beef.
I also like the mango smoothies.  Prices are reasonable.
Bit of a weird stink to the interior, maybe it was an issue that day...?
A repeat spot for sure."}
{"text":"Fresh wrap was good.
But the pho, was horrible! Leaves a stale taste in my mouth, full of fat hardly any meat.... service was fast, but communication needs improvement.
We ordered soup with no beef balls and more MEAT! Instead we got all fat and cartilage.
No thanks"}
{"text":"Probably one of the tastier pho places near my office.  To be honest I quite enjoy it.  Pho is so comforting on a cold day.  This place is super busy at lunch times during the week, I recommend arriving a bit before noon or closer to 1; that way you can avoid the rush.  I had a small 04 pho today and it was delish!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"It's the best Pho restaurant in the area, so I highly recommend coming here if you're near. It's pretty small inside, so expect to wait for a table during prime eating hours. I believe they only accept cash. People come here because their food is of good value (tasty yet not too expensive). Their decor is nothing to write home about. I believe the restaurant is named after a Vietnamese singer, who happens to be the owner's sister. There is free parking on the surrounding side streets, or paid meter parking on College Street.

I always order either the pho or banh cuon, or both!  Their bun bo hue is pretty OK."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Must try avocado shake. My parents took me when I was younger and I would always enjoy it. Now whenever I crave some good Vietnamese food, I come to here. Memories. Good ones."}
{"text":"Just had lunch. It was delicious. The beef pho broth was perfect and my #30 was a nice hearty breakfast with a thin sliced, not over cooked pork chop, egg, pork/rice/spice loaf stuff, sandy noodles, dipping sauce, fresh lettuce, cucumber slices, and rice. Service was very quick - we were in and out in forty minutes but we got lucky because there was one table open when we arrived. The total for two with two spring rolls and tax and tip was $26, and we're both stuffed. It's medium noise level, and can accommodate a child though it's a very tight fit for strollers. All the stars."}
{"text":"gotta drop them down a star. went last friday, and it was so disappointing. I went with the pho, and it was all off. meat wasn't lean, and was mostly fat, and then there was very little noodles. I come here twice a month, and this was the first time I was very disappointed. If this becomes the new standard, i won't be back."}
{"text":"Must try their great \"pho\" and \"banh cuon\". \"Pho\" has a very nice broth, tender meat, soft noodle. \"Banh cuon\" has soft rice noodle flat and delicious filling. The \"pho bo kho\" is a bit oily but the meat is tender and the taste still nice."}
{"text":"Pretty good banh cuon. Pho ga was tasty. Also tried the banh beo.  All served promptly and delicious."}
{"text":"I go there every week or so now, it is the best Pho I've ever had. It's not a fancy place, but has all the goods: great food, efficient staff and service, and short wait time. Deliciously addictive! 
Go there Monday to Thursday to try out their Pho Bho Ko (spelling?), it is to die for!"}
{"text":"What the heck did I eat here? I'm drawing a blank on the viet name already, but it was S3 (special #3) which is only served on Monday-Thursday. 

It was a stew with spicy broth, roasted carrots and big pieces of stewed beef. Noodles were thick. Beef and broth were delicious, a bit fatty but that's what makes it tasty. I didn't like the noodles/broth ratio, way too many noodles and not enough broth! mmm broth

They also have \"Hue Style\" pho on Friday-Sunday only, which I'd like to try out. Good winter foodage!

Service OK, food brought out very quickly (YES!!!) and prices pretty cheapo."}

{"text":"Outstanding choice in a district of delicious Vietnamese food. I spotted the \"cash only\" sign (which I consider a good omen) and ducked in for lunch. WINNING ENSUED. The special beef pho -- swoon. How did they make this broth?? Accompianied by a huge plate of freshest basil and lime. The next day I went back again for lunch, tried a different spicier pho and more magic happened. The lunch crowd is wide-ranging from business people eating a solo lunch to seniors speaking Vietnamese, to families. Five stars can't wait to go back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Well I just bought food today and I'm really mad at them. I swear that never come back to this place again. They over charge me for everything. I ask for addition fish sauce and got charge for $3 for tiny plate. They charge me for $30 for 2 portion beef noodle. I just upset because the way the do business is not the same as couple years ago. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"In the world of reviews and opinion, I always consider it best to start with the bad and end with the good. Not too much bad to say about this place except that the seating arrangement is fairly cluttered. Past that, this is a great place to eat. The soup is very good. Broth is clear, tasty and consistent. The noodles are a constant al dente texture. The beef is thinly sliced and of great quality. Portions are a bit small, but the ability makes up for it. The flour rolls are awesome, as are the spring rolls."}
{"text":"If you want to eat a nice bowl of Vietnamese Pho around downtown area, this is a place to go. They are pretty pricey compared to the other Vietnamese pho restaurants (their size XL bowl of Pho is only as big as size M or L at other restaurants), but the taste is better than those places in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"It is not the same as the original Pho Linh on College Street, the taste is only somewhat similar. The waitress is quite rude, she forgot to serve us the vegetables (one of the very important parts of Pho) for our orders, then she got angry at us when we kindly asked for our vegetables. I would not go back."}
{"text":"I'll be straight with it: this place is really good.

I had the large pho dac biet (house special pho - like I always do) and goi cuon (shrimp salad roll).  The pho broth was a tad on the lighter side but very flavourful and the noodles are the smooth, 'fresh' type -- I'm used to the 'chewier', 'chalky' standard noodles -- but this was still very good.  The goi cuon is one of the better ones I've had.  And as expected, it was really cheap and the portions were big.

They had some interesting specials on the board and I was pleasantly surprised they offered bun bo hue on the weekends.  But I went with my standard litmus test and I was there on a weekday.  Will be back to try this BBH -- that will really make or break the place for me.  But for now, a solid pho broth good enough for 4-stars."}
{"text":"Almost as good as my mom's pho... but since you may not have a Vietnamese mother who knows how to make pho, this is your best bet in Toronto. The pho is delicately seasoned and the noodles are soft. If you like it spiced, try their Bun Bo Hue (#11). Their Banh Coung Cha Lua (#12) is also a must try! If you like Vietnamese desserts, try the Suong Sua Hot Lua (#78) which you can't get anywhere else."}
{"text":"Have been doing take out since few months coz this place is not baby friendly ( space wise) but the food always up to our standard. We have tried other vietnamese restaurant and we always come back to this one. Usually we order chicken noodle soup and the minced pork with pork chop grill."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, friendly staff and great customer service very pleasing. 
the Pho was really good
Great price, cheaper then the other places."}
{"text":"Continuing my quest to find a good pho place to quench my thirst for home food. A hearty bowl of pho, no matter the weather, is always welcomed. This little place is not on any top list i have googled (though i tried one in those lists and not very impressed). Pho here has a richer broth, more depth in flavour (please note this reads mire salty than other places). I ordered a large special and the portion is pretty good for me. One minus point (hence the 4 stars) is the thick pho noodle. Pho noodle has to be thin and smooth. Other than that, this place serves a good bowl of pho. Do i like it? Yes. Will i come back? Yeah i will."}
{"text":"I've been coming here ever since I was a kid so this review is 15+ years in the making.
When I want a clear, light and clean tasting broth Pho, this is the go-to. Bonus: they use fresh noodles (most of the time) rather than the dried rice noodles. They don't skimp on the meats or the side veggies and herbs either.
Other than the Pho I love their Bun Rieu and a selling point is they serve it with the traditional topping of shredded banana blossom which is pretty rare! I will say for this particular dish I've seen the economic effects. They used to serve it with several chunks of pork hock and a nice crab claw but now you get it with maybe one or two trotters, and the claw is reserved for their Banh Canh. Nonetheless the soup is still good as ever and I'll keep ordering it haha.
Lastly their Banh Yot/Cuon are great as well, never too starchy or thick. And their Iced Coffee is strong and dense! Love this place to death."}
{"text":"Bun bo Hue and Banh Cuon / banh uot is the best I've eaten in GTA . Must Try !!!"}
{"text":"We drove a long way here for brunch at around 12pm craving \"banh cuon\". However, it was to our disappointment that they completely ran out! However, this is not the reason to the low rating as we got other dishes there. We got the following: 

- \"com tam suon nuong\" (broken rice with grilled pork)
      - very small portioned
      - overcooked and dry 
-  \"bun bo hue\" (Hue style vermicelli in soup)
      - visually very unappealing (resembled vermicelli in pho broth) 
      - very little meat (there was only 1 piece of sausage!)
-  \"pho tai bo vien\" (pho with rare beef and beef balls)
      - beef was extremely chewy 
      - freezer burnt taste
      - broth was bland 
- \"banh beo\" (steamed rice cakes) and  \"banh cong\" (fried rice cakes with green beans)
      - extremely doughy texture

Service was below average as our waitress was occasionally snappish and had idle responses to our dessert orders."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Pho Linh for over 20 years now, and I can always rely on their great tasting pho among other favourites I have here. 

Service is quick. Sometimes during peak hours, we order take out, which is made promptly. 

Unfortunately it is cash only."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food!  Love the pho and the rice noodle with pork.  Hard to find that appetizer in other viet restaurants.  Can use a bit of reno, but when the food is good I guess who cares?"}
{"text":"Pretty average pho place. Broth was not as flavourful as others I've had before but the noodles were very nice. They are quite generous with the meat portions. Spring rolls were some of the best I've ever had. Very reasonable prices. Good service. I wouldn't go out of my way to return as I do have other favourite pho places in the city however if I was in the area I definitely would stop by!"}
{"text":"This use to be one of the best Pho restaurants in Toronto, though their quality has greatly diminished as time progressed. The food is only decent now. The food doesn't have the fresh rich taste anymore. Atmosphere is alright, typical Viet restaurant. Staff are also just alright. Nothing spectacular, nor good."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say the quality of this place has gone down hill . It used to be my one and only . I'm in search of a new place"}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service

I decided to try Pho Linh after seeing the photos on Yelp and wanting to try the Banh Canh Cua...but it's only available Monday to Thursday! Since I went on a Friday I was a little taken aback...but decided to order the small house special noodle soup, and vow to myself I will return for a second visit regardless of this visit.

The food came quite fast; about 4 minutes after I ordered. I liked the broth and the beef ingredients, but the noodles were a little overcooked and broke apart quite easily. They also use the slightly wider type of noodles, instead of the more narrow kinds you're used to in other Pho restaurants.

Service was excellent for a Vietnamese restaurant, and they actually said hello, thank you, and explained the fact they only had my original requested order from Mondays to Thursdays, and joked around with me saying I should come back on Monday.

Heh. I'll keep this place in mind for sure."}
{"text":"Best. Vietnamese. Food. That I've ever tried, anyway. 

Special pho. 
Pho Bo Kho.
Fried spring rolls. 
Avocado smoothie."}
{"text":"Used to eat here all the time when I lived in the neighborhood. The food is cheap, comes out quick and piping hot! It's a very tight space however, and there is always a line up during lunch and dinner on the weekends. They have weekend specials - the bun bo hue is really good. I never get the rice or vermicilli dishes but they look ok - I'd stick to the noodle soups."}
{"text":"As a Vietnamese born, I highly recommend this place, they cook it the Viet way so pretty accurate for the taste as well as the way of serving compare to other not-Vietnamese-chef restaurant but running Pho business.

Nothing much to say, here they warm up my 'homesick' issue and feels like home again 

Stop hesitating, start ordering a Large Rare Beef Pho, put away your fone and dig in.."}
{"text":"Simple Pho place in the area. 
Large portions and fresh for the hungry man.

Decor is nothing special and the place needs a renovation.

But the lineup is always there for this food. One of my favourite dishes is the chicken pho. Fresh rolls are also amazing.

Very reasonable for lunch costs usually under $10 per person.

This is a go-to spot in the Steeles and Keele area."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place. Got the regular pho the first time and the broth was clean but enough flavour. Their rice noodles always taste better because they use fresh noodles. So smooth and thick. Second time I was here I got the hot and spicy beef stew with rice noodles. Pretty much the best I've ever had. They also have one of the best prices. Cheaper than most places I've been to. 

P.S. $4 for an avocado shake"}
{"text":"I come here often because it's close to home, quick service and of course food taste great. The pho here is excellent, very flavourful and the broth is nice and clear (this is my usual dish) along with the rice role and spring rolls are a must here. So delicious and has authentic ingredients in them. Some say the size of the pho is smaller then other pho places but not by much. I always prefer quality over quantity; items in menu are standard pricing compare to other pho restaurants. Looking forward to trying there special spicy soup (bue Bo hue) only available on the weekends. Definitely recommend this place and will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Let me tell you, when it comes to Vietnamese food I'm quite judgmental.  Not only is it my culture's food, but I have been surrounded by viet mothers who secretly cook competitively against each another my whole entire life. When I go out to have Vietnamese food, I don't expect a lot, I just expect it to be quick and tasty enough that I wouldn't pause and re think whether or not I want to take another bite.  I've heard a few things about pho linh and their infamous homemade banh pho. After having their bowl of pho, I can see what the rage is all about.  The banh pho is great, it tasted fresh and had the right amount of chewiness and matched perfectly well with the savory sweet soup. I also ordered the banh beo, which consists of small steamed rice cakes topped with chopped dried shrimp, scallions, mung bean paste, crispy fried shallots and nuoc mam (fish sauce). The texture of the banh beo was flawless, it wasn't soft and nor was it powdery (I've actually had banh beo made like this and it was not pleasant), I figured that if the banh pho was made well that the banh beo would come to par. Definitely a great Vietnamese establishment!"}
{"text":"I came here for a late Sunday dinner date and I remember coming here a long time ago but clearly I had memory loss because I didn't remember it being so good! The servers greeted us right away and were kind to tell us to watch out with our coats and the furnace. 

Atmosphere: typical Vietnamese restaurant. Typical environment. It was very clean, comfortable. It was pretty busy for an extremely cold Sunday night. Perfect for pho!

Food: I heard their bun bo hue was delicious so I went with that. Usually it's spicy so I asked for less spicy and it was perfect! The broth was delicious. I wish they had the pigs blood with it but it was good nonetheless. My friend ordered pho and we shared an order of banh coun - pretty decent. $6.50 for a good amount to share with some sausage. 

Service: pretty good. Fast paced environment. Can't complain!

Overall I would definitely come back. I don't live that close but I am willing to trek to this location to have another bowl of bun bo hue"}
{"text":"Best Viet place around this neighborhood. Funny thing is for a Viet restaurant, their Pho isn't that great, but they make up for it in their rice dishes and the steam rolled pork with Viet sausages. Menu contain lots of pork dishes and some beef dishes, very little offering outside of these two meats 

Don't expect much service here and don't forget it's cash only"}
{"text":"great pho

great pho

and great pho

4/5 stars cause i havent eaten anything else beside pho here"}
{"text":"Edit: I learned that the broth used in the vegetarian pho isn't vegetarian. So it's actually a 'vegetable pho' and not vegetarian. Vegetarians beware!!"}
{"text":"This place was okay.. There main pho bowl was not that great (pho dac biet) the type of pho that they give you is thick ones and it sucks. XL size and you only get 5 piece of small meat like cmon man"}
{"text":"Just to the east of Keele & Steeles lies the second location of Pho Linh, a perfectly authentic and outstanding Pho joint.
The place is not fancy or modern thank goodness - I am tired of all these fake wood modern looking places with suspect authenticity - but the pho is perfectly made, aromatic and fragrant, authentic and delicious. The noodles is not packaged goods or old stock. They bring in their fresh noodle daily. The coriander is fresh and aromatic and when broken up to add to the broth smells of freshness. They have authentic style rice cakes and spring rolls which are like in Vietnam and different from what we consider spring rolls. 
They serve authentic Vietnamese coffee hot or cold with the condensed milk, filter and all.
As good as the pho broth and noodles are the owner/manager Tu is also a real caring man. He has been at it for a while so could easily had become the standard issue blase businessman, but instead actually cares and wants to be helpful. In this sense, he reminds one of the owner of Mot Na Son. He will personally take care of you, teach and hold your hand if you want your own Vietnamese cuisine guide! Otherwise, just hunch over the smell of true pho broth and enjoy. 
The restaurant is named after a relative who is famous older Vietnamese singer and performer."}
{"text":"Love love love this pho place! I've been to several different pho places, and I always end up coming here instead. I'm here usually Fridays - so I always get their Bun Bo Hue. Their regular pho is good too. I love all the servers there! Food comes quick, and always tastes amazing. 
Ps. I'm Vietnamese, so listen to my advice for a good pho place ;)."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with sisters. I got their \"banh uot cha lua\", sisters had rare beef pho and rice with pork chop and steamed egg. Food tasted not as good as my last visits. Service was fast. The only good thing was their egg pudding \" banh Flan\"."}
{"text":"Great Pho! Great Prices! Close to home and the portions are beyond fair! 
I prefer take-out to dine-in as I feel they give you more of the ingredients."}
{"text":"I won't say pho Linh is a cheap place for Pho since the size of bows are smaller compare to other place but with the same price.

The menu offers weekday and weekend specials including Bún Bò Hue (Spicy Beef noodle soup), Bánh Canh Cua ( Crab meat with Udon noodle soup), Bò Kho ( beef stew noodle soup). Though it's small, the place is clean and the service is fast. 
I always order Pho or Bun Bo Hue (my favourite Vietnamese noodle soup). The broth was clear and okay, not very tasty. So if you want to make it tastier, you know what to do: sriracha and hoisin sauce! The beef was nicely cut, and fresh. They didn't lump together like most Vietnamese restaurants do it. 

I tried their Bánh Canh Cua once. I, personally, didn't like it. It was good, but not like what I expected. Since I was born and raised in Vietnam, I have high expectation for Vietnamese food wherever I go. I understand it's hard to get the ingredients here, but their bánh canh cua is way too different than the right one. The broth was thicker than Pho's, and they use the noodle that is similar to Udon. Oh well, gotta agree that they are very generous. Despite the size of the bowl, their bánh canh cua came with three crab claws. *yummy*

Bún Bò Hue is my favourite noodle soup. Again, their soup and broth was okay but I have no complaints. When the weather gets cold, and I feel like soup when I'm at York, I don't mind at all busing there for some hot, almost-tasty soup. Don't try this soup when you're wearing a white top!!!

I heard that their bánh cun (stuffed pancake) is very good. That's what they're known for. The owner himself told me their bánh cun is homemade. However, I always end up ordering bánh bèo (steamed rice cake). They are topped with mashed green bean, shredded pork and shredded pork skins, and served with fish sauce. (Everything tastes good with fish sauce if you make it right)

Not authentic Vietnamese food I have to say, but overall it's not bad. The food and service was A-OK. But you are at YorkU and want to try something new (especially in the cold weather), come here and check it out! Take my words, it's WAY BETTER than student centre's or Yorklanes' food."}
{"text":"Service: friendly and nice, no complain. BONUS: we forgot our shopping bag in there restaurant when we left, and the waiter came out to find and ran to us to return our bag, THUMBS UP AND THANK YOU!

Food: we got the simple large rare beef pho and chicken pho. Both the beef and chicken stock tasted great on its own, not too salty, but not the best I've had. However, the price is UNBEATABLE! Super cheap and filling! Everything's under $10!

Overall: would definitely return when nearby and craving pho or just a casual lunch/dinner!

NOTE: sign at the entrance says CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"hold up! can i just say, of all the pho restaurants I have been to, who would of thought a small mini Pho linh would win my heart!

I was taken here by my fiance as it was highly recommended by him and his friends.
They had a special that night, and boy oh boy the flavor was amazing.

every dishes tasted like it had that mothers touch. super hearty, delicious and filled with the Vietnamese culture that you are looking for in every bowl of pho.

The restaurant was very small and cold, definitely not modern but the efforts were there. 
They definitely need to expand, but that's no problem because our food came out within a couple of minutes from ordering. It was the fastest service i have ever experienced. I would for sure go back, and I for sure would recommend it to the pho lovers out there."}
{"text":"Tied for some of the best Pho I've had in Toronto. We kept things simple and opted for the Pho with rare beef, beef brisket and beef balls, with an order of fresh rolls and fried spring rolls. The broth was rich, complex, and super aromatic. I wasn't feeling the sodium-spike I often do after Pho, and all the rolls were fresh, tasty and satisfying. I'm looking forward to working my way through the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Known as one of the best pho places in the GTA. Being Viet, my opinion counts and I say - it really is! Always packed, get here early."}
{"text":"Cheap! Pretty good pho. Really busy but two people can eat for 20$ tip and tax in. A bit underwhelming and the decor made me worry a bit about their dinesafe, but overall pretty tasty."}
{"text":"My one of my favourite place to go for bun cuon and pho bo kho!!! The bun coun here is by far the best in Toronto and I've been to many.  Unlike many other restos, there is a very generous amount of filling (ground pork and mushroom) in each roll and it's so flavourful! We also order the spring roll and bo kho (spicy stew beef) which wasn't spicy all. It had a very tasty broth that has been simmered with carrots and very very tender beef cubes. Just thinking about it makes it want to go back for another bowl tomorrow."}
{"text":"First off, I'm Vietnamese. It takes a lot to impress me. I have eaten at most, if not all Viet restaurants in the immediate downtown core and I would definitely say that this place is close to the top of the list. 

Why? It's simple. Food is just plain good. No gimmicks, no tricks. Just plain good. The menu is relatively small, and they are good at what they sell. A lot of of other pho places have endless menu options but half of the items are just plain horrible. 


Top Menu items:

1. Bun Bo Hue
2. Banh Cuon
3. Any Pho bowl
4. Any Vermicelli bowl 

Bun Bo Hue - basically heaven in a bowl. nice and spicy and they use a traditional pork broth. Lots of love in this dish. This is often my go to. 

Their pho broth is awesome. Not to salty, and extremely flavourful. I also love of this place because they give you FRESH noodles. You have to ask for it though. Everywhere else is generally pre-packaged noodles. They don't skimp out on the fresh basil, lime, and bean sprouts either.

If you haven't tried Banh Cuon before, do it. Probably the best in the city. Well- portioned with vietnamese sausage crispy fried scallions - delicious!


Downside: Cash-only and small menu. But who cares?"}
{"text":"Very authentic and yummy! My friend took us here for dinner upon our arrival from Buffalo. He knows I love all types of food and that one of the reasons I enjoy Toronto so much is because of the availability of good ethnic cuisine.

I had pho with beef and tendons while my friend had the bun vermicelli noodles. The broth was delicious of course. Really, I should learn to make pho because I like it do much. And they had avocado shake which I love. There isn't much on service as this is very much a bare bones type of place. You even write down your own orders. And it's cash only. But the food is very good and they don't rush you out. I'd recommend this and would go back again."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this place consistently for the last couple of months and  never really had a bad experience except the one time I found a dead fly in my salad. Anyways, I let that go, but the last time I ordered 2 dishes, they literally gave me a tiny half sliced piece of chicken. Just as I was wondering where the other half went, I looked at my fiancés dish and notice the tiny piece of chicken that was missing on my dish, they gave to him! Horrible service!! I am never going there again. They just lost a customer."}
{"text":"Very cozy, small tables, narrow aisles restaurant.
But the food is authentic Vit Nam.
Best known for Bún bò Huê, very tasty and enjoyable once you can get use to the spicy heat of the broth.
Service staff is fast and sufficiently operates.
We come to this restaurant every time we in the area.

{"text":"Now Pho Linh is my go-to place for Vietnamese Banh Cuon. We have been to the one on College and this was our first to the Steeles location. 

The Steeles location is more spacious. Though the leather bench gas pretty beaten up look, but the place is pretty clean in general, including the washroom. 

We ordered #13 Banh Cuon (Vietnamese steam ground pork rice roll with shrimp cake), #11 Bun Bo Hue (Hue style beef noodle , #26 Com Tam Suon Nuong (grilled pork chop with minced rice), #23 Goi Cuon (pork and shrimp roll), #50 Ca Phe Su A Nong (filtered hot coffee with condensed milk). 

The service was very friendly and the staff confirmed me after if that was what I wanted to order. Thanks for his confirmation, I found I did misunderstand the dish and it was corrected. 

#13 - **4 stars** Vietnamese steam rice roll is signature dish here. I love the sauce they provide. It is lighter flavour sauce and won't over power the rice roll. The shrimp cake looked dry but indeed was soft. It was full of mung bean flavour. 

#11 - ** 3 stars** Hue style (spicy) beef noodles soup which is special recommendation and only available from Friday to Sunday. Hue style soup was full of flavours of many spices and I really enjoyed the soup. The round and bouncy noodles were used in which was authentic. It has not only slices of beef brisket, but also fish cake and pig knuckles. The only complains would be the meat (mainly was the brisket) was very chewy. Wish it was more tender. 

#26 - **3.5 stars** Com Tam Suon Nuong (grilled pork chop with minced rice). I love the aroma of the grilled pork. The side was harder but the meat from centre part was tender. The fish sauce has a stronger flavour. 

#23 - **3.5 stars** Goi Cuon (pork and shrimp roll) the portion was little small, but the ingredients were fresh and I liked the sauce that go with the roll. This place offer different sauce to different dish, not like other not authentic Vietnamese place would only give you the same fish sauce for everything. 

#50 - **4 stars** Ca Phe Su A Nong (filtered hot coffee with condensed milk). Part of the star go to staff who educated us how to make the Vietnamese coffee. The hot water from the bottle was supposed to pour in to the cup to dilute the coffee. By the time you finished your meal, the water in the filter would be done by then. Also I made a mistake to order the coffee without milk, and staff was very kind to provide us condensed milk afterward. 

Overall experience at this location was very pleasant.  By the way, I love the music from the kitchen. The modern Vietnamese songs are very nice."}
{"text":"We love this place so much we would consider moving if they changed locations, just to stay in their 'nabe. This Ma & Pa have cleaned up the interior a little since the greasy old days, but its still only a step above hole in the wall. The daily line ups of regular Asian families say it all. That and it was recommended to us by a Vietnamese foodie who swears their soup is as good as his Mom's. And my Laotian hubbie has given the cha gio (deep fried spring rolls) the \"ALMOST as good as my Mom's\" rating, which is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Great and prompt service. If you haven't been before you must try the daily special. The spicy soup was out of this world."}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by the appearance of this place. Its one of the best Pho places I've tried in Toronto. Definitely worthwhile to try their weekday and weekends special. They also have a wide variety Hue style vietnamese food.

Although I find that the beef that they used were quite fatty, the speed of things that came after ordering was pretty fast. Bonus points for an impatient person like me! The weekday special beef stew is a must try as the broth is flavourful, deep and rich. Almost reminds me of an Ox Tail base soup.

The Hue style rice cakes are also a must not miss dish. Its not often every Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto has this dish and does it well. This place is so affordable, fast and food is good. On weekends, the place gets fairly packed. A great place for its delicious, cheap and amazing Vienamese food."}
{"text":"3.5* 
The greatest bonus about Pho Linh appears to be the large variety of modestly priced desserts and shakes available on the menu. In fact, one might argue that there is much greater variety offered in this category than for the main courses. The buzz of the blender being used mainly for the popular passion fruit smoothie was a bit of a bother on a hungover Sunday afternoon, but the restaurant is otherwise very clean and pleasant.

The variety of delicious rolls are a good value at $2 a piece. As for the Pho itself, they have several items with meatballs in it. I would navigate away from these and stick to the typical pho tai, or the Pho Linh variety that also includes pieces of chicken! The broth at Linh is quite thick and delicious, though the beef happens to be a bit thick and overcooked compared to what I'm used to. 

The final note is that the non-pho dishes show a very heavy bias towards pork, in sausage, shredded, or other formats. Aside from a few items with fried chicken, there is not much to choose in terms poultry or seafood based main courses. 

Overall a great pho spot that is a bit off the beaten path, and offers good value for the items they specialize in."}
{"text":"4 and 1/2. perfect pho soup and with spicy combination on week days. The best ever fried spring roll in my life ever!!! service is quick and effective. a very very good place!! (menu is quite short, and so for once, one is not lost among the different options!!)."}
{"text":"I really liked my pho here. The broth was very hot and full of flavour. Prices were about the going rate in Toronto (which is very cheap). The spring rolls were a little on the tiny side and just a tad burnt, but still tasty. I think we originally were planning to go elsewhere in the area but the other place was closed. Lucky us!"}
{"text":"Pho Linh is a family owned restaurant and a staple Vietnamese restaurant in the neighbourhood which my boyfriend grew up eating. We came here for breakfast (so Asian of us, I know but you can never go wrong with a bowl of pho no matter what time of the day it is). We both got a bowl of pho and their infamous bahn cuon to share. Even though they just opened, everything was top notch. The food came out quickly and was piping hot. Love the soup here, and they don't skimp on the meats! The bahn cuon was so fresh and delicious; perfectly rolled. Owners are so friendly. Despite the bland exterior of the restaurant, this gem is worth visiting again and again."}
{"text":"Heard of this place but never been before though I wish I had gone sooner! The food was really good. The noodles are thicker than what I like but it's all preference. The broth was tasty and clean - not fatty at all. What I loved is that they did not skimp out on the meat. They were nicely cut, good quality meat and I had more than enough in my small bowl. 

They have noodle specials as well besides your typical pho. I didn't get to try it this time around but my friend did and it looked and smelled amazing. The bun rieu came with three crab claws so you know they aren't skipping out on quality here. 

I can see why the bahn cuon is what they're known for. These rice rolls were so soft with such flavourful fillings. 

Food came out super quick but nothing tasted sloppy. Friendly service as well."}
{"text":"I had lunch here on a few occasions...

Had item #3 (Rare Beef, brisket rice noodle soup), it was not bad.  There maybe better beef soup out there but I am quite OK with this quality.  Beef brisket was tasty.

Also had #40 (Grilled pork & spring roll with vermicelli), it was yummy!! The meat was grilled perfectly with some fat on it (i like it), spring roll was tasty too.  

Staff are friendly and nice.
I will return."}
{"text":"If u are vietnamese, and if u love vietnamese food, I really recommend this restaurant. Some food I found this restaurant makes them very good and I didn't find yet in others restaurant. 
I love the stuffed rice pancake here \" bánh cun ch \". It is served with fish sauce kind of sweet, add more green pepper if u like spicy. I got full with size M, for girl. 
My friend tried vermicle with toased beef and she really loved it. 
Fresh sping roll 2$ for each one, not too expensive and very fresh like its name lol. 
Serve very quickly, no need to wait too much."}
{"text":"Amazing pho - the rare beef was perfection and the spring rolls are awesome (get the hot not the cold) you can't do better in this city for the dollar - the place is always packed. We will absolutely be back!!"}
{"text":"First time coming to pho linh and it was awesome. They had this minced pork rice roll dish with Vietnamese sausages that most pho places don't have. Super addicted to it! Their pho was also good biggest test is the thirst test and they passed. I didn't feel the urge to drink 5 glasses of water the next morning.  The restaurant is family style and it seats a comfortable number of people."}
{"text":"Drove in from NY just for some Bun Bo Hue. The last place that tasted the best for me was in DC. This isn't the same but came close- definitely better than NYC in Chinatown. Great variety in the bowl.

And staff was really nice! Maybe I'll come back!! 

Overall, it was worth the few hours and traffic!

{"text":"Pho Linh in hands down the best Pho restaurant in the city.  

On weekdays (Monday - Thursday) they have the Pho Bo Koh, its a beef noodle stew cooked to perfection...a must try.  

For those who haven't been to Pho Linh, I would suggest any of the Pho noodles, the broth is cooked to perfection each time with a variety of fresh basil, mint leaves, bean sprouts and lime.  The spring rolls and vermicelli roll is a favourite as well."}
{"text":"I love the soup base! And their meat ball. It's so different from the other places and it's more savoury.

The pho noodle is ok but I like the one at queen and ossington more. Will come again tho! Thanks pho linh!"}
{"text":"I find a hearty bowl of pho to be an excellent option for a quick, nutritious and relatively economical lunch. Although lately I have been paying more in dry cleaning to get pho-related stains off my shirts. I have circumvented this problem by keeping a dedicated pho eating shirt in the car in case of unexpected pho cravings! 

The fact that Pho Linh is always packed with a strong Vietnamese contingent tells me their food is pretty authentic. The thing that impressed me most with Pho Linh was the super cleanliness and the speedy service. Last time I was there, I wrote down my order and went to wash my hands. When I got back, my bowl was waiting for me on the table. 

I think Pho Linh is an odd location for some decent pho or banh chung. Having been to a few Vietnamese joints in the city, I can say with some confidence that it ranks pretty high in my list of favourites.

{"text":"Was starving, cruising for the best pho, checking out reviews at the same time, was deterred by two other restaurants with hardly and reviews and rated below 3 stars.

Finally approached this location did a quick U-turn after seeing the rating and ordered my standard rare beef and beef ball with spring roll.

Pho was up to par, nothing really to mentionable, but the Spring Roll was exquisite with all the right texture and flavour.

Great experience would definitely come again. A+"}
{"text":"I don't understand the good reviews! The pho broth was very disappointing. It lacked in flavor, and it was very light in colour. The table next to ours also complained about the broth/colour, and were very unhappy with their pho, too. They didn't even finish their pho. The #1 pho special was missing some ingredients and the bun bo hue was one of the worst I've tasted. It was missing some ingredients and lacked in flavour, as well. Overall, the food was terrible, and we will not return. 2 stars for service only."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food here is delicious and authentic. Fantastic taste experience. The rest however is what you'd expect from an Asian hole-in-the-wall kind of place. In short, get in and out, but definitely get in because if you really like Phó, the flavours are fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is where everyone in my family has been going for Vietnamese food outside of home. I have been eating at this restaurant for 10+ years, personally my favourite by far. If you plan a visit Fri-Sun highly recommend #11 Bun Bo Hue (spicy)"}
{"text":"I tried bún bò hu for the first time here and my life is forever changed. I daydreamed about it for days after, which led me to try a pho place closer to me (Ginger on Yonge) which was awful. I must return to my first love at Pho Linh. It's worth the trip.

The price was super low, portion was huge, and tray of add-ins (herbs, cabbage, hot peppers, sprouts, etc.) was plentiful. And, complimentary green tea!

The restaurant is nothing to look at and a bit cramped when it's packed, but I don't mind. I appreciated that no one gave me side eye for my first-time pho eating attempt."}
{"text":"I have to say Pho Linh's bánh cun (rice roll) is the best I have eaten for years!! Sorry, Dad... even yours were not as good!

Bánh cun is not easy to find up in Scarborough or Markham.. even if they have that on the menu, it would be something they offers only on the weekend.

I ordered a LARGE with minced pork and mushroom ($6.50).. and ate it all by myself... and have no regrets... and I want to come back for more!! I love how they were all rolled up in small bite size and I can just dipped them in the fish sauce and eat those in one bite!

The Spring rolls ($1.50) was A-OK too...stuffed with yam and came with a big leaf lettuce for me to wrap it in... 

Pho Linh is as authentic Vietnamese as one expected...and I need to be back for the bánh cun or even to try out their bánh bèo!!"}
{"text":"This is newest location of Pho Linh is the closest location for me to get my banh cun (rice roll) fix! 

It replaced the old Pho VT with a complete makeover. More simple white and bright decoration and just feel a lot cleaner.

Minced Pork and Mushroom with Sausage XL ($7.50) are so fresh and good. Luckily I was not eating alone, so I got to try their Pho too... XL ($8.00) has a really nice, fragrant and complex broth. Meat are of good quality and the fresh noodle are not overcooked!

So next time when I am back, should I order the Rice Roll? or Pho? or try something else on the menu? That's going to be a big decision for me! :)

Btw, I think I will stick with my banh cun, because I was upset when my friend start eating them... I want to have them all to myself!!

They accepts all credit cards!"}
{"text":"Always a great place for pho and some traditional Vietnamese dishes. Better than most places in Chinatown (Broadview and Spadina). The service is quick and efficient and the food is always hot and fresh. There's usually people waiting at the door for a seat so it's not as friendly for huge groups as they only have 15ish tables. 

If you like banh cuon, Pho Linh is one of the best. Rolls are tight with a thicker rice wrap than other places and always loaded with fresh herbs and bean sprouts. Their rice dishes are delicious but there's usually not enough rice for me. 

Whenever I'm on the west end and craving some Vietnamese food, Pho Linh is usually my go to."}
{"text":"The Bun Bo Hue is mouth watering delicious. It's a weekend special only that has just enough spice level to keep you sweating but can still enjoy."}
{"text":"This is officially my favourite Pho place in Toronto! To the point where it's so far from my home, work, everything, but I will find any excuse to come back!!

Their noodles bathe in a deep, savoury broth that isn't overly salty or oily. Noodles are the perfect balance of chewy and soft, and while the meat is mediocre, I can easily forget about that as I'm busy chugging down that delicious soup!

We also tried their rice with grilled pork chop and chicken steak. The pork was much better than the chicken, but we still cleaned off the plate to every last grain of rice.

Their iced coffee with condensed milk is also amazing! Deep rich Vietnamese coffee flavour with just the perfect touch of sweetness.

I would come back again and again and again!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's no frills - cash only, no vegetarian options (which is why I gave it 4 stars)- but the food is consistently good, and the portions are huge.  

We come here a couple of times per week, and the staff are always very friendly to my boyfriend and I, and are really patient when we have our special needs nephew with us (he can be a handfull).

The pho broth is delicious; the spicing is subtle but perfectly done. Our favourite dishes are the pho tai sach (rare beef and tripe - it converted me to a tripe lover!) or the grilled beef bun. The bun is one of the best I've ever had - a delightful combination of textures and tastes, it includes your choice of protein, cucumber, mint, lettuce, roasted peanuts, as well as a really tasty Nuoc Cham sauce with slices of pickled carrot and daikon. The Nuoc Cham seems to be the Northern Vietnam variety - less garlicy and spicy than its southern counterpart. I like the grilled beef - it's slightly sweet and smoky, which I prefer to the shredded beef style (which always reminds me of catfood, so I never order it).

This place is not vegetarian friendly, you've been warned! But if you're looking for a family friendly place with amazing food, you've found it."}
{"text":"Pho Linh is a veteran in the neighborhood. I tired the original special rare beef pho, pho dac biet. 

It is respectable. With that being said, I have had better. It was definitely not worth walking for 15 minutes in -7 degrees Celsius weather. The broth was slightly watered down. Price is reasonable ($7, small). Service was quick. Good option in the area if you are in a hurry. 

I would revisit Pho Linh to try their famous Banh Cuon and Banh Beo bi tom say!"}
{"text":"There is a reason it has a very busy lunch and weekend crowd- it's a reliably good, hearty, reasonably priced restaurant with no frills and good tasting. 

Cash only can be a bit inconvenient at times,  but it is clearly posted when you enter so there is no surprise. 

The pho is huge and the rice dishes are also good when flavoured to one's raste with the gambit of spices and sauces provided."}
{"text":"i love this place. the servers are really polite and they spoke english! the service is top notch i think, which is just the icing on the cake here. the food is really solid. the SO and i probably come here on a monthly basis, and it's out go to viet place. the broth here is so delicious. i normally add all the fixins at the table,  hot sauce and hoisin to my broth, but here i can add the basil/mint, and a chili pepper and i'm good to go. it's a very clean tasting, complex broth. the drinks here are also very good: avacado shake is really good. we also get #12, which is a dish that i just started to eat since i discovered this place, despite me eating viet food for most of my life.  i'm so happy other yelpers have pointed it out. my SO gets the vermacelli and he likes it a lot, they had no issues subbing out the pork for chicken either. deep fried spring rolls are pretty good, but not my absolute favorite, they arrive at the table a bit too burnt and greasy for me, but they still taste good."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic viet food.
We love Banh Cuon (steamed rice rolls with ground pork), Bun Bo Hue (spicy noodle soup) which is only available on weekend, Pho Bo Kho (tomatoes beef stew with fresh noodles) & Bun rieu (crab tomatoes thin noodle soup with shrimp paste) which are weekday specials.
Best Viet food in the GTA. It used to be cheaper but they keep raising the price due to the demands"}
{"text":"Good pho and fast service. Never fails to satisfy my pho cravings."}
{"text":"Today I took it upon myself to try out this pho place as I've been to about 10 different places around Toronto. First off, don't come here with any vegetarians, as they have little to no selection for veggie pho. At most pho places I order the Rare beef / beef ball rice noodle. It came very quick and I was so impressed with the noodle to meet ratio. I've been severely let down by most places around Toronto for this reason. Too much broth not enough good stuff. 

The broth was delicious right to the end and the amount of meat was amazing. I'd say this is one of the better if not best pho places in Toronto. However two things threw me off (hence the not so perfect score) - There was not a mini dish to fill a little rooster sauce mix to dip the meat into, so I used one of the spoons. There was a fruit fly in the ice cold tea (since it's hot out now). Kinda a bummer, but the delicious pho stands true."}
{"text":"I m quite disappointed with my crabmeat udon. It was quite bland. The tapioca noodle had several different texture to them. Some were done nicely while others were under so they were a bit chewy. 

My friend's Banh Cuon was uber delicious. 

I was really looking forward to eating here. 

I will be back to have their Banh Cuon and maybe try their pho but the udon was definitely a bust.

Service was efficient."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for banh cuon.  I haven't had a better one yet.  Service is quick and ambience is a typical
Pho restaurant."}
{"text":"Though it was busy, we got there just in time to score a pair of seats.  The high turnover in customers meant we would have waited only a short while but who wants to wait when your hungry!
There were two Pho places within spitting distance from each other.  The Phoenix was empty but Pho Lihn was packed.  Always go where the crowd goes - they must know something and with high turn over means fresh food...I hope!
This has got to be one of the best Pho I've had.  The broth wasn't the MSG laden mixture that is sweet and salty at once and dries you up from the inside out.  The spring roll was pretty good but the cold roll left something to be desired.
One note, the place kind of smelled and the cleanliness comes into question.  I did my best to sanitize my utensils before eating.  Oh well, with that many people eating there, I guess it was worth the risk!
The service is brisk and efficient and we had a good night."}
{"text":"When it comes to Pho I am extremely picky and down to the type of noodles used. The broth is definitely a no brainer; and Pho Linh isnt your average MSG bowl of noodles with some meat on top. In the western side of Toronto the competition of Pho is very high Pho Linh definitely stands out from the crowd. From the moment you step in the authenticity just overwhelms you. The broth here let me tell you is definitely one of a kind. There are two things that make a Pho place good; its Pho and its Rice. Pho Linh has both of these down pat. 

Pho
Broth: no msg and fully flavored 
Noodles: thin and great texture not your average they use a special type of noodles.
Specialty: spicy beef Pho - if you like spicy it is definitely worth a try.

Rice - The Pork Chop 3 Egg Rice is always a staple at any Pho restaurant and Pho Linh does not disappoint one bit. The rice is also special and not your average rice the egg cake is soft and flavorful and the pork chop just oozes with flavor. 

The only downside is that Pho Linh closes quite early so its better to get there early because there is limited parking in this plaza and there is usually a wait at the door."}
{"text":"This is going to be my new go to place for Pho. In the past I was going to Pho Hung, which seems to be getting worse, I guess due to the large numbers of people being feed. 

This place is excellent, and very small, it has smaller portion sizes then most Vietnamese places, but the soup it self is so good, that having a cavernous amount of soup is not important. The Vietnamese spring rolls are good, although a bit doughy. I will be back to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"I've tried almost every pho in the city. From the MSG laced soups Scarborough and markham to the late night hang over cures in china town. This place is my favourite. Clean, clear flavorful soup, fresh, soft noodles, this is the best pho. The bun bo hue served on weekends only is also a treat"}
{"text":"AMAZING. Went here for the first time with a friend and I was quite blown away with the broth and the noodles. 

The noodles were cooked to perfection and were not soggy nor too bouncy - just right. The broth even without any of the fixens was amazing. I got the old reliable pho dac biet. I usually love my pho with lots of lime and mint, but I can say that I would have still enjoyed it without them. The various meats in the broth were also very tender and just added more to the broth's already great taste. This place is tucked away in a little corner. Be sure to try this pho out! Very good stuff.

There is usually free street parking around the corner during the night."}
