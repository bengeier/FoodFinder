{"text":"I really want to like this place, but they make it pretty difficult.  I had the Monday special - chicken or vegetable curry with rice or Naan.  I chose chicken and rice.  What  I got was a bowl of rather gelatinous curry sauce with FOUR chunks of chicken.  And not just any chicken - all dark meat, fatty, sinewy, slimy and loaded with gristle chicken...yuck.  I was told that curry chicken was always made with dark meat - yeah ok.  It really makes me wonder how they think they will build on their clientele serving this garbage.  Won't be back"}
{"text":"I like the idea of a \"fast food\" Indian restaurant, but I this one is a bit pricey for what you get.  I ordered the biryani the first time, and that was a good size.  Last time I had 3 bits of chicken in the curry.  Would rather take-out from my favourite restaurant for these prices."}
{"text":"I have tried the butter chicken, biryani and samosas so far. All tasted very good.  The biryani is far from being authentic, but nevertheless tastes good. Highly recommend the chicken samosas. Bought these a few times during Ramadan."}
{"text":"Small place but amazing tikkas. Try the tikka burrito for sure. The lasuni tikka was also amazing. Perfect for take away and last minute eat out option. The only downside is that they close by 8:30-9:00 pm."}
{"text":"I always passed by this place when I go grocery shopping. I decided to try it today and was disappointed.  The food quality is so-so, quantity small, and prices way up there. This is mainly a takeout joint, but the prices are equivalent or above a sit-in restaurant.  I tried the chicken samosas - small, but good. The Chicken Tikka was moist, and \"ok\". The lamb biryani had only a couple of pieces of meat and the rice was soggy, on the verge of being in a puddle of water.  Probably won't go again."}
