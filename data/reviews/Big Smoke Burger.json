{"text":"Burger week  1. Blazing Pineapple Burger ($5) - Decent burger. Good size patty and bun. Only special addition was a grilled slice of pineapple which did add a nice touch to it. The sauce was spicy and can definitely feel the kick after every bite.   Overall: Not bad for a quick bite but wouldn't go out of the way to get it."}
{"text":"Never had better burgers before! My wife and I were looking for a place to have some dinner in Toronto's Fashion District. Going to Big Smoke Burger was the best decision we could ever make. I had the Big Smoke Burger which was simply awesome side by side with some very big and good tasting fried onion rings. My wife had the Chicken Burger with french fries. It was so delicious and the sauce was so tasty. We will definitely come back next time we are in Toronto."}
{"text":"I use to visit the original Kraft Burger, which was the name before they Franchised.. and I have to say since they Franchised it's totally lost all it's quality charm and warmth.. the burger's use to be hand made, and un-pasteurized meat. Because they knew who was cooking the burgers.. now they come Pre-fabbed frozen pasteurized..so when the 17 year old food prep person doesn't cook it properly you won't get sick.. So after Kraft burger..AKA Big Smoke. franchised the original staff disappeared and random kid's appeared and they ALWAYS screwed up my order and the patty just never the same.. nor the ambiance it was just gone.. I will miss a good flame grilled burger.. sometimes Franchise isn't the best route..I haven't had a burger from Big Smoke in over 2 years and I use to go there at least once every month..It's sad really since it was such a great burger and a wonderful place.."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST EVER. If you are ever hungry and your at crossiron just go here. It's honestly so good. I must say that it is pricey as it cost me $11 for a burger and $4 for fries and drink but it was totally worth it. I had the beast burger and though it seemed really small, it's really filling. They said that they cooked burgers medium rare but I took well done and before they gave it to me I heard them check twice that it was well done patty.  The fires are so crispy and delicious. Best I ever had.   The service was incredibly nice and patient when I took forever to choose. I would definitely come back here to try some stuff like the poutine which was $8 and the ice cream sandwich  It's great and tasty just the price that gave this a 4 but it's 4.5. GO HERE"}
{"text":"Rip off. Not going there again. Very small portion and thy ask for extra money for each topping."}
{"text":"This place has fairly good burgers - certainly as good as any of the trendy new burger joint du jour that seem to be popping up in every neighbourhood lately. The real standout item here is the onion rings - probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Tasty burgers and a nice/cozy decor.   Wouldn't go out of my way to reach it but will pick it for fast food if in the area."}
{"text":"I still call it Craft Burger.  The quality at Big Smoke is top notch, you can tell the beef is never frozen and high quality stuff. My favourite burger is the Crazy burger, the banana peppers and jalapeno havarti mix perfectly with the sweet/smokey BBQ sauce and creamy crunch slaw on top. Yum. Last time I had it with a veggie patty and it was equally delicious - note when you ask for a veggie patty they'll switch your bun to WW unless you specify otherwise (Question: why do restaurants make this 'healthy' assumption with vegetarian options?)  Anyways second pick would be the Spicy Burger but it's missing the key ingredient of cheese. The caramelized onions however are divine and perfectly cooked.  Poutine gravy is so rich and I would put it up against any \"poutinerie\" in the city. Had the onion rings last time as well and they were perfectly crisp and sweet.   Finally to be completely overly indulgent I sometimes get a chocolate shake on the side. They are good but overpriced for a small portion. I'd get a Boylan's Root Beer instead if I were you."}
{"text":"Solid, quality food in a fast casual environment. Friendly service. Had the craftburger (garlic mayo, sauteed mushrooms) which had the just the right ratio of meat to bun.  Meat was well-done but that's the way I like it. Also had poutine, made with hand cut fries, a beef flavored dark gravy, and chopped(?) cheese curds.  As a novice poutine eater, I thought it was pretty good."}
{"text":"This is how burgers should be! I love them here! It gets really busy at lunchtime so it's best to go around 11:45 if you want to get there as it's small and the seats go fast. My order is onion rings, a chocolate milkshake and a burger with all the toppings...SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the price. Burgers are much smaller than expected, no choice of toppings, no substitutions in combos, and \"Frings\" only came with 4 onion rings. The fries and onion rings were rock hard, and I couldn't even finish them. The other reviews are right about the food and wait times.   Five Guys burgers are right around the corner if you want good burgers. Check out South St. Burgers too - seriously those burgers are amazing. They let you choose your toppings, give you suggestions on condiments, and they'll even let you substitute your fries with an amazing salad!"}
{"text":"Entirely terrible. Soft drinks in machine were flat both before and after being \"fixes\", service was horrible, only men were served at their tables while being referred to as \"sir\" while women were called by name to pick up their meals at the counter, and the burgers are horrible... Are they even real beef? Worst burger experience ever... Should have stayed in my neighbourhood and gone to South Street!"}
{"text":"Food: A- Service: A- Food presentation: A- Atmosphere: A- Prices: A- Recommended? Yes  Apparently Big Smoke Burger is the highest ranking burger joint in Toronto according to Yelp and since I have a pathological addiction to burgers, I dropped everything as soon as I heard about this place and headed over!  I ordered a burger with smoked cheddar cheese which came up to around $8 after taxes.  The burger arrived within 10 minutes and one bite into the burger and my addiction induced tremours started to subside. The burgers are 6oz and my burger was done to a perfect medium well and served on a fresh bun. Perfect grill marks on the outside and juicy on the inside. And the meat tasted fantastic. Of course the smoked cheddar cheese gave the burger a nice smoky flavour.   Tips: If you're driving you're probably going to miss this place as the sigange is not the best and poorly lit. Park your car as soon as you get close to Yonge and Bloor and go on the hunt on foot."}
{"text":"The burgers were mediocre, the toppings greasy, the fries were brown and overdone, the poutine was flavorless - all at a price point that didn't explain the lack of taste. $7.50 for a plain organic burger, a little less for a regular burger. On this Good Friday holiday we had to wait for seats. The napkins didn't come out of the dispenser. Skip this and go out of Eaton Centre for a different choice."}
{"text":"Jesus Christ that was a tasty burg. been there twice now, once with a few friends, and once with my mother, who was visiting from back home.   For some reason the 2nd time was even better than the first time. For the record, I got the Big Smoke burger with Chipotle Mayo instead of Horseradish Mayo.  You should too."}
{"text":"I have been to many big smokes around Canada. This is probably the 6th location I have visited. And out of all it's the worst. When I saw it was opening I was happy since it's so close to me. The restaurant itself is a nice clean restaurant with decent seating but that's where the good experience ends. The staff was unhappy and looked like they could care less to be there. The wait time was around 12 minutes which for a few burgers is crazy. The quality of the food was even worse. One of us ordered the chicken and it was extremely tough after a couple bites it became such a turn off they decided to stop eating. For me my burger was underdone and the unappealing. If your looking for a big smoke go to the one at Yorkdale mall way better experience and way better staff."}
{"text":"The long line-up and wait time belies the quality: burger was OK, at best. Some of these burger joints seem to rely on eccentric toppings, perhaps in an effort to cover up the shortcomings of the patty itself which, for me, is really all that counts. Flavourless and dry. And the fries were also a disappointment. Discolored and limp. What's a guy gotta do to get some CRISPY fries in this city? Holy cow."}
{"text":"a bit pricy. Or is it when its worth it? great meat, good burger, fesh ingredients I had a blue avocado cheeseburger medium rare, She had the chicken burger both were really good!  we also had a Poutine, fries with cheese and gravy, DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I decided to go to Big Smoke Burger for lunch recently. It's a gourmet burger joint where the food doesn't come cheap, but the experience does. I ordered the Spicy Chipotle Burger, fries, and a Pepsi. After 15 minutes of waiting my order was finally up. I took it to go.  Get back to the office and I take the burger out of the bag. It's big. I like big. I open the wrapper, and the brief level of excitement escaped me. The spicy chipotle burger came with a small thin layer of lettuce, one tiny slice of tomato, a limited portion of sauteed onion, and a bun drenched in chipotle sauce.   I ate the burger, it was very slipper since the sauce was between the lettuce and the tomato, and all I tasted was the sauce. It was disappointing. I paid 13 dollars for the entire meal. The fries weren't anything to brag about, but they were better than burger.   My coworker asked me what I thought. I told him never go there. I will never recommend this place to anyone. Just because you call yourself a gourmet burger joint and charge a premium price, does not mean it's premium quality.  Don't take my word for it. Try it for yourself, if you're willing to spend the dollars.   Never again."}
{"text":"Expensive but yummy. The burger patties are very juicy and tender."}
{"text":"The best burgers I've had in the city of Toronto. Gone back again and again, never disappointed."}
{"text":"You don't get what you pay for... very pricy! There's nothing special about the burgers we had the Jerk Chicken that tasted like just regular bland chicken. Fries and gravy were good probably salty for most but I didn't mind them. Will not go back again."}
{"text":"Decent joint. They say their burgers are hand crafted so if you're in a rush not an ideal place to go to. There's usually a 8-10 minute wait. I did notice they skimped on their toppings."}
{"text":"Been going here on the reg for awhile (how'm I not a lardass yet I don't know) because it's super close to me, and thank god.   It tastes like a well prepared deli sandy with burger instead of sandy meat, super fresh ingredients and I'm pretty sure they make the buns on site (at least tastes like they do).   burgers are top notch, I dig blackened meat so I ask for well done, good to see flame in the kitchen. poutine is also killer, highly suggest. I'm not including price in this review (because yes it's a bit pricey) but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Craft burger is perfect in every manner of the word... Since having it i have made it a mission to take all my friends to Craft burger and they have all loved it!  Juicy patty with a wide selection of toppings, craft burger is guaranteed to make you say \"WOW, that was one great burger\""}
{"text":"The burgers and fresh cut fries were outstanding.  The flavor was wonderful.  This is NOT fast food.  Well worth the wait and LOW COST  But the service was even bettter. The manager/owner went out of his way to explain other good restaurants in area."}
{"text":"Delicious. This place is dangerously close to work. I really need to lay off."}
{"text":"The good, the bad, the ugly - 2.5 stars.  The Good: The meat was juicy and not dry, the bun was soft and had a little bit of a chew to it, almost like a brioche bun.  The Bad, the look and the size reminded me of a Harvey's burger (except the patty is real meat).  The Ugly:  Like everyone else mentioned, the price is a little steep for an uneventful burger.  You want free peanuts while you wait, Five Guys is one block east of this location and the burgers taste very similar, and they're not cheap on filling your bag up with fries.  Talk about chinsing out on the toppings.  For a regular burger you have the option of ketchup, mustard, mayo, tomato, lettuce, onion and pickle.  Are you purposely copying Burger's Priest?  Any extra toppings you need to spend $1.50+ per item.  Common Big Smoke, lower the price of your burgers or offer complimentary toppings like your competitors i.e. South Street & Five Guys, their topping lists are triple the size.  How are you going to stay competitive if another burger franchise opens up next door?"}
{"text":"So I drove by this place a few times and decided to give it a try and I wish I hadn't.   So since I never been to a Big smoke Burger place before I told the girl behind the cash that never been there before and that I was looking for something like a double bacon cheese burger. She gave me a blank look the said we don't have that. After a pause she said well I can add cheese and bacon to a double big. I said ok to that and added Rings and a drink to make it a combo. Never did she ask about toppings or told me what came with it so I figured they would ask once the meat was ready. It was only after the lady behind me ordered and she notice them putting toppings on a bun and ask why she was not ask what she wanted on her burger I realised I was in the same boat. I asked the lady at the till about the toppings that came with it and another blank look followed by her turning around and grabbing a small flyer and read off what was on it. If a person does not know what is on a burger they are selling they should not be selling it.   As for the food itself it was really bad. The rings were burnt and tasted horrible. I ended up throwing them out.    As stated in other reviews the burgers patties are small compared to other places that press their own burgers. My burger was also very dry and the edges were on the borderline of being burnt as well. The bacon is to laugh at. It is shaved so thin that it has almost no flavor. (Till today I did not know you could shave a piece of meat that thin.)   The worst thing is I took it to go so I did not find out how bad my meal was till I was on the other side of town.   The total for my meal was $20.34 (double big 9.50 add cheddar 1.75 add bacon 1.75 combo rings 5.00 + tax 2.34)  Way too much money for what you get even if it was cooked right. I don't mind paying for quality but that for sure was not the case here.     There are many great places in T.O to get a handcrafted burger sadly this isn't one of them. Needless to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been going here since it was Craft Burger and before calling something \"craft\" was irritating.  Just a good solid lunch burger. Nothing gigantic or overdone. Good fresh tasting toppings, cooked to order, and beef that tastes, well, like beef!  Fries are good. I dont know what to say, its just a consistently tasty product and my staple work-hours burger.  I kind of see Big Smoke and Burger's Priest as the competing toronto chains for the lunch crowd. I prefer Big Smoke to priest for a couple reasons - faster service, not as pretentious, not nearly as greasy, cleaner. And I dont care about napkins."}
{"text":"I tend to visit this location every once in a while.  Generally speaking the service is decent and the food is pretty good.  If yer a veggie I highly recommend the veggie burger along with some onion rings.  The veggie burger is a really tasty soy based burger. Many a meat eater has been surprised by the presentation of said veggie burger.  My only complaint is that Craft Burger feels a little expensive for what it is.  A normal burger, fries, and drink is over $10 (maybe even as high as $12) and it just doesn't feel like a great value.  I don't mind a visit every once and a while, but Craft Burger will never be my regular burger joint..."}
{"text":"The burgers were delicious. We ate the Big Smoke burgers. Carmelized onions, cheddar cheese and horseradish mayo with tomato on a lettuce wrap. My complaint is the fries and onion rings. Way too greasy! Not like the last time I went to this location a month or so ago. My guess is the store staff have not changed the fat in the fryer, or strained it, properly. Extremely disappointing! Therefore one star is the rating. The management of the store needs to pay closer attention to quality control or the business will suffer. If the management would apologize for the error and promise to address the poor quality, I will adjust this review and rating."}
{"text":"Took away a star as they don't do sweet potato fries :-P  Aside from this - I am a huge Big Smoke fan.  The burgers are always beautifully cooked - make sure to ask if you want it well done though.  The fries are delicious and the poutine is to die for - amazing value too.    The staff are friendly and the service consistent."}
{"text":"Big Smoke Burger is located in the recently remodeled Yorkdale Mall food court. My initial food court impression was positive. The food court has a modern IKEA style edge that makes the typical fast food chains appear to be upscale. The restrooms are also remodeled and there is even a small outdoor balcony; but the view is the mall roof and the seating is limited.  Anyway, let's get back on topic.   The food court has lots of choices, but I was in the mood for a burger, so I decided to try Big Smoke Burger.  To be brief, I was disappointed. I ordered the Big Smoke Burger with onion rings and a diet coke. The total bill was ~$12.50. I felt the price was high for a burger and onion rings that were average at best.   Average food and above average prices means that I won't be revisiting this place unless they have a BOGO."}
{"text":"This is my favourite burger joint downtown and my partner and I have been regulars for a few years now.   We always order the Crazy Burger and the Blue Burger (they're so good there has never been a reason to change it up) and in the countless number of times we've eaten here we've never had a bad experience. The meals are always consistent.   Actually - funny story - we've never shared bites our burgers with one another because we take it so seriously and we've always been so focused on eating. However, recently, for whatever reason, I decided to have a bite of my boyfriend's Blue Burger and I was FLOORED. Holy cow the creamy gorgonzola cheese and avocado combination made me want to hug the cooks who put it together. My mind was blown.  Because of the recent changes to the restaurant (including a couple menu changes) I decided to try the new Jerk Chicken sandwich. Even though my burgers have always been incredible, my hopes weren't too high for the jerk chicken since the place doesn't really scream Caribbean vibe to me. And I was right. Jerk chicken is one of my favourite meals and this does't hit the mark with the right spices and was more on the bbq side than jerk. I'd stay clear of it if you're looking for something a little more authentic. In saying that, however, the chicken was perfectly cooked and did taste really good.   It takes about 10-15 minutes to get your meal because they're cooked right in front of you. The wait is not an issue once you start eating but if you're pressed for time you can call ahead and pick it up.  Fries are always excellent. Onion rings are heaven. Great location, great quality and great staff."}
{"text":"The service is always really wonderful and the burgers are the best in the area.  They are fresh and juicy and the fries are amazing."}
{"text":"New place, quite an exciting find in the gourmet fair at Sherway Gardens,   We just walked up to the Gourmet Fair and was pleasantly surprised with the new burger place.  We are quite used to eating at Hero Burger...but this place has many choices...  We chose the Pineapple grilled burger and the original Big smoke burger.  Of course my we added poutine and onion rings as our sides with the interesting Cream Sofa!   Oh... They also rocked with giving  you the choice of organic beef and how you like it - medium well or well... Which is a nice choice for foodie !   The burgers were scrumptious and the poutine was quite saucy (but not salty) with chunks of cheese curds.   The onion rings were crispy too.   Overall a great experience. The price is quite gourmet too.  For two burgers, onion ring or Poutine and two drinks, it was $37 so it is gourmet fair!   Of course, if you decide to eat non organic beef, it will be $31 . It is not fast food place if you want gourmet fair!"}
{"text":"Had the veggie burger with fries and a water.  Very filling and I love that char on the burger. FYI ask for your fries to go when dinning in a food court, you get more fries then for here in tiny bowl."}
{"text":"Took my wife to Square One for some shopping and after an hour or so we were both getting hungry so headed down to the food court area...I mentioned to her i wanted to try out the newly opened Big Smoke Burger and she was also up to trying it out..we ordered two cheeseburger combos.   You pretty much get to see your burger get grilled from a fresh meat patty and onto the grill while you are waiting..the focus here is using fresh products which was also reflected in the condiments that went onto the burger..our combo  also came with a nice helping of fries that were pretty tasty.  We really loved the smokey flavour of our cheese burgers along with the fresh bun - the combo is pretty filling with fries but both wife and i were able to finish our plates.  Overall, service was very good from cashier to picking up the food , and  price was good value for a premium burger - our 2 combos with two cokes came to around $ 24 and change.!   Will come back next time with our kids and try some different menu items."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Big Smoke Burger and definitely I only seem to be able to eat here when I'm extremely hungry. The burgers have a good mix of toppings, I think all the condiments work really well with the burgers, especially the choice of cheese, although the patties are consistently dry (it seems the only binder used is pressure and perhaps eggs).  The poutine however is delicious, albeit a bit salty for my tastes...but definitely worth the extra calories :)"}
{"text":"This is a staple \"Oh my god we have nothing to eat let's grab take away\" at our house. We know it's not \"healthy\" but it's damn good.   We generally go for the Lamb burger and the Organic Burger with Smoked Aged Cheddar (added topping). They are both hungry crushing good and I think the best burgers in the city.  When we feel extra hungry or indulgent we'll tack on a poutine to split between the two of us. I think it's the best poutine in the city. There was a point while I was pregnant where I was eating poutine like it was going out of style and I remember thinking this poutine was better than the Poutinerie so take that and stuff it in your cheese curds!  Whilst pregnant, I would indulge in the milkshakes sometimes too. Delish! Nice old fashion tasting.  All in all, a great burger joint!"}
{"text":"The only reason why big smoke deserves 4 stars is because of their poutine. Absolutely AMAZING & DELICIOUS. I used to go to south st. For their poutines but glad I stopped going there because big smokes' poutines are 10x better mainly for 2 reasons: 1. Bigger size and cheaper than south st. Their small at B.S is like eating a large at south street for a dollar less. Awesome! :) 2. They give you more cheese curds without having to ask. ( who doesn't love cheese :p)   As for their burgers... Well they are not the greatest. They taste like a boxed burger but with the price of a gourmet burger. Umm no thanks. I prefer south street.."}
{"text":"A great gourmet burger place through and through.  I ordered the Craft Blue - Bleu Cheese burgers are one of my favorites, and that one really delivered.  I paired it with a poutine, because hey, I'm an American and gravy and cheese curds on fries?  An unhealthy food we didn't invent?  While I was less impressed with the poutine than Dangerous Dan's (my only other point of reference), they didn't taste bad by any stretch of the imagination.  I envy those who can enjoy this place whenever they want.  A little expensive, though, so you probably can't enjoy it all the time."}
{"text":"Craft burger makes a good burger. Simple as that.  You can see them grinding up fresh beef in the back, so you know it`s fresh. They offer a fair variety of burgers, depending on your taste. The patties are nice and thick, always moist and sumptuous.  Their onion rings are exceptional as well, very thick and the batter is lovely.  They tend to get very busy, and it may take a little while to get your food, but that`s the sign of a good restaurant. I will not fault them for that."}
{"text":"My favourite place to get poutine. I love the way they do it. The dark gravy and cheese curds just go together so well with fries that actually look like they were once potatoes. I've had their burgers only a couple of times and went with the craft burger. My mouth is watering just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with my dad... Ol man was craving a good burger so we decided on Big Smokes !!  Both of us ordered Veggie burgers. I had a Veggie burger with extra Mayo, lettuce and tomato. Doesn't sound the greatest but even I didn't know why I ordered my burger that way. I had a side of Poutine with it to make a combo. My dad ordered his with everything on it and a side of fries.  The burgers were Delish !!!! I'm not a hardcore Vegetarian but I'll try a Veggie burger when I feel like it but out of all the big chain veggie burgers I've had, Big Smokes is probably the best one. The patty was nice and thick and the grill taste was great !! Coming back to my topping combo- it was a total pass !!! That's my new topping combination from now on !! Big Smokes I wanna marry your grill !!! See you sooooooonnnn !!!"}
{"text":"This whole chain is on the downhill.  I had burger there last week and let me tell you the next day was extremely unpleasant as I spent most of it in the washroom... I could feel my belly gurgling through the night. The burger was very pink and I didn't eat anything else that would be suspect that day.  I know a little pink in a burger is OK but this was obvioulsy not OK.  I didn't even ask for medium-rare like a previous poster.  That's just what I got.  I know I should have stopped at the first bite but I was just so hungry I thought I would just trust them and take the risk.  Since I had already gotten it home it would have been a hassle to go back and I really don't want to have to re-cook a burger I just paid for.  I can't say for certain it was the burger that led to my gastro-intestinal ummm... overtures... but it would be tough to attribute it to anything else.  Safety issues aside the burger wasn't even that tasty.  Fries and Onion rings were both just average.  If they are going to charge over $10 for a combo I expect NOT to get sick and for it to taste better than average.  I have eaten here several times in the past with no issues, in fact I really used to enjoy it.  Times have changed."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Just juicy, fresh and tasty burgers.  Fries made with real potatoes.  The place is tiny and usually crowded so don't expect to find a seat.  And be patient -- I was there recently and had to wait 15-minutes for my order.  Then again, fresh takes time."}
{"text":"First of all, let's get this out of the way... IT'S MY FIRST REVIEW. Mama will be so proud! (more like brother as he is a yelper as well...)  I was lucky enough to be taken out to lunch at Craft Burger not too long ago and while any free lunch is my favourite lunch, I particularly enjoying this freebie!  I was an intern when this lunch occurred, so anything over $3.00/meal seemed expensive to me, but the prices were decent. There were a lot of menu choices, veggie both as a burger and a side dish (not that I partook). I appreciate that burgers are 'handcrafted' and they use fresh Canadian ingredients.   I was a bit overwhelmed with my Craft Burger experience at first, it's was rather chaotic and the location is narrow and the order counter was confusing (to me anyway), but I prevailed. I was impressed with the quantity of toppings that come on a burger, of course I didn't get all the toppings as I'm a picky eater, but for fans of burgers piled high, Craft Burger is a treat! I ordered a Classic Burger (picky eater...) but I was impressed with the different types of burgers available.   The tables across from the counter (where I sat) have an awkward height discrepancy in seating. I was sitting on the chair, not the bench, and I felt about two feet shorter than my lunchmate.   The art on the wall was interesting.   I did not have to wait long at all for my burger to appear. It was delicious. As were the fries and onion rings. The soda was cold.  Overall it was an excellent meal! I have absolutely no complaints about the food, I was full and satisfied when I left. I still work in the area and expect I'll go again soon to try the poutine.  But I do have to give Craft Burger an awkwardness rating of about 2/5...narrow, crowded restaurant and mismatched seating arrangements...but they sure do craft a good burger! (I get it!!)"}
{"text":"Great burgers!  And an organic beef alternative is available at an extra cost.  Tasted the same as regular beef, but made me feel better eating it!"}
{"text":"I had the Crazy Burger. Ordered it med-well and it was burnt on one side and tasted terribly bitter from the char. Instead of throwing the burnt patty away, they hid as much of the charred side as they could with the cheese slice. Paid over $14 for a combo- over 4 dollars plus tax to add fries and a drink filled with as much ice as possible. Horrible experience and value. I'm happy to pay a premium for a quality burger meal, but the quality and value were both not present on my visit. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Mmmm. Gorgonzola and avocado on a burger. The perfect burger for a rainy day. Actually any day. Onion rings are better than the fries."}
{"text":"Dear Big Smoke Burger (or Craft Burger),  What's wrong with you? One of the first on the Toronto scene in terms of the explosion of burger bars, yet your product is lackluster and tasteless.   I made the mistake only once and visited for a bite. Ordered your organic burger & onion rings. I wasn't asked how I wanted my burger cooked, it came out charred and grey, sooo overcooked my neighbour's dog would ignore it. The meat was under-seasoned and pretty tasteless. Such a sad way to see beautiful organic beef served. The bun wasn't so fresh and my \"order\" of onion rings consisted for 4 rings, soggy from being fried in not-hot-enough oil. Not even ketchup could save the rings.   With sooooo many burger resto options in the city, you can't afford to serve subpar food. Because we are now frenemies for life. Did you hear that? FRENEMIES FOR LIFE.   Maybe you shouldn't have expanded so fast. Maybe your first location was as good as all my friends said it was. Maybe in the frenzy to expand, things got watered down, you hired a bunch of silly teenagers who didn't care about keeping up the food quality standards. Maybe it isn't your fault.   BUT no one can rectify it but you. Please do so.   Yours, Daniel"}
{"text":"Really slow service for fast food. Dirty trays and broken cups were used to serve guests with. I work in the mall and occasionally treat myself to a burger or poutine or both (lol) but yeah, been pretty disappointed with the service lately. What's up? New management?"}
{"text":"Worst burger I've ever had in Toronto. Dirty beverage cans. Soggy onion rings. Rude staff. Avoid."}
{"text":"Had it with the attitude ...there's poor customer service and then there's down right hostile. Tonight was the last straw. Nothing is worth the assault that passed for customer service when I placed a takeout order and waited for it to be ready. The restaurant was virtually empty, but somehow I got forgotten. Most shocking was instead of an apology I was treated with contempt. NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"The burgers taste just a the name states - Smokey. Some may enjoy this but I found it overdone and over dressed. They change cheeses and the overall taste is thrown off without warning. They have delicious fries though, so that's a plus. They are kind of expensive - about $12 for a burger combo. Not outrageous, but I didn't find it worth the price. I heard great things about this place previously, but was not too impressed with it personally. It's okay."}
{"text":"the woman working there was a big fat woman who was so unhelpful. She was upset when I asked for a glass of water, and again was annoyed when I asked for more pickle and tomato for my burger. Oh yeah, because the burger comes with only one pickle and tomato slice. It's a half topped burger. Whatever though I got an extra pickle and tomato slice for free, albiet very slowly with attitude.   Overall the burger is decent. I'll never go back but if I lived closer by I probably would."}
{"text":"Simply Amazing!  I Love the Craft Spicy burger!   It's very well priced in comparison to most food spots on King Street.  Id give 5 stars if there was only enough room to sit and eat whenever I come in."}
{"text":"Great organic burgers, fast and efficient service. I eat there about 2-3 times a month, always positive experience."}
{"text":"I've come here for the last year or so when I'm in town on business, however when I was in this past week it seemed like the burger was smaller than usual, and it was bland. I had the Big Smoke burger, and it looked like something I would get at McDonalds. The poutine was really good though, love the real cheese curds."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Dry thin burger, absolutely no taste.  I would never return and it's a two minute walk from my home. The bacon was so thin and pulled out of a bin and tossed on burger.  It wasn't even hot and had no flavour. Go a bit further to Don Mils Centre and have a South St burger.  Far far better, better toppings and tasty. Did I say terrible? I threw most of mine out. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Husband and I ate there 3 days ago and we are still talking about it. The burgers are amazing, juicy, tasty and a good price. You won't be disappointed. The decor is ok, not as cute as the Works up the street but the meal was great. We both got the Big Smoke burgers and were very pleased by the size of the meal. You get a good amount of fries and leave full."}
{"text":"Yikes!  I am a frequent visitor at Big Smoke and usually I'm quite a fan.  Sure there are some inconsistencies here and there, but overall the food is pretty damn good.  This weekend's meal, however, left me completely sick!  I'm talking nausea, achiness, and misery to boot.  I'm not sure whether there was an issue with cooking or storing, but it was not a pretty picture.   I guess these things happen from time to time, but it will be a while before I go back to the Big Smoke."}
{"text":"Stopped here the day the new \"Urban Eatery\" opened. Burger joints being my favourite comfort food temptations, I decided to try out the new one in the Eaton Centre.  I was lucky that the crowds hadn't discovered the new food court yet - there was plenty of seating. So I ordered \"eat in\", was pleasantly surprised to get real plates and cutlery.  The burger was a disappointment - dry.  However, I have to admit I really liked the onion rings! Crisp! So I am adding an extra star to a two-star burger.   I don't know if the dry burger was an opening-day fiasco. I may try the burger again - I *know* I'll be back for the onion rings!"}
{"text":"a toronto fav! Its quick, fresh and relatively cheap. The chicken crazy burger is a must have. two locations in downtown - one on Adelaide street off of Yonge - the other in the Eaton Center food court."}
{"text":"Been eating craft (or big smoke burger) for years now. I love this place. The staff, the food, all amazing. But this is the only location I will eat from. The King E and Yorkville locations are not nearly as good for some reason. The black guy on the grill at this location puts a lotta lovin' while grilling them burgers. And for that,  I love him right back :)"}
{"text":"The food was served to me for about 15 mins. and I was the only one customer. Its the simplest Spicy burger, onion rings and coke..Its not even that specially good.  I can get the same taste with the Hero Burger plus I can get the toppings I want, without paying $13."}
{"text":"After seeing this restaurant on TV, I couldn't wait to drop by to taste the burgers first hand. When one of my dates suggested meeting up somewhere for a quick bite, I quickly suggested this place since it was conveniently located right near his workplace.  So there I was going in with high expectations after all the hype that I had made up for myself after seeing this restaurant on TV.  As we walked in, I was very surprised at how small the place was given that there was at most 5 tables and maybe a few bar stools.  This is definitely a take-out joint, and not a sit down restaurant.  So we proceeded to go up to the cash to put in our order.  There was a variety of burgers on the menu. Since I do not like caramelized onions, that sort of reduced my choices down by half.  There was a special of the day that was featured - some kind of Jalapeno style burger. Since i like a bit of spice, after a long deliberation, I decided to go for it and order the special.   Along wiith the burger special, you can order a drink.  They have two kinds of drinks. Regular softdrinks or this special soda on the top shelf.  I think if you opt for the soda, there is a nomimal additional charge.  So they rang up the bill and i think it probably was around $25 for two orders. You have the choice of onion rings or homemade fries. I picked the fries while my date picked the onion rings.    The burger turned out to be really good.  The meat tasted very fresh and the ingredients were oozing out so you definitely need to be careful so that you dont make a mess.  The fries were tasty and I didn't try the onion rings but they looked good.  The interior is very casual.  It's set-up as a take out joint.  You order, you wait, then you eat and go or take it to go.  On the postive side, there is no tip to pay.    Overall, this is a good burger joint.  I've been to other places such as Licks, Harveys,  Jack Astors, Loose Moose for burgers and this is definitely one step above given that its a gourmet burger joint.  I don't know if you could say that the taste of the meat itself was mindblowing.  They depend on the toppings for flavoring instead of putting the flavor in the meat. Atleast that's what I can remember."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger joint in town. I usually order Big Smoke Burger, but I love Blue Burger as well. The beef is always cooked with perfection and the center is pink. This place is much smaller than the other place on King East, so you might not able to find any seats during busy hours."}
{"text":"Fantastic burger. One of the best I have ever had. Definitely try it. The service and atmosphere was great as well. I like the fast that they just stick to burgers and have good variety of toppings."}
{"text":"Good compared to fast food burgers. Mediocre compared to a good restaurant burger. Like the concept though. Local beef, fresh made. The onion rings were very good."}
{"text":"Nice selection of different, unique and tasty burgers. I wouldn't say they are the \"best\" I've ever had - but they are very near the top.   The only complaint I have is the wait is usually 10 - 15 minutes.   Well worth the try."}
{"text":"Consistent with other Big Smoke locations. It seems that they've ironed out a lot of the issues mentioned in previous reviews."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place and it is my favorite of the chain burgers. Never had anything but a delicious juicy patty made the way I want. My only complaint is the price; $10 for a 4oz cheeseburher and a root beer or $15 for a combo is crazy but then again everywhere seems to be raising their prices lately so I guess it's to be expected.  Would be nice of they offered some low cost specials. The fries are good and thick, but the onion rings had too much seasoning and I found it hard to eat more than a couple.  Still though, I can appreciate the fresh patties(taste like my old man used to make on the bbq, but none of the swearing when the propane runs out) and that keeps me coming back"}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto for work. Great chicken sandwich and fries. Nice service. They were playing music with vulgar lyrics when I came in but when I inquired about their choice of music, they immediately changed it."}
{"text":"Wow! I ordered a chicken burger with caramelized onions and smoked Canadian cheddar, and it was really, really fantastic. It's a pretty small place, but they have quite the efficient system, with a wide range of choices beyond your basic burger. The fries and onion rings were delicious, too!"}
{"text":"It's a good burger, not a great burger.  While I appreciated the fact that it was made to order, it just lacked a bit in flavour, and my bun was a bit too crisp.  While at first glance, it seems like an inexpensive lunch choice at $6 for a basic burger, it can quickly get very expensive as you add customized toppings/patty.  After adding cheese and mushrooms, my burger came out to 10 bucks.  I just left thinking I could have gone to a pub down the street and got just as good a burger with a side of fries or salad included."}
{"text":"Line ups, nice storefront, interesting menu, why not give it a try?   Ordered Craft Burger (6oz fresh ground chuck) with sauted mushrooms and garlic mayo $6.99.  Added a Fries & Iced Tea for another $4.    First the burger was flavorless, and way overcooked.  It was a bit difficult to eat since it was not juicy.  Honestly, I should have returned it for my money back. The fries were even worse.  For fresh cut fries at that price I would something that a cup full of burned potatoe ends.  Are they double cooked?  Anyways, who knows.. maybe I got a bad burger and bad batch of fries... but thats enough for me to learn my lesson to stay away.  To help me feel better I went to Booster Juice and got a fantastic smoothie."}
{"text":"Let's start with the Con's:  - A lunch time line-up that can stretch an entire city block - Very limited seating - Hectic atmosphere (not really in a bad way though) if you can find a seat  Pro's:  - Chunky, FRESH, juicy beef burgers - A plethora of interesting and delicious toppings - Onion rings you could fit your head through - The poutine is very tasty and satisfying all on its own  Ok, so the Pro's have it ... Even though the lunch time wait can be excruciating, this place does burgers well. I'd suggest getting your meal to go. Be sure to call them early to place your order, you probably won't get through after 11 ish."}
{"text":"A website recently put Big Smoke Burger in its Top 10 for Toronto. It offers a good burger, but Top 10 may be a bit of a stretch.  The burger I had was satsifying and properly cooked, and the best part was probably the prize - just $11 for a cheeseburger, fries and a drink - a lot more affordable than other joints.  If you go for lunch on a weekday, try to get there right at noon or a bit before because seats disappear quickly. There's seating for about 15 people inside."}
{"text":"Best burger in town. Staff is friendly and pleasant. Love the signature burger. Fries are hand cut. Beef is fresh! Don't miss out on this one definitely one-of-a-kind."}
{"text":"Love the Blue Burger / Spicy Burger and the fries & onion rings are amazing. Definitely a lunch favorite of mine if I'm looking for something bold!"}
{"text":"I have tried Big Smoke Burger at Yorkdale and I was very impressed with the service and quality.  I thought that it would be the same at the Eaton Centre.  My jerk chicken sandwich was burned, it didn't have any spices., and the only thing I could taste is the BBQ sauce masking the burned chicken.  The bar section was dirty and I asked one of the servers to clean it, and her attitude was \"why are you bothering me\".  In general I was very dissappointed with the food and the attitude of the servers"}
{"text":"Not a bad little place, but also nothing that really grabbed me. I had their big smoke burger, and while it was pretty good, I found myself wondering if that was really the best they had to offer. I thought the meat was a bit under seasoned and the fries a bit soft for my liking.   On the plus side, the horseradish mayo was quite good, though in my burger it seemed to have collected on one side, leaving the other a bit starved.   I like to have at least two visits to a place before I settle on a final opinion, so I'll be back to try something different, but the first visit left me a bit underwhelmed.   On a final note,  the burgers are priced reasonably well, but I'm not sure the added $4+ for the combo is worth it. All in, you're looking at around $17 (tip incl) for a burger and fries."}
{"text":"Great burger, especially for a Food Court.   First they have Great Burger, and the right balance between al-carte and signature burgers.  Second, good fries Third, options, but not too many that would cause frustration.  Such as Salads, these are real salads, it you want to be a little be healthy.  Regular Burgers, Organic and Halal; Gluten free buns as options."}
{"text":"Craft Burger is my go-to place for a decent burger. I'm a combo kind of girl, so I expect to have the best of all worlds. And Craft Burger delivers in that way. In addition to the delicious burgers, their fries are deliciously crisp and tasty and the onion rings pretty good. Actually, I prefer my onion rings to be of a lighter batter (like GBK) and C.B's is more heavy in that department (i.e., breaded). I'm not trying to say that Craft Burger is the best...I think I'm still in search of that...but in terms of what Toronto has to offer, it's a pretty consistent performer. Also, great service and I'm a stickler for service. Give me crusty and no matter how the burger is, it will cut 25% of my experience...at least.  For something different, try the Crazy Burger...with coleslaw, bbq sauce, jalapeno havarti, and hot peppers...it's a tasty treat!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Big Smoke and have been going since it opened as Craft  Burger.  I've tried most of the burgers on the menu and I still recommend this place to other people.   I have noticed over the past year or so that the consistency has been way off. The first dozen times I went, I was quite happy with my burger.   However, when the King Street East location opened around the corner from my office I have been more frequently and noticed a real decline  in the quality.   At times I get a burger and it is perfectly seasoned and well cooked. Good char, and a little pink in the middle and very juicy. At other times, like many other reviewers have indicated, the burger can be dead on arrival.  It is disappointing that the quality is all over the map. I have noticed that during lunch rushes is when the quality drops but that is no excuse. This should be the time they are working to improve quality and drum up repeat business.  One more thing, I love the onion rings from this place. Awesome crust and they have always been prepared right when I've eaten them.  Of the 4 locations, I would try the King West location but try to give it a shot during non peek hours."}
{"text":"Last Friday stopped in with a friend to have a bite. We both ordered the Jerk Chicken and a beer.  Way over priced for what you get...The chicken was very small and dry on an oversized bun."}
{"text":"Love the burger; love the quality of the meat!! Its a perfect place to go to kill your burger craving. 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan since it is was Kraft Burger, but the quality has definitely gone downhill since the franchise changed over. I ordered the Happy Hour special - a 4 oz. burger, fries, and a fountain soft drink for $7.99, and it is noticeably different from what I have had in the past. I was served by the owner of the franchise (I recognize her from the replies, below) and was really surprised at how the portions had shrunk. You can look at the pictures and decide for yourself; I placed my wallet beside the burger for size comparison, but even the pickle and tomato slice show that this is more a of slider than an actual burger. I did eat about three fries (no more than that) before the picture, but even that seemed a skimpy portion.  I get inflation and reasonable expectations for eating downtown, but I feel my meal was not consistent with their usual offerings, and wish they wouldn't do that to customers. Either offer something completely different than the regular menu item (and admit it) or raise the price to something that justifies reasonable portions."}
{"text":"I love Craft Burger and I miss working nearby. It's an unbelievable burger and poutine that will knock your socks off. Best in town as far as I'm concerned. The options for toppings and organic meat make my mouth water. The Blue Burger is amazing as a veggie burger, and the fast and friendly service makes the lineup tolerable."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the spicy burger with cheese.  The fries are nice and crispy too.  A little squishy to eat in so take-out is best.  The burgers are cooked fresh so you do have to wait.....it is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, terrible buns. Also, their default is \"medium rare\". Not sure how that's safe with ground beef. A single piece of meat is perfectly safe to eat undercooked. But once it's been through a grinder, it really should be cooked fully."}
{"text":"Staff was very rude. They did not care at all!!!!  Burgers were too pricey for what I got.   Honestly, I was very pissed off. I might be a bit biased because I had a horrible service.   Even Hero Burgers is better than this place. At least people are nicer over there.  Food was fresh but you lose your apetite once someone mistreats when serving food to you. I felt like I wasted my money.   Never going back, these guys need to do a better job at servicing their customers!!!!!"}
{"text":"Almost $14 dollars for their 'best' burger' with a small serving of fries and soda.  If you've ever had a real hamburger you know this place is way overpriced compared to the amount and quality of food they serve."}
{"text":"LIKE! That is a lot coming from someone who never orders burgers.   Granted, I ordered the Craft Burger with a veggie patty... take my word, the veggie patty surprised me with how good it was. It was moist and flavourful. Possibly the best veggie burger I have had for as long as I can recall. The Craft toppings were alright and added to the overall enjoyment of the burger. My girl ordered the Big Smoke Burger and she thought it was delicious. The smoked cheddar really adds a lot of smoke to the flavour of that one (hence the name... clever clever).  We went at an odd dinner time on Saturday night. They were steady but not extremely busy so we got our burgers pretty fast and the joint was nice and quiet. Dig. Added bonus: it was up the street from my gf's place. If it was priced a little lower (combo is around $13) and if we didn't watch Food Inc. a few days after going here, we might find ourselves there more often. But I think the price is fair, this is a gourmet burger joint that gives you tasty burgers.  Atmosphere - 3.5 Service - 3.5 Food - 4 Price - 4"}
{"text":"The Crazy Burger is excellent. Not only are the fries well done, the burgers juicy, and the ingredients tasty, but the service is really good as well."}
{"text":"Had the craft burger (hate the name) which was fabulous.  Rosemary mayo, grilled mushrooms, lettuce and tomato - was perfectly cooked, a lovely pink inside and traveled well.  I had it to go and ate it about 1/2 hour later.    Side of onion rings where great and ended up being too much for me to finish by myself (normal appetite)."}
{"text":"i find it hard to get a good burger in toronto unless i make it myself. With 95% of places responding to a request for medium-rare with an answer that health code doesn't allow for it.   didn't even bother to ask for it here .. but when my burger came, i was pleasantly surprised to find it a little pink in the middle, and very flavourful. I've been back a few times now trying different burgers on their menu ... the crazy burger has got to be my favourite.  oh, and for something like 50cents more ... you can upgrade your fountain drink to a boylans soda. awesome."}
{"text":"More like four and a half.  Still my favourite burger in Toronto. There have been so many burger places opening in Toronto and for me this is the sweet spot of gourmet without going over the top. The fries remind me of NYF (not a bad thing). A lot of people like the onion rings, but they are a big bready for me. I usually get the Craft Burger."}
{"text":"Giving this 5 stars because I was beyond impressed to be able to order an organic burger with Beretta Farms beef in a mall food court. Super impressed with the quality of meat offered and definitely don't mind that it takes 8 mins to make (real food should take some time to prepare). They also offer Boylan soda which is all natural and made with cane sugar - a nice treat when you want to have one and can avoid the mass produced products from Coca-Cola. The prices are decent and worth it based on what you're getting. Thank you Big Smoke Burger!"}
{"text":"The burger I had here was awesome and they have a nice selection of burgers to choose from. Seats are a bit limited and waiting time for my order was more than 10 minutes but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Every boeuf eater I know turns a sympathetic eye in my direction as they destroy a burger. \"Come on, how can you live without hamburgers?! Well guys, it's easy - there are some amazing alternatives out there that satisfy any burger urges I might have. I've had a lot of veggie burgers in this city, and Craft Burger just might top the list.   Ok, it's not like their veg burger is extraordinarily different from most other soy substitutes - it's just done so well. But it's also the priciest one I've had - with tax, it tops out at around 8 bucks, and that doesn't include a drink or fries (or fancy toppings, which are always fun). Truth is I'll hit up Lick's or Harvey's 75% of the time for a cheaper (but still tasty) burger fix - but when I'm feeling saucy, I'll whip out the gold card for some Craft. If you're like, \"over $10 for a combo?! Well I never!\", please note: the veg burger is so hefty that girly eaters like me are usually pretty full without any sides.   Things I need to try: Poutine ($4.95), milkshakes"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan. A can't go wrong burger... that being said over the past few months the service and the quality has gone down hill. Don't order their poutine. Today, it had no gravy and hardly any curds.  When I asked what was the issue they told me that everything is pre measured and that's how they make it. The staff are generally indifferent or rude. I know they had a change in management a few months back and it shows."}
{"text":"Up there with Burger's Priest.  Got the big smoke burger with horseradish mayo.  Tasty."}
{"text":"I've been coming here ever since it opened as a Craft Burger, and now as a renamed Big Smoke Burger, it's still satisfies.  On my very first visit, I opted to try the \"Craft Burger\", figuring that it was probably somewhat of a signature burger for them, since it was the same name. Sauteed mushrooms, rosemary garlic mayo, tomato and lettuce, on a juicy, handmade beef patty, fire-grilled to perfection.  Now, many visits later, that's the only burger I get there. I sometimes think about trying a different one, but when it's my turn to order, I keep going back to that because it never disappoints. I used to get the fries, but ever since trying a friend's onion ring, that's now my go-to side order, too. Haha. Big rings, battered and breaded and always super-crunchy.  It's both a blessing and a curse that this is so close to my condo. ;)"}
{"text":"OMG the best in the city and the best service ever. If you like veggie burgers too it is the ultimate ! I have had a ton of burgers from different places but this one is bar none the best"}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had- actually! I don't really like set-up of the place (half fast food joint, half restaurant???) but other than that, the burger was the best tasting one i have ever tried. I tried to find my perfect burger in vancouver.. who knew I would have to come to craft burger to find it."}
{"text":"Craft Burger isn't bad. I'm not the hugest burger person as I only get Veggie - but on the rare occasion that I feel like one, I go here.   Its kinda pricey for a veggie with fries and pop coming in at about $13 but I rather pay $13 than $10 for some mediocre \"vegetable patty\" and frozen fries at some pub.   Pros:  - The \"Spicy\" Topping set of spicy mayo and caramelized onions is actually spicy. Its GOOD.  - There are lamb burgers for my SO who loves lamb. (plus I approve lamb eating on the health/environmental impact scale of having to love a man that eats meat) - They have whole wheat buns sometimes.  - Its Clean and close to work.  - Malt Vinegar - Good Service  Cons:  - During Lunch etc rush it is always PACKED. Like impossibly. - The washrooms are downstairs and are a little dank.  Its worth trying, just go on off hours. Nice enough ambiance for a casual date or to meet a friend for a quick bite."}
{"text":"What was Craft Burger (now Big Smoke) just north of Yonge and Bloor was great, so one weekend I was in the Eaton Centre and decided to try out Big Smoke.  Was with my family and everyone else got their food quick.  I was stuck in this lineup waiting with some very tense people waiting for their burgers.    Was taking forever to make the burgers - apparently they were training new staff.  Anyways, took twenty minutes to make my burger, my family was finished eating.  The burger was fine, but holee sh*&, a wait like that is not worth it.    So if there is no line, by all means, try it out.  But if there is a line, forget it.  The line isn't indicative of how good the food is, but how slow the service is.  Big Smoke should figure out how to create some efficiencies, I mean they got like 7 people working there, but still takes forever.  At Yonge and Bloor you can sit and wait, here you have to stand like a moron and pray that they didn't forget your order."}
{"text":"This use to be Kraft Burger.  Its an amazing burger.  Prices are great too.  Onion rings and fries also very yummy.  There spicy burger is awesome.  Sometimes they have a speciality burger which is worth trying too.  Milk shakes are great too.  I haven't been since they changed the name, and it seems to be franchising a bit, but I'm sure its still great."}
{"text":"I am not a burger maniac but occasionally I still want to try burger other than Mac, Burger King junks... This location is situated inside Eaton Centre so decide to give it a shot during a recent shopping trip.  What got to my attention first is the price, wow burger nowadays are so expensive and my order total $14 and change.  Had a medium well cheeseburger with fries and ice tea.  The burger has some flavour and patty is nicely done and juicy alright, for a 9 bucks burger it'd better be juicy.  A little bit more seasoning would have been great, and I don't really taste cheese on this burger, weird.  Fries is... Fries. Nothing much to write about.  Seriously the taste is not bad, but will I pay another 14 bucks for the same order again, probably not.  Maybe because I am just not a big fan of burger in general.  Overall 3/5"}
{"text":"So based on reviews I decided to try Big Smoke Burger, (formerly Craft Burger) at their King East location. The burger was awesome. One of the best burgers I've ever had.  The fries were skinny and crispy. I prefer fat and potatoey. Also the kethup on hand was really vinagery.  The burger was worth it though."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today. Not a big fan to be honest. I had the Big Smoke Burger combo. The Burger was tooooo greasy, messy and wasn't really special at all. The fries was greasy as well. I don't see myself going there again."}
{"text":"I wish they had sweet potato fries! But yumm."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday to find another restaurant practicing unsanitary food prep.  The cook grabbed the cheese with his bare hands and put the cheese directly on my burgers and the customers before me.  I feel so sorry for the customers before me, because they did not see this.  As soon as I got home I trough the burger away.  Once again; we can see you.  If you ( Big Smoke) continue to hire people who do not understand contamination: you may have another \"Typhoid Mary\" on your hands.  Good Luck. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"I enjoy Big Smoke Burgers. In fact, this is one of the reasons I visit Yorkdale because it's THAT good!  I, like many others, enjoyed the classic burger but the blue burger is pretty tasty too -- that is, if you like blue cheese! But do NOT be discouraged by the smell (or even taste of blue cheese) because paired with the avocado, it is really delicious! Not to mention the juiciness and the thickness of these patties. You know for sure that these aren't your fast food burgers.  My only complaint is that the burgers are pricey compared to prices for other burgers within the vicinity (ie A&W). However, you are paying the price of well made burgers with fresh and innovative concoctions.   If you haven't tried a Big Smoke Burger, you should at least try one!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the Organic Burger. The ingredients are fresh and the meat is grilled to perfection.  The fries are a generous portion and definitely filing. You don't get a heavy, greasy after taste. The first location I ever went to was on King West when it was still Craft Burger.  Glad to see this expanding as a franchise.  With all the gourmet burger restaurants opening all over town, these guys rise to the top."}
{"text":"I have been to several of their locations and they are consistent from store to store. I always get the Beretta Farms Organic burger on Whole Wheat bun. It is very tasty and well textured. The fry portions are generous. My family and I have been going here since it was Craft Burger. Definitely worth a visit if you are into quality."}
{"text":"My second time on this place at King...First time around was  not  a good experience: long wait, extremely expensive for a so-so burger..  A year or so later, decided to give it a second try.. Even worse than the first time around..  Same problems and more..  poor, dishonest service as well.  I asked for a diet coke; they charged me accordingly.. When i was ready to go and get the drink, noticed there was no CO2 on the machine for any of the drinks !  They suggested i'd take ice tea..Well, I did not ask/buy an 'ice tea' drink; i had specifically asked for diet coke..  Not even the courtesy of offering the money for the pop back.. No, I did not ask for it; it should have come from them.  Just ate the  meh burger and left..for the last time."}
{"text":"I went to Craft on Yonge *(just north of Bloor) for the first time today, after reading all the raves on here. Let me tell you I am NOT disappointed.  I've been in search of veggie burger since Harvey's moved. And I just finished eating theirs. No comparison. I absolutely loved it and it was worth the price I paid for $6.95. The sandwich was much bigger than harveys and they even ask you what type of bread you want. I choose whole wheat ofcourse. Absolutely delicious. I am so full right now. For extra 3.20 you can make the sandwich a meal with a choice of fries or rings + soda or water. Can't beat that. The combo was a bit expensive, came out to $11.47 but hey when they advertise \"fresh never frozen, hand crafted burgers, etc.\" I mean you kinda say okay maybe it was worth it.  Price: If you just choose to get a burger alone it could be under $10 however it could easily cost you $11-12 if you add any extra ingredients, pop/water and/or fries. One thing, any extra toppings for your burger - roasted red peppers, or avocado or gorgonzola or mushrooms etc. will cost you $1.25 which I think is a bit pricey.  I only waited what felt like 2-3 minutes. The space is small, so if you go there with over 7 people - book ahead of time, as it could get busy during lunch hour. I was there at around 1:30pm and the place seemed popular. There were enough people there with still seats for maybe 7-10 more people to have their lunch.  There are tables along the window if you want to go alone and eat.  I'm happy I discovered this place. I am definitely going there again this time to  try their chicken burgers.  Thank you Yelp. I wouldn't have discovered this place without you."}
{"text":"I was expecting more from this place.  I get impressed when I order something that I'm not able to make at home easily or it would take great effort to do. This was not one of those times.   We decided to eat in. We saw lots of people taking out their food. It's a tight place with tables and connected booth along the wall. The decor is simple, the platters you eat from are lined with craft paper on stainless steel trays, overall feel fits in with the trendy King St. W area  As for the blue cheese burger I ordered. The hamburger meat was alright. Same with the poutine. It tasted very much like something you'd get from NY fries.   They delivered the wrong burger the first time to me however quickly rectified the matter. The manager goes around to patrons eating in how things are. This was good service that I wasn't expecting at a fast food place.   Average, I've had better gourmet burger's at Heroes."}
{"text":"Was there for lunch today and was only impressed by the friendly service. Food was unsatisfying and overpriced. PS: the \"spicy\" burger was bland and not spicy at all."}
{"text":"Big Smoke burger, rings and a fountain drink plus an add on of cheese. The burger was juicy, bun was nice and the rings were good. Much better than some of the way overpriced craft burger chains. Didn't feel gross after eating it. All for $13 bucks which really got me thinking about why on earth anyone would go to McD's and pay $11 bucks for a large fake burger combo when they can have a fresh grilled patty burger for a couple bucks more."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, plain and simple!    Super fresh, fries were also fresh and slightly over cooked (just how I like them!).  Service was friendly, given with a smile.  They even gave me the idea for how to get free wifi!  Only gripe would be that is looks like a fast food place, but it's not fast food.  They should either remove the tabletop napkin dispensers and fountain pop machine, making it more restaurant-like, or speed up the food delivery."}
{"text":"Dont get the \"FRINGS\" because it's not half fries half rings. It has THREE onion rings on top of a regular bowl of fries. Lamb burger is underseasoned. Beef burger is just okay.   I had high expectations but sadly didnot enjoy it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the service is pretty terrible and the quality is very inconsistent.  As soon as I got there, the place was only mildly occupied, but I was waiting at the counter for about 5 minutes before someone acknowledged my presence and took my order.  After placing my order, I took a seat, not realizing I'd be there for 30 minutes waiting for two burgers and fries. Not only did orders take a ridiculous long time to prepare, but my order was essentially pushed below two large groups of people. One of the groups actually apologized to me not understanding why they got served before me.  When the cashier finally gave me my order 30 minutes after I had placed it, I was relieved to finally just get out there. Except they forgot to give me part of my order. I only realized this after walking out of the restaurant.  I came back in and told them that they forgot something and asked to get a refund because I felt the whole experience was pretty awful. The short cashier gave me attitude as if it wasn't a big deal and was very unapologetic about the entire experience. I insisted on getting a refund. I ended up having to wait another 10 minutes because their machines were acting up and they had trouble giving me a refund to my credit card.  As I weren't the only one annoyed at the experience, while waiting there I saw someone return his burger TWICE because they screwed up his instructions. Eventually he just shook his head at disbelief and got rid of the toppings he didn't ask for, begrudgingly eating his burger. To add, I know he also waited a ridiculously long time for his burger because he was already waiting a while for his burger by the time I placed my order.  There are many better fast food options in the area. Avoid!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, verrry slow service, sloppy food preparation/presentation and poor customer service. I came here with some friends for a business lunch today (Thurs, June 18 at 12:15pm).   Both colleagues got burgers while I got a regular chicken burger. Their burgers arrived promptly (within 10mins) while I waited and stared at them as they finished heir burgers over a 20 min conversation. My chicken burger finally arrived half charred, chewy with the chicken meat half hanging out of the bun, while my colleagues sat in their seats with empty plates. The waitress gave me a standard apology about the place being busy (although there are other restaurants in the area that are adequately handling customers on time during lunch as well!) without a notion of reimbursing me for the lateness or the terribly made chicken burger (how hard is it to cook a chicken breast fillet?) which fell apart in pieces after my first bite. I had to eat the fallen pieces meat off my plate while I ate the two empty buns that sat in my left hand separately. By the end of finishing my plate I just wanted to get out of the restaurant. Total waste of $9.   The chef or owner needs to remove chicken related items from their menu if they can't get it right. Their strong suit is obviously beef burgers..."}
{"text":"Usually when I go to the Urban Eatery, I tend to stick to the same places, but today I decided to give Big Smoke a try.  Just before noon, there was a pretty big lineup of business people on their lunchbreak, but the line moved quite fast!  Also, the cashier asks for your name, which is a lot either at the end when you get your burger, and you find it confusing figuring out which one is yours.  I ordered the veggie burger with the combo.  It seemed quite expensive, but the burger was very delicious.  I usually dislike toasted buns, but the bun was perfectly toasted very lightly.  I would give it 5 stars if the fries were better; They seemed to be cooked very well done, but were not at all crispy.  I find that the best places that serve fresh cut fries are the ones that cook them twice - but not all places are able to....  I noticed that some people got the onion rings, and they looked very appetizing.... Next time I'm there, I know what I'll be getting!  Service was quite fast, but I noticed that some of the people that were behind me got their orders first, and just when I was going to ask where mine was, they called my name.... I'll definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Just a little better then your typical fast food burger.  Nothing extremely special, but not horrible.  I did enjoy the fries.  Home cut style fries."}
{"text":"Okay place for a burger. The order took a while to come out and I expected it to be a bit bigger for what they were charging. However, the burger itself was great: good patty, homemade sauce was nice, and flavor was there. Overall solid place to go."}
{"text":"There's one thing to note here, as it can actually be important to some.... The Organic Beef Burger (from Beretta Farms).  While it ends up being the 2nd most expensive burger at the restaurant, for those who go organic, its worth noting."}
{"text":"Love my craft spicy burger!!!! Love the atmosphere. I work close to here and whenever I get the craving for a nice big fat juicy burger I head down to here!"}
{"text":"Meh, nothing exciting. Fresh, decent, reasonably priced. Tastes like Harvey's burger."}
{"text":"Ordered the organic grass fed burger, tasted like it had been cooked an hour before I ordered it. They also put so much mustard on it, the mustard was seeping over the sides, but next to no other toppings. Very disappointing for a $10 burger!"}
{"text":"I'm the first person to try a hamburger anywhere. Walk-in around the Toronto Eaton Centre I spot BIG SMOKE BURGER. I'm all in. I get the Big Smoke cheddar bacon burger with a poutine and drink. 18$ I'm starting to second guess my pick as I pay for my order. My burger comes off the grill and I see a thin patty topped with one micro piece of bacon.... FML. \"This burger better be straight from the heavens\" I think to myself.   I paid 18$ for whopper, mediocre poutine and ginger ale. Delicious burger, but way over priced."}
{"text":"Just a quick update.  This is really bad.  Lately, we have been stopping at Craft Burger once a week, usually after working out.  It still holds number one spot for best burger (on our list).  Wait, also number spot on BlogTO as one of the best burger in Toronto."}
{"text":"I tried the Big Smoke burger and came away impressed. The horseradish mayo was perfect as were the caramelized onions. I didn't think that the smoky cheddar went too well with the rest of the ingredients but that may be a personal preference. The fries were above average but not excellent. Overall, a solid dining experience."}
{"text":"Decemburger Dismay  An awful lot of burger joints have popped up in Toronto over the last several months and some, through either good marketing or great word of mouth, have gained name-brand status in the city.  On the other hand, Craft Burger had name brand status by virtue of incumbency, and merely opened up a new location (Yonge Street, just North of Bloor) in the height of Toronto's Burger Bonanza. Still, I was excited to sink my teeth into one of Decemburger's big players and find out exactly how it stood up to the competition.  I wasn't delighted.  I don't have much to say about this place, largely because I was frustrated by the time my food arrived in front of me. The person \"greeting\" me at the cash didn't exactly seem happy to see me and I felt lost in this place. Craft's ordering and serving process could use some help for sure; as a new customer I had no idea what was going on, how my food would show up of what to do about condiments, napkins, etc.  I stopped in for a burger, but wanted to try the onion rings and a milkshake. I could get a combo, I was told, but it comes with a soft drink (read: can of Coke, can of Sprite of bottle of water) or I could pay full pop for both the onion rings and the shake. I said screw it, might as well go for a soda.*  The burger was tasty, but not that filling. I had the Craft Blue, which came topped with gorgonzola, avocado, lettuce, tomato and rosemary garlic mayo.  For $7, it's good value.  I quickly disposed of the lettuce and tomato so I could enjoy the rest of my toppings.  On the whole, the burger was delicious, but I don't think the patty contributed to the experience nearly so much as the creamy gorgonzola and avocado combination.  I never would have thought of that one on my own, that's for sure.  It's the onion rings I remember most, because they sucked. My portion was small, and the rings were thick and lumpy. Some of them had two layers of onion in them and I ended up pulling most of the onions out of their breading because I just couldn't seem to chew through them. I was left with a pile of onion on my plate, sans ring.  This place is good for a decent burger in a hurry, but I don't think much more.  * Obligatory CanCon reference"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty for a food court burger! I had the Big Smoke burger (tomato, lettuce, carmelized onions, horseradish mayo and cheese) and thought it was really tasty! I would definitely order it again. The onion rings were nothing special and lacked seasoning. It cost me about $14 but I upgraded to the onion rings and a bottled drink. I thought it seemed like good, high quality food for being in a food court and the service was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Burgers are great! Make sure to take several napkins. Service is relatively quick (eaton centre location) depending on time of day. For someone who works in the mall this is a great treat!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times since moving to Toronto and it's so far my favourite burger place in the city. I've had my FAIR share of burgers and I like to burg out whenever I get the urge to burge.   I first had the lamb burger, since I've never HAD a lamb burger before and I had always Wanted to have a lamb burger. It was exceptionally fresh and delicious. Had a great sauce on it and wasn't too messy, though I don't mind a messy burger if it tastes right. The lamb was cooked perfectly and wasn't burnt or charred.   My second visit, I had the SPICY burger. It was very hot and messy and saucy and oniony, but not so spicy. I was kind of hoping it would be spicy but I'm almost glad it wasn't because I was feeling BLEARGHY from the night before. It was cooked very well and ultimately delicious however I felt the not-so-spicy sauce may have overpowered the burg. It was all over the place and my oversized burg-bib could barely catch it all.   I want to keep trying different burgers and things on their menu. It's a nice menu.   ~I~ was really impressed with the staff there as well. Super (super) friendly and knowledgeable. They took my name down so we can now be facebook friends and even delivered my BURG right TO ME because I had snagged a wicked table by the window. Then they (she) asked how the burger was and even used the fake name I gave them when I ordered!   Overall I will be going there very often and look forward to taking my girlfriend there also so we can both burg out."}
{"text":"Good Burger but NO BACON!  I thought I was on candid camera when the cashier told me that they did not serve bacon with their burger.  Apparently the owners do not eat pork.    Craft Burger: Please don't mix religion and diner food...."}
{"text":"Just go to Burger Priest...  My experience:  1. Greeted (or lack thereof) by an unpleasant and disinterested server 2. Long wait considering there was only one other table in the restaurant 3. Burger was just ok, patty was small for the bun. Whole wheat bun option is nice, but it was completely slathered in ketchup. I like ketchup but it was dripping off the bun and then I had to remove half the bun, which was soaked with ketchup. I also like the option to have jalapenos as a topping. 4. Fries were great  ------  Review update:  After my review, someone from the company contacted and offered me a free combo meal based on my previous experience. They seem to have quality customer service and want  you to have a satisfactory experience, however I still have yet to claim my free combo and have no intention of going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"12 bucks for a cheese burger, onion rings and a water. Lousy service and bad attitude are free. For the price you get a bland burger and soggy rings. The cash staff are less than bright having to repeat my order 4 times. Gave the cashier a $20 and a Townie and she gave me $8 in change then argued with me that she was right. When I explained that she could have given me a $10 bill, her response was so! Next time I'll just cross Yonge Street and go to 5 Guys."}
{"text":"Great little burger place - decent prices with a huge offering of different types of quasi-\"gourmet\" burgerdom.  A combo costs about $12 and they may skimp a bit on the onion rings but they're worth it--very tasty."}
{"text":"Used to be a fan, but the quality of the food has definitely deteriorated recently, with burgers that resemble Mcd's in taste and size, but is much more pricy. The only item on the menu that hasnt changed much are the onion rings.   Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Lunch break need not be boring with Craft burgers around! Around 1 every seat was filled but that was ok with me because I had already decided on taking it to go. I was served with a smile and was grateful that I had looked at the online menu before coming in. I looked like a regular, not glancing at the menu and just ordering \"Craft Spicy\" combo- fries.   I waited at the side, close to the washrooms until someone came out, called my name and handed me a brown paper stuffed with my goodies and stamped with the Craft Burger logo. All this with about a two minute wait. Off to enjoy.   Come devouring time- I was starving- the food was more filling than one would think! That's because this stuff is real. The hamburger came out of its foil with the bun already a bit soaked from the juices of caramelized onions. To some this may be unappealing but to me with as inviting as an enormous welcome mat. The burger itself was the perfect temperature, juicy and made the whole experience. The toppings of caramelized onions and spicy chipotle mayo were so on the money that I don't think that burger left my hands until I was done. Tomato and lettuce are always nice from crunch and taste but were certainly not the stars of the burger. No, each bite I was picking up something new and great. The only disappointment was the fries. They just didn't have that fresh-from-the-fryer taste.   So this was a bit of splurge for a simple, lunch break meal coming in around eleven dollars but it was worth breaking the piggy bank."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Big Smoke Burger Cuisine: Burgers, American Address: 50 King St East, Toronto Price Range: $5-10  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4 Service: 3 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5  Extra information:  * Specializes in handcrafted Burgers  * 3 locations in Toronto  * Used to be called Craft Burger  * Only uses Ontario AAA beef  One thing I realized about restaurant trends in Toronto is that there are so many Burger places. Big Smokes being one of them. Big Smokes Burger is so conveniently located a block from my house, did I mention I love living in downtown? everything is so close!  Interior is done quite nicely for a Burger place, there was seating area enough for ~15 people and the high ceilings made the restaurant bigger than it was. Of course I looked at their online menu before I went in, and I have this theory that when you try a restaurant for the first time, you should always try their specialty- something that is named after their restaurant. Therefore, I went with the Big Smoke Burger Combo (horseradish mayo, caramelized onions, smoked cheddar, tomato & lettuce). For $10.75 plus tax, it comes with refillable fountain soda and fries.  My Burger was huge in portion, they claim to only use Ontario AAA beef and fresh ingredients which was quite obvious when I took a bite. The burger was fresh and juicy just as I expected. However, there was too much horseradish mayo in my burger and it was a little salty. Fries on the other hand, was so good! They were perfectly cripsy and piping hot, love love love em! Other than that, it was very good and I would def go back- next time probably try the Craft Burger with sateed mushrooms :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and BOY is this place popular. Considering it's inside the mall and there's TONS of other options, it seemed to be the one of the few retailers with a long line up.   So, in hopes of finding the greatest burger of all time, I decided to give the eccentric menu a dance.     Blue Burger - You can ask for whole wheat bun which is great for a more diverse option to the standard burger. Good sign. The cashier ran through a few options, which again is a good sign (even with the long line up) she didn't rush me to make a decision but helped me by explaining what Gorgonzola was. The burger wasn't meatier in comparison to a regular Harvey's burger. The toppings to this Signature burger was    gorgonzola - which is a sort of cheese, I changed it to Jalapeno Havarti avocado -  main reason I selected this signature. I can't say it was a good mix...just...different.  rosemary garlic mayo - they didn't have enough of this on the burger. I asked for some on the side. The mayo concentration was more than I would've hoped for. I couldn't taste the garlic       :'( sadness I added Caramelized Onions- which were delicious , especially with the generous portion.   I usually like my burger to have a kick. Not a i-hate-you kick. More like a muy Thai Ong Bak kind of kick. The kind of burger that makes you remember her name and address and brings up creepy instincts to gps her, just in case. While the toppings gave this burger some kick, it wasn't the kick I was looking for. The avocado was too squishy and mixed with the mayo, it got greasy - super quick. That taste carried throughout which made me sad.   Side of Onion rings - My favourite onion rings are from A&W. Now, I know the kind of onion rings I like and this was DEFINITELY not it. It tasted AND looked like a warmed up version of a no frills frozen bag of onion rings. I tried dipping it into concoctions of ketchup, mayo, ketchup and mayo, ketchup mayo and mustard, mustard, ketchup and BBQ sauce. Nada. She went dead on me.  Needless to say , the burger is mediocre. Alas the search for the best burger continues.   You get to watch your burger go through the assembly line and the staff are pretty efficient but this one girl had her Iphone up against the glass and i was reading all her facebook updates. apparently some Asian guy was very insistent on her fb profile. After a few minutes she asked \" anything good on there?\" and i let her know of the alias name. Apparently a few staff members down, was this girls bf. Needless to say, he wasn't pleased with this other guy poking her fb profile so much. There was some tensioned looks after that. I don't know what happened next but my burger arrived and I bounced.   Maybe the hefty prices also include watching the \"real life\" version of Breaker High.  xoxo M."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Big Smoke Burger, I was going to go with a classic or the craft burger.  I ended up order the Blue Burger with a side of Onion Rings.  Wow, great flavour combo and with those crispy onion rights...mmmmm  I am most definitely going  to have to make a return visit, and try the Lamb, Red or the Big Smoke Burger!"}
{"text":"Not worth going out of your way to get but the lamb burger was okay. It did not have a strong taste unfortunately. The fries were great! Was served at average speed."}
{"text":"The burgers are great, but you can freeze your ass off on these metal chairs."}
{"text":"For all the hype this place gets and the prices you pay here I was expecting gourmet and all I got was sub-par.  I am so disappointed by the meal I had here tonight.  My boyfriend got the Big Smoke burger and I got the Red Burger and we both upgraded the burger to Beretta Farms organic meat.  We shared a large order of poutine and while the size of it was perfect for a side for two people the gravy they use tastes artificial and cheap.  There's no mistaking that it was concocted out of powder.  We also got two bottles of pop - Boylan's root beer and dark cherry, word of warning: the dark cherry is really sugary and requires a big sweet tooth to enjoy.  The service was very unhelpful, we ended up with none of the \"free\" toppings because the woman at the cash did not offer them and quickly moved to the second cash to serve the group of three people who had just walked in.  Having never eaten at Big Smoke Burger before I had no idea my burger would arrive without even one slice of tomato or any onion at all.   For the prices they charge these kind of default toppings should be included on the side at the very least so you can add them yourself. The piece of iceburg lettuce they included was soggy and pitiful.  I wouldn't mind so much if the toppings that they did put on weren't so sparse.  The roasted red peppers on mine could have been increased by double the amount.  They however made sure to saturate my bun in mayo.  Mustard was non existent and not available on the tables from what I could see.  The woman at the cash did not give us the option of type of bun and what we received was the whole wheat bun which overpowers the hamburger.  I would have appreciated the option rather than being arbitrarily given a random one.  If you like ambiance you won't like this place.  The chairs are uncomfortable and the atmosphere is akin to any generic fast food place.  I'll also note that the door slams noisily every time someone walks in and out.  I will never eat here again.  It was $33 (after tax) wasted on over glorified flavorless generic hamburgers for two.  I didn't even make it halfway through my burger, instead I wrapped it up in napkins, popped it in my purse and brought it home to doctor it up."}
{"text":"Man, burgers are expensive these days! Big Smoke certainly gives you enough to write home about though!   The Craft Burger was loaded with mushrooms and the patty was nice and juicy (Seriously, the juice was dripping out of the burger) and the bun is nice and soft, though a bit small compared to the burger as a whole. I had onion rings on the side and it was the BIGGEST rings I've had (that's what she said). Drinks are also re-fill-able.   A lot of people were ordering poutines, so I gotta give that a try next time!"}
{"text":"I have been to this burger joint before it was called \"Big Smoke Burger\", aka the burger joint formerly known as \"Craft Burger\".  Their claim to fame is that their beef is Grade AAA and not frozen patties.  Yes, their burger did taste super fresh but the overall burger experience was average.  My burger was a bit dry and I found my bun over-sized; I had more bun to burger ratio.  For a $6.50 Classic Burger - it did make an affordable lunch but not sure if I would repeat the experience.  I do love their poutine; I might come back for that.  Check our the \"Big Smoke Burger\" joint for yourself and you can be the judge if it meets your burger expectations."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in town.   Ordered a big smoke burger with my coworkers. It was the middle of lunch, and they were busy. Still, the burger came out beautifully and we shared some fries. Overall really solid burger in the Financial District. Also, it's halal."}
{"text":"Oh man. This is such a disappointing review for me to write. I love Big Smoke Burger on Yonge Street. I had a pretty good Big Smoke Burger experience on King West. I was hoping that this closer-to-home Big Smoke location would at least be good, but it was not. Unfortunately I'm not going to have my Big Smoke cravings satisfied without having to drive to Toronto.   So I order the spicy burger combo and I watch the dude slap my patty on the grill. So far so good. I then watch the grill continuously flare up. I really had to restrain myself from being a back-seat griller and shouting out, \"Hey, buddy, how about you try controlling those flare ups, please.\" I didn't want to be one of those people so I said nothing.   I also said nothing as I continued to watch my patty shrink ever so quickly because of all the flare ups. I continued to say nothing as the dude flipped my patty over and over again when what I really wanted to do was yell at the top of my lungs, \"Dude, that patty must be done by now with all the direct fire it's received. Pull it now!\"   Just as the dude is about to pull my patty off the grill, the other guy says, \"It's a spicy,\" so the first guy puts my surely overcooked patty back on the grill and covers it with grilled onions to warm up the onions. They left that overcooked patty with the onions on the grill for another three minutes or so as my burger loving soul died a little more. Finally he pulled the patty.  What did I end up with? A creosote covered charcoal briquette. Black on the outside, dry as MDF on the inside. I knew this was happening. I knew this was happening and I said nothing because I assumed people who are paid to cook burgers everyday know more than I and because I didn't want to be one of those people. This is what happens when you restrain yourself because you don't want to be one of those people. You end up with a dangerously  blackened (seriously dangerous, read the studies about blackened grill meats)  burger and a little of your soul dying as a good burger goes up in flames (literally!). I would have brought it back, but I was in a big rush and I didn't have time to watch them ruin another patty.   The Big Smoke head office people need to get on this situation and do some remedial training for this crew. This is unacceptable. You can't serve people blackened, dried out patties. It doesn't taste pleasant and it's not safe to eat."}
{"text":"I was here for dinner a couple days ago with friends. I tried the spicy burger, fries, and a side of chipotle mayo. The burger was great. The meat was juicy and slightly pink (just as I love my burgers to be) and had a great beefy flavour. The fries, on the other hand, were over seasoned with seasoning salt to the point that I could barely eat more than a couple. I'm not sure whether they're usually like this or I just had the misfortune of having a particularly salty batch. I would ask for them to go easy on the seasoning salt if I order the fries again. The chipotle mayo is nice and spicy and they also serve Boylan's so that's another plus."}
{"text":"I had the spicy burger, fries, and a black cherry Boylan's here this evening. The burger was incredibly delicious. I could see from the sheen of moisture on the patty that this was going to be one juicy burger and it completely exceeded my expectations.   The patty was juicy and it had a strong beefy flavour. The flavour of this quality beef was not at all overshadowed by the yummy chipotle mayo or the sweet caramelized onions. The bun is also one of the most perfect burger buns I've ever had. It completely suited the burger and it was soft, but still held up to the immense juiciness and the generous toppings.   The fries were fresh hand-cut fries and they were perfectly seasoned.  Stellar burger experience. I want to live here and eat all the burgers."}
{"text":"Real Consistent food coming out of here. This time I ordered ahead for pick up. Friendly and courteous I Ordered my usual double cheese burger with putin ,and as usual my other half has her chicken burger with a side of onion rings ,this is probably our 5th time at this location and again, great burger ,good flavour, cooked nicely, the putin was good  and covered in nice tasting  gravy. The chicken was very good according to her and we both enjoyed the onion rings. Nicely done, my compliments to the staff."}
{"text":"We go there for the organic burger (beretta farms).  It's my favourite burger in the city.  I personally like it more than burger priest or others.  The price is right and the service is great."}
{"text":"Big Smoke made big promises, and the resounding opinion from me was... \"It's alright, I guess.\"  I'll save my opinion/review of the Square One revitalized food court (spoiler: it's amazing) for another time, but I did want to comment on Big Smoke, as I visited the mall recently and stopped here for a bite with a friend.  I had been meaning to visit this place for a while, but never had a chance (and the time to actually sit down and enjoy a meal) until recently. When I stepped into line - the longest in the food court, I might add - I was expecting quality that was out-of-this-world. Maybe the fault lies with me for wanting too much.  What I got was... decent, but not worth the experience. After waiting in line, a friendly server took my order, and I was a bit surprised that it costs an extra $4 just to get a drink. Add to that disinterested cooks and people who were behind me in line getting their food before me (always a sticking point), and you can see that I wasn't starting off on the best foot.  The signature Big Smoke burger I had was okay, but considering the price (something like $13 after tax for the combo), it's past the point where I consider it to be acceptable value for the money. The fancy ingredients they listed out in the menu didn't really amount to much for me, taste-wise. I was more impressed by the frosty mug they gave to me for my soft drink, and that was the high point of the experience.  Probably wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"Good burgers, good onion rings, fries could've been hotter.  They come in nice metal bowls.  Cash only!"}
{"text":"This place might have the best onion rings in the city. They're seasoned, breaded and jumbo!!! The burgers are also excellent. You really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"The craft burger was good but way too much juice running off it which made it quite hard to eat. The onion rings here are amazing though!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite during an afternoon out in Toronto. The place was small and almost completely devoid of customers but still the food came out slow (I'm my opinion).   Overall the food itself (I got a burger and poutine, the Mrs got a burger and regular fries) was good but nothing remarkable. I probably won't revisit this place on our future Toronto trips because there are just so many other options."}
{"text":"Confession: I have Craft Burger on my speed dial on my cell phone.  I don't go here very often, but when I do, it's usually when I'm already out and about.  I can call, walk over and have a fresh burger waiting for me.  The burgers are big and juicy, instead of dried out like most other burgers.  The topping selection is excellent where you can choose toppings such as gorgonzola, avocado, and caramelized onions.  I'm not sure why they don't offer bacon.  It's definitely a downside.  The fries are crispy and not too greasy/salty.  Poutine here is pretty good too.  You should be prepared to order your food to go as seating is very limited.  And if you want a burger during the dinner rush hour, definitely call ahead!"}
{"text":"This is not your average burger place, but it won't be the best also. It's a great place to eat normal or gourmet burgers as they are using fresh beef, and cooking them after you ordered. Taste is good, but I feel that they are a bit pricey for the quality.  The last time I went, I took some onion rings, but unlike other Yelpers, I didn't like them at all. The service is good if you consider that they cook them as the customers ordering them.  A great burger place, nothing more."}
{"text":"I went there as I heard they serve Halal burgers...well I was there to check it out today. Firstly they charge about a $1.25 for a halal patty. They do have beef and chicken patty. We were two so we ordered one each. We ordered the Big smoke burger and Spicy chicken burger.   Lets start with the taste, the beef tasted ok... I have had better but their chicken tasted good.  The patties were good but the bun was too thin to hold the burger together. Both burgers were cooked properly and were still juicy, they also put sauteed onions on top which help out as they put a tiny bit of lettuce leaf. The fries were to die for they tasted smokey and were very enjoyable.   All in all its a decent joint to have a burger and enjoy some food."}
{"text":"Not a bad burger, but nothing to write home about. I personally wouldn't call their burgers \"gourmet\" and I think that the price is a bit hefty for what you really get. ($30 for 2 burgers and fries)  Fries were tasty, gravy was salty. I get better buns at the grocery store."}
{"text":"everybody talking about the best poutine in toronto and best place around the bloor and yonge its the solution foe you ive been using for a long time but its my first review you can trust here but its important ifyou want to eat burger and you like as well-done please say it to cashier"}
{"text":"Had the simple classic. Single patty with all the toppings. If memory serves me correctly, it was around $6.50 for the burger. (Cheapest on the menu). For an additional $4. you can combo your meal with fries and a drink. The burger itself was juicy and the bun fresh. I just wish you could still get a decent burger for a lot less. $24. for two burgers two fries, and two drinks is alot to me. Besides that, I recommend trying them as a different option in the foodcourt."}
{"text":"I work in the area and always exceptional burgers and service. Today we walked in at 810pm and it's a Friday night... The girl at the counter told us no fries because they're closing at 9pm...and no milkshake as the machine was broken... Waiting for food 10 minutes pass by and all of a sudden the milkshake machine was working but there was no chocolate ice cream... So were there no fries or the staff (with long hair and no hair nets) didn't feel like making more... Kinda like the milkshake machine??"}
{"text":"I'm not really sold on this place. It's meant to be an AMAZING burger, but I didn't get that at all.  I paid extra for organic meat and didn't taste the difference (no surprise, \"organic\" in North America is not the same as \"organic\" in Europe), and I just wasn't excited by the burger like I thought I would be.  I'll have to give it another shot and perhaps another review, but for now, I make better burgers at home."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers.   Because burgers are cooked as orders come in, you may wait for 10-15 min.   Best to eat there. I've ordered it as a take out, and by the time I got back to my office, the burger had become soggy due to steam build up in the wrapper."}
{"text":"I tried this place a couple times ,It's really nothing to write home about...I don't understand why so many people rave about it. if you like overcooked burger with cool toppings this is the place for you.  There are better places to get a burger in town"}
{"text":"Not for vegetarians. We need a vegetarian burger restaurant in Square one mall. They cook vegetarian patties on the same grill they cooked meat on. Not acceptable at all."}
{"text":"I came back here after a long hiatus for no reason in particular and boy was I disappointed.    The burger I had was essentially toppings and a giant bun.  I don't understand what the point is to add $2 fee to get a chicken patty when it is a sliver and really tough poor quality chicken.  The amount of salt and sauce made the burger really gooey and I had to leave half on the table.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"Gotta love how the owner is commenting on all these reviews, yet in most cases doesn't address the direct concerns. Many of these reviews discuss the small portions, yet she never says there are talks of changing this. I get that everything is made in house, and this can be a way to stand out from your competitors, but when you serve burgers as small as yours, that distinction immediately goes away. Your largest sized burger is 5oz? Are you kidding me? They opened this establishment willingly with the knowledge that McDonalds, Five Guys, and South Street are all in very close vicinity, and yet they still want to rip you off, assuming people won't mind paying a premium price for an average meal. You simply don't do that! I don't want you to email me to \"make it right\", I want you to listen to what everyone is saying and actually make this place worth the money! There is a reason the average rating is 2 stars, maybe you should start listening to the people who keep you open."}
{"text":"Last night in Toronto and I needed to try poutine. Hit the spot. I got a small and it was pretty substantial. Thank god for cheese curds"}
{"text":"Craft is on my list of favorite burgers spots in toronto. Even though I give props to any place that asks how you like your burger done and this place doesn't,  it makes up for everything else in flavor, choice toppings, fries, onion rings and overall dining experience.  I always get something with blue cheese or avocado and I leave satisfied all the time. I would rate Allen's burger patty higher than this place, but I'd still prefer to go to Craft on any given day.  Only thing is the place is quite small and can get packed fast so I only go off peak if the craving hits me."}
{"text":"Went here after work and ordered the Craft Burger with fries. The burger was prepared quickly and the service was average. The toppings were great which made up for the slight lack of taste in the beef patty. Price is comparable to other burger joints in the area."}
{"text":"As far as Veggie Burgers go, Craft burger puts forward a solid option, with plenty of toppings to choose from. However, I can't say I've been back to savor it again.  Buns are nothing too special, either. The atmosphere on a Sunday afternoon is nothing like that at Sat 2am, so I've heard.  Pleasant atmosphere. And in my quest to find the best poutine, I have to admit to eating it here, too.  A totally poutine-y experience.  This was probably the highlight with lots of cheese curds going slightly melty over the mostly crispy, yummy fries.  Maybe 3 and 1/2 stars for that."}
{"text":"gotta downgrade this place having had lunch here recently. Not much changed food wise but the price of my blue burger combo went up from $12+ to $14+. That's practically a 20% increase in a couple of months. It's a bit pricey for lunch in a food court."}
{"text":"Try the Big Smoke Spicy (formerly known as the Craft Spicy) - check!  One of the things I really wanted to try while in Toronto is the Spicy Burger - I've heard so many good things about it including a person wanting to make love to it and have its babies.    Well, it is pretty good.  The burger patty itself is thick and juicy and spurting with hot juices.  The bun is soft and flavourful.  The carmelized onions are a nice touch.  Unfortunately the sauce is not quite as spicy or flavourful as I would have liked.  My husband thought this was a good thing since it allowed for the burger flavour to shine.  But, I would have preferred a little more zip.  Although this location is a little further from my place than the one in yorkville, it is nice to walk to this location since there is more seating and doesn't seem quite as busy.    Ahhh ... I LOVE BURGERS!!!!"}
{"text":"Sad, skinny, dried out burger. No flavour. Fries and rings are the same. $35 for 2 people. Don't bother"}
{"text":"I don't get excited too often about burgers, but this place has the best hamburgers in town. I'm not sure if it's the beef, or combination of add-ons, or it might even be just the bun. However, combined it is absolutely the top shelf burger five stars all the way I enjoyed the SPICY, a burger that has a jalapeño mayo and fresh jalapeños. It was absolutely delicious. The music is a little ghetto, but I guess they want the young crowd. It's a decent price for high quality. I watched the girl cooking it stab it with a thermometer, I felt like she really cared about perfection, because that's exactly what it tasted like."}
{"text":"The place is small, with limited seating available, but it's in a great busy location.  The burger itself is just ok, it could be juicer and needs a tad more seasoning.  In my opinion, Burger Priest is still the best.  The poutine is decent here, a good ratio of curds to fries.  Better than Smokes, but not as good as Poutinis."}
{"text":"Take my review with a grain of salt... I had the veggie burger.  This place was decent! Really friendly service, good music (maybe a bit loud), and delightful onion rings. The least impressive part was the most important part though... the veggie burger was a little lacklustre. There aren't that many great veggie burgers out there and this was just another run of the mill veggie burger. Not much flavour to it beyond it's natural soyness.   Really delightful onion rings though. The batter was crunchy but still thick enough to give it some chew. They were fried to golden perfection. The only downside is my current onion breath... but there's no avoiding that. You can bet I won't be kissing anyone tonight.   Probably worth checking this place out for its beef burgers, but I wouldn't get too excited if you're coming here as a vegetarian."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed by their burgers at all! I tried their Double Big And their  Lamb sandwiches. Both were ok but I've had way better burgers before! The price is also almost high for such relatively small sandwiches."}
{"text":"Craft Blue for the win! I mean Gorgonzola, avocado,lettuce, tomato and rosemary garlic mayo. MMMMMM. I've only been there once but I thought it was a good experience. The place was crowded but we got lucky to get a seat quite quickly. I had my 1st boylan and it worked well with my burger. My gf thought we didn't get enough fries/onion rings but I thought it was enough. I was there for the burger! Will I go again? Yeah probably. But it's a tad expensive for burgers imo. But yummy. Show me better!"}
{"text":"Awesome Burger. Can't complain. However, do not get their fries because it is literally $4.25 for a small bowl of fries which is not worth it. I got the Spicy Burger with extra spicy sauce. This is juiciest burger I have ever had. Also ordered a bottle of water my total comes to $14.75 including tax. I will definitely go again. But next time, I will drink up and order the burger only."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had a better burger. Delicious, fresh, with inspired ingredients and great service. Expect to wait a bit  (the place was pretty busy) and go on an off-day from your diet."}
{"text":"Not inedible, but way too expensive for what you're getting. Also so slow, service can be dicey or good depending on when you go, which has become never now that there are so many more convenient/value friendly alternatives."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken Burger with a side of onion rings and it was very good! I was really impressed. It was fresh and the onion rings were just off the charts! Soooo good! The service is a bit slow but it was worth the wait! The place was clean, even during the time when it was rush hour. The price for my food was decent, so I have no complaints here!  Will come back again but next time i want to order their Poutine!"}
{"text":"I had the Jerk Chicken sandwich combo. The taste was pretty decent and the chicken was cooked very well. Not over done or under cooked. The combo came with onion rings and a drink. While the food taste was decent, it was quite over priced in my opinion. $15 for a sandwich, onion rings and a drink!?  I suggest trying once. I will eat here regularly though."}
{"text":"I ordered the Craft burger and added Havarti because I do not believe in burgers without cheese, no matter how good the meat is. The burger was good, but there was too much rosemary garlic mayo on it, making the burger sloppy and somewhat overpowering its flavor.  The meat was cooked more than I would have liked, as I always order medium-rare, but it didn't seem to be an option here. It had a very smokey flavor, appropriately, but I couldn't really taste the actual flavor of the meat. The fries were delicious, and come nicely portioned.  Overall, it was  a good burger. Certainly a bit different than your average. I would probably go back to try one of their other offerings."}
{"text":"I finally tried Craft Burger after reading about it a lot so my hopes were very high. I wasn't disappointed. The burger was cooked just right and the fries were very good, nice and freshly cut. That being said, it is still just a burger joint so don't go in expecting to taste anything incredibly different than you'd get anywhere else. What Craft Burger does, they do well. But beef is beef and it all comes down to how its cooked and the kinds of toppings you get. I just had a simple cheeseburger this time around but I am looking forward to going back and trying some of the more elaborately topped ones. If you like burgers, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I have embarked on a burger hunt to find my favourite gourmet burger and Big Smoke had been bookmarked for a long time. Sure, I see them at Eaton's Centre, but it just doesn't feel right eating a gourmet burger at a food court you know?  So I got the Blue Burger which came with gorgonzola, avocado, rosemary garlic mayo, tomato & lettuce. I was sooo pleased with the generous fix ins for the burger and the awesome sauce flavour combinations! I do wish that drinks here can be cheaper though, since burgers and fries does make you thirsty, but I don't want to shell out 3-4 bucks for a pop =/  Also had a few bites of my bf's poutine. Nothing spectacular. Stick to the burgers =)"}
{"text":"Was excited to check out a new burger joint in the York Mills area....Big Smoke Burger. Talk about BIG MISTAKE!!!! Ordered the Blue for takeout. Toppings looked good on the menu but wasn't too pleased at the soggy mess I came home too. ..I mean the bun  wasn't even edible. Plus my burger was rare mid rare if that!!! Never again!!"}
{"text":"The first time I ate at this Craft Burger I ponied up extra for the organic meat but ended up with a rather flavourless burger.  The next time I got one that in my opinion was severely undercooked.  I ended up taking it back and got a pretty aggressive response from the management and the chef - and was told that this is how they do them, that I should have asked for it well done, etc.  Having never been asked how I'd like my hamburger prepared in the past and seeing as they never asked me when I placed the order then I was obviously at fault.  I like my burgers and will travel far to get a good one but in this case I'd actually prefer an A&W burger to a Craft Burger - sorry."}
{"text":"Was pretty impressed with this Burger. Great toppings, taste,  and size. I recommend the onion rings. There are alot of better burgers in town like bareburger around the corner. But it's a great fast food gourmet type place to eat."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. I enjoy it for the poutine, which has REAL cheese curds and delicious gravy (of course), and Craft Blue (Gorgonzola, avocado, lettuce, tomato and rosemary garlic mayo)..   Staff  The Staff are friendly and are always smiling. They always take your name and give your experience a more personal feel.   Fresh  Everything is made fresh on the spot. You can literally watch them make your food from scratch. Delicious!   Price  The prices are not unreasonable. The Poutine is $4.95 and my fav burger is $6.95. The Onion rings, not to be left out are $2.95 - breaded and absolutely a must try.  Location  I also love the location. King St W, is my neighbourhood and I love stopping by there on my way home... Did I mention they are open until 11pm on Friday and Saturday? Yup... perfect pre/post pub snack.  Enjoy everything the Craft has to offer."}
{"text":"Yeah this place rocks! I must have eaten at a dozen burger joints but these guys make the best tasting burgers above everywhere else.  For starters, it's in Square One shopping mall. Sure it gets busy in the eating area but either I put up with it or I arrive before or after the lunchtime rush crowd. Yes they are in other shopping malls but Mississauga is where I hang out.  Order up your hand-crafted burger, side orders, or just do what I do - Get a rock-solid , juicy cheeseburger and put some toppings on it. I could always order one of their specialty burgers but why change the taste on something classic? It gets a little sloppy after but it's completely my fault from all the toppings I put on it. I guess that's what the tissues are for.  I'm telling you right now - when I really want a cheeseburger, I am willing to drive across town find a parking spot at Square One, walk all the way into the centre and line up at Big Smoke Burger just to make my order. Big Smoke Burger is the only one that has the flavour I'm looking for.   A word of advice to the mgmt: Listen to some of the reviews that could really make an impact on improving service. Sounds like there are some outstanding issues that need to be addressed here and I think if all your employees keep on with making key adjustments on communication and efficiency then it will really make a difference. Good luck and hope to see you for the long haul!  For more reviews and food blogging, check out my blog at https://spicychopsticks.blog"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised for a food court meal. I had the little poutine (I thought they had given me the large because it was so huge). Was delicous. Would recommend."}
{"text":"It's pricey, I'll admit that. However... the burgers are amazing. The burgers are... amazing. I'm serious! And their milkshakes are great too!   Seating is pretty good, I always feel pretty lucky to grab seats for two when I drop by with a friend."}
{"text":"Great location. Friendly staff. Orders are usually fulfilled quickly - I go for lunch- and it's been pretty consistent. The only downsides for me is that it gets chilly in here and the seating sucks. To clarify, I'm short and when I'm sitting the table is at the top of my chest- no exaggerating I feel like a child. It's very uncomfortable and I hope they fix this or at least provide us with some booster seats  will be back!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars  The restaurant certainly looks better than your average burger joint but I disliked the crowding of the tables - so hard to get in and out of the seating area.  I decided to try some of the healthier options on this visit (my second visit) - the grilled chicken burger and a side salad.   The side salad was huge but was 95% lettuce. Where are the tomatoes? cucumbers? etc? Not looking for exotic toppings, just the basics. Only one dressing option... well I guess I will order that! Kudos for the size but at $4.50,  there should be more than lettuce.   They don't sell a chicken burger but you choose one of the hamburger options and pay $2 to get a grilled chicken patty instead of beef. My burger was huge with the toppings I selected but the chicken was way over cooked, dry with a burnt grill taste.  With a diet coke, my meal was $17 for fast food. WTF? It certainly is more expense to pick the healthy options.  PS - I know from my last visit that the fries are excellent and the burger's better than the chicken burger (but burgers were still overcooked). Both people I ate with on this visit thought their burgers were overcooked as well.  In no rush to return (well maybe for fries / onion rings). I will stick with my Harvey's burger at 1/3 the price.  BK"}
{"text":"I am glad they opened up this location as its just walking distance from my place (or maybe it used to be open I never tried it) anywho I just passed by it and decided to try it. I ordered my regular craft burger with a side of onion rings and ginger ale. Service was ok as expected. Onion rings were great and the burger was good as well. I dunno what the other people are complaining about what do you expect for a meal at this price. It seems at par with their other spot in Yorkville."}
{"text":"Good burgers. We were at the Toronto Film Festival and stop in between movies. It was packed. (Don't go during lunchtime) After we finally found a seat (make sure if you are with someone that they go get a seat while you order), and had a nice juicy burger in Toronto. It was a little expensive but good. Don't go at lunch if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"The taste is awesome. We had Swiss melt($8.5) & Hogtwon ($11) both are juicy and delicious."}
{"text":"My friend and I was walking around the neighbourbood looking for a place to eat and decided to try this place out. The burger took a while to come so I wouldn't recommend coming if you are in a hurry. I enjoyed the onion rings which came in a good portion. Their wooden tables are kind of low which means that some \"larger\" people might have trouble sitting in them, think kiddy sized tables!"}
{"text":"good burger but not great like it was when Big Smoke only had a couple of locations.  Staff was very friendly and service very good but its over priced for what it is we wont go back there are many better alternatives."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! Why didn't anyone think of it? I don't eat burgers at restaurants or at BBQ's, it's not healthy but I can't resist gourmet burgers from Craft.  So juicy and the ingredients are amazing! Cooked to perfection. Just love it!"}
{"text":"Working for a national retailer and being a vegetarian too, sometimes I feel as though I'm on a never ending quest to discover a great veggie burger.   This afternoon... I came pretty close.   Maybe it was my initial awe for TEC's new(ish) Urban Eatery concept. A large, open marketplace filled with familiar favorites and up and coming quick service restaurants. It's obvious that TEC is thinking forward (atmosphere, service, decor and selection) and trying desperately (and successfully) to distance themselves from anything remotely resembling a traditional \"food court\".   The setting aside... Big Smoke Burger is doing something right. Arguably the busiest restaurant in the eatery, their selection is HUGE and substitutions are welcomed! Friendly staff, personalized orders and the tastiest veggie burger I think I have ever experienced make this spot a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"This review is for vegetarians.  We ate at Big Smoke Burger tonight and had no complaints.  While I indulged in a full-on beef burger (hey, they source well so I was feeling no guilt) my husband had a veggie burger and fries and he was very happy.  The veggie burger is tasty and filling and can be ordered with any of the fun topping combos that come with the other burgers.  It's one of the veggie burgers that imitate regular ones, rather than going grainy or studded with veggies.  We thought it tasted a lot like the veggie burger at Hero Burger which is a big compliment, since we're both fans.  But the big side of fries really stole the show.  When I turned to my husband mid-meal to ask if he was enjoying, he answered, mouth full, \"Really good mummph harumm\"  \"Nuff said.  What I neglected to notice was if they cook the veggie burgers on a separate grill.  I'll look next time.  Vegetarian Score: 6/10.  Only one thing on the menu you can eat.  But it sure is tasty!"}
{"text":"Best fast food burger in Toronto. Don't believe all the hype about Burger's Priest; it is just a fancy-ish McDonald's burger for more money. For the same price, Big Smoke Burger is the real deal. Great quality meat, with a thick juicy patty and real cheese, not the plastic American stuff."}
{"text":"Two stars for the terrific French fries only, and those were too salty for my tastes. The veggie burger was totally inedible - cold, slimy, raw. Disgusting! The manager was kind enough to refund it through Ritual once she learned of the mistake. I may go back and try them again someday, though even if it is cooked properly next time, the recipe/ingredients still seem uninspired."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's a good burger joint. I love burgers. Nothing really bad to say other than maybe the price which can run you upwards of like $20.00 if you get a nice fat combo and tip."}
{"text":"Got a ginormous Craft Poutine. There's only one size and it seemed like it was for two people! Also I had a one time Ritual coupon that gave it 20% off, which was even better.  My only regret is that there's no smaller size.. but for what I got, it was huge and heart-stopping awesome.  This review is only for the poutine. I've had the burger here before too and it was pretty good too.  Quality: 8.5/10. Service: 8.5/10. Value: 8.5/10. Overall: 8.5/10."}
{"text":"Simple menu and great options! Fresh handmade burgers grilled to order. Also, great prices!!!! I enjoyed every last bite and will definitly be back."}
{"text":"It's my favourite time of year - Burger Week - so I stopped by at lunch today to see what burger special they had. The \"Green Goodness\" is 6oz. of ground chuck beef, goats cheese, roasted red peppers, lettuce and a pesto mayonnaise. Not sure where they got that name from, but don't be fooled into thinking it's in any way healthy for you!  After placing my order, I waited almost 20 MINUTES for my burger. Dear God, what were they doing in that kitchen!? Playing Candy Crush saga? Yeah it was lunch time, but I've seen it much busier before. When my order was called out, I grabbed my take-out bag and headed back to my work desk toot suite. My lunch hour was nearly over!  I was still a bit miffed until I took a bite... oh, what heaven that first bite was. Its like an angel from heaven landed in the kitchen of Big Smoke... where the chef killed it and ran it through the meat grinder. Any feelings of resentment instantly disappeared. I only wished at that point, that I had ordered some fries and gravy to go with my burger. It was over far too soon!"}
{"text":"I tried the Crazy burger (jalapenos, a bit of purple cabbage slaw, etc. etc.) and the onion rings. The latter were nice and crispy but I can't say I walked away very satisfied with the former. If you would like to buy 2 burgers and a side, the bill comes to about $30 which is a little on the pricey side for what you'd get, in my opinion (I personally consider myself to be more of a fan of Hero). To be fair, the menu is extensive and I may have just not had the best pick - perhaps I'll give Big Smoke its fair shot again sometime given its convenient Eaton Centre location. :)"}
{"text":"Just trying to enjoy a quick lunch. Guy swapped my friends burger with mine lol. Also took their luxurious time of 20 minutes to prepare my burger. By all means their burger is not bad, but for the price they charge  this kind of service is not redeemed."}
{"text":"Food: 7/10 -- Value: 7/10 -- Service: 9/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: N/A  Big Smoke Burger is not your typical cheap burger, but it also isn't anything special. It sits somewhere in the middle of the pack.   I feel like I'm the average consumer. I like junk food, burger and fries, and I only notice if they're at the polar extremes: really good or really bad. So for me, I couldn't tell you how this differs from Five Guys unless I were to eat them side by side, bite for bite.   I've had two of their signature burgers - Big Smoke Burger® and the Blue Burger. I can't remember what Big Smoke was like specifically other than that I liked it. That comes with horseradish mayo, caramelized onions, smoked cheddar, tomato, and lettuce.  The one I tried today was the Blue Burger, which comes with Gorgonzola, avocado, rosemary garlic mayo, tomato, and lettuce. As I tend to find with hot foods that come with avocado, it gets a little muddled. Warm avocado is not really its ideal state in my opinion, so the mushed avocado with the cheese comes together in a mehhhh kinda way. It's missing something.   They've streamlined the ordering a bit, with someone standing by the line taking orders on a tablet so they can start making the food and all you have to do is go to one of the cashiers to pay.   The burger was about $9 and the combo brought it to $14-15. Typical downtown food court prices, but last I tried, they offered free refills, which is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"I can go into full detail about my order and how the burger was about a 7/10. I can also ramble on about the great service.   But simply put, I wasn't 'WOW'd'. I didn't hit the big O, I didn't feel all tingly inside after eating my dinner...it was just a pretty good chicken burger.   If I happen to be on that particular street during mealtime and I happen to be craving a burger...I'd probably go again. Wouldn't go out of my way to go again though..."}
{"text":"Love it. Just go with the classic cheeseburger, or the Big Smoke Burger. I'm drooling just thinking about it. Maybe I'll head down there for lunch tomorrow; it's been a while.   Good quality meet, bun and fries are great too.   Had the lamb burger. Hated it. Stick to beef."}
{"text":"Probably the best Halal burger you can find in the city. Their fries are also great!"}
{"text":"Came on a monday evening. It's a small restaurant with 10 seats along with a few stools up at the counter. Lots of seating was available though as most people take it to-go.  You can build-your-own burger or pick one of their signatures. A few of their signature burgers come with spicy toppings. I enjoy spicy options, and haven't had spicy burgers before, so this was something new to me.  They were also advertising a limited time \"Cheesy Poblano Poutine\", so I got that as well.  The order was ready within 10 minutes, which seems a bit long but maybe there were other orders placed online.  Burger was smaller than I thought, but I liked the flavor. Especially the sauce that comes in the \"Spicy Burger\". Patty was also juicy and full of meat.  The poutine was premium sized, so it came in a large box. Fries were nice and crispy, and the Pico de Gallo that they put on top was a good complement."}
{"text":"Not the best burgers, way too squishy and soft. Theres alot of vegetarian options but nothing super flavourful and good. I probably won't come back.  They have a couple of locations, in Niagara and Toronto. Prices are high too, almost 12$ for a combo."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick meal at the Urban Eatery and since I had read about Big Smoke Burger from Chowhound I decided to give them a try.   I went with their basic burger (fully loaded except mayo) plus fries and bottled water ($10.85 tax incl).  My burger had a \"hint\" of pink, but looked safe to eat (hopefully).   Very happy with the taste of the burger and since I went early in the lunch-hour (11:30) the seating and overall ambiance was very civil."}
{"text":"I was pretty hungry when driving by the place as I'd missed dinner. In spite of the fairly mediocre rating on Yelp, I still went in since I was so hungry and it was on my way home.  I agree with the consensus that it is overpriced - though only a little and not grossly overpriced as others feel since the food quality was very good.  The beef was cooked to order and looked fresh and hand-pressed. I wish I took a pic and I'm not 100% of what I ordered, but I'm pretty sure I got the blue burger, which is topped with Gorgonzola, garlic-rosemary mayo and avocado. I opted for slaw instead of lettuce, and let me tell you: that decision was a winner. It's funny that the slaw isn't done with any of their burgers because it stood out the most and what really pushed it to being a great burger. I opted to make it with red cabbage and it was perfectly marinated with just the right amount of brine and crunch to it. I know the slaw is taking up half my review at this point, but it was soo good!  You are likely to spend close to $15 if you get a combo - or more if you choose beer (naturally)...oh, tip: they serve beer. Once you eat the food, you realise it's not terribly overpriced, but they could do a little better at reducing the cost of some of the toppings."}
{"text":"The place at Leslie and York Mills took over from a Country Style and some things remain. The burger itself is good - fresh ground beef of a good grade. The people are nice and the buns are higher quality than most. The problem is the environment. The seating area is one brightly lit room with a floor that has vestiges of something that has been removed with black marks all over the place. The general area is not very clean and I saw no cleaning being done though there was a collection of cleaning stuff on a table and an open stepladder. The washrooms are individual and the one I was in was a loser. I was there at 8 pm and there was a checklist for cleaning at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. The boxes were checked at 1 and 3 only. So between 3 and 8 a few people used it and not everyone was careful. And the cleaning tools and plunger are on the floor. There were some other things but if I don't have to choose between a good burger and a place that needs fixing in several ways."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed in my meal. First it took a long time to get to me. My burger was sitting there ready, just waiting for my poutine and the server fills someone else's order which is just fries. The poutine was good when I finally got it but the burger was only ok. Very expensive and, in my opinion, not worth the price tag."}
{"text":"This place is rock solid. You'll spend a bit more then Harveys or McDonalds but you'll easily get your money's worth. As schmancy burger places go I consider this place to be the gold standard.  Service is quick. Side order servings are both tasty and sizeable. The burgers taste good and you won't go broke getting extra toppings. I almost never go without getting one of their milkshakes and for a pretty small location, this particular venue sits on the right side of the line between cramped and cozy. You might get a little cold sitting by the front window in the wintertime, but that's why God invented jackets and had his warhost of archangels sell them to us through major retail outlets.  Honestly, you won't get a better burger & etc meal in downtown Toronto without spending more than $15."}
{"text":"Ok, admittedly, I would have given this place a solid 3 (for their plain burger) or a 4 (for their gourmet creations) BEFORE I knew Burger Priest existed.    There are two types of burgers: 1) FRESH BEEF.  Cooked medium or medium rare because they grind the beef themselves.  This burger is ALWAYS juicy, ALWAYS simply seasoned, and almost always is greasy.   OR, 2) Topping focused burger- Where the joy is in how many gourmet toppings you can put on it (The patty itself may or may not be fresh beef; it may or may not be juicy- but the patty is USUALLY highly seasoned and the focus is on all that fancy aged cheese, guac, smoked bacon etc)  Craft Burger does FINE in the second category but PALES in comparison if you just want to talk about quality of patty.  The ONION RINGS are 4.5 stars though.  Definitely top 5 in the city.  And the staff..the staff sometimes look like they hate their lives...   -points for an effort to make a nice interior though.  I will have to try their veggie burgers and if they are any good I will up it to 3 stars.   (Veggie burgers are a very different beast altogether)"}
{"text":"I'm starting to feel like I'm rolling the dice and hoping for the best each time I come here. The burgers are inconsistant and starting to get progressively worse. I have already been in the hunt for a good burger place and only come here if I'm in the area. It is better than most burger places but can't help but feel that it used to be much much better.  Again. Too much ketchup!! I must remember to hold the ketchup and put it on myself."}
{"text":"The good: Their fries and onion rings were on point, though the rings could have used some seasoning. Nothing a pinch of salt won't solve.   The bad: The Big Smoke burger was boring. Patty was overcooked and bland, even the horseradish mayo and caramelized onions couldn't resuscitate the burger. That meat was dead I tells ya.  The Ugly: $14 for an average burger  Always on the hunt for great burgers, I passed by Big Smoke on Friday on a friend's recommendation. He said this was the best burger in Toronto, well, he's full of smoke!  You get a relatively thick patty done up on a grill, but the burger came out overcooked. Browned through and through.   I'm the kinda guy who likes their burgers a bit pink inside and I'm a flattop kinda guy, so if browned through over a flame is your thing, then give this a shot. But it's pretty much a more expensive version of Harvey's in my books.   The Big Smoke Burger came with caramelized onions and horseradish mayo, but the mayo didn't have much horseradish in it, which was disappointing.   The friends and rings are good, though the rings weren't seasoned."}
{"text":"Decent quality burger joint. Better than your standard chain restaurants (McDonald, Burger King, hero burger).  It's good enough to satisfy my burger craving. I'd eat it if I were in the area, but if it wasn't ... I wouldn't go out of my way to eat it."}
{"text":"I work near the King St. location, and Craft Burger is a common lunch time destination for me. I don't think the burgers are bad by any means, but my socks have stayed firmly on-- I wish that it had knocked my socks off. Don't get me wrong: the burgers, freshly prepared and with occasionally unusual ingredients, are worth the price, but I never walked away amazed by the quality or deliciousness of them."}
{"text":"Thanks to the Yelp App, a friend and I found this place and were so thrilled with our order! It's a small place that resembles a bit of a hole in the wall, but the burgers are fresh, made to order and really, really good. I had a lamb burger with cilantro feta something or other, in a lettuce wrap with salad greens. It was fantastic, and the next time I'm in this area I wouldn't hesitate to run back for more delicious burgers!"}
{"text":"Their craft burger with cheese is very good. Their fries however are too dark and soggy.  Their service is super fast. They are able to produce an amazing output rate even with long lineups @rush hour. Less than 5 min is standard. Pretty much unbeatable.  Big Smoke Burger is supposed to be a chain, meaning it should taste the same at every location. But this is not the case. The craft burger at this location tastes much better than the same burger at Big Smoke Burger on 50 King St. E. I have tried it multiple times at both locations.  The location itself however is not as good and cozy as the one on 50 King St. E. Since it is part of the food court, it is crazy busy and loud.  I still prefer this location and longer travel just for the burger though."}
{"text":"Now this is how you do a burger right.  I started going here when it was still \"Craft Burger\" and while the name changed, the burgers blissfully haven't. It's a bit of a wait, 8-10 minutes on average from the time you place your order to the time you actually get it but it's worth it.  The burger is hot, served with your choice of toppings or you can choose one of the standards on the board. I've had them all and they're all good.   The fries are excellent. Hot, crisp and brown.  A little ketchup and they're ready to eat.  All in all it's the place I go to when I'm in Yorkville and want a burger. It's a little pricey but you need to expect having to pay for quality."}
{"text":"One day my friend and I found ourselves at Craft Burger in Yorkville after visiting the ROM. I'd heard they have amazing burgers and I thought they would have an equally as awesome veggie burger too, but NOPE.  Upon entering the store, we found ourselves in a clean, semi-trendy yet casual dining room that consisted of wooden wall panels/ benches.  The cashier/ server who greeted us was really friendly and knowledgeable about their food items,  told me their buns were not vegan friendly and suggested I have the burger on a bed of lettuce instead. So I did as she suggested and the veggie patty literally came on a bed of JUST lettuce and topped with some onion, a slice of tomato and a slice of pickle. I've had veggie burgers on a \"bed of lettuce\" before, but they are normally a spring mix rather than just lettuce. The patty itself was bad, it was rubbery, stiff and hard to cut into.   I'm not sure if I'll go back to Craft Burger for their veggie burger. The price ($6.95) is kind of steep for something so crappy. I had better veggie burgers for free."}
{"text":"Quick assessment-- great hand cut fries and really great onion rings. Juicy burgers.  Probably the best onion rings I've ever had and I've had a few.  The fries were like you make at home if you have that much time. The burgers were really good, cooked med well but still juicy.   We went when it was slow and the service was friendly (maybe under stress they aren't ?!? ) and quick.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I had a a blue burger with organic patty to satisfy a craving for a burger with blue cheese. The burger was served with a somewhat cold bun (aren't they supposed to toast or warm the bun on the grill?). This really ruined the meal. Also, the meat wasn't as juicy as I remembered it. I felt I had a better burger at A&W. Will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Great burgers, but the wait is kind of long.  After you place your order it's another 10-15 minutes before you actually get your burger which doesn't make it ideal if you're in a rush to grab and go.  The staff are for the most part friendly if not hipster.  I like the Big Smoke Burger.  My rule is always \"if they're willing to put their name on it, it must be good.\"  Not sure if you can call ahead and order, but if you can, I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Have to say.....Love at first bite ~  It is hard to describe what makes a good burger. For me I HATE lettuce, I HATE tomato, I don't even like ketchup, but I LOVE cheese, and I love mustard sauce.  Also I love lamb burger and there was once they ask me how i what my burger done ( not sure if that is hero's ), I said medium almost burst in tears.   So as you can see, I have a wired taste of burger, better just stick with  steak ~~  I ordered the Big smoke burger, hard to go wrong since it has the store name in it ..... the burger is very juicy with a good BBQ sauce taste, between too little to make the burger taste plain and too much to taste like Chinese herb medicine, just perfect. We a very little touch of mustard sauce, so balance the meat taste , LOVE IT.  Onion rings and fries are both very crispy ~  The root beer surprised me more. It tasted like some soda I had when I was 5 still in China. Globalization lol.  I am really interested in their lamb burger to. Marked it down.   My friend ordered spicy burger, he had his comments, but I try to get him start to review places on Yelp, so that I will leave it :D"}
{"text":"Craft burger looks to be the love child of a mba marketing grad and a gourmet foodie.....with burgers and sides designed to appeal to our inner child however with more grown up sensibilities. Burgers are grilled to order with a good charred crust and using a fresh patty that is lacking in the juicyness department perhaps from not enough fat in the mix as the patty is slightly dry. However, all the other accessories to a successful burger are in play here from the expansive sturdy seasame seed bun, wide slices of tangy pickles and smoked cheddar on the cheeseburger provides a nice oomph of flavor. Condiments here have a gourmet touch, there is blue cheese, specialty mayos, dijon mustard and avocado available and boylan's flavoured sodas on hand as refreshment. I did enjoy my burger here, think this really appeals to those who want a quality burger however given the price tag and the wait times, this may be a burger joint reserved for special comfort/junk food sessions."}
{"text":"We visited the Yonge Street location because I'm a sucker for poutine and my very American fiance wanted a burger. I ordered the craft poutine and asked to have the rosemary-garlic mayo on the side, which the cashier struggled to understand--she kept thinking I didn't want any of it. When we asked if they served Coke or Pepsi, she just vaguely waved at the soda machine.  That said, they gave me a hearty helping of the mayo in a cup, which was a great creamy, herbaceous compliment to the poutine. The fries are the real star this restaurant; they've got slightly crisp skins on the outside, soft insides, and just the right amount of salt. They also added plenty of gravy and mushrooms, though I would've liked a few more cheese curds to balance things out. My fiance's Beast burger was fine. The flavor was good, but it was a little greasy and leaked all over his tray quite a bit.   The prices are a bit higher than what I'm used to paying for poutine and burgers, but the portions are hearty. I couldn't finish all of my poutine.  The benches and chairs are not particularly comfortable, though, especially if you're walking upwards of 10 miles a day like we were."}
{"text":"Based on Lindsey S's review of the poutine, I went back to get an order. I was NOT disappointed! The poutine was so ooey gooey good. I was shovelling it into my mouth so quickly on the train up to Yorkdale that the couple across from me gave me a weird look as I realized cheese strands were stuck to my chin. Was I embarrassed? No. I didn't care if they were all up in my poutine experience! I again felt withdrawal when the warm box it came in started to get cold as each forkful got me closer to the end. But oh, what an experience that was..*nostalgic smile on face*"}
{"text":"Small neighbourhood type place, a good stop for a quick bite to eat that isn't $$$ (like everything else in the area). However the bit was not as quick.   With an extensive menu, that takes about at least 3-5 minutes to read, you can choose from Lamb, Veggie, Organic Beef burger.  They have pre-made ones or you can add your own toppings like carmelized onions and sauteed mushrooms and avacado.   I made the mistake of ordering a plain Beef burger ($7.65) and added a bunch of toppings with ended up with a cost of over $14 for my burger.    What I should have done was ordered one of the pre-made ones (7.65 - 8.65) and just omitted some toppings and maybe added one or two of my own.  The flavoured mayos looked really tasty, but I'm on a non-dairy diet. booo.  For another, $3.50 you can get fries or Onion rings (they were good!) + water/pop or add $4.95 and you can get the same, but with the Boylan Sodas (sugar cane flavoured soda, was okay).  Seating here is minimal, seems like most do take out. It's not quick. At least 8-10 min wait (they state this on the menu) for the burger, so lots of people in the barstool area waiting around, reading the provided newspapers.   Would I come back? not my first choice....maybe. I do like Hero burger a bit more tho."}
{"text":"Burger was good, tasty, good value combo.  It's between gourmet and fast food. Still a good burger to enjoy just wish the selection was better."}
{"text":"Tight quarters for the number of people that try to squeeze through.  Not worth trying to sit down.  Decent selection of burgers. Will have to give the crazy burger a try next time. Onion rings were ok, but prefer the fries."}
{"text":"I love Craft burger so hearing there was one so close to work, I knew I had to take a lunch hour to check it out. They still seem to be working out the kinks: there was no sign on the outside, they only had fries as a side option today, and the upstairs dining area was closed off. But the space is nice with a lot more seating than the Yonge location in an open warehouse-like feel (If I watched more HGTV, I'd know specific terms).  I figured with a new location, I would try a new burger, Big Smoke. It was really good. The meat was classic Craft - juicy and full of flavour. I also like the combination of smoked cheddar and carmelized onions.   I would probably wait a bit longer to dine in but the food and location are  great for take-out lunch. I just finished my meal yet the Greed in me still wants another burger. I hope Greed doesn't take over--that Big Smoke already makes me feel like taking a nap instead of getting back to work."}
{"text":"The organic burger was too dry. Not enough fat. I'm not sure if I want to try the other menu items."}
{"text":"Ordered the organic burger because for some reason, I'm super into organic food this week. One of my weird weeks (I usually go healthy, unhealthy, Asian, salad and soup and only have one of those for the entire week).  Not sure why I do that.  Anywho, I digress.    The burger tasted good and had an okay bun - slighty soft, but it wasn't anything special.  As for the beef itself, it was juicy, but didn't have too much flavour.  I can say it's better than McDonald's and BK, but I think Lick's is better.  It was almost $11 for the burger and a ginger ale, which is kind of pricey.  However, I don't mind trying new things. Also, even though this was a fast food joint, the service was good.  They said it would take 7 minutes and being the nerd I am, I timed it and it took less than 4.    Love the fact that they give you a heads up.  Not bad burger, but not awesome."}
{"text":"Just had their classic burger with frings. The burger and frings were alright but it's definitely not worth paying $15 for a combo. The burgers are quite thin. Who cares if they're homemade. If there's no meat to taste then what's the point. The prices are ridiculous. Overrated!"}
{"text":"I work near the Eaton Centre and was looking for some tasty for lunch one day. Urban Eatery just opened and I went there to look for something new to try.  Considering the numerous choices available, I decided to go with Big Smoke Burger for a lamb burger. After waiting in the long line-up, the cashier told me they were out of lamb burger so I made a quick decision for the Blue Burger instead.  I am a 115 lbs woman and the burger was quite big. But that's the only positive thing I can say about it for the price you pay for. At about $8, the burger wasn't very tasty. I rather have a burger from Hero or Harvey. The Blue Burger got avocado, gorgonzola and rosemary garlic mayo. Avocado sounds unique and something nice to have, but it didn't add much taste to the burger. The rosemary garlic mayo was nothing more than regular mayo IMO. I can definitely taste the gorgonzola but the whole burger still didn't provide much satisfaction taste wise. I did ask for hot sauce packages but they didn't have any. Maybe other burgers like the Spicy burger would have been better? But the Blue Burger wasn't much of a great buy IMO. I am usually a generous reviewer but I think I can get a better burger elsewhere, so therefore, sorry Big Smoke Burger, 2 stars."}
{"text":"Any burger joint that serves delicious, juicy grass-fed organic beef burgers, cooked to a perfect medium rare, and plays Led Zeppelin deserves no less than a 5/5.   If you're around Yorkville, and looking to have a burger, Big Smoke is a sure winner. Great food, great ambiance."}
{"text":"Overall good burger and fries, but the wait was so long just to get it. Overpriced also."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a Big Smoke Burger, fries and a water.    Now you can create your own burger with a fair selection of toppings.  But I was in a rush so I picked the Big Smoke.  I found my patty was properly cooked to order.  But there was a bit too much lettuce - I prefer my salad in a bowl and on the side.  The bun and the rest of the composition was tasty.  But the fries were a great disappointment.  They were slightly over cooked and cool when they arrived with my burger.  I will next time order the onion rings.  Granted you get fewer of them compared to the fries but I have yet to have bad rings at this location.   A final point to note.  The service is self serve.  You go and order you food and sit down.  But if there is a problem.  You will need to see them.  No one will come by to ask you how your meal was.  So if the food is sub par then I would suggest you go tell someone."}
{"text":"A study session at the Toronto Reference Library led to lunch here. After hearing positive reviews about this place, I had high expectations. A friend of mine even went so far to rank this place first, amongst all specialty burger joints.  I ordered the Craft Spicy combo and must say I was somewhat satisfied. The burger itself was nice and juicy, and you get a fair heaping of caramelized onions. I could've used a bit more spicy chipotle mayo, since I couldn't really taste it. What turned me off was the semi-cold bun. As for the onion rings, it had a bit too much batter for my liking, and only came with 6 pieces (which works out to be 50 cents per piece).  I would give this place another chance, but I think I'll forego any combos, and try the poutine next time."}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you are on a low carb diet. The organic beef burger is a healthy option. They can do a lettuce wrap for your burger so you can cut out the unnecessary carbs in the bread"}
{"text":"Always pass this place curious, was my first time visiting. Good menu options on the menu and top notch customer service from the girls working here. The food itself was excellent quality. The patties are a good filling size, everything was fresh and appetizing and full of flavour ."}
{"text":"I guess the thing is that I don't really like burgers? I've said it before and I'll say it again, someone \"up there\" means for me to be a vegetarian because, when I do eat meat, it has to be so abstracted from it's original form (i.e. McNuggets) to be edible. When I see real, meaty looking meat, I back away. I get all heeby-jeeby and I can't do it.   That said, I ordered a regular ole' cheeseburger, poutine and a chocolate milkshake. As is normally the case when I'm faced with the \"how would you like it done?\" question, I answered \"Umm....like, really, really well done. Like, you could hit something with it afterwards and it wouldn't break.\" So the burger, though apparently incinerated, was fine by my standards.   The poutine and the chocolate shake, though, were fan-tastic! One of the better poutine's I have had in the city.   Big Smoke Burger is small on the inside, with little room for frills. I guess the problem with lack of frills is that you wonder why you're paying $29 for two burgers when McDonald's would charge like $4 for the two AND you can play in the Play Place for free.   But, as I've said before, if you want quality, you spend. If you want post-bar or heartburn-inducing food, you go to McDonalds.   All in all pretty good."}
{"text":"Oh.....how my burger tastes have evolved..(not sure that's necessarily a good thing).  If you were to ask me to review this place two years ago, I would have given it four stars because all I knew was Harvey's, Lick's, BK and McProcessed Meats    Here's what I like about this place - burgers are cooked fresh, toppings are good and patties are very large, efficient service with the numbering.  What I don't like about this place: not a fan of the communal seating, considering that the place is very small, and still expensive even if it is a \"gourmet burger\".  At the same time, can it really be called a \"gourmet burger\" now that it has at least 5-6 locations?    Verdict: Good introduction to higher level burgers that don't cause you to puke afterwards, but there is better around the area - e.g. Capitano."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and everytime the quality gets worse.  Today had the 4 oz cheeseburger that was barely cooked.  It was dripping blood and was red inside and the staffed had to be informed.  It was not edible and I am very disappointed especially at these prices.  They did make us a new one but the damage was done.  Probably won't be back.  Burgers need to be cooked.   The other burger we ordered was very plain tasting."}
{"text":"Burger tastes good. 8/10. Drinks have square ice cubes which is a bonus. Onion rings are also good just not that many - why cheap out there? Burger also took a long time - 7 min for fast food but they warned me."}
{"text":"After a long and arduous reading session at the Reference Library, I decided to venture out back into the world on the search for dinner. Fortunately, I came across Craft Burger. I had the Craft Blue Burger which included the ingredients gorgonzola cheese, avocado and rosemary mayo. It was a bit messy to eat as the bread just fell apart and all the ingredients proceeded to go every where except into my mouth. Once they finally reached their destination though, I found that the flavors meshed well but for some reason there was a lack of zing. Also, I noticed that it was a bit pink on the inside.   {This is a small amendment to the earlier review}. Tried the Lamb Burger on another occasion and it was ooh soo tasty. There was this coriander spread that did the burger and my taste buds justice. I will be back for more.   * Please note this review is for the location that is just north of Bloor and Yonge."}
{"text":"Honestly, just look at the pictures.. they encapsulate the place pretty well.  I know a burger doesn't need to be pretty, but, this place just isn't good. The right burger is maybe a 3/5, but the poutine is atrociously soggy.  Def better options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Usually I'm all about rating food over atmosphere. And before this trip, we've gotten it to go. But tonight we are eating here and it sort of stinks in here, and the music is too loud coming out of a speaker that's not able to handle it! The burger was good - a bit undercooked for my taste, but really flavorful!"}
{"text":"This was a great fast food gourmet burger. You can make it to order how you like it. They prepare it in front of you and you can watch as it cooks. The fries were equally as yummy and tasty. Price was on the higher end but it matches the quality. The decor was simple to non existent. Plain tables and chairs, nothing fancy. Lots of parking but not easy access from York Mills west bound, had to turn south on Leslie."}
{"text":"This place was directly across the street from the hotel I was staying at. Service was friendly and quick. I tried the veggie burger it was quite delicious. You customize your burger right at the counter where you pay. Then they bring the food out to your table. I recommend the onion rings they were my favorite!"}
{"text":"Past...   I remember when the first Craft Burger came on King street and many months after I decided to track my way to the location in a FREEZING Winter's night from Yonge street. Walking inside, I felt like a Hobo finding an warm air vent. Specialty Burger Joints were somewhat new to the scene and Craft Burger did satisfy. Not only that but the Onion Rings were also enjoyable....   Present Day....   A Craft Burger hasn't changed at all. It's me who has changed, along with the onslaught of upscale Burger shops. I'm sorry Craft Burger, but what I'm looking for in a Burger you show elements of it but missing the seasoning factor of your AAA Beef Patty. I know it's good to keep the natural flavour of Beef and you do that well, however to enhance it to make a customer salivate and not put a Burger down. That is the ultimate goal.  Craft Burger, you'll still A-OK in my books."}
{"text":"I think they used to be called Craft burger? Anywho, Big smoke burger offers a great \"craft\" burger...no frozen patty here!   After the cashier took my order she ran to the back to smash out some more patties...so I sat at the bar and curiously watched my burger being cooked to excellence. It takes a little longer then most places, but understandably so...its fresh!!!  Topped with caramelized onions, lettuce tomato and some sort of havarti...this was the smoke burger.   To sum it up....it didn't need any toppings, it was that good!"}
{"text":"The new food court is pretty cute. Very bright and clean looking with a nice patio. We browsed all the options and couldn't agree on anything so eventually we just went to the closest place which happened to be Big Smoke Burger.  The Blue Burger, though, caught my eye because it had Gorgonzola, avocado, and garlic mayo. Three of my favorites. I got it as a combo with onion rings and diet coke. It was done super quick which made me happy. There was a super thick slice of delicious mouldy cheesy goodness which scores major points as I'm a blue cheese addict. The burger tasted absolutely amazing. I know nothing about burgers but I do now this was utterly delicious. I was worried the rosemary might overpower the rosemary garlic mayo but it was subtle and tasty. The onions rings were pretty normal but good.   This is without a doubt the best food court meal I've had in years. I'll go back if I'm in the mall."}
{"text":"I went to the Eaton Centre location on a day and time when the food court was almost empty so I was very disappointed to have such a bad experience.  The service was slow, the burgers were flavourless, the onion rings were bland, and the poutine was way too salty - something I have never experienced before in the other BSB location on King Street.  I thought the staff seemed really disorganized when I was waiting for my order. They prepped and served the burgers for the people that ordered after myself and 2 other individuals ahead of me, making us wait a good 15 minutes for essentially the same product.   Overall, a very poor experience. I will probably stick to the location on King Street versus this one."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for a big burger with good fries, no complaints was what I was expecting and wanted"}
{"text":"Great burgers when done right. Order take out from here time to time. Second last time they forgot to add key elements to 2 burgers. It was basically a bun a meat.  Not edible. Called in to tell the manager about the experience and he took ownership of the situation immediately. Great service in that regard, and resonates very well. Next time we ordered take out the girl on the phone got the order wrong. That does not resonate well. Poor quality control but great service from the manager. Overall friendly, well- meaning staff."}
{"text":"This burger is so average. The bun is dry, and not toasted, the beef has no beef flavour and there's nothing unique about the dressings.  I got the Swiss Melt (Swiss cheese, sauteed mushrooms, BBQ sauce, mayo, lettuce, tomato) except they ran out of lettuce and I omitted the BBQ sauce.  I was not satisfied after eating this. I would rather indulge in an A&W burger than spend $9 on a dry and bland one at Big Smoke."}
{"text":"Had their larger burger, fries and soda for $9.50. Burger was decent, said to be fresh never frozen  but hardly memorable.  Mediocre bun & standard toppings.  Did love the hand cut fries that were almost brown rather than golden.  Probably unhealthy as hell but they tasted great with the malt vinegar. All in all, not what they were when King West location was known as Craft Burger but what chain location ever is?"}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger place ever.  Okay, so the basics: organic beef burgers, the patties are never frozen and therefore have a wonderfully fresh taste, the beef isn't overcooked - these alone would warrant full marks.   BUT they have concoctions like the Craft Blue which has Gorgonzola cheese and avocado on top of a dollop of garlic may, lettuce, and tomato. I added caramelized onions to the mix and just about died when I took my first bite. So much for my New Year's resolution to become vegetarian but if one is going to go back on it, do it with a bang.  FANTASTIC!   FYI, it's an $8 or $9 burger once one gets the organic option (which is worth it, in my opinion).   I had a vanilla milkshake with my burger. It was, as milkshakes go, normal."}
{"text":"I was visiting my home town of Toronto from Middle Georgia, where the word \"poutine\" might be mistaken for a french cuss word rather than a Canadian delicacy. Needless to say, the South is pretty devoid of cheese curds, so I am unable to enjoy this dish for the larger part of the year.  Having exhausted Poutini's the past few times I visited, I decided to give Big Smoke Burger a whirl.   The service here was very good. With a lot of quick-service food places, you get the sense from the employees that they would rather be getting a root canal than to be slinging food at you. But at Big Smoke Burger, they were very pleasant, helpful and polite and seemed to enjoy working there, which adds to a pleasant dining experience, fast or not.   I loved the fact that the gravy was veggie friendly. At least, that's how they hesitantly conveyed it to me, which I took at face value. I don't have meat allergies, so what I don't know can't hurt me if it actually was beef gravy.   I ordered the spicy poutine which came with carmelized onions and I believe a spicy mayo sauce on top of all the other poutiney ingredients.   It was good, but very comparable to all the other poutineries and did not stand out from any other poutines I have ingested.   I decided to kick up the spice level a few thousand scovilles but when I inquired about hot sauce, they informed me that they do not have any and that the spicy mayo was the spiciest sauce they had on hand.   I think if they added a bottle of Sriracha to their condiment section it would really enhance an o.k. poutine to a really good poutine. So for me, it stayed at an o.k. poutine.  But that's o.k. Not all poutines were meant to be outstanding. I might be back to check out their veggie burger because I have heard great things about it. But I will have to remember to bring my travel Sriracha bottle."}
{"text":"Let me say that I am NOT a red meat eater, however I WILL eat red meat if I know that it is good (no hormones, no additives and organic,).  I ordered a \"chicken: burger\", but they didn't have anymore chicken left. UGH! It was 6pm and you DO NOT have any chicken left??and NO veggie either?? really??  I was left with only one other option-100% organic beef burger..FINE!  It was okay, a little overdone in my opinion. An okay burger, but nothing to write home about. I could of definitely make a better burger at home.   Definitely way too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"After corresponding with the manager of the restaurant, she invited me to try their food again.  I decided to accept their offer and returned a week to see if they improved.  Once I arrived, there was a slight wait to give my order as they tend to be busy before the lunch rush.   I decided to get the Hogtown burger which was made with grilled chicken, swiss cheese, sauteed mushrooms, bacon and the works. The cashier told me that it would take 8 minutes which helped set my expectations on the wait.  The staff including Janice, the manager, were on point and quickly delivered all the orders.  By giving an expected time and deliverying slightly before that time helped make the wait worth it.  Now, on to the meal.  To my delight, the burger was really enjoyable with the chicken done just right and not dry at all.  It would be easy to overcook the chicken but it was perfect.  During the wait, I saw that the beef burgers that others ordered looked juicy.  It is good that my feedback made a difference with their meals.   As a personal preference, I found that the mayo was a bit more than I would have liked.  Definitely would return and tell them to give me less mayo. I wonder if the lamb would be good. I may try the beef again and hope that it will be as juicy as the ones I saw recently."}
{"text":"I had BEAST burger combo with poutine. The burger was one of the most delicious burgers I have ever eaten. I recommend this place wholeheartedly."}
{"text":"Loved the burgers here, had almost every one.  A real reason to go back to the Yonge Bloor area!!"}
{"text":"I'd give it a 5, but because of my friend's experiences, I'll give it a 4.  Came here yesterday with a group of friends.  Parking was a nightmare, but thats king street.  I ordered the Lamb Burger, which was FREAKING PHENOMINAL.  LAMB LAMB cilantro-feta pesto please FTW.  It was beautiful. Wonderfully cooked. I'm salivatng thinking about it right now.  My friends ordered the Red Burger (Red Peppers and Gorgonzola) and I found the Gorgonzola to be a bit overpowering..and my other friend ordered the Craft (Carmelized Onions and Cheddar) which he said was okayy, but not the best.  I give it five stars, but my friends didn't love it.  It is so worth it. Cheap as hell too. Only spent like 12 bucks.  LAMb ME HARD BABY.   LAMB LAMB.  13/15"}
{"text":"A burger like this makes the baby Jesus cry. Given the fawning reviews of this place, I was really looking forward to a good, juicy burger. I ordered a meal that pulled out all the caloric stops: a cheeseburger, poutine, and a chocolate shake. While the poutine was decent and the shake serviceable (but thin), the burger was egregiously bad. The meat was Sahara-dry and seriously overcooked. The bun was cold. I can eat me a burger, but I couldn't even choke half of my Craft Burger down. So. Very. Disappointing.   The restaurant is rather small, and isn't very good for groups. The service, on the other hand, was quite nice and smiley.   Based on the glowing reviews of this place, I'll go back and try this place again, but based on the one burger I had, I'd almost rather go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Ordered the spicy burger and it was OK. It wasn't really that spicy and its size was on par with other burger joints such as Hero and Five Guys.   Although less pricey than Five Guys, I still don't think you get good value as the burger is only decent."}
{"text":"Sometimes, a meal is a commitment: you have to dedicate several hours after you finish eating to digest your food. This is a Craft Burger experience. When I worked nearby, I would go here a lot for lunch. The burgers are really works of art - they are home made, huge and topped just the way you like them. I usually indulged in the classic although the craft spicy (with a spicy mayo) is also very tasty. The craft blue with avocado and gorgonzola cheese is also worth a try.  The onion rings are GIGANTIC and deliciously battered. The fries are skinny, dark, mushy things that don't even deserve to sit next to these masterpieces.  They also serve chicken burgers and salads for those not wanting to destroy their arteries.   Every time I ate here, I felt like I'd eaten a brick. The burgers are so tasty, but they're a lot of food to consume. That's why it's a commitment to get a Craft burger - you'll be feeling it for the rest of the afternoon.    Keep in mind, there's usually a line out the door at lunchtime during the workweek. Although most people will have to bring their food back to the office as the seating here is minimal."}
{"text":"First time visiting big smoke and I do not have many good things to say. It took 10 min for the food to be cooked and in a food court, that's just too long. The burger meat was low quality and nowhere near the quality of burgers priest or holy chuck yet it is being sold for the same price. Fries were overcooked and seasoned. I personally didn't mind the seasoning however their was no mention of that on the menu. The toppings were fresh but everything else was disappointing. Take a drive down the street to burgers priest and you will see a 5 star burger joint. The only reason they get 2 stars is because my girlfriend really enjoyed the fries and all the toppings were fresh."}
{"text":"Had their lettuce bun burger, not bad, nothing spectaclar, we only went in because we read a review somewhere saying it is one of the best burger spots...I wouldn't say it's the best, I prefer Holy Chuck, The Works for their bacon beef burger."}
{"text":"I saw the cook walk over from the grill to the area where the staff would put toppings on the hamburgs. He accidentally dropped the hamburger on the counter top instead of placing it on the hamburger. Rather than throwing it out, he scooped it off the counter and walked back over to the grill where he put it back on for a few seconds, then walked back over and placed it on the bun. I told the server this was a health violation and I would not eat that hamburger. She said she would have him make me a new one. They made me wait until he had cooked burgers for several other people in line instead of cooking mine right away.I had to wait for 12 minutes for another burger to be made. By that time, my french fries  that had been sitting on the tray all this time were cold. Needless to say I will never go back."}
{"text":"Yum! Fresh and delicious. Burger without a bun in lettuce wraps is perfect for a low carb meal! They do organic beef burgers and gluten free buns!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I got the 'boutique' description but a good burger nonetheless.  It's slightly above say Chipotle, but not really by much.  I had a solid Lamb burger with delicious feta spread and a micro green salad with pretty decent dressing.  The avocado addition was a regret as it was a frozen cup of mashed avocado (Chipotle would win here).  The service was excellent though, very nice and thoughtful employees from the register to the server."}
{"text":"I ordered a large poutine and 2 burgers on ritual and drove there to pick it up and surprise that rosemary sauce is large surcharge of $1.30 for such a small serving. I think $0.50 is more reasonable and the to my surprise the large poutine has changed from a box size to a little round containers. My poutine was only filled half the containers as well. Might as well call it a small. This is such a rip off. I go out of my way to drive there when I have burger priest right below my building just because I love your poutine and Rosemary sauce so much, but feeling ripped off I don't think I'll go anymore. Pls change back to the box at least for the large!!!! So much competition out there now a few fries is not much hit to your bottom line and sauce as well!!! Repeat customers are everything to keeping up regular business. Please reconsider changing back"}
{"text":"The fries were mushy. Ewww. Just ewww.  The restaurant was dirty and smelled funny, and the other patrons were kind of creepy. Felt bad for the woman working the till given how the other customers were treating her."}
{"text":"Decent burger and fries. Went there couple of times. Prices are way up but worth a try if you are looking for a change."}
{"text":"Coming from LA where there is plenty of burger joints to choose from, this was an exceptional burger joint. The burger was juicy, firm, not dry. Had plenty of flavor and passed the California standards with flying stars! Service was as expected from any burger joint and they were very specific with the order you placed making sure everything was as you wanted. Definitely will make a visit if I come back to Toronto!"}
{"text":"Just don't go here. Incredibly overpriced and the quality is sub sub sub par."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on Saturday night. They had a rush ahead of me but even with 4 guys on the grill I waited about 20 minutes for my one burger. The burger was all right, not that much flavour but I was grateful that they didn't overcook it.  I went in hoping to get a bacon and blue cheese burger.  I was shocked and disappointed to be told that they don't have bacon on the menu. What? no bacon?! that's absurd.  The friendly counter girl told me that everything there is fresh and they don't have room to store fresh bacon. Whatever.  Anyway, sat down to eat and noticed that the fries were cold. I sent them back, friendly cook came over and apologized.  They re-did the fries, 10 minutes later.. can't say they were worth the wait.  They were tough with pockets of hotness.  I don't know how they achieved this.  I'm beginning to suspect they refried my old ones because they were so hard.  I would not go back again.  It was not delicious, not a smoothly run operation and their refusal to carry bacon is just wrong."}
{"text":"The beef burger is really satisfying and the toppings have always been fresh, but BSB is definitely more expensive than burger joints of similar quality. The main advantage here is the convenience of the location (in Square One).   Classic 6oz beef burger (not combo) is $6.79 - you choose from ketchup, mustard, mayo, jalapeños, pickles, red onion, tomato, lettuce.   Switching to Halal costs $1.49 - I really, really appreciate the option but this is steep for Mississauga when there are options like Burger Factory and On The Bun.   BSB has some good signature toppings like sautéed mushrooms and carmelized onions for a surcharge. Hoping they bring back goat cheese and feta cheese!"}
{"text":"This chain seems to be expanding in the GTA. I've been to the one in Eaton Centre. This location at York Mills and Leslie is new. Like others have commented access is really only via Leslie Street. A bit of an inconvenience.   Ok, on to the food.  Burgers are tasty but on the small side. Fries are good. Overall the combo price is above average for the amount of food you get.   Lots of seating, service friendly."}
{"text":"Okay....let's not get too lovestruck here people. Went to the King Street location. The reality is that you're paying 8 dollars for a burger that is freshly grilled to order on a bun that you'd pick up for any ol' BBQ in your backyard and toppings that are pricier (avacado/rosemary mayo) but no means quality. The fries are average at best and the rings are good (whole rings with a solid non-greasy breading).   Overall, a combo (burger/rings/drink) will run you $13 dollars. The burgers aren't really gourmet (the meat is run of the mill) but it does replicate that hearty fresh backyard burger that perhaps few Torontonian's get to experience anymore. If you're in the right mood and craving a hearty burger, you've come to the right place. But don't give them any \"best\" burger titles."}
{"text":"I'm usually one of those people that thinks \"a burger's a burger\" but DAMN this burger is good."}
{"text":"Went here the other day.got there around 2pm not crowded, order a double cheeseburger & onion rings...the onion rings are great the portions  are small..the burger was off the charts juicy, flavorful and I think I'll be going here as often as I can..oh and the servers are nice especially the short brunette that served me ;)"}
{"text":"Good seasoning on the burgers,  just way to cooked, border line burning,  both mine and my girlfriend's I had the Blue Burger with \"avocado \" which turned out to be guacamole, NOT THE SAME. Onion rings are crispy and very nice flavor to them."}
{"text":"I ordered a double cheeseburger, with diet coke and that's it. It was $20. No bacon, no special toppings. For that price I was expecting something special and well it really wasn't.  The burger was mediocre and small. It tasted good but for that price I just won't go back."}
{"text":"i just got a classic cheeseburger with all the toppings, and it was very good. This is a pretty big burger for lunchtime, and it filled me up, so I am glad I didn't get fries with it. No idea how anything else is but I liked the burger, and next time I am in the mood for one at lunch, I have a place to get it. There is some seating inside. Lunchtime is busy, I got lucky and did not wait in line, but the crowd came right after I ordered. Cost: approximately $7."}
{"text":"Mmmm burgers, a good burger is god for me and craft burger does them pretty well. Personal favourites are the Craft Spicy and I believe it's the Craft Crazy? the one w Coleslaw on the burger but i sub the pepper jack for smoked cheddar and no peppers, so really it's just a craft spicy w coleslaw...  They definitely focus on quality over quanitity, the burgers are a bit smaller than some of the ones I've had at the nicer burger places in that price range, and their portion of fries are not piled high but I prefer this as I can finish it enjoyably in one sitting.   If you're looking for something a bit more substantial though you could try a double patty or their milkshakes? I've been meaning to try a milkshake but always end up too full to order one."}
{"text":"Don't order organic. It`s the same burger. I went during after work hours, so there were lots of people in line in front of me. While in line, I noticed 2 larger size burger patties (might have been lamb?) and then the rest were the same type of patties being grilled all on a row. The 2 larger sized patties got served 2 orders in front of me. And after I placed my order for an 'organic' burger, I noticed that suddenly 1 of the regular size patty was moved to another row on the grill. And then they gave me that special top row now-organic burger a few seconds later. I asked why the burger was already on the grill and ready right away. I was told they always make organic burgers in case there were orders. Riiiight. So they always put a few extra dollars on the grill, in case. And because once these organic patties finish grilling they have to serve it otherwise it gets cold, it means they would serve someone who paid $6.50 for a regular burger an organic burger that cost an extra $1.25 more if no organic orders came. I don't believe it. Plus, no larger size burger patty came on the grill after they were taken off for that order. So lamb burgers are to order (you can obviously taste a difference), organic they put on grills just in case. Ahuh.   On the plus side, burger patties are pretty thick. They do grill the bun. I got a burger with smoked cheddar, roasted garlic mayo, and the rest of the regular toppings. The cheddar was ok. I love applewood smoked cheddar but this was just ok smoked cheddar. I didn`t taste the mayo that much but I did add ketchup and mustard too. To be honest, my husband got a A&W bacon cheeseburger and he and I both enjoyed it more than the smoked cheddar burger. You do get more meat with the Big Smoke Burgers then A&W of course, but I definitely shouldn't have paid extra for that so-called organic Beretta farm patty. It's not that we have low end taste. We actually really enjoy the burgers at South of Temperance. But Big Smoke didn't impress this round. Reading reviews for the other location I can see I wasn't the only one who preferred A&W."}
{"text":"Good burger, good fries, good onion ring,poutine is big and the milkshakes are whatever. I come here on my day off and catch up with a friend while he is on lunch during work. Food is fresh gets quite busy so keep that in mind. Potions are good and for the price yes.... as others said there are places that give you more but this place is about quality not quantity. Oh and... they sell beer. If that isn't a 5 star for a franchised burger joint I don't know what would be."}
{"text":"Awesome burger spot!  Great meat and topping options. Really good fries and onion rings too.  They cook their meat medium  well with a bit of pink,  shows the freshness of their product. Service was also very good.  Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"These guys were really gracious and accommodating. The food was flavorful and original (we had a big smoke and flaming pineapple, without the banana peppers).  Washrooms are very clean, and atmosphere is nice. We came during an off-hour, though - right between lunch and dinnertime."}
{"text":"If you are into fresh, tasty, sumptuous burgers- this place is for you. Everything is made to order in front of you, so you know that it is as fresh as possible. The burgers are quite large so keep that in mind! The Craft blue burger is my favorite, worth a try.. seating is a little tight, you will be lucky to get a table at lunch or dinner time. Suggest maybe getting it to go.   Only downside was the onion rings and milk shake- I would stick to the burgers and fries here."}
{"text":"This one is quite small, i'm not sure how big the other ones are.. The staff there was great! They have a variety of old school sodas, and a great variety of burgers, very different burger ideas and flavors, and all burgers are made to order so you can custom choose any of the amazing ingredients they have on hand. I tried the blue burger which is packed with gorgonzola, avocado, rosemary garlic mayo, tomato & lettuce... was very tasty, but it had too many strong flavors for me at the moment. Also had the onion rings with it.. they were pretty good also.. The decor is a dark wood, matching table and such.. kind of has a warm chillout feel."}
{"text":"Love this place. Vincent was a very nice and friendly employee, and helped me make a very crucial choice to buy poutine and a beer. 10/10 would give him a raise. Also the chef with blue har was very accommodating to my friends allergens."}
{"text":"Big smoke alright! Nothing special just expensive, better off going to mcds, burger king. Def more affordable & decent selection. Highly not recommended."}
{"text":"Decided to come out with the work group! Definitely a place to try if you're a burger oficionado! The menu is straight forward, however if you're undecisive, just take your time as there are different types of burgers from their Spicy and smokey to lamb or vegetarian.  I had the Big Smoke Burger, tender, smokey flavor, infused with sauteed onions, and swiss cheese really heightened the standards of this burger.  Their onion rings are top notch! not too oily, however gigantic in size complimented the burger.   The overall service was very efficient, and the place was clean! This place is worth coming back to, however keep in mind it is a bit pricier, my meal with a fountain drink came to just over $12."}
{"text":"So this month, since most of my friends live around the area....we all were mailed out the BOGO burgers and free fries coupons.  This means I've been eating BOGO all month long (with different people at different times).     I've been to the Yonge and King location twice and already reviewed it there.     I've been to the Eaton Centre location twice - next up for me to review I guess.    I've been here to the original location here for the first time last night...and I'm going to review it now.     I know their menu is the same no matter which location I went to....but the burger and fries quality was definitely different.     According to my hubby, this location is the original location....at 573 King Street West.  When they first opened it was called Craft Burger .   He loved the place and would go there for lunch quite often and have been doing so since they opened.  They made a mean burger, had really good shakes, and excellent fries.     I went to the Yonge and king location and agree that the fries were great , the burgers were decent but nothing to rave about.    I then went to the Eaton Centre location and well, the burgers were okay, and the fries (usually my favourite part), was consistently over salted (by consistently I mean the 2 times I've been there).  So I neither enjoyed my burger that much OR the fries....unfortunately.     Then hubby took me to this one.  The original, we both got The BEAST burger, which had mushrooms, bacon, cheese, and onion rings. I skipped the sauces and got extra lettuce, pickles, onions , jalapeño and tomatoes....we got fries and a chocolate shake to share.  For my hubby's burger, he skipped the mushrooms and got caramelized onions instead.   YES!    Everything was made fresh and made to order.   The burger was HUGE but it was stable....I could still hold it with one hand (just barely), beef was still juicy, I did make my burger too big and couldn't bite into all of it at once ....but heck I like it that way.    The fries...perfectly freshly doubled fried crispy goodness... and NOT over salted.     The shake ....chocolate shakes always go well with burgers...next time we will mix it up at little and get a strawberry chocolate shake!    Okay...now I understand what my hubby was raving about, I just had to go to the original location to understand.   Here's 5 stars.  :-)"}
{"text":"I like how 2 stars on yelp means \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"    That's exactly how I felt at the Big Smoke Burger at the Eaton Centre both times I went.   Keep in mind, I do LOVE Big Smoke Burger.    I was addicted to their location at the Service location on HWY400 but they closed.  :-/  I definitely enjoyed the Yonge and King location...their blazing pineapple burger was the bomb and fries were OFF THE HOOK!   I gave that one 4 stars.    I LOVED their original King and Portland location...I just ate there yesterday.   Gave that one 5 stars.     So it's sad I had to give this place 2 stars.    My friend and I both got the Beast Burger with a side of fries to eat in and I went with another friend for take out with the same order.     Let's start with the fries.... The bowls they use to put small fries on is MUCH smaller then if you got it to go.   It only fits about 1/3 of the fries that normally would fit into a bag.  Generally this would have really saddened me because I LOVE BIG SMOKE BURGERS' fries......but these were so over salted I didn't finish them.   The burgers were over done and dry, not sure if it was because they already had burgers cooking before we ordered and used those?  I thought they were always cooked fresh to order.  The burger was much drier then other locations even though my order is always the same ...which is their recommended \"Medium Well\".  I  have the theory that Eaton centre locations are worked by more part time and younger people then the other locations...potentially not as well trained and with a higher staff turnover.  I don't know if this is true or not, I'm just mentally trying to figure out why there's such a huge discrepnecy between this location and the others.     I went another time with a friend and got take out.....burgers were still just as dry, and the fries while a much larger portion, was very heavily salted.    I ate them anyways...but I used a napkin to brush off the salt.  I mean, their fries are still yummy...just not with quite so much salt."}
{"text":"They make a decent burger....my favourite is the blazing pineapple and I like that you can add additional toppings to their standard burger.   Big smoke burger and swiss melt is quite nice too, their hot banana peppers is fresh!    So I mean they make a decent burger, not the best I've ever tasted, but fresh, with a nice bun, and well balanced, but what I really REALLY love....is their fries.     I LOVE their fries.   Really, I could skip their burgers and just eat a bag of fries alone.   As a person who really loves fries....they are crispy and delicious.  They add salt and season salt to it to make it extra tasty, and they have homemade sauces (cilantro feta is really yummy), but it's not really necessary.   I can just eat their fries, plain, all day.     Their SMALL Fries is HUGE....it's larger then a large fries at McD's   Their LARGE fries...is MASSIVE...and really feeds 2, as a main.   And sometimes....my hubby and I just split an order of Large fries as a snack.   There's no shame in that.....okay, maybe some shame, but it's so good that's totally okay.  :-D"}
{"text":"There is nothing \"gourmet\" about this burger!! overpriced with a lack of taste. If you are at yorkdale mall and are in between big smoke and a&w. . . go with A&W! Nothing about this burger should cost more than $2"}
{"text":"I needed a place to grab a quick lunch before a meeting and happened on this restaurant. The restaurant is quite small and easily missed. I'd highly recommend the Baja Burger and Fries. It's a good lunch spot. Take out probably would have been better as it was difficult to find a place to sit."}
{"text":"I appreciate a good burger, and their menu said they appreciated them as well.  They have a variety of specialty burgers, but I went with the \"Craft Burger\".  Apparently this restaurant used to be called \"Craft Burger\", so it seemed to make sense that this was the burger that they were most proud of.    They advertise that the burgers are cooked after you order, and can take 8 to 10 minutes.  Due to the delay and fresh ingredients, it seems to fall out of the qualification of fast food.    It was a great burger, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.  I wasn't overly impressed with the fries, but I will give the caveat that I had them to go and certainly didn't have them fresh.  The portions of the fries were impressive.  I will probably try the onion rings the next time I visit."}
{"text":"I am IN the restaurant right now waiting for my friend to join me, and while I wait, I've asked for the wifi password. I've been told that I \"have to make a purchase first.\" In this day and age, that is the most outrageous thing. I'm hoping my friend doesn't have his heart set on his place, because now don't even want to give them my money.  So far, this place sucks."}
{"text":"Not all burgers are created equal.  I love 'da beef.  I pretty much know every hamburger joint from Dangerous Dan's to Magoo's.  I'm even showing my age when I want to ask how many of you remember Toby's Good Eats where the burgers and the Apple Brown Betty where like the bread of life.    I love Craft burger.  I strictly prefer the King St. destination (I heard they opened up at Yonge & Bloor also).  This might be because if I'm not feeling the need for beef I can hit up Reggie's Sandwiches next door (hey we all need sustenance at 2 a.m. right?).  Your basic purchase at CB's is the combo (approx. 10 bucks).  I always order the organic burger I find the taste just far superior and for me the gotta have topping is the carmelized onions.    One previous reviewer said its takes a bit longer than usual burger orders...doh...its a beef patty, real meat, not so savagely ground up that it cooks lickety split.  Craft gets their meat from the Healthy Butcher.  Burgers worth eating need to be cooked properly.  Craft hits the nail on the head.  Love the fries, hot, very crispy and with the skin on, although on this point I agree with a previous reviewer, lighten up on the salt boys!    Serving sizes are ample, very ample so if I go in with my honey we order one combo and one burger and share the fries.  If you are claustrophoic this ain't the place to eat.  I usually do take out and call ahead first, run in and grab up my bag of goodies.  They pack the fries into a paperbag, not a chip box which I also really like.  Right now this is the burger place of my choice."}
{"text":"Burgers are hit and miss here. Sometimes they'll be a bit overcooked and others it'll be undercooked.   For something a bit more consistent, go with the poutine. The hand-cut fries with real cheese curds are great."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place in the Eaton Centre Food Court on the way home from downtown.  The burger was good.  I generally have preferred flat top cooked burgers, but this was a good grilled burger.  It was cooked well and the toppings were okay too.  There are better burgers out there, but I would stop by again.  Alex"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  Yeah the burgers are a bit overpriced, so are the fries.  So now that is out of the way, they have such unique selections of burgers and add ons that make it a great place to get a juicy burger (think kinda Hero burgers but more fancy y'all).  I had the Craft burger (sauteed mushrooms, rosemary garlic mayo and lettuce & tomato) and the Spicy burger (just a note, this was not at all spicy).  I forget actually what was on this burger.  You get your choice of medium or medium rare, so you can kinda have it your way!  The fries look like those rustic hand cut fries and provided enough of a crunch.  The service was decent as it was lunch time rush during the holiday season and they cook your burger right there, no pre-made patties that are just warmed up here.  I wouldn't have this all the time due to the price, 1 combo and 1 additional burger was like $20 which is a bit crazy, but no one needs to know that I spent that much on my meal..right yelp?!"}
{"text":"Disappointed for the second time. Went the second time for a promo they had. We had to add salt and pepper (season) on everything. The burgers, fries and onion rings and even after seasoning it was blah! Will never go back, at least to this location. I had gone to the one at Yonge and Bloor years ago and loved it. This place needs to close down cuz it is not worth the money, wait or bellies that want food."}
{"text":"I'm giving a 5 star rating to this Big Smoke Burger location because the food was excellent and the customer service was even better. I ordered the big smoke burger combo with fry-rings. The bread they use has great flavour and is in perfect proportion to the size of the meat patty. All veggies and toppings were very fresh. The staff brought our food straight to our table and also gave us cutlery, ketchup and napkins. They even cleared the table and took all of our garbage. Overall, this was an outstanding gourmet burger experience."}
{"text":"Burgers are decent, unfortunately MALL PRICES are higher than other Etobicoke burger joints. Good if your In the mall and don't mind paying. Sure beats the crappy fast food burgers."}
{"text":"I was here the other day.  It was tasty, but even more expensive than other gourmet burger places.  I prefer other ones that I've tried, but I suppose it's ok for a food court environment.  I ordered a veggie burger dressed as a blue burger.  There was avocado and gargonzola involved from what I can remember.  A full combo is actually a bit too much food for me.  It's ok."}
{"text":"I loved the lamb burger! With a bit of pink in the middle - PERFECT!  It's too bad this location is so small. I had trouble finding a place to stand without getting in the way of people ordering and picking up napkins."}
{"text":"Great flavor and different selection of burgers.  They are in my top 5 for burgers I have ever had.  There seemed to be more take out then stay in - a very casual environment with minimal atmosphere."}
{"text":"Everything is just overpriced, but the size and the quality of the burger aren't equivalent to the price. The frosty is prized at $4.99 but it's disappointing."}
{"text":"Ok SO. I have a problem with choosing different burgers when I find one that I really like. I was here once before, exactly a year ago and had the same thing. Went around 12, it wasn't that busy but got a little more packed as soon as we sat down.  I got the Blue - gorgonzola cheeeese, letture, tomato, avocado, garlic mayo (I also added caramelized onions because je suis adventurous like that). Also got a poutine. Why didn't anyone tell me that a large poutine is...large? It was huuuuge and came with two forks. Obviously I ate the whole thing...who is this second fork for? It is probably to help me put away all that deliciousness twice as fast. The gravy was sort of at the bottom? Kind of? I don't get it, the deeper I dug into it, the more gravy there was. The fries were yummy though, not salty enough but just the right degree of softness and crispiness. *hearts*  The burger was good, meat was a little tiny bit dry but honestly with so many delicious toppings you don't even notice the meat. Who cares about the meat in the burger, seriously (jk).  They have a lot of other choices - you can make your own by adding all kinds of toppings like jalapenos, roasted red peppers, chipotle sauce, different cheeses, etc etc.   I recommend it - but unless you're a beast like me, don't try to attempt the large poutine. Get a side order!"}
{"text":"Came to big smoke recently and has a pretty good experience but then again my family is pretty easy going.   The prices are a little steep but the portions were fair. What I didn't like was that we ordered 2 combos one with poutine and one with fries. My son is 14 months and loves fries but we were disappointed that we got the burgers first and had to wait for the fries and poutine since they forgot to put them down. I get it, mistakes happen but to not be apologetic about it seemed strange to me. My son was getting quite fussy while we had to wait. By the time the fries came the burgers were pretty much cold so it was hard to tell if we really enjoyed them or not. All in all the experience was off-putting. Would like to say that we will give them another try but didn't feel appreciated as a customer and for the prices it doesn't seem worth a second shot."}
{"text":"I guess the being bought out = down to the bottom of the burger pecking order.   Used to frequently get the organic beef burger and LOVED it, but they have discontinued the organic range, in favour of factory-farmed meat no better than your nearest McDonalds, but at craft burger prices.   Even A&Ws has better beef (no hormones, steroids, and only medically necessary antibiotics) than this place, and for 1/3 of the price! Read their website now and Big Smoke Burger is just a marketing company capitalizing on foodie buzz words instead of being a purveyor of real gourmet burgers.   Wouldn't be surprised if other ingredients are cheap'd out on too, and the non-GMO canola is replaced by GMO canola.   I won't be going back, you've lost me as a loyal customer."}

{"text":"If your idea of a poutine is unmelted cheese and gravy then this is the spot for you! When asked for gravy that is actually hot, their response was that they don't have any gravy. The crazy and pineapple blaze burgers were good."}
{"text":"It's a burger joint in a food court. I think I enjoyed this one more than Hero's. I had the standard Big Smoke Buger. It was small but they use AAA meat. The fries were delicious.  Don't add salt. Salty enough. Onion rings wer good. Very filling. Yorkdale has done a nice job with the food court."}
{"text":"I've been to burger places before. So trendy nowadays. So immaterial in the larger foodie sphere. But these places are remarkably popular in work environments. Specially those dominated by men. The larger and grosser the burger is, the more men gravitate towards them.  Luckily, this place is not large, not gross. It's a burger with a medium size patty cooked well done, like ground beef should be. I ordered the classic burger. Of course, when I mentioned classic burger, I also added the word cheeseburger. The cashier did not hear me, and in the end, it was a blessing in disguise!  The burger itself was moist and not soggy. I take full credit for this one b/c I did not order tomatoes with it. I ordered the combo and appreciated that water is part of the combo. The fries were deliciously salty. One thing I noticed is that this burger fills you up. There's no need to be greedy and add those fries. Unless perhaps you haven't eaten in 12 hours. All in all a good burger experience but not something I am already savouring my immiment return."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and the food has always been delicious! Had the craft burger and the crazy burger (both with veggie patties).  The bun is excellent and the toppings are high quality and delicious. The Manager came over while we were eating to make sure the food was good, and cleared our trays for us."}
{"text":"Decent burger joint. Not cheap Really like their Lamb burger. Bring your loud gf and she might just shut it. They got four washrooms Why"}
{"text":"These burgers are pure badassness.  Yes, badassness. Be sure to keep an eye out for this place as it is easy to miss.  Walking in you are welcomed to a small brick and beam establishment. A small tables are located near the front and there are a few bar seats available. There's a giant chalk board that lists all the available burgers. My personal favorites are the organic burger and the classic burger.  Service is usually fast and friendly. But there are times when grilling wait times get pretty lengthy. Usually around lunchtime. Just be prepared to wait a little longer than 10mins for your meal.  Time for the goodstuff! The burgers! These little puppies are well seasoned, perfectly cooked, and has a good burger:toppings:bun ratio. The burgers are one of the better ones in the city. Although, err on the side of caution. I've encountered a few dry burgers at this joint. Lately it's been happening late but consistency can be an issue.   What really puts these burgers over the top are the sides! The french fries are amazing. They have the right amount of crisp, and perfect amount of potato. They look just like swiss chalet fries but taste like swiss chalet fries on crack! Fantastic. Some of my favorite cheap eat fries in the city. The real star winner here are the onion rings. The onion rings are gigantic and are dipped in panko leaving them amazingly crisp. What makes these onion rings the absolute best are their doneness. They are cooked perfectly. Not once have I ever bitten into a Craft onion ring and have the onion string out of the beautiful fried casing. Each bite is perfect.  Overall, one of the better burgers in the city and without a doubt one of the best, if not the best onion rings in town. The price point makes this joint a must visit, even if it's just for fries and onion rings."}
{"text":"Upset stomach all night, not sure if it is from here or the flu? Posting just incase anyone else felt the same which would help us verify whether or not it is a virus or food related"}
{"text":"I absolutely love burgers,  I've tried many different burger joints and I have to say this was one the best burgers i've had. Delicious, fresh especially double cheese burger Best burger I have ever had- actually!"}
{"text":"Wasn't this Mayor Förd's favorite burger joint? Anyway. Save your money and trek over to Five Guys up on Yonge or something like Burger Priest. The burgers are dull and expensive. The place kinda smelled too, like someone had mopped the floor with a mop that had gone \"sour\". The one at Queen/Spadina has that 10 million combination cola machine, which I swear speaks to me at times... sending me \"orders\". That's kind of fun. But this one just has a limited fountain."}
{"text":"I had the Big Smoke Burger   Fantastic burger, 6oz standard patty and I believe it was $3 for an extra patty.  For about $12 it was a fairly hefty meal, good size and portion.  The pattys were perfect.  The pattys were everything a good burger patty should be and actually tastes like ground beef rather than fillers.  The toppings all seemed fresh and the bun was great."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Yonge and Bloor location 8ish last night.  The place was small, clean, and it being late, not too busy. I ordered an organic burger (where the meat comes from the Healthy Butcher), and my wife bought something with avocado and other fancy-ass ingredients. We split some onion rings. My God, it was good. Craft Burger is a bit expensive for a burger shop, but I don't think I've had a better burger in the city. People, you need to go there now."}
{"text":"It's not bad as a novelty to try it once.  I read all the reviews here and I just had to try it out.  I had eaten burgers when they used to be called craft burger on King St W, I remember not liking them back then but maybe things are different.  This place is usually busy with a line but don't let that fool you, it moves along fast (ok a few minutes so not that fast).    I was torn over whether I should order the craft burger or just a plain one, my brother suggested I go with the craft so why not.  He got the blue cheese avocado burger.    All in all my brother enjoyed his, I don't know but mine was just ok.  The burger is thick (why can't places make big thin burgers instead of thick ones).  The outside was charbroiled but it was good.  It reminded me of a hamburger place called \"Sams\" on College when I was growing up.  It's very pricey, two burgers cost my brother $15 and change and that was with no drink.  Next time I want to get the onion rings they look good but the portion for the fries seems small."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto on business and was headed into downtown with a few co-workers.  SUPER hungry after my flight and needed something awesome to satisfy my hunger.  A co-worker was in downtown already and scoping out for places to chow down.  She found a hole in the wall joint called Big Smoke Burger; it reminded her of a similar burger joint back home (The Nook in St Paul, MN).  We walked in and got immediately slammed with the aroma of grilled burgers and deep fried fries; already amazed and salivating!!!  This location is SUPER small, has seating for about 15 people and parking is AWFUL and EXPENSIVE; but appeared to be work the trouble.  The menu is straight forward, order a burger, fries or onion rings and a bev to wash it all down.  I went with the Crazy Burger, onion rings and a black cherry soda from Boylan Bottling Company.  Here's what comes on the Crazy Burger: jalapeno havrati, cole slaw, chipotle mayo, bbq sauce, hot peppers and lettuce.  That alone should make you order it.  I love spicy food and this burger certainly hit the spot.  Somehow, everything blends together and the cole slaw simply completes the burger; it's the ingridient that keeps everything cool (get it?!?!).  This place is a hole in the wall, the label for napkins is literally a torn up piece of paper with \"napkins\" hand written on it and taped to the wall.  I love places like this and will for sure go back when I get a chance."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  A tip though - if you are not familiar with BSB, take your time. Step back and review the menu and ask questions before ordering...it'll be worth it I promise!"}
{"text":"I like Big Smoke Burger's better than the The Burger's Priest, W, Hero and other places near by on King. The patties taste like meat and are more substantial.  The chicken burgers are great too. You can taste the fire on the meat.  Other burger places tend to focus more on smothering the burger with toppings, which can be okay if the toppings are delicious. Here at Big Smoke I find the meat quality is excellent and juicy -- it tastes like a burger should!  It takes about 10 to 15 mins to get your order. Call ahead if you can.  Staff is full of regular faces and they all work hard and have a good attitude about being there.  I've ordered there many many times and they've never messed up an order.  The poutine is good when it's good but a bit inconsistent. Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's a little low on gravy and cheese.  They have a smoky cheddar which makes the cheese stand out. I find with a lot of burgers the cheese isn't very bold.  Milk-shakes are pretty good but not excellent. I like vanilla and theirs is more milky than vanilla."}
{"text":"Food was great! Only downside was seeing a mouse run right by the kitchen entrance right at we started to eat our food. Other patrons saw it as well and got their money back for their meal. Heard them telling the waiter that they would be calling Health Canada."}
{"text":"If you want an elevated burger experience, this location is ok. A little on the pricey side, but convenient location and friendly staff make it happen.   4/5 *"}
{"text":"If your hungry, this isn't a bad choice, though not a great choice.  Burgers are mediocre. You can do better down the road. But in a pinch, you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Burger and poutin would have been tasty if it was hot. Food was made in a decent time but had to sit there and watch it get cold before someone would serve it."}
{"text":"Craft Burger is new to my neck of the woods, and with any place that is new and has the word 'burger' in the title, I've got to check it out.  From the menu side, price-wise anyway, they seem to be putting themselves forward as a place for the definitive burger.  The prices are not exorbitant, but you expect for what it's costing to get a very decent burger.  You do not leave disappointed.  How else to describe the burgers.  They're fantastic.  The place has spots in the smallish dining area to eat in, but the bulk of traffic is picking up their food and leaving.  As always with new places I order items that should be basic and easy wins for them.  You say you got good burgers?  Let's try that, then.  The cheeseburger and fries that I got and brought home were fantastically tasty to the point of almost being...should I go far on this one?...so soon?...really?...yes...orgasmic.  The combination of meats and the freshness of the fries were truly brilliant.  If the onion rings taste as good as they looked I'll probably have to order them, smuggle them home, and eat them in a closet.  My friends have argued that the only problem with the place is that it is not licensed and doesn't offer full restaurant dining service.  That's nothing that a trip to the beer store followed by a stop at Craft Burger can't solve."}
{"text":"Up front, I'll say that Craft Burger isn't  bad. If you're in the mood for a burger, this will hit the spot. I only gave it three stars because it was a bit disappointing.  I guess I was just a bit underwhelmed. The patty had a great taste - meaty and obviously fresh. But I just don't get how so-called 'gourmet burger' joints don't teach their cooks not to press down on the patty when on it's on the grill, which dries the burger out by squeezing out both the juices and fat. While the topping and spicy mayo were great, and the burger itself tasted good, it was just a touch too dry, which to me, takes away some of the sinful, decadent pleasure of a fat-filled lunch.  The fries were pretty good, covered in what seemed like a cajun seasoning, but were too salty. Hopefully, I just got some from a bad batch.   Overall, a decent burger place with an emphasis on a quality patty that is let down by a slightly dry burger. Still - have a couple of beers first and this place will seem like heaven on earth."}
{"text":"I stopped by for dinner on a Tuesday night and had a great dining experience. I've eaten at the Yonge St. location, so I knew what to expect from the menu. The burgers are yummy and juicy. The fries and onion rings are also great! The service is friendly and organized. I was impressed (and relieved) to find this location has A LOT more space than the Yonge St. Craft Burger, which is always a contentious issue between me and my husband when I drag him to one of my favourite burger joints in TO."}
{"text":"tried the crazy burger and it was good. perfectly grilled, and tons of toppings. loved the panko breaded onion rings as well. service a little slow so 3 stars instead of 4"}
{"text":"Ok where do i start...  I used to come here regularly both the onion rings and burgers were great however slightly overpriced for what you get on the plate, basically a handful of onion rings with a burger combo for $17 is slightly expensive in my opinion. I used to come here with the wife dinner for two would be $35 Taxes in.  Although the restaurant is clean and the burgers are good... The staff are so rude and dont make you feel like they want to work there.  One person in particular the cashier with the mohawk very rude and abrubt never smiles or makes small talk although you go there all the time. Place tends to get over crowded and the seating arrangement is not ideal..   Improve on your customer skills and take a look at your prices. I have stopped going here because of these issues and started getting my burger fix from Capitano Burgers down the road instead much better quality meat and buns all organic and amazing customer skills. Burger combo for under $10 where can you go wrong with those prices."}
{"text":"I would compare the Burgers at Big Smoke to 5 Guys and Burgers Priest! Everytime I go to Yorkdale I always get a Burger and Fries wether it be to Stay or to Go!  I recommend this Burger Place to people that wanna try something Different then Burgers Priest or 5 Guys! Big Smoke is definitely in my Top 5 for Best Burgers!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Big Smoke Burger, it was pretty impressive considering all there burgers are made to order therefore they are fresh. There burgers are done medium rare, if you're the type of person who likes it well done it can requested during your order. They don't just only serve beef burgers, they offer veggie, chicken, lamb or organic beef as substitutions, but pricing may vary.   I ordered a Crazy Burger with a side of onion rings and a bottle of water it came up to nearly $15, it may seem a bit pricey for a meal, however you need to be considerate that you cannot find a burger joint that has good fresh tasting toppings and the beef actually tastes like beef; not some mushy beef patty served at Mcdonald's. Aside from the burger the onion rings came with five to seven pieces roughly, but it was really satisfying - as the onion rings were cooked to perfection and they were really filling.   The service was pretty fast, burger was not that greasy, well put together, and clean environment considering it's a pretty decent size burger joint on Yonge Street. Overall it gave me a good impression and would go there again."}
{"text":"Ok, so five stars may be a bit much, (I came on a snowy Saturday when getting in and out quickly actually happened) but here's where I am putting this place above some others...  1. The basic burger was rock solid without being puny or monstrous. It was a perfect size. It is also fresh, not frozen beef. The Dijon mustard was great and the toppings fresh. 2. The \"combo\" with onion rings came in around 10$, negligibly more than the heavily processed crap you've had too many times at major burger chains. 3. The onion rings are amazing. They are pre-breaded somewhere else, but they are simply perfect. 4. I was actually asked how I liked my burger by one staff member and heard \"thank you for coming by\" from someone else. Few places in town seem to know you even walked in the door, much less care. I really appreciated the thoughtfulness.  I will be back."}
{"text":"We've been to this location about 5 times, the first 3 times were great.  Juicy burgers and high-quality beef.  Fries for some reason, on all occasions were limp and warm, not hot.  I think they fry and scoop them up too soon, should be better timed with the burgers.  The last 2 times, the burgers were dry, fries still warm, even after asking for them to be hot, please and thanks.  Can't compare to Burger's Priest or Holy Chuck."}
{"text":"I walked into Big Smoke Burger for a late lunch so it wasn't surprising that I was the only diner there for most of my visit. They have lots of choices on their menu and the lone server/cashier was great in helping me to decide what to order.  I settled on the Craft Burger - sauteed mushrooms, house-made rosemary-garlic mayo, lettuce, tomato, and I added Swiss cheese. I made it a combo with fries and a can of pop.  The burger was pretty darn good! It was juicy without being messy and all the flavours worked very well together but I could have used more mushrooms (for my taste). The fries were also very well done and crispy.  While waiting for my meal, the server did a pretty good job of cleaning and sanitizing the tables and even the walls. Nice.  The food was definitely good enough for me to want to come back and try more.  Maybe I'll have the Lamb burger next, or the fried chicken..."}
{"text":"There was much buzz around this place.  A burger place in Urban Eatery? Might as well! I like me some burgers.  I had the Crazy Burger, because I love food that have a little kick to it!  It was good, but I wasn't happy with the fact that coleslaw and chipotle was dripping sauce all over my hands (but, what else do you expect?) However, the bun was a mess. It fell apart on me after a few bites -- my friend experienced the same thing.   If the buns were a bit better, I would've been happier."}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints around! Love the spicy burger with a second patty! Also their fries are top notch!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best burgers i've had. I have tried every type of beef burger they have on the menu. All are solid."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since it was called Craft burger. Big Smoke used to be my favourite burger joint, and I would always spread the word to anyone who asked. I ate here for the first time in almost a year (I've been watching what I eat), and I'm sorry to say that it has taken a downward turn.  I had the Craft burger as I always have, and the bun tasted like low-quality Wonder bread (this was not the case in the past). I ordered my burger medium-well, however it came out closer to well done. To top it off, the price has increased (just the burger cost me almost $10 after taxes, whereas it used to be about $8.50 after tax).  I will be looking for a new go-to burger joint in the area."}
{"text":"Don't think I will ever come back after they ruined the fries and poutine. Any burger joint can't cook their fries right don't deserve return visits. By the way, yes, their burger is tiny and yes, if you order Fring, you only got 3 onion rings."}
{"text":"This is my first time in Canada. Kayleigh and Celine are two of the greatest people I've met my entire life- they not only served me a delicious, medium well burger but also taught me helpful Canadian words. Also Zack, another employee here, is a fantastic individual who took the time to chat with me.  Overall, I would come here everyday if I lived here! 10/5."}
{"text":"Usually a great place in the hood to grab a burger, but awful service tonight from the lady at cash - very automated and almost depressed...too bad ;("}
{"text":"Now that's something you shouldn't expect from a $8.50  burger - badly burnt. I was the only one in line during the lean lunch time, around 1pm and 10-15 min I waited, they hardly got 2 more customers. Then why did they burn it? Even they did, why didn't they care to apologize and replace? I walked 15 minutes before I took the first bite and by that time, all I could do was ..... you guessed it right..... curse them. For when I sit down to eat & have paid as per your rates, they should live up to my expectations; for that matter everybody's.   Did I mention - Jalapeño & onion pieces were thrown in, so I on bite I got 3 pcs of Jalapeño, you can imagine my situation. C'mon put ur heart  & soul into your job now that Wynn has raised the minimum to $14/$15"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love burgers and often resort to a good burger joint for comfort food. To our surprise, the Big Smoke Burger turned out to be quite tasty!  We ordered the spicy burger which had sautéed onions, lettuce,  tomato and spicy mayo. Overall, the burger was moist and had a lot of flavor. We also turned this into a combo with a poutine and a drink and to our surprise, the poutine was also amazing. Great flavor with the gravy, thick cut fries and actual cheese curds!   Unfortunately, the only down fall with the Big Smoke Burger was the cost. After all said and done: a quaint sized burger, poutine and drink came up to a grand total of $15, hence the rating of 4 out of 5. Otherwise, if the price was a little more reasonable, it would be a perfect rating."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why, as an unwritten rule, once a restaurant goes into a mall food court, the quality of the food drops considerably. (And yet the price goes up!)  I've been to one of the downtown locations of Big Smoke a few times and have always been satisfied with the quality of the burgers, so I figured I'd give this location a try. (One can only eat so much Made in Japan, after all.)  Anyway, I decided to go with the Spicy Burger (\"caramelized onions, house-made chipotle mayo, jalapenos, lettuce, tomato\"). The overwhelming flavor here comes from those caramelized onions, which are so sweet and so plentiful that it's very difficult to taste anything else. There's a hint of heat in the background thanks to the chipotle mayo and jalapenos, but it's so mild that this dish should really be called the Kinda Sorta but Not Really Spicy Burger.  And as for the patty itself, it was overcooked and dry as heck. Given that I paid almost $10 for this thing, I'd say take a pass on Big Smoke and just hit the McDonald's a few stores over."}
{"text":"Overall positive experience. Fries were very good and lots of 'em. Place had a big open feel and of course as it is new was very clean. Service was great. The only thing questionable was the size of the burger, seemed smallish. Tasted great though, definitely had a \"big smoke\"y taste."}
{"text":"Sweet  baby Jebus that was good!    On this rainy lunch hour I was hit with a serious meat craving that I knew would not be allayed by some bland fast food outlet.  Thankfully, Big Smoke is just a couple blocks down from my office and umbrella in hand I made the jaunt.  Line up was practically out the door.  Usually I find that  inclement weather reduces the number of people that venture out beyond the PATH system.  No matter.  My determination for meaty satisfaction gave me strength.  But I was torn...  Go with the Signature Big Smoke Burger (horseradish mayo, caramelized onions, smoked cheddar, tomato & lettuce)?  Or the Crazy Burger (jalapeno havarti, coleslaw, chipotle mayo, bbq sauce, hot peppers & lettuce)?  A bit of back and forth resulted in the Big Smoke combo.  Can I just say it's really nice to see a place serving fountain ginger ale?  Don't seem to see that much and it the only soda I drink, so thanks Big Smoke.  Holy mother!  That burger was amazing; juicy, sloppy, great toppings... and the fries, the FRIES!   Literally people, the best fries I think I've ever had... crispy, golden brown, just salty enough... sooooo good.  Didn't think I'd get all the way through the massive portion, but they were too delicious not to finish.    The wait was significant, this is true, but I'll definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I was at Yorkdale mall, shopping for Christmas gifts and had built up a serious craving for a juicy burger so I tried Big Smoke. I opted for the veggie burger and found it rather dry. 3 packets of ketchup later, the burger was moist (hate that word) enough to eat. Fries were alright, nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"NOT Impressed.   I just went here for lunch and paid more than $12 for a mediocre veggie burger with onion rings.   The Burger: Tasted fine, but at more than $12 bucks, I expected something a lot better. I was here before they rebranded from Craft Burger and nothing has really changed.   When I figure out how to upload a picture, you will see that my burger with everything on it was so pitifully put together. The single tomato they placed perfectly in the center of the burger covered approximately 30% of the sandwich. The single, limp, disintegrating pickle was a pitiful addition. I ended up adding more ketchup to the half teaspoon they put on it.   The Onion Rings: Pretty good, but at $3.25 they were way overpriced. You get 5 medium sized rings. They taste just like any other thick cut onion rings though, so they're nothing special.   My final verdict on this place is that I won't be going back. When I say I want everything on my burger, I expect to taste everything. When I ask for tomato on my burger, I expect to have a bite of tomato on every bite. Same goes for all the other condiments. The mayo was smeared from the centre of the bun out to an edge leaving most of the bun untouched.   Hero Burger has a much much better burger and it's cheaper. This place is all hype in my opinion."}
{"text":"In general, I'm not a fan of burgers & fries, though now and again, I'll get a craving for it. That being said, this place isn't bad for a burger & fries joint (although for approx. $12 for a combo, it better not be!) Their burgers are made fresh, and grilled to your liking. Toppings, of course, are your choice, though their selection of sauces is pretty 'gourmet' for fast food standards (rosemary garlic mayonnaise!). I had the Blue Burger (I was sold as soon as I saw 'avocado' as one of the toppings) with onion rings. Although I asked for \"no tomatoes\", lo and behold there were a couple of red rings hiding in the lettuce (easy enough to take out, but annoying considering I did specify). The burger itself was, for me, nothing spectacular (but then, it could be because I'm not a burger connoisseur to begin with). The onion rings looked great, but were a little overdone for my liking. Reviews for the poutine & milkshakes might be the only reason I'd come back to this place."}
{"text":"Big Smoke is literally one of my favourite places to get a burger and I love this location the most! Food is always fresh and my burger is always made perfectly. Fries are fresh as well.   Pros: Food: I love the Swiss burger, Craft and Spicy burger.  Quality: As I've mentioned above, quality is always there. Fries are always hot and fresh and burger is always juicy and tender.   Cons: Price: It is a little pricey in comparison to other burger joints, but the quality is there! It's about $30 for 2 people to eat.   I love this place! Will continue to keep coming!"}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed with my food. For the price you are paying for, the food was not good at all.   I ordered a Spicy Burger, Craft burger, fries and a drink. I have ordered previously from other locations, so I know what it should to usually expect. Both of the burgers were so dry. The meat wasn't juicy and the buns were not hot. The meat was so overcooked. You can also tell that the fries were not fresh either. They had been sitting in the basket for a while. While I do understand that sometimes it can get busy, the quality of the food was compromised which is very unfortunate.    Overall, I will not be coming back to this location. I love Big Smoke, but this location really disappointed."}
{"text":"There are so many detailed reviews here that my 2 cents is probably only worth 1 - if that.  Loved: as I was reading the menu board, grill guy says \"is it gunna be beef?\" so that he could get my burger started, regardless of my toppings.  Loved: service at the cash, super friendly & genuine. They take your name and when they called out mine, it was more of a familiar \"Chris, dinner is ready!\" rather than a monotone \"next...\"  Loved: the \"plate\", a metal rectangular thing, made the burger look that much better.  Loved: the burger. Really, really did. It was messy, about 4 napkins messy. Awesome. I could taste each and every ingredient. So good.  Loved: the little window seat. I would go back for that seat alone.   Next time: I hear the Onion Rings are killer.  Wish: WiFi"}
{"text":"Big burger at $6.50 was very good!  Poutine, large, at 6.50 was just ok. Quantity was pathetic.  I will just come back for the burger."}
{"text":"A surprisingly tasty burger from a food court joint. The fries are awesome too. There were A LOT of choices so I went with the classic Big Smoke and I will definitely go back to try the rest!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this restaurant before but I thought I would check it out while I was at the mall. I was pleasantly surprised because this was one of the best bacon cheeseburgers I have ever had in my life. I will definitely be coming back here again. I recommend that others eat here as well."}
{"text":"Although it's a bit of a wait for your burger keep in mind it's because they are freshly made in the kitchen, and it's certainly worth the wait. The Big Smoke Burger and the Spicy Burger are my favorites, even though the Spicy Burger isn't actually spicy at all.  The poutine is huge and can be eaten as a meal on its own. Onion rings are top notch."}
{"text":"I came here for an early lunch and the service was quite fast so I got my food fairly quickly, unlike the slow service mentioned in the other reviews.    I had ordered the Big Smoke Burger with a side of onion rings/soda and honestly, I did not think that my meal was worth the $13 or so that I paid.  The burger was good, but honestly, I find it hard for somebody to screw up a burger anyways.  The onion rings were average and I just felt that it was an extremely overpriced food court eatery.    I would much rather spend my money at an actual restaurant since $13 is enough for a decent meal but I didn't really have much of a choice at the time."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. Their base burgers are reasonably priced, that is until you put a few extras on it $17.06 to be exact.... that's one jerk chicken burger...The jerk chicken burger was a soggy mess and not very favourable. Not worth the price at all."}
{"text":"Hmmmm so after coming to square one for the first time this place definitely caught my eye! So second time going to square one I definitely came here!   I got the classic* big smoke burger as recommended by the employee there. The fries here are so good! Reminded me of nyc fries but better!   So I love a nice juicy burger that maintain shape for as long as it can haha. At first this burger maintained shape. Roughly 3 bites till finish it becomes quite sloppy which is OK for me since the middle is all gone. The meat was amazing the bun was grilled, sweet onions, some kind of exotic cheese I don't know how to spell or remember and a tomato that didn't come out on first bite. Oh man it was quite a nice burger haha.   Definitely will come back to try another!"}
{"text":"I'm fascinated by the momentary trend of the fancypants burger joint.  People who wouldn't be caught dead ordering a \"hamburger\" flock into the place for the wood-paneled ambiance and information-heavy menu in search of words like \"quality\" and \"exotic\".   They want important sounding ingredients.  They need to have a menu that speaks in their language.  Everything is overexplained in mouth-watering detail.   It's not \"a burger and fries\", it's \"AAA grade beef patties served with a side accoutrement of hand-cut french-fried PEI potatoes\".    One man's ketchup is another's imported Italian tomato glaze.  Hamburgers are always delicious.  Face it.  You don't come here because of the food.  You come here because of the company.  You want to eat in a place that represents an environment of where you want to see yourself.   The homeless people at the fast food joint down the street sicken you.   You don't want to eat out of a cardboard box.   You don't want to stare at picture of a crazed clown playing with multicultural children.   You don't want to talk to someone wearing a headset.  Is Craft Burger good?    It's great.   Superb, actually.       Extremely consistent, with none of the riff-raff."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  I'm willing to give this place a second chance, as I was only unable to try the burger since I was in a rush. The poutine, fries, and onion rings looked soooooo good!  I had the craft burger, seeing how I love sauteed mushrooms inside my burger, and it was relatively decent priced. They also had the limited-time offer Sochi burger for $5 which I really wanted, but  alas I wanted to try something a bit basic since it was my first time. The burger was ready in about 8 minutes; right at their 8-10 min prediction. Since I had it to go, they gave me a paper bag and I was on my way.  I ate the burger while waiting for the train (I had a commitment to go to in 15 minutes, so I couldn't eat in). The ingredients and taste were good, but the patty itself was a little dry. I'm no beef expert, so I don't know if beef chuck is normally this dry. However I definitely enjoyed my burger at Burger's Priest more. Again, though, the sides looked very good here, and I don't wanna completely dismiss this place until I try them.  Service was great. The female cashier in the front was very nice and social (and was shocked that I still had pennies), and the male chef inside brought out the orders promptly and efficiently."}
{"text":"I knew I was gonna be expecting food court quality even though I went to Big Smoke Burger. There's just something about food court restaurants where it always seems their food quality is lower than stand alone joints. Either way...  My order this time was the big smoke burger. I had the craft burger when I was at the Yonge/Bloor location, but this time I wanted something with cheese. Of course, since this was in the urban eatery, I had an actual fine plate with an actual glass cup for my drink. Environmentalism!  Of course, since this is the urban eatery and all restaurants are like that, I will overlook the environmental factors and focus only on the food. The burger was good, although initially the toppings were rather clumsily put on. I did eventually organize them better though. I didn't have the fries, onion rings, or poutine, so I won't judge on those.  I still prefer Burger's Priest over this place in general, but there is the price factor, in which this place is cheaper than BP. I still haven't tried Holy Chuck yet...perhaps I'll give it a try sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Big Smoke Burger is one of the better burger joints around Bloor! I love how I can just order the food off of their app (Ritual) and the food is fresh and hot even when I bring it back home.   The inside is pretty roomy but I'm not a fan of their tables- they either wobble, or are rather dirty, or otherwise too small to actually sit comfortably in. There's only one cashier, who might be in the kitchen and won't attend to you quickly. So I really suggest just ordering it to-go, or ordering the food from the app.  Their poutine is really great! The fries are completely drenched in gravy, but still remain crispy. I also love how the cheese curds stretch on for miles- sooo delicious. You can add and customize your food however you want, and the add-on prices are fair. Their burgers are quite good as well, but I prefer their poutine more.   I like how their burger patties come from local sources, as well as their promise to keep their ingredients gourmet and fresh. I will definitely be coming back.   Favorites: craft poutine!"}
{"text":"This burger place was a short walk from our hotel and on the morning before we left we decided to test out one of Toronto's supposed \"best burgers.\"  Call me a snob but this is no shake shack. My cheeseburger was overdone and the cheese was WAY too smoky.  I could barely taste the meat (who came up with that pairing?)  On the other hand, the fries and onion rings were delicious. So all in all, the meal was not a total loss :)"}
{"text":"I finally ate here after hearing all the hype about this chain from a bunch of random people.  I went for lunch and the place was way too small and packed to get a table. annoying. I ordered the organic beef burger with onion rings. The burger was really good. The onion rings were nice and crispy.   Hmm.. I donno, maybe the inability to get a table is actually what is stopping me from giving it 4 stars.."}
{"text":"Good burger place, on par with others like the Gourmet Burger Co., Hero, etc. I had the Craft burger - beef, mushrooms, garlic mayo, lettuce, tomato. Didn't try to fries, although they looked really good!! Slower than fast-food, expect to wait 10 minutes for them to make your burger (but really, that's a good thing!). Staff are nice and bring your food to your table. I went on a Sunday around lunch hour and it wasn't too busy, so I was able to get a seat. Good spot for a quick bite in Yorkville (considering there aren't a lot of cheap food options in the area and I hate spending $10 on a tiny sandwich from Holt's Cafe/Lettieri)."}
{"text":"I visit the Craft Burger (aka Big Smoke Burger) at Yonge/Bloor often and find their burgers pretty solid. So I was disappointed with this location, that just doesn't measure up. I came by after work and it was busy, but the line moved pretty efficiently. The menu has a good variety of both beef and non-beef choices. Of note, the veggie burger costs more than the beef burgers, which I thought was strange. They also have chicken, lamb, and turkey. There's an organic beef option as well (if it is the same as the Bloor location, they get their meat from The Healthy Butcher). Options for sides: fries, onion rings, or salad.  I had the \"Craft Burger\" (rosemary garlic mayo, sauteed mushrooms, lettuce, tomato) combo. The burger was a bit too well-done for me... really crunchy on the outside. The mushrooms were yummy, but iceberg lettuce? -1. The fries didn't taste all that fresh. They tasted like they had been sitting around for a while, which was weird given that it was a really busy time of day.  I do like that if you are eating in the food court, you get a real glass and real dish instead of styrofoam. It definitely makes the food court dining experience feel a little bit nicer (not to mention, more environmentally friendly!). The staff here are also really friendly. They all seemed really calm despite the growing lineup and tried to engage with customers, as in \"here's your soda! hey, nice t-shirt!\" But, the food wasn't great and it seems like there are way better options at the Urban Eatery."}
{"text":"A very small eatery with perhaps three tables. Its mostly a take-out place and can be quite noisy with long line ups. The burgers were fresh and the ingredients added value. The price points were reasonable and the milk shakes were A-OK. There were some complaints about the fries being overly done and poorly seasoned. Not sure this place is worth all the hype. Sorry.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes but I was somewhat disappointed.  The biggest fault is overcooking the beef.  It was cooked to the point of being a little dry.  There still was a tiny bit of moistness, but when I go out for a burger I want the messy factor to at least be a 2+ articles of clothing soiled.  The onion rings were excellent.  I would return just to eat them.  The quality of the ingredients (that I could see) was great.  The meat looked beautiful as it went on the grill.  The meat did taste ok, but I couldn't experience the full flavour spectrum only offered by less cooking.  I will return and I will ask if I can get it cooked less."}
{"text":"What to say..what to say. This is a brand new Big Smoke Burgers. I would call this a \"Gourmet\" burger place as burgers cost between $6.00-$10.00 when done. I would also give it a 3.5* vs 3*. Everything's al-la-Carte. No combos that I saw. The burger & fries that I had were just good not delicious. The size of the fries order was a little on the small side considering what the cost is for a quick serve restaurant. I did like the topping options. I had the Creamy Horseradish with I really liked. They also offered a dessert option which I thought is unique. One more thing...the staff was very pleasant but when I asked for a nutritional value count...none existed.   It occurred to me that I eat too much beef but what the heck!! This is a do-over but I would go outta my way to get there."}
{"text":"Got my order wrong, but no big deal. Patty wasn't exactly dry (definitely not medium rare) but it wasn't juicy either. Everything was just about average; a clean burger and light onion rings. Nothing special."}
{"text":"2.5  Pros: Decent burger  Cons: Pricey Sides could be a lot better  Big Smoke gets the job done when it comes to burgers.  It won't wow you or anything though.  It's better than the cheaper chains, but it doesn't quite hold up to the other premium gourmet burgers available in the city.  Big Smoke at the very least is a little kid friendly.  It's got a large spacey atmosphere and does have high chairs for the little ones.  There are no kids meals here though.  When I was searching online, I noticed they had a smaller burger on the menu online.  I thought this would be great for my little one.  When I got here though, I was disappointed to find out they don't make the smaller burger at this particular location.  We ordered 2 combos, one with a poutine and one with onion rings.  The burgers like I said get the job done, no more no less.  The patty itself was OK.  A little bit on the dry side but nothing bad at all.  When you pay over $30 for 2 combos though, you're kinda expecting more from the burger.  I just didn't feel it was worth what I paid.  The sides here are what totally brings it down for me.  The onion rings were the plainest I've ever had.  They were thick cut, which is a plus.  However, taste wise there was nothing to talk about.  The poutine comes in this weird cone shaped bowl which is not a good thing when it comes to poutine.  Only the top layer of fries get hit with the gravy and cheese curds.  By the time you get to the bottom half, there's no fry that's touched any gravy and cheese.  Couple that with the fact the fries aren't good to begin whit and you have a disappointing poutine.    All in all, Big Smoke should be a lot better for what you're paying.  Like I said, it will get the job done. For what you're paying though, it should of been a lot better."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of buying burgers but putting that aside, I think this is one of the better expensive burger places to go to.  I got the blue burger  with gorgonzola, avocado, rosemary garlic mayo, tomato and lettuce. I made it a combo by adding onion rings and a soda which came to a total of $10.45 before tax.  I got this burger mostly because of the avocado. It was very difficult to eat because the burger was huge ... mostly because of the avocado but I still enjoyed it!  I was full eating just the burger but since I got the onion rings, I had to finish that off. It was good. I don't remember it being spectacular but it was good. I think I'm so used to eating Burger King's onion rings, it's hard for me to review other restaurant's onion rings.  It took a while for them to make the burger but at least you know it's fresh! I can't justify buying another burger here because of the price but if I was made of money, I would come here more often."}
{"text":"Average burger and fries, the same as any other place. Burger was kind of bland and the fries are greasy, at least the fellow behind the counter helped me to my table"}
{"text":"Ritual Order - 2.5 Food was immediately ready and temperature was still great when I got back to my office. Staff was efficient and polite. I ordered a Craft burger with mushrooms and a poutine as a side. Poutine was hot with loads of cheese curds. The cheese was nice and stringy. Gravy tasted like packaged stuff filled with MSG, but better than most fast food chains like McDonalds and Harveys. (Significantly sub par compared to NYFries) Burger however was a bust. Patty was dry and bun bottom was soggy. Mushrooms tasted good but not enough to save the burger."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had in my life.  I'll be dreaming about those caramelized onions."}
{"text":"Love their burgers.   Fries are awesome too. Even better as poutine.   We had 7 people in the group and ordered three or four different burgers from the menu. I went with the one called Big Smoke (same as the place) and didn't regret it.   Good food takes time to make. They precook exactly nothing. So be ready to wait for your order a bit, especially if it's a busy time."}
{"text":"Hands down best veggie burger in the city!! Tips: Get the white bun and not the whole wheat. Bring a friend and each get a combo - one gets fries, one gets their delicious fried donuts, I mean, onion rings!  Staff is friendly, remembers us and quality is always good.   Pre-ordering a large order is helpful as they are always busy and you can skip the line for pick up."}
{"text":"First and last time for me. My burger was edible but I didn't enjoy it. Nothing gourmet about it. The fries were cold and the gravy was coloured water. They don't serve coke, only Pepsi."}
{"text":"Went to Big Smoke Burgers, back to back for poutine. Yes I know .....   CF Eaton Location  - Great staff. Quick service. Really wanted to try the \" Cheesy Poblano Poutine \", but they ran out :-(. Was recommend the Craft poutine, so ordered a large for take out. Number 1, you get alot of poutine, literally good for 2 people. Somehow I managed to finish it, end of the day 100% satisfied. Good ingredients were used, great fries, curds, and gravy, simple combination, that rosemary-mayo went well.     50 King Street East  - Great friendly staff, clean location, nice atmosphere to dine in. Still wanting to try the Cheesy Poblano Poutine, went the next day to this location. Yes I know .... Apparently the premium poutines only come in the large size? To my surprise the portion was noticeably smaller than the previous day despite being a large. Maybe its a dine in thing. Came in a metal cup container, but I dont know on the positive side I saved some calories. Despite that still enjoyed it. Great fries, curds, cheese sauce, the tomato topping was skimpy in my opinion but still a good combination and meal overall.   I recommend Big Smoke Burgers poutines. Would definitely go back. If your really hungry just get take out."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food, they have a great selection and will make it the way YOU like it! Unfortunately I didn't enjoy the seating while I was there, and found it very uncomfortable. I was also with my boyfriend and his parents and I felt very crowded with them. If I go back, I plan on getting take out rather than eating there."}
{"text":"I love love love the craft spicy burger. I love the caramelized onions and the sesame seed bun. The fries are so damn good, fresh cut and and fried nice and brown..drool....The service is pretty good too. The price point is pretty reasonable, we go about twice a month. The milkshakes are huge!!! The table/booth seating is pretty comfortable...cant say the same about the trendy office chair seating...but then I have a 1 year old and those chairs just dont work :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite burger joints and its ranking is pretty high up there with Burger's Priest.  I used to come to this place when it was still called \"Craft Burger\". Everything's the same, only some of the names have changed. I still love their specialty burger with the mushrooms and house special sauce. Def a plus for anyone who loves their mushrooms! The burgers are nice, but I do prefer the soft, juicy, fall-apart-in-your-mouth patty they have at Burger's Priest. If I could have Burger's Priest's patty with the mushroom and sauce at Big Smoke's. WOOOW it would be so peeeerfect.  In addition, seating is really limited and it's really difficult to plan coming with a group larger that 3-4. Customer service was not anything spectacular either, hence only four stars in total.  Just a little side note, I have been to the location at Eaton's Centre and it just is not taste the same! Seems to be a bit of discrepancy in terms of quality depending on location."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, and I think this place is better at night then at lunch. Every time I've gone at night I've had to wait for my burger, and I appreciated it! They have a sign that says it takes 8-10 minutes for your burger as it is cooked fresh. When it is fresh, it is tasty! Sadly I went for lunch one day and they handed me a burger pretty much right away... and it was below what I had experienced before. The toppings are fun. I recommend the crazy burger. And the lamb burger is a great price for lamb anything. And the onion rings are really great too.  EDIT: On my latest visit, I did notice the size of the burgers aren't that big... which I think can lead to the burgers being overcooked/dry compared to some of the gourmet burgers in the city."}
{"text":"Really nice burger, inconsistent medium-well cook on not perfectly fresh meat, but good enough, served straight out of a well-hidden kitchen of secret magic. Toppings on the \"spicy\" burger were really nice- perfectly done caramelized onions whose fallen brethren were carefully lifted from the tray to be consumed after those which stuck to the burger were enjoyed with said burger; mayo on the spicy side, but not mouth-burning hot to any extent; and fresh veggies. A single solid piece of lettuce beats the stuffing out of shredded lettuce than winds up all over the place rather than in its intended receptacle: ma belleh. Onion rings done to perfection: great crumb coating and deep fryer operated with the kind of perfect timing one can only achieve using the timer on a deep fryer. Cane sugar soda is the drink of champs. Nicely done all-round, worth the premium cost over the standard chains. 4.5/5"}
{"text":"First time here... went with two of my colleagues.  I picked the Kraft because it was on top of the board and I reckoned it would be their main and most popular item given how it my debut visit. It was flavourful. The bun and the patty were nice and the condiments were tasted fine and were placed on the patty in just the right amount.  However, I do not think I will be back. I seem to have developed a thing against hamburger joints for several reasons.  General misgivings: unhealthy food. Turned off by these 'premium' burger chains since found out years ago that Burger's priest is a homophobic Christian organization who posts anti-gay union videos on his website that is run by a preacher who refuses to open on Sundays. Yup, well granted since those ten years ago the man being a good Christian has sold out and has franchises open on Sunday and removed the offensive bigotry, but the bad taste lingers in my mouth. generally speaking I am finding that Harveys and A&W have cheaper burgers that have taste and in the case of A&W advertise no-hormone beef, etc.  Specific misgivings: the burger was flavourful, but I do not like paying $10 for a hamburger. Sorry, just not my cup of tea - especially because the hamburger was so small I walked out hungry. The value was not as terrible as Wahlburgers, because the burger here was not disgusting or greasy, but still. Secondly, the dine-in area was dirty. The table was sticky and they did not clean it or wipe the stickiness and discarded napkins from our table. The hamburgers also took quite a while to make it to our table. I have to say that the lady did bring the hamburgers to our table if that is a plus. Moreover, you are given a choice of how you want your meat cooked and whether you want a regular bun, a whole wheat bun or lettuce."}
{"text":"Although a lot smaller than the burgers served up across the border, big smoke burger serves up a high quality product. You can actually taste the quality in the beef itself. The fries are especially satisfying"}
{"text":"Came here for Yelp's Burger Binge.  Big Smoke was supposed to offer a $5 Spicy Yelp Burger, but instead they served me a Classic/Regular Burger.  I didn't check the special on the Yelp site prior to ordering, so I didn't realise that they changed it up until I got home and reread the special.  :(  So not really impressed by this bait 'n switch!  I asked how much it was to make it a combo (fries + drink) and it was almost +$5 extra.  So there has been a definite price increase since my last visit.  No thanks.  Burger didn't taste any different than the other chains, Burger King/McD's/etc. so I can live without dining here again."}
{"text":"3.5/5.  The newest burger joint in York Mills. I've tried this chain once before on Niagara On The Lake and  enjoyed it a lot. I enjoyed the food here as well. Quality is definitely UP THERE. I got The Craft burger which was pretty much a perfect combination of ingredients. This location didn't ask me how well I liked my burgers done while NOTL did...that's the only big difference here. Spotless tables and bottomless fountain drinks. The Craft was worth its price tag. I still prefer other gourmet burger joints though..."}
{"text":"The Poutine still ROCKS, but Craft Burger you let me down the other day with my burger....I asked for ketchup and extra pickles and all I got was the ketchup :(  We were way a head of the lunch rush - so there was no excuse.  Step it up Craft burger, or you will only be getting my poutine orders."}
{"text":"$13 for a smallish (but admittedly tasty) burger on a soggy, disintegrating bun, and a handful of bland onion rings or flaccid fries. No thanks."}
{"text":"We had a late lunch today at Craft Burger.  We've been wanting to check them out for a while but it's always really busy ... it's not a big place (there are only four tables).  My husband had a cheese burger combo with onion rings. I had a classic burger combo with fries.  The burger was really good (4 stars) ... the fries were so-so (2.5 stars). Next time, I'd just get a burger.  If you are craving a burger, you should check it out!"}
{"text":"Yes, this place is a staple for me as it's right around the corner from work.  I know other people feel like there are better burger chains in Toronto but I'm pretty content here with Big Smoke. Their Blazing Pineapple burger is something to be envied and a burger that I have WAY more than I should. Their fries are top shelf and are something that has co workers \"conveniently\" stop by my desk for no other reason than to grab some!  I like that they offer Boylan's here too. There is something better about sodas when they are made with sugar instead of corn syrup."}
{"text":"If you want cheap burgers (cheap in price and more cheap to make), there is a McDonald's not too far from here. If you want juicy, great tasting, and made-the-way-you-like-it burgers, this is the place. You will be paying about 50-100% more than McDonald's, but you will enjoy your burgers a hundred times more. Their staff are friendly and are great if you can't decide what to get."}
{"text":"Little place that's really convenient. Me and my friend were really craving a burger and got them to go. I got the original burger while my friend got one of their fancier ones (the name, I do not remember). Their prices are kinda high so I expected a large burger that would take me two days to finish. I ordered the combo with fries and a can of coke while my friend decided on a combo with onion rings. Like I said before, this place is small so we had to sit at one of the dine-in tables to wait. Note: the tables are super close together so don't come here and expect an intimate dining experience. Well, we waited around 20 minutes for them to be done and all this time, it was getting really stuffy in there because the kitchen is steps away from the register and dine-in area. At this point, I was getting quite frustrated because I had paid more than I had intended to with the burger and was waiting for longer than I had intended to.  Finally, we get our paper bags and happily carry them to eat elsewhere. The burger itself was pretty good but smaller than I anticipated it would be. The bun held up great. The fries were really yummy and my friend actually ate more of my fries than her onion rings.  I'll probably be back, and in a city where a lone burger costs around $10 in so many establishments, Big Smoke Burger is kinda worth it I guess."}
{"text":"Today I went to Big Smoke Burger. Big Smoke used to be called Craft Burger and then, a few years ago, they changed the name. Why? I do not know. Should they of? Potentially. You see, when they were Craft Burger they were one of the first, if not the first, and one of the only gourmet burger joints in Toronto. They prided themselves in their quality and they had line ups out the door everyday and almost all the time.  Since those days it seems like a million gourmet burger joints have opened up in the GTA, half of them being Hero Burger. With all this competition did Craft Burger have a product that was as good or better or worse than the competition? Did Craft Burger stand to grow bigger or die out? So in order to feel new and fresh they changed their name. This and the fact that they couldn't copyright the original name.  I have eaten at Craft Burger many times and at Big Smoke Burger once before. When there were not that many options I loved this burger. Then competition became fierce and I became less of a fan and I rarely go out of my way to eat here. But today is burger review day and today I chose to return to one of Toronto's originals. My memories are that the burger, while good, is not the best burger out there and falls somewhere in the range of just above average. Let's see if my memory is correct shall we?  This time out I went to the Yorkdale location which is located in the upscale food court of the mall. Thusly the aesthetics of a Big Smoke Burger cannot be discussed but this, as always, is all about the burger. So, like most places they have a Classic, Double, Chicken and Veggie Burger. Then they have their signature burgers such as on Organic Beef Burger, Crazy Burger or the Craft Burger. These signature burgers include toppings such as gorgonzola, roasted red peppers, cilantro-feta spread and caramelized onions.  After waiting in line (it was a busy Saturday lunch) I ordered the usual. A double burger (which was 12 oz of meat) with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, ketchup and mustard. Add mayo, substitute dijon mustard for regular and you have all the toppings available at no cost. I ordered it, of course well done and I made it a combo with fries and a coke. All told it cost 16 and change. While I waited I was able to watch the open space grill grill my burger. It looked delicious and I was salivating in anticipation. 5 minutes later it was ready.  I dug into the fries first. They were good but different from the older days. They were fresh cut and very much like Golden Star. Sadly, and this is happening more and more, there were way to many small and smaller fries in the bowl. Too small to hold and dip and to small to be pronged perfectly by a fork. Not all the fries were small but a good many of them were. Anyways they tasted good so I can't complain to much.  Then I bit into the burger. To steal a phrase from the walls of Five Guys, it was 'mouth wateringly delicious'. Better than I remember it. It was beefy and had a good texture and you could tell it was a fresh patty that had never been frozen. And it was juicy, juicy, juicy. It was well done and cooked perfectly; the juices dripped continually onto my plate. I ordered the double, two 6 oz patties, and while that is to much I do think 6 oz would be to small. Throw on some of the gourmet toppings though and it would probably be just right. Speaking of just right, the patty itself was perfectly shaped and sized for the bun which was toasted to perfection.  Where the burger falls short is in the toppings I had and the overall taste. Let's discuss the toppings. The tomatoes, there were two, were perfectly cut and gave just the right amount of flavour. The mustard on one side of the bun, the ketchup on the other (clever). The onions were a tad short in supply (just barely) and the lettuce was one large and very crisp oversized piece of iceberg. I liked that it was crisp and whole but it was way to big and made the burger a little hard to eat. Then there was the pickles, or lack there of. It was a nice tasting pickle, when I could taste it, but it was so small and there was only one. Chintzy!  Now back to the taste of the burger. I said it was delicious because it was but I also said there was a problem with the taste. That problem is this: it tastes just like a many other of the grilled burgers out there. You can say that of a lot of places but then a lot of other places also have unique tastes. If I was to do a blind taste test between this and say South Street Burger's I don't think I'd be able to tell the difference. Maybe the texture is a little bit better here, I'd need to check on that. One thing I will say though, is that Big Smoke (or Craft Burger) was first, was before, was way before all these other guys so I guess their taste is actually more original.  Anyways, the burger was great.This burger is worthy of a long distance drive, it's worthy of multiple visits, it's worthy of being called delicious.   Out of 7 Big Smoke gets 6"}
{"text":"I absolutely love burgers and burritos,  I've tried many different burger joints in and around Toronto and I have to say this was one the best burgers i've had.  I took a buddy here for lunch one day.  He had the lamb burger and I had the craft burger.  We were both pleasantly impressed.    Likes: - Great tasting burger - Freshly made - Good sized food - Great decor/atmosphere (Yonge location is the one we visited) - Great customer service - Interesting art work that can be purchased.  However, i'd personally never spend the $250 asking price!  Dislikes: - Pricey (I guess expected for a location near Yorkville) - longer than average wait from the time an order is placed vs. when it is received  Overall this is a great place that i'll definitely be re-visiting in the future."}
{"text":"My go-to spot at the Yorkdale Mall food court. I love their classic burgers with the works, but I haven't ventured into their specialty burger menu. At $12 for a burger + fries + fountain drink, it's not inexpensive. That said, the burgers are cooked to order and very fresh and substantial."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and had a chance to split a lamb burger, a veggie burger, the fries, and the onion rings.  Nothing was bad, but nothing was better than okay.  Everything was quite bland except the fries which had a real potato flavor.  Even the \"spicy\" habenero cheese and BBQ sauce on the lamb burger were boring and tasteless.  The quality all seemed good, and the amount of food per dollar seemed appropriate, but there are bars in the area with better burgers.  The environment is wretched...loud, crowded, uncomfortable, and greasy.  It's like trying to have a conversation and eat with a friend while riding the subway at rush hour.  Even though it's open kinda late and that makes it a bit convenient, the bars with the better burgers are just around the corner, have better burgers, and are even more comfortable places to dine.    Before going here, check your options and you'll find something better within a block."}
{"text":"Very good. I'm impressed.   The burgers are excellent.  tired the lamb burger (which i thought was a little dry), the big smoke burger (which had excellent flavours) and the blue burger (which is excellent and is what i will always be ordering).  The fries are ok. The gravy is not bad. The poutine is better at other places. The onion rings are well done, crispy to point of pure enjoyment - but sadly, the portion on the onion rings is small.   all in all, i'm as impressed by the blue burger as i am by burger's priest."}
{"text":"The burger design is commendable for a mall food court establishment but the staff and service scream 'we just work here and don't care about how you feel'.  I waited  15 minutes for my food and they ran out of ketchup and straw when it became ready.  One staff was manning cash register and the grill at the same time  while two were idling.  Need some serious training regimen."}
{"text":"Prices were a little higher than I'd like but both the Veggie Burger ($6.95) and the Poutine ($4.95) were excellent. Size was good as well; I could barely finish the poutine and burger, which is rare for me.   There's not many seats and the place is super busy for lunch. So get there early or go for takeout.  One of the best of the new breed of gourmet burger joints."}
{"text":"Will not go back.  Ordered a craft burger with two organic beef patties.  The burgers were horribly overcooked to beyond well-done, it was hard and chewy.  It felt like I was eating two pieces of overcooked meatloaf in a bun rather than a burger.  Something was also too salty.  The mayo was good, but that was probably the only good thing about the burger.  Poutine was another big disappointment, the gravy was warm at best, too few cheese curds, and none of them were melted.  The gravy was also a little watery.  I think I'll just buy a hot dog next time."}
{"text":"- Overall, could improve if they had more customers, - kinda slow but only because of lack of customers since they would like to give fresh fries as opposed to stale fries - more of a gourmet burger joint - fairly new restaurant so mistakes are bound to be made.  - give them a few months or years and they will improve drastically.  - worth a try if you like burgers"}
{"text":"Yumm smokey beef square one missisauga offers halal beef which easily makes em the best halal burger joint  Wish all their locations did that !!"}
{"text":"I've heard about Craft Burger from both my friends and my dad. I actually know a lot about food and restaurants from good ol'pops. Enough about my family though.   I gotta say, this Craft Burger talk lived up to the hype. Although this spot is kinda smaller, I didn't find it too tiny and squishy. So far so good. Now to the burgers. Lamb burger + water + onion rings = me leaving with an extremely fully belly. And a happy belly at that. It is so good you guys! This is not your Big Mac kinda meal. Pay a lil more and get a lot more deliciousness. I hate it when you pay more and the food is still crappy. So happy it was worth it! Yum! And veggies fear not! Veggies burgers!   Next time I'm in the area and hungry,  I'm going back! So much more to try! This being said I also have to try the King St location! That is the particular one my dad raves on and on about."}
{"text":"This is my favourite burger joint in North America lol. This place is great. The burgers are juicy and flavourful. I've tried the burger with blue cheese as well as the one with avocado. Both are AMAZING!!! I went to both locations. The king street location is kinda small, so don't be surprise if you can't get a seat. Also, love the fries, it has the best amount of crispiness to them.   Writing this review is making me crave a Craft Burger.    Dear Craft Burger, if you decide to expand to the West Coast, specifically San Francisco, please let me know!!!"}
{"text":"VIBE  Whoo Boy, there's always a line up in here. They try to go as quick as they can and it's quite the shuffle inside here. If you want a long, leisurely lunch this is the wrong place. Grab and go and eat in your nearby lunch room if you can. Or at the counter. Good people watching if you don't mind dark, cavernous corners like myself with a side of the latest from the local newspaper.   I EAT/DRINK Well, it's all about the burger. But to be honest, the burger isn't as \"gourmet\" as it was hyped years ago. It's a standard burger and they give extra pickles. The fried mushrooms is a nice addition as is the cheese. Yum. Poutine is hearty; the chocolate milkshake is an indulgence. To be honest, I haven't been in a while so I wonder how the King Street location compares now especially with the competition that's swooped in since then.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Big Smoke. Is it Smoke and Mirrors? Go back to your craft. (ooh who will get the reference? Dun Dun Dun)."}
{"text":"If you are going have a restaurant that only serves burgers, you better step up your game up on your burgers. I ordered the \"blazing pineapple\" burger, and told them to make it medium well. I normally don't mind if my burgers are well done, but this burger came out Black and crispy. Unfortunately I was in a rush and it already took about 12 minutes to come out (probably why it was burnt) so I didn't get the chance to ask them to remake it.  The toppings were very underwhelming, too much mayonnaise, and the patty itself was too thin while the bun is too thick.   The fries were decent.   This is the first time I've been to Big Smoke Burger so I'm not sure how they are generally. Definitely would not recommend coming to this location!"}
{"text":"Lamb burger was good. The location is small more of a lunch or grab a quick bit to eat location. With all the burger competition, I would say they did well but not amazing."}
{"text":"I made it a point to go for a quick take out lunch since I've passed by this place a few times and have always been enticed by its clean cut exteriors and logo. It's got very clean cut interiors too: dark wooden floors, high table and a few regular tables (although cramped together) and interesting choice of lighting: encased bulbs the likes of which you see in tunnels or mines!  Since it was my first time ordering, I was a bit unsure but after consulting the cashier settled on the Crazy Burger combo, since I like my food on the spicier side. I like that the drink in the combo can be either pop or a bottle of water, unlike Subway which charges extra for getting a bottled drink. But prices here are a bit higher, $15 (tip and tax) vs. $10 at Subway (sub of the day combo).  Anyways, the food came out fast ( the cashier expedited my order!) and very neatly packed. I really enjoyed my fries, they were hand cut, thick, with skin on, and lightly salted to perfection. They could've been a bit crispier, but perhaps being packed up tightly could have taken a toll.  The burger was very good. From the outset, I tasted the smokiness: BIG CHECK. It was very compact, none of the toppings were oozing out: another check. The overall combination of flavors was pleasing.  Some things that they can improve on: The patty itself could be a bit less cooked. Waaay too much bbq sauce made the burger taste sweeter than advertised; the hot peppers didn't stand a chance against the sweet onslaught. I couldn't taste the chipotle mayo. I only tasted the cheese on my last few bites, maybe it had gotten dislodge on my way back? Next time I go, I will ask them to load up on the hot quotient of this very filling burger. I am also excited to try out their lamb burger!  I am going with 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"When my family moved to Ontario in grade ten from Manitoba, we had a hard time selling our house in Winnipeg.  We lived with my Nana for almost 8 months (it felt like FOREVER), in her condo, without a BBQ.  My Dad went a bit crazy not being able to BBQ and we all lost weight.  Finally, our house sold and we could get a new house with a new BBQ... and we did.  My Father, Bruce L. made and cooked hamburgers EVERYDAY for at least a year.  He never shoveled the driveway when it snowed, but he ALWAYS shoveled a path to and around the BBQ.  I thought I would never eat a hamburger again after grade 11, but Craft Burger changed my tune on that front.  The Good: - The actual burgers here are really, REALLY good.  They are spiced just right and are just the right size/shape.  They are fresh and made to order. - The burgers are SO good. - Did I mention the burgers?  They are better that my Dad's.  I'll deny this if you ever tell him. - Less expensive than burger shoppe (I had a combo - the daily special - and it was $10 flat.  Burger, fries, coke.) - The staff is great - the girl that keeps the traffic in this place moving in the right directions is amazing.  If the place were bigger I would want her to be on roller skates.  The Bad: - There is no bacon. - There are no sweet potato fries. - It is ALWAYS busy and it is a TERRIBLE place to have to wait around.  There is no where to stand, you get jostled, and you will undoubtedly be standing there for a really, really long time.    The weird-but-fine: - There is only Dijon mustard on the toppings list, but they have regular mustard if you ask for it.  The onion rings come pre-portioned when they put them in the fryer in little sandwich bags.    Would I eat here again? I will definitely eat here again even though it's really far from my house.  I love Craft Burger.  I wish they had a take-out window so I didn't have to wait inside."}
{"text":"Def worth a visit when you want to eat good meat and not pay too much.i preferred lettuce wrap big smoke burger, fresh ingredients with juicy beef,yummy!"}
{"text":"I went to this location after missing the chance to go the the King Street location. Was happy to finally give it a try. I ordered the veggie burger combo. The burger was pretty good and the fries were tasty too.  Good as a back burner option but not da bomb."}
{"text":"Wow, I was impressed. I'm a vegetarian, so of course, no beef burgers for me. But their veggie burger was impressive and \"big\". I kept the toppings simple: lettuce, tomato, onion and some guac. During my week in town, I actually visited a second time. I will definitely revisit the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"ZOMG.  What else can I say about Big Smoke Burger?  For starters, come hungry. And be ready for a flavor wave to assault your taste buds into submission.  The burgers? They're epic, and way bigger than the 6oz. of fresh Ontario AAA ground chuck would suggest. I tried the \"Big Smoke\" burger, and it was a meaty tsunami with horseradish mayo.  The fries are what you'd get if Five Guys and In-N-Out had an unholy lovechild and sprinkled on a bit of salt. They're good. REALLY good. A single order is enough to share with a partner, unless you have one of those stomachs with a spare compartment.  Two burgers, an order of fries and two drinks will drop you about $20, and it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Honestly, one of the best burgers I have ever had. Being from the South, I have had my fair share of great burgers, but Big Smoke was truly great. Went in with a friend on a Saturday night thinking we weren't too hungry. That all went away when we both inhaled our food. I wish I could have eaten another so I could have tried something else on the menu! I had the Blue, but I am going to say you can't go wrong with any of it. I was a little hesitant on how great the onion rings would be seeing they were pre made and frozen, but they were awesome! Great portion sizes too! (unless you want more like I did)"}
{"text":"Pretty cool decor as you enter; marble high top table and some nice wooden benches with exposed industrial air ducts.  I had a burger with goat cheese, not bad. They say it takes 8-10 minutes to make the burger fresh yet my patty was not scolding hot and it didn't taste fresh off the grill with braised crunchy outers and a soft juicy interior.  The fries were actual potatoes! A little heavy on the salt and a bit soft.  The redeeming factor was the amount they give you and the fact that they used yellow potatoes.  Service was courteous and prompt... Almost prompt, I went at lunch, they had one guy in the kitchen one guy on cash.  They were busy and he struggled to get things out fast.  It wasn't slow but it wasn't fast either.  You could also tell the guy in the front was working hard to keep things together.  Decent burger, over priced in my books and I wouldn't go back sans-coaxing"}
{"text":"Being the plain eater that I am, I just got a cheeseburger with cheddar cheese and spicy chipotle mayo. It was cooked with just a little pink, which made me happy as so often these \"fast casual\" burgers end up super well done. The bun was just a tiny bit overcooked, leaving it a bit hard. The poutine was sufficiently awesome. I'm a tourist, so I can't claim to be an expert, but I was very pleased with the generosity of cheese curds. Yummo! Quick, reasonably priced, and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food was tasty but...  17$ for a burger, fries, and a pop is ridiculous. Service was very slow, and the counter staff were overwhelmed and grumpy. I'm still hungry. I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"Yummy poutine, yummy burgers... Their old fashioned milkshake brought me to their yard! I love this place. They're not as consistent with the quality at this location as they are at the Yonge/Bloor location. Don't get the whole wheat bun unless you like the taste of post-consumer corrugated cardboard."}
{"text":"I love this place. Yummy burgers every time. Just don't get the whole wheat bun. And if you get the poutine for the love of God find someone to share it with because you'll regret it afterwards, even though you'll want to finish it all yourself. It'll leave you some room to try an old fashioned milkshake."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with Big Smoke. Always cooked fresh and use goo ingredients. For a chain joint, I find this to be a good spot. Would stop anytime and have one. Staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"So I crave this burger and go here once a week now...it is that good. One of THE best burgers in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came in today for the first time for lunch right at 12:30. Not busy, prompt service, food prepared quickly and brought to me at my table. Burger was REALLY good I only wish the patty had been just a little thicker - I had the big smoke burger. The fries were especially good, they were awesome, fresh, tasty and a decent serving size. The price tag at $15 for a combo I thought was a little high for this type of place but the quality really was good. They need better pop selection too Pepsi fountain drinks but no Mountain Dew and no Dr. Pepper (oh well). I will definitely be back to try more of the menu as I work nearby, but not too often at this price."}
{"text":"After wandering on Queen St. W I came here to meet my hubby & we had lunch. I tried the organic burger with fries & a side order of onion rings so we could share. The burger, fries, onion rings & a bottle of water came to $20.30. Pretty pricey if you ask me. But then again it was an organic burger. The food was decent. The burger was good but nothing special. I can buy organic burgers at the natural foods store that cost less & taste better. I liked the fries which were seasoned but it got quite salty towards the bottom of the bowl. The onion rings were ordinary. Not sure if I would get this food next time I'm in the neighbourhood. I've had better."}
{"text":"listen folks, i don't know how nicole b. writes that the burger is \"juicy and full of flavor.\" i got an unmitigated disaster. i should have canceled my call-in order when the person on the phone responded to my request for medium rare: \"we'll do it medium well.\" i then asked her if she couldn't do it medium rare and she said \"the health department gives us trouble when we do that.\"  bullshit. only if your cook is incompetent and has killed people. but then you fire the cook!  ok, i really should have given up on craft burger at that point. the rest is my own damn fault.  so, this is a craft burger place! and you only do it medium well? give me a break! that ain't craft. having good ground beef that you patty-ize daily is only half the battle -- you have to listen to your customers too!  but wait, it gets worse. we go to pickup our $40 order, and we forgot our coupon. the proprietor tells us she's really bummed. we tell her we'll tear it up when we get home, we're really really sorry. she capitulates but keeps pushing on the issue. give us a break, it's a coupon for a free fries!  anyway, we get home, dig into our burgers, and they are ok. but i'd expect better for a \"craft\" burger. there's certainly no juiciness -- how can there be when it's practically well-done. the fries and poutine are better than the burgers, but not stellar. and to top it all off, we go to shred the coupon and it turns out the coupon is the actual menu -- so she wants us to give away our coupon-menu to her so we don't discover it when we go through our take out menus again and hence never go there again? you got a business genius back there, craft burger. but maybe she knew we'd find it inferior.."}
{"text":"This place is better than your average burger place.  I had the crazy burger with onion rings when i went. The crazy burger was a little messy and wet, although this was expected when i ordered it judging by all the stuff that comes on it. I was expecting the burger to be spicy but really wasn't, although it was definitely good.  The onion rings were excellent. Large, crispy, and hot.   Not a lot of seating unless the upstairs is open.   I think I paid like $12 for a burger, onion rings, and a fountain soda. So a touch on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing food. The perfect equilibrium of quick and sit down. Vincent, our chaperone through our burger journey, was to die for. Great recommendations. Great service. Great charm. You love to see that. A must-stop in your \"Intro to Toronto\" course, so to speak."}
{"text":"A disappointing experience.  I ordered a burger combo. The burger was severely overcooked, to the point where it was not enjoyable. The toppings and bun were decent, though the topping selection was a bit on the plain side with a clear focus on upselling.  The fries were fairly good. Crispy and salty, though a bit thick for my taste.  I'm unlikely to go back, as the disrespect for beef was too great."}
{"text":"Stopped in late in the afternoon on Nov 7.... 3 people eating and I thought I would give it a try.... Went to the counter to order and asked if I can place my order here and was told yes...Ordered Swiss Melt and made it into a combo by adding fries and a bottle of water.... Paid and went to go sit .... Was told to take my a table top stand with #41 on it with me.... a few minutes later the server brought my burger and fries but no water....I had started eating and realized she wasnt coming with the water so walked to the counter and asked if she had forgotten and she said water is in the cooler and I can get it there next to where I placed the order... K... But I wish she had told me when I ordered to save the walk and obviously she wasn't going to bring it to the table... Burger was tasty but small, fries were below average, service very average..."}
{"text":"'Big Smoke' little 'Fire'! Tried the chicken grilled burger. Both the taste and the look were Avg-below avg. the chicken was a little dry. My take not to steer outside of Beef."}
{"text":"I LOVE burgers. Go on and judge me.   Big Smoke Burger is a great alternative to Hero's. I ordered its Big Blue burger combo with onion ring. It was delicious. You really can't go wrong with gorgonzola and burger - it makes your burger sound AND taste fancy.   I paid under $ 15 for a decent-size (un)healthy meal which is awesome. The ambiance is also better than other burger joints (not even talking about McDonald's).   Will I go back? Definitely!   Will I tell my family (and friends concerned about cholesterol)? Hell no.   Cheers to greasy onion ring!"}
{"text":"Big Smoke Burger purports to be a gourmet  burger chain. Maybe I've been spoiled but for $11.00, I expect more from a \"gourmet\" cheese and bacon burger than a grease bomb with two extremely skinny strips of bacon. The counter staff guy said yes, they did offer malt vinegar for their fries, but then admitted sheepishly that they only carried white vinegar. Sorry, not the same thing. Union Burger, my fave burger chain, offers a choice of malt, apple cider or white vinegar and their Great Canadian Burger with cheddar and peameal bacon is $7.99. Big Smoke's skin on french fries were piled on top of the two paper napkins that came with my meal. Guess what happened? The grease from the fries soaked through the paper bag they came in and two entire layers of napkins. The napkins were so saturated with grease all over that I had nothing to wipe myself with! This, Yelpers, is the least appetizing thing that has ever happened to me after ordering french fries. I couldn't eat them after that. They had quickly turned stone cold anyway. Well, at least the sodas (who in Toronto calls them \"sodas\"?) a.k.a. soft drinks came with free refills. Nothing tasted bad to be honest, but Big Smoke doesn't live up to its hype or its priceyness. And I could have a delicious grease free gourmet burger combo for less at Union Burger or from my go-to all Canadian fast food chain, Harvey's. It was all right, but for $11.00 you expect more."}
{"text":"Pretty good experience. I cam during $5 burger week for the special. the goat cheese and topping were great. the patty was fresh. I won't normally come when it's expensive, but even the lunch line during a special moved pretty quickly.  will come again if there's ever a good deal going on."}
{"text":"Tried their lamb burger. Pretty decent plating or a food court. Out of everything at the food court this is the best so far. Compared globally the burger is alright.  The fries were good too, just as good if not better than the booth beside them."}
{"text":"The service is pretty bad here. I'm super irritated that I ordered the fry-rings last time and they gave me like 3 onion rings when is says half fries half rings... When I came back another day I asked if they could actually do 1/2 & 1/2 and the girl said no and didn't even ask the kitchen. It's reasons like this that businesses don't survive"}
{"text":"Good, great poutine... Burger tastes like Burger King."}
{"text":"Stopped At square one after work and noticed  they were Doing renovations in the food court. Decided to try something new and walked over to big smoke burger. The menu had a wide range of topping combinations but I settled for a regular cheese burger and side poutine  to see if they could impress me with the basics. My combo came up to 12 dollars with a fountain ginger ale.    I must admit I was impressed. There were Actually char marks on my burger and I could taste the smokey flavour. The ingredients tastes fresh and paired together nicely. I actually found for once in my life there was more burger than bun. I didn't have high expectations for my poutine but it was delicious.  They use real cheese curds and it tasted like a beef base gravy. I will definitely be back to try one of their more gourmet burgers and a side poutpout"}
{"text":"11 am (probably closer to 12) on a Wednesday.  Walking in, there was one other person and he just came to get his food to go. By the time I left it was crowded...and I don't know why.  Customer Service: Great. You go to the register, you order, you pay, you pick up a number and a drink and you sit down. The cashier/waitress came around to give all the patrons napkins, I didn't really understand why because my food wasn't even on the table yet but um great.  Food: Sucks. You can ask for your burger medium-rare but there are no guarantees you will get it as such. I asked for and got mine medium-rare and it TASTED good but the texture was all wrong. It was dry, dry, dry and dry. The poutine? A salty mess. The fries were actually well fried and the cheese curds were squeaky but that disgusting gravy ruined it all.  The portions look small at first but I can tell you they will fill you up. Maybe I've been spoiled by the likes of Shake Shack (NYC) and Five Guys (US/CAN) but I know I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Their poutine is pretty good! Especially the mushroom one. Burger is ok. Their prices n the menu are not up-to-date. Most burgers are $8.50 (in the website, I think they claimed $7.49)."}
{"text":"Maybe I am just not a burger enthusiast, but to me I don't see the hype around this place. Yes the burgers are good, but from the lineups out the door and the way people talk about this place, you would think there was a second coming of Jesus. I have no problem with their burger, I find it quite good, but I don't find it much different than any other decent burger to deserve all the hype. The burger is 7-10 dollars depending on what burger you go with, but that is just for the burger. Any fries or other side is going to run you another few bucks. For me the taste does not justify the additional cost. I also got the onion rings and was disappointed in the amount that I got. Were they good? Yes. But when you get 3-5 rings I'm just not satisfied."}
{"text":"LOVED this place. It's small and simple, but when it comes to food, I've always been a fan of simple, high quality ingredients. There are enough burger choices on the menu to please anyone, and in my case, the simple cheeseburger with all the topings was all I needed. A friend got the onion ring combo, I ordered a side of poutine, and we split it all. Lots of food, and the price was pretty decent for what I'd consider to be gourmet comfort food. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for a good burger from a casual, cool joint. Seating is extermely limited, so perhaps be prepared to wait/take out. But we had no issue around 6 or 6:30 on a weeknight."}
{"text":"Nice staff/cashier (but don't-rush-me waiter/cooker)  8 to 10 minutes to get a warm beef burger but with cold bread... that is disappointing. Meat tasted good, for sure, but I had a very bad night thereafter.... (perhaps was it still the late effects of my ramen soup experience from the previous night at Sansotei?).  I may try this place again one day  (because beef tasted really good) and when I am (but not in too much of a hurry) in the district, before going to a movie."}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed with my bland and dry Crazy Burger from Big Smoke. The cashier was friendly, but the food came quite slow even though we're pretty much the only people there.  I think this is one of the worst burgers I've had in Toronto in a while, especially when they specialize in burgers."}
{"text":"Ordered the cheeseburger and thought it was pretty amazing.  I would give it 4.5 stars, if I could.  Yum yum yum.  The onion rings were pretty darn good as well. Would definitely go back and bring more people.  Not sure if they serve beer.  Next time I'll check.  Cheeseburger + Rickard white would be heaven for me! Blog TO was right once again!  However, it is a little pricy for the meal though."}
{"text":"The burgers are soooo juicy and delicous and so worth the money. I got the Craft Spicy Burger, but I wish i didnt asked for the spicy chipotle sauce because the burger was so delicious on its own. The onion rings are dangerous...you cannot eat just one.  My only complain for this place is the lack of seatings that are available."}
{"text":"OK ... being the burger Connoisseur that I am ... this is a pretty good burger.  I really like the fact that it is in my favourite hood of t-dot ... but just a pretty good burger.  I give it a 8/10 on the juicy scale, 5/10 on the presentation ... and I ordered Onion Rings ... which silly me I thought the plural implied many many onion rings ... but no, in this case you get about 6, all served on a cold steel rectangular plate with a quickly greased up sheet of wax paper. Don't let my vibe scare you off ... it is worth a try ... but not my Toronto best damned burger joint . . . the hunt continues."}
{"text":"Went there on Sat night for a quick bite. Was not busy at that time. Friendly stuff and the burger and poutine was surprisingly good! Totally recommend it if you are around and are looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for a burger this afternoon so I mosied on down to Craft Burger. Okay, enough with the western talk, this place is pretty decent. The space itself is cozy (read: small) and has exposed brick so they instantly get a star in my books. I had a hard time choosing between the the Blue Burger and the Red Burger. They both have gorgonzola (interesting choice for a burger cheese but I can dig it), lettuce, garlic mayo and one defining ingredient. Roasted red peppers beat the Blue Burger's avocado because that is just too much creaminess on one bun.  The burger patty could have been stellar, I wouldn't know because I was too bust ooh-ing and ahh-ing over the toppings. I don't think Licks can satisfy my burger needs after this."}
{"text":"Been here twice and really enjoyed it both times. They serve an organic beef burger from Beretta Farms, as well as Boylan drinks made with cane sugar. Not the best burger in the city or anything, but everything tastes good and very fresh. Tons of burger choices and different cheeses. Really great to have organic meats / more natural ingredients for a burger place in a mall food court. I'll be back whenever I'm at Yorkdale."}
{"text":"The combination of having read about this place in Toronto Life magazine, it being just in my neighbourhood, and burgers being my boyfriend's kryptonite, made coming to Craft Burger a matter or when, not if.  Having myself, half-heartedly given up beef a year+ ago, I usually order the lamb burger and it did not disappoint!  The juicy burger, sitting on top of the lightly charred bun, was happily presented to me on a thin metal tray with some onion rings keeping it company.  Flavour of the burger was delicious - my own personal preference would have been for the cilantro-feta spread to be thicker, but the flavour combination with the lamb was perfection.  Onion rings were light and done to perfection - couldn't keep my boyfriend's grubby hands off of them :)    My boyfriend loved his Classic Cheeseburger, but was aghast when he was told that making it a Classic Bacon Cheeseburger was not an option.  Sacrilege!  Nevertheless, he'll come back.  If my boyfriend's Craft Burger wish is for bacon, then mine is for some kind of seafood burger.  I'm fully aware the this is probably not possible due to the type of grill they use, but a girl can have her gastronomic dreams, no?  It's fully part of the experience, but you should know that space is tight!  Sitting down at one of the tables to eat is like trying to solve a japanese puzzle box.  Shift this table slightly to the left, shift this nice family of three to the right...  Don't let this deter you though!  Just come at a less busy time and enjoy the juicy burger goodness!"}
{"text":"Clearly one of the best tastyest burgers around. Not dry but a robust of moist juicy meat with the fixings. Love The Big Smoke burger smoky flavor with the carmalized onions and slab of smoked chedder! Will be back for more."}
{"text":"I've been in Canada a week and had three burgers at different places. Each burger was over cooked. This was one of the three places. Although I'm never asked, I always specify \"medium\"; cooked but pink in the center. I keep getting well; no pink. I don't know if this is just my luck or a Canadian thing. Regardless, the burger was pricey and just OK, really good bun, but just OK overall.  Everything is extra at this place. Do you want and organic patty? Do you want cheese? Etc. it's all about the upsell.   I had poutine with my burger and enjoyed it (fries with brown-gravy and cheese curds). This was my first go at poutine so I have no context for comparison.   This review may sound negative but my expatiations were exceeded considering this was 'food-court' food in a mall."}
{"text":"I will admit that I am somewhat of a burger snob, so I have very high expectations for burgers. Enter Craft Burger. The place is small but cozy. I placed my order for a Spicy Burger + fries and took a seat at the large bench style table. The food arrived quickly, and overall it was tasty. The burger was cooked well and the meat tasted fresh. The biggest problem was that the Spicy Burger was not very spicy. The fries were on the more well done side, which is not my thing. Overall, I would go back again but this would not be a regular stop for me because the food is not a great value."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot when they first opened, ordering the classic chicken burger. It's pretty good. Expensive for a burger ($9) but it was freshly made in front of you. Last time I was here, i had the most unprofessional service. I waited 30 minutes for a burger that they forgot about. When I kept asking where my burger was they kept saying it was next (but they just put the chicken on the grill. After 30 minute and about 5-7 people getting their food ahead of me I asked for my money back. I couldn't wait longer, and had to return to work. They literally threw my money back at me and whipped the burger in the trash. All done by the manager. I will NEVER be back here after this experience.  Maybe at another mall but not square one   Food 4/5 Management/Experience 0/5 Price 2/5  Update: was messaged on here by a rep but no one contacted me by my info I provided lol. Ok then."}
{"text":"The day I can here, it wasn't even busy. I stood behind the counter for some time while the cashier was texting away on her phone. Finally realizing I was there, she took my order. I ordered a lamb burger combo, a big smoke burger with no tomato and 2 drinks. 20 minutes later my order comes. But to my surprise I was charged 2 onion rings instead of 2 pop, which I had realized once I got home. OK, so I let it go. I then began to unwrap my burger and my bun is hard, as if it didn't fully thaw, which turned me off. My friend tells me his burger with the no tomatoes had tomatoes in it. So they got our orders totally wrong. Typically this place is decent but this was the worst order I've had from them and they weren't even busy. Can be hit or miss here but it's fairly convenient. You just might get overcharged or worst, a crappy burger. Ugh!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm too lazy to cook, and am in the mood for a large, comforting meal, I get the veggie Spicy Burger at Big Smoke (once also shamefully followed by a poutine at Poutini's...). Can't go wrong with the combination of chipotle mayo and caramelized onions...ever. The veggie patty itself is a \"meat imitation\", and isn't the moistest or tastiest faux burger patty I've ever had, but it fits the bill. Personally, I don't really care if my veggie burger tastes like real meat or not (as long as it doesn't taste like cardboard), but veggies who are looking for a true meat imitation may be disappointed.   There are about 8 different \"signature\" burgers on the menu, with most ranging between $7 - $8. You can also create your own burger with toppings like roasted red peppers, avocado, and sauteed mushrooms.   As others have mentioned, space is tiiggghhhtttt and seating is limited. Take-out seems to be a popular option here. However, dine-in service seems to be step above fast food -- last time I was here, the girl who took my order came around delivering burgers and distributing glasses of water and napkins to eat-in diners. Nice!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday to get a free burger, fries and drink. I haven't been to this location before but the staff were super friendly despite the crazy lines. They had a great system and pumped out burgers like crazy. The burger itself was great and juicy. I devoured mine before I remember to take a picture heh. Would definitely come back here when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Boutique is the word here.  The interior has an industrial sheik with local prints on the wall that you can buy for a mere $250.  The lighting above the cash desk is recycled high bay covers (warehouse lighting) with some paint on the inside.    The burgers are big (6 oz) and will run you $6 to $9.  I had the Craft Burger which was uber delish.  I'm really diggin' the garlic mayo they slathered on this beast.  For an extra $3.20 you can make it a combo with fries or onion rings and a can of Coke.  I was a little disappointed at the small portion of the onion rings but they were tasty.  For $10 it was well worth the money."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome burgers.  They are tasty and a great size. Really good french fries too!"}
{"text":"Had an amazingly simple blue burger at Big Smoke.  Blue cheese and avocado should be part of every burger experience.  The meat was cooked perfectly- medium well so charred exterior and dark pink interior. Lordie!   The best part- the bun! Warm and toasted, the way all buns should be.    I'll be back.   I RECOMMEND- any of the signature burgers really but you know where I stand   EXTRA TIP- Expect a small to modest sized sandwich at quite a cost (in my case, sandwich plus water? $11. No fries or sides). But money well spent."}
{"text":"3.5 if we're precise.  And since we're being honest, i've come to the sad realization that I take the Quest of TheGood Burger way too seriously. I have to stop reviewing these joints, especially since they never seem to really hit the spot.  I'll keep it short and simple. Need a burger option between shopping fits- drop down to Eaton Center's urban eatery and give Big Smoke a try. It's nothing out-of-this-world spectacular, but it puts its neighbour Mickey Dee's to shame... don't know if that's much of a bar though.   Have stuck to the Blue burger cause I can't seem to say no to gorgonzola (I literally can't turn down blue-cheese-anything), but try another one and share your experience.  I RECOMMEND: Eating AFTER shopping. Nothing like burger-bun-bloating to make you run out of any changing room screaming.  EXTRA TIP: Watch how your burger is being prepped. A quick hand will mean cold cheese atop a warm patty. Match made in hell."}
{"text":"My goal of trying all the non Franchised Burger continues...  Craft Burger for sure is A-OK on my list.  They really take their time to prepare their burgers even in a practically empty restaurant on a Sunday afternoon, it took over 10 minutes...  Love the charcoal marks on the meat, yes it has this nice rustic taste too. Love the idea of the patties are make with Ontario AAA beef... perfect eat locally ideology!  The meat is on a little bland and dry side but is is not bad. This is one of the place which I really enjoy the bun. Fluffy crest with load of seasame seeds. BTW maybe a Spicy Craft Burger may spice up the experience a little.  Definitely prefer sitting in the communal table in the middle of the store than those tables on the side with ugly plastic red chairs looking into the empty panelled wall..."}
{"text":"First time trying this burger place, and I thought it was good. Not extraordinary, but pretty good.   I had ordered a burger, fries and a drink. It was roughly $16+tax, so yes, it is a tad expensive, but to be honest, the burger was actually very filling in itself and had that flame grilled taste - delicious.   The burgers were dressed a little poorly and hastily in my opinion, and we even ate there (not take out). So that was a little disappointing.   I had the bacon cheddar burger. Was good, but definitely would NOT recommend going out of your way to get this burger.   I'd say it can be closely comparable to Harvey's."}
{"text":"Big Smoke Burgers in the Urban Eatery is one of 3 possible burger joints in there. It's competition is either McDonald's or A&W each holding a better location (both are near either escalators) while Big Smoke is smack dab in the middle. Which means they better have something good to bring out or it's gonna be in trouble.  So far I have tried a few burgers. Big Smoke Burger (horseradish mayo, caramelized onions, smoked cheddar, tomato & lettuce), Red Burger (gorgonzola, roasted red peppers, rosemary garlic mayo & lettuce and the Craft Burger (sautéed mushrooms, rosemary garlic mayo, lettuce & tomato) also I have tried both the onion rings and the fries.  Let's do my stereotypical break down.  The bread holds up to the dressings without becoming overly soggy. (Eat-in both times) The patty is actually firm this time around which was pretty interesting.  I don't mean it's hard to eat I mean just based on texture its firmer than your normal burgers.  Still a little juicy but it doesn't have a robust beefy flavour. Perhaps my dressings overshadowed it.  The dressings are you get what your order. Nothing particularly special. The rosemary garlic mayo was okay. The extra rosemary brought a different depth of flavour compared to your average garlic aioli.  The fries and onion rings were pretty good. Light and not very oily.  This place tries to niche itself as a gourmet burger joint relative to the other two big chance fast food joint so it is definately a lot slower in terms of churning out food.  However the food does stand a head above A&W and McDonalds but you shell out a couple of bucks more for it."}
{"text":"Big Smoke Burger used to be known as Craft Burger. It turns out they didn't officially own the rights to \"Craft Burger,\" and to play it safe they decided to change the name to a trademark they could secure. You'll note that nothing has really changed about the place but the title. Less a rebranding than a rechristening, I like the new moniker. It's definitely more \"Toronto\" and I am sick of seeing word 'craft' being thrown around anyway in the food world. (It makes me think of sparkles and glue sticks.)  Your standard burger is 6oz of freshly ground chuck, and it tastes like it too. These aren't frozen/refrozen patties. Their signature burgers are souped up with speciality toppings, and there are some pretty nifty options like the Crazy Burger: jalapeno Havarti, coleslaw, chipotle mayo, BBQ sauce, hot peppers. Crazy. Burger.   Combos include either fries or onion rings and a soda. Substituting a Boylan's makes the cheapest combo $10.30 before tax, so be careful. The pricing and the rather long wait-times (fast food this is not) are the only bummer about this place but hey, you can't rush quality. And these burgers definitely are.  Obligatory Title Pun: They're not blowing SMOKE.  Menu Readability: I really dig the graphic design here. That is all.  Need to mention: They make a mean veggie burger too.  What this place teaches me about myself: Sparkles and glue sticks? Maybe I'm the one with the problem."}
{"text":"Had a red burger. Delivered what it promised with a sting of garlic. Very saucy. Served on a trendy plate. A very verief menu. Happy enough."}
{"text":"Juicy burgers, variety of choices on the menu and reasonable prices! Great spot for a quick eat."}
{"text":"I've been to Big Smoke a couple of times now. The restaurant is super tiny with only four 2-person tables at the front. So if you plan on visiting, be prepared to take out. When they get busy during lunchtime, their cashiers get super efficient. One person takes orders down the line with a tablet and one person takes payment. I received my order before completing my payment. Needless to say, I was impressed.  The two burgers that I've had were the Big Smoke Burger and the Blue Burger. They were both very tasty, but the one thing that stands out in my mind about the burgers here is that they are very oily :(  Although the cooks were speedy at delivery, it comes at the cost of mistakes. On our last visit, one of my co-workers ordered the Blue Burger, but it didn't come with some of the ingredients listed on the menu. So if you're in the same situation, verify that you got what you ordered before leaving."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with coworkers and I love it.  I get the cheese burger, no bun, onions, mushrooms, and a side salad.  $15.  I've yet to try a milk shake but it sounds awesome.  I'm just not sure I want to be ill at work the rest of the day.    BONUS:  super clean amazing bathrooms in the basement!  Get the key on a huge spoon from the order taker lady, and proceed down down down down... into the cleanest basement I've ever seen.  Don't get me wrong, it def feels like rape city, but you're not there to hang out, just do your business and go!"}
{"text":"I work just down the road from Big Smoke and decided to try it out. Walking in I was not expecting it to be such a tight fit, but I was greeted right away and explained some of the menu items. After ordering and sitting down, I got my food within minutes. The burger was cooked perfectly and extremely juicy. Their onion rings were thick and the batter was fantastic. Even the costumer service is just amazing. We had a man come over to make sure our food was good, and if he could offer us anything else. Something I would never expect from a place that is not a table service restaurant. I would definitely try Big Smoke again."}
{"text":"First off, place looked pretty clean. Waited in line to order. The poor gal at the register was talking orders, making shakes and drinks, and delivering. Busy lady! We sat at the group seating area, a large marble slab with stools on both sides. I had to get napkins to wipe it off, as there was food dripped all over. They need one more person to clean up a bit. Otherwise, it was decent for the money. I still prefer The Works for burgers."}
{"text":"Went here just to say I tried it, since I'd never been to one before and this is a new location. I just had a hamburger. They are very cheap with the condiments, all I had was mustard and ketchup on my burger and there was barely any on it. Luckily I waited until I was home to eat and just added more to my liking. McDonald's puts more on their burgers than this place did, and that's saying something! I was not asked how I would like it cooked and that is probably why it was ' well done' . I normally like my burgers medium to medium-well and this burger had no pink whatsoever.  I did not get anything else during this visit because I knew I was going to eat at home.  Fries don't normally travel well.   I will go back again in the hopes that this was just an opening week glitch on the time they need to cook their burgers. Plus, I have to try their poutine at least once. :)"}
{"text":"Craft Burger is a restaurant  would highly recommend for all people, I just went there on April 21st and found out that this place has one of the best burger I have ever tasted in Toronto/York Region (that's if you are willing to spend over $10.00). When choosing off their menu a burger I highly recommend you get a burger off their \"Signature\" menu. But if you are not willing to spend that money and want a burger off their classic menu I suggest you go somewhere else for food because it is just a normal burger that you can bbq on your grill. If you do go to Craft Burger, I suggest people to purchase off their \"Signature\" menu which is filled with flavour and is satisfying. The downfall of this restaurant is that their French fries are oily. I believe that they should improve on their fries.  Thus, Craft Burger Signature burger was great particularly the Craft Burger that has sautéed mushrooms, rosemary garlic mayo, lettuce & tomato. The Classic burger was not satisfying; it was more disappointing because it was lacking flavour and was not juicy. Lastly the fries could be better."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot.  Better many of the other similar burger chains.  Good choice of burgers.  Had both the blue burger and just a regular cheeseburger on separate occasions.  Both times good service and the food tasted great."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burger spots that i visited in toronto. Although it is a bit pricy however after i tasted the food i realized that u get what u pay for.   I only tried the swiss sandwich, the meat was juice and it tasted like premium quality beef and the mushroom was deliciously smokey. Honestly i didnt feel so bad for the money i spent after eating the sandwich.   The location is good and there are enough parking spots to bring ur friends. Inside the restaurant is very clean and the decoration is nice to have a dine in.  The staff is friendly and the service is quicker than expected. Overall, i recommend this restaurant if u were looking for a tasty burger."}
{"text":"Brutal....smh....They are lucky to be in a food court at Eaton's Centre......They won't go out of business there but my burger wasn't very good.  They just threw the condiments on wherever....the bun was really bad, it was so dry.  Way too expensive to be below average."}
{"text":"Overall burger is pretty good. The Big classic burger is thick and juicy. But if you want something that's more filling, taste better, but less healthy, id go with a baconator."}
{"text":"I like this place, almost enough to be a fan. I was very happy with the burger. I will probably come and try out their specialty burgers.. like lamb and one with their sauteed mushrooms.  Like the chunky cheese in their poutine. It is not on their menu, but you can opt to get a small poutine for $2 less. The difference is the burger and poutine are on the same platter rather than the poutine filling a whole platter.  I was greedy and could not resist getting the large. I was super bloat walking out. Love their fries including their straight-cut also large proportion."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger joint in Toronto - the Craft Spicy is a personal favourite and their rings and fries are very, very tasty as well.  Their organic patty is also decent and they have fresh toppings with a good selection of cheeses.      But it's not without flaws; it's a little inconsistent depending on when you go and the service is unjustifiably long.  The burgers are made fresh, but it is a good 5 to 10 min wait.  For any burger enthusiast, you absolutely have to try it and it's the next best burger you can have (next to homemade).  PS - for fans of Craft Burger, if you are going to NYC you definitely need to check out Stand Burger.  The porcini mushroom burger is to die for."}
{"text":"Humongous? delicious? Did we eat at the same place?   I tried out Craft burger combo on Yonge today and was decidedly underwhelmed. Skinny, dry, tasteless beef patty that had the texture of cardboard. Where was the juice? Where was even a hint of beef taste or spice of any kind? The caramelized onions that I paid to add on based on other reviews here were lifeless, dimensionless, more like sugared spaghetti. Paper thin and super stringy, there was no onion snap among the sweetness. They were just mush.   The fries were good but the portion was pitifully small and the supposedly garlic herb mayo tasted suspiciously like the Loblaws \"squeeze it out of a bottle\" stuff that I buy for my take-to-work sandwiches.   If this is what the burger scene is actually like in Toronto, this TO newcomer is going to have to find a new food obsession."}
{"text":"I needed something quick for a sunday lunch while I was in the area of Yonge and Bloor.  I knew of a Craft Burger location that's just a little north of that area.  Now Craft Burgers have slowly been winning the average customer over, but it has also slowly been losing the burger lovers of this city.  The decor inside is a nice and simple with a large communal table in the middle of the shop.  It's clean and looks like your typical slightly upscale pub. During the lunch hours the crowds do pile in and the wait can be a little longer than usual. Yes, even on a sunday afternoon so prepare to give it around 15 mins from the second you walk in till when you receive your order.  I ordered the cheeseburger poutine combo. Yes, a heart attack just waiting to happen but that's what the gym is for right? *cough cough* I gotta pay them a visit realll soon. =(... *Awkward silence*... Sooooo I topped my burger with Lettuce, pickles, tomato, red onions, mayo, ketchup. And their patties are 6oz of fresh Ontario triple A ground chuck made fresh daily.  Sounds great and hey I'm a big supporter of local farmers. So all things looked good.  As expected, it took around 10 mins for my order to come after paying. While waiting they give you these little poles that you put on your table which has your order number.  I thought this was a little cute. My burger came and had to inhale that sucker quick due to time constraints. The burger was good. It was cooked medium with just a little pink inside. It retained moisture and it tasted fresh.  I'm also aware that at times, they do overcook their patties or the patties just come up dry. The poutine was alright. Nothing special but nothing bad about it. My only complaint would be with getting a poutine, the piece of paper on the tray gets soaked. And as your enjoying your meal, parts of the paper actually break off. So be careful as you're eating your poutine or you might just surpass your daily recommended intake of wood pulp. If I had to re-pick, I'll go for their onion rings instead.  Overall, I like Craft Burger.  It's not horribly expensive and I do like their burgers.  They may not have a huge selection if toppings like a couple of other burger joints, but they don't need it with their burgers (as long as they're not overcooked and dry). They keep it classy and tasty."}
{"text":"I've come here on two occasions with my wife and we both really enjoyed our meals each time.   It's a fast food joint but we appreciated that an employee came over to say hi and ask us how our meal was (the place was pretty quiet at the time).   What sets their burgers apart for us was the brioche bun. Soft and chewy, the bun was much better than the typical buns you get at places like South Street or Burger's Priest. The burgers here are also pretty good. I had a beef burger the first time and a lamb burger on my second visit. Both were juicy and had good meat flavour. My wife had a veggie patty on the \"Crazy\" burger and also enjoyed it.   Food was a little slower than average for a burger joint, 7-10 minutes but we were in no hurry. I'm not sure if this would be a problem during busier times as I visited during off peak times. The decor is quite comfortable and the overall atmosphere was nice, roomy and relaxed with a lovely smoky aroma from the grill.   I know the reviews here haven't been great but I have had great experiences and plan to make this a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"Lately I've been researching a project on the King-Spadina neighbourhood, so I thought \"When in Rome, eat at Craft Burger.\"  I rolled over to the burger joint and ordered myself a vegetarian Spicy Craft burger and a chocolate milkshake. For a simple meal weighing in over $13, I chalked it up as field work and sat down at a table.  I figured I'd continue working on my paper while I waited, and plugged in my computer only to find that there is no wifi. Oh well. I also found that the table was oddly low and the booth was too high. I'm not that tall and found the height difference bothersome, enough to write about it, and figure other people must have been uncomfortable sitting at those tables too.  As for my food, eh. What's the big deal? My veggie burger was a typical veggie patty, with that perfectly puck-like shape and concealed edges, and the onions and spicy mayo were OK. The lettuce and tomato weren't so great. The bun, however, was good, and for that I was thankful. The milkshake was good, too, and I'd recommend it.  Maybe it's because I am a vegetarian but I don't get why this place is so amazing; it's cramped and the food is so-so. They also couldn't pronounce my name (OK, I know some people have it a lot worse off than I do) and played a ton of rap music; I felt like I was clubbing while eating a burger."}
{"text":"It should be no surprise to anyone that I love to eat and after a long day of work, exhaustion kicks in and cooking no longer is an option there is Craft Burger.   I prefer to have take out only because it can get pretty crowded in here, and I'm not one to be crowded in a smaller space. However, if you do choose to stay and eat you'll find the decor pretty fitting. The dark slate walls with the dark woods and marble communal table, it all works and comes together.   The people who work here are super friendly and genuinely seem to like working here. Which is always a bonus because it reflects on their service and encourages people to come back again.   Not to mention the burgers are pretty fantastic. I like to keep it simple and just order a regular burger but there are not a lack of options for those of you who like to get fancy with your burgers. Like most other reviewers say their onion rings are great and so are their fries. A few people I know say their milkshakes are great too. I guess in the words of Kelis, they bring the boys to the yard. (sorry, had to say it and for those who don't get the reference, shame.)   I highly recommend Craft Burger and would just let you know that it takes about 10-15min for your order to be up so if you don't have time to wait you should keep that in mind or maybe call ahead and place your order. I actually don't know if they do that, but I'd like to think they do... just don't quote me on that."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I don't understand the negative reviews, maybe it was bad timing? But I LOVED the crazy burger. I brought my American friend and he had the Green burger, and was impressed about how good it was. SUPER friendly staff, they made sure I had every condiment (ketchup, napkins etc.) I didn't expect any service at all from a burger joint but it was an pleasant addition. I'll be coming back for the food and the exceptional service. I've never had such a nice experience at a burger joint before. I'd recommend the Crazy Burger combo (Onion rings and Boylan's Black Cherry Soda). Although it was a bit messy it was delicious, and I loved every single bite of it. I'll definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"The second best burger I've had in my life! Craft burger is very high quality, fresh ingredients. Fresh buns are a big key, along with interesting toppings -the Blue Cheese is stellar! Simple menu and simple, small interior. They really need to expand."}
{"text":"Obviously a popular place as it was still extremely busy at 2pm after the lunch rush. I order the Craft Blue. Gorgonzola, guacamole, garlic mayo, lettuce and a tomato. Firstly, I am a guacamole freak- absolutely obsessed. This guac...was made with under ripe avocados and there were hard avocado chunks in my burger. Now, I am not a burger snob, but I am an advocate of the medium rare. At Craft there was no choice as to how you would like your burger cooked...it was made well done. Not really my cup of \"beef\" if you will. I've grilled up better burgers in the comfort of my own backyard. The onion rings on the other hand - were ALLLL RIGHT!  Twelve dollars not entirely well spent."}
{"text":"Had the big smoke burger, pouting and onion rings Burger was delicious Good portioning on the pouting and onion rings Fast friendly staff"}
{"text":"After a few disappointing stops, the burger quest continued at Craft Burger. When we arrived, the queue was a bit long and no seats were available (there are a few stools along a counter and 5 or 6 small tables). I'd heard some positive reviews so we decided to wait. Ordering was quick and efficient! I had the Classic Cheese Burger with onion rings. The burger was super juicy and cooked perfectly. The smoked cheddar was a nice addition. The onion rings pass the test...that is the entire onion doesn't come out when you take a bite. However - portioning of the onion rings is inconsistent (my portion of onion rings was almost half the portion of someone else in my parties). I sampled the fries and they were fresh and hand-cut!   All-in-all the experience was tasty and I would recommend Craft Burger to anyone!"}
{"text":"I went  the Eaton Centre on a very busy friday at lunchtime so there was a bit of a wait for the food.  The burger was a bit sloppy and greasy and the bottom of the bun was mushy by the time i got back to my office but it still tasted great.  Medium well burger and dark fries."}
{"text":"I placed an order on the Ritual app for a veggie burger and due to the lunch hour rush they said it would take longer than expected. I told them I wanted to cancel it however it stated on the app that it is still being made, so I went. I went and the person making the burgers said it was cancelled but I showed them the app is still processing the payment. The guy said don't worry I will make it in 2 minutes and he did. Great service! I don't eat beef so I ordered the veggie burger and it was very tasteful. I think the best veggie burger I have tried. Tasty, great service. I just wish the extra toppings weren't so pricy :-(. Altogether, loved it!"}
{"text":"a really great place to get a burger, its fresh, healthy and comes with a lot of great toppings. the service is great as well, when I came here to eat a couple weeks ago, the cashier was super friendly and helpful with the order process. the only negative thing is that the parking for the mall is not fun to get in and out of. an awesome positive to this location is that it has pretty easy street/parking access as they have moved the food court from the south side to the north side.   lots of parking, as this is at a mall, but drivers here are nuts so keep your guard up.   transit options are the 15, 80, and 123(B,C,D) with some Mississauga options as well.   I'm a fan, but that parking lot is a huge deterrent for me."}
{"text":"having an allergy to beef, it's hard to eat at places like mcd's or bk, or even A&W as the alternative options are not delicious. this place has an amazing variety of options and personally i love a chance to eat Lamb whenever i can. the location is close to the subway which is great, great setting to eat in, and an amazing price for the quality product being served i would recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"Craft Burger is a takeout location. It is microscopic, and a couple of small tables will be occupied during the lunch hours, guaranteed. So don't drop in with a bunch of friends, queue of three will look like a crowd there inside.  Craft Burger is not a good ten-bucks lunch place either. Lots of little takeout locations around will give you more food for less money. Burgers themselves are normal size, but side is very small (and comes for a separate price).  Their burgers are not that bad, just don't expect anything gourmet-level. Any decent restaurant will serve you much better hamburgers for almost the same money. Craft' burgers are roughly on par with Burger King, and obviously better than McDonalds - simply because it's almost impossible to be worse. Well A&E maybe...  Also, there is no alcohol inside. Good to filter out all those potential drunkards when you are with kids. Not so good when you were thinking to enjoy a hefty burger with a pint of beer, and happily slap your tummy afterwards.  The only really good thing about this place is the people who work there. Young, professional and efficient. Unfortunately, they do not change the oil in those friture-machines frequently enough. But except for that, seem to be really cool folks.  Resuming: If you are passing by King and Bathurst with kids and feel like feeding them burgers right here, right now - Craft Burger may be not too bad a choice. Otherwise, no reason to check it out."}
{"text":"I was told to try the lamb burger here because according to my buddy it is unbelievably good. He was really hyping up the burger so I thought I would give it a go. It was ok. I wasn't blown away by any means.  The bun wasn't very fresh, and the lamb wasn't as juicy as I hoped.  The fries were also ok, but not any better than fries that you could get at McDonalds.  I thought the service was superb and so was the cherry coke I drank.  Those were the best parts of the whole Big Smoke experience.  I am still looking for a burger joint in Toronto that blows me away, so if you have any recommendations please let me know! Until then, the quest continues..."}
{"text":"This place is really good for a homemade style juicy burger.  All burgers are made after ordering so be ready to wait about 10 min for your order  wich is so wirth it.   I had my burger grilled medium and it had a smoky char to it and added lettuce, onion, bacon, pickle and a chipotle mayo that was perfect for this burger.   Tried both the fries and the onion rings and while not as superb as the burger they where also really good and i would rate it 4/5. Far from the normal fastfood fries/onion rings.   Service was good and with a smile and prices a little above the average McDonalds but really fair for the quality and freshness. Think i paid around 12 $ for a burger, fries, onion rings and a soda. Not bad!"}
{"text":"This particular Smoke Burger is located downstairs in the Eaton Centre's renovated environmentally friendly chic new designer food court aka Urban Eatery.   Big smoke's serves up an array of burgers including organic beef, lamb, chicken, veggie, and signature creations. Sides include fresh cut fries, onion rings, poutine, or mixed greens.  What I liked about this location which is the new concept in the Eaton Centre's new Urban Eatery food court is that they ask you if you would like your meal \"for here\" or \"to go\". \"To go\" they give you the standard fast food packaging or \"for here\" you receive your meal on plates with cutlerly on a tray. So naturally I opted to have it \"for here\".  I decided to get a combo and wanted to try one of there signature burger so I opted for the Spicy burger with a side of onion rings, and a Boylan's black cherry soda.  Toppings - They Spicy Burger - Caramelized onions, spicy chipotle mayo, tomato & lettuce. Overall not very spicy but a decent kick. You can ask for extra condiments on the side so I got mustard n ketchup.   Meat - Very fresh tasting but could of used a tad more seasoning. It was grilled to order, cooked perfectly, not dense at all and very moist!   Bun - It was a Toasted!! Love that! Good tasting bun with good meat to bun ratio!  Rings - Hot, crispy, and golden brown with a great crunch to it!   Drink -Boylan's Black Cherry Soda - Really good!! It's a must try and a good change from traditional pop.  Overall great meal, prompt service, fresh tasting delicious burger option!"}
{"text":"Lots of options. Burger was decent. Not the best I've had but I can make better. Fries were okay, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I was at Yorkdale today for work purposes and so when lunch came around, decided to check out the massive food court. I was drawn to Big Smoke because I remembered it was Burger Week and wanted to check out their special for the week... turns out it is a Green Goddess Burger - 6 oz patty with roasted red pepper, lettuce, cilantro dressing and goat cheese. My coworker and I both made it a combo to try their onion rings.   The burger is pretty delicious, I'm actually no fan of goat cheese so I scraped most of it off which my coworker proceeded to use as dip for the onion rings and proclaimed it to be supremely yummy. The goat cheese in addition to the green dressing makes the burger feel creamy and a bit heavy. The addition of the red peppers and lettuce really helps. The onion rings are really good and was a generous serving size. They're the breaded variety which may matter to some people but I love rings breaded or battered, they're all tasty!"}
{"text":"Joined up a dinner with a group of friends for dinner here tonight. I got the Spicy Burger with a veggie patty. The actual veggie patty was nothing special, just your regular soy patty. It was a good size though and filled me up for dinner. There was lettuce, tomato, spicy sauce, and what made it taste really good was the CARAMELIZED ONIONS..!! I also stole a handful of fries from a friend and they're on the small side and crispy so that gets a thumbs up from me.   The prices are reasonable for the burger you get. Get a Boylan's cream soda to round off your meal :)"}
