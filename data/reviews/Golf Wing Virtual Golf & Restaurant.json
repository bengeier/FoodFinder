{"text":"This is the best golf simulator place in Toronto hands down. They recently updated most of their machines and service it top notch. The owners know how to take care of their customers and their facility. Prices compared to other places are also great. Fair and competitive. Definitely recommend and will continue to keep going here."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and very friendly staff.  The technology is very updated and more realistic than most other virtual golf simulations that I have tried.  They also serve Korean food, fried chicken and beer.  The price per hour is reasonable and not charged per person. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Terrific spot, family-friendly, warm and encouraging atmosphere - Terry is an outstanding host. Our game has lots of room for improvement but we've seen remarkable progress thanks to this facility and the technology on offer. Simulator is v. accurate - virtually mirrors our performance on the course. Menu-wise we order the Bulgogi every time and we're never disappointed. Best of all, this has turned into a regular family excursion that everyone enjoys."}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly service.  Screens are large and wide.  Very clear in the private rooms.  Seems to be accurate.  Maybe half to full club off on yardage's but not a big deal.  Good variety of courses to choose from.   Just don't order any food.  Especially anything deep fried.  Awful would be a kind description.  The coffee is very good though.  Strong and hot."}
{"text":"Good spot for simple and fun indoor golf. The private room was really nice and seemed to have accurate sensors. They have auto tees which make it easy to continue play without reloading balls yourself. Nice add on. Prices were reasonable for Toronto and the owner and staff were really helpful and friendly making you feel at home. Had a great time getting in some practice there."}
{"text":"Great place! I especially appreciate it in the winter months for obvious reasons.   Space is clean and there are also private rooms available, which is a nice option.   The owner and all the staff are super friendly and attentive. The food is sooo good which is a big bonus! Authentic Korean - taste and quality is better than some Korean restaurants in the GTA.  I've been to other simulators where they just offer pizza or take out from nearby businesses, and charge a premium for it, but not here.    Definitely check this place out if you're looking to practice your golf swing or a bite to eat."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I've been here a few times now and every time I come the owner Terry has been extremely friendly and accommodating.  Todays my first time trying the food here and it was very good.  The best chicken wing around the area.  The skin was very crispy and the inside was still very juicy.  If they do keep this up it will be my favorite place for wings.    The golf equipment is very advanced.  The sensor seem very accurate and the platform moves to match the course.  If you're looking to play some golf definitely give this place a shot."}
