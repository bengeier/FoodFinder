{"text":"This is 5 star in LA and less than a 1 star in Phoenix. MidiCi in LA is EXCELLENT, wonderful atmosphere, really good pizza and food, people wait outside in lines to get in. Service is 100%.....SO YOU CAN IMAGINE MY DISAPPOiNTMENT WITH THIS DESERT RIDGE RESTAURANT...Pizza under cooked..no apology....service TERRIBLE....no apology...I tried this place 2 times, second time even more disappointing...cooks do not know how to cook, staff very inexperienced...I am not a demanding person and tried my hardest to be humble...but I am sorry the food and service is just not up to par...PS...I am not out to fire anyone, but please teach the employees to understand the menu, not make excuses, and teach the cooks to cook...I think everyone deserves a chance to improve, but please don't keep saying the same excuse that ....you just recently opened and things will improve."}
{"text":"My first time at Midici and I will be back. I had the midici house salad. It was enough for 3-4 people. Based on the price I thought it was for one person. Needless to say I had more salad than I could eat. I asked for dressing on the side. When they brought it out they gave me 3 different dressings to choose from. Nice touch. Had the traditional margherita pizza.  It was authentic Neapolitan Pizza. The crust was perfect. I wish I had tried something more interesting but the person I was sharing it with wasn't very adventurous. They were having some kitchen issues. The salad came out after the pizza. The table near us received the pizza, then the salad and then the appetizer."}
{"text":"Terrible staff and execution of cooking their pizzas. If you come in during the day the pizza is actually good. But god forbid when you come at night an order a pizza during actual dinner hours. A few weeks ago I ordered 3 pizzas, all undercooked/doughy. So they said they'd refund one pizza when I came again. Cool! Except when I came back and ordered another 3 pizzas: 1 so undercooked the pizza was pure dough and bending down at a 90 degree angle, 1 okay cooked pizza with strips of plastic glove in it, and lastly a pizza that was burnt like I eat my toast in the morning, along with virtually no sauce on it, and with more strips of plastic glove! I love eating the overcooked sweat of a 16 year old, NOT! I worked at the second best voted Pizzeria in the state, and they could push out twice the amount of pizzas with twice the quality, with only 2-3 workers and 1 oven! My boss there would throw away a pizza if it was even slightly overcooked or burnt because he refused to serve rushed and sloppy pizzas. Absolutely insulting that MidiCi can't distinguish the difference between working fast as a professional, and rushing like an amateur."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, I mean who can't love pizza? BUT every time, 4 times, we've been there my pizza has always been 20-35 mins longer than who I'm there with and EVERYTIME I ask they tell me it's not the cooking of the pizza but a shortage of people which is a lie. Today there were 5 tables with at least 8-10 people working,that's not a shortage of people. The least they could do is cook the shorter cooing pizza at the end of the other pizza so possibly if you're on a date one person doesn't eat cold food. I honestly never want to go back. They've been given enough chances."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, best new place in Desert Ridge Marketplace."}
{"text":"Such a cool new place to come!! Loved my pizza, came in only 5 minutes during my lunch visit!  So many fascinating elements of decor to absorb - the living olive tree, the black/white, silent movie on the wall, and the gold tiled ovens!  I can't wait to come back for dinner and try the Greek salad and Dessert!!"}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea. The pizza didn't have enough cheese and the crust was too flimsy for me. Price is reasonable though."}
{"text":"First time visitors today. Brought our whole family including four kids under 10. The interior is really nice. All the employees are nice. Thought it would be more expensive based on how it looks. Pizza and salad were really great, quality ingredients and taste."}
{"text":"Frist time and last time too!! Walk in there today wait for service for 15 minutes no one come to say hello or nothing very bad service the place was only 2 tables at 3:25pm."}
{"text":"Great service great pizza! I ordered Togo but the ambience of the restaurant was great! I am definitely looking forward to coming back and dining in! Thanks for the extra Nutella as well ;)"}
{"text":"We had a party of 11 on a Friday night. I was so pleasantly surprised how quickly our pizzas were ready. We had 6 different types of pizza and each was more delicious than the last!! The manager was so nice and treated us to the most decadent berry calzone dessert on the house. The service was great and we will def be back! So happy this awesome restaurant is in Desert Ridge now!"}
{"text":"This is a difficult concept to review; the food, the decor were fantastic.  The place is modern, clean, and the cooking area is visually very pleasing.  Midici gets 10/10 A+++ for this part of experience.  The set-up on how to order, how to receive food, and the teamwork of the staff were TERRIBLE !!  I give it a 1/10 F in that area.  It is hard to believe this is a proven chain.  

The food was excellent.  We ordered the cheeseboard and a Hawaiian pizza.  I was entertained throughout by watching the obvious \"new to Midici\" people entering and trying to figure out how to order and how things worked.  There were only about 5 groups in restaurant yet the staff was overwhelmed.  We went back to order a couple of scoops of \"to die for\" gellato and even though we were right there, our order sat for about 10 minutes until my normally docile wife couldn't take it anymore.  She barked out a complaint and a few minutes later we had the treat. 

Again, it is very hard to say bad things about this place....great food, clean, and clearly fresh ingredients....yet the delivery concept is so bad it boggles the mind that it is still in business or they haven't adopted a traditional server means of food delivery.  I am giving it a 4 as not to crush them with a 2 or 3, but be forewarned.....chaos, great food, chaos."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fancy, but not in any of the bad ways. It is beautiful. Also, everybody is really friendly. Even though the bathroom was spotless, an employee was outside waiting for me to finish to clean it again. They have really nice lighting and decor, even a live olive tree inside.

Also, the food was pretty good. It reminds me more of actual Italian pizza than the stuff we're used to in the US, so be prepared for that. I hope they open up more locations!"}
{"text":"The food is actually really good, the pizzas are great and the salads are delicious. The only reason I am leaving a 3 instead of a 5 is because I've been here probably 7 or 8 times and they can never seem to put the order together at the same time. 

I will ask them to bring my salad and pizza out at the same time and they always say they will, but never do. 

Tonight I got a to go order, was here when they said it would be ready and had to wait 20 more minutes because they forgot one of my pizzas. 

I would not come back, but their food is too good... so hopefully they can correct the human errors."}
{"text":"Just finished eating there with my family. We all loved it. My husband has proclaimed it his new pizza place. Ingredients are fresh, crust is thin and crispy, service is fantastic (they gave our kids raw pizza dough to play with), and their Nutella dessert is spectacular. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I really like MidiCi and feel that it really stands out taste and quality wise among it's speedy and customized pizza competitors.  MidiCi's crust is super flavorful and the texture really feels authentic and delicious.  You know it's good when you want to stick with a simple recipe the way you do at MidiCi - tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil.  They have other delicious options, but I go back to the classic.  They also have a condiment bar in which I highly recommend getting garlic and oil to dip your pizza in - yum!  

The only thing I feel is off with this place is the concept.  It's a little confusing because there's a self serve section where you go through a line and order or you can sit at the bar and be served (and get some wine!) but then you still need to get your own water and condiments.  Once you figure it out then it's totally fine, just odd at first."}
{"text":"What a DELIGHTFUL restaurant!! The manager/owner Luigi, is just wonderful.  And the FOOD.....oh my goodness!!!
If you don't order something that features their incredible bread, you will be missing out!!  
Love that they have both traditional and non-traditional pizzas to choose from and obviously VERY fresh ingredients.
the atmosphere is just lovely as well.
Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Great pizza-although you have to stand in line to order and walk through to pay and get drinks. Service was good and pretty quick. I would come back again and definitely reserve a high top table ahead of time. Family friendly."}
{"text":"Pizza was awesome and manager was great, walking around asking people about their experience.  If I lived around here I'd definitely come back regularly for the pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good!  They make the dough on site and were happy to accommodate a tree nut allergy.  
I haven't tried the salads yet but they looked great so do the deserts.   All three pizzas had just the right amount of toppings with equal dispersement of flavor.  
The reason for only 4 stars is because when I paid I inquired about getting some bread before our pizzas arrived. The cashier asked If I wanted a loaf or slices but then never had the bread deliverer.   It appears that they are over staffed and under trained.   It would be nice if they made more of an effort to be visible to all the traffic passing by too.  
Something that catches your attention!!  Torches on the patio... flag signs ... rooftop balloon ...corner sign twirler  something!! 
I will be back but hope to see more people eating here."}
{"text":"We tried this place yesterday. It has Great food, generous portions, a creative menu (of things you will definitely want to try), and a positive atmosphere.  It is pretty much everything a person could want in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Neapolitan pizza appears to be the latest rage in the Phoenix area and MidiCi's is a definite winner!
I've been there twice now, the first time a couple of week's ago following a movie at the AMC.  Ordered the \"Fisherman.\"  A wonderful treat, fresh anchovies placed on after baking.  No cheese but a delicious tomato sauce with capers, onions and more all on a delicately thin crust with a slightly burnt outer crust
Tonight my wife and I ordered two Margerita pizzas, one with Italian sausage and mine with anchovies (this time baked with the pizza unlike the Fisherman where they are added after baking.  The basic Margarita is only $7.50 plus a dollar for each added ingredient.  The total was under $20 for 2 11\" pizza's, a great deal for a terrific tasting pizza.  You've got to give MidiCi a try, it is that good."}
{"text":"so delicious! had the devils pizza and the Hawaiian pizza. both were amazing and will definitely be back. the service was great and the general manager was kind."}
{"text":"My new fav local spot! Amazing pizza and gelato. Staff was so kind to my family and the food was great! Even if you don't live in the Desert Ridge area, this is definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place.
First impression wasn't good. The establishment is very nice however the people that work here couldn't care less if you were here.
No one greeted us. No one smiles. They act like they don't want to be here.
They had two self serve Coke machines & were out of nearly everything in them.
The food was ok but overpriced for what you get.
I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"It was the worst pizza I have ever tasted. It was hard to even give it 1 star !

Who ever thought that this was a good idea needs to really take another look at themselves. It was just plain gross."}
{"text":"The pizza I had was so delicious! The environment was fun and everything was really nice. I had the house pesto pizza and it could do with some extra pine nuts but otherwise no complaints!"}
{"text":"Loveee this place!! Yummy pizza and really like the inside of it. Whimsical and beautiful!!"}
{"text":"We went here after my daughter's graduation from grad school. Each of us ordered our own 12inch pizza and when they got to our table, we all agreed we'd be taking some home. Four ordered the Margherita pizza, I ordered it minus the cheese, grandson had just cheese and pepperoni. The crust was thin, light and airy.. truly melt-in-your mouth! Not one of us had a left-over piece of pizza!! For dessert, we shared a signature nutella calzone which we nearly fought over! It was a wonderful meal and I totally recommend it!!"}
{"text":"The food gets 4 stars. The inattentive staff that mix orders or do not make the pizza as requested should do something else.  We love their pizzas when made right. A couple of times in the past two months, at least one ingredient was left out on my pizza. Last night I called to order a chicken pesto. They were out of pesto sauce, I ordered truffle and prosciutto. I asked a friend to pick up the pizza on her way over. What we got was a totally different pizza. Looked like a bowl of arugula dumped over a crust. Come on folks. You have good pizza recipe, get the orders right."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious, prices are fair, decor is beautiful, staff is friendly. 
Midici is close to work for me so I popped in for a quick bite at lunch. The menu has both a \"create your own\" concept and a comprehensive menu of specialty pizzas. Order at the counter and your pizza is brought to your table. There is also a \"seasonings bar\" (not sure if that's what you'd call it) that has fresh garlic, sea salt, olive oil, oregeno, etc. for additional topping/flavoring of your meal. 
I ordered the Meats pizza and only finished half. Ate the other half for lunch today. Reheated well!"}
{"text":"This has got to be my favorite pizza place of all time. Super fresh, super fast. The staff is always friendly and ready to help.

Two beautiful pizza ovens pump out a consistent product that is thin and delicious with just the right amount of chew.

I love the slab of prosciutto that sits atop the beautiful, red slicer that is manually operated. It just seems to taste better coming off of that slicer.

The burrata appetizer with melon and prosciutto is light and fresh and the burrata (mozzarella) actually has some flavor unlike mozzarella I have had at other establishments. 

Meat board, cheese board, meatballs and salads. I've yet to try a menu item that I didn't devour! 

Lastly I will say my meal at MidiCi is never complete without an affogato. MidiCi calls it a Drowning Gelato. A scoop of vanilla bean gelato with espresso over the top. If you haven't, you must!"}
{"text":"Our first time eating at Midici tonight and we were very pleased. The atmosphere is so inviting and relaxed but with the heavy silverware, plates, and glasses, you would swear you were in an upscale restaurant. The pizza was delicious, very filling, nice chewy crust and you can definitely notice the the \"fresh\" ingredients. Loved my Chicken Pesto pizza! The Italian salad was huge, full of veggies and something easily to be shared or eaten as a meal on its own. You have to try the pistachio gelato (if you have any room left in your stomach), it has just enough flavor but isn't overwhelming and the perfect ending to a great meal. We will be back!!! Thank you."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night. Not too busy which was surprising since it's a super cute place. My pizza was ok, I got the white pizza, could have used more basil. A little disappointed that our appetizer and pizzas all came out at the same time. We had no room on the table and pizzas got cold while we tried to quickly eat our appetizer. We will give this place another try and see if there is more attention to the timing of food delivery, I hope so."}
{"text":"First time here. Food was excellent. Fresh ingredients, clean atmosphere, friendly staff. We had the Double Pepperoni (calabrese), spicy sausage pizza, and the Midici House salad. Very light, yet portion size was big. Will come back!!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza I have ever tasted! The salad was awesome too. The gelato was unbelievable. I love pizza, especially brick oven. It was well worth the price. They only use good ingredients and it shows. This place is a must try. Absolutely in Love!"}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place !!! Interior is so pretty, it's modern and bright. Love the bathroom decors too !! The pizza tastes authentic like I'm having lunch or dinner somewhere in Italy. We will be going back for sure !!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Pizza, great flavor and excellent atmosphere. Went here with my parents from out of town and we were happily surprised to find this spot. Tyler did an excellent job servicing our needs on a Wednesday night. We will definitely be back for more of our pizza needs."}
{"text":"Took my parents here for Father's Day and had such a nice time! Very nice environment and the food was great! Luigi, the manager, was an absolute delight and the other people working there were super nice and attentive. 

We ordered the cheese plate, garlic bread, kale salad and margarita pizza. Everything was delicious and really fresh, and my parents, who are very picky about their pizza since they're from NY and Italian, were impressed with the pizza. Crust and sauce were both very good. They also have a decent wine and beer selection, including Peroni on tap. 

Overall, a very nice, casual restaurant with great food and good prices. Looking forward to trying out their happy hour soon!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza we have eaten in Phoenix.  They had a delicious gluten free crust, too.  We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Been waiting for this restaurant to open for a long time. Always drive past it when I'm refueling my trunk with several St Pauli Girl Beer twelve packs from TW&M across the parking lot. Plus it is only a couple miles from our house. Yes!

Came in here after getting a Grand Opening coupon in the mail. They were giving out FREE Margherita Pizzas this weekend and decided ... me want PIZZA!

Inside is interestingly modern with an open kitchen and a large amount of fresh ingredients that you can both see and smell while standing in line. The place is in the shape of a circle with the seating area off to the side.

Ordered a Margherita Pizza and a Spicy Devil's Pizza for me. I was attempting to eat them both but ended up bringing home my leftovers for my wife who decided not to go. They were both very good and I really enjoyed the fresh ingredients. The double OO flour that they use really makes the difference.

Their menu has so many different options on it with several types of delicious and fun Appetizers as well as ten or more different types of Salads. They also have yummy Desserts and Gourmet Coffees.

Really enjoyed the Pizzas and will definitely be coming back again. Prices are very reasonable and everyone eating there was both happy and excited. Would like to bring the Grandkids and have them check it out. The place was full of kids when I was there and they were all chowing down.

Service was super friendly and they did a great job at tackling the large surge of customers on this special grand opening weekend. Hoping they open up the vacant adjacent room next door to add more tables and gaining more space to move around. The current seating arrangement is not very practical and I had to move a couple of times due to my table rocking back and forth or leaves falling from the live tree inside. Wait ... What?!

See ya there next time around eleven for lunch. It will be on a weekend of course. As much as I cannot stand trying to navigate that dreadful parking lot ... I'll be back once again for some delicious Pizza. MAMA MIA!

{"text":"Excellent food, great service. The owner and manger are so friendly. We highly recommend MidiCi! We love this place!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Phoenix with girlfriends and we were craving some \"fancy\" pizza as I like to reference anything non Round Table-ish.  I found MidiCi and we headed over - I hadn't realized prior that it was a go up and order restaurant which didn't change anything but I had thought from photos it looked like a sit down restaurant with waiters.  Service was great regardless - I ordered the truffle proscuitto pizza and I have to say I wasn't over joyed with it.  It was just okay.  I didn't get a chance to try the other pizzas we ordered but I thought it could have used alittle more truffle for me personally. 

The burratta appetizer was DELISH so yummy! Then we finished it off with the Yelp coupon for buy 2 pizzas get a free nutella dessert - that thing was crazy! So delish - but get some gelato to go with it as I think that's would have really thrown it over the top!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try MidiCi since they opened last summer and finally got a chance this afternoon. We had the Margherita  and the chicken pesto pizzas. The ingredients were fresh, mostly non-GMO and very flavorful, this is the real deal for Neapolitan pizza. The ambiance was what I would call casual chic with a European flair, the staff friendly and the prices very reasonable. Though I don't think anyone would consider pizza health food, MidiCi's corporate culture seems to promote the use of ingredients untainted by GMOs and the commoditization of our modern food supply. The attention to detail, from the authentic wood burning ovens to the Vittoria mechanical meat slicer that bears a greater resemblance to a fine Swiss watch than the typical supermarket meat slicer resulted in a uniquely authentic, handcrafted experience unmatched among corporate restaurateurs. 

A nice surprise is that they sell 1 Kg bags of Antimo Caputo 00 chef's flour for substantially less than you can buy it on Amazon as well as Italian peeled tomatoes and Olive Oil. These are the same ingredients they use in their pizza as well as the ingredients called for in the very specific Pizza Napoletana Specification. I'm not sure about the provenance of the mozzarella they use but it was quite delicious. 

All in all I was impressed by not just the food but the thinking behind the business. Like I said, not health food by any means but there is a fundamental concern for the quality, healthfulness and environmental impact of their choices in today's ever more challenging agribusiness culture and the prioritization of profits over people. It was not just a great lunch but a great experience. Very impressed!"}
{"text":"Thank you for the free pizza during your Grand Opening Weekend! The Margherita Pizza was excellent. My dad's side is Italian and I've been to Italy many times, so I hold pizza to a high standard. The imported beers on draft were under $5, which is great. Can't wait to come back and try more menu items! 

Side note, the Yelp map is wrong. This restaurant is behind the Target by Chipotle and Verizon.....not in the mall area."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service kind of chaotic, wish you could just pick your own table instead of being assigned. Also music is way too loud. Otherwise, everything was delicious! May just order to go next time."}
{"text":"The decor in this pizza place is wonderful and what initially grabbed my attention but the pizza itself is amazing! It is very fast and it is all freshly made right in front of you. They serve beer and wine there as well. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The pizza crust just felt tired this afternoon. Every single piece of this 12 inch pizza struggled to support the ingredients, which weren't many. Our leftover piece pictured. This was our first visit, and we will try again. Atmosphere is nice and this location is close to home"}
{"text":"It ok...you order and they deliver to the table.   Pizza ok.. I did not find it so good that I would come back.

Humble pie has better pizza, salad, and TV's to watch sports....."}
{"text":"I first saw the advertisement on Facebook with their grand opening promotion of free pizza during the days of August 11, 12th and 13th. So we went and I was very impressed at the level of service we received there. So much so that we went all three days. Pizza's were free and toppings were $1 each.
On our third visit we received a complimentary dessert calzone and that just made the event even better. 
I would recommend Medici's to those who want a nice dining experience, The owner, Alan Gardener, really showed his ability as to running a fine establishment . Thank you for everything, we will be back again soon.

{"text":"Ordering different items and sharing is always fun when you dine out with a group of friends; everyone gets to sample more dishes from the restaurant. This is what my friends and I did when we tried out MidiCi. Salad and a meat board provided a delightful opening to the meal.  All the pizzas we tried were excellent - the toppings were delectable and the thin crusts had a nice char and a good chew. Note that the double pepperoni has more spicy kick to it than you might expect, which is just fine with me.  And the margherita covered with prosciutto is really delicious - this pretty much compels me to make a return visit. Ordering is very straightforward, done around the circular counter where you get to see and choose the topping ingredients. The prices are really good, considering the quality of the food as well ad the great service and the pleasant atmosphere of this pizza restaurant."}
{"text":"We've been here three times now, including our first experience on opening day weekend, when we received our pizzas for free. Sweet deal, if you were willing to wait in line, which we did. The other two times, the wait wasn't bad, but it does seem like they move a bit slowly even with a whole lot of help behind the counter. This will probably get better with time as the employees get the hang of things a bit more.

The good:  The pizza here is well worth the price. Seriously, it is comparable to sit-down Neapolitan pizza places that charge much more for a pie. The sauce is so fresh tasting, and the toppings are high quality. The crust is just what you want in a good Neapolitan pizza. The owners apparently wanted to bring this type of pizza to more people at an affordable price, and I would say they have succeeded. Also nice are the free condiments that include more than just shaker cheese and pepper flakes. They offer parmesan, of course, but it is super fresh as opposed to the kind that come in little pre-processed packets. They also offer oregano and fresh basil...yes, that's right, fresh basil, which other places charge a premium for. We have also tried the house salad, and it is excellent--and enough for two. The patio outside isn't open yet because they are waiting on a permit, but once it is open, it should be nice to sit outside once the weather gets cool enough.

The not-so-good:  I mentioned the somewhat clunky (though friendly) service, but again, that will likely improve. If you like sauce, ask for extra. The normal amount is a bit lean. Also, one of the pizzas we received had such thin crust in the middle that it was really TOO thin--like as thin as a piece of notebook paper...maybe. And then, what is it about so many restaurants nowadays that feel they have to play loud, pumping dance music in order to create \"energy\"? You kind of feel like you're spending a night at the Roxbury here. If they really must do it, I wish they would turn it down by about 50 percent. It's nice to be able to engage in conversation and still be able to hear the person sitting across from you without having to try to read their lips at the same time. The only other thing to note is that the internal lay-out is a bit hard to maneuver. Tables are at angles that are a bit awkward, making it difficult at times to get by certain tables. Not a big deal, just a bit inconvenient, mainly due to the rotunda shape of the room.

The verdict:  The positives definitely outweigh the negatives, and we plan to keep coming back for some pretty outstanding pizza for the price. We're looking forward to a bit quieter time on the patio once it's open. :o)"}
{"text":"Don't miss out on a great dining experience at Midici!
You order your pizza as you walk in, and they have gluten free options, Yay! We received our food in a timely manner, even though the restaurant was busy. 
There were four of us in our party and we all ordered our own pizzas.  We had a lot left over, but left feeling full. 
Not only were the pizzas delicious, but we had the meatball appetizer as well. The meatballs were cooked perfectly.  The sauce is good, not too sweet. 
For dessert, you must try the Nutella calzone!  Wow! 
Rich, decadent, delicious. 
The service was amazing. They checked on us several times.  They were friendly and helpful, but not overbearing. 
The restaurant was very clean and we loved the big gold pizza ovens! 
Almost forget, best of all the prices are very reasonable!
My new favorite Phoenix restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza!!! The ingredients are very tasty good quality and fresh. The crust is to die for. They even have options for my vegan friends. Love the ambiance and the patio.
Staff is very friendly. This is my new spot for when Suzi want pizza."}
{"text":"I like this place.  It is a little fancier than the other made to order pizza places.  The decor is simple but elegant.  I love the olive oil canisters they have by the entrance, I definitely need to get me one for my kitchen.  I have been there three times so far and I have enjoyed it every time.  I always order the margarita, although last time I had them add ricotta cheese.  The crust is crispy enough but still has a nice chewiness.  I also had one of the salads and it was very good.  My kids love the soda dispenser and start mixing flavors.  I might have to come again this week."}
{"text":"Fuego food. Cool people working there. 10/10 I love it I'd eat all my meals there if I could. Love it"}
{"text":"Great service and pizza. The house salad is perfect. Nutella dessert delicious.  The whole family loved it."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite fast casual concept restaraunt! Not only is the food quality and super tasty, the place it self is very cute, clean, and modern. And they do way more than your typical grab and go pizza and salad joints. They offer tons of cheese boards, Prosciutto wrapped Mellon, and Wood-Fire Baked Truffle Cheese Bread along with a decently priced selections of wines and beers. Oh and don't forget dessert like their very popular Signature Nutella Calzone With Fresh Berries. Everything I've tried here has been super fresh you can tell that they use quality ingredients just like they promise. Natural, high quality, and non-GMO. 

Come here for all your Neapolitan Pizza cravings and you wont leave disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant.  Food is phenomenal  (get the Nutella calzone!) And customer service is on point! Luigi is such a great guy, always making sure everyone is happy. Can't ask for a better experience."}
{"text":"One bite, everybody knows the rules. Looks like a fancier pizza. Your guy at the front hooks you up and you pay at the next register. Came out pretty quick. Paired nicely with a glass of Peroni. One bite everybody knows the rules. Crisp isn't too bad. Not the best crisp I've had but it's up there. Fresh milky mutz is A1. Crust was a little burnt to my liking. I give this piece a 7.1"}
{"text":"The folks were super friendly and there was nothing assembly-line or fast food about this pizza, they really care about how you want your pizza and strive to make it perfect.  I ordered the chicken pesto pizza and it was really good!  Fresh mozzarella, nice chewy crust and yummy pesto.  Friend and I split the pizza and a nice salad sitting on a comfortable sofa on the outdoor patio.  So great pizza and great atmosphere.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I loved this place when it first opened. But the consistency of the food is very hit or miss here. Sometimes your pizza straight up won't have any cheese on it and barely any toppings, and other times it'll be covered in toppings and dripping in cheese.

When things are going well, this place is great, but I've been burned one too many times for me to return for pizza, I would on the other hand return for their kale salad and burrata.The burrata is the best burrata in the metro area for sure - they got that one right every single time. Skip the proscuitto here, its so cut so thick that it doesn't even taste like proscuitto anymore.

Staff are ok, not great (seemingly always untrained), and the process of picking up take out is irritating."}
{"text":"Gorgeous ambiance, great location, good pizza, useless service concept. So many employees standing around doing nothing because you have to do everything on your own. Get your own menu order in line get your own plates forks cups and drinks. They only bring the pizza. Our tables and chairs were sticky along with menus.  No manager on floor. All high school kids running this beautiful trendy place. I don't predict it will last long. This place would be happening and so busy if they actually sat people down and had normal waitress servicing.  When you order and pay there's a line item for tip so I tipped the norm 15 percent not knowing that I would end up servicing myself for everything except bringing the food.  We were shocked to walk in and it was dead on Friday night because it really is a great place and location and we really enjoyed the pizza but everything else was one star."}
{"text":"When I asked my better half, how many Stars she would have given our dinner at MidiCi Neapolitan; without hesitation, she said Five. 

Mind you, I've always had a number in the back of my mind, but I wanted to see if I was off base. But tonight, Wow! She has never offered that many Stars to any restaurant before, so this place must be good, huh?  In a word, yes. It is. 

MidiCi Neapolitan has clean lines, it is bright and welcoming, the food is interestingly prepared and served, in a way that makes you want to come back.  There is eye candy all over. They even have an old B & W film being projected on the wall. Wow. Lots of stuff going on. 

I could spent a paragraph just discussing the condiments bars. But I digress, because the real star here is the food.  Like da'h ! It's the only reason we go out to eat anyway, right?  Yep.  You can make this at home, well most of us can AT LEAST try, right?  LOL.  

But here, the food is great and it is priced right.  Looking over the menu, we thought maybe the prices were wrong. But, no!  A House Salad is just $7.00. A House Meat Board (see photos) is only $9.50. And, their Neapolitan House Margherita, is incredibly only $7.50 and larger & better tasting than either Fired Pies, MOD or Pieology. Did I mentioned, it's better tasting?

We started off with two glasses of Pinot Noir. The wine had a nice body, slightly fruity, with no alcohol bite. It was nine dollars a glass. 

We then ordered the afore mentioned Meat Board and Chopped Salad ($10.50) to share. Now, at MidiCi you order as you come in, cafeteria style and pay at the end of the circular display case. Btw, Yelp is offering a Free Margherita pizza tie-in with their recent Grand Open (see photo).

Next up was our pizzas, Margherita and Meat Lovers, or le Carni ($10.50). No, we didn't finish them. We each had three slices and asked for a take out box.  Actually, we asked for two boxes for the Salad and Meat Board as well. Just too much food.

Our bill came to $50.50 before gratuities, but including taxes and our Yelp discount. I've included photos of the food and a short video of the inside. 

We really enjoyed this new addition to the Desert Ridge shopping area and we will be back. You should, too. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My second time at MidiCi and their service is SO slow. Called my order ahead, and arrived 25 minutes later to my pizzas still not made. There are 7 people visibly working and only five other customers in the building. Their pizza is delicious, however until they find their groove I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend ! Good Neapolitan pizza! Great service! Visiting the area and met some locals here :-)
Happy with our choice"}
{"text":"Just tried MidiCi for the first time and was really impressed, it's now my favorite place for pizza in Phoenix. Had both the Neapolitan Margherita and Pesto pizzas, and both were excellent, especially the Margherita. Nicely decorated interior and nice plates, too."}
{"text":"The best lunch special value. The house salad is absolutely amazing! For $10 and change your get a drink, personal two topping pizza and a salad."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere. It is beautifully designed and decorated on point. The pizza is so fresh and delicious. You have such a huge variety of toppings to pick from. The staff/service is great too. The owner even came up and introduced herself to us and asked how we were and checked on our food. Took my whole family here. Really happy with this service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I definitely enjoyed the atmosphere and the decorations of the place. My husband likes the appetizers more than the pizza, but I liked both except that the meatballs are too salty for me. Besides that it's a good place for a quick Sunday lunch. I may try their desserts next time!"}
{"text":"I almost do not want to leave this review so I can keep this place to myself! Upscale food and ambiance at counter service prices. Good wine list, by the bottle or glass. I had the buratta, prescutto , and melon plate, it was so good that I barely touched my salad, but it was good, too."}
{"text":"First time.....order was done in error but Manager Michael made up for mishap. Thank you! Food quality and taste is outstanding in freshness and absolutely delicious! Love the House board of cheese and meats for two. Reminds me of Sonoma Wine visit.  Hip atmosphere.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food was great salad pizza and atmosphere was super nice. Owners working very hard to keep it awesome. Bathrooms are amazing. Its like a spa world. The high ceilings make it open and airy. Will be back."}
{"text":"There's a new pizza boss in town... Or at least potentially... Maybe.... If only they can adjust a few things they can make it happen. Desert Ridge was craving an ambiance like this, a patio like this, a menu like this, so let's hope they do. In a world of Blaze, Fired Pie, & 1000 Degrees their pizzas are not measuring up. A good pizza should arrive to the table with melting amazing cheese, and this one... It's not. In fact, the cheese was barely there. The pizza looks great, but a bit more hot cheese can keep people coming back. Also, I can recognize good service, and I can say this was ok, but it did feel a bit rookie. I got the egg and bacon pizza. Not my fave. But I'm willing to come back to find the one. Their menu looks pretty cool. They got a few things going on for them, including the bling bling oven. A live tree in the midst of the room and their food presentation, So I'm rooting for them."}
{"text":"The first time I went was on an Elite group invite, it was awesome! Today was odd, arrived after my doc appt around noon. Surprised to see it empty and just a couple arriving after me. Saw the chef from the elite& no smile or a hello, looked angry sitting working on something on paper. The 2 young ladies were sweet but no personality, I'm sorry. As I received my pizza an older employee rush in. I got up to ask if they had ranch dressing, she gave me a look like I asked her for her purse! I'm old school & like dipping my crust in it... so no ranch dressing... I did love the Pesto Pizza but the vibe has turned me off, sad."}
{"text":"What a great find! Pizza was superb! High-end ingredients, great atmosphere, and great service! We ordered pizza and the Italian salad, which was also fantastic. I highly recommend this place! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very happy with our visit. Food was good- gelato was good - cappuccino was good.
Pizza was good- will try other kinds soon-we played it safe with a double pepperoni.  The gelato - hazelnut and lemon sorbet.

  I ordered 2 cappuccino's- she only made 1 and it was ok. When I went to reorder the 2nd one once we realized she only rang one up-the 2nd cappuccino was great. I think it has to do with how long the shots sat before they were poured.  The 2nd one was really good. 

So I think once they get in the swing of things it will be really good. 
Now I might be a bit bias due to just getting back from Vience- but it was good. Happy it's close to home. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"3 stars bc Phoenix has other exceptional pizza places(piazza,bianco).  Location is great near resorts and its a quick way to feed the family.  There are so many people working behind clear glass that they dont bother to great or help on how to order.  We ordered 3 different pizzas and they were made poorly.  Although salad looked large it was mainly greens and lacked substance.  Overall I would not come again but it was near our resort and easy for kids."}
{"text":"Shopping in Desert Ridge and noticed this new place. Pizza and wine bar - right up my alley. You order at the counter and they bring you your food to the table. They have a nice pizza \"condiment\" bar with freshly grated mozzarella, crushed garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes and black pepper. 

I ordered the prisoner pizza which is basically a margarita pizza with ricotta folded into the crust. It was delightful. My only complaint is that some of the slices didn't actually have ricotta. But the crust itself was divine. 

Hubby ordered the Meats. I can't recall which meats it had on it but it was very good as well 

They were playing old balaclava and white movies via a projector on one wall. The pizza ovens were super cool. I would definitely go back for the pizza and would try the salads too (they looked go"}
{"text":"I suggest the double pepperoni or house meatballs. Walnut Gorgonzola salad is amazing!"}
{"text":"I saw this place featured on a morning news broadcast.... and it took me a few MONTHS to actually make it inside! I AM HOOKED!! Meatballs were amazing! Pizza.... the best I've had in Az! Crust is thin and soooo fresh! They have a fresh condiments bar that is original in design! And inexpensive for the quality! I am planning on coming back to try the salad and deserts next time!!  Couldn't be happier!"}
{"text":"MidiCi Pizza is a fast casual authentic style pizza concept. They specialize in light Neapolitan Style Pizzas using only 4 ingredients for the crust that include non-gmo Neapolitan double zero flour, water, sea salt and yeast. They offer a menu of suggested pizzas, about 38 optional pizza add ons, (that mostly run $1@) appetizers and burrata, salads, desserts, coffee, teas beer and wine. The atmosphere is inviting. It's very light and airy and interesting with a circular design.  They have a small living tree in the middle of the dining area. 

Seating is very close together....

You start off the way you do at any fast casual place and order at the counter, pick up a table number, pay and then, get your beverage, plates and stuff, maybe hit the pizza condiment bar that includes fresh basil and hot chili oil and then seat yourself. Someone runs your food to you.

They were giving everyone free Margherita pizzas opening weekend but we wanted to purchase something so my husband added on meat toppings to his pizza and we purchased a Walnut and Gorgonzola Salad. I have to say the Walnut and Gorgonzola Salad was REALLY DELICIOUS! It was big and made with fresh peppery arugula, lots of tasty cheeses, sweet grape tomatoes, a drizzle of reduced balsamic and some wood fired bread. ($8.50) I really enjoyed the salad and haven't had many others at this price point that were this tasty.

Now to the pizza.

Soon my Margherita pizza arrives with a good amount of fresh basil. The crust is light and thin as promised. You can eat it knife and fork style or you can pick it up. The crust is mild tasting. Maybe a tad bit more development, salt and a tad of more char would do.....The tomatoes are good but not the sweetest, the cheese is good but not the milkiest. Don't take this wrong....The pizza really IS GOOD but for the reasons I mentioned I wouldn't put it up there with the top pizzas of metro Phoenix. HOWEVER if I put this pizza against the other fast casual pizza places I've been to I do have to say THIS MidiCi does have a BIG EDGE on them. It's a much better pizza than from other fast casual pizzas I've tried. I also need to add that this is only a $7.50 pizza. At it's price range this pizza really rocks. I also REALLY ENJOYED the salad and wanted to try the gelato they offer but I was full and the line was long so we didn't feel like going back in line. 

My husband liked the house made sausage but he was CRAZY about the spicy salami they offer....he loved it!

MidiCi pizza is a very nice unique addition to the eateries of Dessert Ridge Marketplace!

Great value Neapolitan Style Pizzas, Really GOOD Salad and More!"}
{"text":"We love this style pizza and MidiCi holds up against the pizza we had in Italy. Fresh and simple  ingredients make for tasty pizza!  The wine list was good too!"}
{"text":"The pizza was excellent, great flavor, thin crust, good sauce.  So what is the problem?  Service!  

Took over thirty minutes to get our salads, only 4 or 5 tables occupied, only happened when we went up to counter asked if we could get the salads!  Took another 15 min (45 total) to get the pizzas, and then we waited for another 15 for our calzone dessert, finally went up to counter, said forget it, take it off the bill.  They had it ready then, and I need to say they gave us free pizza coupons as a way of saying \"we're sorry\".  

So we were not the only ones frustrated, almost all the tables were waiting a long time, servers were frustrated.  When we left, they had 7 pizzas sitting on counter eating to bake.  A server was fanning one of the two ovens, apparently some problems.  

This was on a Sunday, 11:40-12:45.  Should have been ready for the after church crowd!"}
{"text":"So much potential here. Beautiful atmosphere, quality ingredients, nice portions. A little chaotic. We had to get up to get a second beer. Servers should be take drink orders, I imagine the place is losing alcohol sales due to having to get up during your meal if you want a second glass of wine. Food was beautifully presented but slightly underseasoned and our pizzas were undercooked. They really needed another 30 seconds. Just because the oven says it cooks a pizza in 90 seconds doesn't mean it always will. Pizza chefs need to be trained to recognize when the pizza is actually done. I am sure that will come with practice. We will be back just not soon."}
{"text":"Yum, this fast casual neopolitan pizza is one of my favorite lunch places. The burrata with prosciutto and melon is my favorite. Also love the prosciutto white pizza and the double pepperoni. The people are always friendly. Split a salad and a pizza is the perfect amount for 2 people."}
{"text":"Just recently opened, true woodfired Italian Neapolitan pizza served in a chic hip and open environment. The ovens are true wood fired and cook the pies very quickly to perfection.  All the ingredients are fresh and very high quality. The results are amazing. Honestly the best pizza I can remember. They have a wine bar. Order the Nutella and ricotta cheese stuffed calizone with Black Forest cherries. You will never be the same! My wife says they have the best gluten free crust she has ever had. We have been back several times and are hooked. It's a weekly addiction."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best Neapolitan pizza - crust is absolutely perfect! Soft, chewy, and made with 4 simple ingredients. The salads are delicious, fresh and plentiful!  Dined here a handful of times.... always excited to go back. The space is unique with an open kitchen concept, bistro tables, inside and outside, plus a great bar! Fun decor too with a B/W nostalgic, romantic movie playing on the wall at all times. Kudos to the Manager Jill - she's a rockstar!!! Super helpful, attentive and seems to always go the extra mile for guests! The staff really is great there!!! Our bartender was beyond attentive, anticipating our needs. Best part of the meal.... the Nutella Calzone!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I really did. But I didn't enjoy it. I'm not a big fan of the place your order at the counter and we'll bring it out but still tip us kind of places anyway. Did not know that's what this was until we entered. But okay. We ordered sat down and got our food pretty quickly. Which is why I do not understand how our pizza was cold. Not refrigerator cold, but definitely not just out of the oven straight to your table hot. And the flavor was so meh. Crushed red peppers and oregano did not help. Oh well. We tried. But we won't be back."}
{"text":"2nd visit to MidiCi and I have to say that I am not coming back. My husband got served his pizza about 20 minutes ago and I am still waiting for mine, it's been at least 40 minutes since we ordered. His pizza is now cold, he waited since we were planning on sharing and we had to ask twice to check on the missing pizza. So now I've cancelled my order and I'm asking for a refund (one was not offered). No manager has appeared to apologize and the staff doesn't really seem phased.  If you feel like experiencing some below-par service then come here."}
{"text":"Nooo! So my wife and I fell in love with this place when it opened, and always made a date night here. When we came in again, they changed the menu! Now normally I'm ok with a little change, but someone decided to change the best thing on the menu. The caprese salad was our fav starter, and its no longer available. Instead they made a starter called the Burata which is literally the same ingredients as the salad, but much smaller and separated into individual items on a small plate. Really? Guess if we decide to come back we'll order two Burata's and tell them to put it in a bowl. Thanks Midici's!"}
{"text":"Yum, love this gem at desert ridge. Prices are great and the food is amazing. Not like normal pizza places, Midici beautiful decor and great atmosphere for both families and dates"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner on a Friday night. Service and food is phenomenal. Quality of food is wonderful, beer priced very reasonable. We ordered a salad and pizza. Both were very good, this place is every bit as good, if not better then all the wood fired pizza joints in the valley for 1/4 the price. Its a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Just finished an AMAZING experience here! Not only was the customer service with Allen and Michael A plus, the food is delicious and fresh! We celebrated our daughter's bday here with a group of friends and the teeny boppers loved the cool and chill vibe! The staff went over and beyond to create a memorable experience for us all topped off with a mouthwatering Nutella Calzone with drizzled berries :)! Highly recommend this place rather its with a group, for a date or solo quick bite!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Like I wasn't expecting MiDiCi to be this nice, I was pleasantly surprised. First off, the free margherita pizza with a purchase deal on here is amazing, we totally took advantage of it. We got truffle cheese bread and the pizza. Everything was ready pretty quick! The cheesy bread was almost like a calzone with mushrooms. The drizzle on top was tasty but maybe I would've liked if there was marinara sauce to dip it in. Maybe next time I can ask for some on the side. The pizza was light and tasty! Good quality ingredients. I put some fresh garlic on my slices, yum! After I decided to get a hot chocolate. It was good but not what I was expecting, it was not very chocolatey and a bit lukewarm. Everything else was great though and good prices. I also love the open set up. Great addition to desert ridge!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! This place is amazing and first class.  Just stopped in with my daughter and was blown away.  My wife was jealous when I showed her the menu and a quick video.  Great food, friendly staff, cool ambiance.  We will probably be back tomorrow for lunch.  Keep doing such a great job, so nice to have a cool place in desert ridge.  Great for date night or family.  So excited for you guys!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great staff. Make sure you save room for dessert. They have a few yummy things like the Nutella Calzone. My kids and husband loved it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went back to this restaurant for a second try. Sat at the bar. Food Presentation different , not very attentive to customer.appetizers yummy as before, salads are big, deserts reduced in size. Staff seem young and not experienced to waiting on people."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! We really enjoyed this place the crust was nice and charred but had a good chew to it.  We had the devils pizza- SPICY and yummy!! We checked in and got a free Nutella calzone. It was huge and filled with berries and Nutella. More than enough for 4 of us to split. The pizzas are decent sized and 1 was too big for one person to eat. We ordered one per person and all took some home. The reason for 4 vs 5 stars is that the service was just average. You order at the counter and they deliver to table. We waited a while for dirty plates to be cleared. Cool ambiance but it almost seems that it should a sit down restaurant instead."}
{"text":"Amazing food for an amazing price!!! The burrata and meatballs are so good, salads are excellent, and pizzas are incredible authentic Neapolitan pizzas..so many options to choose from and everything is so fresh..you can even pick your own basil..will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"MidiCi finally made it to Phoenix. Pretty good pizza chain restaurant and they opened one in Phoenix at the Desert Ridge.

We started our lunch with several appetizer, cheese board, salad and burrata cheese. I really like burrata cheese in general but theirs wasn't the perfect one. It didn't taste like freshly made. I would have preferred it to be more creamy.

Shared a couple of pizza and they waited to put pizza in the oven until we were ready. We sat at the bar as it said for full service. Thought it was very nice of them to wait until we were ready and we were able to enjoy hot pizza.

After we ordered desert, a chef waited until we were ready to eat as we still had lots of food left. I really liked they timed so well to bring the food to us.

Bar seating was supposed to be a full service but not quite full service. If you order soda, you still have to get up to get your own drinks. Staff behind the bar wasn't friendly unlike the chef or owner. She often forget stuff and we questioned if bar seating was really considered a full service.

Food was good, I enjoyed my pizza and desert vert much. I think I would sit at the regular table next. If I didn't expect a full service, I think my experience here would have been better."}
{"text":"I ate at MidiCi during their free pizza opening weekend. The Margherita pizza had an excellent crust from a wood fired oven, but very little sauce and cheese. The dough was not really covered as the ingredients were so sparse. I don't know if this is the norm, but I'm not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"This pizza is delicious the crust and sauce are divine! Service is excellent, I've been a few times and the staff are so friendly. 

I keep wanting to try their different toppings (you can do a custom pie or chose one from their menu) but can't get beyond the margarita -- it's perfect. So fresh! The decor and ambiance is nice and the bathrooms are really nice and clean too."}
{"text":"Nice place with a good layout where you can see them make your pizza.  The margarita is there specialty and they tell you to eat it with a knife and fork.  Lots of additional toppings to choose from and a good selection of specialty pizzas.

We ordered 3 pizzas, a margarita and a couple of custom topping pizzas.  They give you a number but no real receipt.  Margarita came out fast.  The other two were nowhere to be seen even though we ordered at the same time.  After asking someone about the other two, one of the pizzas came to our table.  Unfortunately the pizza had the wrong toppings.  They quickly made another pizza and brought it over.  3rd pizza still missing.  Asked about it and there were blank stares and they started working on it.  So the three of us got to watch each other eat.  Not the best experience.  I think if you order the margarita you're good to go.  Otherwise maybe not."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. I had Midici in California and I was blown away.  The pizza was the amazing and I wanted to eat the entire place but not at this locaction....

YuCKY... the pizza had no sauce and very little cheese. It was like eating a cardboard box... I think that might have tasted better! 

California, you need to give this Midici's a college seminar on how to make pizza!"}
{"text":"Just had free pizza for their grand opening. Very good with fresh ingredients. Place is cool inside and very welcoming. They have a \"topping\" bar which included fresh basil, excellent EVOO , Calabrian chili oil, grated parm, chili flakes, oregano, and ground black pepper. Wasn't expecting all that...And I also had the kale salad which was OK. Would order something else the next time. This place is gonna be one of my local favorites. Two huge wood burning pizza ovens. They have plenty of staff. Seems like they know how to run a successful business. Thank you for the free pizza (got two free cuz I was with my son and each customer got a free pizza). So very very nice."}
{"text":"When it comes to Neapolitan pizza, Phoenix has an embarrassment of riches, with lots of great restaurants specializing in authentic pies, including many VPN certified establishments. I've got my favorites, but I am always keen to explore new pizza spots when the pictures look on point and the menus have hallmarks of authenticity. So it was that I took my family there Thursday evening.

MidiCi has been open nearly a year, sufficient time to work out bugs in restaurant layout, flow, and service, but it was a confusing first experience.

The restaurant is open, spacious, and full of light. As you enter, there is no one to great you, but a stand with menus on offer. The only path forward takes you past a worker shaping dough and another tending to well-labeled ingredients. It seems at first like a customized pizza line where you order your sauces and toppings, like Fired Pie, but no, these people can't help you. Two awkward interactions later, we arrived at a register in the center of the restaurant where someone can take your order. It was a strange experience that could be made better perhaps by locating this person closer to the entrance, or maybe an \"order here\" sign.

The order-taker had a tough time getting even the simplest custom order into the system (we have a cow's milk allergy in the family, and a simple pizza with red sauce and goat cheese took a number of attempts to enter).

We sat down and only when food arrived did we realize that we had to fetch our own silverware and napkins, located at a station at the far end of the restaurant and not a place you're likely to go or even notice until you have to seek it out. There were self-service soda machines, and then an unlabeled silver canister assumed to be water that actually contained iced tea.

The pizzas exhibit good understanding of the concepts of quality ingredients and proper technique. However, the pizza I order suffered from an over-abundance of toppings. A Diavola typically consists of tomato sauce, mozzarella, and spicy salami. This pizza added spicy sausage and Calabrian peppers. Honestly, it was a tasty combination of flavors, but the volume of toppings weighed down the light, well-risen crust. Less is more.

The appetizers also suffered from lack of restraint. The Burrata was creamy and delicious, with a drizzle of olive oil and a twist of fresh pepper, but the accompanying bread was laden with more olive oil, garlic, and balsamic, and it all overpowered the refreshing Burrata. Plain bread would have better highlighted the centerpiece ingredient.

My wife's salad was similarly overdressed. The theme of each dish was excess where restraint would have been better.

On the positive side, the food was fresh, fast, and reasonably priced. If we return, I'm sure we can have a better experience by requesting them to go light on the toppings and dressings.

One last note, they are the first restaurant I have seen in the valley that offers Aglianico wine by the glass (or at all). This is a tragically under-recognized red wine native to the Campania region (home of Napoli, home of pizza). If not for the inclusion of this wine on the menu, this would be a two-star review."}
{"text":"Ok we tried this place out, we ate from New York so we know food !   This place was awesome  and we only had the salad can you imagine.  The service was 100% spot on even the chef came out and wanted to get me another drink from the machine.  And let me tell you my mom straight from Italy makes the best meatballs hands down then any place around  the meatballs that NONNA makes.   Well when I ordered there meatballs I about fell to the floor fucken taste just like my moms holly shit.   We are coming back again to try there pizza."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I have had in a long time. What makes this place even better is the atmosphere and the service. Luigi was quite funny and the remainder of the staff was very friendly. Love this place, we will be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"The perfect atmosphere to enjoy perfect pizza! I sat at the bar for hours with my friends drinking wine and having the delicious meat and cheese plate! The food and drinks are super reasonably priced and worth every penny. The Nutella calzone is a must!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Good salads and pizzas.  The ingredients are fresh.  It smells great in there and the ambiance is really different and cool.  The bathrooms are also pretty swanky.  Another thing I like is that it's one of the easier restaurants to get in and out of in Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"Read about free Margherita pizza on opening weekend so I came to hive it a try. Pizza hand made fresh in front of you & great selection of toppings to try. Wood fired ovens ( so bling-y!). I got the free Margherita. Outstanding crust with the proper charred bits. Chewy!  Lots of fresh mozzarella, basil, fresh tomato sauce & drizzle of olive oil. Great service and setting. Tall ceilings, mod music, lots of greenery & light. I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"The space is lofty, open and bright. You place your order when you walk in then pick a table. Staff were friendly. We ordered the Margherita Pizza another with prosciutto and a shrimp scampi.  Caesar salad was also in the mix. 
They have a wood fired oven. The dough came out cooked just right not burnt. The crust was thin with nice chewy edges. The margharita pizza was spot on with fresh basil. The other pizzas had copious amounts of arugula. The shrimps were a little small and sparse.  All in all the pizzas were tasty. 
Bathroom was clean and spacious."}
{"text":"Well.. I am pretty disappointed by this place. I've been dying to try this place out. I've heard such good things about this place.i was let down pretty bad. I walked in with my two friends. And I wasn't greeted, no one came over to explain how things worked. It was just a little overwhelming, there was a couple in front of us. They seemed confused as well, let's just say they lost 5 costumers."}
{"text":"Always excited when a new restaurant opens close to him.  Saw a free pizz with a Yelp check in so off we went to check the place ok.  It's a pretty cool looking place.  We ordered a house salad and margarita pizza with prosciutto to share.  While the salad was fresh and had good flavor it was  swimming in dressing.  The pizza was just ok.... not a lot of flavor and a little soggy in the middle.  We would try it again just to give it another chance but ask for less dressing and a well done pizza."}
{"text":"This review is more like 3.5 stars but I rounded up. Let's get to the great: the food. The pizzas and salad I had here were pretty fantastic. We ordered the truffle and the meats pizza and the Italian salad. Everything was delicious! Everything! And prices aren't bad - for two pizzas, salad, two beers and a Bellini, we spent around $53 - that fed four people perfectly. 

I'll get to the needs improvement: setup and the order the counter, self serve piece. We walked in for the first time and it was soooo confusing! We walk up to the counter after a puzzled look on our faces for awhile and tell the cashier we were first timers and she doesn't even give us an introduction: order, get a number, food will be delivered at table, drinks and utensils are on right.... nothing so we were trying to figure it out. It was really annoying! You have at least seven or eight people in the middle making the pizza and there wasn't even one person walking around checking up on customers to assist them in anyway until we were almost done with our food. Again, if they can just be more proactive and service their customers right when they walk in the door to let them know the set up, they would go a long way. 

Other than that, I will be back because the food is on point."}
{"text":"I reserve one star reviews for truly abysmal service or a very low quality product.  In this case, you just don't put ham on a vegan pizza.  The worst part though was the response I got from the waiter when I brought it to his attention- \"at least it was only a little piece\".  Really?  A little piece of anything when it comes to food allergies can kill a person.  The response was more inexcusable than the original mistake.  That's how a business loses customers and I wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and tasty!   Came out quickly.  Staff very friendly and attentive.  Nice ambiance - open, clean, fun. Lots of groups families and friends."}
{"text":"This not a Neapolitan pizzeria. Was not happy with the dry sauce pizza. I ordered meatballs, salad and pizza and asked to bring out salad first, well they just brought everything together.  It's pricey and not worthy. Not a fan of grabbing silverware from a pot everyone digs their hands."}
{"text":"Luckily I waited to write a review after I had been a few times because the first time we weren't impressed. But I knew the menu item I ordered didn't live up to expectations. The shrimp pizza was unimpressive. The second third and fourth time I visited and had the meats pizza. Those are exceptional. The interior is clean and inviting. The bathroom is so beautiful you would want the same thing in your house."}
{"text":"Anyone who dislikes this wonderful chain, needs to get their tastebuds checked out. If you're expecting cheap dominos, fake mozzarella with a side of cardboard flavor type of pizza that is made in five mins or less..then this is not the place for you. Now on to my review.

This place is very self service. But it also isn't fast food. Keep that in mind. You get in line. You order your entrees which in my case was Bianca with pep and a Margherita only 6-7$ each and delicious!!! I also ordered a Nutella Calzone which wow, just wow, it was like only 6$ (free with my yelp check in and feeds at least 3... anyway, You then order your drinks. We ordered soda. We picked out two glass cup and paid for our food. We were given a number and told to sit anywhere. They would bring our food out to us. We grabbed utensils, garlic, parm, pepper flakes like the mobile adults that we are and sat down. We waited for our pizza. It took about 10-15 mins, which was fine because our pizza was being freshly made and cooked in a wood burning oven. A nice waiter brought or pizza out to us and we devoured 50% of it. Our waiter then noticed we were full and brought us a to go box then asked us if we wanted to eat our dessert. Which she then brought out and ended up devouring.  This place is such a gem. Reminds me of the type of pizza I used to eat at Etaly in the flatiron district in NYC.  Great Job! I will be back. It is so hard to find good quality Italian style, wood oven pizza spots in Arizona and this is honestly it.  Thank You!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed! As soon as you walk into this spacious, skylit venue, the aroma of deliciousness permeates your nostrils.

We had the Italian salad (delicious, with the right amount of dressing), the meatballs (right amount of cheese and sauce) and a Margherita pizza. All were very good. 

One downfall would be the repetitive, somewhat loud music. Boom boom boom rang in the ears as much as the smell did in the nose. 

But definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised with our experience. We selected Midici for convenience on our way to the MIM.  It was that and more.
We had the purple kale and ricotta salad and spicy Devils pizza. Both were delicious. 
The two scoops of gelato affrogato style was amazing.
And where can you get draft crafts for $3 from 3 to 6?
They have al fresco dining so now that the weather is cooling off we will be going back to try that.
Plus it's very easy to get to off of Tatum and has plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Hubby told me about this place when they first opened but didn't get to try until today. We took our 20 month old with us for lunch and were happy with our experience.

The place is big and airy, and decor is clean.  The 2 pizza ovens are in eye catching gold and they have impressive appliances in their open kitchen.  We ordered the meatballs appetizer, a Caesar salad, and a classic margarita pizza with meat.  Along with a latte.  Everything was delicious but what was the most satisfying for me was that crispy sweet basil on top of our pizza! Just YUM!  Would have loved more sauce on our meatballs coz the crostini that came with the order was a little dry. The Caesar was a bit over dressed for me but my hubby liked it so this is just a personal preference.

Last but not least I must comment on their spa like restroom. I fell in love with the lemon verbena lotion and now I am on a hunt for it! Apparently I am not the first who took photos of their restroom because it is that nice lol!"}
{"text":"I have been to Midici twice now . The first time was the grand opening . I really enjoyed the pizza and salad . Both times I thought the service was really poor . This last time I went the food was very boring lacked flavor . Pizza lacked cheese entirely . I asked for grated Parmesan from the person that brought out the pizza . Instead of them saying sure I'll bring some I got attitude from a teenager that it was st the bar and to grab it myself . I understand that it's a order and sit down place but if my food is being delivered to table the staff can bring small items . Just not a great experience ."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, decor, and high ceilings to boot. They even have purse hooks on the underside of their tables, which is a nice touch. Their pizzas are a delight (I've tried The Meats, Chicken Pesto, Neapolitan w/ Sausage). They all have that brick-oven taste. The restaurant is kind of by itself in Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"MidiCi house salad. PHENOMENAL!! I'm not usually super into presentation, but I love love love it. Definitely a heavy salad, like could have by itself for a meal. The balsamic glaze and the roasted tomato dressing made me super horny. For sure a 10/10 visit courtneysalads on instagram for more salad reviews!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, fast service; however, the note to self.....ask for salad BEFORE pizza as the pizza was luke warm by time we got to eat it.  The music was a bit too loud for the area, large open room with kind of an echo and they kept playing the same loop over and over and over.  Maybe if it wasn't so loud I wouldn't have noticed it was the same loop.  Also, a chilled glass for beer would be a very nice addition."}
{"text":"Twice in three days for dinner! From start to finish, a top notch experience! Two choices face you when you enter, order at the front and choose your table or sit at the bar and receive full service. Especially if Trenton is there, sit at the bar! Not only can you watch the pizza go in the oven, but Trenton will answer questions and  make great suggestions!

The meat and cheese board was fantastic. Full disclaimer, I grew up on the east coast in an Italian family so I have high standards. Don't miss out on it, 3 cheeses, 3 meats and even the mustard was flavorful. 

We got the double pepperoni pizza- had trouble deciding between that and the diablo, so Trenton suggested we could get some Fresno peppers on the side to make our choice easy! It was delicious, we asked for it well done as we like it a little crispier and it was perfect. 

The second night Tyler took great care of us, he was attentive, checked on us multiple times and was very personable. We are in town until Sunday so there's a good chance we will make it a third time!

DO NOT skip dessert, the Nutella calzone with fresh berries is melt in your mouth and adding a scoop of gelato makes it even better!"}
{"text":"I am addicted to their house salad!  It typically comes with two dressings but I love their balsamic so have them put in two of that one.  It is made fresh and comes with a yummy toasted bread.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"When you charge $9 for a walnut/gorganzola salad with dressing made with some spring lettuce type, please offer crackers or bread or something else.  I liked the salad (nothing special), but I felt that it was kinda cheap considering the cost.  
However, the place is nice and has that clean minimalist vibe.  The service was great, and the managers/owners? were really helpful in cleaning up and helping order.
This place would have gotten more stars from me if they had offered some little something (again, crackers or bread) with the salad."}
{"text":"MidiCi, which is Italian for \"You tell me,\" is a chain of fast casual pizza restaurants that recently opened up their first Phoenix location over in Desert Ridge Marketplace.

Yes, really. We've opened yet another \"fast casual\" pizza restaurant - as if we don't already have enough of them already. But what makes MidiCi dramatically different than the others, you ask? It's simple. They don't cut corners. The strong emphasis on quality and execution far exceeds what you'd find at your usual Fired Pie/Mod/Pieology, or whatever assembly line joint you're visiting this week.

MidiCi operates like a fast casual pizza chain on steroids. They have a trendy setup, complete with mandatory techno-ish music, and an elaborate menu of starters and pizzas that would easily work well at any mid-level pizzeria. Granted, I do have some issues with them marketing themselves as \"Neopolitan,\" while still having the audacity to put a Hawaiian pizza on the menu - but whatever.

We started with their burrata with melon and prosciutto. We've had bad luck with our burrata experiments lately, but their offering is actually pretty decent. No, it's not quite on par with some of the major players in Phoenix (or Flagstaff), but for 8.50, it's a steal. We also ordered their mozzarella meatballs, which were respectable as well.

For pizzas, we ordered the margherita as a baseline, as well as the egg 'n bacon, which includes a combination of rosemary potatoes, bacon, sausage, and a free-range egg to top it off. Honestly, the pizzas are actually very good quality. Sauce tasted great, crust had flavor depth and char, and cheese was top notch. The breakfast pizza, which is incredibly difficult to pull off, was also good - although we both agreed it wasn't quite at the same level as a local pizzerias version of it. Nevertheless, what you can obtain is very good stuff. Additionally, the prices are surprisingly cheap for both the amount and quality of food you receive.

We ordered their Nutella calzone for dessert. As always, it's extremely hard to mess up anything with Nutella. My girlfriend enjoyed the inclusion of berries, whereas I would have been fine with just the Nutella itself. The dessert order was massively delayed for some reason, but they at least acknowledged the mishap.

Being a pizza snob, there are a few things that make me roll my eyes. Boasting about only using four ingredients in their dough (like every other legitimate pizzeria in the world) means they must be targeting a clueless customer base. And seeing about seven pizzas just sitting on the counter for 5-10 minutes waiting for the server to deliver them was enough to make my girlfriend and I cringe. Anyone who is familiar with wood-fired pizzas knows that it's essential to consume the pizza straight out of the oven.

Aside from these minor complaints, I'd still give this place a very solid recommendation. With good prices, high quality, and solid execution, this is probably one of the better (if not best) fast casual pizzerias we've visited in Phoenix.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tried Midici for the first time last week, and it will not be the last!

This is by far the best fast casual pizza place I have ever been to. I felt honestly, the quality and taste of the ingredients was on par with my all-time favorite pizza place Cibo.

I ordered the prosciutto margherita, in gluten free crust. Oh. My. Gosh. It was amazing. I'm still craving it. My friend ordered the el Diablo (or something like that). He loved it. We also split a dessert, the burrata with pear and honey. It was definitely a unique dessert, good but not something I would order again. 

The menu is really expansive for a fast casual, with cheese boards, pizzas, salads and desserts. They also have beer on tap, which is awesome. They have a lot of toppings to add after; Parmesan, garlic, chili oil, peppers, etc. My only issue is they are in jars with lids and when I went to get Parmesan the lid was off and a fly was in the jar. Kinda gross.  

The ambiance and decor was clean, just noisy enough to be a family place or even a date night option.

I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"PI DAY!!!! I tried the Truffle and Prosciutto pizza for the first time tonight. SO good! Mouth watering truffle cream and generous amount of prosciutto make this pizza a winner! I am getting used to their soft and chewy crust. The crust flavor is delicious. Upscale pizza and salads at amazingly low prices, especially on Pi Day. Easy parking, outdoor seating. No room for nutella calzone this time but checkout their Yelp check-in offers. The nutella calzone is amazing!"}
{"text":"MidiCi The Neapolitan Pizza Company is a pizza chain with this restaurant being located in the cool Desert Ridge area. I know they recently expanded to Texas, too. There's a spacious parking lot so parking isn't an issue. You order at the counter and then they bring out your food to you. 

If you've never had Neapolitan? style pizza, you're in for a treat. We're talking authentic Italian pizza. The pizza is thin crust and uses quality ingredients. You'll notice the impressive oven as you walk in the restaurant. Your pizza is cooked at high temperatures and comes out in less than 10 minutes. Great pizza and the ambiance was nice with modern decor. I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is a very unique concept! I went for lunch today with a friend and we were surprised! You walk in and it's a very modern interior with clean lines and a minimalistic feel. There is a giant tree in the middle of the restaurant too!
We ordered the chicken and pesto pizza and the Italian salad. Both were good. The pizza was incredibly greasy, otherwise the taste was good.
This is a very casual restaurant. You get your own silverware and napkins and drinks. It's not a place you will get waited on. They brought us our food but we had to get it own plates and spices for the pizza.
I just wish there was more direction from the staff. I will more than likely come back though."}
{"text":"Just when you thought the last thing the valley needed was another quick-casual build your own pizza shop, MidiCi shows up in Desert Ridge and steps up the game. Delicious, fresh and inexpensive food. A Cool modern setup with the kitchen fully on display. The black and white Italian movie projected against the wall is also a nice touch.

The restaurant is traditional semi-service. Order at the front. Pay a few feet over (while checking out plenty of displays of the fare offerings at the counter and watching the cooks work in the open kitchen). Find a table. Food is brought to you wherever you end up sitting. Drinks, cutlery and other necessities are at a station in the back. As already stated, the ambiance is quite pleasing.

Just a word of warning; Big groups are hard to seat here. Actually, medium groups are pretty tough too.  There's a decent amount of seating, but not enough for the dinner rush. My wife, 2-year-old daughter, and I had to grab a hightop meant for two people and I dragged a third seat over from the bar. It was a tight squeeze but we managed. If we had four or more, we would have had to wait and pray that we could have found a couple tables to push together."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate mothers day. My mom loves to snack on small bites like, cheeses, meats, nuts. Give her a glass of wine or a cold pint of beer and she is happy just like that. I read about this place through yelp and the search of cheese plates/boards. We walked in and immediately you get hints of Italy. High ceilings make this place look huge. The kitchen is right in the middle with an open floor plan with small glass keeping you back over looking all the fresh ingredients.  We were lucky enough to get greeted by the manager and he was very nice and let us know lots about the restaurant. You order at the counter and they bring you out the food. They even serve espresso and gelato. They had a mother's day special buy 1 pizza get a free margarita pizza. We did that and an order of the meat board, meatballs. 3 beers. Very well priced no complaints here. The food was amazing. The meatballs so moist so good. The pizza had the perfect dough, not heavy at all. And i didnt get the pizza bloat. the meats from the board were imported and delicious. It won me over and i will defiantly be back for more."}
{"text":"Friendly staff with great service. Ordering food is easy and arrives fast. Ordered a margarita and a devils pizza. Both were excellent and inexpensive. Happy hour runs 3-6 with $3 drafts and $4 wines. Atmosphere is nice and very casual. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not impressed, the place appears to have a nice ambience when you first walk In! That is the last time you will like this place!!! (Continue reading, redemption has its places) The employees have a very uncaring attitude and after we ordered our pizza, we waited approx 30 minutes to get our cold pizza and when asked why our appetizer didn't make it before the pizza came - Girl just responded \"Hahaha, right, I know\" and walked off!!! The appetizer came 11 minutes later!! Management is very un-apologetic about the way things were handled and felt nothing really was wrong (Yohan)
I recommend going to Blaze pizza where I will continue to go....
Johan did offer a free pizza who h we did take, the food is actually very good - But only if hot!
Sadly, this place has got a great concept and Yohan came thru in the end and made us semi happy customers in the end!! We will give it a month or so and try again."}
{"text":"Food = 10/10, Service and Concept = 7/10

I have been WAITING for MidiCi to open! For the most part, my experience was good. But... You can tell they have some kinks to work out. The food was fantastic, and the place is adorable! AHHH - it's just the service needs some improvement. We ordered the meatball app, a Cesar salad, two pizzas (Yelp Check-In Deal), and the Nutella calzone. Again, zero complaints on the food. I really enjoyed it all! However, the staff seemed very uninterested in us, answering our questions, and helping us through our first visit here.. When it came time for our dessert, it was about 30 minutes late to the punch. We ordered it right after we ate our appetizer and salads and sat there waiting for it about 30 minutes after we were finished with our pizzas. They kept saying it was on its way but we just kept waiting and waiting and waiting! 

Even though my visit was a little rocky, I will definitely give MidiCi a second chance. Again, the food was so tasty and I strongly believe new restaurants deserve time to grow, and figure things out. Constructive feedback is important, so no angry customer here, just wanting to see an improvement in this aspect of a yummy new pizza joint."}
{"text":"This place has a nice concept. I like the layout of the place and that you can see them preparing and cooking the food. The pizza was pretty good, although it seemed like a lot of the pizzas were slightly undercooked. The salad would have been amazing if it wasn't drenched in dressing. They should have used half the amount of dressing. I couldn't even eat the salad because of this. I thought it was odd that they bring out the pizza to your table and then tell you to go get your own silverware, plates, and toppings (Parmesan, red pepper, etc). I went to order gelato and was standing at the register for a pretty long time while I was basically ignored by all the employees that were right in front of me. The gelato was pretty good once I finally got it. I will say that this place was pretty cheap and the portions were large. If I go back I will make sure to have salad dressing on the side."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere! Love the giant tree in the center of the room. The staff was super friendly and the food was fantastic. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Looked promising but it is one of the order at the register and wait for it to arrive places. I wanted full serve but hoped for the best. 
Ordered a marguerita n house salad

Server slammed the salad down n befbi coild ask for napkins and utensils he pointed clear across the room   
So recovering from knee surgery. I had the un privelege of hobbling across the room to get my own napkin and utensils. How hard would it be to automatically bring them w the food?

Salad was ok

Pizza undercooked not crisp crust i expected.  And quite oddly flavorless. I expected a little of that over charring on crust and more flavorful sauce...

I think it is too pricey and for the money i could have had pizzeria bianca and actual service"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my first experience at Midici- the decor is better than fast casual, and the staff is welcoming and accommodating. I took advantage of the free margarita pizza with a Yelp check-in and ordered a Caesar salad to go. Both food options delivered. The pizza tastes light and fresh- the size could please a hungry person or potentially feed two. The Caesar salad is awesome- dressing is really tasty, but if you order to go, ask for extra dressing. They only serve with one to-go dressing. Desserts looked great. My only advice is to add a happy hour. Wine is $7+ for a glass, which is fine, but I see many more customers coming in if there's a reduced price during HH hours. Glad to see more restaurants coming into Desert Ridge.

Went back last night for take out and had another amazing experience! The purple kale salad is incredible. Light dressing that makes the kale a little less earthy tasting and sprinkled with dates for a fun topper. The biggest and best surprise is the Nutella dessert. Holy freaking smokes. It's incredible!!!!!! Do not miss out."}
{"text":"Great prices! We have eaten there 4 times since the opening and food has consistently been delicious - will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I like this place and hopes it makes it. The food is good and super fast and the ambiance is really cool with lounge seating outside. The salad with the dates in it was actually amazing and my friend and I shared a white margherita pizza which was light and delicious. It was kind of dead on a Saturday night though so I am not sure how long it can survive."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Amazing Neapolitan pizza and very cool atmosphere. It was fast service, great for, and a great time had by myself and all my friends. I hope to go again!"}
{"text":"Super cool place ! I ordered a house salad and it was amazing ! He portion is perfect too. One suggestion: have half pizza and half salad as a lunch option ! 
Overall would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Love this pizza spot. It's got a great ambiance for a casual/fast dining place. The margarita pizza is nice and light but still filling. Double pepperoni pizza is also nice but the pepperoni is a little spicy for me. Good prices too. Worth checking out and letting the food speak for itself."}
{"text":"Just at Midicis again today for my mid day meatball snack! I love it here! The staff are always so friendly and treat me like family! Great job keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times already. The food and service are consistently impressive they have a lunch special: personal pizza and salad for $10, you can upgrade your tea or soda to a beer for $1....dollar beers: I'm in!  I've only eaten the house salad and pesto pizza with spinach and garlic. My friends have ventured out. Everything has been fresh. I go home with leftovers I've only been here at least early lunch hour. Haven't had to wait for a seat or for food. It's not too loud, like pita jungle across the street. Plenty of ez parking too."}
{"text":"This was a really nice Upscale Pizza Restaurant. Not only do they serve pizza that they make in front of you they also have a gourmet pizza menu as well as Gourmet coffees and Specialty teas. the pizza was fantastic the toppings were amazing it was well-cooked tasted just great. You should try this by all means!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy service. Very friendly. Yummy pizza and salad! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My kids and I arrived at MidiCi's on Friday around 6:15 and placed a to go order for 2 pizzas and 1 salad.  I didn't walk out of there with my order until 7:20.  I understand it was a busy Friday night, but that is an excessive wait time and although management was walking around (one greeting all of his friends as they came in) did not stop by any of the people that had been waiting for so long to apologize or offer anything to us except a glass of water.  I received the salad about 20 minutes prior to my pizza (keep in mind my order was to go).  I ordered the Italian salad because I wanted a salad with protein on it but sadly it had only 5 very thinly sliced pieces of salami as the only protein and literally only 4 tiny croutons (I counted because my daughter was so hungry I picked the croutons off to give her to hopefully hold her over until our pizza was done and we could go home to eat with my husband).  My kids were starving, my dog was home waiting to be fed so at 7:09, I let the expediter (the only person who would make eye contact with waiting customers) know I had to leave to take my kids home, put my salad in the fridge and would return for my pizzas (thankfully I live close).  When I got back she gave me my 2 pizza's which was right about 7:20pm.  I left without any apology for the wait, or any incentive to return back.  An offer of a free dessert, appetizer or even a fountain drink would have been a nice way to at least recognize the wait should not be that long (and if in their mind it is an appropriate time to wait, then they really should let customers know when they are placing their order that there is a longer than usual wait time upfront).  This place has a lot of seating so it could be good for groups and families; however, they only have two pizza ovens which clearly is not enough for that much available seating.  

Throughout our wait, my son kept reminding me it was worth it because we had eaten there a few days ago and the pizza was really good, very soft and fluffy dough.  Not this time.. the Chicken Pesto pizza was cold and the crust on both was burnt and hard and of course my salad that really should have just been a house salad with the small amount of salami and croutons it had on it.  Very disappointing and really no reason to return at this point."}
{"text":"When Arizona got ranked #1 in the United States for pizza... they obviously knew it was because  MidiCi was coming!! They don't cut corners on ingredients and their staff was nice and friendly.

Definitely recommend this to all my friends and family!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing new addition to the Desert Ridge area! The food is delicious (and at a great price point) and the people working there were very nice. Ordered food to go but will be back to enjoy it soon!!"}
{"text":"Made the order and felt like the customer service was way under par starting from the cashier. From that point with the representation of a new establishment I was very disappointed. Felt like the lady was kind of rude or maybe just having a bad day or something. To go get your drinks you need to squeeze by people in their chairs and tables and feel like there is no room to get by. Having a few people with us and waiting for over a half hour after eating for somebody to clean off our tables felt like we won't be eating here again. Pizza is average and services are horrible."}
{"text":"The kind of pizza place that you want to come back to again and again. So many choices and each one better than the last. Scrumptious! 

They have 16 Specialty Pizzas and an endless array of toppings for a \"build-your-own\" pizza. So you are not in the mood for pizza? The Salads are just filled with yummy ingredients and there are 10 choices - all large and inexpensive. My favorite is the \"Rock Shrimp & Avocado\"! But maybe you might be in the mood for \"Purple Kale & Ricotta\" or \"The Sweet Life Salad\"? And their \"Caprese Salad\" looked yummy.

Be sure you save room for dessert. You absolutely cannot leave without having a calzone with Nutella© and fresh berries . . . or \"The Drowning Gelato\" - gourmet Italian vanilla bean gelato drowning in espresso. And the gourmet coffee bar . . . oh my!

Beer and wine for self-indulgers is available. But so are 12 kinds of tea and Italian soda and juices.

One thing for sure when you visit MidiCi, you will not leave hungry. You will be satisfied. Completely."}
{"text":"Great place. We loved their atmosphere, location, quality of food and outstanding customer service.
We are planning to go back again and again and tell friends."}
{"text":"So happy to come here to celebrate a birthday! We had a large party with kids and they were more than accommodating! The atmosphere was amazing and the service was top notch! The moment the pizza hits the table it's hard to put down! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"All in all, it was a great experience. All the suggested dishes were amazing. The service was fantastic. The manager made an effort to connect with us and ensure our experience is a positive one. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. Amazing pizzas and salads. The burrata and prosciutto appetizer is unreal. This place is like Italy in Arizona!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the overall experience (though that's pushing it) and 4 stars for the food.

This isn't your typical Neapolitan pizzeria. I'd compare it to a Blaze/MOD but more elevated in atmosphere, approach and some ingredients. The Burratta with Melon & Prosciutto is excellent - my favorite thing we tried. I would have liked to have seen the melon thinly sliced for easier pairing with the bread/burratta, however. The Rock Shrimp & Avocado salad was tasty too - enough for 2-3 to split, could have used more shrimp as they are quite tiny. The Meats pizza is OK, I'm betting something a little more simple would be better - like the Margherita with Prosciutto. 

ISSUES W/THE TIMING & SERVICE
-We stressed that we wanted to have our \"courses\" spaced out to enjoy one at a time without letting the hot pizza get cold. They didn't get this right, even after having a pretty detailed conversation with BOTH the ordering staff and ALSO the cashier staff (separate areas). Right now this really isn't that kind of place (though the atmosphere presents itself to be) BUT with some improved training, all staff could be better aware and truly create more of a positive customer experience! 
-Note, after speaking with the manager timing was made right.
-Also, there is a condiments bar where you grab your own plates/peppers/cheese, etc. This should be made clear to every guest upon ordering. (we were not informed of this)"}
{"text":"Freaking awesome pizza place. It was a last minute decision to run over to MidiCi for lunch on a Saturday. I had very low expectations, it is Desert Ridge after all. We were blown away!

We only ordered pizza, but it was delicious. The crust was perfect and the ingredients were fresh on the Margherita and House Pesto that we ordered. MidiCi has a contemporary vibe and  a wide range of choices on the menu.

You. Must. Go."}
{"text":"Found this little gem in the front of desert ridge shopping center and was very pleased. Really nice open kitchen pizza joint with a unique half-self service flow. Well done interior design..bathrooms are AWESOME. People were friendly and polite. 

We shall surely be back."}
{"text":"I work nearby and received a voucher for a free margherita pizza. I skrted over to MidiCi for my lunch break and was pleasantly shocked by the atmosphere. This large open floor plan features a LIVE TREE, beautiful copper details, and a wide range of seating from high top tables to booths to regular tables. The tables even have purse/ bag hooks on them so that you can keep your personal belongings off the floor or your chair. The service was fantastic, they were heavily staffed for their opening week and all of the employees were kind and welcoming. My favorite part of this restaurant was the toppings bar near the soda fountain. There are free toppings like fresh basil, sea salt, Italian oregano, and Parmesan along with all the other odds and ends you'd need like napkins and little containers for the toppings. The Neopolitan pizza dough is what this place is all about, featuring only a small number of ingredients. The pizza was fresh and made to order. I would take their suggestion to eat with a fork and knife, because this pizza was a little on the \"wet\" side. In my opinion, the dough is really plain tasting but I do appreciate the freshness and small number of ingredients used to make it. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is great and the people are even better if that is possible!  Great atmosphere.  Luigi was the best host ever!!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza place in Scottsdale! The food is incredible and the ingredients are imported from Italy and non-GMO. They also have gluten free crusts which I was very pleased to find. The atmosphere and design of the restaurant is an experience of itself AND the service is remarkable! The head chef, Luigi, even came out and introduced himself to my family and I and gave us a loaf of bread and brought one of their meatballs to try. This is a restaurant that I recommend to EVERYONE, especially if you are looking healthy authentic pizza!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried MidiCi on the recommendation of a friend. We were both very impressed. The restaurant is open and airy. The menu is extensive with many salad, pizza and pasta options. We shared an Italian salad with kalamata olives, peppers, tomatoes and salami. It was fresh and delicious. We also shared the Genoa pizza. It had fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, arugula and basil. It was excellent as well. The portions are good size and the prices are modest. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good and the value is amazing. 

We had 2 salads (chopped salad, purple kale) and a pizza for $32. This was a good amount of food for a lunch for 2. 

The ambiance is casual but nice and modern feeling. 

I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I have been to Italy and hands down this is the BEST pizza I've ever had! The salad was delicious as well. And we enjoyed the atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Perfect fast and delicious lunch. They offer a pizza with two toppings , choice of salad and a drink for 10 bucks!  Whaaaat?   The salad was zippy with a drizzle of sweet balsamic glaze. I ordered the Margherita Pizza with additional mushrooms and Ricotta. A perfect combination. The crust was a nice meld of charred edges with a chewy crust, perfectly cooked. The toppings were plentiful. I love the condiment bar where you can add additional seasonings. We were early but soon the lunch rush was building. Going back in a few days to introduce my gf to this sweet spot."}
{"text":"Such a cute place for lunch or quick dinner. Pizza's and salads are delicious and can't believe how reasonable the prices are. Wish it was advertised better because I am afraid that it may not last in this location! Do yourself a favor and try it!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and had excellent service. The food is amazing and fresh and despite the large crowd on a sat night- it came out quickly.  Everything was fresh and delicious!!! The burrata app was creamy and melr in your mouth. Salad delicious and fresh. Pizza cooked perfectly and toppings were great. I usually never  get dessert but oh my i am so glad we did ! The bathrooms are impeccably clean and expertly designed and almost made me wanna hang out in there.  I love that the location has lots of parking. I had an excellent experience and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! Wow! Not in a good way. 

We came here soon after opening and were greeted with enthusiasm, smiling faces and yummy smells. 

Today we got an iced coffee that was less than a full glass and slightly warm. We asked for cream and was told they had no cream then offered 2% milk. Returned it BUT not in exchange for a cappuccino which was bitter. We were charged again for a poor beverage. Ordered prosciutto and melon which had only two small pieces of toast, meat seemed drier than usual and the melon wasn't cleaned and trimmed well. What happened? This place used to sweat the details. I can't say that anymore. We cut our losses and left."}
{"text":"Very nice, clean and friendly pizza joint. I was very impressed with their pizzas. The dough was amazing, perfect chewiness and thickness. Once you have a good pizza dough, anything you put on it will be good.

They recommended margarita pizza and it was so yummy. The Devil's pizza for the spicy food lovers is also amazing. 

I can see this place becoming my favorite pizza joint. The best part is the prices. Very reasonable even for teenagers. Will be back to try all their other pizzas and salads."}
{"text":"By far the best gluten-free pizza crust I have EVER had. In fact, it was so good, I was suspicious. They assured me, though, that it was indeed gluten-free. It tastes like a true pizza crust from Italy - light, chewy, crispy all at once. The pesto sauce was incredible too. I can't wait to bring my family here!"}
{"text":"Tried to order online from their website.  Hit the order online button, brings up a map, click on the restaurant near us, and that takes me back to the main page where I can 'order online'.  Next, called for an hour and a half to order over the phone.  The line is busy.  My wife tried 20 times with no luck, just a busy signal.  Finally,  I go to the restaurant to order take out, and I wait 20 minutes in line just to order.  I then wait another 20 minutes for a salad and one pizza.  As I'm waiting, I'm watching the two groups behind me in line get served at their tables.  The food is pretty good, but not worth the frustration."}
{"text":"Love this place. 
Great Italian pizza at a great price. 
Love the atmosphere. 
Give it a try. Won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Highly recommend this new spot. The owners are incredibly kind and the wood fired pizza is amazing. Get the Nutella calzone for dessert... fantastic! Great atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Expected it to be like so many other locations that have the Neapolitan type but it was much better.  Good sauce and crust.  Great atmosphere and glad that it's in the Desert Ridge area as well.  I'll be going back at some point for more."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, and the chef and management welcome you at the door ...."}
